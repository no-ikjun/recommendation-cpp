 Although the progressive integration of the princely states into India was largely peaceful , not all princes were happy with the outcome . Many had expected the Instruments of Accession to be permanent , and were unhappy about losing the autonomy and the guaranteed continued existence of their states they had expected to gain . Some felt uneasy about the disappearance of states that generations of their family had controlled , while others were unhappy about the disappearance of administrative structures they had worked hard to build up and which they believed to be efficient . The majority , however , despite the " strain and tension " of adapting to life as private citizens , were content to retire on the generous pension provided by the privy purse . Several took advantage of their eligibility to hold public offices under the central government . The Maharaja of Bhavnagar , Col. Krishna <unk> <unk> <unk> , for example , became the Governor of Madras State , and several others were appointed to diplomatic posts overseas . 
 = = = Colonial enclaves = = = 
 The integration of the princely states raised the question of the future of the remaining colonial enclaves in India . At independence , the regions of Pondicherry , <unk> , Yanam , Mahe and Chandernagore were still colonies of France , and Daman and Diu , Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Goa remained colonies of Portugal . An agreement between France and India in 1948 provided for an election in France 's remaining Indian possessions to choose their political future . A plebiscite held in Chandernagore on 19 June 1949 resulted in a vote of 7 @,@ 463 to 114 in favour of being integrated with India . It was ceded to India on a de facto basis on 14 August 1949 and de jure on 2 May 1950 . In the other enclaves , however , the pro @-@ French camp , led by Edouard <unk> , used the administrative machinery to suppress the pro @-@ merger groups . Popular discontent rose , and in 1954 demonstrations in Yanam and Mahe resulted in pro @-@ merger groups assuming power . A referendum in Pondicherry and Karaikal in October 1954 resulted in a vote in favour of merger , and on 1 November 1954 , de facto control over all four enclaves was transferred to the Republic of India . A treaty of cession was signed in May 1956 , and following ratification by the French National Assembly in May 1962 , de jure control of the enclaves was also transferred . 
 Portugal , in contrast , resisted diplomatic solutions . It viewed its continued possession of its Indian enclaves as a matter of national pride and , in 1951 , it amended its constitution to convert its possessions in India into Portuguese provinces . In July 1954 , an uprising in Dadra and Nagar Haveli threw off Portuguese rule . The Portuguese attempted to send forces from Daman to reoccupy the enclaves , but were prevented from doing so by Indian troops . Portugal initiated proceedings before the International Court of Justice to compel India to allow its troops access to the enclave , but the Court rejected its complaint in 1960 , holding that India was within its rights in denying Portugal military access . In 1961 , the Constitution of India was amended to incorporate Dadra and Nagar Haveli into India as a Union Territory . 
 Goa , Daman and Diu remained an outstanding issue . On 15 August 1955 , five thousand non @-@ violent demonstrators marched against the Portuguese at the border , and were met with gunfire , killing 22 . In December 1960 , the United Nations General Assembly rejected Portugal 's contention that its overseas possessions were provinces , and formally listed them as " non @-@ self @-@ governing territories " . Although Nehru continued to favour a negotiated solution , the Portuguese suppression of a revolt in Angola in 1961 radicalised Indian public opinion , and increased the pressure on the Government of India to take military action . African leaders , too , put pressure on Nehru to take action in Goa , which they argued would save Africa from further horrors . On 18 December 1961 , following the collapse of an American attempt to find a negotiated solution , the Indian Army entered Portuguese India and defeated the Portuguese garrisons there . The Portuguese took the matter to the Security Council but a resolution calling on India to withdraw its troops immediately was defeated by the USSR 's veto . Portugal surrendered on 19 December . This take @-@ over ended the last of the European colonies in India . Goa was incorporated into India as a centrally administered union territory and , in 1987 , became a state . 
 = = = Sikkim = = = 
 Three princely states bordering India — Nepal , Bhutan and Sikkim — were not integrated into the Republic of India in the period between 1947 and 1950 . Nepal had been recognised by the British and the Government of India as being de jure independent . Bhutan had in the British period been considered a protectorate outside the international frontier of India . The Government of India entered into a treaty with Bhutan in 1949 continuing this arrangement , and providing that Bhutan would abide by the advice of the Government of India in the conduct of its external affairs . 
 Historically , Sikkim was a British dependency , with a status similar to that of the other princely states , and was therefore considered to be within the frontiers of India in the colonial period . On independence , however , the Chogyal of Sikkim resisted full integration into India . Given the region 's strategic importance to India , the Government of India signed first a Standstill Agreement and then in 1950 a full treaty with the Chogyal of Sikkim which in effect made it a protectorate which was no longer part of India . India had responsibility for defence , external affairs and communications , and ultimate responsibility for law and order , but Sikkim was otherwise given full internal autonomy . In the late 1960s and early 1970s , the Chogyal Palden <unk> Namgyal , supported by the minority Bhutia and Lepcha upper classes , attempted to negotiate greater powers , particularly over external affairs , to give Sikkim more of an international personality . These policies were opposed by Kazi <unk> Dorji and the Sikkim State Congress , who represented the ethnic Nepali middle classes and took a more pro @-@ Indian view . 
 In April 1973 , anti @-@ Chogyal agitation broke out and protestors demanded popular elections . The Sikkim police were unable to control the demonstrations , and Dorji asked India to exercise its responsibility for law and order and intervene . India facilitated negotiations between the Chogyal and Dorji , and produced an agreement , which envisaged the reduction of the Chogyal to the role of a constitutional monarch and the holding of elections based on a new ethnic power @-@ sharing formula . The Chogyal 's opponents won an overwhelming victory , and a new Constitution was drafted providing for Sikkim to be associated with the Republic of India . On 10 April 1975 , the Sikkim Assembly passed a resolution calling for the state to be fully integrated into India . This resolution was endorsed by 97 % of the vote in a referendum held on 14 April 1975 , following which the Indian Government amended the constitution to admit Sikkim into India as its 22nd state . 
 = = = <unk> and sub @-@ nationalism = = = 
 While the majority of princely states absorbed into India have been fully integrated , a few outstanding issues remain . The most prominent of these is in relation to Kashmir , where a violent secessionist insurgency has been raging since the late 1980s . 
 Some academics suggest that the insurgency in Kashmir is at least partly a result of the manner in which it was integrated into India . Kashmir , uniquely amongst princely states , was not required to sign either a Merger Agreement or a revised Instrument of Accession giving India control over a larger number of issues than the three originally provided for . Instead , the power to make laws relating to Kashmir was granted to the Government of India by Article 5 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir and was , under Article 370 of the Constitution of India , somewhat more restricted than in relation to other states . <unk> argues that during the 1980s , a number of Kashmiri youth began to feel that the Indian government was increasingly interfering in the politics of Jammu and Kashmir . The elections of 1987 caused them to lose faith in the political process and begin the violent insurgency which is still ongoing . Similarly , Ganguly suggests that the policies of the Indian government towards Kashmir meant that the state , unlike other parts of India , never developed the solid political institutions associated with a modern multi @-@ ethnic democracy . As a result , the growing dissatisfaction with the status quo felt by an increasingly politically aware youth was expressed through non @-@ political channels which Pakistan , seeking to weaken India 's hold over Kashmir , transformed into an active insurgency . 
 Separatist movements also exist in two other former princely states located in Northeast India — Tripura and Manipur . These separatist movements are generally treated by scholars as being part of the broader problem of insurgencies in North @-@ east India , rather being a result of specific problems in integrating the princely states into India , as the Kashmir problem is and , in particular , to reflect the failure of the Government of India to adequately address the aspirations of tribal groups in the Northeast , or to tackle the tensions arising from the immigration of people from other parts of India to the north @-@ eastern areas . 
 The integration of former princely states with other provinces to form new states has also given rise to some issues . The Telangana region , comprising the Telugu @-@ speaking districts of the former Hyderabad State , were in many ways different from the Telugu @-@ speaking areas of British India with which they were merged . In recognition of these differences , the States Reorganisation Commission originally recommended that Telangana be created as a separate state , rather than as part of a broader Telugu @-@ speaking entity . This recommendation was rejected by the Government of India , and Telangana was merged into Andhra Pradesh . The result was the emergence in the 1960s of a movement demanding a separate Telangana state . The demand has been accepted by the Union Government , leading to formation of Telangana as the 29th state of India in June 2014 . A similar movement , although less strong , exists in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra , which consists of the former Nagpur state and the Berar region of the former Hyderabad state . 
 = = Critical perspectives on the process of integration = = 
 The integration process repeatedly brought Indian and Pakistani leaders into conflict . During negotiations , Jinnah , representing the Muslim League , strongly supported the right of the princely states to remain independent , joining neither India nor Pakistan , an attitude which was diametrically opposed to the stance taken by Nehru and the Congress and which was reflected in Pakistan 's support of Hyderabad 's bid to stay independent . Post @-@ partition , the Government of Pakistan accused India of hypocrisy on the ground that there was little difference between the accession of the ruler of Junagadh to Pakistan — which India refused to recognise — and the accession of the Maharajah of Kashmir to India , and for several years refused to recognise the legality of India 's incorporation of Junagadh , treating it as de jure Pakistani territory . 
 Different theories have been proposed to explain the designs of Indian and Pakistani leaders in this period . Rajmohan Gandhi postulates that an ideal deal working in the mind of Patel was that if Muhammad Ali Jinnah let India have Junagadh and Hyderabad , Patel would not object to Kashmir acceding to Pakistan . In his book Patel : A Life , Gandhi asserts that Jinnah sought to engage the questions of Junagadh and Hyderabad in the same battle . It is suggested that he wanted India to ask for a plebiscite in Junagadh and Hyderabad , knowing thus that the principle then would have to be applied to Kashmir , where the Muslim @-@ majority would , he believed , vote for Pakistan . A speech by Patel at the <unk> College in Junagadh following the latter 's take @-@ over , where he said that " we would agree to Kashmir if they agreed to Hyderabad " , suggests that he may have been amenable to this idea . Although Patel 's opinions were not India 's policy , nor were they shared by Nehru , both leaders were angered at Jinnah 's courting the princes of Jodhpur , Bhopal and Indore , leading them to take a harder stance on a possible deal with Pakistan . 
 Modern historians have also re @-@ examined the role of the States Department and Lord Mountbatten during the accession process . Ian Copland argues that the Congress leaders did not intend the settlement contained in the Instruments of Accession to be permanent even when they were signed , and at all times privately contemplated a complete integration of the sort that ensued between 1948 and 1950 . He points out that the mergers and cession of powers to the Government of India between 1948 and 1950 contravened the terms of the Instruments of Accession , and were incompatible with the express assurances of internal autonomy and preservation of the princely states which Mountbatten had given the princes . Menon in his memoirs stated that the changes to the initial terms of accession were in every instance freely consented to by the princes with no element of coercion . Copland disagrees , on the basis that foreign diplomats at the time believed that the princes had been given no choice but to sign , and that a few princes expressed their unhappiness with the arrangements . He also criticises Mountbatten 's role , saying that while he stayed within the letter of the law , he was at least under a moral obligation to do something for the princes when it became apparent that the Government of India was going to alter the terms on which accession took place , and that he should never have lent his support to the bargain given that it could not be guaranteed after independence . Both Copland and <unk> argue that , in the ultimate analysis , one of the reasons why the princes consented to the demise of their states was that they felt abandoned by the British , and saw themselves as having little other option . Older historians such as Lumby , in contrast , take the view that the princely states could not have survived as independent entities after the transfer of power , and that their demise was inevitable . They therefore view successful integration of all princely states into India as a triumph for the Government of India and Lord Mountbatten , and as a tribute to the sagacity of the majority of princes , who jointly achieved in a few months what the Empire had attempted , unsuccessfully , to do for over a century — unite all of India under one rule . 
 = John Brooke @-@ Little = 
 John Philip Brook Brooke @-@ Little , CVO KStJ FSA FHS ( 6 April 1927 – 13 February 2006 ) was an influential and popular English writer on heraldic subjects , and a long @-@ serving herald at the College of Arms in London . In 1947 , while still a student , Brooke @-@ Little founded the Society of Heraldic Antiquaries , now known as the Heraldry Society and recognised as one of the leading learned societies in its field . He served as the society 's chairman for 50 years and then as its President from 1997 until his death in 2006 . In addition to the foundation of this group , Brooke @-@ Little was involved in other heraldic groups and societies and worked for many years as an officer of arms ; beginning as Bluemantle Pursuivant , Brooke @-@ Little rose to the second highest heraldic office in England : Clarenceux King of Arms . 
 = = Early and private life = = 
 John Brooke @-@ Little was born in Blackheath , Kent . His mother , Constance Egan , was the author of many children 's stories including the Epaminondas books and the adventures of <unk> the Baby Elephant . In the 1920s , Egan was the editor of Home Chat . This helped to prepare her for future editorial duties with the Heraldry Society 's journal , the Coat of Arms in the 1950s . She was the second wife of Raymond Brooke @-@ Little , who worked as an electrical engineer . His paternal ancestors , the Littles , came from Wiltshire and may be traced in the parish registers of <unk> back to the late seventeenth century . A pedigree of his family appears in the 1972 edition of Burke 's Landed Gentry under the heading " Brooke @-@ Little of Heyford House " . Brooke @-@ Little was educated at <unk> School , a progressive co @-@ educational public school in Dorset . The school remained an important part of Brooke @-@ Little 's life , and he later sent his own children there . He oversaw the process of granting arms to the school while serving as chairman of its board of governors from 1971 to 1983 . 
 As a boy , Brooke @-@ Little 's first contact with the College of Arms came when he went to see Sir Algar Howard , then Garter Principal King of Arms . Howard was the head of the corporation of heralds at the College of Arms , and encouraged Brooke @-@ Little 's budding interest in the subject of heraldry . While still a student , he founded a heraldry society with his friends . Brooke @-@ Little went to New College , Oxford in 1949 and read history . His college friends included Colin Cole , later Garter King of Arms , with whom he refounded the dormant Oxford University Heraldry Society . The two men refounded it a second time in 1958 . The Society was refounded in 2005 and currently holds one lecture per term . 
 Brooke @-@ Little married Mary Pierce , daughter of John Raymond Pierce , in 1960 . The couple had three sons , Philip , Leo , and Merlin , and one daughter , Clare . In 2004 , after having retired from the College of Arms , Brooke @-@ Little lived at his Heyford House in Oxfordshire with the families of both Leo and Merlin . 
 Brooke @-@ Little had a major stroke in 1994 . This incident left his mobility and speech partly impaired , though his mind was still quite sharp . He continued in his heraldic duties until his retirement three years later . He also continued to guide the Heraldry Society after this . He suffered a succession of minor strokes over his last years as a herald and during his retirement . He was still able to make appearances at functions of the Heraldry Society , though his role was severely limited by debilitating arthritis . It was a short series of several of these small strokes in quick succession which led to Brooke @-@ Little 's death on 13 February 2006 in Banbury , Oxfordshire , at the age of 78 . He was one of the last surviving officers of arms to serve at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II . The funeral took place on 23 February 2006 , and the eulogy was delivered by Sir Henry Paston @-@ <unk> , York Herald . 
 = = Heraldic career = = 
 In 1952 – 3 , Brooke @-@ Little served on the staff assembled by the Earl Marshal to plan the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II . He was appointed a Gold Staff Officer for the Coronation and held a key co @-@ ordination role during planning as well as on the day . It was his abiding interest in heraldry that led to this appointment , and this work with the Earl Marshal and the officers of arms led to his first heraldic appointment . He joined the College of Arms as Bluemantle Pursuivant in 1956 . The rank of pursuivant is the junior of the three levels an officer of arms can attain , and Brooke @-@ Little related the story of his appointment in an editorial . In 1956 , Sir George Bellew , the Garter King of Arms , had recommended Brooke @-@ Little and Colin Cole for the open position of Bluemantle . The two were asked to meet with the Earl Marshal in London . The Earl Marshal was not usually faced with two candidates for an opening ; he offered the position to Cole , who turned it down as his wife was expecting a child . Brooke @-@ Little was made Bluemantle . Several months later when Sir Gerald Wollaston died , in the ensuing shuffle Cole was finally given his appointment as Portcullis Pursuivant . 
 In 1967 , Brooke @-@ Little was advanced to the position of Richmond Herald . On 7 July 1980 , after almost thirty years of service to the Earl Marshal and the College of Arms , Brooke @-@ Little was appointed to replace Sir Walter <unk> as Norroy and Ulster King of Arms , with heraldic authority in the part of England north of the Trent , as well as in Northern Ireland . While serving in that office , he enjoyed telling people that the commonly held view that the Order of Saint Patrick was extinct was quite false . Brooke @-@ Little believed that as the Ulster King of Arms – the capacity in which he handled Northern Irish heraldry – he remained ex officio an Officer of the Order . As the holder of that office , he and his successors would remain the Order 's King of Arms , Registrar and Knight Attendant , until such time as the Sovereign should choose formally to abolish the office of Ulster King of Arms or to declare that these positions are not vested in the office . The fact that the last knight had died in 1974 was of little consequence to such a staunch traditionalist . 
 Brooke @-@ Little maintained an interest in Irish heraldry even after he was promoted from Norroy and Ulster to Clarenceux . After the Director of the National Library of Ireland was made the Chief Herald of Ireland , Brooke @-@ Little wrote to the Daily Telegraph of the importance of maintaining a strong tradition of heraldic and genealogical expertise in the Irish Office of Arms . 
 When Sir Colin Cole retired from the office of Garter king of Arms in 1992 , Brooke @-@ Little was a leading candidate to replace him . This is the highest heraldic office in England ; Garter is chairman of the Chapter of the College of Arms , as well as the King of Arms of the Order of the Garter . Due to his convivial life style , though , Brooke @-@ Little was not well suited to the managerial responsibilities of the office of Garter . Instead , the honour went to Sir Conrad Swan . On 19 June 1995 , Brooke @-@ Little was appointed to the office of Clarenceux King of Arms following the death of Sir Anthony Wagner . This is the senior of the two provincial Kings of Arms and the holder of the office has jurisdiction over England and Wales south of the Trent . The heralds had traditionally been appointed " for life on good behaviour " , but Brooke @-@ Little became Clarenceux shortly after compulsory retirement at age 70 was introduced , and he had to leave after only two years in this post . He ended his heraldic career without ever having attained the office of Garter King of Arms , or being honoured with a knighthood . 
 In addition to his duties as a professional herald , Brooke @-@ Little held three administrative positions at the College of Arms . From 1974 until 1982 , he served as Registrar , with responsibility to enter all new grants and confirmations of arms into the College records . Brooke @-@ Little 's signature can be found on the reverse of the letters patent for every grant made during this period . In addition , he served as the College 's librarian from 1974 until 1994 and the treasurer of the College of Arms from 1978 until 1995 . He was also the director of the Heralds ' Museum at the Tower of London from 1991 to 1997 ; this museum is no longer operating . Although Brooke @-@ Little enjoyed prominence as a professional officer of arms and as an author on heraldic subjects , his role in founding the Heraldry Society , and in guiding the society and editing its journal for many years , was perhaps his greatest contribution to the science of heraldry .

 In 1952 , as John Brooke @-@ Little was entering the world of heraldry as a Gold Staff Officer , he began exploring the origins of his own arms . His family had been using the arms Azure , six <unk> rampant gules , but some research proved that the Brooke @-@ Littles had no right to these arms . John worked to apply for a grant on behalf of his father . When asked for input , his father noted that the lions previously used were improper and that he thought unicorns would be a good replacement . Red <unk> ( droplets ) alluded to the family 's former holding of the Manor of <unk> . The arms were granted to Raymond Brooke @-@ Little on 5 March 1952 . John quartered these arms with those of his mother , Constance Egan . The whole shield of arms is blazoned Quarterly : I and IV , argent , <unk> de sang three unicorns ' heads erased sable armed and crined or langued azure ( Brooke @-@ Little ) ; II and III , azure , two dolphins <unk> and <unk> or , the eyes gules , between four shamrocks slipped or .

 In 1947 , a twenty @-@ year @-@ old Brooke @-@ Little founded the Society of Heraldic Antiquaries , which was renamed the Heraldry Society in 1950 . It was incorporated in 1956 and is now a registered charity . The principal object of the society is to extend interest in and knowledge of heraldry , genealogy , precedence , and related disciplines . Brooke @-@ Little served its chairman for fifty years . In 1997 , as he was ending his career as an officer of arms , he changed roles in the Society to become its president . He served in this role until his death . Brooke @-@ Little also served as the Honorary Editor of the society 's scholarly journal , the Coat of Arms . From the first publication of the journal until the middle of 1965 , his mother , Constance Egan , served as the managing editor of the Coat of Arms , though Brooke @-@ Little always had a guiding influence on the publication . It was not until 2005 that Brooke @-@ Little finally handed complete control of the journal to two young heralds : Peter O <unk> , Bluemantle Pursuivant , and Clive Cheesman , Rouge Dragon Pursuivant . 
 = = = The White Lion Society = = = 
 Brooke @-@ Little was integral to the foundation of the White Lion Society . In 1984 , at a meeting of the Heraldry Society , it was suggested to Brooke @-@ Little , then Norroy and Ulster King of Arms , that it would be appropriate to found a " Society of Friends " of the College of Arms . Brooke @-@ Little explained that the late Wilfrid Scott @-@ Giles , Fitzalan Pursuivant , had previously suggested the same idea , proposing the name of the ' White Lion Society ' after the heraldic supporters of the College of Arms , which are two white lions ( alluding to the supporters of the Mowbray arms which the Earl Marshal inherited from his ancestors ) . Brooke @-@ Little put the idea before the Chapter of the College shortly after and with its approval , the Society came into being in 1986 . 
 = = Honours and appointments = = 
 Brooke @-@ Little garnered many honours and awards during his time of service to the Crown . He was appointed a 4th Class Member of the Royal Victorian Order ( an honour now known as Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order ) in 1969 for his services at the Investiture of the Prince of Wales . This was followed by a promotion to Commander of the Royal Victorian Order at the 1984 New Year Honours Though most Kings of Arms up to that time were knighted , that honour was never given to him . The closest that he came was in 1975 when he was made a Knight of Justice of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem , the British revival of the ancient Knights Hospitaller of Saint John . 
 Brooke @-@ Little was an Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Heraldic and Genealogical Studies and a Chevalier of the Order of the Fleur de Lys . He was Master of the Scriveners ' Company from 1985 until 1986 , Chairman of the Harleian Society , and President of the English Language Literary Trust for eleven years from 1985 until 1996 . His heraldic involvement carried over as a trustee of the Royal Air Force Heraldry Trust and an advisor on heraldry to the National Trust from 1983 until his death . 
 In addition to his honours in Britain , Brooke @-@ Little also served as Chancellor of the British Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta from 1973 to 1977 . He was first admitted to the Order as a Knight of <unk> Grace , and would eventually hold the rank of Knight Grand Cross of Grace and Devotion . He was also honoured with the Order of Merito <unk> in 1964 and was made a Knight Grand Cross of Grace of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George . In addition to these honours , he held the Cruz <unk> ( 1st class ) de San Raimundo de <unk> .

 The Prospect Mountain Veterans Memorial Highway is a parkway located in the town of Lake George , New York . The road is 5 @.@ 88 miles ( 9 @.@ 46 km ) long , starting at the U.S. Route 9 ( US 9 ) and New York State Route 9N ( NY 9N ) concurrency and ending at the peak of Prospect Mountain . Although the road is designated as New York State Route <unk> , an unsigned reference route , by the New York State Department of Transportation , all maintenance on the roadway is performed by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The parkway begins at an intersection with Routes 9 and 9N ( Canada Street ) in the town of Lake George . The parkway passes through a gate , heading up the base of Prospect Mountain . The route is very scenic , with trees on both sides of the road . Route <unk> parallels Birch Ave . , a street in Lake George . Soon after , the parkway passes over Interstate 87 ( I @-@ 87 , named the Adirondack Northway ) . The road expands to several lanes after the Northway , coming to a tollbooth . After the toll booth , the parkway begins to head up the mountain . With large heavy , stabilized rocks on both sides of the road , used as a guard rail to prevent danger ( such as running off of the road ) , the parkway curves around the mountain , intersecting with several specialized scenic overlooks . The road curves around the several peaks of Prospect Mountain , coming to an end at the main peak at 5 @.@ 88 miles ( 9 @.@ 46 km ) , where a 100 @-@ mile ( 161 km ) view can be seen . The furthest that can be seen are the Green Mountains in Vermont and the White Mountains in New Hampshire . 
 = = History = = 
 Prospect Mountain originally had to use an incline railway car to access the house at the top where people could dance and eat . Construction on the railway began in January 1895 and cost $ 120 @,@ 000 total . Construction was finished six months later , with the railway opening on June 15 , 1895 . After failing financially , the railway system ceased operation in 1903 . The area was bought and soon donated to the State of New York . The nearby hiking trail that heads up towards the mountaintop is part of the old railway . 
 In 1932 , the building at the top of the mountain burned down and was replaced by a steel fire tower . For 30 years , people studied what to do with the land , which was owned by the state , and in 1954 , New York Governor Tom Dewey signed legislation to build a highway up the mountain . Twelve years later , in 1966 , then @-@ Governor Nelson Rockefeller made funds available for the highway . The Prospect Mountain Veterans Memorial Highway was opened in 1969 , dedicated to war veterans and providing access to the 2 @,@ 021 @-@ foot ( 616 m ) summit with a 100 @-@ mile ( 161 km ) view at its peak .

 = Gamma @-@ ray burst = 
 Gamma @-@ ray bursts ( GRBs ) are extremely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant galaxies . They are the brightest electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe . Bursts can last from ten milliseconds to several hours . After an initial flash of gamma rays , a longer @-@ lived " afterglow " is usually emitted at longer wavelengths ( X @-@ ray , ultraviolet , optical , infrared , microwave and radio ) . 
 The intense radiation of most observed GRBs is believed to be released during a supernova or hypernova as a rapidly rotating , high @-@ mass star collapses to form a neutron star , quark star , or black hole . A subclass of GRBs ( the " short " bursts ) appear to originate from a different process : the merger of binary neutron stars . The cause of the precursor burst observed in some of these short events may be due to the development of a resonance between the crust and core of such stars as a result of the massive tidal forces experienced in the seconds leading up to their collision , causing the entire crust of the star to shatter . 
 The sources of most GRBs are billions of light years away from Earth , implying that the explosions are both extremely energetic ( a typical burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as the Sun will in its entire 10 @-@ billion @-@ year lifetime ) and extremely rare ( a few per galaxy per million years ) . All observed GRBs have originated from outside the Milky Way galaxy , although a related class of phenomena , soft gamma repeater flares , are associated with <unk> within the Milky Way . It has been hypothesized that a gamma @-@ ray burst in the Milky Way , pointing directly towards the Earth , could cause a mass extinction event . 
 GRBs were first detected in 1967 by the Vela satellites , a series of satellites designed to detect covert nuclear weapons tests . Hundreds of theoretical models were proposed to explain these bursts in the years following their discovery , such as collisions between comets and neutron stars . Little information was available to verify these models until the 1997 detection of the first X @-@ ray and optical afterglows and direct measurement of their redshifts using optical spectroscopy , and thus their distances and energy outputs . These discoveries , and subsequent studies of the galaxies and supernovae associated with the bursts , clarified the distance and luminosity of GRBs . These facts definitively placed them in distant galaxies and also connected long GRBs with the explosion of massive stars , the only possible source for the energy outputs observed . 
 = = History = = 
 Gamma @-@ ray bursts were first observed in the late 1960s by the U.S. Vela satellites , which were built to detect gamma radiation pulses emitted by nuclear weapons tested in space . The United States suspected that the USSR might attempt to conduct secret nuclear tests after signing the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963 . On July 2 , 1967 , at 14 : 19 UTC , the Vela 4 and Vela 3 satellites detected a flash of gamma radiation unlike any known nuclear weapons signature . Uncertain what had happened but not considering the matter particularly urgent , the team at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory , led by Ray <unk> , filed the data away for investigation . As additional Vela satellites were launched with better instruments , the Los Alamos team continued to find inexplicable gamma @-@ ray bursts in their data . By analyzing the different arrival times of the bursts as detected by different satellites , the team was able to determine rough estimates for the sky positions of sixteen bursts and definitively rule out a terrestrial or solar origin . The discovery was declassified and published in 1973 as an Astrophysical Journal article entitled " Observations of Gamma @-@ Ray Bursts of Cosmic Origin " . 
 Many theories were advanced to explain these bursts , most of which posited nearby sources within the Milky Way Galaxy . Little progress was made until the 1991 launch of the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory and its Burst and Transient Source Explorer ( BATSE ) instrument , an extremely sensitive gamma @-@ ray detector . This instrument provided crucial data that showed the distribution of GRBs is isotropic — not biased towards any particular direction in space , such as toward the galactic plane or the galactic center . Because of the flattened shape of the Milky Way Galaxy , if the sources were from within our own galaxy they would be strongly concentrated in or near the galactic plane . The absence of any such pattern in the case of GRBs provided strong evidence that gamma @-@ ray bursts must come from beyond the Milky Way . However , some Milky Way models are still consistent with an isotropic distribution . 
 = = = <unk> objects as candidate sources = = = 
 For decades after the discovery of GRBs , astronomers searched for a counterpart at other wavelengths : i.e. , any astronomical object in positional coincidence with a recently observed burst . Astronomers considered many distinct classes of objects , including white dwarfs , pulsars , supernovae , globular clusters , quasars , Seyfert galaxies , and BL Lac objects . All such searches were unsuccessful , and in a few cases particularly well @-@ localized bursts ( those whose positions were determined with what was then a high degree of accuracy ) could be clearly shown to have no bright objects of any nature consistent with the position derived from the detecting satellites . This suggested an origin of either very faint stars or extremely distant galaxies . Even the most accurate positions contained numerous faint stars and galaxies , and it was widely agreed that final resolution of the origins of cosmic gamma @-@ ray bursts would require both new satellites and faster communication . 
 = = = Afterglow = = = 
 Several models for the origin of gamma @-@ ray bursts postulated that the initial burst of gamma rays should be followed by slowly fading emission at longer wavelengths created by collisions between the burst ejecta and interstellar gas . This fading emission would be called the " afterglow . " Early searches for this afterglow were unsuccessful , largely due to the difficulties in observing a burst 's position at longer wavelengths immediately after the initial burst . The breakthrough came in February 1997 when the satellite BeppoSAX detected a gamma @-@ ray burst ( GRB 970228 ) and when the X @-@ ray camera was pointed towards the direction from which the burst had originated , it detected fading X @-@ ray emission . The William Herschel Telescope identified a fading optical counterpart 20 hours after the burst . Once the GRB faded , deep imaging was able to identify a faint , distant host galaxy at the location of the GRB as pinpointed by the optical afterglow . 
 Because of the very faint luminosity of this galaxy , its exact distance was not measured for several years . Well before then , another major breakthrough occurred with the next event registered by BeppoSAX , GRB 970508 . This event was localized within four hours of its discovery , allowing research teams to begin making observations much sooner than any previous burst . The spectrum of the object revealed a redshift of z = 0 @.@ 835 , placing the burst at a distance of roughly 6 billion light years from Earth . This was the first accurate determination of the distance to a GRB , and together with the discovery of the host galaxy of 970228 proved that GRBs occur in extremely distant galaxies . Within a few months , the controversy about the distance scale ended : GRBs were extragalactic events originating within faint galaxies at enormous distances . The following year , GRB 980425 was followed within a day by a coincident bright supernova ( SN 1998bw ) , indicating a clear connection between GRBs and the deaths of very massive stars . This burst provided the first strong clue about the nature of the systems that produce GRBs . 
 BeppoSAX functioned until 2002 and <unk> ( with BATSE ) was deorbited in 2000 . However , the revolution in the study of gamma @-@ ray bursts motivated the development of a number of additional instruments designed specifically to explore the nature of GRBs , especially in the earliest moments following the explosion . The first such mission , <unk> @-@ 2 , launched in 2000 and functioned until 2006 , providing most of the major discoveries during this period . One of the most successful space missions to date , Swift , was launched in 2004 and as of 2016 is still operational . Swift is equipped with a very sensitive gamma ray detector as well as on @-@ board X @-@ ray and optical telescopes , which can be rapidly and automatically slewed to observe afterglow emission following a burst . More recently , the Fermi mission was launched carrying the Gamma @-@ Ray Burst Monitor , which detects bursts at a rate of several hundred per year , some of which are bright enough to be observed at extremely high energies with Fermi 's Large Area Telescope . Meanwhile , on the ground , numerous optical telescopes have been built or modified to incorporate robotic control software that responds immediately to signals sent through the Gamma @-@ ray Burst Coordinates Network . This allows the telescopes to rapidly <unk> towards a GRB , often within seconds of receiving the signal and while the gamma @-@ ray emission itself is still ongoing . 
 New developments over the past few years include the recognition of short gamma @-@ ray bursts as a separate class ( likely due to merging neutron stars and not associated with supernovae ) , the discovery of extended , erratic flaring activity at X @-@ ray wavelengths lasting for many minutes after most GRBs , and the discovery of the most luminous ( GRB 080319B ) and the former most distant ( GRB <unk> ) objects in the universe . The most distant known GRB , GRB <unk> , is now the most distant known object in the universe . 
 = = Classification = = 
 The light curves of gamma @-@ ray bursts are extremely diverse and complex . No two gamma @-@ ray burst light curves are identical , with large variation observed in almost every property : the duration of observable emission can vary from milliseconds to tens of minutes , there can be a single peak or several individual <unk> , and individual peaks can be symmetric or with fast brightening and very slow fading . Some bursts are preceded by a " precursor " event , a weak burst that is then followed ( after seconds to minutes of no emission at all ) by the much more intense " true " bursting episode . The light curves of some events have extremely chaotic and complicated profiles with almost no discernible patterns . 
 Although some light curves can be roughly reproduced using certain simplified models , little progress has been made in understanding the full diversity observed . Many classification schemes have been proposed , but these are often based solely on differences in the appearance of light curves and may not always reflect a true physical difference in the progenitors of the explosions . However , plots of the distribution of the observed duration for a large number of gamma @-@ ray bursts show a clear <unk> , suggesting the existence of two separate populations : a " short " population with an average duration of about 0 @.@ 3 seconds and a " long " population with an average duration of about 30 seconds . Both distributions are very broad with a significant overlap region in which the identity of a given event is not clear from duration alone . Additional classes beyond this two @-@ tiered system have been proposed on both observational and theoretical grounds . 
 = = = Short gamma @-@ ray bursts = = = 
 Events with a duration of less than about two seconds are classified as short gamma @-@ ray bursts . These account for about 30 % of gamma @-@ ray bursts , but until 2005 , no afterglow had been successfully detected from any short event and little was known about their origins . Since then , several dozen short gamma @-@ ray burst afterglows have been detected and localized , several of which are associated with regions of little or no star formation , such as large elliptical galaxies and the central regions of large galaxy clusters . This rules out a link to massive stars , confirming that short events are physically distinct from long events . In addition , there has been no association with supernovae . 
 The true nature of these objects ( or even whether the current classification scheme is accurate ) remains unknown , although the leading hypothesis is that they originate from the mergers of binary neutron stars or a neutron star with a black hole . Such mergers might also be expected to produce <unk> , and evidence for a <unk> associated with GRB <unk> has been seen . The mean duration of these events of 0 @.@ 2 seconds suggests a source of very small physical diameter in stellar terms ; less than 0 @.@ 2 light @-@ seconds ( about 37 @,@ 000 miles — four times the Earth 's diameter ) . This further suggests a very compact object as the source . The observation of minutes to hours of X @-@ ray flashes after a short gamma @-@ ray burst is consistent with small particles of a primary object like a neutron star initially swallowed by a black hole in less than two seconds , followed by some hours of lesser energy events , as remaining fragments of tidally disrupted neutron star material ( no longer <unk> ) remain in orbit to spiral into the black hole , over a longer period of time . A small fraction of short gamma @-@ ray bursts are probably produced by giant flares from soft gamma repeaters in nearby galaxies . 
 = = = Long gamma @-@ ray bursts = = = 
 Most observed events ( 70 % ) have a duration of greater than two seconds and are classified as long gamma @-@ ray bursts . Because these events constitute the majority of the population and because they tend to have the brightest afterglows , they have been studied in much greater detail than their short counterparts . Almost every well @-@ studied long gamma @-@ ray burst has been linked to a galaxy with rapid star formation , and in many cases to a core @-@ collapse supernova as well , unambiguously associating long GRBs with the deaths of massive stars . Long GRB afterglow observations , at high redshift , are also consistent with the GRB having originated in star @-@ forming regions . 
 = = = Ultra @-@ long gamma @-@ ray bursts = = = 
 These events are at the tail end of the long GRB duration distribution , lasting more than 10 @,@ 000 seconds . They have been proposed to form a separate class , possibly the result of the collapse of a blue supergiant star . Only a small number have been identified to date , their primary characteristic being their gamma ray emission duration . So far , the known and well established ultra long GRBs are GRB <unk> , GRB <unk> , and GRB <unk> . A recent study , on the other hand , shows that the existing evidence for a separate ultra @-@ long GRB population with a new type of progenitor is inconclusive , and further multi @-@ wavelength observations are needed to draw a firmer conclusion . 
 = = Energetics and beaming = = 
 Gamma @-@ ray bursts are very bright as observed from Earth despite their typically immense distances . An average long GRB has a bolometric flux comparable to a bright star of our galaxy despite a distance of billions of light years ( compared to a few tens of light years for most visible stars ) . Most of this energy is released in gamma rays , although some GRBs have extremely luminous optical counterparts as well . GRB 080319B , for example , was accompanied by an optical counterpart that peaked at a visible magnitude of 5 @.@ 8 , comparable to that of the dimmest naked @-@ eye stars despite the burst 's distance of 7 @.@ 5 billion light years . This combination of brightness and distance implies an extremely energetic source . Assuming the gamma @-@ ray explosion to be spherical , the energy output of GRB 080319B would be within a factor of two of the rest @-@ mass energy of the Sun ( the energy which would be released were the Sun to be converted entirely into radiation ) . 
 No known process in the universe can produce this much energy in such a short time . Rather , gamma @-@ ray bursts are thought to be highly focused explosions , with most of the explosion energy collimated into a narrow jet traveling at speeds exceeding 99 @.@ 995 % of the speed of light . The approximate angular width of the jet ( that is , the degree of spread of the beam ) can be estimated directly by observing the achromatic " jet breaks " in afterglow light curves : a time after which the slowly decaying afterglow begins to fade rapidly as the jet slows and can no longer beam its radiation as effectively . Observations suggest significant variation in the jet angle from between 2 and 20 degrees . 
 Because their energy is strongly focused , the gamma rays emitted by most bursts are expected to miss the Earth and never be detected . When a gamma @-@ ray burst is pointed towards Earth , the focusing of its energy along a relatively narrow beam causes the burst to appear much brighter than it would have been were its energy emitted spherically . When this effect is taken into account , typical gamma @-@ ray bursts are observed to have a true energy release of about 1044 J , or about 1 / 2000 of a Solar mass ( M ☉ ) energy equivalent — which is still many times the mass @-@ energy equivalent of the Earth ( about 5 @.@ 5 × 1041 J ) . This is comparable to the energy released in a bright type Ib / c supernova and within the range of theoretical models . Very bright supernovae have been observed to accompany several of the nearest GRBs . Additional support for focusing of the output of GRBs has come from observations of strong asymmetries in the spectra of nearby type Ic supernova and from radio observations taken long after bursts when their jets are no longer relativistic . 
 Short ( time duration ) GRBs appear to come from a lower @-@ redshift ( i.e. less distant ) population and are less luminous than long GRBs . The degree of beaming in short bursts has not been accurately measured , but as a population they are likely less collimated than long GRBs or possibly not collimated at all in some cases . 
 = = Progenitors = = 
 Because of the immense distances of most gamma @-@ ray burst sources from Earth , identification of the progenitors , the systems that produce these explosions , is particularly challenging . The association of some long GRBs with supernovae and the fact that their host galaxies are rapidly star @-@ forming offer very strong evidence that long gamma @-@ ray bursts are associated with massive stars . The most widely accepted mechanism for the origin of long @-@ duration GRBs is the collapsar model , in which the core of an extremely massive , low @-@ metallicity , rapidly rotating star collapses into a black hole in the final stages of its evolution . Matter near the star 's core rains down towards the center and swirls into a high @-@ density accretion disk . The infall of this material into a black hole drives a pair of relativistic jets out along the rotational axis , which pummel through the stellar envelope and eventually break through the stellar surface and radiate as gamma rays . Some alternative models replace the black hole with a newly formed magnetar , although most other aspects of the model ( the collapse of the core of a massive star and the formation of relativistic jets ) are the same . 
 The closest analogs within the Milky Way galaxy of the stars producing long gamma @-@ ray bursts are likely the Wolf – Rayet stars , extremely hot and massive stars which have shed most or all of their hydrogen due to radiation pressure . Eta Carinae and WR 104 have been cited as possible future gamma @-@ ray burst progenitors . It is unclear if any star in the Milky Way has the appropriate characteristics to produce a gamma @-@ ray burst . 
 The massive @-@ star model probably does not explain all types of gamma @-@ ray burst . There is strong evidence that some short @-@ duration gamma @-@ ray bursts occur in systems with no star formation and where no massive stars are present , such as elliptical galaxies and galaxy halos . The favored theory for the origin of most short gamma @-@ ray bursts is the merger of a binary system consisting of two neutron stars . According to this model , the two stars in a binary slowly spiral towards each other due to the release of energy via gravitational radiation until the neutron stars suddenly rip each other apart due to tidal forces and collapse into a single black hole . The infall of matter into the new black hole produces an accretion disk and releases a burst of energy , analogous to the collapsar model . Numerous other models have also been proposed to explain short gamma @-@ ray bursts , including the merger of a neutron star and a black hole , the accretion @-@ induced collapse of a neutron star , or the evaporation of primordial black holes . 
 An alternative explanation proposed by <unk> <unk> is that in the course of a gravitational collapse and in reaching the event horizon of a black hole , all matter disintegrates into a burst of gamma radiation . 
 = = = Tidal disruption events = = = 
 This new class of GRB @-@ like events was first discovered through the detection of GRB <unk> by the Swift Gamma @-@ Ray Burst Mission on 28 March 2011 . This event had a gamma @-@ ray duration of about 2 days , much longer than even ultra @-@ long GRBs , and was detected in X @-@ rays for many months . It occurred at the center of a small elliptical galaxy at redshift z = 0 @.@ <unk> . There is an ongoing debate as to whether the explosion was the result of stellar collapse or a tidal disruption event accompanied by a relativistic jet , although the latter explanation has become widely favoured . 
 A tidal disruption event of this sort is when a star interacts with a supermassive black hole shredding the star , and in some cases creating a relativistic jet which produces bright emission of gamma ray radiation . The event GRB <unk> ( also denoted Swift <unk> + 57 ) was initially argued to be produced by the disruption of main sequence star by a black hole of several million times the mass of the Sun , although it has subsequently been argued that the disruption of a white dwarf by a black hole of mass about 10 thousand times the Sun may be more likely . 
 = = Emission mechanisms = = 
 The means by which gamma @-@ ray bursts convert energy into radiation remains poorly understood , and as of 2010 there was still no generally accepted model for how this process occurs . Any successful model of GRB emission must explain the physical process for generating gamma @-@ ray emission that matches the observed diversity of light curves , spectra , and other characteristics . Particularly challenging is the need to explain the very high efficiencies that are inferred from some explosions : some gamma @-@ ray bursts may convert as much as half ( or more ) of the explosion energy into gamma @-@ rays . Early observations of the bright optical counterparts to GRB <unk> and to GRB 080319B , whose optical light curves were extrapolations of the gamma @-@ ray light spectra , have suggested that inverse Compton may be the dominant process in some events . In this model , pre @-@ existing low @-@ energy photons are scattered by relativistic electrons within the explosion , augmenting their energy by a large factor and transforming them into gamma @-@ rays . 
 The nature of the longer @-@ wavelength afterglow emission ( ranging from X @-@ ray through radio ) that follows gamma @-@ ray bursts is better understood . Any energy released by the explosion not radiated away in the burst itself takes the form of matter or energy moving outward at nearly the speed of light . As this matter collides with the surrounding interstellar gas , it creates a relativistic shock wave that then propagates forward into interstellar space . A second shock wave , the reverse shock , may propagate back into the ejected matter . Extremely energetic electrons within the shock wave are accelerated by strong local magnetic fields and radiate as synchrotron emission across most of the electromagnetic spectrum . This model has generally been successful in modeling the behavior of many observed afterglows at late times ( generally , hours to days after the explosion ) , although there are difficulties explaining all features of the afterglow very shortly after the gamma @-@ ray burst has occurred . 
 = = Rate of occurrence and potential effects on life = = 
 Gamma ray bursts can have harmful or destructive effects on life . Considering the universe as a whole , the safest environments for life similar to that on Earth are the lowest density regions in the outskirts of large galaxies . Our knowledge of galaxy types and their distribution suggests that life as we know it can only exist in about 10 % of all galaxies . Furthermore , galaxies with a redshift of z higher than 0 @.@ 5 are unsuitable for life as we know it , due to their higher rate of GRBs and their stellar compactness . 
 All GRBs observed to date have occurred well outside the Milky Way galaxy and have been harmless to Earth . However , if a GRB were to occur within the Milky Way and its emission were beamed straight towards Earth , the effects could be harmful and potentially devastating for the ecosystems . Currently , orbiting satellites detect on average approximately one GRB per day . The closest observed GRB as of March 2014 was GRB 980425 , located 40 megaparsecs ( 130 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ly ) away ( z = 0 @.@ <unk> ) in a <unk> @-@ type dwarf galaxy . GRB 980425 was far less energetic than the average GRB and was associated with the Type Ib supernova SN 1998bw . 
 Estimating the exact rate at which GRBs occur is difficult , but for a galaxy of approximately the same size as the Milky Way the expected rate ( for long @-@ duration GRBs ) is about one burst every 100 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 years . Only a small percentage of these would be beamed towards Earth . Estimates of rate of occurrence of short @-@ duration GRBs are even more uncertain because of the unknown degree of collimation , but are probably comparable . 
 Since GRBs are thought to involve beamed emission along two jets in opposing directions , only planets in the path of these jets would be subjected to the high energy gamma radiation . 
 Although nearby GRBs hitting Earth with a destructive shower of gamma rays are only hypothetical events , high energy processes in the nearby universe are well @-@ known to affect the Earth 's atmosphere . 
 = = = Effects on Earth = = = 
 Earth 's atmosphere is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x @-@ rays and gamma rays , so these types of radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself . The immediate effect on life on Earth from a GRB within a few parsecs would only be a short increase in ultraviolet radiation at ground level , lasting from less than a second to tens of seconds . This ultraviolet radiation could potentially reach dangerous levels depending on the exact nature and distance of the burst , but it seems unlikely to be able to cause a global catastrophe for life on Earth . 
 The long term effects from a nearby burst are more dangerous . Gamma rays cause chemical reactions in the atmosphere involving oxygen and nitrogen molecules , creating first nitrogen oxide then nitrogen dioxide gas . The nitrogen oxides cause dangerous effects on three levels . First , they deplete ozone , with models showing a possible global reduction of 25 @-@ 35 % , with as much as 75 % in certain locations , an effect that would last for years . This reduction is enough to cause a dangerously elevated UV index at the surface . Secondly , the nitrogen oxides cause photochemical smog , which darkens the sky and blocks out parts of the sunlight spectrum . This would affect photosynthesis , but models show only about a 1 % reduction of the total sunlight spectrum , lasting a few years . However , the smog could potentially cause a cooling effect on Earth 's climate , producing a " cosmic winter " ( similar to an impact winter , but without an impact ) , but only if it occurs simultaneously with a global climate instability . Thirdly , the elevated nitrogen levels in the atmosphere would wash out and produce nitric acid rain . This substance is toxic to a variety of organisms , including amphibian life , but models show that it cannot reach levels that would cause a serious global effect . The nitrates might in fact be of benefit to some plants . 
 All in all , a GRB within a few parsecs , with its energy directed towards Earth , will mostly damage life by raising the UV levels . Models shows that the destructive effects of this increase can cause up to 16 times the normal levels of DNA damage . It has proved difficult to assess a reliable evaluation of the consequences of this on the terrestrial ecosystem , because of the uncertainty in biological field and laboratory data . 
 Ordinary supernova explosions can have the same effects as GRBs on Earth 's atmosphere because they are more frequent events with a possibility of occurring closer to Earth . The rate and distribution of supernovas are used to define what is known as the Galactic Habitable Zone in the field of astrobiology . 
 = = = = Hypothetical effects on Earth in the past = = = = 
 GRBs close enough to affect life in some way might occur once every five million years or so – around a thousand times since life on Earth began . 
 The major Ordovician – Silurian extinction events 450 million years ago may have been caused by a GRB . The late Ordovician species of trilobite that spent some of its life in the plankton layer near the ocean surface was much harder hit than deep @-@ water dwellers , which tended to remain within quite restricted areas . Usually it is the more widely spread species that fare better in extinction , hence this unusual pattern could be explained by a GRB . This would probably devastate creatures living on land and near the ocean surface , but leave deep @-@ sea creatures relatively unharmed . 
 A case has been made that the 774 – 775 carbon @-@ 14 spike was the result of a short GRB , though a very strong solar flare is another possibility . 
 = = = WR 104 : A nearby GRB candidate = = = 
 A Wolf – Rayet star in WR 104 , about 8 @,@ 000 light @-@ years ( 2 @,@ 500 pc ) away , is considered a nearby GRB candidate that could have destructive effects on terrestrial life . It is expected to explode in a core @-@ collapse @-@ supernova at some point within the next 500 @,@ 000 years and there is a chance that this explosion will create a GRB . If that happens , there is a small chance that Earth will be in the path of its gamma ray jet .

 An emigrant from his native Belgium , he arrived in the New York area in 1897 and dabbled in several technical fields before hitting upon instant coffee manufacture during a sojourn in Central America in 1906 or 1907 . He began selling his coffee in 1909 and founded a company to manufacture it in 1910 . Based in New York and New Jersey , his company prospered and became an important military supplier during World War I. The company 's products were also advertised in New York newspapers and on the radio . The success of his company made Washington wealthy , and he lived in a mansion in Brooklyn and then moved to a country estate in New Jersey in 1927 . In that same year , he lost a dispute with the tax authorities . Washington was married and had three children . 
 Washington 's company was sold to American Home Products in 1943 , shortly before his death . Though the coffee brand was discontinued by 1961 , Washington 's name is still used today in the product G. Washington 's Seasoning & Broth . 
 = = Early life = = 
 George Washington was born in Kortrijk , Belgium to Jean Guillaume Washington ( John William Washington ) of England and Marie Louise Tant of Belgium , on May 20 , 1871 . Following then @-@ current nationality law , which considered fatherhood primary , Washington was a British subject until he was naturalized as an American in May 1918 . At least six siblings in the family also settled in different parts of the United States and Central America . A number of accounts claim a relation to U.S. President George Washington , but this is not clearly explained . 
 Washington came to reside in Brussels and also attained a degree in chemistry at the University of Bonn in Germany . In December 1895 , Washington married Angeline Céline Virginie ( later , just " Lina " ) Van <unk> ( born 1876 ) , also from Belgium . The US Census of 1900 records that Lina , like her husband , had English and Belgian ancestry ( a Belgian father and an English mother ) . The Washingtons ' arrival in the United States on a ship from Antwerp , Belgium , on October 6 , 1896 , was recorded at Ellis Island , though the 1900 US Census states that they emigrated to the United States in 1897 . The Washingtons settled in the New York area , where they had three children : Louisa Washington ( born May 1897 ) , Irene Washington ( born May 1898 ) , and George Washington Jr . ( born August 1899 ) . 
 After arriving in the New York area , Washington founded a company producing kerosene gas mantles . At this time , they lived in New Brighton on Staten Island , but his company , George Washington Lighting Company , was based in nearby Jersey City . This business was abandoned with the maturation of incandescent light bulb technology . Washington also had a camera company for a time . By the time of the 1900 US Census , Washington , recorded in the census as an inventor , was 29 years old and living in a rented house in Brooklyn with his 23 @-@ year @-@ old wife , their three young children , his younger sister ( age 25 ) , three servants , and a child of two of the servants . 
 Washington tried his hand at cattle ranching in Guatemala in 1906 or 1907 while , in the meantime , developed his instant coffee process . Washington returned to New York City after only a period of about a year in Guatemala , and then began pursuing the main part of his career in coffee manufacture . His father remained in Guatemala and died there in 1912 . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 After his coffee business was established in 1910 , Washington resided at a Park Slope mansion , occupying half of a city block , at 47 Prospect Park West in Brooklyn , and also at an 18 @-@ bedroom country home , later known as " Washington Lodge " , on a 40 @-@ acre waterfront estate at 287 South Country Road at Bellport in Suffolk County , which included the largest concrete swimming pool in New York at the time . Washington sold these homes in 1926 – 1927 ( for a price reportedly exceeding $ 1 million ) to a group of wealthy Brooklyn men intent on founding a " Park and Shore Club " for their membership at both properties . This was short @-@ lived , however , as the Park Slope mansion , following a neighborhood trend , was replaced by a six @-@ story apartment building at 44 Prospect Park West , and the Bellport estate was for most of its history used by local Catholic Marist Brothers as a summer retreat , before recent conservation projects on modern divisions of the former property by local nonprofits and Bellport resident Isabella Rossellini ; the " Washington Lodge " building there still stands , though its future use is uncertain . 
 With his company 's relocation to New Jersey , following the purchase of land there in 1927 , he moved to the former estate of Governor Franklin Murphy at " Franklin Farms " in Mendham . Washington was a lover of exotic animals , as well as gardening . He maintained extensive menageries on his country properties , first at Bellport , and later at Mendham . On Long Island , it is reported that he was often seen with a bird or monkey on his shoulder . At both his menageries , Washington specialized in rare birds , but such animals as deer , sheep , goats , and antelope are also recorded at Bellport , and deer , llamas , and zebras are recorded among the hundreds of animals in the larger space at Mendham . Socially , he was an active member of the <unk> Club , a literary gentlemen 's club in New York City . 
 Washington 's name was briefly put forward for the 1920 presidential election in South Dakota 's preference primary for the " American Party " , although papers were filed too late to be valid . There is no indication , however , that the nomination was serious . George Washington would not have been eligible for that office , in any case , as he was foreign @-@ born . There have been several " American Party " s in history — it is unclear if the nomination was a particular satire on any so @-@ named movement at the time . 
 That 's the fellow . He has put one over on us . He has a barrel of money — enough to run a <unk> campaign . Why , don 't you remember , he just bought that $ 100 @,@ 000 mansion from Albert <unk> on Prospect Park West . He 's learned a lot about politics by being a neighbor of Senator Calder and George Hamlin Childs . And when you come to think of it , that American Party stuff is good campaign dope this year , what with all the Bolsheviki and the Government after the Reds and the row about the League of Nations , and all that . We 've been overlooking something for sure . 
 = = Invention and business = = 
 George Washington held over two dozen patents , in the fields of hydrocarbon lamps , cameras , and food processing . He was not the first to invent an instant coffee process , David Strang in New Zealand had the first patent in 1890 ( Number <unk> ) for instant or soluble coffee and was sold under the name <unk> Coffee , another was chemist Satori Kato 's work was a precursor , among others , but Washington 's invention was the first effort that led to large scale commercial manufacture . There is some suggestion that he was inspired by seeing dried powder on the edge of a silver coffee pot while in Guatemala . Federico <unk> Wyld , a German @-@ Guatemalan doctor , along with Eduardo T. Cabarrus , also developed an instant coffee process about this time , which he later marketed in Europe ; as Wyld was Washington 's personal physician , there is some suggestion that their discoveries were not independent . 
 Washington 's product was first marketed as Red E Coffee ( a pun on " ready " ) in 1909 , and the G. Washington Coffee Refining Company was founded in 1910 . Washington 's first production plant was at 147 41st Street in Brooklyn 's Bush Terminal industrial complex . The company later moved operations to New Jersey , acquiring the land for the new plant at 45 East Hanover Avenue in Morris Plains in 1927 . 
 Advertising for the company 's product often emphasized its supposed convenience , modernity , and purity . It was claimed to be better for digestion , and even that the " pure " coffee did not have the wakefulness effect of coffee from ground beans ( a direct effect of caffeine content , present in both forms ) . After World War I ended , the American military 's use of the coffee became another selling point . A different avenue for promotion came when the company sponsored The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes radio series on NBC and its Blue Network from 1930 to 1935 , which started with Dr. Watson welcoming listeners to his recollections told by " a blazing fire and a cup of G Washington brewing " . Other radio sponsorships were for O 'Henry Stories ( 1932 , NBC Blue ) , Professor Quiz ( 1936 , CBS ) , Uncle Jim 's Question Bee ( 1936 – 39 , NBC Blue ) , and Surprise Party ( 1946 – 47 , CBS ) . 
 But the early instant coffee was also often considered of poor quality , of disagreeable taste , and little more than a novelty product . 
 Washington experienced some tax trouble with federal authorities , concerning the financial relationship between himself and his company . In November 1918 , he contracted with the company for the use of his trade secrets in the manufacture of the coffee , and a month later gave a four @-@ fifths stake in this to his immediate family . The Washingtons insisted that taxes needn 't be paid on the family members ' income , and the case went first to the Board of Tax Appeals , and then to the Court of Appeals , which in 1927 ruled against the Washingtons by a two @-@ to @-@ one decision . A petition to the Supreme Court was not accepted . 
 Washington 's son , George Washington , Jr . , served for a time as treasurer of his father 's company , and , like his father , dabbled in invention , patenting a widely used photoengraving process for newspapers that was introduced by Fairchild Camera and Instrument in 1948 . 
 = = Military contracts = = 
 Washington 's at @-@ that @-@ time unique product saw major use as combat rations in World War I. Coffee consumption on the battlefield was seen as valuable since it gave soldiers a caffeine boost . E.F. Holbrook , the head of the coffee section of the U.S. War Department at the time , also considered it an important aid in recovery from mustard gas . It was employed by the Canadian Expeditionary Force from 1914 until the American Expeditionary Force entered the war in 1917 , and all production was shifted toward American military use . New , smaller producers also sprung up to meet the incredible level of demand from the Army , which in the final period of the war was six times the national supply . 
 The instant coffee achieved some popularity with the soldiers , who nicknamed it a " cup of George " . As the prime attraction was the caffeine boost , rather than the flavor , it was sometimes drunk cold . 
 American emergency rations in World War I consisted of a quarter ounce ( 7 grams ) packet of double @-@ strength instant coffee , packed one per man in containers with multiple types of foods meant for twenty @-@ four men . Instant coffee was also used in reserve rations and trench rations . During World War II , the U.S. military again relied on Washington , but this time on an equal footing with the other major instant coffee brands that had emerged in the interwar period , most notably Nescafé , as well as the new companies formed to meet a renewed military demand .

 G. Washington Coffee Refining Company was purchased by American Home Products in 1943 , and George Washington retired . The purchase of the company , which was mostly held by the family , was in exchange for 29 @,@ 860 shares ( approx . $ 1 @.@ 7 million ) of American Home Products stock , at a time when American Home Products was in a period of intense buying , purchasing 34 companies in eight years . Clarence Mark , general manager of G. Washington , succeeded Washington in running the merged unit . 
 In Washington 's final years , he sold the " Franklin Farms " property , and lived in a home on New Vernon Road in Mendham . 
 He died three years after his company was sold , on March 29 , 1946 in Mendham , New Jersey , after an illness , at the age of 74 . His funeral was held three days later .

 G. Washington coffee was discontinued as a brand by 1961 , when Washington 's New Jersey plant was sold to Tenco , by then a division of The Coca @-@ Cola Company . The last remnant of the brand survives in G. Washington 's Seasoning & Broth , a sideline developed in 1938 . This brand was sold by American Home Products in 2000 , and , after passing through a couple of intermediaries , has been run by <unk> Farm , Ltd. since 2001 .

 " Every Man for Himself " is the fourth episode of the third season of Lost , making it the 53rd episode of the series . It aired on October 25 , 2006 , on ABC , and was written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and directed by Stephen Williams . The character of Sawyer ( Josh Holloway ) is featured in the episode 's flashbacks ; on the island , his rebellious attitude causes Ben Linus ( Michael Emerson ) and the Others to conjure a plan to keep him in check . 
 The episode was intended to show how Ben was a character that could manipulate even the best confidence man on the island , and if Sawyer could care for another person , as Kate Austen ( Evangeline Lilly ) is making her attempts to escape captivity . When the episode first aired , it was watched by 17 @.@ 087 million American viewers . Reviews were positive , praising the writing and the cliffhanger ending .

 Sawyer is in prison , trying to befriend Munson ( Ian Gomez ) , a man who has hidden ten million dollars . He warns Munson that the warden ( Bill Duke ) is trying to con him out of his money . Eventually , Munson , worried that his wife will find where he has hidden the money , enlists Sawyer 's help in moving the stash . Sawyer then reveals this information to the warden , in exchange for a reduced sentence and a part of the money , which he puts in a bank account for Clementine Phillips , a baby that previous con victim Cassidy Phillips ( Kim Dickens ) has told him is his daughter . The warden sarcastically congratulates Sawyer on lying and cheating his way out of prison .

 As Kate Austen ( Evangeline Lilly ) and Sawyer watch , the Others carry a critically injured Colleen ( Paula Malcomson ) , who was shot by Sun @-@ Hwa Kwon ( Yunjin Kim ) the night before . Sawyer realizes that the injury was inflicted by someone back at camp , and then devises a plan to break out from the cage ; he intends to electrocute an off @-@ guard Danny Pickett ( Michael Bowen ) using a puddle he created outside his cage . However , Ben Linus ( Michael Emerson ) overhears him via surveillance and switches off the electricity prior to visiting him . When Sawyer attempts to carry out his plan , Ben knocks him unconscious and has him carried into the Hydra station . 
 Sawyer wakes up to find himself strapped to a table , where Ben , Tom ( M. C. Gainey ) and two other Others watch over him . Sawyer is gagged before inserting a large hypodermic needle into his chest . When Sawyer awakens , Ben enters , carrying a rabbit in a cage ; he shakes the cage vigorously , causing the rabbit to suddenly collapse , presumably dead . Ben informs Sawyer that they fitted him , like the rabbit , with a modified pacemaker ; should his heart rate reach 140 , his heart would explode . Ben threatens to implant one in Kate if Sawyer should tell her of his ordeal . 
 Meanwhile , Juliet Burke ( Elizabeth Mitchell ) begs Jack Shephard ( Matthew Fox ) to help operate on Colleen . Upon arriving at the operating theatre , Jack notices some x @-@ rays , but Juliet informs him that they are not Colleen 's . During the surgery , Jack tries to save Colleen , but she eventually dies . Later , Jack informs Juliet that there was nothing they could do with Colleen , and then asks about the x @-@ rays , which Jack knows belong to a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man with a spinal tumor , and asks who he is there to save . 
 Danny , aware that the Oceanic Flight 815 survivors are responsible , takes his anger out on Sawyer by violently beating him ; Sawyer refrains from fighting back . Kate pleads with him to stop ; Danny ceases only after Kate admits to loving Sawyer . Afterwards , Kate notices a gap in her cage , and manages to climb through . She tries to free Sawyer , but he bitterly refuses , remembering Karl 's escape and bloody capture . Kate returns to her cage , insisting that she would not abandon him , and tells Sawyer that she lied about loving him so that Danny would stop . 
 The next day , Ben takes Sawyer for a walk to high ground . Sawyer learns that he has no pacemaker ; it was merely a con to prevent Sawyer from leaving , and Ben shows him the same rabbit from the day before , which had been merely sedated . Ben reveals to Sawyer that they are on a completely different island approximately twice the size of Alcatraz that overlooks the main island ; escape is impossible . Upon asking why he was conned , Ben tells Sawyer that in order to gain a con artist 's respect , they must be conned themselves .

 Desmond Hume ( Henry Ian Cusick ) offers to fix Claire Littleton 's ( Emilie de Ravin ) roof , but takes it back after Charlie Pace ( Dominic Monaghan ) offers to do this himself . Desmond then uses one of Paulo 's ( Rodrigo Santoro ) golf clubs to build a lightning rod next to Claire 's hut . As a storm brews , waking up Aaron , then lightning strikes the golf club instead of Claire 's hut , Hugo " Hurley " Reyes ( Jorge Garcia ) looks on in amazement , as , again , Desmond seemed to have had a glimpse of the future .

 Leading up to the episode 's broadcast , showrunner Damon Lindelof asked in an interview , " Until now , Sawyer 's been the No. 1 con man on the island . What happens when he meets his match ? " Fellow showrunner Carlton Cuse added " Is he willing to put himself out there emotionally for another human being ? " . Evangeline Lilly described the scene where Kate declines to escape as a major moment to the character , saying that " due to this hillbilly she 's capable of returning to her cage . " Josh Holloway agreed , declaring that the episode revealed to Sawyer that " not everyone is evil " . The flashbacks were shot in an actual penitentiary , the Halawa Correctional Facility , which had been previously used for the prison where Desmond was incarcerated in " Live Together , Die Alone " . While some of the interns were portrayed by extras with soy ink tattoos , bikers with actual body paint were also used . 
 Referring to the scene in which Ben seemingly fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker , Michael Emerson comments 
 Sadistic may be the word , but he doesn 't seem to take much relish in it . He 's just sort of detached , he looks at it coldly . I sometimes feel like everything to him is a sort of scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course . I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is , that his parents were people of science . 
 He also described the events as a demonstration that " Ben has more cards than you think ; ... he 's a step or two ahead , one layer or two deeper than anyone else who is playing the game " . The rabbit was a reference to Stephen King 's On Writing , where King uses a rabbit in a cage with the number 8 written on its back as an example for the connection between reader and writer . Emerson said that part of the appeal of the scene was that " bunnies look so innocent , and the audience feels so tenderly about them you can feel nothing but beastly being mean to them " . But Emerson added the rabbit in the scene had problems reacting to his attempts to scare him – " it was unfazed , it barely blinked " . When asked in an interview whether she got sick of shooting on the Hydra holding cell set , Elizabeth Mitchell responded 
 I guess so . It was creepy because it was supposed to be underwater , so it was a little bit dingy but kind of great at the same time ... what I will miss is just being one on one with another actor . And then also one on two obviously when it was Michael [ Emerson ] because the three of us , it was almost like being on stage . We were able to really work off of each other and I thought you don 't usually get that in a TV show .

 IGN 's Chris Carabott said that " now that Lost has finally wrapped up most of the loose ends from season two , the episode can shift focus to this season 's mysteries . " He also felt the episode " offers a healthy mix of plot and character development with a fair share of revelations thrown in for good measure . " Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly declared herself " sold on the adrenaline @-@ rush direction the show has taken " , with praise to the flashbacks and the cliffhanger involving the reveal of the second island . Lost critic Andrew Dignan described " Every Man for Himself " as " quite the exhilarating episode , packing in enough thrills to make the 42 @-@ minutes fly by " in Slant Magazine . Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it considered " watching the con man get conned was brutally satisfying " , saying that Sawyer " [ ran ] the whole gamut of emotions " , and felt Colleen 's death and the reveal of Ben 's tumor " were good things , as people were already impatient by the glacial @-@ like pace of Season 3 . " Writing for AOL TV , Jonathan Toomey considered " Every Man for Himself " as " an interesting episode " which set up many new elements , and while Toomey called the flashback " a little dry and 100 % predictable " , he liked how it related to the other events in the story " right up to the title " . Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com praised the episode for returning to the mythology , as he considered the previous episode lacked " the slack @-@ jawed wonder I 'm so accustomed to experiencing with this show " . 
 IGN ranked " Every Man for Himself " 70th out of the 115 Lost episodes , saying that it " offered plenty of food for thought . " On the other hand , a similar list by Los Angeles Times ranked the episode as the tenth worst of the series , describing it as the " only outright stinker " of early season 3 . Michael Emerson and Josh Holloway submitted this episode for consideration on their own behalf respectively in the category of " Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series " at the 2007 Emmy Awards , but neither was nominated .

 Paxata refers to its suite of cloud @-@ based data quality , integration , enrichment and governance products as " Adaptive Data Preparation . " The software is intended for business analysts , who need to combine data from a variety of sources , then check the data for duplicates , empty fields , outliers , trends and integrity issues before conducting analysis or visualization in a third @-@ party software tool . It uses algorithms and machine @-@ learning to automate certain aspects of data preparation . For example , it may automatically detect records belonging to the same person or address , even if the information is formatted differently in each record in different data sets . 
 The software has a spreadsheet @-@ based user interface . Patterns and anomalies in the data are color @-@ coded in the spreadsheet . Then users are provided with instructions on how to resolve data quality issues or to supplement the data with contextual information . Data sets and related quality issues can also be addressed in a collaborative environment through the " Paxata Share " feature . It runs on Apache Spark . 
 According to analyst firm <unk> , the software is made possible through advances in predictive analytics , machine learning and the <unk> data caching methodology . The software uses semantic algorithms to understand the meaning of a data table 's columns and pattern recognition algorithms to find potential duplicates in a data @-@ set . It also uses indexing , text pattern recognition and other technologies traditionally found in social media and search software . One of the software 's users is dairy producer <unk> , which uses the software so that business staff can create their own reports on merchandising , supply chain and product data , without the IT department .

Gartner also said Paxata was recognized in the report due to its automated , algorithm @-@ based features and how it tracks any changes made to the data . 
 Ventana Research said Paxata was in a " noisy marketplace " . According to Gartner , while Paxata is an early entrant into the market , many startups and large corporations are making investments in developing similar competing products . According to <unk> and IT Business Edge , one way Paxata differs is that it automatically merges multiple data @-@ sets into a single table , so it can be easily imported into a visualization or analysis tool . 
 Gartner said Paxata will have a difficult time finding a compelling pricing model , when many data discovery tools that it supplements provide some similar features . In contrast , Ventana said Paxata 's pricing was " a pretty small amount " compared to the amount of time users can save . 
 = Pulveroboletus bembae = 
 Pulveroboletus bembae is a species of fungus in the Boletaceae family that was first described in 2009 . It is known only from the rainforest of northern Gabon , a region known for its high level of species diversity . Like all boletes , P. bembae has fleshy fruit bodies that form spores in tubes perpendicular to the ground on the underside of the cap . These yellowish tubes form a surface of pores , each about 1 – 2 mm in diameter . The brownish caps may reach up to 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) wide , and rest atop pale brown stems up to 5 @.@ 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) long . The stems have a woolly , whitish yellow ring of tissue that is short @-@ lived , and may be absent in older specimens . The spores of P. bembae are spindle- or fuse @-@ shaped , and have rough surfaces — a detail observable when viewed with scanning electron microscopy . The fungus grows in a mycorrhizal relationship with Gilbertiodendron dewevrei , the dominant tree species of the <unk> @-@ Congolian rainforest . Other similar Pulveroboletus species in the area include P. annulus and P. croceus , which may be differentiated from P. bembae by a combination of macro- and microscopic characteristics . 
 = = Discovery and classification = = 
 The specimens of Pulveroboletus bembae upon which the species description is based were collected in April , 2008 from three locations in Gabon : in Ogooue @-@ <unk> Province at the <unk> @-@ <unk> Research Station ; in the <unk> National Park near <unk> , and in <unk> , both locations in the northerly province of Woleu @-@ Ntem . Until the report of this species and the related Pulveroboletus <unk> , 12 species of Pulveroboletus had been reported in tropical Africa . According to <unk> & De Kesel , who described the species in a 2009 publication , P. bembae belongs to the section Pulveroboletus of the genus Pulveroboletus . This section , defined by Singer in 1947 , is characterized by the presence of a <unk> @-@ arachnoid veil ( covered with fine , powdery wax granules and cobwebby ) and fruit bodies that are sulphur @-@ yellow , greenish , or yellowish @-@ brown in color . 
 The specific epithet is derived from the word <unk> , a name used by the Baka people for the tree Gilbertiodendron dewevrei that is associated with the fungus . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap is initially convex — sometimes with a small rounded elevation in the center — and flattens out in maturity . It reaches 30 – 35 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 4 in ) in diameter , and the color is almost uniformly rust @-@ brown to reddish brown , although young specimens have a slightly paler margin ( edge ) . The cap surface is dry and dull , but develops a sheen with age . In older specimens , the texture of the margins is described as <unk> — a condition in which a surface is cracked , but the cracks do not intersect one another to form a network and mark out areas . The cap cuticle extends slightly over the edge of the cap and curves downward , and is partly covered with remnants of the universal veil . The flesh at the center of the cap is less than about 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 20 in ) thick , and gradually becomes very thin towards the margin . It is cream @-@ colored to pale yellow with pale reddish @-@ brown to light brown shades under the cuticle and down the stem . 
 The yellowish tubes on the underside of the cap are slightly swollen on one side , slightly depressed around the area of attachment to the stem . They are fused to the stem , in an adnate attachment ; rarely , some tubes will have a decurrent " tooth " ( tissue that runs slightly down the length of the stem ) that is less than 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 20 in ) long . The pores formed by the tube ends are angular to round , and are more elongated near the stem . Their diameters are typically less than 1 – 2 mm in diameter , and are they are the same color as the tubes , or slightly greener . The stem is 37 – 55 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 – 2 @.@ 2 in ) by 4 – 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 16 – 0 @.@ 20 in ) thick , cylindrical , with a narrow base measuring 2 – 4 mm , and sometimes attached to yellow mycelia . It is solid , but as it ages it becomes stuffed ( as if filled with cotton ) and eventually almost completely hollow . The stem surface is dull , dry , pale brown , and entirely covered with tiny brown to reddish brown squamules ( small scales ) . The flesh of the stem is cream @-@ colored , streaked with pale reddish brown to light brown from the upper third towards the base , while the base is light brown . The ring is located on either the stem or the margin of the cap . This woolly , whitish yellow ring of tissue is fragile and short @-@ lived , and has usually weathered away in older specimens . The odor of the mushroom is described as " mildly fungoid to earthy " , and the taste " mildly fungoid " . 
 = = = Microscopic characteristics = = = 
 The color of the spore print is unknown . The spores are somewhat spindle @-@ shaped , boletoid ( long , lean , and fuse @-@ shaped ) , with a pronounced suprahilar depression ( a surface indentation formed where the spore was attached to the spore @-@ bearing cells , the basidia ) , and typically measure 9 @.@ 3 – 11 @.@ 3 by 3 @.@ 9 – 4 @.@ 7 µm . They are weakly pigmented , and their rough surfaces can be seen under scanning electron microscopy . The spores are inamyloid , meaning they will not absorb iodine stain from Melzer 's reagent . The basidia are 26 @.@ 9 – 39 @.@ 3 by 9 @.@ 0 – 12 @.@ 0 µm , cylindrical to narrowly club @-@ shaped , hyaline ( translucent ) , and have four sterigmata ( extensions that attach the spores ) . The pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the gill face ) are 57 @.@ 4 – 92 @.@ 6 by 9 @.@ 4 – 17 @.@ 4 µm , spindle @-@ shaped , moderately frequent , and extend beyond the surface of the hymenium . They have thin , hyaline walls , and are colored the same as the hymenium , without any crystals or encrustations . The cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edge ) , which measure 50 @.@ 6 – 75 @.@ 1 by 12 @.@ 2 – 16 @.@ 1 µm , are more abundant than the cheilocystidia , but otherwise share the same characteristics . The cap cuticle is made of a thin <unk> @-@ <unk> — a type of tissue where the ends of the hyphae reach the same length and form a palisade of cells ; these short anticlinal hyphae are 20 – 40 by 5 – 8 µm , and support one or two inflated , brownish , spherical to spheropedunculate ( somewhat spherical with a stem ) terminal elements that are 25 – 45 µm wide , non @-@ amyloid , thin @-@ walled , and do not have any encrustations . The cuticle of the stem is made of smooth parallel hyphae . The squamules on the cap surface have a <unk> @-@ <unk> arrangement made of short anticlinal hyphae that support elongated inflated elements of 15 – 30 by 10 – 15 µm and some scattered basidia . The flesh is made of hyaline , thin @-@ walled hyphae , measuring 10 – 15 µm wide , and organized in a parallel fashion . These hyphae do not have an associated <unk> — a central strand of parallel hyphae from which other hyphae diverge sideways . Clamp connections are absent in the hyphae of P. bembae . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Although the fruit bodies of P. bembae are roughly similar to those in Xerocomus , species in this genus do not have the powdery veil characteristic of P. bembae . Two similar species in the same area include P. annulus and P. croceus , described in 1951 by Belgian mycologist Paul Heinemann , based on specimens collected in the Congo . Although the identity of these two species is not fully clarified because of insufficient collections , P. bembae differs from both in its larger cystidia , its cream @-@ colored flesh with pale reddish @-@ brown to light brown tones under the cap cuticle ( compared to white in P. annulus and P. croceus ) , its yellow mycelium ( white in P. annulus and P. croceus ) , and differences in ecology . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 The species has been found growing in small groups in the <unk> @-@ Congolian rainforest . This forest is dominated by the single canopy tree species Gilbertiodendron dewevrei . Not only does this tree provide food in the form of edible seeds for a wide variety of large mammals , it forms mycorrhizal relationships with P. bembae . This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of the plant , enabling the fungus to receive moisture , protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree , and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients . The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis is thought to contribute to the success of the dominant species , by allowing it access to nutrients otherwise unavailable . The Congolian forests encompass an ecoregion known for its species richness and endemism , which is spread across four countries : Cameroon , Gabon , Republic of Congo , and the Central African Republic . 
 = Sir George Collier , 1st Baronet = 
 Sir George Ralph Collier , 1st Baronet KCB ( 1774 – 24 March 1824 ) was an officer of the Royal Navy during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars , and the War of 1812 . He had an eventful early life , being shipwrecked early in his career and later captured by the French . Nevertheless , he saw enough service to attract the attention of powerful patrons that secured his rise through the ranks . An officer of considerable ability , he won a noteworthy victory against a stronger French opponent , before embarking on a period of distinguished service off the Spanish and Portuguese coasts , working closely with the British generals fighting the Peninsular War , and markedly contributing to their success . His good service led to a prime posting in command of a squadron despatched to hunt down and neutralise the American super frigates during the War of 1812 . He came close to capturing the USS Constitution , but lost her in circumstances that were unclear and would later return to haunt him . The years of peace that followed the end of the Napoleonic Wars saw him rewarded with a baronetcy , and his continued to serve in the navy where he was tasked with the suppression of the slave trade . The publishing of William James 's account of the War of 1812 , which lambasted him for incompetence and cowardice in his failure to catch the Constitution , broke his personal peace . Having failed to clear his name , and increasingly depressed by the accusations , Collier took his own life . 
 = = Family and early life = = 
 Collier was born in London in 1774 , the second son of the chief clerk of the Victualling Board Ralph Collier , and his wife Henrietta Maria . He began his education at the Chelsea Maritime Academy , but by January 1784 his name appeared in the books of the 74 @-@ gun third rate HMS Triumph as a captain 's servant to the Triumph 's commander , Captain Robert Faulknor . This was likely to have been only a nominal entry to gain seniority , and Collier 's naval service probably actually began three years later in January 1787 , when he joined the 28 @-@ gun frigate HMS Carysfort at the rank of midshipman . He moved in June 1790 to take up a position aboard Captain Edward Pellew 's 50 @-@ gun HMS Salisbury and spent the rest of that year serving on the Newfoundland station . Collier transferred again in December 1790 , joining the 100 @-@ gun first rate HMS Victory , then under Captain John Knight in the English Channel . 
 Collier 's next ship was Captain Samuel Hood 's 32 @-@ gun HMS Juno , which he joined in March 1791 . He remained with the Juno until she was paid off . On being discharged he took passage aboard the East Indiaman Winchelsea , bound for the East India station . The Winchelsea ran onto a reef in the Mozambique Channel on 3 September 1792 and was wrecked . Collier and the other survivors were able to reach Madagascar , where they remained until being picked up a Portuguese brig in May the following year . Before they could reach friendly soil the Portuguese ship was captured by a French privateer and Collier and his fellow survivors were sent to Île de France as prisoners . He remained in captivity there until being released in late 1794 , whereupon he sailed to the British @-@ held port of Madras . 
 = = French Revolutionary Wars = = 
 By now the French Revolutionary Wars had broken out , and after a period spent recuperating from his several ordeals , Collier joined Commodore Peter Rainier 's flagship HMS Suffolk in June 1795 . Collier had passed his lieutenant 's examination in 1790 , but only now did he receive his commission , when he was appointed lieutenant and commander of the Suffolk Tender on 31 July 1795 . Rainer sent him to the Cape of Good Hope , but shortly after his arrival , the commander of the station , Admiral Thomas Pringle ordered that Suffolk Tender be surveyed . She was subsequently condemned as unseaworthy , and Collier returned to Rainer at Madras without a ship . Rainer recommended that he return to Britain , where the good report of his service would assure him further employment and promotion . Collier duly arrived in England in May 1799 , and on 2 July that year received an appointment to the 64 @-@ gun HMS Zealand , which was then under the command of Captain Thomas Parr . A further advance came shortly afterwards , when he made first lieutenant on 29 July aboard Vice @-@ Admiral Andrew Mitchell 's flagship , the 50 @-@ gun HMS Isis . He was present at the capture of the Dutch squadron in the Vlieter Incident in August , and was chosen by Mitchell to carry the despatches back to Britain . 
 = = = Battle with the Flèche = = = 
 As was customary Collier received a promotion , to master and commander on 3 September 1799 , and a command , the 18 @-@ gun sloop HMS Victor , on 21 October . Collier commanded the Victor for the next couple of years , escorting convoys and on one occasion a convoy of troop transports to the Red Sea , bringing troops to defeat the French forces in Egypt . He stopped briefly at Diego Garcia to take on supplies , whereupon he fell in with the 22 @-@ gun French corvette Flèche . The two ships fought a brief engagement on 1 September 1801 , during which the Flèche damaged the Victor 's rigging and managed to escape . After repairing the damage , Collier searched the surrounding area before coming across his opponent on 5 September , sheltering in Mahé Roads . The channel was very narrow , and the wind unfavourable , but Collier managed to warp the Victor into the harbour , and with the aid of her <unk> , closed on the French ship . After enduring raking fire for sometime , he was finally able to haul his ship around and the two vessels exchanged broadsides for over two hours . By then the Flèche was observed to be in a sinking condition , and her captain ran her aground . A party of men were sent over from the Victor , but having boarded the French vessel , found her crew had set her on fire and then abandoned ship . The men were temporarily evacuated while further assistance was sent across , after which they re @-@ boarded and managed to extinguish the fire . Just as this had been achieved , the Flèche slipped off the reef into deeper water and sank . 
 Collier therefore came away without his prize , but his exploit came to the attention of the First Lord of the Admiralty Earl St Vincent . Impressed by Collier 's daring , St Vincent promoted him to post @-@ captain , with the 50 @-@ gun HMS Leopard as his command . As a further mark of favour , St Vincent antedated his commission to 22 April 1802 , giving him greater seniority over the officers promoted a week later in the general promotion that followed the Peace of Amiens . With the paying off of the Leopard in 1803 Collier moved ashore , spending until 20 January 1806 in command of the Sea Fencibles at Liverpool . On 18 May 1805 he married Maria Lyon , a resident of the city . The couple did not have any children . It was during this period ashore that Collier devised and presented the plans for a blockade of the Texel , in the hopes of being appointed to lead the expedition . Nothing had come of the scheme by the time he received his next sea @-@ going command , that of the 42 @-@ gun HMS Minerva in February 1806 . 
 = = Napoleonic Wars = = 
 The Minerva was sent south to the Spanish and Portuguese coasts , where Collier found himself busy suppressing privateering , and the Spanish coastal forts . He was moved on 22 April 1807 to take up command of the 38 @-@ gun HMS Surveillante , and duly took part in the expedition to Copenhagen . He received approbation for his services , and the British commander , Admiral James Gambier sent him back to Britain with his despatches . Collier received a knighthood , and by 1812 was back in the Bay of Biscay . He was active off the coast of Spain that year , supporting the guerrillas in the countryside under Admiral Sir Home Popham , and was personally involved in some of the land @-@ based operations of the Peninsular War . He was wounded on 1 August 1812 in an attack on the castle at Santander , but though the attack failed , it led to the French withdrawing from the castle , considering it too exposed . Collier 's raids were particularly useful in forcing the French forces in the north of the county to attempt to fortify and defend hundreds of small coastal creeks and villages , instead of supporting the forces in the south , allowing Wellington to defeat them . 
 It was while operating off the Iberian Peninsula that Collier devised a need for an improved type of ships ' boat . He developed a design based on elements of both a whaleboat and a jolly boat , and had one built for him at Plymouth Dockyard . The boat proved extremely useful after tests aboard the Surveillante , especially at being able to land safely on a flat beach to give close support . Collier further modified it by installing a howitzer in the bows , and soon boats of its type were being requested by other captains for their ships . In 1813 Collier succeeded Sir Home Popham in commanding the north coast squadron , Spain . He and a small squadron supported General Arthur Wellesley and General Sir Thomas Graham in the capture of San Sebastián and the siege of Bayonne . 
 = = War of 1812 = = 
 On 15 March 1814 Collier received command of the 50 @-@ gun HMS Leander and was sent to North America to deal with the American super frigates that were causing losses to British merchant shipping . It was a highly sought after posting , and reflected the Admiralty 's approval of his efforts off Spain . Collier sought battle with the USS Constitution , but the American ship escaped from Boston and evaded him . He gathered a squadron consisting of the Leander , the 60 @-@ gun HMS Newcastle and the 40 @-@ gun HMS Acasta , and set off in pursuit . He almost caught up with the Constitution off St Jago , but failed to close on her , later claiming the weather frustrated his attempts . The Constitution was at the time sailing with two captured British prizes , the former HMS Levant and HMS Cyane . Collier 's three ships gave chase and were overhauling the Constitution , when , having allowed the Cyane to escape , the Levant broke away and Collier followed her . In doing so he retook the Levant , but allowed Constitution to escape . Collier continued to cruise in the area , but before he had another opportunity to pursue the Constitution , news reached him that the Treaty of Ghent had been signed and that the war was over . 
 = = Years of peace = = 
 Collier returned to Britain and on 20 September 1814 was created a baronet . He was invested as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 2 January 1815 . He was also appointed groom of the bedchamber to the Duke of Gloucester that day . He continued to see active service at sea , being appointed as commodore of the West Africa Squadron , with the 36 @-@ gun HMS Creole as his flagship . Between 1818 and 1821 , he played a distinguished role in anti @-@ slavery efforts , which led to his election as an honorary life member of the African Institution on 17 May 1820 . 
 = = James 's account and death = = 
 Collier 's life was disturbed by the publication of William James 's Naval History in 1823 . James paid particular attention to the escape of the Constitution , and lamented Collier 's failure to bring her to action and capture her . James claimed Collier 's incompetence had allowed the Constitution to escape from Boston , while his failure to bring her to action when his squadron later sighted her was attributed to what amounted to cowardice on his part . James summed up the episode with 
 Most sincerely do we regret ... that this last and most triumphant escape of the Constitution , the first frigate of the United States that had humbled the proud flag of Britain , had , not long ago , been brought under the scrutiny of a court @-@ martial . The blame would then have fallen where it ought to have fallen ... The more it is investigated , the more it will show itself to be , the most blundering piece of business recorded in these six volumes . 
 Collier applied to the Admiralty for the opportunity to clear his name , but this was not satisfied . Friends and relations had become increasingly concerned about his mental state as a result . His brother took the precaution of removing the razors from his home , but Collier appears to have smuggled one to his room , and used it to cut his own throat early in the morning on 24 March 1824 . His servant who was sleeping in the same room immediately brought help , but nothing could be done and Collier died less than five minutes after inflicting the injury . The inquest later determined that ' The deceased destroyed himself , being in a state of temporary mental derangement . ' The baronetcy became extinct upon his death . 
 = Action of 30 June 1798 = 
 The Action of 30 June 1798 was a minor naval engagement fought along the Biscay coast of France during the French Revolutionary Wars . The French Navy had been largely driven from the Atlantic Ocean early in the war following heavy losses in a series of failed operations . This had allowed the Royal Navy 's Channel Fleet to institute a close blockade on the French naval ports of the Biscay coast , particularly Brest in Brittany . The blockade strategy included a constantly patrolling inshore squadron composed of frigates , tasked with preventing the passage of French ships into or out of the port . In the spring of 1798 , several French frigates stationed in the Indian Ocean were sent back to France as the base at Île de France could no longer supply them effectively . One of these ships was the 40 @-@ gun frigate Seine , which departed Port Louis laden with 280 soldiers from the garrison . 
 Seine had a rapid passage back to European waters , arriving in the Bay of Biscay on 28 June . Early the following morning , with the Brittany coast in sight , Seine was spotted by the inshore frigate squadron of HMS Jason , HMS Pique and HMS Mermaid . While Mermaid cut Seine off from the coast , Jason and Pique gave chase as Seine fled southwards . Pique reached Seine at 23 : 00 that evening and for more than two and a half hours the frigates pounded at one another until Pique fell back . Pique and Jason continued the chase full speed through the night , until suddenly all three frigates crashed headlong into the sandbanks off La Tranche @-@ sur @-@ Mer on the Vendée coast . Even while grounded the frigates continued to fire on one another until Mermaid finally arrived and the outnumbered Seine surrendered . Jason and Seine were badly damaged but successfully refloated , the casualties on the packed decks of the French ship appallingly high , but Pique was an irretrievable wreck : the ship was evacuated and then burnt before the remainder of the squadron returned to Britain with their prize . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the early years of the French Revolutionary Wars , although the French Navy had sought to oppose the Royal Navy at sea from their main base at Brest in Brittany , the Royal Navy had achieved victories at the Glorious First of June and Battle of Groix . The losses inflicted on the French Atlantic fleet in these battles were compounded by large numbers of ships wrecked in storms during the disastrous Croisière du Grand Hiver and Expédition d 'Irlande operations . By 1798 the Royal Navy was unopposed in its control of the Atlantic , enforcing its supremacy by a strategy of close blockade , maintaining a battle fleet at sea off Brittany and an inshore squadron of frigates watching the approaches to Brest . In June 1798 the inshore squadron included a detachment comprising the 38 @-@ gun HMS Jason under Captain Charles Stirling , the 36 @-@ gun HMS Pique under Captain David Milne and 32 @-@ gun HMS Mermaid under Captain James Newman @-@ Newman . 
 For French warships oceanic travel was extremely hazardous and ships often travelled in numbers . In the spring of 1796 a squadron commanded by Contre @-@ amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey had sailed from Rochefort to reinforce French naval forces in the Indian Ocean , based at Port Louis on the Île de France . Sercey 's squadron failed to make a significant impression , driven off from the East Indies in an inconclusive action off Sumatra , and then tricked into fleeing from a vulnerable East India Company merchant convoy in the Bali Strait Incident in January 1797 . By the end of the year the Colonial Assembly , which were unhappy with plans of the French Directory to abolish slavery , refused to continue supplying the squadron and garrison , forcing Sercey to disperse his ships . First Régénérée and Vertu were ordered back to France , and then in early 1798 the 40 @-@ gun Seine was instructed to follow them , carrying 280 soldiers from the garrison no longer supported by the Colonial Assembly . Seine , still commanded by Lieutenant Julien @-@ Gabriel Bigot following the death of Captain Latour off Sumatra in 1796 , sailed on 24 March , overcrowded with the stores and dependents accompanying the soldiers . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Despite the overloading , Seine made a rapid journey to European waters , arriving in the Bay of Biscay just three months later on 28 June . Sailing for Brest with the wind , the Penmarck rocks were visible from Seine at 07 : 00 on 29 June when three sails appeared to the northeast . This was the inshore squadron under Stirling , and Jason and Pique immediately gave chase while Mermaid diverted northwards , cutting Seine off from the Breton coast and the harbour of Lorient and forcing Bigot to turn away , fleeing southwards towards La Rochelle and the Vendée coast instead . Jason and Pique followed under all sail while Mermaid was left far behind . 
 Throughout the day the chase continued , the British frigates gaining slowly on their quarry and as darkness fell Pique closed with the larger French ship . At 23 : 00 Milne was close enough to open fire on Seine , to which Bigot responded without reducing speed . For the next two and a half hours the frigates exchanged broadsides at full speed as the French coastline rapidly approached ahead . At 01 : 35 a shot from Seine struck the main topmast on Pique , bringing it crashing down . The consequent loss of speed forced Milne back , Seine pulling away from the smaller ship but unable to escape Jason which was steadily gaining . 
 Stirling was concerned by the proximity of the coast and hailed Pique with orders to anchor before it grounded , but Milne did not hear the order correctly and instead increased sail , lurching ahead of Jason and straight onto a sandbank close to La Tranche @-@ sur @-@ Mer on the Vendée coast . Seine too had struck the shore a little distance ahead , and Stirling was unable to arrest Jason 's momentum before his ship too became stuck , lying between Pique and Seine . The French ship had been badly damaged in the crash , all three masts collapsing overboard at impact , but actually lay in a stronger position : Jason blocked Pique 's arc of fire and Stirling 's ship had swung with the rising tide , leaving its stern exposed . Bigot took advantage of this position to fire several raking broadsides into Jason , during which Stirling was wounded and command passed to Lieutenant Charles Inglis . Inglis responded to the fire by cutting stern gunports to fire chase guns at Seine , and Milne succeeded in dragging his frigate around through the novel expedient of ordering his men to run towards the bows carrying round shot . This sudden shift in weight gently rotated the grounded ship to face Seine and Milne could direct four of his 12 @-@ pounder long guns at the French ship . Under fire and with Mermaid finally approaching , Bigot determined that further resistance was hopeless and struck his colours .

 Dawn on 30 June revealed the three frigates grounded on the sandbar , prompting a response from the French forces in nearby La Rochelle . Two frigates , a brig and a squadron of gunboats were sent to fire on the British ships , but this force was dissuaded from engaging by the arrival of another British blockade squadron comprising HMS Phaeton under Captain Robert Stopford , HMS San Fiorenzo under Captain Sir Harry Neale and HMS Triton under Captain John Gore . Stopford 's squadron assisted Stirling 's force as Jason was towed off by Mermaid . Pique however was irretrievably stuck with water leaking into the hull . After all efforts to refloat the ship had been exhausted , the frigate was evacuated and stripped of stores before the wreck was set on fire . It took some time for boarding parties to reach Seine and a number of the French crew had taken the delay in seizure of the ship to dive overboard and swim for the beach , making an accounting of casualties difficult . As the day continued , boat parties of French civilians sailed out to the ship and climbed aboard , breaking into the liquor stores leading to drunken confusion on deck . Bigot was allowed to go ashore temporarily , as were four men escorting a lady from Île de France : all five French sailors subsequently returned to captivity voluntarily . Seine was subsequently refloated with jury masts after the guns were thrown overboard to lighten the ship , and the figurehead of Pique was nailed over her own , Seine sailing with the squadron to Portsmouth . 
 Losses on the British ships had been light , with seven killed on Jason , including the second lieutenant , and eleven wounded , including Stirling . Pique lost one killed and another lost overboard and six wounded . French losses were enormous , the effects of concentrated cannon fire on the packed decks producing casualties of approximately 170 killed and 100 wounded , the former including a number who drowned after the ship grounded . Bigot and his crew were brought to Britain as prisoners of war , the commander later exchanged and twice promoted on his return to France in recognition of his resistance during the engagement , although unsubstantiated rumours persisted that he had personally shot some of his men when they abandoned their guns . Milne was complimented for his tenacious pursuit of Seine and after repairs he and his crew were confirmed in possession of the French ship , which served in the Royal Navy under the same name . By the time the prize was commissioned many of its captors were prisoners of war . On 13 October 1798 Jason was patrolling off Brest when a number of French luggers were sighted . Stirling gave chase but Jason ran headlong into a submerged rock near the Pointe du Raz and began to founder . Stirling had no choice but to bring the frigate inshore and land on the French coast as the frigate sank . Stirling and his men were captured , except for twelve sailors who , in groups of six , stole a cutter and a <unk> and escaped to Plymouth . 
 = 1975 Pacific hurricane season = 
 The 1975 Pacific hurricane season officially started May 15 , 1975 in the eastern Pacific , and June 1 , 1975 in the central Pacific , and lasted until November 30 , 1975 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeast Pacific Ocean . 
 The 1975 Pacific hurricane season was near average , with 17 tropical storms forming . Of these , 9 became hurricanes , and 4 became major hurricanes by reaching Category 3 or higher on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . The only notable storms are Hurricane Olivia , which killed 30 people , caused $ 30 million ( 1975 USD ) in damage , and left thousands homeless when it made landfall in October ; and an unnamed hurricane that developed at very high latitude , but had no effect on land . Hurricane Denise was the strongest storm of the year . Hurricanes Lily and Katrina passed close to Socorro Island and Tropical Storm Eleanor made landfall in Mexico . Hurricane Agatha sank a ship . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 The season began with the formation of Tropical Depression One on June 2 and ended with the extratropical transition of Tropical Storm Priscilla on November 7 . No named systems formed in May , two in June , four in July , six in August , three in September , one in October , and one in November . The total length of the season , from the formation of the first depression to the dissipation of the last , was 158 days . 
 In the eastern Pacific proper ( east of 140 ° W ) , sixteen tropical storms and eight hurricanes formed . Four of the hurricanes became major hurricanes by reaching Category 3 or higher on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . These numbers are close to the long @-@ term averages of fifteen tropical storms , nine hurricanes , and four major hurricanes . There were also four unnamed tropical depressions . The only system to enter or form in the central Pacific ( between 140 ° W and the international dateline ) was an unusual high @-@ latitude hurricane . 
 The only systems to make landfall this year were Tropical Storm Eleanor and Hurricane Olivia . Besides these two systems , Hurricane Agatha caused the sinking of a ship carrying millions of dollars worth of cargo . Tropical Storm Eleanor caused no serious impact . 
 The most devastating storm of the season was Hurricane Olivia . A late @-@ season major hurricane , Olivia came ashore near Mazatlán . The storm killed 30 people , left around 30 @,@ 000 people homeless , and caused 20 million dollars ( 1975 USD ) in damage .

 An area of disturbed weather about 290 mi ( 467 km ) southwest of Acapulco formed on June 1 . It organized into a tropical depression the next day . After heading southwestward , it turned to the northwest and strengthened into Tropical Storm Agatha on June 2 . Agatha maintained its course and steadily intensified . It reached hurricane intensity on June 3 while located about 170 mi ( 270 km ) southwest of Zihuatanejo . Hurricane Agatha started weakening thereafter , becoming a tropical storm on June 4 and a depression on June 5 . It dissipated shortly afterwords . At this time , Agatha was located about 140 mi ( 230 km ) south of the Tres Marias Islands . 
 Even though Agatha passed close to Mexico as it weakened , no impact is known to have been caused . Waves caused by Agatha did impact a ship called the Polynesian <unk> . A Greek freighter en route from Pago Pago to Terminal Island , California , the Polynesian <unk> began flooding on June 3 , forcing the 32 @-@ man crew to abandon the vessel . The exact cause of the initial flooding was unknown , but was speculated to be primarily due to cargo shifting and not the weather . The crew was rescued by the United States Coast Guard . Three members required hospitalization . After being reached on June 6 by a tugboat in a salvage attempt , the vessel capsized and sank near San Clemente Island on June 7 , taking its multi @-@ million dollar cargo of 71 containers of canned tuna with it .

The hurricane turned to the southwest and gradually weakened . By July 11 it was nearly stationary . It then headed northwestward again and continued weakening , becoming a tropical storm on July 13 . It weakened into a depression on July 14 and dissipated immediately thereafter .

It became a depression on August 16 , turned a little bit more westward , and dissipated on August 17 . Hilary never came near land , and as such caused no death or damage . 
 = = = Hurricane Ilsa = = = 
 On August 18 , a tropical depression formed south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec from a tropical wave that had entered the Pacific Ocean from the Atlantic Ocean . It strengthened into a tropical storm later that day . The tropical storm moved westward , and became a hurricane on August 21 . Ilsa became a Category 2 hurricane on August 22 . It maintained that intensity for three days as it moved out to sea . On August 25 , Ilsa turned westward and rapidly weakened . It fell to tropical storm intensity on August 26 . Later that day , while still maintaining winds of gale @-@ force , Ilsa ceased being a tropical cyclone . Ilsa 's remnants continued out over the open Pacific Ocean . The remains of Ilsa eventually interacted with another weather system . That triggered the development of the unnamed hurricane of August 31 – September 5 . 
 Hurricane Ilsa caused no casualties or damage . As the unnamed hurricane formed from Ilsa 's remnants , Ilsa and the latter system are unofficially the same tropical cyclone . Indeed , this year 's seasonal report from the Redwood City Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center , in the Monthly Weather Review includes a brief discussion of the unnamed hurricane in the report 's section on Hurricane Ilsa . Neither the Central Pacific Hurricane Center nor the official HURDAT " best track " database of tropical cyclone location and intensity data explicitly considers them the same . Hence , as far as official records matter , Ilsa and the unnamed hurricane of August 31 – September 5 are different tropical cyclones .

 On August 24 , a tropical depression formed from a tropical disturbance about 250 mi ( 400 km ) south of Acapulco . It intensified into Tropical Storm Jewel the next day . The tropical cyclone headed generally northwest and paralleled the coast of Mexico . On August 27 , Jewel became a hurricane for mere six hours , the minimum possible time in HURDAT . Jewel then turned to the west , and then back to the northwest . Jewel weakened to depression strength on August 31 . Tropical Depression Jewel dissipated shortly after that , although its remnants remained distinct until September 3 . There was no impact .

It peaked in intensity on September 3 as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph ( 209 km / h ) , the second highest of the season . Katrina then headed westward and rapidly weakened . It was downgraded into a tropical storm on September 5 and a depression on September 6 . The last advisory was issued on September 7 when Katrina dissipated . Although the hurricane brought Category 3 @-@ equivalent winds to Socorro Island on September 2 , no damage was reported there or anywhere else .

 A cold core low absorbed the remnant circulation of Hurricane Ilsa on September 2 . Convection subsequently increased . By September 3 it was definitely a tropical cyclone as an eye slowly formed . It then became a hurricane . The hurricane rapidly headed towards the northeast and approached a frontal cyclone . By September 5 the hurricane had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone after weakening from a hurricane . At the time it was less than 348 mi ( 560 km ) southwest of Juneau , Alaska . The extratropical low moved southeastward , retaining its identity until it reached Montana , where it was absorbed by a front . 
 It is unknown why this hurricane went unnamed , even though it clearly met the criteria for doing so . Any statement about why is purely speculative at this point . The hurricane is the furthest north a tropical cyclone existed in the Eastern Pacific , and is also the northernmost existence for a Pacific hurricane . It was the only tropical cyclone to exist in the central Pacific this year . No damage or casualties were reported , although it did hassle a few ships . 
 = = = Hurricane Lily = = = 
 Rain and wind reports from the Acapulco weather station suggested that a tropical depression was developing . This was confirmed on September 16 from ship reports . It intensified into a tropical storm and was named Lily . Tropical Storm Lily headed northwest in a nearly straight path . By 0000 UTC September 18 , the system was a moderate tropical storm located about 160 mi ( 260 km ) south of Manzanillo Lily was upgraded to hurricane status on the same day and eventually reached its peak strength . After passing southwest of Socorro Island , Lily weakened , becoming a storm on September 20 . Lily weakened into a depression on September 21 , turned to the west @-@ southwest , and dissipated . Its remnants remained visible until September 24 , when they were no longer distinct via weather satellite . On September 19 , the cyclone brought hurricane @-@ force winds to Socorro Island .

 On October 22 , Tropical Depression Eighteen formed from a cluster of three thunderstorms south of Mexico and then strengthened into a tropical storm . It moved northwestward initially , followed by a northeast turn . Olivia then intensified steadily . It reached Category 3 intensity and a peak of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) winds just before landfall . Early on October 25 , Olivia moved ashore just south of Mazatlán causing major damage . Olivia destroyed 7 @,@ 000 houses in the region , leaving 30 @,@ 000 people homeless , and damage totaled $ 20 million ( 1975 USD , $ 88 million 2016 USD ) .

 = Marilyn Monroe ( Nicki Minaj song ) = 
 " Marilyn Monroe " is a song by Trinidadian born recording artist Nicki Minaj . The song was written by Minaj , Daniel James , Leah Haywood , Ross Golan and J.R. Rotem , while production was handled by J.R. Rotem and Dreamlab . Musically , " Marilyn Monroe " is an introspective mid @-@ tempo ballad that contains an upbeat piano , synth beats , and features influences of bubblegum pop . Lyrically , the song alludes to oneself questioning the status of their relationship . The song makes frequent references to pop icon Marilyn Monroe , with many of her quotes woven into the song . 
 " Marilyn Monroe " was generally well received by music critics , with some noting its crossover potential , while others felt like the song was too similar to other artists . The song has received comparisons to the 2011 singles " Disaster " by JoJo and " <unk> " by Fefe Dobson , as well as Minaj 's own 2010 single " Your Love " from her debut album Pink Friday . The album 's high digital sales led " Marilyn Monroe " to chart on the UK Singles Chart and US Billboard charts . 
 = = Production and composition = = 
 Following the success of Minaj 's debut album , Pink Friday , Cash Money co @-@ CEO , Brian " Birdman " Williams announced to Billboard that Minaj was aiming for a first quarter release in 2012 . In November 2011 , Minaj announced on Twitter that the album would be released on February 14 , 2012 , though it was later delayed to April 3 , 2012 . The album focuses on Roman Zolanski , one of Minaj 's alter egos that was first featured on Pink Friday . 
 J.R. Rotem , who previously produced a track for Minaj 's debut album , originally conceived " Marilyn Monroe " . According to Minaj , " He hit me up and he said , ' I have a song that I think only an icon can sing ' . I was like , ' Oh J.R. , shut up ! ' We laughed a little bit on iChat . " It was written by Minaj , Daniel James , Leah Haywood , Ross Golan and Rotem . Rotem and Dreamlab produced the track , with vocal production handled by Nicholas Cooper . Ariel Chobaz & Gelly Kusuma recorded and mixed " Marilyn Monroe " with assistance from Jon Sher at Conway Studios and Beluga Heights Studio , both studios in Los Angeles . 
 Musically , " Marilyn Monroe " is an introspective mid @-@ tempo ballad that contains an upbeat piano , synth beats , and features influences of bubblegum pop . The song is written in the key of E minor with a moderate pop tempo of 84 beats per minute . It follows the chord progression Em − C2 ( no 3 ) − G − D , and Minaj 's vocals span two octaves from G3 to D5 . 
 Celebrity Marilyn Monroe is mentioned numerous times throughout the song , including the famous quote " I 'm selfish , impatient and a little insecure . I make mistakes , I am out of control and at times hard to handle . But if you can 't handle me at my worst , then you sure as hell don 't deserve me at my best . " However , it has never been confirmed that Monroe actually said this . Minaj liked the track , as " it spoked to me as a woman . I 'm very infatuated with Marilyn Monroe . I had a moment with that song where I was like , ' Oh my God , every woman in this world needs to hear that ' . No , we 're not perfect . Sometimes , we think , ' What 's wrong with us ? ' We spend so much time criticizing ourselves . I needed to hear that , ' I 'm not perfect , but I 'm worth it ' . It resonated with me . I felt like the world needed to hear it . "

 " Marilyn Monroe " was first leaked in February 2012 . On May 24 , 2012 , a poll was posted on Minaj 's official website asking fans to choose the next single ( s ) . The poll was divided into three categories : The first category asked fans to choose between " Marilyn Monroe " , " Fire Burns " , " Young Forever " , and " Gunshot " . " Marilyn Monroe " had the most votes and won the poll ; " Young Forever " came in second , " Fire Burns " came in third , and " Gun Shot " came in fourth . When asked whether " Marilyn Monroe " would become a single during an interview with The Guardian , Minaj replied : " It has to be . It will be . We wanted to do it now , but then UK radio started playing ' Va Va Voom ' . We 're definitely going to have ' Marilyn Monroe ' top of [ 2013 ] , and we 're going to spend quality time on the video . We 're going to take care of that one . " 
 " Marilyn Monroe " received mostly positive reviews . Andrew Hampp of Billboard gave the song a positive review , but felt the song was too similar to the JoJo song " Disaster " , adding that " Of the three mid @-@ tempo pop cuts on the album , ' Marilyn Monroe ' stands the best chance of pop crossover . " Andy Gill of The Independent called it one of the most impressive songs on the pop half of the album and also encouraged fans to download it . BBC 's Al Fox gave the song a positive review , praising " Young Forever " and " Marilyn Monroe " for displaying the same " tender vulnerabilities " of Minaj 's breakthrough anthem " Your Love " , saying that it is " a necessary and successful respite in an album so boastful " . Slant Magazine negatively compared " Marilyn Monroe " to the works of pop star Demi Lovato .

 = Middleton , Leeds = 
 Middleton is a largely residential suburb of Leeds in West Yorkshire , England and historically a village in the West Riding of Yorkshire . It is situated on a hill 4 miles ( 6 km ) south of Leeds city centre and 165 miles ( 266 km ) north north @-@ west of London . In 2001 the population of the Middleton Park ward of Leeds City Council was 27 @,@ 487 , reducing to 26 @,@ 228 at the 2011 Census . 
 Middleton was occupied before the Norman Conquest and recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 . It developed as a manorial estate and its owners began to exploit the coal seams that outcropped within its boundaries . At the start of the Industrial Revolution a wooden wagonway was built to link the coal pits to Leeds . The colliery agent , John Blenkinsop designed an iron railway and its first steam @-@ powered locomotive which was built by Matthew Murray in Holbeck . The coal mines on which the local economy was based lasted until 1967 and the railway is a preserved and run by a trust after operating for 200 years . 
 Middleton Park , a remnant of the manorial estate , contains a large area of ancient woodland and parts of it , where coal was mined , are designated a scheduled ancient monument . It was the location of Middleton Hall and Middleton Lodge , homes to the local gentry . 
 The village developed along Town Street , a school , chapel and church were built in the 19th century but after the land was acquired by Leeds Council in 1920 a large council housing estate was built on the flatter land to the south , completely changing the rural nature of the settlement . Early transport was provided by a tram line and the Leeds Ring Road was built to Middleton . After the colliery closed the area began to decline and by 2001 , had areas of multiple deprivation and high levels of unemployment and anti @-@ social behaviour . The Middleton Regeneration Board has been established with the remit of addressing these issues . 
 = = History = = 
 The name Middleton is derived from the Old English <unk> @-@ tun , in this case the middle settlement or farm on the road from Morley to Rothwell . 
 Flint and bronze weapons have been discovered in the neighbourhood showing evidence of habitation during the Palaeolithic and Bronze Ages . Roman discoveries were made in 1607 and 1823 . Middleton was mentioned as <unk> and <unk> in the Domesday Book as having three carucates of land much of which was woodland . The land was given to Ilbert de Lacy who had a castle at Pontefract . Middleton Park is a remnant of the manorial estate which existed after the Norman Conquest . In the 13th century the boundary between Middleton and Beeston became the focus of a protracted dispute over where it lay in the dense woodland which covered the area . The dispute between William <unk> and Adam de Beeston was settled in 1209 by single combat and resulted in the construction of a boundary bank and ditch , a stretch of which can still be seen in Middleton Woods . 
 The <unk> were lords of the manor followed by the Leigh or Legh family . John of Gaunt , 1st Duke of Lancaster , held the manor from 1363 to 1370 and Simon Simeon , whose will mentioned coal mines , from 1401 – 1406 . The Leighs held the manor for much of the time between 1300 until 1697 when Anne Leigh married Ralph Brandling of Felling in Durham . The Leighs once occupied New Hall whose name is recalled in the street names in the area . William Gascoigne , who invented the micrometer and died fighting for the Royalists at Marston Moor in 1644 , was another resident of New Hall . 
 Middleton Hall on Town Street was built in the 18th century for the Brandlings but they chose to live mainly in Durham . Charles John Brandling of Gosforth House , the Member of Parliament for Newcastle between 1798 and 1812 and for Northumberland from 1820 until 1826 , married Henrietta Armitage of Middleton . The Brandlings appointed John Blenkinsop to manage their collieries in Middleton and he was the hall 's occupant in 1809 . The hall was destroyed in a fire in 1962 . 
 In 1760 the Brandlings built a new residence , Middleton Lodge , designed by James Paine . It was situated in what is now the park possibly on the site the original manor house . Members of the family lived there until 1860 including R.H. Brandling who donated land on Town Street on which the church is built . The Brandling 's fortunes declined and the estate was sold to the Middleton Estate & Colliery Company in 1862 . William Henry Maude , a partner in the company , occupied the house with his sister in 1871 . He died in a carriage accident in the park in 1911 . His sister remained at Middleton Lodge after the land had been acquired by the council until her death in 1933 after which the house became the headquarters of Middleton Golf Club . Middleton Lodge was demolished in 1996 . 
 = = = Industrial history = = = 
 There is evidence of coal mining in the Middle Ages in the shaft mounds , waggonways and similar archaeological features resulting from early mining activity in Middleton Woods . Before the 17th century the pits were bell pits and adits or day holes dug horizontally into the hill sides where the coal seam outcropped . In 1669 Frances Conyers of New Hall had " cole pits " in Middleton . The pits were small and numerous and many worked for a short time . Gin pits using horses to turn the windlass were the next development and the deeper pits had brick @-@ lined shafts and wooden headgear for hauling tubs of coal and miners out of the workings . This type of mine was in operation when Anne Leigh married Ralph Brandling whose family owned collieries in Durham . Brandling 's 1 @,@ 200 acre Middleton estate supplied coal to Leeds but was disadvantaged in the trade by poor roads . Deep mining arrived with the advent of steam engines to pump water out of the mines and keep the workings dry making it possible to raise coal from greater depths . In 1780 a Newcomen engine was installed at Middleton and by 1808 the mine employed 90 hewers and 60 putters . The market for coal grew as Leeds and its industries expanded . 
 The Middleton Railway , founded in 1758 , is the oldest continuously working railway in Britain to be established by an Act of Parliament ; the first such act in England . The railway , owned by Charles Brandling , ( 1733 – 1802 ) was a horse drawn wooden <unk> linking the collieries at Middleton to <unk> Close near Leeds Bridge in the centre of Leeds . In 1810 John Blenkinsop , Brandling 's agent at Middleton , was looking for cheaper ways of moving coal to Leeds . He designed the rack railway and Matthew Murray built the first Middleton Railway locomotive , " Salamanca " , at his Round Foundry in Holbeck . The locomotive 's first run , reported in The Leeds Mercury on 27 June 1812 , was " witnessed by thousands of spectators and crowned a complete success .... " . Three more locomotives were built . The Middleton Railway locomotives had a toothed cog wheel which meshed into a rack on the side of the rail , as it was felt this would provide the engines with a better grip when hauling coal wagons . 
 Before 1840 , women and children were employed in coal mines and there were frequent accidents . The worst disaster occurred in 1825 at the Gosforth Pit , named after the Brandling 's Durham estate , where an explosion of firedamp caused 24 deaths ; the oldest a collier aged 48 and the youngest a child of seven . 
 Broom Pit was the deepest at 810 feet ( 250 m ) , and longest @-@ lasting of the Middleton collieries . In 1896 the Middleton Broom , Little and Middleton Main Pits , all managed by John Neal , employed over 600 workers . By 1923 just the Broom Pit was working , employing more than 1 @,@ 000 men and supplying coking , gas and household coal and fireclay to the brickworks . Nearly 900 men were employed there in 1940 . At the time the collieries were nationalised in 1947 , the workforce had reduced to 436 . Operations at the pit ended in 1968 as the productivity of the colliery declined .

 In 1919 , the grounds of Middleton Lodge were leased by Leeds Council for use as a public park . The rural nature of the area changed soon after 1 April 1920 when the township was incorporated into the County Borough of Leeds . Leeds Council acquired land to construct " a vast low @-@ density corporation built cottage estate with circuses and avenues " . The houses were built using bricks from the fireclay works at Broom Pit on land once used for agriculture including West Farm and parts of Sissons Farm . By 1934 , 2 @,@ 377 council houses had been built and the housing estate was considered to be a " garden suburb " , but was found to be remote and lacking in facilities by the residents . An early resident was Keith Waterhouse , who wrote about his childhood exploits as the only member of the Middleton Hiking Club , in his book , City Lights . 
 The area attracted more social housing when the <unk> and Manor Farm estates were developed in the 1960s . A large private housing estate was built at Sharp Lane after 1972 and 1 @,@ 300 houses were built at Leeds New Forest Village after 2005 .

 Middleton was a township and chapelry dependent on Holy Trinity Church in the ancient parish of Rothwell in the wapentake of <unk> and Morley in the West Riding of Yorkshire . It became an ecclesiastical parish after 1849 . Between 1866 and 1920 it was a civil parish . Middleton was part of the Great Preston Gilbert Union from 1809 until 1862 which provided a workhouse and poor relief for the parishes within its jurisdiction . The Gilbert unions were exempt from the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 but disbanded in 1862 and after that Middleton became part of the Kirkstall Poor Law Union until 1869 when it joined the Hunslet Poor Law Union until 1920 , the same year it was incorporated into the City of Leeds . 
 Middleton is in the Middleton Park electoral ward and after the 2012 council elections , is represented on Leeds City Council by three Labour councillors . 
 The Middleton Park ward is in the Leeds Central parliamentary constituency . At the 2010 UK general election the seat was held by Hilary Benn who represents the Labour Party with 49 @.@ 3 % of the vote .

 Middleton is 4 miles ( 6 km ) south of Leeds city centre and 165 miles ( 266 km ) north north @-@ west of London . It is situated on a hill and occupies most of a plateau which falls away sharply to the west ( towards Dewsbury Road ) and in the park to the north of Town Street from where there are extensive views towards the city centre . A height 140 metres ( 459 ft ) AOD is reached at the western end of Town Street and within the park are two steep @-@ sided valleys with small streams separated by a tongue of land , which meet at 60 metres ( 197 ft ) AOD , its lowest point . The underlying geology is the coal measures and a bed of fireclay . Several coal seams outcrop in Middleton Park and between them are sandstones and shales . 
 The township covered about 1700 acres , of which 450 are woodland known as Middleton Woods and contain the largest area of ancient woodland remaining in Leeds . The old village was a ribbon development along Town Street which runs west @-@ east along a ridge and Middleton housing estate occupies flattish land to the south . The high point of Middleton is by the water tower at the western end of Town Street . Middleton is in an area surrounded by three motorways , the M62 motorway to the south , the M1 to the east and the <unk> to the north .

 Middleton Park , once the private estate of the lords of the manor of Middleton , is owned by Wade 's Charity and leased to Leeds City Council for a peppercorn rent . It has been one of Leeds many public parks since 1919 covering an area of nearly a square mile , 630 acres ( 2 @.@ 5 km2 ) , of which 200 acres ( 0 @.@ 81 km2 ) are of ancient woodland . There is a small lake , recreational areas and a golf course . The reclaimed site of Middleton Broom Pit was incorporated into the park . Two areas of the park , comprising ancient waggonways which are now surfaced footpaths , earthworks and remains of underground workings and shaft mounds , have been designated a scheduled ancient monument . 
 The Middleton Railway , a preserved heritage steam railway , operates from headquarters and museum at Moor Road Hunslet to Park Halt . It is operated by volunteers . From Middleton , Park Halt is accessed by a footpath that was originally a <unk> . The railway celebrated its 200th anniversary of steam haulage in 2012 . 
 On Town Street , a row of brick @-@ built cottages with stone slate roofs , known as Top of the town was built in the mid 18th century . The 19th @-@ century St Mary 's Church , with its contemporary lych gate and flanking walls are all Grade II listed buildings . In the churchyard is a war memorial erected in 1920 . To the west of the war memorial is a gatehouse which stood at an old entrance to the hall grounds . The distinctive white concrete water tower at the high point of the hill is at the south west corner of the park on Town Street . 
 = = Transport = = 
 To serve the growing population of the council estate , the Middleton Light Railway , an electric tramway , was built in 1925 by Leeds Corporation . The tramway from Leeds ran parallel to the colliery line to Hunslet Moor staithes and then headed south through Middleton Woods to a terminus on the Ring Road . The tramway was made into a circular route in 1949 when it was extended to Belle Isle Road and Balm Road in Hunslet . The tramway closed in 1959 . Its route through the park is now a footpath . 
 The original plans for the Leeds Supertram included a line to Middleton , but they were amended to save on costs and the later plans stipulated a terminus at Stourton . The scheme was axed when government funding was withdrawn . 
 Public transport in Middleton is coordinated by the West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority . Middleton is served by several bus routes operated by First Leeds and Arriva , with buses to Leeds city centre , Wakefield , Roundhay , Morley and the White Rose Centre .

 Middleton was a chapelry of the ancient ecclesiastical parish of Rothwell . In 1497 a chantry chapel was endowed by Gilbert <unk> and dedicated to St Mary the Virgin , it was closed at the time of the Reformation though the building is extant and now a private residence . 
 R.H. Brandling of Middleton Lodge gave land on Town Street on which to build a church and parsonage in 1845 . St Mary 's Church was built in 1846 to designs by R. D. <unk> , who also designed Leeds Parish Church . The church and its lych gate are designated Grade II listed buildings . The church originally had a tall spire which was taken down because of mining subsidence in 1939 . There is a tradition that local miners gave either a week 's wages or a week 's work towards the cost of its construction . 
 Out of the parish , two more parishes were created as the population increased after the Middleton council estate was built . In 1921 the church acquired a site on the Middleton housing estate on which to build . In 1925 a mission church was built off Middleton Park Avenue . The Church of St Cross was built in 1933 and became a parish church in 1935 with about two thirds of the Middleton housing estate in its boundaries . In the 1930s the Belle Isle housing estate was begun . The Church of St John and St Barnabus was built in Belle Isle in 1939 but not consecrated until 1947 because of the war . This church became a parish church . 
 Local Methodists reputedly met in a house on Town Street until a chapel was built in the 1860s . Middleton Methodist Chapel was built in 1896 replacing one built 30 years earlier by the Wesleyans . It was designed by <unk> and <unk> and built in brick . It has a tower to the north west and large west window . The interior survives largely unaltered and has a barrel @-@ vaulted ceiling . There is a Baptist church on Middleton Park Avenue . St Philip 's Roman Catholic Church , a modern building , is situated on St Philip 's Avenue .

 = Battle of Beirut ( 1912 ) = 
 The Battle of Beirut was a naval battle off the coast of Beirut during the Italo @-@ Turkish War . Italian fears that the Ottoman naval forces at Beirut could be used to threaten the approach to the Suez canal led the Italian military to order the destruction of the Ottoman naval presence in the area . On 24 February 1912 two Italian armoured cruisers attacked and sank an Ottoman casemate corvette and six lighters , retired , then returned and sank an Ottoman torpedo boat . 
 As a result of the battle all Ottoman naval forces in the region were annihilated , thus ensuring the approaches to the Suez Canal were open to the Italians . Besides the naval losses , the city of Beirut itself suffered significant damage from the Italian warships . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the Italo @-@ Turkish War , the Italian military feared that Ottoman naval forces in the Mediterranean would stage raid on the Italian supply and troopships headed for Italian East Africa . In order to prevent such a raid , Rear Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel was ordered to clear the harbor of Beirut of what Ottoman naval vessels he might find there . Revel 's force consisted of two armoured cruisers : Giuseppe Garibaldi and Francesco Ferruccio . Both cruisers were of the Giuseppe Garibaldi class and armed with two 10 inch guns in turrets , ten 6 inch guns , six 4 @.@ 7 inch guns , ten 6 @-@ pounders , ten 1 @-@ pounders , 2 Maxim machine guns , and five torpedo tubes . 
 In contrast the Ottoman forces consisted of the casemate corvette Avnillah and the torpedo boat Angora . The Angora was a relatively new vessel completed in 1906 and armed with two 37 mm cannons as well as two 14 inch torpedo tubes with a pair of torpedoes per tube . In contrast the Avnillah was an antiquated ironclad corvette built in 1869 . After a reconstruction was completed in 1907 she was armed with four 3 @-@ inch guns and eight six pounders . In addition to her cannon she was also armed with a single 14 inch torpedo tube . Thus the Ottoman force was entirely outgunned by the Italians , giving them a severe disadvantage in the looming battle . 
 = = Battle = = 
 The two Italian cruisers approached the harbor and fired a blank shot at the Ottoman vessels lying there . Upon sighting the Italian ships , the Ottoman commander on the Avnillah sent out a launch under a flag of truce to communicate with the enemy . While negotiating , the Ottoman commander ordered the Angora to position itself near the harbor 's mole . At 07 : 30 , Admiral Revel ordered the Ottoman launch to return with an ultimatum addressed to the <unk> of Beirut informing him to surrender his two warships by 09 : 00 . The message was received by the Wali at 08 : 30 . The Wali was in the process of issuing an order of surrender but this was not received by the Italians by the deadline . Accordingly , at 09 : 00 , the Italians began their attack on the Ottoman ships in the harbor . 
 At a distance of 6 @,@ 000 metres ( 6 @,@ 600 yards ) , the Italians opened fire upon the Ottoman corvette . The Ottomans returned fire ineffectively until 09 : 35 when the Italian gunfire set the Avnillah afire . Receiving heavy damage and outgunned , the corvette struck her colours and the crew abandoned ship . At this point the Garibaldi sailed in close and engaged the Angora at 600 metres ( 660 yards ) with gunfire but failed to damage it . The Garibaldi then attempted to finish off the Avnillah by firing a torpedo at her . However , the torpedo deviated from its trajectory and hit several lighters moored nearby , sinking six of them . Undeterred , the Italian cruiser fired a second torpedo that struck the Ottoman corvette amidships . By 11 : 00 the corvette was sunk in shallow water and the pair of cruisers withdrew to the north . The action was not over however ; at 13 : 45 , the Italian cruisers returned and once more engaged the Ottoman forces . The only warship left in the harbor was the torpedo boat Angora so the Ferruccio moved in close and engaged it with gunfire for three minutes before it joined the Avni @-@ <unk> at the bottom of Beirut 's harbor . Once the fighting had ended the two Italian cruisers sailed off in a westward direction . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Ottoman naval presence at Beirut was completely annihilated , removing the only Turkish naval threat to Italian transports in the area and giving the Italians complete naval dominance of the southern Mediterranean Sea for the rest of the war . Casualties on the Ottoman side were heavy . Both Ottoman warships were sunk , with the Avnillah alone taking 58 killed and 108 wounded . In contrast the Italian ships not only took no casualties , but no direct hits from the Ottoman warships as well . The damage was not restricted to the Ottoman naval vessels present at Beirut , as the city took heavy damage as well . Stray shots from the cruisers decimated the city . Fires broke out as a direct result of the stray gunfire , destroying several banks and part of the city 's customs house as well as other buildings . Combined from the fires and shelling , 66 civilians were killed in the city along with hundreds of others wounded . 
 As retribution for the Italian actions at Beirut , four days after the battle the central Ottoman government ordered the <unk> of Beirut , Aleppo , and Damascus to expel all Italian citizens from their jurisdictions , resulting in the deportation of over 60 @,@ 000 Italians from the region . Despite the retaliatory expulsion of Italian citizens from the area , the battle gave the Italian forces complete naval superiority in the approaches to the Suez Canal and Italian forces in Eritrea could now be reinforced without hesitation , eliminating much of the Ottoman threat to the region . Thus the battle was both a strategic and tactical Italian victory . 
 = Arnaud Tsamere = 
 Arnaud <unk> ( born 11 March 1975 ) , better known by the stage name Arnaud Tsamere ( French : [ <unk> <unk> ] ) , is a French comedian , actor , television presenter and sports journalist . Born in Bordeaux and raised in the Yvelines , he joined the Déclic Théâtre group after quitting his sales job . There , he acted in plays and participated in improvisation events . He wrote his first one @-@ man show , Réflexions profondes sur pas mal de trucs , in 2002 with Arnaud Joyet , and his second , Chose Promise , in 2007 with Joyet and François Rollin . His third , <unk> sur pas mal de trucs plus ou moins <unk> , has been performed since 2014 . He has attended numerous comedy festivals and is currently a member of the Ligue Majeure d <unk> . 
 Tsamere 's television career began when he presented the weather forecast on Canal + . From 2010 , he became well known for appearing on France 2 's sketch comedy show On n 'demande qu 'à en rire — and its short @-@ lived spin @-@ off the ONDAR Show — after he was discovered by Laurent Ruquier ; he often performed sketches with Jérémy Ferrari . He also plays Captain Sport Extrême in the comedy science fiction programme Hero Corp. In 2014 , he hosted TMC 's Canapé Quiz ; he has also appeared on various French talk , sports and game shows . Tsamere has acted in several films , including the short Being Homer Simpson with Philippe <unk> and Véronique Augereau , and <unk> , a 2013 adaptation of Starbuck . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Tsamere 's paternal grandparents are from <unk> , and his father is Breton . He was born in Bordeaux , but grew up in Versailles , <unk> and <unk> , in the Yvelines department . His father was a general in the French Air Force who was awarded the Legion of Honour , and his mother a housewife , whom he has described as " the best in her domain " . He has two brothers . He describes himself as having had a " strict upbringing " . 
 Speaking about his early life and its relation to his surreal comic style , Tsamere said : 
 I grew up in a very comfortable environment . I wanted for nothing ; serious things never happened to me in life . I have never been a victim of injustice , so I have nothing to protest . I don 't have any particular origins which would be interesting to talk about . ... So , I do absurd stuff because I don 't want to talk about other things . 
 After getting his baccalauréat , he studied law at university , where he discovered an improvisational match in his first year and " fell in love " with the performance . In 1998 , he obtained a master 's degree in business law and later got a job working in export sales . However , he realised that he " could no longer live without the stage " , and on the advice of his friend Arnaud Joyet and Déclic Théâtre co @-@ founder Alain Degois , quit his job and launched his career as a comedian .

 After quitting his previous job , Tsamere took part in the Déclic Théâtre improvisation group under its co @-@ founder Alain " Papy " Degois , who he said " pushed me , gave me confidence , coddled me [ and ] got me to act in plays and improvisation matches " . Between 2003 and 2005 , he played the baron Christian de <unk> in an adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac at the Château de <unk> with the theatre group La <unk> , to which he was introduced by Degois . 
 He began writing his first one @-@ man show in 2002 with his friend Arnaud Joyet , inspired by a videotape of comedian François Rollin . The show , entitled Réflexions profondes sur pas mal de trucs ( Profound reflections on quite a few things ) , played on theatrical " flops " , a form of humour that Tsamere said " can seem easy [ but ] is not when you really start to work on it " . It was performed at the Blancs <unk> theatre from April 2005 to January 2006 . 
 Tsamere met Rollin at the Dinard Comedy Festival , and he joined Tsamere and Joyet to write a second show , Chose Promise ( Promised Thing ) . Written in 2007 , it stars Tsamere as an economics teacher named Patrice Valenton , performing as part of a promise made to a friend who died in a car accident . He chose to perform as a character under Rollin 's suggestion , so that he could depict failure under the guise of somebody who is not a comedian . Regarding the show 's theme of death , he said " It 's a bit strange , but it has the virtue of attracting the public 's attention " . Tsamere 's performance was well received by critics ; Le Parisien called the show a " masterpiece of the genre " . Chose Promise was released on DVD on 6 March 2013 after being recorded at the Théâtre Sébastopol in Lille . Tsamere has done three tours of the show , and its final two performances were at the Olympia in February 2014 . 
 Tsamere 's third show , <unk> sur pas mal de trucs plus ou moins <unk> ( Secrets about quite a few more or less confidential things ) , also written with Rollin and Joyet , was performed on tour throughout France from November 2014 , and at Le Splendid from January 2015 . Tsamere has said it is based on the principal that " society laughs too much " , and will involve him talking about himself . 
 On 25 June 2012 at the Européen theatre , Tsamere performed alongside the On n 'demande qu 'à en rire jury member Éric <unk> in <unk> en <unk> . He performed La <unk> du trio with his On n 'demande qu 'à en rire colleague Jérémy Ferrari , and Baptiste <unk> ; after a tour of 12 performances in <unk> , they did several special performances in February 2014 . Tsamere has attended comedy festivals such as the Montreux Comedy Festival , where he performed with Ferrari , and the Avignon Festival . He is now part of the Ligue Majeure d <unk> .

 In 2005 , with the help of Frédéric <unk> , whom he met at a Puy @-@ Saint @-@ Vincent comedy festival , Tsamere got the job of presenting the weather forecast in Le Grand Journal on Canal + . He also appeared in Canal + ' s SAV des <unk> , presented by <unk> and Omar Sy . After quitting the weather in June 2006 , he hosted La longue nuit du <unk> on the same channel that September . It was a night dedicated to the penis , which Tsamere has described as " nothing pornographic or erotic . It was a series of serious documentaries . " He says he was asked after <unk> Bel refused , because he was " probably the only one liable to accept " . 
 In 2007 Tsamere met Simon Astier during the recording of the M6 show Off Prime . He was given the role of Captain Sport Extrême in Astier 's comedy science fiction programme , Hero Corp , which is broadcast on France 4 . He only appeared in one episode of the first series , but more frequently in the second . Speaking about the differences between himself and his character , Tsamere said " He is a misogynist , beastly , an adventurer , unattached ... I am just the opposite " . He also said " I 've loved this character . I love playing crackpots . " 
 In 2010 he participated in the sketch comedy talent show On n 'demande qu 'à en rire , created and presented by Laurent Ruquier and broadcast on France 2 . Ruquier asked him to do so after he saw Tsamere in Monique est <unk> <unk> 12 and Le Comique . He has described it as " the missing piece of the puzzle " that allowed him to become well known . He already knew all of the original participants , except for Nicole <unk> , whom he discovered at a comedy festival in Puy @-@ Saint @-@ Vincent in January 2011 . He is friends with Jérémy Ferrari , with whom he has performed sketches on the show . The two share a well @-@ known on @-@ stage rivalry . 
 Based on puns involving crime and food , his sketch " L <unk> de la <unk> , la <unk> et la <unk> " was the first in the programme to achieve 99 out of 100 points . After participating in the show for two years and totalling 64 appearances , Tsamere announced in 2012 that he did not plan to return for its third season . However , he came back the next year after the cancellation of the ONDAR Show , and described his stage fright before his first performance after his return . When the show returned for its fourth season , he acted as patron ( <unk> ) during the first week , and could save and work with eliminated candidates . 
 In September 2011 , Tsamere appeared with On n 'demande qu 'à en rire colleague Jérémy Ferrari in two editions of Ruquier 's late @-@ night talk show On n 'est pas <unk> — however , in what would have been their third week , they decided to quit the show as they thought that " our duo was not the right formula to succeed Jonathan [ Lambert , their predecessor ] " , as well as to concentrate on their " solo projects " . From October 2012 to January 2013 , Tsamere took part in the ONDAR Show , a spin @-@ off of On n 'demande qu 'à en rire in which its best comedians performed without judges in a format similar to American entertainment . However , the show was unpopular with critics — Le Nouvel Observateur 's Xavier Rousseau called it a " failed show " that " dashed hopes " — and the ONDAR Show was cancelled after 13 episodes due to low viewing figures . 
 In 2013 , Tsamere joined the team of beIN Sports ' programme Lunch Time , which was hosted by Darren <unk> . In February 2014 , it was announced that Tsamere would host the TMC game show Canapé Quiz , an adaptation of the American Hollywood Game Night . The show featured two teams , each composed of three celebrities and one member of the public , competing in a series of games . Three weeks later , TMC announced that Canapé Quiz had been cancelled and new episodes were to be moved to a later timeslot because of low viewing figures — 10 days after its launch , it failed to pass 100 @,@ 000 viewers . Discussing the show 's audience in an interview on Europe 1 , Tsamere stated that he did not care about the viewing figures , and also mentioned that he had received positive feedback about the show on Twitter , which he called " quite a revealing thing " . He also stressed that he has fun when filming Canapé Quiz . From 13 July 2015 , Tsamere will present the game show Une famille en or ( the French version of Family Feud and Family Fortunes ) when it returns on TMC ; it was previously presented by Christophe <unk> from 2007 to 2014 on TF1 . Tsamere said " It 's the challenge of taking the reins of a cult programme that interested me " . 
 He has also appeared on various game shows , including Mot de passe and Fort <unk> ( French versions of Million Dollar Password and The Crystal Maze respectively ) , as well as the chat show La nuit nous <unk> on NRJ 12 .

 Tsamere 's style can be described as absurd humour , which according to him " has no hold on current events , politics or religion " . He is a specialist in improvisation . He is known for his " slow burn " technique ( a term coined by On n 'demande qu 'à en rire jury member Jean @-@ Luc Moreau ) , in which he talks about a subject before moving on to another and repeatedly interrupting himself to return to the initial subject . His humour is popular with television audiences , and has boosted On n 'demande qu 'à en rire 's viewing figures . 
 On his website , Tsamere provides a link to that of François Rollin , as well as to that of English comedian Ricky Gervais , whom he calls " my absolute master " . Other role models of his are the brothers Simon and Alexandre Astier — he says of them and Gervais that he " could watch them perform anything " .

 = Malagasy cuisine = 
 Malagasy cuisine encompasses the many diverse culinary traditions of the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar . Foods eaten in Madagascar reflect the influence of Southeast Asian , African , Indian , Chinese and European migrants that have settled on the island since it was first populated by seafarers from Borneo between 100 CE and 500 CE . Rice , the cornerstone of the Malagasy diet , was cultivated alongside tubers and other Southeast Asian staples by these earliest settlers . Their diet was supplemented by foraging and hunting wild game , which contributed to the extinction of the island 's bird and mammal megafauna . These food sources were later complemented by beef in the form of zebu introduced into Madagascar by East African migrants arriving around 1 @,@ 000 CE . Trade with Arab and Indian merchants and European transatlantic traders further enriched the island 's culinary traditions by introducing a wealth of new fruits , vegetables and seasonings . 
 Throughout almost the entire island , the contemporary cuisine of Madagascar typically consists of a base of rice served with an accompaniment ; in the official dialect of the Malagasy language , the rice is termed vary ( [ ˈvarʲ ] ) , and the accompaniment , laoka ( [ <unk> ̥ ] ) . The many varieties of laoka may be vegetarian or include animal proteins , and typically feature a sauce flavored with such ingredients as ginger , onion , garlic , tomato , vanilla , salt , curry powder , or , less commonly , other spices or herbs . In parts of the arid south and west , pastoral families may replace rice with maize , cassava , or curds made from fermented zebu milk . A wide variety of sweet and savory fritters as well as other street foods are available across the island , as are diverse tropical and temperate @-@ climate fruits . Locally produced beverages include fruit juices , coffee , herbal teas and teas , and alcoholic drinks such as rum , wine and beer . 
 The range of dishes eaten in Madagascar in the 21st century offers insight into the island 's unique history and the diversity of the peoples who inhabit it today . The complexity of Malagasy meals can range from the simple , traditional preparations introduced by the earliest settlers , to the refined festival dishes prepared for the island 's 19th @-@ century monarchs . Although the classic Malagasy meal of rice and its accompaniment remains predominant , over the past 100 years other food types and combinations have been popularized by French colonists and immigrants from China and India . Consequently , Malagasy cuisine is traditional while also assimilating newly emergent cultural influences . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Prior to 1650 = = = 
 Austronesian seafarers are believed to have been the first humans to settle on the island , arriving between 100 and 500 CE . In their outrigger canoes they carried food staples from home including rice , plantains , taro , and water yam . Sugarcane , ginger , sweet potatoes , pigs and chickens were also probably brought to Madagascar by these first settlers , along with coconut and banana . The first concentrated population of human settlers emerged along the southeastern coast of the island , although the first landfall may have been made on the northern coast . Upon arrival , early settlers practiced tavy ( swidden , " slash @-@ and @-@ burn " agriculture ) to clear the virgin coastal rainforests for the cultivation of crops . They also gathered honey , fruits , bird and crocodile eggs , mushrooms , edible seeds and roots , and brewed alcoholic beverages from honey and sugar cane juice . 
 Game was regularly hunted and trapped in the forests , including frogs , snakes , lizards , hedgehogs and tenrecs , tortoises , wild boars , insects , larvae , birds and lemurs . The first settlers encountered Madagascar 's wealth of megafauna , including giant lemurs , elephant birds , giant fossa and the Malagasy hippopotamus . Early Malagasy communities may have eaten the eggs and — less commonly — the meat of <unk> maximus , the world 's largest bird , which remained widespread throughout Madagascar as recently as the 17th century . While several theories have been proposed to explain the decline and eventual extinction of Malagasy megafauna , clear evidence suggests that hunting by humans and destruction of habitats through slash @-@ and @-@ burn agricultural practices were key factors . Although it has been illegal to hunt or trade any of the remaining species of lemur since 1964 , these endangered animals continue to be hunted for immediate local consumption in rural areas or to supply the demand for exotic bush meat at some urban restaurants . 
 As more virgin forest was lost to tavy , communities increasingly planted and cultivated permanent plots of land . By 600 CE , groups of these early settlers had moved inland and begun clearing the forests of the central highlands . Rice was originally dry planted or cultivated in marshy lowland areas , which produced low yields . <unk> rice paddies were adopted in the highlands around 1600 , first in Betsileo country in the southern highlands , then later in the northern highlands of Imerina . By the time terraced paddies emerged in central Madagascar over the next century , the area 's original forest cover had largely vanished . In its place were scattered villages ringed with nearby rice paddies and crop fields a day 's walk away , surrounded by vast plains of sterile grasses . 
 Zebu , a form of humped cattle , were introduced to the island around 1000 CE by settlers from east Africa , who also brought sorghum , goats , possibly Bambara groundnut , and other food sources . Because these cattle represented a form of wealth in east African and consequently Malagasy culture , they were eaten only rarely , typically after their ritual sacrifice at events of spiritual import such as funerals . Fresh zebu milk and curds instead constituted a major part of the pastoralists ' diet . Zebu were kept in large herds in the south and west , but as individual herd members escaped and reproduced , a sizable population of wild zebu established itself in the highlands . Merina oral history tells that highland people were unaware that zebu were edible prior to the reign of King Ralambo ( ruled 1575 – 1612 ) , who is credited with the discovery , although archaeological evidence suggests that zebu were occasionally hunted and consumed in the highlands prior to Ralambo 's time . It is more likely that these wild herds were first domesticated and kept in pens during this period , which corresponds with the emergence of complex , structured polities in the highlands . 
 Foods were commonly prepared by boiling in water ( at first using green bamboo as a vessel , and later clay or iron pots ) , roasting over a fire or grilling over hot stones or coals . Fermentation was also used to create curds from milk , develop the flavor of certain dried or fresh tubers or produce alcoholic beverages from honey , sugar cane juice or other local plants . The techniques of sun curing ( drying ) , smoking and salting were used to preserve various foods for transport , trade or future consumption . Many foods prepared in these ways , such as a smoked dried beef called <unk> ( [ <unk> ̥ ] ) and salted dried fish , are still eaten in a similar form in modern @-@ day Madagascar . 
 By the 16th century , centralized kingdoms had emerged on the west coast among the Sakalava and in the Central highlands among the Merina . The Merina sovereigns celebrated the new year with an ancient Merina ceremony called the Royal Bath ( fandroana ) . For this ceremony , a beef confit called jaka ( [ <unk> ̥ ] ) was prepared by placing beef in a decorative clay jar and sealing it with suet , then conserving it in an underground pit for a year . The jaka would be shared with friends at the following year 's festival . As a dessert , revelers would eat rice boiled in milk and drizzled with honey , a preparation known as <unk> ( [ <unk> ̯ ] ) . According to oral history , King Ralambo was the originator of these culinary traditions in Imerina . Ralambo 's father , King Andriamanelo , is credited with introducing the marriage tradition of the vodiondry ( [ <unk> ] ) or " rump of the sheep , " wherein the most favored cut of meat — the hindquarters — was offered by the groom to the parents of the bride @-@ to @-@ be at an engagement ceremony . In contemporary Malagasy society the terminology persists but families are more likely to offer symbolic coins in place of an offering of food . 
 = = = 1650 – 1800 = = = 
 The advent of the trans @-@ Atlantic slave trade increased maritime trade at Malagasy ports , including food products . In 1696 , a trading vessel en route to the American colonies reportedly took a stock of local Malagasy rice to Charleston , South Carolina , where the grain formed the basis of the plantation industry . Trading ships brought crops from the Americas — such as sweet potato , tomato , maize , peanuts , tobacco and lima beans — to Madagascar in the 16th and 17th centuries ; cassava arrived after 1735 from a French colony at nearby Réunion Island . These products were first cultivated in coastal areas nearest to their ports of arrival , but soon spread throughout the island ; within 100 years of their introduction they were widespread throughout the central highlands . Similarly , pineapple and citrus fruits such as lemons , limes , oranges , consumed by sailors to ward off scurvy on long cross @-@ Atlantic trips , were introduced at coastal Malagasy ports . Local cultivation began soon afterward . 
 The prickly pear cactus or <unk> ( [ <unk> ̥ ] ) , also known in southern Madagascar as <unk> @-@ <unk> ( [ <unk> ] ) or " water food " , was brought from the New World to the French settlement at Fort Dauphin in 1769 by Frenchman Count <unk> de <unk> . The plant spread throughout the southern part of the island , where it became a fundamental food crop for Mahafaly and Bara pastoralists . Consuming six or so of the fruits of this plant preempted the need to drink water , and once the spines had been removed , the cladodes of the plant would nourish and hydrate the zebu cattle they tended . The introduction of this plant enabled the southern pastoralists to become more sedentary and efficient herders , thus boosting population density and cattle count in the region . 
 = = = 1800 – 1896 = = = 
 The 18th century in the central highlands was characterized by increasing population density and consequent famines , aggravated by warring among the principalities of Imerina . At the turn of the 19th century , King Andrianampoinimerina ( 1787 – 1810 ) successfully united these fractious Merina groups under his rule , then used slaves and forced labor — exacted in lieu of taxes for those without means to offer material payment — to systematically work the irrigated rice fields around Antananarivo . In this way , he ensured regular grain surpluses that were sufficient to consistently feed the entire population and export products for trade with other regions of the island . Marketplaces were established across the island to serve as central trading points for designated commodities such as smoked and dried seafood and meats , dried maize , salt , dried cassava and various fruits . Rice cakes , including mofo gasy ( [ <unk> ] ) and menakely ( [ <unk> ̥ <unk> ] ) , were also sold by market vendors . By this period , coastal cuisine had likewise evolved : early 19th century voyagers reported eating dishes on Île Sainte @-@ Marie prepared with curry powder ( including a spiced rice resembling biryani ) and drinking coffee and tea . Andrianampoinimerina 's son , Radama I , succeeded in uniting nearly the entire island under his rule , and established the Kingdom of Madagascar . A line of Merina monarchs would continue to govern the island until its colonization by the French in 1896 . 
 Under the Kingdom of Madagascar , plantations were established for the production of crops exported to foreign markets such as England and France . Cloves were imported and planted in 1803 , and coconuts — which had been relatively sparse on the island — were cultivated on plantations for the production of oil . Similarly , coffee had been grown on family plots of four to five trees until the early 19th century , when more intensive cultivation for export began . Vanilla , later to become one of Madagascar 's premiere export crops , was introduced by French entrepreneurs in 1840 and planted in eastern coastal rainforests . The technique of hand pollination , critical to higher vanilla yields , was introduced 30 years later . Nonetheless , vanilla remained a marginal crop until the end of the monarchy . 
 During Merina royal festivals , the <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ( [ <unk> ] ) were eaten . These were seven dishes said to be the most desirable in the realm . Among these dishes were <unk> ( [ <unk> ] , Bambara groundnut ) , <unk> ( [ <unk> ̥ ] , eel ) , <unk> ( [ <unk> ̥ ] , beef tripe ) , <unk> ( [ <unk> ] , grated cassava leaves ) and <unk> ( [ <unk> ̥ ] , turkey ) , each cooked with pork and usually ginger , garlic , onion and tomato ; <unk> ( [ <unk> ̥ ] , a stew of beef and greens ) and <unk> ( [ <unk> ̥ ] , shredded roast beef ) completed the list . Colonization of Madagascar by the French meant the end of the Malagasy monarchy and its elaborate feasts , but the traditions of this elegant cuisine were preserved in the home , where these dishes are eaten regularly . They are also served in many restaurants throughout the island .

 French colonial rule began in 1896 and introduced a number of innovations to local cuisines . Certain new food names derived from the French language — then the dominant language of the state — became widespread . <unk> were popularized among cosmopolitan urbanites , as were a variety of French pastries and desserts such as cream horns , mille @-@ feuille , croissants and chocolat <unk> ( hot chocolate ) . The French also introduced foie gras , now produced locally , and popularized a dish known in the highlands as composé : a cold macaroni salad mixed with blanched vegetables based on the French <unk> de <unk> . The French established plantations for the cultivation of a variety of cash crops , including not only those already exploited in the 19th century , but new foreign fruits , vegetables and livestock , with varying degrees of success . Tea , coffee , vanilla , coconut oil and spices became successful exports . Coconut became a regular ingredient in coastal cuisine , and vanilla began to be used in sauces for poultry and seafood dishes . 
 Although a handful of Chinese settlers had arrived in Madagascar towards the end of the reign of Queen Ranavalona III , the first major influx of Chinese migrants followed an announcement by General Joseph Gallieni , first governor general of the colony of Madagascar , requesting 3 @,@ 000 Chinese laborers to construct a northern rail line between Antananarivo and Toamasina . Chinese migrants introduced a number of dishes that have become part of urban popular cuisine in regions with large Chinese communities , including <unk> <unk> ( Chinese fried rice ) , <unk> <unk> ( Chinese @-@ style noodle soup ) , <unk> ( fried noodles ) , pao ( hum bao ) and nems ( fried egg rolls ) . 
 By the 1880s , a community of roughly 200 Indian traders had been established at Mahajanga , a port on the north @-@ west coast of Madagascar , near <unk> Bay at the mouth of the <unk> River . Thirty years later the population of Indians in Madagascar had increased to over 4 @,@ 000 , concentrated along the trading ports of the northwestern coast . These early Indian communities popularized curries and <unk> throughout the region . <unk> in particular , a dish based on the Indian <unk> , became a specialty of Mahajanga . Indian <unk> ( sambos ) soon became a popular street food in most parts of Madagascar , where they may also be known by the name <unk> <unk> ( [ <unk> ] , " three @-@ cornered snack " ) . 
 While French innovations enriched the cuisine in many ways , not every innovation was favorable . Since the French introduction of the prickly pear cactus in the 18th century , the lifestyle of southern pastoralists became increasingly reliant on the plant to ensure food and water for their zebu as well as fruit and water for themselves during the dry season between July and December . However , in 1925 , a French colonist wishing to eradicate the cactus on his property in the southwestern town of Toliara introduced the cochineal , an insect known to be a parasite of the plant . Within five years , nearly all the prickly pear cactus of southern Madagascar had been completely wiped out , sparking a massive famine from 1930 – 1931 . Although these ethnic groups have since adapted in various ways , the famine period is commonly remembered as the time when their traditional lifestyle was ended by the arrival of foreigners on their land .

 Since Madagascar gained independence from French colonial rule in 1960 , Malagasy cuisine has reflected the island 's diverse cultures and historic influences . Throughout the country , rice is considered the preeminent food and constitutes the main staple of the diet in all but the most arid regions of the south and west . Accompanying dishes served with rice vary regionally according to availability of ingredients and local cultural norms . Outside the home , Malagasy cuisine is served at simple roadside stalls ( <unk> ) or sit @-@ down eateries ( <unk> ) . Snacks and rice @-@ based meals may also be purchased from ambulatory street vendors . <unk> restaurants offer a wider variety of foreign cuisine and Malagasy dishes bearing French and other outside influences in preparation technique , ingredients and presentation alike . 
 = = = Rice ( vary ) = = = 
 Rice ( vary ) is the cornerstone of the Malagasy diet and is typically consumed at every meal . The verb " to eat a meal " in the Malagasy language is commonly <unk> @-@ <unk> – literally , to eat rice . Rice may be prepared with varying amounts of water to produce a fluffy dry rice ( vary <unk> , [ <unk> <unk> ̥ ] ) eaten with some kind of accompaniment ( laoka ) in sauce . It may also be prepared with extra water to produce a soupy rice porridge called vary <unk> ( [ <unk> <unk> ] ) which is typically eaten for breakfast or prepared for the sick . Vary <unk> may be accompanied with a dry laoka such as <unk> , smoked strips of zebu meat . A popular variation , vary <unk> <unk> ( [ ˈvarʲ <unk> ̥ ] ) , is a traditional porridge made with rice , meat and chopped greens . During a highland famadihana ( reburial ceremony ) , a special kind of rice called vary be <unk> ( [ ˈvarʲ <unk> ̥ ] , " rice with much fat " ) is rice served with fatty chunks of beef or preferably , highly fatty chunks of pork .

 The accompaniment served with rice is called laoka in the highlands dialect , the official version of the Malagasy language . <unk> are most often served in some kind of sauce : in the highlands , this sauce is generally tomato @-@ based , while in coastal areas coconut milk is often added during cooking . In the arid southern and western interior where herding zebu is traditional , fresh or curdled zebu milk is often incorporated into vegetable dishes . <unk> are diverse and may include such ingredients as Bambara groundnuts with pork , beef or fish ; <unk> gasy , ( [ <unk> <unk> ] , various freshwater fish ) ; shredded cassava leaves with peanuts , beef or pork ; <unk> <unk> ( [ <unk> ] , beef ) or <unk> ( [ <unk> ] , chicken ) sauteed with ginger and garlic or simmered in its own juices ( a preparation called <unk> [ <unk> ̥ ] ) ; various types of seafood , which are more readily available along the coasts or in large urban centers ; and many more . A variety of local greens such as anamamy ( [ <unk> ] , <unk> greens ) , <unk> ( Malagasy pronunciation : [ <unk> ̯ <unk> ] , Martin greens ) and particularly anamalao ( Malagasy pronunciation : [ <unk> ̯ ] , <unk> ) — distinguished by the mildly analgesic effect the boiled leaves and flowers produce — are commonly sold alongside <unk> ( Malagasy pronunciation : [ <unk> ] , watercress ) and <unk> ( Malagasy pronunciation : [ <unk> ̥ ] , bok <unk> ) . In the arid south and west , such as among the Bara or <unk> peoples , staples include sweet potato , yams , taro root and especially cassava , millet and maize , generally boiled in water and occasionally served in whole milk or flavored with crushed peanuts . 
 Garlic , onions , ginger , tomatoes , mild curry , and salt are the most common ingredients used to flavor dishes , and in coastal areas other ingredients such as coconut milk , vanilla , cloves or turmeric may also be used . A variety of condiments are served on the side and mixed into the rice or laoka according to each individual 's taste rather than mixing them in as the food is being cooked . The most common and basic condiment , <unk> ( [ <unk> ̯ ] ) , is a spicy condiment made from red or green chili pepper . Indian @-@ style condiments made of pickled mango , lemon , and other fruits ( known as <unk> or <unk> [ <unk> ] ) , are a coastal specialty ; in the highlands , <unk> often refers to a salad of green beans , cabbage , carrots and onion in a vinaigrette sauce , popular as a side dish or as the filling of a baguette sandwich . 
 Ro ( [ ru ] , a broth ) may be served as the main laoka or in addition to it to flavor and moisten the rice . Ro @-@ <unk> ( [ <unk> ] ) is a rich and flavorful broth made with beef , tomato and garlic that often accompanies a dry laoka . By contrast , <unk> ( [ <unk> ] ) is a light and relatively flavorless broth made with onion , tomato and anamamy greens served with meat or fatty poultry . Ron @-@ <unk> ( [ <unk> ] ) , a broth made with chicken and ginger , is a home remedy for the common cold , while <unk> ( [ <unk> ̥ ] ) — a broth made with tiny dried shrimp and beef , to which sweet potato leaves and potato are often added — is traditionally eaten by new mothers to support lactation . The national dish is the broth called <unk> , which in its simplest form is made of beef with anamalao , <unk> or anamamy , although ingredients such as tomato , onion and ginger are commonly added to create more complex and flavorful versions . <unk> is distinguished by its inclusion of anamalao flowers , which produce a mild analgesic effect when the broth is consumed . 
 = = = Street foods = = = 
 A variety of cakes and fritters collectively known as mofo ( [ <unk> ] , meaning " bread " ) are available from kiosks in towns and cities across Madagascar . The most common is mofo gasy , meaning " Malagasy bread " , which is made from a batter of sweetened rice flour poured into greased circular molds and cooked over charcoal . Mofo gasy is a popular breakfast food and is often eaten with coffee , also sold at kiosks . In coastal areas this mofo is made with coconut milk and is known as <unk> ( [ <unk> ] ) . Other sweet mofo include a deep @-@ fried doughnut called menakely and a fried dough ball called mofo <unk> ( [ <unk> <unk> ] ) , as well as a variety of fruit fritters , with pineapple and bananas among the most common fruits used . Savory mofo include <unk> ( [ <unk> ̥ ] ) , a mofo gasy salted and fried in lard , and a fritter flavored with chopped greens , onions , tomatoes and chilies called mofo <unk> ( [ <unk> <unk> ̯ ] , meaning " spicy bread " ) . 
 In marketplaces and gas stations one may find vendors selling koba <unk> ( [ <unk> ] ) , a sweet made by wrapping a batter of ground peanuts , mashed bananas , honey and corn flour in banana leaves and steaming or boiling the small cakes until the batter has set . Peanut brittle , dried bananas , balls of tamarind paste rolled in colored sugar , deep @-@ fried wonton @-@ type dough strings called kaka <unk> ( [ kaka <unk> ] , meaning " pigeon droppings " ) also eaten in neighboring Reunion Island , and home @-@ made yogurts , are all commonly sold on the street .

 Traditionally , fresh fruit may be eaten after a meal as a dessert . Fresh sugarcane may also be chewed as a treat . A great variety of temperate and tropical fruits are grown locally and may be enjoyed fresh or sprinkled with sugar . Temperate fruits found in Madagascar include but are not limited to apples , lemons , pumpkins , watermelon , oranges , cherries and strawberries . Among the many tropical fruits commonly eaten in Madagascar are coconut , tamarind , mango , pineapple , avocado , passion fruit , and <unk> , locally called <unk> ( [ <unk> ] ) . <unk> , <unk> , lychees , persimmon and " pok @-@ pok " ( also called <unk> [ <unk> ̥ ] ) , a fruit similar to a <unk> , are common , while on the west coast the fruit of the baobab tree is eaten during the brief period when it becomes available near the end of the rainy season . 
 Madagascar is known for its high @-@ quality cocoa and vanilla , much of which are exported . In the coastal areas of Madagascar or in upscale inland restaurants , vanilla may be used to prepare savory sauces for poultry . 
 <unk> @-@ <unk> ( [ <unk> ̥ ] ) or koba ( [ <unk> ̥ ] ) is a Malagasy specialty made by grinding together peanuts and brown sugar , then enveloping the mixture in a sweetened rice flour paste to produce a cylindrical bundle . The bundle is wrapped in banana leaves and boiled for 24 to 48 hours or longer until the sugar becomes caramelized and the peanuts have softened . The resulting cake is served in thin slices . Bonbon coco is a popular candy made from shredded coconut cooked with caramelized sugar and formed into chewy balls or patties . A firm , cake @-@ like coconut milk pudding known as <unk> @-@ <unk> ( [ <unk> ] ) is a popular dessert also found in Comoros . French pastries and cakes are very popular across the island and may be purchased at the many <unk> found in towns and cities throughout Madagascar .

 <unk> <unk> ( [ <unk> ] ) and <unk> ( [ <unk> ̥ ] ) , are the most common and traditional beverages in Madagascar . Both are names for a drink made by adding hot water to the toasted rice left sticking to the interior of its cooking pot . This drink is a sanitary and tasty alternative to fresh water . 
 In addition , a variety of other drinks are produced locally . Coffee is grown in the eastern part of the island and has become a standard breakfast drink , served black or with sweetened condensed milk at street @-@ side kiosks . Black tea , occasionally flavored with vanilla , and herbal teas — particularly lemongrass and lemon bush ( <unk> <unk> [ <unk> ̥ ] ) — are popular . Juices are made from guava , passion fruit , pineapple , tamarind , baobab and other fruit . Fresh milk , however , is a luxury , and locally produced yogurts , ice creams or sweetened condensed milk mixed with hot water are the most common dairy sources of calcium . Cola and orange soft drinks are produced locally , as is Bonbon Anglais , a local sweet lemon soda . Coca @-@ Cola products are popular and widely consumed throughout the island . 
 Numerous alcoholic beverages are produced for local consumption and limited export . The local <unk> , Three Horses Beer , is popular and ubiquitous . Wine is produced in the southern highlands around Fianarantsoa , and rum ( <unk> gasy [ <unk> ̥ <unk> ] ) is widely produced and can be either drunk neat , flavored with exotic fruits and spices to produce <unk> <unk> , or blended with coconut milk to make a punch coco cocktail . The most traditional form of rum , called <unk> [ <unk> ̥ ] , is made from fermented sugarcane juice . Rum serves a ritual purpose in many parts of Madagascar , where it is traditional to throw the first <unk> of a newly opened bottle of rum into the northeast corner of the room as an offering and gesture of respect to the ancestors . At social gatherings it is common for alcoholic beverages to be accompanied with savory , fried snacks known collectively as <unk> , commonly including pan @-@ fried peanuts , potato chips , nems , sambos and kaka <unk> . 
 = Lōʻihi Seamount = 
 Lōʻihi Seamount ( also known as Loihi ) is an active submarine volcano located about 35 km ( 22 mi ) off the southeast coast of the island of Hawaiʻi . The top of the seamount is about 975 m ( 3 @,@ 000 ft ) below sea level . This seamount lies on the flank of Mauna Loa , the largest shield volcano on Earth . Lōʻihi , meaning " long " in Hawaiian , is the newest volcano in the Hawaiian @-@ Emperor seamount chain , a string of volcanoes that stretches over 5 @,@ 800 km ( 3 @,@ 600 mi ) northwest of Lōʻihi . Unlike most active volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean that make up the active plate margins on the Pacific Ring of Fire , Lōʻihi and the other volcanoes of the Hawaiian @-@ Emperor seamount chain are hotspot volcanoes and formed well away from the nearest plate boundary . Volcanoes in the Hawaiian Islands arise from the Hawaiʻi hotspot , and as the youngest volcano in the chain , Lōʻihi is the only Hawaiian volcano in the deep submarine preshield stage of development . 
 Lōʻihi began forming around 400 @,@ 000 years ago and is expected to begin emerging above sea level about 10 @,@ 000 – 100 @,@ 000 years from now . At its summit , Lōʻihi Seamount stands more than 3 @,@ 000 m ( 10 @,@ 000 ft ) above the seafloor , making it taller than Mount St. Helens was before its catastrophic 1980 eruption . A diverse microbial community resides around Lōʻihi 's many hydrothermal vents . 
 In the summer of 1996 , a swarm of 4 @,@ 070 earthquakes was recorded at Lōʻihi . This series included more earthquakes than any other swarm in Hawaiian recorded history . The swarm altered 10 to 13 square kilometres ( 4 to 5 sq mi ) of the seamount 's summit ; one section , Pele 's Vents , collapsed entirely upon itself and formed the renamed Pele 's Pit . The volcano has remained relatively active since the 1996 swarm and is monitored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) and the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ) . The Hawaii Undersea Geological Observatory ( HUGO ) provided real @-@ time data on Lōʻihi between 1997 and 2002 . Lōʻihi last erupted in 1996 , before the earthquake swarm of that summer .

 Lōʻihi is a seamount , or underwater volcano , on the flank of Mauna Loa , the Earth 's largest shield volcano . It is the newest volcano created by the Hawaiʻi hotspot in the extensive Hawaiian @-@ Emperor seamount chain . The distance between the summit of the older Mauna Loa and the summit of Lōʻihi is about 80 km ( 50 mi ) , which is , coincidentally , also the approximate diameter of the Hawaiʻi hotspot . Lōʻihi consists of a summit area with three pit craters , an 11 km ( 7 mi ) long rift zone extending north from the summit , and a 19 km ( 12 mi ) long rift zone extending south @-@ southeast from the summit . 
 The summit 's pit craters are named West Pit , East Pit , and Pele 's Pit . Pele 's Pit is the youngest of this group and is located at the southern part of the summit . The walls of Pele 's Pit stand 200 m ( 700 ft ) high and were formed in July 1996 when its predecessor , Pele 's Vent , a hydrothermal field near Lōʻihi 's summit , collapsed into a large depression . The thick crater walls of Pele 's Pit — averaging 20 m ( 70 ft ) in width , unusually thick for Hawaiian volcanic craters — suggest its craters have filled with lava multiple times in the past . 
 Lōʻihi 's north – south trending rift zones create a distinctive elongated shape , from which the volcano 's Hawaiian name , meaning " long " , derives . The north rift zone consists of a longer western portion and a shorter eastern rift zone . Observations show that both the north and south rift zones lack sediment cover , indicating recent activity . A bulge in the western part of the north rift zone contains three 60 – 80 m ( 200 – 260 ft ) cone @-@ shaped prominences . 
 Until 1970 , Lōʻihi was thought to be an inactive volcano that had been transported to its current location by sea @-@ floor spreading . The seafloor under Hawaiʻi is 80 – 100 million years old and was created at the East Pacific Rise , an oceanic spreading center where new sea floor forms from magma that erupts from the mantle . New oceanic crust moves away from the spreading center . Over a period of 80 – 100 million years , the sea floor under Hawaiʻi moved from the East Pacific Rise to its present location 6 @,@ 000 km ( 4 @,@ 000 mi ) west , carrying ancient seamounts with it . When scientists investigated a series of earthquakes off Hawaiʻi in 1970 , they discovered that Lōʻihi was an active member of the Hawaiian @-@ Emperor seamount chain . 
 Lōʻihi is built on the seafloor with a slope of about five degrees . Its northern base on the flank of Mauna Loa is 1 @,@ 900 m ( 6 @,@ 200 ft ) below sea level , but its southern base is a more substantial 4 @,@ 755 m ( 15 @,@ 600 ft ) below the surface . Thus , the summit is 931 m ( 3 @,@ 054 ft ) above the seafloor as measured from the base of its north flank , but 3 @,@ 786 m ( 12 @,@ 421 ft ) high when measured from the base of its southern flank . 
 Lōʻihi is following the pattern of development that is characteristic of all <unk> volcanoes . Geochemical evidence from Lōʻihi lavas indicates that Lōʻihi is in transition between the preshield and shield volcano stage , providing valuable clues to the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes . In the preshield stage , Hawaiian volcanoes have steeper sides and a lower level of activity , producing an alkali basalt lava . Continued volcanism is expected to eventually create an island at Lōʻihi . Lōʻihi experiences frequent landslides ; the growth of the volcano has destabilized its slopes , and extensive areas of debris inhabit the steep southeastern face . Similar deposits from other Hawaiian volcanoes indicate that landslide debris is an important product of the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes . Lōʻihi is predicted to rise above the surface in 10 @,@ 000 to 100 @,@ 000 years . 
 = = = Age and growth = = = 
 Radiometric dating was used to determine the age of rock samples from Lōʻihi . The Hawaii Center for Volcanology tested samples recovered by various expeditions , notably the 1978 expedition , which provided 17 dredge samples . Most of the samples were found to be of recent origin ; the oldest dated rock is around 300 @,@ 000 years old . Following the 1996 event , some young breccia was also collected . Based on the samples , scientists estimate Lōʻihi is about 400 @,@ 000 years old . The rock accumulates at an average rate of 3 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 14 in ) per year near the base , and 7 @.@ 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) near the summit . If the data model from other volcanoes such as Kīlauea holds true for Lōʻihi , 40 % of the volcano 's mass formed within the last 100 @,@ 000 years . Assuming a linear growth rate , Lōʻihi is 250 @,@ 000 years old . However , as with all hotspot volcanoes , Lōʻihi 's level of activity has increased with time ; therefore , it would take at least 400 @,@ 000 years for such a volcano to reach Lōʻihi 's mass . As Hawaiian volcanoes drift northwest at a rate of about 10 cm ( 4 in ) a year , Lōʻihi was 40 km ( 25 mi ) southeast of its current position at the time of its initial eruption . 
 = = Activity = = 
 Lōʻihi is a young and fairly active volcano , although less active than nearby Kīlauea . In the past few decades , several earthquake swarms have been attributed to Lōʻihi , the largest of which are summarized in the table below . The volcano 's activity is now known to predate scientific record keeping of its activity , which commenced in 1959 . Most earthquake swarms at Lōʻihi have lasted less than two days ; the two exceptions are the 1991 – 92 earthquake , lasting several months , and the 1996 event , which was shorter but much more pronounced . Both of the earthquakes followed a pattern of activity that began on the flank and migrated to the summit . The 1996 event was directly observed by an autonomous ocean bottom observatory ( OBO ) , allowing scientists to calculate the depth of the earthquakes as 6 km ( 4 mi ) to 8 km ( 5 mi ) below the summit , approximating to the position of Lōʻihi 's extremely shallow magma chamber . This is evidence that Lōʻihi 's seismicity is volcanic in origin . 
 The low @-@ level seismic activity documented on Lōʻihi since 1959 has shown that between two and ten earthquakes per month are traceable to the summit . Earthquake swarm data have been used to analyze how well Lōʻihi 's rocks propagate seismic waves and to investigate the relationship between earthquakes and eruptions . This low level activity is periodically punctuated by large swarms of earthquakes , each swarm comprising up to hundreds of earthquakes . The majority of the earthquakes are not distributed close to the summit , though they follow a north – south trend . Rather , most of the earthquakes occur in the southwest portion of Lōʻihi . The largest recorded swarms took place on Lōʻihi in 1971 , 1972 , 1975 , 1991 – 92 and 1996 . The nearest seismic station is around 30 km ( 20 mi ) from Lōʻihi , on the south coast of Hawaiʻi . Seismic events that have a magnitude under 2 are recorded often , but their location cannot be determined precisely as it can for larger events . In fact , HUGO ( Hawaiʻi Undersea Geological Observatory ) , positioned on Lōʻihi 's flank , detected ten times as many earthquakes as were recorded by the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory ( HVO ) seismic network . 
 = = = 1996 earthquake swarm = = = 
 The largest amount of activity recorded for the Lōʻihi seamount was a swarm of 4 @,@ 070 earthquakes between July 16 and August 9 , 1996 . This series of earthquakes was the largest recorded for any Hawaiian volcano to date in both amount and intensity . Most of the earthquakes had moment magnitudes of less than 3 @.@ 0 . " Several hundred " had a magnitude greater than 3 @.@ 0 , including more than 40 greater than 4 @.@ 0 and a 5 @.@ 0 tremor . 
 The final two weeks of the earthquake swarm were observed by a quick response cruise launched in August 1996 . The National Science Foundation funded an expedition by University of Hawaiʻi scientists , led by Frederick <unk> , that began investigating the swarm and its origin in August 1996 . The scientists ' assessment laid the groundwork for many of the expeditions that followed . Follow @-@ up expeditions to Lōʻihi took place , including a series of manned @-@ submersible dives in August and September . These were supplemented by a great deal of shore @-@ based research . Fresh rock collected during the expedition revealed that an eruption occurred before the earthquake swarm . 
 Submersible dives in August were followed by NOAA @-@ funded research in September and October 1996 . These more detailed studies showed the southern portion of Lōʻihi 's summit had collapsed , a result of a swarm of earthquakes and the rapid withdrawal of magma from the volcano . A crater 1 km ( 0 @.@ 6 mi ) across and 300 m ( 1 @,@ 000 ft ) deep formed out of the rubble . The event involved the movement of 100 million cubic meters of volcanic material . A region of 10 to 13 km2 ( 4 to 5 sq mi ) of the summit was altered and populated by bus @-@ sized pillow lava blocks , precariously perched along the outer rim of the newly formed crater . " Pele 's Vents , " an area on the southern side , previously considered stable , collapsed completely into a giant pit , renamed " Pele 's Pit " . Strong currents make submersible diving hazardous in the region . 
 The researchers were continually met by clouds of sulfide and sulfate . The sudden collapse of Pele 's Vents caused a large discharge of hydrothermal material . The presence of certain indicator minerals in the mixture suggested temperatures exceeded 250 ° C , a record for an underwater volcano . The composition of the materials was similar to that of black smokers , the hydrothermal vent plumes located along mid @-@ ocean ridges . Samples from mounds built by discharges from the hydrothermal plumes resembled white smokers . 
 The studies demonstrated that the most volcanically and hydrothermally active area was along the southern rift . Dives on the less active northern rim indicated that the terrain was more stable there , and high lava columns were still standing upright . A new hydrothermal vent field ( Naha Vents ) was located in the upper @-@ south rift zone , at a depth of 1 @,@ 325 m ( 4 @,@ 350 ft ) .

 Lōʻihi has remained largely quiet since the 1996 event ; no activity was recorded from 2002 to 2004 . The seamount showed signs of life again in 2005 by generating an earthquake bigger than any previously recorded there . USGS @-@ <unk> ( Advanced National Seismic System ) reported two earthquakes , magnitudes 5 @.@ 1 and 5 @.@ 4 , on May 13 and July 17 . Both originated from a depth of 44 km ( 27 mi ) . On April 23 , a magnitude 4 @.@ 3 earthquake was recorded at a depth of approximately 33 km ( 21 mi ) . Between December 7 , 2005 , and January 18 , 2006 , a swarm of around 100 earthquakes occurred , the largest measuring 4 on the Moment magnitude scale and 12 km ( 7 mi ) to 28 km ( 17 mi ) deep . Another earthquake measuring 4 @.@ 7 was later recorded approximately midway between Lōʻihi and Pāhala ( on the south coast of the island of Hawaiʻi ) .

 Lōʻihi Seamount 's first depiction on a map was on Survey Chart <unk> , a bathymetric rendering of part of Hawaiʻi compiled by the US Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1940 . At the time , the seamount was non @-@ notable , being one of many in the region . A large earthquake swarm first brought attention to it in 1952 . That same year , geologist Gordon A. MacDonald hypothesized that the seamount was actually an active submarine shield volcano , similar to the two active Hawaiian volcanoes , Mauna Loa and Kīlauea . Macdonald 's hypothesis placed the seamount as the newest volcano in the Hawaiian @-@ Emperor seamount chain , created by the Hawaiʻi hotspot . However , because the earthquakes were oriented east – west ( the direction of the volcanic fault ) and there was no volcanic tremor in seismometers distant from the seamount , Macdonald attributed the earthquake to faulting rather than a volcanic eruption . 
 Geologists suspected the seamount could be an active undersea volcano , but without evidence the idea remained speculative . The volcano was largely ignored after the 1952 event , and was often mislabeled as an " older volcanic feature " in subsequent charts . Geologist Kenneth O. Emery is credited with naming the seamount in 1955 , describing the long and narrow shape of the volcano as Loihi . The Hawaiian word <unk> means " long " . In 1978 , an expedition studied intense , repeated seismic activity known as earthquake swarms in and around the Lōʻihi area . Rather than finding an old , extinct seamount , data collected revealed Lōʻihi to be a young , possibly active volcano . Observations showed the volcano to be encrusted with young and old lava flows . Fluids erupting from active hydrothermal vents were also found . 
 In 1978 , a US Geological Survey research ship collected dredge samples and photographed Lōʻihi 's summit with the goal of studying whether Lōʻihi is active . Analysis of the photos and testing of pillow lava rock samples appeared to show that the material was " fresh " , yielding more evidence that Lōʻihi is still active . An expedition from October 1980 to January 1981 collected further dredge samples and photographs , providing additional confirmation . Studies indicated that the eruptions came from the southern part of the rift crater . This area is closest to the Hawaiʻi hotspot , which supplies Lōʻihi with magma . Following a 1986 seismic event , a network of five ocean bottom observatories ( OBOs ) were deployed on Lōʻihi for a month . Lōʻihi 's frequent seismicity makes it an ideal candidate for seismic study through OBOs . In 1987 , the submersible DSV Alvin was used to survey Lōʻihi . Another autonomous observatory was positioned on Lōʻihi in 1991 to track earthquake swarms . 
 = = = 1996 to present = = = 
 The bulk of information about Lōʻihi comes from dives made in response to the 1996 eruption . In a dive conducted almost immediately after seismic activity was reported , visibility was greatly reduced by high concentrations of displaced minerals and large floating mats of bacteria in the water . The bacteria that feed on the dissolved nutrients had already begun colonizing the new hydrothermal vents at Pele 's Pit ( formed from the collapse of the old ones ) , and may be indicators of the kinds of material ejected from the newly formed vents . They were carefully sampled for further analysis in a laboratory . An OBO briefly sat on the summit before a more permanent probe could be installed . 
 Repeated multibeam bathymetric mapping was used to measure the changes in the summit following the 1996 collapse . Hydrothermal plume surveys confirmed changes in the energy , and dissolved minerals emanating from Lōʻihi . Hawaiʻi Undersea Research Laboratory , <unk> 's 2 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 562 ft ) submersible Pisces V allowed scientists to sample the vent waters , microorganisms and hydrothermal mineral deposits . 
 In 1997 , scientists from the University of Hawaiʻi installed an ocean bottom observatory ( OBO ) on the summit of Lōʻihi Seamount . The submarine observatory was nicknamed HUGO , ( Hawaiʻi Undersea Geological Observatory ) . HUGO was connected to the shore , 34 km ( 21 mi ) away , by a fiber optic cable . It gave scientists real @-@ time seismic , chemical and visual data about the state of Lōʻihi , which had by then become an international laboratory for the study of undersea volcanism . The cable that provided HUGO with power and communications broke in October 1998 , effectively shutting it down . On January 19 of the following year , HUGO was visited by Pisces V. The observatory functioned for four years before it went dead again in 2002 . 
 Since 2006 , the Fe @-@ <unk> Microbial Observatory ( <unk> ) , funded by the National Science Foundation and Microbial Observatory Program , has led cruises to Lōʻihi investigate its microbiology every October . The first cruise , on the ship R / V Melville and exploiting the submersible <unk> , lasted from September 22 to October 9 . These cruises study the large number of Fe @-@ oxidizing bacteria that have colonized Lōʻihi . Lōʻihi 's extensive vent system is characterized by a high concentration of CO2 and Iron , while being low in sulfide . These characteristics make a perfect environment for iron @-@ oxidizing bacteria , called <unk> , to thrive in .

 Lōʻihi 's mid @-@ Pacific location and its well @-@ sustained hydrothermal system contribute to a rich oasis for a microbial ecosystem . Areas of extensive hydrothermal venting are found on Lōʻihi 's crater floor and north slope , and along the summit of Lōʻihi itself . Active hydrothermal vents were first discovered at Lōʻihi in the late 1980s . These vents are remarkably similar to those found at the mid @-@ ocean ridges , with similar composition and thermal differences . The two most prominent vent fields are at the summit : Pele 's Pit ( formally Pele 's Vents ) and Kapo 's Vents . They are named after the Hawaiian deity Pele and her sister Kapo . These vents were considered " low temperature vents " because their waters were only about 30 ° C. The volcanic eruption of 1996 and the creation of Pele 's Pit changed this , and initiated high temperature venting ; exit temperatures were measured at 77 ° C in 1996 . 
 = = = Microorganisms = = = 
 The vents lie 1 @,@ 100 m ( 3 @,@ 600 ft ) to 1 @,@ 325 m ( 4 @,@ 347 ft ) below the surface , and range in temperature from 10 to over 200 ° C. The vent fluids are characterized by a high concentration of CO 
 2 ( up to 17 mM ) and Fe ( Iron ) , but low in sulfide . Low oxygen and pH levels are important factors in supporting the high amounts of Fe ( iron ) , one of the hallmark features of Lōʻihi . These characteristics make a perfect environment for iron @-@ oxidizing bacteria , called <unk> , to thrive in . An example of these species is <unk> <unk> , sole member of the class <unk> . The composition of the materials was similar to that of black smokers , that are a habitat of archaea extremophiles . Dissolution and oxidation of the mineral observed over the next two years suggests the sulfate is not easily preserved . 
 A diverse community of microbial mats surround the vents and virtually cover Pele 's Pit . The Hawaiʻi Undersea Research Laboratory ( <unk> ) , NOAA 's Research Center for Hawaiʻi and the Western Pacific , monitors and researches the hydrothermal systems and studies the local community . The National Science Foundation ( NSF ) funded an extremophile sampling expedition to Lōʻihi in 1999 . Microbial mats surrounded the 160 ° C vents , and included a novel jelly @-@ like organism . Samples were collected for study at NSF 's Marine <unk> Engineering Center ( <unk> ) . In 2001 , Pisces V collected samples of the organisms and brought them to the surface for study . 
 NOAA 's National Undersea Research Center and NSF 's Marine <unk> Engineering Center are cooperating to sample and research the local bacteria and archaea extremophiles . The fourth <unk> ( Fe @-@ <unk> Microbial Observatory ) cruise occurred during October 2009 .

 Marine life inhabiting the waters around Lōʻihi is not as diverse as life at other , less active seamounts . Fish found living near Lōʻihi include the Celebes monkfish ( <unk> <unk> ) , and members of the Cutthroat eel family , <unk> . Invertebrates identified in the area include two species endemic to the hydrothermal vents , a <unk> shrimp ( <unk> <unk> ) of the family <unk> ( described in 1995 ) , and a tube or <unk> worm . Dives conducted after the 1996 earthquake swarms were unable to find either the shrimp or the worm , and it is not known if there are lasting effects on these species . 
 From 1982 to 1992 , researchers in Hawaiʻi Undersea Research Laboratory submersibles photographed the fish of Lōʻihi Seamount , Johnston Atoll , and Cross Seamount at depths between 40 m ( 130 ft ) and 2 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) . A small number of species identified at Lōʻihi were newly recorded sightings in Hawaiʻi , including the <unk> <unk> ( <unk> fimbriatus ) , and the Celebes monkfish . 
 = Lise Tréhot = 
 Lise Tréhot ( 14 March 1848 – 12 March 1922 ) was a French art model who posed for artist Pierre @-@ Auguste Renoir from 1866 until 1872 , during his early Salon period . She appeared in more than twenty paintings , including notable works such as Lise ( 1867 ) and In Summer ( 1868 ) , and she was the model for almost all of Renoir 's work featuring female figures at this time . Tréhot married Georges Briere de l 'Isle in 1883 and raised four children to whom she bequeathed two of Renoir 's paintings , Lise Sewing ( 1867 – 68 ) and Lise With a White Shawl ( 1872 ) , both of which are currently held by the Dallas Museum of Art . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Lise Tréhot was born in <unk> , Seine @-@ et @-@ Oise , France , on 14 March 1848 , to Louis Tréhot and Amelie Elisabeth Boudin . Her father was the postmaster of the town until the mid @-@ 1850s , after which he moved the entire family to Paris where he sold lemonade and tobacco . She was the fourth in a family of six children , including three brothers and two sisters . A document from this time describes Tréhot 's profession as a dressmaker . Clémence Tréhot , her older sister , was the lover of artist Jules Le Coeur , who later introduced her to Pierre @-@ Auguste Renoir at his house in <unk> , possibly in June 1865 . 
 = = Modeling period = = 
 Tréhot began modeling for Renoir when she was about eighteen and he was twenty @-@ five . Early paintings of Tréhot at this time include Lise in a Straw Hat ( 1866 ) and Lise Sewing ( 1867 – 68 ) . Renoir painted a modern nude of Tréhot as Diana ( 1867 ) , but it was rejected by the Salon of 1867 . Renoir found critical success the next year with Lise ( 1867 ) , which was well received at the Salon of 1868 . The Impressionist painting depicts Tréhot in a life @-@ size portrait , strolling through a wooded park as sunlight falls through the trees . Art critic Zacharie Astruc described Tréhot in Lise as " the likeable Parisian girl in the woods " , and as a working @-@ class girl . Émile Zola also approved , comparing Tréhot to Monet 's model and later wife Camille Doncieux . French art critic Théodore Duret later observed that because Renoir 's Lise was derivative of Gustave Courbet 's technique , its appearance at the Salon " provoked no definite opposition " . However , Renoir 's decision to shadow Tréhot 's face in darkness and emphasize the reflection of sunlight from her white dress in Lise led several critics to ridicule Tréhot 's appearance due to the unusual contrast . 
 At the Salon of 1869 , Tréhot appeared in a work named In Summer ( 1868 ) , dressed casually in a loose blouse falling off her shoulders . John Collins notes that Tréhot 's " dark , heavy @-@ set and expressionless features " worked well in such portraits , but were less successful in more formal , costume @-@ oriented paintings such as The Engaged Couple ( 1868 ) , where she poses with artist Alfred Sisley . In the summer of 1869 , she accompanied Renoir to his parent 's house in the Ville @-@ d 'Avray , and made trips to the Seine near Bougival where Renoir painted scenes with Monet on the water . La Barque ( 1870 ) is thought to depict Lise during this summer holiday . 
 In total , Tréhot appeared in more than twenty paintings by Renoir during his early Salon period from approximately 1866 until 1872 . According to art historian John House , " Lise was the model for virtually all of Renoir 's female figures at this time " . 
 Although little is known about the exact nature of Tréhot 's relationship with Renoir while she was modeling ; she is said to have given birth to a baby boy named Pierre on 14 December 1868 , but it is unclear what became of him and he may have died as an infant . On 21 July 1870 , Tréhot gave birth to a baby girl named Jeanne ( d . 1934 ) who was given to a wet nurse to raise as her own . Renoir continued to secretly support Jeanne financially until he died ( and after his death with the help of Ambroise Vollard ) , but never publicly or legally acknowledged that she was his daughter during his lifetime . 
 For unknown reasons , Tréhot stopped modeling for Renoir after 1872 ; it was said that she never spoke to or saw him again . Although Tréhot was an important part of Renoir 's early career , he never mentioned her in any published interviews , memoirs , or biographies . 
 = = Later life = = 
 In 1883 , more than a decade after Tréhot stopped modeling for Renoir , she married architect Georges Briere de l 'Isle ( 1847 – 1902 ) , As the wife of Brière de l 'Isle , she raised two sons and two daughters . Tréhot bequeathed two of Renoir 's paintings , Lise Sewing ( 1867 – 68 ) and Lise With a White Shawl ( 1872 ) , to her children . It is said that before her death , she destroyed many of her personal papers related to her time modeling for Renoir . Tréhot died in Paris on 12 March 1922 , at the age of 73 . She is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery . 
 = = Selected works as model = = 
 Tréhot 's list of selected works includes at least twenty @-@ five oil on canvas paintings , twenty @-@ three of which were painted by Renoir , while two are by Frédéric Bazille ( 1841 – 1870 ) . It is thought that Tréhot may have posed for as many as twenty @-@ three works for Renoir , but only once for Bazille ; Renoir 's Landscape with Two People ( 1866 ) , in which she appeared , has either been lost or destroyed , but is believed to have been preserved as a painting within a painting in Bazille 's Studio ( 1870 ) . Bazille 's work is the only known surviving image of the full painting ; a surviving fragment of the work has been identified , but its location is unknown . Tréhot is believed to have posed for La <unk> ( 1869 – 70 ) , another work by Bazille .

 Longyearbyen ( Norwegian pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ( lit . The Longyear Town ) is the largest settlement and the administrative centre of Svalbard , Norway . As of December 2015 , the town had a population of 2 @,@ 144 . Longyearbyen is located in the Longyear Valley and on the shore of Adventfjorden , a bay of Isfjorden located on the west coast of Spitsbergen . Since 2002 , Longyearbyen Community Council has had many of the same responsibilities of a municipality , including utilities , education , cultural facilities , fire brigade , roads and ports . The town is the seat of the Governor of Svalbard . It is the world 's northernmost settlement of any kind with greater than 1 @,@ 000 permanent residents . 
 Known as Longyear City until 1926 , the town was established by and named after John Munro Longyear , whose Arctic Coal Company started coal mining operations in 1906 . Operations were taken over by Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani ( SNSK ) in 1916 , which still conducts mining . The town was almost completely destroyed by the German Kriegsmarine on 8 August 1943 , but was rebuilt after the Second World War . Traditionally , Longyearbyen was a company town , but most mining operations have moved to Sveagruva since the 1990s , while the town has seen a large increase in tourism and research . This has seen the arrival of institutions such as the University Centre in Svalbard , the Svalbard Global Seed Vault and Svalbard Satellite Station . The community is served by Svalbard Airport , Longyear and Svalbard Church .

 In 1896 , <unk> Dampskibsselskab started tours to Hotellneset . To accommodate tourists , they built a prefabricated hotel , but it was not profitable and was closed after the 1897 season . However , two families overwintered in 1898 – 99 and Norway Post operated a post office at Hotellneset from 1897 to 1899 . The first commercially viable coal on Svalbard was harvested by Søren <unk> in 1899 . In 1901 , Bergen @-@ Spitsbergen <unk> @-@ <unk> started mining coal in <unk> . 
 The American industrialist John Munroe Longyear visited Spitsbergen as a tourist in 1901 , where he met with an expedition prospecting for coal . He returned to Spitsbergen 1903 , where he met Henrik B. Næss in Adventfjorden , who gave him samples and information on coal fields . Along with his associate Frederick Ayer , Longyear bought the Norwegian claims on the west side of Adventfjorden , and expanded the claims significantly the following year . In 1906 , the Boston @-@ based Arctic Coal Company , with Ayer and Longyear as the main shareholders , started mining in Mine 1a , after having built docks and housing . The company had American administration , but mostly Norwegian labourers , and named the town Longyear City . Coal was transported the 1 @.@ 2 kilometers ( 0 @.@ 75 mi ) from the mine to the port using an aerial tramway . In 1913 , the company started preliminary work to open Mine 2a . 
 Following financial difficulties during the First World War , the mining operations were bought by Store Norske , which was incorporated in Oslo on 30 November 1916 . That year , SNSK built five new barracks , including one that was made into a hospital . SNSK introduced its own money with approval from Norges Bank , consisting entirely of banknotes at par with Norwegian krone . The American community buried their dead at Hotellneset . In 1918 , eleven people were killed by the Spanish flu and a graveyard was established in Longyear City . Two years later , 26 men were killed in a coal dust explosion in Mine 1 . This resulted in the mine being closed and electric operation being taken into use in Mine 2 . The same year , the first truck was delivered for use in the mining operations . 
 The Church of Norway appointed <unk> Østenstad as Svalbard 's first vicar and teacher in 1920 . A school was established as a cooperation between the church and SNSK and had an inaugural eight pupils . The first Svalbard Church opened on 28 August 1921 , and the church 's reading room was from then used as a school . Longyear City was renamed Longyearbyen in 1926 . 
 The Norwegian Telecommunications Administration established a coast radio station , Svalbard Radio , at <unk> in 1911 , which was moved to Longyearbyen in 1930 . The town 's tourist industry started in 1935 , when SS Lyngen started calling regularly during the summer season . In 1937 , SNSK established Sverdrupbyen to house workers for Mine 1b and operation of the mine started in 1939 . In 1938 , Longyearbyen 's first road was completed , between the town center and Sverdrupbyen . Operations at Mine 2b , a different entrance to Mine 2a , started in 1939 . 
 Svalbard remained unaffected by the German occupation of Norway in 1940 . However , from 1941 the archipelago became of strategic importance in the supply chain between the Allied powers , as well as a source of badly needed coal . The Norwegian government @-@ in @-@ exile rejected a Soviet – British occupation ; instead the British Army started Operation Gauntlet to evacuate Spitsbergen . On 29 August 1941 , the entire population of Ny @-@ Ålesund was evacuated to Longyearbyen , and on 3 September 765 people were evacuated from Longyearbyen to Scotland . Later the last 150 men were also evacuated . With Longyearbyen depopulated , a small German garrison and air strip was established in Adventdalen , mostly to provide meteorological data . After the British Operation <unk> regained control of Barentsburg , the German forces left Longyearbyen without combat . 
 In September 1943 , the Kriegsmarine dispatched two battleships , Tirpitz and Scharnhorst , and nine destroyers to bombard Longyearbyen , Barentsburg and Grumant . Only four buildings in Longyearbyen survived : the hospital , the power station , an office building and a residential building , in addition to Sverdrupbyen . Longyearbyen remained unsettled until the end of the war , with the first ship from the mainland leaving on 27 June 1945 .

 Plans were laid during the war to ensure a quick reconstruction and commencing of mining . By 1948 , coal production reached the pre @-@ war level of 480 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 470 @,@ 000 long tons ; 530 @,@ 000 short tons ) per year . Nybyen was established in 1946 and consisted of five barracks , each housing 72 people . The first issue of Svalbardposten was published in November 1948 . Until then , there had irregularly been published various wall newspapers . In 1949 , Longyearbyen received telephone service with the mainland via a radio connection between Svalbard Radio and Harstad . In 1949 , a farm was built in Longyearbyen to hold cattle for milk , pigs and hens . A local radio station started broadcasting in 1950 . The burial ground remained in use until 1950 , seeing 44 people buried . However , it was discovered that the bodies were failing to decompose because of the permafrost . Bodies have since been sent to the mainland for burial . The community center Huset opened in 1951 . 
 Mining in Mine 1b was terminated in 1958 , but operation in Mine 5 started the following year . Preliminary work on Mine 4 started in 1954 , and from 1960 it was used as a reserve mine . The Norwegian Air Force started serving Longyearbyen with postal flights in the 1950s . In 1959 , a man fell seriously ill , so a landing strip was prepared in Adventdalen . From the same year , Braathens SAFE started serving the tundra airport with irregular winter flights . In 1957 , a principal was hired at the primary school and a new church was opened on 24 August 1958 . From 1961 , the primary school was supplemented by a private middle school . A branch of Tromsø Sparebank opened in 1959 . 
 In the 1960s , the town 's farm was closed and replaced by industrial <unk> of powdered milk . The first serial @-@ produced snowmobile was taken into use in 1961 . By 1969 , there were 140 registered snowmobiles and only 33 registered cars . From 1962 to 1984 , a recreational centre was run at Sverdrupbyen . Ordinary operation in Mine 4 started in 1966 but was terminated by 1970 , two years after Mine 2b closed . Operations in Mine 6 commenced in 1969 . Television broadcasting equipment was installed in 1969 , with the schedule of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation being aired with a two @-@ week delay . 
 In 1971 , a new school building , with a combined primary and lower secondary school , was opened , along with a new gymnasium and a 12 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 41 ft ) swimming pool . The Svalbard Council was established on 1 November 1971 . It consisted of 17 non @-@ partisan members that were elected or appointed in three different groups — SNSK employees , government employees and others , although the ratio changed several times . Operations of Mine 3 started in March 1971 and operations in Mine 7 commenced the following year . In 1973 , the Ministry of Trade and Industry bought a third of SNSK . It continued buying additional shares until reaching a 99 @.@ 94 percent ownership in 1976 . The airport was opened in 1975 and initially provided four weekly services to mainland Norway and semi @-@ weekly services to Russia . In 1978 , the community received satellite communications with the mainland . The same year , an upper secondary program was introduced at the public school . From 1984 , television programmes were broadcast live via satellite . 
 Store Norske underwent a gradual change during the 1980s . Since 1980 , Spitsbergen money has been taken out of circulation and replaced with ordinary Norwegian currency . Mine 6 closed the following year . From 1982 , SNSK permitted private individuals to own and operate cars . By 1990 , there were 353 registered cars and 883 <unk> . On 1 July 1983 , SNSK moved its head office from Bergen to Longyearbyen . Svalbard Samfunnsdrift ( SSD ) , a limited company that was responsible for public infrastructure and services , was established by SNSK on 1 January 1989 . Responsibilities included healthcare , the fire brigade , the kindergarten , roads , rubbish disposal , power production , the water and sewer system , the cinema , cultural actives and the library . Ownership was taken over by the Ministry of Trade and Industry on 1 January 1993 . 
 During the 1990s , the authorities started a process to " normalise " Longyearbyen by abolishing the company town scheme and introducing a full range of services , a varied economy and local democracy . Commercial enterprises included a shopping mall replacing SNSK 's provision store in 1992 . Similarly , Esso opened a commercial fuel station in 1994 . The Svalbard Council changed its regulations from 1993 and allowed parties to run for election . In a step to increase tourism , Svalbard Polar Hotel opened in 1995 , and a year later mining of Mine 3 terminated . Longyearbyen Community Council was established in 2002 , replacing the Svalbard Council and assimilating SSD , and took on many of the responsibilities and the structure of a municipality . 
 This period also saw the rise of a number of scientific establishments . The Agricultural University of Norway had established a primitive seed bank in 1984 . The University Centre in Svalbard opened on 6 September 1993 and had 30 students in its inaugural semester . Telenor Mobil established GSM coverage in 1995 , and in 2004 the Svalbard Undersea Cable System opened , providing fiber optic cable connection to the mainland . The European <unk> Scatter Scientific Association ( EISCAT ) opened a radar in 1996 , followed by Svalbard Satellite Station in 1999 and the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in 2008 .

 Longyearbyen , the largest settlement in Svalbard , is located in the lower portion of the Longyear Valley , along the Longyear River . The lower parts of the town lie along the southwestern shore of the bay of Adventfjorden , a 7 by 4 kilometers ( 4 @.@ 3 by 2 @.@ 5 mi ) branch of Isfjorden . Longyearbyen is on the Nordenskiöld Land peninsula of Spitsbergen , the largest island of the Svalbard archipelago . It is the world 's northern @-@ most town , with all settlements further north being research or meteorological outposts . Across the bay lie the ghost towns of Advent City and <unk> . 
 Longyearbyen is divided into several neighbourhoods . On the west side of the river , along the bay , lies the port and affiliated utility and industrial services . The western part of this area is called <unk> and the eastern part <unk> . Above lies <unk> , the site of the Governor 's offices . Slightly up the valley on the west side lies Gamle Longyearbyen ( " Old Longyearbyen " ) and the church . Even further up lies the graveyard , then Huset and the cinema , and finally Sverdrupbyen . Most of the residential , commercial and cultural institutions are located on the east side of the river . Along the bay the area is called <unk> . Further up lies the university centre and <unk> , the largest residential area . Southwards from there is the main shopping area as well as the town hall . To the east is the residential area Lia and further up Haugen , which is also the location of the school . Furthest up in the valley is Mine 2b and Nybyen , which is mostly used as student housing . Westwards out of town towards Hotellneset is the airport and Mine 3 . The remaining mines are located in Adventdalen , to the east of town . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Svalbard 's climate is a combination of an Arctic climate ( Köppen : ET ) tempered by the North Atlantic Current . Nordenskiöld Land is the warmest and wettest part of the archipelago , caused by the convergence of mild and humid air from the south and cold air from the north . Average summer highs are typically 3 to 7 ° C ( 37 to 45 ° F ) while average winter highs are − 11 to − 13 ° C ( 12 to 9 ° F ) . Longyearbyen experiences midnight sun from 19 April to 23 August , polar night from 27 October to 14 February and civil polar night from 14 November to 29 January . However , due to shading from mountains , the sun is not visible in Longyearbyen until around 8 March . Snow typically covers the town from November to March . The warmest temperature ever recorded in Longyearbyen was 21 @.@ 3 ° C ( 70 @.@ 3 ° F ) in July 1979 and the coldest was − 46 @.@ 3 ° C ( − 51 @.@ 3 ° F ) in March 1986 . Svalbard and Longyearbyen are among the places in the world that have warmed fastest in the latest decades . The average temperatures in the table below are based on 1961 @-@ 90 .

 As of 2015 , Longyearbyen had a population of 2 @,@ 144 people . The largest regional group of Norwegians are from Northern Norway , particularly Nordland and Troms , which make more than 40 percent of the population . Roughly 300 people ( 16 percent ) are non @-@ Norwegian citizens , with the largest nationalities being from Thailand , Sweden , Russia and Ukraine . Because of the dominance of the mining industry , the gender distribution is skewed with 60 percent of adults being males . Longyearbyen has an over @-@ average share of its population between 25 and 44 years old , but nearly no residents over 66 . The number of children in relation to the population is at the national average , but Longyearbyen has significantly fewer teenagers than the national average . 
 Longyearbyen experiences a very high turnover ; in 2008 , 427 people ( 23 percent ) moved away from the town . The average person lived in Longyearbyen for 6 @.@ 3 years , although it is 6 @.@ 6 years for Norwegians and 4 @.@ 3 years for foreigners . In 2009 , about a quarter of the population had lived in the town since before 2000 , and can thus be regarded as permanent population . The longest residing people tend to work in the mining industry , followed by local government employees . The shortest tenures are held by students and employees in higher education , tourism and the state . 
 Seventy percent of households consist of a single person , compared to forty @-@ one percent on the mainland , giving an average 1 @.@ 6 people per household . The difference is largely caused by persons working on Svalbard while their family remains on the mainland . Longyearbyen 's population is more highly educated than the national average : 54 compared to 43 percent have upper secondary education and 30 compared to 26 percent have tertiary education . Among women , 40 percent have higher education .

It operates three kindergartens in addition to the 13 @-@ grade Longyearbyen School . 
 No care or nursing services and welfare payments are available . Norwegian residents retain pension and medical rights through their mainland municipalities . The University Hospital of North Norway operates a clinic , Longyearbyen Hospital . Other public offices with presence on Longyearbyen are the Norwegian Directorate of Mining , the Norwegian Polar Institute , the Norwegian Tax Administration and the Church of Norway . Longyearbyen is subordinate Nord @-@ Troms District Court and Hålogaland Court of Appeal , both located in Tromsø . 
 The Svalbard Treaty of 1920 established full Norwegian sovereignty over the archipelago . The treaty came into effect in 1925 , following the Svalbard Act that established the institution of the Governor of Svalbard . She or he holds the responsibility as both county governor and chief of police , as well as holding other authority granted from the executive branch . Duties include environmental policy , family law , law enforcement , search and rescue , tourism management , information services , contact with foreign settlements and judge in some areas of maritime inquiries and judicial examinations — albeit never in the same cases as acting as police . <unk> <unk> has been governor since 2015 ; she is assisted by a staff of 26 professionals . The institution is subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and the Police , but reports to other ministries in matters within their portfolio . 
 Because of the special treaty status of Svalbard , Longyearbyen is subject to Norwegian legislation , but citizens of any signatory country may conduct commercial activities and live in town . However , people without a source of income can be rejected by the governor . The treaty limits Norway 's right to collect taxes to that of financing services on Svalbard . Therefore , Longyearbyen has a lower income tax than mainland Norway , and there is no value added tax . The treaty has resulted in Longyearbyen being a demilitarized zone and is not part of the European Economic Area nor the Schengen Area like the rest of Norway .

Most of Store Norske 's production is done at Sveagruva , located on Van <unk> , 60 kilometers ( 37 mi ) south of Longyearbyen . No roads connect the communities ; instead , workers live in dormitories in Svea . Seventy percent commute home to the mainland while thirty percent commute to Longyearbyen . Mining has not been profitable and Store Norske relies on state subsidies to retain production . 
 The University Centre in Svalbard ( UNIS ) has 350 students and a permanent faculty of 40 professors and assistants and 120 guest lecturers . UNIS does not offer degrees , but instead offers semester courses in biology , physics and geology . Student housing is located at Nybyen . The college is part of the 12 @,@ 000 m2 ( 130 @,@ 000 sq ft ) Svalbard Science Centre , which also features the Norwegian Polar Institute , EISCAT and Svalbard Science Forum . In 2006 , about 9 @,@ 000 research days were spent in Longyearbyen , most of which were by Norwegians . This made Longyearbyen the second @-@ largest research outpost on Svalbard , marginally below Ny @-@ Ålesund . In contrast , Longyearbyen has almost only Norwegian research , while Ny @-@ Ålesund is roughly evenly split between Norwegian and foreign . 
 Svalbard Satellite Station was built because of Longyearbyen 's excellent location to download data from satellites in polar orbit . Located at Platåberget above Hotellneset , it was built as a cooperation between NASA and the Norwegian Space Centre , but has since 2001 been operated by Kongsberg Satellite Services . EISCAT operates an incoherent scatter radar to study the northern lights . The Svalbard Global Seed Vault , administered by the Global Crop Diversity Trust , is a secure underground facility capable of storing millions of crop seeds . The facility has been designed to protect against natural and human disasters , including global warming , floods and fires and nuclear holocaust . The site was chosen for a number of factors including its remoteness , sound geology and the ambient temperature of the permafrost . 
 Longyearbyen is the centre of tourism on the archipelago , although most tourism is generated based on natural experiences rather than visiting the town itself . However , Longyearbyen does provide supplies , accommodation and several museums . In 2008 , Longyearbyen experienced 89 @,@ 000 guest @-@ nights , up from 30 @,@ 000 in 1995 . The average guest stayed 2 @.@ 2 nights and 60 percent of the capacity was used by tourists . About 40 @,@ 000 tourists flew into Longyearbyen . Two @-@ thirds of the tourists come from Norway . In 2007 , the tourism industry had a revenue of NOK 291 million and produced 200 man @-@ years .

 Longyearbyen has a road network stretching 50 kilometers ( 30 mi ) , but the network does not extend to any other communities . In 2008 there were 1 @,@ 481 registered road vehicles and 49 percent of all households had a car . Cars are registered with <unk> on the registration plates . There is a single workshop , Svalbard Auto , which is also a Toyota dealer . 
 Snowmobiles are a popular mode of transport and there are more snowmobiles than residents . In 2008 there were registered 2 @,@ 672 snowmobiles and 69 percent of households owned at least one . Off @-@ road motorized transport is prohibited on bare ground , but snowmobiles are used extensively during winter — both for commercial and recreational activities . Transport from Longyearbyen to Barentsburg ( 45 km or 28 mi ) and Pyramiden ( 100 km or 62 mi ) is possible by snowmobile by winter , or by ship all year round . 
 Svalbard Airport , Longyear is located at Hotellneset , 3 kilometers ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) northwest of town . It has a 2 @,@ 483 @-@ meter ( 8 @,@ 146 ft ) long runway and is the only airport that is permitted to serve aircraft from off the archipelago . Scandinavian Airlines operates daily flights to Oslo and Tromsø , while there are irregular flights to Russia . Lufttransport operates regular charter services to Svea Airport and Ny @-@ Ålesund Airport , Hamnerabben . Arktikugol operates helicopters to Barentsburg and Pyramiden . There are two quays in Longyearbyen , one for export of coal and one for general goods . From 1907 to 1987 , the mining companies operated a network of aerial tramways to transport coal from the mines to the port . 
 = Christ lag in Todes Banden , BWV 4 = 
 Christ lag in Todes Banden ( also spelled Todesbanden ) ( " Christ lay in death 's bonds " or " Christ lay in the snares of death " ) , BWV 4 , is a cantata for Easter by German composer Johann Sebastian Bach , one of his earliest church cantatas . It was probably intended for a performance in 1707 , an early work in the genre to which he later contributed complete cantata cycles for all occasions of the liturgical year . It was related to his application for a post at a Lutheran church at Mühlhausen . John Eliot Gardiner describes it as Bach 's " first @-@ known attempt at painting narrative in music " . 
 Christ lag in Todes Banden is a chorale cantata , a style in which both text and music are based on a hymn . In this instance , the source was Martin Luther 's hymn of the same name , the main hymn for Easter in the Lutheran church . The composition is based on the seven stanzas of the hymn and its tune , which was derived from Medieval models . Bach used the unchanged words of a stanza of the chorale in each of the seven vocal movements , in the format of chorale variations per omnes versus ( for all stanzas ) , and he used its tune as a cantus firmus . After an opening sinfonia , the variations are arranged symmetrically : chorus – duet – solo – chorus – solo – duet – chorus , with the focus on the central fourth stanza about the battle between Life and Death . All movements are in E minor , and Bach achieves variety and intensifies the meaning of the text through many musical forms and techniques . 
 Christ lag in Todes Banden is Bach 's first cantata for Easter – in fact , his only extant original composition for the first day of the feast – and his earliest surviving chorale cantata . He later repeatedly performed it as Thomaskantor in Leipzig , beginning in 1724 when he first celebrated Easter there . Only this second version survives . It is scored for four vocal parts and a Baroque instrumental ensemble , with a choir of cornetto and three trombones doubling the choral voices , a string section of two violins , two violas , and continuo . This exemplifies a 17th @-@ century " <unk> " ( chorale concerto ) style ; the lost scoring of the earlier performances was perhaps similar . 
 Gardiner calls Bach 's setting of Luther 's hymn " a bold , innovative piece of musical drama " , and observes " his total identification with the spirit and letter of Luther 's fiery , dramatic hymn " .
