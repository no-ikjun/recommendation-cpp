 Liukin began gymnastics at the age of three because she was " always hanging around in the gym " with her parents , who could not afford a babysitter to look after her while they were working as coaches .. Liukin 's parents initially did not aspire for their daughter to become a gymnast , knowing the pressure of high @-@ level competition firsthand , but relented when they noticed her aptitude for the sport . 
 Liukin competed in her first National Championships as a junior in 2002 , at the age of 12 and a half . In contrast to her <unk> teammates Carly Patterson and Hollie Vise , who finished first and second , respectively , Liukin suffered a fall on the uneven bars that rendered her unable to finish the routine . She continued through the rest of the competition and , despite the incomplete bars set , finished 15th , which landed her one of the final spots on the U.S. National Team . She was chosen to compete with the U.S. team at the 2002 Junior Pan American Championships , where she contributed to the team gold medal and placed second on the uneven bars and balance beam and in the all @-@ around . 
 By 2003 , Liukin was one of the strongest junior gymnasts in the United States . She won the junior division of the U.S. National Championships , as well as gold medals on three of the four events : uneven bars , balance beam and floor exercise . She repeated these accomplishments in 2004 . Liukin was a member of the gold @-@ medal winning U.S. team at the 2003 Pan Am Games ; she took second place in the all @-@ around behind fellow American Chellsie Memmel . She also won the all @-@ around in the junior division of the 2004 Pacific Alliance Championships . 
 Born in 1989 , Liukin was ten months too young to compete as a senior in 2004 , and thus was not eligible for a place on the U.S. team for the 2004 Olympics in Athens . Her scores in the junior division at the 2004 U.S. National Championships were competitive with those being posted by the seniors , and Marta Karolyi , the U.S. national team coordinator , has said that if Liukin had been eligible , she would have been named to the Olympic team .

 In 2005 , Liukin won her first senior National Championships and , once again , earned gold medals on the bars and beam . At the 2005 World Championships in Melbourne , she finished second in the all @-@ around behind teammate Chellsie Memmel with a score of 37 @.@ 822 . 
 In event finals , she won the gold on the uneven bars and balance beam and the silver on the floor exercise . 
 In March 2006 , Liukin placed first in the all @-@ around at the American Cup . At the 2006 Pacific Alliance Championships , Liukin tied with teammate Memmel for first in the all @-@ around , won the uneven bars title and a silver medal on beam , and contributed to the U.S. team 's gold @-@ medal performance . She competed at the 2006 U.S. Classic as the defending all @-@ around champion , but falls on the uneven bars and floor resulted in a fourth @-@ place finish . However , she scored extremely well on the balance beam and was the only competitor in the meet , junior or senior , to earn a score over 16 @.@ 00 on this event . After that when she was interviewed on ABC television show Dancing with the stars , she said , " After that , I realized that it 's not all about winning . It 's about the journey . " 
 In late August , at the 2006 U.S. National Championships , Liukin successfully defended her all @-@ around , beam and bars titles , becoming a two @-@ time senior national champion . She was named to the U.S. team for the 2006 World Gymnastics Championships in Aarhus , Denmark , and was expected by many to be a strong contender for the all @-@ around title . However , because of an ankle injury sustained in training before the competition began , she was only able to compete on one event , the uneven bars . In spite of her injury , in the qualification round , Liukin 's bars set earned a 16 @.@ 2 , the highest score of any competitor on any apparatus in the meet . Her bars routine in team finals scored a 15 @.@ 7 and helped the U.S. team win the silver medal . Liukin also qualified for the event finals on bars , where she took a small step on her dismount and finished with a 16 @.@ 05 , earning a silver medal behind Britain 's Beth Tweddle . 
 = = = 2007 = = = 
 Liukin 's ankle injury required surgery , and the recovery period kept her out of both national and international competition for much of the year . In July 2007 , although she was still recovering from her injury , she returned to competition as a member of the American team for the Pan Am Games in Rio de Janeiro . She competed only on bars and beam , contributing to the team 's gold @-@ medal finish and winning individual silver medals in the uneven bars and balance beam finals . 
 Despite limited training time on floor and vault in the summer of 2007 , Liukin opted to compete all @-@ around at the 2007 U.S. National Championships . She posted the highest score of the entire meet on bars and the second highest score on beam on the second day of competition , winning the senior bars title for the third year in a row and placing second on beam . However , she also suffered several falls and errors on floor and vault , and finished in third place overall , more than five points behind Shawn Johnson , the all @-@ around gold medalist . 
 Following Nationals , Liukin was named to the American team for the World Championships in Stuttgart , Germany , where she competed all @-@ around in the team qualifying round and on bars and beam in the finals . Liukin 's score for her bars routine in team finals was a 16 @.@ 375 , the highest score of the day and , in the end , the entire World Championships . However , at the end of her beam routine , her foot slipped while she was setting up her dismount , prompting her to change her usual skill , a two and a half twisting <unk> , to a simple back tuck . While she lost credit for her dismount , she also avoided a deduction for a fall , and earned a 15 @.@ 175 . The team recovered from this and other mistakes to finish first overall with 184 @.@ 400 , nearly a point ahead of the silver @-@ medal Chinese . 
 Liukin 's struggles with the balance beam continued in the all @-@ around final , where she fell from the apparatus during her flight series . In spite of a 16 @.@ 100 on bars , the highest score of the day from any competitor on any event , she finished the competition in fifth place . In the event finals , however , Liukin rallied and regained her world champion title on the balance beam with a score of 16 @.@ 025 . She also earned a silver on the uneven bars behind Russia 's Ksenia <unk> , scoring a 16 @.@ 300 after taking a step on her dismount .

 Liukin 's first meet of the 2008 season was the American Cup in New York City , where she defeated 2007 winner Shawn Johnson to regain her title . She posted the highest score of the meet , a 16 @.@ 600 on the uneven bars . In March , Nastia competed at the Pacific Rim ( formerly Pacific Alliance ) Championships in San Jose , where she led the American team to a gold medal and won the all @-@ around and balance beam titles . In the team competition , Liukin posted an all @-@ time high score of 16 @.@ 650 on the uneven bars , but in event finals , she fell on her <unk> release move and took a step on her dismount , earning a 15 @.@ 225 and taking second place . 
 At the 2008 U.S. National Championships in Boston , Liukin fell on the floor on her double front tuck the first day of competition , but had a strong meet on her other events and placed second in the all @-@ around behind Shawn Johnson . She regained her national champion title on the beam and defended her national title on the uneven bars for the fourth consecutive year , scoring a 17 @.@ 050 in preliminaries and a 17 @.@ 100 in finals , the highest recorded score for any American gymnast at any event since the advent of the new Code of Points . In June , Liukin competed in the U.S. Olympic Trials in Philadelphia , finishing second behind Johnson and earning a berth on the American team for Beijing .

 Liukin performed all @-@ around in the qualifying round of competition . She fell on her dismount from the uneven bars , but nevertheless qualified to the all @-@ around final with a score of 62 @.@ 375 , which ranked her second among all competitors and 0 @.@ 35 points behind Shawn Johnson , her friend and Olympic roommate . Liukin also qualified to three event finals : beam , uneven bars ( in spite of the fall ) and floor exercise . 
 In the team finals , Liukin performed on three events : beam , bars and floor exercise . Her uneven bars score of 16 @.@ 900 was the highest mark awarded in the entire Olympic competition . Liukin performed second on balance beam , matching her qualifying score of 15 @.@ 975 . On floor exercise , she stepped out of bounds on her first tumbling pass , incurring a 0 @.@ 1 @-@ point penalty , with a final score of 15 @.@ 200 . The American team earned the silver medal , 2 @.@ 375 points behind China . 
 On August 15 , Liukin performed clean routines on all four events ( sticking her landings on three out of four events ) to win the all @-@ around gold medal with a final score of 63 @.@ 325 . Shawn Johnson took the silver medal with a score of 62 @.@ 725 . The win marked the third time that an American woman had won the Olympic all @-@ around title ; Mary Lou Retton and Carly Patterson were the two previous American gold medalists . It was also the fourth time in the history of the Games that two athletes from the same country had taken first and second place in the women 's all @-@ around . The last time this was accomplished was the 2000 Olympics , when Romanian gymnasts won gold and silver ; Soviet gymnasts also won gold and silver all @-@ around medals at the 1952 and 1960 Games . 
 In the event finals , Liukin displayed a beautiful routine to earn a surprising bronze medal on floor exercise with a score of 15 @.@ 425 , behind Shawn Johnson , with 15 @.@ 500 , and Romanian Sandra <unk> , with 15 @.@ 650 . On uneven bars , Liukin and China 's He Kexin both posted final marks of 16 @.@ 725 and earned identical A- and B @-@ panel scores of 7 @.@ 70 and 9 @.@ 025 , respectively . However , He Kexin won the gold medal , and Liukin was awarded the silver , after a tie @-@ breaking calculation that took into account individual marks given by judges on the B @-@ panel . In the balance beam final , Liukin scored 16 @.@ 025 to claim silver behind Shawn Johnson 's 16 @.@ 225 . With her fifth Beijing medal , Liukin tied Mary Lou Retton and Shannon Miller for the most gymnastics medals won by an American in a single Olympic Games . 
 Following her success in Beijing , Liukin was named the USOC Female Athlete of the Month ( August ) and ultimately USOC Co @-@ Sportswoman of the Year alongside swimmer Natalie Coughlin ; the Women 's Sports Foundation Individual Sportswoman of the Year ; FIG Athlete of the Year and <unk> Sportswoman of the Year . In addition , she was ranked third in the Associated Press ' 2008 Female Athlete of the Year voting . 
 In March 2009 , Liukin was announced as one of 12 semifinalists for the AAU Sullivan Award . The annual award honors the athlete who best represents " the qualities of leadership , character , sportsmanship , and the ideals of amateurism . " On April 15 , 2009 , Liukin 's Olympic teammate Shawn Johnson won the AAU Sullivan Award .

 Liukin decided that she was not done with gymnastics and made her first post @-@ Olympics competitive appearance at the CoverGirl Classic , where she competed only on balance beam . She placed second behind teammate Ivana Hong . Liukin thought about competing uneven bars and beam at the U.S. Championships , but decided to once again just perform on beam . She placed fourth and looked on track to possibly make a fourth World Championships team . Liukin was added to the national team and included in the World Championships selection camp . However , she pulled out of Worlds selection consideration because she felt that she was not quite up to World Championships standards .

 After several months of conditioning , training , revamping routines and showing readiness at summer training camp , Liukin petitioned for a spot at the Visa National Championships . In order for the petition to be granted , she had to show readiness by scoring at least a 14 @.@ 0 on one apparatus at a qualifying event ( the U.S. Secret Classic ) on May 26 . She did so , scoring a 14 @.@ 9 on balance beam , and her petition was thereby accepted by USA Gymnastics and the selection committee . 
 On beam at the Visa Championships , Liukin scored a 15 @.@ 1 on night one , followed by a 14 @.@ 1 on night two to place sixth on the event . On bars , she placed a disappointing 20th after scoring a 13 @.@ 150 on night one and 13 @.@ 650 on night two . Despite this , Liukin was chosen to compete at the Olympic Trials . 
 Liukin 's gymnastics career came to an end after the 2012 Olympic Trials . On the final night of competition , she fell off the bars on her <unk> release , but got back up to finish her routine and landed her first competitive dismount since her comeback . After falling , she was helped up by her coach ( father ) to continue her routine . Her bars routine received a 13 @.@ 950 . After she finished her beam routine , which scored a 14 @.@ 950 , she received a standing ovation from the 18 @,@ 000 fans in the HP Pavilion in San Jose . Despite the end of her gymnastics career , Liukin went to London as the athlete representative for the International Gymnastics Federation ( FIG ) .

 = 1991 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1991 Atlantic hurricane season was the first season in over 24 years in which no hurricanes developed from tropical waves , which are the source for most North Atlantic tropical cyclones . The hurricane season officially began on June 1 , and ended on November 30 . It was the least active in four years due to higher than usual wind shear across the Atlantic Ocean . The first storm , Ana , developed on July 2 off the southeast United States and dissipated without causing significant effects . Two other tropical storms in the season – Danny and Erika – did not significantly affect land . Danny dissipated east of the Lesser Antilles , and Erika passed through the Azores before becoming extratropical . In addition , there were four non @-@ developing tropical depressions . The second depression of the season struck Mexico with significant accompanying rains . 
 The most significant storm of the season was Hurricane Bob , which at the time was among the ten costliest United States hurricanes . After brushing the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Long Island in New York , the hurricane made landfall on Rhode Island . It caused $ 1 @.@ 5 billion in damage ( 1991 USD ) , mostly in Massachusetts , and 17 fatalities . The strongest hurricane of the season was Claudette , which reached peak winds of 135 mph ( 215 km / h ) near Bermuda . It passed near the island but did not cause any damage . Tropical Storm Fabian was the only tropical storm to move over or near Cuba or Florida , producing heavy rainfall but no damage . Hurricane Grace , the final named storm of the season , provided the energy that led to the development of a powerful nor 'easter known as the Perfect Storm . Originating from an extratropical storm , the Perfect Storm intensified while moving westward toward New England , leaving $ 200 million in damage and causing coastal damage from Puerto Rico to Florida and northward through Canada . It later transitioned into a hurricane over the Gulf Stream , finally dissipating over Nova Scotia on November 2 . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 Before the start of the season , hurricane expert William M. Gray released his forecast for the year 's activity , a yearly practice that he began in 1984 . In early April , Gray anticipated a " mild " season with fewer than ten tropical storms , of which less than six would become hurricanes . Later that month , the Weather Research Center forecast ten named storms and six hurricanes , of which five would become major hurricanes while three would hit the United States . In early June , Gray released an updated report that predicted the formation of eight tropical storms , four hurricanes , and one major hurricane . The revised June total was very close to the actual season activity , with the exception of forecasting one fewer major hurricane . However , a later revision in August incorrectly anticipated less activity , when Gray predicted seven storms and three hurricanes . 
 Overall activity in 1991 was below normal . This was partially due to decreased tropical cyclogenesis from African tropical waves , which are troughs that move across the ocean with associated convection . In most seasons , the majority of storms develop from tropical waves . Of the season 's twelve tropical cyclones , only five originated from tropical waves ; in addition , only three of the eight tropical storms were from tropical waves , and none had the characteristics of a Cape Verde @-@ type hurricane . From late April to late November , there were 73 tropical waves that exited the west coast of Africa . The total was higher than average , although many of them were poorly defined and had little thunderstorm activity . The waves traversed the Atlantic Ocean further south than normal , typically not becoming convectively active until moving across northern South America . Cyclogenesis was also suppressed by higher than normal wind shear , as well as low rainfall amounts across the Sahel . There were also no tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico for only the third time in the 20th century , after 1927 and 1962 . The season produced twelve tropical depressions , which was the lowest in five years . The eight tropical storms was the lowest amount in four years . Four of the storms developed into hurricanes , although for the first time in over 24 years , none of the hurricanes originated from tropical waves . 
 The season 's activity was reflected with a low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 36 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots ( 39 mph , 63 km / h ) or tropical storm strength . Although officially , subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total , the figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase .

 = = = Tropical Storm Ana = = = 
 The first storm of the season was Ana , which originated from a cold @-@ core low that persisted east of Jacksonville , Florida by June 25 . With an anticyclone located over Florida , The system moved in a clockwise motion around an anticyclone located over Florida . The cold @-@ core low gradually developed to the surface , and on June 29 , a low pressure area formed within a surface trough over the Bahamas . It moved westward across southern Florida , dropping heavy rainfall along its path . Punta Gorda recorded a statewide peak of 7 @.@ 86 in ( 200 mm ) of precipitation . The low moved northwestward and later curved northeastward , exiting into the Atlantic Ocean near Saint Augustine by early on July 2 . Although it was initially disorganized as it moved offshore , the convection quickly developed in organization , and by 1800 UTC that day it had developed into Tropical Depression One about 85 mi ( 135 km ) south of Charleston , South Carolina . 
 As the depression moved northeastward parallel to the southeast United States coastline , it dropped light rainfall , although portions of Virginia recorded more than 5 inches ( 130 mm ) . Late on July 3 , a buoy reported sustained winds of 38 mph ( 61 km / h ) over a period of eight and a half minutes . As a result , the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Ana . The storm accelerated east @-@ northeastward toward a stalled frontal zone , entering an area of increased wind shear . Despite hostile conditions , Ana strengthened slightly , reaching peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . Moving over cooler waters and interacting with the frontal zone , the circulation became broad as the thunderstorms diminished . On July 5 , Ana became extratropical ( non @-@ tropical ) in the northern Atlantic Ocean about 680 mi ( 1 @,@ 090 km ) to the south of Cape Race . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Two = = = 
 A tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa on June 20 , and no significant development occurred until it became Tropical Depression Two in the western Gulf of Mexico on July 5 . On its first advisory , a tropical storm watch was issued for from Baffin Bay , Texas southward to Tampico , Tamaulipas . Nearing the coast of Mexico , the depression attained its peak intensity with winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) and a minimum pressure of 1 @,@ 007 mbar ( 29 @.@ 7 inHg ) . Failing to intensify further , Tropical Depression Two made landfall near La Pesca , Tamaulipas , Mexico on July 6 . The National Hurricane Center issued the final advisory on July 7 , although the circulation persisted until July 9 southwest of Texas . The depression had only minor impacts in Mexico and Texas , other than rainfall . Precipitation was heaviest in San Luis Potosí , where the rainfall peaked at 17 @.@ 47 in ( 444 mm ) in Tamazunchale , Mexico . 
 = = = Hurricane Bob = = = 
 Hurricane Bob originated from a decaying cold front , developing into a tropical depression early on August 16 near the Bahamas . It produced an area of organized convection , and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Bob roughly 18 hours after forming . It gradually organized over the Gulf Stream , and based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters , Bob attained hurricane status on August 17 . Shortly thereafter , the hurricane began to turn towards the north @-@ northeast in response to a subtropical ridge over the Atlantic and the trough over the southeastern United States . After further intensification off the Carolinas , Bob reached peak winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) to the east of Virginia on August 19 , making it a major hurricane . Significantly cooler sea surface temperatures resulted in weakening . After brushing Long Island , the center of Bob moved over Block Island , Rhode Island . About 40 minutes later it struck Newport , Rhode Island with winds of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) , making it a Category 2 hurricane . It rapidly weakened to tropical storm intensity while moving through the remainder of New England , hitting Rockport , Maine early on August 20 . After crossing New Brunswick , Bob became extratropical in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and lasted another nine days before dissipating west of Portugal . 
 The hurricane first affected the Carolinas , spawning four confirmed and nine unconfirmed tornadoes in North Carolina . One person each died in North and South Carolina , and about 10 % of houses in the Outer Banks sustained minor roof damage . As the storm moved up the coast , heavy rain fell on the western side of the center . High winds left 300 @,@ 000 people without power on Long Island . In neighboring Connecticut , strong winds downed trees across the region , with damage heaviest in the southeastern portion near the coast . Damage was heaviest as Bob made its final landfall , with wind gusts of 105 mph ( 168 km / h ) reported on Block Island , Rhode Island . The hurricane produced extensive beach erosion which destroyed coastal roads in the state . Monetary damage was greatest in Massachusetts , and along Bob 's path through southeastern New England more than 60 % of people were left without power . High tides and strong winds destroyed boats and houses along the Massachusetts coastline . The heaviest rainfall from the hurricane fell at the Portland International Jetport in Maine , where 8 @.@ 24 in ( 209 mm ) fell during its passage . Across the United States , damage totaled $ 1 @.@ 5 billion ( 1991 USD ) , including over $ 1 billion in Massachusetts . The high damage total made Bob among the ten costliest U.S. hurricanes at the time . In addition , there were 15 fatalities in the country . In Canada , high waves killed two people . In Fredericton , New Brunswick , tropical storm @-@ force winds downed trees and power lines . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Four = = = 
 One of the few vigorous tropical waves of the season emerged from the western coast of Africa with a large area of convection in late August . On August 24 it developed into a tropical depression near Cape Verde . Upon first forming , the depression had a circular area of convection near the center . It was initially well @-@ organized , but the depression was not expected to intensify due to marginal water temperatures ; tropical cyclones generally require warm waters to develop . By August 25 , the system lost much of its deep convection , and on August 26 the depression dissipated to the west @-@ southwest of the Cape Verde islands . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Five = = = 
 Around the same time as the previous system dissipated , another tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 26 . On August 28 it formed into a tropical depression about 560 mi ( 900 km ) southwest of Cape Verde . Upon developing , the depression had a small area of convection with a spiral rainband , and the NHC anticipated slow strengthening to tropical storm status . With a ridge to the north , the depression maintained a general westward track . Ultimately , the depression failed to organize significantly . By August 29 , it had a broad and poorly organized circulation with only scattered convection . Due to cool water temperatures , the system was unable to maintain deep convection , and on August 31 the depression degenerated into a tropical wave about 400 miles ( 645 km ) east of the Lesser Antilles . 
 = = = Hurricane Claudette = = = 
 The origins of Claudette were non @-@ tropical , developing on September 4 about 650 mi ( 1 @,@ 000 km ) southeast of Bermuda from an upper @-@ level disturbance . Following its formation , it developed slowly while moving southwestward , and on September 5 it intensified into Tropical Storm Claudette . Conditions were favorable for development , with low wind shear and a large anticyclone providing outflow , or the outward wind flow from a storm . On September 6 at 0600 UTC , Claudette attained hurricane status . It underwent rapid intensification , and early on September 7 a reconnaissance flight reported that Claudette attained major hurricane status with winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) . Based on satellite estimates , Hurricane Claudette attained its peak intensity with winds of 130 mph ( 215 km / h ) and a minimum pressure 946 mbar ( 27 @.@ 9 inHg ) . 
 After peaking , Claudette began steady weakening . Around that time , a hurricane watch was issued for the island of Bermuda , which was later upgraded to a warning . The hurricane turned to the northwest , passing 136 miles ( 219 km ) east of Bermuda as a Category 1 hurricane on September 8 . Winds on the island peaked at 23 mph ( 37 km / h ) , with gusts to 32 mph ( 51 km / h ) , and waves reached up to 8 ft ( 2 @.@ 43 m ) in height . By September 10 , Claudette weakened to tropical storm status as it accelerated eastward . The next day it deteriorated further to tropical depression status , and the next day Claudette became extratropical to the southwest of the Azores . It persisted two more days until dissipating over the Azores .

 One of the most vigorous tropical waves of the season ( which also led to the formation of Hurricane Jimena in the eastern Pacific ) was first observed in western Africa on September 2 . Three days later it emerged from the coast at Dakar , moving into the tropical Atlantic Ocean with rainbands around its convection . By early on September 7 , the system organized into Tropical Depression Seven about 300 mi ( 480 km ) south @-@ southwest of Cape Verde . Upon developing , the depression had a broad circulation , located in an environment generally favorable for intensification . With a strong ridge to the north , the depression tracked steadily westward . After remaining a tropical depression for about 36 hours , the system became better organized and developed well @-@ defined banding features . Based on satellite intensity estimates , the NHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Danny on September 8 . 
 Upon becoming a tropical storm , only slow strengthening was forecast , due to the presence of an upper @-@ level trough to its west . The storm ultimately reached peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) , which it maintained for about 36 hours . On September 10 it attained its organizational maximum after developing a central dense overcast . Later that day , an upper @-@ level low increased wind shear over the storm , which exposed the circulation from the deep convection . As Danny approached the Lesser Antilles , it weakened to tropical depression status on September 11 . Later that day , a Hurricane Hunters flight was unable to locate a closed circulation , which indicated that Danny degenerated into a tropical wave about 150 mi ( 240 km ) east of the Lesser Antilles . The remnants tracked to the northwest and later to the north before being absorbed by a frontal system . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Erika = = = 
 The origins of Tropical Storm Erika were from a tropical wave that exited the coast of Africa on September 2 . It moved northwestward , passing through Cape Verde the following day . The system had most of the thunderstorms along the southern portion of the wave as it maintained a very large low @-@ level circulation . Thunderstorms began developing on September 7 , and the system organized into Tropical Depression Eight the following day about 920 mi ( 1480 km ) northeast of the Lesser Antilles ; at the same time , it was located about midway between Hurricane Claudette and Tropical Storm Danny . Initially the center was difficult to locate on satellite imagery , but despite the proximity with Claudette , conditions were generally favorable for intensification . By late on September 9 , the depression had become much better organized , and based on satellite estimates the NHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Erika . 
 Upon becoming a tropical storm , Erika began a motion to the northeast . There was initial uncertainty whether Erika or nearby Claudette would become the dominant system through their interaction . On September 10 , the storm developed a central dense overcast as it attained its peak winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . It accelerated east @-@ northeastward toward the Azores along the northern periphery of a ridge , briefly interacting with Claudette . By September 11 , the convection had diminished , leaving the center exposed as Erika underwent extratropical transition . Shortly thereafter it passed through the Azores , striking São Miguel Island . Nearby Santa Maria Island reported tropical storm force winds with gusts to 67 mph ( 107 km / h ) , prompting the closure of the airfield for several hours . On September 12 , Erika weakened to a tropical depression before completing the transition into an extratropical cyclone . It dissipated later that day . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Fabian = = = 
 Tropical Storm Fabian developed on October 15 in the western Caribbean from the interaction of a cold front and a tropical wave . Initially the storm was disorganized , with its strongest winds located primarily east of the center . An eastward @-@ moving upper @-@ level trough imparted a northeast motion as well as unfavorable wind shear . After reaching peak winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) , Fabian crossed the Isle of Youth before crossing western Cuba . There , it dropped heavy rainfall , including 5 in ( 130 mm ) in a six @-@ hour period in one location . By early on October 16 , the center was becoming difficult to locate as Fabian moved through the Florida Straits . It passed just southeast of the Florida coastline , prompting the closure of two state parks and dropping 4 @.@ 19 in ( 106 mm ) of rainfall in Conch Key . Effects were minimal , with winds gusting to 32 mph ( 52 km / h ) in Key West . The storm later moved through the Bahamas and became extratropical as it interacted with an approaching front . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Ten = = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on October 19 . Moving westward , it developed a weak circulation on October 23 . Despite the presence of strong shear , the system was upgraded to a tropical depression at 2200 UTC on October 24 about 1100 miles ( 1775 km ) east of the Lesser Antilles . This was based on a rating of 1 @.@ 5 on the Dvorak technique , which is a method of estimating the intensity of tropical cyclones via satellite . At the time of development , the depression had a small area of convection near and east of the center , and due to the wind shear it was never expected to intensify . By October 25 , the circulation had become dissociated from the convection . The depression dissipated soon after without affecting land . 
 = = = Hurricane Grace = = = 
 On October 23 a mid @-@ level low formed south of Bermuda . By two days later it had become a surface low , and on October 26 it developed into a subtropical storm . The system was labeled as such due to the initial lack of deep convection over the center , although following an increase in thunderstorms the NHC reclassified it as Tropical Storm Grace late on October 27 . By that time , the storm had executed a path generally to the northwest . Grace continued to intensify and organize , and based on Hurricane Hunter reports the storm was upgraded to a hurricane early on October 28 . Shortly thereafter , Grace turned sharply to the east due to the influence of a rapidly intensifying extratropical cyclone off the New England coast . An eye developed in the center of Grace , despite shallow convection . 
 As the hurricane accelerated eastward , it attained a peak intensity of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) on October 29 . The rapid motion caused an asymmetry in the wind field , and the center passed approximately 50 mi ( 80 km ) south of Bermuda without significantly affecting the island . A rapidly approaching cold front absorbed Grace on October 29 , contributing moisture to the developing extratropical storm that was eventually known as the Perfect Storm . As a tropical cyclone , Grace produced squally conditions across Bermuda , but no damage was reported . The hurricane generated large swells along the East Coast of the United States , causing minor beach erosion . 
 = = = The Perfect Storm = = = 
 The origins of the Perfect Storm were from an area of low pressure that developed off Atlantic Canada on October 28 . It moved southward and westward as an extratropical cyclone due to a ridge to its north , and reached its peak intensity . The storm lashed the East Coast of the United States with high waves and coastal flooding , before turning to the southwest and weakening . Moving over warmer waters , the system transitioned into a subtropical cyclone before becoming a tropical storm . It executed a loop off the Mid @-@ Atlantic states and turned toward the northeast . On November 1 the system evolved into a full @-@ fledged hurricane with peak winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . The tropical system weakened , striking Nova Scotia as a tropical storm before dissipating . 
 Damage totaled over $ 200 million ( 1991 USD ) and the death toll was thirteen . Most of the damage occurred while the storm was extratropical , after waves up to 30 ft ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) struck the coastline from Canada to Florida and southeastward to Puerto Rico . In Massachusetts , where damage was heaviest , over 100 homes were destroyed or severely damaged . To the north , more than 100 homes were affected in Maine , including the vacation home of George H.W. Bush , the president at the time . More than 38 @,@ 000 people were left without power , and along the coast high waves inundated roads and buildings . In portions of New England , damage was worse than had occurred from Hurricane Bob two months prior . However , aside from tidal flooding along rivers , the storm 's effects were primarily along the coastline . A buoy off the coast of Nova Scotia reported a wave height of 100 @.@ 7 ft ( 30 @.@ 7 m ) , the highest ever recorded in the province 's offshore waters . In the middle of the storm , the Andrea Gail sunk , killing its crew of six and inspiring the book and later movie The Perfect Storm . Off the coast of New York , a Coast Guard helicopter lost fuel and crashed , and although four members of its crew were rescued , one was killed . Two people died after their boat sank off Staten Island . High waves swept a person to their death in both Rhode Island and Puerto Rico , and another person was blown off a bridge in New York . The tropical cyclone that formed late in the storm 's duration caused little impact , limited to power outages and slick roads ; one person was killed in Newfoundland from a traffic accident related to the storm . 
 = = Storm names = = 
 The list below shows the names that appeared on the tropical cyclone naming list in the Atlantic basin in 1991 . Although the Perfect Storm later evolved into a hurricane , in which could have been named " Henri " , the National Hurricane Center left it unnamed due to the heavy damage and media interest in the predecessor extratropical storm . It later received the name the Perfect Storm after a conversation between Boston National Weather Service forecaster Robert Case and author Sebastian Junger . The names not retired from this list in 1991 appeared again on the naming list for the 1997 season . This is the same list used for the 1985 season , with the exception of the names Erika and Grace , which replaced the names Elena and Gloria after the 1985 season , and were used for the first time in 1991 . Names that were not assigned are marked in gray .

 = Chimera ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Chimera " is the sixteenth episode of the seventh season of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network in the United States , on April 2 , 2000 , was written by David Amann , and directed by Cliff Bole . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Chimera " earned a Nielsen household rating of 7 @.@ 5 , being watched by 12 @.@ 89 million people in its initial broadcast . The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , Mulder investigates what appears to be the case of a missing woman from a small town , but soon turns out to be a murder by a spirit summoned from the underworld . Scully , meanwhile , must endure an uncomfortable stakeout . 
 Similar to the season six episode , " Arcadia " , " Chimera " was written as " a suburban parable about perfection " that examined " the evil that lies beneath a prototypical white @-@ bread suburban existence . " The episode was produced at a time when both David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were directing their own episodes , and in order to compensate , Anderson 's role was drastically reduced in the episode . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Bethany , Vermont , a raven frightens a little girl , Michelle Crittendon , at a park while a neighbor , Jenny <unk> , watches . The bird is later found at her home . Her mother , Martha Crittendon , is then attacked and killed by an unseen monster . Meanwhile , in Washington , D.C. , Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) are on a stakeout looking for a woman who is possibly killing prostitutes . Mulder believes she has the power to disappear because every time police attempt to arrest her she cannot be found . While on lookout , Mulder gets a call about the attack and leaves . Back at the office , Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) tells Mulder that Crittendon disappeared and asks him what he knows about ravens . Mulder believes that the bird is usually associated with evil . Skinner tells Mulder that this case is a top priority because Crittendon is the wife of a powerful judge . At the Crittendon home , Martha 's husband , Howard , tells Mulder that his wife was cheating on him because he found birth control pills , which is suspicious because Howard has had a vasectomy . Another neighbor , Ellen <unk> , the wife of Sheriff Phil <unk> , is approached by Jenny and then sees a raven before the window of a nearby car shatters . At the Crittendon home , Michelle sees the raven outside her window again and Howard leaves to check it out , leading him to find a hand sticking out above the flower bushes . Later the police dig up Martha 's body , with claw marks all over her face . 
 Ellen tells Mulder that she saw a reflection in the mirror earlier , and that 's what killed Martha . Mulder believes the glass are doorways to a demonic dimension and that someone is summoning forth a demon to attack people . Ellen believes Jenny <unk> summoned the spirits , but she denies it . Later , Ellen finds a skeleton key in her house and a raven by her baby 's crib . In a mirror , Ellen sees the reflection of a monster chasing after her , but it suddenly breaks . She hides in the closet until Phil comes home and finds her . However , he attributes the commotion to stress , believing that she is imagining things . Mulder finds the skeleton key and it matches one found in Martha Crittendon 's coat pocket . Mulder deduces that the sheriff is having an affair with Jenny . Mulder later tells him that Martha was pregnant and that he thinks he is the father . The sheriff reveals that the key opened the door to a motel , where he and Jenny met for clandestine affairs . Meanwhile , at the motel , Jenny sees ravens outside and is promptly attacked and killed by the creature . 
 Phil explains to Mulder that he wanted a divorce from Ellen two years ago , but she got pregnant and would not allow it . He also believes that he is the reason for this happening and that he somehow summoned the entity . It turns out that Ellen is the entity , which is given away by a cut in her back given by Jenny during the attack . Ellen transforms into the creature , attacks Mulder , and attempts to drown him in a bath tub , but stops when she sees her monstrous reflection in the water . She is placed in a psychiatric hospital , where the doctors diagnose her with multiple personality disorder . Meanwhile , Scully reveals to Mulder that the mysterious prostitute killer was not an X @-@ File at all , but rather a man disguised as a woman who talked to the prostitutes about religion and attempted to help them get out of the prostitution ring .

 The premise behind " Chimera " was " a compelling examination of the evil that lies beneath a prototypical white @-@ bread suburban existence . " These themes had previously been explored in the season six episode , " Arcadia " . However , the show wished to explore the same ideas in a more " straight @-@ ahead scare " style , rather than supplementing the horror of the episode with humor , as was done in " Arcadia " . Series creator , Chris Carter , saw the episode as " a chance to do something bold and new . " Carter wanted the story to revolve around a crow , an image that he described simply as " scary " . With the story , he wanted to " bust pretense and perception and expose the underbelly of a white @-@ bread community . " Originally , the episode was going to feature a subterranean monster and was aptly going to be titled " Subterranean Monster Blues " . 
 The episode was written in " a burst of twenty @-@ hour days " . Greg Walker , who assisted David Amann , described the finished script as " a suburban parable about perfection . " Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles noted in their book , The Complete X @-@ Files , that " David Amman 's script is an insightful commentary on suburban repression and self @-@ delusion , which made a major comeback in the conservative late ' 90s . " The episode soon went into pre @-@ production , but first , several issues had to be addressed . Most notably , while the episode was being produced , David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were also busy directing their own episodes — " Hollywood A.D. " and " all things " , respectively . To cope with this hectic schedule , the writers planned " Chimera " so that Duchovny and Anderson only had to be together in a limited number of scenes . Anderson was only needed for one day of filming for her auxiliary sub @-@ plot involving the prostitute murderer . 
 = = = Casting and filming = = = 
 Rick Millikan , the show 's casting director , was tasked with finding " normal @-@ looking suburban people " for the cast . Millikan later noted that " the show necessitated casting perfect people . But it 's not that easy to find [ ... ] normal @-@ looking people . We 've used so many people over the years that it 's gotten harder and harder to find them . Several of the individuals cast had previously played parts in " obscure genre films " : Michelle Joyner first appeared in the 1990 anthology film Grim Prairie Tales , Gina <unk> first was noted in her 1989 movie Alien Space Avenger , John Mese had a part in the 1995 movie Night of the Scarecrow , and finally , Wendy Schaal had appeared in the 1985 film Creature . 
 Most of the opening scenes were shot in a local Los Angeles backyard , however , finding suitable " tree @-@ lined elements " proved difficult . Ultimately , a museum in Hollywood allowed the crew to film in a tree @-@ filled section on its grounds . The episode ran into several snags during filming . Director Cliff Bole had trouble trying to get the crows to " act on cue " . Eventually , several ravens were brought in as doubles . Bole later noted , " we got two ravens . One was very good at cawing and one was good at hopping . " The ending sequence had to be re @-@ shot several times . Producer Paul Rabwin explained , " Originally , we wanted to show a mirror image of the woman being attacked by the monster , but it didn 't really sell . " Eventually , the crew decided to glue candy glass onto a piece of plywood . In this manner , the camera was able to see the action through the shattered panes of glass .

 The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics , with a few detractors . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book , Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode four stars out of five , calling the script " very stylish " . The two noted that " [ David ] Duchovny is very good here [ … ] and , as a counterbalance , [ Gillian ] Anderson provides some great comic relief . " Shearman and Pearson concluded that the episode was " a little too ponderously paced to be a classic episode , but it 's clever and well crafted [ which makes it ] a rewarding stand @-@ out . " Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 4 out of 5 stars and wrote that " <unk> birds , spirit portals and split personalities are the order of the day in a story that doesn 't offer that much in genuine thrills , but the best moments are Scully 's occasional complaints from the field . " Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four . Despite noting that the episode " gets off to an awkward start " , Vitaris concluded that " ' Chimera ' takes us into the heart of a quintessential X @-@ Files family " . Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a " B + " , noting that , while the episode was good , it " falls short of classic status , trying to make a metaphor into flesh , and not quite succeeding . " Although Handlen enjoyed the way the episode explores and then connects the main characters , his main critique was that Ellen 's transformation is never explicitly explained . He explained that , " If we had a sense of where her need comes from , if there was some hint at what drove her to this point , it would work ; as is , the actress ’ s performance is excellent , but the character remains too generic . " 
 Not all reviews were positive . Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote a neutral review , saying , " Beyond that , there is little to be said , pro or con , for ' Chimera . ' The episode is mildly interesting and avoids the <unk> of recent episodes . " Tom Kessenich , in his book Examinations , gave the episode a relatively negative review . He derided the lack of Anderson 's character , summing up his feelings in the simple sentence , " No Dana Scully . "

 The 140th Boat Race took place on 26 March 1994 . Held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . Cambridge won by six @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths . The race saw the first competitors from Norway in the history of the race , in brothers Snorre and <unk> <unk> .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . First held in 1829 , the race takes place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1993 race by three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths , with Cambridge leading overall with 70 victories to Oxford 's 68 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . The race was sponsored by Beefeater Gin for the eighth consecutive year . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Up until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the Tideway , prior to the main Boat Race . 
 In preparing for the race , Cambridge had defeated crews from both Leander and Molesey . Meanwhile , Oxford lost out to London Rowing Club 's lightweight crew , but narrowly defeated the University of London Boat Club . They went on to secure victory in the Reading Head of the River race before head coach Richard Tinkler and his assistant Tim <unk> were removed from their positions . Fred <unk> was installed as finishing coach for the Dark Blues whose build @-@ up concluded with a loss to Leander . Cambridge were coached throughout by Harry Mahon , John Wilson and Sean Bowden .

Oxford 's crew featured two Norwegian brothers in Snorre and <unk> <unk> , the first rowers from their country to participate in the Boat Race , both of whom had participated in both world championship and Olympic races . Oxford Boat Club president Kingsley Poole referred to them as " <unk> and <unk> " . He noted : " They 've got some kind of kin thing where they can just switch on and go nuts " . Cambridge welcomed back five former Blues while Oxford saw three return in the form of Michels , Poole and Chick .

 = St Symphorien Military Cemetery = 
 The St Symphorien Military Cemetery is a First World War Commonwealth War Graves Commission burial ground in Saint @-@ Symphorien , Belgium . It contains the graves of 284 German and 229 Commonwealth soldiers , principally those killed during the Battle of Mons . The cemetery was established by the German Army on land donated by Jean Houzeau de Lehaie . It was initially designed as a woodland cemetery before being redesigned by William Harrison Cowlishaw after the Imperial War Graves Commission took over maintenance of the cemetery after the war . 
 Notable Commonwealth burials in the cemetery include John Parr and George Lawrence Price , traditionally believed to be the first and last Commonwealth soldiers killed in action during the First World War , and Maurice Dease , the first posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross of World War I. Notable German burials include Oskar Niemeyer , the first Iron Cross recipient of World War I.

 = = = Battle of Mons = = = 
 The Battle of Mons took place as part of the Battle of the Frontiers , in which the advancing German armies clashed with the advancing Allied armies along the Franco @-@ Belgian and Franco @-@ German borders . The British position on the French flank meant that it stood in the path of the German 1st Army . The British reached Mons on 22 August and at the time , the French Fifth Army , located on the right of the British , was heavily engaged with the German 2nd and 3rd armies at the Battle of Charleroi . The British agreed to hold the line of the Condé – Mons – Charleroi Canal for twenty @-@ four hours , to prevent the advancing German 1st Army from threatening the French left flank . The British thus spent the day digging in along the canal . 
 At dawn on 23 August a German artillery bombardment began on the British lines ; throughout the day the Germans concentrated on the British at the salient formed by the loop in the canal . At 9 : 00 a.m. , the first German infantry assault began , with the Germans attempting to force their way across four bridges that crossed the canal at the salient . The initial German attack was repulsed with heavy losses but after the Germans switched to an open formation their advance progress more quickly as the looser formation made it more difficult for the British to inflict casualties rapidly . By the afternoon the British position in the salient had become untenable and by 3 : 00 p.m. the British began retreating to a new defensive line . 
 = = = Establishment = = = 
 Most of the British and German dead from the Battle of Mons were initially buried in church and local cemeteries in Mons and surrounding villages rather than a purpose built military cemetery . Subsequently , the German Army decided to exhume and re @-@ inter the dead in a single location , as they determined the care and maintenance of a isolated graves was unsustainable over the long term . 
 In spring 1916 , a German officer by the name of Captain Roemer was searching for an appropriate piece of cemetery land south @-@ east of Mons . During this search he approached renowned biologist and local landowner Jean Houzeau de Lehaie , who offered some former quarry land on his family estate lands between the districts of St. Symphorien and <unk> , possibly to ensure that land associated with Neolithic flint mines of Spiennes was not employed instead . Roemer initially proposed that the land be requisitioned , with compensation being provided by the local authorities . Houzeau de Lehaie refused to accept payment for the land and agreed to part with it only under the condition that it be donated instead of requisitioned , and that in the cemetery the dead of both sides be treated with equal respect . During 1916 and 1917 <unk> Infantry Battalions exhumed burials from isolated and less maintainable sites and re @-@ interred them in the new cemetery . Most of the bodies that were exhumed were from the north and north east of the Mons battlefield especially near <unk> and <unk> where the British stopped Imperial German units from crossing the Mons @-@ Conde canal . The German and British dead were reburied in graves with markers containing the message Enemies in Life but United in Death ( German : Im Leben ein Feind , im Tode <unk> ) , a common German practice during the First World War . The cemetery was inaugurated on 6 September 1917 with a ceremony attended by prominent German figures , including Rupprecht , Crown Prince of Bavaria , Albrecht , Duke of Württemberg , and Frederick Francis IV , Grand Duke of Mecklenburg @-@ Schwerin . 
 The cemetery contained 245 German and 188 British graves at the end of the war . This number increased in the post @-@ war period , as both British and German remains from numerous isolated burial locations were concentrated to St. Symphorien until the cemetery reached its current number of 284 German soldiers and 229 Commonwealth soldiers . Most of the identified German dead in the cemetery died in 1914 and were from units of IX Corps , which originated from the north of Germany from towns like Kiel , Hamburg and Bremen , and in Schleswig @-@ Holstein . 
 = = = Post @-@ war = = = 
 At the end of the war in November 1918 , the maintenance of Commonwealth graves passed to Imperial War Graves Commission ( now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission ) . From June 1921 , the Belgian War Graves Commission appointed a supervisor to maintain the German graves as the Germans could not do so themselves on account of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles . In 1926 , Belgium and Germany reached an agreement for the gradual transfer of maintenance responsibility to the Official German Burial Service in Belgium ( German : <unk> Deutscher <unk> in Belgien ) representative at the embassy to Germany in Brussels . The Germans officially referred to the cemetery as <unk> Saint @-@ Symphorien @-@ Spiennes . Number 191 . The name recognized that the cemetery was both located in close proximity to the town of Saint @-@ Symphorien and technically located in the administrative areas of Spiennes while concurrently incorporating the number assigned to the cemetery in a Belgian ordered list of German cemeteries . 
 On 13 October 1930 , representatives of the Official German Burial Service in Belgium , the Belgian War Graves Commission and the Imperial War Graves Commission met in Brussels to discuss the status of mixed British @-@ German cemeteries in Belgium . In particular , they met to discuss the status of cemeteries established by Germans during the war where the majority of those buried in the cemetery were German . This meeting was brought about because the Imperial War Graves Commission had begun altering the layout of cemeteries containing a high percentage concentration of German dead and began replacing the existing headstones on the Commonwealth graves with the standardized Imperial War Graves Commission headstones , all without first consulting with the German Burial Service in Belgium . The German delegation hoped to retain the established design character of the cemeteries but were ultimately unsuccessful . Control for the cemetery was immediately passed to the Imperial War Graves Commission and further German contribution was limited to providing headstones for a number of graves that were lacking markers . Now that the Imperial War Graves Commission was in full control of the cemetery they immediately set about redesigning it , assigning the task to Assistant Architect William Harrison Cowlishaw . In 1933 Fritz Schult , Chief of the Official German Burial Service in Belgium , wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin to request that the Imperial War Graves Commission be approached to take control over other split British @-@ German cemeteries such as those at <unk> New Communal Cemetery and <unk> Military Cemetery . The Imperial War Graves Commission was maintaining the German graves at St. Symphorien at no cost to Germany and Schult believed it favorable to transfer management of other cemeteries if the Imperial War Graves Commission would assume all maintenance costs for those cemeteries as well .

 On 4 August 2014 , a ceremony was held at the cemetery to mark the 100th anniversary of the British and Belgian declaration of war following the German invasion of Belgium . It was attended by many important dignitaries including : King Philippe and Queen Mathilde of The Belgians , Prince William , Catherine , Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry as representatives of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and Head of the Commonwealth , Joachim Gauck President of Germany , Michael D. Higgins President of the Republic of Ireland , Prime Minister of Belgium Elio Di <unk> and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Cameron .

 = = = Original design = = = 
 Captain Bäumer designed the cemetery , assisted by militia @-@ private Pieper . They developed a site plan based on the concept of Cemetery Reform ( German : <unk> ) , which was popular in Germany at the time . In the cemetery design , particular attention was paid to ensuring simplicity with uniformity in each plot , all within a calming , arboreal environment consistent with a woodland cemetery ( German : Waldfriedhof ) style . Thirteen plots were marked off and young trees – and later extra conifers – were planted between the plots to ensure their visual and physical separation . The cemetery land itself had many artificial created differences in elevation due to the site being used as a dumping location for surplus soil associated with phosphate mining in the area . The cemetery plants were donated by the city of Bielefeld . 
 The German graves were grouped according to military unit . Every grave in each grouping receiving a similar headstone , but not necessarily the same as that in other groupings . There were a number of organizations in Germany that were particularly opposed to mass @-@ produced identical headstones and by consequence the cemetery contains a number of differently styled headstones . The German headstones were carved from locally quarried stone , principally bluestone and Belgian petit <unk> . German officers were offered larger headstones to illustrate their higher military rank . The cemetery contains a number of German regimental memorials within the cemetery which were paid and provided by the city or town where the regiment was based . 
 The Germans treated the British dead in a similar manner to their own . All of the British were buried in individual plots and , like the Germans , grouped by unit as far as possible . The deceased British officers were buried in a plot separate from their troops and it is not known how these graves were marked before they were provided with the standardized Imperial War Grave Commission headstone . The Germans also erected simple regimental memorials that identified the unit or regiment within a number of the British groupings . This included one to the Middlesex Regiment which was mistakenly referred to as the " Royal Middlesex Regiment " although that was not its name at the time . 
 A classical 7 metres ( 23 ft ) high obelisk memorial made of bluestone was placed near the entrance at the highest point in the cemetery . The monumental inscription on the obelisk is written in German and is dedicated to the German and British soldiers that died during the Battle of Mons : " In memory of the German and English soldiers who fell in the actions near Mons on the 23rd and 24th August 1914 . " ( German : Zum Gedächtnis der am 23 @.@ und 24 . August 1914 in den <unk> bei Mons gefallenen deutschen und <unk> Soldaten ) . Near the cemetery entrance , a tablet in Latin was set out to explain the land was gifted for the purpose of a cemetery by Jean Houzeau de Lehaie . 
 = = = Cowlishaw redesign = = = 
 Full controlled of the St Symphorien cemetery was transferred to the Imperial War Graves Commission in 1930 after which William Harrison Cowlishaw set about redesigning the cemetery . The main change was the conversion from a woodland cemetery to the more open English garden style cemetery present at most Imperial War Graves Commission cemeteries . Many of the trees were chopped down , particularity those in the predominantly British south @-@ eastern side , and grass sown in this area . The cemetery was made to feel more open but no changes were made to the location of the graves , effectively leaving each plot layout in situ choosing instead to remove vegetation that provided the visual compartmentalization to each plot . The predominantly German north @-@ eastern half was left more characteristically in a woodland cemetery style , although many trees were pruned to ensure that an open view was created between the various plots . The original German headstones were retained and several German headstones added due to transferred graves from other sites . The other principal change was earthwork to create a raised hill where the Cross of Sacrifice would be erected . The German general monument was in no way modified but Cowlishaw likely created the hill to ensure the Cross of Sacrifice was not dwarfed by the German monument . Special memorials were erected to five soldiers of the Royal Irish Regiment believed to be buried in unnamed graves . Other special memorials record the names of four British soldiers , buried by the Germans in <unk> Churchyard , whose graves could not be found . Approximately 100 Commonwealth soldiers buried at St Symphorien were unidentified . They are interned under a headstone with a quote by Rudyard Kipling : " A Soldier of the Great War , Known Unto God . "

 Notable German burials include <unk> Oskar Niemeyer from the 84th Infantry Regiment was the first recipient of the Iron Cross during the war . Having come to a crossing of the Mons – Condé canal with a closed swing bridge he swam across the canal , returned across the canal with a requisitioned small boat , paddled back across the canal with a team and then opened the bridge allowing the Germans troops to cross in greater numbers . He was killed shortly after opening the bridge . 
 Notable Commonwealth burials in the cemetery include Private John Parr , of the 4th Battalion , Middlesex Regiment and George Lawrence Price of the Canadian 28th ( Northwest ) Battalion each believed to be the respective first and last Commonwealth soldiers killed in action during the First World War , as is George Ellison , the last British soldier killed in action . Also buried in the cemetery is Maurice Dease who was the first posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross in the war . Dease was awarded the Victoria Cross for defending <unk> Bridge and maintained firing of a machine gun until he was hit for a fifth and final time . 
 = Margaret Gowing = 
 Margaret Mary Gowing née Elliott , CBE , FBA ( 26 April 1921 – 7 November 1998 ) was an English historian . She was involved with the production of several volumes of the officially sponsored History of the Second World War , but was better known for her books , commissioned by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority , covering the early history of Britain 's nuclear weapons programmes : Britain and Atomic Energy 1939 – 1945 , published in 1964 , and the two @-@ volume Independence and Deterrence : Britain and Atomic Energy 1945 – 52 , published in 1974 . 
 Through her work in the Cabinet Office from 1945 to 1959 , she knew personally many of the people involved . As historian archivist at the UK Atomic Energy Authority from 1959 to 1966 she had access to the official papers and files of the British nuclear weapons programmes . She was the first occupant of a chair in the history of science at the University of Oxford , which she held from 1972 until her retirement in 1986 . As co @-@ founder with physicist Nicholas Kurti of the Contemporary Scientific Archives Centre in Oxford , she helped ensure the preservation of contemporary scientific manuscripts . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Margaret Elliott was born on 26 April 1921 in Kensington , London , the youngest of three children of Ronald Elliott , a motor engineer , and his wife , Mabel née Donaldson , a school teacher . She had an older sister , Audrey , and an older brother , Donald . The family was poor ; her father suffered , and ultimately died , from tuberculosis and was frequently unemployed , while her mother was barred from working as a school teacher after she was married . The family therefore often had to live on a weekly sickness benefit . For entertainment , they took advantage of free entry to art galleries , museums and libraries . Elliot 's direct experience of poverty led to her becoming an ardent socialist later in life . She attended Portobello Elementary School in North Kensington , and won a London County Council scholarship to Christ 's Hospital in 1932 . She excelled academically , was a prefect , and played hockey for her house . 
 Elliott completed her School Leaving Certificate in 1936 , earning distinctions in Latin , English and French and a pass in German . She won a Leverhulme Entry Scholarship to the London School of Economics ( LSE ) , which she entered in 1938 . Her first @-@ year studies advisor was the economist Vera Anstey , who considered that Elliott had " a decided bent for economic history " , Elliot later attributed her interest in the subject to lectures by her second @-@ year studies advisor , Eileen Power , who urged her to pursue an academic career . She won both the Gladstone Memorial Prize and the Lillian Knowles Scholarship for economic history in 1939 . Later that year , with the outbreak of the Second World War , the LSE was evacuated to Oxford , where Elliott graduated in 1941 with a BSc degree in economics with first class honours . 
 = = Civil Service = = 
 Academic jobs in history were not easy to find in 1941 , so Elliott joined the Civil Service , working in the Prices and Statistics Section of the Iron and Steel Control directorate in the Ministry of Supply . She subsequently moved to the Board of Trade , and the Directorate of Housing <unk> , where she rose to the rank of Assistant Principal , before moving to the Cabinet Office in 1945 . There she became involved with the Official History of the Second World War , as assistant to Keith Hancock who was overall editor of the United Kingdom Civil Series of books within the Official History . As an official historian of the History of the Second World War : United Kingdom Civil Series , Gowing had access to unpublished official papers and files . She came to know personally many of the politicians and senior civil servants involved . 
 On 7 June 1944 , Elliot married Donald James Graham Gowing at the Wimbledon Registry Office . He was a vocalist who had also attended Christ 's Hospital before winning a choral scholarship to Kings College , Cambridge , in 1939 . He had joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in 1941 , and was serving at Combined Operations Headquarters . They married shortly before he was shipped overseas . He was taught Japanese in the United States and went on serve in the Pacific as a translator . The marriage bar was suspended for the duration and Gowing was allowed to remain in the Civil Service . They had two children , both sons : Nicholas Keith ( Nik ) , a journalist who was born in 1951 and named after Hancock , and James , born in 1954 . Her husband , frustrated by his lack of professional success compared to hers , became an alcoholic , and died from a massive stroke in 1969 . 
 In 1950 , Sir Norman Brook attempted to have Gowing retained in the Cabinet Office as the permanent historian , but was stymied by the Treasury and the Civil Service Commission . In 1951 , she was told that she had no chance of being appointed to the grade of Principal , which would have carried retirement benefits with it . She later said that her years at the Cabinet Office were the happiest of her life , but she began looking for another position . In 1955 , she applied for a chair in economic history at Oxford , and for a readership at LSE , but was unsuccessful . Sir Norman exploited various administrative loopholes to allow her to be retained at the Cabinet Office , and was prepared to make her the Cabinet Office Archivist , but he could not offer her a pension . 
 The Public Records Act 1958 required all government departments to set up archives and records management systems . The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority ( UKAEA ) was nominally exempt from the act , being a government corporation rather than a department , but voluntarily asked to be included under the Act . This created a position at the UKAEA for an historian and archivist . Gowing applied for and secured the job in 1959 . This involved organising systems and criteria for the selection for preservation of scientific , engineering and administrative records , and writing the history of the British atomic project since it began in 1939 , the UKAEA having inherited the files of predecessor organisations including the Tube Alloys Directorate . 
 By this time , the UKAEA employed some 40 @,@ 000 people in offices , laboratories and factories scattered around Britain . Gowing knew little about atomic energy ; she once remarked that when she was appointed , she " didn 't know an atom from a molecule " . This was rectified , and she won the respect of Sir Christopher Hinton and Sir James Chadwick , and became friends with Nicholas Kurti , Sir Rudolf Peierls and Niels Bohr . At one point she asked Chadwick what he intended to do with all the documents in wooden filing cabinets in his attic , and he just said " burn them " . Such heart @-@ stopping moments led her to help establish the Centre for Scientific Archives in 1972 . 
 Gowing 's first volume , Britain and Atomic Energy 1939 – 1945 , was published in 1964 , and achieved widespread acclaim . Stephen Toulmin declared that " No better example of contemporary narrative history of science has yet appeared " . It prompted Mark Oliphant to seek the appointment of a historian to the Australian Academy of Science in Canberra , and the Cabinet Office to commission a new series of peacetime official histories in 1966 . 
 = = Academia = = 
 In 1966 , Gowing became Reader in Contemporary History at the new University of Kent , Canterbury , covering scientific , technical , economic and social history . The UKAEA retained her as a consultant , paying her ₤ 1 @,@ 000 per annum for three years . Her main task was to write a two @-@ volume sequel to Britain and Atomic Energy 1939 – 1945 covering the period from 1945 to 1952 . To help out , the UKAEA brought in Lorna Arnold from its Health and Safety Division in 1967 to become the Departmental Records Officer ( <unk> ) and Gowing 's Assistant Historian . Despite their being accredited as official historians , the Atomic Weapons Establishment would not let them take their notes away , so they had to do their writing on site , under the watchful eye of Aldermaston 's <unk> . To get there Gowing had to catch the train each day from Canterbury to London Waterloo station , and then the Tube to Paddington and the railway to Reading , where Arnold picked Gowing up in her car and drove to Harwell . 
 Gowing attempted to negotiate better conditions at the University of Kent that would allow more time to work on the books , but this was denied . She applied for a vacant chair in the History and Philosophy of Science at University College London in 1970 , without success . Then , in February 1972 , Sir Rudolf Peierls and Nicholas Kurti informed her that the University of Oxford had created a new chair in the history of science , the first of its kind in the university 's long history . She did not expect to get the chair , but Peierls , Sir Frederick <unk> and Hugh Trevor @-@ Roper were on the selection panel , and in the end offered the chair in the history of science to Gowing , a woman who did not have a degree in history or science . 
 Gowing was based at Linacre College . Her appointment , Roy MacLeod wrote , " struck a conspicuous blow for modern , as against medieval and early modern , science , and for a reading of history that favoured social , economic and political perspectives , as against the examination of scientific practice . " She delivered her inaugural lecture , What 's Science to History or History to Science ? , on 27 May 1975 . In this lecture , she examined the reasons why the history of science had grown apart from other forms of history , and endeavoured to reconcile them and bring them together again . In her subsequent Wilkins Lecture in 1976 she examined the history of British prejudice against science dating back to Victorian times . 
 The two @-@ volume opus , Independence and Deterrence : Britain and Atomic Energy 1945 – 52 , finally appeared in 1974 . The publication of her books brought accolades . Gowing was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1975 , and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) in 1981 . She received honorary doctorates in literature from the University of Leeds in 1976 , the University of Leicester in 1982 , and Manchester in 1985 , and in science from the University of Bath in 1987 . When she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1988 under the provisions of Statute 12 of its Charter , which allowed for the election of non @-@ scientists who had made distinguished contributions to science , she became only the third person to become a Fellow of both the British Academy and the Royal Society , after Sir Karl Popper and Joseph Needham . Gowing never got around to writing a planned sequel to Independence and Deterrence that would take the story up 1958 , when the nuclear special relationship between Britain and the United States resumed . Arnold would later write three books to fill in this gap . 
 In the 1980s , Gowing served as a trustee of the Science Museum , London , and the Imperial War Museum but , remembering her own childhood , she resigned from the latter in protest at the introduction of entry fees . She was also a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery from 1978 to 1992 . She began suffering from what was most likely Alzheimer 's disease , and retired from Oxford in 1986 , two years before the official retirement age . Although she had worked in the Civil Service and Academia for 45 years , only 27 of them counted , so she was not eligible for a full pension ; her son Nik supported her . She died at Kingston Hospital in Kingston upon Thames on 7 November 1998 . An archive of her papers is held by the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford , presented by her in 1991 , with additions on her death .

 = Trapalcotherium = 
 Trapalcotherium is a fossil mammal from the Cretaceous of Argentina in the family Ferugliotheriidae . The single species , T. matuastensis , is known from one tooth , a first lower molar . It is from the Allen Formation , which is probably Maastrichtian in age , and was first described in 2009 . The tooth bears two rows of cusps , one at the inner ( lingual ) side and the other at the outer ( labial ) side , which are connected by transverse ridges separated by deep valleys . This pattern is reminiscent of Ferugliotherium , a gondwanathere mammal from similarly aged deposits in Argentina , and Trapalcotherium is therefore recognized as a member of the same family Ferugliotheriidae . Ferugliotheriidae is one of two families of gondwanatheres , an enigmatic group without close relationships to any living mammals . 
 = = Discovery and context = = 
 The only known fossil of Trapalcotherium was found at Cerro Tortuga in Río Negro Province , southern Argentina . This locality is in the Allen Formation , one of three formations ( rock units ) that have yielded Late Cretaceous gondwanathere fossils from Argentina ( the others are the Los Alamitos and La Colonia Formations ) . All three are probably about equally old , from the Maastrichtian ( latest Cretaceous , about 71 – 66 million years ago , mya ) and perhaps partly the Campanian ( 84 – 71 mya ) . The mammals from the Allen Formation are known from seven teeth , six of which represent four species of dryolestoids — a group of primitive mammals that dominates the Late Cretaceous mammalian faunas of Argentina . The fauna was described in a 2009 paper by Guillermo Rougier and colleagues , who named Trapalcotherium as well as several new dryolestoids . The generic name , Trapalcotherium , combines the name of the basin where Cerro Tortuga is located , Bajo <unk> , with the Greek <unk> " beast " , commonly used to mean " mammal " in scientific names . The specific name , matuastensis , derives from Puesto El <unk> , a shed used by the paleontologists who collected the fossils from the Allen Formation . 
 = = Description = = 
 The single tooth of Trapalcotherium is identified as a lower molar because it has two longitudinal rows of cusps ; as a first molar because it is longer than wide ; and as a left tooth because the left side ( interpreted as labial , in the direction of the lips ) bears more cusps than the right side ( lingual , the direction of the tongue ) . The tooth is 2 @.@ 48 mm long and 2 @.@ 07 mm wide . Part of the back labial corner is missing . 
 The lingual row contains three cusps and the labial probably five ( the broken corner renders the number uncertain ) . Transverse ridges , separated by deep valleys , connect the lingual and labial cusps ; therefore , the cusps are not strongly separate , but rather fused . The lingual cusps are larger and separated by larger valleys than the labial ones . At the front of the tooth is a triangular structure consisting of the first lingual and the first two labial cusps . A low crest connects the first lingual to the first labial cusp and a stronger crest , separated from the first by a relatively shallow valley , connects the second lingual to the first labial cusp . Behind this structure , a second triangle is formed by two crests passing from the second lingual cusp to two cusps at the labial side ( the back of the two is broken away , but its existence is presumed from the crown pattern ) . The front of these two crests is interrupted by a groove . The third lingual cusp is also connected to two crests , which encircle a small depression and presumably connected to one or more labial cusps , which are missing from the fossil . 
 = = Relationships = = 
 Trapalcotherium is identified as a member of Gondwanatheria — a small and enigmatic group of mammals from Cretaceous and Paleogene of the southern continents ( Gondwana ) — on the basis of the transverse ridges and triangle on its crown . It resembles Ferugliotherium from the Los Alamitos Formation , the only previously known uncontroversial member of the family Ferugliotheriidae , but differs in some characters : the triangle at the front is narrower in Trapalcotherium ; the valley behind the front triangle is less curved ; the ridges attached to the second lingual cusp form another triangle ; the tooth is relatively shorter ; Trapalcotherium does not have the Y @-@ shaped valleys between cusps seen in Ferugliotherium ; and the tips of the lingual cusps are more <unk> placed . The evolutionary affinities of gondwanatheres , which include the Ferugliotheriidae and the higher @-@ crowned Sudamericidae , are controversial , though a relationship with multituberculates ( a large group mainly known from the northern continents of Laurasia ) has repeatedly been proposed ; the identification of Trapalcotherium does not provide additional information that has a bearing on the relationships of the gondwanatheres . 
 = Greater adjutant = 
 The greater adjutant ( Leptoptilos dubius ) is a member of the stork family , <unk> . Its genus includes the lesser adjutant of Asia and the marabou stork of Africa . Once found widely across southern Asia , mainly in India but extending east to Borneo , the greater adjutant is now restricted to a much smaller range with only two small breeding populations ; one in India with the largest colony in Assam and the other in Cambodia . Populations disperse after the breeding season . This large stork has a massive wedge @-@ shaped bill , a bare head and a distinctive neck pouch . During the day , they soar in thermals along with vultures with whom they share the habit of scavenging . They feed mainly on carrion and offal ; however , they are opportunistic and will sometimes prey on vertebrates . The English name is derived from their stiff " military " gait when walking on the ground . Large numbers once lived in Asia , but have declined greatly , possibly due to improved sanitation , to the point of being endangered . The total population in 2008 was estimated at around a thousand individuals . In the 19th century , they were especially common in the city of Calcutta , where they were referred to as the " Calcutta adjutant " . Known locally as <unk> ( derived from the Sanskrit word for " bone @-@ swallower " ) and considered to be unclean birds , they were largely left undisturbed but sometimes hunted for the use of their meat in folk medicine . Valued as scavengers , they were once used in the logo of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation . 
 = = Description = = 
 The greater adjutant is a huge bird , standing tall at 145 – 150 cm ( 57 – 59 in ) . The average length is 136 cm ( 54 in ) and average wingspan is 250 cm ( 98 @.@ 5 in ) . While no weights have been published for wild birds , the greater adjutant is among the largest of living storks , with published measurements overlapping with those of the <unk> ( Jabiru <unk> ) , saddle @-@ billed stork ( <unk> senegalensis ) and marabou stork ( Leptoptilos <unk> ) . Juvenile greater adjutant storks in captivity weighed from 8 to 11 kg ( 18 to 24 lb ) . For comparison , the heaviest known wild stork was a marabou stork scaling 8 @.@ 9 kg ( 20 lb ) . The huge bill , which averages 32 @.@ 2 cm ( 12 @.@ 7 in ) long , is wedge @-@ like and is pale grey with a darker base . The wing chord averages 80 @.@ 5 cm ( 31 @.@ 7 in ) , the tail 31 @.@ 8 cm ( 12 @.@ 5 in ) and the tarsus 32 @.@ 4 cm ( 12 @.@ 8 in ) in length . With the exception of the tarsus length , the standard measurements of the greater adjutant are on average greater than that of other stork species . A white collar ruff at the base of its bare yellow to red @-@ skinned neck gives it a vulture @-@ like appearance . In the breeding season , the pouch and neck become bright orange and the upper thighs of the grey legs turn reddish . Adults have a dark wing that contrasts with light grey secondary coverts . The underside of the body is whitish and the sexes are indistinguishable in the field . Juveniles are a duller version of the adult . The pendant inflatable pouch connects to the air passages and is not connected to the digestive tract . The exact function is unknown , but it is not involved in food storage as was sometimes believed . This was established in 1825 by Dr John Adam , a student of Professor Robert Jameson , who dissected a specimen and found the two layered pouch filled mainly with air . The only possible confusable species in the region is the smaller lesser adjutant ( Leptoptilos javanicus ) , which lacks a pouch , prefers wetland habitats , has a lighter grey skull cap , a straighter edge to the upper mandible and lacks the contrast between the grey secondary coverts and the dark wings . 
 Like others storks , it lacks vocal muscles and produces sound mainly by bill @-@ clattering , although low grunting , <unk> or roaring sounds are made especially when nesting . The bill @-@ clattering display is made with the bill raised high and differs from that of the closely related African marabou which holds the bill pointed downwards . 
 = = Taxonomy and systematics = = 
 John Latham wrote about the bird found in Calcutta based on descriptions in Ives 's Voyage to India published in 1773 and included an illustration in the first supplement to his General Synopsis of Birds . The illustration was based on a drawing in Lady Impey 's collection and Latham called it the gigantic crane and included observations by an African traveller named <unk> who described a similar bird from western Africa . Johann Friedrich Gmelin used Latham 's description and described the Indian bird as Ardea dubia in 1789 while Latham later used the name Ardea <unk> for the Indian bird . Temminck used the name Ciconia marabou in 1824 based on the local name used in Senegal for the African bird and this was also applied to the Indian species . This led to considerable confusion between the African and Indian species . The marabou stork of Africa looks somewhat similar but their disjunct distribution ranges , differences in bill structure , plumage , and display behaviour support their treatment as separate species . 
 Most storks fly with their neck outstretched , but the three Leptoptilos species retract their neck in flight as herons do , possibly due to the heavy bill . When walking on the ground , it has a stiff marching gait from which the name " adjutant " is derived . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 This species was once a widespread winter visitor in the riverine plains of northern India , however their breeding areas were largely unknown for a long time until a very large nesting colony was finally discovered in 1877 at <unk> on the <unk> River , Pegu , Burma and it was believed that the Indian birds bred there . This breeding colony , which also included spot @-@ billed pelicans ( Pelecanus philippensis ) , declined in size and entirely vanished by the 1930s . Subsequently , a nest site in <unk> was the only known breeding area until new sites were discovered in Assam , the Tonle Sap lake and in the Kulen <unk> Wildlife Sanctuary . In 1989 , the breeding population in Assam was estimated at about 115 birds and between 1994 and 1996 the population in the Brahmaputra valley was considered to be about 600 . A small colony with about 35 nests was discovered near <unk> in 2006 . 
 During the non @-@ breeding season , storks in the Indian region disperse widely , mainly in the Gangetic Plains and sightings from the Deccan region are rare . Records of flocks from further south near Mahabalipuram have been questioned . In the 1800s , adjutant storks were extremely common within the city of Calcutta during the summer and rainy season . These aggregations along the Ghats of Calcutta however declined and vanished altogether by the early 1900s . Improved sanitation has been suggested as a cause of their decline . Birds were recorded in Bangladesh in the 1850s , breeding somewhere in the Sundarbans , but have not been recorded subsequently . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 The greater adjutant is usually seen singly or in small groups as it stalks about in shallow lakes or drying lake beds and garbage dumps . It is often found in the company of kites and vultures and will sometimes sit hunched still for long durations . They may also hold their wings outstretched , presumably to control their temperature . They soar on thermals using their large outstretched wings . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 The greater adjutant breeds during winter in colonies that may include other large waterbirds such as the spot @-@ billed pelican . The nest is a large platform of twigs placed at the end of a near @-@ horizontal branch of a tall tree . Nests are rarely placed in forks and an unobstructed top canopy allows the birds to fly easily from and to the nests . In the <unk> nesting colony in Assam , tall <unk> <unk> and <unk> cadamba were favourite nest trees . The beginning of the breeding season is marked by several birds congregating and trying to occupy a tree . While crowding at these sites , male birds mark out their nesting territories , chasing away others and frequently pointing their bill upwards while clattering them . They may also arch their body and hold their wings half open and drooped . When a female perches nearby , the male plucks fresh twigs and places it before her . The male may also grasp the tarsus of the female with the bill or hold his bill close to her in a preening gesture . A female that has paired holds the bill and head to the breast of the male and the male locks her by holding his bill over her neck . Other displays include simultaneous bill raising and lowering by a pair . The clutch , usually of three or four white eggs , is laid at intervals of one or two days and incubation begins after the first egg is laid . Both parents incubate and the eggs hatch at intervals of one or two days , each taking about 35 days from the date of laying . Adults at the nest have their legs covered with their droppings and this behaviour termed as urohidrosis is believed to aid in cooling during hot weather . Adults may also spread out their wings and shade the chicks . The chicks are fed at the nest for about five months . The chicks double in size in a week and can stand and walk on the nest platform when they are a month old . At five weeks , the juveniles leap frequently and can defend themselves . The parent birds leave the young along for longer periods at nest at this stage . The young birds leave the nest and fly around the colony when about four months but continue to be fed occasionally by the parents . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The greater adjutant is omnivorous and although mainly a scavenger , it preys on frogs and large insects and will also take birds , reptiles and rodents . It has been known to attack wild ducks coming within reach and swallowing them whole . Their main diet however is carrion and like the vultures their bare head and neck is an adaptation . They are often found on garbage dumps and will feed on animal and human excreta . In 19th @-@ century Calcutta , they fed on partly burnt human corpses disposed along the Ganges river . In Rajasthan , where it is extremely rare , it has been reported to feed on swarms of desert locusts ( Schistocerca gregaria ) but this has been questioned . 
 = = = Parasites , diseases and mortality = = = 
 At least two species of bird lice , Colpocephalum cooki and <unk> temporalis have been found as ectoparasites . Healthy adult birds have no natural predators , and the only recorded causes of premature mortality are due to the direct or indirect actions of humans ; such as , poisoning , shooting , or electrocution when the birds accidentally fly into overhead electricity wires . Captive birds have been found to be susceptible to avian influenza ( H5N1 ) and high mortality was noted at a facility in Cambodia , with two @-@ thirds of infected birds dying . The longest recorded life span in captivity was 43 years .

 Loss of nesting and feeding habitat through the draining of wetlands , pollution and disturbance , together with hunting and egg collection in the past has caused a massive decline in the population of this species . The world population was estimated at less than 1 @,@ 000 individuals in 2008 . The greater adjutant is evaluated as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species . 
 Conservation measures have included attempts to breed them in captivity and to reduce fatalities to young at their natural nesting sites . Nearly 15 % of the chicks are killed when they fall off the nests and die of starvation , so some conservationists have used nets positioned below the nests to prevent injuries to falling young and then raising these fallen birds in enclosures for about five months before releasing them to join their wild siblings .

 Aelian described the bird in 250 AD in his De Natura Animalium as the <unk> , a large bird from India with a crop that looks like a leather bag . In Victorian times the greater adjutant was known as the gigantic crane and later as the Asiatic marabou . It was very common in Calcutta during the rainy season and large numbers could be seen at garbage sites and also standing on the top of buildings . Its local name <unk> is derived from the Sanskrit <unk> @-@ <unk> , which means " bone @-@ swallower " , and John Latham used it to give the species the binomial name , Ardea <unk> . At that time it was a belief that it was protected by the souls of dead Brahmins . Young British soldiers were known to harass these birds for fun , even blowing up birds by feeding them meat containing bones packed with a cartridge and fuse . The birds in Calcutta were considered to be efficient scavengers and an act was passed to protect them . Anyone who killed the bird had to pay a fine of fifty rupees . The old emblem of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation included two adjutant storks facing each other . Captured birds , probably from Calcutta reached menageries in Europe during this period . 
 The undertail covert feathers taken from adjutant were exported to London during the height of the plume trade under the name of <unk> ( from the place <unk> , now in Bangladesh ) or " <unk> " . 
 An Indian myth recorded by the Moghul emperor Babur was that a magic " snake @-@ stone " existed inside the skull of the bird , being an antidote for all snake venoms and poisons . This " stone " was supposed to be extremely rare as it could only be obtained by a hunter with great skill , for the bird had to be killed without letting its bill touch the ground in which case the " stone " would evaporate instantly . Folk @-@ medicine practitioners believed that a piece of stork flesh chewed daily with betel could cure leprosy .

The film 's settings vary in cities throughout the United States , which Cyrus thought she could capture in the song . " Not just make it something that sounds from Hollywood and really produced , but we could add a little country twang to it , " she said . Cyrus said the writing process was easy . Before the song 's completion , Travolta agreed to sing it , believing " Well , it will be a cute song , whatever it is . " After listening to the song , he was surprised at Cyrus ' songwriting abilities . " She 's really gifted at writing , and she really wanted to write something good for me as the character Bolt , so she went out of her way with her writing partner to come up with something good , and I really think they pulled it off " , Travolta told MTV News . 
 John Lasseter , executive producer of Bolt , decided to make " I Thought I Lost You " the theme for Bolt , since it lyrically summarized the film 's plot . He said , " [ The song ] so sums up the theme of this film . You know , a dog and its owner and they both were separated , but they love each other so much — there 's such an emotional payoff when these characters get reunited , and I think that 's what this song 's about . " Lasseter thought that solely the song worked , but it worked better for the film . " I Thought I Lost You " is one of two songs on the Bolt soundtrack and was released to Radio Disney to promote Bolt and its accompanying soundtrack .

 The song received mixed reception from contemporary critics . William Ruhlmann of Allmusic wrote , " The album begins with a pop / rock song , ' I Thought I Lost You , ' which oddly sounds like a love duet between John Travolta , a man in his mid @-@ fifties , and the teenage TV and pop star Miley Cyrus , until it is remembered that Travolta voices the movie 's title character , a dog .

An uncredited reviewer from The Los Angeles Times thought the song could have been nominated for and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song at 81st Academy Awards .

 Yuna ( <unk> , <unk> ) is a fictional character from Square Enix 's Final Fantasy series .

Yuna reappears in Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 , where she becomes the protagonist , searching for a way to find Tidus two years following his disappearance . Yuna has also been featured in other Square Enix games , notably Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy . 
 Tetsuya Nomura based Yuna 's overall design on hakama , but also wanted to give her outfit something that would flow and so gave her a <unk> . Nomura said that her name carried the night in the Okinawan language in contrast to Tidus , which translates to sun . For Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 , the game 's staff wanted Tetsu Tsukamoto to redesign her costume to reflect her personality and the game 's atmosphere . Yuna 's character was well received by many media critics and fans and in particular praised for her relationship to Tidus , as well as her characterization and sex appeal . Despite this positive reception , there was a mixed reception for her role in Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 due to her redesign . 
 = = Appearances = = 
 In Final Fantasy X , Yuna is introduced as a summoner who can use healing magic and is able to summon powerful magical entities called aeons with help from spirits known as <unk> . Already known throughout Spira as the daughter of High Summoner Braska , who previously brought a brief respite from Sin 's destruction ten years earlier , Yuna decides to embark on the summoner 's pilgrimage to become a High Summoner herself . Yuna must journey to temples across the world , acquire the aeon from each and summon the Final Aeon in a battle that will kill them both . She gradually becomes more open and falls in love with Tidus . Upon arriving at the place where Yuna can summon the final aeon , Tidus persuades the group to look for another way to defeat Sin without using any sacrifices . After entering Sin 's body , Yuna and her guardians defeat the disembodied spirit of Yu Yevon , who is responsible for reviving Sin after each defeat , allowing an eternal Calm start in Spira . However , Tidus disappears as he is the product of the Fayth , who could not depart until Sin 's defeat . 
 In Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 , set two years after Final Fantasy X , Yuna is a member of the sphere hunting group Gullwings , along with Rikku and Paine . In the game 's international version , the Gullwings go their separate ways before the game 's opening , with Yuna returning to Besaid Island . The trio then reunite to explore a tower . In X @-@ 2 , Yuna journeys to Spira in search of the truth behind a sphere containing a video featuring a man resembling Tidus in prison . During her journey , Yuna discovers the man from the sphere was actually Shuyin , a spirit who wishes to destroy Spira in revenge for the death of his lover , Lenne . The Gullwings defeat Shuyin who departs to the afterlife with Lenne 's spirit . Depending on the player 's progress throughout the game , the Fayth may revive Tidus so that she can reunite with him . The HD Remastered version of the game adds a new audio drama where Yuna becomes a part of the group called <unk> whose main temple is located on Besaid . In the story she breaks up with Tidus after telling her she loves somebody else before declaring she will fight Sin once again . 
 She also appears in Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy , an action game that features several Final Fantasy characters , as one of the characters to be summoned by the goddess Cosmos to participate in a war against her rival Chaos . For this game , Yuna appears in her Final Fantasy X form but sightly arranged to fit with the game 's cast . Additionally , she has an alternative design based on Yoshitaka Amano 's illustration , and a wedding dress from Final Fantasy X. Her Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 regular form was made available as downloadable content . 
 Outside the Final Fantasy series , Yuna appears in Kingdom Hearts II as a pixie along with Paine and Rikku . <unk> by Maleficent into spying on Leon 's group , the pixies eventually switch sides after being abandoned by the witch and told of Sora 's cause . Yuna is also featured in the board game style video game Itadaki Street Special , appearing alongside Auron and Tidus , and represents Final Fantasy X in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy . 
 Multiple figures and figurines of Yuna were produced by various manufacturers , including a 2001 figure by Square . A 2003 audio CD Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 Vocal Collections features performances by Mayuko Aoki , Marika Matsumoto and Megumi Toyoguchi , the voice actresses for Yuna , Rikku and Paine , respectively .

 According to Tetsuya Nomura , he based Yuna 's overall design on hakama , a type of traditional Japanese clothing . Nomura said that when he learned the character was to perform a dance called the " sending , " he wanted to give her outfit something that would flow . For this reason , the specific type of kimono he chose for her was a <unk> , a long @-@ sleeved kimono . Nomura also said that he adorned Yuna 's dress and necklace with images of the hibiscus flower also called " <unk> , " and that her name carries the meaning of " night " ( <unk> ) in Okinawan , establishing a contrast between her and the lead male protagonist of Final Fantasy X , Tidus , whose Japanese name ( <unk> ) translates to " sun " ( <unk> ) in Okinawan . This contrast is also represented in @-@ game by items named for the sun and moon that empower Tidus ' and Yuna 's most powerful weapons . Nomura explains that while all these subtle details may be unneeded , he wanted his designs to have meaning behind them . 
 The positive fan reaction to Final Fantasy X convinced the developers to continue the story of Yuna and other characters with Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 . Costume designer Tetsu Tsukamoto said that the radical design changes for Yuna from one game to the other reflected a huge cultural change . Producer Yoshinori Kitase added that they did not want to make Final Fantasy X @-@ 2 feel like an extension of its predecessor , so they changed the clothing of Yuna , Rikku and others ' to make them seem more active . This was accomplished before the story and setting were created . Because Yuna , Rikku and Paine live in a more care @-@ free world , the designers wanted them to be able to dress up , a feature which became key to the gameplay . Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima described her new outfit as a " natural reaction to the heavy stuff she wore in FFX . " Yuna 's singing performance was used to demonstrate the pop feel that the game incorporates . Final Fantasy X director Motomu Toriyama said her personality was the result of not having her bear the responsibility of being a summoner anymore . He added that while " she could be seen as a completely different person , ... deep in her heart , she is the same old Yuna . " 
 In the Japanese versions of the games Yuna has been voiced by Mayuko Aoki . Hedy Burress provides the character 's voice in the English adaptations of the game . In voicing Yuna , Burress remembers trying to translate Yuna 's duty , respect and honor , but also wanting to retain the gentleness and femininity of her character . When commenting on how the audiences would react to Final Fantasy X , Burress said that she wanted them to participate in the game itself and to " transport them into a completely different world " through the voices .

 = U.S. Route 127 in Michigan = 
 US Highway 127 ( US 127 ) is a part of the United States Numbered Highway System that runs from Chattanooga , Tennessee , to the Lower Peninsula of Michigan . In Michigan , it is a state trunkline highway that runs for 214 @.@ 12 miles ( 344 @.@ 59 km ) , entering from Ohio south of Hudson and ending at a partial interchange with Interstate 75 ( I @-@ 75 ) south of Grayling . Prior to 2002 , US 127 ended at I @-@ 69 north of Lansing – East Lansing , a total of approximately 83 miles ( 134 km ) . US 127 is the primary route connecting Lansing and Central Michigan to Northern Michigan and the Mackinac Bridge . From the south side of Jackson northerly , it is mostly a four @-@ lane freeway . A notable exception is a 16 @-@ mile ( 26 km ) stretch from north of St. Johns to just south of Ithaca , where the highway is built as an expressway and speed limits are lower . South of Jackson to the state line , the trunkline is a two @-@ lane , undivided highway with access from adjacent properties . 
 The highway was first designated on November 11 , 1926 , along a series of existing state highways from Lansing southward toward Toledo . In 1930 , the southern end was rerouted south of Somerset in rural northwestern Lenawee County to a course that ran directly south to the Ohio state line ; the remainder was renumbered US 223 . Starting in the 1950s , the highway was reconfigured to bypass Mason and other communities , converting US 127 into a freeway from Jackson to the Lansing area by the mid @-@ 1970s . When the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) successfully petitioned the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( AASHTO ) in 1999 to remove US 27 from the state , US 127 was to be extended northward from Lansing to Grayling as the replacement designation . This change was made in 2002 , resulting in the current configuration of the highway in Michigan . The United States Congress has designated an additional Interstate Highway , to be part of I @-@ 73 that would replace most or all of US 127 through Central and Southern Michigan , but any plans by MDOT to complete this highway were cancelled in 2001 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Running just about 212 @.@ 2 miles ( 341 @.@ 5 km ) in Michigan , US 127 runs north – south up the center of the Lower Peninsula . North of its junction with US 223 in Lenawee County , it is listed as a part of the National Highway System , a system of roads importance to the nation 's economy , defense and mobility . As a state trunkline highway , the roadway is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) , and it includes approximately 162 @.@ 6 miles ( 261 @.@ 7 km ) of freeway in two segments , the southernmost running between Jackson and Clinton counties , separated by an 16 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 16 mi ) gap from the northernmost segment between Gratiot and Crawford counties . According to the department , 1 @,@ 253 vehicles use US 127 on average near the state line , and 68 @,@ 853 vehicles do so between M @-@ 43 and Kalamazoo Street in Lansing , the lowest and highest traffic counts along the highway in 2013 , respectively . 
 = = = State line to Lansing = = = 
 US 127 enters Michigan as a two @-@ lane highway south of Hudson called Meridian Road , which follows the course ( with minor deviations ) of the Michigan Meridian used to survey Michigan in the early 19th century . From the state line north , US 127 follows the Hillsdale – Lenawee county line north through agricultural areas in Southern Michigan . The highway intersects M @-@ 34 at Hudson . Near Beecher Road north of the city , US 127 veers westward , off the county line and travels fully within Hillsdale County for about six miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) . Near intersections with Manitou and Adams roads south of Addison , it crosses fully into Lenawee County .

 In 1919 , the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) signposted the highway system for the first time , At the time , the original M @-@ 14 designation was assigned from the Ohio state line northward through Jackson , Lansing , Mount Pleasant , Clare , and Grayling . The highway also continued from Grayling northward through Gaylord to Cheboygan . Seven years later , the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11 , 1926 , and in Michigan 's initial assignments , US 27 replaced M @-@ 14 between Lansing and Cheboygan , while US 127 ran from Lansing southward through Jackson to the Somerset area where it turned southeasterly , replacing the former M @-@ 80 and M @-@ 34 through Adrian to Toledo , Ohio . The remainder of M @-@ 14 south to the state line remained a shortened M @-@ 14 . 
 The southern end of US 127 was rerouted in 1930 from Somerset south to Hudson and on to Cincinnati , Ohio . The section of former US 127 between Somerset and Toledo became US 223 . The northern end was shifted slightly in 1950 in the city of Lansing when US 27 was rerouted from its car @-@ only route to its truck route and US 127 was realigned to connect to the new routing . 
 The city of Mason was bypassed in 1954 . The former route through town was designated Bus . US 127 at the time . The US 127 expressway was first started in 1957 with an extension south of Mason to Leslie . A further extension to Jackson was opened in 1958 . By 1960 , Jackson was bypassed to the east and the former route through downtown was redesignated Bus . US 127 . Over the next few years , the expressway was upgraded to a full freeway that was completed in by 1964 . The US 127 freeway was extended north to the Lansing area by 1968 . Near Lansing , it was routed along I @-@ 496 to the north side of Lansing and East Lansing to connect with US 27 . The last extension of US 127 for another 11 years was completed in 1973 when the freeway was completed north to the DeWitt area , connecting with US 27 there . 
 Two changes took place in the routing of US 127 in the 1980s as the I @-@ 69 freeway was completed . The northern Lansing bypass was completed in 1984 , and I @-@ 69 was built through Clinton County in 1987 . These changes routed I @-@ 69 along a portion of US 127 near DeWitt and removed a Temporary I @-@ 69 routing from US 127 on the east side of Lansing . The opening of the St. Johns Bypass on August 31 , 1998 , shortened US 127 by almost two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) while US 27 was routed along the I @-@ 69 freeway between exits 87 and 89 to connect with the new freeway northward . US 127 ended at its junction with I @-@ 69 and US 27 and no longer ran concurrently with I @-@ 69 afterward . 
 MDOT petitioned the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( AASHTO ) for approval to remove US 27 from Michigan in 1999 . This proposed change would remove the 88 @-@ mile ( 142 km ) concurrency of I @-@ 69 and US 27 southwest of the Lansing area . MDOT proposed that US 127 be extended north over the former US 27 to Grayling . AASHTO approved this change on April 16 , 1999 , nearly tripling the highway from 83 miles ( 134 km ) to 214 miles ( 344 km ) . The highway markers were changed over in 2002 , converting US 27 and the Bus . US 27 designations to US 127 and Bus . US 127 , respectively . 
 In 2009 , MDOT constructed Michigan lefts at several intersections in northern Clinton County to remove cross @-@ street traffic . In April 2010 , the department raised speed limits for passenger cars on this non @-@ freeway stretch to 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) from the previous 55 miles per hour ( 89 km / h ) .

 As originally defined in 1991 , the alignment of I @-@ 73 in Michigan would have simply run along I @-@ 75 to Detroit . However , the definition was amended in 1995 to have a branch along the US 223 corridor to south of Jackson and the US 127 corridor ( formerly US 27 north of Lansing until 2002 ) north to I @-@ 75 near Grayling . From Grayling northward , it would simply use I @-@ 75 to Sault Ste . Marie . Except south of Jackson , where it is a two @-@ lane road and a section of road north of Lansing where the freeway reverts to a divided highway , this is mostly a rural four @-@ lane freeway . While there are no immediate plans to convert the section between St. Johns and Ithaca to freeway , MDOT continues to purchase parcels for right @-@ of @-@ way to be used for future upgrades . 
 MDOT included using the US 127 and US 223 corridors as one of its three options to build I @-@ 73 in 2000 . The others included using the US 127 corridor all the way into Ohio with a connection to the Ohio Turnpike or using US 127 south and a new freeway connection to US 223 at Adrian . MDOT abandoned further study of I @-@ 73 after June 12 , 2001 , diverting remaining funding to safety improvement projects along the corridor . The department stated there was a " lack of need " for sections of the proposed freeway , and the project website was closed down in 2002 . According to press reports in 2011 , a group advocating on behalf of the freeway is working to revive the I @-@ 73 project in Michigan . According to an MDOT spokesman , " to my knowledge , we ’ re not taking that issue up again . " The Lenawee County Road Commission is not interested in the freeway , and according to the president of the Adrian Area Chamber of Commerce , " there seems to be little chance of having an I @-@ 73 link between Toledo and Jackson built in the foreseeable future .

 = Tvrđa = 
 Tvrđa ( Citadel ) is the Old Town of the city of Osijek in Croatia . It is the best @-@ preserved and largest ensemble of Baroque buildings in Croatia and consists of a Habsburg star fort built on the right bank of the River Drava . Tvrđa has been described by the World Monuments Fund as " a unique example of an eighteenth @-@ century baroque military , administrative , and commercial urban center " . 
 The star fort was constructed in the immediate vicinity of medieval Osijek after the defeat of the Ottoman forces in 1687 , due to Osijek 's strategic importance . Constructed starting in 1712 to plans by Mathias von Kaiserfeld and then Maximilian Gosseau de Henef , all five planned bastions and two gates were complete by 1715 . By 1735 , the inner town was finished and three northern bastions had been added . When complete , it was the largest and most advanced Habsburg fortress on the border with the Ottoman Empire , consisting of eight bastions and featuring armories , depots , a garrison headquarters , military court , construction office , a garrison physician , guardhouse , officers ' apartments , a military hospital and seven barracks . The completed fort was entirely surrounded with walls and palisades and had four main gates at each side ( north , south , east , west ) . Tvrđa had street lights by 1717 and was the site of the first public water supply in Croatia , opened in 1751 . 
 Tvrđa 's military importance decreased after the Berlin Congress of 1878 , with the increasing stability of the surrounding region . Most of the fort walls and fortifications were destroyed in the 1920s due to the obstacle they presented to the development of Osijek . While the fortifications have largely been removed , the fort 's interior core remains intact and is now home to churches , museums , schools and other public buildings , as well as numerous bars and restaurants . Of the fortification system , only the northern side of the walls now remain intact , as well as parts of the first and eighth bastions along with the northern gate known as the ' water gate ' ( ' <unk> vrata ' ) . Tvrđa sustained significant damage during the Croatian War of Independence during the 1990s and was featured on the 1996 World Monuments Watch List of Most Endangered Sites . It now features on Croatia 's ' tentative list ' for consideration as a nominee for a World Heritage Site .

 The new name of Osijek first appeared in 1196 . The center of medieval Osijek was on the banks of the River Drava where Tvrđa now stands . The town was a trade and port settlement from the early 12th century due to its position on the way from Pécs and Buda southwards . The site was home to the Romanesque church of the Holy Trinity . Between 1526 and 1687 Osijek was ruled by the Ottomans , who did not change the layout of the settlement in any substantial way but introduced Islamic places of worship , giving the area an Oriental appearance . Traces of medieval and Ottoman towns remain to this day , including a remnant of the old Ottoman fortress wall , known today as the " Turkish Wall " ( Turski <unk> ) or " <unk> 's Fort " ( <unk> <unk> ) , lying next to the Tvrđa access road . 
 During the Ottoman period , Osijek was internationally known because of the Suleiman Bridge . The construction of the bridge was begun by İbrahim Pasha on 16 August 1526 following the orders of Suleiman the Magnificent . The bridge , which connected Osijek and Darda , took the form of a wooden road on piers and was approximately 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 mi ) long and 6 metres ( 20 ft ) wide . Seen as a great threat to Christian Europe the bridge was attacked several times , being destroyed in 1664 , when it was set on fire on the orders of Croatian feudal lord Nicholas VII of Zrin ( Croatian : Nikola VII . Zrinski , Hungarian : VII . Zrínyi Miklós ) . The bridge was rebuilt during the rule of Suleiman II . Finally , it was burned down by the Habsburg armies in 1686 .

 Development of the military settlement at Tvrđa started in 1687 when the Habsburg armies drove the Ottomans out of the city during the Great Turkish War . The chief commander of the Imperial army , Louis William , Margrave of Baden @-@ Baden , saw Osijek as a location of exceptional strategic importance in the war against the Ottomans . He urged the repair of the city walls , and proposed construction of a new fort according to Vauban 's principles of military engineering . 
 The town magistrate was established in 1690 , while the plans for the new fort were still being drawn up , and one of its documents from August of the same year described the condition of the settlement as " ruinous " . Two months later , on 29 October , the Ottoman army suddenly attacked . The attack was repulsed only thanks to a well @-@ organised defense , and the Turks withdrew on 6 November , after a brief siege . The event was a clear lesson that the construction of the fort must not be delayed any further . The first phase of Tvrđa 's conversion into a Baroque fortress was based on the plan devised by the engineer Mathias von Kaiserfeld from 1691 . 
 = = = = Second layout in 18th century = = = = 
 The original plan for Tvrđa was drafted because of the need to reinforce the town walls , but did not include provisions to redesign the interior and envisaged largely uncontrolled development . New plans for a fort on the right bank of the River Drava were drawn up by Maximilian Gosseau de Henef . Gosseau took over planning of the fort when construction was already under way . Starting in August 1712 , Austrian engineers , supervised by the fort 's commander , General Johann Stephan von <unk> , built barracks , staff headquarters , churches and monasteries , surrounded by system of moats , bastions and gun positions , respecting Gosseau 's design . The design followed the model of lowland Dutch military fortifications of the period . 
 By 1715 , all five planned bastions and two gates were complete . An additional , western , gate leading to the Upper Town was added in 1716 . The construction of the outwork on the opposite bank of the River Drava , designed to offer protection from the north and to serve as a bridgehead , was completed by 1721 . The final , fourth gate , leading to the Lower Town , was not added until 1783 . Construction of the inner town was completed by 1733 , and in 1735 three additional northern bastions were completed , along with a post office , the fort 's construction office and a hospital . The completed fort had " eight bastions , two armories , two major depots , garrison headquarters , military court , construction office , garrison physician , guardhouse , officer apartments , military hospital and seven barracks " . Based on the ' ring model ' , the fortifications took up an area of 80 hectares ( 200 acres ) , making Tvrđa the largest fortress on the border with the Ottoman Empire . 
 Gosseau 's plan left space for churches to be built where mosques had once stood . Initially , converted mosques were used as churches , but Franciscans started to build a Baroque church in 1709 and it was consecrated in 1732 . A Franciscan monastery was built between 1699 and 1705 , with a new wing being added between 1731 and 1733 , which subsequently became a new monastery in 1761 . In 1725 , the Jesuits commenced construction of the parish church of St. Michael ( Croatian : Sveti <unk> ) , following the construction of their own monastery . This church was in use after 1734 , despite being incomplete . A Holy Trinity column was erected in the fort 's main square in 1730 as a plague monument featuring volutes with pedestals on which four protectors against the plague are placed . Four additional pedestals were added to the monument in 1784 , each featuring a statue of a saint . Tvrđa had street lighting as early as 1717 . The first system to supply public water in Croatia was opened in Tvrđa in 1751 . 
 In the mid @-@ 18th century there were reportedly more than 35 inns in Tvrđa , estimated to an account for one in three of the fort 's buildings . Crown prince Joseph stayed in one of the inns when visiting Osijek . In 1786 , as Joseph II , he decreed the merger of the Upper Town , Lower Town and Tvrđa into one single town council . 
 = = = 19th and 20th century = = = 
 As early as the second half of the 18th century there was little or no new constructions taking place in Tvrđa , and even maintenance of the fort became a burden . In 1809 Osijek was granted free royal town status . Osijek 's council was accommodated in a building at the south @-@ eastern corner of Tvrđa 's main square . 
 Tvrđa 's military importance decreased after the Berlin Congress of 1878 as a result of increasing political and military stability in the region . Two north @-@ western bastions were demolished in the 1870s , making way for Ambrose 's Park ( Croatian : <unk> <unk> ) . Construction of the Royal Grammar School started in 1881 , and the Royal General Secondary School was completed in 1890 . Episcopal seminary was also built in the south @-@ western corner of the main square in 1898 . These were the only buildings erected within Tvrđa walls in the last three decades of the 19th century . 
 As Osijek grew as a city , the fort 's presence hindered the potential for urban development . The demolition of most of the fort walls happened between 1923 and 1926 , with the construction of an electric tramway . The last gunpowder magazine , located behind the church of St. Michael , was demolished in 1958 . While most of the fortifications have been demolished ( only the first and eighth bastions and the northern wall with its so @-@ called ' water gate ' were kept ) , the center of Tvrđa remains intact . The Yugoslav People 's Army maintained a garrison and a military hospital in Tvrđa , but in the 1980s these buildings were gradually being abandoned , and adapted into ateliers for local painters and sculptors . 
 The fort sustained considerable damage during the Croatian War of Independence , which lasted from 1991 until 1995 . The war brought structural damage from collapsing roofs , walls and floors . These damages threaten plaster , sculpture and murals that lack proper protection and are subject to continuing decay . 
 = = Present day = = 
 After the fortress 's military importance decreased at the end of the 19th century , Tvrđa became a center of administrative , educational , cultural , and scholarly life in Osijek and the entire region . The first school in Osijek was organized at Tvrđa ; the first scholarly curriculum was introduced in 1707 , to be later expanded and renewed , and the first printing press started working in 1735 . The significance of educational institutions of Tvrđa are best underlined by the fact that Croatian Nobel Prize laureates , <unk> <unk> and Vladimir Prelog , along with Serbian scientist Milutin <unk> ( Milankovitch cycles ) , were all alumni ( graduates ) of the Tvrđa schools . The Faculty of Agriculture of the Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek has occupied the former general headquarters since 1995 after its previous site was destroyed in the Croatian War of Independence . The Faculty of Food Technology has been relocated to a building that served as the first military hospital in Osijek , from the mid @-@ 17th century until the beginning of the 1990s . Other present @-@ day educational institutions in Tvrđa include the II and the III Gymnasium , Franjo <unk> Music School ( former Roman Catholic Seminary ) , Jesuit Classical Gymnasium ( former logistics barracks built in the mid @-@ 18th century ) , and the Secondary School of Economics ( former grammar school for girls ) . 
 According to the 2001 census , within the Tvrđa city district , there are 10 @,@ 277 inhabitants living in 3 @,@ 310 households . The fort interior is now a centre of Osijek 's nightlife . There are numerous bars and restaurants in Tvrđa . The fort hosts the Museum of Slavonia , the largest general @-@ type museum in Croatia , located in Tvrđa since 1946 . The former town museum and archives building today houses the State Directorate for Monument Protection , a department of the Croatian Ministry of Culture . The patron saint of the Tvrđa is Saint Michael , and his feast day of September 29 is celebrated as the day of the Tvrđa city district .

 The World Monuments Fund has described Tvrđa as " a unique example of an eighteenth @-@ century baroque military , administrative , and commercial urban center " . Tvrđa is on Croatia 's ' Tentative List ' for consideration as nominee for the World Heritage Site . During the 1991 – 95 conflict in Croatia , 90 per cent of the buildings in Tvrđa were damaged to some extent and the fort was featured on the 1996 World Monuments Watch List of Most Endangered Sites . It has not appeared on the list , published every two years , since .

 The Agency for Restoration of Osijek Tvrđa ( Croatian : <unk> za <unk> <unk> <unk> ) was established in 1999 . Its stated goals are protection , restoration and revitalization of Tvrđa . The restoration process aims to preserve architectural , historical and aesthetic qualities of Tvrđa in full accordance with the restoration principles set by the International Council on Monuments and Sites , while maintaining its multifunctional character . International cooperation is also envisioned , in particular with the Council of Europe . The Agency is jointly funded by the Government of Croatia , Osijek @-@ Baranja County and the City of Osijek .

 = Annamalaiyar Temple = 
 Annamalaiyar Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the deity Shiva , located at the base of Annamalai hills in the town of Thiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu , India . It is significant to the Hindu sect of Saivism as one of the temples associated with the five elements , the Pancha Bhoota <unk> , and specifically the element of fire , or Agni . Shiva is worshiped as Annamalaiyar or <unk> , and is represented by the lingam , with his idol referred to as Agni lingam . His consort Parvati is depicted as Unnamulai Amman . The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work , the Tevaram , written by Tamil saint poets known as the <unk> and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam . The 9th century Saiva saint poet <unk> composed the <unk> here . 
 The temple complex covers 10 hectares , and is one of the largest in India . It houses four gateway towers known as gopurams . The tallest is the eastern tower , with 11 stories and a height of 66 metres ( 217 ft ) , making it one of the tallest temple towers in India . The temple has numerous shrines , with those of Annamalaiyar and Unnamulai Amman being the most prominent . The temple complex houses many halls ; the most notable is the thousand @-@ pillared hall built during the Vijayanagar period . 
 The temple has six daily rituals at various times from 5 : 30 a.m. to 10 p.m. , and twelve yearly festivals on its calendar . The <unk> Deepam festival is celebrated during the day of the full moon between November and December , and a huge beacon is lit atop the hill . It can be seen from miles around , and symbolizes the Shiva lingam of fire joining the sky . The event is witnessed by three million pilgrims . On the day preceding each full moon , pilgrims circumnavigate the temple base and the Annamalai hills in a worship called Girivalam , a practice carried out by one million pilgrims yearly . 
 The present masonry structure was built during the Chola dynasty in the 9th century , while later expansions are attributed to Vijayanagar rulers of the Sangama Dynasty ( 1336 – 1485 CE ) , the Saluva Dynasty and the Tuluva Dynasty ( 1491 – 1570 CE ) .

 In Hindu mythology , Parvati , wife of Shiva , once closed the eyes of her husband playfully in a flower garden at their abode atop Mount Kailash . Although only a moment for the gods , all light was taken from the universe , and the earth , in turn , was submerged in darkness for years . Parvati performed penance along with other devotees of Shiva . Then her husband appeared as a column of fire at the top of Annamalai hills , returning light to the world . He then merged with Parvati to form Ardhanarishvara , the half @-@ female , half @-@ male form of Shiva . The Annamalai , or red mountain , lies behind the Annamalaiyar temple , and is associated with the temple of its namesake . The hill is sacred and considered a lingam , or iconic representation of Shiva , in itself . 
 Another legend is that once , while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority , Shiva appeared as a flame , and challenged them to find his source . Brahma took the form of a swan , and flew to the sky to see the top of the flame , while Vishnu became the boar Varaha , and sought its base . The scene is called <unk> , and is represented in the western wall at the sanctum of most Shiva temples . Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source , and while Vishnu conceded his defeat , Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle . In punishment , Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship . 
 = = History = = 
 The present masonry and towers date back to the 9th century CE , as seen from an inscription in the structure made by Chola kings who ruled at that time . Further inscriptions indicate that before the 9th century , Tiruvannamalai was under the Pallava Kings , who ruled from Kanchipuram . The 7th century Nayanar saints Sambandar and Appar wrote of the temple in their poetic work , Tevaram . Sekkizhar , the author of the Periyapuranam wrote that both Appar and Sambandar worshiped Annamalaiyar in the temple . The Chola Kings ruled over the region for more than four centuries , from 850 CE to 1280 CE , and were temple patrons . The inscriptions from the Chola king record various gifts like land , sheep , cow and oil to the temple commemorating various victories of the dynasty . The Hoysala kings used Tiruvannamalai as their capital beginning in 1328 CE . There are 48 inscriptions from the Sangama Dynasty ( 1336 – 1485 CE ) , 2 inscriptions from Saluva Dynasty , and 55 inscriptions from Tuluva Dynasty ( 1491 – 1570 CE ) of the Vijayanagara Empire , reflecting gifts to the temple from their rulers . There are also inscriptions from the rule of Krishnadeva Raya ( 1509 – 1529 CE ) , the most powerful Vijayanagara king , indicating further patronage . Most of the Vijayanagara inscriptions were written in Tamil , with some in Kannada and Sanskrit . The inscriptions in temple from the Vijayanagara kings indicate emphasis on administrative matters and local concerns , which contrasts the inscriptions of the same rulers in other temples like Tirupathi . The majority of the gift related inscriptions are for land <unk> , followed by goods , cash endowments , cows and oil for lighting lamps . The town of Tiruvannamalai was at a strategic crossroads during the Vijayanagara Empire , connecting sacred centers of pilgrimage and military routes . There are inscriptions that show the area as an urban center before the precolonial period , with the city developing around the temple , similar to the Nayak ruled cities like Madurai . 
 During the 17th century CE , the temple along with the Tiruvannamalai town came under the dominion of the Nawab of the Carnatic . As the Mughal empire came to an end , the Nawab lost control of the town , with confusion and chaos ensuing after 1753 . Subsequently , there were periods of both Hindu and Muslim stewardship of the temple , with <unk> Raya , Krishna Raya , <unk> Ali Khan , and <unk> <unk> besieging the temple in succession . As European incursions progressed , Tiruvannamalai was attacked by French <unk> , <unk> , and the English Captain Stephen Smith . While some were repelled , others were victorious . The French occupied the town in 1757 , and the temple along with the town came under control of the British in 1760 . In 1790 CE , Tiruvannamalai town was captured by Tippu Sultan , who ruled from 1750 – 99 CE . During the first half of the 19th century , the town along with the temple came under British rule . From 1951 , under the provision of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act , the temple has been maintained by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board ( HR & CE ) of the Government of Tamil Nadu . In 2002 , the Archaeological Survey of India declared the temple a national heritage monument and took over its stewardship . Widespread protests and litigation with the Supreme Court of India , however , led the Archaeological Survey to cede the temple back to the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board .

 Falcon 's Fury is a free @-@ standing Sky Jump drop tower attraction at the Busch Gardens Tampa amusement park in Tampa , Florida , United States . Manufactured by Intaride ( a subsidiary of Intamin ) , the ride reaches a maximum height of 335 feet ( 102 m ) making it North America 's tallest free @-@ standing drop tower . Riders experience about five seconds of free fall , reaching a speed of 60 miles per hour ( 100 km / h ) . The ride 's name was chosen to invoke a falcon 's ability to dive steeply at high speed to capture prey . 
 The project was originally planned to begin in 2012 with the ride opening in 2013 , but it was delayed by one year . Construction began in 2013 with a scheduled opening date of May 1 , 2014 ; however , the opening was delayed due to mechanical and technical issues . Following a preview opening to park employees in early August and a soft opening on August 16 , 2014 , Falcon 's Fury officially opened to the public on September 2 , 2014 . Public response to the ride has been positive , praising the height of the tower and the drop experience .

 Planning for Falcon 's Fury began around the time the park completed its Cheetah Hunt ride in 2011 . Ground tests in the Timbuktu area ( now known as <unk> ) revealed " interesting soil conditions " , with steel beams and concrete required to reinforce the site . 
 Rumors that Busch Gardens Tampa might replace its Sandstorm ride with a 200 @-@ foot ( 61 m ) drop tower surfaced in the fall of 2011 when its sister park , Busch Gardens Williamsburg , opened Mäch Tower that August . Construction surveying was observed in January 2012 . Two months later plans were filed with the city to build a drop tower , possibly for the 2013 season . Speculation about the new attraction 's name began when SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment , owners of Busch Gardens Tampa , filed trademark applications for " Desert Dive " and " Falcon 's Fury " on May 2 and July 11 , 2012 , respectively , and bought the <unk> domain name . When permits for the new ride differed from those for Mäch Tower in November 2012 , rumors began that the seats would tilt forward . Due to the height of the attraction , approval from the Federal Aviation Administration was required . According to the FAA and the city of Tampa , the tower was supposed to be built in December 2012 and open to the public in 2013 . For unknown reasons the project was delayed , with its construction pushed back to the second half of 2013 . 
 On May 31 , 2013 , it was announced that Sandstorm would close on June 2 to make room for a new attraction . About two weeks later , on June 11 , Busch Gardens Tampa announced plans for Falcon 's Fury and construction began that month . During the fourth quarter of 2013 , the park drove steel piles for the ride 's foundation nightly for about a month . 
 On September 20 , the tower for Falcon 's Fury was shipped from Spain in nine sections , arriving at the park near the end of October ; the ride 's smaller parts had been delivered earlier from several European countries . Installation of one of the nine tower pieces was planned for every other night , with the last piece in place by New Year 's Eve . Construction was done by the Adena Corporation , and on November 18 the first piece was installed . The ride 's second piece was installed on December 2 , and two more were installed by December 6 . The fifth section was placed by December 21 , and the sixth was erected by New Year 's Day . The seventh tower piece was installed by January 3 , 2014 , and the eighth by January 5 , reaching a height of about 300 feet ( 91 m ) , and Falcon 's Fury 's gondola was seen at the park on January 12 . The ride 's counterweight was installed on January 22 , and the tower was capped during the weekend of February 1 . Work on the ride 's electrical components then began . Assembly of the gondola was completed by the end of March . Testing was originally scheduled to begin in February , but due to construction delays the first drop tests were not made until April 15 . Tower painting began in June , with its sunset motif estimated to take 60 hours over a three @-@ week period . 
 At the end of February , Busch Gardens Tampa announced that Falcon 's Fury would open on May 1 , and on April 3 the park began a sweepstakes contest for its " Falcon 's Fury First @-@ to @-@ Ride Party " . A second , similar contest began on April 11 , with fifty winners from each contest being among the first riders . A week later , the park announced that the ride 's opening would be delayed , and several media events scheduled for April and May ( including the First @-@ to @-@ Ride party ) were cancelled . It was later disclosed that the delay was due to manufacturing and technical issues with the cables which pull the gondola up the tower . During the week of August 10 , Falcon 's Fury opened for park employees . On August 16 the ride soft @-@ opened to the public , and two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half weeks later Falcon 's Fury officially opened . 
 = = Ride experience = = 
 Falcon 's Fury has two shaded queue lines : a standby line which can hold guests for about 45 minutes , and a Quick Queue for guests with passes that allow them to bypass the standby line . Although the Quick Queue system will not initially be used for the ride , it may be added later . Riders must be between 54 inches ( 137 cm ) and 77 inches ( 196 cm ) . 
 When the riders are seated a catch car connects to the gondola and raises it to the top of the tower , which takes about one minute . Although the tower is 335 feet ( 102 m ) high , the gondola stops 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) lower . When it reaches the maximum height the seats tilt forward , with a computer @-@ randomized wait time from one to five seconds . When the wait time ends , the gondola is released from the catch car into a five @-@ second free fall reaching a maximum speed of 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) . As the gondola passes through the pre @-@ braking section , the seats rotate back into a vertical position . After the pre @-@ brake the gondola enters the main magnetic @-@ brake run , where riders experience approximately 3 @.@ 5 g ( 34 m / s2 ) of deceleration as the gondola slows . When it comes to a full stop at the base of the tower , the riders disembark . One cycle of the ride lasts about one and a half minutes . Busch Gardens Tampa placed an Easter egg in the form of a painted Falcon 's Fury logo on top of one of its buildings , which can be seen only from a certain side of the gondola .

 The tower and gondola were manufactured by Intaride , a subsidiary of Intamin . The ride covers an area of about 3 @,@ 600 square feet ( 330 m2 ) . 
 = = = Tower = = = 
 The Falcon 's Fury tower is 335 feet ( 102 m ) tall , the tallest free @-@ standing drop tower in North America , and can bend 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) in any direction from the top to withstand hurricane @-@ force winds . The tower is composed of nine sections , including the machine house . Each piece of the tower weighs up to 105 tonnes ( 103 long tons ; 116 short tons ) , and the entire structure weighs about 519 tonnes ( 511 long tons ; 572 short tons ) . The 77 tonnes ( 76 long tons ; 85 short tons ) machine house at the top contains four DC motors used to lift the gondola . Inside the tower is a 68 tonnes ( 67 long tons ; 75 short tons ) counterweight , composed of hundreds of lead weights , to help raise the gondola . The tower 's foundation is made up of 105 steel piles , varying in depth from 75 feet ( 23 m ) to 205 feet ( 62 m ) . A 138 @-@ foot ( 42 m ) eddy current brake system on the tower slows the gondola after its free fall . The structure is painted yellow , aqua and two shades of red . 
 = = = Gondola = = = 
 The ride 's single gondola has 32 seats , grouped octagonally around the tower . Each of the eight sides seats four riders , and each seat has an over @-@ the @-@ shoulder restraint and seat belt . Falcon 's Fury can theoretically accommodate 800 riders per hour . Carbon @-@ fiber wings buttress each end of a group of seats , protecting outside riders ' arms and legs during the drop . The gondola reaches a height of 310 feet ( 94 m ) , 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) below the top of the tower . When it reaches its maximum height the seats tilt 90 degrees forward , with the riders facing the ground ( the first use of this feature on a drop tower ) .

 When Falcon 's Fury opened it became North America 's tallest free @-@ standing drop tower . Although taller drop towers exist on the continent — such as Lex Luthor : Drop of Doom at Six Flags Magic Mountain and Zumanjaro : Drop of Doom at Six Flags Great Adventure , which reach drop heights of 400 feet ( 120 m ) and 415 feet ( 126 m ) respectively — those attractions were added to existing structures . Despite its height , the ride 's maximum speed of 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) does not set a speed record . Other drop towers — such as Drop Tower at Kings Dominion , which reaches 72 miles per hour ( 116 km / h ) — are faster . However , Falcon 's Fury is the world 's first drop tower whose seats tilt 90 degrees . Although tilting seats were first used by Intamin in 2001 on <unk> at Six Flags Over Georgia , their tilt angle is smaller . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The initial reception after the ride 's announcement was positive . According to Lance Hart , a theme park enthusiast from Screamscape , " Instead of selling your picture ... they should sell baby wipes and clean underwear at the exit " and the ride could be the most frightening drop tower in the world . Robb Alvey of Theme Park Review called the ride the world 's best drop tower , later ranking it one of the top 14 new attractions for 2014 ; Dave Parfitt and Arthur Levine of USA Today ranked Falcon 's Fury in their top ten . Brady MacDonald of the Los Angeles Times originally ranked Falcon 's Fury his seventh @-@ most @-@ anticipated ride for 2014 ; on an updated list , he ranked it 17th . 
 For safety reasons , construction on Falcon 's Fury was done primarily at night . Residents near the park complained about noise from the pile driver during the laying of the foundation , and complaints about the ride 's operating noise continued into August 2014 . 
 According to the park and Twitter posts selected by news media , public response during the soft opening was positive ; Total Orlando gave the ride five stars for teenagers and four stars for adults . On <unk> " Ashley " said that although the restraints were tight , they were comfortable and not as tight as those on other rides , adding : " The drop on Falcon 's Fury is different from any ride I have ever ridden . The best way I can describe it is that instead of leaving your stomach at the top of the tower , you take it with you to the bottom . " According to Florida Trip Guides , the ride was a good addition to the park 's attraction lineup : " Falcon 's Fury is not for the faint of heart . I have ridden dozens of drop towers but this one is different . Something about facing straight down and falling really makes you nervous . " Robert Niles of Theme Park Insider said that Falcon 's Fury and other recent attractions were nearing the extreme of human tolerance ; as a result , " You 're getting to the point where instead of making an attraction more popular by having it achieve some type of record , you 're actually limiting the audience for that . " Randi Nissenbaum of Bay News 9 called the view from the top of the tower incredible , and although she was nervous at first she wanted to ride again . Sue Carlton of the Tampa Bay Times said , " it was terrifying and thrilling and I held on as hard as I could and yelled and closed my eyes and afterward stepped off rubber @-@ kneed and exhilarated . " 
 For the 2014 season , Busch Gardens Tampa expected attendance to increase by three to eight percent . However ( as predicted in June 2014 by IBISWorld Research ) , combined attendance for the second quarter of the year increased by about 0 @.@ 3 percent for SeaWorld Orlando , SeaWorld San Diego , SeaWorld San Antonio , Busch Gardens Williamsburg and Busch Gardens Tampa . Compared to the same period in 2013 , combined attendance for the first half of the year dropped by just over four percent . Busch Gardens Tampa blamed the lack of its anticipated attendance increase partially on the Falcon 's Fury delays . 
 = Price elasticity of demand = 
 Price elasticity of demand ( PED or Ed ) is a measure used in economics to show the responsiveness , or elasticity , of the quantity demanded of a good or service to a change in its price , ceteris paribus . More precisely , it gives the percentage change in quantity demanded in response to a one percent change in price ( ceteris paribus ) 
 Price elasticities are almost always negative , although analysts tend to ignore the sign even though this can lead to ambiguity . Only goods which do not conform to the law of demand , such as Veblen and Giffen goods , have a positive PED . In general , the demand for a good is said to be inelastic ( or relatively inelastic ) when the PED is less than one ( in absolute value ) : that is , changes in price have a relatively small effect on the quantity of the good demanded . The demand for a good is said to be elastic ( or relatively elastic ) when its PED is greater than one ( in absolute value ) : that is , changes in price have a relatively large effect on the quantity of a good demanded . 
 Revenue is maximized when price is set so that the PED is exactly one . The PED of a good can also be used to predict the incidence ( or " burden " ) of a tax on that good . Various research methods are used to determine price elasticity , including test markets , analysis of historical sales data and conjoint analysis . 
 = = Definition = = 
 It is a measure of responsiveness of the quantity of a raw good or service demanded to changes in its price . The formula for the coefficient of price elasticity of demand for a good is : 
 <formula> 
 The above formula usually yields a negative value , due to the inverse nature of the relationship between price and quantity demanded , as described by the " law of demand " . For example , if the price increases by 5 % and quantity demanded decreases by 5 % , then the elasticity at the initial price and quantity 
 = − 5 % / 5 % = 
 − 1 . The only classes of goods which have a PED of greater than 0 are Veblen and Giffen goods . Although the PED is negative for the vast majority of goods and services , economists often refer to price elasticity of demand as a positive value ( i.e. , in absolute value terms ) . 
 This measure of elasticity is sometimes referred to as the own @-@ price elasticity of demand for a good , i.e. , the elasticity of demand with respect to the good 's own price , in order to distinguish it from the elasticity of demand for that good with respect to the change in the price of some other good , i.e. , a complementary or substitute good . The latter type of elasticity measure is called a cross @-@ price elasticity of demand . 
 As the difference between the two prices or quantities increases , the accuracy of the PED given by the formula above decreases for a combination of two reasons . First , the PED for a good is not necessarily constant ; as explained below , PED can vary at different points along the demand curve , due to its percentage nature . Elasticity is not the same thing as the slope of the demand curve , which is dependent on the units used for both price and quantity . Second , percentage changes are not symmetric ; instead , the percentage change between any two values depends on which one is chosen as the starting value and which as the ending value . For example , if quantity demanded increases from 10 units to 15 units , the percentage change is 50 % , i.e. , ( 15 − 10 ) ÷ 10 ( converted to a percentage ) . But if quantity demanded decreases from 15 units to 10 units , the percentage change is − 33 @.@ 3 % , i.e. , ( 10 − 15 ) ÷ 15 . 
 Two alternative elasticity measures avoid or minimise these shortcomings of the basic elasticity formula : point @-@ price elasticity and arc elasticity . 
 = = = Point @-@ price elasticity of demand = = = 
 Point elasticity of demand method is used to determine change in demand within same demand curve , basically a very small amount of change in demand is measured through point elasticity . ( <unk> , R. ) One way to avoid the accuracy problem described above is to minimise the difference between the starting and ending prices and quantities . This is the approach taken in the definition of point @-@ price elasticity , which uses differential calculus to calculate the elasticity for an infinitesimal change in price and quantity at any given point on the demand curve : 
 <formula> 
 In other words , it is equal to the absolute value of the first derivative of quantity with respect to price ( <unk> / <unk> ) multiplied by the point 's price ( P ) divided by its quantity ( Qd ) . 
 In terms of partial @-@ differential calculus , point @-@ price elasticity of demand can be defined as follows : let <formula> be the demand of goods <formula> as a function of parameters price and wealth , and let <formula> be the demand for good <formula> . The elasticity of demand for good <formula> with respect to price <formula> is 
 <formula> 
 However , the point @-@ price elasticity can be computed only if the formula for the demand function , <formula> , is known so its derivative with respect to price , <formula> , can be determined . 
 = = = Arc elasticity = = = 
 A second solution to the asymmetry problem of having a PED dependent on which of the two given points on a demand curve is chosen as the " original " point and which as the " new " one is to compute the percentage change in P and Q relative to the average of the two prices and the average of the two quantities , rather than just the change relative to one point or the other . Loosely speaking , this gives an " average " elasticity for the section of the actual demand curve — i.e. , the arc of the curve — between the two points . As a result , this measure is known as the arc elasticity , in this case with respect to the price of the good . The arc elasticity is defined mathematically as : 
 <formula> 
 This method for computing the price elasticity is also known as the " midpoints formula " , because the average price and average quantity are the coordinates of the midpoint of the straight line between the two given points . This formula is an application of the midpoint method . However , because this formula implicitly assumes the section of the demand curve between those points is linear , the greater the curvature of the actual demand curve is over that range , the worse this approximation of its elasticity will be . 
 = = History = = 
 Together with the concept of an economic " elasticity " coefficient , Alfred Marshall is credited with defining PED ( " elasticity of demand " ) in his book Principles of Economics , published in 1890 . He described it thus : " And we may say generally : — the elasticity ( or responsiveness ) of demand in a market is great or small according as the amount demanded increases much or little for a given fall in price , and diminishes much or little for a given rise in price " . He reasons this since " the only universal law as to a person 's desire for a commodity is that it diminishes ... but this diminution may be slow or rapid . If it is slow ... a small fall in price will cause a comparatively large increase in his purchases . But if it is rapid , a small fall in price will cause only a very small increase in his purchases . In the former case ... the elasticity of his wants , we may say , is great . In the latter case ... the elasticity of his demand is small . " Mathematically , the <unk> PED was based on a point @-@ price definition , using differential calculus to calculate elasticities . 
 = = Determinants = = 
 The overriding factor in determining PED is the willingness and ability of consumers after a price change to postpone immediate consumption decisions concerning the good and to search for substitutes ( " wait and look " ) . A number of factors can thus affect the elasticity of demand for a good : 
 Availability of substitute goods 
 The more and closer the substitutes available , the higher the elasticity is likely to be , as people can easily switch from one good to another if an even minor price change is made ; There is a strong substitution effect . If no close substitutes are available , the substitution effect will be small and the demand inelastic . 
 Breadth of definition of a good 
 The broader the definition of a good ( or service ) , the lower the elasticity . For example , Company X 's fish and chips would tend to have a relatively high elasticity of demand if a significant number of substitutes are available , whereas food in general would have an extremely low elasticity of demand because no substitutes exist . 
 Percentage of income 
 The higher the percentage of the consumer 's income that the product 's price represents , the higher the elasticity tends to be , as people will pay more attention when purchasing the good because of its cost ; The income effect is substantial . When the goods represent only a negligible portion of the budget the income effect will be insignificant and demand inelastic , 
 Necessity 
 The more necessary a good is , the lower the elasticity , as people will attempt to buy it no matter the price , such as the case of insulin for those who need it . 
 Duration 
 For most goods , the longer a price change holds , the higher the elasticity is likely to be , as more and more consumers find they have the time and inclination to search for substitutes . When fuel prices increase suddenly , for instance , consumers may still fill up their empty tanks in the short run , but when prices remain high over several years , more consumers will reduce their demand for fuel by switching to carpooling or public transportation , investing in vehicles with greater fuel economy or taking other measures . This does not hold for consumer <unk> such as the cars themselves , however ; eventually , it may become necessary for consumers to replace their present cars , so one would expect demand to be less elastic . 
 Brand loyalty 
 An attachment to a certain brand — either out of tradition or because of proprietary barriers — can override sensitivity to price changes , resulting in more inelastic demand . 
 Who pays 
 Where the purchaser does not directly pay for the good they consume , such as with corporate expense accounts , demand is likely to be more inelastic . 
 = = Interpreting values of price elasticity coefficients = = 
 <unk> of demand are interpreted as follows : 
 A decrease in the price of a good normally results in an increase in the quantity demanded by consumers because of the law of demand , and conversely , quantity demanded decreases when price rises . As summarized in the table above , the PED for a good or service is referred to by different descriptive terms depending on whether the elasticity coefficient is greater than , equal to , or less than − 1 . That is , the demand for a good is called : 
 relatively inelastic when the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price ( so that Ed > - 1 ) ; 
 unit elastic , unit elasticity , unitary elasticity , or <unk> elastic demand when the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to the percentage change in price ( so that Ed = - 1 ) ; and 
 relatively elastic when the percentage change in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage change in price ( so that Ed < - 1 ) . 
 As the two accompanying diagrams show , perfectly elastic demand is represented graphically as a horizontal line , and perfectly inelastic demand as a vertical line . These are the only cases in which the PED and the slope of the demand curve ( ∆ P / ∆ Q ) are both constant , as well as the only cases in which the PED is determined solely by the slope of the demand curve ( or more precisely , by the inverse of that slope ) . 
 = = Relation to marginal revenue = = 
 The following equation holds : 
 <formula> 
 where 
 R ' is the marginal revenue 
 P is the price 
 Proof : 
 TR = Total Revenue <formula> <formula> <formula> 
 On a graph with both a demand curve and a marginal revenue curve , demand will be elastic at all quantities where marginal revenue is positive . Demand is unit elastic at the quantity where marginal revenue is zero . Demand is inelastic at every quantity where marginal revenue is negative . 
 = = Effect on total revenue = = 
 A firm considering a price change must know what effect the change in price will have on total revenue . Revenue is simply the product of unit price times quantity : 
 <formula> 
 Generally any change in price will have two effects : 
 The price effect 
 For inelastic goods , an increase in unit price will tend to increase revenue , while a decrease in price will tend to decrease revenue . ( The effect is reversed for elastic goods . ) 
 The quantity effect 
 An increase in unit price will tend to lead to fewer units sold , while a decrease in unit price will tend to lead to more units sold . 
 For inelastic goods , because of the inverse nature of the relationship between price and quantity demanded ( i.e. , the law of demand ) , the two effects affect total revenue in opposite directions . But in determining whether to increase or decrease prices , a firm needs to know what the net effect will be . Elasticity provides the answer : The percentage change in total revenue is approximately equal to the percentage change in quantity demanded plus the percentage change in price . ( One change will be positive , the other negative . ) The percentage change in quantity is related to the percentage change in price by elasticity : hence the percentage change in revenue can be calculated by knowing the elasticity and the percentage change in price alone . 
 As a result , the relationship between PED and total revenue can be described for any good : 
 When the price elasticity of demand for a good is perfectly inelastic ( Ed 
 = 0 ) , changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good ; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase . Goods necessary to survival can be classified here ; a rational person will be willing to pay anything for a good if the alternative is death . For example , a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet , no matter how much , for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die . His demand is not contingent on the price . 
 When the price elasticity of demand for a good is relatively inelastic ( -1 < Ed < 0 ) , the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller than that in price . Hence , when the price is raised , the total revenue increases , and vice versa . 
 When the price elasticity of demand for a good is unit ( or unitary ) elastic ( Ed = 
 -1 ) , the percentage change in quantity demanded is equal to that in price , so a change in price will not affect total revenue . 
 When the price elasticity of demand for a good is relatively elastic ( - ∞ < Ed < -1 ) , the percentage change in quantity demanded is greater than that in price . Hence , when the price is raised , the total revenue falls , and vice versa . 
 When the price elasticity of demand for a good is perfectly elastic ( Ed is − ∞ ) , any increase in the price , no matter how small , will cause the quantity demanded for the good to drop to zero . Hence , when the price is raised , the total revenue falls to zero . This situation is typical for goods that have their value defined by law ( such as fiat currency ) ; if a 5 dollar bill were sold for anything more than 5 dollars , nobody would buy it , so demand is zero . 
 Hence , as the accompanying diagram shows , total revenue is maximized at the combination of price and quantity demanded where the elasticity of demand is unitary . 
 It is important to realize that price @-@ elasticity of demand is not necessarily constant over all price ranges . The linear demand curve in the accompanying diagram illustrates that changes in price also change the elasticity : the price elasticity is different at every point on the curve . 
 = = Effect on tax incidence = = 
 PEDs , in combination with price elasticity of supply ( PES ) , can be used to assess where the incidence ( or " burden " ) of a per @-@ unit tax is falling or to predict where it will fall if the tax is imposed . For example , when demand is perfectly inelastic , by definition consumers have no alternative to purchasing the good or service if the price increases , so the quantity demanded would remain constant . Hence , suppliers can increase the price by the full amount of the tax , and the consumer would end up paying the entirety . In the opposite case , when demand is perfectly elastic , by definition consumers have an infinite ability to switch to alternatives if the price increases , so they would stop buying the good or service in question completely — quantity demanded would fall to zero . As a result , firms cannot pass on any part of the tax by raising prices , so they would be forced to pay all of it themselves . 
 In practice , demand is likely to be only relatively elastic or relatively inelastic , that is , somewhere between the extreme cases of perfect elasticity or inelasticity . More generally , then , the higher the elasticity of demand compared to PES , the heavier the burden on producers ; conversely , the more inelastic the demand compared to PES , the heavier the burden on consumers . The general principle is that the party ( i.e. , consumers or producers ) that has fewer opportunities to avoid the tax by switching to alternatives will bear the greater proportion of the tax burden . In the end the whole tax burden is carried by individual households since they are the ultimate owners of the means of production that the firm utilises ( see Circular flow of income ) . 
 PED and PES can also have an effect on the deadweight loss associated with a tax regime . When PED , PES or both are inelastic , the deadweight loss is lower than a comparable scenario with higher elasticity . 
 = = Optimal pricing = = 
 Among the most common applications of price elasticity is to determine prices that maximize revenue or profit . 
 = = = Constant elasticity and optimal pricing = = = 
 If one point elasticity is used to model demand changes over a finite range of prices , elasticity is implicitly assumed constant with respect to price over the finite price range . The equation defining price elasticity for one product can be rewritten ( omitting secondary variables ) as a linear equation . 
 <formula> 
 where 
 <formula> is the elasticity , and <formula> is a constant . 
 Similarly , the equations for cross elasticity for <formula> products can be written as a set of <formula> simultaneous linear equations . 
 <formula> 
 where 
 <formula> and <formula> , and <formula> are constants ; and appearance of a letter index as both an upper index and a lower index in the same term implies summation over that index . 
 This form of the equations shows that point elasticities assumed constant over a price range cannot determine what prices generate maximum values of <formula> ; similarly they cannot predict prices that generate maximum <formula> or maximum revenue . 
 Constant elasticities can predict optimal pricing only by computing point elasticities at several points , to determine the price at which point elasticity equals -1 ( or , for multiple products , the set of prices at which the point elasticity matrix is the negative identity matrix ) . 
 = = = Non @-@ constant elasticity and optimal pricing = = = 
 If the definition of price elasticity is extended to yield a quadratic relationship between demand units ( <formula> ) and price , then it is possible to compute prices that maximize <formula> , <formula> , and revenue . The fundamental equation for one product becomes 
 <formula> 
 and the corresponding equation for several products becomes 
 <formula> 
 Excel models are available that compute constant elasticity , and use non @-@ constant elasticity to estimate prices that optimize revenue or profit for one product or several products . 
 = = = Limitations of revenue @-@ maximizing and profit @-@ maximizing pricing strategies = = = 
 In most situations , revenue @-@ maximizing prices are not profit @-@ maximizing prices . For example , if variable costs per unit are nonzero ( which they almost always are ) , then a more complex computation of a similar kind yields prices that generate optimal profits . 
 In some situations , profit @-@ maximizing prices are not an optimal strategy . For example , where scale economies are large ( as they often are ) , capturing market share may be the key to long @-@ term dominance of a market , so maximizing revenue or profit may not be the optimal strategy . 
 = = Selected price elasticities = = 
 Various research methods are used to calculate price elasticities in real life , including analysis of historic sales data , both public and private , and use of present @-@ day surveys of customers ' preferences to build up test markets capable of modelling such changes . Alternatively , conjoint analysis ( a ranking of users ' preferences which can then be statistically analysed ) may be used . 
 Though PEDs for most demand schedules vary depending on price , they can be modeled assuming constant elasticity . Using this method , the PEDs for various goods — intended to act as examples of the theory described above — are as follows . For suggestions on why these goods and services may have the PED shown , see the above section on determinants of price elasticity . 
 = Mamucium = 
 Mamucium , also known as Mancunium , was a fort in the Roman province of Britannia . The remains of the fort , protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument , are in the Castlefield area of Manchester in North West England ( grid reference <unk> ) . Founded c . AD 79 , Mamucium was garrisoned by a cohort of auxiliary soldiers and guarded the road running from Chester to York . A vicus , or civilian settlement made up of traders and the families of the soldiers , grew outside the fort and was an area of industrial activity . 
 The site lay in ruins until the Industrial Revolution when Manchester expanded and the fort was levelled to make way for new developments . It was damaged by the construction of the Rochdale Canal and the Great Northern Railway . The site is now part of the regenerated area of warehousing alongside the Rochdale Canal , part of the Castlefield Urban Heritage Park . Reconstructed remains of the fort 's gatehouse , granaries , and some buildings from the vicus are on display to the public . 
 = = Location = = 
 When the Roman fort in Castlefield was built , it was on a naturally defensible sandstone bluff , guarding a nearby crossing over the River Medlock . The fort was near a junction between at least two Roman roads . It guarded the road between the legionary fortresses of Deva Victrix ( Chester ) and Eboracum ( York ) running east to west , as well as the road between Manchester and Bremetennacum ( Ribchester ) to the north . In addition , Mamucium may also have overlooked a lesser road running north west to Coccium ( Wigan ) . The fort was one of a chain of fortifications along the Eboracum to Deva Victrix road , with Castleshaw Roman fort lying 16 miles ( 26 km ) to the east , and <unk> ( Northwich ) 18 miles ( 29 km ) to the west . Stamps on tegulae indicate that Mamucium had administrative links not only with Castleshaw , but also with Ardotalia , the nearest fort ( 12 miles ) , Slack and <unk> ; all the forts probably got the tegulae from the same place in <unk> Wood near Huddersfield . 
 The area around the fort changed greatly in the centuries that followed ; the remains are now surrounded by mills built during Industrial Revolution and were further damaged by the subsequent urbanisation of Manchester . Castlefield is at the south west corner of Manchester city centre and the Rochdale Canal cuts through the southern corner of the fort . Deansgate , which has developed into a busy thoroughfare , passes close to the east of the fort and follows the general line of Roman road to Ribchester and Castlefield . 
 = = Name = = 
 The name Mamucium is generally thought to represent a Latinisation of an original Brittonic name , either from <unk> ( " breast " , in reference to a " breast @-@ like hill " ) or from mamma ( " mother " , in reference to a local river goddess ) . Both meanings are preserved in languages derived from Common Brittonic , mam meaning " breast " in Irish and " mother " in Welsh . The neuter suffix -ium is used in Latin placenames , particularly those representing Common Brittonic <unk> ( a genitive suffix denoting " place or city of ~ " ) . The Welsh name for Manchester is <unk> and presumably derives from the original Brittonic form .

 Although there is no evidence of prehistoric settlement , there is evidence of activity in the area . A Neolithic scraper , two Mesolithic flints and a flint flake have been discovered , as well as a shard of late Bronze Age pottery ; however these were mostly not found in situ . Although the area was in the territory of the Celtic tribe Brigantes until the Romans annexed the area , it may have been under the control of the <unk> , a sub @-@ tribe of the Brigantes .

 The fort was built around AD 79 ; it was built as part of the fortifications erected under <unk> . Julius Agricola during his campaigns against the Brigantes after the treaty with them failed . Excavations have demonstrated that the fort had three main phases of construction : one around AD 79 , the second around 160 AD , and the third around 200 . The first phase of the fort was built from turf and timber . Mamucium was designed to be garrisoned by a cohort , about 500 infantry . They would have been drawn from an auxiliary , the non @-@ citizen soldiers of the Roman army . A civilian settlement ( called a vicus ) grew around the fort in the late 1st and early 2nd centuries . Around the year 90 , the ramparts surrounding the fort were strengthened . Manchester and the Roman fort at Slack – which neighboured Castleshaw – superseded the fort at Castleshaw in the 120s . Mamucium was demolished some time around 140 . Although the vicus grew rapidly in the early 2nd century , it was abandoned some time between 120 and 160 – broadly coinciding with the demolition of the fort – before it was re @-@ inhabited when the fort was rebuilt . 
 There is a possible temple to Mithras associated with the civilian settlement in modern Hulme . An altar dedicated to " Fortune the Preserver " was found , probably dating to the early 3rd century . In 2008 an altar dating from the late 1st century was discovered near the Roman settlement . It was dedicated to two minor Germanic gods and described as being in " fantastic " condition . The County Archaeologist said 
 " It 's the first Roman stone inscription to be found in Manchester for 150 years and records only the second known Roman from Manchester ... The preservation of the stone is remarkable . On top of the stone is a shallow bowl which was used for offerings of wine or blood or perhaps to burn incense . " 
 As well as Pagan worship , there is also evidence of early Christian worship . In the 1970s , a fragment of 2nd @-@ century " word square " was discovered with an anagram of <unk> <unk> . There has been discussion by academics whether the " word square " , which is carved on a piece of amphora , is actually a Christian artefact , if so , it is one of the earliest examples of Christianity in Britain . 
 The second phase was built around the year 160 . Although it was again of turf and timber construction , it was larger than the previous fort , measuring 2 hectares ( 4 @.@ 9 acres ) to accommodate extra granaries ( <unk> ) . Around 200 , the gatehouses of the fort were rebuilt in stone and the walls surrounding the fort were given a stone facing . The concentration of furnaces in sheds in part of the vicus associated with the fort has been described as an " industrial estate " , which would have been the first in Manchester . Mamucium was included in the Antonine Itinerary , a 3rd @-@ century register of roads throughout the Roman Empire . This and inscriptions on and repairs to buildings indicate that Mamucium was still in use in the first half of the 3rd century . The vicus may have been abandoned by the mid @-@ 3rd century ; this is supported by the excavated remains of some buildings that were demolished and the materials robbed for use elsewhere . Evidence from coins indicates that although the civilian settlement associated with the fort had declined by the mid @-@ 3rd century , a small garrison may have remained at Mamucium into the late 3rd century and early 4th century .

 After the Roman withdrawal from Britain around 410 , the area of Mamucium was used for agricultural purposes . It has sometimes been identified with the Cair <unk> listed among the 28 cities of Britain by the History of the Britons traditionally attributed to Nennius . After lying derelict for centuries , the ruins were commented on by antiquarians John Leland in the 16th century , William Camden in the late 16th and early 17th centuries , and William Stukeley and the Manchester historian John Whitaker in the 18th century . In the early 18th century , John Horsley said : 
 It [ i.e. , the fort ] is about a quarter of a mile out of the town , being south or south @-@ west from it . The station now goes by the name of Giant 's Castle or Tarquin 's Castle , and the field in which it stands is called Castle Field ... the ramparts are still very conspicuous . 
 Whitaker described what remained of the fort in 1773 : 
 The eastern side , like the Western , is hundred and forty [ yards ] in length , and for eighty yards from the northern termination , the nearly perpendicular rampart carries a crest of more than two [ yards ] in height . It is then lowered to form the great entrance , the Porta Pretoria of the camp : the earth there running in a ridge , and mounting up to the top of the bank , about ten in breadth . Then , rising gradually as the wall falls away , it carries an height of more than three for as many as the south @-@ eastern angle . And the whole of this wall , bears a broken line of thorns above , shews the mortar peeping here and there under the coat of turf , and near the south @-@ eastern corner has a large buttress of earth continued several yards along it . The southern side , like the Northern , is hundred and seventy five [ yards ] in length ; and the rampart sinking immediately from its elevation at the eastern end , successively declines , till , about fifty yards off , it is reduced to the inconsiderable height of less than one [ yard ] . And about seventeen yards further , there appears to have been a second gateway , the ground rising up to the crest of the bank of a four or five at the point ... 
 On the south side was particularly requisite ... in order to afford a passage to the river ; but about fifty three yards beyond the gates , the ground betwixt both falling away briskly to the west , the rampart , which continues in a right line along the ridge , necessarily rises till it has a sharp slope of twenty yards in length at the southwestern angle . And all this side of the wall , which was from the beginning probably not much higher than it is at present , as it was sufficiently secured by the river and its banks , before it appears crested at first with a hedge of thorns , a young oak rising from the ridge and rearing its head considerably over the rest , and runs afterwards in a smooth line near the level for several yards with the ground about it , and just perceptible to the eye , in a rounded eminence of turf 
 As to the south @-@ western point of the camp , the ground slopes away on the west towards the south , as well as on the south towards the West . On the third side still runs from it nearly as at first , having an even crest about seven feet in height , an even slope of turf for its whole extent , and the wall in all its original condition below . About a hundred yards beyond the angle was the Porta <unk> of the station , the ground visibly rising up the ascent of the bank in a large shelve of gravel , and running in a slight but perceivable ridge from it . And beyond a level of forty five yards , that still stretches on for the whole length of the side , it was bounded by the western boundary of the British city , the sharp slope of fifty to the morass below it . On the northern and remaining side are several chasms in the original course of the ramparts . And in one of them about a hundred and seventy five yards from its commencement , was another gateway , opening into the station directly from the road to Ribchester . The rest of the wall still rises above five and four feet in height , planted all the way with thorns above , and exhibiting a curious view of the rampart below . Various parts of it have been fleeced of their facing a turf and stone , and now show the inner structure of the whole , presenting to the eye the undressed stone of the quarry , the angular pieces of rock , and the round boulders of the river , all bedded in the mortar , and compacted into one . And the white and brown patches of mortar and stone on a general view of the wall stands strikingly contrasted with the green turf that entirely conceals the level line , and with the green moss that half reveals the projecting points of the rampart . The great <unk> of the British city , the Romans preserved along their northern side for more than thirty yards along the eastern end of it , and for the whole beyond the Western . And as the present appearances of the ground intimate , they closed the eastern point of it with a high bank , which was raised upon one part of the ditch and sloped away into the other . 
 Mamucium was levelled as Manchester expanded in the Industrial Revolution . The construction of the Rochdale Canal through the south western corner of the fort in the late 18th and early 19th centuries , and the building of viaducts for the Great Northern Railway over the site in the late 19th century , damaged the remains and even destroyed some of the southern half of the fort . When the railway viaducts were built , Charles Roeder documented the remains that were uncovered in the process , including parts of the vicus . 
 The first archaeological investigation of Mamucium was in 1906 . Francis Bruton , who would later work on the Roman fort at Castleshaw , excavated the fort 's western defences . A series of small @-@ scale excavations were undertaken intermittently between 1912 and 1967 , generally exploring the northern defences of the fort . In the mid @-@ 20th century , historian A. J. P. Taylor called the surviving stretch of Roman wall " the least interesting Roman remains in Britain " . The first excavation of the vicus was carried out in the 1970s under Professor Barri Jones . In 1982 the fort , along with the rest of the Castlefield area , became the United Kingdom 's first Urban Heritage Park , and partial reconstructions of the forts walls , including the ramparts and gateways , were opened in 1984 . In 2001 – 05 the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit carried out excavations in the vicus to further investigate the site before the area underwent any more regeneration or reconstruction . The archaeological investigation of Mamucium Roman fort and its associated civilian settlement has , so far , provided approximately 10 @,@ 000 artefacts .

 The fort measured 160 metres ( 175 yd ) by 130 metres ( 140 yd ) and was surrounded by a double ditch and wooden rampart . Around AD 200 the wooden rampart was replaced by stone ramparts , measuring between 2 @.@ 1 metres ( 7 ft ) and 2 @.@ 7 metres ( 9 ft ) thick . The vicus associated with Mamucium surrounded the site on the west , north , and east sides , with the majority lying to the north . The vicus covered about 26 hectares ( 64 acres ) and the fort about 2 hectares ( 4 @.@ 9 acres ) . Buildings within the vicus would have generally been one storey , timber framed , and of wattle and daub construction . There may have been a cemetery to the south east of the fort .

 The whiskery shark ( Furgaleus macki ) is a species of houndshark , belonging to the family Triakidae , and the only member of its genus . This common shark inhabits the Australian continental shelf from Western Australia to the Bass Strait , to a depth of 220 m ( 720 ft ) . It is demersal in habits and prefers rocky and vegetated habitats . Stout @-@ bodied and almost " humpbacked " in form , the whiskery shark can be distinguished from all other members of its family by the presence of long nasal barbels . Its two moderately large dorsal fins are roughly equal in size . It is brownish gray above and lighter below , with a pattern of darker saddles and blotches in younger sharks . This species reaches 1 @.@ 6 m ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) in length . 
 The diet of the whiskery shark consists almost entirely of octopuses . It is viviparous ; females bear litters of 4 – 28 pups every other year from August to October , after a gestation period of 7 – 9 months . This harmless shark is utilized for its meat , being one of the species marketed as " flake " in Australia . It is mainly caught by a Western Australian commercial gillnet fishery . Its numbers declined significantly from overfishing in the 1970s and early 1980s , leading to the introduction of new management measures in the mid @-@ 1980s . Since then , strict fishery management has kept the whiskery shark population stable or increasing , resulting in its listing under Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 Australian ichthyologist Gilbert Percy Whitley described the whiskery shark as a new genus and species , Fur macki , in a 1943 issue of the scientific journal Australian Zoologist . As the name Fur was already in use for the genus Fur of true flies , in 1951 Whitley replaced it with Furgaleus . The type specimen is a 50 cm ( 20 in ) long immature male caught off <unk> in Victoria , Australia . Other common names for the whiskery shark include Mack 's whiskery shark , reef shark , <unk> shark , and <unk> . Sharks from the western portion of this species ' range were once thought to be a separate species , F. ventralis , until comparative studies by Leonard Compagno found that they were not significantly different from F. macki . 
 Based on morphology , Leonard Compagno grouped Furgaleus with <unk> , Iago , and <unk> as the tribe <unk> within the subfamily <unk> of the family Triakidae . A 2006 phylogenetic study by J. Andrés López and colleagues , based on four protein @-@ coding gene sequences , affirmed that Furgaleus and <unk> are sister taxa ; the study was equivocal regarding the position of Iago and did not include <unk> . 
 = = Description = = 
 The whiskery shark has a moderately stout build , with an almost " humpbacked " appearance . The short snout is rounded or wedge @-@ shaped when viewed from above . This species is the only houndshark in which the flaps of skin preceding the nostrils are elongated into thin barbels . The horizontally oval eyes are placed high on the head and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes ( protective third eyelids ) . Beneath the eye is a prominent ridge , and behind it is a tiny spiracle . The mouth forms a short , wide arch , and bears somewhat long furrows at the corners . There are 24 – 32 upper and 36 – 42 lower tooth rows . Each upper tooth has an angled , knife @-@ like main cusp with smaller cusplets on the trailing side , while each lower tooth has a single upright cusp . There are five pairs of gill slits . 
 The first dorsal fin is rather large and positioned closer to the pectoral than the pelvic fins , though its origin lies posterior to the pectoral fin rear tips . The second dorsal fin roughly equals the first in size and is positioned slightly ahead of the anal fin , which is much smaller than either dorsal fin . The caudal fin has a short lower lobe and a deep ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe . Adults are brownish gray above and lighter below ; young sharks are lighter in color and have darker saddles and blotches over the body and fins , which fade and may disappear with age . This species grows up to 1 @.@ 6 m ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) long and 13 kg ( 29 lb ) in weight . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Endemic to Australia , the whiskery shark inhabits temperate continental shelf waters from the North West Cape in Western Australia to Wynyard in Tasmania . It is most common in the southwestern portion of its range between Kalbarri and Albany , and is rare off Victoria and Tasmania . Its range seems to encompass a single population . This species is found close to the bottom at depths of up to 220 m ( 720 ft ) . It favors rocky areas and kelp beds .
