 The gender @-@ swapped version of Marceline — named Marshall Lee — appeared in the third season episode " Fionna and Cake " . This version of the character only had a small cameo and no lines . It was later revealed that another Fionna and Cake episode was in the works for season five , and that the plot would largely revolve around Marshall Lee . The episode — titled " Bad Little Boy " — aired on February 18 , 2013 . In the episode , the princesses that are captured by the Ice King are tired of his poorly written Fionna and Cake fan fiction stories , so Marceline stops by the Ice Kingdom to show him how to properly do it ; she tells a tale involving her gender @-@ swapped character , Marshall Lee . The character was voiced by comedian and musician Donald Glover . 
 A six issue spin @-@ off comic miniseries titled Marceline and the Scream Queens , written by Meredith Gran of Octopus Pie , debuted in July 2012 . The series featured Marceline and Princess Bubblegum forming a band and touring around Ooo . The series is published by Boom ! Studios under its kid @-@ oriented imprint KaBoom , which also publishes the rest of the Adventure Time series . Other contributors to the series include Faith Erin Hicks , and Liz Prince . KaBoom has also published Seeing Red by Kate Leth , and Marceline Gone Adrift by Gran . 
 Marceline is also featured in the iOS game Adventure Time : Rock Bandits . In the context of the game , the Ice King kidnaps Marceline 's fans at a concert so that they will be his fans instead . Finn and Jake must then free the captured citizens . Marceline is set to appear as a playable character in the toys @-@ to @-@ life video game Lego Dimensions , distributed via a " fun pack " containing a Marceline Lego minifigure and a <unk> " Lunatic Amp " accessory .

 In the context of the series , Marceline is a half @-@ demon and half @-@ human vampire , and the eponymous Vampire Queen , after having killed the previous Vampire King . Although she is at least 1 @,@ 000 years old , she was designed to appear in the form of an 18- to 21 @-@ year @-@ old . In her first role , Marceline functions as the antagonist of the story , forcing Finn and Jake from their home . However , as the series progressed , she became a close friend to the two . Ward has stated that she is not a villain . Marceline 's wandering of the Land of Ooo has made her into a fearless daredevil . Her fondness for mischief and fun has turned her into a trickster . Although appearing hostile at first , Finn soon realizes that she is " a radical dame who likes to play games " . 
 Marceline does not need to drink blood to survive . Rather , she only needs to eat the color red out of objects . She can eat various shades of red , including " low @-@ grade " shades such as pink . Since she is only satiated by the color , blood is only appealing to her because it is red . However , Ward has noted that she " drinks blood sometimes " . When Marceline is deprived of red , she enters into a " feral " state , and will instinctively try to kill others and drink their blood . Like traditional Western vampires , she is vulnerable to sunlight and is capable of turning into a bat of varying size . Marceline also possesses several powers , such as levitation , invisibility , and the ability to shape @-@ shift into various paranormal creatures , and self @-@ healing ; she gained these powers after absorbing the essence of five powerful vampires , as documented in Stakes . Marceline is also a survivor of the Mushroom War . Hints of her past are sprinkled through the series ; in " Memory of a Memory " a trip into Marceline 's mind shows her as a child wandering around the outskirts of a destroyed city , and " I Remember You " features her meeting Simon Petrikov in a ruined city . 
 She was very emotionally attached to her teddy bear Hambo , which was given to her by a still @-@ human Simon Petrikov , as revealed in the episode " I Remember You " . In " Memory of a Memory " , after Ash sold the teddy bear to a witch , Marceline was furious and broke up with him . In the episode " Sky Witch " , Marceline enlists Princess Bubblegum 's help , and they retrieve the bear , but in " Betty " , she sacrifices the bear in order to allow Simon the chance to communicate with his fiancée . Although she is very independent , her detachment often makes her feel alone , as seen in " Marceline 's Closet " ; while Jake and Finn are hiding in her closet , she expresses most of her feeling via the writings of her 500 @-@ year @-@ old diary . Throughout the series , Marceline is seen playing music ; in several official sources , she is described as " a wild rocker girl " . Several times throughout the series , she jams with Finn and Jake , and various others depending on the circumstances . She is usually shown playing her axe bass , which was formerly her family 's heirloom battle axe . According to Ward , she is ambidextrous , which explains her ability to play bass with both hands . She often finds it easier to express her feelings through music , as seen with songs like the " Fry Song " , about her father , and " I 'm Just Your Problem " , about her relationship with Princess Bubblegum . 
 = = = Relationships = = = 
 Marceline has a close relationship with Finn and Jake . Marceline and Finn have many things in common with one another ; in the episodes " Evicted " and " Henchman " it is stated that the reason Marceline befriended Finn is because he simply enjoys being himself . Although she has kissed Finn platonically on the cheek twice , Ward has noted that there is no romantic subtext between the two . On the other hand , Marceline and Jake share a more complex relationship . In her initial appearances , she derived pleasure from scaring Jake , who was terrified " of her vampire bite " . Jake , in turn , felt that she was evil and had managed to take over Finn 's mind . Due to this , Jake attempted to kill her several times , to no avail . However , after the events of " Henchman " , Jake seems to have forgotten his fear of her ; in " Memory of a Memory " , he even refers to her as a " friend " in one of her memories . 
 Marceline shares a rocky relationship with Princess Bubblegum . Initially , in the series bible , the two were described as " friendly rivals " competing for Finn 's attention . However , as the show has gone on , their relationship has been fleshed out and changed . Marceline was the first person to address Bubblegum by her first name — <unk> — which occurred in the episode " Go With Me " . Their connections are explored further in the season three episode " What Was Missing " . In the episode , Marceline 's song " I 'm Just Your Problem " and the dialogue between her and Bubblegum implied that there may have had some sort of relationship in the past , although the exact details surrounding the nature of the relationship were not explained . This later caused an internet controversy over Marceline 's sexual orientation . However , after the events of " What Was Missing " , Marceline and Bubblegum 's relationship seems to have gotten better , as the two spend quality time together in " Sky Witch " and " Stakes " . 
 Marceline and her father , Hunson Abadeer , have trouble accepting one another . Initially , Marceline feels that her father does not care for her , and expresses her feelings through the before @-@ mentioned " Fry Song " . Although they admit to loving each other , Abadeer constantly pressures Marceline to follow in the family business and take over ruling the Nightosphere , a prospective job Marceline does not want . Marceline and the Ice King also have a complicated relationship . In the episode " I Remember You " , it is revealed that the Ice King — then , the human man named Simon Petrikov — discovered her crying in the ruins of a city destroyed by the Mushroom Wars . It was Simon who gave little Marceline Hambo and attempted to watch over her . This kind gesture made the Ice King a long @-@ time close friend to Marceline . However , as the crown 's power increased , Simon began to forget more and more about his relationship with Marceline , until he had all but forgotten their friendship . Former storyboard artist and current supervising director for the series Adam Muto explained that Marceline and the Ice King 's history was not part of the series ' initial plan , but something that " evolved from [ the show 's ] original course and it will likely continue to evolve in the future . "

 Marceline has attracted positive critical attention . Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club praised that the fact that she is one " of this show ’ s most tragic characters " . He later wrote that her addition " was a major turning point for the series , introducing a hip , adventure @-@ loving female to the cast who can hold her own against Finn and Jake and also has a strong connection to Ooo ’ s past . " Furthermore , he noted that " she ’ s been at the center of some of the show ’ s most emotional episodes " , and " beyond her dramatic value , Marceline tends to just make every episode better " because " her writers clearly enjoy writing scenes for her " . Susana Polo of The Mary Sue referred to the character as " one of the radder characters " in the series . Cam Shea of IGN named Marceline 's introduction in " Evicted ! " as the fourth best moment in the series ' first season . He wrote that " sure , in this episode she evicts Finn and Jake from their home ... but hey , this is the first time we meet her and she 's awesome . " He later wrote that " Marceline = best " . io9 writer Charlies Jane Anders wrote that Marceline 's — as well as the Ice King 's — appearance in " I Remember You " was " one of the most intense things I 've seen in ages . " She praised Marceline 's development from a " pretty one @-@ note villain " to a type of person that " we sort of knew " . <unk> named her " Character of the Week " on January 24 , 2012 . The Guardian called Marceline the best character in Adventure Time in a DVD review of the series , noting in particular that " she 's … responsible for some of the show 's best songs . " 
 The production crew of Adventure Time are also pleased with the character . Ward has stated several times that Marceline is his favorite character because he does not " know everything about her character yet " , which he finds " mysterious [ and ] cool " . Rynda claimed that Marceline was probably his favorite character in the series because " she 's just really fun to draw . " Marceline is also particularly popular with the Adventure Time fan base , and after the release of " Evicted ! " her popularity grew enormously . Ward later noted that he felt " good about that . It 's nice " . The character 's popularity has been recognized by the company that owns Adventure Time . In fact , the official press release for the Adventure Time : Marceline and the Scream Queens companion comic book referred to the character as a " fan @-@ favorite " . 
 Marceline 's popularity has transcended into other mediums of popular culture ; American singer Willow dedicated two tracks of her debut album <unk> to the character , which were eponymously named after her . 
 = = = Relationship controversy = = = 
 The episode " What Was Missing " became controversial because of an allegedly implied past relationship between Marceline and Princess Bubblegum . The controversy largely began after an accompanying " Mathematical " recap — a studio @-@ endorsed behind the scenes video series implied that there were lesbian relations between Princess Bubblegum and Marceline and that the writing staff actively seeks input from fans . This incident was addressed by the show 's producer , Fred Seibert , who said that " in trying to get the show ’ s audience involved we got wrapped up by both fan conjecture and spicy fanart and went a little too far . " Soon after , the video recap and the entire channel was pulled off of YouTube , although " What Was Missing " still airs during reruns . Seibert 's decision to remove the video also proved controversial ; Bitch magazine later wrote an article about how the episode " handled female desire — female queer desire at that — in a subtle but complex way " , but that the removal of the recap and the studio 's perceived treatment of the controversy was detrimental towards the acceptance of queer romance in children 's television . Ward later addressed the issue and gave a more neutral view ; he said that , because there were " so many extreme positions taken on it all over the Internet " , he did not " really want to comment on it [ because ] it was a big hullaballoo . " 
 In August 2014 , Olson told a crowd of fans gathered at a Barnes & Noble book signing from The Adventure Time Encyclopedia , that , according to Ward , Marceline and Princess Bubblegum had dated in the past , but that because the series airs in some areas where homosexual relationships are illegal , the show has not been able to officially make clear the relationship in the series itself . 
 = Volvariella bombycina = 
 Volvariella bombycina , commonly known as the silky sheath , silky rosegill , silver @-@ silk straw mushroom , or tree mushroom , is a species of edible mushroom in the family Pluteaceae . It is an uncommon but widespread species , having been reported from Asia , Australia , the Caribbean , Europe , and North America . The fruit body ( mushroom ) begins developing in a thin , egg @-@ like sac . This ruptures and the stem expands quickly , leaving the sac at the base of the stem as a volva . The cap , which can attain a diameter of up to 20 cm ( 8 in ) , is white to slightly yellowish and covered with silky hairs . On the underside of the cap are closely spaced gills , free from attachment to the stem , and initially white before turning pink as the spores mature . The mushroom grows singly or in clusters , often appearing in old knotholes and wounds in elms and maples . V. bombycina contains compounds with antibacterial properties . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first described in 1774 by German naturalist Jacob Christian Schäffer as Agaricus bombycinus . Throughout its taxonomical history , it has been shuffled to several genera , including Pluteus ( by Elias Fries in 1836 ) , Volvaria ( Paul Kummer , 1871 ) , and Volvariopsis ( William Alphonso Murrill , 1911 ) . Rolf Singer placed it in its current genus , Volvariella , in 1951 . Other names that have been applied to the species include Jean @-@ Baptiste Lamarck 's Amanita <unk> and August Johann Georg Karl Batsch 's Agaricus <unk> ( both published in 1783 ) , but these are illegitimate names as Schäffer 's earlier 1774 name has priority . 
 In 1949 , Murrill described the variety flaviceps from collections made growing on magnolia wood in Gainesville , Florida . Although he originally described it as a new species , Volvaria flaviceps , Robert Shaffer considered it a variety of V. bombycina . Variety microspora was first described in 1953 , was later ( 1961 ) named by R.W.G. Dennis ; variety palmicola was originally described as a distinct species Volvaria palmicola by Belgian mycologist Maurice <unk> in 1928 , and later as a variety of V. bombycina by the same author in 1937 . 
 The root for the generic name Volvariella ( as well as Volvaria and Volvariopsis , genera in which the species had been formerly placed ) derives from the Latin volva , meaning " wrapper " or " a covering " . The specific epithet bombycina derives from the Latin root <unk> , or " silky " . Common names for the mushroom include the " silky sheath " , the " silky rosegill " , the " silver @-@ silk straw mushroom " , or the " tree mushroom " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit bodies of Volvariella bombycina are initially egg @-@ shaped when still enclosed in the universal veil . As they expand , the caps later becoming bell @-@ shaped or convex , and finally nearly flattened in age , attaining a diameter of 5 – 20 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 – 7 @.@ 9 in ) . The dry cap surface is covered with silky threads . Its color is white to yellowish , becoming more pale approaching the margin . The flesh is thin , soft , and white , and has an odor , resembling raw potatoes . Gills are crowded close together , free from attachment to the stem , and initially white before turning pinkish as the spores mature . The stem measures 6 – 20 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 – 7 @.@ 9 in ) long by 1 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick , and is typically tapered upward or thickened below . It is white , with a smooth surface , and is often slightly curved . The universal veil is membranous , often areolate ( cracked into irregularly shaped blocks ) or scaly , and forms a long , saclike volva that wraps around the base of the stem . It is white to yellowish or dingy brown , and often divided into lobes . 
 The variety V. bombycina var. flaviceps is distinguished from the main form by its smaller , bright yellow caps , up to 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) in diameter , and its dirty @-@ white , scaly volva . Murrill also noted that it developed a " peculiar sickening odor during drying " . V. bombycina var. microspora has smaller spores ( 6 – 7 @.@ 5 by 4 – 5 μm ) , a yellow cap , and a blotched brown volva . V. bombycina var. palmicola also has a yellow cap and small spores ( 5 @.@ 9 – 7 @.@ 5 by 4 @.@ 3 – 5 @.@ 4 μm ) , but can be distinguished from the previous varieties by its distantly spaced gills . 
 Mushrooms produce a spore print with a color ranging from pinkish to salmon . Spores are elliptical , smooth , and measure 6 @.@ 5 – 10 by 4 @.@ 5 – 6 @.@ 5 μm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are club @-@ shaped , four @-@ spored , and measure 19 – 43 by 6 – 11 μm . Pleurocystidia ( cystidia that occur on the gill face ) are usually spindle shaped , but have a widely variable morphology ; they are abundant in the hymenium , and have dimensions of 26 – 122 by 8 – 57 μm . The cheilocystidia ( on the gill edge ) are similar in morphology and abundance , some may feature knobs held at the end of slender projections up to 20 μm long ; dimensions are in the range of 26 and 144 μm long by 8 – 46 μm wide . Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae of V. bombycina . 
 The fruit bodies can be readily grown in laboratory culture . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 The combination of a silky white cap , white stem , pink gills , pink spore print , and growth on wood is characteristic of this species and make identification of Volvariella bombycina in the field relatively easy . Some Pluteus species have a general similar appearance , and also produce pinkish to pinkish @-@ brown spore prints , but they lack a volva . Amanita species grow on the ground and make white spore prints . V. pusilla has a small cap measuring 0 @.@ 5 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 2 in ) in diameter with silky fibers and short lines visible at the cap edge when moist ; it grows in soil in gardens and greenhouses and on lawns . V. hypopithys has a medium @-@ size white cap that is 2 – 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 2 @.@ 0 in ) in diameter with silky to scaly fibers and lacks the short lines at the cap edge when moist ; it grows on the ground in woods . V. <unk> has a bluish @-@ gray cap , while V. gloiocephala can be distinguished from V. bombycina by its smooth cap that is sticky when damp , and a white volva . 
 = = = Edibility = = = 
 The fruit bodies are edible , and usually considered of good quality . They have been called " excellent " , " tasty " with a " modest and pleasant flavor " , and " worth eating if found in large enough quantities " . 
 Alexander H. Smith related a story of how unique circumstances led to the development of a local superstition about the species : 
 ... the members of a family here in Ann Arbor were poisoned , some fatally , as the result of eating caps of a species of Amanita . The next year Volvaria bombycina fruited on a maple tree at the home of these people , and the story was circulated that some of the spores of the poisonous fungus , which caused the deaths the year before , had escaped from the house , lodged in the tree , germinated , grew and were now producing fruiting bodies . Consequently the <unk> of the Volvaria were held in great awe by the neighbors , and soon came to be referred to as the " ghost mushroom " . No one , of course , would consider eating them . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Volvariella bombycina is a saprobic species . Fruit bodies grow singly or in small groups on trunks and decayed stumps of dead hardwoods . Favored species include sugar maple , red maple , silver maple , magnolia , mango , beech , oak , and elm . It is often found in clefts and knotholes of dead or living tree trunks . It has been noted to fruit in the same location for several years . Despite its preference for hardwoods , it has been reported growing on rare instances on coniferous wood . An uncommon species with a wide distribution , it has been reported from Asia ( China , India , Korea , Pakistan ) , the Caribbean ( Cuba ) , Australia , Europe , North America , and South America . It acquired protected status in Hungary in 2005 , making it a legal offense to pick it . Variety microspora is known from Venezuela , while V. bombycina var. palmicola occurs in the DR Congo .

 Al @-@ Aqsa Mosque ( Arabic : المسجد <unk> Al @-@ Masjid al @-@ Aqsa , IPA : [ <unk> <unk> ] , “ the Farthest Mosque " , Hebrew : <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> al @-@ <unk> ) , also known as Al @-@ Aqsa and Bayt al @-@ <unk> , is the third holiest site in Islam and is located in the Old City of Jerusalem . Whilst the entire site on which the silver @-@ domed mosque sits , along with the Dome of the Rock , seventeen gates , and four minarets , was itself historically known as the Al @-@ Aqsa Mosque , today a narrower definition prevails , and the wider compound is usually referred to as al @-@ Haram ash @-@ Sharif ( " the Noble Sanctuary " ) , or the Temple Mount , the holiest site in Judaism . Muslims believe that Muhammad was transported from the Sacred Mosque in Mecca to al @-@ Aqsa during the Night Journey . Islamic tradition holds that Muhammad led prayers towards this site until the seventeenth month after the emigration , when God directed him to turn towards the Kaaba . 
 The mosque was originally a small prayer house built by the Rashidun caliph Umar , but was rebuilt and expanded by the Umayyad caliph Abd al @-@ Malik and finished by his son al @-@ Walid in 705 CE . The mosque was completely destroyed by an earthquake in 746 and rebuilt by the Abbasid caliph al @-@ Mansur in 754 . His successor al @-@ Mahdi rebuilt it again in 780 . Another earthquake destroyed most of al @-@ Aqsa in 1033 , but two years later the Fatimid caliph Ali az @-@ Zahir built another mosque which has stood to the present day . 
 During the periodic renovations undertaken , the various ruling dynasties of the Islamic Caliphate constructed additions to the mosque and its precincts , such as its dome , facade , its minbar , minarets and the interior structure . When the Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099 , they used the mosque as a palace and the Dome of the Rock as a church , but its function as a mosque was restored after its recapture by Saladin in 1187 . More renovations , repairs and additions were undertaken in the later centuries by the Ayyubids , Mamluks , Ottomans , the Supreme Muslim Council , and Jordan . Today , the Old City is under Israeli control , but the mosque remains under the administration of the Jordanian / Palestinian @-@ led Islamic Waqf . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Masjid al @-@ Aqsa translates from Arabic into English as " the farthest mosque " . The name refers to a chapter of the Quran called " The Night Journey " in which it is said that Muhammad traveled from Mecca to " the farthest mosque " , and then up to Heaven on a heavenly creature called al @-@ Buraq al @-@ Sharif . Al @-@ Aqsa Mosque as a whole is confused with a particular building within it , also known as al @-@ Jami ' al @-@ Aqsa or al @-@ <unk> or Masjid al @-@ <unk> or al @-@ <unk> ; these names refer to the southern building with the silver lead dome . 
 For centuries , al @-@ Masjid al @-@ Aqsa referred not only to the mosque , but to the entire sacred sanctuary , while al @-@ Jami ' al @-@ Aqsa referred to the specific site of the mosque . This changed during the period of Ottoman rule ( c. early 16th century to 1917 ) when the sanctuary complex came to be known as al @-@ Haram al @-@ Sharif .

 = = = Pre @-@ construction = = = 
 The al @-@ Aqsa Mosque is located on the Temple Mount , referred to by Muslims today as the " Haram al @-@ Sharif " ( " The Noble Sanctuary " ) , an enclosure expanded by King Herod the Great beginning in 20 BCE . The mosque resides on an artificial platform that is supported by arches constructed by Herod 's engineers to overcome the difficult topographic conditions resulting from the southward expansion of the enclosure into the Tyropoeon and Kidron valleys . At the time of the Second Temple , the present site of the mosque was occupied by the Royal Stoa , a basilica running the southern wall of the enclosure . The Royal Stoa was destroyed along with the Temple during the sacking of Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 CE . 
 It was once thought that Emperor Justinian 's " Nea Ekklesia of the Theotokos " , or the New Church of the God @-@ Bearer , dedicated to the God @-@ bearing Virgin Mary , consecrated in 543 and commonly known as the Nea Church , was situated where al @-@ Aqsa Mosque was later constructed . However , remains identified as those of the Nea Church were uncovered in the south part of the Jewish Quarter in 1973 . 
 Analysis of the wooden beams and panels removed from the mosque during renovations in the 1930s shows they are made from Cedar of Lebanon and cypress . Radiocarbon dating indicates a large range of ages , some as old as 9th @-@ century BCE , showing that some of the wood had previously been used in older buildings . 
 In 2012 , it was reported that Robert Hamilton , an archaeologist who worked on the Temple Mount after the 1927 Jericho earthquake , had discovered remains under al @-@ Aqsa mosque that he did not publish in his book on the excavations . These included a mosaic like those used in Byzantine churches , and a Jewish mikveh from the Second Temple period .

 The current construction of the al @-@ Aqsa Mosque is dated to the early Umayyad period of rule in Palestine . Architectural historian K. A. C. Creswell , referring to a testimony by Arculf , a Gallic monk , during his pilgrimage to Palestine in 679 – 82 , notes the possibility that the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate , Umar ibn al @-@ Khattab , erected a primitive quadrangular building for a capacity of 3 @,@ 000 worshipers somewhere on the Haram ash @-@ Sharif . However , Arculf visited Palestine during the reign of Mu 'awiyah I , and it is possible that Mu 'awiyah ordered the construction , not Umar . This latter claim is explicitly supported by the early Muslim scholar al @-@ <unk> bin Tahir . 
 According to several Muslim scholars , including Mujir ad @-@ Din , al @-@ Suyuti , and al @-@ Muqaddasi , the mosque was reconstructed and expanded by the caliph Abd al @-@ Malik in 690 along with the Dome of the Rock . Guy le Strange claims that Abd al @-@ Malik used materials from the destroyed Church of Our Lady to build the mosque and points to possible evidence that substructures on the southeast corners of the mosque are remains of the church . In planning his magnificent project on the Temple Mount , which in effect would turn the entire complex into the Haram al @-@ Sharif ( " the Noble Sanctuary " ) , Abd al @-@ Malik wanted to replace the slipshod structure described by Arculf with a more sheltered structure enclosing the qibla , a necessary element in his grand scheme . However , the entire Haram al @-@ Sharif was meant to represent a mosque . How much he modified the aspect of the earlier building is unknown , but the length of the new building is indicated by the existence of traces of a bridge leading from the Umayyad palace just south of the western part of the complex . The bridge would have spanned the street running just outside the southern wall of the Haram al @-@ Sharif to give direct access to the mosque . Direct access from palace to mosque was a well @-@ known feature in the Umayyad period , as evidenced at various early sites . Abd al @-@ Malik shifted the central axis of the mosque some 40 meters ( 130 ft ) westward , in accord with his overall plan for the Haram al @-@ Sharif . The earlier axis is represented in the structure by the niche still known as the " mihrab of ' Umar . " In placing emphasis on the Dome of the Rock , Abd al @-@ Malik had his architects align his new al @-@ Aqsa Mosque according to the position of the Rock , thus shifting the main north – south axis of the Noble Sanctuary , a line running through the Dome of the Chain and the Mihrab of Umar . 
 In contrast , Creswell , while referring to the <unk> Papyri , claims that Abd al @-@ Malik 's son , al @-@ Walid I , reconstructed the Aqsa Mosque over a period of six months to a year , using workers from Damascus . Most scholars agree that the mosque 's reconstruction was started by Abd al @-@ Malik , but that al @-@ Walid oversaw its completion . In 713 – 14 , a series of earthquakes ravaged Jerusalem , destroying the eastern section of the mosque , which was subsequently rebuilt during al @-@ Walid 's rule . In order to finance its reconstruction , al @-@ Walid had gold from the dome of the Rock minted to use as money to purchase the material . The Umayyad @-@ built al @-@ Aqsa Mosque most likely measured 112 x 39 meters . 
 = = = Earthquakes and reconstructions = = = 
 In 746 , the al @-@ Aqsa Mosque was damaged in an earthquake , four years before as @-@ Saffah overthrew the Umayyads and established the Abbasid Caliphate . The second Abbasid caliph Abu Ja 'far al @-@ Mansur declared his intent to repair the mosque in 753 , and he had the gold and silver plaques that covered the gates of the mosque removed and turned into dinars and dirhams to finance the reconstruction which ended in 771 . A second earthquake damaged most of al @-@ Mansur 's repairs , excluding those made in the southern portion in 774 . In 780 , the successor caliph Muhammad al @-@ Mahdi had it rebuilt , but curtailed its length and increased its breadth . Al @-@ Mahdi 's renovation is the first known to have written records describing it . In 985 , Jerusalem @-@ born Arab geographer al @-@ Muqaddasi recorded that the renovated mosque had " fifteen naves and fifteen gates " . 
 In 1033 , there was another earthquake , severely damaging the mosque . The Fatimid caliph Ali az @-@ Zahir rebuilt and completely renovated the mosque between 1034 and 1036 . The number of naves was drastically reduced from fifteen to seven . Az @-@ Zahir built the four arcades of the central hall and aisle , which presently serve as the foundation of the mosque . The central aisle was double the width of the other aisles and had a large gable roof upon which the dome — made of wood — was constructed . Persian geographer , Nasir Khusraw describes the Aqsa Mosque during a visit in 1047 : 
 The Haram Area ( Noble Sanctuary ) lies in the eastern part of the city ; and through the bazaar of this ( quarter ) you enter the Area by a great and beautiful gateway ( Dargah ) ... After passing this gateway , you have on the right two great colonnades ( <unk> ) , each of which has nine @-@ and @-@ twenty marble pillars , whose capitals and bases are of colored marbles , and the joints are set in lead . Above the pillars rise arches , that are constructed , of masonry , without mortar or cement , and each arch is constructed of no more than five or six blocks of stone . These colonnades lead down to near the <unk> . 
 Jerusalem was captured by the Crusaders in 1099 , during the First Crusade . They named the mosque " Solomon 's Temple " , distinguishing it from the Dome of the Rock , which they named Templum Domini ( Temple of God ) . While the Dome of the Rock was turned into a Christian church under the care of the Augustinians , the al @-@ Aqsa Mosque was used as a royal palace and also as a stable for horses . In 1119 , it was transformed into the headquarters of the Templar Knights . During this period , the mosque underwent some structural changes , including the expansion of its northern porch , and the addition of an apse and a dividing wall . A new cloister and church were also built at the site , along with various other structures . The Templars constructed vaulted western and eastern annexes to the building ; the western currently serves as the women 's mosque and the eastern as the Islamic Museum . 
 After the Ayyubids under the leadership of Saladin reconquered Jerusalem following the siege of 1187 , several repairs and renovations were undertaken at al @-@ Aqsa Mosque . In order to prepare the mosque for Friday prayers , within a week of his capture of Jerusalem Saladin had the toilets and grain stores installed by the Crusaders at al @-@ Aqsa removed , the floors covered with precious carpets , and its interior scented with rosewater and incense . Saladin 's predecessor — the Zengid sultan Nur al @-@ Din — had commissioned the construction of a new minbar or " pulpit " made of ivory and wood in 1168 – 69 , but it was completed after his death ; Nur ad @-@ Din 's minbar was added to the mosque in November 1187 by Saladin . The Ayyubid sultan of Damascus , al @-@ Mu 'azzam , built the northern porch of the mosque with three gates in 1218 . In 1345 , the Mamluks under al @-@ Kamil Shaban added two naves and two gates to the mosque 's eastern side . 
 After the Ottomans assumed power in 1517 , they did not undertake any major renovations or repairs to the mosque itself , but they did to the Noble Sanctuary as a whole . This included the building of the Fountain of Qasim Pasha ( 1527 ) , the restoration of the Pool of <unk> , and the building of three free @-@ standing domes — the most notable being the Dome of the Prophet built in 1538 . All construction was ordered by the Ottoman governors of Jerusalem and not the sultans themselves . The sultans did make additions to existing minarets , however . In 1816 , the mosque was restored by Governor Sulayman Pasha al @-@ Adil after having been in a dilapidated state .

 The first renovation in the 20th @-@ century occurred in 1922 , when the Supreme Muslim Council under Amin al @-@ Husayni ( the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem ) commissioned Turkish architect Ahmet <unk> Bey to restore al @-@ Aqsa Mosque and the monuments in its precincts . The council also commissioned British architects , Egyptian engineering experts and local officials to contribute to and oversee the repairs and additions which were carried out in 1924 – 25 by <unk> . The renovations included reinforcing the mosque 's ancient Umayyad foundations , rectifying the interior columns , replacing the beams , erecting a scaffolding , conserving the arches and drum of the main dome 's interior , rebuilding the southern wall , and replacing timber in the central nave with a slab of concrete . The renovations also revealed Fatimid @-@ era mosaics and inscriptions on the interior arches that had been covered with plasterwork . The arches were decorated with gold and green @-@ tinted gypsum and their timber tie beams were replaced with brass . A quarter of the stained glass windows also were carefully renewed so as to preserve their original Abbasid and Fatimid designs . Severe damage was caused by the 1927 and 1937 earthquakes , but the mosque was repaired in 1938 and 1942 . 
 On 21 August 1969 , a fire was started by a visitor from Australia named Denis Michael Rohan . Rohan was a member of an evangelical Christian sect known as the Worldwide Church of God . He hoped that by burning down al @-@ Aqsa Mosque he would hasten the Second Coming of Jesus , making way for the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple on the Temple Mount . Rohan was subsequently hospitalized in a mental institution . In response to the incident , a summit of Islamic countries was held in Rabat that same year , hosted by Faisal of Saudi Arabia , the late king of Saudi Arabia . The al @-@ Aqsa fire is regarded as one of the catalysts for the formation of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC , now the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation ) in 1972 . 
 In the 1980s , Ben <unk> and Yehuda Etzion , both members of the Gush <unk> Underground , plotted to blow up the al @-@ Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock . Etzion believed that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel , and would solve all the problems of the Jewish people . They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque . On 15 January , 1988 , during the First Intifada , Israeli troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters outside the mosque , wounding 40 worshipers . On 8 October , 1990 , 22 Palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by Israeli Border Police during protests that were triggered by the announcement of the Temple Mount Faithful , a group of religious Jews , that they were going to lay the cornerstone of the Third Temple . 
 On 28 September 2000 , then @-@ opposition leader of Israel Ariel Sharon and members of the Likud Party , along with 1 @,@ 000 armed guards , visited the al @-@ Aqsa compound ; a large group of Palestinians went to protest the visit . After Sharon and the Likud Party members left , a demonstration erupted and Palestinians on the grounds of the Haram al @-@ Sharif began throwing stones and other projectiles at Israeli riot police . Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the crowd , injuring 24 people . The visit sparked a five @-@ year uprising by the Palestinians , commonly referred to as the al @-@ Aqsa Intifada , though some commentators , citing subsequent speeches by PA officials , particularly Imad <unk> and Arafat himself , claim that the Intifada had been planned months in advance , as early as July upon Yasser Arafat 's return from Camp David talks . On 29 September , the Israeli government deployed 2 @,@ 000 riot police to the mosque . When a group of Palestinians left the mosque after Friday prayers ( Jumu 'ah , ) they hurled stones at the police . The police then stormed the mosque compound , firing both live ammunition and rubber bullets at the group of Palestinians , killing four and wounding about 200 . 
 On 5 November 2014 , Israeli police entered Al @-@ Aqsa for the first time since capturing Jerusalem in 1967 , said Sheikh Azzam Al @-@ Khatib , director of the Islamic Waqf . Previous media reports of ' storming Al @-@ Aqsa ' referred to the Haram al @-@ Sharif compound rather than the Al @-@ Aqsa mosque itself .

 The rectangular al @-@ Aqsa Mosque and its precincts are 144 @,@ 000 square meters ( 1 @,@ 550 @,@ 000 sq ft ) , although the mosque itself is about 35 @,@ 000 square meters ( 380 @,@ 000 sq ft ) and could hold up to 5 @,@ 000 worshipers . It is 83 m ( 272 ft ) long , 56 m ( 184 ft ) wide . Unlike the Dome of the Rock , which reflects classical Byzantine architecture , the Al @-@ Aqsa Mosque is characteristic of early Islamic architecture . 
 = = = Dome = = = 
 Nothing remains of the original dome built by Abd al @-@ Malik . The present @-@ day dome was built by az @-@ Zahir and consists of wood plated with lead <unk> . In 1969 , the dome was reconstructed in concrete and covered with anodized aluminum , instead of the original ribbed lead enamel work sheeting . In 1983 , the aluminum outer covering was replaced with lead to match the original design by az @-@ Zahir . 
 Al @-@ Aqsa 's dome is one of the few domes to be built in front of the mihrab during the Umayyad and Abbasid periods , the others being the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus ( 715 ) and the Great Mosque at Sousse ( 850 ) . The interior of the dome is painted with 14th @-@ century @-@ era decorations . During the 1969 burning , the paintings were assumed to be irreparably lost , but were completely reconstructed using the <unk> technique , a method that uses fine vertical lines to distinguish reconstructed areas from original ones . 
 = = = Facade and porch = = = 
 The facade of the mosque was built in 1065 CE on the instructions of the Fatimid caliph al @-@ Mustansir Billah . It was crowned with a balustrade consisting of arcades and small columns . The Crusaders damaged the facade , but it was restored and renovated by the Ayyubids . One addition was the covering of the facade with tiles . The second @-@ hand material of the facade 's arches includes sculpted , ornamental material taken from Crusader structures in Jerusalem . The facade consists of fourteen stone arches , most of which are of a Romanesque style . The outer arches added by the Mamluks follow the same general design . The entrance to the mosque is through the facade 's central arch . 
 The porch is located at the top of the facade . The central bays of the porch were built by the Knights Templar during the First Crusade , but Saladin 's nephew al @-@ Mu 'azzam Isa ordered the construction of the porch itself in 1217 . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The al @-@ Aqsa Mosque has seven aisles of hypostyle naves with several additional small halls to the west and east of the southern section of the building . There are 121 stained glass windows in the mosque from the Abbasid and Fatimid eras . About a fourth of them were restored in 1924 . 
 The mosque 's interior is supported by 45 columns , 33 of which are white marble and 12 of stone . The column rows of the central aisles are heavy and stunted . The remaining four rows are better proportioned . The capitals of the columns are of four different kinds : those in the central aisle are heavy and primitively designed , while those under the dome are of the Corinthian order , and made from Italian white marble . The capitals in the eastern aisle are of a heavy basket @-@ shaped design and those east and west of the dome are also basket @-@ shaped , but smaller and better proportioned . The columns and piers are connected by an architectural rave , which consists of beams of roughly squared timber enclosed in a wooden casing . 
 A great portion of the mosque is covered with whitewash , but the drum of the dome and the walls immediately beneath it are decorated with mosaics and marble . Some paintings by an Italian artist were introduced when repairs were undertaken at the mosque after an earthquake ravaged the mosque in 1927 . The ceiling of the mosque was painted with funding by King Farouk of Egypt . 
 The minbar ( " pulpit " ) of the mosque was built by a craftsman named <unk> from Aleppo on the orders of the Zengid sultan Nur ad @-@ Din . It was intended to be a gift for the mosque when Nur ad @-@ Din would capture Jerusalem from the Crusaders and took six years to build ( 1168 – 74 ) . Nur ad @-@ Din died and the Crusaders still controlled Jerusalem , but in 1187 , Saladin captured the city and the minbar was installed . The structure was made of ivory and carefully crafted wood . Arabic calligraphy , geometrical and floral designs were inscribed in the woodwork . After its destruction by Rohan in 1969 , it was replaced by a much simpler minbar . In January 2007 , Adnan al @-@ Husayni — head of the Islamic waqf in charge of al @-@ Aqsa — stated that a new minbar would be installed ; it was installed in February 2007 . The design of the new minbar was drawn by Jamil Badran based on an exact replica of the Saladin <unk> and was finished by Badran within a period of five years . The minbar itself was built in Jordan over a period of four years and the craftsmen used " ancient woodworking methods , joining the pieces with pegs instead of nails , but employed computer images to design the pulpit [ minbar ] .

 = = = <unk> fountain = = = 
 The mosque 's main ablution fountain , known as al @-@ Kas ( " the Cup " ) , is located north of the mosque between it and the Dome of the Rock . It is used by worshipers to perform wudu , a ritual washing of the hands , arms , legs , feet , and face before entry into the mosque . It was first built in 709 by the Umayyads , but in 1327 – 28 Governor <unk> enlarged it to accommodate more worshipers . Although originally supplied with water from Solomon 's Pools near Bethlehem , it currently receives water from pipes connected to Jerusalem 's water supply . In the 20th @-@ century , al @-@ Kas was provided taps and stone seating . 
 The Fountain of Qasim Pasha , built by the Ottomans in 1526 and located north of the mosque on the platform of the Dome of the Rock , was used by worshipers for ablution and for drinking until the 1940s . Today , it stands as a monumental structure . 
 = = Religious significance in Islam = = 
 In Islam , the term " al @-@ Aqsa Mosque " refers to the entire Noble Sanctuary . The mosque is believed to be the second house of prayer constructed after the Masjid al @-@ Haram in Mecca . Post @-@ Rashidun @-@ era Islamic scholars traditionally identified the mosque as the site referred to in the sura ( Quranic chapter ) al @-@ Isra ( " the Night Journey " ) . This specific verse in the Quran cemented the significant religious importance of al @-@ Aqsa in Islam . The specific passage reads " Praise be to Him who made His servant journey in the night from the sacred sanctuary to the remotest sanctuary . " Muslims traditionally identify the " sacred sanctuary " as the Masjid al @-@ Haram and the " remotest sanctuary " as the al @-@ Aqsa Mosque , even though initially , Rashidun and Umayyad @-@ era scholars were in disagreement about the location of the " remotest sanctuary " with some arguing it was actually located near Mecca . Eventually scholarly consensus determined that its location was indeed in Jerusalem .

 According to the Quran and Islamic traditions , al @-@ Aqsa Mosque is the place from which Muhammad went on a night journey ( al @-@ <unk> ) during which he rode on Buraq , who took him from Mecca to al @-@ Aqsa . Muhammad tethered Buraq to the Western Wall and prayed at al @-@ Aqsa Mosque and after he finished his prayers , the angel Jibril ( Gabriel ) traveled with him to heaven , where he met several other prophets and led them in prayer . 
 = = = First qibla = = = 
 The historical significance of the al @-@ Aqsa Mosque in Islam is further emphasized by the fact that Muslims turned towards al @-@ Aqsa when they prayed for a period of sixteen or seventeen months after migration to Medina in 624 ; it thus became the qibla ( " direction " ) that Muslims faced for prayer . Muhammad later prayed towards the Kaaba in Mecca after receiving a revelation during a prayer session [ Quran 2 : 142 – 151 ] in the Masjid al @-@ Qiblatayn . The qibla was relocated to the Kaaba where Muslims have been directed to pray ever since . 
 The altering of the qibla was precisely the reason the Rashidun caliph Umar , despite identifying the mosque which Muhammad used to ascend to Heaven upon his arrival at the Noble Sanctuary in 638 , neither prayed facing it nor built any structure upon it . This was because the significance of that particular spot on the Noble Sanctuary was superseded in Islamic jurisprudence by the Kaaba in Mecca after the change of the qibla towards that site . 
 According to early Quranic interpreters and what is generally accepted as Islamic tradition , in 638 CE Umar , upon entering a conquered Jerusalem , consulted with Ka 'ab al @-@ <unk> — a Jewish convert to Islam who came with him from Medina — as to where the best spot would be to build a mosque . Al @-@ <unk> suggested to him that it should be behind the Rock " ... so that all of Jerusalem would be before you . " Umar replied , " You correspond to Judaism ! " Immediately after this conversation , Umar began to clean up the site — which was filled with trash and debris — with his cloak , and other Muslim followers imitated him until the site was clean . Umar then prayed at the spot where it was believed that Muhammad had prayed before his night journey , reciting the Quranic sura Sad . Thus , according to this tradition , Umar thereby reconsecrated the site as a mosque . 
 Because of the holiness of Noble Sanctuary itself — being a place where David and Solomon had prayed — Umar constructed a small prayer house in the southern corner of its platform , taking care to avoid allowing the Rock to come between the mosque and the direction of Kaaba so that Muslims would face only Mecca when they prayed . 
 = = = Religious status = = = 
 Jerusalem is recognized as a sacred site in Islam . Though the Quran does not mention Jerusalem by name , it has been understood by Islamic scholars since the earliest times that many passages in the Quran refer to Jerusalem . Jerusalem is also mentioned many times in the hadith . Some academics attribute the holiness of Jerusalem to the rise and expansion of a certain type of literary genre , known as al @-@ <unk> or history of cities . The <unk> of Jerusalem inspired Muslims , especially during the Umayyad period , to embellish the sanctity of the city beyond its status in the holy texts . Others point to the political motives of the Umayyad dynasty which led to the sanctification of Jerusalem in Islam . 
 Later medieval scripts , as well as modern @-@ day political tracts , tend to classify al @-@ Aqsa Mosque as the third holiest site in Islam . For example , Sahih al @-@ Bukhari quotes Abu Darda as saying : " the Prophet of God Muhammad said a prayer in the Sacred Mosque ( in Mecca ) is worth 100 @,@ 000 prayers ; a prayer in my mosque ( in Medina ) is worth 1 @,@ 000 prayers ; and a prayer in al @-@ Aqsa Mosque is worth 500 prayers more than in any other mosque " . In addition , the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation , refers to the al @-@ Aqsa Mosque as the third holiest site in Islam ( and calls for Arab sovereignty over it ) .

 The Waqf Ministry of Jordan held control of the al @-@ Aqsa Mosque until the 1967 Six @-@ Day War . After Israel 's victory in that war , Israel transferred the control of the mosque and the northern Noble Sanctuary to the Islamic waqf trust , who are independent of the Israeli government . However , Israeli Security Forces are permitted to patrol and conduct searches within the perimeter of the mosque . After the 1969 arson attack , the waqf employed architects , technicians and craftsmen in a committee that carry out regular maintenance operations . The Islamic Movement in Israel and the waqf have attempted to increase Muslim control of the Temple Mount as a way of countering Israeli policies and the escalating presence of Israeli security forces around the site since the Second Intifada . Some activities included refurbishing abandoned structures and renovating . 
 Muhammad Ahmad Hussein is the head imam and manager of the al @-@ Aqsa Mosque and was assigned the role of Grand Mufti of Jerusalem in 2006 by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas . Ownership of the al @-@ Aqsa Mosque is a contentious issue in the Israel @-@ Palestinian conflict . Israel claims sovereignty over the mosque along with all of the Temple Mount ( Noble Sanctuary ) , but Palestinians hold the custodianship of the site through the Islamic waqf . During the negotiations at the 2000 Camp David Summit , Palestinians demanded complete ownership of the mosque and other Islamic holy sites in East Jerusalem .

 = = = Access = = = 
 Muslim residents of Israel and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are normally allowed to enter the Temple Mount and pray at the al @-@ Aqsa Mosque without restrictions . Due to security measures , the Israeli government occasionally prevents certain groups of Muslims from reaching al @-@ Aqsa by blocking the entrances to the complex ; the restrictions vary from time to time . At times restrictions have prevented all men under 50 and women under 45 from entering , but married men over 45 are allowed . Sometimes the restrictions are enforced on the occasion of Friday prayers , other times they are over an extended period of time . Restrictions are most severe for Gazans , followed by restrictions on those from West Bank . The Israeli government states that the restrictions are in place for security reasons . 
 Until 2000 , non @-@ Muslim visitors could enter the Al @-@ Aqsa Mosque by getting a ticket from the Waqf . That procedure ended when the Second Intifada began . Fifteen years later , negotiation between Israel and Jordan might result in allowing visitors to enter once again . 
 = = = Excavations = = = 
 Several excavations outside the Temple Mount took place following the 1967 War . In 1970 , Israeli authorities commenced intensive excavations outside the walls next to the mosque on the southern and western sides . Palestinians believed that tunnels were being dug under the Al @-@ Aqsa Mosque in order to undermine its foundations , which was denied by Israelis , who claimed that the closest excavation to the mosque was some 70 meters ( 230 ft ) to its south . The Archaeological Department of the Israeli Ministry of Religious Affairs dug a tunnel near the western portion of the mosque in 1984 . According to UNESCO 's special envoy to Jerusalem Oleg Grabar , buildings and structures on the Temple Mount are deteriorating due mostly to disputes between the Israeli , Palestinian and Jordanian governments over who is actually responsible for the site . 
 In February 2007 , the Department started to excavate a site for archaeological remains in a location where the government wanted to rebuild a collapsed pedestrian bridge leading to the <unk> Gate , the only entrance for non @-@ Muslims into the Temple Mount complex . This site was 60 meters ( 200 ft ) away from the mosque . The excavations provoked anger throughout the Islamic world , and Israel was accused of trying to destroy the foundation of the mosque . Ismail <unk> — then Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority and Hamas leader — called on Palestinians to unite to protest the excavations , while Fatah said they would end their ceasefire with Israel . Israel denied all charges against them , calling them " ludicrous " .

 " The Cure " is the sixth episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe . It followed two women suffering from a fictional disease , who are then given radiation drugs and exploited by a pharmaceutical company to cause nearby individuals ' brains to boil . 
 The episode was written by Felicia D. Henderson and Brad Caleb Kane , and directed by Bill Eagles . Executive producer Jeff Pinkner meant for the first six episodes of the first season to serve as a " prologue " , while the following episodes would get " into the next chapter " of the series . 
 " The Cure " first aired in the United States on October 21 , 2008 on the Fox network to an estimated 8 @.@ 91 viewers . It received mixed to negative reviews , with many critics doubting the plausibility of the science depicted in the episode .

 In Milford , Massachusetts , men in <unk> suits drop a woman ( Maria <unk> ) out of a white van , who then enters a nearby diner . Suffering from memory loss , the woman becomes irritated under a cop 's questioning and causes the other patrons ' brains to boil and then explode ; she dies soon after in the same fashion . 
 The Fringe team consisting of Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv ) , Walter Bishop ( John Noble ) , and Peter Bishop ( Joshua Jackson ) arrive , and Agent Phillip Broyles ( Lance Reddick ) briefs them that the woman , Emily Kramer , disappeared two weeks previously , and that her corpse exhibits three times the radiation as the other victims . Upon further investigation of her body , Walter concludes she was suffering from a rare and incurable disease , " Bellini 's lymphocemia , " but was mysteriously cured . Further tests reveal Kramer was held against her will , and given nootropic drugs intravenously that makes her brain emit a microwave burst , then set loose by her experimenters as a test . 
 Another woman with the same disease , Claire Williams ( Marjan <unk> ) , is reported missing soon after . Before her disappearance , Claire 's husband tells them she also was recently cured . Her captors are shown , commenting that " the last one was a test , this one counts " . While rifling through Emily 's house , Olivia and Peter learn Emily and Claire were friends , and that Emily 's husband also knew her despite denying it earlier . He tells them they and other victims of the disease undertook private research and discovered a cure with the help of a physician , Dr. Nadim Patel ( Alok Tewari ) . Before committing suicide , the doctor tells them David Esterbrook ( Chris Eigeman ) , the chief scientist of a competitor of Massive Dynamic , is the one responsible . Olivia confronts Esterbrook at a medical conference to discover his motivations , only to be threatened by him ; Broyles admonishes her for intimidating such a high profile individual in a public setting . 
 To get to the high profile Esterbrook , Peter makes a deal with Nina Sharp ( Blair Brown ) , who tells him where to find Claire before she can be turned into a radioactive bomb . The FBI storms the building , and Olivia is able to give Claire the cure before her head explodes . <unk> arrogantly tells Olivia his lawyers will spring him out of any trouble , and she publicly arrests him to ensure the press finds out , causing his company 's stock to dramatically decrease in value . After Broyles lectures her , Olivia tells him her emotions ( which she had exhibited strongly all episode ) make her a better agent . 
 In a sideplot , Olivia reveals that she shot her abusive stepfather when she was nine years old , but he survived and disappeared soon after . The strong emotions Olivia exhibited in the episode were because the events take place on her birthday , and her stepfather sends her a card every year to let her know " he 's still out there " . The final scene shows Olivia opening a birthday card from her stepfather .

 Pinkner also told the Los Angeles Times that " Bellini 's lymphocemia " , the disease depicted in the episode , was invented by the writers , but its characteristics are real . He elaborated " We just didn 't want to imply that individuals working on their own could cure it . We didn 't want to be irresponsible to people with the real disease " . Some critics have noted that " Bellini 's lymphocemia " may have been a reference to Italian physician and anatomist Lorenzo Bellini .

Eigeman 's David Esterbrook 's assistant was named after Elizabeth Sarnoff , a television writer and producer . Some of her work includes Lost , another series created by J. J. Abrams . 
 For the opening scene , a " special kind of blood " was placed in and around the actors ' eyes to simulate their brains boiling . For the scene in which the actress is pushed up against a glass door , the special effects department created a device wearing a brown wig with an explosive charge designed to imitate the actress ' head exploding . Director Bill Eagles described the scene as " <unk> [ ing ] an egg in your microwave spinning around and around at high voltage . What happens ? Bang ! It just explodes . "

 Reviews for the episode ranged from mixed to negative . TV Squad writer Jane Boursaw noted that Broyles " is surely one of the most intense guys on TV " , and also enjoyed Walter 's scenes . Josie Kafka from Open Salon thought the fringe cases each week were " an odd way to build a mythology : the Big Secret seems to be that people in positions of power are evil and do evil things , often for money . But if Peter 's right , and all these stand @-@ alones are also detailing a series of steps taken by the Big <unk> in preparation for something ... well , that 's an exciting idea . " She gave it " two out of four Expendable Gerbils . " io9 's Annalee Newitz praised the episode , declaring it made her " officially a watcher of Fringe , rather than a sampler " . She continued , " It was the first time that the show really gelled ... I think Fringe hit its stride last night because it finally showed us our main characters ' true strengths ... More importantly , Fringe has finally gotten into its main groove : human experimentation . That 's what links all the scooby gang 's investigations together into the Pattern , and that 's what makes this show particularly timely in an age when people are scared of how biotechnology will change humanity . " 
 Further reviews tended to be negative . IGN 's Travis Fickett rated the episode 6 @.@ 0 / 10 , explaining " It 's starting to feel as if Walter 's loony logic is starting to influence the actual writing of Fringe . " Fickett criticized Walter 's science and " silly ranting [ s ] " , Olivia 's stepfather storyline , and believed certain lines of dialogue to be " dangerously close to self @-@ parody . " Sarah Stegall from SFScope was skeptical of the episode 's science , and explained " I really don 't want any more of this . I 'm tired of this formulaic series . I 'm tired of Anna Torv 's earnest , sad expressions — can we get this woman to laugh once or twice ? Joshua Jackson and Kirk Acevedo are good supports and foils for Olivia , but there 's no there there when it comes to Agent Dunham . " Patrick Kevin Day from the Los Angeles Times liked the opening sequence , but was distracted from fully enjoying the episode because he thought the science was " wonky . " The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray graded the episode with a B , explaining he liked Chris Eigeman 's presence and the efforts at further developing the characters , but questioned the Pattern storyline , despite admitting that he does not require rational scientific explanations in science fiction . Tim Grierson of New York Magazine disliked the focus on Olivia , calling it " a long hour of television . " Referring to Olivia 's " feminist " speech to Broyles , Grierson continued , " It 's sort of cute how Fringe occasionally pretends that it 's more than just a freak show . But if they 're going to focus on a character , it should be Walter — though we shudder to think how his flatulence will factor into the plot . " 
 = Buxbaumia = 
 Buxbaumia ( Bug moss , Bug @-@ on @-@ a @-@ stick , <unk> elves , or Elf @-@ cap moss ) is a genus of twelve species of moss ( Bryophyta ) . It was first named in 1742 by Albrecht von Haller and later brought into modern botanical nomenclature in 1801 by Johann Hedwig to commemorate Johann Christian <unk> , a German physician and botanist who discovered the moss in 1712 at the mouth of the Volga River . The moss is microscopic for most of its existence , and plants are noticeable only after they begin to produce their reproductive structures . The asymmetrical spore capsule has a distinctive shape and structure , some features of which appear to be transitional from those in primitive mosses to most modern mosses . 
 = = Description = = 
 Plants of Buxbaumia have a much reduced gametophyte , bearing a sporophyte that is enormous by comparison . In most mosses , the gametophyte stage of the life cycle is both green and leafy , and is substantially larger than the spore @-@ producing stage . Unlike these other mosses , the gametophyte of Buxbaumia is microscopic , colorless , stemless , and nearly leafless . It consists exclusively of thread @-@ like <unk> for most of its existence , resembling a thin green @-@ black felt on the surface where it grows . The plants are dioicous , with separate plants producing the male and female organs . Male plants develop only one microscopic leaf around each <unk> , and female plants produce just three or four tiny colorless leaves around each archegonium . 
 Because of its small size , the gametophyte stage is not generally noticed until the stalked sporangium develops , and is <unk> principally because the sporangium grows upon and above the tiny gametophyte . The extremely reduced state of Buxbaumia plants raises the question of how it makes or obtains sufficient nutrition for survival . In contrast to most mosses , Buxbaumia does not produce abundant chlorophyll and is saprophytic . It is possible that some of its nutritional needs are met by fungi that grow within the plant . 
 The sporophyte at maturity is between 4 and 11 mm tall . The spore capsule is attached at the top of the stalk and is distinctive , being asymmetric in shape and oblique in attachment . As with most other Bryopsida , the opening through which the spores are released is surrounded by a double peristome ( <unk> ) formed from the cell walls of disintegrated cells . The <unk> ( outer row ) consists of 16 short articulated " teeth " . Unlike most other mosses , the <unk> ( inner row ) does not divide into teeth , but rather is a continuous pleated membrane around the capsule opening . Only the genus Diphyscium has a similar peristome structure , although that genus has only 16 pleats in its <unk> , in contrast to the 32 pleats in Buxbaumia . Diphyscium shares with Buxbaumia one other oddity of the sporophyte ; the foot ( stalk base ) <unk> as a result of outgrowths , so much so that they may be mistaken for rhizoids . 
 = = Distribution and ecology = = 
 Species of Buxbaumia may be found across much of the temperate to subarctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere , as well as cooler regions of Australia and New Zealand . 
 The moss is an annual or biennial plant and grows in disturbed habitats or as a pioneer species . The plants grow on decaying wood , rock outcrops , or directly on the soil . They do not grow regularly or reliably at given locations , and frequently disappear from places where they have previously been found . <unk> stages begin their development in the autumn , and are green through the winter months . Spores are mature and ready for dispersal by the late spring or early summer . The spores are ejected from the capsule in puffs when raindrops fall upon the capsule 's flattened top . 
 The asymmetric sporophytes of Buxbaumia <unk> develop so that the opening is oriented towards the strongest source of light , usually towards the south . The species often grows together with the diminutive liverwort <unk> , which forms a blackish crust that is easier to spot than Buxbaumia itself . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Buxbaumia is the only genus in the family Buxbaumiaceae , the order <unk> , and the subclass <unk> . It is the sister group to all other members of class Bryopsida . Some older classifications included the <unk> within the <unk> ( or as part of the Buxbaumiaceae ) because of similarities in the peristome structure , or placed the Buxbaumiaceae in the <unk> . Most recent cladistic studies using DNA sequences are not conclusive regarding the relationship between Buxbaumia and Diphyscium , but evidence suggests they are separate lines of a paraphyletic group . No recent studies favor a placement with the <unk> . 
 The genus Buxbaumia includes twelve species : 
 Because of the simplicity of its structure , Goebel interpreted Buxbaumia as a primitive moss , transitional between the algae and mosses , but subsequent research suggests that it is a secondarily reduced form . The unusual peristome in Buxbaumia is now thought to be a transitional form between the <unk> ( cellular teeth ) peristome of the <unk> and the <unk> ( cell wall teeth ) peristome of the Bryopsida . 
 = Ashland Mill Bridge = 
 The Ashland Mill Bridge was a lenticular pony truss bridge over the Pachaug River in Griswold , Connecticut that was built in 1886 by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company . It was built following the Ashland dam break of February 1886 which washed away the previous bridges . The bridge served the <unk> of the Ashland Cotton Company , in the Jewett City section of Griswold . The bridge was 65 feet ( 20 m ) long and crossed a <unk> on a skew angle . The Ashland Mill was damaged by arson in March 1994 and subsequently torn down , but the bridge itself remained . By 1999 , the town deemed the bridge unsafe and closed it , and by February 1999 , the bridge was moved to a vacant parking lot and was replaced with a new bridge . The bridge was added to the state of Connecticut historic register and it was later added to the National Register of Historic Places in April 1999 . It was removed from the National Register in February 2016 . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Heavy rains in February 1886 caused the Ashland dam to break and the resulting flood damaged the Ashland Cotton Company 's buildings and washed away the previous bridges at the site . The Berlin Iron Bridge Company was contracted to build a total of three bridges in the area , the Ashland Mill Bridge , another larger lenticular truss for Ashland Street and another 33 feet ( 10 m ) bridge for the Slater mill which was located further downstream . Clouette and Tinh note that the mill owners may have been influenced in their decision by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company 's bridges that were already in place in the surrounding area . 
 The Ashland Mill Bridge was a single @-@ span lenticular pony truss bridge . Completed in 1886 , it was a roadway from Ashland Street to the <unk> . The bridge was made of four 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) long panels , totaling 65 feet ( 20 m ) in length . The roadway was 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) wide . The bridge 's wrought @-@ iron truss was 6 @.@ 5 feet ( 2 @.@ 0 m ) deep and it crossed the river at a 28 ° angle . All but the truss 's joints were pinned except for the <unk> ' lower @-@ chord nut connections ; as was distinctive of the Berlin Iron Bridge Company 's bridges . The plate @-@ girder floor beams supported wooden stringers and floored with planks across the width of the bridge . The bridge 's railing were made of two 5 / 8 @-@ inch ( 1 @.@ <unk> cm ) rods bolted to the inside of the trusses . A 1905 postcard depicts the bridge being painted red , but the paint was nearly absent by 1998 . 
 = = Fate = = 
 In March 1994 , the manufacturing buildings were damaged by arson and were subsequently demolished . The site became a town park and the bridge was anticipated to be rehabilitated and serve as a pedestrian bridge in the park . The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in April 1999 for being a historically significant example of late 19th @-@ century bridge fabrication and as a surviving example of a bridge built by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company without significant modification or deterioration . It was also locally significant as a remaining artefact of the Ashland Cotton Company , formerly a major employer in the city . 
 In 1999 , the town closed the bridge as it was deemed unsafe and badly deteriorated . It was estimated that $ 72 @,@ 000 would be needed to relocate the bridge . In February 1999 , an eight @-@ member committee was tasked with planning a municipal park on the site . First Selectman Paul <unk> , hoped that the pending nomination to the National Register of Historic Places would help obtain grant money to repair the bridge . Prior to February 1999 , the historic bridge was moved to a vacant parking lot near the town hall and a replacement bridge was installed . The bridge was also on the state of Connecticut 's historic register list .

 = = Early life and background = = 
 Ranbir Kapoor was born on 28 September 1982 in Mumbai to Rishi and Neetu , both actors of the Hindi film industry . He is the great @-@ grandson of Prithviraj and the grandson of actor @-@ director Raj . His elder sister , <unk> ( born 1980 ) , is an interior and fashion designer . The actresses Karisma and Kareena are his first cousins . Kapoor was educated at the Bombay Scottish School in Mahim . As a student , he found little interest in academics and would rank low among his peers . 
 Kapoor has been vocal about how his parent 's troubled marriage affected him as a child : " Sometimes the fights would get really bad . I would be sitting on the steps , my head between my knees , till five or six in the morning , waiting for them to stop " . These experiences led to a " reservoir of emotions building up inside [ him ] " , which he said compelled him to develop an interest in film . In his early years , Kapoor was close to his mother , but had a dysfunctional relationship with his father . After completing his tenth standard examinations , he worked as an assistant director to his father on the film Aa Ab Laut <unk> ( 1999 ) , during which he developed a closer bond with him . 
 After completing his pre @-@ university education from the H.R. College of Commerce and Economics , Kapoor relocated to New York City to learn film @-@ making at the School of Visual Arts , and subsequently pursued method acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute . In film school , Kapoor directed and starred in two short films , entitled Passion to Love and India 1964 . The loneliness of living alone in New York City coupled with his experience in film school , which he described as " useless " , inspired him to pursue a career in Bollywood . Upon returning to Mumbai , Kapoor was hired as an assistant director to Sanjay Leela Bhansali on the 2005 film Black . He described the experience : " I was getting beaten up , abused , doing everything from cleaning the floor to fixing the lights from 7 am to 4 am , but I was learning every day . " He later remarked that his motive for working on Black was to get Bhansali to offer him an acting job .

 = = = Debut and initial success ( 2007 – 10 ) = = = 
 Following the release of Black , Bhansali cast Kapoor as the protagonist of his 2007 tragic romance Saawariya , alongside Sonam Kapoor and Rani Mukerji . The film tells the story of a tramp , played by him , who falls obsessively in love with a woman awaiting the return of her lover . In an interview with the news and entertainment portal Rediff.com , Kapoor stated that his character was written as a tribute to his grandfather 's iconic roles as a tramp . Saawariya was the first Indian film to be produced by a Hollywood studio ( Sony Pictures Entertainment ) , and was a highly anticipated release . However , film critics were disappointed with the picture with BBC 's Jaspreet Pandohar calling it a " misfire on a massive scale " . CNN @-@ IBN 's Rajeev Masand considered it " contrived and fake " , but was impressed by Kapoor 's " affable charm " and wrote that " he ’ s got that star quality to him which is so rare to find . " At the box office , Saawariya failed to earn profits . However , at the annual Filmfare Awards ceremony , Kapoor was awarded a Best Male Debut trophy . 
 Despite the commercial failure of Saawariya , Kapoor was contracted by Yash Raj Films for a primary role in the Siddharth Anand @-@ directed romantic comedy Bachna Ae Haseeno ( 2008 ) . The film was his first commercial success , in which his role was that of a womaniser who is romantically involved with three women , played by Bipasha Basu , <unk> Lamba , and Deepika Padukone , at different stages of his life . Rachel Saltz of The New York Times expressed mixed views on his performance , but predicted that his " puppy @-@ dog sweetness " would " serve him well as a Bollywood leading man " . 
 In 2009 , Kapoor had three film releases . In Dharma Productions 's Wake Up Sid , a coming of age film from director Ayan Mukerji , Kapoor portrayed Siddharth " Sid " Mehra , a rich , lazy teenager whose life undergoes a series of changes after interacting with an ambitious journalist ( played by Konkana Sen Sharma ) . When Mukerji narrated the then @-@ untitled script of the film to him , Kapoor came up with the title himself . The media expressed doubt on the film 's financial prospect as it depicted a romantic relationship between a younger man and an older woman . It eventually emerged as a sleeper hit and garnered acclaim from the critics . Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama reviewed that Kapoor 's performance in the film proved that he was " amongst the best in the business today " . 
 Kapoor next starred opposite Katrina Kaif in Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani , a slapstick comedy from director Rajkumar Santoshi , that emerged as the fourth highest @-@ grossing Bollywood film of 2009 . Film critic Gaurav Malani praised Kapoor 's flair for comedy , but criticised his " over @-@ excited husky baritone " . Kapoor 's final release that year was the <unk> Amin @-@ directed Rocket Singh : Salesman of the Year , a drama about a <unk> who aspires to be a salesman . Film critic Mayank Shekhar praised the film and found Kapoor 's performance to be " astonishingly sincere " , but the film earned little at the box office . Kapoor later professed to being highly disappointed by the film 's commercial failure . At the 55th Filmfare Awards , Kapoor was awarded the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for his performances in all three of his 2009 releases , and he also received two Best Actor nominations at the ceremony for Wake Up Sid and Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani . 
 Prakash Jha 's big @-@ budget ensemble political thriller Raajneeti was Kapoor 's first release of 2010 . The film , which starred Nana Patekar , Ajay Devgn , Arjun Rampal , Manoj Bajpayee , Katrina Kaif and Sarah Thompson in prominent roles , was inspired by the Indian epic The Mahabharata and Mario Puzo 's 1969 novel The Godfather . Kapoor 's role was of Samar Pratap ( based on the characters of Arjuna and Michael Corleone ) , the youngest heir of an Indian political dynasty , who is reluctantly drawn to politics after the assassination of his father . Kapoor described it as his first complex role and considered it a departure from the " lover boy roles " that he had previously played . Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India reviewed : " The film finally belongs to Ranbir Kapoor who perfects the art of minimalism — and literally grows before your eyes — as the simmering volcano that cannot be held back , once it erupts . " Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times , however , was more critical of his performance which he considered " stony rather than calculating — especially jarring compared to the histrionic turns around him " . Indian trade journalists were apprehensive of Raajneeti recovering its ₹ 600 million ( US $ 8 @.@ 9 million ) investment . The film , however , proved to be a major commercial success with worldwide earnings of over ₹ 1 @.@ 43 billion ( US $ 21 million ) . Kapoor received a third Best Actor nomination at Filmfare for the film . 
 Later that same year , Kapoor collaborated with Priyanka Chopra on Anand 's Anjaana Anjaani , a comedy @-@ drama involving two strangers who vow to commit suicide on New Year 's Eve . The film was a moderate financial success , but garnered little praise from the critics . Rajeev Masand noted that Kapoor " struggles with a badly @-@ defined role " and NDTV 's Anupama Chopra concluded : " Ranbir tries hard to salvage the film , dropping his shirt several times but even his lovingly shot chest can ’ t save the film .

Film critics were polarised on their view of the film , but were unanimous in their praise for Kapoor ; Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis was particularly impressed with the film and thought that Kapoor 's portrayal was one of " Hindi cinema ’ s most accomplished performances by a lead actor " . For the role , Kapoor won both the Best Actor and Best Actor ( Critics ) trophies at the 57th Filmfare Awards ceremony , along with Best Actor awards at Screen and IIFA . With a gross revenue of ₹ 1 @.@ 07 billion ( US $ 16 million ) , Rockstar was one of the top @-@ grossing Hindi films of the year .

Kapoor portrayed an ambitious boxer in the 1960s who is drawn towards a life of crime ; he based his <unk> diction on Johnny Walker 's character in Mr. & Mrs. ' 55 ( 1955 ) . Made on a budget of ₹ 1 @.@ 2 billion ( US $ 18 million ) , the film opened to meager box @-@ office collections and mixed reviews from critics . Ritika Bhatia of Business Standard found Kapoor 's part to be a departure from his previous roles , writing that he " does test the waters with methodical sincerity but his portrayal lacks depth on occasion " . Bombay Velvet was eventually screened at the Locarno and <unk> film festivals . 
 Kapoor next reunited with Deepika Padukone to film Tamasha ( 2015 ) , a romantic drama from Imtiaz Ali . He played the role of Ved Sahni , a man who desires a career in the arts but settles for a life of monotony as an engineer . As with his previous three releases , the film failed commercially and received mixed reviews from critics . Kapoor 's performance , however , was praised ; Lisa Tsering of The Hollywood Reporter wrote , " Kapoor is beautifully cast , his trademark mix of assertive theatricality and subtle emotion well suited to the role of a man who seemingly has it all under control , until he doesn ’ t .

The relationship attracted substantial media coverage in India and they speculated on an impending engagement . However , the couple broke up a year later . Kapoor maintained that the split was amicable , though the media widely reported that the split was due to infidelity on Kapoor 's part .

 = Grangegorman killings = 
 The Grangegorman killings refers to the homicide on 6 March 1997 of Sylvia Shields and Mary Callinan , patients of St Brendan ’ s Psychiatric Hospital in Grangegorman , Dublin , Ireland . After giving a false confession , Dean Lyons was charged with the murders and placed on remand . In his statement to the Irish police force , the Garda Síochána ( commonly called the Gardaí ) , Lyons gave details that would only be known to the murderer or to the investigators . After Lyons was charged , Mark Nash confessed to the killings , but later retracted his confession . In April 2015 , Nash 's trial for the murder of Shields and Callinan began after an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the trial from going forward . 
 Lyons was described by one of the gardaí ( policemen ) involved in the case as a " Walter Mitty " character , and Dr Charles Smith , psychiatrist and director of the Central Mental Hospital , Dundrum , felt that he might be prone to exaggeration and attention seeking . A commission of investigation was set up to investigate the conduct of the gardaí in the case . Dean Lyons died from a heroin overdose in 2000 . He spent nine months in jail for a crime that he did not commit . 
 = = Murders = = 
 On the morning of 7 March 1997 , Sylvia Shields and Mary Callinan were found dead in No.1 Orchard View , Grangegorman , Dublin 7 . They were found by Ann <unk> , another resident of the house , who raised the alarm at No.5 Orchard View . The house was a two story end of terrace house owned by the Eastern Health Board , and was used to provide sheltered accommodation for outpatients of St Brendan ’ s Psychiatric Hospital . The entire Orchard View area was completely demolished 15 years after the murders and is now an empty plot surrounded by a wall . 
 The two women had been repeatedly stabbed , their throats and faces had been cut . One of the women 's genitals had been extensively mutilated , and both women were partially undressed . The level of mutilation had never before been encountered in a murder investigation in Ireland . Neither of the women had been raped , and no semen was found at the scene . The killings were described as : " the most brutal murders in Irish criminal history " by the Irish Examiner newspaper 
 = = Initial investigation = = 
 After the alarm had been raised , a major investigation commenced involving detectives from the Dublin Metropolitan North Central Division and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation ( <unk> ) . The house and the surrounding area were subject to a forensic examination by the Garda Technical Bureau . Gardaí performed house to house inquiries , took more than 1000 statements , and interviewed over 250 suspects . A postmortem examination of the bodies was made by the State Pathologist , Professor John Harbison ; his first report was delivered on 13 March 1997 . No material was found either by the forensic examination of the scene or by the postmortem examination that would have linked a suspect to the crime . 
 From the beginning of the investigation until 26 July 1997 , the Gardaí had no main suspect . In April 1997 , they engaged a team of criminal psychologists to develop a profile of the killer . Among other items in their initial report , they said that " THE <unk> WAS <unk> <unk> AND WAS <unk> TO <unk> " ( emphasis in original ) , and that the killer was likely to have had prior experience of burglary . A local resident had noticed someone acting suspiciously a week or two before the killings ; his statement to the Gardaí was used to make a facial composite : 
 " I would describe this fellow as about 6 @-@ foot to 6 @-@ foot 2 , aged 35 to 38 years , very slim , had a black moustache , long at the side . He had a stubble which was very noticeable , a week or two ’ s growth . The moustache was much thicker than the stubble . He had dark hair , straight and to the shoulder . His hair was split at the middle in the front and brushed to each side . He had a long thin face . He had dark eyes and dark eyebrows . He was badly dressed as if the clothes did not suit him . He was dirty looking but not scruffy looking . He was wearing jeans that had a flare , blue in colour . He had dirty white runners on . He was wearing an <unk> type coat which came down a few inches below the waist . The coat was zipped up and was a bright colour like a bright brown colour without a hood . " 
 As a result of the psychological profile , the Gardaí broadcast an appeal for information on the RTÉ television programme <unk> with a request for people whose houses had been broken into in the Grangegorman area to contact them . After interviewing a number of people involved in burglary , they discovered that Dean Lyons had been talking about the killings . Lyons matched the facial composite released by the gardaí and he was questioned on 26 July 1997 . 
 = = Dean Lyons = = 
 Dean Lyons was born on 20 April 1973 ; he was 24 when he was arrested . He grew up in Tallaght in West Dublin , the fourth in a family of six children . He went to Scoil <unk> National School in Tallaght , where he had some difficulty with his schoolwork . According to his teachers , in today 's terms , he would have been classified as having a moderate general learning disability . He was assessed by a psychologist when he was in sixth class , around the age of twelve , who found him to have an intelligence quotient of 70 . As a result of the psychologist 's report , Lyons was moved to St. Joseph 's Special School in Tallaght . During his period in St. Joseph 's , he developed a reputation for attention seeking and storytelling . After school , he never held down a steady job and drifted into heroin addiction and homelessness . At the time of his arrest for the Grangegorman murders , he had one conviction for burglary , and had been involved in a number of syringe robberies . 
 = = = First interview and arrest = = = 
 At the time of Lyons ' first interview with the gardaí , he was staying at the Salvation Army hostel in Grangegorman . Detective Garda William Mullis and Garda Joseph O ’ Connor approached him as he was leaving the hostel . They reported that Lyons said : “ I think I know what this is about ” . The gardaí brought Lyons to the Bridewell <unk> station , and interviewed him in the doctor 's room . According to the gardaí , at one point during the interview , Lyons burst out crying and said that he had killed the two women . Lyons claimed that he was suffering withdrawal symptoms at the time and that he made the admission so that he could get more drugs . He said that Garda O ’ Connor had promised that the sooner he confessed , the sooner he would be released from custody and that he " wasn 't thinking straight " . The gardaí say that he was told that he was not under arrest and that he could leave at any time . As a result of his confession , Dean Lyons was arrested on suspicion of murdering the two women at 13 : 46 on 26 July 1997 . 
 Lyons ' admissions during the first interview were not very detailed , and many of the details provided did not match the evidence . Lyons gave incorrect information about the precise location of the killings and about the number of weapons used . During the interview , he was confused about the number of people that had been killed , and he thought that the women were awake , and moving about the house at the time , which conflicted with the forensic evidence . 
 = = = Subsequent interviews = = = 
 While the first interview was videotaped , at the beginning of the second interview , Lyons said that he wanted video recording to be stopped . It has been alleged that the decision to terminate the recording was prompted by the gardaí before the start of the second interview . A number of items discussed during the second interview were not included on the formal interview record , including anecdotes told by Lyons about his former criminal activity which gardaí believed at the time to be untrue . As the interview continued , Lyons was asked if he wanted to make a formal statement , to which he agreed . This statement contains a number of points about the killings that were not known to the public at the time . Some of the more glaring inaccuracies mentioned in the first interview are not included in the statement , although this statement contains some notable omissions and inaccuracies . 
 Midway through the interview , Lyons was allowed a break , during which he was seen by a doctor , and was given medication . He also met his father during this break . He told his father that he had committed the murder , to which his father replied : “ Dean , you are a terrible liar ” . The gardaí had an informal meeting during the break , during which some gardaí expressed unease about Dean Lyons ; Detective Garda Cox described him as a " Walter Mitty " character during this meeting . There are some significant changes in Lyons ' story after the break . For example : prior to the break , he claimed that he had used only one knife and after the break , he said that he had used four separate weapons , including electric carving knives . The latter description matches closely to Professor Harbison 's report . A number of detailed descriptions were given which matched closely with the physical evidence and with the psychological profile . 
 = = = Doubts about Dean Lyons ' testimony = = = 
 As mentioned , some of the gardaí had expressed doubts about Lyons while he was being interviewed . Dr Charles Smith found his confession unconvincing and expressed his concerns to Lyons ' solicitor while Lyons was on remand . Dr <unk> <unk> , a psychologist engaged by Lyons ' solicitors , found that he was very suggestible and susceptible to leading questions . The commission of investigation pointed out the following exchange as an example of Lyons changing his position in response to a question : 
 Dean Lyons ( DL ) : “ I met two women at the top of the stairs and I went mad because they started screaming and I stabbed them . ” 
 Detective Garda Cox ( DC ) : “ I have to put it to you that you are not telling the truth at this stage , is that correct . ” 
 DL : “ It ’ s months ago and it is not easy to remember when you are on gear because it fucks your head up . ” 
 DC : “ Is it that you don ’ t remember or is it that you don ’ t want to remember . ” 
 DL : No reply . 
 DC : “ Can you describe the first woman that you met and what room she came out of . ” 
 DL : “ It was the second room from the top of the stairs and she was stout about one or two inches smaller than me and she had grey shoulder length hair . She was wearing a very light nightdress . ” 
 Detective Sergeant McNulty : “ What happened when you met her . ” 
 DL : “ I stabbed her a few times to stop her screaming . ” 
 DC : “ I put it to you that this did not happen in the hallway but happened in the bedroom , would you agree . ” 
 DL : “ Yes . ” 
 = = Mark Nash 's confession = = 
 In August 1997 , Carl Doyle and his wife Catherine Doyle were stabbed to death in <unk> , Co Roscommon by Mark Nash , a 25 @-@ year @-@ old resident of Drumcondra in North Dublin . During his interview with the gardaí , he said that about three months prior to his arrest , as he was walking to <unk> , he broke into a house through the back , and had stabbed two women in their sleep . In his statement , there were at least two aspects of the crime scene that were not known to the public at the time . Nash later retracted his confession . In 2011 , Nash sought a judicial review to prevent his trial from going ahead on the grounds that a fair trial had been prejudiced by a delay in prosecuting him . In August 2012 , the Irish High Court ruled against him . 
 Mark Nash 's confession caused some consternation amongst the gardaí , as Dean Lyons had been charged at that point and was on remand awaiting trial . Two camps emerged within the gardaí , one which believed that Nash 's confession threw doubt on Lyons ' guilt , the other which believed that Lyons was the murderer . On 27 August 1997 , the Garda Commissioner appointed Assistant Commissioner James McHugh to carry out a review of the available evidence . He released a preliminary report on 10 September 1997 , and an interim report on 9 January 1998 ; while these reports did not come to a conclusion about Lyons ' guilt , they did raise a number of doubts about his testimony . 
 = = Lyons exonerated = = 
 As a result of Assistant Commissioner McHugh 's investigation and due to the defense solicitor 's refusal to release Dr <unk> 's report , the Director of Public Prosecutions ' office appointed a psychologist , Dr Adrian Grounds , to assess Dean Lyons . Dr Grounds concluded that Dean Lyons was highly suggestible and that his admissions were unreliable : 
 " I am not in a position to corroborate Mr Lyons ’ account of being corrected , prompted and advised by Garda officers and his description of learning from them about the details of the admissions they were seeking . However Mr Lyons ’ account to me in our interview supported and was consistent with the earlier impressions I had gained from reading the case papers . In my earlier report I noted that the materials then available to me raised questions about whether the details of Mr Lyons ’ final admissions could have derived from the content of questions put to him during the day , rather than his knowledge and memory , and about whether he was unusually suggestible . Following my interview with Dean Lyons and his parents , these concerns are substantially strengthened and I now think that it is very likely that his detailed admissions were unreliable . " 
 As a result of Dr Grounds ' report , the charge of murder against Dean Lyons was dropped on 29 April 1998 ; he had been imprisoned on remand for nine months . Lyons died in 2000 of a heroin overdose . In 2005 , the Garda Síochána published an apology to the Lyons family for Dean Lyons ' arrest and detention in national newspapers . 
 = = Commission of investigation = = 
 In February 2006 , a commission of investigation was established to investigate the circumstances surrounding Dean Lyons ' confession and arrest , its sole member was George Birmingham , S.C. The commission 's terms of reference are stated below : 
 To undertake a thorough investigation and make a report in accordance with the provisions of section 32 of the Commission of Investigation Act 2004 ( No. 23 of 2004 ) on the following specific matters : 
 1 ) the circumstances surrounding the making of a confession by Dean Lyons ( deceased ) about the deaths of Ms Mary Callinan and Ms Sylvia <unk> in March 1997 in Grangegorman Dublin 7 @,@ 
 2 ) the adequacy of the Garda assessment of the reliability of Mr Lyons ’ confession both before and after he was charged with murder , and 
 3 ) the adequacy of information provided by the Garda Síochána on the morning of 27 July 1997 to the Director of Public Prosecutions and in particular whether any additional information should have been provided at that time .

 In 2006 , Robert McNulty leaked the draft report of the commission to the Evening Herald newspaper before it was publicly available .

 = = = Commission findings = = = 
 The commission found that Lyons acquired the detailed information in his statement from the gardaí : " Dean Lyons acquired the detailed information in relation to the crimes which is a feature of later interviews , and in particular the third interview , from the gardaí who were interviewing him . " The commission found that : " The written record maintained of the non @-@ video @-@ recorded interviews is not comprehensive and matters are excluded that would have assisted in the assessment of the reliability of Dean Lyons . This is not in accordance with section 12 ( 11 ) ( b ) ( i ) of the Criminal Justice Act ( Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Síochána Stations ) Regulations 1987 . " The report said that Dean Lyons was not abused or ill treated during his detention and that : 
 His admissions were not produced by oppression or coercive conduct on the part of the Gardaí . Neither were the admissions produced as a result of anything in the nature of a bribe or inducement . There was no deliberate attempt to frame Dean Lyons . However , Dean Lyons was able to provide accurate details of murders it is now accepted that he did not commit , due to the manner in which he was interviewed by gardaí . He wished to associate himself with the murders and readily agreed to leading questions which were asked by interviewing gardaí .

 In March 2015 Mark Nash was put on trial for the murders . In April 2015 he was found guilty of the murders and sentenced to life imprisonment .

 = Paul Kagame = 
 Paul Kagame ( / <unk> / ; born 23 October 1957 ) is the sixth and current President of Rwanda having taken office in 2000 when his predecessor , Pasteur Bizimungu , resigned . Kagame previously commanded the rebel force that ended the 1994 Rwandan Genocide . He was considered Rwanda 's de facto leader when he served as Vice President and Minister of Defence from 1994 to 2000 . 
 Kagame was born to a Tutsi family in southern Rwanda . When he was two years old , the Rwandan Revolution ended centuries of Tutsi political dominance ; his family fled to Uganda , where he spent the rest of his childhood . In the 1980s , Kagame fought in Yoweri Museveni 's rebel army , becoming a senior Ugandan army officer after Museveni 's military victories carried him to the Ugandan presidency . Kagame joined the Rwandan Patriotic Front ( RPF ) , which invaded Rwanda in 1990 ; leader Fred Rwigyema died early in the war and Kagame took control . By 1993 , the RPF controlled significant territory in Rwanda and a ceasefire was negotiated . The assassination of Rwandan President Juvénal Habyarimana was the starting point of the genocide , in which Hutu extremists killed an estimated 500 @,@ 000 to one million Tutsi and moderate Hutu . Kagame resumed the civil war , and ended the genocide with a military victory . 
 During his vice presidency , Kagame controlled the national army and maintained law and order , while other officials began rebuilding the country . Many RPF soldiers carried out retribution killings ; it is disputed whether Kagame organised these , or was powerless to stop them . Hutu refugee camps formed in Zaire and other countries , which were controlled by the genocidaires ( participants in the genocide ) and threatened Rwanda 's security . The RPF indiscriminately attacked the camps in 1996 , forcing many refugees to return home , but insurgents continued to attack Rwanda . The attack on the refugees camps killed an estimated 200 @,@ 000 people . According to the UN Mapping report the attacks could be tantamount to genocide potentially making Paul Kagame a war criminal . As part of the invasion , Kagame sponsored two controversial rebel wars in Zaire . The <unk> and Ugandan @-@ backed rebels won the first war ( 1996 – 97 ) , installing Laurent @-@ Désiré Kabila as president in place of dictator Mobutu and renaming the country as the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) . The second war was launched in 1998 against Kabila , and later his son Joseph , following the DRC government 's expulsion of Rwandan and Ugandan military forces from the country . The war escalated into a continent @-@ wide conflict which lasted until a 2003 peace deal and ceasefire . 
 As president , Kagame has prioritised national development , launching a programme to develop Rwanda as a middle income country by 2020 . As of 2013 , the country is developing strongly on key indicators , including health care and education ; annual growth between 2004 and 2010 averaged 8 % per year . Kagame has had mostly good relations with the East African Community and the United States ; his relations with France were poor until 2009 . Relations with the DRC remain tense despite the 2003 ceasefire ; human rights groups and a leaked United Nations report allege Rwandan support for two insurgencies in the country , a charge Kagame denies . Several countries suspended aid payments in 2012 following these allegations . Kagame is popular in Rwanda and with some foreign observers ; human rights groups accuse him of political repression . He won an election in 2003 , under a new constitution adopted that year , and was elected for a second term in 2010 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Kagame was born on 23 October 1957 , the youngest of six children , in <unk> , Ruanda @-@ Urundi , a village located in the modern Southern Province of Rwanda . His father , <unk> , was a member of the Tutsi ethnic group , from which the royal family had been derived since the eighteenth century or earlier . <unk> had family ties to King Mutara III , but he chose to pursue an independent business career rather than maintain a close connection to the royal court . Kagame 's mother , <unk> <unk> , was also a Tutsi , descended from the family of the last Rwandan queen , Rosalie <unk> . At the time of Kagame 's birth , Rwanda was a United Nations Trust Territory ; long @-@ time colonial power Belgium still ruled the territory , but with a mandate to oversee independence . Rwandans were made up of three distinct groups : the minority Tutsi were the traditional ruling class , and the Belgians had long promoted their supremacy , while the majority Hutu were agriculturalists . The third group , the Twa , were a forest @-@ dwelling pygmy people who are descended from Rwanda 's earliest inhabitants and formed less than 1 % of the population . 
 Tension between Tutsi and Hutu had been escalating during the 1950s , and culminated in the 1959 Rwandan Revolution . Hutu activists began killing Tutsi , forcing more than 100 @,@ 000 to seek refuge in neighbouring countries . Kagame 's family abandoned their home , living for two years in the far northeast of Rwanda and eventually crossing the border into Uganda . They moved gradually north , and settled in the <unk> refugee camp in the Toro sub @-@ region in 1962 . It was around this time that , as young boys , Kagame and his future comrade , Fred Rwigyema , first met one another . 
 Kagame began his primary education in a school near the refugee camp , where he and other Rwandan refugees learned English and began to integrate into Ugandan culture . At the age of nine he moved to the respected <unk> Primary School , around 16 kilometres ( 10 mi ) away , graduating with the best grades in the district . He subsequently attended <unk> School , one of the best schools in Uganda . It is also the alma mater of future Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni . The death of Kagame 's father in the early 1970s , and the departure of Rwigyema to an unknown location , led to a decline in his academic performance and an increased tendency to fight those who belittled the Rwandan population . He was eventually suspended from <unk> and completed his studies without distinction at Old Kampala Secondary School . 
 After finishing his schooling Kagame made two visits to Rwanda , in 1977 and 1978 . He was initially hosted by family members of his former classmates , but upon arrival in Kigali he made contact with members of his own family . He kept a low profile on these visits , believing that his status as a well @-@ connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest ; on his second visit he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion . Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country , familiarise himself with the political and social situation , and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities . 
 = = Military career , 1979 – 1994 = = 
 = = = Ugandan Bush War = = = 
 In 1978 , Fred Rwigyema returned to western Uganda and reunited with Kagame . During his absence , Rwigyema had joined the rebel army of Yoweri Museveni . Based in Tanzania , it aimed to overthrow the Ugandan government of Idi Amin . Rwigyema returned to Tanzania and fought in the 1979 war during which Museveni 's army , allied with the Tanzanian army and other Ugandan exiles , defeated Amin . After Amin 's defeat , inspired by Rwigyema , Kagame and other Rwandan refugees pledged allegiance to Museveni , a cabinet member in the transition government . Kagame travelled to Tanzania where the Tanzanian government , which sought to protect the new Ugandan regime , trained him as a spy . 
 Former incumbent Milton Obote won the 1980 Ugandan general election . Museveni disputed the result , and he and his followers withdrew from the new government in protest . In 1981 , Museveni formed the rebel National Resistance Army ( NRA ) ; Kagame and Rwigyema joined as founding soldiers , along with thirty @-@ eight Ugandans . The army 's goal was to overthrow Obote 's government , in what became known as the Ugandan Bush War . 
 Kagame and Rwigyema joined the NRA primarily to ease conditions for Rwandan refugees persecuted by Obote . They also had a long @-@ term goal of returning with other Tutsi refugees to Rwanda ; military experience would enable them to fight the Hutu @-@ dominated Rwandan army . In the NRA , Kagame specialised in intelligence @-@ gathering , and he rose to a position close to Museveni 's . The NRA , based in the <unk> Triangle , fought the Ugandan army for the next five years , even after Obote was deposed in a 1985 coup d 'état and the start of peace talks . 
 In 1986 , the NRA captured Kampala with a force of 14 @,@ 000 soldiers , including 500 Rwandans , and formed a new government . After Museveni 's inauguration as president he appointed Kagame and Rwigyema as senior officers in the new Ugandan army ; Kagame was the head of military intelligence . In addition to their army duties , Kagame and Rwigyema began building a covert network of Rwandan Tutsi refugees within the army 's ranks , intended as the nucleus for an attack on Rwanda . In 1989 Rwanda 's President Habyarimana and many Ugandans in the army began to criticise Museveni over his appointment of Rwandan refugees to senior positions , and he demoted Kagame and Rwigyema . 
 They remained de facto senior officers , but the change caused them to accelerate their plans to invade Rwanda . They joined an organisation called the Rwandan Patriotic Front ( RPF ) , a refugee association which had been operating under various names since 1979 . Rwigyema became the RPF leader shortly after joining and , while still working for the Ugandan army , he and Kagame completed their invasion plans . 
 = = = Rwandan Civil War = = = 
 In October 1990 , Rwigyema led a force of over 4 @,@ 000 RPF rebels into Rwanda at the <unk> border post , advancing 60 km ( 37 mi ) south to the town of <unk> . Paul Kagame was not present at the initial raids , as he was attending a course at the Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth , United States . Rwigyema was killed on the third day of the attack , throwing the RPF into confusion . France and Zaire deployed forces in support of the Rwandan army , and by the end of October , the RPF had been pushed back into the far north east corner of the country . 
 Kagame returned to Africa and took command of the RPF forces , which had been reduced to fewer than 2 @,@ 000 troops . Kagame and his soldiers moved west , through Uganda , to the Virunga Mountains , a rugged high @-@ altitude area where the terrain worked in their favor . From there he re @-@ armed and reorganised the army , and carried out fundraising and recruitment from the Tutsi diaspora . Kagame restarted combat in January 1991 , with an attack on the northern town of Ruhengeri . Benefiting from the element of surprise , the RPF captured the town and held it for a day before retreating back into the forests . 
 For the next year , the RPF waged a classic hit @-@ and @-@ run style guerrilla war , capturing some border areas but not making significant gains in the war against the Rwandan army . Following the June 1992 formation of a multi @-@ party coalition government in Kigali , Kagame announced a ceasefire and initiated negotiations with the Rwandan government in Arusha , Tanzania . In early 1993 groups of extremist Hutu formed and began campaigns of large @-@ scale violence against the Tutsi . Kagame responded by suspending peace talks temporarily and launching a major attack , gaining a large swathe of land across the north of the country . 
 Peace negotiations resumed in Arusha , and the resulting set of agreements , known as the Arusha Accords , were signed in August 1993 . The RPF were given positions in a broad @-@ based transitional government ( <unk> ) and in the national army . The United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda ( UNAMIR ) , a peacekeeping force , arrived and the RPF were given a base in the national parliament building in Kigali to use during the establishment of the <unk> . 
 = = = Rwandan Genocide = = = 
 On 6 April 1994 , Rwandan President Habyarimana 's plane was shot down near Kigali Airport , killing both Habyarimana and the President of Burundi , Cyprien <unk> , as well as their entourage and three French crew members . The attackers remain unknown . Historian Gérard Prunier , in a book written shortly after the incident , concluded that it was most likely a coup d 'état carried out by extreme Hutu members of Habyarimana 's government , and was a planned part of the genocide . This theory was disputed in 2006 by French judge Jean @-@ Louis Bruguière , and in 2008 by Spanish judge Fernando Andreu . Both alleged that Kagame and the RPF were responsible . At the end of 2010 the French government ordered a more thorough judicial inquiry , which employed ballistics experts . That review concluded in 2012 that the shots had originated from Camp <unk> , an area controlled at the time by the Rwandan army ; this report reaffirmed the initial theory that Hutu extremists assassinated Habyarimana . 
 Following Habyarimana 's death , a military committee led by Colonel <unk> <unk> took immediate control of the country . Under the committee 's direction , the Hutu paramilitary group <unk> and the presidential guard began to kill Hutu and Tutsi opposition politicians and other prominent Tutsi figures ; within 24 hours they had killed all moderate leaders , including prime minister Agathe <unk> . The killers then began targeting the entire Tutsi population , as well as moderate Hutu , beginning the Rwandan Genocide . Over the course of approximately 100 days , between 500 @,@ 000 and 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well @-@ planned attacks . 
 On 7 April , Kagame warned the committee and UNAMIR that he would resume the civil war if the killing did not stop . The next day , the Rwandan government forces attacked the national parliament building from several directions , but the RPF troops stationed there successfully fought back ; Kagame began an attack from the north on three fronts , seeking to link up quickly with the troops isolated in Kigali . An interim government was set up but Kagame refused to talk to it , believing that it was just a cover for <unk> 's rule . Over the next few days , the RPF advanced steadily south , capturing <unk> and large areas of countryside to the north and east of Kigali . They avoided attacking Kigali or <unk> at this stage , but conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle the cities and cut off supply routes . The RPF allowed Tutsi refugees from Uganda to settle behind the front line in the RPF @-@ controlled areas . 
 Throughout April there were numerous attempts by UNAMIR to establish a ceasefire , but Kagame insisted each time that the RPF would not stop fighting unless the killings stopped . In late April the RPF secured the whole of the Tanzanian border area and began to move west from <unk> , to the south of Kigali . They encountered little resistance , except around Kigali and Ruhengeri . By 16 May , they had cut the road between Kigali and Gitarama , the temporary home of the interim government , and by 13 June , they had taken Gitarama , following an unsuccessful attempt by the Rwandan government forces to reopen the road . The interim government was forced to relocate to Gisenyi in the far north west . As well as fighting the war , Kagame was recruiting heavily to expand the army . The new recruits included Tutsi survivors of the genocide and refugees from Burundi , but were less well trained and disciplined than the earlier recruits . 
 Having completed the encirclement of Kigali , Kagame spent the latter half of June fighting to take the city . The government forces had superior manpower and weapons , but the RPF steadily gained territory , as well as conducting raids to rescue civilians from behind enemy lines . According to Roméo Dallaire , the force commander of UNAMIR , this success was due to Kagame being a " master of psychological warfare " ; he exploited the fact that the government forces were concentrating on the genocide rather than the fight for Kigali , and capitalised on the government 's loss of morale as it lost territory . The RPF finally defeated the Rwandan government forces in Kigali on 4 July , and on 18 July took Gisenyi and the rest of the north west , forcing the interim government into Zaire and ending the genocide . At the end of July 1994 , Kagame 's forces held the whole of Rwanda except for a zone in the south west , which had been occupied by a French @-@ led United Nations force as part of Opération Turquoise . 
 = = Marriage and children = = 
 On 10 June 1989 in Uganda , Kagame married Jeannette Nyiramongi , a Tutsi exile living in Nairobi , Kenya . Kagame had asked his relatives to suggest a suitable marriage and they recommended Nyiramongi . Kagame travelled to Nairobi and introduced himself , persuading her to visit him in Uganda . Nyiramongi was familiar with the RPF , and its goal of returning refugees to Rwanda . She held Kagame in high regard . The couple have four children . Their first child , a son they named Ivan <unk> Kagame , was born in 1990 . Since then a daughter , Ange Kagame , and sons Ian and Brian have been born .

 The post @-@ genocide Rwandan government took office in Kigali in July 1994 . It was based loosely on the Arusha Accords , but Habyarimana 's party was outlawed . The positions it had been assigned were taken over by the RPF . The military wing of the RPF was renamed as the Rwandan Patriotic Army ( RPA ) , and became the national army . Paul Kagame assumed the dual roles of Vice President of Rwanda and Minister of Defence while Pasteur Bizimungu , a Hutu who had been a civil servant under Habyarimana before fleeing to join the RPF , was appointed president . Bizimungu and his cabinet had some control over domestic affairs , but Kagame remained commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army and was the de facto ruler of the country . 
 = = = Domestic situation = = = 
 The infrastructure and economy of the country had suffered greatly during the genocide . Many buildings were uninhabitable , and the former regime had carried with them all currency and moveable assets when they fled the country . Human resources were also severely depleted , with over 40 % of the population having been killed or fled . Many of the remainder were traumatised : most had lost relatives , witnessed killings or participated in the genocide . The army , controlled by Kagame , maintained law and order while the government began the work of rebuilding the country 's structures . 
 Non @-@ governmental organisations began to move back into the country , but the international community did not provide significant assistance to the new regime , and most international aid was routed to the refugee camps which had formed in Zaire following the exodus of Hutu from Rwanda . Kagame strove to portray the government as inclusive and not Tutsi dominated . He directed removal of ethnicity from citizens ' national identity cards , and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions between Hutu , Tutsi , and Twa . 
 During the genocide and in the months following the RPF victory , RPF soldiers killed many people they accused of participating in or supporting the genocide . Many of these soldiers were recent Tutsi recruits from within Rwanda , who had lost family or friends and sought revenge . The scale , scope , and source of ultimate responsibility of these killings is disputed . Human Rights Watch , as well as scholars such as Prunier , allege that the death toll might be as high as 100 @,@ 000 , and that Kagame and the RPF elite either tolerated or organised the killings . In an interview with journalist Stephen Kinzer , Kagame acknowledged that killings had occurred but stated that they were carried out by rogue soldiers and had been impossible to control . The RPF killings gained international attention with the 1995 Kibeho massacre , in which soldiers opened fire on a camp for internally displaced persons in Butare Province . Australian soldiers serving as part of UNAMIR estimated at least 4 @,@ 000 people were killed , while the Rwandan government claimed that the death toll was 338 . 
 Shortly after taking power , the Rwandan government began prosecuting crimes committed during the genocide . The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda , operating under a United Nations mandate , was set up in Arusha to judge the most senior leaders responsible for the genocide . In addition , the Rwandan government determined to prosecute all suspected perpetrators , including the many ordinary citizens who had taken part in the killings , in order to end the " culture of impunity " that it blamed for the genocide . Between 1994 and 2000 , 120 @,@ 000 suspects were arrested . The prisons were overcrowded and the courts could not process all the cases . By 2006 only 10 @,@ 000 of those arrested had been tried . The government introduced Gacaca , a village court system based on traditional Rwandan justice . The Gacaca process allowed for faster processing of cases , but lacked many safeguards and principles of international criminal law . 
 The unity government suffered a partial collapse in 1995 . The continuing violence , along with appointing of local government officials who were almost exclusively RPF Tutsi , caused serious disagreement between Kagame and senior Hutu government members , including prime minister Faustin Twagiramungu and interior minister Seth Sendashonga . Twagiramungu resigned in August , and Kagame fired Sendashonga and three others the next day . Pasteur Bizimungu remained president but the makeup of the new government was predominantly RPF Tutsi loyal to Kagame . Twagiramungu and Sendashonga moved abroad to form a new opposition party shortly after leaving the government . 
 = = = Refugee crisis and insurgency = = = 
 Following the RPF victory , approximately two million Hutu fled to refugee camps in neighbouring countries , particularly Zaire , fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan Genocide . The camps were set up by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime , including many leaders of the genocide . This regime was determined to return to power in Rwanda and began rearming , killing Tutsi residing in Zaire , and launching cross @-@ border incursions in conjunction with the <unk> paramilitary group . By late 1996 , the Hutu militants represented a serious threat to the new Rwandan regime , and Kagame launched a counteroffensive . 
 Kagame first provided troops and military training to aid a rebellion against Zaire by the Banyamulenge , a Tutsi group living near Bukavu in the Zairian South Kivu province . With Rwandan army support , the Banyamulenge defeated local security forces and began attacking the Hutu refugee camps in the area . At the same time , Kagame 's forces joined with Zairian Tutsi around Goma to attack two of the camps there . Most refugees from the attacked camps moved to the large <unk> camp . In November 1996 the Rwandan army attacked <unk> , causing an estimated 800 @,@ 000 refugees to flee . Many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF ; others ventured further west into Zaire . 
 Despite the disbanding of the camps , the defeated forces of the former regime continued a cross @-@ border insurgency campaign into Rwanda from North Kivu . The insurgents maintained a presence in Rwanda 's north western provinces and were supported by the predominantly Hutu population , many of whom had lived in the refugee camps before they were attacked . In addition to supporting the wars in the Congo , Kagame began a propaganda campaign to bring the Hutu to his side . He integrated former soldiers of the deposed genocidal regime 's military into the RPF @-@ dominated national army and appointed senior Hutu to key local government positions in the areas hit by insurgency . These tactics were eventually successful ; by 1999 , the population in the north west had stopped supporting the insurgency and the insurgents were mostly defeated . 
 = = = Congo Wars = = = 
 Although his primary reason for military action in Zaire was the dismantling of the refugee camps , Kagame also began planning a war to remove long @-@ time dictator President Mobutu Sese Seko from power . Mobutu had supported the genocidaires based in the camps , and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire . Together with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni , Kagame supported the newly created Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo ( ADFL ) , an alliance of four rebel groups headed by Laurent @-@ Désiré Kabila , which began waging the First Congo War . The ADFL , helped by Rwandan and Ugandan troops , took control of North and South Kivu provinces in November 1996 and then advanced west , gaining territory from the poorly organised and <unk> Zairian army with little fighting . By May 1997 , they controlled almost the whole of Zaire except for the capital Kinshasa ; Mobutu fled and the ADFL took the capital without fighting . The country was renamed as the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) and Kabila became the new president . The Rwandan Defence Forces and the ADFL were accused of carrying out mass atrocities during the First Congo War , with as many as 222 @,@ 000 Rwandan Hutu refugees declared missing . 
 Kagame and the Rwandan government retained strong influence over Kabila following his inauguration , and the RPA maintained a heavy presence in Kinshasa . Congolese in the capital resented this , as did many in the eastern Kivu provinces , where ethnic clashes increased sharply . In July 1998 , Kabila fired his Rwandan chief @-@ of @-@ staff , James Kabarebe , and ordered all RPA troops to leave the country . Kagame accused Kabila of supporting the ongoing insurgency against Rwanda from North Kivu , the same accusation he had made about Mobutu . He responded to the expulsion of his soldiers by backing a new rebel group , the Rally for Congolese Democracy ( RCD ) , and launching the Second Congo War . The first action of the war was a blitzkrieg by the RCD and RPA , led by Kabarebe . These forces made quick gains , advancing in twelve days from the Kivu provinces west to within 130 kilometres ( 81 mi ) of Kinshasa . The capital was saved by the intervention of Angola and Zimbabwe on Kabila 's side . Following the failure of the blitzkrieg , the conflict developed into a long @-@ term conventional war , which lasted until 2003 and caused millions of deaths and massive damage . According to a report by the International Rescue Committee ( IRC ) , this conflict led to the loss of between 3 million and 7 @.@ 6 million lives , many through starvation and disease accompanying the social disruption of the war . 
 Although Kagame 's primary reason for the two wars in the Congo was Rwanda 's security , he was alleged to gain economic benefit by exploiting the mineral wealth of the eastern Congo . The 2001 United Nations Report of the Panel of Experts on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources and Other Forms of Wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo alleged that Kagame , along with Ugandan President Museveni , were " on the verge of becoming the godfathers of the illegal exploitation of natural resources and the continuation of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo " . The report also claimed that the Rwandan Ministry of Defence contained a " Congo Desk " dedicated to collecting taxes from companies licensed to mine minerals around Kisangani , and that substantial quantities of coltan and diamonds passed through Kigali before being resold on the international market by staff on the Congo Desk . International NGO Global Witness also conducted field studies in early 2013 . It concluded that minerals from North and South Kivu are exported illegally to Rwanda and then marketed as Rwandan . Kagame dismissed these allegations as unsubstantiated and politically motivated ; in a 2002 interview with newsletter Africa Confidential , Kagame said that if solid evidence against Rwandan officers was presented , it would be dealt with very seriously . In 2010 , the United Nations released a report accusing the Rwandan army of committing wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the First and Second Congo Wars , charges denied by the Rwandan government . 
 = = Presidency = = 
 = = = Accession = = = 
 In the late 1990s , Kagame began to disagree publicly with Bizimungu and the Hutu @-@ led government in Rwanda . Kagame accused Bizimungu of corruption and poor management , while Bizimungu felt that he had no power over appointments to the cabinet and that the National Assembly was acting purely as a puppet for Kagame . Bizimungu resigned from the presidency in March 2000 . Historians do not agree on the precise circumstances of Bizimungu 's departure ; American author Stephen Kinzer contends that " one of the president 's friends called Kagame with the startling news that the president was preparing to resign " while Prunier states that Bizimungu was forced to resign , having denounced the National Assembly and attempted to sow discord within the RPF . Following Bizimungu 's resignation , the Supreme Court ruled that Kagame should become acting president until a permanent successor was chosen . 
 Kagame had been de facto leader since 1994 , but had focused more on military , foreign affairs and the country 's security than day @-@ to @-@ day governance . By 2000 , the threat posed by cross @-@ border rebels was much reduced and when Bizimungu resigned , Kagame decided to seek the presidency himself . The transitional constitution was still in effect , which meant the president was elected by government ministers and the national assembly rather than by a direct election . 
 The RPF selected two candidates , Kagame and RPF secretary general Charles <unk> ; the ministers and parliament elected Kagame by eighty @-@ one votes to three . Kagame was sworn in as president in April 2000 . Several Hutu politicians , including the prime minister Pierre @-@ Célestin <unk> , left the government at around the same time as Bizimungu , leaving a cabinet dominated by those close to Kagame . Bizimungu started his own party following his resignation , but this was quickly banned for " destabilising the country " . He was subsequently arrested and convicted of corruption and inciting ethnic violence . He was imprisoned until 2007 , when he was pardoned by Kagame . 
 = = = New constitution = = = 
 Between 1994 and 2003 , Rwanda was governed by a set of documents combining President Habyarimana 's 1991 constitution , the Arusha Accords , and some additional protocols introduced by the transitional government . As required by the accords , Kagame set up a constitutional commission to draft a new permanent constitution . The constitution was required to adhere to a set of fundamental principles including equitable power sharing and democracy . The commission sought to ensure that the draft constitution was " home @-@ grown " , relevant to Rwanda 's specific needs , and reflected the views of the entire population ; they sent questionnaires to civil groups across the country and rejected offers of help from the international community , except for financial assistance . 
 The draft constitution was released in 2003 ; it was approved by the parliament , and was then put to a referendum in May of that year . The referendum was widely promoted by the government ; ultimately , 95 % of eligible adults registered to vote and the turnout on voting day was 87 % . The constitution was overwhelmingly accepted , with 93 % voting in favour . The constitution provided for a two @-@ house parliament , an elected president serving seven @-@ year terms , and multi @-@ party politics . The constitution also sought to prevent Hutu or Tutsi hegemony over political power . Article 54 states that " political organizations are prohibited from basing themselves on race , ethnic group , tribe , clan , region , sex , religion or any other division which may give rise to discrimination " . According to Human Rights Watch , this clause , along with later laws enacted by the parliament , effectively make Rwanda a one @-@ party state , as " under the guise of preventing another genocide , the government displays a marked intolerance of the most basic forms of dissent " . 
 = = = Election campaigns = = = 
 = = = = Presidential election , 2003 = = = = 
 Following the adoption of the new constitution in May 2003 , the government set dates for the first elections to be held under the new law . The presidential poll was set for 25 August 2003 . In May , the parliament voted to ban the Republican Democratic Movement ( MDR ) , following a parliamentary commission report accusing the MDR of " divisive " ideology . The MDR had been one of the coalition parties in the transitional government of national unity , and was the second largest party in the country after the RPF . Amnesty International criticised this move , claiming that " the unfounded allegations against the individuals mentioned in the report appear to be part of a government @-@ orchestrated crackdown on the political opposition " . 
 The RPF selected Paul Kagame as its presidential candidate , to run for his first full term following his three @-@ year transitional presidency . His main challenger was Faustin Twagiramungu , who had been prime minister from 1994 to 1995 , when he resigned and moved to Brussels after a disagreement with Kagame . Twagiramungu had intended to run as the candidate for the MDR , but instead sought the presidency as an independent following the party 's banishment . Twagiramungu returned to the country in June 2003 and began campaigning in August . Two other candidates also ran : <unk> Mukabaramba , a medical doctor and former MDR member running for the newly formed Party for Progress and Concord ( PPC ) , and Jean <unk> Nayinzira , an independent and former member of parliament who cited belief in God as a central part of his campaign . Mukabaramba pulled out one day before the election , accusing Twagiramungu of ethnic propaganda and advising her supporters to vote for Kagame . The election went ahead on 25 August with Kagame , Twagiramungu and Nayinzira as candidates . 
 Kagame declared victory in the election on 26 August , after partial results showed he had an almost insurmountable lead , and his win was later confirmed by the National Electoral Commission . The final results showed that Kagame received 95 @.@ 1 % of the vote , Twagiramungu 3 @.@ 6 % , and Nayinzira 1 @.@ 3 % ; the voter turnout was 96 @.@ 6 % . The campaign , election day , and aftermath were largely peaceful , although an observer from the European Union ( EU ) raised concerns that opposition supporters may have been intimidated by the RPF . Twagiramungu rejected the result of the election and also questioned the margin of victory , saying " Almost 100 per cent ? That 's not possible " . Twagiramungu filed a petition at the Supreme Court to nullify the result , but was unsuccessful . The EU observer also questioned the result , citing " numerous irregularities " , but praised the election overall , describing it as a " positive step " . Kagame himself , in an interview with journalist Stephen Kinzer , acknowledged that the opposition had been weak , but he believed the result was genuine . He told Kinzer " they wanted security first of all . Even people who didn 't know the RPF program in detail saw us as the party that would guarantee that " . Kagame was sworn in on 12 September to begin his seven @-@ year term . 
 = = = = Presidential election , 2010 = = = = 
 Kagame 's first term expired and new elections were held in 2010 . Having served one term as elected president , Kagame was entitled to serve for one further term . The election campaign began publicly in January 2010 when Victoire <unk> , a Hutu who had been living abroad for some years , returned to Rwanda and announced her candidacy for the presidency . This failed as she was arrested and accused of threatening state security . <unk> caused some controversy in the country following her arrival , with comments relating to the genocide . The government accused her of breaking the country 's strict laws regarding genocide denial , and she was arrested in April 2010 . She was released on bail , but was prohibited from running in the election . In October 2012 she was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment by the High Court of Kigali , which is heavily criticized by Amnesty International . 
 In May , President Kagame was officially endorsed as the RPF 's candidate for the election at the party 's national congress . Kagame then became the first candidate to be accepted when he presented his electoral papers in July . Three other candidates registered successfully for the election ; they were Jean Damascene <unk> of the Social Democratic Party , Prosper <unk> of the Liberal Party , and <unk> Mukabaramba of the Party for Progress and Concord . Two other contenders failed to get official documents through and did not get accepted into the race . Human Rights Watch described Kagame 's three opponents as " broadly supportive of the RPF " , and claimed that most Rwandans would not describe them as " real " opposition , while those who criticised the RPF were barred from the election . 
 In the run @-@ up to the election , there was some violence and several incidents involving prominent opposition and media figures . In February , there was a grenade attack in Kigali which killed two people . Rwandan prosecutors blamed <unk> <unk> , a dissident General who had become a critic of Kagame . <unk> fled to Johannesburg , South Africa , and in June he survived a shooting in the city . <unk> alleged that it was an assassination attempt , a charge Rwanda denied . Days later , journalist Jean @-@ Léonard <unk> , who claimed to have uncovered the regime 's responsibility in the attempted murder , was shot dead . In July , the vice president of the Democratic Green Party , André <unk> <unk> , was beheaded in Butare . There is no concrete evidence linking Kagame with the attacks , but it was sufficient for the United Nations to demand an investigation . 
 Kagame was declared the winner of the election , according to results released by the National Electoral Commission on 11 August . Kagame received 93 @.@ 08 % of the vote , with second placed <unk> polling 5 @.@ 15 % . The turnout was 97 @.@ 51 % of registered voters . Opposition and human rights groups later said that the election was tainted by repression , murder , and lack of credible competition . Kagame responded by saying " I see no problems , but there are some people who choose to see problems where there are not . " The election was largely peaceful , although there was a further grenade attack in Kigali hours after the election commission announced Kagame 's victory , injuring about 20 people . Media reports indicated the attack may have been politically motivated and connected to earlier attacks in the same area .

 = = = = Vision 2020 = = = = 
 In the late 1990s , Kagame began actively planning methods to achieve national development . He launched a national consultation process and also sought the advice of experts from emerging nations including China , Singapore and Thailand . Following these consultations , and shortly after assuming the presidency , Kagame launched an ambitious programme of national development called Vision 2020 . The major purposes of the programme were to unite the Rwandan people and to transform Rwanda from a highly impoverished into a middle income country . The programme consists of a list of goals which the government aims to achieve before the year 2020 . These include reconstruction , infrastructure and transport improvements , good governance , improving agriculture production , private sector development , and health and education improvements . 
 In 2011 , the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning issued a report indicating the progress of the Vision 2020 goals . The report examined the stated goals of the programme and rated each one with a status of " on @-@ track " , " on @-@ watch " or " off @-@ track " . Of 44 goals , it found that 66 % were on @-@ track , 11 % were on @-@ watch , and 22 % were off @-@ track . The major areas identified as off @-@ track were population , poverty and the environment . An independent review of Vision 2020 , carried out in 2012 by academics based in Belgium , rated progress as " quite encouraging " , mentioning development in the education and health sectors , as well as Kagame 's fostering of a favourable business environment . The review also raised concerns about the policy of " maximum growth at any cost " , suggesting that this was leading to a situation in which the rich prospered while the rural poor saw little benefit . 
 In November 2013 , Kagame told This Is Africa " Our thinking is based on people . In national budgets , we focus on education , health , we look at technology , skills , innovation , creativity . We are always thinking about people , people , people . " 
 = = = = Economy = = = = 
 Rwanda 's economy has grown rapidly under Kagame 's presidency , with per @-@ capita gross domestic product ( purchasing power parity ) estimated at $ 1 @,@ 592 in 2013 , compared with $ 567 in 2000 . Annual growth between 2004 and 2010 averaged 8 % per year . Kagame 's economic policy is based on liberalising the economy , privatising state owned industries , reducing red tape for businesses , and transforming the country from an agricultural to a knowledge @-@ based economy . Kagame has stated that he believes Rwanda can emulate the economic development of Singapore since 1960 , and achieving middle income country status is one of the central goals of the Vision 2020 programme . Kagame 's economic policy has been praised by many foreign donors and investors , including Bill Clinton and Starbucks chairman Howard Schultz . The DRC government and human rights groups have accused Rwanda of illegally exploiting Congolese minerals , which the London Daily Telegraph describes as an " important part " in the success of Rwanda 's economy . 
 Rwanda is a country of few natural resources , and the economy is heavily dependent on subsistence agriculture , with an estimated 90 % of the working population engaged in farming . Under Kagame 's presidency , the service sector has grown strongly . In 2010 , it became the country 's largest sector by economic output , contributing 43 @.@ 6 % of the country 's GDP . Key tertiary contributors include banking and finance , wholesale and retail trade , hotels and restaurants , transport , storage , communication , insurance , real estate , business services , and public administration , including education and health . Information and communications technology ( ICT ) is a Vision 2020 priority , with a goal of transforming Rwanda into an ICT hub for Africa . To this end , the government has completed a 2 @,@ 300 kilometres ( 1 @,@ 400 mi ) fibre @-@ optic telecommunications network , intended to provide broadband services and facilitate electronic commerce . Tourism is one of the fastest @-@ growing economic resources and became the country 's leading foreign exchange earner in 2011 . In spite of the genocide 's legacy , Kagame 's achievement of peace and security means the country is increasingly perceived internationally as a safe destination ; in the first half of 2011 , 16 % of foreign visitors arrived from outside Africa . The country 's mountain gorillas attract thousands of visitors per year , who are prepared to pay high prices for permits . 
 Rwanda ranks highly in several categories of the World Bank 's ease of doing business index . In 2005 , after the country was ranked 158th on the ease of doing business index , Kagame set up a special unit to analyze the economy and provide solutions to easing business . As a result , the country topped the list of reformers in 2009 . In 2012 , the country 's overall ease of doing business index ranking was 52nd out of 185 countries worldwide , and third out of 46 in Sub @-@ Saharan Africa . It was eighth on the 2012 rankings for ease of starting a business ; the Rwanda Development Board asserts that a business can be authorised and registered in 24 hours . The business environment and economy also benefit from relatively low corruption in the country ; in 2010 , Transparency International ranked Rwanda as the eighth cleanest out of 47 countries in Sub @-@ Saharan Africa and sixty @-@ sixth cleanest out of 178 in the world . 
 = = = = Education and health = = = = 
 Kagame has made education for youth in Rwanda a high priority for his administration , allocating 17 % of the annual budget to the sector . The Rwandan government provides free education in state @-@ run schools for twelve years : six years in primary and six in secondary school . The final three years of free education were introduced in 2012 following a pledge by Kagame during his 2010 re @-@ election campaign . Kagame credits his government with improvements in the tertiary education sector ; the number of universities has risen from 1 in 1994 to 29 in 2010 , and the tertiary gross enrolment ratio increased from 4 % in 2008 to 7 % in 2011 . From 1994 until 2009 , secondary education was offered in either French or English ; since 2009 , due to the country 's increasing ties with the East African Community and the Commonwealth of Nations , English has been the sole language of instruction in public schools from primary school grade 4 onward . The country 's literacy rate , defined as those aged 15 or over who can read and write , was 71 % in 2009 , up from 38 % in 1978 and 58 % in 1991 . 
 Rwanda 's health profile is dominated by communicable diseases , including malaria , pneumonia , and HIV / AIDS . Prevalence and mortality rates have sharply declined in the past decade but the short supply or unavailability of certain medicines continues to challenge disease management . Kagame 's government is seeking to improve this situation as one of the Vision 2020 priorities . It has increased funding , with the health budget up from 3 @.@ 2 % of national expenditure in 1996 to 9 @.@ 7 % in 2008 . It also set up training institutes , including the Kigali Health Institute ( <unk> ) , and in 2008 effected laws making health insurance mandatory for all individuals ; by 2010 , over 90 % of the population was covered . These policies have contributed to a steady increase in quality of healthcare and improvement in key indicators during Kagame 's presidency . In 2010 , 91 children died before their fifth birthday for every 1000 live births , down from 163 under five deaths for every 1000 live births in 1990 . Prevalence of some diseases is declining , including the elimination of maternal and neonatal tetanus and a sharp reduction in malaria morbidity , mortality rate , and specific lethality . In response to shortages in qualified medical personnel , in 2011 the Rwandan government launched an eight @-@ year US $ 151 @.@ 8 million initiative to train medical professionals .

 The Second Congo War , which began in 1998 , was still raging when Kagame assumed the presidency in 2000 . Namibia , Angola , Zimbabwe , and Chad had committed troops to the Congolese government side , while Rwanda , Uganda , and Burundi were supporting rebel groups . The rebel group Rally for Congolese Democracy ( RCD ) had split in 1999 into two factions : the RCD @-@ Goma , supported by Rwanda , and the RCD @-@ Kisangani , which was allied to Uganda . Uganda also supported the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo ( MLC ) , a rebel group from the north . All these rebel groups were at war with Kabila 's government in Kinshasa , but were also increasingly hostile to each other . Various peace meetings had been held , culminating in the July 1999 Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement which was signed by Kabila , Kagame and all the other foreign governments . The rebel groups were not party to the agreement , and fighting continued . The RPA continued to be heavily involved in the Congo War during 2000 , fighting battles against the Ugandan army in Kisangani and against Kabila 's army in Kasai and Katanga . 
 In January 2001 , Kabila was shot dead inside his palace . The Congolese government claimed Kabila had been killed by a rogue bodyguard , who was himself killed at the scene . According to a report published in French newspaper Le Monde , Kabila was killed by the kadogo , an army of child soldiers he was known to have assembled during the First Congo War . The kadogo had suffered badly during the battles in Kasai and Katanga , were poorly paid , and had become alienated by Kabila . Kabila 's son Joseph was appointed president and immediately began asserting his authority by dismissing his father 's cabinet and senior army commanders , assembling a new government , and engaging with the international community . The new government provided impetus for renewed peace negotiations , and in July 2002 a peace agreement was reached between Rwanda , Congo , and the other major participants , in which all foreign troops would withdraw and RCD @-@ Goma would enter a power @-@ sharing transitional government with Joseph Kabila as interim president until elections could be held . By the end of 2002 , all uniformed Rwandan troops had left Congolese territory . 
 Despite the agreement and subsequent ceasefire , relations between Kagame and the Congolese government have remained tense . A 2003 United Nations report alleged that Rwanda was using demobilised soldiers to continue its illegal exploitation of Congolese minerals . Meanwhile , Kagame blamed Kabila for failing to suppress Hutu rebels in North and South Kivu provinces . Two major insurgencies have occurred in the eastern provinces : the first , from 2005 to 2009 , was led by Congolese Tutsi Laurent Nkunda , while the second , carried out by the March 23 Movement ( M23 ) under leader Bosco <unk> , began in 2012 ; <unk> gave himself up to the International Criminal Court in early 2013 , and peace talks have taken place , but as of May 2013 the conflict is at risk of resuming . Human Rights Watch alleges that both insurgencies were supported by Rwanda , a charge Kagame denies . A leaked United Nations report in 2012 also alleges Rwandan support for M23 ; this report cites Kagame 's defence minister James Kabarebe as being effectively the commander of the movement .

 Kagame spent most of his childhood and young adult years living in Uganda , and has a personal relationship with President Yoweri Museveni dating back to the late 1970s ; they fought together in the Ugandan Bush War , and Kagame was appointed head of military intelligence in Museveni 's national army following the NRA victory in 1986 . When the RPF soldiers abandoned the Ugandan army and invaded Rwanda in 1990 , Museveni did not explicitly support them , but according to Prunier it is likely that he had prior knowledge of the plan . Museveni also allowed the RPF safe passage through Ugandan territory to the Virunga mountains after their early defeats in the war , and revealed in a 1998 heads of state meeting that Uganda had helped the RPF materially during the Rwandan Civil War . Following the RPF victory , the two countries enjoyed a close political and trade relationship . 
 Rwanda and Uganda were allies during the First Congo War against Zaire , with both countries being instrumental in the setting up of the <unk> and committing troops to the war . The two nations joined forces again at the beginning of the Second Congo War , but relations soured in late 1998 as Museveni and Kagame had very different priorities in fighting the war . In early 1999 , the RCD rebel group split into two , with Rwanda and Uganda supporting opposing factions , and in August the Rwandan and Ugandan armies battled each other with heavy artillery in the Congolese city of Kisangani . The two sides fought again in Kisangani in May and June 2000 , causing the deaths of 120 soldiers and around 640 Congolese civilians . Relations slowly thawed in the 2000s , and by 2011 the two countries enjoyed a close friendship once more . 
 In 2007 , Rwanda joined the East African Community , an intergovernmental organisation for the East Africa region comprising Uganda , Kenya , Tanzania , Burundi , and Rwanda . The country 's accession required the signing of various agreements with the other members , including a defence intelligence sharing pact , a customs union , and measures to combat drug trafficking . The countries of the Community established a common market in 2011 , and plan further integration , including moves toward political federation and a possible single currency .

 France maintained close ties with President Habyarimana during his years in power , as part of its Françafrique policy . When the RPF launched the Rwandan Civil War in 1990 , Habyarimana was immediately granted assistance from the President of France , François Mitterrand . France sent 600 paratroopers , who effectively ran the government 's response to the invasion and were instrumental in regaining almost all territory the RPF had gained in the first days of the war . France maintained this military presence throughout the war , engaging Kagame 's RPF forces again in February 1993 during the offensive that doubled RPF territory . In the later stages of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide , France launched Opération Turquoise , a United Nations mandated mission to create safe humanitarian areas for protection of displaced persons , refugees , and civilians in danger ; many Rwandans interpreted it as a mission to protect Hutu from the RPF , including some who had participated in the genocide . The French remained hostile to the RPF , and their presence temporarily stalled Kagame 's advance in south western Rwanda . 
 France continued to shun the new RPF government following the end of the genocide and the withdrawal of Opération Turquoise . Diplomatic relations were finally reestablished in January 1995 , but remained tense as Rwanda accused France of aiding the genocidaires , while France defended its interventions . In 2006 , French judge Jean @-@ Louis Bruguière released a report on the assassination of President Habyarimana which concluded that Kagame had ordered the shooting of the plane . Bruguière subsequently issued arrest warrants for nine of Kagame 's close aides . Kagame denied the charges and immediately broke off diplomatic relations with France . Relations began to thaw in 2008 , and diplomacy was resumed in late 2009 . In 2010 , Nicolas Sarkozy became the first French president to visit Rwanda since the genocide , admitting for the first time that France made " grave errors of judgment " . Kagame reciprocated with an official visit to Paris in 2011 . 
 = = = = United States , United Kingdom and the Commonwealth = = = = 
 Since the end of the Rwandan Genocide in 1994 , Rwanda has enjoyed a close relationship with the English speaking world , in particular the United States ( US ) and United Kingdom ( UK ) . The two countries have been highly supportive of the RPF programme of stabilisation and rebuilding , with the UK donating large sums each year in budget support , and the US providing military aid as well as supporting development projects . As president , Kagame has been critical of the West 's lack of response to the genocide , and the UK and US have responded by admitting guilt over the issue : Bill Clinton , who was President of the United States during the genocide , has described his failure to act against the killings as a " personal failure " . During the 2000s , Clinton and UK prime minister Tony Blair praised the country 's progress under Kagame , citing it as a model recipient for international development funds , and Clinton referred to Kagame as " one of the greatest leaders of our time " . Both Clinton and Blair have maintained support for the country beyond the end of their terms of office , Clinton via the Clinton Global Initiative and Blair through his role as an unpaid advisor to the Rwandan government . 
 As part of his policy of maintaining close relations with English speaking countries , Kagame sought membership of the Commonwealth of Nations , which was granted in 2009 . Rwanda was only the second country , after Mozambique , to join the Commonwealth having never had colonial links to the British Empire . Kagame attended the subsequent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth , Australia , addressing the Business Forum . Rwanda also successfully applied for a rotating seat on the United Nations Security Council in 2012 , taking over the presidency of that organisation in April 2013 . 
 Kagame 's relations with the US and UK have come under strain in the early 2010s , following allegations that Rwanda is supporting the M23 rebel movement in Eastern Congo . The UK suspended its budgetary aid programme in 2012 , freezing a £ 21 million donation . The US has also frozen some of its military aid programme for Rwanda , although it stopped short of suspending aid altogether . 
 = = = = China and moves toward self @-@ sufficiency = = = = 
 China has been investing in Rwandan infrastructure since 1971 , with early projects including hospitals in <unk> and <unk> . Under Kagame 's presidency , trade between the two countries has grown rapidly . The volume of trade increased five @-@ fold between 2005 and 2009 , and it doubled again in the following three years , being worth US $ 160 million in 2012 . Projects completed include the renovation of the Kigali road network , funded using a Chinese government loan and undertaken by China Road and Bridge Corporation ; the Kigali City Tower , which was built by China Civil Engineering Construction ; and a pay television service operated by Star Media . 
 Kagame has been vocal in his praise of China and its model for relations with Africa , saying in a 2009 interview that " the Chinese bring what Africa needs : investment and money for governments and companies . " This is in contrast to Western countries , whom Kagame accuses of focussing too heavily on giving aid to the continent rather than building a trading relationship ; he also believes that they keep African products out of the world marketplace by the use of high tariffs . China does not involve itself in the domestic affairs of the countries with which it trades , hence has not followed the West in criticising Kagame 's alleged involvement in the war in the Congo . 
 Kagame 's ultimate goal in international relations is to shift Rwanda from a country dependent on donor aid and loans towards self @-@ sufficiency , trading with other countries on an equal footing . In a 2009 article , Kagame wrote that " the primary purpose of aid should ultimately be to work itself out " , and should therefore focus on self @-@ sufficiency and building private sector development . Kagame cited an example of donor countries providing free fertilisers to farmers ; he believes this to be wrong because it undercuts local fertiliser businesses , preventing them from growing and becoming competitive . In 2012 , Kagame launched the <unk> Development Fund , following proposals made at a national dialogue session in 2011 . <unk> is a solidarity fund whose goal is to provide development finance sourced within Rwanda , supplementing aid already received from overseas . The fund invites contributions from Rwandan citizens , within the country and in the diaspora , as well as private companies and " friends of Rwanda " . The fund will allocate its funds based on consultations with the populace , as well as financing projects contributing to the Vision 2020 programme . 
 = = Personality and public image = = 
 Most observers describe Kagame 's personality as one of seriousness and intelligence . Richard Grant , writing in London 's Daily Telegraph , described Kagame as radiating " a quality of intense seriousness that is both impressive and intimidating " . Roméo Dallaire , commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda during the Rwandan Genocide , described Kagame as having a " studious air that didn 't quite disguise his hawk @-@ like intensity " . Kagame has a highly dominant personality , which he uses to enforce his rule and to ensure that his vision for the country is followed . American journalist Stephen Kinzer , who wrote the biography A Thousand Hills in collaboration with Kagame himself , describes him as " one of the most intriguing leaders in Africa " . Kinzer credits Kagame with leadership skills that have fostered Rwanda 's rebirth following the genocide , but also cites a personality of " chronic impatience , barely suppressed anger , and impulsive scorn for critics " . In his interview with Grant , Kagame claimed he sleeps for only four hours per night , devoting the remainder of his day to work , exercise , family , and reading academic texts and foreign newspapers . 
 In Rwanda , Kagame 's RPF is seen as a Tutsi @-@ dominated party , and in the years following the 1994 genocide , it was deeply unpopular with the Hutu , who constitute 85 % of the population . Approximately two million Hutu lived as refugees in neighbouring countries until 1996 , when Kagame forced them to return home . Many Hutu also supported the late 1990s cross @-@ border insurgency against Kagame by defeated forces of the former regime . By 1999 , when the RPF had weakened the insurgents and the north west became peaceful , the Hutu population became broadly supportive of Kagame . Since becoming president in 2000 , Kagame has won two disputed presidential elections with over 90 % of the vote each time . Despite criticisms over opposition repression during these elections , and accusations that the figures were inflated , Kagame does receive genuine support from the population , who credit him with ensuring continued peace , stability , and economic growth . 
 Kagame 's image amongst international observers is varied . Human rights organisations , including Amnesty International and Freedom House , claim that Kagame hamstrings his opposition by restricting candidacies in elections to government @-@ friendly parties , suppressing demonstrations , and arresting opposition leaders and journalists . Human Rights Watch and Freedom House have accused Kagame of using strict laws criminalising " <unk> " ( ethnic hatred ) and genocide ideology to silence his critics , to the point that Rwanda is a de facto one @-@ party state . It has praised some aspects of Kagame 's rule , such as the progress made in the delivery of justice and the abolition of the death penalty . Other progressive initiatives include supporting a UN declaration on LGBT rights , as well as the world 's highest representation of women in parliament . Kagame 's image amongst foreign leaders was very positive until the late 2000s . He was credited with ending the genocide , bringing peace and security to Rwanda , and achieving development . Since 2010 , the international community has increasingly criticised Kagame following a leaked United Nations report alleging Rwanda 's support for the rebel M23 movement in Congo . In 2012 , the United Kingdom , Germany , the Netherlands and several other countries suspended programmes of budget support to Rwanda , with many redirecting their aid to project @-@ based assistance . 
 Kagame promotes the Internet as a means of communication between leadership and ordinary people . In addition to his personal website , which contains a personal blog , he has accounts on Flickr , YouTube , Facebook and Twitter . In 2011 , he argued with British journalist Ian Birrell on Twitter following a tweet by Birrell about media freedom in Rwanda . 
 Kagame has received many honours and accolades during his presidency . These include honorary degrees from the American University of the Pacific , Oklahoma Christian University , and the University of Glasgow , the Andrew Young Medal for Capitalism and Social Progress by Georgia State University , and a Clinton Global Citizen Award . Kagame has also received the highest awards bestowed by the countries of Liberia and Benin , the Distinction of the Grand Cordon in the Most Venerable Order of the Knighthood of Pioneers , and the Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit respectively . In September 2010 , the British magazine New Statesman named Kagame one of its 50 most influential figures for that year , placing him in 49th place . The Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations football tournament has been named the Kagame <unk> Cup since 2002 , due to Kagame 's sponsorship of the event . 
 Emmanuel <unk> , a close confidant of Kagame and former chief of the National Intelligence and Security Services , has been named in the Panama Papers . 
 = Lockheed C @-@ 130 Hercules in Australian service = 
 The Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) has operated a total of forty @-@ eight Lockheed C @-@ 130 Hercules transport aircraft . The type entered Australian service in December 1958 , when No. 36 Squadron accepted the first of twelve C @-@ 130As , replacing its venerable Douglas C @-@ 47 Dakotas . The acquisition made Australia the first operator of the Hercules after the United States . In 1966 the C @-@ 130As were joined by twelve C @-@ 130Es , which equipped No. 37 Squadron . The C @-@ 130As were replaced by twelve C @-@ 130Hs in 1978 , and the C @-@ 130Es by twelve C @-@ 130J Super Hercules in 1999 . No. 37 Squadron became the RAAF 's sole Hercules operator in 2006 , when No. 36 Squadron transferred its C @-@ 130Hs prior to converting to Boeing C @-@ 17 Globemaster III heavy transports . The C @-@ 130Hs were retired in November 2012 , leaving the C @-@ 130J as the only model in Australian service . 
 The RAAF 's first strategic <unk> , the Hercules has frequently been used to deliver disaster relief in Australia and the Pacific region , as well as to support military deployments overseas . The aircraft saw extensive service during the Vietnam War , transporting troops and cargo to South East Asia and undertaking aeromedical evacuation . Nineteen of the RAAF 's fleet of twenty @-@ four C @-@ 130s took part in relief efforts in 1974 – 75 after Cyclone Tracy struck Darwin . Since then , the Hercules have been involved in humanitarian missions to New Guinea , Ethiopia , Rwanda , Cambodia , Bali , Sumatra , and New Zealand . They have also seen service during the Iranian Revolution in 1979 , the Fijian coups in 1987 , operations in Somalia in 1993 , INTERFET operations in East Timor in 1999 – 2000 , and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq beginning in 2001 . In over fifty years of Australian service , the Hercules have accumulated 800 @,@ 000 flying hours . 
 = = Acquisition = = 
 = = = Initial selection and purchase = = = 
 At the end of World War II , the RAAF 's prime transport aircraft was the twin @-@ engined Douglas C @-@ 47 Dakota . In 1946 , C @-@ 47 operations were concentrated under No. 86 Wing and its three flying squadrons , Nos. 36 , 37 , and 38 , based initially at RAAF Station Schofields , New South Wales . Despite the robustness and versatility of the Dakota , by the early 1950s the Air Force was looking for a replacement with greater cargo capacity and longer range , to better facilitate the deployment and supply of Australian forces . In 1954 , the RAAF embarked on a major re @-@ equipment drive , following a shift in defence funding that favoured the Air Force . The Air Officer Commanding Home Command , Air Vice Marshal Alister Murdoch , led a mission overseas to examine potential new fighter , bomber , transport and training aircraft . 
 Four British transports were considered : the Blackburn Beverley , Bristol <unk> , Bristol 195 and Short PD 16 / 1 . The mission also assessed the American Fairchild C @-@ <unk> Flying Boxcar , Fairchild C @-@ 123 Provider and Lockheed C @-@ 130A Hercules . Of these types , the mission assessed that the Beverly , C @-@ 123 and C @-@ 130 could potentially meet the RAAF 's requirements . Following further consideration of the options after their return to Australia , in early 1955 the members of the mission unanimously recommended that Hercules be procured , as the other two types did not meet some of the most important elements of the requirement . At this time the Australian Government was reluctant to fund any new equipment for the RAAF , and a decision to acquire twelve C @-@ 130s was not made until mid @-@ 1957 . A contract for these aircraft was signed in October that year . The Australian C @-@ 130As were to be similar to those in service with the United States Air Force ( USAF ) , the main difference being the use of TF56 @-@ A @-@ 11 engines in the place of the usual TF56 @-@ A @-@ 1 and TF56 @-@ A @-@ 9s ; these engines provided almost the same amount of power , but were modified to meet Australian fuel requirements . The total cost for the aircraft , initial crew training and support equipment was $ US 36 million ( equivalent to about 16 million Australian pounds ) . 
 The Hercules represented a huge improvement over the C @-@ 47 in payload , range , speed and manoeuvrability , as well as offering cabin pressurisation , short @-@ takeoff @-@ and @-@ landing capability , and bulk loading and despatch via its rear cargo door . The Government expressed concern over the price , at one stage proposing the purchase of only three aircraft , but eventually the Air Force won approval for the twelve that it wanted . Described by the official history of the post @-@ war RAAF as second only to the General Dynamics F @-@ 111C as the " most significant " acquisition by the Air Force , the Hercules gave the Australian military its first strategic airlift capability , which in years to come would provide a " lifeline " for deployments to Malaya , Vietnam , and other parts of South East Asia . Australia was the first country other than the United States to operate the Hercules . The RAAF 's C @-@ 130As were also the last of this variant to be built . 
 RAAF crews began training on the Hercules in the middle of 1958 at Stewart Air Force Base in Nashville , Tennessee . Much of the training took place on a simulator , augmented by approximately fifty hours flying time in the aircraft . To cope with the Hercules ' complexities , the aircrew category of flight engineer , absent from the RAAF since World War II , was reinstated . A new category , that of loadmaster , was also instituted ; airmen performing similar duties on Dakotas had done so on an ad hoc rather than a permanent basis , without a distinct category having been formalised . A specialist crew member was needed to make weight @-@ and @-@ balance calculations and oversee loading and despatch for the Hercules ' 20 @-@ tonne freight capacity ( compared to three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half tonnes in a Dakota ) and for its various cargo @-@ delivery systems . A large hangar previously used to service seaplanes at RAAF Base Rathmines was disassembled and re @-@ erected at RAAF Base Richmond , New South Wales , where the C @-@ 130s would be based . 
 = = = Later models and upgrades = = = 
 A decision to purchase another twelve C @-@ 130s was announced in November 1964 . At this time the C @-@ 130As were being used to supply the Australian forces engaged in the Vietnam War . This task demonstrated that the RAAF had insufficient long @-@ ranged transport aircraft to simultaneously support overseas deployments and meet the force 's domestic requirements in Australia . As a result , the Government decided to order twelve C @-@ 130E Hercules as part of a package of acquisitions for the RAAF and Royal Australian Navy that also included ten Lockheed P @-@ 3 Orion and fourteen Grumman S @-@ 2 Tracker maritime patrol aircraft , as well as twelve Hawker Siddeley HS 748 transports . The 14 @.@ 7 @-@ million @-@ pound contract for the new C @-@ 130s was signed on 9 February 1965 . In contrast to the concerns raised by the government over the cost of purchasing the C @-@ 130As , this expansion of the Hercules force gained ready agreement , due in no small part to the benefits for the armed services , particularly the Australian Army , demonstrated by the first twelve aircraft . The long @-@ serving C @-@ 130As were replaced by new Hercules in the late 1970s ; twelve C @-@ 130Hs were ordered in June 1976 for a cost of $ <unk> million , and deliveries took place between July and October 1978 . 
 The RAAF 's early model Hercules received several repairs and modifications during their service lives . During the early 1960s all of the C @-@ 130As were flown to the United States to receive new wing fuel tanks after the original tanks were affected by corrosion caused by tropical fungi and bacteria . Later that decade these aircraft received new panels on the upper surface of their wings after the original ones were found to be faulty . The C @-@ 130Es were also fitted with strengthened wing centre boxes in the early 1970s after equivalent USAF aircraft were found to be suffering from greater @-@ than @-@ expected wing stress during operations in Vietnam . During 1964 the C @-@ 130As received new doppler navigation systems , and the C @-@ 130Es and Hs were fitted with ring laser gyroscope inertial navigation systems from 1989 . In 1994 , four of No. 36 Squadron 's C @-@ 130Hs were equipped with Electronic Warfare Self Protection packs , including radar and missile warning systems , and counter measures such as chaff and flares . Later in the decade , one of the C @-@ 130Hs was fitted with extensive signals intelligence equipment under the classified " Project <unk> " ; this aircraft was crewed by RAAF and Defence Signals Directorate personnel and its existence was never publicly confirmed by the Government . The modified C @-@ 130H was reported to still be active in the signals intelligence role in 2008 . The C @-@ 130Hs were also among the first Australian military aircraft to be modified to allow aircrew to operate them while wearing night vision goggles . 
 The Australian Government ordered twelve C @-@ 130J Super Hercules in December 1995 and deliveries began during 1999 . As part of the deal negotiated with Lockheed Martin , seven of the RAAF 's C @-@ 130Es were transferred to the company in return for a reduced price on the new aircraft . At the time the order for the twelve C @-@ 130Js was placed , the Government also took out options for a further twenty seven Super Hercules , but these were not taken up ; the options included seven airborne early warning and control and eight aerial refuelling variants , as well as up to eight transports for the Royal New Zealand Air Force . The RAAF was the first operator of this C @-@ 130 variant , which was larger than earlier models and had a crew of only three ( two pilots and a loadmaster ) eliminating the navigator and flight engineer roles employed in earlier models . The aircraft initially suffered from a range of serious mechanical and software problems as well as a shortage of spare parts , and were assessed as " experiencing significant operational shortfalls " in a 2002 Australian National Audit Office report . The Defence Science and Technology Organisation undertook considerable research into the C @-@ 130J design and developed improvements to the aircraft that addressed problems with excessive vibration . The 2009 Defence white paper Defending Australia in the Asia Pacific Century : Force 2030 called for the acquisition of two more C @-@ 130Js to partially replace the H variants . This purchase did not go ahead , as the government instead ordered a fifth Boeing C @-@ 17 Globemaster III . 
 The C @-@ 130Js have been updated since entering service . All of the aircraft were fitted with radar warning receivers by the end of 2012 , and it is planned to equip the Hercules with Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures systems by 2016 . As of 2015 , the Hercules ' communications capabilities were also to be updated by fitting the aircraft with satellite communications equipment and the equipment necessary to allow them to use the Link 16 data exchange network . At this time the C @-@ 130s were also to be fitted with new high @-@ speed airdrop ramps at the rear of their cabin , and will be cleared to drop larger loads . The C @-@ 130J 's operating software has also been upgraded over time , leading to improved performance . The RAAF is participating in the development of further software enhancements . 
 In March 2015 Australian Aviation reported that , as part of the process of developing a new Defence White Paper , the Australian Government was considering purchasing two LC @-@ 130J Hercules fitted with landing skis and other equipment needed to allow the aircraft to operate in Antarctica . If acquired , these aircraft would be used to support the Australian Antarctic Division 's operations following the closure of the Wilkins Runway near Casey Station .

 The RAAF 's twelve C @-@ 130As were picked up by their newly trained Australian pilots from the Lockheed factory at Dobbins Air Force Base , Georgia , and ferried to Australia in three groups between December 1958 and March 1959 . No. 36 Squadron , located at RAAF Base Richmond , became the first unit to operate the new aircraft . Almost immediately they established regular courier services within Australia and to RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaya . These flights primarily involved transporting cargo , as Chief of the Air Staff Frederick Scherger directed in 1959 that the RAAF would continue to rely on chartered civil airliners to move military personnel on the grounds that these aircraft were better suited to the task and in wartime all the C @-@ 130s would be needed to supply troops near the front lines . In February 1960 a Hercules flew the RAAF 's first AIM @-@ 9 Sidewinder missiles from the United States to Butterworth to equip the CAC Sabre fighters based there . Crew training was rigorous , and from mid @-@ 1960 involved the use of a simulator . Only seasoned transport pilots flew the Hercules in its early years of service , generally having undertaken a tour of duty with No. 38 Squadron 's Dakotas . The official history of the post @-@ war Air Force described the Hercules as " probably the biggest step @-@ up in aircraft capabilities " the RAAF had ever received , considering it roughly four times as effective as the Dakota , taking into account the improvements in payload , range , and speed . When No. 78 ( Fighter ) Wing and its two squadrons of CAC Sabres deployed to Butterworth between October 1958 and February 1959 , seven Dakotas were required to ferry the staff and equipment of No. 3 Squadron from Australia to Malaya , compared to two Hercules for No. 77 Squadron . The Hercules were the first turboprop aircraft operated by the RAAF . They were serviced by No. 486 Maintenance Squadron , with deeper maintenance and upgrades carried out by No. 2 Aircraft Depot ( No. 2 AD ) , both units being based at Richmond . The availability of spare parts from the US caused problems early on , grounding one C @-@ 130A for almost a year . 
 No. 36 Squadron commenced parachute trials with the Hercules in September 1960 . Beginning in May 1962 , RAAF forces based at Ubon , Thailand , under SEATO arrangements were supplied by a regular Hercules service . In December that year , the Hercules made their first troop @-@ carrying flights into a combat zone , when one of No. 36 Squadron 's C @-@ 130s joined a Commonwealth airlift from Singapore to Borneo at the commencement of the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia ; similar missions would be undertaken for a further five years . In 1964 , the first two Dassault Mirage III fighters to be assembled in Australia were flown in pieces from France to the Government Aircraft Factory at Avalon , Victoria , by RAAF Hercules . The same year , following the entry into Australian service of the de Havilland Canada DHC @-@ 4 Caribou with No. 38 Squadron , No. 486 Squadron was disbanded and its equipment and staff divided between Nos. 36 and 38 Squadrons . The RAAF 's force of twelve C @-@ 130A Hercules was augmented by twelve C @-@ 130Es commencing in February 1966 . No. 37 Squadron , disbanded in 1948 , was re @-@ formed at Richmond to operate the new models . No. 486 Squadron was also re @-@ formed to provide maintenance for both Hercules squadrons . No. 36 Squadron 's tasking was mainly domestic and tactical in nature , while No. 37 Squadron 's was overseas and strategic , owing to the longer range of its C @-@ 130Es . In May 1967 , three Hercules of No. 37 Squadron supported Operation Fast Caravan , the deployment of 23 Mirages of No. 75 Squadron to Butterworth .

 During the late 1960s , forty @-@ two per cent of Hercules flying hours were devoted to Australian Army operations . The C @-@ 130s undertook long @-@ range missions to support Australian forces fighting in the Vietnam War from 1965 until 1972 . Following the deployment of the 1st Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment to South Vietnam in early 1965 , the RAAF began fortnightly C @-@ 130 flights into the country from June that year . These flights were initially conducted by C @-@ 130As , and carried high @-@ priority cargo and passengers from Richmond to Vung Tau in South Vietnam via either Butterworth or Singapore . The scale of the supply flights into South Vietnam expanded in 1967 when No. 2 Squadron RAAF , which was equipped with English Electric Canberra bombers , was deployed to Phan Rang . A large airlift codenamed Winter Grip was also conducted in mid @-@ 1967 to replace two Australian Army battalions , which had completed their year @-@ long tour of duty , with a pair of fresh battalions . The Hercules were called upon to support the withdrawal of the 1st Australian Task Force ( 1 ATF ) from South Vietnam , and Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons undertook many sorties to fly equipment and personnel out of the country during 1971 . In late 1972 , C @-@ 130s were used to withdraw the last remaining Australian force in South Vietnam , the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam ; the final elements of this force departed aboard two Hercules on 20 December 1972 . 
 As well as transport operations , the Hercules flew many evacuation flights out of Vietnam to transfer wounded or sick personnel to Australia , via Butterworth , for further treatment . These flights were initially conducted as part of the regular courier service , and the patients and RAAF nurses had to endure uncomfortable conditions as the aircraft had only rudimentary facilities for personnel on stretchers . Separate evacuation flights began on 1 July 1966 , and continued at fortnightly intervals until 1972 ; more flights were made during periods in which 1 ATF suffered heavy casualties . Although the operation was generally successful , only C @-@ 130Es were assigned to this task from May 1967 after an article criticising the use of noisy C @-@ 130As to transport wounded personnel was published in The Medical Journal of Australia . The C @-@ 130Es provided much more comfortable conditions and were capable of flying directly between South Vietnam and Australia when required . A total of 3 @,@ 164 patients had been transported to Australia by the time the C @-@ 130 evacuation flights ended in early 1972 . The Hercules also returned the bodies of servicemen killed in Vietnam to Australia . 
 Many of the RAAF 's C @-@ 130s were redeployed to South Vietnam shortly before the end of the war in 1975 . The rapid North Vietnamese advance during the Spring Offensive displaced hundreds of thousands of South Vietnamese civilians , and the Australian Government deployed a detachment of Hercules to Saigon in March 1975 as part of an international aid effort coordinated by the United States . This force , which was designated Detachment S , had an average strength of seven C @-@ 130s and about one hundred air and ground crew and was initially used to transport civilian refugees away from the front lines . After South Vietnamese soldiers were reported to have been transported alongside civilians , Prime Minister Gough Whitlam directed that the Hercules were to only carry humanitarian cargo . As the North Vietnamese advanced on Saigon , Detachment S was moved to Bangkok in Thailand , but continued to fly into South Vietnam each day . Overall , Detachment S had carried 1 @,@ 100 refugees and 900 tonnes of supplies by the end of the war . On 4 and 17 April , aircraft of the detachment flew 271 orphaned children to Bangkok as part of the US @-@ led Operation <unk> . In late April , two of No. 37 Squadron 's C @-@ 130Es were assigned to the United Nations to transport supplies throughout South East Asia ; this force was designated Detachment N. The C @-@ 130Es began operations on 3 May , and were mainly used to fly supplies into Laos . The aircraft transported cargo between Thailand , Butterworth , Hong Kong and Singapore ; by the time this mission ended in early June , the two Hercules had conducted 91 sorties for the UN . Aircraft of Detachment S evacuated Australian embassy personnel from Phnom Penh in Cambodia , as well as Saigon , shortly before they fell to Khmer Rouge and North Vietnamese forces in April 1975 , after which the force returned to Australia .

 In the years after the end of the Vietnam War , the Hercules continued to take part in military exercises and support overseas peacekeeping commitments . They also became well known in the Southern Pacific after being called on for relief following natural disasters , including tidal waves in New Guinea , cyclones in the Solomon Islands and Tonga , and fires and floods in Australia . The Hercules played a significant part in the evacuation of civilians following Cyclone Tracy in 1974 – 75 ; a No. 37 Squadron C @-@ 130E was the first aircraft to touch down in Darwin following the disaster . Eight of No. 36 Squadron 's aircraft were involved in the relief effort , flying over 550 hours , and carrying 2 @,@ 864 passengers and almost 800 @,@ 000 lbs of cargo , while No. 37 Squadron contributed 11 aircraft , flying 700 hours , and carrying 4 @,@ 400 passengers and 1 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 lbs of cargo . On 19 January 1978 a C @-@ 130E returning to Australia from Butterworth was used to intercept a drug @-@ smuggling aircraft near Darwin ; the smuggler eventually landed at Katherine , and was arrested . After clocking up 147 @,@ 000 accident @-@ free flying hours over the course of 20 years , No. 36 Squadron 's C @-@ 130As were replaced in 1978 by C @-@ 130H models . The C @-@ 130Hs were primarily used as tactical air lifters throughout their service with the RAAF , and worked closely with the Army 's special forces units . 
 The disposal of the C @-@ 130As took almost a decade , with the process being subject to a police investigation . Attempts to sell the Hercules by tender during 1978 and 1979 were unsuccessful , and the American law firm Ford and Vlahos was appointed the sales agent for the aircraft in 1981 . One was sold to the French Government in 1983 and subsequently transferred to the Chadian Air Force . Another two Hercules were sold to the Columbian charter company <unk> in 1983 , but the US State Department vetoed the deal shortly before it was to have been completed over suspicions that the aircraft would be used to smuggle drugs into the United States . A C @-@ 130A was transferred to the newly established company International Air Aid and leased to the International Red Cross to fly humanitarian supplies into Ethiopia during 1986 , but this contract was cancelled after the C @-@ 130 's pilot was accused by the Ethiopian government of photographing a military area . The Australian Federal Police eventually charged two people with defrauding the Commonwealth and conspiracy in relation to these attempts to dispose of the C @-@ 130As . Eventually , four of the C @-@ 130As were sold to <unk> Air Transport Corporation in May 1988 and another four were acquired by the Fowler Aeronautical Corporation the next year . Two of the remaining three aircraft were retained by the RAAF for training and heritage purposes , and the final C @-@ 130A was scrapped . 
 In November 1978 , a C @-@ 130H became the first Australian Hercules to land in Antarctica , at McMurdo Sound . In January – February 1979 , two No. 37 Squadron C @-@ 130Es evacuated Australian and other foreign embassy staff from Tehran , shortly before the collapse of royal rule during the Iranian Revolution . During April 1982 , a C @-@ 130H was fitted with aerial firefighting equipment acquired from the United States Forest Service for trials purposes ; several Hercules later used this equipment to fight bushfires . On 5 April 1983 , 23 of the RAAF 's Hercules performed a formation flight over Sydney ; the remaining aircraft was to have participated in this flight but was diverted to conduct a search @-@ and @-@ rescue task . The Hercules ' twelve @-@ hour endurance and ability to drop survival equipment over land or sea made it a useful aircraft for such missions . In 1986 , No. 37 Squadron transported the <unk> during John Paul II 's tour of Australia ; its other unusual cargoes have included a Murray Grey stud bull presented to the Chinese Government in 1973 , kangaroos and sheep for Malaysia , and archaeological exhibits from China . 
 In February 1987 , Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons joined No. 33 Squadron ( flying Boeing 707 tanker @-@ transports ) as part of a re @-@ formed No. 86 Wing under the newly established Air Lift Group ( renamed Air Mobility Group in April 2014 ) . In May that year four C @-@ 130s flew a rifle company of the 1st Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment , from Townsville to Norfolk Island during Operation Morris Dance , the Australian Defence Force 's response to the first of the 1987 Fijian coups ; the soldiers subsequently embarked onto Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) warships by helicopter . In 1988 , No. 37 Squadron 's Hercules achieved 200 @,@ 000 accident @-@ free flying hours . No. 36 Squadron achieved 100 @,@ 000 accident @-@ free flying hours on the C @-@ 130H in 1990 . Members of the travelling public experienced flying by Hercules in 1989 , when the Australian Government employed the C @-@ 130s and 707s for transport during the pilots ' dispute that curtailed operations by the two domestic airlines ; the resulting spike in operational hours necessitated No. 486 Squadron sending detachments to several locations throughout the country to cope with increased maintenance demands . By the late 1980s , some C @-@ 130 maintenance tasks had been outsourced to commercial firms , and Air New Zealand won a four @-@ year depot maintenance contract in 1990 . 
 Following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 , No. 86 Wing prepared to deploy five C @-@ 130s to the Middle East to evacuate 3 @,@ 000 Australian citizens from Saudi Arabia in the event that Iraq also attacked that country . An operation to fly about 95 Australians and New Zealanders directly out of Iraq and Kuwait was also planned , but would have only been conducted as a last resort due to the great dangers involved . These evacuation flights were not required as Iraq did not invade Saudi Arabia , and the Australians in Iraq departed by road . A proposal to deploy some of the Hercules as part of the Australia 's contribution to the ensuing Gulf War was also rejected in late 1990 as the aircraft had to be held in reserve in case fighting on the Pacific island of Bougainville worsened and required an evacuation operation . After Operation Desert Storm commenced in January 1991 , two C @-@ 130s were dispatched to the Cocos ( Keeling ) Islands in the Indian Ocean where they were held at readiness to deploy to Saudi Arabia in case Australian citizens had to be evacuated ; these aircraft moved to Singapore on 29 January and returned to Australia in early February . Other Hercules flew supplies for the RAN warships in the region from Australia to Muscat , Oman , from January 1991 , and also transported a naval Clearance Diving Team to Muscat late in the month . In 1992 , the Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons achieved a grand total of 500 @,@ 000 accident @-@ free flying hours ; Lockheed presented No. 86 Wing with a trophy to commemorate the milestone . 
 The RAAF 's Hercules fleet continued to support Australian military deployments during the 1990s and 2000s . In 1993 , C @-@ 130s transported Australian troops to and from Somalia as part of Operation Solace . In late July the next year two C @-@ 130Hs flew water purifying equipment and medical supplies into Rwanda to assist the survivors of the genocide in that country . Six Hercules evacuated over 450 civilians from Cambodia following the coup in July 1997 . No. 37 Squadron re @-@ equipped with new @-@ model C @-@ 130J Hercules in 1999 ; during the transition to the new aircraft the C @-@ 130Es were operated by No. 36 Squadron before being retired . The seven C @-@ 130Es transferred to Lockheed Martin as part of the C @-@ 130J purchase agreement were subsequently sold to Pakistan in 2004 . Of these aircraft , six entered service with the Pakistan Air Force and the seventh was scrapped . The RAAF 's other five C @-@ 130Es were retained to be used for ground training and museum purposes . At the end of 1999 , No. 86 Wing ceased flying the regularly scheduled intra @-@ Australia C @-@ 130 flights that had begun in May 1959 . While these courier flights had been one of the main tasks assigned to the Hercules force since the type 's introduction , the reduction in commercial airfares during the late 1990s rendered them unnecessary . 
 A detachment of Hercules from Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons supported INTERFET operations in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000 . When violence broke out following the East Timor Special Autonomy Referendum on 30 August 1999 , C @-@ 130H sorties were flown into the then @-@ Indonesian province from 6 to 14 September to evacuate United Nations personnel as well as other foreign citizens and East Timorese refugees . Four C @-@ 130E sorties were also conducted to drop food and other humanitarian supplies to refugees on 17 and 18 September . On 19 September a C @-@ 130 dropped a Special Air Service Regiment ( SAS ) team near the East Timorese capital of Dili ahead of the arrival of the main INTERFET force the next day . From 20 September , thirteen RAAF Hercules ( designated No. 86 Wing Detachment B ) and transport aircraft from several other countries flew troops and supplies into East Timor . These aircraft also dropped humanitarian supplies to refugees who had fled to mountainous regions . The poor condition of most East Timorese airfields and the potential threat of being fired upon by pro @-@ Indonesian militia were constant dangers throughout this operation . In May 2000 , heavy maintenance of the C @-@ 130s , previously carried out by No. 2 AD ( reformed as No. 503 Wing in July 1992 ) was contracted out to Qantas . 
 = = = Iraq War and recent operations = = = 
 From late 2001 , Hercules began flying into Afghanistan to support the SAS squadron deployed as part of Operation Slipper , Australia 's contribution to the War in Afghanistan . Five Hercules of Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons joined relief efforts following the Bali Bombings in October 2002 . In February 2003 , a detachment of Hercules from No. 36 Squadron was deployed to the Middle East as part of the Australian contribution to the invasion of Iraq . These aircraft arrived on 10 February , and began flying transport sorties twelve days later . The C @-@ 130s were the main form of transport used to move Australian personnel and equipment in the theatre before and after the outbreak of fighting on 19 March . During the invasion the Hercules supported SAS operations in western Iraq , one being the first Coalition aircraft to land at Al Asad Airbase after it was secured by special forces personnel on 12 April . The C @-@ 130s transported supplies and equipment to airstrips in southern Iraq to support the operations of US and British forces . As the first phase of the war wound down , Australian Hercules flew medical supplies into Baghdad shortly after the city was captured . A rotating detachment of three Hercules was subsequently maintained in the Middle East to support the ongoing Australian contribution to the War in Afghanistan , as well as the forces stationed in Iraq . The aircraft assigned to this detachment amassed a total of 20 @,@ 000 operational flying hours by March 2010 . An American contractor travelling on an Australian C @-@ 130 in Iraq was killed on 27 June 2004 when the aircraft was struck by gunfire shortly after it took off from Baghdad . 
 RAAF C @-@ 130s continued to support operations in and around Australia during the early 2000s . During April 2003 a C @-@ 130 formed part of the force that tracked the North Korean freighter Pong Su before it was boarded by special forces personnel off the coast of New South Wales . No. 36 Squadron Hercules took part in Operation Sumatra Assist in the wake of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami ; the aircraft were initially used to fly supplies into the badly damaged city of Banda Aceh . Hercules flew Australian forces into East Timor during May 2006 after the government of that country requested assistance to quell a military mutiny and widespread violence . In July that year one of the C @-@ 130s deployed to the Middle East was sent to Cyprus , where it picked up Australians who had been evacuated from Lebanon following Israeli air raids and flew them to Turkey . 
 RAAF C @-@ 130 operations were concentrated in No. 37 Squadron in November 2006 , when No. 36 Squadron transferred its C @-@ 130Hs prior to re @-@ equipping with Boeing C @-@ 17 Globemaster heavy transports and relocating to RAAF Base Amberley , Queensland . The RAAF 's contribution to Operation Papua New Guinea Assist following Cyclone Guba in November 2007 included two Hercules , three Caribous , and a Globemaster . In November 2008 , the RAAF commemorated fifty years of Hercules operation . From that year only C @-@ 130Js were deployed to the Middle East . Four of the C @-@ 130Hs were placed in reserve at Richmond from 2009 . Together with Globemasters , Hercules transported medical staff and equipment to aid victims of the Christchurch earthquake in February 2011 . In May 2012 the government announced as part of the 2012 – 13 Budget that the remaining eight C @-@ 130Hs would be withdrawn from service a year earlier than previously scheduled . The aircraft were retired on 30 November that year . Two of the C @-@ 130Hs were retained by the Air Force for display at RAAF Museum and for ground training purposes at Richmond ; four were donated to the Indonesian Air Force , and the RAAF was reported to be considering options for the disposal of the other six . By the time the C @-@ 130H fleet was retired , the twelve aircraft had flown almost 250 @,@ 000 hours . In April 2013 the Australian government offered to sell five of the C @-@ 130Hs as well as spare parts and simulators to Indonesia at below their market value . The Indonesian government accepted this deal , and it was finalised on 26 July 2013 . The RAAF celebrated 800 @,@ 000 Hercules flying hours in September 2014 . The C @-@ 130Js had by this time accumulated over 100 @,@ 000 hours ; they are expected to remain in service until 2030 . 
 = New York State Route 217 = 
 New York State Route 217 ( NY 217 ) is a 6 @.@ 78 @-@ mile ( 10 @.@ 91 km ) long state highway in Columbia County , New York , in the United States . It connects NY 23 in Claverack to the Taconic State Parkway in Ghent by way of the village of Philmont . The majority of NY 217 is a rural highway , excluding portions near the NY 23 junction and in Philmont . 
 NY 217 originally extended from Mellenville to NY 22 in the town of Hillsdale when it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . It was extended west to its present terminus in Claverack in the early 1930s . NY 217 was truncated westward to Harlemville in the mid @-@ 1930s , then to the Taconic Parkway in 1980 . The former routing of NY 217 is now maintained by Columbia County as County Route 21 ( CR 21 ) and County Route 21C . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 217 begins at an intersection with NY 23 east of the hamlet of Claverack in the town of the same name in central Columbia County . The route heads northeastward from the intersection , passing by the historic Stephen Storm House at the outskirts of Claverack hamlet and into a rural portion of the town . At an intersection with Roxbury Road , NY 217 passes the Columbia Golf and Country Club to the west and begins to parallel Claverack Creek . NY 217 intersects with CR 18 ( Fish and Game Road ) , then enters the populous hamlet of Mellenville . 
 In the center of Mellenville , NY 217 intersects with CR 9 ( Mellenville Road ) , with NY 217 serving as CR 9 's southern terminus . NY 217 then heads southeast , crossing Claverack Creek and passing Mellenville Union Cemetery to the north as well as the adjacent Claverack Town Park . The route turns eastward and meets the northern terminus of Roxbury Road as it enters the village of Philmont . Within Philmont , NY 217 follows Main Street through the center of the densely populated village . At an intersection with Maple Street , the highway comes within view of Summit Lake , a small water body in the center of Philmont . Past the lake , NY 217 turns northeast once more and intersects with CR 11 ( Martindale Road ) as it leaves the village . 
 After Philmont , NY 217 progresses its way northeastward , with the highway winding its way through a mixture of dense woods and open fields . Shortly after crossing into the town of Ghent , the route turns eastward and the woods around the highway begin to cease . Here , NY 217 meets the Taconic State Parkway by way of a parclo interchange . About 800 feet ( 240 m ) after the interchange , maintenance of the highway shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation to Columbia County , and the designation changes accordingly from NY 217 to CR 21C . 
 = = History = = 
 The north – south roadway connecting the hamlets of Claverack and Mellenville ( both located within the town of Claverack ) was originally designated as the southernmost part of NY 66 in the mid @-@ 1920s . A connector between NY 66 in Mellenville and NY 22 in North Hillsdale via Philmont was designated as NY 217 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . NY 66 was rerouted south of the hamlet of Ghent c . 1933 to follow its modern alignment to the city of Hudson . NY 217 was then extended southwestward along NY 66 's former alignment to NY 23 east of Claverack . 
 NY 217 was truncated on its eastern end to Harlemville c . 1935 . On April 1 , 1980 , NY 217 was truncated again , this time to its interchange with the Taconic State Parkway , as a result of a highway maintenance swap between the state of New York and Columbia County . The former routing of NY 217 from Harlemville to North Hillsdale is now CR 21 while the portion from the Taconic Parkway to Harlemville is designated as CR 21C .

 = DNA repair = 
 DNA repair is a collection of processes by which a cell identifies and corrects damage to the DNA molecules that encode its genome . In human cells , both normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as radiation can cause DNA damage , resulting in as many as 1 million individual molecular lesions per cell per day . Many of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter or eliminate the cell 's ability to transcribe the gene that the affected DNA encodes . Other lesions induce potentially harmful mutations in the cell 's genome , which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes mitosis . As a consequence , the DNA repair process is constantly active as it responds to damage in the DNA structure . When normal repair processes fail , and when cellular apoptosis does not occur , irreparable DNA damage may occur , including double @-@ strand breaks and DNA <unk> ( <unk> crosslinks or <unk> ) . This can eventually lead to malignant tumors , or cancer as per the two hit hypothesis . 
 The rate of DNA repair is dependent on many factors , including the cell type , the age of the cell , and the extracellular environment . A cell that has accumulated a large amount of DNA damage , or one that no longer effectively repairs damage incurred to its DNA , can enter one of three possible states : 
 an irreversible state of dormancy , known as senescence 
 cell suicide , also known as apoptosis or programmed cell death 
 unregulated cell division , which can lead to the formation of a tumor that is cancerous 
 The DNA repair ability of a cell is vital to the integrity of its genome and thus to the normal functionality of that organism . Many genes that were initially shown to influence life span have turned out to be involved in DNA damage repair and protection . 
 The 2015 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Tomas <unk> , Paul Modrich , and Aziz Sancar for their work on the molecular mechanisms of DNA repair processes . 
 = = DNA damage = = 
 DNA damage , due to environmental factors and normal metabolic processes inside the cell , occurs at a rate of 10 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 molecular lesions per cell per day . While this constitutes only 0 @.@ <unk> % of the human genome 's approximately 6 billion bases ( 3 billion base pairs ) , unrepaired lesions in critical genes ( such as tumor suppressor genes ) can impede a cell 's ability to carry out its function and appreciably increase the likelihood of tumor formation and contribute to tumour heterogeneity . 
 The vast majority of DNA damage affects the primary structure of the double helix ; that is , the bases themselves are chemically modified . These modifications can in turn disrupt the molecules ' regular helical structure by introducing non @-@ native chemical bonds or bulky adducts that do not fit in the standard double helix . Unlike proteins and RNA , DNA usually lacks tertiary structure and therefore damage or disturbance does not occur at that level . DNA is , however , <unk> and wound around " packaging " proteins called histones ( in eukaryotes ) , and both superstructures are vulnerable to the effects of DNA damage . 
 = = = Types of damage = = = 
 There are several types of damage to DNA due to endogenous cellular processes : 
 oxidation of bases [ e.g. 8 @-@ oxo @-@ 7 @,@ 8 @-@ <unk> ( 8 @-@ <unk> ) ] and generation of DNA strand interruptions from reactive oxygen species , 
 alkylation of bases ( usually methylation ) , such as formation of 7 @-@ <unk> , 1 @-@ <unk> , 6 @-@ O @-@ <unk> 
 hydrolysis of bases , such as deamination , depurination , and <unk> . 
 " bulky adduct formation " ( i.e. , benzo [ a ] pyrene diol epoxide @-@ dG adduct , <unk> I @-@ dA adduct ) 
 mismatch of bases , due to errors in DNA replication , in which the wrong DNA base is stitched into place in a newly forming DNA strand , or a DNA base is skipped over or mistakenly inserted . 
 <unk> damage cause by change in single nitrogenous base of DNA 
 <unk> damage 
 Damage caused by exogenous agents comes in many forms . Some examples are : 
 UV @-@ B light causes crosslinking between adjacent cytosine and thymine bases creating pyrimidine dimers . This is called direct DNA damage . 
 UV @-@ A light creates mostly free radicals . The damage caused by free radicals is called indirect DNA damage . 
 Ionizing radiation such as that created by radioactive decay or in cosmic rays causes breaks in DNA strands . Intermediate @-@ level ionizing radiation may induce irreparable DNA damage ( leading to <unk> and transcriptional errors needed for neoplasia or may trigger viral interactions ) leading to pre @-@ mature aging and cancer . 
 Thermal disruption at elevated temperature increases the rate of depurination ( loss of purine bases from the DNA backbone ) and single @-@ strand breaks . For example , hydrolytic depurination is seen in the thermophilic bacteria , which grow in hot springs at 40 @-@ 80 ° C. The rate of depurination ( 300 purine residues per genome per generation ) is too high in these species to be repaired by normal repair machinery , hence a possibility of an adaptive response cannot be ruled out . 
 Industrial chemicals such as vinyl chloride and hydrogen peroxide , and environmental chemicals such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in smoke , soot and tar create a huge diversity of DNA <unk> <unk> , oxidized bases , alkylated <unk> and crosslinking of DNA , just to name a few . 
 UV damage , alkylation / methylation , X @-@ ray damage and oxidative damage are examples of induced damage . Spontaneous damage can include the loss of a base , deamination , sugar ring puckering and <unk> shift . 
 = = = Nuclear versus mitochondrial DNA damage = = = 
 In human cells , and eukaryotic cells in general , DNA is found in two cellular locations — inside the nucleus and inside the mitochondria . Nuclear DNA ( nDNA ) exists as chromatin during non @-@ replicative stages of the cell cycle and is condensed into aggregate structures known as chromosomes during cell division . In either state the DNA is highly compacted and wound up around bead @-@ like proteins called histones . Whenever a cell needs to express the genetic information encoded in its nDNA the required chromosomal region is unravelled , genes located therein are expressed , and then the region is condensed back to its resting conformation . Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) is located inside mitochondria organelles , exists in multiple copies , and is also tightly associated with a number of proteins to form a complex known as the nucleoid . Inside mitochondria , reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , or free radicals , byproducts of the constant production of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) via oxidative phosphorylation , create a highly oxidative environment that is known to damage mtDNA . A critical enzyme in counteracting the toxicity of these species is superoxide dismutase , which is present in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells . 
 = = = Senescence and apoptosis = = = 
 Senescence , an irreversible process in which the cell no longer divides , is a protective response to the shortening of the chromosome ends . The telomeres are long regions of repetitive noncoding DNA that cap chromosomes and undergo partial degradation each time a cell undergoes division ( see <unk> limit ) . In contrast , quiescence is a reversible state of cellular dormancy that is unrelated to genome damage ( see cell cycle ) . Senescence in cells may serve as a functional alternative to apoptosis in cases where the physical presence of a cell for spatial reasons is required by the organism , which serves as a " last resort " mechanism to prevent a cell with damaged DNA from replicating inappropriately in the absence of pro @-@ growth cellular signaling . Unregulated cell division can lead to the formation of a tumor ( see cancer ) , which is potentially lethal to an organism . Therefore , the induction of senescence and apoptosis is considered to be part of a strategy of protection against cancer . 
 = = = DNA damage and mutation = = = 
 It is important to distinguish between DNA damage and mutation , the two major types of error in DNA . DNA damages and mutation are fundamentally different . Damages are physical abnormalities in the DNA , such as single- and double @-@ strand breaks , 8 @-@ <unk> residues , and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon adducts . DNA damages can be recognized by enzymes , and , thus , they can be correctly repaired if redundant information , such as the undamaged sequence in the complementary DNA strand or in a homologous chromosome , is available for copying . If a cell retains DNA damage , transcription of a gene can be prevented , and , thus , translation into a protein will also be blocked . Replication may also be blocked or the cell may die . 
 In contrast to DNA damage , a mutation is a change in the base sequence of the DNA . A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands , and , thus , a mutation cannot be repaired . At the cellular level , mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation . Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates . In a population of cells , mutant cells will increase or decrease in frequency according to the effects of the mutation on the ability of the cell to survive and reproduce . Although distinctly different from each other , DNA damages and mutations are related because DNA damages often cause errors of DNA synthesis during replication or repair ; these errors are a major source of mutation . 
 Given these properties of DNA damage and mutation , it can be seen that DNA damages are a special problem in non @-@ dividing or slowly dividing cells , where unrepaired damages will tend to accumulate over time . On the other hand , in rapidly dividing cells , unrepaired DNA damages that do not kill the cell by blocking replication will tend to cause replication errors and thus mutation . The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell 's survival . Thus , in a population of cells composing a tissue with replicating cells , mutant cells will tend to be lost . However , infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will tend to clonally expand at the expense of neighboring cells in the tissue . This advantage to the cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism , because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer . Thus , DNA damages in frequently dividing cells , because they give rise to mutations , are a prominent cause of cancer . In contrast , DNA damages in infrequently dividing cells are likely a prominent cause of aging . 
 = = DNA repair mechanisms = = 
 Cells cannot function if DNA damage corrupts the integrity and accessibility of essential information in the genome ( but cells remain superficially functional when non @-@ essential genes are missing or damaged ) . Depending on the type of damage inflicted on the DNA 's double helical structure , a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information . If possible , cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister chromatid as a template to recover the original information . Without access to a template , cells use an error @-@ prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort . 
 Damage to DNA alters the spatial configuration of the helix , and such alterations can be detected by the cell . Once damage is localized , specific DNA repair molecules bind at or near the site of damage , inducing other molecules to bind and form a complex that enables the actual repair to take place . 
 = = = Direct reversal = = = 
 Cells are known to eliminate three types of damage to their DNA by chemically reversing it . These mechanisms do not require a template , since the types of damage they counteract can occur in only one of the four bases . Such direct reversal mechanisms are specific to the type of damage incurred and do not involve breakage of the phosphodiester backbone . The formation of pyrimidine dimers upon irradiation with UV light results in an abnormal covalent bond between adjacent pyrimidine bases . The <unk> process directly reverses this damage by the action of the enzyme <unk> , whose activation is obligately dependent on energy absorbed from blue / UV light ( 300 – 500 nm wavelength ) to promote catalysis . <unk> , an old enzyme present in bacteria , fungi , and most animals no longer functions in humans , who instead use nucleotide excision repair to repair damage from UV irradiation . Another type of damage , methylation of guanine bases , is directly reversed by the protein methyl guanine methyl transferase ( MGMT ) , the bacterial equivalent of which is called <unk> . This is an expensive process because each MGMT molecule can be used only once ; that is , the reaction is stoichiometric rather than catalytic . A generalized response to <unk> agents in bacteria is known as the adaptive response and confers a level of resistance to alkylating agents upon sustained exposure by upregulation of alkylation repair enzymes . The third type of DNA damage reversed by cells is certain methylation of the bases cytosine and adenine . 
 = = = Single @-@ strand damage = = = 
 When only one of the two strands of a double helix has a defect , the other strand can be used as a template to guide the correction of the damaged strand . In order to repair damage to one of the two paired molecules of DNA , there exist a number of excision repair mechanisms that remove the damaged nucleotide and replace it with an undamaged nucleotide complementary to that found in the undamaged DNA strand . 
 Base excision repair ( BER ) repairs damage to a single nitrogenous base by deploying enzymes called <unk> . These enzymes remove a single nitrogenous base to create an <unk> or <unk> site ( AP site ) . Enzymes called AP endonucleases nick the damaged DNA backbone at the AP site . DNA polymerase then removes the damaged region using its 5 ’ to 3 ’ exonuclease activity and correctly synthesizes the new strand using the complementary strand as a template . 
 Nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) repairs damaged DNA which commonly consists of bulky , helix @-@ distorting damage , such as pyrimidine dimerization caused by UV light . Damaged regions are removed in 12 @-@ 24 nucleotide @-@ long strands in a three @-@ step process which consists of recognition of damage , excision of damaged DNA both upstream and downstream of damage by endonucleases , and resynthesis of removed DNA region . NER is a highly evolutionarily conserved repair mechanism and is used in nearly all eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells . In prokaryotes , NER is mediated by <unk> proteins . In eukaryotes , many more proteins are involved , although the general strategy is the same . 
 <unk> repair systems are present in essentially all cells to correct errors that are not corrected by proofreading . These systems consist of at least two proteins . One detects the mismatch , and the other recruits an endonuclease that cleaves the newly synthesized DNA strand close to the region of damage . In E. coli , the proteins involved are the Mut class proteins . This is followed by removal of damaged region by an exonuclease , resynthesis by DNA polymerase , and nick sealing by DNA ligase . 
 = = = Double @-@ strand breaks = = = 
 Double @-@ strand breaks , in which both strands in the double helix are severed , are particularly hazardous to the cell because they can lead to genome rearrangements . Three mechanisms exist to repair double @-@ strand breaks ( DSBs ) : non @-@ homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) , microhomology @-@ mediated end joining ( MMEJ ) , and homologous recombination . <unk> Acharya noted that double @-@ strand breaks and a " cross @-@ linkage joining both strands at the same point is irreparable because neither strand can then serve as a template for repair . The cell will die in the next mitosis or in some rare instances , mutate . " 
 In NHEJ , DNA <unk> IV , a specialized DNA ligase that forms a complex with the cofactor <unk> , directly joins the two ends . To guide accurate repair , NHEJ relies on short homologous sequences called <unk> present on the single @-@ stranded tails of the DNA ends to be joined . If these overhangs are compatible , repair is usually accurate . NHEJ can also introduce mutations during repair . Loss of damaged nucleotides at the break site can lead to deletions , and joining of <unk> termini forms insertions or translocations . NHEJ is especially important before the cell has replicated its DNA , since there is no template available for repair by homologous recombination . There are " backup " NHEJ pathways in higher eukaryotes . Besides its role as a genome caretaker , NHEJ is required for joining hairpin @-@ capped double @-@ strand breaks induced during V ( D ) J recombination , the process that generates diversity in B @-@ cell and T @-@ cell receptors in the vertebrate immune system . 
 MMEJ starts with short @-@ range end resection by <unk> nuclease on either side of a double @-@ strand break to reveal microhomology regions . In further steps , PARP1 is required and may be an early step in MMEJ . There is pairing of microhomology regions followed by recruitment of flap structure @-@ specific endonuclease 1 ( <unk> ) to remove overhanging flaps . This is followed by recruitment of <unk> – <unk> to the site for ligating the DNA ends , leading to an intact DNA . 
 DNA double strand breaks in mammalian cells are primarily repaired by homologous recombination ( HR ) and non @-@ homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) . In an in vitro system , MMEJ occurred in mammalian cells at the levels of 10 – 20 % of HR when both HR and NHEJ mechanisms were also available . MMEJ is always accompanied by a deletion , so that MMEJ is a mutagenic pathway for DNA repair . 
 Homologous recombination requires the presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence to be used as a template for repair of the break . The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis . This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid ( available in G2 after DNA replication ) or a homologous chromosome as a template . DSBs caused by the replication machinery attempting to synthesize across a single @-@ strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the replication fork and are typically repaired by recombination . 
 Topoisomerases introduce both single- and double @-@ strand breaks in the course of changing the DNA 's state of supercoiling , which is especially common in regions near an open replication fork . Such breaks are not considered DNA damage because they are a natural intermediate in the topoisomerase biochemical mechanism and are immediately repaired by the enzymes that created them . 
 A team of French researchers bombarded Deinococcus radiodurans to study the mechanism of double @-@ strand break DNA repair in that bacterium . At least two copies of the genome , with random DNA breaks , can form DNA fragments through annealing . Partially overlapping fragments are then used for synthesis of homologous regions through a moving D @-@ loop that can continue extension until they find complementary partner strands . In the final step there is crossover by means of RecA @-@ dependent homologous recombination . 
 = = = Translesion synthesis = = = 
 Translesion synthesis ( TLS ) is a DNA damage tolerance process that allows the DNA replication machinery to replicate past DNA lesions such as thymine dimers or AP sites . It involves switching out regular DNA polymerases for specialized translesion polymerases ( i.e. DNA polymerase IV or V , from the Y <unk> family ) , often with larger active sites that can facilitate the insertion of bases opposite damaged nucleotides . The polymerase switching is thought to be mediated by , among other factors , the post @-@ translational modification of the replication <unk> factor PCNA . Translesion synthesis polymerases often have low fidelity ( high propensity to insert wrong bases ) on undamaged templates relative to regular polymerases . However , many are extremely efficient at inserting correct bases opposite specific types of damage . For example , Pol η mediates error @-@ free bypass of lesions induced by UV irradiation , whereas Pol ι introduces mutations at these sites . Pol η is known to add the first adenine across the T ^ T <unk> using Watson @-@ Crick base pairing and the second adenine will be added in its syn conformation using <unk> base pairing . From a cellular perspective , risking the introduction of point mutations during translesion synthesis may be preferable to resorting to more drastic mechanisms of DNA repair , which may cause gross chromosomal aberrations or cell death . In short , the process involves specialized polymerases either bypassing or repairing lesions at locations of stalled DNA replication . For example , Human DNA polymerase eta can bypass complex DNA lesions like guanine @-@ thymine intra @-@ strand crosslink , G [ 8 @,@ 5 @-@ Me ] T , although can cause targeted and semi @-@ targeted mutations . <unk> <unk> and Ashis Basu studied the toxicity and mutagenesis of the same lesion in Escherichia coli by replicating a G [ 8 @,@ 5 @-@ Me ] T @-@ modified plasmid in E. coli with specific DNA polymerase knockouts . <unk> was very low in a strain lacking pol II , pol IV , and pol V , the three SOS @-@ inducible DNA polymerases , indicating that translesion synthesis is conducted primarily by these specialized DNA polymerases . A bypass platform is provided to these polymerases by <unk> cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) . Under normal circumstances , PCNA bound to polymerases replicates the DNA . At a site of lesion , PCNA is ubiquitinated , or modified , by the <unk> / <unk> proteins to provide a platform for the specialized polymerases to bypass the lesion and resume DNA replication . After translesion synthesis , extension is required . This extension can be carried out by a replicative polymerase if the TLS is error @-@ free , as in the case of Pol η , yet if TLS results in a mismatch , a specialized polymerase is needed to extend it ; Pol ζ . Pol ζ is unique in that it can extend terminal mismatches , whereas more processive polymerases cannot . So when a lesion is encountered , the replication fork will stall , PCNA will switch from a processive polymerase to a TLS polymerase such as Pol ι to fix the lesion , then PCNA may switch to Pol ζ to extend the mismatch , and last PCNA will switch to the processive polymerase to continue replication . 
 = = Global response to DNA damage = = 
 Cells exposed to ionizing radiation , ultraviolet light or chemicals are prone to acquire multiple sites of bulky DNA lesions and double @-@ strand breaks . Moreover , DNA damaging agents can damage other biomolecules such as proteins , carbohydrates , lipids , and RNA . The accumulation of damage , to be specific , double @-@ strand breaks or adducts stalling the replication forks , are among known stimulation signals for a global response to DNA damage . The global response to damage is an act directed toward the cells ' own preservation and triggers multiple pathways of macromolecular repair , lesion bypass , tolerance , or apoptosis . The common features of global response are induction of multiple genes , cell cycle arrest , and inhibition of cell division . 
 = = = DNA damage checkpoints = = = 
 After DNA damage , cell cycle checkpoints are activated . Checkpoint activation pauses the cell cycle and gives the cell time to repair the damage before continuing to divide . DNA damage checkpoints occur at the G1 / S and G2 / M boundaries . An intra @-@ S checkpoint also exists . Checkpoint activation is controlled by two master kinases , ATM and ATR . ATM responds to DNA double @-@ strand breaks and disruptions in chromatin structure , whereas ATR primarily responds to stalled replication forks . These kinases phosphorylate downstream targets in a signal transduction cascade , eventually leading to cell cycle arrest . A class of checkpoint mediator proteins including BRCA1 , <unk> , and <unk> has also been identified . These proteins seem to be required for transmitting the checkpoint activation signal to downstream proteins . 
 DNA damage checkpoint is a signal transduction pathway that blocks cell cycle progression in G1 , G2 and metaphase and slows down the rate of S phase progression when DNA is damaged . It leads to a pause in cell cycle allowing the cell time to repair the damage before continuing to divide . 
 Checkpoint Proteins can be separated into four groups : phosphatidylinositol 3 @-@ kinase ( <unk> ) -like protein kinase , proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) -like group , two serine / threonine ( S / T ) kinases and their adaptors . Central to all DNA damage induced checkpoints responses is a pair of large protein kinases belonging to the first group of <unk> @-@ like protein kinases @-@ the ATM ( Ataxia telangiectasia mutated ) and ATR ( <unk> and Rad @-@ related ) kinases , whose sequence and functions have been well conserved in evolution . All DNA damage response requires either ATM or ATR because they have the ability to bind to the chromosomes at the site of DNA damage , together with accessory proteins that are platforms on which DNA damage response components and DNA repair complexes can be assembled . 
 An important downstream target of ATM and ATR is p53 , as it is required for inducing apoptosis following DNA damage . The cyclin @-@ dependent kinase inhibitor <unk> is induced by both p53 @-@ dependent and p53 @-@ independent mechanisms and can arrest the cell cycle at the G1 / S and G2 / M checkpoints by deactivating cyclin / cyclin @-@ dependent kinase complexes . 
 = = = The prokaryotic SOS response = = = 
 The SOS response is the changes in gene expression in Escherichia coli and other bacteria in response to extensive DNA damage . The prokaryotic SOS system is regulated by two key proteins : LexA and RecA . The LexA homodimer is a transcriptional repressor that binds to operator sequences commonly referred to as SOS boxes . In Escherichia coli it is known that LexA regulates transcription of approximately 48 genes including the <unk> and recA genes . The SOS response is known to be widespread in the Bacteria domain , but it is mostly absent in some bacterial phyla , like the <unk> . The most common cellular signals activating the SOS response are regions of single @-@ stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) , arising from stalled replication forks or double @-@ strand breaks , which are processed by DNA helicase to separate the two DNA strands . In the initiation step , RecA protein binds to ssDNA in an ATP hydrolysis driven reaction creating RecA – ssDNA filaments . RecA – ssDNA filaments activate LexA <unk> activity , which ultimately leads to cleavage of LexA dimer and subsequent LexA degradation . The loss of LexA repressor induces transcription of the SOS genes and allows for further signal induction , inhibition of cell division and an increase in levels of proteins responsible for damage processing . 
 In Escherichia coli , SOS boxes are 20 @-@ nucleotide long sequences near promoters with palindromic structure and a high degree of sequence conservation . In other classes and phyla , the sequence of SOS boxes varies considerably , with different length and composition , but it is always highly conserved and one of the strongest short signals in the genome . The high information content of SOS boxes permits differential binding of LexA to different promoters and allows for timing of the SOS response . The lesion repair genes are induced at the beginning of SOS response . The error @-@ prone translesion polymerases , for example , <unk> ' 2 ( also called DNA polymerase V ) , are induced later on as a last resort . Once the DNA damage is repaired or bypassed using polymerases or through recombination , the amount of single @-@ stranded DNA in cells is decreased , lowering the amounts of RecA filaments decreases cleavage activity of LexA homodimer , which then binds to the SOS boxes near promoters and restores normal gene expression . 
 = = = Eukaryotic transcriptional responses to DNA damage = = = 
 Eukaryotic cells exposed to DNA damaging agents also activate important defensive pathways by inducing multiple proteins involved in DNA repair , cell cycle checkpoint control , protein trafficking and degradation . Such genome wide transcriptional response is very complex and tightly regulated , thus allowing coordinated global response to damage . Exposure of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to DNA damaging agents results in overlapping but distinct transcriptional profiles . Similarities to environmental shock response indicates that a general global stress response pathway exist at the level of transcriptional activation . In contrast , different human cell types respond to damage differently indicating an absence of a common global response . The probable explanation for this difference between yeast and human cells may be in the heterogeneity of mammalian cells . In an animal different types of cells are distributed among different organs that have evolved different sensitivities to DNA damage . 
 In general global response to DNA damage involves expression of multiple genes responsible for <unk> repair , homologous recombination , nucleotide excision repair , DNA damage checkpoint , global transcriptional activation , genes controlling mRNA decay , and many others . A large amount of damage to a cell leaves it with an important decision : undergo apoptosis and die , or survive at the cost of living with a modified genome . An increase in tolerance to damage can lead to an increased rate of survival that will allow a greater accumulation of mutations . Yeast <unk> and human polymerase η are members of [ Y family translesion DNA polymerases present during global response to DNA damage and are responsible for enhanced mutagenesis during a global response to DNA damage in eukaryotes . 
 = = DNA repair and aging = = 
 = = = Pathological effects of poor DNA repair = = = 
 Experimental animals with genetic deficiencies in DNA repair often show decreased life span and increased cancer incidence . For example , mice deficient in the dominant NHEJ pathway and in telomere maintenance mechanisms get lymphoma and infections more often , and , as a consequence , have shorter lifespans than wild @-@ type mice . In similar manner , mice deficient in a key repair and transcription protein that unwinds DNA helices have premature onset of aging @-@ related diseases and consequent shortening of lifespan . However , not every DNA repair deficiency creates exactly the predicted effects ; mice deficient in the NER pathway exhibited shortened life span without correspondingly higher rates of mutation . 
 If the rate of DNA damage exceeds the capacity of the cell to repair it , the accumulation of errors can overwhelm the cell and result in early senescence , apoptosis , or cancer . Inherited diseases associated with faulty DNA repair functioning result in premature aging , increased sensitivity to carcinogens , and correspondingly increased cancer risk ( see below ) . On the other hand , organisms with enhanced DNA repair systems , such as Deinococcus radiodurans , the most radiation @-@ resistant known organism , exhibit remarkable resistance to the double @-@ strand break @-@ inducing effects of radioactivity , likely due to enhanced efficiency of DNA repair and especially NHEJ . 
 = = = Longevity and caloric restriction = = = 
 A number of individual genes have been identified as influencing variations in life span within a population of organisms . The effects of these genes is strongly dependent on the environment , in particular , on the organism 's diet . Caloric restriction <unk> results in extended lifespan in a variety of organisms , likely via nutrient sensing pathways and decreased metabolic rate . The molecular mechanisms by which such restriction results in lengthened lifespan are as yet unclear ( see for some discussion ) ; however , the behavior of many genes known to be involved in DNA repair is altered under conditions of caloric restriction . 
 For example , increasing the gene dosage of the gene SIR @-@ 2 , which regulates DNA packaging in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans , can significantly extend lifespan . The mammalian homolog of SIR @-@ 2 is known to induce downstream DNA repair factors involved in NHEJ , an activity that is especially promoted under conditions of caloric restriction . Caloric restriction has been closely linked to the rate of base excision repair in the nuclear DNA of rodents , although similar effects have not been observed in mitochondrial DNA . 
 It is interesting to note that the C. elegans gene AGE @-@ 1 , an upstream effector of DNA repair pathways , confers dramatically extended life span under free @-@ feeding conditions but leads to a decrease in reproductive fitness under conditions of caloric restriction . This observation supports the <unk> theory of the biological origins of aging , which suggests that genes conferring a large survival advantage early in life will be selected for even if they carry a corresponding disadvantage late in life . 
 = = Medicine and DNA repair modulation = = 
 = = = Hereditary DNA repair disorders = = = 
 Defects in the NER mechanism are responsible for several genetic disorders , including : 
 <unk> <unk> : hypersensitivity to sunlight / UV , resulting in increased skin cancer incidence and premature aging 
 Cockayne syndrome : hypersensitivity to UV and chemical agents 
 <unk> : sensitive skin , brittle hair and nails 
 Mental retardation often accompanies the latter two disorders , suggesting increased vulnerability of developmental neurons . 
 Other DNA repair disorders include : 
 Werner 's syndrome : premature aging and retarded growth 
 Bloom 's syndrome : sunlight hypersensitivity , high incidence of malignancies ( especially leukemias ) . 
 Ataxia telangiectasia : sensitivity to ionizing radiation and some chemical agents 
 All of the above diseases are often called " segmental <unk> " ( " accelerated aging diseases " ) because their victims appear elderly and suffer from aging @-@ related diseases at an abnormally young age , while not manifesting all the symptoms of old age . 
 Other diseases associated with reduced DNA repair function include Fanconi anemia , hereditary breast cancer and hereditary colon cancer . 
 = = DNA repair and cancer = = 
 Because of inherent limitations in the DNA repair mechanisms , if humans lived long enough , they would all eventually develop cancer . There are at least 34 Inherited human DNA repair gene mutations that increase cancer risk . Many of these mutations cause DNA repair to be less effective than normal . In particular , Hereditary <unk> colorectal cancer ( <unk> ) is strongly associated with specific mutations in the DNA mismatch repair pathway . BRCA1 and BRCA2 , two famous genes whose mutations confer a hugely increased risk of breast cancer on carriers , are both associated with a large number of DNA repair pathways , especially NHEJ and homologous recombination . 
 Cancer therapy procedures such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy work by overwhelming the capacity of the cell to repair DNA damage , resulting in cell death . Cells that are most rapidly dividing — most typically cancer cells — are preferentially affected . The side @-@ effect is that other non @-@ cancerous but rapidly dividing cells such as progenitor cells in the gut , skin , and hematopoietic system are also affected . Modern cancer treatments attempt to localize the DNA damage to cells and tissues only associated with cancer , either by physical means ( concentrating the therapeutic agent in the region of the tumor ) or by biochemical means ( exploiting a feature unique to cancer cells in the body ) . 
 = = = Epigenetic DNA repair defects in cancer = = = 
 Classically , cancer has been viewed as a set of diseases that are driven by progressive genetic abnormalities that include mutations in tumour @-@ suppressor genes and oncogenes , and chromosomal aberrations . However , it has become apparent that cancer is also driven by epigenetic alterations . 
 Epigenetic alterations refer to functionally relevant modifications to the genome that do not involve a change in the nucleotide sequence . Examples of such modifications are changes in DNA methylation ( <unk> and <unk> ) and histone modification , changes in chromosomal architecture ( caused by inappropriate expression of proteins such as <unk> or <unk> ) and changes caused by microRNAs . Each of these epigenetic alterations serves to regulate gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence . These changes usually remain through cell divisions , last for multiple cell generations , and can be considered to be <unk> ( equivalent to mutations ) . 
 While large numbers of epigenetic alterations are found in cancers , the epigenetic alterations in DNA repair genes , causing reduced expression of DNA repair proteins , appear to be particularly important . Such alterations are thought to occur early in progression to cancer and to be a likely cause of the genetic instability characteristic of cancers . 
 Reduced expression of DNA repair genes causes deficient DNA repair . When DNA repair is deficient DNA damages remain in cells at a higher than usual level and these excess damages cause increased frequencies of mutation or epimutation . Mutation rates increase substantially in cells defective in DNA mismatch repair or in homologous recombinational repair ( <unk> ) . Chromosomal rearrangements and <unk> also increase in <unk> defective cells . 
 Higher levels of DNA damage not only cause increased mutation , but also cause increased epimutation . During repair of DNA double strand breaks , or repair of other DNA damages , incompletely cleared sites of repair can cause epigenetic gene silencing . 
 Deficient expression of DNA repair proteins due to an inherited mutation can cause increased risk of cancer . Individuals with an inherited impairment in any of 34 DNA repair genes ( see article DNA repair @-@ deficiency disorder ) have an increased risk of cancer , with some defects causing up to a 100 % lifetime chance of cancer ( e.g. p53 mutations ) . However , such germline mutations ( which cause highly penetrant cancer syndromes ) are the cause of only about 1 percent of cancers . 
 = = = Frequencies of <unk> in DNA repair genes = = = 
 Deficiencies in DNA repair enzymes are occasionally caused by a newly arising somatic mutation in a DNA repair gene , but are much more frequently caused by epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of DNA repair genes . For example , when 113 colorectal cancers were examined in sequence , only four had a missense mutation in the DNA repair gene MGMT , while the majority had reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region ( an epigenetic alteration ) . Five different studies found that between 40 % and 90 % of colorectal cancers have reduced MGMT expression due to methylation of the MGMT promoter region . 
 Similarly , out of 119 cases of mismatch repair @-@ deficient colorectal cancers that lacked DNA repair gene PMS2 expression , PMS2 was deficient in 6 due to mutations in the PMS2 gene , while in 103 cases PMS2 expression was deficient because its pairing partner MLH1 was repressed due to promoter methylation ( PMS2 protein is unstable in the absence of MLH1 ) . In the other 10 cases , loss of PMS2 expression was likely due to epigenetic overexpression of the microRNA , miR @-@ 155 , which down @-@ regulates MLH1 . 
 In further examples ( tabulated in Cancer epigenetics ) , epigenetic defects were found at frequencies of between 13 % -100 % for the DNA repair genes BRCA1 , WRN , <unk> , <unk> , MGMT , MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH4 , ERCC1 , <unk> , <unk> and ATM . These epigenetic defects occurred in various cancers ( e.g. breast , ovarian , colorectal and head and neck ) . Two or three deficiencies in the expression of ERCC1 , <unk> or PMS2 occur simultaneously in the majority of the 49 colon cancers evaluated by <unk> et al . 
 The chart in this section shows some frequent DNA damaging agents , examples of DNA lesions they cause , and the pathways that deal with these DNA damages . At least 169 enzymes are either directly employed in DNA repair or influence DNA repair processes . Of these , 83 are directly employed in the 5 types of DNA repair processes illustrated in the chart . The more well studied genes central to these repair processes are also shown in the chart . As indicated by the DNA repair genes shown in red , many of the genes in these repair pathways are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms , and these are frequently reduced or silent in various cancers ( marked by an asterisk ) . Two review articles , and two broad experimental survey articles document most of these epigenetic DNA repair deficiencies . 
 It appears that epigenetic repression of DNA repair genes in accurate DNA repair pathways are central to carcinogenesis . However microhomology @-@ mediated end joining ( MMEJ ) is an additional error @-@ prone repair pathway for double @-@ strand breaks . In MMEJ repair of a double @-@ strand break , an homology of 5 - 25 complementary base pairs on both strands is identified and used as a basis to align the strands , but with mismatched ends . MMEJ removes extra nucleotides ( flaps ) where strands are joined , then <unk> the strands to create an intact DNA double helix . MMEJ always involves at least a small deletion , so that it is a mutagenic pathway . <unk> , the flap endonuclease in MMEJ , is <unk> increased by promoter <unk> and is over @-@ expressed in the majority of cancers of the breast , prostate , stomach , neuroblastomas , pancreatic , and lung . Other genes in the MMEJ pathway are also over @-@ expressed in a number of cancers ( see MMEJ for summary ) , and are shown in cyan ( blue ) in the chart in this section . 
 = = DNA repair and evolution = = 
 The basic processes of DNA repair are highly conserved among both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and even among bacteriophage ( viruses that infect bacteria ) ; however , more complex organisms with more complex genomes have correspondingly more complex repair mechanisms . The ability of a large number of protein structural motifs to catalyze relevant chemical reactions has played a significant role in the elaboration of repair mechanisms during evolution . For an extremely detailed review of hypotheses relating to the evolution of DNA repair , see . 
 The fossil record indicates that single @-@ cell life began to proliferate on the planet at some point during the Precambrian period , although exactly when recognizably modern life first emerged is unclear . Nucleic acids became the sole and universal means of encoding genetic information , requiring DNA repair mechanisms that in their basic form have been inherited by all extant life forms from their common ancestor . The emergence of Earth 's oxygen @-@ rich atmosphere ( known as the " oxygen catastrophe " ) due to photosynthetic organisms , as well as the presence of potentially damaging free radicals in the cell due to oxidative phosphorylation , necessitated the evolution of DNA repair mechanisms that act specifically to counter the types of damage induced by oxidative stress . 
 = = = Rate of evolutionary change = = = 
 On some occasions , DNA damage is not repaired , or is repaired by an error @-@ prone mechanism that results in a change from the original sequence . When this occurs , mutations may propagate into the genomes of the cell 's progeny . Should such an event occur in a germ line cell that will eventually produce a gamete , the mutation has the potential to be passed on to the organism 's offspring . The rate of evolution in a particular species ( or , in a particular gene ) is a function of the rate of mutation . As a consequence , the rate and accuracy of DNA repair mechanisms have an influence over the process of evolutionary change . Since the normal adaptation of populations of organisms to changing circumstances ( for instance the adaptation of the beaks of a population of finches to the changing presence of hard seeds or insects ) proceeds by gene regulation and the recombination and selection of gene variations – alleles – and not by passing on irreparable DNA damages to the offspring , DNA damage protection and repair does not influence the rate of adaptation by gene regulation and by recombination and selection of alleles . On the other hand , DNA damage repair and protection does influence the rate of accumulation of irreparable , advantageous , code expanding , inheritable mutations , and slows down the evolutionary mechanism for expansion of the genome of organisms with new functionalities . The tension between evolvability and mutation repair and protection needs further investigation .

 A technology named clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat shortened to CRISPR @-@ <unk> was discovered in 2012 . The new technology allows anyone with molecular biology training to alter the genes of any species with precision . 
 = Vilayet Printing House ( Sarajevo ) = 
 The Vilayet Printing House ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : <unk> <unk> , Vilajetska štamparija ) , originally named Sopron 's Printing House ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> pečatnja ) , was the official printing house of the Ottoman Vilayet of Bosnia from April 1866 until the occupation of the province by Austria @-@ Hungary in August 1878 . It was the second printing house that operated in the territory of present @-@ day Bosnia and Herzegovina , founded in Sarajevo almost 350 years after the Goražde printing house ceased its activity . Its founder was <unk> Sopron , a publisher and printer from Zemun , who sold the establishment to the Government of the Vilayet of Bosnia in October 1866 . Its foundation happened in the context of modernising and <unk> Tanzimat reforms in the Ottoman Empire . Its principal aim was to issue an official gazette of the vilayet and publish textbooks for the elementary schools of Bosnian Serbs and Croats , thus stopping their import from the Principality of Serbia and the Austrian Empire . 
 The first newspaper to be published in Bosnia and Herzegovina was Bosanski vjestnik , a political @-@ informative and educational weekly edited by Sopron and printed in Serbian Cyrillic . It had a pro @-@ Serb inclination , though it generally promoted a unitary Bosnian nation , in accordance with the Ottoman policy in the province . The official gazette , the weekly Bosna , was primarily concerned with publishing and explaining laws , orders , and proclamations . Another weekly issued by the printing house was Sarajevski cvjetnik , which fiercely defended the Ottoman regime and <unk> with Serbian and Austrian newspapers that criticised it . Bosna and Sarajevski cvjetnik were bilingual , printed half in Ottoman Turkish and half in Serbo @-@ Croatian in the Cyrillic script . The printing house produced a number of elementary school textbooks , including the second Serbian alphabet book using the reformed Serbian Cyrillic , following Vuk Karadžić 's book published in Vienna in 1827 . Other books include a collection of Bosnian Serb lyric folk poetry , an Ottoman Turkish grammar , and several Jewish religious books . The first printed exemplar of Bosnian <unk> literature was also published by the Vilayet Printing House . It produced around 50 books and booklets altogether , most of them being concerned with various Ottoman laws and legislation . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Goražde printing house was one of the earliest among the Serbs and the first in the territory of present @-@ day Bosnia and Herzegovina . It was founded by Božidar <unk> near the town of Goražde in 1519 , in the early period of Ottoman rule over the region . It produced three Orthodox religious books , including the Goražde Psalter , with its last book printed in 1523 . The next printing house would not be opened in Bosnia and Herzegovina until the second half of the 19th century . 
 In the first half of the 19th century , the Ottoman Empire was swept by a wave of reforms meant to centralise and <unk> the government of the state . Bosnian Muslim feudal lords rejected the reforms and repeatedly revolted against the Sultan . The Ottoman military intervened in the Eyalet of Bosnia in 1831 and 1850 , crushing the local feudal lords , and the set of modernising reforms known as the Tanzimat began to be implemented in the province . The Christians were underprivileged in the Ottoman Empire , and this was even more so in Bosnia than in the rest of the empire . An improvement in this respect occurred in 1862 , when the Bosnian Christians ( Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats ) were granted more rights , including those to open new churches and to run their own schools . This came after several uprisings by the Christians , especially Serbs , who had the strongest national movement in the province . Ivan Franjo <unk> and other Bosnian Franciscans requested the right to establish a printing house in 1847 , 1850 , 1853 , and 1857 , but each time their requests were denied by the Ottoman government . 
 The reforms became firmly rooted in Bosnia during the 1860s , when the Ottoman governor ( <unk> ) of the province was <unk> Sherif Osman Pasha , though most of the changes proceeded at a slow pace . According to the recently issued Ottoman constitutional law , each vilayet ( first @-@ order administrative division ) was to have an official printing house and an official gazette . The Constitutional Law for the Vilayet of Bosnia , published in 1865 , promoted the province from the rank of eyalet to that of vilayet , and Article 9 of this law stipulated that there be an official printing house in its capital . Osman Pasha also had other motivations to establish a printing house . At that time , the press in the Principality of Serbia and in South Slavic parts of the Austrian Empire sharply criticised the Ottoman regime in Bosnia . Textbooks imported from Serbia for Serb elementary schools in Bosnia also disseminated nationalist sentiment , which Osman Pasha saw as anti @-@ Ottoman . In his view , the national movement of the Serbs in Bosnia presented a danger for Ottoman state interests . To protect their hold on Bosnia , the Ottomans sought to promote the idea of a unitary Bosnian nation , thus counteracting the particular national identities and political aspirations of Bosnia 's Serbs , Croats , and Muslims . 
 = = History and publications = = 
 = = = Under Sopron = = = 
 Shortly after the Constitutional Law for the Vilayet of Bosnia was issued , Osman Pasha invited publishing magnate <unk> Sopron to Sarajevo . Sopron was the owner and manager of a publishing and printing house in Zemun ( then part of the Austrian Empire , today one of the municipalities of Belgrade , Serbia ) . An ethnic German , he was born in 1821 in Novi Sad as Ignaz Karl <unk> . Upon his arrival in Sarajevo , Osman Pasha offered him a subsidy to establish and organise a printing house . It was to be headquartered in a building on Sarajevo 's <unk> <unk> street that was being rented by the vilayet 's government . Sopron soon came to the city bringing with him printing tools and materials , accompanied by a typesetter from Belgrade , Ilija Tomić . Tomić was in charge of the Cyrillic and Latin letters , and he engaged three graduated students of the Serb secondary school in Sarajevo to be his trainees . Osman Pasha also invited a man named Kadri @-@ effendi from Istanbul to work as the typesetter for Arabic letters . The principal aim of the printing house was to issue an official gazette and to publish elementary school textbooks , thus stopping their import from Serbia and Austria . 
 <unk> pečatnja , or Sopron 's Printing House , was officially opened on 19 April [ O.S. 7 April ] 1866 . The Cyrillic orthography that was used in it was consistently in accordance with the linguistic reform of Serbian philologist Vuk Karadžić , which was at that time relatively new and still not universally accepted . The first issue of a political @-@ informative and educational weekly newspaper named Bosanski vjestnik ( Serbian Cyrillic : <unk> <unk> , " Bosnian Herald " ) appeared on the same day . This was the first newspaper ever to be published in Bosnia and Herzegovina . Sopron made a deal with the vilayet 's authorities to publish it independently from the official gazette . When Sopron presented the editorial policy of his newspaper to the authorities , he indicated that it would be printed in the Serbian language , much to the Ottomans ' displeasure . The authorities subsequently scratched " Serbian " and replaced it with " Bosnian " . Sopron accepted the revision and went along with Osman Pasha 's idea of promoting a unitary Bosnian nation . Nevertheless , Bosanski vjestnik had " a decidedly Serb orientation " . Sopron did not consider this contradictory , as he apparently identified Bosnian @-@ ness with <unk> . In the newspaper , the language was occasionally referred to as Serbo @-@ Bosnian , while both the Serb and the Croat ethnic designations were expressed . 
 The first issue of the official gazette , named Bosna ( Ottoman Turkish : <unk> ; Cyrillic : Босна , " Bosnia " ) , appeared on 28 May [ O.S. 16 May ] 1866 , i.e. , 13 Muharram 1283 AH . It was a bilingual weekly with half of the pages printed in Ottoman Turkish in the Arabic script , and the other half printed in Serbo @-@ Croat in the Cyrillic script . The text in Serbo @-@ Croat was a faithful translation of that in Turkish . The gazette was primarily concerned with publishing and explaining laws , orders , and proclamations , but it also provided news from the political , economic , cultural , and social life of the vilayet . It would be issued without interruption for more than twelve years , and for much of that period it was the only newspaper in the Vilayet of Bosnia . It had different editors over time : Mustafa Refet <unk> , Mehmed <unk> Kurtćehajić , Salih <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> Kurtćehajić , and Kadri @-@ effendi . Most of them were Bosnian Muslims , except <unk> ( a Jew ) and Kadri @-@ effendi ( a Turk ) . A constant in the gazette was its translator from Turkish , Miloš Mandić , a polyglot who had previously worked as a teacher in a Serb elementary school in Prijepolje . Besides Sopron , Mandić was one of the contributors to Bosanski vjestnik , along with Bogoljub Petranović and Salih <unk> <unk> . Petranović was the manager of the Serb secondary school in Sarajevo and the leader of the Serb youth movement in the city , while <unk> was an official of the Gazi <unk> @-@ beg Mosque . In August 1866 , the printing house published its first book , Lesson on Man and His Duties ( <unk> о <unk> и <unk> <unk> ) , translated from Greek by Georgije Jovanović .

 In October 1866 , Sopron sold the establishment to the Government of the Vilayet of Bosnia . It was renamed Vilajetska pečatnja , or the Vilayet Printing House , and from March 1867 onwards it bore the name Vilajetska štamparija ( the same meaning ) . Sopron remained the owner and editor of Bosanski vjestnik , and managed to publish 51 issues . After a year in Sarajevo , Sopron left the city and returned to Zemun . The first director of the printing house was Haim <unk> , a Belgrade Jew , who was offered that position by Osman Pasha . Mehmed <unk> Kurtćehajić , the editor of Bosna since early 1868 , began publishing Sarajevski cvjetnik at the end of that year . It was a bilingual weekly like Bosna , containing commentaries on current politics and articles on various social issues , most of which was written by Kurtćehajić . He fiercely defended the Ottoman regime in Bosnia , <unk> with newspapers from Serbia and Austria which criticised it . In May 1869 , when Osman Pasha ceased to be the governor of the Vilayet of Bosnia , <unk> returned to Belgrade . The new governor installed Kurtćehajić as the director of the printing house . Kurtćehajić died of tuberculosis in September 1872 ; the last issue of Sarajevski cvjetnik had appeared two months earlier . 
 Kurtćehajić 's death marked the end of a prosperous period for the Vilayet Printing House . Its subsequent directors were less capable , and the establishment 's condition began to deteriorate . In 1877 , the last Ottoman governor of Bosnia installed Kadri @-@ effendi as director , and he significantly improved the condition of the printing house . Austro @-@ Hungarian troops entered Sarajevo on 19 August 1878 , marking the start of 40 years of Austro @-@ Hungarian occupation . Four days later , General Josip Filipović , the Austro @-@ Hungarian commander in Sarajevo , transferred the management of the printing house from Kadri @-@ effendi to an Austrian official . This spelled the end of the Vilayet Printing House , which was renamed <unk> štamparija ( National Printing Press ) , and continued its work as the official printing house of the Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina . The last , <unk> , issue of Bosna appeared shortly before the end of Ottoman rule over Bosnia , on 30 July [ O.S. 18 July ] 1878 . 
 Apart from the newspapers Bosanski vjestnik , Bosna , and Sarajevski cvjetnik , the Vilayet Printing House published around fifty books and booklets in Serbo @-@ Croatian , Ottoman Turkish , and Hebrew . While most of these publications were concerned with various Ottoman laws and legislation , the printing house also published a number of textbooks . The textbooks for Serb elementary schools in the vilayet were prepared by Miloš Mandić on the basis of those that were used in Serbia . These include an alphabet book ( <unk> ) , a short Biblical history ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , a basal reader ( <unk> <unk> ) , and the First <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) ; they were published in 1867 and 1868 . Mandić 's alphabet book , the printing house 's first textbook , was the second Serbian alphabet book using the reformed Serbian Cyrillic . The First Serbian Alphabet Book ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , authored by Vuk Karadžić , had been published in Vienna in 1827 . The original plan was to print fifteen textbooks for Serb schools , ranging in subject from grammar , arithmetic , geography and religious teaching , but only four were printed . Although they were based on the textbooks used in Serbia , the vilayet 's authorities made sure that every mention of Serbs and the Serbian language was erased from them . 
 Bogoljub Petranović collected Bosnian Serb lyric folk poems and published them in 1867 in a separate book ( <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) ) . The First Bosnian @-@ Serb Calendar for the Common Year 1869 ( <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> за <unk> <unk> 1869 ) , consisting of 58 pages , was edited by Jovan R. Džinić . In Serbian tradition , calendars contained more than just <unk> data and were also popular literary and educational almanacs . Džinić 's calendar had more of an educational , rather than literary , character . 
 Catholic school textbooks in the vilayet included a geography book ( <unk> <unk> <unk> s <unk> o Bosni , 1869 ) by Franjo <unk> . <unk> , an alphabet book with elements of religious education ( <unk> s <unk> <unk> nauka <unk> za <unk> <unk> u Bosni , 1869 ) , and another geography book ( <unk> <unk> za <unk> <unk> u Bosni , 1871 ) by the Franciscan <unk> Martić . The Catholic bishop of Mostar <unk> <unk> financed the printing of an Ottoman Turkish grammar in 1871 . The Hebrew books included <unk> Beti ( <unk> <unk> ) and <unk> <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , which list religious observances , respectively , on Shabbat and Passover , and a small liturgical book titled <unk> Moda 'ah . These were composed around 1875 by the Sarajevo Rabbi Eliezer Papo . The printing house also published the first printed work of Bosnian <unk> literature , the book <unk> @-@ <unk> , which contained the principal teachings of Islam . It was composed by Omer Humo , the mufti of Mostar .

 Walker began playing hockey at age six and by thirteen he was in a league with players as old as twenty and able to <unk> them . During the 2007 season he played in both the under @-@ 14 and under @-@ 16 leagues . During 14 U14 games he recorded 77 goals and 25 assists for 102 points , a record for the league ; the second leading scorer had 70 points in 24 games . Walker had similar numbers in the U16 league ; he scored 69 points in 16 games to again lead the league in scoring , with the second highest total was 53 points in 20 games . 
 As Walker was dominating the local competition , he began to look for other options . In 2007 his coach Ivan Manco , who came from Slovakia , arranged for Walker to tryout for HC Vítkovice in the Czech Republic , where Manco knew one of the coaches . Walker impressed the team enough to be given a place on their under @-@ 18 junior team . In 2009 – 10 he recorded 42 points in 28 games for the U18 team and earned a chance to play for the U20 team . He also returned to Australia during the Czech offseason and played for the Sydney Ice Dogs of the Australian Ice Hockey League . 
 On 9 October 2011 , Walker made his debut for the senior HC Vítkovice club in the Czech Extraliga , making him the first Australian to play professionally in Europe ; he was also the youngest player in the Extraliga . HC Vítkovice was invited to the 2011 Spengler Cup and in their first game against Canada Walker scored the only goal for Vítkovice . He became the youngest player to score in Spengler Cup history and was named player of the game for Vítkovice . With the conclusion of the 2011 – 12 Czech Extraliga season , HC Vítkovice loaned Walker to HC Olomouc of the 1 @.@ národní <unk> liga , the second @-@ highest league in the Czech Republic , on 20 February 2012 . Walker played 34 games in his first season in the Extraliga , scoring four goals and five assists for nine points . He played a further two games with HC Olomouc , recording an assist . 
 As a result of his play in the Extraliga , Walker began to be noticed by the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . In the NHL Central Scouting Bureau 's January 2012 list of draft prospects , Walker was listed as the 21st best European @-@ based skater for the 2012 NHL Entry Draft , the second highest Czech @-@ based player on the list . Walker was listed as the 25th best European skater in the NHL 's final list of prospects for the 2012 Entry Draft . He was not selected in the Entry Draft , but was invited to participate in the Washington Capitals development camp in July ; however NHL rules required that Walker participate in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft before he was able to sign with any team . 
 = = = North America = = = 
 During the 2012 – 13 season Walker appeared in twenty games with HC Vítkovice and recorded one assist ; he was loaned to <unk> <unk> 2003 for three games , where he also had one assist . After six years in the Czech Republic , Walker signed a contract on 8 January 2013 with the Youngstown Phantoms of the United States Hockey League , a junior ice hockey league in the United States . He made his debut for the team on 11 January against the Chicago Steel , recording a goal . After four games with the Phantoms , in which he recorded six points , Walker was named to the USHL / NHL Top Prospects Game on 23 January 2013 ; he replaced his teammate , who was ill . Walker played 29 games for the Phantoms during the regular season and recorded 27 points ( 7 goals , 20 assists ) . His 20 assists were good enough for fifth on the team , even though Walker only joined the team midway through the season . His season ended early due to an injury suffered in a game on 5 April where Walker broke a bone in his neck as a result of a hit from behind ; as a result he missed all the Phantoms playoff games . 
 Upon the conclusion of the season Walker returned to the Czech Republic to train , before heading back to Australia . In July he was invited to once again attend the Capitals development camp , scheduled for September . He performed well enough to remain with the team and attend their full training camp as one of 40 players . However , due to an overlooked rule , the Capitals were unable to sign Walker ; as he had started the 2012 – 13 season in Europe and then moved to North America , and was under 20 years old , he would have to enter the 2014 NHL Entry Draft before being allowed to sign an NHL contract . Instead , on 24 September Walker signed a contract with the Capitals ' American Hockey League affiliate , the Hershey Bears . He made his debut for the Bears on 5 October 2013 against the Adirondack Phantoms , becoming the first Australian to play in the AHL . During Walker 's third game with the Bears , on October 27 against the Norfolk Admirals , he scored his first goal and recorded his first professional fight . 
 The 2014 NHL Entry Draft was the third and final NHL draft that Walker was eligible for , and he was selected in the third round , 89th overall , by the Capitals . In doing so , Walker became the first Australian to be selected in an NHL draft . On 25 July 2014 , Walker was signed to a three @-@ year entry @-@ level contract with the Capitals . Partway through the 2014 – 2015 season Walker was reassigned to the South Carolina Stingrays of the ECHL . After a two @-@ game stint with the Stingrays , where he recorded two points , Walker was brought back to Hersey . Reassigned to South Carolina again in January , Walker was injured in a game on 28 January when he tore his ACL , ending his season .

 = Tropical Storm Marco ( 2008 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Marco is the smallest tropical cyclone on record . The thirteenth named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season , Marco developed out of a broad area of low pressure over the northwestern Caribbean during late September 2008 . Influenced by a tropical wave on October 4 , a small low @-@ level circulation center developed over Belize . After crossing the southern end of the Yucatán Peninsula and emerging into the Bay of Campeche , the low was declared Tropical Depression Thirteen early on October 6 . The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name Marco later that day . Marco reached its peak intensity with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) early on October 7 . Around this time , tropical storm force winds extended 11 @.@ 5 miles ( 18 @.@ 5 km ) from the center of the storm , making Marco the smallest tropical cyclone on record . Around 1200 UTC , Marco made landfall near Misantla , Veracruz . The storm rapidly weakened after landfall , dissipating later that day . Due to its small size , Marco caused minimal damage ; however , the storm 's heavy rains led to floods up to 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 05 m ) deep that covered highways and damaged homes . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Tropical Storm Marco originated in a broad area of low pressure that persisted over the northwestern Caribbean in late September 2008 . On October 4 , a tropical wave reached the same area , and the system spawned a circulation center over Belize . Development of the low was initially inhibited by its proximity to land . As the system neared the Bay of Campeche , convection quickly developed around the low . At 0000 UTC on October 6 , the low was designated as Tropical Depression Thirteen while located over Laguna de Términos . A mid @-@ level ridge located to the north of the depression led to movement in a general west @-@ northwest direction . Forecasters anticipated intensification up until landfall because of the storm 's well @-@ developed outflow and the low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures in its path . By 1200 UTC , the small cyclone , with a cloud shield no more than 85 miles ( 137 kilometers ) across , was upgraded to Tropical Storm Marco . 
 Favorable conditions for development allowed Marco to quickly intensify throughout the day on October 6 . Early on October 7 , Marco reached its peak intensity with winds of 65 mph ( 105 kilometers per hour ) and a minimum pressure of 998 millibar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 47 inHg ) . This was based on a reconnaissance mission into Marco which recorded flight @-@ level winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) , corresponding to a surface wind speed of 61 mph ( 98 km / h ) . Following the quick increase in intensity , forecasters noted the possibility of Marco intensifying into a hurricane before making landfall . The storm maintained a small area of deep convection , averaging 9 @.@ 2 miles ( 14 @.@ 8 km ) in diameter , as it continued moving towards the west @-@ northwest . Shortly after reaching peak intensity , tropical storm force winds extended 11 @.@ 5 miles ( 18 @.@ 5 km ) from the center of Marco . At 1200 UTC , the center of Marco made landfall near Misantla , Veracruz , with winds of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) . Once inland , Marco rapidly weakened , being downgraded to a tropical depression six hours after landfall . The small depression dissipated later that day over the mountains of Mexico . 
 = = Preparations , impact and records = = 
 Upon the storm 's formation , the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for the Gulf of Mexico from Tuxpan to Punta El Lagarto . That afternoon the government issued a hurricane watch between Cabo Rojo and Veracruz , and extended the tropical storm warning northward to Cabo Rojo . Officials closed schools ahead of the storm and opened 200 shelters . An estimated 3 @,@ 000 people were evacuated from low @-@ lying areas along the coast . Soldiers used school buses to transport evacuees to the shelters . Marco formed in the area of Mexico 's main oil @-@ facilities , leading to the evacuation of 33 workers from four platforms . Six oil wells and a natural gas processing plant were also shut down in Veracruz . The Mexican Secretariat of Communications and Transportation also closed the ports of Nautla and Alvarado to small vessels as a precautionary measure . 
 Upon landfall , heavy rains peaking at 7 @.@ 9 inches ( 201 millimeters ) in El <unk> , San Luis Potosí and falling at rates up to 1 inch per hour ( 25 @.@ 4 mm / h ) , caused some flooding in coastal towns near Veracruz as people evacuated to higher ground . The rains from Marco worsened flood situations in areas of Mexico already suffering from severe flooding . Officials in Veracruz , in their post @-@ storm damage survey , reported that two rivers , the <unk> and <unk> , overflowed their banks due to rains produced by Marco . One of these rivers left the towns of <unk> and <unk> under 10 ft ( 3 m ) of water . Highways along the coast of Veracruz were also flooded . Another 250 homes were flooded when a lake and a river overflowed their banks . Thirteen municipalities within Veracruz were affected by Marco . In Vega de <unk> , 77 people were evacuated to nearby shelters after their homes were inundated with water . Three landslides were also reported in Misantla <unk> ; none of them caused damage . In all , Marco 's impact was light ; minimal damage was recorded , and none of the estimated 400 @,@ 000 people affected by the storm sustained injury . 
 In the wake of Marco , the General Coordination of Civil Protection of the Ministry of the Interior declared a state of emergency for 48 municipalities in Veracruz . Relief goods were distributed to the affected areas by October 9 . The Government of Mexico reported that 4 @,@ 700 blankets , 2 @,@ 900 mattresses , 5 @,@ 554 bottles of water ( each containing 500 milliliters ) , 260 @,@ 000 boxes of milk , 250 @,@ 000 packages of biscuits , and 12 @,@ 400 boxes of school supplies had been distributed . 
 At 0052 UTC on October 7 , tropical storm force winds extended 11 @.@ 5 miles ( 18 @.@ 5 km ) from the center of Marco . This made Marco the smallest tropical cyclone ever recorded , surpassing the previous record set on December 24 , 1974 by Cyclone Tracy , whose tropical storm @-@ force winds extended 30 miles ( 48 km ) . 
 = Crisis Core : Final Fantasy VII = 
 Crisis Core : Final Fantasy VII ( <unk> <unk> -ファイナルファンタジーVII- , <unk> Koa -Fainaru Fantajī Sebun- ) is an action role @-@ playing game developed and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation Portable . First released in 2007 , the game is a prequel to the 1997 video game Final Fantasy VII and is a part of the metaseries Compilation of Final Fantasy VII , which includes other products related to the original game . 
 The game primarily focuses on Zack Fair , a young member of the paramilitary organization SOLDIER , who is assigned to look for the missing SOLDIER Genesis Rhapsodos . As he searches for Genesis , Zack discovers Genesis ' origin , Project G , and how it is related to two other high @-@ ranking SOLDIERs ; Sephiroth and Angeal Hewley . The game 's storyline takes the player from the war between the megacorporation Shinra and the people of Wutai to the events in Nibelheim , ending just before the beginning of Final Fantasy VII . 
 The game was directed by Hajime Tabata , with Tetsuya Nomura serving as character designer . Before development , the Square Enix staff initially planned to make a PlayStation Portable port of the mobile phone game Before Crisis : Final Fantasy VII , but after discussion , they decided to create a new game . The plot is based on a scenario Kazushige Nojima had in mind when working on Final Fantasy VII . Crisis Core enjoyed strong sales , selling over three million units worldwide . Critical reception was generally positive . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Crisis Core is an action role @-@ playing game in which the player controls Zack Fair . The player moves Zack through and between open areas , allowing him to talk with non @-@ player characters , interact with the environment , and engage monsters in battle . At save points , the player may opt to take one of the available side missions , and if so , Zack is moved to a special area to complete the mission , which usually involves defeating one or more monsters . If the mission is successfully completed , the player is rewarded with beneficial items , and often new missions become available . Whether the player is successful in the side mission or not , upon completion , Zack is returned to the save point in the main game . 
 Crisis Core uses a real @-@ time combat system in which the player can move Zack around , initiate attacks , special abilities and spells , use items , and block or dodge attacks . Zack 's abilities in battle are set by what materia he currently has equipped . Up to six materia can be equipped at any one time , which can impart special attacks , magic spells , or passive bonuses such as health increases or the ability to display the statistics of the current foe in combat . Materia are gained throughout the game through exploration , as rewards from side missions , as spoils of battle , or from shops . Materia can be fused together to make more powerful versions with improved bonuses ; for example , fusing an attack materia with an elemental magic materia can create a new attack skill materia that inflicts elemental magic damage in addition to physical damage . Special items collected in the game can also be used in materia fusion to further increase the materia 's power . 
 Crisis Core uses a slot machine @-@ like mechanic to affect the combat system . The " Digital Mind Wave " ( DMW ) features two sets of three spinning wheels ; one set with the numbers one through seven , and another with pictures of characters that Zack befriends during the game . The DMW automatically spins as long as Zack has at least 10 " Soldier Points " , which are awarded to the player by defeating foes . If the DMW stops with the same three pictures lined up , Zack will then perform an appropriate Limit Break attack that can greatly harm an enemy or significantly heal Zack . Additionally , in this case , if the number slots give two or more of the same number , the materia in that slot will power up . Should the numbers line up as " 777 " , Zack will gain an experience level , increasing his health , soldier points , and ability points . If there is no match in the pictures , matching numbers on the slots will grant temporary bonuses , such as limited invincibility or zero @-@ cost use of skills and abilities . The chance of matching pictures is tied to the current Limit level , which is raised by taking damage in battle and reduced upon successful battles , and after certain storyline events . After collecting certain items in the game , the pictures on the DMW may also randomly change to summonable creatures , which have more destructive and beneficial Limit Breaks should the pictures match up . 
 Following completion of the game , the player will obtain a New Game Plus option . The North American and European releases of Crisis Core also have an added difficulty mode , which increases the power and health of enemies .

 = = = Characters = = = 
 Crisis Core begins seven years before the events of Final Fantasy VII , and many characters from that game and other related works appear . However , the primary characters in the game are from either SOLDIER ( the private army of Shinra ) , or from their elite branch of operatives , the Turks . 
 The main protagonist is Zack Fair , a young and friendly SOLDIER . His mentor and friend is Angeal Hewley , a 1st class SOLDIER who is also friends with fellow SOLDIER members Sephiroth and Genesis , who ultimately becomes the game 's primary antagonist . The SOLDIER operatives work under Director Lazard , the illegitimate son of President Shinra . Zack is also friends with the Turks , particularly their leader Tseng , and one of their female operatives , <unk> . During the course of the game , Zack encounters and befriends Aerith , a young woman tending flowers from a ruined church in the Midgar slums . He also befriends Cloud , a Shinra infantryman . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 SOLDIERs Zack Fair and Angeal Hewley are dispatched to Wutai to support the Shinra war effort . However , during the fighting , Angeal disappears , and Zack is appointed to find both him and an already missing SOLDIER , Genesis . Zack , accompanied by Tseng , finds that Genesis and Angeal have betrayed Shinra , and , as such , Zack and Sephiroth are assigned to kill them . With help from Dr. Hollander , a scientist with a vendetta against Shinra , Genesis creates an army of clones to attack Shinra headquarters . After the forces are defeated , Zack and Sephiroth track down Hollander 's secret laboratory , and learn that Hollander had used both Genesis and Angeal as part of Project G , an attempt to create soldiers infused with Jenova cells . Sephiroth faces off against Genesis , whilst Zack pursues Hollander . However , Angeal is intent on keeping Hollander alive as he wants to find a way to return to normal , and so he prevents Zack from killing the doctor by knocking Zack into the slums of Midgar . 
 Zack recovers to find Aerith tending to him . After they spend some time together , Zack returns to SOLDIER headquarters which is under attack by Genesis . On his way , Zack allies with Angeal , who has developed doubts about his and Genesis ' actions . As Angeal , Zack and Sephiroth protect the headquarters , Angeal confronts Genesis , but both disappear . Zack is subsequently ordered to investigate Modeoheim , where Genesis has been spotted . En route , Zack meets Shinra infantryman Cloud , and they become friends . Near Modeoheim , Zack encounters and defeats Genesis , who appears to commit suicide by throwing himself into the depths of a reactor . Zack travels on to Modeoheim and finds both Angeal and Hollander . Angeal summons and fuses with his own clones , and mutates into a monster , forcing Zack to kill him . Before he dies , Angeal gives Zack his Buster Sword , telling him to protect his honor . 
 Whilst Shinra continues the pursuit of Hollander , it emerges that Genesis is still alive and still producing clones , some of which have appeared in Midgar , forcing Zack to return so as to protect Aerith . He leaves her with an Angeal clone that seems to be protecting her , and then travels with Sephiroth and Cloud to investigate a Mako reactor near Nibelheim . While checking the reactor , Sephiroth learns from Genesis that he was an experiment , implanted with cells of Jenova before he was born . Genesis explains that his body is degrading , and he needs Sephiroth 's cells to survive , but Sephiroth refuses . Overcome with the recent revelations regarding his past , Sephiroth locks himself in Nibelheim Mansion , and a week later , sets Nibelheim ablaze and goes to the Mako reactor to take Jenova 's body . When Zack fails to stop him , Cloud throws him into the Lifestream below the reactor . Zack awakes to find that Shinra has covered @-@ up the Nibelheim incident and he and Cloud have become part of Professor Hojo 's experiments on Jenova cells and Mako exposure . However , Zack is able to escape , taking the catatonic Cloud with him . They immediately become high priority targets for Shinra . While fleeing , Zack learns that Genesis and Hollander are still trying to stabilize Genesis ' mutation , and they now plan to use Cloud 's cells , as he is the only one with Sephiroth 's genes . 
 Hollander tries to get to Cloud , but is killed by Zack . Zack then finds Director Lazard who , now mutated into an Angeal clone , has turned against Shinra . Lazard directs Zack to the remains of <unk> to find Genesis . Zack defeats Genesis , but upon returning he discovers that Shinra have located them , and killed Lazard . The Angeal clone that was left guarding Aerith also arrives , but he too is killed . Zack discovers a note he had carried from Aerith , and learns he and Cloud had been subjected to Hojo 's experiments for four years . Zack and Cloud are able to escape , heading towards Midgar , whilst Genesis ' body is collected by two soldiers . 
 Shinra pursue Zack and Cloud , and catch up with them just outside Midgar . Leaving the still semi @-@ conscious Cloud hidden away , Zack fights off an enormous number of Shinra troops , but is ultimately fatally wounded . Cloud manages to crawl to Zack 's body after Shinra has left , and Zack , in his dying breath , bequeaths the Buster Sword to Cloud , as Angeal had done to him . Cloud then begins to walk to Midgar . The epilogue recreates the opening scenes of Final Fantasy VII , as Cloud , his memories confused , claims to be a former SOLDIER . 
 = = Development = = 
 The idea of Crisis Core originated when Hajime Tabata was chosen as director for an upcoming Final Fantasy title for the PlayStation Portable . After discussion with Tetsuya Nomura and Yoshinori Kitase , Tabata decided that the game should be another installment in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII , feeling that the pressure of producing a game from a popular series would motivate both the staff and himself . The original idea was to make a PlayStation Portable port of Before Crisis : Final Fantasy VII , as it had been released for mobile @-@ phones and the staff wanted to expand it . However , after deciding Zack was going to be the protagonist of the new game , the idea of a Before Crisis port was cancelled . 
 Kitase wanted to make sure the game exceeded fans ' expectations , so he made sure that rather than making it as a " tribute " to Final Fantasy VII , it shared important links with other titles from Compilation of Final Fantasy VII . Similarly , Tabata explained that he and the staff were very wary throughout production of altering the " fans ' perception of Final Fantasy VII 's iconic characters . " For example , one of the main background events from Final Fantasy VII , Nibelheim 's destruction , had been changed somewhat in the OVA Last Order : Final Fantasy VII , and due to negative fan reaction to these change , the game staff decided not to make any major changes in Crisis Core . However , they also operated on the principal that this game dealt with those characters ' " younger days , " so that new elements could be added without changing the characters too much . 
 One of the primary reasons Zack was chosen as protagonist was because his fate was predetermined . Kitase stated that Zack 's story had " been cooking for 10 years " as , despite being a minor character in Final Fantasy VII , Nomura had already developed conceptual artwork , and Kazushige Nojima had already worked out a story . The game was originally meant to have more scenes depicting Zack and Cloud 's flight to Midgar , so as to expand on their friendship and unrealized plans , but these scenes were removed due to UMD limitations , and so the staff focused more on Zack 's background as a formidable warrior . The addition of the character of Genesis to the story came about after discussions between producer Hideki Imaizumi and the character 's Japanese voice actor , Gackt , as Imaizumi had been impressed with the characters ' brief appearance in the secret ending to Dirge of Cerberus : Final Fantasy VII , and felt there was great room to expand the character . Sephiroth 's role was specifically written to give him a " much more human side . " The game 's logo represents various main characters ; the blue sky symbolizes Zack ; the white feather symbolizes Angeal ; and the water symbolizes Aerith . 
 Crisis Core was first envisioned as an action game , but because almost all of the staff had more experience designing RPGs , they decided to modify it , making battles more similar to the ones found in standard RPGs . However , they also added more action orientated elements to the battles , resulting in the game becoming more of an action RPG than a traditional RPG . The Materia system was designed so that players could choose between " RPG @-@ oriented enhancements " and " action @-@ oriented enhancements , " as well as to help with the game 's balance . Additionally , the Digital Mind Wave system ( DMW ) was added to give gameplay an element of luck , as well as to prevent combat feeling repetitive . Nomura and Kitase wanted to include this in the game because of their enthusiasm for pachinko machines . 
 The game was first announced at the 2004 E3 , prior to the release of the PlayStation Portable . Its first trailer consisted of clips from Last Order . In an interview for Famitsu , Nomura stated that a playable demo of the game would be ready by the end of 2006 . However , there was no mention of whether the demo would be openly available to PSP owners . By May 2005 , Nomura announced that he had designed the concept art for the game , with the gameplay set to be " interesting " and " previously unseen . " In May 2007 , both Nomura and Tabata revealed that the game was 90 % complete , and that completing its story mode and all side quests would take about 100 hours of gameplay . A playable demo was made available at Jump Festa ' 06 .

 = Olympic marmot = 
 The Olympic marmot ( Marmota olympus ) is a rodent in the squirrel family Sciuridae ; it occurs only in the U.S. state of Washington , on the middle elevations of the Olympic Peninsula . The closest relatives of this species are the hoary marmot and the Vancouver Island marmot . In 2009 , it was declared the official endemic mammal of Washington . 
 This marmot is about the size of a domestic cat , typically weighing about 8 kg ( 18 lb ) in summer . The species shows the greatest sexual dimorphism found in marmots , with adult males weighing on average 23 % more than females . It can be identified by a wide head , small eyes and ears , stubby legs , and a long , bushy tail . Its sharp , rounded claws aid in digging burrows . The coat color changes with the season and with age , but an adult marmot 's coat is brown all over with small whiter areas for most of the year . 
 The Olympic marmot has a diet consisting mainly of a variety of meadow flora , including dry grasses , which it also uses as bedding in burrows . It is preyed on by various terrestrial mammals and avian raptors , but its main predator today is the coyote . The Olympic marmot is rated a species of the least concern on the IUCN Red List . It is protected by law in the Olympic National Park , which contains most of its habitat . 
 The burrows of this marmot are made in colonies , which are found in various mountain locations and differ in size . A colony may contain as few as one marmot family or multiple families with up to 40 marmots . Olympic marmots are very sociable animals which often engage in play fighting and vocalize four different whistles to communicate . During hibernation beginning in September , they are in a deep sleep and do not eat , causing them to lose half their body mass . Adults emerge in May and their young in June . Female marmots reach sexual maturity at three years of age , and produce litters of 1 – 6 every other mating season .
