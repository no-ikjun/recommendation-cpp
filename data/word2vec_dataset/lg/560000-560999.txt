 " The Lazy Song " is one of the eleven songs composed and produced by The Smeezingtons for Mars ' debut studio album Doo @-@ Wops & Hooligans . In an interview with Sound on Sound , fellow <unk> Ari Levine explained how they came up with the song " [ It ] was a very tough song to write , even though it is so simple . That song began one day when we were hanging around the studio and hadn ’ t written a song for a few days and we were kind of burnt out and didn ’ t feel like working . We felt lazy . ' K ’ naan ' was in the studio with us , and the four of us suddenly came up with this idea . " He added , " After that we had a really hard time getting the groove and the drums to sit right . Once you have one piece of the puzzle , like when you realise that a drum track is good , you can add other things in after that . " 
 " The Lazy Song " was mixed at Larrabee Sound Studios in Hollywood by Manny Marroquin , while Christian Plata and Erik Madrid served as the assistant for mix .

 = Elizabeth of Bosnia = 
 Elizabeth of Bosnia ( c . 1339 – January 1387 ) was queen consort and later regent of Hungary and Croatia , as well as queen consort of Poland . Daughter of Ban Stephen II of Bosnia , Elizabeth married King Louis I of Hungary in 1353 . In 1370 , she gave birth to a long @-@ anticipated heir , Catherine , and became Queen of Poland when Louis succeeded his uncle , Casimir III . The royal couple had two more daughters , Mary and Hedwig , but Catherine died in 1378 . Initially a powerless consort with no substantial influence , Elizabeth then started surrounding herself with noblemen loyal to her , led by her favourite , Nicholas I Garai . When Louis died in 1382 , Mary ascended to the throne of Hungary with Elizabeth as regent . Unable to preserve the personal union of Hungary and Poland , the queen dowager secured the Polish throne for her youngest daughter , Hedwig . 
 During her regency in Hungary , Elizabeth faced several rebellions led by John Horvat and John of Palisna , who attempted to take advantage of Mary 's insecure reign . In 1385 , they invited King Charles III of Naples to depose Mary and assume the crown . Elizabeth responded by having Charles murdered two months after his coronation , in 1386 . She had the crown restored to her daughter and established herself as regent once more , only to be captured , imprisoned and ultimately strangled by her enemies . 
 = = Descent and early years = = 
 Born about 1339 , Elizabeth was the daughter of Ban Stephen II of Bosnia , the head of the House of Kotromanić . Her mother , Elizabeth of Kuyavia , was a member of the House of Piast and grandniece of King Władysław I of Poland . The Hungarian queen dowager Elizabeth of Poland was first cousin once removed of Elizabeth 's mother . After her daughter @-@ in @-@ law Margaret succumbed to the Black Death in 1349 , Queen Elizabeth expressed interest in her young kinswoman , having in mind a future match for her widowed and childless son , King Louis I of Hungary . She insisted on immediately bringing the girl to her court in Visegrád for fostering . Despite her father 's initial reluctance , Elizabeth was sent to the dowager 's court . 
 In 1350 , Tsar Stephen Uroš IV Dušan of Serbia attacked Bosnia in order to regain Zachlumia . The invasion was not successful , and the Tsar tried to negotiate peace , which would be sealed by arranging Elizabeth 's marriage to his son and heir apparent , Stephen Uroš V. Mavro <unk> , whose reliability in this regard " is a subject of controversy " , wrote that the Tsar expected Zachlumia to be ceded as Elizabeth 's dowry , which her father refused . Later that year she was formally betrothed to the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Louis , who hoped to counter Dušan 's expansionist policy either with her father 's help or " as his eventual successor " , according to historian Oscar Halecki . 
 = = Marriage = = 
 Elizabeth 's marriage to Louis was celebrated in Buda on 20 June 1353 . The couple were related within the prohibited degree of kinship , Duke Casimir I of Kuyavia being Elizabeth 's maternal great @-@ great @-@ grandfather and Louis ' maternal great @-@ grandfather . A papal dispensation was thus necessary , but it was only sought four months after the wedding took place . The historian Iván Bertényi suggests that the ceremony may have been hastened by an unintended pregnancy , as the couple had been in contact for years . If so , the pregnancy likely ended in a stillbirth . Elizabeth 's mother had apparently died by the time she was married . Louis was dismayed when , upon his father @-@ in @-@ law 's death later the same year , Elizabeth 's young and ambitious cousin Tvrtko ascended the Bosnian throne . In 1357 , Louis summoned the young Ban to Požega and compelled him to surrender most of western Zachlumia as Elizabeth 's dowry . 
 The new Queen of Hungary subjected herself entirely to her controlling mother @-@ in @-@ law , Elizabeth of Poland . The fact that the young queen 's retinue consisted of the same individuals who had served the queen mother indicates that Elizabeth of Bosnia may not even have had her own court . Her mother @-@ in @-@ law 's influence prevailed until 1370 , when Louis succeeded his maternal uncle , Casimir III , as King of Poland . Elizabeth 's maternal uncle , Vladislaus the White , had also been a candidate for the Polish throne . Following his coronation in Poland , Louis brought Casimir 's underage daughters , Anne and Hedwig , to be raised by Elizabeth . Elizabeth , though Queen of Poland , was never crowned as such . 
 The problem of the succession marked Louis ' reign . Elizabeth was long considered barren , and a succession crisis was expected after the childless king 's death . Her brother @-@ in @-@ law Stephen was heir presumptive until his death in 1354 , when his son John replaced him . However , John also died in 1360 . A daughter was born to the King and Queen in 1365 , but the child died the next year . For a few years , John 's sister , Elizabeth , was treated as heir presumptive and a suitable marriage for her was being negotiated . Things suddenly took a different course when the King 's wife had three daughters in quick succession ; Catherine was born in July 1370 , Mary in 1371 , and Hedwig in 1373 or 1374 . Elizabeth is known to have written a book for the education of her daughters , a copy of which was sent to France in 1374 . However , all copies have been lost . 
 On 17 September 1374 , Louis granted various concessions to the Polish nobility by the Privilege of Koszyce , in exchange for their promise that a daughter of his would succeed him and that he , Elizabeth or his mother could indicate which one . In Hungary , he focused on the centralization of power as means of ensuring that his daughters ' rights would be respected . Securing marriage to one of the princesses was a priority in European royal courts . Mary was scarcely one year old when she was promised to Sigismund of Luxembourg . In 1374 , Catherine was betrothed to Louis of France , but died towards the end of 1378 . The same year , Hedwig , promised to William of Austria in a <unk> de <unk> , left her mother 's court and moved to Vienna , where she spent the next two years . The Polish lords swore to uphold Mary 's rights in 1379 , while Sigismund received this recognition three years later . Elizabeth was present , along with her husband and mother @-@ in @-@ law , at a meeting in Zólyom on 12 February 1380 , whereby Hungarian lords confirmed Hedwig 's Austrian match ; this indicates that Louis may have intended to leave Hungary to Hedwig and William . 
 The King , weakened by illness , became progressively less active in the last years of his reign , devoting an increasing amount of time to prayer , as did his aging mother , who had returned from Poland in 1374 . These circumstances allowed Elizabeth to assume a more prominent role at court . Her influence had grown steadily since she had given her husband heirs . It appeared probable that the crowns would pass to one of Elizabeth 's underage daughters and by 1374 , their rights were confirmed . Behind the scenes , Elizabeth began ensuring that the succession would be as smooth as possible by encouraging a slow but decisive change in the personnel of the government . <unk> and illiterate barons were gradually replaced by a small group of noblemen who excelled in their professional skills but were not distinguished by birth or military ability . Palatine Nicholas I Garai led the movement and enjoyed the full support of the Queen , and their power eventually became virtually unrestricted . 
 = = Widowhood and regency = = 
 Louis died on 10 September 1382 , with Elizabeth and their daughters at his bedside . Elizabeth , now queen dowager , had Mary crowned " King " of Hungary only seven days later . Halecki believes that the reason behind Elizabeth 's haste and Mary 's masculine title was the dowager 's desire to exclude Sigismund , her prospective son @-@ in @-@ law , from the government . <unk> as regent on behalf of the eleven @-@ year @-@ old sovereign , Elizabeth made Garai her chief adviser . Her rule was not to be peaceful . The royal court was pleased with the arrangement , but Hungarian noblemen were unwilling to defer to a woman and objected to Mary 's accession , maintaining that the lawful heir to the throne was King Charles III of Naples , the only remaining male Angevin . Charles was , at that time , unable to claim Mary 's throne because his own was threatened by Duke Louis I of Anjou . 
 The first to rise against Elizabeth , in 1383 , was John of Palisna , Prior of Vrana . Historian John V. A. Fine says that the Prior " seems to have been chiefly opposed " to the centralizing policy which her husband had enforced . Her cousin Tvrtko also decided to take advantage of Louis ' death and Elizabeth 's unpopularity by trying to recover the lands he had lost to the King in 1357 . Tvrtko and John formed an alliance against Elizabeth , but they were ultimately defeated by her army , with John being forced to flee to Bosnia . 
 = = = Polish succession = = = 
 Although Louis had designated Mary as his successor in both of his kingdoms , the Polish nobles , seeking an end to the personal union with Hungary , were not willing to recognize Mary and her fiancé Sigismund as their sovereigns . They would have accepted Mary if she had moved to Kraków and reigned over both kingdoms from there rather than from Hungary , ruling according to their advice rather than that of the Hungarian nobles and marrying a prince of their choosing . Their intentions , however , were not to Elizabeth 's taste . She too would have been required to move to Kraków , where a lack of men loyal to her would have rendered her unable to enforce her own will . Elizabeth was also aware of the difficulties her mother @-@ in @-@ law had faced during her regency in Poland , which had ended with the old queen fleeing her native kingdom in disgrace . 
 An agreement was reached between Elizabeth 's and Polish delegates in Sieradz on 26 February 1383 . The queen dowager thereby proposed her youngest daughter Hedwig as Louis ' successor in Poland , and absolved the Polish nobles from their 1382 oaths to Mary and Sigismund . She agreed to send Hedwig to be crowned in Kraków but requested that , in view of her age , she spend three more years in Buda following the ceremony . The Poles , entangled in a bloody civil war , initially conceded to the requirement , but soon found it unacceptable for their monarch to reside abroad for so long . At the second meeting in Sieradz , held on 28 March , they contemplated offering the crown to Hedwig 's distant relative , Duke Siemowit IV of Masovia . They eventually opted against it , but at the third Sieradz meeting , on 16 June , Siemowit himself decided to lay claim to the crown . Elizabeth reacted by having an army of 12 @,@ 000 men devastate Masovia in August , forcing him to drop his pretensions . Meanwhile , she realized that she could not expect the nobles to accept her request and instead resolved to delay Hedwig 's departure . Despite continuous Polish demands to expedite her arrival , Hedwig did not move to Kraków until the end of August 1384 . She was crowned on 16 October 1384 . No regent was appointed , and the 10 @-@ year @-@ old exercised her authority according to the advice of Kraków magnates . Elizabeth never saw her again . 
 In 1385 , Elizabeth received an official delegation from Grand Duke Jogaila of Lithuania , who wished to marry Hedwig . In the Act of Kreva , Jogaila promised to pay compensation to William of Austria on Elizabeth 's behalf and requested that Elizabeth , as widow of King Louis and heiress of Poland herself as great @-@ grandniece of King Władysław I ( whose name Jogaila had purposely assumed on his baptism ) , legally adopt him as her son in order to give him a claim to the Polish crown in the event of Hedwig 's death . The marriage was celebrated in 1386 . 
 = = = Mary 's marriage = = = 
 Mary 's fiancé Sigismund and his brother Wenceslaus , King of Germany and Bohemia , were also opposed to Elizabeth and Garai . The queen dowager and the Palatine , on the other hand , were not enthusiastic about Sigismund reigning together with Mary . Both Sigismund and Charles schemed to invade Hungary ; the former intended to marry Mary and become her co @-@ ruler , while the latter intended to depose her . Elizabeth was determined to allow neither and , in 1384 , started negotiating Mary 's marriage to Louis of France , notwithstanding her daughter 's engagement to Sigismund . Had this proposal been made after Catherine 's death in 1378 , the Western Schism would have represented a problem , with France recognising Clement VII as pope and Hungary accepting Urban VI . However , Elizabeth was desperate to avoid an invasion in 1384 and unwilling to let the schism stand in the way of the negotiations with the French . Clement VII issued a dispensation which annulled Mary 's betrothal to Sigismund , and her proxy marriage to Louis was celebrated in April 1385 , but it was not recognized by the Hungarian noblemen , who adhered to Urban VI . 
 Elizabeth 's plan to have Mary married to Louis of France divided the court . The Lackfis , the master of the treasury Nicholas Zámbó and the judge royal Nicholas Szécsi openly opposed it and renounced their allegiance to the queen dowager in August , which resulted in her depriving them of all their offices and replacing them with Garai 's partisans . The kingdom was on the verge of a civil war when Charles decided to invade , encouraged by John Horvat and his brother Paul , Bishop of Zagreb . Charles ' imminent arrival forced Elizabeth to yield and abandon the idea of French marriage . While her envoys in Paris were preparing for Louis 's journey , Elizabeth came to terms with her opponents and designated Szécsi as the new palatine . 
 Four months after her proxy marriage to Louis , Sigismund entered Hungary and married Mary , but the reconciliation between the fractions turned out to be too late to forestall Charles ' invasion . Sigismund fled to his brother 's court in Prague in the autumn of 1385 . 
 = = = Deposition and restoration = = = 
 Charles 's arrival was well @-@ prepared . He was accompanied by his Hungarian supporters and Elizabeth was unable to raise an army against him or prevent him from <unk> a diet , in which he obtained an overwhelming support . Mary was forced to abdicate , opening the path for Charles to be crowned on 31 December 1385 . Elizabeth and Mary were compelled to attend the ceremony and swear allegiance to him . 
 Deprived of authority , Elizabeth feigned friendly feelings for Charles while his retinue was at the court , but after his supporters had returned to their homes , he was left defenseless . She acted quickly and invited him to visit Mary in Buda Castle . Upon his arrival there on 7 February 1386 , Elizabeth had Charles stabbed in her apartments and in her presence . He was taken to Visegrád , where he died on 24 February . 
 Having had the crown restored to her daughter , Elizabeth immediately proceeded to reward those who had helped her , giving a castle in Gimes to Blaise Forgách , the master of the cupbearers , who had mortally wounded Charles . In April , Sigismund was brought to Hungary by his brother Wenceslaus and the queens were pressured into accepting him as Mary 's future co @-@ ruler by the Treaty of Győr . Having Charles murdered did not help Elizabeth as much as she hoped it would , however , as Charles 's supporters immediately recognized his son Ladislaus as heir and fled to Zagreb . Bishop Paul pawned church estates in order to collect money for an army against the queens .

 Elizabeth believed that her daughter 's mere presence would help calm the opposition . Accompanied by Garai and a modest following , she and Mary set out for Đakovo . However , Elizabeth had seriously misjudged the situation . On 25 July 1386 , they were ambushed en route and attacked by John Horvat in Gorjani . Their small entourage failed to fight off the attackers . Garai was killed by the rebels and his head was sent to Charles 's widow Margaret , while the queens were imprisoned in the bishop of Zagreb 's castle of <unk> . Elizabeth took all blame for the rebellion and begged the attackers to spare her daughter 's life . 
 Elizabeth and Mary were soon sent to Novigrad Castle , with John of Palisna as their new jailer . Margaret insisted that Elizabeth be put to death . She was tried and , after the Christmas adjournment of the proceedings , found guilty of inciting Charles ' murder . Sigismund marched into Slavonia in January 1387 , with the intention to reach Novigrad and rescue the queens . Towards the middle of January , when news of Sigismund 's approach reached Novigrad , Elizabeth was strangled by guards before Mary 's eyes . 
 Mary was released from the captivity by Sigismund 's troops on 4 June . Having been secretly buried in St <unk> 's Church in Zadar on 9 February 1387 , Elizabeth 's body was exhumed on 16 January 1390 , transferred by sea to Obrovac and then carried overland to Székesfehérvár Basilica .

 Elizabeth was regarded by her contemporaries as an efficient but ruthless politician who used political intrigues to protect and defend her daughters ' rights . She was a caring parent , but was neither politically talented nor competent to prepare Mary and Hedwig for their roles as monarchs . Elizabeth failed to set a good example for her daughters , and her unbalanced character and questionable methods in politics would serve more as a warning to the young sovereigns . Her <unk> and inability to make clear decisions threatened Hedwig 's status , while her endless problems with Croatian nobles and failure to improve relations with her native Bosnia made Mary 's reign insecure and tumultuous . 
 Queen Elizabeth commissioned the creation of the Chest of Saint Simeon in 1381 . The chest , located in Zadar , is of great importance for the history of the city , as it depicts various historical events – such as the death of her father – and Elizabeth herself . According to legend , she stole the saint 's finger and paid for the creation of the casket in order to atone for her sin . The casket contains a scene which allegedly depicts the queen gone mad after stealing the relict .

 = American Thermos Bottle Company Laurel Hill Plant = 
 The American Thermos Bottle Company Laurel Hill Plant , located in the Laurel Hill section of Norwich , Connecticut , in the United States , includes 11 contributing buildings and two other contributing structures . The original plant was built during 1912 – 13 and used a historic Italianate house as a company office building . The plant was the primary factory where Thermos bottles were manufactured from 1913 to 1984 . The plant is historically significant to its connection to the Thermos Company and the history of Norwich . The complex is architecturally significant because it displays the adaptive use of industrial mill design to new industry . It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 . 
 Since its nomination , numerous changes and renovations have occurred . The surrounding area has seen the construction of condominiums and the large manufacturing building being renovated and re @-@ purposed for loft @-@ style apartments . Renovations on the northern end of the property would require the demolition of two buildings to construct the Integrated Day Charter School . Completed in 2008 , a new two @-@ story addition created an indoor gymnasium , kitchen , offices and a new lobby for the school .

 The citizens of Norwich , Connecticut , sought out the Thermos company to build and operate a plant on the banks of the Thames River . A group of citizens under the group " Norwich Boomers " rallied the community to purchase 27 acres ( 11 ha ) of land for $ 750 per acre ( $ 1 @,@ 900 / ha ) so that it could be used for the Thermos Plant . The house of Dr. William H. Mason was included in the purchase . The Italianate house was converted to be used as an office building . Together , the citizens and the city raised $ 78 @,@ 000 . A contract was signed on February 14 , 1912 , designating Norwich as the home of the Thermos Plant . In return , Thermos would include the city 's name in the company 's advertisements . Thermos would even mark the products produced in Norwich with " Made in Norwich " . Allyn L. Brown acted as attorney and provided counsel for the deal . The construction of the plant was a boon for Norwich , which helped the employment of the area after the decline of the textile industry . The operations expanded into nearby <unk> , operating until they were phased out and shut down in 1988 . 
 = = Plant overview = = 
 The plant was laid out roughly north to south orientation along the Thames River . The plant itself is a mixture of interconnected buildings and stand @-@ alone structures . The stand @-@ alone structures included three propane sheds ( Buildings 63 , 64 and 65 ) that were located near the Human Resources building ( Building 86 ) and its storage shed ( Building 30 ) . The main structure of the plant was a string of connecting buildings that were erected and integrated into the production and operation of the plant . At the north end of the plant was the Research and Development building ( Building 87 ) , it was located connected to two large storage buildings ( Building 1 and 2 ) . On the front of Building 2 was the main offices ( Building 85 ) . Building 2 is connected to the largest building , the Manufacturing Building ( Building 3 ) , which is connected to the Manufacturing Glass House ( Building 5 ) and Glass House 2 ( Building 32 ) . Building 32 also served as storage building . Connected to Building 5 is the Glass House <unk> & Mix House ( Number 7 ) and the Compressor & Auxiliary Generator building ( Number 9 ) at the southern end . 
 Originally , the plant consisted of the company offices and the large Manufacturing Building . The Mason house , which would become the company office was originally constructed in 1861 . It is a two @-@ story brick Italianate style house that was converted to be used as an office building and significantly modified throughout the years . The 1929 addition added a wing that connected it to the metal products building which was built that year . In 1942 , a two @-@ story front addition was added and another addition to the west was added around 1950 . These additions also resulted in the removal of the cupola , brick chimneys , front entry , and veranda . The Manufacturing building , constructed from 1912 to 1913 , is three stories high on the river side and two stories on the east . It is divided into 31 bays with pilasters . At each end of the building are stairs and elevator towers . The structural remains of the original glass house survive as a sub @-@ basement in a one @-@ story extension at the south end of the building . 
 The Human Resources and Research and Development buildings were originally constructed around 1912 by the MacKay Copper Process Company . The property was acquired in 1923 by the Thermos Company following the foreclosure of the MacKay company . The Human Resources building was used by the <unk> department until its conversion in 1948 . The Research and Development building was previously the Engineering building . A one @-@ story hipped frame gatehouse was constructed in the 1920s . The Carpenter Shop ( Building 62 ) was constructed in 1926 . The Thermos factory completed construction of a storage building in 1929 ( Building 2 ) and another storage building in 1941 ( Building 1 ) . Glass House 1 ( Building 5 ) was constructed in 1939 and incorporates a warehouse dating from 1930 into its construction . Glass House 2 was constructed in 1951 and is connected to the Manufacturing Building by a conveyor .

 The plant was a set in the 1990 movie Everybody Wins , afterwards the property was partially developed to condominiums . The project failed and resulted in the closure of the Brooklyn Savings Bank in 1990 . The Thermos on Thames condominium assets were acquired by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and was purchased by TOT Transfer for $ 420 @,@ 000 . An auction was held and around $ 1 @.@ 2 million was made for the purchase of 25 condominiums , but 55 unsold units were transferred to Real Estate Seizure Sales and 30 acres ( 12 ha ) to Thermos Norwich Developers LLC . The factory was also converted to loft @-@ style apartments . 
 In 1997 , the Integrated Day Charter School renovated a 16 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 500 m2 ) section of the factory for use as a school . This required the demolition of two buildings to serve as space for a playground and parking spaces . The total cost of the renovations were estimated at $ 750 @,@ 000 and would be partly paid by the State of Connecticut . The renovations were expected to be completed by August 27 , 1997 , in time for the school 's opening . Integrated Day Charter School has a maximum enrollment of 330 students across pre @-@ kindergarten to eighth grade with a majority of children residing in the Norwich area and 15 % in nearby towns . The charter school has an application wait list and holds a lottery for admittance of pre @-@ kindergarten students . 
 Since the time of its NRHP nomination , the plant and the surrounding area have undergone numerous changes which have impacted and removed buildings . The construction of the Integrated Day Charter School removed the Research and Development and Storage Building 1 . The " Colosseum " as it was termed , was an outdoor gym which retained sides of the former building . Completed in 2008 , the two @-@ story addition created an indoor gymnasium , kitchen , offices and a new lobby for the school at a cost of $ 2 million . The renovation of the large Manufacturing building included the installation of new windows and energy @-@ efficient roofing along with the installation of modern mechanical , electrical and plumbing systems .

 The American Thermos Bottle Company Laurel Hill Plant is historically significant as the primary factory for the production of Thermos bottles that would allow the company to dominate in the world market . It is also historically significant as an example of the Norwich community coming together to attract the company and diversify the local industry . The plant was the primary factory where Thermos bottles were manufactured from raw materials between 1913 and 1984 . The complex is architecturally significant as an example of late @-@ 19th century and early 20th century industrial mill design being adapted for new industry . The American Thermos Bottle Company Laurel Hill Plant was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 . 
 = Grammy Award for Best Disco Recording = 
 The Grammy Award for Best Disco Recording was an award presented at the 22nd Grammy Awards in 1980 . The Grammy Awards , an annual ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards , are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to " honor artistic achievement , technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry , without regard to album sales or chart position " . 
 Gloria Gaynor and producers Dino Fekaris and Freddie Perren won the Best Disco Recording award for the song " I Will Survive " . However , because of a backlash against disco , the Academy discontinued the category before the 23rd Grammy Awards . In 1998 , a similar category , Best Dance Recording , began being awarded to honor vocal or instrumental dance tracks , though there were concerns that the genre would be short @-@ lived much like the disco category . 
 = = Background = = 
 Disco is a genre of dance music that emerged in the United States during the 1970s . The experimental mixing of records , combined with the newly acquired ability to play longer tracks , resulted in a genre well @-@ suited for dance parties . During 1973 – 74 , <unk> 's " Love Is the Message " displayed " early rumblings of the disco sound " , and shortly afterward the songs " Never Can Say Goodbye " by Gloria Gaynor , " The Hustle " by Van McCoy , and " Love to Love You Baby " by Donna Summer emerged . In 1977 , the opening of Studio 54 in Manhattan , and the success of the film Saturday Night Fever ( which featured John Travolta and music by the Bee Gees ) , added to the popularity of the disco genre . The following year , Paradise Garage opened in Manhattan 's West Village , the New York radio station WKTU became " all @-@ disco " , and the number of discothèques in the nation reached nearly 20 @,@ 000 . At the 21st Grammy Awards in 1979 , Saturday Night Fever : The Original Movie Sound Track , was named Album of the Year and the Bee Gees received the award for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group for their contributions to the soundtrack album . By the end of 1979 , the disco industry was estimated to be worth more than $ 4 billion , " more ... than the industries of movies , television or professional sport " . 
 However , the disco fad soon began to decline . On July 12 , 1979 , just a few months after Newsweek had reported on the " [ take ] over " of disco music , a " tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek " promotional event known as Disco Demolition Night was held at Chicago 's Comiskey Park . During a doubleheader intermission , disc jockey Steve Dahl set ablaze a bin full of disco records , causing a riot within the stadium and gaining international attention . Approximately 10 @,@ 000 disco records were destroyed , and around 50 @,@ 000 rioters participated in the event , staying on the field forcing the Chicago White Sox to forfeit the second game . 
 Nationally , a " backlash " took hold , as public support for disco music faded . According to author Craig Werner , as quoted in the British newspaper The Independent , the " anti @-@ disco movement represented an unholy alliance of <unk> and feminists , progressives and puritans , rockers and reactionaries . None the less , the attacks on disco gave respectable voice to the ugliest kinds of unacknowledged racism , sexism and homophobia . " By 1980 " mainstream disco " had ended , by 1985 WKTU had returned to playing rock music , and by the end of the decade the famous dance venues Studio 54 , Paradise Garage , and Clubhouse had all closed . 
 = = Award = = 
 In 1979 , the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences decided to add a Best Disco Recording category for the 22nd Grammy Awards , just as disco was " preparing to die " . Nominated works for the award included " Boogie Wonderland " by Earth , Wind & Fire , " I Will Survive " by Gloria Gaynor , " Don 't Stop ' til You Get Enough " by Michael Jackson , " Da Ya Think I 'm Sexy ? " by Rod Stewart , and " Dim All the Lights " by Donna Summer . On February 27 , 1980 , during a live telecast from Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles , Gaynor was presented the award for Best Disco Recording . Dino Fekaris and Freddie Perren also received awards as the producers of the track . 
 However , because of the decreasing popularity of disco , the Academy eliminated the award category before the 1981 ceremony was to be held . According to the organization , disco was " no longer a readily definable separate music form " , although its influence had " permeated all types of pop music " . Despite the award 's short span , the award helped solidify Gaynor as one of the best @-@ known female disco artists from the 1970s and the song " I Will Survive " as one of the most recognized and top @-@ selling songs from the genre . 
 Another dance category did not emerge until 1998 when the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording began to honor vocal or instrumental dance tracks , though there were concerns that the award would be short @-@ lived much like the disco category . In 2003 , the Academy moved the category from the " Pop " field into a new " Dance " field , which currently contains the category Best Electronica / Dance Album as well . 
 = Constantin Al . Ionescu @-@ Caion = 
 Constantin Al . Ionescu @-@ Caion ( Romanian pronunciation : [ <unk> al <unk> <unk> ] , born Constantin Alexandru Ionescu and commonly known as Caion ; 1882 – November or December 1918 ) was a Romanian journalist and poet , primarily remembered for his legal dispute with humorist Ion Luca Caragiale . He was a Symbolist , a disciple of Alexandru Macedonski , and a militant Francophile , as well as a leading opponent of literary tradition . His scattered work comprises essays , short stories and prose poetry , noted for their cultural references , but made little impact on Romanian literature . As a journalist , Caion prioritized scandals , accusing Caragiale of plagiarism and losing the subsequent celebrity trial of 1902 , before partly recanting and winning the retrial . Despite his own <unk> with nationalism , Caion focused his verve on Transylvania 's contemporary nationalist literary current . 
 Ionescu @-@ Caion was the founder of several magazines , most notably Românul Literar . Originally conceived as a literary supplement for the daily Românul , it became a tribune of Macedonski 's Romanian Symbolist movement , and helped discover George Bacovia , the celebrated modern poet . During World War I , when he oscillated between the two opposing camps , Caion put out the journal Cronicarul . This was his last known activity in the Romanian press . 
 A contradictory figure , Caion was equated with infamy and ridicule in the Romanian context , and his evidently unsubstantiated allegations against Caragiale have traditionally puzzled literary historians . In Transylvania , the word Caion was for a while synonymous with yellow journalist . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early career = = = 
 Little is recorded about Caion 's roots , other than that he was a devout Roman Catholic , and a regular presence at Saint Joseph Cathedral . He had a very early debut in cultural journalism . After 1897 , when he was 15 , his literary chroniclers saw print in several newspapers , under various pseudonyms such as C. A. I. Nică <unk> , Ion <unk> , Marin <unk> , <unk> <unk> . <unk> , Roman <unk> , among others . In January 1898 , he was employed by Adevărul daily , covering the Romanian tour of Sâr Péladan . Péladan , a writer , mystic and self @-@ styled mage , failed to impress the young reporter , who reported on his various claims with a note of irony . Also then , he affiliated with Macedonski 's eclectic art magazine Literatorul ( known during the period as Revista Literară ) . Interested in the Roman Empire , he published with Literatorul a comparative biography of Julius Caesar and Augustus , republished as a book by Carol Göbl of Bucharest . 
 Also in 1898 , Ionescu @-@ Caion completed his adaptation of Jonathan Swift 's Gulliver , published by the Adevărul collection Biblioteca <unk> as Trei ani de <unk> : O <unk> <unk> ( " Three Years of Suffering : A Strange Voyage " ) . It came with Caion 's own critical study of Swift . According to <unk> Mihaela <unk> , Caion , " a famous journalist and a minor writer " , was thus the first Romanian to publish an essay on Swift , albeit one that was " not very sophisticated " ; she also notes that the translation added a sexual twist to some of Gulliver 's adventures . Caion published other such translations with Biblioteca <unk> , rendering works by Thomas Bailey Aldrich , Louis Henri <unk> , Henry de <unk> , Louis <unk> and others . 
 Under contract with Adevărul ( 1899 ) , Caion published his translation from Prosper Castanier novellas , dealing with " Roman decadence " . Writing in 2011 , critic Angelo <unk> suggested that Caion 's introduction to the volume exaggerated Castanier 's merits , but was still " interesting " for showing the popularity of " <unk> " in 1890s Romania : Caion 's argument was that Rome fell victim to " Asiatic luxury " and sophisticated sexuality ( " orgies " ) . Caion 's own texts on the subject of decadence were published as booklets by the French company <unk> Frères . His bibliography for 1899 includes the essay <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " Conversations on Art " ) , and , also with Adevărul , a selection of his own novellas . 
 Not much is known about Caion 's other involvements , other than that he attended the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters , in the same year as fellow journalist Eugen Porn . Although living in the capital , he maintained links with the youth of Iași , and published alongside I. I. <unk> in the high school magazine C. Negruzzi . His work included an essay about the works of the eponymous novelist . A " Constantin Ionescu " , whom literary historian Victor <unk> tentatively identifies as the future Caion , was arrested by Romanian Police on Calea <unk> , Bucharest , during the breakup of a student nationalist rally ( September 13 , 1894 ) . He was still enlisted at the University in 1899 , when he organized a charity event to benefit the impoverished schoolchildren of <unk> . 
 = = = Symbolist beginnings = = = 
 Despite his subsequent involvement in various scandals , Ionescu @-@ Caion was not universally perceived as a mediocre journalist . Historian Lucian Boia notes that he " was not without merit as a publicist . " Around the year 1900 , Caion became a sympathizer of the Romanian Symbolist movement , whose leader was the poet Macedonski . Attached by philologist Ștefan <unk> to a " Secessionist " current in Romanian literature , Caion made himself noted for a prose poem entirely dedicated to his lover 's hair ( a recurring theme in Symbolist literature , taken to extremes by the Romanian author ) . A regular presence in Macedonski 's house , Caion mounted a campaign to promote minor Romanian Symbolist authors in France . As noted by critics , the French contacts were themselves fringe magazines , with Legitimist and Traditionalist Catholic agendas . 
 Caion had an enduring interest in history and , in 1900 , completed his monograph on Wallachian Prince Gheorghe Bibescu . Titled <unk> <unk> lui Bibescu ( " On Bibescu 's Reign " ) , it was first published as an addendum to Georges Bibesco 's pamphlet , O <unk> ( " An Execution " ) . Bibesco , the Prince 's destitute son , continued to employ Caion as his defender and co @-@ author : in 1901 , they published an <unk> work on the subject of Bibescu family grievances against the modern Romanian establishment . In tandem , Caion publicized his comparison of historical and psychological determinism , with a topical booklet . His first synthesis , <unk> <unk> ( " Historical Studies " ) , was also available in 1901 . 
 Caion also affiliated with the eclectic journal Noua Revistă Română , where he published historical documents of dubious authenticity and , in 1902 , the essay Din <unk> . <unk> <unk> ( " From the Shadows . Antique Morals " ) . From 1900 to 1903 , he was employed by the Bucharest Conservatory , lecturing in " selective world history " , and publishing his conferences as a university textbook . 
 According to at least one account , Caion first encountered Caragiale 's irony when he sent him a couple of Symbolist poems . The senior writer picked up on their involuntary humor , and proceeded to ridicule Caion . Literary historian Tudor Vianu believes that Caion was especially infuriated when Caragiale 's magazine , <unk> Român , made a public mockery of his Secessionist prose poem . In his <unk> , Caragiale feigned enthusiasm about the young writer 's debut . Parodying Caion , he suggested that the young poet carry on writing a " lyrical @-@ decadent @-@ symbolist @-@ mystical @-@ capillary @-@ secessionist " novel about a hairdressers ' art society , whose members glue strands of hair onto canvasses or carve soap into human figures . 
 = = = Caragiale scandal = = = 
 Caion followed an elaborate recipe for revenge , with exposes in the Symbolist Revista Literară review , of which he was by then the co @-@ editor . The owner , Th . M. Stoenescu , had been Caragiale 's adversary since the 1880s . Described by Vianu as " a real pathological character " , Caion claimed to expose Caragiale 's drama , Năpasta , as plagiarized . In his report , Caion suggested that the real author was a Hungarian , Kemény Istvan — who , in fact , never existed . In order to back his claim , Caion published quotes from Năpasta alongside a supposed translation from Kemény . Reading these fragments in good faith , Caragiale was astonished by what he took to be a bizarre coincidence . 
 Macedonski followed the developments with enthusiasm , granting further exposure to Caion 's claims . For Macedonski , the young accuser embodied " the aspiration for beauty " , " the new aesthetics " , " courage and selflessness " . As commentators have suggested , the poet responded to Caragiale 's satires of him and his Symbolist salon , and attacking , in Caragiale , the entire anti @-@ Symbolist club Junimea . At Revista Literară , Stoenescu began suspecting a canard , and asked Caion to present further proof for his accusations . The latter produced two sheets printed in Romanian Cyrillic , which reportedly included fragments from an 1884 Romanian translation . Unconvinced , the editor promptly suspended his collaboration with Caion . The latter soon changed his statements , arguing that " Kemény " was a pseudonym used by Leo Tolstoy , and that Caragiale was guilty of copying The Power of Darkness . 
 Although Stoenescu was a disciple of his , Macedonski favored Caion in this dispute , and employed him to write more denunciations of Caragiale in the magazine <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> expanded on the initial accusations , claiming to have discovered an entire history of plagiarism in Caragiale 's writings ( from Victorien Sardou to Alfred <unk> ) . Following Macedonski 's intercession , Caion was also supported by the historian Grigore Tocilescu , who made Caragiale the sole topic of his Romanian Atheneum conference ( January 24 , 1902 ) . 
 Românul newspaper , put out by the entrepreneur Vintilă Rosetti as an anti @-@ Junimist outlet , also stood by Caion . Its columnist , N. Ținc , had prepared a piece describing Caragiale and his Junimist colleagues as obsessed with their own role in culture . Unpublished until 2006 , Ținc 's article noted that " the poor Caion " had unwittingly struck a blow against " the youngest , sickest and therefore most innocent of the [ Junimea ] megalomaniacs . " Rosetti 's paper was hosting its own campaign against Caragiale , headed by Caragiale 's former employer Frédéric <unk> . Meanwhile , Caragiale found his core group of journalist sympathizers in the Junimist fief of Moldavia . 
 Caragiale had by then proceeded to research the matter on his own , and came to the independent conclusion that the accusations were entirely concocted . Late in 1901 , he opened a legal case against both Caion and Stoenescu , taken up by the Ilfov County court . On the first day , Caion excused himself as sick , while Stoenescu recused himself , taking the prosecution 's side . For these reasons , the trial was held without a jury . 
 Caragiale 's legal representative was the fellow writer Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea , who systematically disproved Caion 's allegations , and noted that the absentee defendant was guilty of numerous forgeries . He also convinced the judge that the similarities between Năpasta and The Power of Darkness were superficial . The court found Ionescu @-@ Caion guilty of slander . He was sentenced to a three @-@ month jail term , a 500 lei fine and 10 @,@ 000 lei in court costs . However , he appealed the tribunal 's decision . The jury selection was a laborious process : Caion 's lawyer Danielopol recused writers Nicolae Iorga and Ovid Densusianu , alleging that all Romanian literati had a vested interest to defend plagiarism . Iorga took offense , and reportedly challenged Danielopol to a duel . During the proceedings , Caion backed up on the original accusations , explaining that he had only invented a reason to bring Caragiale in for a trial . The court eventually acquitted Caion . 
 Caragiale showed little surprise at the news . In an interview with poet Alexandru <unk> , he explained his conflict with Caion in paternalistic terms : " They did well not to sentence the kid . Is he the guilty party ? No ! Caion is merely a victim . Say I were a juror : why would I be setting an example by punishing this unreasonable and irresponsible kid , for those who are more mature and better placed , and who employ the same means as he did ? " The general public was by then firmly on Caragiale 's side , and Macedonski 's reputation suffered greatly as a result , increasing his isolation on the literary scene . 
 = = = Românul Literar = = = 
 Caion was still carrying on as a publicist and historian , with a study about the ancient <unk> . It was simultaneously published in Paris and Bucharest ( 1901 ) . That year , with Carol Göbl press , he also published a devotional text , <unk> , fragment ( " Jesus , A Fragment " ) . The theme of decadence continued to fuel Caion 's essays : in Carmen magazine ( September 1902 ) , he covered Castanier 's Lotus du Gange , implicitly advertising the book 's lewd content and titillating illustrations . His take on the Caragiale affair was outlined in the Carol Göbl essay <unk> <unk> în 1902 ( " Literary Morals as of 1902 " ) . 
 In 1903 , Caion himself began working at Românul , where he was an editor , corresponding with Vintilă Rosetti over the newspaper 's publicity deals . He returned to belles @-@ lettres with a 1903 short story , <unk> . His fiction reflected his growing interest in Early Christianity , illustrated by another story , itself published in 1903 : Pentru cruce ( " For the Cross " ) . This was followed in 1904 by a volume of " Christian short stories " , <unk> <unk> , which he submitted for consideration to the Romanian Academy awards committee . Christian subjects infused his parallel work for the stage , as well as his historical research . In 1904 , he published a Byzantine @-@ themed tragedy , <unk> <unk> ( " Legionaries of the Cross " ) , and an essay on " The Rivalry between Jesus and Saint John the Baptist " ( La <unk> de Jésus et de saint Jean @-@ Baptiste ) . 
 A split occurred at Românul in late 1904 : on January 10 , 1905 , Caion issued Românul Literar as a separate weekly , announcing to the world that all his links to Românul had been severed ( this even though Românul Literar 's first issue was introduced as " Issue 1 , Year 3 " ) . The director himself signed the column Note <unk> ( " Critical Notes " ) , and four others which reviewed books local and foreign ; they were collected in book form in 1905 . Caion 's sheet was irregularly published for the next three years , and , in December 1908 , became a tri @-@ monthly . 
 Românul Literar was a voice of anti @-@ nationalist and anti @-@ traditionalist sentiment , rejecting the school formed around Sămănătorul magazine , and promoting the Symbolists ; its agenda has been summarized as " anti @-@ Sămănătorist " , and in step with modern French literature . It played host to many Romanian writers , most of them Romanian Symbolists : Macedonski , Mihail <unk> , Mircea <unk> , Al . <unk> , Dumitru " Karr " Karnabatt , Eugeniu <unk> , Caton <unk> , alongside the <unk> <unk> <unk> and I. C. Popescu @-@ <unk> . <unk> , who joined the literary club while still a high school student , recalls being impressed by Caion 's status as " a literary historian and critic " , " his restrained demeanor and his intelligence , with its inscrutable pursuits . " However , Caion seemed " ill and troubled " , and had " an unnatural and mean passion for going after those people who had made a name for themselves in our cultural life " , with his " venomous weaponry " . Other Symbolists took distance : Moldavian poet and literary reviewer Ștefan <unk> made a mockery of Caion , exposing him as a <unk> amateur . 
 In addition to receiving contributions directly from France , Românul Literar published translations of poems by Frédéric Mistral ( translator : Elena Văcărescu ) , Jean <unk> ( <unk> ) and Albert <unk> ( Popescu @-@ <unk> ) . Other than poetry and fiction , Românul Literar hosted literary and scientific essays , including ones by Caion , Ținc , Ioan <unk> , Orest <unk> and others . The journal also enlisted contributions from poetess Cornelia " Riria " <unk> and her husband , the formerly Junimist historian A. D. Xenopol . Românul Literar 's founder was especially enthusiastic about Riria . Against mainstream critics , who derided her poetry as stale and ungrammatical , he proclaimed the dawn of a new era , with Mrs. Xenopol as its herald . Caion , Tocilescu and the <unk> were members of a small professional association , called " Romanian Society for Arts and Literature " . 
 Around 1907 , Caion 's paper was hosting poems by the young Symbolist author George Bacovia ( including " Sonnet " and " <unk> " ) and art chronicles by Theodor Cornel . Bacovia described their first encounter , in November 1903 , as follows : " Caion [ ... ] was very depressed after his recently completed trial with Caragiale . My solitary presence , without any sort of recommendation from another author , made him receive me with significant reserve . I then communicated the purpose of my arrival , asking for the address of his collaborator , the poet Macedonski . Nevertheless , he still asked me for a handful of poems , the ones later published by his magazine . " 
 = = = Caion and the Transylvanians = = = 
 Ionescu @-@ Caion was unrelenting in his accusations of plagiarism , and a section of the press , in both Romania and abroad , still credited him as a whistle @-@ blower . His Romanian supporters called him a David fending off Caragiale @-@ Goliath , while the Revue de Paris referred to his stances as " courageous " . By that time , the formerly nationalist journalist had made himself new enemies outside the Junimea circles . These were ethnic Romanian writers from Transylvania , region that was then still part of Austria @-@ Hungary , including many traditionalists published by Sămănătorul . Early signs of this conflict showed up during the Caragiale trials , when Caion and Macedonski nominated Sămănătorul founding figure George Coșbuc as another successful plagiarist . Around the same time , he reputedly stated that Transylvanian literature was " a monstrous apparition " . 
 Caion 's dispute with the Transylvanian poets covered several fronts . In 1905 , his newspaper joyfully announced that Ștefan Octavian Iosif ( whom he called by his <unk> legal name , István Gábor József ) had been expelled from the Romanian academic scholarship program . According to Caion , Octavian Goga 's father @-@ in @-@ law , politician <unk> Cosma , was " the tyrant of Transylvania " , and Coșbuc 's ally , the literary chronicler Ilarie Chendi , was a " Romanianized " Hungarian , with little authority in local literature . These reactions did not prevent Caion from becoming a co @-@ author of the first Transylvanian ( and Romanian ) encyclopedic dictionary , put together by Cornelius <unk> . To the indignation of other Transylvanians , " Ionescu @-@ Caion , C. A. , publicist , Bucharest " is a contributor of historical entries in <unk> 's second tome . 
 The ideological conflict involved various aspects of literary theory and activism , including the differences of opinion about reforming the literary language . Transylvanian political leader Alexandru Vaida @-@ Voevod noted that the <unk> dialect favored in the Old Kingdom was symptomatic , since " Caion and the likes " were popularly identified as the literary professionals . Linguist <unk> <unk> also commended Transylvanian literati for standing up to the " unhealthy currents " promoted by Caion , Macedonski and Karnabatt . 
 Caion 's indignation reached a peak in September 1909 , when the Romanian Writers ' Society ( SSR ) was officially established as a compromise between the Symbolists and the Transylvanians , doing away with the Romanian Society for Arts and Literature . In Românul Literar , Caion described the club as a mass of " <unk> " , concluding : " With the likes of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Demetrius [ that is : A. de Herz , Chendi , I. Dragoslav and Vasile Demetrius ] , for sure the new society shall uproot the old one , where one comes across respectable people such as A. D. Xenopol , Riria , N. <unk> , Pompiliu Eliade , Gr [ <unk> ] Tocilescu etc . " Another controversy shook the literary community when the SSR decided to exclude those authors who could not prove their belonging to the Romanian ethnic group . Although Românul Literar was itself suspected of antisemitism , Caion decided to stand by the Jewish Romanians who were thus excluded . In a March 1910 article , he sided with the Noua Revistă Română owner Constantin Rădulescu @-@ Motru ( a critic of antisemitism ) and journalist Eugen Porn ( a Jew ) , noting that Porn 's acceptance into Romanian literature was at least as justified as Ilarie Chendi 's . 
 Românul Literar tried to keep up with the latest developments in literary form , and Caion was among the first Romanian reviewers of Futurism . However , the paper went out of print in January 1911 . It was reestablished as a bi @-@ monthly on November 1 , and again ceased publication in December . It was restored a third and final time in June 1912 , but went out of business soon after . 
 Meanwhile , Caion focused on his Francophile essays , writing about the French influence on Romania . The fragment <unk> <unk> mai <unk> ( " Older French Influences " ) saw print in the " encyclopedic magazine " <unk> , whose director was Nicolae G. Rădulescu @-@ Niger , the comedic poet . With Riria and the Symbolists , Caion began putting out a French @-@ language literary journal , called La Revue Roumaine ( first issue : February 1912 ) . The Transylvanian rivals at Luceafărul were unimpressed . According to them , La Revue Roumaine was beneath all other Francophone periodicals , either Romanian or Hungarian , unwitting evidence of " the inferiority and impotence of our [ national ] literature " . 
 When , in 1912 , Macedonski made his publicized return to literary life , the Transylvanians reacted with astonishment . In Arad , the journalist Ovidiu <unk> covered the comeback of " an enemy " as " Caion 's triumph " . He believed that the Symbolist offensive was presided upon and propagated by Caion , under the slogan : " I cursed , I <unk> , I vanquished . " Caion himself focused on his academic career , and , in 1913 , took his Ph.D. with the thesis <unk> nouă în viața politică și <unk> a <unk> <unk> și <unk> <unk> <unk> noastră ( " New Directions in France 's Political and Cultural Life and their Influence on Us " ) . It was published , in 1914 , by Poporul <unk> . 
 = = = World War I and death = = = 
 By the start of World War I , while Romania was still neutral territory , Caion supported France and the other Entente Powers . He was " a Francophile to the uttermost " ( according to Boia ) , publishing the booklet <unk> <unk> în istoria <unk> ( " France 's Role in World History " ) . Two other books on this subject saw print in 1915 : Gallia și <unk> ei ( " Gaul and Her Influences " ) , <unk> contre <unk> ( " Sparta against Athens " ) . As noted by a <unk> Literar columnist , Caion did not glorify the French Republic , but was rather a fan of the Ancien Régime . Caion cited a wealth of French authors , even obscure ones ( " who would not be great were they not the intellectual friends of the author " ) , to prove that German culture was " anarchic and worthless " . 
 The Central Powers ' invasion of Romania surprised Caion and made him reconsider his options . He stayed behind in occupied Bucharest , and , as Germany 's victory seemed certain and Romania signed the Peace of Bucharest , timidly embraced the " Germanophile " cause . From August 17 , 1918 , Ionescu @-@ Caion put out the magazine Cronicarul ( " The Chronicler " ) , which enlisted contributions from noted Germanophile writers , such as Gala Galaction and <unk> <unk> . Its theater chronicler , Radu <unk> , was among the first to cover the <unk> Summer Theater of Isidor Goldenberg , a mainstay of Yiddish dramaturgy in Romania . Another Cronicarul employee was the female journalist Aida <unk> , who became Caion 's friend and , in time , his apologist . 
 The magazine , noted by Boia for its " high literary standing " , publicized Caion 's reformed views about the course of the war . He wrote that the new Germanophile Prime Minister , Alexandru Marghiloman , embodied " Romania 's national energy " , much like the figures in Thomas Carlyle 's On Heroes . His stances , like those of Marghiloman , had their dose of ambiguity . As Marghiloman recounts , Caion circulated an anti @-@ German manifesto put out by the revolutionary Social Democrats and the " Socialist Women of Romania " . Moreover , Caion still revered the anti @-@ Germanophile Xenopol . In issue 27 of Cronicarul , he referred to Xenopol 's memoirs as a masterpiece of Romanian prose . 
 Caion died only a few months later , in liberated Romania . As Lucian Boia notes , he had lived long enough to see all prophecies about a German victory being nullified by the November 1918 Armistice . According to bibliographer and educator Tudor <unk> , his was a " heroic death " , which served to clear his tarnished reputation .

 The various scandals involving Constantin Al . Ionescu @-@ Caion have left distinct marks on Romania 's cultural life . Boia writes : " Caion [ ... ] secured himself an unwanted fame in the history of Romanian literature " . In early 20th @-@ century Transylvania , " Caion " was adapted into a common noun and a term of contempt . Listing its " <unk> " enemies , Luceafărul noted the existence of " all sorts of <unk> , those little puppies raised by the obscure magazines . " Also in Luceafărul , priest @-@ publicist Alexandru <unk> stated : " We live in the epoch of the <unk> , for whom all things are permitted " . Caion 's poor reputation also rubbed off on Macedonski : Caragiale 's disciple Alexandru <unk> coined the word <unk> , as a hybrid of both writers . 
 The scandal continued to reverberate , and Caion soon earned condemnation from critics not directly involved in the early 20th @-@ century disputes . A liberal and a modernist , Eugen Lovinescu , dismissed Caion 's entire career in letters as a footnote . It likened Caion to a " squid " that leaves behind " a long trail of ink " , and judged his brand of literary criticism to have been " one of the illnesses of that time . " In contrast , Cronicarul 's <unk> spoke of her friend 's attack on Caragiale as a " mistake " , noting that his career from 1901 was of genuine importance . Caion , she writes , created " true works of art " , without sparing a thought for " glory or money . " 
 According to literary historian Alexandru Dobrescu , Caion is the prototype " detractor " in Romanian culture , " born of frustration " , the <unk> to Caragiale 's Homer . Dobrescu writes : " In the common definition , the detractor is someone consciously working to debase ( or destroy ) one 's good standing . The cobbler envious of his neighbor , the cordwainer , who will go lengths to <unk> the latter in hopes of ' helping ' him lose his clientele , is a detractor . " His verdict about Caion 's unicity in a Romanian context is placed in doubt by another author , Constantin <unk> , who finds it unrealistic . 
 Various commentators believe that Caragiale 's ultimate relocation to Germany was at least in part prompted by the Caion affair . This was notably suggested by Caragiale 's actor friend , Ion <unk> . Moreover , literary rivals as well as third parties have noted that Caion 's <unk> shed focus from his own dubious creative methods . In his speech of 1902 , Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea openly accused Caion of forging historical records during his stint at Noua Revistă Română . More than fifty years after the fact , Ștefan <unk> discovered that the poems Caion claimed to have authored , and which Caragiale found especially entertaining , were in fact poor @-@ quality translations from Charles Baudelaire . 
 In 2007 Ionescu @-@ Caion 's name was returned to circulation , amidst allegations of plagiarism brought up against philosopher Gabriel Liiceanu . Writer Andrei <unk> defended Liiceanu against his accusers at Ziua daily , and argued that Romania was still " Caion 's land " . Noting that Caion had entered press history with a <unk> ( " yokel 's deed " ) , <unk> described Ziua journalism as partisanship and " hysteria " , assessing that Romania was going through " an epileptic fit " . Liiceanu critic Gheorghe Grigurcu also took distance from the Ziua accusers , noting that their " libel " , " puerile " in content , made it hard to sustain a serious debate about Liiceanu 's faults . 
 = = = Other literary echoes = = = 
 Caion 's presence at the center of literary and political controversies was treated with much sarcasm by his various peers , even before the 1901 face @-@ off . In addition to the " lyrical @-@ decadent @-@ symbolist @-@ mystical @-@ capillary @-@ secessionist " parody , Caragiale may have attacked Caion in an 1899 <unk> sketch , as Superintendent Lazăr Ionescu @-@ Lion . Both writers were satirized in a revue , officially written by restaurateur G. A. Mandy ( but probably authored by Rădulescu @-@ Niger ) . The work focuses on the 1901 stock market panic and its political consequences in Romania ; Caragiale ( as <unk> ) and Caion ( Crayon ) appear alongside scheming politicians or journalists — Take Ionescu , George D. Pallade , Luigi <unk> — and the runaway embezzler Andrei <unk> . 
 The legal scandal between Caion and Caragiale is traditionally considered one of Romania 's most famous trials . The legal professionals ' magazine Curierul <unk> and lawyer @-@ editor Octav Minar published the court records in its Biblioteca <unk> <unk> ( " Great Trials Library " ) , May – June 1924 . Theater scholar Cristian <unk> finds Delavrancea 's plea not just a " shattering " proof of erudition , but also a guide to understanding the issues of artistic personality and intellectual property . As a personal witness of the proceedings , <unk> noted that Delavrancea spoke like a modern Demosthenes . 
 " Caion " was a breakthrough role for Gheorghe <unk> , ensuring his move from stagehand to award @-@ winning thespian . This was in a 1962 stage reconstruction by David <unk> , with Jules <unk> playing Caragiale and Mircea <unk> as Delavrancea . Among the many volumes dealing with the legal face @-@ off is a stageplay by dramaturge and critic Romulus <unk> , first published in 1972 . 
 = Bobo Holloman = 
 Alva Lee " Bobo " Holloman ( March 7 , 1923 – May 1 , 1987 ) was an American right @-@ handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for one season in the American League with the St. Louis Browns in 1953 . In 22 career games , Holloman pitched 65 @.@ 1 innings and posted a win @-@ loss record of 3 – 7 and a 5 @.@ 23 earned run average ( ERA ) . 
 Born in Thomaston , Georgia , Holloman served in World War II before starting his professional baseball career . From 1946 to 1952 , he gradually rose up the minor leagues , and got a spring training invitation from the Chicago Cubs in 1950 . After the 1952 season , he was acquired by the St. Louis Browns , who placed him on the major league roster . He made his debut April 18 , and in his first start on May 6 , he threw a no @-@ hitter , one of three players to do so in his first start . Holloman pitched in 22 games that season for the Browns before being sold to a minor league team . He spent the rest of 1953 and 1954 in the minors before retiring from the game . After retiring , he ran an advertising agency and worked as a scout before his death in 1987 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Holloman was born in Thomaston , Georgia , and moved to Athens , Georgia with his family when he was 17 . In Athens , he met Nan Stevens , the two were married on January 24 , 1942 , and they later had one son . He served as a Seabee for the United States Navy during World War II . After returning from the war , Holloman became an apprentice in a machine shop for the Georgia Railroad in Macon , Georgia . While working there , he played amateur baseball , and did well enough for his colleagues to convince him to try out for the Macon Peaches , the local baseball team . He did so , and he was assigned to the Class D Moultrie Packers , where he began his professional career . 
 = = Minor league career = = 
 Holloman began his professional baseball career by recording a 20 – 5 record and a 2 @.@ 33 ERA for the Packers as a rookie in the Class D Georgia – Florida League in 1946 . He played winter baseball in Cuba , then had a record of 18 – 17 for the Macon Peaches of the Sally League the next year . He started the 1948 season with Macon , then after winning eight games he was promoted to the Nashville Volunteers of the Class AA Southern Association , where he posted seven wins and two losses . While there , Volunteers owner Larry Gilbert gave him the nickname Bobo because the pitcher reminded him of Bobo Newsom ; the nickname stuck with him the rest of his career . 
 In 1949 , Holloman again spent the season with the Volunteers , posting a record of 17 – 10 with a 4 @.@ 46 ERA . After the season ended , the Chicago Cubs signed him and gave him an invitation to spring training . Holloman 's outgoing nature clashed with manager Frankie Frisch , who did not appreciate the pitcher 's attitude . It was , partially , for this reason that Holloman did not make the major league roster . Holloman split the 1950 season between Nashville and the Shreveport Sports of the Texas League . Combined , he had 13 wins and 13 losses on the year . In 1951 , he spent seven games with Nashville , but spent most of the season with the Augusta Tigers of the Sally League , where he posted an 11 – 9 record and a 3 @.@ 87 ERA . 
 The following season , Augusta sold his contract to the Syracuse Chiefs of the AAA International League , and he posted a 16 – 7 record and a 2 @.@ 51 ERA with the team . After the season ended , he played winter baseball in Puerto Rico for the Cangrejeros de Santurce . With Santurce , he had a 15 – 5 record during the regular season . After the season ended , he participated in the 1953 Caribbean Series , and won two of the six games Santurce played , allowing them to win the title . 
 = = Major Leagues and later life = = 
 In October 1952 , Holloman was signed by the St. Louis Browns after they traded Duke Markell and $ 35 @,@ 000 to acquire him . Heading into the season , manager Marty Marion was high on him , considering him to be a pitcher who could have won 20 games with Syracuse the year prior had he not missed time due to an appendectomy . 
 Holloman made his major league debut on April 14 in a relief appearance . He made in three additional relief appearances afterward , allowing five runs in 5 ⅓ innings through his first four games . As a result , Holloman asked Marion for a start , claiming he was better in that role , and if he was just going to be used as a relief pitcher , he should be sold to another team . Marion gave in , and put him in for a home game on May 6 against the Philadelphia Athletics . On a rainy night before a crowd of 2 @,@ 473 at Sportsman 's Park , Holloman threw a no @-@ hitter in his first major league start . He had two hits as a batter , and recorded three strikeouts en route to the 6 – 0 victory . 
 Holloman is one of three pitchers to throw a no @-@ hitter in their first major league start . The others were Ted Breitenstein , who accomplished the feat in 1891 , and Bumpus Jones , who did so in 1892 . However , Breitenstein and Jones threw their no @-@ hitters before the 1893 rule change that moved the pitcher 's delivery point back to 60 feet , 6 inches from home plate . 
 The no @-@ hitter cemented Holloman 's spot in the starting rotation for the next month . In his next start against the Athletics , he lasted barely an inning , allowing two runs and three walks before leaving the game due to a blistered finger . His next win came on May 28 against the Cleveland Indians , but his third win did not come until a month later against the Boston Red Sox , where he allowed two hits in eight innings of work . Outside of the three wins , however , Holloman was ineffective ; in 22 games , 10 of them starts , Holloman had a 3 – 7 record with a 5 @.@ 23 ERA , 25 strikeouts , and 50 walks . As a result , after his final appearance on July 19 , the Browns put him on waivers , and he was sold to the Toronto Maple Leafs . 
 Holloman finished the 1953 season with Toronto , and had a 4 – 3 record in 13 games . In 1954 , Holloman 's last professional season , he spent time on five different minor league squads , including former stops Toronto and Augusta , before retiring . The retirement was partially due to a sore arm , the result of pitching too frequently while playing winter ball . After retiring , Holloman became a truck driver and ran an advertising agency , and served as a scout for the Baltimore Orioles . He also turned to drinking for many years , but was able to overcome the addiction . He died on May 1 , 1987 at the age of 64 in Athens , Georgia of a heart attack .

 Davison House ( officially the Eliza Davison House ) is a five @-@ story dormitory on the campus of Vassar College in the town of Poughkeepsie , New York . Designed by Boston architecture firm Allen & Vance and built 1902 , it was the fourth dorm built on Vassar 's residential quadrangle .

 = = History = = 
 Davison House was the fourth residential quadrangle ( quad ) dormitory to be built on the campus Vassar College in the town of Poughkeepsie , New York . Construction of Davison came during a period of rapid dorm @-@ building spanning 1893 – 1902 during which the older seminary @-@ style model of housing — a single large hall in which all a college 's residents lived , in Vassar 's case Main Building — was quickly waning in popularity in favor of smaller individual houses . The project began with the opening of Strong House in 1893 and continued with Raymond House in 1897 , Lathrop House in 1901 , and finally Davison in 1902 . 
 Davison House was built with funds provided by magnate and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller , then a trustee at the college . Named in honor of his mother as the Eliza Davison House , it was the third structure at Vassar that Rockefeller paid for , after Strong House and Rockefeller Hall . 
 <unk> replaced Davison 's roof in 1960 and new windows were installed in 1980 . A new staircase on the side of the dorm facing away from the quad was built in 2005 . The dorm underwent a major renovation during the 2008 – 2009 school year , reopening at the beginning of the 2009 – 2010 academic year . The renovation included plans for upgraded accessibility , including an elevator and disabled @-@ accessible bathrooms and doors , making it Vassar 's first dorm to offer those features . 
 = = Architecture and features = = 
 Davison was designed by the Boston architectural firm of Francis Richmond Allen and J. McArthur Vance who were also responsible for the design of its neighbor , Lathrop House , in 1901 . <unk> a design for these two buildings was not difficult as a template had already been set by way of the preexisting Strong and Raymond Houses . Frederick Law Olmsted , a consultant of design for the college , recommended that any new dorms in the area be built in an " echelon formation " in order to provide for a greater sense of openness . Allen disregarded this advice , instead opting to place the dorm , along with Lathrop , in " two long unbroken rows of buildings on the bias " . Davison was ultimately placed north of Raymond , across the quad to the west of Lathrop , and diagonally across from Strong . 
 Standing a total of five stories tall with an additional basement level , Davison is an Elizabethan brick building . It is capped with a pitched Pennsylvania slate roof and five chimneys , each multiple wythes thick . Several cupolas also jut from the roof , each fitted with louvers . The dorm features elements of brownstone trim and brownstone @-@ capped brick parapets . Inside the building , dorm room floors are made of wood paneling . Walls are painted cream and fifth floor rooms feature sloped ceilings and inlaid skylights . Bathrooms have tile floors and marble sinks , while communal spaces utilize motion @-@ sensing lighting technology . 
 The house is co @-@ ed and currently has a capacity of 191 students . Residents of Davison , which houses students of all grades , may live in either single rooms , one @-@ room doubles , or three @-@ room triples with bathrooms being shared by all members of a hall . The dorm has a kitchen , a parlor abutting the quad , and , as of 2011 , its basement was a frequent practice space for student bands . In a 2005 guide to the school published by College Prowler , Davison was named one of the three best dorms at Vassar , along with Main and Jewett . 
 = Blink @-@ 182 = 
 Blink @-@ 182 ( often stylized as blink @-@ 182 ) is an American rock band formed in Poway , California in 1992 . The band currently consists of bassist and vocalist Mark Hoppus , drummer Travis Barker , and guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba . Founded by Hoppus , guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge , and drummer Scott Raynor , the band emerged from the Southern California punk scene of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high @-@ energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor . Blink @-@ 182 was initially known as Blink until an Irish band of the same name threatened legal action ; the band appended the meaningless number " <unk> " . 
 In its early years , Blink @-@ 182 toured heavily behind the band 's debut , Cheshire Cat ( 1995 ) . The group signed with major label MCA Records to co @-@ distribute its second album , Dude Ranch ( 1997 ) . Raynor was fired midway through a 1998 tour and replaced by Barker . The group 's next two releases , Enema of the State ( 1999 ) and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket ( 2001 ) , were enormous successes on the strength of radio and MTV airplay . The eponymously titled Blink @-@ 182 followed in 2003 and marked a stylistic shift for the group . DeLonge quit in 2005 , sending the band into what was termed an " indefinite hiatus " . They reunited in 2009 , producing the trio 's sixth album , Neighborhoods ( 2011 ) . In 2015 , DeLonge again exited and was replaced by Alkaline Trio guitarist and vocalist Matt Skiba . The band 's seventh studio album , California , was released on July 1 , 2016 . 
 Blink @-@ 182 is considered a key group in the development of pop punk ; the band 's combination of pop melodies with fast @-@ paced punk rock featured a more radio @-@ friendly accessibility than prior bands . The trio has sold over thirteen million albums in the United States , and over 35 million albums worldwide . In 2011 , The New York Times asserted , " no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink @-@ 182 , " and even as the band receded after its 2005 split , " its sound and style could be heard in the muscular pop punk of Fall Out Boy or in the current wave of high @-@ gloss Warped Tour punk bands , like All Time Low and The Maine . " 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Formation and early years ( 1992 – 94 ) = = = 
 Blink @-@ 182 was formed in Poway , California , a suburb outside of San Diego , in August 1992 . Tom DeLonge was expelled from Poway High for attending a basketball game drunk and was forced to attend another local school for one semester . At Rancho Bernardo High School , DeLonge performed at a Battle of the Bands competition , where he was introduced to drummer Scott Raynor . He also befriended Kerry Key , who too was interested in punk music . Key 's girlfriend , Anne Hoppus , introduced her brother Mark Hoppus — who had recently moved from Ridgecrest to work at a record store and attend college — to DeLonge on August 1 , 1992 . The two clicked instantly and played for hours in DeLonge 's garage , exchanging lyrics and co @-@ writing songs — one of which became " Carousel " . One of the pair 's early meetings was at a local skate park where Hoppus , in trying to impress his new bandmate , managed to fall from a lamppost and crack his ankles , an injury that put him in crutches for three weeks . 
 The trio began to practice together in Raynor 's bedroom , spending hours together writing music , attending punk shows and movies , and playing practical jokes . Hoppus and DeLonge would alternate singing vocal parts . The trio first operated under a variety of names , including Duck Tape and Figure 8 , until DeLonge rechristened the band " Blink " . Hoppus ' girlfriend was angered by her boyfriend 's constant attention to the band , and demanded he make a choice between the band and her , which resulted in Hoppus leaving the band shortly after formation . Shortly thereafter , DeLonge and Raynor borrowed a four @-@ track recorder from friend and collaborator Cam Jones and were preparing to record a demo tape , with Jones on bass . Hoppus promptly broke up with his girlfriend and returned to the band . Flyswatter — a combination of original songs and punk covers — was recorded in Raynor 's bedroom in May 1993 . Southern California had a large punk population in the early 1990s , aided by an avid surfing , skating , and snowboarding scene . In contrast to East Coast punk music , the West Coast wave of groups , Blink included , typically introduced more melodic aspects to the group 's music . 
 " New York is gloomy , dark and cold . It makes different music . The Californian middle @-@ class suburbs have nothing to be that bummed about , " said DeLonge . San Diego at this time was " hardly a hotbed of [ musical ] activity " , but the band 's popularity grew as did California punk rock concurrently in the mainstream . DeLonge called clubs constantly in San Diego asking for a spot to play , as well as calling up local high schools , convincing them that Blink was a " motivational band with a strong antidrug message " in hopes to play at an assembly or lunch . 
 The band was on stage nearly every weekend , even at Elks Lodges and YMCA centers . The band soon became part of a circuit that also included the likes of Ten Foot Pole and Unwritten Law , and the band found its way onto the bill as the opening band for local acts at Soma , a local all @-@ ages venue located on Market Street which the band longed to headline . Big @-@ name acts such as NOFX and Green Day played on the main floor , while smaller acts were relegated to the basement , an area referred to as " the Dungeon " . The original location closed its doors and relocated before the band would be promoted to the main stage ( which required a 100 + crowd to attend ) . " Soma was like home away from home . All the punk kids who didn ’ t give a fuck about football games and proms or whatever came to hang out at Soma , " claimed Hoppus . The band 's first big show on the main floor took place on a Thursday , where the band opened for Face to Face . Hoppus ' manager at the record store , Patrick Secor , fronted him the money to properly record another demo at local studio Doubletime . The result was Buddha ( 1994 ) , which the members of the band viewed as the band 's first legitimate release . By this time , the group had branched out to venues such as the Soul Kitchen in El Cajon , but Raynor 's family relocated to Reno , Nevada , and he was briefly replaced by musician Mike Krull . The band saved money and began flying Raynor out to shows , but eventually Raynor moved in with Hoppus for a summer in which the band would record its first album and music video and gain even more exposure .

 The heart of the local independent music scene was Cargo Records , which offered to sign the band on a " trial basis , " with help from O , guitarist for local punk band <unk> , and Brahm Goodis , friend of the band whose father was president of the label . Hoppus was the only member to sign the contract , as DeLonge was at work at the time and Raynor was still a minor . The band recorded its debut album in three days at <unk> Recorders in Los Angeles , fueled by both new songs and re @-@ recordings of songs from previous demos . Although Cheshire Cat , released in February 1995 , made very little impact commercially , it is cited by fans and musicians as an iconic release . " M + M 's " , the band 's first single , garnered local radio airplay from <unk> and Cargo offered the band a small budget to film a music video for it . Meanwhile , the record also drew the attention of Irish band Blink . Unwilling to engage in a legal battle , the band agreed to change its name . Cargo gave the band a week , but the trio put off the decision for more than two afterward . Eventually , Cargo called Blink @-@ 182 , demanding that the band " change the name or [ we 'll ] change it for you , " after which the band decided on a random number , 182 . 
 The band soon had a manager , Rick DeVoe , who associated with larger bands such as NOFX , Pennywise and The Offspring . In addition , the band crucially drew the attention of Rick and Jean Bonde of the Tahoe booking agency , who were responsible for " spreading the name of the band far and wide and getting the group as many gigs as humanly possible . " Surf film director Taylor Steele , friend of DeVoe , was preparing a national tour to promote his new surf video GoodTimes , and the band signed on for its first national tour , which extended as far as the East Coast . The band members purchased their own tour van and embarked on the GoodTimes tour with Unwritten Law , Sprung Monkey and 7 Seconds . The GoodTimes tour continued and the band was whisked away to Australia , with Pennywise paying for the band 's plane tickets . Fletcher <unk> , guitarist of Pennywise , believed in the band strongly . He demanded Kevin Lyman , founder of the Warped Tour , sign the band for the 1996 festival , telling him that " they 're gonna be gigantic . " Australia was very receptive to the band and its humorous stage shows and pranks gained them a reputation , but also made them ostracized and considered a joke . 
 By March 1996 , the trio began to accumulate a genuine buzz among major labels , resulting in a bidding war between Interscope , MCA and Epitaph . MCA promised the group complete artistic freedom and eventually signed the band , but Raynor held a great affinity for Epitaph and began to feel half @-@ invested in the band when it passed over the label . The group , who were wary of purists attempting to define " punk " and discouraged by Cargo 's lack of distribution and faith in the group , had no qualms about signing to a major label but were fiercely criticized in the punk community . After nonstop touring , the trio began recording their sophomore follow @-@ up , Dude Ranch , over the period of a month in late 1996 . The record hit stores the following summer and the band headed out on the 1997 Warped Tour . " Dammit " , the album 's lead single , received heavy airplay on modern rock stations . Dude Ranch shipped gold by 1998 , but an exhaustive touring schedule brought tensions among the trio . Raynor had been drinking heavily to offset personal issues , and he was fired by DeLonge and Hoppus in mid @-@ 1998 despite agreeing to attend rehab and quit drinking . 
 " I think Mark and Tom are better suited for what they are doing . It didn 't fit me . I was always fighting for a different direction and that conflict eventually led to a split . " 
 Travis Barker , drummer for tour @-@ mate The Aquabats , filled in for Raynor , learning the 20 @-@ song setlist in 45 minutes before the first show . He joined the band full @-@ time shortly thereafter and the band entered the studio with producer Jerry Finn later that year to begin work on its third album . 
 = = = Mainstream breakthrough and continued success ( 1999 – 2004 ) = = = 
 With the release of the group 's third album Enema of the State in June 1999 , Blink @-@ 182 was catapulted to stardom and became the biggest pop punk act of the era . Three singles were released from the record — " What 's My Age Again ? " , " All the Small Things " , and " Adam 's Song " — that became major radio hits and MTV staples . " All the Small Things " became a number @-@ one hit on the Modern Rock Tracks chart , but also became a crossover hit and peaked at number 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . Its video parodied boy bands and pop music videos and won Best Group Video at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards . Although the band was criticized as synthesized , manufactured pop only remotely resembling punk and pigeonholed as a joke act due to the puerile slant of its singles and associating music videos , Enema of the State was an enormous commercial success . The album has sold over 15 million copies worldwide and had a considerable effect on pop punk music , inspiring a " second wave " of the genre and numerous acolytes . 
 After multi @-@ platinum success , arena tours , and cameo appearances ( American Pie ) , the band recorded Take Off Your Pants and Jacket ( 2001 ) , which debuted at number one in the United States , Canada , and Germany . Hit singles " The Rock Show " , " Stay Together for the Kids " and " First Date " continued the band 's mainstream success worldwide , with MTV cementing its image as video stars . Finn returned to produce the record and was a key architect of the " polished " pop punk sound , and he served as an invaluable member of the band : part adviser , part impartial observer , he helped smooth out tensions and hone their sound . Recording sessions were sometimes contentious , as DeLonge strove for heavier and dirtier guitar @-@ driven rock . With time off from touring , he felt an " itch to do something where he didn 't feel locked in to what Blink was , " and channeled his chronic back pain and resulting frustration into Box Car Racer ( 2002 ) , a post @-@ hardcore disc that further explores his Fugazi and Refused inspiration . Refraining from paying for a studio drummer , he invited Barker to record drums on the project and Hoppus felt betrayed . The event caused great division within the trio for some time and was an unresolved tension at the forefront of the band 's later hiatus . Barker also explored hip @-@ hop influences and teamed up with Rancid 's Tim Armstrong to form the rap rock band Transplants . 
 The band regrouped in 2003 to record its fifth studio album , infusing experimentalist elements into its usual pop punk sound , inspired by lifestyle changes ( the band members all became fathers before the album was released ) and side projects . Blink 's eponymous fifth studio album was released in the fall of 2003 through Geffen Records , which absorbed sister label MCA earlier that year . The worldwide touring schedule , which saw the band travel to Japan and Australia , also found the three performing for troops stationed in the Middle East . Critics generally complimented the new , more " mature " direction taken for the release and lead singles " Feeling This " and " I Miss You " charted high , with the latter becoming the group 's second number one hit on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart . Fans , however , were split by the new direction , and tensions within the band — stemming from the grueling schedule and DeLonge 's desire to spend more time with his family — started to become evident . 
 = = = Indefinite hiatus , side projects , and Barker 's plane crash ( 2005 – 08 ) = = = 
 In February 2005 , Geffen issued a press statement announcing the band 's " indefinite hiatus . " The band had broken up after members ' arguments regarding their future and recording process . DeLonge felt increasingly conflicted both about his creative freedom within the group and the toll touring was taking on his family life . He eventually expressed his desire to take a half @-@ year respite from touring in order to spend more time with family . Hoppus and Barker were dismayed by his decision , which they felt was an overly long break . The band abruptly canceled a performance at a Music for Relief benefit show after rehearsals grew more contentious . Further arguments had ensued during rehearsals , rooted in the band members ' increasing paranoia and bitterness toward one another . DeLonge considered his bandmates ' priorities " mad , mad different , " coming to the conclusion that the trio had simply grown apart as they aged , had families , and reached fame . The breakdown in communication led to heated exchanges , resulting in his exit from the group . 
 In the interim , Hoppus and Barker continued playing music together in + 44 . The group first began to lay down electronic demos in Barker 's basement and Hoppus ' dining room shortly after the breakup . + 44 's debut , When Your Heart Stops Beating , was released the following year but stalled commercially and received mixed reviews . Barker starred in the MTV reality series Meet the Barkers with his then @-@ wife , former Miss USA Shanna Moakler . The group 's later split , reconciliation and subsequent breakup made them tabloid favorites . Meanwhile , DeLonge disappeared from public eye , making no appearances , granting no interviews and remaining silent until September 2005 , when he announced his new project , Angels & Airwaves , promising " the greatest rock and roll revolution for this generation . " He later revealed he was addicted to painkillers at the time , recalling " I was losing my mind , I was on thousands of painkillers , and I almost killed myself , " and did not realize that his promise of revolution sounded highly ambitious . The group released two albums in 2006 and 2007 : We Don 't Need to Whisper and I @-@ Empire . During the hiatus , Hoppus shifted his attention to producing albums ( most notably Commit This to Memory by former tour @-@ mate Motion City Soundtrack ) and hosting his podcast , <unk> , while Barker launched a shoe line and worked on three other musical projects — the Transplants , + 44 , and TRV $ <unk> , a collaboration with friend Adam Goldstein ( DJ AM ) . 
 The band members did not speak from their breakup until 2008 . That August , Jerry Finn suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and was taken off life support . On September 19 , Barker and Goldstein were involved in a plane crash that killed four people , leaving the two the only survivors . Barker sustained second and third degree burns and developed posttraumatic stress disorder , and the accident resulted in sixteen surgeries and 4 @-@ 8 hour blood transfusions . Hoppus was alerted about Barker 's accident by a phone call in the middle of the night and jumped on the next flight to the burn center . DeLonge found out via the TV news at an airport while waiting to board a flight ; within minutes , he was crying in his seat . " I thought he was going to die , " says DeLonge , who quickly reached out to his former bandmate , mailing him a letter and photograph . " Instantly after the plane crash , I was like , ' Hey , I want to play music with him again . ' " The trio eventually met up in the hospital , laying the grounds for what was going to be the band 's reunion . Eventually , an arrangement was made for the trio to meet up at Hoppus and Barker 's Los Angeles studio in October 2008 . The three opened up , discussing the events of the hiatus and their break @-@ up , and DeLonge was the first to approach the subject of reuniting . " Tom had just kind of come out to Los Angeles for the day , " recalled Hoppus , " I remember he said , ' So , what do you guys think ? Where are your heads at ? ' And I said , ' I think we should continue with what we 've been doing for the past 17 years . I think we should get back on the road and back in the studio and do what we love doing . ' " 
 = = = Reformation , Neighborhoods , and Dogs Eating Dogs ( 2009 – 14 ) = = = 
 Eventually , the band appeared for the first time on stage together in nearly five years as presenters at the February 2009 Grammy Awards . The band 's official website was updated with a statement : " To put it simply , We 're back . We mean , really back . Picking up where we left off and then some . In the studio writing and recording a new album . Preparing to tour the world yet again . Friendships reformed . 17 years deep in our legacy . " Blink @-@ 182 embarked on a reunion tour of North America from July to October 2009 , supported by Weezer and Fall Out Boy . A European festival tour followed from August to September 2010 , and another spring European tour was scheduled for 2011 , but was cancelled in order to complete the band 's promised comeback album . 
 The recording process for Neighborhoods , the band 's sixth studio album , was stalled by its studio autonomy , tours , managers , and personal projects . The band members produced the record themselves following the death of Jerry Finn . DeLonge recorded at his studio in San Diego while Hoppus and Barker recorded in Los Angeles — an extension of their fractured relationships and inability to communicate . Completion was delayed several times , which Hoppus attributed to the band learning to work by themselves without Finn , and both DeLonge and Hoppus expressed frustration during the sessions at the band 's cabal of publicists , managers and attorneys ( which DeLonge described as " the absolute diarrhea of bureaucracy " ) . A result of the band 's split was each member hiring his own attorney , and during the sessions the band had four managers . In addition , Barker was releasing a solo record , DeLonge was involved in Angels & Airwaves , and Hoppus had to fly to New York City once a week to film his television show Hoppus on Music . DeLonge was also diagnosed with skin cancer in 2010 , which was cleared . The album was released in September 2011 and peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 . Its singles — " Up All Night " and " After Midnight " — only attracted modest chart success , and label Interscope was reportedly disappointed with album sales . 
 " Despite growing evidence of remaining friction between the members , " Blink @-@ 182 headlined the 10th Annual Honda Civic Tour with My Chemical Romance , which ran from August to October 2011 . European tour dates rescheduled in order to complete Neighborhoods commenced in 2012 , and the band left Interscope Records that October , becoming an independent act . The band subsequently released Dogs Eating Dogs , an EP , in December 2012 . The band toured Australia in spring 2013 ; Brooks Wackerman replaced Barker on drums as Barker was unwilling to fly after his near death experience in his plane crash . The band followed these dates with a small North American tour in September 2013 , which was followed by a series of shows celebrating the tenth anniversary of the band 's self @-@ titled album that November . The band played a European tour in August 2014 , culminating in them headlining the Reading and Leeds Festivals ; it was the band 's fourth appearance at the festival and second headlining slot . In his autobiography , Can I Say , Barker claims DeLonge 's behavior on tour was " introverted " until " money started coming in , " after which " he 'd get excited about Blink again . " According to Barker , DeLonge abruptly quit sometime in mid @-@ 2014 , only to renege on that the following day , suggesting motivational speaker Tony Robbins hold group therapy with the three . 
 = = = DeLonge 's second exit , addition of Matt Skiba , and California ( 2015 – present ) = = = 
 The group planned to enter the studio to write and record its seventh studio album in January 2015 , due for release later that year . The album saw delays ( initially slated for 2013 ) , attributed to DeLonge 's schedule with Angels & Airwaves and other personal projects . According to Hoppus and Barker , a record deal was finalized and sessions were booked before DeLonge 's manager informed the band he intended to spend more time on " non @-@ musical activities " and indefinitely depart the group . In a Rolling Stone interview , Hoppus noted , " This is exactly the same sequence of events that happened when Blink broke up 10 years ago . " In the piece , he stated that DeLonge 's attitude toward new music was passive , while Barker asserted , " Why Blink even got back together in the first place is questionable . " 
 As a result , Blink @-@ 182 performed two club shows and a slot at the <unk> festival in March 2015 with Alkaline Trio vocalist / guitarist Matt Skiba " filling in " for DeLonge . DeLonge argued he did not exit the band by choice , claimed that " self @-@ sabotage " had overtaken the band following Dogs Eating Dogs , and remarking that recent events " makes me really sad . [ ... ] Our relationship got poisoned yesterday . Never planned on quitting , just find it hard as hell to commit . " In response , Hoppus spoke on the band 's future : " I just wish Tom does whatever makes him happy and stops holding Blink @-@ 182 back from what we all agree that we 're going to do : play shows , record music , continue this legacy and have a good time doing it . " After legal battles with DeLonge were worked out , Skiba rejoined Blink @-@ 182 as an official member , and the trio began preparations for new music . 
 The resulting album , California ( 2016 ) , was produced by John Feldmann . He was the group 's first new producer since longtime collaborator Jerry Finn . Prior to his involvement , the trio began writing together at Barker 's studio and completed dozens of song demos . They decided to shelve them upon working with Feldmann to start fresh , and they proceeded to record another 28 songs . California was recorded between January and March 2016 . The band , as well as Feldmann , would regularly spend " 18 hours " in the studio a day , aiming to start and complete multiple songs in that timeframe . " We all wanted to write the best record that we could [ ... ] It does feel like a new beginning . It feels like when we used to tour and sleep in the van because that 's all we wanted to do is play rock music , " said Hoppus . 
 Upon its July 2016 release , California became the band 's second number @-@ one album on the Billboard 200 , and first in 15 years ; it also reached the top for the first time in the United Kingdom . Its lead single , " Bored to Death " , became the group 's first number one single in 12 years . The band will support the album with a large headlining tour across North America alongside A Day to Remember , the All @-@ American Rejects , and All Time Low ; the trek officially begins July 21 in San Diego and will conclude October 8 in Irvine , California . 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 Blink @-@ 182 's music is often described as pop punk , a fusion music genre that combines some light characteristics of punk rock with pop music , " combining frustration and fast , sunny hooks " . The New York Times writes that the band " [ took ] punk 's already playful core and [ gave ] it a shiny , accessible polish . " The band is also considered alternative rock . Blink @-@ 182 's early albums such as Cheshire Cat and Dude Ranch are considered skate punk and punk rock . Blink @-@ 182 emerged from a " nurturing , often slapstick " Southern California punk scene , playing with groups like <unk> , NOFX and The Vandals , but the band 's sound was criticized when it achieved mainstream popularity by several punk acts who wished to not be associated with the band 's music . The band 's sound evolved with its 2003 untitled effort , which incorporated post @-@ hardcore influences into deeper , darker pop territory . The band 's newest material , Neighborhoods ( 2011 ) , combines arena rock , hip hop and indie rock inspiration . The Sydney Morning Herald characterised the band 's sound as a " mildly tough approach to pop melodies with a decided adolescent spin " . 
 Common lyrical themes include love , family , friends , and relationships . In greater detail , this includes " adolescent aimlessness , broken hearts and general confusion over the care and feeding of girls . " Lyrics in singles such as " What 's My Age Again ? " reflect age and maturity , while more serious compositions such as " Stay Together for the Kids " touch on the subject of divorce . DeLonge said in a 1999 interview that the goal is to remain sincere and relatable , noting that the band takes its lyrics very seriously . Despite this , the band gained a reputation for occasional lyrical toilet humor ( Take Off Your Pants and Jacket ) . As the band members grew older , lyrical themes began to reflect the realities of adulthood , including relationship woes , daily pressures and unexpected hardships , most prominently explored on Blink @-@ 182 ( 2003 ) . On Neighborhoods , darker lyricism continues : themes concerning depression , addiction , loss and death were inspired by Barker 's plane crash and the death of producer Jerry Finn . 
 The band has cited The Cure , Descendents , Bad Religion , Screeching Weasel , All , Face to Face , Down by Law , Pennywise , Green Day , The Vandals , Operation Ivy , Generation X , the Ramones , Fugazi and Refused as influences . The members of the band were also inspired by several mid @-@ 1990s " emo " acts , most prominently Jimmy Eat World and The Get Up Kids . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Blink @-@ 182 was one of the most popular bands at the turn of the millennium , and spearheaded the second wave of pop punk and its journey into the mainstream . The glossy production instantly set Blink @-@ 182 apart from the other crossover punk acts of the era , such as Green Day . Cheshire Cat is often cited by bands and fans as an iconic release and Dude Ranch has been called a " genuine modern punk classic . " Enema of the State catapulted the band to stardom , creating what New York described as a " blanket immersion among America 's twenty @-@ some million teenagers . " At the band 's commercial peak , albums such as Take Off Your Pants and Jacket and Enema of the State sold over 14 and 15 million copies worldwide , respectively . The band was featured alongside Green Day , Rancid , Bad Religion , NOFX , and The Offspring in One Nine Nine Four ( 2009 ) , a documentary examining punk rock in California . 
 The band never received particularly glowing reviews , with many reviewers dismissing them as a joke act based on the humorous slant of its music videos . British publication NME was particularly critical of the trio , begging them to " fuck right off , " and comparing them to " that sanitised , castrated , shrink @-@ wrapped ' new wave ' crap that the major US record companies pumped out circa 1981 in their belated attempt to jump on the ' punk ' bandwagon . " Nevertheless , subsequent reviews of the band 's discography have been more positive . Andy Greenwald of Blender wrote , " the quick transformation from nudists to near geniuses is down @-@ right astonishing . " James Montgomery of MTV called Blink @-@ 182 one of the " most influential bands of the past 20 years , " writing , " despite their maturation , Blink never took themselves particularly seriously , which was another reason they were so accessible . " 
 " When it comes to having inestimable influence , Blink @-@ 182 might well be contemporary punk 's version of the Beatles " , wrote Scott Heisel in a 2009 Alternative Press cover story on the band . The same magazine later ranked Blink the fourth of the " 30 Most Influential Bands of the Past 30 Years , " just behind Radiohead , Fugazi , and Nirvana . The new generation of pop punk and alternative rock fans found the Blink sound " hugely influential , " with Montgomery writing , " ... without them , there 'd be no Fall Out Boy , no Paramore , or no Fueled by Ramen Records . " In 2011 , The New York Times asserted that " no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink @-@ 182 , " stating that even as the band receded after its 2005 split , " its sound and style could be heard in the muscular pop punk of Fall Out Boy or in the current wave of high @-@ gloss Warped Tour punk bands , like All Time Low and The Maine . " Maria Sherman of The Village Voice took that sentiment a step further , writing " It 's pretty simple : Blink @-@ 182 is the most important band of the ' 90s , dick jokes and all . Apart from the sound , Blink 's ideology has been popularized [ … ] their presence is everywhere . " According to Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker , the group " emerged as a touchstone , spawning more imitators than any American rock band since Nirvana . " Bands such as Panic ! at the Disco and All Time Low originated covering Blink @-@ 182 songs . " Anyone in our genre would be lying if they said they weren 't influenced by Blink @-@ 182 , " said Joel Madden of Good Charlotte . Bands such as You Me at Six and 5 Seconds of Summer have also named the band as influences . 
 The band 's influence extends beyond pop punk groups , as well : Mumford & Sons , Owl City , <unk> , Best Coast , <unk> Male Bonding , Grimes Posture & the Grizzly , and DIIV have acknowledged the band 's influence , and critics have noted traits of the band 's sound in <unk> .

 = Cædmon = 
 Cædmon ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / ) is the earliest English ( Northumbrian ) poet whose name is known . An Anglo @-@ Saxon who cared for the animals at the double monastery of Streonæshalch ( Whitby Abbey ) during the abbacy ( 657 – 680 ) of St. Hilda ( 614 – 680 ) , he was originally ignorant of " the art of song " but learned to compose one night in the course of a dream , according to the 8th @-@ century historian Bede . He later became a zealous monk and an accomplished and inspirational Christian poet . 
 Cædmon is one of twelve Anglo @-@ Saxon poets identified in medieval sources , and one of only three of these for whom both roughly contemporary biographical information and examples of literary output have survived . His story is related in the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum ( " Ecclesiastical History of the English People " ) by Bede who wrote , " [ t ] here was in the Monastery of this Abbess a certain brother particularly remarkable for the Grace of God , who was wont to make religious verses , so that whatever was interpreted to him out of scripture , he soon after put the same into poetical expressions of much sweetness and humility in Old English , which was his native language . By his verse the minds of many were often excited to despise the world , and to aspire to heaven . " 
 Cædmon 's only known surviving work is Cædmon 's Hymn , the nine @-@ line alliterative vernacular praise poem in honour of God which he supposedly learned to sing in his initial dream . The poem is one of the earliest attested examples of Old English and is , with the runic Ruthwell Cross and Franks Casket inscriptions , one of three candidates for the earliest attested example of Old English poetry . It is also one of the earliest recorded examples of sustained poetry in a Germanic language . In 1898 , Cædmon 's Cross was erected in his honour in the graveyard of St. Mary 's Church in Whitby . 
 = = Life = = 
 = = = Bede 's account = = = 
 The sole source of original information about Cædmon 's life and work is Bede 's Historia ecclesiastica . According to Bede , Cædmon was a lay brother who cared for the animals at the monastery Streonæshalch ( now known as Whitby Abbey ) . One evening , while the monks were feasting , singing , and playing a harp , Cædmon left early to sleep with the animals because he knew no songs . The impression clearly given by St. Bede is that he lacked the knowledge of how to compose the lyrics to songs . While asleep , he had a dream in which " someone " ( quidam ) approached him and asked him to sing <unk> <unk> , " the beginning of created things . " After first refusing to sing , Cædmon subsequently produced a short eulogistic poem praising God , the Creator of heaven and earth . 
 Upon awakening the next morning , Cædmon remembered everything he had sung and added additional lines to his poem . He told his foreman about his dream and gift and was taken immediately to see the abbess . The abbess and her counsellors asked Cædmon about his vision and , satisfied that it was a gift from God , gave him a new commission , this time for a poem based on " a passage of sacred history or doctrine " , by way of a test . When Cædmon returned the next morning with the requested poem , he was ordered to take monastic vows . The abbess ordered her scholars to teach Cædmon sacred history and doctrine , which after a night of thought , Bede records , Cædmon would turn into the most beautiful verse . According to Bede , Cædmon was responsible for a large number of splendid vernacular poetic texts on a variety of Christian topics . 
 After a long and zealously pious life , Cædmon died like a saint : receiving a premonition of death , he asked to be moved to the abbey 's hospice for the terminally ill where , having gathered his friends around him , he expired , after receiving the Holy Eucharist , just before <unk> . Although he is often listed as a saint , this is not confirmed by Bede and it has recently been argued that such assertions are incorrect . 
 The details of Bede 's story , and in particular of the miraculous nature of Cædmon 's poetic inspiration , are not generally accepted by scholars as being entirely accurate , but there seems no good reason to doubt the existence of a poet named Cædmon . Bede 's narrative has to be read in the context of the Christian belief in miracles , and it shows at the very least that Bede , an educated and intelligent man , believed Cædmon to be an important figure in the history of English intellectual and religious life . 
 = = = Dates = = = 
 Bede gives no specific dates in his story . Cædmon is said to have taken holy orders at an advanced age and it is implied that he lived at Streonæshalch at least in part during Hilda 's abbacy ( 657 – 680 ) . Book IV Chapter 25 of the Historia ecclesiastica appears to suggest that Cædmon 's death occurred at about the same time as the fire at Coldingham Abbey , an event dated in the E text of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle to 679 , but after 681 by Bede . The reference to his <unk> " at this time " in the opening lines of Chapter 25 may refer more generally to Cædmon 's career as a poet . However , the next datable event in the Historia ecclesiastica is King Ecgfrith 's raid on Ireland in 684 ( Book IV , Chapter 26 ) . Taken together , this evidence suggests an active period beginning between 657 and 680 and ending between 679 and 684 . 
 = = = Modern discoveries = = = 
 The only biographical or historical information that modern scholarship has been able to add to Bede 's account concerns the Brittonic origins of the poet 's name . Although Bede specifically notes that English was Cædmon 's " own " language , the poet 's name is of Celtic origin : from Proto @-@ Welsh * <unk> ( from Brythonic * <unk> ) . Several scholars have suggested that Cædmon himself may have been bilingual on the basis of this etymology , Hilda 's close contact with Celtic political and religious hierarchies , and some ( not very close ) analogues to the Hymn in Old Irish poetry . Other scholars have noticed a possible onomastic allusion to ' Adam Kadmon ' in the poet 's name , perhaps suggesting that the entire story is allegorical . 
 = = = Other medieval sources = = = 
 No other independent accounts of Cædmon 's life and work are known to exist . The only other reference to Cædmon in English sources before the 12th century is found in the 10th century Old English translation of Bede 's Latin Historia . Otherwise , no mention of Cædmon is found in the corpus of surviving Old English . The Old English translation of the Historia ecclesiastica does contain several minor details not found in Bede 's Latin original account . Of these , the most significant is that Cædmon felt " shame " for his inability to sing vernacular songs before his vision , and the suggestion that Hilda 's scribes copied down his verse <unk> <unk> " from his mouth " . These differences are in keeping with the Old English translator 's practice in reworking Bede 's Latin original , however , and need not , as Wrenn argues , suggest the existence of an independent English tradition of the Cædmon story . 
 = = = = Heliand = = = = 
 A second , possibly pre @-@ 12th century allusion to the Cædmon story is found in two Latin texts associated with the Old Saxon Heliand poem . These texts , the <unk> ( Preface ) and Versus de Poeta ( Lines about the poet ) , explain the origins of an Old Saxon biblical translation ( for which the Heliand is the only known candidate ) in language strongly reminiscent of , and indeed at times identical to , Bede 's account of Cædmon 's career . According to the prose <unk> , the Old Saxon poem was composed by a renowned vernacular poet at the command of the emperor Louis the Pious ; the text then adds that this poet had known nothing of vernacular composition until he was ordered to translate the precepts of sacred law into vernacular song in a dream . The Versus de Poeta contain an expanded account of the dream itself , adding that the poet had been a herdsman before his inspiration and that the inspiration itself had come through the medium of a heavenly voice when he fell asleep after pasturing his cattle . While our knowledge of these texts is based entirely on a 16th @-@ century edition by <unk> <unk> , both are usually assumed on semantic and grammatical grounds to be of medieval composition . This apparent debt to the Cædmon story agrees with semantic evidence attested to by Green demonstrating the influence of Anglo Saxon biblical poetry and terminology on early continental Germanic literatures . 
 = = Work = = 
 = = = General corpus = = = 
 Bede 's account indicates that Cædmon was responsible for the composition of a large oeuvre of vernacular religious poetry . In contrast to Saints Aldhelm and Dunstan , Cædmon 's poetry is said to have been exclusively religious . Bede reports that Cædmon " could never compose any foolish or trivial poem , but only those which were concerned with devotion " , and his list of Cædmon 's output includes work on religious subjects only : accounts of creation , translations from the Old and New Testaments , and songs about the " terrors of future judgment , horrors of hell , ... joys of the heavenly kingdom , ... and divine mercies and judgments . " Of this corpus , only his first poem survives . While vernacular poems matching Bede 's description of several of Cædmon 's later works are found in London , British Library , Junius 11 ( traditionally referred to as the " Junius " or " Cædmon " manuscript ) , the older traditional attribution of these texts to Cædmon or Cædmon 's influence cannot stand . The poems show significant stylistic differences both internally and with Cædmon 's original Hymn , and there is nothing about their order or content to suggest that they could not have been composed and anthologised without any influence from Bede 's discussion of Cædmon 's oeuvre : the first three Junius poems are in their biblical order and , while Christ and Satan could be understood as partially fitting Bede 's description of Cædmon 's work on future judgment , pains of hell and joys of the heavenly kingdom , the match is not exact enough to preclude independent composition . As Fritz and Day have shown , indeed , Bede 's list itself may owe less to direct knowledge of Cædmon 's actual output than to traditional ideas about the subjects fit for Christian poetry or the order of the catechism . Similar influences may , of course , also have affected the makeup of the Junius volume . 
 = = = Cædmon 's Hymn = = = 
 The only known survivor from Cædmon 's oeuvre is his Hymn ( audio version ) . The poem is known from 21 manuscript copies , making it the best @-@ attested Old English poem after Bede 's Death Song ( with 35 witnesses ) and the best attested in the poetic corpus in manuscripts copied or owned in the British Isles during the Anglo @-@ Saxon period . The Hymn also has by far the most complicated known textual history of any surviving Anglo @-@ Saxon poem . It is found in two dialects and five distinct recensions ( Northumbrian <unk> , Northumbrian <unk> , West @-@ Saxon <unk> , West @-@ Saxon <unk> , and West @-@ Saxon eorðe ) , all but one of which are known from three or more witnesses . It is one of the earliest attested examples of written Old English and one of the earliest recorded examples of sustained poetry in a Germanic language . Together with the runic Ruthwell Cross and Franks Casket inscriptions , Cædmon 's Hymn is one of three candidates for the earliest attested example of Old English poetry . 
 There is continuing critical debate about the status of the poem as it is now available to us . While some scholars accept the texts of the Hymn as more or less accurate transmissions of Cædmon 's original , others argue that they originated as a back @-@ translation from Bede 's Latin , and that there is no surviving witness to the original text . 
 = = = = Manuscript evidence = = = = 
 All copies of Hymn are found in manuscripts of the Historia ecclesiastica or its translation , where they serve as either a gloss to Bede 's Latin translation of the Old English poem , or , in the case of the Old English version , a replacement for Bede 's translation in the main text of the History . Despite this close connection with Bede 's work , the Hymn does not appear to have been transmitted with the Historia ecclesiastica regularly until relatively late in its textual history . Scribes other than those responsible for the main text often copy the vernacular text of the Hymn in manuscripts of the Latin Historia . In three cases , Oxford , Bodleian Library , Laud Misc . 243 , Oxford , Bodleian Library , Hatton 43 , and Winchester , Cathedral I , the poem is copied by scribes working a quarter @-@ century or more after the main text was first set down . Even when the poem is in the same hand as the manuscript 's main text , there is little evidence to suggest that it was copied from the same exemplar as the Latin Historia : nearly identical versions of the Old English poem are found in manuscripts belonging to different recensions of the Latin text ; closely related copies of the Latin Historia sometimes contain very different versions of the Old English poem . With the exception of the Old English translation , no single recension of the Historia ecclesiastica is characterised by the presence of a particular recension of the vernacular poem . 
 = = = = Earliest text = = = = 
 The oldest known version of the poem is the Northumbrian <unk> recension . The surviving witnesses to this text , Cambridge , University Library , Kk . 5 . 16 ( M ) and St. Petersburg , National Library of Russia , lat . Q. v. I. 18 ( P ) , date to at least the mid @-@ 8th century . M in particular is traditionally ascribed to Bede 's own monastery and lifetime , though there is little evidence to suggest it was copied much before the mid @-@ 8th century . 
 The following text , first column on the left below , has been transcribed from M ( mid @-@ 8th century ; Northumbria ) . The text has been normalised to show a line @-@ break between each line and modern word @-@ division . A transcription of the likely pronunciation of the text in the early 8th @-@ century Northumbrian dialect in which the text is written is included , along with a modern English translation . 
 Bede 's Latin version runs as follows : 
 Nunc <unk> <unk> <unk> regni <unk> , potentiam <unk> , et consilium <unk> <unk> Patris gloriae : <unk> <unk> , cum sit <unk> Deus , omnium <unk> auctor <unk> ; qui primo <unk> hominum <unk> pro <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> custos humani generis omnipotens <unk> . 
 " Now we must praise the author of the heavenly realm , the might of the creator , and his purpose , the work of the father of glory : as he , who , the almighty guardian of the human race , is the eternal God , is the author of all miracles ; who first created the heavens as highest roof for the children men , then the earth .

 = Italian cruiser Libia = 
 Libia was a protected cruiser built in Italy in the 1900s . The ship had originally been laid down in 1907 for the Ottoman Navy and was to have been named Drama , and was based on the Ottoman cruiser Hamidiye . She had not been completed by the outbreak of the Italo @-@ Turkish War in 1911 and so she was seized by the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) and was completed in 1913 . The ship was armed with two 152 mm ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) and eight 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) guns , and was capable of a top speed of over 22 knots ( 41 km / h ; 25 mph ) . 
 Libia had a relatively uneventful career . Before Italy 's entry into World War I , she was involved in the evacuation of Prince William , the ruler of Albania , from Durazzo in late 1914 . Following Italy 's declaration of war in May 1915 , Libia patrolled the Otranto Barrage but did not see action . In 1921 – 22 , she went on a world tour , during which she was featured in a short documentary produced by the then @-@ unknown Frank Capra . In 1925 she was deployed to China , where she remained for nearly a decade . In 1937 , the old cruiser was stricken from the naval register and sold for scrap . 
 = = Design = = 
 The design for the new cruiser was based on the British @-@ built Ottoman cruiser Hamidiye . The ship was 103 @.@ 6 meters ( 340 ft ) long at the waterline and 111 @.@ 8 m ( 367 ft ) long overall . She had a beam of 14 @.@ 5 m ( 48 ft ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 5 m ( 18 ft ) . She displaced 3 @,@ 760 metric tons ( 3 @,@ 700 long tons ; 4 @,@ 140 short tons ) standard and up to 4 @,@ 466 t ( 4 @,@ 395 long tons ; 4 @,@ 923 short tons ) at full load . The ship was fitted with two pole masts . She had a crew of 14 officers and 300 enlisted men . The ship was protected by an armored deck that was 100 mm ( 4 in ) thick , and the conning tower had the same thickness of armor plating on the sides . The main guns were protected by 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) thick gun shields . 
 Libia was powered by two @-@ shaft vertical triple @-@ expansion engines . Steam for the engines was provided by sixteen coal @-@ fired Niclausse water @-@ tube boilers that were trunked into three closely spaced funnels on the centerline . The engines were rated at 12 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 9 @,@ 300 kW ) , though they only reached 11 @,@ 530 ihp ( 8 @,@ 600 kW ) in service . This was sufficient to propel the ship at a top speed of 22 @.@ 9 knots ( 42 @.@ 4 km / h ; 26 @.@ 4 mph ) . Libia had a cruising radius of 3 @,@ 150 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 830 km ; 3 @,@ 620 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The ship was armed with a main battery of two 152 mm ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) L / 50 quick @-@ firing guns , one forward and one astern . These guns were probably Pattern FF Armstrong guns , which fired a 20 @-@ kilogram ( 44 lb ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 780 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ) . These were augmented by a battery of eight 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) L / 45 guns , four mounted individually on each broadside . Close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats was provided by a battery of eight 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) L / 50 guns and six 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) L / 20 guns . She was also equipped with four 450 mm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes .

 The new cruiser was laid down in 1907 at the Ansaldo shipyard in Genoa for the Ottoman Empire , under the name Drama . But following the rise of the Young Turks in the Ottoman Empire , the Ottoman government became unwilling to pay its foreign debts , which led Ansaldo to halt construction work . Work on the ship only resumed in late 1911 when Italy seized the ship following its declaration of war against the Ottoman Empire in the Italo @-@ Turkish War . The completed hull was launched on 11 November 1912 , and following the completion of fitting @-@ out work , the new ship was commissioned on 25 March 1913 . On 3 September 1914 , Libia was in the port of Durazzo , Albania when Prince William , the ruler of the country , departed following turmoil caused by an insurgency in the country , coupled with the outbreak of World War I. Libia had landed a contingent of marines to restore order in the city , where some 2 @,@ 000 refugees fleeing the insurgents attempted to board passenger ships bound for Italy . After the refugees were evacuated , Libia recalled her marines and departed as well . 
 Italy had declared neutrality at the start of World War I , but by July 1915 , the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers . Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel , the Italian naval chief of staff , believed that the threat from Austro @-@ Hungarian submarines and naval mines in the narrow waters of the Adriatic was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way . Instead , Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet , while smaller vessels , such as the MAS boats , conducted raids on Austro @-@ Hungarian ships and installations . Libia spent much of the war patrolling the Otranto Barrage , along with the cruisers Piemonte and Agordat and several Italian and French destroyers . During the war , the ship had three 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) L / 40 anti @-@ aircraft guns installed . 
 In 1921 the ship went on a world tour under the command of Admiral Ernesto <unk> . During the cruise , she stopped in San Francisco , United States in November , where she stayed for a month . While there , she was filmed for a short documentary by the then @-@ unknown film director Frank Capra on 6 and 7 November — though it did not generate much attention , it was Capra 's first publicly screened film . The ship departed San Francisco on 4 December . In 1922 , Libia visited Australia while on her tour . In 1925 , her 150 mm guns were removed . That year , she was sent to China , where she joined the armored cruisers San Marco and San Giorgio and the river gunboats Caboto and <unk> . These ships contributed men to form the <unk> Italiano in China ( Italian Battalion in China ) ; the contingents from Libia were sent to guard the consulates in Beijing and Shanhaiguan . The ship remained in Chinese waters for nearly a decade ; in the early 1930s , she was replaced by the protected cruiser Quarto . In September 1935 she was drydocked to prepare for her disposal . She was stricken from the naval register on 11 March 1937 and was sold to ship breakers . 
 = Ratna Sarumpaet = 
 Ratna Sarumpaet ( born 16 July 1949 ) is an Indonesian human rights activist . She is also a theatrical producer , actress , film director , and writer . 
 Sarumpaet , born into a politically active Christian family in North Sumatra , initially studied architecture in Jakarta . After seeing a play by <unk> S. Rendra in 1969 , she dropped out and joined his troupe . Five years later , after marrying and converting to Islam , she founded the Satu Merah Panggung ; the troupe did mostly adaptations of foreign dramas . As she became increasingly concerned about her marriage and unhappy about the local theatre scene , two years later Sarumpaet left her troupe and began to work in television ; she only returned in 1989 , after divorcing her abusive husband . 
 The murder of Marsinah , a labour activist , in 1993 led Sarumpaet to become politically active . She wrote her first original stageplay , Marsinah : <unk> dari Bawah Tanah ( Marsinah : Song from the Underground ) , in 1994 after becoming obsessed with the case . This was followed by several other politically charged works , several of which were banned or restricted by the government . Increasingly disillusioned by the autocratic acts of Suharto 's New Order government , during the 1997 legislative elections Sarumpaet and her troupe led pro @-@ democracy protests . For one of these , in March 1998 , she was arrested and jailed for seventy days for spreading hatred and attending an " anti @-@ revolutionary " political gathering . 
 After her release , Sarumpaet continued to participate in pro @-@ democracy movements ; these actions led to her fleeing Indonesia after hearing rumours that she would be arrested for dissent . When she returned to Indonesia , Sarumpaet continued to write politically charged <unk> . She became head of the Jakarta Art Board in 2003 ; two years later she was approached by UNICEF and asked to write a drama to raise awareness of child trafficking in Southeast Asia . The resulting work served as the foundation for her 2009 feature film debut , Jamila dan Sang Presiden ( Jamila and the President ) . This film was submitted to the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film but not nominated . The following year , she released her first novel , Maluku , <unk> Cintaku ( Maluku , Flame of My Love ) . 
 = = Background and early career = = 
 Sarumpaet was born on 16 July 1949 in <unk> , North Tapanuli Regency , North Sumatra . She was the fifth of ten children born to Saladin Sarumpaet , Minister of Defence in the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia rebel government , and Julia <unk> , a women 's rights activist . Both were also prominent in the Christian community . Three of her siblings – <unk> Sani , <unk> Sarumpaet and Sam Sarumpaet – are members of the Indonesian art community . As a teenager she moved to Jakarta to study there , finishing her high school studies at <unk> Menteng . In his biography , her classmate Chrisye recalled that Sarumpaet was very confident ; he noted that she enjoyed writing poetry and then reading it in a loud voice while other students were engaging in other activities . 
 By 1969 she was studying architecture at the University of Indonesia . It was at this time that she saw a performance of <unk> <unk> ( The <unk> Chant ) by a troupe led by <unk> S. Rendra , which convinced her to drop out of university and join the troupe . In 1974 she founded Satu Merah Panggung Theater , which performed adaptations of foreign works such as the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam and William Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet – in the latter , Sarumpaet played the titular role . 
 Sarumpaet became interested in Islam in her teenage years , but only converted around 1974 after marrying Achmad Fahmy Alhady , an Arab @-@ Indonesian . Together they had four children : Mohammad Iqbal Alhady , Fathom <unk> , Ibrahim Alhady , and Atiqah Hasiholan . Atiqah is also an actress and would later star in her mother 's film Jamila . 
 In 1976 , Sarumpaet , who was suffering domestic violence at home and discouraged by the market , left theatre and entered the film industry . After her divorce , which took several years and required records of her broken ribs to satisfy the religious courts , she returned to theatre in 1989 with a performance of Shakespeare 's Othello . Sarumpaet began working as a director in 1991 , with the television serial Rumah Untuk Mama ( House for Mother ) , which was broadcast on the state @-@ owned television station TVRI . That same year , she adapted Antigone , a tragedy by French writer Jean Anouilh , in a Batak setting . 
 = = Political theater = = 
 Sarumpaet 's first original stageplay , Marsinah : <unk> dari Bawah Tanah ( Marsinah : Song from the Underground ) , was performed in 1994 despite a sponsor abandoning the project near the showing date . The stageplay was based on the 1993 murder of Marsinah , a labour rights leader from East Java , and explored issues of political repression . The murder sparked a period of political activity for Sarumpaet . According to Barbara Hatley in Inside Indonesia , Sarumpaet was obsessed with the case , including seeing Marsinah 's face while writing . Sarumpaet later reported that the way the murder was conducted , with Marsinah raped and mutilated , then discarded in a forest , " symbolised the deep , trivialising contempt which men , especially powerful men , feel towards women who dare to speak out " . 
 After Marsinah , Sarumpaet and Satu Merah Panggung performed several other politically themed dramas , including <unk> ( Chained ; 1995 ) , about male dominance and violence against women , and Pesta Terakhir ( The Last Party ; 1996 ) , about the funeral of a dictator without any mourners . In 1997 , after the Marsinah case was closed due to contaminated DNA evidence , Sarumpaet released Marsinah <unk> ( Marsinah Revolts ; 1997 ) , a monologue in which Marsinah describes her murder . The play was banned in three cities . During the 1997 elections , Sarumpaet and her troupe performed with a coffin labeled " Democracy " . For their action , they were arrested and held for twenty @-@ four hours . 
 On 11 March 1998 , Sarumpaet and eight others were arrested during a gathering held in concurrence with a meeting of the People 's Consultative Assembly , in which she and the gathered persons sang the national anthem " Indonesia Raya " and " Padamu Negeri " ( " To You , My Country " ) in front of security forces . The government had banned political meetings of more than five people earlier that month . Six of those arrested were brought up on charges , including Sarumpaet , who was charged with spreading hatred and attending an " anti @-@ revolutionary " political gathering . Her pre @-@ trial motion complaining about irregularities in the arrest , including the lack of a warrant , was dismissed by the court ; a judge on the case commented that " singing ' Indonesia Raya ' and ' [ Padamu Negeri ] ' is proof of their political crime " . She was sentenced to 70 days in prison on 20 May – equal to her time served – then released . A day after her release , President Suharto resigned , bringing an end to the New Order . 
 = = Post @-@ Suharto work = = 
 After her release , Sarumpaet continued to be active in pro @-@ democracy groups ; she also wrote another play , Sang Raja ( The King ) . Towards the end of 1998 , with the political situation in Indonesia increasingly unstable and Sarumpaet rumoured to be wanted for stirring up dissent , she fled to Europe via Singapore . In December 1998 , the Tokyo @-@ based Asia Foundation for Human Rights awarded Sarumpaet the Female Human Rights Special Award . 
 By 2002 Sarumpaet had returned to Indonesia , where she debuted a stageplay entitled Alia , Luka <unk> <unk> ( Alia , Wound of <unk> <unk> ) at Ismail Marzuki Park in Jakarta ; it was her first stageplay since the fall of Suharto . Dealing with Indonesian military operations in Aceh , the play was later performed in five other cities . In December 2002 it was scheduled to be broadcast on TVRI in commemoration of Human Rights Day , but pulled at the last minute due to intervention from the military . In 2001 , she and her troupe put on Dalam <unk> Panjang ( In a Long Darkness ) , which dealt with the children of victims of the anti @-@ communist purges of 1965 – 1966 . 
 In 2003 , Sarumpaet was selected to head the Jakarta Art Board ( Dewan Kesenian Jakarta ) , a position which she held until 2006 . Two years after her selection , Sarumpaet was approached by UNICEF and asked to do a survey of child trafficking in Southeast Asia and promote awareness of the problem . After discovering the extent of the problem , she wrote Pelacur dan Sang Presiden ( The Prostitute and the President ) , spending six months interviewing prostitutes in Surabaya , Surakarta , Garut , and Borneo in preparation . The play was shown in five different cities in 2006 and received warmly . Also in 2006 , Sarumpaet organised the seventh triannual Women 's Playwright International Conference in Bali . 
 After Pelacur , Sarumpaet began working on a film adaptation entitled Jamila dan Sang Presiden ( Jamila and the President ) . The film 's production took three years , due in part to a lack of funding ; the total budget was <unk> billion ( US $ 800 @,@ 000 ) Released on 30 April 2009 , the film was well received both domestically and internationally . It was submitted to the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film , but not nominated . 
 On 23 July 2008 , while Jamila was in production , Sarumpaet nominated herself as an independent presidential candidate in the 2009 elections . She attempted to raise funding through selling " stocks " in her campaign through the <unk> Indonesia , established especially for the campaign ; according to Sarumpaet , the technique was meant to show that people who were not wealthy could run for president . She did not make the ballot , after the Constitutional Court of Indonesia ruled that independent candidates would not be allowed to run . 
 Sarumpaet released her first written work of fiction on 10 December 2010 , in commemoration of Human Rights Day . Entitled Maluku , <unk> Cintaku ( Maluku , Flame of My Love ) , the novel is about the love of a Christian woman and Muslim man set amidst the Maluku sectarian conflict ; it delves into the causes of the conflict , including poverty and provocation by the armed forces . 
 In June 2014 , Sarumpaet was upset by a Time magazine article that criticized a music video with Nazi overtones made by Indonesian rock singer Ahmad Dhani in support of 2014 presidential candidate Prabowo <unk> and his running mate Hatta <unk> . The article , headlined " This Indonesian Nazi Video Is One of the Worst Pieces of Political Campaigning Ever " , was written by reporter <unk> Kwok . On Twitter , Sarumpaet accused Kwok of having embarrassed Indonesia by making a false report on a survey on CNN . She also mentioned Kwok 's Chinese ethnicity and her former address , and posted a photo of Kwok and her child . Kwok said Sarumpaet 's actions went " beyond bullying " and asked her to remove the photo or face legal action . Sarumpaet subsequently deleted the photo . 
 = June 2008 tornado outbreak sequence = 
 The June 2008 tornado outbreak sequence was a series of tornado outbreaks affecting most of central and eastern North America from June 3 – 11 , 2008 . 192 tornadoes were confirmed , along with widespread straight – line wind wind damage . Seven people were killed from a direct result of tornadoes ; four in Iowa , two in Kansas , and one in Indiana . Eleven additional people were killed across five states by other weather events including lightning , flash flooding , and straight @-@ line winds . Severe flooding was also reported in much of Indiana , Wisconsin , Minnesota and Iowa as a result of the same thunderstorms , while high heat and humidity affected much of eastern North America ; particularly along the eastern seaboard of the United States from New York City to the Carolinas . 
 = = Meteorological synopsis = = 
 = = = June 3 = = = 
 Several clusters of thunderstorms developed during the morning from eastern Nebraska across Iowa into Illinois , taking place along a warm front . The front remained over the same areas during the day , as daytime heating and southwesterly surface winds brought warm and unstable air northward , resulting in severe weather development . The presence of strong winds aloft aided in development of multiple clusters and lines of thunderstorms that produced damaging wind , hail and tornadoes across Missouri , Illinois and Indiana . 
 A moderate risk of severe weather was issued by the Storm Prediction Center for parts of Indiana , Kentucky , Illinois , Ohio and West Virginia on June 3 , Two particular tornadoes , rated EF2 and EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale , caused extensive damage across portions of central Indiana . The EF3 tornado damaged 34 structures in Rush County , of which 27 of them were in Middletown . Eight people were injured in Rush County , including a 67 @-@ year @-@ old woman who was impaled in the chest by a large tree limb and later died as a result of her injury on August 17 . A 19th century landmark covered bridge in Moscow was destroyed , as well as severe damage to dozens of homes , including some that were swept completely off the foundation . The EF2 tornado damaged 20 to 30 homes in Brown County , 40 buildings at Camp Atterbury in Johnson County and 59 buildings in Edinburgh . 
 = = = June 4 = = = 
 A moderate risk of severe weather was issued for northern Kansas into southern Nebraska and from eastern West Virginia through Virginia , Maryland and Delaware . An ongoing line of thunderstorms moved east across West Virginia as the atmosphere began to destabilize . The thunderstorms resulted in a threat for isolated tornadoes in eastern sections of West Virginia , Virginia , Delaware and Maryland . In the central Great Plains region , a warm front extended northeast in northeastern Kansas from a surface low in central sections of Kansas . Strong instability occurred in the vicinity of the area as a result of surface heating . An intensifying low @-@ level jet stream broke the cap in the region and resulted in the development of thunderstorms . During the afternoon , numerous thunderstorms formed across the Mid @-@ Atlantic States . An EF0 tornado was produced from one of the thunderstorms that impacted portions of Chesapeake Beach , tearing off sections of roof and siding from 10 to 20 single family homes . EF1 tornadoes were produced in Culpeper , Clarke and Stafford counties in Virginia . Several other EF0 and EF1 tornadoes formed throughout the Great Plains region . 
 = = = June 5 = = = 
 A strong jet stream moved northeast across the Great Plains region and a strong surface low in western Kansas strengthened as it moved to the Nebraska @-@ South Dakota border . Ahead of the low , very warm and moist air spread throughout the South Central United States into Nebraska , eastern sections of South Dakota and the upper Mississippi Valley . The combination of strong winds and warm and moist air created conditions favorable for strong thunderstorms . On June 5 , a high risk of severe weather was issued for six different states in the Midwestern United States , with a moderate risk area surrounding the high risk area . Forecasters had warned of a potentially historic outbreak , as computer forecasting models for June 5 resembled those on June 8 , 1974 , when 39 tornadoes struck the southern Great Plains and killed 22 people . Wichita State University canceled evening classes because of the weather predictions . Severe weather began developing across eastern Colorado and northwestern Kansas during the morning and into the early afternoon , producing several weak tornadoes in the process . An EF1 tornado impacted a campground near Kellogg , Iowa and injured two people . Despite extremely favorable conditions , severe weather for the day was limited and the tornadoes generally caused minimal damage .

 During the morning hours of June 6 , two strong tornadoes caused damage throughout Wadena and Hubbard counties in Minnesota . The first tornado , rated EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale , touched down south of Stocking Lake and downed several trees onto cabins , vehicles and storage sheds . It also toppled an irrigation system in a field north of the lake . The tornado moved to the north and expanded to its maximum width of 450 yards ( 410 m ) and reached estimated peak winds of 130 miles per hour ( 210 km / h ) . Eight turkey barns were destroyed , killing an estimated 15 to 20 thousand turkeys . The tornado swept a home north of the area in Hubbard County off its foundation , as well as causing damage to several homes along with hundreds of acres of forest . One man working at a turkey barn was injured . The storm then produced an EF3 tornado , which eventually grew to a width of 400 yards ( 370 m ) and reached wind speeds of 160 miles per hour ( 260 km / h ) . At Pickerel Lake , it nearly flattened every tree in the area , while destroying a trailer home , a camper , a garage and a house . At northern sections of Pickerel Lake , one home had its roof torn off and numerous trees were snapped onto other residences and farm buildings . The tornado began to lose its intensity but continued to topple trees , damage storage structures and toss debris before dissipating in Emmaville .

 A series of impulses moved from the central Rocky Mountains into the central Great Plains . <unk> moisture formed over the Missouri and Mississippi Valleys with dew points reaching near 70 ° F ( 21 ° C ) . Strong low level winds over the area created favorable wind shear for supercells . During the afternoon , a supercell developed in western portions of Illinois and moved northeast reaching Lake Michigan around the Illinois @-@ Indiana border , during which it produced eight tornadoes along its path . At 4 : 21 pm ( 2121 UTC ) , an EF0 tornado occurred 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) east of Cornell in Livingston County . The tornado occurred in an open field with no damage observed . At 4 : 31 pm CDT ( <unk> UTC ) , an EF1 tornado touched down southwest of Dwight in Livingston County , snapping power poles and damaging trees and roofs ; this tornado lifted at 4 : 45 pm CDT ( 2145 UTC ) . From 5 : 18 pm CDT ( 2218 UTC ) to 5 : 46 pm CDT ( <unk> UTC ) , an EF2 tornado traveled 13 @.@ 6 miles ( 21 @.@ 9 km ) across southwestern Will County and extreme northwestern Kankakee County , near Wilmington , uprooting trees , damaging homes and destroying sheds . At 5 : 51 pm CDT ( <unk> UTC ) , an EF2 tornado touched down for three minutes in central Will County near Wilton Center , destroying a garage and severely damaging a metal building . From 5 : 55 pm CDT ( <unk> UTC ) to 6 : 08 pm CDT ( <unk> UTC ) , an EF2 tornado occurred west of <unk> , leveling barns , garages , and outbuildings and damaging homes . An EF2 tornado re @-@ formed at 6 : 13 pm CDT ( <unk> UTC ) , injuring six people as it crossed Interstate 57 . 
 As the tornado moved into more densely populated southern Cook County , it destroyed homes in <unk> Park , before dissipating at 6 : 30 pm CDT ( 2330 UTC ) . At approximately 6 : 32 pm CDT ( 2332 UTC ) , an EF0 tornado hit South Chicago Heights , causing minor damage to several homes , with two homes sustaining significant damage . At 6 : 49 pm CDT ( <unk> UTC ) , an EF0 tornado touched down in Lansing , damaging tree limbs . In Wisconsin , five people suffered minor injuries after an EF2 tornado went through Columbia County . Further west , a new complex of storms produced two tornadoes inside the Omaha metropolitan area during the early hours of June 8 . A total of 539 homeowners reported damage from the tornadoes . Seven homes were destroyed and 21 others sustained major damage . The two tornadoes that hit the region were rated EF1 and EF2 . The EF2 tornado was the strongest to strike the Omaha metropolitan area since 1975 .

 A storm system moved to the northern and central Great Plains region during the day , as strong winds helped push a moist air mass northward ahead of the system . Thunderstorms developed during the afternoon ahead of a cold front from southeast South Dakota into central Kansas . Strong winds along with instability in the atmosphere created favorable conditions for supercell development with the potential to produce strong tornadoes . At approximately 6 : 35 pm CDT ( 2335 UTC ) a tornado hit the Little Sioux Scout Ranch in Little Sioux , Iowa , killing four Boy Scouts after a chimney collapsed on them and injuring 48 others . The camp received a tornado warning 12 minutes before it struck . There were 93 campers and 25 staff members at the camp . The campers were between 13 and 18 years old and were attending a leadership training camp . The tornado was rated EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale . 
 Tornadoes also caused major damage in Kansas . In Chapman , one person was killed and three others were critically injured after an EF3 tornado struck the town . About 80 percent of Chapman suffered serious damage , with minor damage occurring to the downtown area . 70 homes in Chapman were destroyed with 215 receiving damage . Two churches were demolished and the town 's elementary , middle and high schools were severely damaged . Manhattan was also heavily impacted by a tornado that was rated EF4 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale . Forty @-@ five residences in Manhattan were destroyed , as well as two mobile homes and three businesses . An additional 67 residences , three multi @-@ family homes , one mobile home and 10 businesses suffered significant damage . Also , 75 single @-@ family residences , three multi @-@ family structures and 20 businesses sustained minor damage , and 637 residences , 93 multi @-@ family structures , 20 mobile homes and 10 businesses were partially affected . An elementary school was also heavily damaged in Manhattan . There was also damage to Kansas State University , where the Wind Erosion Lab was damaged . Also suffering severe damage was the engineering complex , the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity house , Waters , Call and Cardwell halls as well as Ward Hall , which houses the university 's nuclear reactor . One person was also killed near the town of Soldier in Jackson County from an EF2 tornado . 32 homes were damaged in Jackson County . The southern outskirts of Salina near the junction of Interstate 135 was also hard hit by an EF3 tornado . Several homes , outbuildings , trees and power lines were damaged in the area .

 The same series of systems contributed to a significant flooding event in many parts of the Midwest . Several counties in this region in Iowa , Illinois and Wisconsin were declared disaster areas . Over 10 inches ( 25 cm ) fell in areas over the course of a week , and in Indiana some rivers approached levels similar to flooding in 1913 which killed 200 people . In Franklin , Indiana , water at one point reached the first level of the area hospital , and buildings at Franklin College were damaged . Flooding was reported also in Columbus , <unk> and Terre Haute , Indiana . US Coast Guard units were deployed in assistance for rescue efforts . Parts of Interstate 65 and U.S. Route 31 were temporarily shut down . Thirty thousand people in Indiana lost power during the storms , and several counties filed disaster declarations . 
 Beginning on June 8 , flooding also started occurring across parts of Iowa following several round of thunderstorms and heavy rains . In Parkersburg , Iowa , a levee burst , flooding three nearby highways . In New Hartford , which was also hit by the same tornado , water gushed over a levee forcing the evacuation of 650 people . The flood waters also damaged a water treatment plant leaving Mason City without drinking water . Up to 5 inches ( 13 cm ) of rain fell in parts of the state . Mandatory evacuations were also made in Cedar Falls and Waterloo . Several entire blocks in Cedar Rapids were under water ( which was at times as high as stop signs ) after the Cedar River overflowed its banks . Flooding later affected the Iowa City area along the Iowa River where 20 buildings on the University of Iowa campus were affected . Many other towns across the state became flooded as well as the rising water levels slowly made their way into the Mississippi River across southeastern Iowa , western Illinois and northeastern Missouri . 
 Flooding was also reported north of Mason City in southeastern Minnesota , where several inches of rain closed roads and forced evacuations . Gays Mills , Wisconsin was evacuated for the second time in ten months when the Kickapoo River flooded the town . These same areas were also affected by the 2007 Midwest flooding . From June 3 to June 11 eight people were killed due to flooding ; three in Indiana , three in Michigan , and one in Illinois and Minnesota . 
 = Pax Mongolica = 
 The Pax Mongolica ( less often known as Pax <unk> ) ( Latin for " Mongol Peace " ) is a historiographical term , modeled after the original phrase Pax Romana , which describes the stabilizing effects of the conquests of the Mongol Empire on the social , cultural , and economic life of the inhabitants of the vast Eurasian territory that the Mongols conquered in the 13th and 14th centuries . The term is used to describe the eased communication and commerce the unified administration helped to create , and the period of relative peace that followed the Mongols ' vast conquests . 
 The conquests of Genghis Khan ( r . 1206 – 1227 ) and his successors , spanning from Southeast Asia to Eastern Europe , effectively connected the Eastern world with the Western world . The Silk Road , connecting trade centers across Asia and Europe , came under the sole rule of the Mongol Empire . It was commonly said that " a maiden bearing a nugget of gold on her head could wander safely throughout the realm " . Despite the political fragmentation of the Mongol Empire into four khanates ( Yuan dynasty , Golden Horde , Chagatai Khanate and Ilkhanate ) , nearly a century of conquest and civil war was followed by relative stability in the early 14th century . The end of the Pax Mongolica was marked by the disintegration of the khanates and the outbreak of the Black Death in Asia which spread along trade routes to much of the world in the mid @-@ 14th century . 
 = = Foundations = = 
 The foundations of the Pax Mongolica lie in the Mongol Empire beginning with Genghis Khan in the early 13th century . In the process of conquering the various tribes in the region , Genghis Khan revolutionized the way Mongolian tribal society was structured . After each new victory , more and more people were incorporated under Genghis Khan 's rule , thus diversifying the societal balance of the tribe . In 1203 , Genghis Khan , in an effort to strengthen his army , ordered a reform that reorganized his army 's structure while breaking down the traditional <unk> and kindred @-@ based divisions that had previously fragmented the society and military . He arranged his army into <unk> ( inter @-@ ethnic groups of ten ) , and the members of an <unk> were commanded to be loyal to one another regardless of ethnic origin . Ten <unk> made a <unk> , or a company ; ten <unk> made a <unk> , or a battalion ; and ten <unk> formed a <unk> , or an army of 10 @,@ 000 . This decimal system organization of Genghis Khan 's strong military would prove very effective in conquering , by persuasion or force , the many tribes of the central Asian steppe , but it would also strengthen Mongol society as a whole . By 1206 Genghis Khan 's military expansion had unified the tribes of Mongolia , and in the same year he was elected and acclaimed as the leader of Mongolia . 
 The new Mongol Nation quickly moved to annex more territory . The first Mongol conquests were campaigns against the Western Xia in northwestern China . In 1209 the Mongols conquered the Western Xia . Between 1213 and 1214 the Mongols conquered the Jin Empire , and by 1214 the Mongols had captured most of the land north of the Yellow River . In 1221 Mongol generals Jebe and <unk> began their expedition around the Caspian Sea and into Kievan Rus ' ; Genghis Khan defeated Turkic Jalal ad @-@ Din Mingburnu at the Battle of Indus and the war with the Khwarezmian Empire concluded the same year . In 1235 the Mongols invaded Korea . Two years later in 1237 Batu Khan and <unk> began their conquest of Rus ' ; they invaded Poland and Hungary in 1241 . In 1252 the Mongols began their invasion of Southern China ; they would seize the capital of Hangzhou in 1276 . In 1258 Hulagu Khan captured Baghdad . 
 Each new victory gave the Mongols the chance to incorporate new peoples , especially foreign engineers and laborers , into their society . Each new conquest also acquired new trade routes and the opportunity to control taxation and tribute . Thus , through territorial expansion , the Mongol Nation not only became an empire , but it also became more technologically and economically advanced . 
 = = Trade network = = 
 At its height , the Mongolian empire stretched from Shanhaiguan in the east to Budapest in the west , from Rus ' in the north to Tibet in the south . This meant that an extremely large part of the continent was united under one political authority . As a result , the trade routes used by merchants became safe for travel , resulting in an overall growth and expansion of trade from China in the east to Britain in the west . Thus , the Pax Mongolica greatly influenced many civilizations in Eurasia during the 13th and 14th centuries . 
 = = = World trade system = = = 
 Before the Mongols ' rise , the Old World system consisted of isolated imperial systems . The new Mongol empire amalgamated the once isolated civilizations into a new continental system , and re @-@ established the Silk Road as a dominant method of transportation . The unification of Eurasia under the Mongols greatly diminished the amount of competing tribute gatherers throughout the trade network and assured greater safety and security in travel . During the Pax Mongolica , European merchants like Marco Polo made their way from Europe to China on the well @-@ maintained and well @-@ traveled roads that linked Anatolia to China . 
 On the Silk Road caravans with Chinese silk ; pepper , ginger , cinnamon , and nutmeg came to the West from the Spice Islands via the transcontinental trade routes . Eastern diets were introduced to Europeans as well . Indian muslins , cottons , pearls , and precious stones were sold in Europe , as well as weapons , carpets , and leather goods from Iran . Gunpowder was also introduced to Europe from China . In the opposite direction , Europeans sent silver , fine cloth , horses , linen , and other goods to the near and far East . Increasing trade and commerce meant that the respective nations and societies increased their exposure to new goods and markets , thus increasing the GDP of each nation or society that was involved in the trade system . <unk> of the cities participating in the 13th century world trade system grew rapidly in size . 
 Along with land trade routes , a Maritime Silk Road contributed to the flow of goods and establishment of a Pax Mongolica . This Maritime Silk Road started with short coastal routes in Southern China . As technology and navigation progressed these routes developed into a high @-@ seas route into the Indian Ocean . Eventually these routes further developed encompassing the Arabian Sea , Persian Gulf , Red Sea , and the sea off East Africa . 
 Along with tangible goods , people , techniques , information , and ideas moved lucidly across the Eurasian landmass for the first time . For example , John of Montecorvino , archbishop of Peking founded Roman Catholic missions in India and China and also translated the New Testament into the Mongolian language . Long @-@ distance trade brought new methods of doing business from the far East to Europe ; bills of exchange , deposit banking , and insurance were introduced to Europe during the Pax Mongolica . Bills of exchange made it significantly easier to travel long distances because a traveler would not be burdened by the weight of metal coins . 
 Islamic methods of mathematics , astronomy , and science made their way to Africa , East Asia and Europe during the Pax Mongolica . Methods of paper @-@ making and printing made their way from China to Europe . During the Pax Mongolica rudimentary banking systems were established , and money changing and credit extension were common , resulting in large amount of merchant wealth . 
 = = = Mongol administration = = = 
 Mongolia 's central geographical position on the Asian continent was an important reason why it was able to play such a large role in the trade system . The Mongol army was easily able to assert strong rule throughout most of the empire . The military ensured that supply lines and trade routes flowed smoothly ; permanent garrisons were established along trade routes to protect the travelers on these routes . Complex local systems of taxation and extortion that were prevalent before Mongol rule were abolished to ensure the smooth flow of merchants and trade through the empire . A system of weights @-@ and @-@ measures was also standardized . To make the voyage on the trade routes less harrowing , the Mongols went as far as to plant trees along the roads to shade the merchants and travelers in the summer months ; stone pillars were used to mark the roads where trees could not grow . 
 The Mongols sought alliances with other nations and societies to ensure the flow of trade through the empire . The Mongol army was also used to reshape and streamline the flow of trade through the continent by destroying cities on the less @-@ important or more inaccessible routes . The Mongol military was mostly made up of cavalrymen . This allowed the military to move swiftly and easily over large distances . 
 The code of Mongol law , known as the Yassa ( " Great Law " ) , decreed strict rules and punishments in many areas of the Mongolian Empire 's society , especially those areas concerning trade and commerce . The Yassa helped suppress the traditional causes of tribal feuding and war , thus helping to ensure a peaceful trading and traveling environment ; theft and animal rustling were outlawed , and the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan even established a massive lost @-@ and @-@ found system . Harsh penalties including a retribution of nine times the original value of stolen goods helped deter theft on Mongol roads . The Yassa also decreed complete religious freedom , ensuring that Buddhists , Muslims , Christians , etc . , were all allowed to travel freely throughout the empire ; religious leaders were also exempted from taxation , as were doctors , lawyers , undertakers , teachers , and scholars . The Yassa did allow for flexibility and it usually adapted , absorbed , or built upon legal systems in remote parts of the empire , thus maintaining a level of openness to various societies and ensuring peace and stability . 
 In order to ensure Mongol law was enforced , a hierarchy of legal administration was developed . This was headed by the <unk> Council " chug @-@ shu @-@ sheng " of the central government which oversaw 10 provincial governments known as " Hsing @-@ sheng " . The <unk> @-@ sheng was further split into smaller districts which handled legal cases . A police commissioner known as " hsien wei " was entrusted with law enforcement and had the authority to arrest suspects . This method of federalizing the empire made it easier and more efficient for laws to be administered throughout the continent . 
 = = = Postal system = = = 
 The Mongols established the Yam ( Mongolian : <unk> , <unk> , checkpoint ) , the first system of communication that connected the Far East and the West . Relay stations were set up every 25 – 30 miles or an average day ’ s journey on horse . These stations were introduced by Ögedei Khan in 1234 and supplied fresh horses and fodder . His brothers Chagatai Khan and Tolui and his nephew Batu Khan further extended this network . 
 The Mongol army administered the Yam . The Yam stretched across Mongol territory from Eastern Europe to the Pacific Ocean . The routes were well organized , funded , maintained , and administrated by the Mongols . This highly sophisticated system of communication and travel made it relatively easy to send important messages and travel long distances in relatively short amounts of time . As a result of the relatively lucid communication and ease of movement , the Mongols were able to govern their vast empire effectively , thus ensuring political and economic stability . 
 = = Decline = = 
 The decline of the period of the Pax Mongolica was a result of a number of factors , these being incompetent and rivaling leaders , corruption , revolts , decadence , factional struggles , assassinations , external attacks , and disease . The decline of the Pax Mongolica resulted in a decline of eased trade between East and West . 
 = = = Decline of Mongol rule = = = 
 The Mongol Empire , near the time of its decline , consisted of many different territories that varied from one to another . Each territory was defined as a " khanate " . Due to the isolation of the Mongolian world , many rulers in the 14th century started to focus on their own khanates . 
 Religious intolerance was one particular factor in the decline of the Pax Mongolica . In Rus ' , the Mongols ( known as the Golden Horde ) , gradually lost power and territory due to intolerance specifically geared towards different religions . The Rus ' Mongols converted to Islam and joined the Egyptian Mamluks for political reasons . At one point in the war the Golden Horde even fought the Persian Mongols . However , the eastern part of the Golden Horde , White Horde , had friendly relations with the Ilkhanate and the Great Khan . The decentralization occurred because communication was so difficult due to the collapsing trade system and the rivalry between Mongol princes . Eventually , the Persian Mongol leader Ghazan converted to Islam in 1295 . This contributed to the growing power of <unk> ; a Muslim Oirat general . 
 In China , descendants of Kublai Khan claimed the Mongols weakened their power by becoming " too Chinese " . This led to Yuan emperors separating themselves from their subjects in order to stress their Mongol identity and to reject their Chinese culture . Kublai Khan once promoted Chinese culture and the importance of its practice but under the Yuan emperors this was now prohibited . As the Chinese culture was changing , intolerance became more common . Some Chinese thought that they were planning to kill Chinese children and perform sexual rituals on them . This led many Chinese to become xenophobic towards the Mongols . This xenophobia led Chinese rulers to expel the Mongols from China and to isolate China from the rest of the world trade system . 
 = = = The Black Death = = = 
 The segregation and fragmentation of the respective khanates in the Mongol Empire were not the only factors in contributing to the decline of the Pax Mongolica . The outbreak of bubonic plague , or Black Death , also played a devastating role in the decline of the Pax Mongolica . Because the Mongol Empire bridged once isolated regions , it made it easy for the Black Death to spread rapidly . Historian William H. McNeill has noted that the plague was transferred from ground rodents living in southern Chinese and Burmese Himalayan foothills to Mongol soldiers when they invaded the area in 1252 . In 1331 the plague was noted in China , and from east Asia it was carried west along the trade routes by merchants and Mongol soldiers who were able to so freely and quickly travel across the continent during the Pax Mongolica . Plague @-@ infected fleas hitched rides in the manes of horses , on the hair of camels , or on black rats that nestled in cargoes or in saddlebags . The Black Death is estimated to have killed one @-@ third of China 's population and 25 to 50 percent of Europe 's population . 
 Demographically weakened , the Mongols were not able to exert their rule over remote domains in their empire , who began to revolt once the plague broke out . These revolts disrupted the production of goods and flow of trade , which ended the Pax Mongolica . 
 = = = Effects on trade = = = 
 Over the next 300 years China would become extremely isolated from foreign merchants ; China prohibited foreigners or foreign trade and languages other than Chinese . Confucianism and Taoism were reinstated as the national religion and the Chinese experienced cultural stagnation . During the early years of the Ming @-@ dynasty trade with the rest of the world declined . This is attributed to war , epidemics and widespread disruptions rather than " symbolic policy change " . Economic difficulties also contributed to the decline as an important world trade player . The Black Death quickly spread to the rest of the world trade system , and the long @-@ distance trading that was common and applauded during the Pax Mongolica almost entirely stopped . 
 = = Personnel exchanges = = 
 Under the Mongols new technologies and commodities were exchanged across the Old World , particularly Eurasia . Professor Thomas <unk> noted many personnel exchanges occurred during the Mongol period . There were many significant developments in economy ( especially trade and public finance ) , military , medicine , agriculture , cuisine , astronomy , printing , geography , and historiography , which were not limited to Eurasia but also included North Africa . The Mongolian Empire functioned as the principal cultural clearing house for the Old World until its downturn when it was gradually replaced by maritime Europe which in time came to perform similar offices for the Old World and the New .

 = John MacBride ( Royal Navy officer ) = 
 John MacBride ( c . 1735 – 17 February 1800 ) was an officer of the Royal Navy and a politician who saw service during the Seven Years ' War , the American War of Independence and the French Revolutionary Wars , eventually rising to the rank of Admiral of the Blue . 
 MacBride entered the navy after serving on merchant vessels and distinguished himself in a number of actions during the Seven Years ' War , including cutting out a privateer , which secured him the rank of post @-@ captain by the end of the conflict . He was instrumental in establishing and securing a British settlement on the Falkland Islands in the years of peace which followed , and also performed service to the Royal Family by transporting the King 's sister , Caroline Matilda . Still in active service by the outbreak of war with the American colonies , MacBride took command of a ship of the line and saw action in engagements under Keppel and Rodney . He was also active against privateers , capturing the Comte d 'Artois in a heated battle off the Irish coast . Further service followed with Parker 's fleet against the Dutch and with Barrington in the Channel . 
 MacBride ended the war serving ashore in Ireland , and in 1784 embarked on a political career , becoming MP for Plymouth . Promoted to flag rank with the outbreak of war with Revolutionary France , he commanded squadrons off the enemy coasts , and transported troops to support land operations on the continent . His last active service was in 1795 , though he was promoted to Admiral of the Blue shortly before his death in 1800 . 
 = = Family and early life = = 
 John MacBride was born in Scotland around 1735 , the second son of the Presbyterian minister Robert MacBride . The <unk> moved to Ireland shortly after John 's birth , when Robert became minister of <unk> , in County Antrim . John 's brother , David MacBride , became a noted medical writer . John MacBride initially went to sea with the merchant service in 1751 , and joined the navy as an able seaman three years later , in 1754 . He served first aboard the 24 @-@ gun HMS Garland in the West Indies for a number of years , before returning to British wars and serving aboard HMS Norfolk , the flagship in the Downs for a few months . 
 MacBride passed his lieutenant 's examination on 6 October 1758 , and received his commission on 27 October . He was moved into the hired cutter Grace , and in August 1761 came across a French privateer anchored in the Dunkirk roadstead . MacBride made contact with the frigate HMS Maidstone and asked her captain for four armed and manned boats . Maidstone 's captain readily agreed , and at 10 o 'clock that night the boats left the British ships and approached the privateer with muffled oars . They came within pistol shot and hailed the French vessel , and on receiving no reply , boarded her . The British boarded on both sides of the vessel , and carried the ship with two men wounded . MacBride himself shot and killed the French lieutenant as he aimed a gun at the British boat . The total French losses were two dead and five wounded . Having secured the vessel , the British took her out to sea under the guns of a French battery . 
 MacBride 's good service brought him a promotion to master and commander on 7 April 1762 , and an appointment to command the fireship HMS Grampus . From there he moved to command the sloop HMS Cruizer on 27 May 1763 , still at the rank of commander . After some time spent on the Home station , MacBride received a promotion to post @-@ captain on 20 June 1765 , and took command of the 30 @-@ gun HMS Renown . This was followed in August 1765 with command of the 32 @-@ gun HMS Jason , and a mission to establish a colony on the Falkland Islands . 
 = = Falkland Islands = = 
 MacBride arrived with Jason , HMS Carcass and the storeship HMS Experiment , in January 1766 , with orders to secure a settlement and to inform any existing inhabitants that the islands were a British possession . The British consolidated Port Egmont , made several cruises in the surrounding waters , and in December came across the French settlement . In a cordial meeting MacBride informed the French governor M. de Neville of the British claim , which the French politely rejected . Unbeknownst to both de Neville and MacBride , Louis Antoine de Bougainville , who had established the French settlement , had agreed to sell the colony to Spain . The resulting tensions between the Spanish and British claims would nearly lead to war in 1770 , but in the meantime MacBride returned home , reporting the situation to the government . He later published a 13 @-@ page monograph , probably in 1770 , entitled A Journal of the Winds and Weather ... at Falkland Islands from 1 February 1766 to 19 January 1767 . 
 = = Interwar years = = 
 After his return to Britain MacBride was given command of the 22 @-@ gun HMS Seaford in August 1767 and employed to cruise in the English Channel . He spent several years aboard Seaford , before transferring to take command of the 32 @-@ gun HMS Arethusa in March 1771 , followed by the 32 @-@ gun HMS Southampton in August that year . He was in command of Southampton in May 1772 when he received orders to command a small squadron tasked with transporting Caroline Matilda , former Queen of Denmark and Norway and sister of King George III , from Elsinore to Stadt . The squadron consisted of Southampton , and two of MacBride 's former commands , Seaford , and Cruizer . In April 1773 he took command of HMS Orpheus . 
 = = American War of Independence = = 
 With the outbreak of war with the American colonies , MacBride was appointed to take command of the 64 @-@ gun HMS Bienfaisant on 6 November 1776 . He was present at the Battle of Ushant on 28 July 1778 , but did not become heavily engaged in the confused action . In the ensuing argument over the outcome of the battle , MacBride gave evidence in favour of Admiral Keppel that was an important factor in Keppel 's acquittal at his court @-@ martial . MacBride was less supportive of Sir Hugh Palliser . He remained in command of Bienfaisant , and in December joined Sir George Rodney 's fleet to relieve Gibraltar . During the voyage the British fleet came across a Spanish convoy transporting naval stores from San Sebastián to Cádiz , and engaged it . The British succeeded in capturing the convoy , while MacBride distinguished himself in engaging the Spanish flagship <unk> , which surrendered to him . 
 On 16 January the fleet again encountered Spanish ships , this time off Cape St. Vincent . The Spanish fleet , under Admiral Juan de Lángara , were engaged in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent , and again MacBride was in the thick of the action . He took his ship in to engage the San Domingo , with the Bienfaisant narrowly escaping significant damage after her opponent blew up . He then went on to chase down and capture Lángara 's flagship , the 80 @-@ gun Fenix . MacBride sent Lieutenant Thomas Louis aboard to take possession , but as a smallpox outbreak was raging on the Bienfaisant , MacBride did not take the usual step of transferring some of the captured officers and men aboard his own ship . Instead he reached an agreement with de Lángara , that should the ships encounter a French or Spanish force , he would allow the Fenix to be defended against them . If the Bienfaisant escaped but the Fenix was retaken , de Lángara and his men would consider themselves to still be prisoners of war , but if Fenix escaped and Bienfaisant was taken , then de Lángara and his men would be freed . In any event both ships made it to Gibraltar without incident , after which MacBride was given the honour of taking Rodney 's despatches back to Britain . MacBride set off at once , but was delayed by adverse winds . Consequently , his despatches arrived several days after an identical set had reached London , delivered by Captain Edward Thomson , who had left Rodney later than MacBride , but who had had a faster voyage . 
 = = = MacBride and the Artois connection = = = 
 Rodney 's fleet returned to Britain in March , and MacBride rejoined the Bienfaisant . In early August a large French privateer , the 64 @-@ gun Comte d 'Artois , was reported to have sailed from Brest to cruise off the Irish south coast . MacBride was ordered to sail in company with the 44 @-@ gun HMS Charon and to capture the dangerous vessel . After several days in search of the vessel , a mysterious sail was finally sighted early on 13 August , chasing after some of the ships of a convoy departing from Cork . MacBride ranged up and fell in with the unidentified ship , which hoisted English colours . Both ships came within pistol shot , and it was not until there was some communication between the two ships , that MacBride could be satisfied of her identity . By now the two ships were so close , with Bienfaisant off the Comte de 'Artois 's bow , that neither ship could bring their main guns to bear . Instead both ships opened fire with muskets until MacBride could manoeuvre away and a general action ensued . After an hour and ten minutes the French vessel surrendered , having had 21 killed and 35 wounded , while Bienfaisant had three killed and 20 wounded . The Charon had only joined the action towards the end of the engagement and had a single man wounded . The capture had an unusual sequel , for just over a year later , and under a different captain , Bienfaisant captured another privateer , this time named Comtesse d 'Artois . 
 In a further coincidence MacBride was appointed in January 1781 to command the 40 @-@ gun HMS Artois , a former French ship captured in 1780 by HMS Romney . MacBride served in the North Sea with Sir Hyde Parker 's fleet , and fought against the Dutch at the Battle of Dogger Bank on 5 August 1781 . After the battle Parker temporarily moved MacBride into the 80 @-@ gun HMS Princess Amelia , whose captain , John <unk> , had been killed during the battle . MacBride resumed command of Artois after the fleet 's return to port , and continued to cruise in the North Sea . On 3 December he engaged and captured two large 24 @-@ gun Dutch privateers , the Hercules and Mars . Nine men were killed and fifteen wounded on Mars , while 13 were killed and 20 wounded on Hercules . Artois had one man killed and six wounded . 
 By 1782 MacBride was operating in the Channel , and in April was sent out as a scout ahead of the main force under Admiral Samuel Barrington , which aimed to intercept a French squadron that had left Brest bound for the East Indies . He sighted the force on 20 April and alerted Barrington . The British moved in and that day and the following captured over half of the French force . After this success MacBride was appointed to the Irish station in June , where he worked in the impress service while Artois cruised under her first lieutenant . 
 = = Years of peace = = 
 At the end of the war with America , MacBride left the Artois , but in June was able to obtain command of the 32 @-@ gun HMS Druid . He commanded her until the end of the year , after which he was temporarily unemployed at sea . MacBride took this opportunity to enter politics , and in 1784 he was elected as MP for Plymouth , holding the seat until 1790 . He gave several speeches on naval matters , and sat on the Duke of Richmond 's commission into the defences of Portsmouth and Plymouth between 1785 and 1786 . He opposed a plan for fortifying the naval dockyards , both on the commission and in parliament . In 1788 he returned to an active , though not a seagoing command , when he took over the Plymouth guardship , the 74 @-@ gun HMS Cumberland . By 1790 , with the threat of the Spanish Armament looming , MacBride took Cumberland to Torbay to join the fleet assembling there under Lord Howe .

 MacBride was promoted to rear @-@ admiral on 1 February 1793 , as part of the general promotion following the outbreak of war . He became commander @-@ in @-@ chief on the Downs station , commanding a frigate squadron with his flag in Cumberland , later transferring his flag to the 32 @-@ gun HMS Quebec . He took possession of Ostend after the French retreat in early 1793 , and in October transported reinforcements under General Sir Charles Grey to assist in the defence of Dunkirk . He took command of the 36 @-@ gun HMS Flora at the end of the year and sailed from Portsmouth on 1 December carrying an army under the Earl of Moira to support French royalists in Brittany and Normandy . 
 Following this service he took command of a small squadron in the Western Approaches , flying his flag in a number of different vessels , including the sloop HMS Echo , the 74 @-@ gun HMS Minotaur and the 64 @-@ gun HMS Sceptre . The squadron did not achieve any significant successes , and MacBride had the misfortune to break his leg while mounting his horse , forcing him to temporarily relinquish his duties . He was promoted to rear @-@ admiral of the red on 11 April , and on 4 July to vice @-@ admiral of the blue . Promoted to vice @-@ admiral of the white on 1 June 1795 , MacBride became commander of the squadron in the North Sea assigned to watch the Dutch fleet in the Texel , flying his flag in the 74 @-@ gun HMS Russell . He stepped down from the post in late 1795 , and was not actively employed at sea again . He was promoted to admiral of the blue on 14 February 1799 . Admiral John MacBride died of a paralytic seizure at the Spring Garden Coffee House , London on 17 February 1800 .

 MacBride married early in his career , but no details are known , other than that his wife was the daughter of a naval officer . She is presumed to have died , for MacBride married Ursula Folkes , eldest daughter of William Folkes of <unk> Hall , Norfolk on 14 July 1774 . Their son , John David MacBride , became principal of Magdalen Hall , Oxford . MacBride 's daughter , Charlotte , married Admiral Willoughby Lake in 1795 . 
 = WWV ( radio station ) = 
 WWV is the call sign of the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology 's ( NIST ) HF ( " shortwave " ) radio station near Fort Collins , Colorado . WWV continuously transmits official U.S. Government frequency and time signals on 2 @.@ 5 , 5 , 10 , 15 and 20 MHz . These carrier frequencies and time signals are controlled by local atomic clocks traceable to NIST 's primary standard in Boulder , Colorado by GPS common view observations and other time transfer methods . NIST also operates the very similar radio station WWVH in Kauai , Hawaii . WWV and WWVH make recorded announcements ; since they share frequencies , WWV uses a male voice to distinguish itself from WWVH , which uses a female voice . They also make other recorded announcements of general interest , e.g. , the GPS satellite constellation status and severe oceanic weather warnings . WWV shares its site near Fort Collins with radio station WWVB that transmits carrier and time code ( no voice ) on 60 kHz in the LF ( " longwave " ) band . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Launch = = = 
 WWV is the oldest continuously @-@ operating radio station in the United States , first going on the air from Washington , D.C. in May 1920 , approximately six months before the launch of KDKA . The station first broadcast Friday evening concerts on 600 kHz , and its signal could be heard 40 kilometers ( 25 mi ) from Washington . On December 15 , 1920 , WWV began broadcasting on 750 kHz , distributing Morse code news reports from the Department of Agriculture . This signal could be heard up to 300 kilometers ( 190 mi ) from Washington . These news broadcasts ended on April 15 , 1921 . 
 = = = Standard frequency signals = = = 
 At the end of 1922 , WWV 's purpose shifted to broadcasting standard frequency signals . These signals were desperately needed by other broadcasters , because equipment limitations at the time meant that the broadcasters could not stay on their assigned frequencies . Testing began on January 29 , 1923 , and frequencies from 200 to 545 kHz were broadcast . Frequency broadcasts officially began on March 6 , 1923 . The frequencies were accurate to " better than three @-@ tenths of one percent . " At first , the transmitter had to be manually switched from one frequency to the next , using a <unk> . The first quartz oscillators were invented in the mid @-@ 1920s , and they greatly improved the accuracy of WWV 's frequency broadcasts . 
 In 1926 , WWV was nearly shut down . Its signal could only cover the eastern half of the United States , and other stations located in Minneapolis and at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were slowly making WWV redundant . The station 's impending shutdown was announced in 1926 , but it was saved by a flood of protests from citizens who relied on the service . Later , in 1931 , WWV underwent an upgrade . Its transmitter , now directly controlled by a quartz oscillator , was moved to College Park , Maryland . Broadcasts began on 5 MHz . A year later , the station was moved again , to Department of Agriculture land in Beltsville , Maryland . Broadcasts were added on 10 and 15 MHz , power was increased , and time signals , an <unk> tone , and ionosphere reports were all added to the broadcast in June 1937 . 
 WWV was nearly destroyed by a fire on November 6 , 1940 . The frequency and transmitting equipment was recovered , and the station was back on the air ( with reduced power ) on November 11 . Congress funded a new station in July 1941 , and it was built 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) south of the former location , still referred to as Beltsville ( although in 1961 the name used for the transmitter location would be changed to Greenbelt , Maryland ) . WWV resumed normal broadcasts on 2 @.@ 5 , 5 , 10 , and 15 MHz on August 1 , 1943 . 
 = = = Time signals = = = 
 WWV 's primary purpose today ( and for most of its existence ) is to disseminate the " official U.S. time " ( provided by government entities such as NIST and USNO ) to ensure that uniform time is maintained throughout the United States and around the world . The time signals generated by WWV allow time @-@ keeping devices such as radio @-@ controlled clocks to automatically maintain accurate time without the need for manual adjustment . These time signals are used by commercial and institutional interests where accuracy is essential and time plays a vital role in daily operations - these include shipping , transport , technology , research , education , military , public safety and telecommunications . It is of particular importance in broadcasting , whether it be commercial , public , or private interests such as amateur radio operators . WWV provides a public service by making time information readily available at all hours and at no monetary charge ( other than the cost of the receiving equipment itself ) . 
 WWV had been broadcasting second pulses since 1937 , but these pulses were not tied to actual time . In June 1944 , the United States Naval Observatory allowed WWV to use the USNO 's clock as a source for its time signals . Over a year later , in October 1945 , WWV broadcast Morse code time announcements every five minutes . Voice announcements started on January 1 , 1950 , and were broadcast every five minutes . Frequencies of 600 Hz and 440 Hz were broadcast during alternating minutes . By this time , WWV was broadcasting on 2 @.@ 5 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , and 35 MHz . The 30 and 35 MHz broadcasts were ended in 1953 . 
 A binary @-@ coded decimal time code began testing in 1960 , and became permanent in 1961 . This " NASA time code " was modulated onto a 1000 Hz audio tone at 100 Hz , sounding somewhat like a monotonous repeated " <unk> @-@ bong " . The code was also described as sounding like a " buzz @-@ saw " . On July 1 , 1971 , the time code 's broadcast was changed to the present 100 Hz subcarrier , which is inaudible when using a normal radio ( but can be heard using headphones or recorded using a chart recorder ) . 
 WWV moved to its present location near Fort Collins on December 1 , 1966 , enabling better reception of its signal throughout the continental United States . WWVB signed on in that location three years earlier . In April 1967 , WWV stopped using the local time of the transmitter site ( Eastern Time until 1966 , and Mountain Time afterwards ) and switched to broadcasting Greenwich Mean Time or GMT . The station switched again , to Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) , in 1974 . 
 The 20 and 25 MHz broadcasts were discontinued in 1977 , but the 20 MHz broadcast was reinstated the next year . As of April 4 , 2014 , the 25 MHz signal has been back on the air in an ' experimental ' mode . The voice used on WWV was that of Don Elliott Heald until August 13 , 1991 , when equipment changes required rerecording the announcer 's voice . The one used at that time was that of John Doyle , but was soon switched to the voice of KSFO morning host Lee Rodgers . 
 The radio signals of WWV , WWVB and WWVH , along with the atomic clocks that their time signals derive from , are maintained by NIST 's Time and Frequency Division , which is based in nearby Boulder , Colorado . The Time and Frequency Division is part of the NIST 's Physics Laboratory , based in Gaithersburg , Maryland . NIST 's predecessor , the National Bureau of Standards , previously maintained WWV as a part of the Department of Agriculture ; NIST is currently part of the Department of Commerce . 
 = = = WWV and Sputnik = = = 
 WWV 's 20 MHz signal was used for a unique purpose in 1958 : to track the disintegration of Russian satellite Sputnik I after the craft 's onboard electronics failed . Dr. John D. Kraus , a professor at Ohio State University , knew that a meteor entering the upper atmosphere leaves in its wake a small amount of ionized air . This air reflects a stray radio signal back to Earth , strengthening the signal at the surface for a few seconds . This effect is known as meteor scatter . Dr. Kraus figured that what was left of Sputnik would exhibit the same effect , but on a larger scale . His prediction was correct ; WWV 's signal was noticeably strengthened for durations lasting over a minute . In addition , the strengthening came from a direction and at a time of day that agreed with predictions of the paths of Sputnik 's last orbits . Using this information , Dr. Kraus was able to draw up a complete timeline of Sputnik 's disintegration . In particular , he observed that satellites do not fall as one unit ; instead , the spacecraft broke up into its component parts as it moved closer to Earth . 
 = = = Call Sign = = = 
 WWV is one of a small number of radio stations west of the Mississippi River with a call sign beginning with W. The W call sign stems from the station 's early locations in D.C. and Maryland — the call sign was maintained when the federal government moved the station to Colorado — and the fact that WWV , being a government station , does not fall within the FCC 's jurisdiction with respect to call signs . How and why the call sign WWV was assigned to the time signal station are not known . However FCC regulations do dictate that time stations are to be issued call signs beginning with " WWV " . 
 = = Broadcast format = = 
 On top of the standard carrier frequencies , WWV carries additional information using standard double @-@ sideband amplitude modulation . WWV 's transmissions follow a regular pattern repeating each minute . They are coordinated with its sister station WWVH to limit interference between them . Because they are so similar , both are described here . 
 = = = Date and time = = = 
 WWV transmits the date and exact time as follows : 
 English @-@ language voice announcements of time . 
 Binary @-@ coded decimal time code of date and time , transmitted as varying length pulses of 100 Hz tone , one bit per second . 
 In both cases the transmitted time is given in Coordinated Universal Time ( UTC ) . 
 = = = Per @-@ second ticks and minute markers = = = 
 WWV transmits audio " ticks " once per second , to allow for accurate manual clock synchronization . These ticks are always transmitted , even during voice announcements and silent periods . Each tick begins on the second , lasts 5 ms and consists of 5 cycles of a 1000 Hz sine wave . To make the tick stand out more , all other signals are suppressed for 40 ms , from 10 ms before the second until 30 ms after ( 25 ms after the tick ) . As an exception , no tick ( and no silent interval ) is transmitted at 29 or 59 seconds past the minute . In the event of a leap second , no tick is transmitted during second 60 of the minute , either . 
 On the minute , the tick is extended to a 0 @.@ 8 second long beep , followed by 0 @.@ 2 s of silence . On the hour , this minute pulse is transmitted at 1500 Hz rather than 1000 . The beginning of the tone corresponds to the start of the minute . 
 Between seconds one and sixteen inclusive past the minute , the current difference between UTC and UT1 is transmitted by doubling some of the once @-@ per @-@ second ticks , transmitting a second tick 100 ms after the first . ( The second tick preempts other transmissions , but does not get a silent zone . ) The absolute value of this difference , in tenths of a second , is determined by the number of doubled ticks . The sign is determined by the position : If the doubled ticks begin at second one , UT1 is ahead of UTC ; if they begin at second nine , UT1 is behind UTC . 
 WWVH transmits similar 5 ms ticks , but they are sent as 6 cycles of 1200 Hz . The minute beep is also 1200 Hz , except on the hour when it is 1500 Hz . 
 The ticks and minute tones are transmitted at 100 % modulation ( 0 dBFS ) . 
 = = = Voice time announcements = = = 
 Voice announcements of time of day are made at the end of every minute , giving the time of the following minute beep . The format for the voice announcement is , " At the tone , X hours , Y minute ( s ) , Coordinated Universal Time . " The announcement is in a male voice and begins 7 @.@ 5 seconds before the minute tone . 
 WWVH makes an identical time announcement , starting 15 seconds before the minute tone , in a female voice . 
 When voice announcements were first instituted , they were phrased as follows : " National Bureau of Standards , WWV ; when the tone returns , [ time ] Eastern Standard Time . " After the 1967 switch to UTC , the announcement changed to " National Bureau of Standards , WWV , Fort Collins , Colorado ; next tone begins at X hours , Y minute ( s ) , Greenwich Mean Time . " However , this format would be short @-@ lived . The announcement was changed again to the current format in 1971 . 
 Voice time announcements are sent at 75 % modulation , i.e. the carrier varies between 25 % and 175 % of nominal power . 
 = = = Standard frequencies = = = 
 WWV and WWVH transmit 44 seconds of audio tone in most minutes . It begins after the 1 @-@ second minute mark and continues until the beginning of the WWVH time announcement 45 seconds after the minute . 
 Even minutes ( except for minute 2 ) transmit 500 Hz , while 600 Hz is heard during odd minutes . The tone is interrupted for 40 ms each second by the second ticks . WWVH is similar , but exchanges the two tones : 600 Hz during even minutes and 500 Hz during odd . 
 WWV also transmits a 440 Hz tone , a pitch commonly used in music ( <unk> , the note A above middle C ) during minute : 02 of each hour , except for the first hour of the UTC day . Since the 440 Hz tone is only transmitted once per hour , many chart recorders may use this tone to mark off each hour of the day , and likewise , the omission of the 440 Hz tone once per day can be used to mark off each twenty @-@ four @-@ hour period . WWVH transmits the same tone during minute : 01 of each hour . 
 No tone is transmitted during voice announcements from either WWV or WWVH ; the latter causes WWV to transmit no tone during minutes : 43 – : 51 ( inclusive ) and minutes : 29 and : 59 of each hour . Likewise , WWVH transmits no tone during minutes : 00 , : 30 , : 08 – : 10 and : 14 – : 19 . 
 Audio tones and other voice announcements are sent at 50 % modulation . 
 = = = Other voice announcements = = = 
 WWV transmits the following 44 @-@ second voice announcements ( in lieu of the standard frequency tones ) on an hourly schedule : 
 A station identification at : 00 and : 30 past each hour ; 
 marine storm warnings , provided by the National Weather Service , for the Atlantic Ocean at : 08 and : 09 minutes past , and for the Pacific Ocean at : 10 past ; 
 at : 14 and : 15 past , GPS satellite health reports from the Coast Guard Navigation Center ; 
 at : 18 past , a special " geophysical alert " report from NOAA is transmitted , containing information on solar activity and shortwave radio propagation conditions . These particular alerts were to be discontinued on September 6 , 2011 . However , as of June 17 , 2011 , WWV is announcing at : 18 past that the decision has been retracted and that the geophysical alert reports " will continue for the foreseeable future " . 
 Additional time slots are normally transmitted as a standard frequency tone , but can be preempted by voice messages if necessary : 
 At : 04 and : 16 past the hour , NIST broadcasts any announcements regarding a manual change in the operation of WWV and WWVH , such as leap second announcements . These minutes are marked in the broadcast schedule as " NIST Reserved " . When not used , a 500 Hz tone is broadcast . 
 Minute 11 is used for additional storm warnings if necessary . If not , a 600 Hz tone is transmitted . 
 WWVH transmits the same information on a different schedule . WWV and WWVH 's voice announcements are timed to avoid crosstalk ; WWV airs dead air when WWVH airs voice announcements , and vice versa . WWVH 's storm warnings cover the area around the Hawaiian islands and the Far East rather than North America . 
 = = = = Digital time code = = = = 
 Time of day is also continuously transmitted using a digital time code , interpretable by radio @-@ controlled clocks . The time code uses a 100 Hz subcarrier of the main signal . That is , it is an additional low @-@ level 100 Hz tone added to the other AM audio signals . 
 This code is similar to , and has the same framework as , the IRIG H time code and the time code that WWVB transmits , except the individual fields of the code are rearranged and are transmitted with the least significant bit sent first . Like the IRIG timecode , the time transmitted is the time of the start of the minute . Also like the IRIG timecode , numeric data ( minute , hour , day of year , and last two digits of year ) are sent in binary @-@ coded decimal ( <unk> ) format rather than as simple binary integers : Each decimal digit is sent as two , three , or four bits ( depending on its possible range of values ) . 
 = = = = = Bit encoding = = = = = 
 The 100 Hz subcarrier is transmitted at − 15 dBFS ( 18 % modulation ) beginning at 30 ms from the start of the second ( the first 30 ms are reserved for the seconds tick ) , and then reduced by 15 dB ( to − 30 dBFS , 3 % modulation ) at one of three times within the second . The duration of the high amplitude 100 Hz subcarrier encodes a data bit of 0 , a data bit of 1 , or a " marker " , as follows : 
 If the subcarrier is reduced 800 ms past the second , this indicates a " marker . " 
 If the subcarrier is reduced 500 ms past the second , this indicates a data bit with value one . 
 If the subcarrier is reduced 200 ms past the second , this indicates a data bit with value zero . 
 A single bit or marker is sent in this way in every second of each minute except the first ( second : 00 ) . The first second of each minute is reserved for the minute marker , previously described . 
 In the diagram above , the red and yellow bars indicate the presence of the 100 Hz subcarrier , with yellow representing the higher strength subcarrier ( − 15 dB referenced to 100 % modulation ) and red the lower strength subcarrier ( − 30 dB referenced to 100 % modulation ) . The widest yellow bars represent the markers , the narrowest represent data bits with value 0 , and those of intermediate width represent data bits with value 1 . 
 = = = = = Interpretation = = = = = 
 It takes one minute to transmit a complete time code . Most of the bits encode UTC time , day of year , year of century , and UT1 correction up to ± 0 @.@ 7 s . 
 Like the WWVB time code , only the tens and units digits of the year are transmitted ; unlike the WWVB time code , there is no direct indication for leap year . Thus , receivers assuming that year 00 is a leap year ( correct for year 2000 ) will be incorrect in the year 2100 . On the other hand , receivers that assume year 00 is not a leap year will be correct for 2001 through <unk> . 
 The table below shows the interpretation of each bit , with the " Ex " column being the values from the example above . 
 The example shown encodes day 86 ( March 27 ) of 2009 , at 21 : 30 : 00 UTC . <unk> is + 0 @.@ 3 , so UT1 is 21 : 30 : 00 @.@ 3 . Daylight Saving Time was not in effect at the previous 00 : 00 UTC ( DST1 = 0 ) , and will not be in effect at the next 00 : 00 UTC ( DST2 = 0 ) . There is no leap second scheduled ( <unk> = 0 ) . The day of year normally runs from 1 ( January 1 ) through 365 ( December 31 ) , but in leap years , December 31 would be day 366 , and day 86 would be March 26 instead of March 27 . 
 = = = = = Daylight saving time and leap seconds = = = = = 
 The time code contains three bits announcing daylight saving time ( DST ) changes and imminent leap seconds . 
 Bit : 03 is set near the beginning of the month which is scheduled to end in a leap second . It is cleared when the leap second occurs . 
 Bit : 55 ( DST2 ) is set at UTC midnight just before DST comes into effect . It is cleared at UTC midnight just before standard time resumes . 
 Bit : 02 ( DST1 ) is set at UTC midnight just after DST comes into effect , and cleared at UTC midnight just after standard time resumes . 
 If the DST1 and DST2 bits differ , DST is changing during the current UTC day , at the next 02 : 00 local time . Before the next 02 : 00 local time after that , the bits will be the same . Each change in the DST bits happens at 00 : 00 UTC and so will first be received in the mainland United States between 16 : 00 ( PST ) and 20 : 00 ( EDT ) , depending on local time zone and on whether DST is about to begin or end . A receiver in the Eastern time zone ( UTC − 5 ) must therefore correctly receive the " DST is changing " indication within the seven hours before DST begins , and six hours before DST ends , if it is to change the local time display at the correct time . Receivers in the Central , Mountain , and Pacific time zones have one , two , and three more hours of advance notice , respectively . 
 During a leap second , a binary zero is transmitted in the time code ; in this case , the minute will not be preceded by a marker . 
 = = = Levels of modulation = = = 
 The once @-@ per @-@ second " ticks " and minute and hour tones are modulated onto the carrier signal at 100 percent , or 0 dBc .

 Each transmitter is connected to a dedicated antenna , which has a height corresponding to approximately one @-@ half of its signal 's wavelength , and the signal radiation patterns from each antenna are omnidirectional .

 = Ba Cụt = 
 Lê Quang Vinh ( 1923 – 13 July 1956 ) , popularly known as Ba Cụt ( " Cụt " in Vietnamese is " severed " which refers to the finger he had partially severed and ' Ba ' , the number three in Vietnamese , refers to his being the family 's second born child ) was a military commander of the Hòa Hảo religious sect , which operated from the Mekong Delta and controlled various parts of southern Vietnam during the 1940s and early 1950s . 
 Ba Cụt and his forces fought the Vietnamese National Army ( VNA ) , the Việt Minh , and the Cao Đài religious movement from 1943 until his capture in 1956 . Known for his idiosyncrasies , he was regarded as an erratic and cruel leader who fought with little ideological purpose . His sobriquet came from the self @-@ amputation of his left index finger ( although it was erroneously reported that it was his middle or " third cut finger " ) . He later swore not to cut his hair until the communist Việt Minh were defeated . Ba Cụt frequently made alliances with various Vietnamese factions and the French . He invariably accepted the material support offered in return for his cooperation , and then broke the agreement — nevertheless , the French made deals with him on five occasions . The French position was weak because their military forces had been depleted by World War II , and they had great difficulty in re @-@ establishing control over French Indochina , which had been left with a power vacuum after the defeat of Japan . 
 In mid @-@ 1955 , the tide turned against the various sects , as Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm of the State of Vietnam and his VNA began to consolidate their grip on the south . Ba Cụt and his allies were driven into the jungle , and their position was threatened by government offensives . After almost a year of fighting , Ba Cụt was captured . He was sentenced to death and publicly beheaded in Cần Thơ . 
 = = Early life and background = = 
 Ba Cụt was born circa 1923 in Long Xuyên , a regional town in the Mekong Delta , in the far south of Vietnam . He was orphaned at an early age and adopted by a local peasant family . Ba Cụt was illiterate and was known from childhood as a temperamental and fiery person . The family 's rice paddies were confiscated by a prominent landlord , the father of Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ . Ba Cụt 's bitter personal experience imbued him with a permanent and fanatical hatred towards landowners . Thơ rose to become a leading politician in the 1950s and played a key role in Ba Cụt 's eventual capture and execution . An aura of mystery surrounded Ba Cụt during his life , and foreign journalists incorrectly reported that he had severed his finger as part of a vow to defeat the French . As Ba Cụt became more fanatical in his religious beliefs and spent increasing time with local religious men , Ba Cụt 's father demanded that he work more in the family 's rice fields . A defiant Ba Cụt severed his index finger , which was necessary for work in the rice paddies . 
 Vietnam was a tumultuous place during Ba Cụt 's youth , particularly in the Mekong Delta . In 1939 , Huỳnh Phú Sổ founded the Hòa Hảo religious movement , and within a year had gained more than 100 @,@ 000 followers . He drew adherents for two reasons : the prophecies he made about the outbreak of World War II and the conquest of South @-@ East Asia by Japan , which proved to be correct ; and his work as a mystical healer — his patients claimed to have been miraculously cured from all manner of serious illnesses after seeing him , when Western medicine had failed . Sổ 's cult @-@ like appeal greatly alarmed the French colonial authorities . During World War II , Imperial Japan invaded and seized control of Vietnam from France ; its defeat and withdrawal at the end of the war in 1945 left a power vacuum in the country . 
 The Hòa Hảo formed their own army and administration during the war , and started a de facto state in their Mekong Delta stronghold . They came into conflict with the Cao Đài , another new religious movement , which also boasted a private army and controlled a nearby region of southern Vietnam around Tây Ninh . Meanwhile , in Saigon , the Bình Xuyên organised crime syndicate ruled much of the city through its gangster militia . These three southern forces vied for control of southern Vietnam with the main protagonists : the French , who were attempting to re @-@ establish colonial control across the entire nation ; and the communist @-@ dominated Việt Minh , who sought Vietnamese independence . 
 At the time , the many groups vying for power — including their respective factions — engaged in alliances of convenience that were frequently broken . Historian David Elliott wrote : " [ T ] he most important eventual cause of the French decline was the inherently unstable nature of the political alliances they had devised ... [ T ] he history of the French relations with the Hoa Hao sect is a telling illustration of the pitfalls of short @-@ term political deals between forces whose long @-@ term interests conflict . " 
 The Hòa Hảo initially engaged in large @-@ scale clashes with the Việt Minh in 1945 , but by mid @-@ 1946 the two groups had agreed to stop fighting each other and fight the French instead . However , in June 1946 , Sổ became estranged from his military leaders and started the Dân <unk> ( Social Democratic Party ) . Because of his charisma , the Việt Minh saw Sổ as a threat and assassinated him , leaving the Hòa Hảo leaderless and causing Sổ 's military leaders to go their separate ways . The split caused an increase in violence as the various Hòa Hảo factions engaged in conflicts among themselves .

 Ba Cụt joined the Hòa Hảo militia when it was formed in 1943 – 44 , and became a commander within a year . He was feared by his enemies , and was described as " a sort of lean Rasputin " who claimed to be immortal . According to historian and writer Bernard Fall , " The hapless farmers who were under the rule of the maniacal Ba Cut fared worse [ than those under other military leaders ] , for the latter [ Ba Cụt ] was given to fits of incredible cruelty and had no sense of public duty . " American journalist Joseph Alsop described Ba Cụt as " war @-@ drunk " . Ba Cụt was famous for inventing a torture contraption that drilled a steel nail through the victim 's ear , a device he used to extort villagers and wealthy landlords to fund his forces . He was said to have " arranged temporary marriages between his troops and village girls " . He raised a large amount of funds for the Hòa Hảo and himself personally by charging traders and landlords high prices to stop pirates in the local area . The severed heads of the pirates were subsequently impaled on stakes and put on public display . 
 In 1947 , he led his own faction of the sect after its various military leaders pursued their own policies towards the French and Hồ Chí Minh 's Việt Minh in the wake of Sổ 's death . At the time , France was in a ruinous financial state following World War II and was experiencing great difficulty in its attempts to re @-@ establish control over its colonies . Ba Cụt had only 1 @,@ 000 men in five battalions at the time , fewer than 5 % of Hòa Hảo forces , whereas Trần Văn Soái had 15 @,@ 000 men . The French tried to maintain their hold with a divide and conquer strategy towards the Hòa Hảo . They coaxed Soái into joining with them and recognised him as the leader of the Hòa Hảo . In 1948 , Ba Cụt rallied to the French and Soái , but broke away again soon after , relocating to Đồng Tháp Province and resuming his military activities against the French . 
 In 1950 , Ba Cụt was involved in a battle with another Hòa Hảo leader , Nguyễn Giác <unk> . He was defeated and driven from the district of <unk> Mới in February , provoking Soái to attack Ngo . Ba Cụt then moved to Thốt Nốt and began attacking the civilians and the French forces there . The French saw the disagreements as an opportunity to divide the Hòa Hảo and gain an anti @-@ Việt Minh ally , and offered material aid , which Ba Cụt accepted . Ba Cụt repeatedly made treaties with the French colonial forces to fight the Việt Minh in return for arms and money , but he broke his end of the bargain and sometimes fought the Cao Đài instead of the communists . He made five such deals with the French , but he abandoned his military responsibilities each time . It was said that Ba Cụt sometimes broke away with the encouragement of Soái , who was still allied to the French , but nevertheless is believed to have given Ba Cụt weapons to fight the French . The French continued to furnish him with supplies despite his disloyalty and unreliability because they lacked the personnel to patrol all of Vietnam but had spare equipment . Some historians have claimed Ba Cụt 's anti @-@ French activities were not taken seriously as he was able to pass through French checkpoints without incident . There are also reports that he was accompanied by French intelligence agents during periods when he was nominally opposed to the French . The other Hòa Hảo commanders generally had the same general outlook as Ba Cụt ; they were stridently opposed to the Việt Minh due to Sổ 's assassination , and sometimes fought alongside and received supplies from the French , but at times they lapsed into apathy and refused to attack . 
 The most notable instance of Ba Cụt 's abandoning the fight against the Việt Minh came in mid @-@ 1953 . At that time , his forces had been helping to defend the regional Mekong Delta town of Mỹ Tho , but the French decided to transfer more of the military power to their more mainstream allies , the Vietnamese National Army ( VNA ) . As the French tried to undermine his position , tensions with Ba Cụt increased . On 25 June , the Hòa Hảo leader ordered his men to evacuate their French @-@ supplied bases ; they took their weapons with them and razed the camps . Ba Cụt then withdrew his forces from a string of military posts in the Plain of Reeds and retreated to Châu Đốc in the extreme south of the country . As a result , the French @-@ aligned presence in the Mekong Delta was severely dented and the Việt Minh made substantial gains in the area . Eventually , the French defeat at Điện Biên Phủ in May 1954 signaled the end of French Indochina . 
 When the Geneva Conference in July 1954 ended the First Indochina War , it handed North Vietnam to Hồ Chí Minh 's Việt Minh , and the south to the State of Vietnam . To reunify the country , national elections were scheduled for 1956 , following which the French would withdraw from Indochina . The partition of Vietnam angered Ba Cụt and he vowed not to cut his hair until the nation was reunified . Having fought against the Việt Minh since 1947 , Ba Cụt 's principal criticism of Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm 's State of Vietnam government stemmed from his belief that Diệm had been too passive in rejecting the partition , and that half of the country should not have been yielded to the communists . 
 In mid @-@ 1954 , General Nguyễn Văn Hinh , the head of the State of Vietnam 's VNA , announced that he did not respect the leadership of Prime Minister Diệm , and vowed to overthrow him . The coup never materialised and Hinh was forced into exile , but not before appointing Ba Cụt to the rank of colonel in the VNA in an attempt to undermine Diệm , as the Hòa Hảo warlord was openly contemptuous of the prime minister . In August , Ba Cụt and his 3 @,@ 000 men broke from the VNA and left their Thốt Nốt base for the jungle , and fought against those who had briefly been their comrades ; this put him at odds with most Hòa Hảo leaders , who accepted government payments to integrate their forces into the VNA . Operation <unk> , the initial military offensive by the VNA against Ba Cụt was a failure , possibly because the details of the planned attack on his forces were leaked to him by Soái , a Hòa Hảo member of the National Defence Committee . 
 During the transition period between the signing of the Geneva Accords and the planned reunification elections , South Vietnam remained in chaos as the VNA tried to subdue the remaining autonomous factions of the Hòa Hảo , Cao Đài , and Bình Xuyên militias . In early 1955 , during a battle with the Cao Đài forces of <unk> Minh Thế , after a dispute over control of the That Son region , Ba Cụt was wounded in a disputed incident . Thế claimed to have tried initiating peace talks with Ba Cụt , but received no reply , so he decided to try to capture his rival . He sent some of his militant disciples to infiltrate Ba Cụt 's forces and try to capture the Hòa Hảo leader . When they located Ba Cụt and surrounded him , he refused to surrender but instead tried to shoot his way out . Ba Cụt was severely wounded by a bullet that penetrated his chest . It seemed that he would die , but a French Air Force helicopter flew in and airlifted him to a colonial hospital . He recovered but in the interim the fighting stopped . Another account claims the two military leaders had been on good terms and exchanging diplomatic missions , but that the skirmish was caused by one of Ba Cụt 's aides addressing the envoy in an abrasive and rude manner , and that the injuries were minor . Yet another account holds that the reaction by Thế 's envoy was premeditated and that the claim the firing was in response to rudeness was merely a cover for an assassination attempt . According to this theory , Thế , whose units were then being integrated into Diệm 's VNA , had given orders to target Ba Cụt . This was allegedly done on the orders of CIA agent Edward Lansdale , who was trying to help secure Diệm in power at the time . Lansdale has been accused of failing in an earlier attempt to bribe Ba Cụt to cease his activities . 
 By this time , with France preparing to withdraw from Indochina , senior French officers had begun to undermine Diệm 's leadership and his attempts to stabilise South Vietnam . The VNA later implicated the French in the organisation of weapons air drops to Ba Cụt , prompting a protest from Diệm 's government . Diệm complained to a French general , alleging that Ba Cụt 's men were using French equipment that was of higher quality than that given to the VNA . The Hòa Hảo accused Diệm of treachery in his negotiations with various groups . They charged the prime minister with integrating Thế 's forces into the VNA in return for them being allowed to attack Ba Cụt with the aid of the VNA , and that this part of the deal had been kept secret . They warned that other Hòa Hảo leaders who had stopped fighting could join Ba Cụt , and appealed to Diệm 's U.S. sponsors . In response , Ba Cụt ambushed a VNA unit in Long Mỹ , killing three officers and injuring some thirty men . 
 = = Last stand against Diệm = = 
 In 1955 , Diệm tried to integrate the remaining Hòa Hảo armies into the VNA . Ba Cụt was one of four Hòa Hảo military leaders who refused the government offer on 23 April , and continued to operate autonomously . At one stage , the Cao Đài , Hòa Hảo and Bình Xuyên formed an alliance called the United Front , in an attempt to pressure Diệm into handing over power ; Ba Cụt was named senior military commander . However , this had little meaning as the various units were still autonomous of each other , and the United Front was more a showpiece than a means of facilitating coordinated action , and did not in any way strengthen any military threat to Diệm . The leaders were suspicious of one another and often sent subordinates to meetings . Initially , American and French representatives in Vietnam hoped that Diệm would take up a ceremonial role and allow the sect leaders — including Ba Cụt — to hold government positions . However , Diệm refused to share power and launched a sudden offensive against Ba Cụt in Thốt Nốt on 12 March , shelling the area heavily . The battle was inconclusive and both sides blamed the other for causing instability and disrupting the situation . Diệm then attacked the Bình Xuyên 's Saigon headquarters in late April , quickly crushing them . 
 During the fighting , the Hòa Hảo attempted to help the Bình Xuyên by attacking towns and government forces in their Mekong Delta heartland . Ba Cụt 's men , who had also been angered by the recent arrest of some colleagues , blockaded the Mekong and Bassac rivers and laid siege to various towns , including Sa <unk> , Long Xuyên and Châu Đốc , stifling the regional economy . The Hòa Hảo shut down several important regional roads and stopped the flow of agricultural produce from the nation 's most fertile region into the capital , causing food prices to rise by 50 % , as meat and vegetables became scarce . Ba Cụt then attacked a battalion of VNA troops south of Sa <unk> . Soon after , they retreated to a Hòa Hảo citadel on the banks of the Bassac . After reinforcing their base , the Hòa Hảo proceeded to fire mortars across the water into the city of Cần Thơ , which stood on the opposite side of the river . During this period , the United Front publicly accused Diệm of trying to bribe Ba Cụt with 100 million piasters . 
 With the Bình Xuyên vanquished , Diệm turned his attention to conquering the Hòa Hảo . As a result , a battle between government troops led by General Dương Văn Minh and Ba Cụt 's men commenced in Cần Thơ on 5 June . Five Hòa Hảo battalions surrendered immediately ; Ba Cụt and three remaining leaders had fled to the Cambodian border by the end of the month . The soldiers of the three other leaders eventually surrendered , but Ba Cụt 's men continued to the end , claiming loyalty to the Emperor Bảo Đại . Diệm responded by replacing the officers of Bảo Đại 's personal regiments with his own men and used the royal units to attack Ba Cụt 's rebels near Hà Tiên and <unk> <unk> , outnumbering the Hòa Hảo by at least a factor of five . Knowing that they could not defeat the government in open conventional warfare , Ba Cụt 's forces destroyed their own bases so that the VNA could not use their abandoned resources , and retreated into the jungle . Ba Cụt 's 3 @,@ 000 men spent the rest of 1955 evading 20 @,@ 000 VNA troops who had been deployed to quell them . A bounty of one million piasters was put on the head of Ba Cụt , who scattered trails of money in the jungle , hoping to distract his pursuers , but to no avail . The communists claimed in a history written decades later that Ba Cụt had tried to forge an alliance with them , but that talks broke down a few months later . 
 Despite his weak military situation , Ba Cụt sought to disrupt the staging of a fraudulent referendum that Diệm had scheduled to depose Bảo Đại as head of state . Ba Cụt distributed a pamphlet condemning Diệm as an American puppet , asserting that the prime minister was going to " Catholicize " the country ; the referendum was partly funded by the U.S. government and various Roman Catholic organisations . Diệm had strong support from American Roman Catholic politicians and the powerful Cardinal Francis Spellman and his elder brother , Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục , was Archbishop of Huế . Ba Cụt presciently noted that the referendum was a means " for Diem to gather the people from all towns and force them to demonstrate one goal : to depose Bao Dai and proclaim the puppet Diem as the chief @-@ of @-@ state of Vietnam . " On the day of the poll , Ba Cụt 's men prevented voting in the border regions which they controlled , and ventured out of the jungles to attack polling stations in Cần Thơ . Despite that disruption , Diệm was fraudulently credited with more than 90 % of support in Hòa Hảo @-@ controlled territory , and a near unanimous turnout was recorded in the area . These results were replicated across the nation , and Diệm deposed Bảo Đại . 
 Eventually , Ba Cụt was surrounded , and sought to make a peace deal with the Diệm government to avoid being taken prisoner . Ba Cụt sent a message to Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ , the public official who oversaw the civilian side of the campaign against the Hòa Hảo , asking for negotiations so that his men could be integrated into mainstream society and the nation 's armed forces . Thơ agreed to meet Ba Cụt alone in the jungle , and despite fears that the meeting was a Hòa Hảo trap , he was not ambushed . However , Ba Cụt began asking for additional concessions and the meeting ended in a stalemate . According to historian Hue @-@ Tam Ho Tai , Ba Cụt 's lifelong antipathy towards Thơ 's family influenced his behaviour during his last stand . Ba Cụt was arrested by a patrol on 13 April 1956 , and his remaining forces were defeated in battle . 
 = = Trial and execution = = 
 Diệm 's government put Ba Cụt on trial . During the proceedings , Ba Cụt theatrically removed his shirt so that the public gallery could see how many scars he had suffered while fighting the communists . This , according to him , demonstrated his devotion to Vietnamese nationalism . He challenged any other man to show as many scars . However , the Diệmist judge was unimpressed . Ba Cụt was found guilty of multiple murders and sentenced to death . Diệm 's adviser , Colonel Edward Lansdale from the CIA , was one of many who protested against the decision . Lansdale felt that the execution would tarnish Diệm — who had proclaimed the Republic of Vietnam ( commonly known as South Vietnam ) and declared himself President — and antagonise Ba Cụt 's followers . Ngô Đình Nhu , Diệm 's younger brother and chief adviser , denied a reprieve as the army , particularly Minh , opposed any clemency . Some sections of the southern public , however , were sympathetic to Ba Cụt . 
 Ba Cụt was publicly guillotined on 13 July 1956 , in Cần Thơ . His body was later diced into small pieces , which were then buried separately . Some followers , led by a deputy named <unk> <unk> , retreated to a small area beside the Cambodian border , where they vowed not to rest until Ba Cụt was avenged . Many of his followers later joined the Việt Cộng — the movement that succeeded the Việt Minh their leader had fought — and took up arms against Diệm . 
 = Shore Line East = 
 Shore Line East ( SLE ) is a commuter rail service which operates along the Northeast Corridor through southern Connecticut , US . A fully owned subsidiary of the Connecticut Department of Transportation ( ConnDOT ) , SLE provides service seven days a week along the Northeast Corridor from New London west to New Haven , with limited through service to Bridgeport and Stamford . Connecting service west of New Haven to New York City is available via Metro @-@ North Railroad 's New Haven Line . 
 The service was introduced in 1990 as a temporary measure to reduce congestion during construction work on I @-@ 95 . However , it proved more popular than expected , and service was continued after construction ended despite criticisms that the line was too expensive to operate . The service has been continually upgraded since its inception with rebuilt stations and new rolling stock as well as extensions to New London in 1996 and to Stamford in 2001 . Around 1 @,@ 900 to 2 @,@ 100 riders use the service every weekday depending on the season . 
 = = Current service = = 
 Most weekday SLE trains run local westbound from New London or Old Saybrook to New Haven in the morning , with some nonstop eastbound service . This traffic pattern is reversed in the afternoon and evening rush . A handful operate through New Haven as far as Stamford . 
 Most weekend SLE trains also run local westbound in the morning , then express in the afternoon , stopping only at Guilford and Westbrook between Old Saybrook and State Street . Eastbound service is reversed . This is because Branford , Madison , and Clinton only have platforms on the eastbound track , and thus switching is needed to platform a westbound train . 
 Around half of SLE trains operate to and from New London Station . New London SLE multi @-@ ride pass holders are also allowed to board selected Northeast Regional trains , or Acela Express train # <unk> . There are plans to increase the service to New London , which is limited by U.S. Coast Guard requirements regarding the bridge crossing the Connecticut River . After years with just one or two trains to New London , additional New London round trips were added in 2010 and 2013 , and weekend service began in June 2013 . 
 All trains that do not operate west of New Haven make a connection to a Metro @-@ North Railroad train at New Haven , for service to and from points in Connecticut , Westchester County , New York , and New York City . 
 Although SLE service is funded by ConnDOT , it is operated under contract by Amtrak . Amtrak owns and controls the Northeast Corridor east of New Haven . West of New Haven , the New Haven Line is owned by ConnDOT and trains are dispatched by Metro @-@ North . 
 During the OpSail and <unk> tall ship festivals at New London , extra Friday and weekend Shore Line East service is operated from New Haven to New London . During OpSail 2000 , through service operated from New Haven to Mystic – the only time Shore Line East service has run east of New London .

 = = = Previous service = = = 
 The section of the Northeast Corridor that Shore Line East operates on was once the New York @-@ Boston mainline of the New York , New Haven and Hartford Railroad . The section from New Haven to New London was built as the New Haven & New London Railroad . It was charted in 1848 , began construction in 1850 , and opened for service in July 1852 . The line was owned by the New York , Providence and Boston Railroad ( the " Stonington Road " ) from 1858 to 1862 , and by the Shore Line Railway from 1864 until it was acquired by the New York , New Haven , and Hartford Railroad ( the " New Haven " ) in 1870 . Crossing the Connecticut River required a ferry transfer until a drawbridge was built in 1870 . 
 The line was referred to by the New Haven Railroad as the Shore Line , to distinguish it from the railroad 's Main Line from New Haven to Springfield , Massachusetts . In recognition of the large role played by the New Haven in the history and heritage of the state of Connecticut , ConnDOT paints SLE 's diesel @-@ powered locomotives in the New Haven 's orange and black style . New Haven Railroad colors and emblems have also been placed at several stations , particularly New Haven Union Station . 
 The New Haven Railroad operated local service on the Shore Line up until its merger with Penn Central on January 1 , 1969 , when most commuter service east of New Haven was abandoned . Intercity service continued , but generally only stopped at New Haven , Old Saybrook , and New London . Penn Central continued to operate the Clamdigger , a single daily New London @-@ New Haven round trip with local stops , as well as a New London @-@ Boston round trip . Amtrak took over the Clamdigger along with most intercity passenger service , in May 1971 . In January 1972 , Amtrak discontinued the Clamdigger and Penn Central cut the New London @-@ Boston trip . 
 In 1976 and 1977 , Amtrak operated the Clamdigger as a Providence @-@ New Haven round trip with limited local stops ; for three months in 1978 , it was revived with additional commuter @-@ based stops . It was replaced in April 1978 by the Beacon Hill , which stopped at New Haven , Branford , Madison , Old Saybrook , Niantic , New London , and Mystic en route to Providence and Boston . The Beacon Hill ( which served the Providence and Boston commuting markets rather than New Haven ) was discontinued in 1981 due to funding cuts , ending commuter rail service in Connecticut east of New Haven . 
 = = = Initial service = = = 
 In 1981 and 1986 , legislation was proposed to restore commuter service between New Haven and New London , as well as between New Haven and Hartford . A 1986 ConnDOT study analyzed congestion on Interstate 95 , which runs parallel to the line . The study showed that Old Saybrook was a better terminus for initial service , with an expected ridership of 420 riders in each direction daily . 
 Based on the study , Governor O 'Neill ordered ConnDOT in October 1986 to initiate rail service on the corridor . It was established as a temporary service to newly reopened local stations between Union Station in New Haven and Old Saybrook , to alleviate traffic congestion that arose from scheduled construction work on I @-@ 95 . O 'Neill introduced a $ 50 million transportation program that included $ 900 @,@ 000 ( later reduced to $ 500 @,@ 000 ) for basic stations and $ 4 million to refurbish 12 Budd Rail Diesel Cars for rolling stock . The <unk> were found to be insufficient and two diesel trainsets were purchased from the defunct <unk> service in 1989 instead . 
 A second study in 1989 indicated higher potential ridership of 700 to 1350 daily riders . The state bought Amtrak 's New Haven maintenance facility in May 1989 and signed a service contract with Amtrak in November . ( Metro @-@ North Railroad was not considered for several reasons , largely because Amtrak already owned the rail line east of New Haven ) . Construction of 5 intermediate stations was completed in April 1990 . 
 Shore Line East service began on May 29 , 1990 , with four trains each direction during the morning and evening . The service carried the Clamdigger name during planning ; " Shore Line East " did not appear until shortly before service began . Shore Line East was threatened to be cut in 1991 by newly elected Governor Lowell Weicker , but it proved more popular than expected , and was effectively made permanent . A 1996 study found that Shore Line East captured 8 % of regional commuter trips and attracted a loyal ridership base . 
 In 1995 and 1997 , then Gov. John Rowland proposed to replace Shore Line East and the Waterbury Branch with bus service , citing a high subsidy of $ 18 @.@ 70 per rider per trip , in order to decrease the unpopular gas tax . Lawmakers from the region called the proposals political and defended the line 's ability to reduce congestion and pollution , while opponents of the line called it an example of government waste . The Shore Line East Rider 's Association and other groups lobbied to save both services each time , and after public hearings a small fare increase was enacted in late 1997 instead . 
 = = = Early expansions and criticisms = = = 
 In July 1995 , Governor Rowland signed a bill ordering various studies , including one that analyzed extending service to New London as had been originally planned . Before the study was completed , ConnDOT unilaterally decided to implement New London service , which the report commended . On February 1 , 1996 , two round trips per weekday were extended to New London . At that point , ridership was up 18 % over 1991 numbers . 
 In January 2001 , because of to changes in Amtrak rules , passengers were no longer allowed to cross tracks to access trains . New platforms were opened on the south side of the tracks at Branford and Westbrook at approximately the same locations . 
 In December 2001 , a single morning rush @-@ hour round trip branded <unk> was extended to Stamford , with a stop at Bridgeport plus eastbound @-@ only stops at Stratford and Milford . An evening eastbound trip was also extended to Stamford with only the Bridgeport intermediate stop . This trip was intended to allow commuters to reach employment centers in Bridgeport and Stamford without having to make a transfer at New Haven . On June 24 , 2002 , additional Stamford trains were added , for a total of two westbound and three eastbound trains . When West Haven opened in August 2013 , it was added to these trips as well . 
 In 2003 , in order to add four additional Amtrak trips along the corridor , four of the then six round trips to New London were cut back to Old Saybrook . An agreement with the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection limits service over the Old Saybrook @-@ Old Lyme bridge in order to avoid inconveniencing recreational boaters . ConnDOT 's agreement with Amtrak allowed commuters with monthly passes to ride certain Amtrak trains instead . After criticism over the service cuts , in April 2008 ConnDOT began allowing commuters with multi @-@ ride passes to board the selected Amtrak trains as well . 
 = = = Improved and increased service = = = 
 When started in 1990 , Shore Line East was intended to be a temporary service . Except at Old Saybrook and New Haven , which were already served by Amtrak , the state constructed new stations – consisting of little more than bare wooden decks – for minimal cost . Since the service was started two months before the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed , the platforms were not built to be handicapped accessible . After a decade of service , with Shore Line East established as part of Connecticut 's transportation system , the state began to upgrade the service . The basic stations have been rebuilt with high @-@ level platforms to provide handicapped access and level boarding , parking lots have been expanded , and more trains have been added to the schedule . 
 A completely new station was also added to the line for traffic mitigation as part of the reconstruction of the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge . On June 7 , 2002 , State Street Station was opened in New Haven to provide better access to the downtown area than Union Station , which is half a mile away from the business district . 
 The first station to be rebuilt was Old Saybrook , the busy eastern terminus of the line . The new high @-@ level island platform and pedestrian bridge opened on November 1 , 2002 . Old Saybrook had previous had only a single side platform serving a relatively small number of Amtrak trains ; the rebuilt has two platforms serving three tracks , to allow Amtrak trains in both directions to stop or pass even while a SLE train is at the station . 
 Beginning on May 24 , 2004 , construction of new platforms began at Clinton , Guilford , and Branford . The rebuilt Clinton station opened on July 25 , 2005 , and the rebuilt Branford station opened on August 8 , 2005 ; both consist of a single high @-@ level platform on the south side of the tracks . The new Guilford station , which has platforms on both sides of the tracks ( connected by a pedestrian bridge ) to allow for greater operational flexibility , opened on November 28 , 2005 . Construction at Madison started on September 24 , 2007 , and finished with the opening of the rebuilt station platform on July 28 , 2008 . 
 On October 8 , 2007 , reverse @-@ peak and more midday service were introduced , which officials hailed as the beginning of Shore Line East as a true bidirectional system . Several existing express trains also began to stop at Guilford . Since at least 2006 , advocates had been calling for the establishment of weekend Shore Line East service . A pilot of weekend service was run from November 17 , 2007 , to December 30 , 2007 , with six " Shopper 's Special " round trips from Old Saybrook to New Haven . The trains were scheduled to connect with similar Metro @-@ North specials at New Haven . Year @-@ round weekend service began on July 4 , 2008 , with 9 daily Old Saybrook – New Haven round trips on weekends . No weekend service was run to New London , but weekday service was increased as cross @-@ honoring of multiple @-@ ride and monthly tickets was added on two Amtrak trains . 
 The major obstacle preventing full New London service is the bridge over the Connecticut River between Old Saybrook and Old Lyme . The drawbridge section is closed for a certain period of time to allow trains to pass , which prevents large boats from passing under . The Marine Trades Association opposes additional service , which would mandate more bridge closings . The 2003 agreement with Amtrak limited weekday traffic over the bridge to 2 SLE and 39 Amtrak trains until 2018 , although it was revised in 2010 and 2013 . Since 2003 , New London had been served by cross @-@ honored Amtrak trains plus one or two dedicated SLE roundtrips . 
 On February 16 , 2010 , an additional round trip was extended to New London . Three more were extended on May 10 , 2010 . However , advocates for full service to New London said that Governor Rell failed to deliver on promises to New London , with one newspaper columnist writing that " she seems incapable of standing up to the marine trades lobby " regarding the bridge openings . 
 In July 2012 , Governor Malloy announced that 5 weekend round trips would be extended to New London beginning in April 2013 . However , the extension was dependent on ongoing negotiations with the marine industry over mandated closings of the Old Saybrook – Old Lyme bridge . Two weekday midday trips were added in May 2013 , while weekend service began on June 1 , 2013 , after the application for additional bridge closings was approved by the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection . By July , New London represented 26 % of weekend ridership . In December 2013 , the state announced that ridership was up 35 % for the year as a result of the increased service . From 2009 to 2014 , monthly New London ridership increased from less than 1 @,@ 000 monthly passengers to approximately 5 @,@ 000 , accounting for a significant fraction of ridership increases on Shore Line East during that period . 
 Four of the five intermediate stations between Old Saybrook and New Haven were rebuilt with accessible platforms between 2004 and 2008 , but rebuilding at Westbrook was delayed due to environmental and cost issues . No site was available until Westbrook and ConnDOT traded the new station site on Norris Avenue for a highway garage site off Route 145 . The controversial land swap was begun in 2004 but was not finalized until 2006 , and town operations were not moved to the Route 145 site until September 2011 . Site clearing began in November 2011 , and ground was broken for the $ 14 @.@ 4 million station in January 2012 . A new station with a larger 210 @-@ space lot and platforms on both tracks opened on March 25 , 2014 , with full bidirectional service to the station beginning on May 11 .

 In a 2007 report , ConnDOT outlined plans to turn SLE into a full @-@ service bidirectional regional rail line , with full @-@ day service and all trains extended to New London . This involves incremental improvements , similar to those that have already been put into place . One of the first priorities is to add a second platform at all stations , which is mandated by the 2003 agreement with Amtrak . New London , Old Saybrook , Guilford , Westbrook , and stops from New Haven Union Station west all have multiple platforms , while State Street has an island platform serving two tracks with plans for a second platform . 
 Branford is the first previously rebuilt station to be further renovated with a second platform . A $ 60 million bond in February 2011 included $ 16 @.@ 5 million for a second platform and pedestrian bridge at Branford , $ 7 @.@ 3 million for platform extensions at Guilford , and $ 11 million to add catenary wires to currently <unk> sidings along the line . Construction on the new platform at Branford began in September 2013 , and the Guilford work is under way as well . As of September 2015 , the new platform and pedestrian bridge at Branford were officially scheduled to open on December 18 , 2015 , but have been delayed into 2016 as a result of the previous harsh winter and other issues . Bidding on a second platform and three @-@ level parking garage at Madison , planned since 2009 , was scheduled to begin in 2013 but did not occur . Per the agreement with Amtrak , a second platform is planned to be added to Clinton station . The project was originally planned to start in early 2012 , but has since been indefinitely delayed . 
 Expansion of the original parking facilities is also necessary to meet demand at many stations , since many started with small lots suitable for just a few dozen cars . The rebuilt stations at Branford , Guilford , Madison , Clinton , and Westbrook have larger lots than the 1990 stations , and a second lot with 272 spaces opened at Branford in June 2011 . A 585 @-@ space , three @-@ level parking garage is eventually planned for Madison station . 
 Although the route east of New Haven is electrified under Amtrak 's 60 Hz traction power system , Shore Line East currently operates entirely with diesel locomotives . Once the full order of M8 railcars are in service , and Amtrak tests and approves the <unk> for usage east of New Haven , ConnDOT plans to use 24 to 32 cars for electric SLE service to reduce diesel emissions . The diesel trainsets will be moved to service on the Danbury or Waterbury branches , or to the planned Hartford Line from New Haven to Springfield . 
 In April 2012 , state officials released a report detailing possible sites for an infill station in East Lyme . Four sites were analyzed – two near downtown Niantic and two at Rocky Neck State Park . Niantic had previously been a stop on the Clamdigger . As part of a bonding proposal made by Governor Malloy , $ 750 @,@ 000 would be allocated for a new station at Niantic . 
 The possibility of extending service eastward has also been considered . Several special trains operated to Mystic during the 2000 OpSail festival , the only such service to date . In a 2001 report examining commuter rail for Rhode Island , RIDOT considered an extension of Shore Line East to Providence via Westerly ( effectively restoring the Clamdigger service ) . Ultimately , MBTA Commuter Rail service , which already ran to Providence as part of the Providence / Stoughton Line , was extended southward instead ( although only to Wickford Junction ) . However , both RIDOT and SLE have long @-@ term plans to extend their services to meet at Westerly . Extending SLE service would require negotiations with the US Coast Guard , the Marine Trades Association , and other stakeholders for increased use of the Thames River Bridge and the Mystic River bridge . As part of Governor Malloy 's thirty year transit plan , Shore Line East would be extended to Westerly at a cost of $ 200 million . On February 1 , 2016 , the Connecticut Public Transportation Commission issued a report recommending extension of Shore Line East rail service to Mystic and Westerly as soon as possible .

 In contrast to the electric multiple units used on Metro @-@ North 's New Haven Line , which are also purchased in part by the state of Connecticut , all SLE trains are diesel push @-@ pull trains . 
 SLE runs diesel service because Amtrak had not yet electrified the Northeast Corridor between New Haven and Boston at the time service began . The original SLE service operated with 2 F @-@ 7s and 10 Pullman @-@ Standard coaches purchased from Pittsburgh 's <unk> for $ 1 @.@ 7 million . 
 In 1991 , ConnDOT purchased 10 Bombardier <unk> III coaches , similar to ones already used on the Danbury Branch and Waterbury Branch , and leased three additional diesel locomotives : two EMD <unk> and one EMD <unk> . In 1994 Amtrak rebuilt 11 of ConnDOT 's surplus SPV @-@ 2000 diesel railcars into coaches , dubbed " Constitution Liners . " In 1996 , SLE took delivery of six <unk> <unk> @-@ 2H diesels to replace the entire motive power fleet . These were supplemented in 2005 with 8 GE <unk> Genesis diesels leased from Amtrak . ConnDOT purchased the <unk> in 2008 . To augment capacity ConnDOT acquired 33 <unk> coaches from the Virginia Railway Express in 2004 . These began entering service in 2006 , displacing the <unk> and Constitution Liners . 
 ConnDOT plans call for the Kawasaki M8 to replace most or all of the locomotives and coaches currently in service on Shore Line East in 2018 . ConnDOT has proposed to use up to 32 M8 's in SLE service as far as Old Saybrook ; the diesel equipment will then be used on the Hartford Line and for New London service . Limited direct service from Grand Central Terminal to Old Saybrook may be added once the <unk> are in service . 
 ConnDOT acquired an additional four GE <unk> locomotives from New Jersey Transit in 2015 . Originally built for Amtrak , NJ Transit employed the locomotives on the short @-@ lived Atlantic City Express Service .

 = National Football League Players Association = 
 The National Football League Players Association , or NFLPA , is the labor organization representing the professional American football players in the National Football League ( NFL ) . The NFLPA , which has headquarters in Washington , D.C. , is led by president Eric Winston and executive director DeMaurice Smith . Founded in 1956 , the NFLPA was established to provide players with formal representation to negotiate compensation and the terms of a collective bargaining agreement ( CBA ) . The NFLPA is a member of the AFL – CIO , the largest federation of unions in the United States . 
 In the early years of the NFL , contractual negotiations took place between individual players and management ; team owners were reluctant to engage in collective bargaining . A series of strikes and lockouts have occurred throughout the union 's existence largely due to monetary and benefit disputes between the players and the owners . League rules that punished players for playing in rival football leagues resulted in litigation ; the success of such lawsuits impelled the NFL to negotiate some work rules and minimum payments with the NFLPA . However , the organization was not recognized by the NFL as the official bargaining agent for the players until 1968 , when a CBA was signed . The most recent CBA negotiations took place in 2011 . 
 In addition to conducting labor negotiations , the NFLPA represents and protects the rights of the players ; the organization 's actions include filing grievances against player discipline that it deems too severe . The union also ensures that the terms of the collective bargaining agreement are adhered to by the league and the teams . It negotiates and monitors retirement and insurance benefits and enhances and defends the image of players and their profession . 
 = = Early history = = 
 The establishment of the National Football League in 1920 featured early franchises haphazardly formed and often saddled with financial difficulties , poor player talent and attendance rates . As the league expanded through the years , players were provided with no formal representation and received few , if any , benefits . In 1943 , Roy Zimmerman 's refusal to play an exhibition game without compensation resulted in his trade from the Washington Redskins to the Philadelphia Eagles . With the formation of the competing All @-@ America Football Conference ( AAFC ) in 1946 , NFL owners instituted a rule which banned a player for five years from NFL @-@ associated employment if he left the league to join the AAFC . 
 Bill Radovich , an offensive lineman , was one player who " jumped " leagues ; he played for the Detroit Lions in 1945 and then joined the Los Angeles Dons of the AAFC after the team offered him a greater salary . Subsequently , Radovich was blacklisted by the NFL and was denied a tryout with the NFL @-@ affiliated San Francisco Seals baseball team of the Pacific Coast League . Unable to attain a job in either league , Radovich filed a lawsuit against the NFL in 1957 . In 1964 , Green Bay Packers Pro Bowl and All @-@ Pro center Jim Ringo approached head coach Vince Lombardi to negotiate a raise . Lombardi was angered by the presence of Ringo 's agent , and excused himself ; five minutes later he returned to inform the two that Ringo had been traded to the Philadelphia Eagles . The players grew tired of incidents such as these and complained to one another . One sore point was playing in training camp and preseason exhibition games without pay ; no contract payment was made until a player made a regular season roster . 
 The NFLPA began when two players from the Cleveland Browns , Abe Gibron and Dante Lavelli , approached a lawyer and former Notre Dame football player , Creighton Miller , to help form an association to advocate for the players . Miller was initially reluctant but accepted in 1956 . He contacted Don Shula ( a Baltimore Colts player at the time ) , John Gordy of the Detroit Lions , Frank Gifford and Sam Huff of the New York Giants , and Norm Van Brocklin of the Los Angeles Rams to aid in the development of the association . Representatives of 11 of the 12 teams in the league at the time joined the association ; the Chicago Bears were the sole dissenter ; by November 1956 a majority of the players signed cards allowing the NFLPA to represent them . The first meeting took place at the Waldorf @-@ Astoria Hotel in November where players decided on demands to be submitted to league commissioner Bert Bell . The new association 's initial agenda included a league @-@ wide minimum salary , plus a per diem when teams were on the road , that uniforms and equipment be paid for and maintained at the clubs ' expense , and continued payment of salaries when players were injured . The NFLPA hoped to meet with Bell during the owners ' meeting in January 1957 to discuss the demands ; however , no meeting took place . The owners , for their part , were not enthused by the concept of a player 's union and this sentiment was reflected when Miller , who served as an assistant coach with the Cleveland Browns , was removed from the team photo at the request of Paul Brown . Gibron , Lavelli , and Miller were instrumental in the founding of the union as they had become chagrined by Paul Brown 's staunch view that " it was both just and necessary that management could cut , trade , bench , blackball and own in perpetuity anyone and everyone that it wanted " . 
 Miller continued to represent the NFLPA in their early days . Unable to win the owners ' attention by forming the union , the NFLPA threatened to bring an antitrust lawsuit against the league . The antitrust laws are meant to protect " free and fair competition in the marketplace " and prohibit practices that may give industries or businesses an unfair advantage over their competitors . That threat became much more credible when the United States Supreme Court ruled in Radovich v. National Football League , 352 U.S. 445 ( 1957 ) , that the NFL did not enjoy the same antitrust immunity that Major League Baseball did , meaning that players like Radovich had been wrongfully barred from finding new employment . Jarett Bell of USA Today noted in 2011 , the Radovich ruling " set the foundation for a series of court battles that have continued to present times " largely over disagreements in compensation . Rather than face another lawsuit , the owners agreed to a league minimum salary of $ 5 @,@ 000 , $ 50 for each exhibition game played , and medical and hospital coverage . Although most of the NFLPA 's requests were met , the owners did not enter into a collective bargaining agreement with the association or formally recognize it as the players ' exclusive bargaining representative , instead agreeing to change the standard player contract and alter governing documents to reflect the deal . 
 From the inception of the NFLPA , its members were divided over whether it should act as a professional association or a union . Against the wishes of NFLPA presidents Pete <unk> and Bernie Parrish , Miller ran the association as a " ' grievance committee ' " rather than engaging in collective bargaining . The standard collective bargaining agreement ( CBA ) is a contract between organized workers and management that determines the wages and hours worked by employees and can also determine the scope of one 's work and what benefits employees receive . The association continued to use the threat of antitrust litigation over the next few years as a lever to gain better benefits , including a pension plan and health insurance . In the 1960s the NFL also faced competition from the new American Football League ( AFL ) . NFL players viewed the new league as potential leverage for them to improve their contracts . The NFL tried to discourage this idea by changing the owner @-@ controlled pension plan to add a provision saying that a player would lose his pension if he went to another league . 
 On January 14 , 1964 , players in the newer league formed the AFL Players Association , and elected linebacker Tom Addison of the Boston Patriots as president . Rather than working with the AFLPA , the NFLPA chose to remain apart and tried to block the merger between the two leagues in 1966 , though lack of funding prevented it from mounting a formal challenge . With the merger complete , the players could no longer use the leverage of being able to sign with an AFL team to attain more money . 
 Parrish , upset with the ineffectiveness of the association , proposed forming a players ' union , that would be independent of the NFLPA , with the assistance of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters ( <unk> ) . The <unk> pushed for the NFLPA to join the trucking union . In early November 1967 , Parrish , with support from former Cleveland Browns player Jim Brown , began distributing union cards to form a Teamsters affiliate known as the American Federation of Pro Athletes . The NFLPA rejected the overture at its meeting in Hollywood , Florida , during the first week of January 1968 and declared itself an independent union . Although Parrish 's proposal was defeated , Miller left his position as counsel to the union . He was later replaced by two Chicago labor lawyers , Dan Schulman and Bernie Baum . 
 = = Recognition and certification ( 1968 – 1983 ) = = 
 Six months after the NFLPA declared itself an independent union , many players were dissatisfied with the lack of compensation teams provided and voted to strike on July 3 , 1968 after official discussions with the owners stalled . The owners countered by declaring a lockout . By July 14 , 1968 , the brief work stoppage came to an end . Although a CBA resulted , many players felt that the agreement did not net them as many benefits as they had hoped . The owners agreed to contribute about $ 1 @.@ 5 million to the pension fund with minimum salaries of $ 9 @,@ 000 for rookies , $ 10 @,@ 000 for veterans and $ 50 per exhibition game ; there was at yet no neutral arbitration for disputes . 
 As the merger of the AFL and NFL became effective in 1970 , the unions agreed to meet for the first time in January of that year . The NFL players wanted Ed Meador — who was the president @-@ elect of the NFLPA prior to the merger — to become president of the newly combined association while the AFL players wanted Jack Kemp . The compromise was John Mackey of the Baltimore Colts , an NFL team before the merger , which was grouped with former AFL teams in the American Football Conference . The AFL players agreed to Mackey 's election on the condition that former AFL player Alan Miller would become general counsel . Though the NFL owners were open to recognizing the union , their representatives requested lawyers not be present during negotiations , something the players were unwilling to agree to . This prompted the players to petition the National Labor Relations Board ( NLRB ) for union certification . 
 The players went on strike in July 1970 after the owners locked them out for a brief period . The strike lasted for two days ending with a new four year CBA which was reached after the owners threatened to cancel the season . Due to the new agreement , the union won the right for players to bargain through their own agents with the clubs , and minimum salaries were increased to $ 12 @,@ 500 for rookies and $ 13 @,@ 000 for veterans . Also , players ' pensions were improved and dental care was added to the players ' insurance plans . Players also gained the right to select representation on the league 's retirement board and the right to impartial arbitration for injury grievances . Following the 1970 agreement , many union representatives were released by their teams . Unfazed , the players were determined to create a stronger union through better communication . Attorney Ed Garvey was hired by the NFLPA in 1971 to act as their first executive director , and the NFLPA became officially certified as a union by the NLRB the same year . Headquarters were established in Washington , D.C. and a campaign was launched to help inform players of their rights . 
 = = = 1974 strike = = = 
 The NFLPA challenged the so @-@ called " Rozelle Rule " as a violation of federal antitrust laws in a lawsuit filed by president John Mackey and allied union leaders in 1971 . The rule , named after commissioner Pete Rozelle , allowed the commissioner to award compensation , which included players , to a team losing a free agent if both the signing team and the team the player was departing could not come to an agreement on compensation . This rule limited player movement , as few teams were willing to sign high @-@ profile free agents only to risk having their rosters raided . With the 1970 CBA agreement set to expire , the players went on strike on July 1 , 1974 . In addition to the " Rozelle Rule " , the players demanded the elimination of the option clause , impartial arbitration of disputes , elimination of the draft and waiver system and individual , rather than uniform contracts . 
 The strike lasted until August 10 , 1974 when the players returned to training camp without a new CBA , instead choosing to pursue free agency through the Mackey lawsuit filed three years before . While the courts ruled in favor of the players in 1976 , the union found that making progress in bargaining was more difficult to achieve . The Rozelle Rule was invalidated by the court which found it constituted a refusal to deal and was therefore in violation of the Sherman Act as it deterred franchises from signing free agents . However , the change did not achieve true free agency as compensation remained tied to draft picks that were awarded based on the salary of the departing free agent and teams still maintained a right of first refusal . The NFL and NFLPA agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement in March 1977 that ran until 1982 . 
 = = = 1982 strike = = = 
 The 1982 NFL strike began on September 21 , 1982 , and lasted 57 days , ending on November 16 , 1982 . During this time , no NFL games were played . The strike occurred because the union demanded that a wage scale based on percentage of gross revenues be implemented . The NFLPA wanted the percentage to be 55 percent , and according to the Los Angeles Times , this demand " dominated the negotiations . " 
 During the strike , the NFLPA promoted two " AFC @-@ NFC ' all @-@ star ' games . " One was held at RFK Stadium in Washington D.C. on October 17 , 1982 , and the second was held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum a day later . One of the few stars who did play , future Hall of Fame running back John Riggins , explained " I guess I 'll do just about anything for money . " Despite a local TV blackout and ticket prices starting at six dollars , neither game drew well ; only 8 @,@ 760 fans attended in Washington , D.C. , and just 5 @,@ 331 attended in Los Angeles . With no NFL games to air , CBS replayed the previous Super Bowl and aired Division III football ; Pat Summerall and John Madden , for example , covered a game between Baldwin Wallace and Wittenberg . NBC acquired the rights to Canadian Football League games from ESPN , and aired them with NFL @-@ like production values ; the first four games it showed were all blowouts , however , with poor ratings , and the network gave up . 
 The 1982 strike ended with a players ' revolt against their own union , as some members suggested that Garvey step down as executive director . As a result of the strike , the season schedule was reduced from 16 games to 9 and the playoffs expanded to 16 teams ( eight from each conference ) for a " Super Bowl tournament . " A new five @-@ year agreement was ratified , providing severance packages to players upon retirement , an increase in salaries and post @-@ season pay , and bonuses based on the number of years of experience in the league . Additionally , the NFLPA was allowed to receive copies of all player contracts .

 In 1983 , former Oakland Raider Gene Upshaw became the executive director of the NFLPA . During his tenure , he oversaw a player strike , several antitrust lawsuits , and the collective bargaining agreement of 1993 .
