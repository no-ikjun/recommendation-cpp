 Many of the crucial events of the American Revolution — the Boston Massacre , the Boston Tea Party , Paul Revere 's midnight ride , the battles of Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill , the Siege of Boston , and many others — occurred in or near Boston . After the Revolution , Boston 's long seafaring tradition helped make it one of the world 's wealthiest international ports , with the slave trade , rum , fish , salt , and tobacco being particularly important . 
 The Embargo Act of 1807 , adopted during the Napoleonic Wars , and the War of 1812 significantly curtailed Boston 's harbor activity . Although foreign trade returned after these hostilities , Boston 's merchants had found alternatives for their capital investments in the interim . Manufacturing became an important component of the city 's economy , and by the mid @-@ 19th century , the city 's industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance . Until the early 20th century , Boston remained one of the nation 's largest manufacturing centers and was notable for its garment production and leather @-@ goods industries . A network of small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories . Later , a dense network of railroads furthered the region 's industry and commerce . 
 During this period , Boston flourished culturally as well , admired for its rarefied literary life and generous artistic patronage , with members of old Boston families — eventually dubbed Boston Brahmins — coming to be regarded as the nation 's social and cultural elites . 
 Boston was an early port of the Atlantic triangular slave trade in the New England colonies , but was soon overtaken by Salem , Massachusetts and Newport , Rhode Island . Eventually Boston became a center of the abolitionist movement . The city reacted strongly to the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 , contributing to President Franklin Pierce 's attempt to make an example of Boston after the Anthony Burns Fugitive Slave Case . 
 In 1822 , the citizens of Boston voted to change the official name from the " Town of Boston " to the " City of Boston " , and on March 4 , 1822 , the people of Boston accepted the charter incorporating the City . At the time Boston was chartered as a city , the population was about 46 @,@ 226 , while the area of the city was only 4 @.@ 7 square miles ( 12 km2 ) . 
 In the 1820s , Boston 's population grew rapidly , and the city 's ethnic composition changed dramatically with the first wave of European immigrants . Irish immigrants dominated the first wave of newcomers during this period , especially following the Irish Potato Famine ; by 1850 , about 35 @,@ 000 Irish lived in Boston . In the latter half of the 19th century , the city saw increasing numbers of Irish , Germans , Lebanese , Syrians , French Canadians , and Russian and Polish Jews settled in the city . By the end of the 19th century , Boston 's core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants — Italians inhabited the North End , Irish dominated South Boston and Charlestown , and Russian Jews lived in the West End . Irish and Italian immigrants brought with them Roman Catholicism . Currently , Catholics make up Boston 's largest religious community , and since the early 20th century , the Irish have played a major role in Boston politics — prominent figures include the Kennedys , Tip O 'Neill , and John F. Fitzgerald . 
 Between 1631 and 1890 , the city tripled its area through land reclamation by filling in marshes , mud flats , and gaps between wharves along the waterfront . The largest reclamation efforts took place during the 19th century ; beginning in 1807 , the crown of Beacon Hill was used to fill in a 50 @-@ acre ( 20 ha ) mill pond that later became the Haymarket Square area . The present @-@ day State House sits atop this lowered Beacon Hill . Reclamation projects in the middle of the century created significant parts of the South End , the West End , the Financial District , and Chinatown . 
 After The Great Boston Fire of 1872 , workers used building rubble as landfill along the downtown waterfront . During the mid @-@ to @-@ late 19th century , workers filled almost 600 acres ( 2 @.@ 4 km2 ) of brackish Charles River marshlands west of Boston Common with gravel brought by rail from the hills of Needham Heights . The city annexed the adjacent towns of South Boston ( 1804 ) , East Boston ( 1836 ) , Roxbury ( 1868 ) , Dorchester ( including present day Mattapan and a portion of South Boston ) ( 1870 ) , Brighton ( including present day Allston ) ( 1874 ) , West Roxbury ( including present day Jamaica Plain and Roslindale ) ( 1874 ) , Charlestown ( 1874 ) , and Hyde Park ( 1912 ) . Other proposals , for the annexation of Brookline , Cambridge , and Chelsea , were unsuccessful . 
 By the early and mid @-@ 20th century , the city was in decline as factories became old and obsolete , and businesses moved out of the region for cheaper labor elsewhere . Boston responded by initiating various urban renewal projects under the direction of the Boston Redevelopment Authority ( BRA ) , which was established in 1957 . In 1958 , BRA initiated a project to improve the historic West End neighborhood . Extensive demolition was met with strong public opposition . 
 The BRA subsequently reevaluated its approach to urban renewal in its future projects , including the construction of Government Center . In 1965 , the first Community Health Center in the United States opened , the Columbia Point Health Center , in the Dorchester neighborhood . It mostly served the massive Columbia Point public housing complex adjoining it , which was built in 1953 . The health center is still in operation and was rededicated in 1990 as the Geiger @-@ Gibson Community Health Center . The Columbia Point complex itself was redeveloped and revitalized into a mixed @-@ income community called Harbor Point Apartments from 1984 to 1990 . 
 By the 1970s , the city 's economy had recovered after 30 years of economic downturn . A large number of high rises were constructed in the Financial District and in Boston 's Back Bay during this time period . This boom continued into the mid @-@ 1980s and resumed after a few pauses . Hospitals such as Massachusetts General Hospital , Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , and Brigham and Women 's Hospital lead the nation in medical innovation and patient care . Schools such as Boston College , Boston University , the Harvard Medical School , Northeastern University , Wentworth Institute of Technology , Berklee College of Music and Boston Conservatory attract students to the area . Nevertheless , the city experienced conflict starting in 1974 over desegregation busing , which resulted in unrest and violence around public schools throughout the mid @-@ 1970s . 
 Boston is an intellectual , technological , and political center but has lost some important regional institutions , including the loss to mergers and acquisitions of local financial institutions such as <unk> Financial , which was acquired by Charlotte @-@ based Bank of America in 2004 . Boston @-@ based department stores Jordan Marsh and Filene 's have both been merged into the Cincinnati – based Macy 's . The 1993 acquisition of The Boston Globe by The New York Times was reversed in 2013 when it was re @-@ sold to Boston businessman John W. Henry . In 2016 , it was announced that General Electric would be moving its corporate headquarters from Connecticut to the Innovation District in South Boston , joining many other companies in this rapidly developing neighborhood . 
 Boston has experienced gentrification in the latter half of the 20th century , with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1990s . Living expenses have risen , and Boston has one of the highest costs of living in the United States , and was ranked the 129th most expensive major city in the world in a 2011 survey of 214 cities . Despite cost of living issues , Boston ranks high on livability ratings , ranking 36th worldwide in quality of living in 2011 in a survey of 221 major cities . 
 On April 15 , 2013 , two Chechen Islamist brothers detonated a pair of bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon , killing three people and injuring roughly 264 .

 Boston has an area of 89 @.@ 6 square miles ( 232 @.@ 1 km2 ) — 48 @.@ 4 square miles ( 125 @.@ 4 km2 ) ( 54 @.@ 0 % ) of land and 41 @.@ 2 square miles ( 106 @.@ 7 km2 ) ( 46 @.@ 0 % ) of water . The city 's official elevation , as measured at Logan International Airport , is 19 ft ( 5 @.@ 8 m ) above sea level . The highest point in Boston is Bellevue Hill at 330 feet ( 100 m ) above sea level , and the lowest point is at sea level . Situated onshore of the Atlantic Ocean , Boston is the only state capital in the contiguous United States with an oceanic coastline . 
 The geographical center of Boston is in Roxbury . Due north of the center we find the South End . This is not to be confused with South Boston which lies directly east from the South End . North of the South End is East Boston and southwest of East Boston is the North End . 
 Boston is surrounded by the " Greater Boston " region and is <unk> bordered by the cities and towns of Winthrop , Revere , Chelsea , Everett , Somerville , Cambridge , Newton , Brookline , Needham , Dedham , Canton , Milton , and Quincy . The Charles River separates Boston from Watertown and the majority of Cambridge , and the mass of Boston from its own Charlestown neighborhood . To the east lie Boston Harbor and the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area ( which includes part of the city 's territory , specifically Calf Island , <unk> Island , Great Brewster Island , Green Island , Little Brewster Island , Little Calf Island , Long Island , <unk> Island , Middle Brewster Island , <unk> Mate , Outer Brewster Island , Rainsford Island , Shag Rocks , Spectacle Island , The Graves , and Thompson Island ) . The Neponset River forms the boundary between Boston 's southern neighborhoods and the city of Quincy and the town of Milton . The Mystic River separates Charlestown from Chelsea and Everett , and Chelsea Creek and Boston Harbor separate East Boston from Boston proper .

 = = = Neighborhoods = = = 
 Boston is sometimes called a " city of neighborhoods " because of the profusion of diverse subsections ; the city government 's Office of Neighborhood Services has officially designated 23 neighborhoods . More than two @-@ thirds of inner Boston 's modern land area did not exist when the city was founded , but was created via the gradual filling in of the surrounding tidal areas over the centuries , notably with earth from the leveling or lowering of Boston 's three original hills ( the " <unk> " , after which Tremont Street is named ) , and with gravel brought by train from Needham to fill the Back Bay . 
 Downtown and its immediate surroundings consist largely of low @-@ rise ( often Federal style and Greek Revival ) masonry buildings , interspersed with modern highrises , notably in the Financial District , Government Center , and South Boston . Back Bay includes many prominent landmarks , such as the Boston Public Library , Christian Science Center , Copley Square , Newbury Street , and New England 's two tallest buildings — the John Hancock Tower and the Prudential Center . Near the John Hancock Tower is the old John Hancock Building with its prominent illuminated beacon , the color of which forecasts the weather . Smaller commercial areas are interspersed among areas of single @-@ family homes and wooden / brick multi @-@ family row houses . The South End Historic District is the largest surviving contiguous Victorian @-@ era neighborhood in the US . The geography of downtown and South Boston was particularly impacted by the Central Artery / Tunnel Project ( known unofficially as the " Big Dig " ) , which allowed for the removal of the unsightly elevated Central Artery and the incorporation of new green spaces and open areas . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Under the Köppen climate classification , Boston has a humid continental climate ( Köppen Dfa ) with some maritime influence . Despite its climate , the city lies at the transition between USDA plant hardiness zones 6b ( most of the city ) and 7a ( Downtown , South Boston , and East Boston neighborhoods ) . Summers are typically warm to hot , rainy , and humid , while winters oscillate between periods of cold rain and snow , with cold temperatures . Spring and fall are usually mild , with varying conditions dependent on wind direction and jet stream positioning . Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the influence of the Atlantic Ocean . 
 The hottest month is July , with a mean temperature of 73 @.@ 4 ° F ( 23 @.@ 0 ° C ) . The coldest month is January , with a mean of 29 @.@ 0 ° F ( − 1 @.@ 7 ° C ) . Periods exceeding 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) in summer and below freezing in winter are not uncommon but rarely extended , with about 13 and 25 days per year seeing each , respectively . The most recent sub @-@ 0 ° F ( − 18 ° C ) reading occurred on February 14 , 2016 , when the temperature dipped down to − 9 ° F ( − 23 ° C ) , the coldest reading since 1957 . In addition , several decades may pass between 100 ° F ( 38 ° C ) readings , with the most recent such occurrence on July 22 , 2011 , when the temperature reached 103 ° F ( 39 ° C ) . The city 's average window for freezing temperatures is November 9 through April 5 . Official temperature records have ranged from − 18 ° F ( − 28 ° C ) on February 9 , 1934 , up to 104 ° F ( 40 ° C ) on July 4 , 1911 ; the record cold daily maximum is 2 ° F ( − 17 ° C ) on December 30 , 1917 , while , conversely , the record warm daily minimum is 83 ° F ( 28 ° C ) on August 2 , 1975 . 
 Boston 's coastal location on the North Atlantic moderates its temperature , but makes the city very prone to Nor 'easter weather systems that can produce much snow and rain . The city averages 43 @.@ 8 inches ( 1 @,@ 110 mm ) of precipitation a year , with 43 @.@ 8 inches ( 111 cm ) of snowfall per season . Snowfall increases dramatically as one goes inland away from the city ( especially north and west of the city ) — away from the moderating influence of the ocean . Most snowfall occurs from December through March , as most years see no measurable snow in April and November , and snow is rare in May and October . There is also high year @-@ to @-@ year variability in snowfall ; for instance , the winter of 2011 – 12 saw only 9 @.@ 3 in ( 23 @.@ 6 cm ) of accumulating snow , but the previous winter , the corresponding figure was 81 @.@ 0 in ( 2 @.@ 06 m ) . 
 Fog is fairly common , particularly in spring and early summer , and the occasional tropical storm or hurricane can threaten the region , especially in late summer and early autumn . Due to its situation along the North Atlantic , the city often receives sea breezes , especially in the late spring , when water temperatures are still quite cold and temperatures at the coast can be more than 20 ° F ( 11 ° C ) colder than a few miles inland , sometimes dropping by that amount near midday . Thunderstorms occur from May to September , that are occasionally severe with large hail , damaging winds and heavy downpours . Although downtown Boston has never been struck by a violent tornado , the city itself has experienced many tornado warnings . Damaging storms are more common to areas north , west , and northwest of the city . Boston has a relatively sunny climate for a coastal city at its latitude , averaging over 2 @,@ 600 hours of sunshine per annum .

The city is the third most densely populated large U.S. city of over half a million residents . Some 1 @.@ 2 million persons may be within Boston 's boundaries during work hours , and as many as 2 million during special events . This fluctuation of people is caused by hundreds of thousands of suburban residents who travel to the city for work , education , health care , and special events . 
 In the city , the population was spread out with 21 @.@ 9 % at age 19 and under , 14 @.@ 3 % from 20 to 24 , 33 @.@ 2 % from 25 to 44 , 20 @.@ 4 % from 45 to 64 , and 10 @.@ 1 % who were 65 years of age or older .

In 2006 , the US Census Bureau estimated that non @-@ Hispanic whites again formed a slight majority . But as of 2010 , in part due to the housing crash , as well as increased efforts to make more affordable housing more available , the non @-@ white population has rebounded . This may also have to do with increased Latin American and Asian populations and more clarity surrounding US Census statistics , which indicate a non @-@ Hispanic white population of 47 percent ( some reports give slightly lower figures ) . 
 People of Irish descent form the largest single ethnic group in the city , making up 15 @.@ 8 % of the population , followed by Italians , accounting for 8 @.@ 3 % of the population .

 Like many major American cities , Boston has seen a great reduction in violent crime since the early 1990s . Boston 's low crime rate since the 1990s has been credited to the Boston Police Department 's collaboration with neighborhood groups and church parishes to prevent youths from joining gangs , as well as involvement from the United States Attorney and District Attorney 's offices . This helped lead in part to what has been touted as the " Boston Miracle " . Murders in the city dropped from 152 in 1990 ( for a murder rate of 26 @.@ 5 per 100 @,@ 000 people ) to just 31 — not one of them a juvenile — in 1999 ( for a murder rate of 5 @.@ 26 per 100 @,@ 000 ) . 
 In 2008 , there were 62 reported homicides . Through December 20 each of 2014 and 2015 , the Boston Police Department reported 52 and 39 homicides , respectively . 
 = = Culture = = 
 Boston shares many cultural roots with greater New England , including a dialect of the non @-@ rhotic Eastern New England accent known as Boston English , and a regional cuisine with a large emphasis on seafood , salt , and dairy products . Boston also has its own collection of neologisms known as Boston slang . 
 Boston has been called the " Athens of America " for its literary culture , earning a reputation as " the intellectual capital of the United States . " In the nineteenth century , Ralph Waldo Emerson , Henry David Thoreau , Nathaniel Hawthorne , Margaret Fuller , James Russell Lowell , and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote in Boston . Some consider the Old Corner Bookstore , where these writers met and where The Atlantic Monthly was first published , to be " cradle of American literature . In 1852 , the Boston Public Library was founded as the first free library in the United States . Boston 's literary culture continues today thanks to the city 's many universities and the Boston Book Festival . 
 Music is afforded a high degree of civic support in Boston . The Boston Symphony Orchestra is one of the " Big Five , " a group of the greatest American orchestras , and the classical music magazine Gramophone called it one of the " world 's best " orchestras . Symphony Hall ( located west of Back Bay ) is home to the Boston Symphony Orchestra , ( and the related Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra , which is the largest youth orchestra in the nation ) and the Boston Pops Orchestra . The British newspaper The Guardian called Boston Symphony Hall " one of the top venues for classical music in the world , " adding that " Symphony Hall in Boston was where science became an essential part of concert hall design . " Other concerts are held at the New England Conservatory 's Jordan Hall . The Boston Ballet performs at the Boston Opera House . Other performing @-@ arts organizations located in the city include the Boston Lyric Opera Company , Opera Boston , Boston Baroque ( the first permanent Baroque orchestra in the US ) , and the Handel and Haydn Society ( one of the oldest choral companies in the United States ) .

The city is the site of several events during the Fourth of July period . They include the week @-@ long Harborfest festivities and a Boston Pops concert accompanied by fireworks on the banks of the Charles River . 
 Because of the city 's prominent role in the American Revolution , several historic sites relating to that period are preserved as part of the Boston National Historical Park . Many are found along the Freedom Trail , which is marked by a red line of bricks embedded in the ground . The city is also home to several art museums , including the Museum of Fine Arts and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum . The Institute of Contemporary Art is housed in a contemporary building designed by Diller Scofidio + Renfro in the Seaport District . Columbia Point is the location of the University of Massachusetts Boston , the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate , the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum , and the Massachusetts Archives and Commonwealth Museum . The Boston Athenæum ( one of the oldest independent libraries in the United States ) , Boston Children 's Museum , Bull & Finch Pub ( whose building is known from the television show Cheers ) , Museum of Science , and the New England Aquarium are within the city . 
 Boston has been a noted religious center from its earliest days . The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston serves nearly 300 parishes and is based in the Cathedral of the Holy Cross ( 1875 ) in the South End , while the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts , with the Cathedral Church of St. Paul ( 1819 ) as its episcopal seat , serves just under 200 congregations . Unitarian Universalism has its headquarters on Beacon Hill . The Christian Scientists are headquartered in Back Bay at the Mother Church ( 1894 ) . The oldest church in Boston is First Church in Boston , founded in 1630 . King 's Chapel , the city 's first Anglican church , was founded in 1686 and converted to Unitarianism in 1785 . Other churches include Christ Church ( better known as Old North Church , 1723 ) , the oldest church building in the city , Trinity Church ( 1733 ) , Park Street Church ( 1809 ) , Old South Church ( 1874 ) , Jubilee Christian Church and Basilica and Shrine of Our Lady of Perpetual Help on Mission Hill ( 1878 ) .

 Air quality in Boston is generally very good : during the ten @-@ year period 2004 – 2013 , there were only 4 days in which the air was unhealthy for the general public , according to the EPA . 
 Some of the cleaner energy facilities in Boston include the Allston green district , with three ecologically compatible housing facilities . Boston is also breaking ground on multiple green affordable housing facilities to help reduce the carbon footprint of the city while simultaneously making these initiatives financially available to a greater population . Boston 's climate plan is updated every three years and was most recently modified in 2013 . This legislature includes the Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Ordinance , which requires the city 's larger buildings to disclose their yearly energy and water use statistics and partake in an energy assessment every five years . These statistics are made public by the city , thereby increasing incentives for buildings to be more environmentally conscious . 
 Another initiative , presented by the late Mayor Thomas Menino , is the Renew Boston Whole Building Incentive , which reduces the cost of living in buildings that are deemed energy efficient . This , much like the green housing developments , gives people of low socioeconomic status an opportunity to find housing in communities that support the environment . The ultimate goal of this initiative is to enlist 500 Bostonians to participate in a free , in @-@ home energy assessment .

 Many older buildings in certain areas of Boston are supported by wooden piles driven into the area 's fill ; these piles remain sound if submerged in water , but are subject to dry rot if exposed to air for long periods . Groundwater levels have been dropping , to varying degrees , in many areas of the city , due in part to an increase in the amount of rainwater discharged directly into sewers rather than absorbed by the ground . A city agency , the Boston Groundwater Trust , coordinates monitoring of groundwater levels throughout the city via a network of public and private monitoring wells . However , Boston 's drinking water supply , from the <unk> and Wachusett Reservoirs to the west , is one of the very few in the country so pure as to satisfy federal water quality standards without filtration .

 Boston has teams in the four major North American professional sports leagues plus Major League Soccer , and has won 36 championships in these leagues , As of 2014 . It is one of six cities ( along with Chicago , Detroit , Los Angeles , New York and Philadelphia ) to have won championships in all four major sports . It has been suggested that Boston is the new " <unk> , USA " , as the city 's professional sports teams have won nine championships since 2001 : Patriots ( 2001 , 2003 , 2004 , and 2014 ) , Red Sox ( 2004 , 2007 , and 2013 ) , Celtics ( 2008 ) , and Bruins ( 2011 ) . This love of sports has made Boston the United States Olympic Committee 's choice to bid to hold the 2024 Summer Olympic Games , but the city cited financial concerns when it withdrew its bid on July 27 , 2015 . 
 The Boston Red Sox , a founding member of the American League of Major League Baseball in 1901 , play their home games at Fenway Park , near Kenmore Square in the city 's Fenway section . Built in 1912 , it is the oldest sports arena or stadium in active use in the United States among the four major professional American sports leagues , Major League Baseball , the National Football League , National Basketball Association , and the National Hockey League . Boston was the site of the first game of the first modern World Series , in 1903 . The series was played between the AL Champion Boston Americans and the NL champion Pittsburgh Pirates . Persistent reports that the team was known in 1903 as the " Boston Pilgrims " appear to be unfounded . Boston 's first professional baseball team was the Red Stockings , one of the charter members of the National Association in 1871 , and of the National League in 1876 . The team played under that name until 1883 , under the name Beaneaters until 1911 , and under the name Braves from 1912 until they moved to Milwaukee after the 1952 season . Since 1966 they have played in Atlanta as the Atlanta Braves . 
 The TD Garden , formerly called the <unk> and built to replace the old , since @-@ demolished Boston Garden , is adjoined to North Station and is the home of two major league teams : the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League and the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association . The arena seats 18 @,@ 624 for basketball games and 17 @,@ 565 for ice hockey games . The Bruins were the first American member of the National Hockey League and an Original Six franchise . The Boston Celtics were founding members of the Basketball Association of America , one of the two leagues that merged to form the NBA . The Celtics have the distinction of having won more championships than any other NBA team , with seventeen . 
 While they have played in suburban Foxborough since 1971 , the New England Patriots of the National Football League were founded in 1960 as the Boston Patriots , changing their name after relocating . The team won the Super Bowl after the 2001 , 2003 , 2004 , and 2014 seasons . They share Gillette Stadium with the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer . The Boston Breakers of Women 's Professional Soccer , which formed in 2009 , play their home games at <unk> Stadium in Somerville . The Boston Storm of the United Women 's Lacrosse League was formed in 2015 . 
 The area 's many colleges and universities are active in college athletics . Four NCAA Division I members play in the city — Boston College , Boston University , Harvard University , and Northeastern University . Of the four , only Boston College participates in college football at the highest level , the Football Bowl Subdivision . Harvard participates in the second @-@ highest level , the Football Championship Subdivision . 
 One of the best known sporting events in the city is the Boston Marathon , the 26 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 42 @.@ 2 km ) race which is the world 's oldest annual marathon , run on Patriots ' Day in April . On April 15 , 2013 , two explosions killed three people and injured hundreds at the marathon . Another major annual event is the Head of the Charles Regatta , held in October .

 Boston Common , located near the Financial District and Beacon Hill , is the oldest public park in the United States . Along with the adjacent Boston Public Garden , it is part of the Emerald Necklace , a string of parks designed by Frederick Law Olmsted to encircle the city . The Emerald Necklace includes Jamaica Pond , Boston 's largest body of freshwater , and Franklin Park , the city 's largest park and home of the Franklin Park Zoo . Another major park is the Esplanade , located along the banks of the Charles River . The Hatch Shell , an outdoor concert venue , is located adjacent to the Charles River Esplanade . Other parks are scattered throughout the city , with the major parks and beaches located near Castle Island ; in Charlestown ; and along the Dorchester , South Boston , and East Boston shorelines . 
 Boston 's park system is well @-@ reputed nationally . In its 2013 ParkScore ranking , The Trust for Public Land reported that Boston was tied with Sacramento and San Francisco for having the third @-@ best park system among the 50 most populous US cities . ParkScore ranks city park systems by a formula that analyzes the city 's median park size , park acres as percent of city area , the percent of residents within a half @-@ mile of a park , spending of park services per resident , and the number of playgrounds per 10 @,@ 000 residents .

 = The Manchester Rambler = 
 " The Manchester Rambler " , also known as " I 'm a Rambler " and " The Rambler 's Song " , is a song written by the English folk singer Ewan MacColl . It was inspired by his participation in the Kinder trespass , a protest by the urban Young Communist League of Manchester , and was the work that began MacColl 's career as a singer @-@ songwriter . 
 Since the 1950s , the song has become a standard among folk musicians , as it was for MacColl himself . It has been covered many times , including by The Dubliners and The Houghton Weavers . It has been sung both in clubs and in the open air on a variety of occasions , including at Kinder Downfall in 2009 when Kinder was designated as a National Nature Reserve . 
 = = Context = = 
 The Kinder mass trespass was a deliberate act of civil disobedience ( the law of trespass having already been repealed ) by men of the Young Communist League of Manchester , and others from Sheffield . The protest was intended to secure free access to England 's mountains and moorlands . The ' ramblers ' , led by Benny Rothman , walked from Bowden Bridge Quarry , near Hayfield to climb the hill called Kinder Scout in the Derbyshire Peak District on 24 April 1932 . A young man called James Henry Miller , better known as Ewan MacColl , was a keen rambler and an enthusiastic member of the Young Communist League . He played a major part in organising the publicity for the trespass , duplicating and handing out leaflets , though this role is disputed . He took part in the trespass , and was shocked by the violent reaction of the gamekeepers who met the ramblers on the hill , and the extremely harsh sentences handed down by the magistrates to the five ramblers who were arrested that day . What MacColl did not know was that the protest was to have a powerful long @-@ term effect , leading to improved access to the countryside in the shape of national parks ( from 1949 ) , long @-@ distance footpaths starting with the Pennine Way ( opened in 1965 ) and various forms of the desired ' right to roam ' ( such as with the <unk> Act , 2000 ) . 
 In his biographer Ben Harker 's view , " It would be difficult to overstate the extent to which MacColl was shaped by the 1930s . " MacColl was a keen rambler , travelling out of Manchester by bus into the Peak District , like thousands of other young unemployed people with time on their hands . For MacColl , rambling was integral to his politics ; he did not simply find nature beautiful and the urban world ugly : instead , it was an objective of the hoped @-@ for revolution : 
 to create a world that would harmonize with that other one that you enjoyed so much ... If the bourgeoisie had had any sense at all they would never have allowed the working class into that kind of countryside . Because it bred a spirit of revolt . 
 Groups of ramblers often sang songs such as " I 'm Happy When I 'm Hiking " , as well as bawdy songs , ballads and radical American protest songs at their camps . MacColl published the " Manchester Youth Song " in 1933 , singing of " Workers in Cheetham , who slave every day / In waterproof factories at starvation pay " . He also wrote the song " Mass Trespass 1932 " , setting words like " For the mass trespass is the only way there is / To gain access to the mountains once again " to the old Scottish tune of " The Road to the Isles " . His friends used to sing it as they <unk> in the hills . 
 = = Folk song = = 
 " The Manchester Rambler " , written in 1932 not long after the Kinder trespass and inspired by that event , was Ewan MacColl 's first important song , according to Harker , who argues that it " marks a departure from the [ singer 's ] leaden @-@ footed and slogan @-@ heavy juvenilia " . It is also the first song that still survives for which he wrote the melody as well as the lyrics . Its swinging , jaunty melody demonstrates MacColl 's ability to combine musical forms and popular rhythms to create a song which is at once familiar and unique . Like the melody , the lyrics are witty and playful . They put out a defiant political message with " I may be a wage slave on Monday / But I am a free man on Sunday " . MacColl plays with and updates traditional English folksong phraseology with " I once loved a maid , a spot @-@ welder by trade / She was fair as the Rowan in bloom " . The lyrics are suitably comical on the confrontation between the ramblers and the gamekeepers in the style of musical theatre , argues Harker , with lines such as " He called me a louse and said ' Think of the grouse ' " . The song has 5 verses , each of 8 lines , and a 4 @-@ line chorus . 
 The song names the following places : Snowdon ( North Wales ) ; Crowden ( by the Woodhead pass road in Derbyshire ) ; the <unk> ( on the Bleaklow plateau in Derbyshire ) ; Kinder Scout ; Manchester ; <unk> and Upper Tor ( both Edale , Derbyshire ) . 
 " The Manchester Rambler " is published by Green Linnet on Ewan MacColl 's 1996 CD " Black and White : The Definitive Collection " , also released by Cooking Vinyl Records ; the recording lasts 4 minutes 42 seconds , and MacColl is assisted on vocals by his wife , the folk singer Peggy Seeger . 
 = = Reception and influence = = 
 Ben Harker said of " The Manchester Rambler " that 
 Rambler is the song where it all comes together . He 'd written these rather earnest agitprop pieces prior to that , but in Rambler , he manages to pull together a political perspective with a more lyrical style ... It crystallises his songwriting and that 's the first time it happens . 
 MacColl performed the song as a standard all his life . Cover versions were performed and recorded by dozens of folk musicians from the 1950s onwards , including by The Dubliners on " Alive Alive @-@ O " and 30 Years A @-@ <unk> . Kirsty MacColl ( daughter of Ewan ) covered the song on her 1991 album The One And Only , while Casey Neill covered it on his eponymous album in 1999 . The Houghton Weavers covered it on their 2005 album Sit Thi <unk> , and in the same year Mick Groves performed it on his album " Fellow Journeyman " . Patterson Jordan Dipper covered it on their album " Flat Earth " in 2010 , and Danny and Mary O 'Leary covered it in 2014 . 
 The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography writes of MacColl that " One of his first and finest protest songs , ‘ The Manchester Rambler ’ , dealt with the ‘ mass trespass ’ campaigns of the 1930s , in which hikers fought pitched battles with gamekeepers when they invaded privately owned grouse moors . " The Encyclopaedia of Contemporary British Culture describes Ewan MacColl as " a crucial figure " in the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s , and names " The Manchester Rambler " as one of his " more famous songs " . 
 The comedian and folk singer Mike Harding , in The Guardian , wrote that 
 When I was a young lad walking in the hills for the first time , camping out on the Pots and Pans stone on Saddleworth Moor , getting the last bus back from Hayfield , crawling up Jack 's Rake , in Langdale , we sang that song and meant every word of it . 
 Harding was running a Manchester folk club on Sunday nights at that time , and 
 on those nights the lobby would be choked with the <unk> of the people who had just come off the hill and were looking forward to a night of beer and songs ... Most nights in the pub we would sing the Manchester Rambler , only too aware that it was people like Rothman and Stephenson who had fought to get the hills opened up for us . We knew that Rothman had gone to jail for walking on Kinder Scout during the mass trespass in 1932 . 
 The song was sung at Kinder Downfall ( the waterfall on Kinder Scout ) in 2009 when Kinder was designated as a National Nature Reserve ( NNR ) ; in attendance were establishment figures including three Members of Parliament , the Chief Executive Officers of three National Parks and the leaders of Natural England . The British Mountaineering Council 's booklet issued in 2012 to commemorate 80 years of the Kinder mass trespass reproduced the lyrics of " The Manchester Rambler " in full . 
 = New York State Route 428 = 
 New York State Route 428 ( NY 428 ) was a north – south state highway located within Chautauqua County , New York , in the United States . The southern terminus of the route was at an intersection with NY 39 in Forestville . Its northern terminus was at a junction with U.S. Route 20 ( US 20 ) in Silver Creek . The route passed through mostly rural areas and crossed over the New York State Thruway ( Interstate 90 or I @-@ 90 ) without connecting to the highway . 
 NY 428 was assigned c . 1932 and removed in 1980 after ownership and maintenance of the highway was transferred from the state of New York to Chautauqua County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government . Although the swap took effect on April 1 , the NY 428 designation was not removed until September 9 . The former routing of NY 428 is now the northernmost section of County Route 85 ( CR 85 ) .

 NY 428 began at an intersection with NY 39 and CR 87 in Forestville .

Outside of Forestville in Hanover , NY 428 continued northward as Bennett State Road through farmland , paralleling both CR 89 and Walnut Creek to the hamlet of <unk> Corners , where it met CR 84 . 
 The highway continued onward through open fields , intersecting CR 86 just before passing over the New York State Thruway ( I @-@ 90 ) . Past the Thruway , NY 428 continued north along Silver Creek into the village of Silver Creek , where it became known as Division Street at the village line . It followed Division Street for two blocks through a lightly populated area before turning west onto Burgess Street for another two blocks through a more densely populated portion of the community . NY 428 ended at an intersection with US 20 south of the village center .

 NY 428 was assigned c . 1932 to a previously unnumbered roadway between Forestville and Silver Creek . The route remained intact until 1980 when the roadway was given to Chautauqua County as part of a large @-@ scale maintenance swap of routes within the county . Under the terms of the deal , NY 428 was transferred to the county along with NY 424 , the segment of NY 380 between NY 424 and US 20 , and two reference routes in the vicinity of Dunkirk and Fredonia . In exchange , NYSDOT assumed control over NY 394 between US 20 and NY 5 in Westfield , US 62 from NY 60 to NY 394 east of Jamestown , and Forest Avenue ( unsigned reference route NY <unk> ) from the Pennsylvania state line in Busti to NY 60 in Jamestown . Although the swap was officially conducted on April 1 , NY 428 was not removed until September 9 .

 " Stupid Girl " began as a rough demo around January 1994 . It was recorded during informal studio sessions between Duke Erikson , Steve Marker and Butch Vig in Marker 's home basement recording studio in Madison , Wisconsin prior to Shirley Manson joining the group . The band had been jamming using an ADAT eight @-@ track , <unk> samplers and a small drum kit . Vig took a loop from the drum introduction from The Clash 's " Train In Vain " and added further percussion . Afterwards , Marker created the bassline , under the request of doing something like Creedence Clearwater Revival 's " Suzie Q " , " something that 's almost like a Motown feel " . Erikson finished off what became the song 's core with a jangly guitar riff . 
 After Marker saw Manson 's group Angelfish on 120 Minutes , the band invited her to Vig and Marker 's Smart Studios to sing on a couple of songs , but after a " dreadful " first audition , she returned to Angelfish . Manson eventually returned to Smart for a successful second time , where she began to work on the then @-@ skeletal " Queer " , " Vow " and " Stupid Girl " . Working on the lyrics , " Stupid Girl " became an " anthem for a girl who won 't settle for less than what she wants " . Later she added , " [ " Stupid Girl " is ] really about squandering potential , [ it 's ] our version of Madonna 's ' Express Yourself ' , but a little more subversive " . Manson aimed the song as a rebuke towards a friend 's foolish behaviour : " A lot of females still find it difficult to find their own voice in society . It 's just that women have a different set of problems from men ... make the most of your potential . " Manson added that " Stupid Girl " was " a song of reproach to a lot of people we know " , both male and female , and that " we could have called it ' Stupid Guy , ' but we thought another song about a strident female dissing a guy would be tedious . " 
 Garbage wanted to write a song that incorporated a very thumpy and repetitive bass line ; this would act as a hook . Continuing to develop the demo throughout the recording process for what would eventually become the band 's debut album , the group decided to add textures , guitars , and keys to make " Stupid Girl " dynamic rather than built on complicated chord changes . Marker and Vig then added in elements of ambient sound effects throughout the audio mix ; including the " glitchy " sound of a broken DAT player used during the pre @-@ chorus . Marker had been dubbing between audio tracks , resulting in scratchy feedback ; he sampled the sound and tuned it to fit the song , unintentionally created by an alternative hook . When Manson recorded her first vocals for " Stupid Girl " , the band realised that the key that the song had been arranged in was too low , but instead of re @-@ recording the guitars , Vig re @-@ printed them through a pitch @-@ change patch on an effects unit . Erikson commented that the effects are " just ear candy , but they contribute to the character of the song , make the listener think in a certain way about the song " . Additional percussion on " Stupid Girl " was performed by Madison musician Pauli Ryan , while the bass guitar line was played on record by Milwaukee session bassist Mike Kashou , both of whom performed on a number of tracks on the band 's debut album . 
 Reflecting on the success of the song in 2002 , Vig admitted : " People still ask us who the ' Stupid Girl ' is , and that 's impossible to answer . The song is sort of meant to be a wake up call . It could be about an ex @-@ girlfriend . It could be about a rock diva that we all know , it could be about your sister . It could also be called ' Stupid Boy ' . " Looking back , he also stated , " It 's impossible to predict what will be a hit . But subconsciously , I knew the song was good when I kept playing the same rough mix over and over again on my car stereo for months . " 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 " Stupid Girl " is a moderately alternative rock fast song with touches of electronica , set in common time . It is built on a I @-@ IV change in F ♯ , with both chords , F ♯ 7 and B7 . 
 The tonal function of a " dominant " seventh chord is to resolve up a perfect fourth . In non @-@ classical harmony , the chord is often used similarly , but also , especially in blues , funk , and early rock music , it is used commonly for its color that seems to mesh major and minor together with its major third , minor seventh , and the dissonant interval between the two . When the F ♯ 7 chord is played , it should traditionally resolve to B , which would expectedly be a B major 7th chord , the M7 being the major 3rd of the tonic . 
 Instead , on the B note is another dominant seventh . Such chords are the basis of the twelve @-@ bar blues , and are used in this way to give " Stupid Girl " a bluesy , rock- ' n ' -roll feel , the chord change is manipulated to emphasize the B 's flatted seventh ( a minor third from the tonic ) , giving the song a sulky mood . This chord change is used for the intro , verse , chorus and the instrumental sections , with exception to the pre @-@ chorus , which is in the relative key of D ♯ minor . Overall , even regardless of the chord progression , the song seems to fall somewhere between major and minor , and the use of four @-@ note seventh chords ( as opposed to " three @-@ note " chords ) help to form a rich atmosphere . " Stupid Girl " is mainly carried by this arrangement , along with drum beats , sampled from " Train In Vain " . 
 On the intro , four bars set the rhythm , adorned by only a guitar pick @-@ slide and audio effects . The verse adds Manson 's vocals and a bass riff which uses flattened blue notes to give " Stupid Girl " an funky , unsettled feel . The eight @-@ bar <unk> abruptly cuts in with minor chords and sampled feedback replaces the bass which drops out . This , coupled with Manson singing high in her range , creates tension and enables the presence of the bass to be felt when it re @-@ enters on the chorus . The guitar figures in the bridge include a phrase played low and rhythmic guitar stabs on the opposite side of the audio mix . On the chorus , Manson 's main vocal is answered by an " <unk> @-@ ah " of voice and guitar together . The word " girl " lands on a flattened bass note ( A against the F ♯ note , instead of A ♯ ) .

 The music video for " Stupid Girl " was filmed on January 16 , 1996 in Los Angeles by director Samuel Bayer .

 The video debuted internationally on February 1 , 1996 , and in North America on May 5 . MTV certified " Stupid Girl " a Buzz @-@ clip , the band 's third video in a row to be guaranteed heavy airplay on the network , while VH1 added the video at the start of September and incorporated it into a Pop Up Video episode . 
 The video for " Stupid Girl " is a performance piece , inspired by the title sequence from David Fincher 's 1995 movie Se7en . The clip was shot in just four hours entirely within a warehouse decorated with plexiglas sheets on which the song lyrics were written . Bayer cut the film into pieces , and soaked it in his bath , applying deliberate fingerprints and abrasions to the footage before putting it back together by hand . Vig would compliment the video for mirroring the band 's sound : " some of it looked beautiful , some of it looked distorted , and kinda fucked up - and it sorta described some of our music visually " . Bayer later re @-@ edited a second version of the video , with alternative footage from the original shoot for a remix version of " Stupid Girl " by Todd Terry .

He sings " Hot for Teacher " by Van Halen , with Mike ( Harry Shum , Jr . ) , Blaine ( Darren Criss ) and Finn ( Cory Monteith ) .

He challenges Santana and the other Troubletones to a game of dodgeball . Finn and Santana are the last two people standing , until Santana whips a ball at Finn 's face , and wins the game .

 Cheerleading coach Sue ( Jane Lynch ) starts a campaign against Burt Hummel ( Mike O 'Malley ) , her main rival in the election for congress . When Burt 's son Kurt ( Chris Colfer ) accuses her of lying , Sue defends her tactics , and tells Kurt that his own campaign for senior class president is boring and lacks edge . When the presidential candidates make their assembly speeches , Kurt pledges to ban dodgeball , a sport he says is too often used to bully . Rachel ( Lea Michele ) withdraws her candidacy and urges everyone to vote for Kurt .

The two make up , and go to work on Kurt 's campaign . 
 Mercedes ( Amber Riley ) is elected president of the Troubletones , and tells Santana that she should play fair against New Directions from now on . Santana makes a rare apology to Finn in the school hallway , but her so @-@ called apology consists of a series of insults .

A couple of days later , Santana is told by Sue and Burt that the niece of one of their opponents in the election overheard the conversation between her and Finn , and said opponent is about to release an attack ad that criticizes Sue for choosing a lesbian as head cheerleader .

The moment the performance ends , Santana jumps down from the stage , blames Finn for outing her to the world and slaps him in the face .

 " Mash Off " was written by Michael Hitchcock and directed by Eric Stoltz . Principal photography for the episode commenced on October 6 , 2011 , while the fifth episode , " The First Time " was still shooting ; It was initially filmed in parallel with that episode , which continued through October 14 , 2011 , and also with the seventh episode , which began filming on October 13 , 2011 . This episode marked the 300th musical number Glee has filmed , which was a mash @-@ up of two Adele songs : " Rumour Has It " and " Someone Like You " , with lead vocals by Amber Riley and Naya Rivera . The performance was filmed with great fanfare " in front of an audience of press and crew members " on October 26 , 2011 , and included a press briefing afterward . Riley revealed during the briefing that she suggested the idea that she perform Adele to co @-@ creators Brad Falchuk and Ryan Murphy after finding out that Adele was hoping Riley would sing her music on the show : " Someone actually e @-@ mailed me a video of Adele saying that she wanted me to sing her song , so I e @-@ mailed it to Brad and Ryan . " 
 The episode was to contain a flashback to a sixteen @-@ year @-@ old Sue , played by Colby Minifie , singing the title song of the musical Oklahoma ! in a scene that would have explained Sue 's antipathy to music in the schools . Series co @-@ creator Ian Brennan said " we wanted to show that Sue at one point had Broadway dreams " , and Lynch reveals , " Will tells Sue , ' Poor little Susie Sylvester was told she wasn 't good , and now she 's got to punish the world . ' Like a lot of angry people out there , Sue 's a wannabe . " However , the scene was not broadcast because it was , according to Murphy , " too long for the episode " ; he also stated that the footage , with the title " How Sue Sylvester Became a Bitch " , would be released in the future , " either as a DVD extra or online " . 
 Three other mash @-@ ups beyond the Adele one are performed in the episode : a Hall & Oates mash @-@ up of " I Can 't Go for That " and " You Make My Dreams " performed by New Directions , a mash @-@ up of Lady Gaga 's " You and I " and Eddie Rabbitt and Crystal Gayle 's " You and I " , performed by Morrison and Menzel , and one of Pat Benatar 's " Hit Me with Your Best Shot " and Blondie 's " One Way or Another " , performed by competing glee clubs New Directions and the Troubletones .

 Television critics were more favorable than not in their response to " Mash Off " . Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone felt that the series returned to form in the episode , and commented : " We 've said it before and we 'll say it again : we like our Glee with just enough ridiculousness , and this week had it . " Entertainment Weekly journalist Abby West noted that she loved the fact that it " was a bullying episode that snuck up on us " . Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal opined that " Mash Off " was one of the best installments of Glee , and cited the episode 's storylines as highlights : " The mash @-@ up episodes every season can be hit or miss , but this year was perfected to the nth degree . " Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times wrote that there was plenty of " airy fun to be found " in " Mash Off " , but added that " underneath all the silly fake mustaches and snappy quotes about root @-@ beer fountains and robot teachers beat a very dark baboon heart . In the end , that murky , telltale undercurrent burst to the fore , like a ... slap in the face , leaving us gasping and a little confused . " Houston Chronicle 's Bobby Hankinson stated that it was " surprisingly good " , and that " Mash Off " was a " solid hour of television that was bursting with fantastic musical numbers and some really gratifying narrative developments " . Michael Slezak of TV Line said that the episode contributed to a revitalization of the quality of the show 's third season . 
 Catriona Wightman of Digital Spy wrote , " This was a confusing episode of Glee . For a while , it seemed pretty unremarkable — a standard installment , meandering along enjoyably enough . But then , in the last few minutes , it suddenly got really rather dark indeed . I 'm intrigued about what happens next . " The A.V. Club 's Todd VanDerWerff gave " Mash Off " a " C " grade , and felt that the episode did not reach its full potential . He wrote , " The gut @-@ punch moment is sufficiently gut @-@ punchy , and we 'll get to that in a bit . But everything building up to it is so messy that the solidly dramatic moment almost made me angry . There 's something about this show that leads to messy tonal mash @-@ ups . But where the show 's musical mash @-@ ups are usually pretty harmonious , the tonal shifts can often be brutally unsubtle . " James Poniewozik of Time felt that it was notably inferior to the previous episode , with many more " forgettable scenes and stories " . 
 The character development of Santana and her interactions with Finn were well received by critics . Poniewozik stated that Santana confronting her sexuality was one of the highlights of " Mash Off " . Wightman commented that despite Santana 's callous personality , " watching her burst into tears and sob that she hasn 't even told her parents about her sexuality yet [ was ] heartbreaking " . Robert Canning of IGN wrote , " The biggest development was the unexpected way Santana 's sexuality became public . It was a nice way to end things , building tension towards hopefully more resonating episodes to come . " VanDerWerff said that " the last five minutes of this episode are phenomenal , one of those times that the show gets the mix of tones just right and something that 's vaguely comedic gets more and more horrifying and dramatic , and then we plunge down the rabbit hole and everything goes nuts . " To Ryan <unk> of Wetpaint , the scene that concluded " Mash Off " was a " fascinating twist , and one that makes it hard to choose sides " . He added , " Santana has certainly been not @-@ exactly @-@ cuddly these past few weeks , but it 's still clear that Finn totally crossed the line . "

 The opening number for the episode , " Hot for Teacher " , was commended by most critics . Futterman described it as a " high @-@ energy performance with the right amount of absurdity " . Brett Berk of Vanity Fair gave the musical number a four out of five stars , and cited the choreography as the highlight of the performance . West gave it a grade of " A – " , and wrote , " This was such big fun and the backup guys ... really helped amp it up . " Slezak was less enthusiastic about the sequence . He was critical of Salling 's vocals , and felt that a heavy metal song was not suited to his stylings ; he ultimately gave it a " C + " grade . He also criticized the choreography , and stated that he had to " downgrade a little for Blaine and Mike Chang 's grotesque ' <unk> , I 'm hiding an erection ! ' dance move that will probably haunt me to my grave . " 
 Berk said that the mash @-@ up of the two " You and I " songs " almost worked " , while Los Angeles Times writer L 'Oreal Thompson praised the vocals of Menzel : " It 's official . Shelby sings Gaga as good as , if not better than , Gaga sings Gaga . " Slezak awarded the performance a " B " grade , and opined : " I loved the audacity of mashing up Lady Gaga with an Eddie Rabbit – Crystal Gayle chestnut , and the results had the sheen of ' 70s a.m. radio fare . Shelby 's voice was almost too crystal clear for the Gaga half of the composition . " Futterman said that Menzel " can kill a Gaga ballad " , and while she " outshines " Morrison , he " complements her nicely " . West gave the mash @-@ up a " B + " , called it " really well @-@ done " and said it was " elevated " by Menzel 's voice . MTV 's Kevin P. Sullivan wanted Menzel to interpret more songs by Lady Gaga . In contrast , Rae Votta of Billboard denounced the sequence , and called it " horrendous " . 
 West gave the mash @-@ up of " Hit Me With Your Best Shot " / " One Way or Another " a " B " grade , while Slezak gave the performance a " B + " . Slezak wrote , " Santana 's moments on lead were obviously stronger than Finn 's Auto @-@ Tuned into submission vocals , but that doesn 't mean the number wasn 't a hoot . " Futterman called it a " fierce match " , and added the mash @-@ up was well crafted . Hankinson rated it the second best performance of the episode . Brian Moyler of Gawker , who writes of his dislike of mash @-@ ups , characterized it as " the only mash @-@ up of the night that actually makes sense " but he called it an " awful aural clash " and " the second least dreadful " . 
 Moyler felt that the combination of " I Can 't Go for That " and " You Make My Dreams " was " an abomination " and " New Directions at their worst " . He summarized : " The outfits are hokey , the dance is silly , and the music has absolutely no emotion in it . " Slezak , however , issued the performance an " A – " grade , and wrote , " The Troubletones beat New Directions in this particular battle , but I loved the frothy , silly spirit of this number , with the guys dressed like Miami Vice extras , Puck and Blaine rocking <unk> , and Tina getting a little moment on lead vocals . " Votta characterized the performance as a " fun , retro number " , and Jen Chaney of The Washington Post was similarly pleased , and gave it a " B + " . 
 The episode 's concluding musical number , " Rumour Has It " / " Someone Like You " , was acclaimed as its main highlight . Raymund Flandez described Rivera 's vocals as " electrifying " and " golden " . Futterman wrote that the performance was one of Glee 's best sequences : " Mercedes and Santana nail their vocals and the song combines great tracks from one of the year 's biggest albums while capturing both the sass and sadness of the Troubletones at this particular moment . " Votta called it the best performance since the cast 's rendition of " Don 't Stop Believin ' " in the season one finale , " Journey to Regionals " , and stated , " Naya Rivera 's powerful vocals and the strong arrangement still packs the emotional punch Glee was targeting . " Chaney awarded the sequence a " A + " grade : " Given the emotional stakes raised by Santana 's outing , which happened in the scene right before this performance , and the fact that it marked the series 's 300th musical performance , this marriage " of the two Adele songs , " Rumour Has It " and " Someone Like You " , was " all the more powerful " . Moyler asserted that the number was " perfection " and said , " This is why I watch Glee . It is just brilliant from Mercedes first belting to the snaps on the beat to the choreography with the girls walking in a circle and making little whispers to Santana bringing tears to my eyes singing ' Someone Like You ' as if it was the last song she 'll ever sing in her damn life . " Cinema Blend 's Melissa <unk> stated that the show " hit it out of the park " and added that it was her favorite performance of the season . Slezak gave the number an " A + " and wrote , " Nobody can completely match Adele doing Adele , and yet Naya Rivera and Amber Riley somehow made the sum of this mashup a worthy equal to Adele 's glorious original parts . " In December 2012 , TV Guide named the mash @-@ up one of Glee 's best performances .

 = Cyclone Sina = 
 Severe Tropical Cyclone Sina was the only named tropical cyclone to develop within the South Pacific basin during the 1990 – 91 season . The system was first noted as a shallow depression within the South Pacific Convergence Zone to the west of Wallis Island . Over the next three days the system moved towards the west @-@ northwest , before it was named Sina during November 24 , after it had developed into a tropical cyclone . Over the next couple of days the system intensified further and developed an eye feature as it erratically moved towards Fiji . Sina subsequently peaked in intensity during November 26 , before the system passed through the Fijian Islands over the next two days as it started to gradually weaken . Sina subsequently passed just to the north of Tongatapu in Tonga during November 29 , before it passed about 160 km ( 100 mi ) to the south of Niue and near the Southern Cook Islands during the next day . The system subsequently rapidly weakened and became an extratropical cyclone during December 1 , before they were absorbed by an advancing trough of low pressure near 50 ° S on December 4 . 
 The cyclone caused no deaths and over $ 18 @.@ 5 million in damages , as it affected Fiji , Tonga , Niue and the Southern Cook Islands . Ahead of the system affecting Fiji , hundreds of people were evacuated from Fiji 's outer island resorts to hotels on the mainland . High winds and heavy rain forced the closure of several local airports and the main Nadi International Airport . As Sina moved through the archipelago , the system destroyed or damaged houses and other building structures , while bringing down electric and telephone lines and uprooting trees . The system also washed away a railway bridge on Vanua Levu that was used to take sugar cane to Labasa 's mills , leaving growers no choice but to go through the village of Korowiri . However , the workers refused to go into their fields unless they had police protection to go through the village , after Methodists from the local church attacked a group of growers for working on Sundays in defiance of Fiji 's Sunday Observance Decree . Within Tonga only minor damage to weak structures , trees , banana plantations , electric and telephone lines was recorded . Within both Niue and the Southern Cook Islands only minor damage to crops and structures was reported .

 On November 20 , the Fiji Meteorological Service 's Nadi tropical cyclone warning center ( TCWC Nadi ) started to monitor a shallow tropical depression that had developed within the South Pacific Convergence Zone to the west of Wallis Island . Over the next two days the system moved towards the west @-@ northwest and the Fijian dependency of Rotuma , before the depression 's chances of developing further became good during November 23 , as upper outflow over the system became established . The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) subsequently initiated advisories and classified the depression as Tropical Cyclone 03P at 1200 UTC the next day , after atmospheric convection surrounding the system organized further . Later that day at 19 : 10 UTC , TCWC Nadi named the system Sina after the depression had developed into a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale , while it was located about 425 km ( 265 mi ) to the northwest of Rotuma . During November 25 , the cyclone continued to intensify and developed an eye as it moved erratically towards the west @-@ southwest and performed a small clockwise loop . Early on November 26 , TCWC Nadi reported that Sina had become a category 3 severe tropical cyclone . At around this time the JTWC reported that Sina had become equivalent to a category one hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane wind scale ( SSHWS ) . 
 During that day , Sina 's eye became very distinct on satellite imagery . As the system intensified and came under the influence of a changeable upper level steering flow which resulted in Sina moving erratically towards the southeast and Fiji . Later that day TCWC Nadi reported that the system had peaked as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone , with 10 @-@ minute sustained windspeeds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) . The JTWC subsequently reported early the next day that Sina had peaked with 1 @-@ minute sustained windspeeds of 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) , which made it equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the SSHWS . During that day , Sina remained at its peak intensity as it moved towards the east @-@ southeast and started to be observed on the Nadi radar . Later that day , as the system started to gradually weaken , it passed about 40 km ( 25 mi ) to the south of Viti Levu before it passed over the island groups of Vatulele and Moala and the Southern Lau Islands during November 28 . During that day the system moved across the 180th meridian , which prompted the JTWC issue their final warning on Sina and pass the responsibility for warning the United States Government to the Naval Western Oceanography Center . 
 Early on November 29 , Sina weakened into a category two tropical cyclone on the Australian scale just before it passed to the north of Tongatapu in Tonga . During that day , as the system moved eastwards towards the Southern Cook Islands and gradually weakened further , the NWOC issued their final advisory on Sina while estimating that it was equivalent to a category one hurricane on the SSHWS . Early on November 30 , the system passed about 160 km ( 100 mi ) to the south of Niue , before it recurved sharply towards the south @-@ southeast later that day as it approached the Southern Cook Islands . The system subsequently started to rapidly weaken under the influence of strong vertical wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures . TCWC Nadi subsequently passed the primary warning responsibility for Sina to TCWC Wellington as it crossed 25 ° S , who quickly reported that the system had lost its tropical characteristics and had become an extratropical depression . Over the next couple of days Sina 's extratropical remnants maintained a south @-@ eastward track , before it was absorbed by an advancing trough of low pressure near 50 ° S on December 4 .

 Cyclone Sina affected Fiji , Tonga , Niue and the Southern Cook Islands and was responsible for damages totaling over $ 18 @.@ 5 million . The system had initially appeared to threaten the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu as it performed a small clockwise loop and moved erratically towards the west @-@ southwest during November 25 . After this usage of the name , Sina was retired from the tropical cyclone naming lists .

 Late on November 25 , TCWC Nadi issued a tropical cyclone alert for Fiji , while the system was located about 665 km ( 415 mi ) to the northwest of the country . During the next day , a gale force wind warning was issued for the western half of Viti Levu , the Yasawa and Mamanuca island groups , which was later upgraded to a storm warning while a gale warning was also issued for the rest of Viti Levu . These storm warnings were briefly dropped early on November 27 , when the storm appeared to be moving away from the country , but as Sina came within range of the Nadi radar , it became apparent that southern Fiji would be directly hit by the system . As a result , hurricane warnings were issued for Vatulele , Kadavu and smaller nearby islands , while storm warnings were re @-@ issued for the western half of Viti Levu and the Mamanuca island group . Over the next day as the cyclone approached , hurricane , storm and gale warnings were revised to cover various islands within the Koro and Southern Lau island groups , before all warnings were cancelled on November 28 , as Sina moved away from Fiji . 
 Ahead of Sina affecting the Fijian islands , from November 27 until November 29 , with wind gusts of up to 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) , hundreds of people were evacuated from Fiji 's outer island resorts to hotels on the mainland . As the cyclone affected Fiji high winds and heavy rain forced the closure of several local airports and the Nadi International Airport for around 20 hours . As the cyclone moved towards the east @-@ southeast between November 27 – 28 , it passed near to or over the south @-@ western coast of Viti Levu , Vatulele , <unk> , Northern Kadavu and various islands within the Moala and Southern Lau island groups and caused some coastal erosion . As it moved through the archipelago , the system destroyed or damaged houses and other building structures , while bringing down electric and telephone lines and uprooting trees . The system also severely affected crops and vegetation including sugar cane and pine forests , however the extent of the damage was limited by the fact that many of the crops had already been harvested . 
 On December 7 , the Australian Government via the international development bureau and Air Pacific provided emergency shelter materials , including tarpaulins , plastic sheeting and rope , after an appeal for international assistance was made by the Fijian government . After the cyclone damaged resorts were quickly repaired , while the Fijian government launched an international advertisement campaign for the islands with discounted airfares . Overall Sina caused over $ <unk> million ( $ <unk> million ) worth of damage to the Fijian islands , with most of the damage accounted for by losses to agriculture , sugar cane , and pine forests . After Cyclone Sina had washed away a railway bridge on Vanua Levu that was used to take sugar cane to Labasa 's mills , growers had no choice but to go through the village of Korowiri . However , the workers refused to go into their fields unless they had police protection to go through the village , after Methodists from the local church attacked a group of growers for working on Sundays in defiance of Fiji 's Sunday Observance Decree . As a result , sugar cane that had been damaged by Sina was left rotting in Fiji 's fields until the Fiji Sugar Corporation ordered that a temporary bridge be built to bypass the village .

 Late on November 27 , as Sina affected the Fijian island of Viti Levu , TCWC Nadi issued a tropical cyclone alert for the Tongatapu , Haʻapai and Vavaʻu groups of islands . During the next day the tropical cyclone alert for Vavaʻu was cancelled , while gale and storm force wind warnings were issued for Haʻapai and the Tongatapu islands . The system subsequently moved in between the Tongatapu and Haʻapai groups of islands where sustained windspeeds of up to 96 km / h ( 60 mph ) and wind gusts of up to 139 km / h ( 86 mph ) were recorded at the Nukuʻalofa weather station . Parts of the Tongan capital city Nuku 'alofa were left without power , after electric lines were brought down , while several homes were partially damaged after the roofs lost their iron . Overall only minor damage to weak structures , trees , banana plantations , electric and telephone lines was recorded within the island nation .

 During November 29 , TCWC Nadi issued strong wind warnings for Niue as the island experienced marginal gale force winds from the system , as it passed about 185 km ( 115 mi ) to the south of the island . High seas salt spray and waves caused some damage to crops and the island 's wharf . They also washed away two temporary roads that were installed after Cyclone <unk> had affected the island earlier in the year . 
 Early on November 30 , as the system moved towards the east @-@ southeast , TCWC Nadi issued a gale warning for the Cook Islands of Rarotonga and Mangaia , while issuing strong wind warnings and tropical cyclone alerts for the rest of the Southern Islands . The warnings were subsequently maintained until later that day , as Sina spared the Cook Islands its major effects and re @-@ curved sharply towards the south @-@ southeast . Only minor damage to shallow rooted crops and weak structures was reported , after high seas and gale force winds buffeted the northern side of Rarotonga . 
 = 250t @-@ class torpedo boat = 
 The 250t @-@ class were high @-@ seas torpedo boats built for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy between 1913 and 1916 . A total of 27 boats were built by three shipbuilding companies , with the letter after the boat number indicating the manufacturer . There were small variations between manufacturers , mainly in the steam turbines used , and whether they had one or two funnels . The eight boats of the T @-@ group , designated 74 T – 81 T , were built by Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino , located at Trieste . The sixteen boats of the F @-@ group , designated 82 F – 97 F , were built by Ganz & Danubius at their shipyards at Fiume and Porto Re . The three M @-@ group boats , designated 98 M – 100 M , were manufactured by Cantiere Navale Triestino at Monfalcone . 
 All 27 boats saw service in World War I , performing convoy , escort and minesweeping tasks , and anti @-@ submarine operations . Although widely used during the war , the class suffered no losses , and available sources indicate they were only involved in a few engagements . In 1917 , one of the 66 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) guns on each boat was placed on an anti @-@ aircraft mount . Under the terms of the Treaty of Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ Laye , the boats were transferred to various countries , including seven to Romania , six to Portugal , six to Greece , and eight to the newly created Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( later Yugoslavia ) . By 1940 , thirteen boats of the class had been lost or scrapped , including all six Portuguese boats . 
 During World War II , the five remaining Greek boats were sunk by Axis aircraft during the German @-@ led invasion of Greece in April 1941 . The six surviving Yugoslav boats were captured by the Italians during the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 , and were operated by the Regia Marina . Immediately following the Italian capitulation in September 1943 , one ex @-@ Yugoslav boat was sunk by German aircraft , another was scuttled by its Italian crew , and a third fell into Allied hands . The rest were seized by the Germans . 
 Of the boats taken over by the Germans , two were handed over to the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia , one of which was destroyed by Royal Navy Motor Torpedo Boats in 1944 . The other was transferred to the Yugoslav Navy after World War II and continued to serve until 1959 , when she was taken out of service . Another was operated by the German Navy ( German : Kriegsmarine ) with a Croatian crew until she was sunk by Royal Air Force aircraft in 1945 . The surviving Croatian boat was handed over to the Yugoslav Navy after the war and served until 1962 . The remaining two Romanian boats performed escort tasks in the Black Sea before being taken over by the Soviet Navy , and serving in their Black Sea Fleet until the end of the war ; they were finally stricken in late 1945 .

 In 1910 , the Austria @-@ Hungary Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a 275 @-@ tonne ( 271 @-@ long @-@ ton ) coastal torpedo boat , specifying that it should be capable of sustaining 30 knots ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) for 10 hours . This specification was based on an expectation that the Strait of Otranto , where the Adriatic Sea meets the Ionian Sea , would be blockaded by hostile forces during a future conflict . In such circumstances , there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could sail from the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy base at Cattaro to the Strait during darkness , locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning . Steam turbine power was selected for propulsion , as diesels with the necessary power were not available , and the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run turbo @-@ electric boats . 
 = = Description and construction = = 
 Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino ( STT ) of Trieste was selected for the contract to build eight vessels , ahead of one other tenderer . Despite the specifications of the contract being very close to the requirements for the coastal torpedo boat , the STT boats were classified as sea @-@ going . The STT boats used Parsons turbines driving two propeller shafts . Another tender was requested for four more boats , but when Ganz & Danubius reduced their price by ten percent , a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them . These boats were powered by AEG @-@ Curtiss turbines , and had two funnels rather than the single funnel of the STT boats . The third contract went to Cantiere Navale Triestino ( CNT ) , who used Melms @-@ Pfenniger turbines , and their boats also had two funnels . The boats of all three groups used steam generated by two Yarrow water @-@ tube boilers , one of which burned fuel oil and the other coal . 
 When completed , all 27 boats were armed with two Škoda 66 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) L / 30 guns , and four 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . Each vessel could carry 10 – 12 naval mines . 
 = = = T @-@ group = = = 
 The T @-@ group were built by STT at the Port of Trieste between April 1913 and December 1914 . They had a waterline length of 58 @.@ 2 m ( 190 ft 11 in ) , a beam of 5 @.@ 7 m ( 18 ft 8 in ) , and a normal draught of 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 ft 11 in ) . While their designed displacement was 262 tonnes ( 258 long tons ) , they displaced about 320 tonnes ( 310 long tons ) fully loaded . The crew consisted of 39 officers and enlisted men . Their Parsons turbines were rated at 5 @,@ 000 shp ( 3 @,@ 700 kW ) with a maximum output of 6 @,@ 000 shp ( 4 @,@ 500 kW ) and designed to reach a top speed of 28 knots ( 52 km / h ; 32 mph ) . They carried 18 tonnes ( 17 @.@ 7 long tons ) of coal and 24 tonnes ( 23 @.@ 6 long tons ) of fuel oil , which gave them a range of 980 nmi ( 1 @,@ 810 km ; 1 @,@ 130 mi ) at 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . 
 The T @-@ group boats were originally to be armed with three 66 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) L / 30 guns , and three 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes , but this was changed to two guns and four torpedo tubes before the first boat was completed , in order to standardise the armament with the following F @-@ group . In 1914 , one 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun was added . 
 When 74 T 's turbines were initially installed , the problems with them were so significant that all her power and propulsion machinery had to be rebuilt . She was launched for a second time on 26 June 1914 .

 The F @-@ group were built by Ganz & Danubius at Fiume and nearby Porto Re between October 1913 and December 1916 . They had a waterline length of 58 @.@ 5 m ( 191 ft 11 in ) , a beam of 5 @.@ 8 m ( 19 ft 0 in ) , and a normal draught of 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 ft 11 in ) .

Their AEG @-@ Curtiss turbines were rated at 5 @,@ 000 shp ( 3 @,@ 700 kW ) with a maximum output of 6 @,@ 000 shp ( 4 @,@ 500 kW ) , and the boats were designed to reach a top speed of 28 knots ( 52 km / h ; 32 mph ) . During trials , 93 F produced 6 @,@ 450 shp ( 4 @,@ 810 kW ) , and reached a top speed of 29 @.@ 7 knots ( 55 @.@ 0 km / h ; 34 @.@ 2 mph ) . They carried 20 long tons ( 20 @.@ 3 t ) of coal and 34 long tons ( 34 @.@ 5 t ) of fuel oil , which gave them a range of 1 @,@ 200 nmi ( 2 @,@ 200 km ; 1 @,@ 400 mi ) at 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . 
 When Italy declared war on Austria @-@ Hungary in May 1915 , five incomplete F @-@ group boats were towed to be completed in safety . 82 F , 83 F and 84 F were taken from Porto Re to Pola , and 90 F and 91 F were taken to Novigrad . This resulted in delays to the completion of these boats .

 At the outbreak of World War I , 74 T – 77 T comprised the 1st Torpedo Group of the 3rd Torpedo Craft Division of the Austro @-@ Hungarian 1st Torpedo Craft Flotilla . All 27 boats saw service , performing convoy , escort and minesweeping tasks , and anti @-@ submarine operations . They also conducted patrols and supported seaplane raids against the Italian coast . Due to inadequate funding , the 250t @-@ class were essentially coastal vessels , despite the original intention that they would be used for " high seas " operations . On the morning of 24 May 1915 , 80 T was part of the Bombardment of Ancona , a fleet action that involved the shelling of various targets in the Province of Ancona and 11 other Adriatic ports . At Porto Corsini near Ravenna , an Italian 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) shore battery returned fire , hitting the light cruiser Novara and damaging 80 T. 
 In 1917 , one of the 66 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) guns on each boat was placed on an anti @-@ aircraft mount . In late September 1917 , 98 M was part of a squadron of four destroyers and four torpedo boats supporting an air attack on the Italian airfield at Ferrara by flying boats . After destroying an Italian airship , the squadron withdrew at high speed in the darkness , but was intercepted by an Italian squadron of eight destroyers that had been sent to support an Italian air raid on Pola . In the resultant 45 minute melee , several Austro @-@ Hungarian destroyers were damaged . As the squadron retreated through the minefields off <unk> , 98 M was hit by Italian fire , resulting in one casualty . In June 1918 , 76 T was part of the escort force that failed to protect the Austro @-@ Hungarian dreadnought Szent István from the Italian motor torpedo boats that sank her . During that action , 76 T fired at the Italian vessels , but did not score a hit . 
 Elements of the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet mutinied in Cattaro in February 1918 , and in May , a plot was discovered to take over 80 T at Pola . The motive appeared to be nationalism . Two of the ringleaders , a Czech and a Dalmatian Croat , were tried , convicted and executed by firing squad . In October 1918 , 87 F was at Durazzo in Albania when the port was bombarded by a multinational Allied naval force . She escaped with minor damage , in what was the last major action involving the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy .

 By 1940 , thirteen boats of the class had been lost or scrapped , including all six Portuguese boats . At the time of the Axis Balkan Campaign of April 1941 , the Yugoslav boats T1 and T3 were assigned to the Southern Sector of Coastal Defence Command based at the Bay of Kotor , along with several minesweepers and other craft . T5 – T8 comprised the 3rd Torpedo Division located at Šibenik . On 8 April , the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division , along with other vessels , were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of Zadar on the Dalmatia coast . They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and , after the last one , sailed from the area of Zaton into Lake <unk> , where they remained until 11 April . On 12 April , the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at <unk> on the island of Brač , and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor . All six Yugoslav boats still in service were captured by the Italians during the German @-@ led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia . 
 The five surviving Greek boats were all sunk by aircraft during the German invasion of Greece , also in April 1941 . The first was <unk> , which was sunk off Corfu on 4 April by Italian Junkers Ju 87 " Picchiatello " s of the 239th Squadron , 97th Dive Bomber Group . Later , <unk> was sunk off Athens on 22 April , <unk> at Salamis on 24 April , <unk> off Salamis on 25 April , and <unk> south of the Peloponnese peninsula on the following day , all by German aircraft . 
 The three Romanian boats were initially deployed against the Soviet Navy Black Sea Fleet following the launch of Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 , with Naluca and <unk> allocated to the 3rd Section of the Romanian Navy . On 9 July 1941 , Naluca , along with a gunboat and three Motor Torpedo Boats ( MTBs ) , sank the Soviet submarine SC @-@ 206 off the southern Romanian coast near Mangalia . Between 7 – 16 October 1941 , all three Romanian torpedo boats were part of the escort for a minelaying group that laid several minefields along the Bulgarian coast to protect Axis shipping . Naluca was sunk by Soviet aircraft at Constanța on 20 August 1944 , but <unk> and <unk> survived World War II , having been transferred to the Soviet Black Sea Fleet in late August 1944 after Romania changed sides and joined the Allies , serving as Musson and Toros respectively . 
 The Yugoslav boats served with the Royal Italian Navy ( Italian : Regia Marina ) under their Yugoslav designations . T3 and T5 were fitted with two 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) L / 30 anti @-@ aircraft guns in place of their 66 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) guns , but no other significant alterations were made to them . When the Italians capitulated in September 1943 , the Germans seized T1 and transferred her to the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia . She was renamed Golešnica and continued in Croatian service until the end of the war . T3 was seized by the Germans at Rijeka and was renamed TA48 . During her time in German service she was crewed exclusively by Croatian officers and sailors , and her complement was increased to 52 . The Germans fitted her with two single 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) anti @-@ aircraft guns . She was sunk in the port of Trieste by the Royal Air Force on 20 February 1945 . 
 T5 was returned to the Royal Yugoslav Navy ( in exile ) in December 1943 . T6 was scuttled by the Italians at Rimini on 11 September to avoid her falling into German hands . Once under German control , T7 was also handed over to the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia , and served under her Yugoslav designation . Her crew came under the influence of the Yugoslav Partisans , and were preparing to mutiny when the Germans intervened . She was sunk by Royal Navy MTBs off <unk> Island on 25 June 1944 . T8 was sunk by German aircraft while under Italian control on 10 September 1943 .

 = Tropical Storm Linfa ( 2009 ) = 
 Severe Tropical Storm Linfa was the second named storm to develop in the South China Sea during the 2009 Pacific typhoon season . It is the seventh depression and third typhoon of the season . Forming out of an area of low pressure on June 14 , the storm briefly attained tropical depression status before degenerating . By June 17 the system regenerated in the South China Sea . Slowly tracking northward , the storm intensified , attaining severe tropical storm status on June 19 and peaking in intensity the following day . On June 21 , Linfa made landfall in Fujian Province , China as a tropical storm before weakening to a tropical depression . 
 In Taiwan , outer bands of the storm produced significant amounts of rain over southeastern areas of the island . Along the western coast , rip currents resulted in the drowning of one person . Six hikers also were reported to be missing . In China , torrential rains triggered flooding that destroyed 100 homes , killed one person and left six others missing . In all , seven people were killed by Linfa , with damages in mainland China estimated at ¥ 641 million ( US $ 93 @.@ 8 million ) and agricultural losses in Taiwan reached NT $ 400 million ( US $ 12 @.@ 1 million ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On June 10 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) began monitoring a persistent area of convection situated about 140 kilometres ( 85 mi ) southeast of Palau . Satellite imagery depicted an elongated low @-@ level circulation with deep convection centered along the southwestern portion of the system . Strong wind shear , which normally inhibits cyclonic development , provided energy for further convective development around the system . Tracking in a general northwestward direction , the low gradually developed northward outflow due to a tropical upper tropospheric trough ( TUTT ) located north of the disturbance . Following further development , the Japan Meteorological Agency declared the system as a tropical depression at 0600 UTC on June 14 . 
 Later on June 14 , the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert ( TCFA ) for the depression . Deep convection consolidated around the center of circulation and convective banding features developed along the periphery of the system . Several hours later , the TCFA was canceled as the system rapidly degenerated , with convection mostly dissipating and an exposed low . Outflow significantly deteriorated as the system detached itself from the TUTT . By this time , the JMA had ceased advisories on the depression . Two days later , after tracking across Luzon , the system began to regenerate . Convection redeveloped around the low and outflow was reestablished to the south . 
 Early on June 17 , the JTWC issued a second TCFA as the system continued to organize . By this time the system was nearly stationary and at 0600 UTC , the JMA declared that the low had developed into a tropical depression . Several hours later , the JTWC designated the system as Tropical Depression 03W while the storm was situated about 705 km ( 440 mi ) south @-@ southwest of Kaohsiung , Taiwan . Little movement took place for the first few days of the storm 's existence as weak steering currents were in place over the South China Sea . Following further development of the depression , the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm late on June 17 . At 0600 UTC on June 18 , the JMA classified the system as a tropical storm and gave it the name Linfa . Limited poleward outflow hindered intensification for the remainder of June 18 . By this time , the storm began to increase in forward motion due to a strengthening subtropical ridge located east of Taiwan and a mid @-@ latitude trough to the west . 
 Around 1200 UTC the following day , Linfa further intensified into a severe tropical storm . A microwave satellite image of the storm depicted an eye @-@ feature surrounded by deep convection . Interacting with a nearby upper @-@ level low , poleward outflow significantly improved late on June 19 , fueling further strengthening . Slowly tracking in a general northward direction , Linfa continued to organize and by June 20 , the JTWC upgraded Linfa to a typhoon . A small , ragged eye appeared on visible satellite images by this time and several hours later , the storm reached its peak intensity just below typhoon @-@ status according to the JMA . Maximum sustained winds peaked at 110 km / h ( 70 mph 10 @-@ minute winds ) and a barometric pressure of 975 hPa ( mbar ) . 
 Later on June 20 , convection near the center of circulation began to decrease – an indication of weakening – and the eye was no longer visible . Upper @-@ level wind shear rapidly increased to 55 km / h ( 35 mph ) , preventing re @-@ intensification of the cyclone . Taking a more northward track than anticipated , Linfa began to interact with land and was downgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC on June 21 . Around 1230 UTC , the storm made landfall in southern Fujian as a tropical storm with winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph 10 @-@ minute winds ) . Deep convection rapidly dissipated shortly thereafter due to interaction with land . Several hours later , the JTWC downgraded Linfa to a tropical depression . The following day , the JMA also downgraded Linfa to a tropical depression as the storm moved away from the Chinese coastline . The system later dissipated just offshore ; a circulation was no longer evident on satellite imagery . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Although Linfa was not forecast to directly impact the Philippines , the outer effects of the storm were anticipated to produce increased rainfall and large swells along western facing coastlines . By June 20 , the Central Weather Bureau issued extremely heavy rain warnings , indicating 24 @-@ hour rainfall totals in excess of 130 mm ( 5 @.@ 1 in ) were anticipated , for most of Taiwan . Beaches throughout Taiwan were closed due to rough seas and local officials inspected all public shelters to ensure they were stocked and prepared to provide for evacuees . Later that day , a level 3 emergency was declared for eastern Guangdong Province and southern Fujian Province . The local governments in the provinces enacted their emergency response plans following this declaration . 
 On June 21 , officials in China closed Xiamen port and stated that it would resume operations once the storm passed . Later that day 33 @,@ 000 vessels sought refuge at port . Following the issuance of a land warning , government offices and schools were closed throughout the island . Officials sent 10 million text messages to residents throughout Fujian Province to warn them about the approaching storm . In Hong Kong , public warning signal number one was raised for nearly 24 hours as Linfa briefly threatened the city on June 20 . Officials also evacuated roughly 160 @,@ 000 people from coastal areas in Fujian . A total of 167 flights to and from Taiwan were canceled or delayed due to the storm . 
 On June 21 , large swells of up to 5 @.@ 6 m ( 18 ft ) caused a 498 @-@ tonne oil tanker , the Colombo Queen , to run aground in southern Taiwan . Rescue crews were unable to reach the ship as it was still in the storm . Although no fuel was reported to have leaked , the ship struck a coral reef , damaging the coral . Once Linfa passed , rescuers were able to reach the nine crew members on the ship . Officials estimated that it would take over a week to remove all 39 @,@ 000 litres ( 8 @,@ 600 imp gal ; 10 @,@ 000 US gal ) of fuel from the tanker . In Taiwan , two people were hit by fallen trees and two monks were struck by a wall that collapsed during a ceremony . Rip currents in Taiwan resulted in one death after a boy went into the water <unk> . Six hikers also went missing . Power to all 505 residences of <unk> was also lost during the storm . Average amounts of 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) of rain were recorded across southeastern parts of Taiwan on June 21 . The highest total was 350 mm ( 14 in ) in Taitung . Further rainfall of 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) fell on June 22 , pushing totals over 450 mm ( 18 in ) in isolated areas along southeastern areas . In Kinmen County , 50 trees were downed , six billboards were destroyed and two homes lost their roofs . By June 22 , power companies reported that 2 @,@ 834 residents had lost power in <unk> Township for several hours . Severe damage was reported in the agricultural sector in Taiwan , leaving NT $ 400 million ( US $ 12 @.@ 1 million ) in losses . 
 In mainland China , Linfa produced torrential rains , peaking at 488 @.@ 1 mm ( 19 @.@ 22 in ) and triggering severe flooding . Heavy rains also impacted Hong Kong , where more than 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) fell over a three @-@ day span . Following a landslide , one person was killed . Flood waters destroyed 100 homes and inundated 10 @,@ 000 others as well as an estimated 32 @,@ 000 hectares of farmland in Fujian Province . In Taoyuan Town , a total of 191 mm ( 7 @.@ 5 in ) of rain fell within one hour , breaking a 200 @-@ year @-@ old record in the town . In <unk> , <unk> Province , flash flooding resulted in five additional fatalities after 413 @.@ 7 mm ( 16 @.@ 29 in ) of rain fell within a nine @-@ hour span . This rainfall was higher than any recorded amount in the past 100 years in the region . A total of 362 homes were destroyed in the town and infrastructure was severely damaged . Additionally , an estimated 20 million people were affected by the storm . Damages from Linfa in China amounted to ¥ 641 million ( $ 93 @.@ 8 million ) . 
 = Operation Bertram = 
 Operation Bertram was a major Second World War deception operation practised by the allied forces in Egypt led by Bernard Montgomery in the months leading up to the Second Battle of El Alamein in 1942 . Bertram was devised by Dudley Clarke to deceive Erwin Rommel about the timing and location of the allied attack . The operation consisted of physical deceptions using dummies and camouflage , designed and made by the British Middle East Command Camouflage Directorate led by Geoffrey Barkas . These were accompanied by electromagnetic deceptions codenamed " Operation Canwell " using false radio traffic . All of these were planned to make the enemy believe that the attack would take place to the south , far from the coast road and railway , and about two days later than the real attack . 
 Bertram consisted both in creating the appearance of army units where none existed , and in concealing armour , artillery and materiel . Dummy tanks and guns were made mainly of local materials including calico and palm @-@ frond hurdles . Real tanks were disguised as trucks , using light " Sunshield " canopies . Field guns and their limbers were also disguised as trucks , their real wheels visible , under a simple box @-@ shaped " Cannibal " canopy to give the shape of a truck . Petrol cans were stacked along the sides of existing revetted trenches , hidden in the shadows . Food was stacked in piles of boxes , and draped with camouflage nets , to resemble trucks . 
 To achieve the deception , trucks were parked openly in the tank assembly area for some weeks . Real tanks were similarly parked openly , far behind the front . Two nights before the attack , the tanks replaced the trucks , being covered with " Sunshields " before dawn . The tanks were replaced that same night with dummies in their original positions , so the armour remained seemingly two or more days ' journey behind the front line . To reinforce the impression that the attack was not ready , a dummy water pipeline was constructed , at an apparent rate of 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) per day . Some days ' worth remained to be built at the time of the actual attack . Dummy tanks , guns and supplies were constructed to the south . 
 After the battle , the captured German <unk> general Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma told Montgomery that he had believed the Allies had at least one more armoured division than they did , and that the attack would be in the south . Rommel 's stand @-@ in , general Georg Stumme , thought the attack would not begin for several weeks . Bertram had thus succeeded in all its objectives . Announcing the victory at El Alamein in the House of Commons , Winston Churchill praised the camouflage operation . 
 = = Planning = = 
 Bertram was devised by Dudley Clarke to deceive Erwin Rommel about the timing and location of the expected allied attack by the Eighth Army . It consisted of physical deceptions using dummies and camouflage , concealing real movements , in particular of Montgomery 's armour . Bertram was accompanied by electromagnetic deceptions codenamed " Operation Canwell " using false radio traffic . The front line was relatively short : it stretched from the Mediterranean Sea in the north , near El Alamein railway station , to the effectively impassable Qattara Depression in the south , a distance of only about 30 miles . It was therefore clear to the enemy that the attack must come in this space , and since the only road was in the north , surprise and full @-@ scale attack in any other location might have been thought unlikely . The deceptions were planned to make the enemy believe that the attack would take place to the south , far from the coast road and railway , and about two days later than the real attack . 
 Soon after his arrival on 8 August 1942 , the new Middle East commander , Harold Alexander , visited Geoffrey Barkas 's camouflage unit at Helwan to assess its ability to implement Bertram . He looked at everything intently , but seemed most interested in the woodworking shop . 
 On 16 September 1942 , Freddie de Guingand , Montgomery 's chief of staff , summoned Barkas and Tony Ayrton to Eighth Army headquarters near Borg @-@ el @-@ Arab . He told them this was to be top secret , that Alexander had been impressed by his visit to Helwan , and that he wanted Camouflage 's advice . He introduced Charles Richardson , who worked for Dudley Clarke 's secretive ' A ' Force and was to implement the deception Montgomery needed . Richardson had not been trained in deception planning , given the accelerated training of staff officers in 1940 , nor had he ever prepared a deception plan before . He was determined it should succeed , since , as he wrote , " if it failed it would do far more damage than having no plan at all " . de Guingand outlined the basic plan : an attack in the north , along the line of the coast road , with a feint some 20 miles to the south . The tanks would take two days to move into battle position from their forming @-@ up positions . Engineering work was already under way . He then astonished them by asking them to hide the hundreds of tanks and field guns , and the thousands of tons of materiel , that were to be used for the decisive attack at El Alamein . Barkas had been hoping for such an opportunity , and now he was being offered the chance to camouflage perhaps the largest desert battle ever attempted . 
 Barkas and Ayrton went out onto the beach dunes to sit and think . Barkas recalled the sacked Jasper Maskelyne , a stage magician who had briefly worked for him , saying he needed his vanishing tricks now . Ayrton agreed , suggesting they use Sunshields to make the tanks seem to be trucks , and vice versa . By the end of that afternoon they had typed up a plan and presented it to de Guingand and Richardson . They proposed to create two dummy armoured brigades to deploy in the south . They would give the appearance of not being ready by making it seem the tanks had not moved from their forming @-@ up areas ( Murrayfield and Melting Pot ) . Dummy tanks would replace them there ; while they would mimic trucks when they arrived in the forward Martello area . 
 Richardson asked if they could use something like Steven Sykes 's dummy railhead which had worked so well at <unk> . Barkas answered that he intended to build a dummy water pipeline to go down south , and to be obviously not ready . 
 Within two weeks Barkas 's plan was accepted , but with one change requested by Montgomery : the dummy armour was doubled to represent a whole armoured corps of over 600 vehicles . Richardson integrated the camouflage plan with the main plans : in Barkas 's words , Richardson " amplified it a great deal to fit in with all the other major considerations , which he knew and I didn 't . " 
 Barkas , a former film director , was set to work " on the task of providing props for the biggest ' film production ' on which I ever expect to be engaged " . Work began on 27 September , giving 4 weeks before the day of the attack . 
 = = Execution = = 
 The operation had two aims ; creating the appearance of army units where none existed and concealing the real armour , artillery and materiel at the front . Barkas observed that " the concealment of the huge assembly of the Armoured Corps was essentially a piece of military planning by Army Headquarters , with Camouflage carrying out certain specific tasks . " Since it would be impossible to hide the existence of such a large number of vehicles , and especially of tanks in the Martello area , Barkas planned instead to make the vehicles there quite obvious , as trucks , well before battle . The tanks , too , would be openly displayed , far behind the battle front . When the enemy saw that nothing seemed to be happening , the trucks would be replaced by tanks , masquerading as trucks . That meant that the tanks , too , would have to be seen not to move , so they would all be replaced with dummies . An unprecedented and " formidable " number of dummies were required : more than 400 tanks , 100 guns , and nearly 2000 soft @-@ skinned vehicles . 
 Different techniques were used for each of these tasks . The British Army had intentionally recruited designers , architects and artists for camouflage work . Tony Ayrton was a painter , son of the architect Maxwell Ayrton . Brian Robb had arrived more informally : he joined the army as a private , but Barkas noticed him and made use of his skills as an artist , teacher and illustrator by having him speedily promoted to Staff Lieutenant . Ayrton and Robb became Barkas 's " GSO2 " s , his senior staff officers , and they supervised the camouflage schemes used in Operation Bertram . 
 Three companies of Pioneers were assigned to Barkas 's command to carry out the physical work of making the thousands of dummies . They came respectively from East Africa , Mauritius , and the Seychelles . One company worked the standard bed frame palm hurdles into the required shapes and fixed them together to make tank bodies , turrets and other dummy vehicle elements . The second company prepared hessian covers for the vehicle elements . The third company painted and prepared the dummies to the required degree of realism . Since the different Pioneer companies did not like each other , Barkas moved their camps as far apart as possible . To help maintain security , a NAAFI canteen was set up exclusively for the camouflage workers to help keep everyone in camp . 
 = = = " Sunshields " for tanks = = = 
 Real tanks were disguised as trucks , using light " Sunshield " canopies . They were made in two halves , which hinged on the sides of the tank . A half could be lifted by two men , and fitted or removed in a few minutes . Different models of Sunshield existed to fit the various types of Allied tank which included Crusaders , Valentines , Grants and Shermans , mimicking different kinds of truck . 
 A total of 722 Sunshields were deployed in Bertram . According to Peter Forbes , " Sunshields were the most successful and the most exhilaratingly mimetic of the deceptions practised in the desert . " 
 The idea for the Sunshield came from Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief Middle East , General Wavell himself . He sketched a tank mimicking a truck in a handwritten note which reads 
 Is it a wild idea that a tank could be camouflaged to look like a lorry from air by light canvas Screen over top ( sketch ) It might would be useful during approach march etc . Please have it considered . 23 / 4 Wavell 
 The note was passed to Barkas , in his words " not long after my arrival in Middle East ... The whole idea was there . It was only a matter of design , development , and arrangements for manufacture . " The first heavy wooden prototype was made in 1941 by Jasper Maskelyne , who gave it the name Sunshield . 12 men were needed to lift it , and it disintegrated on its first trial run on a Crusader tank . However , Barkas had enough confidence in the Sunshield to ask for a lighter version . The Mark 2 Sunshield was made of canvas stretched over a light steel tube frame . It was strong , light , and cheap to manufacture . And crucially , from as low as 500 feet , RAF pilots found that the Mark 2 convincingly resembled a truck . 
 The 722 Sunshields were carefully pre @-@ positioned in the Martello tank @-@ holding area near El <unk> railway station . Each was numbered . The crew of each tank was brought to Martello , told their number , shown where they would be parked , and taught how to put up and take down the Sunshield , which they would have to do at night . 
 = = = " Cannibals " for field guns = = = 
 Field guns and their limbers were disguised as British " 3 @-@ <unk> " trucks , under the direction of Tony Ayrton and Brian Robb . They arranged for the long towing pole of the limber to overlap the trail of the gun , and then put up a dummy truck canopy over both . The real wheels of both the gun and the limber added to the realism of the dummy truck , as they remained visible under the canopy , exactly where the truck 's wheels ought to be . The technique was named " Cannibal " because the gun and limber were ' eaten up ' by the canopy . 
 The extremely distinctive Morris C8 four wheel drive tractors , known as " Quads " that pulled the 25 pounder guns and their limbers also had to be disguised , since their presence directly advertised the presence of artillery . They were more simply camouflaged , again as trucks with real wheels , by draping a net over four poles tied to the sides of the vehicle and braced with guy ropes . 
 A total of 360 Cannibals were deployed in Bertram . The rear artillery concentration area and the forward artillery barrage area near El Alamein station were named Cannibal I and Cannibal II , respectively , after the camouflage technique . In Barkas 's own words 
 the great concentration of 25 @-@ pounders ... seems to have been quite undetectable right up to the instant when its disguise was thrown off and the gunners opened fire . 
 = = = Real and dummy materiel = = = 
 Petrol cans were stacked along the sides of existing revetted trenches near El Alamein railway station . It was found by experiment that when they were hidden in the shadows in this way , they were invisible from the air . 2000 tons of petrol were stored in this way . Over 100 @,@ 000 4 @-@ gallon petrol tins were stacked in the 100 stone @-@ faced slit trenches . 
 Food was stacked in piles of boxes , and draped with camouflage nets to resemble trucks : a large box @-@ shaped pile for the truck 's body , and smaller piles for the truck 's cab and engine . This meant that attractive materials including sugar and cigarettes were dispersed around the desert instead of being in readily guarded camps . The most desirable items were therefore put in the " trucks " in the middle of the areas and hidden in the middle of each stack , and army command accepted the risk of theft . 
 While the real supplies in the north were carefully hidden , matching dummy supplies had to be created in the south . In the area named Brian after camouflage officer Brian Robb , over 700 dummy stacks representing food , petrol , ammunition and other supplies were constructed . 
 Static dummy tanks and guns were made mainly of local materials including calico and palm @-@ frond hurdles . Some dummy tanks were mobile , consisting of light frames placed over jeeps . A total of 500 dummy tanks and 150 dummy guns were constructed . 
 One night shortly before the battle , a powerful dust storm destroyed many of the dummy vehicles . Ayrton worked throughout that night and all the following day to restore the " film set " to an appearance of reality . The Axis command did not notice the breakdown of the illusion . The Royal Air Force had established air superiority by 18 October and completely excluded German reconnaissance aircraft from the Bertram area from then until battle commenced . 
 = = = Double bluff = = = 
 On the edge of the Munassib Depression , Bertram risked a double bluff . From 15 October 1942 , a week before the attack , Camouflage constructed three and a half dummy field regiments of artillery . These were carefully made to appear seriously camouflaged , but day by day they were maintained less and less well , to allow the enemy to decide it was facing dummy guns at Munassib . When the real battle had begun , the dummies were replaced at night with real artillery , which then kept utterly still for a day . An Axis tank attack on Munassib was shocked to find itself being fired on by the massed ' dummy ' guns .

 To achieve the deception , trucks were parked openly in the tank assembly area for some weeks . Real tanks were similarly parked openly , far behind the front . 2 nights before the attack , the tanks replaced the trucks , being covered with " Sunshields " before dawn . The tanks were replaced that same night with dummies in their original positions , so the armour remained seemingly 2 or more days ' journey behind the front line . 
 To reinforce the impression that the attack was not ready , a dummy water pipeline was constructed in " Operation Diamond " , at an apparent rate of 5 miles per day . Two of Barkas 's camouflage officers , Phillip Cornish and Sidney Robinson , supervised the work . Some days ' worth remained to be built at the time of the actual attack . The pipeline was supported by dummy pump @-@ houses , overhead tanks and filling stations , complete with straw men . Real traffic was made to drive nearby to create tracks .

 After the battle , the captured German <unk> general Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma told Montgomery that he had believed the allies had at least one more armoured division than they did , and that the attack would be in the south .

German documents and prisoners of war confirmed that the German commanders had believed in the existence of the decoy unit , and had not anticipated the true avenue of attack . Bertram had succeeded in all its objectives . 
 On 11 November 1942 , Winston Churchill announced victory at El Alamein in the House of Commons , London and praised the success of Operation Bertram : 
 By a marvellous system of camouflage , complete tactical surprise was achieved in the desert . The Xth Corps , which he had seen from the air exercising fifty miles in the rear , moved silently away in the night , but leaving an exact simulacrum of its tanks where it had been , and proceeded to its points of attack . 
 = Lionel Palairet = 
 Lionel Charles Hamilton Palairet ( 27 May 1870 – 27 March 1933 ) was an English amateur cricketer who played for Somerset and Oxford University . A graceful right @-@ handed batsman , he was selected to play Test cricket for England twice in 1902 . Contemporaries judged Palairet to have one of the most attractive batting styles of the period . His obituary in The Times described him as " the most beautiful batsman of all time " . An unwillingness to tour during the English winter limited Palairet 's Test appearances ; contemporaries believed he deserved more Test caps . 
 Palairet was educated at Repton School . He played in the school cricket team for four years , as captain in the latter two , before going to Oriel College , Oxford . He achieved his cricketing Blue in each of his four years at Oxford , and captained the side in 1892 and 1893 . For Somerset , he frequently opened the batting with Herbie Hewett . In 1892 , they shared a partnership of 346 for the first wicket , an opening stand that set a record for the County Championship and remains Somerset 's highest first @-@ wicket partnership . In that season , Palairet was named as one of the " Five Batsmen of the Year " by Wisden . 
 Over the following decade , he was one of the leading amateur batsmen in England . He passed 1 @,@ 000 first @-@ class runs in a season on seven occasions , and struck two double centuries . His highest score , 292 runs against Hampshire in 1895 , remained a record for a Somerset batsman until 1948 . His only Test matches were the fourth and fifth Tests against Australia in 1902 : Australia won the fourth Test by three runs , and England won the fifth Test by one wicket . After 1904 , he appeared infrequently for Somerset , though he played a full season in 1907 when he was chosen to captain the county . He retired from first @-@ class cricket in 1909 , having scored over 15 @,@ 000 runs . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Lionel Palairet was born in Grange @-@ over @-@ Sands , a popular seaside resort in Lancashire , on 27 May 1870 . He was the oldest of five children born to Henry Hamilton Palairet and Elizabeth Anne Bigg . His father , of Huguenot ancestry , was five times archery champion of England , and a keen cricketer who made two first @-@ class appearances for the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) in the late 1860s . Palairet was educated first at the Reverend S. Cornish 's School in Clevedon , Somerset , where he once took seven wickets in seven successive deliveries , and then at Repton School . At Repton he developed a reputation as an all @-@ round sportsman : he broke the school 's running records in the two @-@ mile , mile and half @-@ mile distances , and played cricket in the school 's first eleven from 1886 to 1889 , captaining the team in his final two years . In 1889 , he was adjudged the school 's second best sportsman , behind only C. B. Fry . During his final year at Repton , he had a batting average of over 29 , and took 56 wickets at an average of under 13 . 
 Some of Palairet 's early success can be attributed to his father , who paid the professionals Frederick Martin and William Attewell , both later Wisden Cricketers of the Year , to bowl at his two sons during the Easter holidays , to help them prepare for the upcoming cricket season . During the later part of the 1889 season , Palairet made his first appearances for Somerset County Cricket Club . At the time , Somerset were a second @-@ class county , and their fixture list that summer was against a variety of first- and second @-@ class opposition . Although a Lancastrian by birth , Palairet 's family home was at <unk> in Dorset , and it was in the south west that he chose to play his cricket . On completion of his studies at Repton , he attended Oriel College , Oxford .

 Palairet was selected for the university cricket team during his first year at Oxford , and made his first @-@ class debut against the touring Australians in May 1890 . Palairet scored six and nought and took one wicket in the match which Australia won by an innings . In his next match , Palairet improved , top @-@ scoring for Oxford in their first innings against the Gentlemen with his first half @-@ century in first @-@ class cricket , 54 runs batting at number eight . He only passed 50 runs in one other innings for Oxford that summer , a score of 72 against the MCC , and in all matches for the university that season scored 285 runs at an average of 19 @.@ 00 . Batting averages in 1890 were lower than usual due to the poor weather , and Palairet 's average placed him fourth among Oxford 's team ; his 285 @-@ run total was the team 's second highest aggregate . Palairet won his Blue — the awarding of the Oxford " colours " to sportsmen — by appearing in the 1890 University match against Cambridge , a game in which he had little success . Somerset played thirteen matches in the season , won twelve of them and tied the other . Palairet played in ten of these games , and on his first appearance scored a century against Leicestershire . Somerset 's achievements led to their admission to first @-@ class cricket for 1891 . 
 Oxford 's batting was described by the Oxford cricket historian Geoffrey Bolton as " unreliable " during 1891 , Palairet 's second year at the university . Palairet 's batting average of 15 @.@ 78 placed him fifth amongst his peers , and he once again struggled in the University match , scoring two and eleven . Although he generally batted as part of the middle order for Oxford , he invariably opened the innings for Somerset alongside his captain , Herbie Hewett . In this role he thrived for Somerset ; his average for the county in ten matches was 31 @.@ 11 , placing him among the top ten batsmen in the County Championship . He scored his debut century in first @-@ class cricket that year , with 100 runs against Gloucestershire . Palairet had agreed to tour North America with Lord Hawke 's party , but he demurred late , and was replaced by Somerset team @-@ mate Sammy Woods . 
 In 1892 Palairet was elected captain of the Oxford team , and according to Wisden , " had a most brilliant season . " Palairet used himself heavily as a bowler for the university ; only George Berkeley bowled more deliveries . He took five wickets in an innings for the first of two occasions during his career in the first innings of Oxford 's match against the Gentlemen , and followed it up with four wickets in each innings against Lancashire , a match in which he also scored a half @-@ century . He recorded the best bowling figures of his first @-@ class career in the return match against Lancashire , taking six wickets for 84 runs at Old Trafford , and in the following game against Sussex , Bolton says , " Palairet played two beautiful innings and bowled to some effect " . Facing Cambridge in the University match , he was out without scoring in the first innings , but centuries from Malcolm Jardine and Vernon Hill took Oxford to 365 . Cambridge were dismissed for 160 , and were forced to follow on , whereupon they reached 388 , leaving Oxford requiring 184 runs to win . Palairet , who had injured himself while fielding , opted not to open the batting , promoting Frank Phillips in his place . Oxford started poorly , falling to 17 for two , but coming in at number five , Palairet batted for an hour and a half to score 71 runs and help his side to victory . He topped the batting averages for Oxford in 1892 , scoring 509 runs at 36 @.@ 35 , and his 28 wickets came at 22 @.@ 28 . 
 Palairet 's university performances were good enough to earn him selection for the Gentlemen against the Players in the prestigious matches at Lord 's and The Oval . Returning to Somerset , he struck a century against Gloucestershire in early July , In late August , playing Yorkshire , Palairet scored 132 out of a partnership of 346 with Hewett , establishing a record for the first wicket in first @-@ class cricket , surpassing W. G. Grace and Bransby Cooper 's 1869 total of 283 . Although their record has since been beaten in first @-@ class cricket , it remains Somerset 's record partnership for the first wicket . Their partnership was described as " Pure grace at one end , sheer force at the other " , in H.S. Altham and E. W. Swanton 's A History of Cricket . At the time , The Daily Telegraph reported that the pair remained together for three and a half hours , during which Palairet scored one six and nineteen fours . At the end of the season , he was selected in two representative sides : appearing for the West against the East , and once again for the Gentlemen against the Players , on this occasion at Hastings . In all first @-@ class matches that year , he scored 1 @,@ 343 runs , the third most of any cricketer . He was named as one of the Five Batsmen of the Year by the Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack in 1893 , which noted that " there can be little doubt that even greater distinction awaits him in the cricket world . " 
 In contrast to the previous year , 1893 was an unsuccessful one for Oxford . The university side failed to win a single match , and despite favourable batting conditions , none of the batsmen scored a century . Palairet was second in the batting averages , scoring 276 runs at 21 @.@ 23 . Bolton questioned the team selections that year under Palairet 's captaincy , particularly for the University match , in which he believed a stronger team could have been chosen . Cambridge had a powerful team , containing eight of their players from the previous year , and adding Arthur Jones and K. S. Ranjitsinhji . Oxford lost the match by 266 runs , with only Palairet and Fry scoring more than 12 runs for the side . 
 In his four years at Oxford , Palairet appeared for the university 31 times in first @-@ class cricket and accrued 1 @,@ 291 runs at an average of 23 @.@ 05 . He scored nine half @-@ centuries , with a top @-@ score of 75 not out . He claimed 52 wickets at 25 @.@ 03 — significantly lower than his career average — and took the only five @-@ wicket hauls of his career . While at Oxford , he also gained a Blue in athletics , running in the three @-@ mile race against Cambridge in 1892 . The same year , he played association football for Corinthians , and there were also appearances for Combined Universities and London . An injury prevented Palairet from playing against Cambridge , and thus earning his Blue in football . 
 = = = Leading amateur batsman = = = 
 Over the following seasons , Palairet moved to " the front rank of amateur batsmen , " according to W. G. Grace . He played for Arthur Shrewsbury 's England XI against Australia in 1893 , and scored 71 runs as the English side won by an innings and 153 runs . He scored five half @-@ centuries for Somerset that summer , and his batting average of 28 @.@ 94 in the County Championship was bettered only by Hewett among his team @-@ mates . The next year , Palairet made a big score against his former university . Facing a team that included his brother , Richard Palairet , and was captained by Fry , he made 181 runs in Somerset 's second innings , the highest first @-@ class score of his career to that point . He also scored a century against Nottinghamshire , making 119 runs before being out leg before wicket to his old trainer Attewell . He fell just short of 1 @,@ 000 first @-@ class runs in 1894 ; though two half @-@ centuries scored against the touring South Africans in matches not considered first @-@ class would have taken him over the milestone . 
 In 1895 , Palairet was fourth in the national batting averages , having scored 1 @,@ 313 runs at 46 @.@ 89 . The three batsmen above him , Archie MacLaren , Grace and Ranjitsinhji all appeared for England that year . Palairet scored three centuries during the season ; two against Middlesex , on the latter occasion batting undefeated through the whole Somerset innings , and one against Yorkshire , when he struck 165 . He passed a thousand runs again the following year , maintaining a batting average in excess of 40 . A fourth @-@ innings score of 83 not out that season drew praise from Ranjitsinhji ; on a difficult pitch , Palairet farmed the strike and rescued a draw for his side . Just over a month later , he reached his highest total in first @-@ class cricket , scoring 292 runs against Hampshire . It was his first double century , and the highest score by any Somerset batsman in first @-@ class cricket at that time . One newspaper in Australia , reporting on his innings , declared that ; " should he retain his form he will certainly be worthy of a place ... in the final Test match at the Oval . " Either side of that match against Hampshire , he appeared for the Gentlemen against the Players at The Oval and Lord 's , but made little impact on either game . He returned to form against Sussex on their visit to Taunton , sharing a 249 @-@ run partnership with his brother , and scoring 154 runs himself . The match was played shortly before the final Test match against Australia , but despite the comments in the Australian press , Palairet was not selected for the match . He did appear twice against the tourists that summer , for Somerset he scored six across two innings , and chosen to play for Charles Thornton 's XI during the Scarborough Festival , he scored 71 runs in an innings victory . 
 In 1897 Palairet made fewer first @-@ class appearances , playing in only 12 matches . He scored 593 runs at an average just below 30 , the only time between 1895 and 1906 that his average was below that value . Despite this relatively quiet season , Somerset still relied heavily on him ; he led the county batting averages in the 1897 County Championship . In 1898 , Palairet topped 1 @,@ 000 first @-@ class runs for the third season out of four . He struck 179 not out against Gloucestershire in Bristol , and late in the season , also against Gloucestershire , he captained Somerset for the first time , leading them to victory by an innings and 169 runs . He played in two matches during the Scarborough Festival , in which he scored 54 , his highest innings for the Gentlemen against the Players , and also appeared for Thornton 's " England XI " against that season 's county champions , Yorkshire . 
 Palairet missed all of the 1899 season through appendicitis ; Baily 's Magazine of Sports and Pastimes suggested that but for this he might have appeared for England against Australia that summer . He returned in 1900 , scoring 947 runs at an average of 35 @.@ 07 . His only century came against Hampshire , when he scored 161 runs , and shared a partnership of 262 with Charles Bernard . 
 The subsequent 1901 season was , statistically , his best . He trailed only Fry and Ranjitsinhji in the national batting averages , and drew particular acclaim for his innings of 173 against Yorkshire . The all @-@ conquering Yorkshire were reigning County Champions , unbeaten in 1900 ; the match against Somerset at Headingley was the only one they lost in 1901 . Somerset were dismissed for 87 in their first innings , and Yorkshire reached 325 to lead by 238 runs on first innings . Palairet and his fellow opener Len Braund — both of whom had been out without scoring in the first innings — then scored 222 runs together in 140 minutes at the start of Somerset 's second innings , each scoring a century . After the dismissal of Braund for 107 , Palairet continued , eventually being caught and bowled for 173 . Frank Phillips added a third century ( 122 ) , and Somerset reached a total of 630 . Yorkshire were bowled out on a wearing pitch for 113 , with Braund and Beaumont Cranfield each taking four wickets , and Somerset won by 279 runs . The Yorkshire captain , Lord Hawke , declared that it was " one of the best matches I ever lost . " In the same year , Palairet scored 182 against Lancashire and 194 against Sussex . Altogether he scored five centuries and eleven half @-@ centuries in 1901 , averaging 57 @.@ 75 for his 1 @,@ 906 runs — the highest season 's total of his career . 
 = = = England recognition = = = 
 The English summer of 1902 was badly affected by rain , making batting more difficult . Through the whole season , Palairet did not score a first @-@ class century , though he did score over 1 @,@ 000 runs . He was once again instrumental in inflicting defeat on Yorkshire : on what Sir Home Gordon described as a " rain @-@ ruined wicket " , Palairet scored 25 and 24 during a match in which only Braund also reached double @-@ figure scores in both innings . Wisden described the pair 's batting as " admirable " , and it helped secure a Somerset victory by 34 runs ; for the second successive year , Somerset were the only side to beat Yorkshire in the County Championship . 
 Palairet was selected to appear for the Marylebone Cricket Club against the touring Australians in the week prior to the first Test of the series . He scored 39 and 44 in a drawn match . He was not chosen to play in any of the first three Tests , but was called up for the fourth match , at Old Trafford . Palairet , Ranjitsinhji and Fred Tate replaced Fry , George Hirst and Gilbert Jessop ; the Wisden match report indicates that dropping Fry was a necessary decision , but that Hirst and Jessop should both have played . In A History of Cricket , Altham is more direct in claiming that Palairet should not have been chosen : " The selectors , it is now agreed , made a questionable choice in preferring Lionel Palairet to an all @-@ rounder such as Hirst . " On his Test debut , Palairet opened the batting and scored six runs in the first innings , one of five victims to fall to Jack Saunders and Hugh Trumble in the first 45 minutes of England 's innings . In the second innings , Palairet once again opened , though with a different partner : MacLaren replaced Bobby Abel . The pair made scored 44 runs together , though Wisden noted that " the difficulty they experienced in playing the bowling made one apprehensive " . Palairet was bowled by Saunders , and England were eventually dismissed for 120 , four runs short of victory . 
 For the next Test match — the fifth and final of the series — Palairet retained his place , with Hirst and Jessop restored to the side . The Australians batted throughout the first day for a total of 324 runs . Overnight rain then made batting difficult , and England totalled 183 on the second day . Palairet was dismissed for 20 by Trumble , whose bowling Altham praised as magnificent . Australia also struggled in their second innings , and England required 263 runs to win the match . Palairet was dismissed for six , the third batsman to be bowled by Trumble in the innings , at which point England 's score was 10 for 3 wickets . Lower order runs from the recalled Jessop and Hirst recovered the innings , and England won by one wicket . In Palairet 's only other match against Australia that summer , for Somerset , he scored 44 and 90 in a drawn game at Taunton . He made no further Test appearances , and completed his brief Test career with 49 runs at an average of 12 @.@ 25 , against an Australian side that has been described as among the best Test teams prior to the Second World War . 
 = = = Later county career = = = 
 In 1903 , Palairet played eleven first @-@ class matches . His only century of the season came against Surrey , when he scored 114 in the second innings , having struck a half @-@ century in the first . He passed 50 on three other occasions , and finished the year with 637 runs at 35 @.@ 38 . He appeared more frequently the following year , in which he scored 1 @,@ 000 first @-@ class runs in a season for the final time of his career . He opened the season with a century against Gloucestershire , scoring 166 runs . During the Bath cricket festival , he scored 111 , and shared an opening partnership of 161 with Braund during a ten @-@ wicket loss to Lancashire . Against Worcestershire later that month , he scored the second , and final , first @-@ class double century of his career . Opening the batting for Somerset , he reached 203 ; more than Worcestershire had managed in their first innings , before being dismissed . Somerset won the match by an innings and 114 runs . The cricket historian David Foot describes 1904 and the subsequent few seasons as undistinguished for Somerset ; between then and the First World War , the club never finished higher than tenth in the County Championship . Palairet missed most of the cricket in 1905 and 1906 , to concentrate on his work as a land agent for the Earl of Devon . He played three times in 1905 ; against the touring Australians , Kent and Warwickshire , while in 1906 he played one match , against Yorkshire . At the end of 1906 , Woods , who had captained Somerset since 1894 , retired . Despite his limited appearances over the previous couple of years , Palairet was appointed as Woods ' replacement for 1907 . 
 During the 1907 season , Palairet played in all of Somerset 's County Championship matches , and also appeared for the county against the touring South African side . The club struggled to find eleven eligible players for some of their matches , and at one stage were forced to recall Ted Tyler to the side – Tyler had not played for Somerset for four years , and had only played five matches since 1900 . Palairet himself had a disappointing year ; his batting average of 21 @.@ 33 was the lowest in any season in which he played ten or more matches . He passed 50 in an innings on only three occasions , one of these being 116 runs against Kent at Tonbridge , the final century of his first @-@ class career . At the end of the season , in which Somerset finished fourteenth of sixteen teams in the County Championship , Palairet resigned the captaincy . At the club 's annual general meeting , in an uncharacteristic outburst he criticised the lack of talent and team spirit . After 1907 , made only eight further appearances in first @-@ class cricket , his final match being in 1909 for Somerset against Kent at Taunton , where he scored one run in the first innings and three in the second . Palairet invariably wore a Harlequins cricket cap during matches , and was considered aloof by his colleagues . In his complete first @-@ class career he scored 15 @,@ 777 runs at an average of 33 @.@ 63 , including 27 centuries , and took 143 wickets at a bowling average of 33 @.@ 91 
 = = Style and technique = = 
 Often considered by commentators to be the benchmark against which other batsmen are compared for attractive , graceful batting , Palairet won many plaudits for his style . In his book , The Jubilee Book of Cricket , Ranjitsinhji includes a number of staged photographs of Palairet playing his shots , and describes his methods in places , using them as the model which young players should adopt . He played predominantly off the front foot , and tended to be less effective on soft pitches . He favoured shots on the off side , particularly the off drive and cover drive . During Palairet 's career , bowlers favoured a tactic , known as off theory , of bowling the ball just outside the off stump . The strength of Palairet 's off side strokes helped him to score effectively against this tactic . Fry suggests that the early practice that Palairet gained against Attewell and Martin , who bowled accurately at the stumps , was a key factor in limiting his range of leg side shots . He favoured lofted shots which were often compared to golf strokes . 
 For a time early in his career , he attempted to play more powerfully , but then returned to his forward style . Despite this , he remained capable of hitting the ball out of the County Ground in Taunton and into the River Tone at one end or the churchyard at the other . Although considered a stylish batsman , Palairet was described by Foot as having " the minimum of extrovert flourish " and " no quaint mannerisms " , both factors he considered relevant in Palairet 's limited Test appearances . Throughout his career , Palairet shunned improvisation , and played well @-@ established , orthodox cricket shots . He remained absolutely still at the crease while preparing to play a shot , a feature later seen in Viv Richards ' batting . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Palairet married Caroline Mabel Laverton , the daughter of William Henry Laverton , a prominent cricket patron in Wiltshire , in 1894 . The pair had two children : Evelyn Mabel Hamilton , born in 1895 , and Henry Edward Hamilton the following year . Palairet 's brother , Richard , played first @-@ class cricket for Somerset between 1891 and 1902 , albeit without as much success as Lionel . In addition to cricket , Palairet maintained an interest in a range of other sports ; a 1901 profile of him in Baily 's Magazine records that foxhunting was his primary sporting interest . After his retirement from cricket , Palairet became a prominent golfer in the south @-@ west . He was the first chairman of the Devon County Golf Union upon its formation in 1911 , captained Devon at golf either side of the First World War , from 1914 through until 1926 , and was also president of the Union from 1923 until 1932 . He developed the idea of an inter @-@ club team championship within Devon , and donated the prize , which remains named the Palairet Trophy . During the First World War , he had command of a Remount Depot at <unk> , the seat of the Earl of Devon . He died in Exmouth on 27 March 1933 , aged 62 . 
 = Black wildebeest = 
 The black wildebeest or white @-@ tailed gnu ( Connochaetes gnou ) is one of the two closely related wildebeest species . It is a member of the genus Connochaetes and family Bovidae . It was first described in 1780 by Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann . The black wildebeest is typically between 170 – 220 cm ( 67 – 87 in ) in head @-@ and @-@ body length , and the average weight is 110 – 180 kg ( 240 – 400 lb ) . Males stand up to approximately 111 – 121 cm ( 44 – 48 in ) at the shoulder , while the height of the females is 106 – 116 cm ( 42 – 46 in ) . The black wildebeest is characterised by its white , long , horse @-@ like tail . It also has a dark brown to black coat and long , dark @-@ coloured hair between its forelegs and under its belly . 
 The black wildebeest is a herbivore , and almost the whole diet consists of grasses . Water is an essential requirement . There are three distinct social groups : the female herds , the bachelor herds and the territorial bulls . They are fast runners , and communicate using a variety of visual and vocal communication . The primary breeding season for the black wildebeest is from February to April . A single calf is usually born after a gestational period of about eight and a half months . The calf remains with its mother until her next calf is born a year later . The black wildebeest inhabits open plains , grasslands and Karoo shrublands . 
 The natural populations of black wildebeest , endemic to the southern part of Africa , were almost completely exterminated in the 19th century , due to their reputation as pests and the value of their hides and meat . However , the species has been reintroduced widely from captive specimens , both in private areas and nature reserves throughout most of Lesotho , Swaziland , and South Africa . It has also been introduced outside its natural range in Namibia and Kenya . 
 = = Taxonomy and evolution = = 
 The scientific name of the black wildebeest is Connochaetes gnou . The animal is placed in the genus Connochaetes and family Bovidae and was first described by the German zoologist , Eberhard August Wilhelm von Zimmermann in 1780 . He based his description on an article written by natural philosopher Jean @-@ Nicolas @-@ Sébastien Allamand in 1776 . The generic name Connochaetes derives from the Greek words <unk> , <unk> , " beard " , and <unk> , <unk> , " flowing hair " , " mane " . The specific name " gnou " originates from the Khoikhoi name for these animals , gnou . The common name " gnu " is also said to have originated from the <unk> name T <unk> , which refers to the repeated calls of " ge @-@ nu " by the bull in the mating season . The black wildebeest was first discovered in the northern part of South Africa in the 1800s . 
 The black wildebeest is currently included in the same genus as the blue wildebeest ( Connochaetes taurinus ) . This has not always been the case and at one time the latter was placed under a separate genus of its own , Gorgon . The black wildebeest lineage seems to have diverged from the blue wildebeest in the mid to late Pleistocene , and became a distinct species around a million years ago . This evolution is quite recent on a geologic time scale . 
 Features necessary for defending a territory such as the horns and broad @-@ based skull of the modern black wildebeest , have been found in their fossil ancestors . The earliest known fossil remains are in sedimentary rock in Cornelia in the Orange Free State and date back about eight hundred thousand years . Fossils have also been reported from the Vaal River deposits , though it is unclear whether or not they are as ancient as those found in Cornelia . Horns of the black wildebeest have been found in sand dunes near Hermanus in South Africa . This is far beyond the recorded range of the species and it has been suggested that these animals may have migrated to that region from the Karoo . 
 = = = Hybrids = = = 
 The black wildebeest is known to hybridise with its taxonomically close relative , the blue wildebeest . Male black wildebeest have been reported to mate with female blue wildebeest and vice versa . The differences in social behaviour and habitats have historically prevented interspecific hybridisation between the species , however hybridisation may occur when they are both confined within the same area . The resulting offspring is usually fertile . A study of these hybrid animals at Spioenkop Dam Nature Reserve in South Africa revealed that many had disadvantageous abnormalities relating to their teeth , horns and the <unk> bones in the skull . Another study reported an increase in the size of the hybrid as compared to either of its parents . In some animals the auditory bullae are highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused . 
 = = Description = = 
 Black wildebeest are sexually dimorphic , with females being smaller in size and more slender than males . The head @-@ and @-@ body length is typically between 170 and 220 cm ( 67 and 87 in ) . Males reach approximately 111 to 121 cm ( 44 to 48 in ) at the shoulder , while females reach 106 to 116 cm ( 42 to 46 in ) . Males typically weigh 140 to 157 kg ( 309 to 346 lb ) and females 110 to 122 kg ( 243 to 269 lb ) . A distinguishing feature in both sexes is the tail , which is long and similar to that of a horse . Its bright @-@ white colour gives this animal the vernacular name of " white @-@ tailed gnu " , and also distinguishes it from the blue wildebeest , which has a black tail . The length of the tail ranges from 80 to 100 cm ( 31 to 39 in ) . 
 The black wildebeest has a dark brown or black coat which is slightly paler in summer and coarser and shaggier in the winter . Calves are born with shaggy , fawn @-@ coloured fur . Males are darker than females . They have bushy and dark @-@ tipped manes that , as in the blue wildebeest , stick up from the back of the neck . The hairs which compose this are white or cream @-@ coloured with dark tips . On its muzzle and under its jaw it has black bristly hair . It also has long , dark @-@ coloured hair between its forelegs and under its belly . Other physical features include a thick neck , a plain back , and rather small and beady eyes . 
 Both sexes have strong horns that curve forward , resembling hooks and are up to 78 cm ( 31 in ) long . The horns have a broad base in mature males , and are flattened to form a protective shield . In females , the horns are both shorter and narrower . They become fully developed in females in the third year , while it is not before the age of four or five that horns are fully grown in males . The black wildebeest normally has 13 thoracic vertebrae , though specimens with 14 have been reported , and this species shows a tendency for the thoracic region to become elongated . There are scent glands that secrete a glutinous substance in front of the eyes , under the hair tufts and on the forefeet . Females have two nipples . Apart from the difference in the appearance of the tail , the two species of wildebeest also differ in size and colour , with the black being smaller and darker than the blue . 
 The black wildebeest can maintain its body temperature within a small range in spite of large fluctuations in external temperatures . It shows well @-@ developed orientation behaviour towards solar radiation which helps it thrive in hot , and often shadeless , habitats . The erythrocyte count is high at birth and increases till the age of two to three months , while in contrast , the <unk> count is low at birth and falls throughout the animal 's life . The neutrophil count is high at all ages . The <unk> and haemoglobin content decreases till twenty to thirty days after birth . There is a peak in the content of all these <unk> parameters at the age of two to three months , after which the readings gradually decline , reaching their lowest values in the oldest individuals . The presence of fast @-@ twitch fibres and the ability of the muscles to use large amounts of oxygen help explain the rapid running speed of the black wildebeest and its high resistance to fatigue . Individuals may live for about twenty years . 
 = = Diseases and parasites = = 
 The black wildebeest is particularly susceptible to anthrax , and rare and widely scattered outbreaks have been recorded and have proved deadly . Ataxia related to myelopathy and low copper concentrations in the liver have also been seen in the black wildebeest . <unk> ( Ehrlichia <unk> ) is a tick @-@ borne <unk> disease that affects the black wildebeest and , as the blue wildebeest is fatally affected by rinderpest and foot @-@ and @-@ mouth disease , it is believed that the black wildebeest is also likely to be susceptible to these . Malignant catarrhal fever is a fatal disease of domestic cattle caused by a <unk> . It seems that , like the blue wildebeest , the black wildebeest acts as a reservoir for the virus and that all animals are carriers , being persistently infected but showing no symptoms . The virus is transmitted from mother to calf during the gestation period or soon after birth . 
 Black wildebeest act as hosts to a number of external and internal parasites . A study of the animal in <unk> <unk> ( Eastern Cape Province , South Africa ) revealed the presence of all the larval stages of the nasal bot flies Oestrus variolosus and <unk> <unk> . The first instar larvae of G <unk> were found in large numbers on the dura mater of wildebeest calves , specially between June and August , and these later migrated to the nasal passages . Repeated outbreaks of mange ( scab ) have led to large @-@ scale extinctions . The first study of the protozoa in blue and black wildebeest showed the presence of 23 protozoan species in the rumen , with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> common in all the animals . 
 = = Ecology and behaviour = = 
 Black wildebeest are mainly active during the early morning and late afternoon preferring to rest during the hottest part of the day . The animals can run at speeds of 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) . When a person approaches a herd to within a few hundred metres , the wildebeest snort and run a short distance before stopping and looking back , repeating this behaviour if further approached . They communicate with each other using pheromones detected by flehmen and several forms of vocal communication . One of these is a metallic snort or an echoing " hick " , that can be heard up to 1500 metres ( 1 mile ) away . They are preyed on by animals like lion , spotted hyena , Cape hunting dog , leopard , cheetah and crocodile . Of these the calves are targeted manly by the hyenas , while lions attack the adults . 
 The black wildebeest is a gregarious animal with a complex social structure comprising three distinct groups : firstly , the female herds , consisting of adult females and their young ; secondly , the bachelor herds , consisting only of yearlings and older males ; thirdly , the territorial bulls . The number of females per herd is variable , generally ranging from 14 to 32 , but is highest in the densest populations and also increases with forage density . There is a strong attachment among members of the female herd , many of whom are related to each other . Large herds often get divided into smaller groups . While small calves stay with their mothers , the older ones form groups of their own within the herd . These herds have a social hierarchy , and the females are rather aggressive towards others trying to join the group . Young males are generally repelled by their mothers before the calving season starts . Separation of a young calf from its mother can be a major cause of calf mortality . While some male yearlings stay within the female herd , the others join a bachelor herd . These are usually loose associations and , unlike the female herds , the individuals are not much attached to each other . Another difference between the female and bachelor herds is the lesser aggression on the part of the males . These bachelor herds move widely in the available habitat and act as a refuge for males that have been unsuccessful as territorial bulls , and also as a reserve for future breeding males . 
 Mature bulls , generally more than four years old , set up their own territories through which female herds often pass . These territories are maintained throughout the year , with animals usually separated by a distance of about 100 – 400 m ( 330 – 1 @,@ 310 ft ) , but this can vary according to the quality of the habitat . In favourable conditions , this distance is as little as 9 m ( 30 ft ) , but can be as large as 1 @,@ 600 m ( 5 @,@ 200 ft ) in poor habitat . Each bull has a patch of ground in the centre of his territory in which he regularly drops dung , and in which he performs acts of display . These include urinating , scraping , pawing and rolling on the ground and thumping it with his horns - all of which demonstrate his prowess to other bulls . An encounter between two bulls involves elaborate rituals . Estes coined the term " Challenge Ritual " to describe this behaviour for the blue wildebeest , but this is also applicable to the black wildebeest , owing to the close similarity in the behaviour in both species . The bulls approach each other with their heads lowered , resembling a grazing position ( sometimes actually grazing ) . This is usually followed by movements like standing in a reverse @-@ parallel position , in which one male urinates and the opponent smells and performs flehmen , after which they may reverse the procedure . During this ritual or afterwards the two can toss their horns at each other , circle one another , or even look away . Then begins the fight , which may be of low intensity ( consisting of interlocking the horns and pushing each other in a standing position ) or high intensity ( consisting of their dropping to their knees and straining against each other powerfully , trying to remain in contact while their foreheads are nearly touching the ground ) . Threat displays like shaking the head may also take place . 
 = = Diet = = 
 Black wildebeest are predominantly grazers , preferring short grasses but also feeding on other herbs and shrubs , especially when grass is scarce . Shrubs can comprise as much as 37 % of the diet but grasses normally forms more than 90 % . Water is essential , though they can exist without drinking water everyday . The herds graze either in line or in loose groups , usually walking in single file when moving about . They are often accompanied by cattle egrets , which pick out and consume the insects hidden in their coats or disturbed by their movements . 
 Before the arrival of Europeans in the area , wildebeest used to roam widely , probably in relation to the arrival of the rains and the availability of good forage . They never made such extensive migrations as the blue wildebeest but at one time , they used to cross the Drakensberg Range , moving eastwards in autumn , searching for good pastures . Then they returned to the <unk> in the spring and moved towards the west , where sweet potato and Karoo vegetation were abundant . They also moved from north to south as the <unk> found north of the Vaal River matured and became unpalatable , the wildebeest only consuming young shoots of <unk> . Nowadays , almost all black wildebeest are in reserves or on farms and the extent of their movements is limited . 
 In a study of the feeding activities of a number of female black wildebeest living in a shadeless habitat , it was found that they fed mostly at night . They were observed at regular intervals over a period of one year and it was observed that with an increase in temperature , the number of wildebeest feeding at night also increased . During cool weather they lay down to rest but in hotter conditions they rested while standing up . 
 = = Reproduction = = 
 Male black wildebeest reach sexual maturity at the age of three years but may mature at a younger age in captivity . Females first come into season and breed as yearlings or as two @-@ year @-@ olds . They breed only once in a year . 
 A dominant male black wildebeest will have a harem of females and will not allow other males to mate with them . The breeding season occurs at the end of the rainy season and lasts a few weeks between February and April . When one of his females comes into oestrus the male concentrates on her and mates with her several times . Sexual behaviour by the male at this time includes stretching low , ears down , sniffing of the female 's vulva , performing ritual urination and touching his chin to the female 's rump . At the same time , the female keeps her tail upwards ( sometimes vertically ) or <unk> it across the face of the male . The pair usually separates after copulation , but the female occasionally follows her mate afterwards , touching his rump with her snout . During the breeding season , the male loses condition as he spends little time grazing . Males are known to mount other males . 
 The gestational period lasts for about eight and a half months , after which a single calf is born . Females in labour do not move away from the female herd and repeatedly lie down and get up again . Births normally take place in areas with short grass when the cow is in the lying position . She stands up immediately afterwards which causes the umbilical cord to break , vigorously licks the calf and chews on the afterbirth . In spite of regional variations , around 80 % of the females give birth to their calves within a period of two to three weeks after the onset of the rainy season - from mid @-@ November to the end of December . Seasonal breeding has also been reported among wildebeest in captivity in European zoos . Twin births have not been reported . 
 The calf has a tawny , shaggy coat and weighs about 11 kilograms ( 24 lb ) . By the end of the fourth week , the four incisors have fully emerged and about the same time , two knob @-@ like structures , the <unk> , appear on the head . These later develop into horns which reach a length of 200 – 250 mm ( 8 – 10 in ) by the fifth month and are well developed by the eighth month . The calf is able to stand and run shortly after birth , a period of great danger for animals in the wild . It is fed by its lactating mother for six to eight months , begins nibbling on grass blades at four weeks and remains with her until her next calf is born a year later . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The black wildebeest is native to southern Africa . Its historical range included South Africa , Swaziland and Lesotho , but in the latter two countries it was hunted to extinction in the 19th century . It has now been reintroduced to them and also introduced to Namibia where it has become well established . 
 The black wildebeest inhabits open plains , grasslands and Karoo shrublands in both steep mountainous regions and lower undulating hills . The altitudes in these areas varies from 1 @,@ 350 – 2 @,@ 150 m ( 4 @,@ 430 – 7 @,@ 050 ft ) . The herds are often migratory or nomadic , otherwise they may have regular home ranges of 1 km2 ( 11 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . Female herds roam in home ranges around 250 acres ( 100 ha ; 0 @.@ 39 sq mi ) in size . In the past , black wildebeest occurred in the highveld temperate grasslands during the dry winter season and the arid Karoo region during the rains . However , as a result of massive hunting of the animal for its hide , they vanished from their historical range , and are now largely limited to game farms and protected reserves in southern Africa . In most reserves , the black wildebeest shares its habitat with the <unk> and the springbok . 
 = = Threats and conservation = = 
 Where it lives alongside the blue wildebeest , the two species can hybridise , and this is regarded as a potential threat to the maintenance of the species . The black wildebeest was once very numerous and was present in southern Africa in vast herds but by the end of the nineteenth century , it had nearly been hunted to extinction and fewer than 600 animals remained . A small number of individuals was still present in game reserves and at zoos and it is from these that the population was rescued . 
 There are now believed to be more than 18 @,@ 000 individuals , 7 @,@ 000 of which are in Namibia , outside its natural range , and where it is farmed . Around 80 % of the wildebeest occur in private areas , while the other 20 % are confined in protected areas . The population is now trending upward ( particularly on private land ) and for this reason the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , in its Red List of Threatened Species , rates the black wildebeest as being of " Least Concern " . Its introduction into Namibia has been a success and numbers have increased substantially there from 150 in 1982 to 7 @,@ 000 in 1992 . 
 = = Uses and interaction with humans = = 
 The black wildebeest is depicted on the coat of arms of the Province of Natal in South Africa . Over the years the South African authorities have issued stamps displaying the animal and the South African Mint has struck a five rand coin with a prancing black wildebeest . 
 Though they are not present in their natural habitat in such large numbers today , black wildebeest were at one time the main herbivores in the ecosystem and a main prey item for large predators such as the lion . Nowadays they are economically important for human beings as they are a major tourist attraction as well as providing animal products such as leather and meat . The hide makes good quality leather and the flesh is coarse , dry and rather hard . Wildebeest meat is dried to make biltong , an important part of South African cuisine . The meat of females is more tender than that of males , and is at its best during the autumn season . The wildebeest can provide ten times as much meat as the Thomson 's gazelle . The silky , flowing tail is used to make fly @-@ whisks or " <unk> " . 
 However , black wildebeest can also affect human beings negatively . Wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock , and can transmit fatal diseases like rinderpest and cause epidemics among animals , particularly domestic cattle . They can also spread ticks , lungworms , tapeworms , flies and <unk> flukes .

 = Russian cruiser Rossia = 
 Rossia ( Russian : Россия ) was an armored cruiser of the Imperial Russian Navy built in the 1890s . She was designed as a long @-@ range commerce raider and served as such during the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 . She was based in Vladivostok when the war broke out and made a number of sorties in search of Japanese shipping in the early months of the war without much success . 
 Rossia , along with the other armored cruisers of the Vladivostok Cruiser Squadron , attempted to rendezvous in the Strait of Tsushima with the main portion of the Pacific Fleet sailing from Port Arthur in August 1904 , but were delayed and had to return to port without them . They encountered a Japanese squadron of four armored cruisers between them and their base shortly after they turned around . The Japanese sank the oldest Russian ship , Rurik , and damaged Rossia and Gromoboi during the Battle off Ulsan , but both Russian ships were repaired within two months . 
 After the end of the war Rossia returned to Kronstadt where she underwent a three @-@ year refit that strengthened her armament . She was fitted with mine rails in 1914 and laid one minefield during World War I that damaged two German light cruisers . She was reconstructed beginning in late 1915 to further strengthen her armament , but played no part during the rest of the war as her crew became involved in revolutionary activities in 1917 . She was taken over by the Bolsheviks in late 1917 , but was put into reserve in 1918 and sold for scrap in 1922 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Rossia was originally intended to be a repeat of the armored cruiser Rurik , but the Director of the Naval Ministry wanted the armor to cover more of the ship 's side . However the design went through a number of changes during late 1892 and early 1893 and incorporated a number of technological advances that had recently become available . One notable change was the deletion of Rurik 's sailing rig . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 Rossia was 485 feet ( 147 @.@ 8 m ) long overall . She had a maximum beam of 68 @.@ 6 feet ( 20 @.@ 9 m ) and a draught of 26 @.@ 2 feet ( 8 @.@ 0 m ) . She displaced 12 @,@ 195 long tons ( 12 @,@ 391 t ) , only 65 long tons ( 66 t ) more than designed . Rossia was sheathed in wood and copper to reduce fouling . She was considered to be a good sea boat with a smooth roll — attributable to her tumblehome sides . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 In an effort to extend her range , Rossia was built with an unusual machinery arrangement . One large vertical triple expansion ( VTE ) steam engine drove each of the outer propeller shafts while a small cruising VTE engine drove the center shaft . At full speed the center propeller had to be uncoupled as there was not enough steam to drive all three engines simultaneously ; the outer propellers were uncoupled when cruising . The two main engines were designed for a total of 14 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 813 kW ) , but they developed 15 @,@ 523 ihp ( 11 @,@ 575 kW ) on trials and drove the ship to a maximum speed of 19 @.@ 74 knots ( 36 @.@ 56 km / h ; 22 @.@ 72 mph ) . The cruising engine developed 2 @,@ 500 ihp ( 1 @,@ 864 kW ) . Thirty @-@ two Belleville water @-@ tube boilers provided steam for the engines . 
 She could carry a maximum of 2 @,@ 200 long tons ( 2 @,@ 235 t ) of coal . This gave her a radius of action of 7 @,@ 740 nautical miles ( 14 @,@ 330 km ; 8 @,@ 910 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . In 1898 , some of the first large warship trials of oil fuel were carried out . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Rossia 's main armament consisted of four 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) 45 @-@ caliber Pattern 1892 guns , one at each end of the ship on each side , sponsoned out over the tumblehome of the ship 's sides . They were protected by gun shields . The guns could be depressed to − 5 ° and elevated to 18 ° . They fired 193 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 87 @.@ 8 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 950 feet per second ( 900 m / s ) which gave a range of 12 @,@ 000 yd ( 11 @,@ 000 m ) at 13 ° elevation . 
 Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) / 45 Pattern 1892 guns . One gun was mounted under the forecastle and another in the stern ; neither gun could fire to the side . The remaining guns were mounted in hull embrasures . In their pivot mounts the guns could depress to -6 ° and elevate to + 20 ° . They fired 91 @.@ 4 @-@ pound ( 41 @.@ 5 kg ) Pattern 1907 high explosive projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 600 feet per second ( 790 m / s ) . This gave a range of 12 @,@ 600 yd ( 11 @,@ 500 m ) at maximum elevation . Rossia carried 210 rounds per gun . 
 Defense against torpedo boats was provided by a variety of light @-@ caliber weapons . Twelve 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) Canet Pattern 1892 50 @-@ caliber guns were mounted in sponsons on the upper deck , protected by gun shields . The gun fired 10 @.@ 8 @-@ pound ( 4 @.@ 9 kg ) shells to a range of about 8 @,@ 600 yards ( 7 @,@ 864 m ) at its maximum elevation of 21 ° with a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 700 ft / s ( 820 m / s ) . The rate of fire was between twelve and fifteen rounds per minute . 
 A total of twenty 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns were carried . They fired a 3 @.@ 3 @-@ pound ( 1 @.@ 5 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 476 ft / s ( 450 m / s ) at a rate of 20 rounds per minute to a range of 2 @,@ 020 yards ( 1 @,@ 850 m ) . Eighteen 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss guns were also carried . They fired a 1 @.@ 1 @-@ pound ( 0 @.@ 50 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 450 ft / s ( 440 m / s ) at a rate of 20 rounds per minute to a range of 3 @,@ 038 yards ( 2 @,@ 778 m ) . 
 Five above @-@ water 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) torpedo tubes were mounted . The exact type of torpedo carried likely changed over Rossia 's lifetime : the original fifteen @-@ inch Whitehead torpedo only had a maximum range of 440 yards ( 402 @.@ 3 m ) at a speed of 29 knots ( 54 km / h ; 33 mph ) and a 57 @-@ pound ( 25 @.@ 9 kg ) warhead . These were later replaced by an improved model with two speed / range settings and a 141 @-@ pound ( 64 @.@ 0 kg ) warhead . Its maximum range was 980 yards ( 896 @.@ 1 m ) at a speed of 25 knots ( 46 km / h ; 29 mph ) . 
 = = = Armor = = = 
 Rossia used newly developed Harvey armor which saved considerable weight over the steel armor used by Rurik for the same amount of protection . Her waterline belt extended from the stern to 80 feet ( 24 @.@ 4 m ) short of the bow . It extended 4 feet 6 inches ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) above the waterline and 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) below the waterline . It was 8 inches ( 203 mm ) thick amidships , but reduced to six inches fore and abaft the machinery spaces and to 5 inches ( 127 mm ) at the stern . The belt tapered to a thickness of 4 inches ( 102 mm ) at its lower edge . It was closed off at the forward end by a 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) transverse bulkhead . A protective 2 @.@ 5 – 3 @-@ inch ( 64 – 76 mm ) deck ran forward from the bulkhead to the bow . The main armored deck was 2 inches ( 51 mm ) thick , but a five @-@ inch glacis projected above it to protect the tops of the engine cylinders . The conning tower had walls 12 inches ( 305 mm ) thick . The funnel uptakes were protected by 3 inches ( 76 mm ) of armor between the lower and middle decks . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 Rossia was built by the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg . Construction began in October 1893 although she was not formally laid down until 20 May 1895 and launched on 30 April 1896 . After her launch , she was towed to Kronstadt for fitting @-@ out , but she was pushed onto a sandbar by a storm and required a month to free her . Rossia entered service in late 1896 and participated in Queen Victoria 's Diamond Jubilee Fleet Review in June 1897 at Spithead . She returned to Kronstadt to finish her trials before sailing for the Far East in October . She reached Nagasaki , Japan on 10 March 1898 and remained in the Pacific until the beginning of the Russo @-@ Japanese War in 1904 . 
 = = = Russo @-@ Japanese War = = = 
 At the start of the Russo @-@ Japanese War , Rossia was under the command of Captain Andrei <unk> Andreev , and was the flagship of the Vladivostok Cruiser Squadron under the overall command of Rear Admiral Karl Jessen . The other ships in the squadron were the armored cruisers Gromoboi and Rurik as well as the protected cruiser Bogatyr . The squadron made a number of sorties against Japanese shipping early in the war , but only one was reasonably successful when the transport Hitachi Maru , carrying eighteen 28 @-@ centimeter ( 11 in ) siege howitzers and over 1000 troops intended for the siege of Port Arthur , was sunk in June 1904 . On an earlier sortie in May 1904 Rossia flew an observation balloon off her quarterdeck to ( unsuccessfully ) locate Japanese shipping ; the first use of an aerial device by a warship on the high seas during a time of war . 
 = = = = Battle off Ulsan = = = = 
 During the war the bulk of the Russian Pacific Fleet was located in Port Arthur where they were blockaded by the Japanese . On 10 August 1904 the ships at Port Arthur attempted breakout to Vladivostok , but were turned back in the Battle of the Yellow Sea . Admiral Jessen was ordered to rendezvous with them , but the order was delayed and his ships had to raise steam , so he did not sortie until the evening of 13 August . Bogatyr had been damaged earlier when she grounded and did not sail with the squadron . By dawn he had reached the island of Tsushima in the Tsushima Strait between Korea and Japan . He turned back for Vladivostok when he failed to see any ships from the Port Arthur squadron . 36 miles ( 58 km ) north of the island he encountered the Japanese squadron commanded by Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonojō tasked to patrol the Tsushima Strait . The Japanese force had four modern armored cruisers , Iwate , Izumo , Tokiwa , and Azuma . The two squadrons had passed during the night without spotting the other and each had reversed course around first light . This put the Japanese ships astride the Russian route to Vladivostok . 
 Admiral Jessen turned to the northeast when he spotted the Japanese at 5 : 00 a.m. and they followed suit , albeit on a slightly converging course . Both sides opened fire around 05 : 23 at a range of 8 @,@ 500 meters ( 9 @,@ 300 yd ) . The Japanese ships concentrated their fire on Rurik , the rear ship of the Russian formation . She was hit fairly quickly and began to fall astern of the other two ships . Admiral Jessen turned southeast in an attempt to open the range , but this blinded the Russian gunners and prevented any of their broadside guns from bearing on the Japanese . About 06 : 00 Admiral Jessen turned 180 ° to starboard in an attempt to reach the Korean coast and to allow Rurik to rejoin the squadron . Admiral Kamimura followed suit around 06 : 10 , but turned to port , which opened the range between the squadrons . Azuma developed engine problems around this time so the Japanese squadron slowed to conform with her best speed . Firing recommenced at 06 : 24 and Rurik was hit three times in the stern , flooding her steering compartment so that she had to be steered with her engines . Her speed continued to decrease , further exposing her to Japanese fire , and her steering jammed to port around 06 : 40 . 
 Admiral Jessen made another 180 ° turn in an attempt to interpose his two ships between the Japanese and Rurik , but the latter ship suddenly turn to starboard and increased speed and passed between Jessen 's ships and the Japanese . Admiral Kamimura turned 180 ° as well so that both squadrons were heading southeast on parallel courses , but Admiral Jessen quickly made another 180 ° turn so that they headed on opposing courses . Iwate was hit around this time which knocked out three six @-@ inch and one twelve @-@ pounder guns , killing 32 and wounding 43 . The Japanese squadron opened the range again when it made a 180 ° another turn to port . The Russians reversed course for the third time around 07 : 45 in another attempt to support Rurik although Rossia was on fire herself . Her fires were extinguished about twenty minutes later . Admiral Kamimura circled Rurik to the south at 08 : 00 and allowed the other two Russian ships to get to his north and gave them an uncontested route to Vladivostok . Despite this , Admiral Jessen turned back once more at 08 : 15 and ordered Rurik to make her own way back to Vladivostok before turning north at his maximum speed , about 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . 
 About this time Admiral Kamimura 's two elderly protected cruisers , Naniwa and Takachiho were approaching from the south . Their arrival allowed Kamimura to pursue Jessen with all of his armored cruisers . They fought a running battle with the Russians for the next hour and a half ; scoring enough hits on them to force their speed down to 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . Azuma 's engines again broke down during this chase and she was replaced in the line by Tokiwa . The Japanese closed to a minimum of about 5 @,@ 000 meters ( 5 @,@ 500 yd ) , but Admiral Kamimura then opened the range up to 6 @,@ 500 meters ( 7 @,@ 100 yd ) . 
 About 10 : 00 Kamimura 's gunnery officer erroneously informed him that Izumo had expended three @-@ quarters of her ammunition and he turned back after a five @-@ minute rapid @-@ fire barrage . He did not wish to leave the Tsushima Strait unguarded and thought that he could expend his remaining ammunition on Rurik . By this time she had been sunk by Naniwa and Takachiho which had closed to 3 @,@ 000 meters ( 3 @,@ 300 yd ) of Rurik in order to finish her off . They had radioed Admiral Kamimura that she was sunk , but he did not receive the message . Shortly after the Japanese turned back Gromoboi and Rossia were forced to heave @-@ to to make repairs . 
 Rossia suffered only 44 dead and 156 wounded ; far less than Gromoboi 's 87 dead and 170 wounded . This was attributable to Rossia 's captain 's policy of ordering the gun crews for his quick @-@ firing guns on the engaged side to lay down and those on the unengaged side to go below , in contrast to the other ship keeping her light guns manned at all times . Rossia had been hit nineteen times on the starboard side of her hull and nine on her port side , plus other hits in her funnels , boats and decks . She had half of her guns knocked out and a fire caused by the ignition of excess propellant charges . Despite this number of hits , she was not badly damaged because her waterline belt was not penetrated by any hit . She was repaired within two months by the rudimentary facilities available at Vladivostok . Rossia made no further effort to interfere with Japanese shipping during the war . 
 = = = Interwar period = = = 
 Rossia returned to Kronstadt , arriving on 8 April 1906 , where she was given a lengthy refit that was finished in 1909 . Her engines and boilers were reconditioned , her mainmast was removed and she received additional six @-@ inch guns . Six more guns in lightly armored casemates were added on the upper deck , positioned on each side in the intervals between the main @-@ deck six @-@ inch guns . In addition the bow gun was moved to the upper deck to allow it to fire to each side . This increased the ship 's broadside by four guns . 
 Rossia represented Russia at King George V 's Coronation Fleet Review in June 1911 . She departed Kronstadt in September 1912 for a training cruise to the Canaries and the Virgin Islands , returning to the Baltic in time to visit Copenhagen in March 1913 in company with the protected cruisers Aurora and Oleg . She left for another training cruise to the Azores in September 1913 and was cruising in the Mediterranean in April 1914 . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 Rossia served as the flagship of the 2nd Cruiser Brigade of the Baltic Fleet during World War I. She was modified to serve as a fast minelayer with a capacity of one hundred naval mines before the war . In January 1915 she laid a minefield in company with Oleg and Bogatyr between Kiel and the Mecklenburg coast that damaged the German light cruisers SMS Augsburg and SMS Gazelle . She was reconstructed beginning in October 1915 at Kronstadt to increase her armament . Her forecastle deck was removed as well as the fore and aft six @-@ inch guns . They were replaced by two eight @-@ inch guns mounted on the centerline forward and another pair was mounted on the quarterdeck . These additions increased her broadside to six eight @-@ inch , but only seven six @-@ inch guns . 
 Rossia 's crew took an active part in the revolutionary movements in 1917 and came under control of the Soviet Red Fleet in September 1917 . The Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk required the Soviets to evacuate their base at Helsinki in March 1918 or have them interned by newly independent Finland even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen over . Rossia sailed to Kronstadt in what became known as the ' Ice Voyage ' and was placed into reserve shortly after her arrival . She was sold to a German company for scrapping on 1 July 1922 . While being towed to Germany , she grounded on the coast of Estonia , but was subsequently towed to Kiel and broken up . 
 = KaDee Strickland = 
 Katherine Dee " KaDee " Strickland ( born December 14 , 1975 ) is an American actress known for her role as Charlotte King on the ABC drama Private Practice . 
 Well known in her hometown of Patterson , Georgia , when she was a child , she began acting during high school . Strickland studied the profession in Philadelphia and New York City , where she obtained mostly small roles in film , television and theater projects , among them The Sixth Sense ( 1999 ) . Her participation in the 2003 Hollywood films Anything Else and Something 's Gotta Give led to her receiving significant parts in the horror pictures Anacondas and The Grudge ( both 2004 ) . In the period they were released , Strickland was referred to as " the pride of Patterson " and the horror fandom 's " newest scream queen " , though her performances in both films received mixed critical reviews . 
 In 2005 , Strickland garnered positive critical comment for the romantic comedy Fever Pitch , and in 2007 , she was a cast regular in the television show The Wedding Bells and subsequently was added to the cast of Private Practice . Strickland has spoken against the emphasis placed on beauty in the Los Angeles acting community , in which she says her Southern U.S. background has helped to distinguish herself from other blonde @-@ haired actors . She has spoken of an affinity for her strong female characters and a desire to avoid sexualizing or sensationalizing her self @-@ presentation as a woman . She also has worked closely with the Rape , Abuse , and Incest National Network ( RAINN ) after participating in a storyline in which her Private Practice character Charlotte King was raped . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Strickland was born in Blackshear , Georgia to Susan Strickland , a nurse , and Dee Strickland , a high school football coach , principal and superintendent . KaDee 's birthname is Katherine Dee ; her parents combined the K in Katherine with her father 's name to make KaDee . She was raised in Patterson , Georgia , which she said is a " one @-@ stoplight town " , and she had a job picking tobacco on a local farm for eight years . When she was a child , Strickland watched the Woody Allen film Annie Hall ( 1975 ) and was , as she put it , " wanting to be in that place , and being completely taken with the energy of those people . I wanted to be in it " . During her childhood , she was well known locally as a member of the Strickland family and for her extracurricular activities and achievements ( she was the Homecoming Queen in elementary , middle and high school , the student council president and a cheerleader ) . She never considered a career in the performing arts until her participation in a one @-@ act play performed by students of her high school : " [ ... ] the minute I set foot on stage , that was it . Destiny took over . There were no other options . I felt like I fit my skin , I knew what I was here to do " , Strickland said . 
 After graduating from high school , Strickland wanted to study drama at college in New York City , but her parents did not want her to live in such a large city so soon . Consequently , she applied instead to the University of the Arts in Philadelphia . During her studies there , she joined the Screen Actors Guild and considered using her given name , Katherine , as the first part of her stage name , before deciding she was " much too tomboy " for it . Strickland took a part @-@ time waitressing job at a local restaurant and interned at a casting agency , where one of her tasks was to read lines at auditions for small roles in local film and television projects ; the job landed Strickland her first film role . After graduating from university with a Fine Arts degree , she was schooled in New York City , and in late 2003 , she moved to Los Angeles , California . In 2006 , Strickland received the University of the Arts 's Silver Star Alumni Award .

 Strickland 's career began in 1999 with a brief appearance as a mourner at a funeral after @-@ party in The Sixth Sense , a two @-@ line part that she received after impressing writer @-@ director M. Night Shyamalan when reading lines for those auditioning for the film . According to Strickland , her role in the film helped her learn to temper her fake crying . The same year , she served as an extra in the independent film The Sterling Chase , and appeared in a small role opposite Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie in James Mangold 's drama Girl , Interrupted . 
 When staying in Philadelphia , Strickland had opportunities to take part in other films in production in and around the city . Those included <unk> Dowdell 's Train Ride , a date rape thriller filmed in 1998 , but not commercially released until 2005 because of financing problems . She was also cast in the crime drama Diamond Men with Robert Forster and Donnie Wahlberg ; it opened to sparkling reviews , with Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times declaring it " a fantastic film , with a good cast " . After she moved to New York City , Strickland appeared in Adam <unk> Lough 's filmmaking debut , Bomb the System , which received unenthusiastic notices from critics and was not shown outside film festivals until 2005 . 
 Concurrent to her film work , Strickland acquired stage experience in productions such as A Requiem for Things Past in mid @-@ 1999 , and John Patrick Shanley 's Women of Manhattan . She acted in a December 2002 episode of the television show Law & Order : Criminal Intent and made nine guest appearances on All My Children , which enabled her to leave her waitressing job . In 2003 , Strickland was cast opposite Eddie Cibrian in the pilot episode for an uncommissioned small screen serial adaptation of John Grisham 's novel The Street Lawyer . 
 Strickland appeared in two romantic comedy films in 2003 . Anything Else , written and directed by Woody Allen , featured her as the girlfriend of Jason Biggs 's character ( whom he snubs for Christina Ricci 's Amanda Chase ) ; she said it was a " dream come true " to work with Allen , of whom she is an " obsessive diehard " fan . The film was greeted with lukewarm reviews and dismal ticket sales , though Strickland later referred to it as her " big break " . The second , Something 's Gotta Give ( starring Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton ) , was a major critical and commercial success , though Strickland 's part in the film was brief . She played the girlfriend of Keaton 's character 's ex @-@ husband ( played by Paul Michael Glaser ) , a relationship involving age disparity that raised the eyebrows of Keaton and her daughter ( Amanda Peet ) . The following year , she made brief appearances in the direct @-@ to @-@ cable independent film Knots and the poorly received satirical comedy The Stepford Wives with Nicole Kidman , playing a <unk> and a game show contestant , respectively . 
 = = = Major film roles = = = 
 Strickland 's first lead role came when producer Doug Belgrad saw the dailies of her scene in Something 's Gotta Give . He cast her opposite Johnny Messner and Morris Chestnut in the jungle @-@ set horror film Anacondas : The Hunt for the Blood Orchid , the sequel to Anaconda ( 1997 ) . Strickland played an accomplished research scientist who travels to Borneo as part of an expedition team searching for a species of plant rumored to have life @-@ extending properties . She said she initially did not want to follow a Woody Allen film with a " snake movie " , but that she changed her mind because the hero was a female Southerner who was not " a complete idiot " or " a chick in shorts about to get whacked " . Though its box office revenue tripled its production budget , Anacondas did not perform as well as its predecessor , and most reviews panned the project . The cast received positive comment from Variety magazine and the Chicago Sun @-@ Times 's Roger Ebert , but a critic for the San Diego Union @-@ Tribune said the film was " so stupidly plotted and badly acted , it becomes unintentionally funny " , and described Strickland and her co @-@ stars ' work as " garden @-@ variety bad " . Other reviews focussed on the attractiveness of Strickland and her castmates ; Slant Magazine said " [ the film is ] populated with anonymous , attractive plastic people from the Los Angeles talent pool . " During the same period , The Florida Times @-@ Union referred to her as " the pride of Patterson " . 
 Strickland 's next project , The Grudge , was another horror film . In Japanese director Takashi Shimizu 's U.S. remake of his film Ju @-@ on : The Grudge ( 2003 ) , Strickland played ( in a role originated by Misaki Ito ) a Tokyo @-@ based American businesswoman whose relatives emigrate from the U.S. Strickland received the role through a casting session with producer Sam Raimi , who picked her based on her work in footage for the then @-@ unreleased Anacondas , and her willingness to work away from home for extended periods . She said that Japan and Japanese cinema had always fascinated her , and that she wanted to be " a part of that world " in which filmmakers communicate the story via action rather than dialogue ; she also highlighted the importance of being " able to explore being in the wrong place at the wrong time without being a sex object / damsel in distress . " The Grudge was a number @-@ one U.S. box office hit and quickly became one of the year 's most profitable films , but reviews were lukewarm . The Charlotte Observer wrote " the cast is drab and lifeless " , and earned " nothing but demerits " . Strickland 's presence in The Grudge and Anacondas led horror fans to name her " [ their ] newest scream queen " , but she said that when deciding what film to do next , she did not focus as much on genre as she did on good characters , scripts , and directors , which she said " don 't come around that often . " For the scene in which her character hides under her bed covers , Strickland received a 2005 Teen Choice Award nomination for Choice Movie Scary Scene . 
 In late 2004 , Strickland embarked on what she called " the craziest job I 've ever had " : a role in the Farrelly brothers film Fever Pitch , a baseball @-@ themed romantic comedy starring Drew Barrymore and Jimmy Fallon ( Strickland 's Anything Else co @-@ star ) and based on the Nick Hornby book . Strickland said it was " a blast " to play " such a maniac " , particularly after playing emotionally traumatised characters in Anacondas and The Grudge . On the film 's 2005 release , she received praise from PopMatters magazine , which described her as " irrepressible " in her role , and from MSNBC , which said she and JoBeth Williams " sometimes rescue [ the picture ] from its plodding moments " . The film raised Strickland 's profile further , though its critical response was mixed and it performed moderately at the box office . Strickland appeared as a lawyer and love interest in the film American Gangster , which stars Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington in 2007 . 
 = = = Work in television = = = 
 In early 2005 , Strickland was cast in the pilot episode for the fact @-@ based ABC television series Laws of Chance . It was based on the career of Kelly Siegler , a highly successful Houston , Texas @-@ based assistant district attorney . Strickland , whose co @-@ stars in the pilot included Frances Fisher and Bruce McGill , said she was " really excited to have the opportunity to portray this phenomenal lady " , but the series was dropped from development a few months later . Strickland was also cast in the independently financed 1950s @-@ set film Walker Payne as laid @-@ off <unk> Jason Patric 's love interest ; in a review of the film at the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival , Variety wrote that Strickland was " elegant " . In late 2005 , she joined the cast of The Flock , a crime drama featuring Richard Gere , Claire Danes and singer Avril Lavigne about a federal agent assigned to track down a missing girl and a paroled sex offender ( played by Strickland ) . Strickland said it was important to participate in such a story because she felt members of society need to consider and be responsible for their views on the sex offender counterculture , which she says " [ is ] actually not counter at all , it 's very real , very next door to you . " 
 Strickland 's first aired television project as a cast regular was the David E. Kelley @-@ produced series The Wedding Bells . According to her , she wanted to be in the series because " the subject of love and commitment is something to me that I want to walk into every day . It 's a lot better than dead bodies . " The show began airing on the Fox Network in March 2007 , and it was canceled the following month . The Baltimore Sun called it " awful in ways that make the word ' awful ' seem inadequate [ ... ] [ the cast is ] not a bad one at all , but just terrifically ill @-@ served by the material . " She joined the cast of the Grey 's Anatomy spin @-@ off Private Practice , which began airing in September 2007 ; and <unk> King , chief of staff at the show 's local hospital and a doctor specializing in <unk> surgery , and later sexology .

 Strickland has cited Jessica Lange , Holly Hunter , Diane Keaton ( in Annie Hall ) , Ione Skye ( her Fever Pitch co @-@ star ) and Jane Fonda as her inspirations and / or influences ; for The Grudge , she mimicked Fonda 's performance in Klute ( 1971 ) and her " brilliant way in that film of creating tension and fear for the audience just by walking down a hallway and looking over her shoulder . " She noted the input of her acting coach , Maggie Flanagan , who instructed Strickland to watch films with the sound turned off to gauge the quality and comprehensibility of a performance , and who Strickland credits as her " Jedi Knight " . 
 Strickland cites her work ethic and her " active imagination " as sources of inspiration when she is required to convey certain emotions , particularly negative ones . She said she does not practise method acting , but that actors can bring to a role elements that are , in her words , " an extension of [ their ] life experience " . According to her , she hopes to have her experience of growing up in an emotionally warm environment incorporated into her work . Strickland has spoken of her difficulty conveying different " versions " of emotions such as fear to different members of a worldwide film @-@ watching audience , saying " what really kept me going was trying to communicate something universal . " She said she is extremely flattered when people , particularly her fans , genuinely relate to her when her " version of storytelling " and work as an actress communicates to them . She said she believed she was " here " to act , and that she could not live without it : " It 's my joy , it 's what I love , and there 's no feeling like being able to do what you love in life , and really fully doing it " , she said . Strickland called her life as an actress " a crazy existence " and " completely unstable " because of the frequency with which she has to look for new jobs , but she said she is " gonna be whole hog with it " and continue to act until her death . 
 Strickland is a self @-@ described " big fashionista " and " very concerned with looks " , and she has noted the need for " an element of vanity " in acting , particularly in Los Angeles , where she says she is " continually surrounded by super @-@ human people [ ... ] I 've never seen so much beauty . " According to her , she has never had to rely on her appearance or felt pressurised to be beautiful — " The truth is I 'm not that girl " , she said . With regard to sources such as magazines , Strickland said she is " very careful " about the way she wants to be presented as a woman , saying she strives to avoid " sensationalizing or sexualizing " herself . As she put it , she is not accustomed to being considered a " pretty girl " or " attractive by a standard that I 've never felt that I was part of " . Strickland has a very audible Southern American accent , which she says is an advantage for her because it is " the one thing " that film and casting directors like the sound of and " really gravitate toward " , particularly in Los Angeles , which she called " a town full of blondes " . According to her , she learned to speak without the accent at university , and because she does not want people to think she has no other skills , she uses it only when it is required or requested . Strickland is experienced in stage combat and said she " like [ s ] to do physical stuff " ; in an interview to discuss Anacondas , she said " if there was a Braveheart for women , I 'd be all over it . "

 Strickland met Jason Behr , her co @-@ star in The Grudge , on the set of the film in 2004 . According to her , they had a shared affinity for Japan and Japanese culture and became best friends almost instantly because of their mutual willingness to explore it . The two began a relationship soon after filming ended . When asked about her love life in February 2005 , Strickland said it was " quiet " . On November 10 , 2006 , she married Behr in Ojai , California , in a ceremony that included elements of Japanese culture . Strickland said her experience planning the wedding aided her preparation for her role in The Wedding Bells . Her work on the wedding provided the inspiration for the wedding garden of Casa de Estrellas ( House of Stars ) , a Santa Fe , New Mexico , luxury inn and spa . Behr proposed to her on her birthday . On October 17 , 2013 , the couple welcomed their first child , a son named Atticus Elijah Behr . 
 Strickland is an advocate of the arts . In 2004 , before the release of Anacondas , she hosted the art debut of fellow actress Heidi Jayne <unk> at the <unk> Center for the Arts in Santa Monica , California . Strickland was among the actors who picketed alongside writers during the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike . 
 Strickland also works closely with the nation 's largest anti @-@ sexual assault organization , RAINN . When Private Practice creator Shonda Rhimes wrote a storyline in which Strickland 's character was brutally assaulted and raped , Strickland turned to RAINN in order to make sure that her portrayal of Charlotte 's recovery was as true to life as possible . Through her work with RAINN for this storyline , Strickland felt a personal connection with the group and decided to become an advocate for the organization . Since then she has spoken out for the passage of the SAFER act to eliminate the backlog of untested DNA evidence and has become a vocal advocate for using DNA evidence to solve rape cases . She also worked with <unk> to create an exclusive piece of jewelry for RAINN , in which 80 % of the sale price goes directly to the organization .

 After a dominant performance by Mercedes in the 2014 season , pre @-@ season testing for the 2015 season proved they would still be fastest of the field . The new Williams FW37 looked to be quick and reliable , while Ferrari in particular seemed to have made a big step forward . Former four @-@ time world champions Red Bull ran a car in black @-@ and @-@ white camouflage , that did nothing to disguise the fact that the Austrian team still struggled with problems concerning their Renault engines , doing the second least laps during the first test days in Jerez . While Lotus , Toro Rosso and Sauber were considered to be contesting for points with considerable advances made over the winter , the new partnership between McLaren and Honda got off to a bad start . The team managed only 380 laps , almost half of the next worst team , Force India . Furthermore , Fernando Alonso , who had signed back to the team after his controversial 2007 season , crashed during the second testing session in Barcelona and missed the first race of the season . Force India struggled to get their new car , the <unk> , on track . After missing the first test in Jerez , they started testing with their 2014 car in Barcelona before introducing their new model late .

 The 2015 Australian Grand Prix saw the debut of several young drivers new to Formula One and a late replacement for McLaren 's Fernando Alonso . Two weeks prior to the Grand Prix , McLaren , announced that Alonso would miss the inaugural 2015 race due to a concussion suffered in a crash during pre @-@ season testing at the Circuit de Barcelona @-@ Catalunya . Doctors advised Alonso not to race , avoiding further medical complications and his place was therefore taken by McLaren reserve driver , Kevin Magnussen who finished second on his debut at the same event in 2014 .

 = = = = Legal action against Sauber = = = = 
 A week before the start of the Grand Prix weekend , Dutch driver <unk> van der Garde launched legal action against Sauber before the Supreme Court of Victoria , to enforce a contract he entered into in June 2014 to drive for the team during the 2015 season . This action was based on an award that van der Garde obtained on 2 March 2015 through international arbitration in Switzerland , which he initiated after the team announced in November 2014 that their 2015 drivers would instead be Marcus Ericsson and Felipe Nasr . On Wednesday , 11 March 2015 , van der Garde succeeded by obtaining court orders compelling Sauber to permit him to drive in Melbourne . On the same day , Sauber appealed the orders made against them and also publicly announced that they would not compromise the safety of the team or other drivers by putting van der Garde in the car , since the <unk> chassis had only been tailored to fit Ericsson and Nasr . 
 The appeal was heard and dismissed the following day , Thursday , 12 March 2015 . As part of its legal argument , aside from raising safety concerns , Sauber also submitted that van der Garde 's contract had been terminated by the team in February with the approval of the FIA 's Contract Recognition Board in any event , and that van der Garde violated confidentiality clauses of the contract by discussing it with the media . Lawyers representing Ericsson and Nasr further argued that van der Garde had not followed due process by failing to give their clients prior notice of his legal action . The court upheld the previous orders to permit van der Garde to participate in the race and adjourned the hearing to the following day , Friday , 13 March 2015 , to hear arguments on contempt of court proceedings launched by van der Garde 's legal team against Sauber 's team principal , Monisha Kaltenborn . 
 Some two hours after the court made its initial judgment in favour of van der Garde , the FIA published an entry list for the Australian Grand Prix that included both Nasr and Ericsson for Sauber following pre @-@ event scrutineering . Despite this , neither driver took to the circuit during the first practice session on the Friday due to Sauber running the risk of having team assets seized for not complying with court orders . Nevertheless , based on media speculation about Bernie Ecclestone 's intervention to avoid further negative publicity on the sport , Ericsson and Nasr did participate in that afternoon 's second practice session . On Saturday , 14 March 2015 , the dispute reached a temporary resolution thanks to van der Garde announcing that he would forego racing in Melbourne , with a view to finding a more permanent solution in the future . The Sauber team and its new drivers for 2015 were thus able to complete Saturday 's qualifying session and a point @-@ scoring race on the Sunday .

 Per the regulations for the 2015 season , three practice sessions were held , two 1 @.@ 5 @-@ hour sessions on Friday and another one @-@ hour session before qualifying on Saturday . Mercedes confirmed their good form from pre @-@ season testing and topped the time sheets by a considerable margin in the first two practice sessions on Friday , with Nico Rosberg fastest in both outings .

Ferrari 's new signing Sebastian Vettel was third on Friday afternoon , seven tenths of a second down on Rosberg . Toro Rosso showed promising times , outperforming their sister team Red Bull in the first session . Only 16 cars participated on Friday morning . Sauber kept to the garage due to their legal troubles while Manor Marussia was unable to get their cars running all weekend . The Saubers did go out for the second session , while local favourite Daniel Ricciardo and Felipe Massa missed the session due to problems with their cars . McLaren 's problems continued as both cars were limited to very few laps . The first session also saw another evaluation run of the new Virtual Safety Car system . 
 Lewis Hamilton got the better of his team mate during the third practice session on Saturday morning , as Rosberg only managed third behind Vettel , almost a second down on Hamilton . Both Williams and Ferrari had another good session , while Lotus got both their drivers in the top ten , raising hopes for a points finish on Sunday . Red Bull continued to struggle , with Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat down in 15th and 18th and Ricciardo 's car stopping at the end of pit lane due to engine problems . Between them were the once more struggling McLarens .

 Qualifying consisted of three parts , 18 , 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively , with five drivers eliminated from competing after each of the first two sessions . Since the cars of Manor Marussia failed to start , only three drivers were eliminated during the first session of qualifying ( Q1 ) , all of which was run in dry conditions . The McLarens of Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen struggled as expected , following their lack of pre @-@ season testing and failed to make it into Q2 , just as Sauber driver Marcus Ericsson . Mercedes and Williams ' Valtteri Bottas were the only ones not having to use the softer tyres to proceed into the next part of qualifying . 
 The second session saw the Mercedes drivers doing only one timed run , which proved sufficient to proceed , while the Red Bulls and Toro Rossos were split up , with Daniil Kvyat and rookie Max Verstappen failing to make it through . Also eliminated were both Force Indias and the second Sauber of Felipe Nasr , though in a respectable eleventh place on the grid . 
 In Q3 , Nico Rosberg ran wide at turn 15 on his first flying lap and lost the chance to seek areas of improvement for his second run . Lewis Hamilton , who was fastest in all three sessions , capitalized on his teammate 's problem and took pole position by over half a second . It was his 39th pole position and his 4th at Albert Park . The rest of the field was more than a second behind Hamilton 's time , with Felipe Massa in the Williams best of the rest in third position . The two Ferraris of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen proved their regained competitiveness by taking fourth and fifth on the grid respectively .

 Since the Manor Marussia cars were unable to make their race debut , there were 18 qualified cars left . Before the race began , Valtteri Bottas was sidelined due to a back injury sustained in qualifying . Both Daniil Kvyat 's Red Bull and Kevin Magnussen 's McLaren failed to make it to the grid as their cars broke down on the out @-@ lap ; Kvyat suffering transmission problems and Magnussen with an engine failure . This left the grid with 15 starters – the lowest number for a season @-@ opening race since 1963 and the lowest overall since the infamous 2005 United States Grand Prix . 
 At the start , Hamilton assumed the lead while a three @-@ car wide tussle at turn one , involving Kimi Räikkönen , Felipe Nasr and Pastor Maldonado , resulted in Maldonado crashing out at turn two and race officials deploying the safety car . The next lap , Romain Grosjean 's car failed thus taking both Lotus cars out of the race . Normal racing resumed on lap four , with Carlos Sainz , Jr. falling back from fifth to his starting position in seventh place after being passed by Nasr and Daniel Ricciardo . Nasr also lost track position after being ordered by his team to relinquish a position for overtaking while still under safety car conditions . 
 Hamilton maintained in the lead until lap 25 , when he pitted for tyres . He resumed the lead from Rosberg after he too had to pit for new tyres . During this series of pitstops , Sebastian Vettel gained a position by passing Felipe Massa for third place . On lap 34 , Max Verstappen retired while in a points @-@ scoring position after his Toro Rosso was engulfed by smoke . On lap 42 , Räikkönen also retired at turn four after a botched pitstop caused his left rear tyre to come loose . This put Jenson Button briefly into the tenth and final points position but for Sergio Pérez quickly passing the McLaren @-@ Honda driver after a race long battle that begun at the start , for last position . 
 From there , the order remained relatively constant with Hamilton going on to take his 34th Grand Prix win . He was followed by Rosberg , Vettel , Massa and Nasr . Completing the point @-@ scorers were Ricciardo , Nico Hülkenberg , Ericsson , Sainz and Pérez . In all , only eleven cars finished the race with Button 's McLaren being the only car to finish outside the points and everyone from sixth position down lapped . 
 Ericsson , Nasr and Sainz all scored their first Formula One points , with Nasr and Sainz doing so on debut . In addition , Nasr achieved the highest placing for a Brazilian driver making their Grand Prix début . 
 = = = Post @-@ race = = = 
 There was satisfaction at Mercedes , with second @-@ placed Nico Rosberg calling it " an awesome start to the season for us as a team " . Rosberg praised Lewis Hamilton 's performance in particular , saying : " He drove like a world champion all weekend , so couldn 't quite beat him but for sure I was trying every single lap , all the way to the maximum , and I will do all year . " 
 The dominant performance by the Mercedes cars sparked controversy in the paddock . Daniel Ricciardo issued apologies to the Australian fans after what he felt was a " boring " race . Red Bull quarreled with their engine manufacturer Renault and lamented the dominance of their rivals , calling for the FIA to step in and apply rule changes to level the field , fearing that the public would lose interest in the sport if nothing happened . Mercedes chief Toto Wolff reacted furiously , telling his rivals to " get your fucking head down and work to sort it out " , but later made it clear that he " didn 't mean the f @-@ word in relation to him " regarding the comments by Christian Horner . Nico Rosberg voiced hopes that their rivals would get closer over the course of the season , saying during the post @-@ race press conference : " I hope we can have a good fight . That would be awesome . " This statement caused amusement from Sebastian Vettel , who replied : " Be honest . Do you really hope so ? Seriously ? You finished 30 seconds ahead of us and you hope it 's going to be closer ? So you hope you slow down ? Is that what you 're saying ? " 
 Sauber was delighted by their performance over the weekend , having picked up 14 points in the very first race , compared to none in the entire previous season . 
 Because Manor Marussia failed to notify the stewards of their inability to field a car , the team was summoned by the FIA to explain why they did not participate in qualifying . However , the hearing provided sufficient evidence to the FIA 's satisfaction that the team would have been unable to field their cars , even if they had violated curfew . Despite this , Ecclestone subsequently announced that Manor Marussia would have to cover their freight charges to and from Australia , costs normally covered by Formula One Management .

 = Richard D 'Oyly Carte = 
 Richard D 'Oyly Carte ( 3 May 1844 – 3 April 1901 ) was an English talent agent , theatrical impresario , composer and hotelier during the latter half of the Victorian era . Rising from humble beginnings , Carte built two of London 's theatres and a hotel empire , while also establishing an opera company that ran continuously for over a hundred years and a management agency representing some of the most important artists of the day . 
 Carte started his career working for his father , Richard Carte , in the music publishing and musical instrument manufacturing business . As a young man , he conducted and composed music , but he soon turned to promoting the entertainment careers of others through his management agency . Carte believed that a school of wholesome , well @-@ crafted , family @-@ friendly , English comic opera could be as popular as the risqué French works dominating the London musical stage in the 1870s . To that end , he brought together the dramatist W. S. Gilbert and composer Arthur Sullivan and , together with his wife Helen Carte , he nurtured their collaboration on a series of thirteen Savoy operas . He founded the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company and built the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art Savoy Theatre to host the Gilbert and Sullivan operas . 
 Carte also built the Savoy Hotel in London , and acquired other luxury hotels . In addition , he erected the Palace Theatre , London , which he had intended to be the home of a new school of English grand opera , although this ambition was not realised beyond the production of a single grand opera by Sullivan , Ivanhoe . Nevertheless , his partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan , and his careful management of their operas and relationship , created a series of works whose success was unprecedented in the history of musical theatre . His opera company , later operated by Helen and then by his son , Rupert , and granddaughter , Bridget , promoted those works for over a century , and they are still performed regularly today . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Carte was born in Greek Street in the West End of London on 3 May 1844 . He was the eldest of six children . His father , Richard Carte ( originally Cart ; 1808 – 1891 ) , was a flautist , and his mother was the former Eliza Jones ( 1814 – 1885 ) ; they had eloped , to the disappointment of her father , Thomas Jones , a clergyman . His siblings were Blanch ( 1846 – 1935 ) , Viola ( 1848 – 1925 ) , Rose ( b . 1854 ) , Henry ( 1856 – 1926 ) and Eliza ( 1860 – 1941 ) . Carte was of Welsh and Norman ancestry ; D 'Oyly is a Norman French name which " was a forename ( not part of a double surname ) " . To supplement his income as a performer , Carte 's father joined the firm of Rudall , Rose & Co . , musical instrument makers and music publishers , in 1850 . After he became a partner in the business , it changed its name to Rudall , Rose , Carte and Co. and later to Rudall , Carte & Co . 
 Carte was brought up in Dartmouth Park Road . His cultured mother exposed her family to art , music and poetry , and young Carte studied the violin and then the flute at an early age . The family spoke French at home two days a week , and his parents often took their children to the theatre . He was educated at University College School , which he left in 1860 . In 1861 , he achieved First Class level in the matriculation examination and then attended University College , London . However , he left later that year to work in his father 's business , along with his brother , Henry . He studied music during this time and composed some pieces , which he dedicated to the actress Kate Terry . He also acted in amateur theatricals . 
 = = Career = = 
 Between 1868 and 1877 , Carte wrote and published the music for a number of his own songs and instrumental works , as well as several comic operas : Doctor <unk> – His Secret , at St. George 's Hall ( 1868 ) ; Marie , with librettist E. Spencer Mott , at London 's Opera Comique in 1871 ; and Happy Hampstead , with librettist Frank Desprez , which debuted on an 1876 provincial tour and then played at the Royalty Theatre in 1877 . On tour in 1871 , Carte conducted Cox and Box by composer Arthur Sullivan and dramatist F. C. Burnand , in tandem with English adaptations of two Offenbach pieces , called Rose of Auvergne and Breaking the Spell , in which Carte 's client Selina Dolaro appeared . Carte 's musical talent would be helpful later in his career , as he was able to audition singers himself from the pianoforte . 
 During the late 1860s and early 1870s , from within his father 's firm in Charing Cross and , by late 1874 , from a nearby address in Craig 's Court , Carte began to build an operatic , concert and lecture management agency . His two hundred clients eventually included Charles Gounod , Jacques Offenbach , Adelina Patti , Mario , Clara Schumann , Antoinette Sterling , Edward Lloyd , Mr. and Mrs. German Reed , George Grossmith , Matthew Arnold , James McNeill Whistler and Oscar Wilde . Hesketh Pearson said of Carte : " His acute business sense was aided by a frank and agreeable manner .... He took what other people thought were risks , but he felt were certainties . He knew everyone worth knowing ... and his practical judgement was as sure as his sense of artistry . " 
 = = = Founding his opera company = = = 
 In 1874 , Carte leased the Opera Comique , a small theatre off the Strand , where he presented a Brussels company in the British premiere of the operetta <unk> @-@ <unk> by Charles Lecocq , followed by The Broken Branch , an English adaptation of Gaston <unk> 's La branche cassée . Carte announced his ambitions on the front of the programme for the latter : " It is my desire to establish in London a permanent abode for light Opera . " The Observer reported , " Mr D 'Oyly Carte is not only a skilful manager , but a trained musician , and he appears to have grasped the fact that the public are beginning to become weary of what is known as a genuine opera bouffe , and are ready to welcome a musical entertainment of a higher order , such as a musician might produce with satisfaction " . 
 Carte later said it was " the scheme of my life " to found a school of high @-@ quality , family @-@ friendly English comic opera , in contrast to the bawdy burlesques and adaptations of French operettas that dominated the London musical stage at that time . His experience in writing operettas , however , had convinced him that his own creative talents were inadequate for the task . He later wrote to dramatist W. S. Gilbert , " I envy your position but I could never attain it . If I could be an author like you I would certainly not be a manager . I am simply the tradesman who sells your works of art . " Furthermore , in 1874 Carte did not yet have the resources to make his idea into reality , and after his season at the Opera Comique , he terminated his lease . In the same year , he arranged for his client , Offenbach , to collaborate with H. B. <unk> to write a new operetta on the theme of Dick Whittington and His Cat , which played during the Christmas season at the Alhambra Theatre . 
 In 1875 , Carte became the business manager of the Royalty Theatre , under the direction of his client , the popular singing actress Madame Selina Dolaro . There he programmed Offenbach 's La Périchole . To fill out the evening ( as long programmes were the fashion in Victorian theatre ) , he needed another piece . He remembered a libretto for a one @-@ act comic opera that W. S. Gilbert had written and shown to him in 1873 , called Trial by Jury . Meanwhile , Sullivan 's popular 1867 opera , Cox and Box , had been revived at the Gaiety Theatre in 1874 , and Carte had already asked him to write a piece for the Royalty . Carte knew that Gilbert had worked with Sullivan to create Thespis in 1871 , and he now suggested that Sullivan could write the music for Trial by Jury . Because Gilbert and Sullivan shared his vision of increasing the quality and respectability of English musical theatre , and so broadening its audience through the promotion of well @-@ crafted English light operas , Carte gave them wider authority as director and music director than was customary at that time . Trial by Jury , a comic treatment of an English courtroom , was an unexpected hit , outrunning La Périchole , and becoming the first step in Carte 's scheme to establish a new genre of English comic opera . 
 Carte managed the first tour of Trial by Jury , which stopped at the Theatre Royal in Dublin , Ireland , in September 1875 . While there , he met a young Scottish actress , Susan Couper Black , who used the stage name Helen Lenoir . She became fascinated by his vision for establishing a company to promote English comic opera and gave up her next engagement to join his theatrical organisation as his secretary . Well @-@ educated , with an organisational ability , business acumen , focus on detail and diplomatic skills that surpassed even Carte 's , Lenoir gradually became intensely involved in all of his business affairs . Carte and Lenoir married in 1888 , three years after the death of his first wife . 
 Even after the initial production of Trial by Jury , however , Carte continued to produce continental operetta , touring in the summer of 1876 with a repertoire consisting of English adaptations of French opera bouffe ( Offenbach ’ s La Périchole , and La Grande @-@ Duchesse de Gérolstein , Lecocq 's La fille de Madame <unk> and Léon Vasseur 's La <unk> d 'argent ) , paired with two one @-@ act English after @-@ pieces ( Happy Hampstead and Trial by Jury ) . Carte acted as the musical director of this travelling company that included W.H. Denny . 
 Encouraged by the success of Trial by Jury , Carte made attempts in 1875 – 76 to raise money for either a revival of Thespis or a new piece . A year later , he finally found four backers and formed the " Comedy Opera Company " to produce the future works of Gilbert and Sullivan , along with the works of other British author / composer teams . This allowed Carte to lease the Opera Comique and to give Gilbert and Sullivan firm terms for a new opera . By this time , Helen Lenoir had been promoted from Carte 's secretary to his assistant . The first comic opera produced by the new company was Gilbert and Sullivan 's The Sorcerer in 1877 , with a plot involving a tradesmanlike London magician and his patented love potion . Gilbert , Sullivan and Carte were able to select their own cast , instead of using the players under contract to the theatre where the work was produced , as had been the case with their earlier works . They chose talented actors , few of whom were well @-@ known stars , and Carte 's agency provided many of the artists . The reception of the piece showed that Carte had been right : there was a promising future in family @-@ friendly English comic opera . 
 The Sorcerer was followed by H.M.S. Pinafore in 1878 . Business for the new opera was slow at first . Carte 's investors in the Comedy Opera Company advocated cutting their losses and closing the show . After promotional efforts by Carte and Sullivan , who included some of the Pinafore music in several promenade concerts at Covent Garden , Pinafore became a hit . Carte persuaded Gilbert and Sullivan that when their original agreement with the Comedy Opera Company expired in July 1879 , a business partnership among the three of them would be to their advantage . The three each put up £ 1 @,@ 000 and formed a new partnership under the name " Mr Richard D 'Oyly Carte 's Opera Company " . Under the partnership agreement , once the expenses of mounting the productions had been deducted , each of the three men was entitled to one third of the profits . 
 On 31 July 1879 , the last day of their agreement with Carte , the directors of the Comedy Opera Company attempted to repossess the Pinafore set by force during a performance , causing a celebrated fracas . Carte 's stagehands managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery and props . The Comedy Opera Company opened a rival production of H.M.S. Pinafore in London , but it was not as popular as the D 'Oyly Carte production and soon closed . Legal action over the ownership of the rights ended in victory for Carte , Gilbert and Sullivan . From 1 August 1879 , the new company , later called the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company , became the sole authorised producer of the works of Gilbert and Sullivan . 
 = = = Early opera successes ; property interests = = = 
 H.M.S. Pinafore was so successful that Carte soon sent two additional companies out to tour in the provinces . The opera ran for 571 performances in London , the second @-@ longest run in musical theatre history up to that time . Over 150 unauthorised productions sprang up in America alone , but because American law then offered no copyright protection to foreigners , Carte , Gilbert and Sullivan were not able to demand royalties from , or to control the artistic content of , these productions . 
 To try to counter this copyright piracy and make some money from the popularity of their opera in America , Carte travelled to New York with the authors and the company to present an " authentic " production of Pinafore there , beginning in December 1879 , as well as American tours . Carte 's assistant , Helen Lenoir , who became his wife in 1888 , made fifteen visits to America in the 1880s and 1890s to promote Carte 's interests , superintending arrangements for American productions and tours of each of the new Gilbert and Sullivan operas . Beginning with Pinafore , Carte licensed the J. C. Williamson company to produce the works in Australia and New Zealand . 
 In an effort to head off unauthorised American productions of their next opera , The Pirates of Penzance , Carte and his partners opened it in New York on 31 December 1879 , prior to its 1880 London premiere . They hoped to forestall further " piracy " by establishing the authorised production and tours in America before others could copy it and by delaying publication of the score and libretto . They did succeed in keeping for themselves the direct profits of the venture , but they tried without success for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas . Pirates was an immediate hit in New York , and later London , becoming one of the most popular Gilbert and Sullivan operas . To secure the British copyright , there was a perfunctory performance the afternoon before the New York premiere , at the Royal Bijou Theatre , Paignton , Devon , organised by Helen Lenoir . 
 The next Gilbert and Sullivan opera , Patience , opened at the Opera Comique in April 1881 and was another big success , usurping Pinafore 's position as the longest running piece in the series with the second @-@ longest run in musical theatre history . Patience satirised the self @-@ indulgent aesthetic movement of the 1870s and ' 80s in England . To popularise the opera in America , in 1882 Carte sent one of the artistes under his management , the young poet Oscar Wilde , on a lecture tour to explain to Americans what the aesthetic movement was about . Carte told an interviewer at that time that he had fifteen theatrical companies and performers touring simultaneously in Europe , America and Australia . 
 Carte had been planning to build a new theatre for several years to promote English comic opera and , in particular , the Gilbert and Sullivan operas . With profits from the Gilbert and Sullivan operas and his concert and lecture agency , he bought property along the Strand in 1880 with frontage onto the Thames Embankment , where he built the Savoy Theatre in 1881 . Carte chose the name in honour of the Savoy Palace , which had been built on the site in the thirteenth century by Peter , Count of Savoy . It later passed to John of Gaunt but was destroyed in the Peasants ' Revolt in 1381 . The Savoy Theatre was a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art facility , setting a new standard for technology , comfort and decor . It was the first public building in the world to be lit entirely by electric lights and seated nearly 1 @,@ 300 people ( compared to the Opera Comique 's 862 ) . 
 Patience was the first production at the new theatre , transferring there on 10 October 1881 . The first generator proved too small to power the whole building , and though the entire front of house was electrically lit , the stage was lit by gas until 28 December 1881 . At that performance , Carte stepped on stage and broke a glowing lightbulb before the audience to demonstrate the safety of the new technology . The Times concluded that the theatre " is admirably adapted for its purpose , its acoustic qualities are excellent , and all reasonable demands of comfort and taste are complied with . " Carte and his manager , George Edwardes ( later famous as manager of the Gaiety Theatre ) , introduced several innovations at the theatre including free programme booklets , the orderly " queue " system with numbered tickets for the pit and gallery ( an American idea ) , tea served at the interval and a policy of no tipping for cloakroom or other services . Daily expenses at the theatre were about half the possible takings from ticket sales . The last eight of Gilbert and Sullivan 's comic operas were premiered at the Savoy , and all of their operas came to be known as Savoy operas . 
 The Savoy Hotel , designed by the architect Thomas Edward <unk> , opened in 1889 . Financed by profits from The Mikado , it was the first hotel lit by electric lights and the first with electric lifts . In the 1890s , under its famous manager , César Ritz , and chef Auguste Escoffier , it became a well @-@ known luxury hotel and would generate more income and contribute more to the D 'Oyly Carte fortunes than any other enterprise , including the opera companies . Carte later acquired and refurbished Claridge 's ( 1893 ) , The Grand Hotel in Rome ( 1896 ) , Simpson 's @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Strand ( 1898 ) and The Berkeley ( 1900 ) . 
 = = = Peak years for the opera company = = = 
 During the years when the Gilbert and Sullivan operas were being written , Richard D 'Oyly Carte also produced operas and plays by other writing teams , as well as other works to fill the Savoy Theatre in between new operas . Many of these were companion pieces to the Gilbert and Sullivan operas , as the Victorian audiences preferred long evenings in the theatre . Some , however , were new full @-@ length pieces either for the Savoy or for Carte 's touring companies , which toured the Gilbert and Sullivan operas , and these new works , extensively . Carte and Lenoir also continued to run his management agency . As an example of their level of activity , an 1881 souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of Patience in London and its 100th performance in New York states that , in addition to these two productions of Patience , Carte was simultaneously producing many other projects . These included two companies touring with Patience , two touring with other Gilbert and Sullivan operas , one touring with the operetta Olivette ( co @-@ produced with Charles Wyndham ) , one with Claude Duval in America , a production of Youth running at a New York theatre , a lecture tour by Archibald Forbes ( a war correspondent ) and productions of Patience , Pirates , Claude Duval and Billee Taylor in association with J. C. Williamson in Australia , among other things . 
 Carte also introduced the practice of licensing amateur theatrical societies to present works for which he held the rights , increasing the works ' popularity and the sales of scores and libretti , as well as the rental of band parts . This had an important influence on amateur theatre in general . Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that , prior to the creation of the Savoy operas , amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals . After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies licensed to perform the operas , professionals recognised that the amateur societies " support the culture of music and the drama . They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage , and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present @-@ day favourites . " Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to " the popularity of , and infectious craze for performing , the Gilbert and Sullivan operas " . The National Operatic and Dramatic Association was founded in 1899 . It reported , in 1914 , that nearly 200 British societies were producing Gilbert and Sullivan operas that year . 
 After Patience , Carte produced Iolanthe , which opened in 1882 . During its run , in February 1883 , Carte signed a five @-@ year partnership agreement with Gilbert and Sullivan , obliging them to create new operas for him upon six months ' notice . Sullivan had not intended to immediately write a new work with Gilbert , but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in November 1882 and must have felt the long @-@ term contract necessary for his security . Gilbert scholar Andrew Crowther comments , " Effectively , [ the contract ] made [ Gilbert and Sullivan ] Carte 's employees – a situation which created its own resentments . " The partnership 's next opera , Princess Ida , opened in January 1884 . Carte soon saw that Ida was running weakly at the box office and invoked the agreement to call upon his partners to write a new opera . The musical establishment constantly pressured Sullivan to abandon comic opera in favour of serious music , and after he was knighted in 1883 , the pressure only increased . He soon regretted having signed the five @-@ year contract . In March 1884 , Sullivan told Carte that " it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself . " 
 During this conflict and others during the 1880s , Carte and Helen Lenoir frequently worked to smooth over the partners ' differences using a mixture of friendship and business acumen . Sullivan asked to be released from the partnership on several occasions . Nevertheless , Carte was able to coax eight comic operas out of his partners in the 1880s . When Princess Ida closed after a comparatively short run of nine months , for the first time in the partnership 's history , the next opera was not ready . Gilbert first suggested a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge – a scenario that Sullivan had previously rejected . Gilbert eventually came up with a new idea and began work in May 1884 . 
 Carte produced the first revival of The Sorcerer , together with Trial by Jury , and matinees of The Pirates of Penzance played by a cast of children , while he waited for his partners to finish writing the new work . This became the partnership 's most successful opera , The Mikado , which opened in March 1885 . The piece satirised British institutions by setting them in a fictional Japan and took advantage of the Victorian craze for the exotic and " picturesque " Far East . The Mikado became the partnership 's longest @-@ running hit , lasting for 672 performances at the Savoy Theatre , and supplanting Patience as the second @-@ longest @-@ running work of musical theatre up to that time . It was extraordinarily popular in the US and worldwide and remains the most frequently performed Savoy Opera . 
 The partnership 's next opera was Ruddigore , which opened in January 1887 . The piece , though a financial success , was a relative disappointment after the extraordinary run of The Mikado . When Ruddigore closed after nine months , Carte mounted revivals of earlier Gilbert and Sullivan operas at the Savoy for almost a year . After another attempt by Gilbert to persuade Sullivan to set a " lozenge plot " , Gilbert met his collaborator half way by writing a serio @-@ comic plot for The Yeomen of the Guard , which premiered in October 1888 . The opera ran for over a year , with strong New York and touring productions . This was a happy time for Carte , with a long @-@ running opera , new marriage and new hotel and opera house under construction . When Carte asked his partners for a new work , Sullivan again expressed reluctance to write another comic opera , asking if Gilbert would write a " dramatic work on a larger musical scale " . Gilbert declined but offered a compromise that Sullivan ultimately accepted : the two would write a light opera for the Savoy , and at the same time , Sullivan could work on a grand opera that Carte would produce at a new theatre he was planning to build to present British grand opera . The new comic opera was The Gondoliers , which opened in December 1889 and became one of the partnership 's greatest successes . 
 During these years , Carte was not just the manager of the theatre . He was a full participant in the producing partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan , involved in casting and finding designers ; in charge of publicity ; directing and hiring designers for the non @-@ Gilbert works , including the many companion pieces ( sometimes with the help of assistants ) ; and casting , directing and rehearsing the touring companies , among other duties . According to Henry Lytton , " Mr. Carte was a great stage manager . He could take in the details of a scene with one sweep of his eagle eye and say unerringly just what was wrong . " The quality of Carte 's productions created a national and international taste for them , and he sent touring companies throughout the British provinces , to America ( generally managed by Helen ) , Europe and elsewhere . Queen Victoria honoured the company by calling for a Royal Command Performance of The Gondoliers at Windsor Castle in 1891 . Following the libretto closely , she noticed additions to the text made by some of the actors and asked Carte to explain why this was done . Carte replied that they " are what we call ' gags ' " . The queen answered that she had always understood that " gags were things that were put by authority into people 's mouths . " Carte rejoined , " These gags , Your Majesty , are things people put into their own mouths without authority . " George Bernard Shaw , writing in The World in October 1893 , stated : 
 Those who are old enough to compare the Savoy performances with those of the dark ages , taking into account the pictorial treatment of the fabrics and colors on the stage , the cultivation and intelligence of the choristers , the quality of the orchestra , and the degree of artistic good breeding , so to speak , expected from the principals , best know how great an advance has been made by Mr. D 'Oyly Carte . 
 = = = End of the partnership and last years = = = 
 On 22 April 1890 , during the run of The Gondoliers , Gilbert discovered that maintenance expenses for the theatre , including a new £ 500 carpet for the front lobby of the theatre , were being charged to the partnership instead of borne by Carte . Gilbert angrily confronted Carte , but Carte refused to reconsider the accounts . Even though the amount of the charge was not great , Gilbert felt that it was a moral issue involving Carte 's integrity , and he could not look past it . Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that " I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen " . Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte " in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial . " Matters deteriorated further , and Gilbert brought a lawsuit . Sullivan sided with Carte , who was building the Royal English Opera House , the inaugural production of which was to be Sullivan 's forthcoming grand opera . Gilbert won the dispute and felt vindicated , but his actions had been hurtful to his partners , and the partnership disbanded . 
 Carte 's first production at the Royal English Opera House was of Sullivan 's only grand opera , Ivanhoe , which opened in January 1891 . It played for an initial run of 155 performances , a record for an opera , but no other operas shared the new opera house with it . Instead , Ivanhoe was presented every night with alternating casts . When Ivanhoe finally closed in July , Carte had no new work ready to play at the opera house , and so it had to close . The opera house re @-@ opened in November 1891 with André Messager 's La Basoche at first alternating in repertory with Ivanhoe , and then La Basoche played alone , closing in January 1892 . Carte again had no new opera to present at the house , and the venture soon failed . Sir Henry Wood , who had been répétiteur for the production , recalled in his autobiography , " If D 'Oyly Carte had had a repertory of six operas instead of only one , I believe he would have established English opera in London for all time . Towards the end of the run of Ivanhoe I was already preparing The Flying Dutchman with Eugène Oudin in the name part . He would have been superb . However , plans were altered and the Dutchman was shelved . " Carte leased the theatre to Sarah Bernhardt for a season and finally abandoned the project . He sold the opera house at a loss to producer Augustus Harris . It was then converted into a music hall , the Palace Theatre of Varieties , and later became the Palace Theatre . 
 Because of the carpet quarrel , Gilbert had vowed to write no more for the Savoy . When The Gondoliers closed in 1891 , Carte needed new authors and composers to write works for the Savoy Theatre . He turned to old friends George Dance , Frank Desprez and Edward Solomon for his next piece , The Nautch Girl , which ran for a satisfying 200 performances in 1891 – 92 . Carte then revived Solomon and Sydney Grundy 's The Vicar of Bray , which ran through the summer of 1892 . Next came Grundy and Sullivan 's Haddon Hall , which held the stage until April 1893 . While Carte presented new pieces and revivals at the Savoy , his touring companies continued to play throughout Britain and in America . In 1894 , for example , Carte had four companies touring Britain and one playing in America . 
 Gilbert 's aggressive , though successful , legal action had embittered Carte and Sullivan , but the partnership had been so profitable that Carte and his wife eventually sought to reunite the author and composer . After several attempts by the Cartes , the reconciliation finally came through the efforts of Tom Chappell , who published the sheet music to their operas . In 1893 , Gilbert and Sullivan produced their penultimate collaboration , Utopia , Limited . While Utopia was being prepared , Carte produced Jane Annie , by J. M. Barrie and Arthur Conan Doyle , with music by Ernest Ford . Despite the popularity of Barrie and Conan Doyle , the show was a flop , closing after only 51 performances . 
 Utopia was Carte 's most expensive production to date , but it ran for a comparatively disappointing 245 performances , until June 1894 . Carte then played first Mirette , composed by André Messager , then The Chieftain , by F. C. Burnand and Sullivan . These ran for 102 and 97 performances , respectively . The company then toured the London suburbs , and the theatre was dark during the summer of 1895 , reopening in November for a revival of The Mikado . This was followed in 1896 by The Grand Duke , which ran for 123 performances and was Gilbert and Sullivan 's only financial failure . The Gondoliers turned out to be Gilbert and Sullivan 's last big hit , and after The Grand Duke , the two men never collaborated again . At the Savoy , Carte produced His Majesty ( 1897 ) , The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein ( 1897 ) , The Beauty Stone ( 1898 ) and The Lucky Star ( 1899 ) , as well as revivals of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas . 
 Though the 1890s brought Carte more disappointments than hits in the theatre , his hotel business prospered and grew . He acquired Simpson 's @-@ in @-@ the @-@ Strand and Claridge 's Hotel , both of which he entirely rebuilt . There was one grave setback , in 1897 , when he had to dismiss his manager , Ritz , and his star chef , Escoffier , for financial misconduct . Carte 's choice as successor to Ritz was George Reeves @-@ Smith , manager and part @-@ owner of the Berkeley Hotel . To secure his services , Carte bought the Berkeley in 1900 and promoted Reeves @-@ Smith to be managing director of the whole Savoy Group . Carte had used the same method , a year earlier , to secure a new maître d 'hôtel . He was determined to engage M. Joseph , proprietor of the Marivaux Restaurant in Paris , then at the height of its fame . Carte was seriously ill , but he insisted on being carried to the boat @-@ train . In Paris he bought the Marivaux and returned with Joseph to the Savoy . 
 Throughout the later 1890s , Carte 's health was in decline , and Helen assumed more and more of the responsibilities for the opera company . She profitably managed the theatre and the provincial touring companies . In 1894 , Carte had hired his son , Rupert , as an assistant . While Carte was ill , in 1897 , Rupert assisted Mrs. Carte and W. S. Gilbert with the first revival of The Yeomen of the Guard at the Savoy . The Savoy put on a number of shows for comparatively short runs during this period , including Sullivan 's The Beauty Stone , which ran for only 50 performances , in 1898 . In 1899 , Carte finally had a new success with Sullivan and Basil Hood 's The Rose of Persia , which ran for 213 performances . Neither Carte nor Sullivan lived to see the production of the next piece by Hood , The Emerald Isle , for which Edward German completed Sullivan 's unfinished score .

 Carte was married twice . His first wife was Blanche Julia Prowse ( 1853 – 1885 ) , the daughter of William Prowse , a piano manufacturer , music publisher and booking agent . As a teenager , she had participated in amateur theatricals with Carte . They married in 1870 and had two sons , Lucas ( 1872 – 1907 ) and Rupert . Blanche died of pneumonia in 1885 , and in 1888 , Carte married his assistant , Helen . Their wedding took place in the Savoy Chapel , with Arthur Sullivan as the best man . Rupert received training in an accounting firm and then became his father 's assistant in 1894 . Lucas , who was not involved in the family businesses , became a barrister . He was appointed Private Secretary to Lord Chief Justice Charles Russell in 1899 in connection with the Venezuelan boundary arbitration in Paris . There he contracted tuberculosis and later died of that disease at the age of 34 . 
 Carte 's London house was at the Adelphi , not far from the Savoy . Passionate about the visual arts as well as the performing arts , Carte invited his friend , the artist James McNeill Whistler , to decorate the house . Whistler had the entire billiard room painted the colour of the billiard cloth , and elsewhere painted his favourite yellow with his own hand . Equally enthusiastic for technological innovation , Carte installed a lift , the first in a private house in England . Around 1890 , he bought a small island in the River Thames , between Weybridge and Shepperton , called Folly Eyot , which he renamed D 'Oyly Carte Island . He wanted to use the island as an annex to his new Savoy Hotel , but the local authorities refused to grant him a drinks licence for the property . Instead , he built Eyot House , a large house and garden on the island , that he used as a residence . In later years , Carte displayed his macabre sense of humour by keeping a crocodile on the island .

 Carte died at his London home from dropsy and heart disease in 1901 , just short of his 57th birthday . He is buried in the churchyard of St. Andrew 's church in Fairlight , East Sussex , near his parents ' graves . A memorial service was held at the Chapel Royal of the Savoy , where a memorial stained glass window was later dedicated to him . He left an estate valued at £ 250 @,@ 000 . 
 Carte was instrumental in bringing the British theatre from its low status in the mid @-@ Victorian age to a position of respectable eminence , with knighthoods for actors , such as Henry Irving , and for dramatists , including Gilbert . George Bernard Shaw wrote of Carte 's theatrical legacy , " Mr D 'Oyly Carte founded a new school of English comic opera ; raised operatic <unk> to the rank of a fine art ; and finally built a new English Opera House and made a magnificent effort to do for English grand opera what he had done for comic opera . " In Carte 's obituary , The Times noted , " By his refined taste he raised the reputation of the mise en scène of the Savoy operas to a very high pitch . He set a high standard " . Beyond this , however , Carte 's influence , through the production of the Savoy operas , heavily influenced the course of the development of modern musical theatre . 
 Carte was also a prime mover in making hotels respectable and respected : in the words of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography : " Led by the prince of Wales [ the Savoy ] became the meeting place for London high society and the nouveaux riches of the British empire .... [ The ] food and the ambience lured people from the clubs to dine in public and give great parties there . It allowed ladies , hitherto fearful of dining in public , to be seen in full regalia in the Savoy dining and supper rooms . " 
 Carte left the theatre , opera company , hotels and his other business interests to Helen . Her London and touring companies continued to present the Savoy Operas in Britain and overseas . In 1901 she leased the Savoy Theatre to William Greet , overseeing his management of a revival of Iolanthe and several new comic operas . Rupert became chairman of the Savoy Hotel by 1903 , which Helen continued to own . In late 1906 , Helen staged a Gilbert and Sullivan repertory season at the Savoy Theatre . The season , and the following one , which were both directed by Gilbert , earned excellent reviews and sold well , revitalising the company . After the second repertory season concluded in 1909 , however , the company did not perform in London again until 1919 , only touring throughout Britain during that time . 
 At her death in 1913 , Helen passed the family businesses to Carte 's son , Rupert . He maintained the hotel business , disposing of the Grand Hotel in Rome , but expanding the group in London . The Savoy Group remained under the control of the Carte family and its associates until 1994 . Carte 's hotels have remained among the most prestigious in London , with the London Evening Standard calling the Savoy " London 's most famous hotel " in 2009 . 
 Rupert D 'Oyly Carte refreshed the opera company 's productions and added London seasons , beginning in 1919 , as well as provincial and foreign tours . In 1948 Rupert died , leaving a strong company to his daughter Bridget D 'Oyly Carte . However , the rising costs of mounting professional light opera without any government support eventually became too much for the company . Bridget was forced to close the company in 1982 . Nevertheless , the Gilbert and Sullivan operas continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English @-@ speaking world and beyond , and Carte 's vision of wholesome light operas that celebrate Great Britain endures .
