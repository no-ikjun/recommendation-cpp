 Each year during the Mormon migration , people continued to be organized into " companies " , each company bearing the name of its leader and subdivided into groups of 10 and 50 . The Saints traveled the trail broken by the vanguard company , splitting the journey into two sections . The first segment began in Nauvoo and ended in Winter Quarters , near modern @-@ day Omaha , Nebraska . The second half of the journey took the Saints through the area that later became Nebraska and Wyoming , before finishing their journey in the Salt Lake Valley in present @-@ day Utah . The earlier groups used covered wagons pulled by oxen to carry their supplies across the country . Some later companies used handcarts and traveled by foot . 
 By 1849 , many of the Latter @-@ day Saints who remained in Iowa or Missouri were poor and unable to afford the costs of the wagon , teams of oxen , and supplies that would be required for the trip . Therefore , the LDS Church established a revolving fund , known as the Perpetual Emigration Fund , to enable the poor to emigrate . By 1852 , most of the Latter @-@ day Saints from Nauvoo who wished to emigrate had done so , and the church abandoned its settlements in Iowa . However , many church members from the eastern states and from Europe continued to emigrate to Utah , often assisted by the Perpetual Emigration Fund . 
 = = = Handcarts : 1856 – 60 = = = 
 In 1856 , the church inaugurated a system of handcart companies in order to enable poor European emigrants to make the trek more cheaply . Handcarts , two @-@ wheeled carts that were pulled by emigrants instead of draft animals , were sometimes used as an alternate means of transportation from 1856 to 1860 . They were seen as a faster , easier , and cheaper way to bring European converts to Salt Lake City . Almost 3 @,@ 000 Mormons , with 653 carts and 50 supply wagons , traveling in 10 different companies , made the trip over the trail to Salt Lake City . While not the first to use handcarts , they were the only group to use them extensively . 
 The handcarts were modeled after carts used by street sweepers and were made almost entirely of wood . They were generally six to seven feet ( 183 to 213 cm ) long , wide enough to span a narrow wagon track , and could be alternately pushed or pulled . The small boxes affixed to the carts were three to four feet ( 91 to 122 cm ) long and eight inches ( 20 cm ) high . They could carry about 500 pounds ( 227 kg ) , most of this weight consisting of trail provisions and a few personal possessions . 
 All but two of the handcart companies successfully completed the rugged journey , with relatively few problems and only a few deaths . However , the fourth and fifth companies , known as the Willie and Martin Companies , respectively , had serious problems . The companies left Iowa City , Iowa , in July 1856 , very late to begin the trip across the plains . They met severe winter weather west of present @-@ day Casper , Wyoming , and continued to cope with deep snow and storms for the remainder of the journey . Food supplies were soon exhausted . Young organized a rescue effort that brought the companies in , but more than 210 of the 980 emigrants in the two parties died . 
 The handcart companies continued with more success until 1860 , and traditional ox @-@ and @-@ wagon companies also continued for those who could afford the higher cost . After 1860 , the church began sending wagon companies east each spring , to return to Utah in the summer with the emigrating Latter @-@ day Saints . Finally , with the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869 , future emigrants were able to travel by rail , and the era of the Mormon pioneer trail came to an end . 
 = = Sites along the trail = = 
 The following are major points along the trail at which the early Mormon pioneers stopped , established temporary camps , or used as landmarks and meeting places . The sites are categorized by their location in respect to modern @-@ day US states . 
 = = = Illinois = = = 
 Nauvoo — Nauvoo was the starting point for the Mormon trail and the early home base for LDS migrants . They left because they were treated poorly by those whom lived there . Brigham Young took a group of people through Illinois to Utah , the non part of the United States 
 = = = Iowa = = = 
 Sugar Creek ( 7 miles ( 11 km ) west of Nauvoo ) — Beginning with their first ferry crossing of the Mississippi River on February 4 , 1846 , months before many of them were ready , the Latter @-@ day Saints started gathering at the frozen banks of Sugar Creek . More refugees continued to cross into Iowa for a number of months many taking advantage of the freezing of the Mississippi river a few weeks later . The poorly prepared emigrants suffered from severe winter weather while camped there . Sugar Creek was the staging area for the westward trek across Iowa . Ultimately about 2 @,@ 500 refugees and 500 wagons started west on March 1 , 1846 . Several thousand more would follow on later as they sold their property for what they could get and continued to leave Nauvoo , Illinois . 
 Richardson 's Point ( 35 miles ( 56 km ) west ) — The emigrants made their way past Croton and Farmington to ford the Des Moines River at Bonaparte . In early March 1846 the party was halted for 10 days by heavy rain at a wooded area known as Richardson 's Point . Some of the first deaths of the pioneers occurred at this location . 
 Chariton River Crossing ( 80 miles ( 129 km ) west ) — The trail continues past the modern towns of Troy , <unk> , and West Grove to reach the Chariton River . At this crossing , on March 27 , Young organized the lead group of the migration , forming three camps of 100 families , each led by a captain . This military @-@ style organization would be used for all subsequent Mormon emigrant companies . 
 Locust Creek ( 103 miles ( 166 km ) west ) — The trail proceeds past Cincinnati to Locust Creek . There on April 13 William Clayton , scribe for Brigham Young , composed " Come , Come Ye Saints , " the most famous and enduring hymn from the Mormon Trail . 
 Garden Grove ( 128 miles ( 206 km ) west ) — On April 23 the emigrants arrived at the location of their first semi @-@ permanent settlement , which they named Garden Grove . They enclosed and planted 715 acres ( 2 @.@ 89 km2 ) to supply food for later emigrants and established a village that is still in existence today . About 600 Latter @-@ day Saints settled at Garden Grove . By 1852 they had moved on to Utah . 
 Mount Pisgah ( 153 miles ( 246 km ) west ) — As they entered Potawatomi territory , the emigrants established another semi @-@ permanent settlement that they named Mount Pisgah . Several thousand acres were cultivated and a settlement of about 700 Latter @-@ day Saints thrived there from 1846 to 1852 . Now the site is marked by a 9 @-@ acre ( 36 @,@ 000 m2 ) park , which contains exhibits , historical markers , and a reconstructed log cabin . However , little remains from the 19th century except a cemetery memorializing the 300 to 800 emigrants who died there . 
 Nishnabotna River Crossing ( 232 miles ( 373 km ) west ) — From Mount Pisgah the trail proceeds past the modern towns of Orient , Bridgewater , Massena and Lewis . Just west of Lewis , the 1846 emigrants passed a Potawatomi encampment on the Nishnabotna River . The Potawatomis were also refugees ; 1846 was their last year in the area . 
 Grand Encampment ( 255 miles ( 410 km ) west ) — From the Nishnabotna River , the trail proceeds past present @-@ day Macedonia to Mosquito Creek on the eastern outskirts of present @-@ day Council Bluffs . The first emigrant company arrived on June 13 , 1846 . At this open area , where the Iowa School for the Deaf is now located , the LDS emigrant companies paused and camped , forming what was called the Grand Encampment . From this site on July 20 , the Mormon Battalion departed for the Mexican @-@ American War . 
 Kanesville ( later Council Bluffs ) ( 265 miles ( 426 km ) west ) — The emigrants established an important settlement and outfitting point at this site on the Missouri River , originally known as Miller 's Hollow . The emigrants renamed the settlement as Kanesville , honoring Thomas L. Kane , a non @-@ LDS attorney who was politically well connected and used his influence to assist the Latter @-@ day Saints . From 1846 to 1852 , it was an important LDS settlement and the outfitting point for companies traveling to present @-@ day Utah . Orson Hyde , an Apostle and ecclesiastical leader of the settlement , published a newspaper called the Frontier Guardian . In 1852 the major LDS settlements at Kanesville , Mount Pisgah , and Garden Grove were closed as the settlers moved on to Utah . After 1852 , however , the Church continued to outfit and supply emigrant companies ( mostly LDS converts coming from the British Isles and mainland Europe ) at this community , now renamed Council Bluffs , until the mid @-@ 1860s , when the terminus of the First Transcontinental Railroad was extended to the west . 
 = = = Nebraska = = = 
 Winter Quarters ( 266 miles ( 428 km ) west ) — Although Brigham Young had originally planned to travel all the way to the Salt Lake Valley in 1846 , the emigrants ' lack of preparation had become apparent during their difficult crossing of Iowa . Furthermore , the departure of the Mormon Battalion left the emigrants short on manpower . Young decided to settle for the winter along the Missouri River . The emigrants were located on both sides of the river , but their settlement at Winter Quarters on the west side was the largest . There they built 700 dwellings where an estimated 3 @,@ 500 Latter @-@ day Saints spent the winter of 1846 – 47 ; many would also reside there during the winter of 1847 – 48 . Conditions such as scurvy , consumption , chills and fever were common ; the settlement recorded 359 deaths between September 1846 and May 1848 . However , while at Winter Quarters the LDS emigrants were able to save or trade for the equipment and supplies that they would need to continue the westward trek . The settlement was later renamed Florence and is now located in Omaha . 
 Elkhorn River ( 293 miles ( 472 km ) west ) 
 Platte River ( 305 miles ( 491 km ) west ) — All emigrants leaving Missouri traveled along the Great Platte River Road for hundreds of miles . There was a prevailing opinion that the North side of the river was healthier , so most Latter @-@ day Saints generally stuck to that side , which also separated them from unpleasant encounters with potential former enemies , like emigrants from Missouri or Illinois . In 1849 , 1850 & 1852 , traffic was so heavy along the Platte that virtually all feed was stripped from both sides of the river . The lack of food and the threat of disease made the journey along the Platte a deadly gamble . 
 Loup Fork ( 352 miles ( 566 km ) west ) — Crossing the Loup Fork was , like the Elkhorn , one of the early and very difficult crossings during the trek west from Council Bluffs . 
 Fort Kearny ( 469 miles ( 755 km ) west ) — This fort , named after Stephen Watts Kearny , was established in June 1848 . Another fort named after Kearny was established in May 1846 , but was abandoned in May 1848 . Due to this , the second Fort Kearny is sometimes called New Fort Kearny . The site for the fort was purchased from the Pawnee Indians for $ 2 @,@ 000 in goods . 
 Confluence Point ( 563 miles ( 906 km ) west ) — On May 11 , 1847 , three @-@ fourths of a mile north of the confluence of the North and South Platte Rivers , a " <unk> " was attached to Heber C. Kimball 's wagon driven by Pilo Johnson . Although they did not invent the device , the measurements of the version they used were accurate enough to be used by William Clayton in his famous Latter @-@ day Saints ' Emigrants ' Guide . 
 Ash Hollow ( 646 miles ( 1 @,@ 040 km ) west ) — Many passing diarists noted the beauty of Ash Hollow , although this was ruined by thousands of passing emigrants . The Sioux Indians were often on location and were at the site and General William S. Harney 's troops won a battle over the Sioux there in September 1855 — the Battle of Ash Hollow . The site is also the burial ground of many who died of cholera during the gold rush years . 
 Chimney Rock ( 718 miles ( 1 @,@ 156 km ) west ) — Chimney Rock is perhaps the most significant landmark on the Mormon Trail . Emigrants commented in their diaries that the landmark appeared closer than it actually was , and many sketched or painted it in their journals and carved their names into it . 
 Scotts Bluff ( 738 miles ( 1 @,@ 188 km ) west ) — Hiram Scott was a Rocky Mountain Fur Company trapper abandoned on the bluff that now bears his name by his companions when he became ill . Accounts of his death are noted by almost all those who kept journals that traveled on the north side of the Platte . The grave of Rebecca Winters , a Latter @-@ day Saint mother who fell victim to cholera in 1852 , is also located near this site , although it has since been moved and rededicated . 
 = = = Wyoming = = = 
 Fort Laramie ( 788 miles ( 1 @,@ 268 km ) west ) — This old trading and military post served as a place for the emigrants to rest and restock provisions . The 1856 Willie Handcart Company was unable to obtain provisions at Fort Laramie , contributing to their subsequent tragedy when they ran out of food while encountering blizzard conditions along the Sweetwater River . 
 Upper Platte / Mormon Ferry ( 914 miles ( 1 @,@ 471 km ) west ) — The last crossing of the Platte River took place near modern Casper . For several years the Latter @-@ day Saints operated a commercial ferry at the site , earning revenue from the <unk> and California @-@ bound emigrants . The ferry was discontinued in 1853 after a competing toll bridge was constructed . On October 19 , 1856 , the Martin Handcart Company forded the freezing river in mid @-@ October , leading to exposure that would prove fatal to many members of the company . 
 Red Butte ( 940 miles ( 1 @,@ 513 km ) west ) — Red Butte was the most tragic site of the Mormon Trail . After crossing the Platte River , the Martin Handcart Company camped near Red Butte as heavy snow fell . Snow continued to fall for three days , and the company came to a halt as many emigrants died . For nine days the company remained there , while 56 persons died from cold or disease . Finally , on October 28 , an advance team of three men from the Utah rescue party reached them . The rescuers encouraged them that help was on the way and urged the company to start moving on . 
 Sweetwater River ( 964 miles ( 1 @,@ 551 km ) west ) — From the last crossing of the Platte , the trail heads directly southwest toward Independence Rock , where it meets and follows the Sweetwater River to South Pass . To shorten the journey by avoiding the twists and turns of the river , the trail includes nine river crossings . 
 Independence Rock ( 965 miles ( 1 @,@ 553 km ) west ) — Independence Rock was one of the trail 's best known and most anticipated landmarks . Many emigrants carved their names on the rock ; many of these carvings are still visible today . The emigrants sometimes also celebrated their arrival at this landmark with a dance . 
 Devil 's Gate ( 970 miles ( 1 @,@ 561 km ) west ) — Devil 's Gate was a narrow gorge cut through the rocks by the Sweetwater River . A small fort was located at Devil 's Gate , which was unoccupied in 1856 when the Martin Handcart Company was rescued . The rescuers unloaded unnecessary equipment from the wagons so the weaker handcart emigrants could ride . A group of 19 men , led by Daniel W. Jones , stayed at the fort over the winter to protect the property . 
 Martin 's Cove ( 993 miles ( 1 @,@ 598 km ) west ) — On November 4 , 1856 , the Martin Handcart Company set up camp in Martin 's Cove as another blizzard halted their progress . They remained there for five days until the weather abated and they could proceed toward Salt Lake City . Today , a visitor 's center is located on the site . 
 Rocky Ridge ( 1 @,@ 038 miles ( 1 @,@ 670 km ) west ) — Between the fifth and sixth crossings of the Sweetwater , on October 19 , 1856 , the Willie Handcart Company was halted by the same snowstorm that stopped the Martin Handcart Company near Red Butte . At the same time , the members of the Willie Company reached the end of their supplies of flour . A small advance team from the rescue party found their camp and gave them a small amount of flour , but then pushed on to the east to try to locate the Martin Company . Captain James Willie and Joseph Elder went ahead through the snow to find the main rescue party and inform them of the Willie Company 's peril . On October 23 , with the help of the rescue party , the Willie Company pushed ahead through the biting wind and snow up Rocky Ridge , a rough 5 @-@ mile ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) section of the trail that ascends to a ridge in order to bypass a section of the Sweetwater River valley that is impassable . 
 Rock Creek ( 1 @,@ 048 miles ( 1 @,@ 687 km ) west ) — After their grueling 18 @-@ hour trek up Rocky Ridge , the Willie Handcart Company camped at the crossing of Rock Creek . That night 13 emigrants died ; the next morning their bodies were buried in a shallow grave . 
 South Pass ( Continental Divide ) ( 1 @,@ 065 miles ( 1 @,@ 714 km ) west ) — South Pass , a 20 @-@ mile ( 32 km ) wide pass across the Continental Divide , is located between the modern towns of Atlantic City and Farson . At an elevation of 7 @,@ 550 feet ( 2 @,@ 300 m ) above sea level , it was one of the most important landmarks of the Mormon Trail . Near South Pass is Pacific Springs , which received its name because its waters ran to the Pacific Ocean . 
 Green River / Lombard Ferry ( 1 @,@ 128 miles ( 1 @,@ 815 km ) west ) — The trail crosses the Green River between the modern towns of Farson and Granger . The Latter @-@ day Saints operated a ferry at this location to assist the church 's emigrants and to earn money from other emigrants traveling to Oregon and California . 
 Ft . Bridger ( 1 @,@ 183 miles ( 1 @,@ 904 km ) west ) — Fort Bridger was established in 1842 by famous mountain man Jim Bridger . This was the site where the paths of the Oregon Trail , the California Trail , and the Mormon Trail separated ; the three trails ran in parallel from Missouri River to Fort Bridger . In 1855 , the LDS Church bought the fort from Jim Bridger and Louis Vazquez for $ 8 @,@ 000 . During the Utah War in 1857 , the Utah militia burned down the fort so that it would not fall into the hands of the advancing U.S. Army under General A.S. Johnston . 
 Bear River Crossing ( 1 @,@ 216 miles ( 1 @,@ 957 km ) west ) — At this , one of the last river crossings on the Mormon Trail , Lansford Hastings and his company turned north , while the Reed – Donner Company turned south . Also at this site , the vanguard company met mountaineer Miles Goodyear on July 10 , 1847 , who attempted to persuade them to take the northern track toward his trading post . 
 The Needles ( 1 @,@ 236 miles ( 1 @,@ 989 km ) west ) — Near this very prominent rock formation , close to the Utah – Wyoming border , Brigham Young became ill with what was probably Rocky Mountain spotted fever during the advance push into the Salt Lake Valley . 
 = = = Utah = = = 
 Echo Canyon ( 1 @,@ 246 miles ( 2 @,@ 005 km ) west ) — One of the last canyons through which the emigrants descended , this deep and narrow canyon made it a veritable , and frequently noted , echo chamber . 
 Big Mountain ( 1 @,@ 279 miles ( 2 @,@ 058 km ) west ) — Although dwarfed by the surrounding Wasatch mountain peaks , this was the highest elevation of the entire Mormon trail at 8 @,@ 400 feet ( 2560 m ) . 
 Golden Pass Road ( 1 @,@ 281 miles ( 2 @,@ 062 km ) west ) — Although unsuccessful in a petition to Salt Lake City for funding , Parley P. Pratt obtained the deed to the canyon and began the construction of a road through Big Canyon Creek in the Wasatch Mountains just south of Emigration Canyon in July 1849 . The canyon became known as Parley 's Canyon and the road he built as the " Golden Pass Road , " due to the large number of gold miners who used it on their way to California . A cutoff was constructed through Silver Creek Canyon by 1862 , diverting much of the traffic on what is today the route of I @-@ 80 . 
 Emigration Canyon ( Donner Hill ) ( 1 @,@ 283 miles ( 2 @,@ 065 km ) west ) — About a year before the Latter @-@ day Saint emigrants , the Reed – Donner wagon train carved the first road through the final geographic obstacle between Big Mountain and the Salt Lake Valley . About halfway through , the group changed course and went up and around the final constriction near the valley 's mouth . The resulting exhaustingly brutal climb over rock and sage most likely contributed to the historic tragedy that befell the travelers three months and 600 miles ( 970 km ) to the west . When an advance team from the Latter @-@ day Saint vanguard company came through , it chose to stick to the valley floor and hacked its way through to the bench overlooking the Great Salt Lake basin in less than four hours . 
 Salt Lake Valley ( 1 @,@ 297 miles ( 2 @,@ 087 km ) west ) — Although the Salt Lake Valley had a special meaning to each emigrant , signifying the end of more than a year of crossing the plains , not all of the pioneering Saints settled in the Salt Lake Valley . Settlement outside the Salt Lake Valley began as early as 1848 , with a number of communities planted in the Weber valley to the north . Additional townsites were carefully chosen , with settlements placed near canyon mouths with access to dependable streams and stands of timber . Latter @-@ day Saints founded more than 600 communities from Canada down into Mexico . As historian Wallace Stegner stated , the Latter @-@ day Saints " were one of the principal forces in the settlement of the West . " 
 = IFK Göteborg = 
 <unk> <unk> Göteborg , commonly known as IFK Göteborg , is a Swedish professional football club based in Gothenburg . Founded on 4 October 1904 , it is the only club in the Nordic countries that has won a pan @-@ European competition , as the club won the UEFA Cup in 1982 and 1987 . IFK is affiliated with Göteborgs <unk> and play all their home games at Gamla Ullevi since the start of the 2009 season . The club colours are blue and white , colours shared both with the sports society — <unk> <unk> — which the club originated from , and with the home town of Gothenburg . 
 Besides the two UEFA Cup titles , they have won 18 Swedish championship titles , a record in Swedish football shared with Malmö FF , and have the third most national cup titles with seven . The team has qualified for four group stages of the UEFA Champions League , and reached the semi @-@ finals of the 1985 – 86 European Cup . IFK Göteborg is the only Swedish club team in any sport to have won the <unk> <unk> — an award for best sports performance of the year voted by the Swedish people — for the 1982 UEFA Cup victory . IFK is one of the most popular football clubs in Sweden , with diverse country @-@ wide support . 
 They currently play in the highest Swedish league , Allsvenskan , where they have played for the majority of their history . They have played top @-@ flight football in Sweden continuously since 1977 , which currently is the longest top @-@ flight tenure of any club in Sweden — the second longest is Helsingborgs IF , since 1993 . The club won its first Swedish championship in 1908 , four years after the founding , and has won at least one championship title in all decades since , except the 1920s , 1970s and 2010s . IFK Göteborg 's most successful period was from 1982 to 1996 , when the team prospered in European football and won 10 out of 15 Swedish championships . 
 = = History = = 
 IFK Göteborg was founded at Café <unk> , a cafeteria in the <unk> district in the centre parts of Gothenburg , on October 4 , 1904 . It was the third , but only lasting , IFK association in Gothenburg , becoming the 39th overall . A committee for football was created at the historic first meeting ; the association 's first football match ended in a 4 – 1 victory against a club from the local area , IK Viking . The foundation of IFK Göteborg was important for the development of football in the city , as until that point , Örgryte IS , the largest of Gothenburg clubs , were dominant . IFK Göteborg represented some needed competition . 
 IFK Göteborg became the first Swedish team in four years to beat Örgryte IS in 1907 . They then went on to win their first Swedish Championship in 1908 by winning the cup tournament Svenska <unk> , and three players from the club were selected to play for Sweden in the national team 's first match . That year IFK played teams from outside Sweden for the first time , meeting the Danish clubs Østerbro BK and <unk> af 1893 . 
 In 1910 , the team played in blue and white striped jerseys for the first time . Two years later the team drew 1 – 1 in a game against the 1912 Swedish Olympic team , and the newspapers in Stockholm nominated IFK Göteborg as " the best Swedish football club ever " . IFK Göteborg won Svenska Serien — the highest Swedish league at the time , but not the Swedish Championship deciding competition — for the fifth time in a row in 1917 . The early IFK Göteborg team had no trainer ; the club gained its first such official in 1921 , when Hungarian manager Sándor Bródy was hired . Bródy was appointed manager for IFK two years later . The first Swedish official national league , Allsvenskan , started in late 1924 , the year the legendary Filip Johansson made his debut for IFK Göteborg . The club finished second , but Johansson scored 39 goals in 22 games and was the league 's top goalscorer . 
 IFK won their first Allsvenskan title in 1934 – 35 , the ten previous seasons of the league saw the club finish in the top four . Swedish football was dominated by teams from Gothenburg during these years , but IFK Göteborg were surprisingly relegated in 1937 – 38 , although the team was promoted back to Allsvenskan the next season . Back in the highest division , IFK finished second , with the league continuing despite the outbreak of World War II . IFK won another title in 1941 – 42 with a strong team , but the rest of the decade saw mixed results . The 1940s team included the talented Gunnar Gren , who became the top scorer in 1946 – 47 . He was also awarded <unk> as the best player in Sweden , and won an Olympic gold medal with the Swedish team at the 1948 Olympics . When Gren left in 1949 , IFK were relegated from Allsvenskan the following season . As happened the last time IFK played in a lower league , they were promoted directly back to Allsvenskan after one season in Division 2 . IFK went on to compete in a European Cup — the European Champion Clubs ' Cup — for the first time in 1958 , but were eliminated in the second round by SC <unk> . In 1959 , the all @-@ time Allsvenskan record attendance of 52 @,@ 194 was set when IFK played Örgryte IS at Nya Ullevi . 
 After an unglamorous decade , IFK were led by manager and retired footballer Bertil Johansson to a surprising championship title in 1969 . The following season was one of the darkest in their history . IFK were relegated , and unlike previous relegations they did not make an immediate return . After three seasons in the second league IFK had lost all signs of being a team from Allsvenskan , and had still not managed to gain promotion . But after hard work from board member Anders <unk> and others to get the club on the right track , IFK were promoted to Allsvenskan in 1976 . In 1979 , IFK hired Sven @-@ Göran Eriksson as manager . He introduced the 4 – 4 – 2 system with " pressure and support " — called the <unk> model — which would give IFK great success later on , and his first season at the club ended with a second place in Allsvenskan and the club 's first gold medal in Svenska Cupen . 
 After reinforcing the team with several expensive players — including Thomas <unk> and Stig Fredriksson — IFK had finished second in the league and reached the quarter @-@ finals in the UEFA Cup as 1981 came to an end . 1982 then became a turbulent season as the whole board was replaced and the club almost went bankrupt — even needing to borrow money from the official supporter 's association to travel to Valencia to play the quarter @-@ final of the UEFA Cup . After the troubled start IFK won every competition they entered , including Allsvenskan , the Allsvenskan play @-@ off , Svenska Cupen , and the UEFA Cup , defeating Hamburger SV 4 – 0 on aggregate in the finals . During the following 15 years the club was the leading club in Swedish football , winning the Swedish championship ten times , the domestic cup three times and the UEFA Cup twice . 
 IFK managed to field a strong team for a couple of years and won gold in the league in both 1983 and 1984 , and the cup in 1983 . In 1986 , the team reached the semi @-@ finals of the European Cup but were defeated on penalties against FC Barcelona . A new team of talents won both the UEFA Cup and Allsvenskan once again in 1987 , after beating Dundee United in the UEFA Cup final . The youth manager Roger Gustafsson took over the team from Gunder Bengtsson in 1990 , and his time with IFK was to become very successful , winning Allsvenskan five times between 1990 and 1995 . 
 As IFK won the 1993 Allsvenskan , they qualified for European competition . IFK advanced to the group stage of the Champions League , where they faced FC Barcelona , Manchester United and Galatasaray . Elimination at the group stage was widely anticipated , but IFK Göteborg confounded expectations by winning the group and advancing to the knockout stage . However , IFK Göteborg was eliminated in the quarter @-@ finals by Bayern Munich on away goals . 
 The last years before the new millennium were disappointing for IFK , providing a stark contrast to the earlier success . The team only managed a silver in 1997 and an eighth place in 1998 , after buying several expensive players who failed to produce . IFK changed manager in the middle of a season two years in a row — in 1998 and 1999 — when the club never before had changed manager even once during an ongoing season . The last year of the decade ended with a sixth @-@ place finish . The new millennium offered varied results , with the club playing a relegation play @-@ off in 2002 , but challenging for the championship in 2001 , 2004 , and 2005 . In 2007 , the first title in eleven years was secured in the last round of Allsvenskan . The club then won the national cup Svenska Cupen the next season . IFK Göteborg are still considered to be one of the " Big Three " in Swedish football , along with Malmö FF and AIK , despite only having won three titles in the last ten years . 
 = = Colours , crest and sponsorship = = 
 = = = Colours and kit = = = 
 The traditional colours of all IFK associations are blue and white , and IFK Göteborg is no exception . Soon after the club 's foundation in 1904 , it was decided that the kit should consist of a blue and white striped shirt with blue shorts . But the design was too costly and instead a cheaper alternative was used . Thus the club 's first kit used a blue shirt with a single horizontal white stripe and a four @-@ pointed star , one of the IFK association symbols , in white on the chest . During the next few years , white or blue shirts without stripes were used . In 1910 , a kit comprising a blue and white vertically striped shirt and blue shorts was used for the first time inspired by the kit of <unk> Boldklub . This kit has remained as the home colours ever since . The few visible sponsor logos , together with the longtime use of blue and white stripes , has made the kit a classic in Swedish football . The traditional away kit is red and white , in different styles , though other colour combinations , for example orange and white , have been used , mainly in the 1990s and 2000s . The away kit introduced in 2005 once again used red and white . An almost completely white third kit with blue details was introduced in mid @-@ 2007 after requests from supporters . In the 2010s , the away kit colours have seen much variation , including a pink shirt with black shorts , a black kit with light grey details , the more traditional red kit with white details , and a purple kit with white details introduced in 2016 . 
 = = = Crest = = = 
 The crest of IFK Göteborg has its origins in the coat of arms of the city of Gothenburg which in turn is based on several other heraldic arms . The lion on a field of silver and blue is the heraldic arms of the House of <unk> , and the lion holds the Three Crowns of Sweden , both symbols being used in the coat of arms of Sweden . This arms was granted to Gothenburg by Gustavus Adolphus . The coat of arms of the city sees the lion facing the sinister ( heraldic left , which is viewer 's right ) side which often is interpreted as a fleeing lion , the normal being a lion facing the dexter ( heraldic right ) side , and IFK chose to use the latter on the club crest . Finally the three letters IFK were added on top . This crest has been used since it first appeared on the kit in 1919 . These main elements have not been modified since then , but during the years several different designs of the crest have been used , occasionally having the lion facing the sinister side . In the early 1980s , the club standardised the design and only minor changes — such as element colours and different hues — have been made since then , with the exception of the years 1997 – 1999 when IFK , with Reebok as kit sponsors , used a crest with some more distinct changes to the standard elements . Before 1919 various other symbols were used , with the four @-@ pointed star of the IFK associations featuring on the shirts until 1910 . 
 = = = Sponsorship = = = 
 Adidas have supplied the kit for a majority of the seasons since the 1970s , interrupted briefly in 1979 – 80 and for seven seasons during the 1990s . In 2016 , Kappa was presented as the new kit manufacturer of the club . 
 The logotype of the main sponsor ICA — a grocery store chain — figured on the shirt front from 1980 until 2011 and almost become part of the shirt . The logotype was reproduced in its original red colour on the shirt for the first few years , but was soon changed to a blue and white version to better blend in to the kit colours . ICA had sponsored IFK since 1974 but after over 30 years of sponsorship , they were replaced by financial institution <unk> Finans as the main sponsor at the start of the 2011 season . The sponsorship was ended after the 2014 season , and IFK Göteborg played without any shirt sponsor for half a season until <unk> Finans returned during the summer of 2015 . 
 = Lujan – Fryns syndrome = 
 Lujan – Fryns syndrome ( LFS ) , also referred to as X @-@ linked mental retardation with Marfanoid habitus and Lujan syndrome , is an X @-@ linked genetic disorder that causes mild to moderate intellectual disability and features described as Marfanoid habitus , referring to a group of physical characteristics similar to those found in Marfan syndrome . These features include a tall , thin stature and long , slender limbs . LFS is also associated with psychopathology and behavioral abnormalities , and it exhibits a number of malformations affecting the brain and heart . The disorder is inherited in an X @-@ linked dominant manner , and is attributed to a missense mutation in the MED12 gene . There is currently no treatment or therapy for the underlying MED12 malfunction , and the exact etiology of the disorder remains unclear . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Intellectual disability in LFS usually ranges from mild to moderate , but severe cases have also been reported . A relatively common brain anomaly seen with LFS is agenesis of the corpus callosum , an error of embryonic development in which the corpus callosum ( a structure of the mammalian brain composed of nerves that allows communication between the left and right cerebral hemispheres ) is not present . Among a number of adverse neurological effects sometimes found with an absence of the corpus callosum , intellectual disability has been shown to occur at a rate of approximately 73 percent . A correlation between agenesis of the corpus callosum and intellectual disability in LFS , however , has not been suggested . 
 = = = Psychiatric manifestations = = = 
 Psychopathology and related behavioral abnormalities are typically seen in LFS , and they may be considered in the diagnosis of the disorder . The most common of these in LFS is an autism @-@ like spectrum disorder , and LFS is considered as one of a number of genetic disorders associated with autism . Additional alterations of psychopathology with behavioral manifestations that have been observed in LFS include : psychotic behavior , schizophrenia , hyperactivity and attention @-@ deficit hyperactivity disorder , aggression , oppositional defiant disorder , obsessive compulsive disorder , extreme shyness , learning disability , cognitive impairment , short @-@ term memory deficit , low frustration tolerance , social dysfunction , lack of impulse control , eating disorder and associated malnutrition , attributed to psychogenic loss of appetite ; and <unk> . 
 While psychiatric conditions like these are to be expected with LFS , there have also been cases of the disorder with some preservation of mental and behavioral abilities , such as problem solving , reasoning and normal intelligence . 
 The psychopathology of LFS usually exhibits schizophrenia . When schizophrenia is diagnosed in an individual known to be affected by intellectual disability , LFS may be considered in the differential diagnosis of schizophrenia , with confirmation of etiology through appropriate psychiatric and genetic evaluation methods . 
 = = = Marfanoid habitus = = = 
 LFS is clinically distinguished from other X @-@ linked forms of intellectual disability by the accompanying presence of marfanoid habitus . Marfanoid habitus describes a group of physical features common to Marfan syndrome . Including Marfan syndrome and LFS , marfanoid features of this type have also been observed with several other disorders , one of which is multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 . 
 In LFS , specific features identified as marfanoid include : a long , narrow face ; tall , thin stature ; long , slender limbs , fingers and toes ( not unlike <unk> ) with joint <unk> , shortened halluces ( the big toes ) and long second toes . 
 The diagnosis of marfanoid habitus in LFS is often delayed because many of the physical features and characteristics associated with it are usually not evident until adolescence . 
 = = = Craniofacial abnormalities = = = 
 Craniofacial and other features of LFS include : maxillary hypoplasia ( underdevelopment of the upper jaw bone ) , a small mandible ( lower jaw bone ) and receding chin , a high @-@ arched palate ( the roof of the mouth ) , with crowding and misalignment of the upper teeth ; macrocephaly ( enlarged skull ) with a prominent forehead , <unk> speech ( voice ) , a long nose with a high , narrow nasal bridge ; a deep , short philtrum ( the indentation in the upper lip , beneath the nose ) , low @-@ set ears with some apparent retroversion , hypotonia ( decreased muscle tone ) , pectus <unk> ( a <unk> of the chest ) , slightly enlarged to normal testicular size in males , and seizures . 
 <unk> speech , or " <unk> " , is primarily the result of <unk> insufficiency , a sometimes congenital aberration in which the <unk> sphincter allows too much air into the nasal cavity during speech . In LFS , <unk> may also be caused by failure of the soft palate and uvula to reach the back wall of the pharynx ( the interior cavity of the throat where swallowing generally occurs ) during speech , a condition that can be associated with a <unk> cleft palate . 
 = = = Cardiovascular abnormalities = = = 
 A number of features involving the heart have been noted in several LFS cases , the most significant being dilation of the aortic root , a section of the ascending aorta . <unk> root dilation ( enlargement ) is associated with a greatly increased risk of dissection of the aortic wall , resulting in aortic aneurysm . As this presents a possible life @-@ threatening consequence of LFS , routine cardiac evaluation methods such as echocardiogram are implemented when the disorder is first diagnosed , along with MRI scans of the brain to screen for suspected agenesis of the corpus callosum . Additional effects on the heart that have been reported with LFS are ventricular and atrial septal defect . 
 = = Cause = = 
 A missense mutation in the MED12 gene , located on the human X chromosome , has been established as the cause of LFS . Missense mutations are genetic point mutations in which an amino acid codon that does not belong in the nucleotide sequence of a particular protein is erroneously substituted for an amino acid that is supposed to be included in the sequence , at a specific location . The missense mutation in the MED12 gene , that causes LFS , is identified as <unk> This indicates that the amino acid asparagine , normally located at position 1007 along the MED12 sequence , has been mistakenly replaced by serine . This mutation in MED12 causes incorrect expression and activity of the protein it encodes , resulting in the disorder . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 MED12 , or mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription , subunit 12 homolog of S. cerevisiae , is one of several subunits in the mammalian mediator complex , which regulates RNA polymerase II during mRNA transcription . 
 The Mediator complex is required for polymerase II transcription and acts as a bridge between the polymerase II enzyme and different gene @-@ specific transcription factors . Mediator can contain up to 30 subunits , but some of the subunits are only required for regulation of transcription in particular tissues or cells . Currently , the exact mechanism by which dysfunction of MED12 results in LFS and its associated <unk> and physical characteristics is unclear . Marfanoid habitus , a highly arched palate and several other features of LFS can be found with Marfan syndrome , a connective tissue disorder . The finding of aortic root dilation in both disorders suggests that a mutation in an unspecified connective tissue regulating gene may contribute to the etiology of LFS . 
 A number of interesting experimental results have been obtained by studying MED12 mutations in the zebrafish , an animal model representing vertebrates . In zebrafish , a mutation in MED12 was found to be responsible for the mutant motionless ( mot ) . <unk> with the mot mutation have neuronal and cardiovascular defects , although not all types of neurons are affected . Introduction of human MED12 mRNA into the zebrafish restores normal development . MED12 is also a critical coactivator for the gene <unk> , which is involved in the developmental regulation of neurons , cartilage and bone . In the zebrafish , MED12 defects cause <unk> of vertebrate embryonic structures such as the neural crest , which would alter function of the autonomic and peripheral nervous systems ; and they also cause malformations of cell types serving as precursors to cartilage and bone , such as osteocytes . Some features found in LFS , like agenesis of the corpus callosum and cartilage @-@ related craniofacial anomalies , are similar to defects found in zebrafish with MED12 and associated mutations . 
 = = = Genetics = = = 
 Lujan – Fryns syndrome is inherited in an X @-@ linked dominant manner . This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder ( MED12 ) is located on the X chromosome , and only one copy of the defective gene is sufficient to cause the disorder when inherited from a parent who has the disorder . Males are normally <unk> for the X chromosome , having only one copy . As a result , X @-@ linked dominant disorders usually show higher expressivity in males than females . This phenomenon is thought to occur with LFS . 
 As the X chromosome is one of the sex chromosomes ( the other being the Y chromosome ) , X @-@ linked inheritance is determined by the gender of the parent carrying a specific gene and can often seem complex . This is because , typically , females have two copies of the X @-@ chromosome , while males have only one copy . The difference between dominant and recessive inheritance patterns also plays a role in determining the chances of a child inheriting an X @-@ linked disorder from their parentage . 
 In LFS , X @-@ linked dominant inheritance was suspected , as boy and girl siblings in one family both exhibited the disorder . A scenario such as this would also be possible with X @-@ linked recessive inheritance , but in this particular case report , the girl was believed to be a manifesting heterozygote . , carrying one copy of the mutated gene . 
 Sporadic cases of LFS , where the disorder is present in an individual with no prior family history of it , have also been reported in a small number of affected males . 
 = = = Similarities to other genetic diseases = = = 
 An individual exhibiting intellectual disability and other symptoms similar to LFS was found to have a terminal deletion of the <unk> region in the short arm of chromosome 5 . Deletion of this area of chromosome 5 is associated with intellectual disability , psychotic behavior , autism , macrocephaly and <unk> @-@ like speech , as well as the disorder Cri du chat syndrome . Fryns ( 2006 ) suggests a detailed examination of chromosome 5 with FISH should be performed as part of the differential diagnosis of LFS . 
 Mutations in the UPF3B gene , also found on the X chromosome , are another cause of X @-@ linked intellectual disability . UPF3B is part of the nonsense @-@ mediated mRNA decay ( <unk> ) complex , which performs mRNA surveillance , detecting mRNA sequences that have been erroneously truncated ( shortened ) by the presence of nonsense mutations . Mutations in UPF3B alter and prevent normal function of the <unk> pathway , resulting in translation and expression of truncated mRNA sequences into malfunctioning proteins that can be associated with developmental errors and intellectual disability . Individuals from two families diagnosed with LFS and one family with FGS were found to have mutations in UPF3B , confirming that the clinical presentations of the different mutations can overlap . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 Although LFS is usually suspected when intellectual disability and marfanoid habitus are observed together in a patient , the diagnosis of LFS can be confirmed by the presence of the <unk> missense mutation in the MED12 gene . 
 = = = Differential diagnosis = = = 
 In the differential diagnosis of LFS , another disorder that exhibits some features and symptoms of LFS and is also associated with a missense mutation of MED12 is Opitz @-@ <unk> syndrome ( FGS ) . Common features shared by both LFS and FGS include X @-@ linked intellectual disability , hyperactivity , macrocephaly , corpus callosum agenesis and hypotonia . Notable features of FGS that have not been reported with LFS include excessive <unk> , consistent strength in socialization skills , imperforate anus ( occlusion of the anus ) and ocular hypertelorism ( extremely wide @-@ set eyes ) . 
 Whereas LFS is associated with missense mutation <unk> , FGS is associated with missense mutation <unk> As both disorders originate from an identical type of mutation in the same gene , while exhibiting similar , yet distinct characteristics ; LFS and FGS are considered to be allelic . In the context of MED12 , this suggests that the phenotype of each disorder is related to the way in which their respective mutations alter the MED12 sequence and its function . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 While there is no specific treatment for the underlying genetic cause of LFS ; corrective procedures , preventive intervention measures and therapies may be considered in the treatment and management of the many craniofacial , orthopedic and psychiatric problems associated with the disorder . More pressing issues such as cardiac involvement or epileptic seizures should be routinely examined and monitored . Close attention and specialized follow @-@ up care , including <unk> evaluation methods and therapies , and special education , should be given to diagnose and prevent psychiatric disorders and related behavioral problems such as psychosis and outbursts of aggression . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Lujan – Fryns syndrome is a rare X @-@ linked dominant syndrome , and is therefore more common in males than females . Its prevalence within the general population has not yet been determined . 
 = = History = = 
 Lujan – Fryns syndrome is named after physicians J. Enrique Lujan and Jean @-@ Pierre Fryns . The initial observation of suspected X @-@ linked intellectual disability with Marfanoid features and craniofacial effects such as a high @-@ arched palate was described by Lujan et al. in 1984 . In the report , four affected male members of a large kindred ( <unk> family ) were noted . Additional investigations of combined X @-@ linked intellectual disability and Marfanoid habitus in other families , including two brothers , were reported by Fryns et al . , beginning in 1987 . The disorder soon became known as Lujan – Fryns syndrome . 
 = Tropical Storm Koni = 
 Severe Tropical Storm Koni , known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm <unk> , caused moderate damage to areas of China and Vietnam in July 2003 . The eighth tropical storm in the western Pacific that year , Koni originated from a disturbance situated within the monsoon trough well east of the Philippines on July 15 . Tracking westward , intensification was slow and the system remained a tropical depression as it moved across the central Philippines on July 17 . Upon moving into the South China Sea , however , conditions allowed for quicker strengthening , and as such the cyclone reached tropical storm status on July 18 before reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 975 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 79 inHg ) , making it a severe tropical storm . However , atmospheric conditions began to deteriorate as Koni made landfall on Hainan on July 21 , weakening the system . The tropical storm continued to weaken as it moved over the Gulf of Tonkin prior to a final landfall near Hanoi , Vietnam the following day . Tracking inland , the combination of land interaction and wind shear caused Koni to dissipate over Laos on July 23 . 
 Shortly after development Koni tracked through the Philippines , killing two people . After moving into the South China Sea , turbulence produced by the storm resulted in an aviation incident involving a commercial airliner off the western Philippines . Three of the plane 's occupants received minor injuries . In Hainan , Koni caused heavy rainfall , peaking at 189 mm ( 7 @.@ 44 in ) at a station on <unk> Mountain . The rains resulted in the collapse of 1 @,@ 400 homes and an estimated CN ¥ 140 @.@ 27 million ( US $ 16 @.@ 9 million ) in direct economic losses . Effects were worst in Vietnam , where three people were killed . Widespread power outages occurred , and strong winds resulted in agricultural and infrastructural damage , particularly in Vietnam 's northern provinces . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The precursor to Koni developed as an area of deep convection within an active monsoon trough well south of Guam on July 12 . Though atmospheric conditions were favorable for tropical cyclogenesis , the tropical disturbance failed to maintain consistent shower activity . Late on July 14 , however , the system developed organized rainbands . This prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) to classify the system as a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on July 15 , well north of Palau . Shortly after , the storm entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) , immediately classifying the system as a tropical depression and designating it with the name <unk> ; the JTWC later classified the system as such at 1200 UTC that day . A subtropical ridge to the north steered the depression westward for much of its initial stages . 
 On July 16 , the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm strength , while the JMA maintained the system 's tropical depression classification . Through July 17 , the tropical cyclone began to track across the central Philippines and concurrently entered hostile atmospheric conditions as wind shear and a suppressed outflow pattern began to impact the storm . However , the cyclone was only a slightly weakened system by the time it emerged into the South China Sea the following day . At the same time , a shortwave trough began to force the storm northwestward towards China . At 0600 UTC on July 18 , the JMA upgraded the cyclone to tropical storm status , designating it with the name Koni . Though conditions were more favorable over the South China Sea than over the Philippines , persistent , moderate wind shear prevented much strengthening . However , a brief period of favorable conditions allowed for Koni to strengthen , and at 0000 UTC on July 20 the tropical storm was upgraded to severe tropical storm status by the JMA . Meanwhile , the JTWC upgraded the system to typhoon intensity six hours later . 
 Midday on July 20 Koni began to develop a partial eye . This indicated an increase in intensity , and as such Koni reached a peak in strength at 1800 UTC that day with maximum sustained winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 975 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 79 inHg ) . This intensity was maintained for roughly six hours , during which time Koni began to curve westward . However , moderate wind shear conditions returned the following day , weakening the tropical cyclone . At around 1200 UTC on July 21 , Koni made landfall on the southeastern coast of Hainan with winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) . Land interaction further weakened Koni , and the restrengthening of the subtropical ridge to the cyclone 's north resulted in a more westerly path . After a brief reemergence into the Gulf of Tonkin , the system made another landfall , this time south of Hanoi , Vietnam at 0800 UTC on July 22 . At this landfall Koni was only estimated to have winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) . Upon tracking inland , the storm began to quickly weaken , and was downgraded to tropical depression intensity at 1800 UTC that day over northern Laos . Six hours later , the JMA declared Koni to have dissipated over the same general region . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 Four people were killed in the Philippines by Koni , and an additional person was injured . Damage reports from the Philippines remained scarce , though the PAGASA indicated that damage costs totaled 67 @.@ 250 million Philippine pesos ( US $ 1 @.@ 26 million ) . On July 18 , an Airbus A330 @-@ 242 carrying 242 passengers bound for Hong Kong encountered Koni in the South China Sea and attempted to deviate from its planned trajectory in order to avoid severe weather . However , the plane inadvertently encountered an area of severe turbulence , resulting in three minor injures on board . The plane was later able to exit the area of turbulence and land safely at Hong Kong International Airport . 
 In Hong Kong , the nearby approach of Tropical Storm Koni forced the Hong Kong Observatory to issue the tropical cyclone warning signal No. 1 , the signal of lowest urgency , for the special administrative region . Passing well south of Hong Kong , the strongest sustained wind associated with the storm in the region was an observation of 52 km / h ( 32 mph ) winds in Tai Mo Shan . Ultimately effects in the Hong Kong area were limited to scattered squally weather producing isolated rainfall peaking at over 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) in some locations . In Hainan , where the storm made landfall , 35 flights were delayed while 28 others were cancelled due to conditions onset by Koni . Ferry service across the Qiongzhou Strait was also halted , stranding 3 @,@ 000 vehicles . As a result of Koni , heavy rainfall took place across Hainan , peaking at 189 mm ( 7 @.@ 44 in ) at a station on <unk> Mountain . In the province alone , at least 1 @,@ 400 homes collapsed . Direct economic losses stemming from Koni in Hainan were estimated at CN ¥ 140 @.@ 27 million ( US $ 16 @.@ 9 million ) . In order to counteract the flight suspensions and cancellations caused by Koni , 198 flights from <unk> Airport were scheduled after the storm 's passage . 
 Vietnam was the country with the worst impacts from Koni . Widespread power outages and <unk> failures were commonplace during the storm 's passage . Offshore the northern coast of Vietnam , 19 fishing and passenger boats capsized due to strong waves produced by the tropical storm . One of these sinkings near Do Son resulted in the death of a fisherman . Another person was killed in Tam Diep after being hit by a prostrated tree . Eighteen others in four of Vietnam 's northern provinces were injured by flying debris kicked up by Koni 's strong winds . In Thanh Hóa Province , strong winds uprooted trees and electricity poles . The roofs of 300 homes in Thanh Hóa were torn apart . Koni also disrupted water supplies and telephone service in the city . Further north , in Thái Bình , gusts reaching as high as 90 km / h ( 55 mph ) damaged 250 residences as well as 300 ha ( 740 acres ) of rice crops . Ten of the eighteen people injured country wide were injured there . In Hanoi , the winds blew trees down . Overall , 3 people were killed in Vietnam . Approximately 1 @,@ 000 homes were destroyed by Koni , resulting in significant impacts to agriculture . Despite significant impacts in Vietnam , rains brought by Koni alleviated persistent drought conditions over Vietnam 's northern colonies . Though the name Koni was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization , the name was corrected to <unk> for its 2009 usage . 
 = Fallout : New Vegas = 
 Fallout : New Vegas is an action role @-@ playing video game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Bethesda Softworks , as the fourth major installment of the Fallout video game series . It released for Microsoft Windows , Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on October 19 , 2010 . 
 The game is set in a post @-@ apocalyptic , open world environment around the area of Nevada , California , and Arizona . The player takes control of the character known as Courier 6 , who , preceding the start of the game , is hired by a delivery service called the Mojave Express to take an unknown package across the Mojave Desert to the New Vegas Strip . After surviving an ambush , he or she goes on a journey to track down their attempted murderer . Throughout the game , players can have a major impact on the world through choices available to them , which is enhanced by the implemented reputation system with which affects the outlook of non @-@ playable characters on the Courier depending on the player 's decisions . 
 Even though it directly succeeds Fallout 3 , New Vegas is not a direct sequel . It marks the return of some elements found in the Black Isle Studios @-@ developed Fallout 2 , as several employees at Obsidian previously worked at that company . The game was announced in April 2009 after Obsidian received an offer to work on it from Bethesda , and was developed over the span of 18 months . Inon Zur was hired to compose its music . 
 New Vegas has received positive reviews , with reviewers praising the game 's writing , quests , and improved gameplay ; in contrast , it received criticisms for its glitches and bugs . New Vegas was a commercial success , shipping more than 5 million copies altogether , and is estimated to have sold around 12 million copies worldwide . It received a Golden Joystick Award for " RPG of the Year " in 2011 . 
 The Xbox 360 version of New Vegas became backwards compatible on Xbox One on June 23 , 2016 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Obsidian Entertainment presents new features and improvements in Fallout : New Vegas that are implemented upon the foundation of Fallout 3 . For example , the original Fallout 3 version of the Gamebryo engine was reworked to accommodate the extra lights and effects of the Las Vegas Strip . 
 The game 's combat is centered on the " Vault @-@ Tec Assisted Targeting System " feature , or " V.A.T.S. " , which is from Fallout 3 with the addition of several new <unk> attacks . Use of certain melee weapons trigger unique animations . Additions are new weapons , a weapon modification system , a better over @-@ the @-@ shoulder view for third @-@ person combat and the ability to use the iron sights on almost all guns except several larger weapons that are shot from the hip . The game allows firearm modifications such as mounted telescopic sights , rate of fire modifiers and increased magazine size . Crafting also plays a role in weaponry , with the ability to make ammunition such as hand @-@ loaded rounds . A plant @-@ harvesting system similar to that of The Elder Scrolls series allows the player to use plants to create special meals , poisons , and medicines . 
 The quantity of factions prompted developers to reintroduce the reputation system that was absent in Fallout 3 . The degree of faction loyalty influences the player 's reputation with that faction , which affects the behavior of the faction 's non @-@ player characters ( NPCs ) toward the player and reflects the impact of selected choices in the world . Karma is also a factor and is independent of faction reputation . For example , the player can rob a faction member , lowering their karma , but leaving their reputation unchanged provided the faction does not learn of the robbery . Character attributes , skills , reputation and karma affect dialog options with NPCs . Skills have a larger effect on conversation choices . Whether a dialogue option will succeed or fail is shown up front , and entirely dependent on skill level , rather than both skill and chance as in Fallout 3 . 
 Companion behavior and tasks are controlled using the new " Companion Wheel " , removing the need to enter conversation to give commands . The new Companion Wheel offers command execution by selecting commands that are presented in a radial menu . Game director Josh Sawyer has stated that the Companion Wheel offers ease of companion interaction . Examples of companion commands include setting and changing combat tactics , default behavior towards foes and usage frequency of available resources . The player can have one humanoid and one non @-@ humanoid companion at the same time , and receives a unique perk , or unique advantage , per companion . These companions can be upgraded if the player completes a special quest related to the companion , and unlike Fallout 3 dismissed companions are sent to the player 's house instead of returning to their original locations . 
 In New Vegas , the player can visit casinos to participate in minigames to win currency , including blackjack , slots , and roulette . A card game called Caravan , which was designed specifically for the game , can be played outside of the casinos . 
 = = = Hardcore mode = = = 
 An optional Hardcore mode delivers more realism and intensity to the playing environment . This mode differs from the game 's adjustable difficulty level settings that change only the combat difficulty ; it adds new statistics and encourages the player to make careful consideration of resource management and combat tactics . Gameplay difficulty is increased in several ways . <unk> and other healing items , including food and water , do not heal the player instantly , but work over a short period of time . <unk> also decreases radiation poisoning gradually , rather than instantly . <unk> cannot heal crippled limbs ; use of a Doctor 's Bag , sleeping on an owned or rented bed , using the <unk> Hydra , or going to a doctor is required . Ammunition has also gained weight value . The player 's character must eat , drink , and sleep to avoid starvation , dehydration and exhaustion . Skills decrease in four stages with each illness until the fifth stage resulting in death ; When companions are reduced to zero hit points , they are killed , rather than losing consciousness . 
 Sawyer stated that the mode was inspired by several different Fallout 3 mods . An achievement ( Xbox 360 / Steam ) or trophy ( PlayStation 3 ) is awarded for completing the game on Hardcore mode .

 Fallout : New Vegas takes place during the year 2281 , four years after the events of Fallout 3 and 40 years after the events of Fallout 2 , 120 years after the events of Fallout 1 , 204 years after the Great War of 2077 . The former city of Las Vegas ( now called " New Vegas " ) and its surroundings are divided among various factions , but there are three major powers competing for control of the region : The New California Republic ( NCR ) , Caesar 's Legion , and Mr. House . The NCR 's military , returning from Fallout 2 , is now overextended and mismanaged , but controls the majority of territories in the Mojave . The slave @-@ driving , Roman army @-@ styled Caesar 's Legion , formed by its leader , Caesar , conquered and united 86 tribes and now plans to conquer New Vegas . Mr. House , the mysterious businessman , controls New Vegas with an army of " Securitron " security robots . There are other factions and groups such as the Boomers , a tribe of heavily armed former vault dwellers who have taken shelter at Nellis Air Force Base ; the Powder Gangers , a violent group of escaped convicts ; the Great Khans , a tribe of drug dealers and raiders ; and the Brotherhood of Steel , technology @-@ craving remnants of the U.S. Army who are attempting to secure any technology that could cause significant harm . Landmarks featured in Fallout : New Vegas are the Hoover Dam , which supplies power to the New Vegas strip ; Nellis Air Force Base and the <unk> One solar energy plant . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 The protagonist is a courier working for the Mojave Express , known simply as " The Courier " . The game begins as the Courier is ambushed by a mobster named Benny ( voiced by Matthew Perry ) en route to New Vegas to deliver a mysterious item known as the " Platinum Chip . " Benny shoots the Courier and leaves them for dead , taking the Chip for himself , but the Courier is rescued by a Securitron named Victor and brought back to good health by Doc Mitchell ( voiced by Michael Hogan ) in <unk> . The Courier then embarks on a journey across the Mojave Wasteland to locate and confront Benny . 
 The game proceeds according to the Courier 's decisions and involves many different events , factions , and characters . The main storyline follows the Courier 's pursuit of Benny to both settle the score and retrieve the Platinum Chip . Along the way , the Courier encounters many groups of people with various problems that he / she can choose to assist with , ignore , or otherwise sabotage , resulting in positive or negative karma . Eventually , after finding Benny and the Chip , the Courier finds him / herself in the middle of a conflict between three major factions : Caesar 's Legion , a group of Roman @-@ esque slavers , the New California Republic ( NCR ) , an expansionist country , and Mr. House ( voiced by René Auberjonois ) , the enigmatic de facto ruler of New Vegas , in command of an army of Securitron robots that patrols the city . Each of the three sides aim to control the Hoover Dam , which is still operational and supplying the Southwest with power and clean , non @-@ irradiated water ; thus , control of the dam means effective control of the region . It is revealed that Mr. House , a human from before the Great War and surviving via a contained life support chamber , ordered the Platinum Chip 's delivery before the war . The Chip is a data storage device with a program that can upgrade the Securitrons to a greater level of combat effectiveness , and was stolen by Benny as part of a scheme to take over House 's security and claim New Vegas for himself with the help of a reprogrammed Securitron named Yes Man . 
 The Courier is then notified that Caesar 's Legion is attacking Hoover Dam , and they must take part to decide the outcome . As the Legion strikes the Dam , led by the fearsome Legate Lanius , the NCR defends its position under General Lee Oliver . Depending on the faction sided with up to the battle , the Courier will either conquer the Dam for Caesar 's Legion , defend it for the NCR or connect the dam 's systems to House 's network so either he or Yes Man can take control . The game concludes with a narrated slideshow showing and explaining the results of the Courier 's actions , the battle for Hoover Dam deciding the faction that comes to power over New Vegas and the Mojave , and the fates of the various other factions based on how the player negotiated with them and which of the major factions emerged dominant .

 The player then faces a choice to determine the fate of the Mojave Wasteland . 
 New California Republic - siding with the NCR will lead the Courier to defend Hoover Dam from Caesar 's Legion . The Courier must also lead an attack on the Legate 's camp where they have the to choice to either convince the Legate to end the fighting peacefully , or they can kill the Legate . The NCR then wins the battle and annexes New Vegas and the entire Mojave Wasteland . 
 Caesar 's Legion - siding with the Legion will lead the Courier to attack Hoover Dam . The Courier must also enter Oliver 's compound where they have the choice to either convince him to retreat for the sake of his men , or they can kill him . The Legion seizes Hoover Dam , forcing the NCR to retreat , allowing Caesar 's Legion to gain control over New Vegas and the Mojave Wasteland . 
 Mr House - siding with Mr House will lead the Courier to enter the control room in Hoover Dam and install the override chip in order to power the Securitron Army . The Courier must also enter both Oliver 's compound and the Legate 's camp where they have the choice to either convince both men to surrender the dam , or they can kill them . Mr House and his Securitrons then drive both the NCR and the Legion out of Hoover Dam , taking control of it , while still running New Vegas . 
 Yes Man - siding with Yes Man will lead the Courier to go solo ( if the player helps Yes Man take over New Vegas and Mr House 's Securitrons ) and take over Hoover Dam for themselves . The Courier must also enter both Oliver 's compound and the Legate 's camp where they have the choice to either convince both men to step down , or they can kill them . The Courier and Yes Man eventually take control of Hoover Dam , while ensuring New Vegas 's independence .

 In 2004 , Bethesda Softworks purchased the license to develop and publish Fallout 3 , as well as an option to create two sequels , from Interplay Entertainment . Three years later they bought the entire Fallout IP . Bethesda abandoned the original gameplay style of previous Fallout titles ; instead of an isometric game with action point / turn @-@ based combat , Bethesda 's Fallout 3 was a fully 3D game with real @-@ time combat as well as the action point @-@ based V.A.T.S. system . 
 Fallout 3 was a critical and commercial success upon its release in 2008 , and Bethesda commissioned a sequel . With their own developers busy working on The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim Bethesda reached out to Obsidian Entertainment , a company founded by several former members of Interplay 's original Fallout developers Black Isle Studios , to develop the game . Bethesda and Obsidian decided to create a game that would continue the " West Coast " story rather than the plot of Fallout 3 . Bethesda rejected Obsidian 's idea to set the game between the events of Fallout 2 and Fallout 3 , but they did approve of setting the game in Las Vegas . 
 Fallout : New Vegas was first announced in April 2009 . Obsidian 's development team included former Interplay / Black Isle employees Josh Sawyer as director and Chris Avellone as a writer and director of the game 's DLC add @-@ ons . The plot of New Vegas takes heavy inspiration from the original Fallout 3 that Black Isle developed , commonly known by its codename " Van Buren " , which Sawyer also directed prior to its cancellation . The most notable example is the inclusion of Caesar 's Legion , a faction originally created for Van Buren . Obsidian also included other factions from previous Fallout games and avoided writing any faction as entirely good or evil , but instead as potential rivals depending on what path the player decided to pursue . 
 The game had a somewhat short development cycle of 18 months . New Vegas is technically very similar to Fallout 3 : both games use the Gamebryo engine , and New Vegas reuses Fallout 3 's source code , with some graphic rendering improvements , and art assets . Obsidian also refined the real @-@ time shooting mechanics and added iron @-@ sights aiming to make playing without V.A.T.S. a more viable option than it was in Fallout 3 . The PC version of the game uses Steamworks for online functions , such as achievements and cloud save storage , as well as DRM . 
 Producer Jason Bergman announced the involvement of several celebrities , including Ron Perlman as the game 's narrator and Wayne Newton as radio DJ " Mr. New Vegas " . He also confirmed that the game would include voice acting from Matthew Perry , Zachary Levi , Kris Kristofferson , Danny Trejo , Michael Dorn and Felicia Day . The game established the new record for the most lines of dialogue in a single @-@ player action role @-@ playing game . The game contains around 65 @,@ 000 lines of dialogue , beating its predecessor and previous record holder Fallout 3 which contained 40 @,@ 000 lines of dialogue . 
 Fallout 3 composer Inon Zur composed the score for the game . The game features three major in @-@ game radio stations , spanning several genres of music in the radio waves : <unk> , popular music from the 1940s and 1950s , jazz and classical . Each station has a set tracklist which repeats randomly . Music from the first two Fallout games , composed by Mark Morgan , is used in the game as well . 
 On February 4 , 2010 , Obsidian Entertainment released the Fallout : New Vegas teaser trailer . A second trailer was first shown on GameTrailers from E3 on June 11 , 2010 . 
 = = Release = = 
 Bethesda announced four pre @-@ order bonus packs giving specific in @-@ game items , they include the " Classic " , " Tribal " , " Caravan " and " Mercenary " packs available when pre @-@ ordering at specific outlets , all of the listed pre @-@ order packs were later made available for purchase on September 27 , 2011 . The Collector 's Edition was revealed on May 11 , 2010 . It was distributed worldwide and is available for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 , and Xbox 360 . Its enclosed contents include seven real clay poker chips from the Fallout : New Vegas casinos , a deck of cards each with a character on them with information on that person , a graphic novel leading up to the events of New Vegas , a Lucky 38 large platinum chip replica , and a making @-@ of documentary . 
 Within hours of the game 's release on October 19 , 2010 , players of Fallout : New Vegas began reporting a variety of technical issues ( saved games becoming corrupted , the game freezing , players becoming stuck within the terrain , and random NPCs appearing behind the player , initiating combat out of context ) . Bethesda Game Studios stated that they , in conjunction with Obsidian , were actively working on an update for release " as soon as possible " to address in @-@ game issues . They also urged customers to keep their copies of New Vegas rather than return them to stores , stating that providing the best possible experience to their users was a priority . 
 Within a week of the original release , a patch was available for the PC , Xbox 360 , and PlayStation 3 versions of the game , which contained over 200 quest and scripting @-@ related fixes . The update released on December 14 , 2010 , has fixed further glitches and save game problems , including companion @-@ related bugs . Subsequent updates were released in February and April that corrected numerous bugs and gameplay issues . A patch was released on July 5 , 2011 , that included a provision that automatically creates a save prior to the endgame sequence . After credits , the user is prompted to load this save game , allowing single save players to play DLC without creating a new game . Additional to the official patches the user community started to create community patches to fix remaining issues . 
 The game engine has had major performance issues on the PlayStation 3 . These issues have led to unplayable frame @-@ rates when the save game file gets too big or when DLC is installed . Due to the nature of the game , the longer the player plays , the larger the save file becomes . These same issues plagued The Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim , but a performance patch to improve New Vegas seems unlikely . Sawyer said that it is a core @-@ engine issue that can not be so easily patched . 
 = = = Downloadable content = = = 
 On October 18 , 2010 Bethesda Softworks announced that downloadable content ( DLC ) would be available for New Vegas , in keeping with its predecessor Fallout 3 . Six add @-@ on packs , available as downloadable content ( DLC ) , have been released . Collectively , the six add @-@ ons are titled " Dead Money " , " Honest Hearts " , " Old World Blues " , " Lonesome Road " , " Gun Runners Arsenal " , and " Courier 's Stash " . The four story add @-@ ons , Dead Money , Honest Hearts , Old World Blues and Lonesome Road , are standalone adventures , but collectively tie together to form a greater story . Overall , the player 's level cap is increased by 20 , starting at 30 and up to 50 with all add @-@ ons installed . 
 Dead Money 
 The first add @-@ on pack was released for the Xbox 360 on December 21 , 2010 and for PlayStation 3 and PC ( via Steam ) on February 22 , 2011 . In Dead Money , the Courier is captured by an insane ex @-@ Brotherhood of Steel leader known as Father Elijah and must work alongside three other captives to find the fabled treasure of the Sierra Madre Casino , concealed from the world by a deadly toxic cloud . The pack adds new achievements / trophies , new weapons , perks , terrain , enemies and decisions for the player , as well as raising the level cap by five . It is the only one of the four story add @-@ ons that cannot be revisited after the completion of its main <unk> . 
 Honest Hearts 
 The second pack was released on May 17 , 2011 on Xbox Live and Steam and June 2 , 2011 on the PlayStation Network due to the April — May outage . In Honest Hearts , the Courier takes part in an expedition to Utah 's Zion National Park , when they are attacked by tribal raiders . While trying to return to the Mojave , the player becomes involved in conflicts between the tribes and between a " New Canaanite " ( post @-@ apocalyptic incarnation of Mormonism ) missionary and an individual known as the " Burned Man " , Caesar 's former Legate , who , after losing the first battle of Hoover Dam , was covered in pitch , set on fire , and thrown into the Grand Canyon . The pack adds new achievements / trophies , perks , terrain , items , enemies and decisions for the player , as well as raising the level cap by five . 
 Old World Blues 
 In Old World Blues , the Courier is abducted and unwittingly becomes a lab rat in a science experiment gone awry and discovers how some of the Mojave 's mutated creatures and dangerous technology came to exist . Old World Blues takes place in the Pre @-@ War research centers of Big Mountain , known colloquially as " the Big Empty " or " Big MT " . The player can also choose to either turn on their kidnappers or join with them to fight an even greater threat . This pack offers new achievements / trophies , perks , a vast area to explore , and raises the level cap by five like the previous two packs . Old World Blues was released on July 19 , 2011 . 
 Lonesome Road 
 In Lonesome Road , the Courier is contacted by Ulysses , an ex @-@ legionary and courier who , upon seeing the Courier 's name on a list of possible <unk> , refused to deliver the Platinum Chip that was ultimately responsible for the Courier 's attempted murder . Ulysses was a character whose involvement in the story had been hinted since New Vegas ' initial release , and Lonesome Road concludes his story , as well as that of the Courier . Initially , Lonesome Road was planned to be released in August 2011 ; however , the add @-@ on was delayed until September 20 for unspecified reasons . 
 Gun Runners ' Arsenal and Courier 's Stash 
 On September 27 , 2011 , Bethesda released two content packs titled Gun Runners ' Arsenal and Courier 's Stash . Gun Runners ' Arsenal adds various new weapons and weapon mods ( along with new ammo types ) to the game , which can be found throughout the game world . Courier 's Stash contains all bonus content that was previously only available for pre @-@ ordering the game ( the " Caravan Pack " , " Classic Pack " , " Mercenary Pack " and " Tribal Pack " ) .

 On December 29 , 2011 , Fallout : New Vegas director Josh " J.E. " Sawyer released an unofficial mod for the PC version . The mod adjusts the maximum level to 35 , halves the rate of increase in player experience points , reduces base player health , reduces the base weight a player can carry , defines certain characters as good or evil rather than neutral , and makes various other adjustments . These are changes that Sawyer wanted included in the game , but they were not released as an official update . This mod requires the Mod Manager , all add @-@ on packs , and all pre @-@ order bonus packs to work . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Fallout : New Vegas received a positive critical reception , with critics praising the gameplay improvements and expanded content over Fallout 3 , while criticizing familiarity and technical issues . As of November 8 , 2010 , the game had shipped 5 million copies worldwide , achieving revenue of $ 300 million . Electronic Entertainment Design and Research , a market research firm , estimates that the game has sold 11 @.@ 6 million copies worldwide . 
 IGN 's Keza MacDonald praised the game 's script , but criticized the character models and facial animation as " wooden and unbelievable " . Eurogamer commented that " Obsidian has created a totally compelling world and its frustrations pale into insignificance compared to the immersive , obsessive experience on offer . Just like the scorched scenery that provides its epic backdrop , New Vegas is huge and sprawling , sometimes gaudy , even downright ugly at times – but always effortlessly , shamelessly entertaining . " According to GameSpot 's Kevin VanOrd , the game 's " familiar rhythm will delight fans of the series , and the huge world , expansive quests , and hidden pleasures will have [ the players ] itching to see what other joys you might uncover . However , as time wears on , the constant glitches invade almost every element of the game and eventually grow wearisome . " 
 Giant Bomb 's Jeff Gerstmann reviewed Fallout : New Vegas for the Xbox 360 positively , despite its many crash bugs and glitches . Gerstmann wrote : " When I reflect on the experience , I 'll probably think about the times the game locked up on me or broke in a dozen other crazy ways first , before thinking about the great world and the objectives that fill it . If you were able to look past the issues that plagued Fallout 3 and Oblivion before it , New Vegas will eventually show you a real good time . " 1UP.com 's Mike Nelson wrote " On one hand , it feels like I can recommend this to any fan of the Fallout series . I single these fans out because they 're willing to forgive silly bugs like meeting characters who walk into walls or occasionally float in mid @-@ air . These fans realize that the game as a whole is greater than the sum of minor graphical anomalies . On the other hand , I simply can 't ignore or forgive the game for crashing on me when I walk around the Mojave Wasteland ; or for quests that simply can 't be completed because of a game glitch ; or for making my companions disappear when I need them the most during a battle . These are some of the most frustrating bugs I have ever encountered with any game , especially when attached to a series that I deeply enjoy . " 
 = United States Institute of Peace Headquarters = 
 The United States Institute of Peace Headquarters houses staff offices and other facilities for the government @-@ funded think tank focused on peacemaking and conflict avoidance . The building is the first permanent home for the United States Institute of Peace ( USIP ) , established in 1984 . The headquarters is sited on a prominent location near the National Mall and Potomac River in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington , D.C. The environmentally friendly building , noted for its unique roof , was designed by architect Moshe Safdie and completed in 2011 . Critics ' reviews of the building 's design have been mixed . 
 = = History = = 
 In the 1980s , Democratic Senator Jennings Randolph of West Virginia led a group of lawmakers calling for a federal peace institute . USIP was established by Congress in 1984 and for many years rented office space in various buildings in downtown Washington , the last being 1200 17th Street NW . In 1996 , Congress approved a site on the National Mall for USIP . The site chosen for a new headquarters , the first permanent home for the USIP , was on the corner of 23rd Street and Constitution Avenue NW in Foggy Bottom . It was previously a parking lot for Bureau of Medicine and Surgery employees at the adjacent Old Naval Observatory . The land was transferred to the USIP without charge with an agreement that underground parking spaces would be built for the Navy employees . The site is on the northwest corner and last buildable site available on the National Mall , overlooking the Lincoln Memorial , and across the street from the historic American Institute of Pharmacy Building . 
 In 2004 , Congress authorized $ 100 million for construction of USIP 's headquarters , in part due to the efforts of Republican Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska , while the institute was required to raise the remaining $ 86 million . The funds raised by USIP included a $ 10 million donation from Chevron Corporation . Another corporate donor to the building fund , defense contractor Lockheed Martin , was named a " Founding Corporate Partner " after donating $ 1 million . William Hartung of the Center for International Policy criticized the USIP for " taking money from the world 's largest producer of the weapons of war . " 
 In April 2001 , USIP issued solicitations for a design and twenty @-@ six architects submitted proposals . Moshe Safdie had never heard of USIP before receiving the design request , but he was one of the five finalists chosen . The other four were Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects , Michael Graves and Associates , Polshek Partnership ( now known as Ennead Architects ) , and Weiss / Manfredi ( which withdrew ) . According to USIP president Richard H. Solomon , Safdie 's design was chosen because the other designs " were basically square buildings . " USIP 's headquarters is the second building in Washington , D.C. designed by Safdie . The first was the fortress @-@ like headquarters of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , completed in 2008 , which dominates the busy intersection of Florida and New York Avenues NE . 
 The National Capital Planning Commission ( NCPC ) unanimously approved plans for the building in 2007 . The groundbreaking ceremony took place the following year in June . Dignitaries in attendance included President George W. Bush , Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci , and former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger , George P. Shultz , and Madeleine Albright . During the ceremony , some of the speakers hinted their opposing views of Bush 's use of preventive war . Construction of the 154 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 14 @,@ 300 m2 ) headquarters , which is LEED Gold certified , was carried out by Clark Construction Group of Bethesda , Maryland . The U.S. Green Building Council certified it as the first environmentally friendly building on the National Mall . The headquarters , which is managed by real estate services firm Akridge , was dedicated in October 2011 . That same year , the Samuel W. Lewis Hall was dedicated in honor of the former ambassador to Israel and USIP president . "

 According to Safdie , the building " is by definition the physical symbol of peace in the capital 's skyline " and needed to convey the spirit of peace . Safdie stated : " I 'm not one who believes in overt symbolism , but my sense of a building dedicated to peace was a sense of the lightness of being , ... It should be a serene building . It should not be an aggressive building . It should be full of light . " Safdie achieved this by designing a glass curtain wall facing the Lincoln Memorial and a billowing glass ceiling . The ceiling is one of the building elements in common with Safdie 's design for the Yitzhak Rabin Center in Israel . The 8 inches ( 20 cm ) thick roof is made of 1 @,@ 482 white glass panels and supported by steel frames while the interior of the roof is covered by a translucent plastic film . It is opaque and white during the day and glows at night . 
 There are two main entrances to the building , one facing Constitution Avenue , and another facing 23rd Street NW . The building is made of acid @-@ etched precast @-@ concrete and resembles limestone . The design is centered around two atria , a large one facing the National Mall that is designed for the public , and a smaller private one for staff that overlooks the Potomac River . The larger atrium , the George P. Shultz Great Hall , measures 11 @,@ 800 sq ft ( 1 @,@ 100 m2 ) and features the 80 ft ( 24 m ) high glass curtain wall facing the National Mall . The 230 @-@ seat Frank C. Carlucci III Auditorium , Jacqueline and Marc Leland Atrium , and 20 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 1 @,@ 900 m2 ) Global Peacebuilding Center , an interactive museum dedicated to peacemaking , are accessible via this atrium . The roof over the Great Hall , designed to convey a dove 's wings , is called Ansary Peace Dove . The second atrium , also known as the International Women ’ s Commons , measures 3 @,@ 600 sq ft ( 330 m2 ) and is lined with offices , a library , meeting rooms , conference center , and the Farooq <unk> Amphitheatre . The roof over this atrium is a simplified version of Ansary Peace Dove . There is a 2 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 190 m2 ) outdoor terrace and adjoining boardroom facing the Lincoln Memorial . A three @-@ story underground parking garage can accommodate 230 vehicles ; 140 of those spaces are reserved for Navy personnel .

 Katherine Gustafson of <unk> thought the building " succeeds as a monumental edifice befitting its place in the urban frame of the National Mall " while Nathan Guttman of The Jewish Daily Forward described the headquarters as an " architectural gem . " Architect Roger K. Lewis , professor emeritus of architecture at the University of Maryland , had mixed feelings about the building . He said it was " most visible and aesthetically enticing after dark " , while its " unique , idiosyncratic form appears somewhat less enticing " during the day . During the NCPC meeting in 2007 giving final approval to the building , a National Park Service representative said " This building will be a foreign object in the landscape of classical architecture of this city " , criticizing the design compared to the neoclassical and Beaux @-@ Arts buildings along Constitution Avenue . The building is highly visible to commuters on Interstate 66 as they enter the city , a fact lamented by Philip Kennicott , Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning critic for The Washington Post . In two scathing reviews of the headquarters , Kennicott said " If it were not for the roof , the building would be unexceptional , just another exercise in boxy architecture pierced by deadening rows of identical rectangular windows " and " The institute ’ s design marks yet another low point in Safdie ’ s long descent into repetitive corporate architecture .

 Davenport is the county seat of Scott County in Iowa and is the largest of the Quad Cities , a metropolitan area with a population estimate of 382 @,@ 630 and a CSA population of 474 @,@ 226 , making it the 90th largest CSA in the nation . Davenport was founded on May 14 , 1836 by Antoine LeClaire and was named for his friend , George Davenport , a colonel during the Black Hawk War stationed at nearby Fort Armstrong . According to the 2010 census , the city had a population of 99 @,@ 685 ( making it Iowa 's third @-@ largest city ) . However , the city is currently appealing this figure , arguing that the Census Bureau missed a section of residents that would place the total population over 100 @,@ 000 , and indeed , even the Census Bureau 's own estimate for Davenport 's 2011 population is 100 @,@ 802 . 
 Located approximately halfway between Chicago and Des Moines , Davenport is on the border of Iowa and Illinois . The city is prone to frequent flooding due to its location on the Mississippi River . There are two main universities : Saint Ambrose University and Palmer College of Chiropractic , which is where the first chiropractic adjustment took place . Several annual music festivals take place in Davenport , including the Mississippi Valley Blues Festival , The Mississippi Valley Fair , and the Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival . An internationally known 7 @-@ mile ( 11 km ) foot race called the Bix 7 is run during the festival . The city has a Class A minor league baseball team , the Quad Cities River Bandits . Davenport has 50 plus parks and facilities , as well as over 20 miles ( 32 km ) of recreational paths for biking or walking . 
 Four interstates and two major United States Highways serve the city . Davenport has seen steady population growth since its incorporation , with an exception being the 1980s , when the population decreased due to job loss . The Quad Cities was ranked as the most affordable metropolitan area in 2010 by Forbes . In 2007 , Davenport , along with neighboring Rock Island , won the City Livability Award in the small @-@ city category from the U.S. Conference of Mayors . In 2012 , Davenport as well as the Quad Cities Metropolitan Area was ranked among the fastest @-@ growing areas in the nation in the growth of high @-@ tech jobs . Notable natives of the city have included jazz legend Bix Beiderbecke , Pulitzer Prize @-@ winning playwright Susan <unk> , former National Football League running back Roger Craig , and former WWE World Heavyweight Championship holder Seth Rollins . 
 The current mayor of Davenport is Frank Klipsch . 
 = = History = = 
 The land was originally owned by the Sauk people , Meskwaki ( Fox ) , and Ho @-@ Chunk ( Winnebago ) - indigenous peoples of the Americas . In 1803 France sold it to the United States under the Louisiana Purchase . Lieutenant Zebulon Pike was the first United States representative to officially visit the Upper Mississippi River area . On August 27 , 1805 , Pike camped on the present day site of Davenport . 
 In 1832 , a group of Sauk , Meskwaki , and Kickapoo people were defeated by the United States in the Black Hawk War . The United States government then concluded the Black Hawk Purchase , sometimes called the Forty @-@ Mile Strip or Scott 's Purchase , by which the US acquired lands in what is now eastern Iowa . The purchase was made for $ 640 @,@ 000 on September 21 , 1832 and contained an area of some 6 million acres ( 24 @,@ 000 km ² ) , at a price equivalent to 11 cents / acre ( 26 $ / km ² ) . Although named after the defeated chief Black Hawk , he was being held prisoner at the time . The purchase was therefore agreed to by Sauk chief Keokuk , who had remained neutral in the war . It was made on the site of present @-@ day Davenport . Army General Winfield Scott and Governor of Illinois , John Reynolds , acted on behalf of the United States , with the future Davenport founder , half @-@ Native , Antoine LeClaire serving as translator . 
 Chief Keokuk gave a generous portion of land to Antoine LeClaire 's wife , Marguerite , who was a granddaughter of a Sauk chief . Antoine built their home on the exact spot where the agreement was signed , as stipulated by Keokuk or he would have forfeited the land . Antoine did so , finishing the ' Treaty House ' in the spring of 1833 . Davenport was established on May 14 , 1836 by LeClaire , and named after his friend Colonel George Davenport , who was stationed at Fort Armstrong during the war . The city was incorporated on January 25 , 1839 . The area was successively governed by the legislatures of the Michigan Territory , the Wisconsin Territory , Iowa Territory and finally Iowa . 
 Scott County was formed by an act of the Wisconsin Territorial legislature in 1837 . Davenport and neighbor Rockingham both campaigned to become the county seat . The city with the most votes from Scott County citizens in the February 1838 election would become the county seat . On the eve of the election , Davenport citizens acquired the temporary service of Dubuque laborers so they could vote in the election . Davenport won the election with the help of the laborers . Rockingham supporters protested the elections to the territorial governor , on the grounds the laborers from Dubuque were not Scott County residents . The governor refused to certify the results of the election . A second election was held the following August . To avoid another import of voters , the governor set a 60 @-@ day residency requirement for all voters . Davenport was again the victor by only two votes . Because the margin of victory was so close a third election in the summer of 1840 was held . As the August election drew nearer , Rockingham residents grew tired of the county seat cause , and the efforts of Davenporters were difficult to challenge . Davenport easily won the third election . Consequently , to ensure that the county seat issue would not be played out again , Davenport built the first county courthouse . 
 Rock Island Railroad built the first railroad bridge across the Mississippi River in 1856 . It connected Davenport to Rock Island , Illinois . This railway connection caused transportation and commerce with Chicago to significantly improve . The addition of new railroad lines to Muscatine and Iowa City , and the acquiring of other lines by the Rock Island Railroad , caused Davenport to become a commercial railroad hub . 
 Steamboat companies saw nationwide railroads as a threat to their business and on May 6 , 1856 , just weeks after the bridge was completed , a steamboat captain deliberately crashed the Effie Afton into the bridge . The owner of the Effie Afton , John Hurd , filed a lawsuit against the Rock Island Railroad Company . Abraham Lincoln was the lead defense lawyer for the railroad company . The decision of the United States Supreme Court upheld the right to bridge navigable streams , therefore the bridge was allowed to remain . 
 Prior to the start of the Civil War , Governor Samuel J. Kirkwood declared Davenport to be Iowa 's first military headquarters and five camps were set up in the city to aid the Union . 
 The Davenport City Hall was built in 1895 for the meager price of $ 100 @,@ 000 ( $ 2 @.@ 84 million in 2016 dollars ) . Architectural journals of the time poked fun at the project due to the small amount of money budgeted . The skyline began forming in the 1920s with the building of the Kahl Building , the Parker Building , and the Capitol Theatre during an economic and building expansion . 
 By 1932 thousands of Davenport residents were on public relief due to the Great Depression . A shantytown grew in the west end of the city along the Mississippi River . Sickness , hunger , and unsanitary living conditions plagued the area . The situation would soon change , as many citizens went to work for the Works Progress Administration and Davenport experienced a boom after World War II . Oscar Mayer , Ralston Purina , and other companies built plants in west Davenport . The Interstate highway network was brought to Davenport in 1956 . By 1959 more than 1 @,@ 000 homes a year were being constructed . By the late 1970s the good times were over for both downtown and local businesses and industries . The farm crisis of the 1980s negatively affected Davenport and the rest of the Quad Cities , 35 @,@ 000 workers lost their jobs throughout the entire Quad Cities area . The Caterpillar plant on the city 's north side closed , causing the loss of employment for many residents . The 1990s showed the beginnings of a resurgence for the city . In recent years , many renovations and building additions have occurred to revitalize the downtown area , including repairing Modern Woodmen Park , the building of the Skybridge and the Figge Art Museum . In 2011 , the Gold Coast and Hamburg Historic District was named as a 2011 America 's Great Place by the American Planning Association .

Davenport is located approximately 170 miles ( 270 km ) west of Chicago and 170 miles ( 270 km ) east of the Iowa state capital of Des Moines . The city is located about 200 miles ( 320 km ) north of St. Louis , Missouri , and 265 miles ( 426 km ) southeast of Minneapolis , Minnesota . Farmland surrounds Davenport , outside the Quad Cities area . 
 Davenport is located on the banks of the Mississippi River . At this point the river has a maximum depth of around 30 to 40 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 to 12 @.@ 2 m ) and is 2 @,@ 217 feet ( 676 m ) wide where the Centennial Bridge crosses it . The river flows from east to west along Davenport 's banks , as opposed to its usual north to south direction . From the river the city starts to slope north up a hill , which is steep at some points . The streets of the city , especially downtown and in the central part of the town , follow a grid design . Davenport often makes national headlines when the Mississippi River floods . It is the largest city bordering the Mississippi that has no permanent flood wall or levee . Davenport prefers the open access to the river for parks and vistas over having access cut off by dikes and levees . Davenport has adopted ordinances that any new construction in the floodplain must be elevated above the 100 @-@ year @-@ flood level or protected with walls . As a result , former mayor Phil <unk> publicly expressed the view that if they " let Mother Nature take her course , we 'll all be better off " . An example of a building that is elevated or flood @-@ proofed in Davenport is the Figge Art Museum .

Substantial weather changes frequently occur at three- to four @-@ day intervals as a result of mid @-@ latitude storm tracks , which is where low and high pressure extratropical disturbances occur . 
 No devastating tornado has ever touched down in Davenport . Flooding , however , is often a problem in Davenport due to the lack of a flood wall . During the Great Flood of 1993 , the water crested at 22 @.@ 63 feet ( 6 @.@ 90 m ) on July 9 . This is nearly 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) above the 14 @.@ 9 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 5 m ) flood stage . Major flooding in Davenport causes many problems . Roads in and around the downtown area , including U.S. Route 67 , are closed and cause increased traffic on other city roads . The effects of major flooding can be long @-@ lasting . For example , during the 2008 flooding , Credit Island in the city 's southwest corner remained closed for 5 ½ months while crews worked on cleaning up damage and removing river debris . Duck Creek , a stream situated in Bettendorf and Davenport , is also vulnerable to flash flooding . Severe thunderstorms on June 16 , 1990 , created heavy flash flooding in Bettendorf and Davenport that killed four people . Another major flood happened on June 12 , 2008 , when severe thunderstorms caused Duck Creek to overflow its banks and flood properties and nearby streets ( see Iowa flood of 2008 ) .

 Davenport has several neighborhoods dating back to the 1840s . The original city plot was around current day Ripley and 5th Streets , where Antoine LeClaire had built his house . The city can be divided into five areas : downtown , central , east end , near north and northwest , and west end . Many architectural designs are found throughout the city including Victorian , Queen Anne , Tudor Revival , and others . Many of the original neighborhoods were inhabited by German settlers . 
 The east side of the city dates back to 1850 and has always contained higher end housing . The proximity and commanding view of the river kept these neighborhoods a fashionable address long after the original families departed . Lindsay Park , in The Village of East Davenport , was used as parade grounds for Civil War soldiers from Camp McClellan . 
 In contrast to the east side , the central and west neighborhoods originally contained many of the working class Germans who settled the town . Development on the west side started in the 1850s with extensive construction occurring in the 1870s . Housing was mostly one and a half to two story front gable American Foursquare and simplified Queen Anne style . The central Hamburg neighborhood contains the most architecturally significant residences in the old German neighborhoods . Also in central Davenport , the Vander Veer Park Historic District is a neighborhood anchored by Vander Veer Park , a large park with a botanical garden and a fountain . The park was modeled after New York City 's Central Park and originally shared its name . Vander Veer is surrounded by large Queen Anne and Tudor Revival style houses that were built between 1895 and 1915 . Development of the Vander Veer Park was one of the first major beautification efforts .

The tree , also called the Jackson Oak , is located at the corner of South Finley and Dearing Streets in Athens , Georgia , United States . The original tree fell in 1942 , but a new tree was grown from one of its acorns , and planted in the same location . The current tree is sometimes referred to as the Son of The Tree That Owns Itself . Both trees have appeared in numerous national publications , and the site is a local landmark . 
 = = Legend = = 
 The earliest @-@ known telling of the tree 's story comes from a front @-@ page article entitled " Deeded to Itself " in the Athens Weekly Banner of August 12 , 1890 . The article explains that the tree had been located on the property of Colonel William Henry Jackson . William Jackson was the son of James Jackson ( a soldier in the American Revolution as well as a Congressman , U.S. Senator , and Governor of Georgia ) , and the father of another James Jackson ( a Congressman and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia ) . He was the brother of Jabez Young Jackson , also a Congressman . ( William Jackson was reportedly a professor at the University of Georgia , and is sometimes given the title of Doctor . The nature of his military service and the source of the title " Colonel " are unknown . ) Jackson supposedly cherished childhood memories of the tree , and , desiring to protect it , deeded to it the ownership of itself and its surrounding land . By various accounts , this transaction took place between 1820 and 1832 . According to the newspaper article , the deed read : 
 I , W. H. Jackson , of the county of Clarke , of the one part , and the oak tree ... of the county of Clarke , of the other part : <unk> , That the said W. H. Jackson for and in consideration of the great affection which he bears said tree , and his great desire to see it protected has conveyed , and by these presents do convey unto the said oak tree entire possession of itself and of all land within eight feet of it on all sides . 
 It is unclear whether the story of the Tree That Owns Itself began with the Weekly Banner article , or if it had been an element of local folklore prior to that time . The article 's author writes that , in 1890 , there were few people still living who knew the story . 
 The story of the Tree That Owns Itself is very widely known , and is almost always presented as fact . However , only one person — the anonymous author of " Deeded to Itself " — has ever claimed to have seen Jackson ’ s deed to the tree . Most writers acknowledge that the deed is lost or no longer exists , if in fact it ever did . Such a deed , even if it did exist , would have no legal standing . Under common law , the person receiving the property in question must have the legal capacity to receive it , and the property must be delivered to — and accepted by — the recipient . 
 William H. Jackson did , in fact , own the property on the opposite side of Dearing Street from the tree . That plot included the present @-@ day 226 Dearing Street , but in the early 19th century it was simply designated Lot # 14 . The tree , however , is located on a portion of what had been Lot # 15 . Jackson and his wife Mildred , along with a J. A. Cobb , sold their property to a Dr. Malthus Ward in 1832 , the same year cited on a plaque as being the date of the tree 's deed . The Clarke County real estate indices contain no indication of when or from whom Jackson originally purchased the property , although much of the land in that area is reported to have belonged to a Major James Meriwether . Even though Jackson may have lived near the tree as an adult , his childhood was actually spent in Jefferson County , not in Athens , making it less likely that he had experienced idyllic childhood summers playing beneath the tree 's branches . 
 Recent deeds suggest that the tree 's square footage remains part of the property at 125 Dearing Street . These documents describe a parcel bounded on the east by Finley Street and on the north by Dearing Street , an area that would seem to encompass the tree . However , the actual plat map for that property clearly does not include the tree ’ s oddly shaped corner : its eastern line lies roughly ten feet ( three meters ) to the west of the tree ’ s location — as far as the tax assessor is concerned , the tree ’ s area is not a part of that property . 
 This does not confirm that the tree owns itself , but suggests , rather , that it is considered to be within the right @-@ of @-@ way along Finley Street . Athens @-@ Clarke County confirms that the tree is in the right @-@ of @-@ way , and is thus “ accepted for care ” by municipal authorities ; according to city @-@ county officials , local government and the owners of the adjacent property jointly serve as “ stewards ” for the care of the tree , while Athens ' Junior Ladies ' Garden Club serves as its “ primary advocate . ” Regarding Jackson ’ s deed , one writer noted at the beginning of the 20th century , “ However defective this title may be in law , the public recognized it . ” In that spirit , it is the stated position of the Athens @-@ Clarke County unified government that the tree , in spite of the law , does indeed own itself . 
 = = History = = 
 The original Tree That Owns Itself is estimated to have started life at some time between the mid @-@ 16th and late 18th centuries . The tree was considered by some to be both the biggest tree in Athens and the most famous tree in the United States . The tree predated the transformation of the area into a residential neighborhood beginning in the mid @-@ 19th century . The residence adjacent to the tree , known as <unk> House , was built at the corner of Milledge Avenue and Waddell Street in 1883 , and was moved to its present location about twenty years later . 
 By 1906 , erosion had become apparent at the base of the tree . George Foster Peabody paid to have new soil , a commemorative tablet , and a chain barricade supported by eight granite posts installed around the tree . Despite these efforts , the tree reportedly suffered heavy damage during an ice storm in 1907 . Although attempts were made at preservation , rot had already set in , and the tree was permanently weakened . 
 The original oak fell on the evening of October 9 , 1942 , following a long period of decline . Its poor condition had been known for years , and within days of its collapse , a move was under way to replace the fallen tree with a " son " grown from one of its acorns . One account suggests that the tree had actually died several years before its collapse , the victim of root rot . The tree was over 100 feet ( 30 m ) tall , and was estimated to be between 150 and 400 years old when it fell . It has been reported elsewhere that the tree fell on December 1 , 1942 , succumbing not to old age and disease but rather to a violent windstorm that ravaged much of north Georgia that evening , causing widespread damage and killing several people . While it is possible that some portion of the tree had remained standing for several weeks , meeting a dramatic end at the hands of a killer storm , only the earlier date is supported by newspaper accounts . It is not known why the tree was not dated by counting its rings .

 After the original tree ’ s demise , its small plot sat vacant for four years . Dan Magill , the young son of Athens ’ Junior Ladies Garden Club member Elizabeth Magill , suggested that his mother ’ s club find a replacement for the tree . Several Athenians had cultivated seedlings from acorns of the original tree . That growing in the yard of Capt. Jack Watson , at five feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) in height , was deemed the best candidate for transplantation . The operation was directed by Roy Bowden of the College of Agriculture at the University of Georgia , assisted by students in the Department of Horticulture . 
 The new tree was officially dedicated in a formal ceremony on December 4 , 1946 . Athens Mayor Robert L. McWhorter presided and Dr. E.L. Hill , pastor of the First Presbyterian Church , offered a short prayer . Also in attendance were Capt. and Mrs. Watson and representatives of the Garden Club . Club President Patsy Dudley announced that her group would henceforth take responsibility for maintenance of the tree ’ s plot , which had fallen into disrepair during the vacancy . The new tree , trimmed back to a mere three feet ( one meter ) for transplantation , thrived in its new location . This tree is considered , popularly if not legally , to be the full heir of the original tree . As such , it is sometimes referred to as the Son of The Tree That Owns Itself , although it is generally known by the same title as its progenitor . The tree was over 50 feet ( 15 m ) tall as of 2006 . 
 On December 4 , 1996 , the Garden Club staged a celebration to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the planting of the new tree . Dan Magill , who , as a boy , had inspired the replanting effort , served as master of ceremonies . 
 The tree sits near the crest of a hill , at the southwest corner of the intersection of Dearing and Finley Streets , in a quiet residential neighborhood near downtown Athens and UGA ’ s North Campus . The portion of Finley Street leading up the hill to the tree is Athens ’ only remaining cobblestone street . The tree ’ s lot is separated from the larger portion of the adjacent property by a private driveway ; its enclosure also juts several feet into Finley Street . Thus the tree may in fact appear to occupy a small but separate tract of land . The appearance of separation is accentuated by the retaining wall and ornamental chain barrier that surround the tree . Although located alongside private homes in a residential neighborhood , the Tree That Owns Itself is " open " to the public , and regularly attracts visitors . 
 Although the story of the Tree That Owns Itself is more legend than history , the tree has become ( along with the University Arch and the Double @-@ <unk> Cannon ) one of the most recognized and well @-@ loved symbols of Athens . It is routinely featured in travel guides and other visitor information , and has even garnered international recognition through such publications as Ripley 's Believe It Or Not , where it has been featured on several occasions . 
 = = Tablets = = 
 The site of the tree contains two stone tablets . The first is heavily weathered and has suffered the loss of one corner , while the second appears to be considerably newer . Both tablets paraphrase the same portion of William H. Jackson 's supposed deed to the tree , with slight alterations made to transform the legalistic language into a first @-@ person declaration of affection :

 A small brass plaque , about the size of a playing card , is attached to the lower left corner of the face of the more weathered of the two tablets . It reads :

 In addition to the stone tablets a larger brass plaque is affixed to the concrete retaining wall that surrounds the tree . The plaque reads :

 The entire Dearing Street Historic District ( of which the tree is a " resident " ) was added to the National Register in 1975 . The District incorporates an area very roughly bounded by Broad , Finley , Waddell , and Church Streets , and was recognized for its architectural significance . The tree was locally designated a historic landmark on February 2 , 1988 . 
 = Carmen = 
 Carmen ( French pronunciation : ​ [ <unk> ] ; Spanish : [ <unk> ] ) is an opera in four acts by French composer Georges Bizet . The libretto was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy , based on a novella of the same title by Prosper Mérimée . The opera was first performed at the Opéra @-@ Comique in Paris on 3 March 1875 , where its breaking of conventions shocked and scandalized its first audiences . Bizet died suddenly after the 33rd performance , unaware that the work would achieve international acclaim within the following ten years . Carmen has since become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas in the classical canon ; the " Habanera " from act 1 and the " Toreador Song " from act 2 are among the best known of all operatic arias . 
 The opera is written in the genre of opéra comique with musical numbers separated by dialogue . It is set in southern Spain and tells the story of the downfall of Don José , a naïve soldier who is seduced by the wiles of the fiery gypsy Carmen . José abandons his childhood sweetheart and deserts from his military duties , yet loses Carmen 's love to the glamorous toreador Escamillo , after which José kills her in a jealous rage . The depictions of proletarian life , immorality , and lawlessness , and the tragic death of the main character on stage , broke new ground in French opera and were highly controversial . 
 After the premiere , most reviews were critical , and the French public was generally indifferent . Carmen initially gained its reputation through a series of productions outside France , and was not revived in Paris until 1883 ; thereafter it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad . Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th @-@ century Italian opera . 
 The music of Carmen has since been widely acclaimed for brilliance of melody , harmony , atmosphere , and orchestration , and for the skill with which Bizet musically represented the emotions and suffering of his characters . After the composer 's death , the score was subject to significant amendment , including the introduction of recitative in place of the original dialogue ; there is no standard edition of the opera , and different views exist as to what versions best express Bizet 's intentions . The opera has been recorded many times since the first acoustical recording in 1908 , and the story has been the subject of many screen and stage adaptations . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the Paris of the 1860s , despite being a Prix de Rome laureate , Bizet struggled to get his stage works performed . The capital 's two main state @-@ funded opera houses — the Opéra and the Opéra @-@ Comique — followed conservative repertoires that restricted opportunities for young native talent . Bizet 's professional relationship with Léon Carvalho , manager of the independent Théâtre Lyrique company , enabled him to bring to the stage two full @-@ scale operas , Les pêcheurs de perles ( 1863 ) and La jolie fille de Perth ( 1867 ) , but neither enjoyed much public success . 
 When artistic life in Paris resumed after the Franco @-@ Prussian War of 1870 – 71 , Bizet found wider opportunities for the performance of his works ; his one @-@ act opera Djamileh opened at the Opéra @-@ Comique in May 1872 . Although this failed and was withdrawn after 11 performances , it led to a further commission from the theatre , this time for a full @-@ length opera for which Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halévy would provide the libretto . Halévy , who had written the text for Bizet 's student opera Le docteur Miracle ( 1856 ) , was a cousin of Bizet 's wife , Geneviève ; he and Meilhac had a solid reputation as the librettists of many of Jacques Offenbach 's operettas . 
 Bizet was delighted with the Opéra @-@ Comique commission , and expressed to his friend Edmund Galabert his satisfaction in " the absolute certainty of having found my path " . The subject of the projected work was a matter of discussion between composer , librettists and the Opéra @-@ Comique management ; Adolphe de Leuven , on behalf of the theatre , made several suggestions that were politely rejected . It was Bizet who first proposed an adaptation of Prosper Mérimée 's novella Carmen . Mérimée 's story is a blend of travelogue and adventure yarn , possibly inspired by the writer 's lengthy travels in Spain in 1830 , and had originally been published in 1845 in the journal Revue des deux Mondes . It may have been influenced in part by Alexander Pushkin 's 1824 poem " The Gypsies " , a work Mérimée had translated into French ; it has also been suggested that the story was developed from an incident told to Mérimée by his friend the Countess Montijo . Bizet may first have encountered the story during his Rome sojourn of 1858 – 60 , since his journals record Mérimée as one of the writers whose works he absorbed in those years .

 Place : Seville , Spain , and surrounding hills 
 Time : Around 1820 
 Act 1 
 A square , in Seville . On the right , a door to the tobacco factory . At the back , a bridge . On the left , a guardhouse . 
 A group of soldiers relaxes in the square , waiting for the changing of the guard and commenting on the passers @-@ by ( " Sur la place , chacun passe " ) . Micaëla appears , seeking José . <unk> tells her that " José is not yet on duty " and invites her to wait with them . She declines , saying she will return later . José arrives with the new guard , which is greeted and imitated by a crowd of urchins ( " Avec la garde <unk> " ) . 
 As the factory bell rings , the cigarette girls emerge and exchange banter with young men in the crowd ( " La cloche a <unk> " ) . Carmen enters and sings her provocative habanera on the <unk> nature of love ( " L 'amour est un oiseau <unk> " ) . The men plead with her to choose a lover , and after some teasing she throws a flower to Don José , who thus far has been ignoring her but is now annoyed by her insolence . 
 As the women go back to the factory , Micaëla returns and gives José a letter and a kiss from his mother ( " Parle @-@ moi de ma mère ! " ) . He reads that his mother wants him to return home and marry Micaëla , who retreats in shy embarrassment on learning this . Just as José declares that he is ready to heed his mother 's wishes , the women stream from the factory in great agitation . Zuniga , the officer of the guard , learns that Carmen has attacked a woman with a knife . When challenged , Carmen answers with mocking defiance ( " Tra la la ... Coupe @-@ moi , <unk> @-@ moi " ) ; Zuniga orders José to tie her hands while he prepares the prison warrant . Left alone with José , Carmen <unk> him with a <unk> , in which she sings of a night of dancing and passion with her lover — whoever that may be — in Lillas Pastia 's tavern . Confused yet mesmerised , José agrees to free her hands ; as she is led away she pushes her escort to the ground and runs off laughing . José is arrested for dereliction of duty . 
 Act 2 
 Lillas Pastia 's Inn 
 A month has passed . Carmen and her friends Frasquita and Mercédès are entertaining Zuniga and other officers ( " Les <unk> des <unk> <unk> " ) in Pastia 's inn . Carmen is delighted to learn of José 's release from a month 's detention . Outside , a chorus and procession announces the arrival of the toreador Escamillo ( " Vivat , <unk> le <unk> " ) . Invited inside , he introduces himself with the " Toreador Song " ( " Votre toast , je <unk> vous le <unk> " ) and sets his sights on Carmen , who brushes him aside . Lillas Pastia hustles the crowds and the soldiers away . 
 When only Carmen , Frasquita and Mercédès remain , the smugglers <unk> and <unk> arrive and reveal their plans to dispose of some recently acquired contraband ( " Nous avons en tête une affaire " ) . Frasquita and Mercédès are keen to help them , but Carmen refuses , since she wishes to wait for José . After the smugglers leave , José arrives . Carmen treats him to a private exotic dance ( " Je <unk> <unk> en votre honneur ... La la la " ) , but her song is joined by a distant bugle call from the barracks . When José says he must return to duty , she mocks him , and he answers by showing her the flower that she threw to him in the square ( " La fleur que tu m 'avais <unk> " ) . Unconvinced , Carmen demands he show his love by leaving with her . José refuses to desert , but as he prepares to depart , Zuniga enters looking for Carmen . He and José fight , and are separated by the returning smugglers , who restrain Zuniga . Having attacked a superior officer , José now has no choice but to join Carmen and the smugglers ( " <unk> @-@ nous à travers la campagne " ) . 
 Act 3 
 A wild spot in the mountains 
 Carmen and José enter with the smugglers and their booty ( " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> " ) ; Carmen has now become bored with José and tells him scornfully that he should go back to his mother . Frasquita and Mercédès amuse themselves by reading their fortunes from the cards ; Carmen joins them and finds that the cards are foretelling her death , and José 's . The women depart to <unk> the customs officers who are watching the locality . José is placed on guard duty . 
 Micaëla enters with a guide , seeking José and determined to rescue him from Carmen ( " Je dis que rien ne m <unk> " ) . On hearing a gunshot she hides in fear ; it is José , who has fired at an intruder who proves to be Escamillo . José 's pleasure at meeting the bullfighter turns to anger when Escamillo declares his infatuation with Carmen . The pair fight ( " Je suis Escamillo , <unk> de Grenade " ) , but are interrupted by the returning smugglers and girls ( " <unk> , <unk> José " ) . As Escamillo leaves he invites everyone to his next bullfight in Seville . Micaëla is discovered ; at first , José will not leave with her despite Carmen 's mockery , but he agrees to go when told that his mother is dying . As he departs , vowing he will return , Escamillo is heard in the distance , singing the toreador 's song . 
 Act 4 
 A square in Seville . At the back , the walls of an ancient amphitheatre 
 Zuniga , Frasquita and Mercédès are among the crowd awaiting the arrival of the bullfighters ( " Les <unk> ! Voici la quadrille ! " ) . Escamillo enters with Carmen , and they express their mutual love ( " Si tu m 'aimes , Carmen " ) . As Escamillo goes into the arena , Frasquita warns Carmen that José is nearby , but Carmen is unafraid and willing to speak to him . Alone , she is confronted by the desperate José ( " C 'est toi ! C 'est moi ! " ) . While he pleads vainly for her to return to him , cheers are heard from the arena . As José makes his last entreaty , Carmen contemptuously throws down the ring he gave her and attempts to enter the arena . He then stabs her , and as Escamillo is acclaimed by the crowds , Carmen dies . José kneels and sings " Ah ! Carmen ! ma Carmen <unk> ! " ; as the crowd exits the arena , José confesses to killing the woman he loved .

 Meilhac and Halévy were a long @-@ standing duo with an established division of labour : Meilhac , who was completely unmusical , wrote the dialogue and Halévy the verses . There is no clear indication of when work began on Carmen . Bizet and the two librettists were all in Paris during 1873 and easily able to meet ; thus there is little written record or correspondence relating to the beginning of the collaboration . The libretto was prepared in accordance with the conventions of opéra comique , with dialogue separating musical numbers . It deviates from Mérimée 's novella in a number of significant respects . In the original , events are spread over a much longer period of time , and much of the main story is narrated by José from his prison cell , as he awaits execution for Carmen 's murder . Micaëla does not feature in Mérimée 's version , and the Escamillo character is peripheral — a <unk> named Lucas who is only briefly Carmen 's grand passion . Carmen has a husband called Garcia , whom José kills during a quarrel . In the novella , Carmen and José are presented much less sympathetically than they are in the opera ; Bizet 's biographer Mina Curtiss comments that Mérimée 's Carmen , on stage , would have seemed " an unmitigated and unconvincing monster , had her character not been simplified and deepened " . 
 With rehearsals due to begin in October 1873 , Bizet began composing in or around January of that year , and by the summer had completed the music for the first act and perhaps sketched more . At that point , according to Bizet 's biographer Winton Dean , " some hitch at the Opéra @-@ Comique intervened " , and the project was suspended for a while . One reason for the delay may have been the difficulties in finding a singer for the title role . Another was a split that developed between the joint directors of the theatre , Camille du Locle and Adolphe de Leuven , over the advisability of staging the work . De Leuven had vociferously opposed the entire notion of presenting so risqué a story in what he considered a family theatre and was sure that audiences would be frightened away . He was assured by Halévy that the story would be toned down , that Carmen 's character would be softened , and offset by Micaëla , described by Halévy as " a very innocent , very chaste young girl " . Furthermore , the gypsies would be presented as comic characters , and Carmen 's death would be overshadowed at the end by " triumphal processions , ballets and joyous fanfares " . De Leuven reluctantly agreed , but his continuing hostility towards the project led to his resignation from the theatre early in 1874 . 
 After the various delays , Bizet appears to have resumed work on Carmen early in 1874 . He completed the draft of the composition — 1 @,@ 200 pages of music — in the summer , which he spent at the artists ' colony at Bougival , just outside Paris . He was pleased with the result , informing a friend : " I have written a work that is all clarity and vivacity , full of colour and melody " . During the period of rehearsals , which began in October , Bizet repeatedly altered the music — sometimes at the request of the orchestra who found some of it impossible to perform , sometimes to meet the demands of individual singers , and otherwise in response to the demands of the theatre 's management . The vocal score that Bizet published in March 1875 shows significant changes from the version of the score that he sold to the publishers , <unk> , in January 1875 ; the conducting score used at the premiere differs from each of these documents . There is no definitive edition , and there are differences among musicologists about which version represents the composer 's true intentions . Bizet also changed the libretto , reordering sequences and imposing his own verses where he felt that the librettists had strayed too far from the character of Mérimée 's original . Among other changes , he provided new words for Carmen 's " Habanera " , and rewrote the text of Carmen 's solo in the act 3 card scene . He also provided a new opening line for the " Seguidilla " in act 1 . 
 = = = Characterisation = = = 
 Most of the characters in Carmen — the soldiers , the smugglers , the Gypsy women and the secondary leads Micaëla and Escamillo — are reasonably familiar types within the opéra comique tradition , although drawing them from proletarian life was unusual . The two principals , José and Carmen , lie outside the genre . While each is presented quite differently from Mérimée 's portrayals of a murderous brigand and a treacherous , amoral schemer , even in their relatively sanitised forms neither corresponds to the norms of opéra comique . They are more akin to the verismo style that would find fuller expression in the works of Puccini . 
 Dean considers that José is the central figure of the opera : " It is his fate rather than Carmen 's that interests us " . The music characterizes his gradual decline , act by act , from honest soldier to deserter , vagabond and finally murderer . In act 1 he is a simple countryman aligned musically with Micaëla ; in act 2 he evinces a greater toughness , the result of his experiences as a prisoner , but it is clear that by the end of the act his infatuation with Carmen has driven his emotions beyond control . Dean describes him in act 3 as a trapped animal who refuses to leave his cage even when the door is opened for him , ravaged by a mix of conscience , jealousy and despair . In the final act his music assumes a grimness and purposefulness that reflects his new fatalism : " He will make one more appeal ; if Carmen refuses , he knows what to do " . 
 Carmen herself , says Dean , is a new type of operatic heroine representing a new kind of love , not the innocent kind associated with the " spotless soprano " school , but something altogether more vital and dangerous . Her capriciousness , fearlessness and love of freedom are all musically represented : " She is redeemed from any suspicion of vulgarity by her qualities of courage and fatalism so vividly realised in the music " . Curtiss suggests that Carmen 's character , spiritually and musically , may be a realisation of the composer 's own unconscious longing for a freedom denied to him by his stifling marriage . Harold C. Schonberg likens Carmen to " a female Don Giovanni . She would rather die than be false to herself " . The dramatic personality of the character , and the range of moods she is required to express , call for exceptional acting and singing talents . This has deterred some of opera 's most distinguished exponents ; Maria Callas , though she recorded the part , never performed it on stage . The musicologist Hugh Macdonald observes that " French opera never produced another femme as fatale as Carmen " , though she may have influenced some of Massenet 's heroines . Macdonald suggests that outside the French repertoire , Richard Strauss 's Salome and Alban Berg 's Lulu " may be seen as distant degenerate descendants of Bizet 's temptress " . 
 Bizet was reportedly contemptuous of the music that he wrote for Escamillo : " Well , they asked for <unk> , and they 've got it " , he is said to have remarked about the toreador 's song — but , as Dean comments , " the triteness lies in the character , not in the music " . Micaëla 's music has been criticised for its " <unk> " elements , although Dean maintains that her music has greater vitality than that of any of Gounod 's own heroines .

 The search for a singer @-@ actress to play Carmen began in the summer of 1873 . Press speculation favoured Zulma <unk> , who was perhaps the librettists ' preferred choice . She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach 's operas , but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable . In September an approach was made to Marie Roze , well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra @-@ Comique , the Opéra and in London . She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage . The role was then offered to <unk> Galli @-@ Marié , who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months ' negotiation . Galli @-@ Marié , a demanding and at times tempestuous performer , would prove a staunch ally of Bizet , often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the work should be toned down . At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal . 
 The leading tenor part of Don José was given to Paul Lhérie , a rising star of the Opéra @-@ Comique who had recently appeared in works by Massenet and Delibes . He would later become a baritone , and in 1887 sang the role of Zurga in the Covent Garden premiere of Les pêcheurs de perles . Jacques <unk> , engaged to sing Escamillo , was a young Belgian @-@ born baritone who had already appeared in demanding roles such as <unk> in Gounod 's Faust and as Mozart 's Figaro . Marguerite <unk> , who sang Micaëla , was at the beginning of a short career in which she was briefly a star at London 's Theatre Royal , Drury Lane ; the impresario James H. Mapleson thought her " one of the most charming vocalists it has been my pleasure to know " . However , she married and left the stage altogether in 1876 , refusing Mapleson 's considerable cash inducements to return .

 Because rehearsals did not start until October 1874 and lasted longer than anticipated , the premiere was delayed . The final rehearsals went well , and in a generally optimistic mood the first night was fixed for 3 March 1875 , the day on which , coincidentally , Bizet 's appointment as a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour was formally announced . The premiere , which was conducted by Adolphe <unk> , was attended by many of Paris 's leading musical figures , including Massenet , Offenbach , Delibes and Gounod ; during the performance the last @-@ named was overheard complaining bitterly that Bizet had stolen the music of Micaëla 's act 3 aria from him : " That melody is mine ! " Halévy recorded his impressions of the premiere in a letter to a friend ; the first act was evidently well received , with applause for the main numbers and numerous curtain calls . The first part of act 2 also went well , but after the toreador 's song there was , Halévy noted , " coldness " . In act 3 only Micaëla 's aria earned applause as the audience became increasingly disconcerted . The final act was " glacial from first to last " , and Bizet was left " only with the consolations of a few friends " . The critic Ernest Newman wrote later that the sentimentalist Opéra @-@ Comique audience was " shocked by the drastic realism of the action " and by the low standing and defective morality of most of the characters . According to the composer Benjamin Godard , Bizet retorted , in response to a compliment , " Don 't you see that all these bourgeois have not understood a wretched word of the work I have written for them ? " In a different vein , shortly after the work had concluded , Massenet sent Bizet a congratulatory note : " How happy you must be at this time — it 's a great success ! " . 
 The general tone of the next day 's press reviews ranged from disappointment to outrage . The more conservative critics complained about " Wagnerism " and the subordination of the voice to the noise of the orchestra . There was consternation that the heroine was an amoral seductress rather than a woman of virtue ; Galli @-@ Marié 's interpretation of the role was described by one critic as " the very incarnation of vice " . Others compared the work unfavourably with the traditional Opéra @-@ Comique repertoire of Auber and Boieldieu . Léon Escudier in L 'Art Musical called Carmen 's music " dull and obscure ... the ear grows weary of waiting for the cadence that never comes " . It seemed that Bizet had generally failed to fulfill expectations , both of those who ( given Halévy 's and Meilhac 's past associations ) had expected something in the Offenbach mould , and of critics such as Adolphe Jullien who had anticipated a Wagnerian music drama . Among the few supportive critics was the poet Théodore de Banville ; writing in Le National , he applauded Bizet for presenting a drama with real men and women instead of the usual Opéra @-@ Comique " puppets " . 
 In its initial run at the Opéra @-@ Comique , Carmen provoked little public enthusiasm ; it shared the theatre for a while with Verdi 's much more popular Requiem . Carmen was often performed to half @-@ empty houses , even when the management gave away large numbers of tickets . Early on 3 June , the day after the opera 's 33rd performance , Bizet died suddenly of heart disease , at the age of 36 . It was his wedding anniversary . That night 's performance was cancelled ; the tragic circumstances brought a temporary increase in public interest during the brief period before the season ended . Du Locle brought Carmen back in November 1875 , with the original cast , and it ran for a further 12 performances until 15 February 1876 to give a year 's total for the original production of 48 . Among those who attended one of these later performances was Tchaikovsky , who wrote to his benefactor , Nadezhda von Meck : " Carmen is a masterpiece in every sense of the word ... one of those rare creations which expresses the efforts of a whole musical epoch " . After the final performance , Carmen was not seen in Paris again until 1883 .

 Shortly before his death Bizet signed a contract for a production of Carmen by the Vienna Court Opera . For this version , first staged on 23 October 1875 , Bizet 's friend Ernest Guiraud replaced the original dialogue with recitatives , to create a " grand opera " format . Guiraud also reorchestrated music from Bizet 's L 'Arlésienne suite to provide a spectacular ballet for Carmen 's second act . Shortly before the initial Vienna performance the Court Opera 's director Franz von <unk> decided to use parts of the original dialogue along with some of Guiraud 's recitatives ; this hybrid and the full recitative version became the norms for productions of the opera outside France for most of the next century . 
 Despite its deviations from Bizet 's original format , and some critical reservations , the 1875 Vienna production was a great success with the city 's public , and won praise from both Wagner and Brahms . The latter reportedly saw the opera 20 times , and said that he would have " gone to the ends of the earth to embrace Bizet " . The Viennese triumph began the opera 's rapid ascent towards worldwide fame . In February 1876 it began a run in Brussels at La Monnaie ; it returned there the following year , with Galli @-@ Marié in the title role , and thereafter became a permanent fixture in the Brussels repertory . On 17 June 1878 Carmen was produced in London , at Her Majesty 's Theatre , where Minnie Hauk began her long association with the part of Carmen . A parallel London production at Covent Garden , with Adelina Patti , was cancelled when Patti withdrew . The successful Her Majesty 's production , sung in Italian , had an equally enthusiastic reception in Dublin . On 23 October 1878 the opera received its American premiere , at the New York Academy of Music , and in the same year was introduced to Saint Petersburg . 
 In the following five years performances were given in numerous American and European cities , the opera finding particular favour in Germany , where the Chancellor , Otto von Bismarck , apparently saw it on 27 different occasions and where Friedrich Nietzsche opined that he " became a better man when Bizet speaks to me " . Carmen was also acclaimed in numerous French provincial cities including Marseille , Lyon and , in 1881 , Dieppe , where Galli @-@ Marié returned to the role . In August 1881 the singer wrote to Bizet 's widow to report that Carmen 's Spanish premiere , in Barcelona , had been " another great success " . But Carvalho , who had assumed the management of the Opéra @-@ Comique , thought the work immoral and refused to reinstate it . Meilhac and <unk> were more prepared to countenance a revival , provided that Galli @-@ Marié had no part in it ; they blamed her interpretation for the relative failure of the opening run . 
 In April 1883 Carvalho finally revived Carmen at the Opéra @-@ Comique , with Adèle Isaac featuring in an under @-@ rehearsed production that removed some of the controversial aspects of the original . Carvalho was roundly condemned by the critics for offering a travesty of what had come to be regarded as a masterpiece of French opera ; nevertheless , this version was acclaimed by the public and played to full houses . In October Carvalho yielded to pressure and revised the production ; he brought back Galli @-@ Marié , and restored the score and libretto to their 1875 forms .

 On 9 January 1884 Carmen was given its first New York Metropolitan Opera performance , to a mixed critical reception . The New York Times welcomed Bizet 's " pretty and effective work " , but compared <unk> <unk> 's interpretation of the title role unfavourably with that of Minnie Hauk . Thereafter Carmen was quickly incorporated into the Met 's regular repertory . In February 1906 Enrico Caruso sang José at the Met for the first time ; he continued to perform in this role until 1919 , two years before his death . On 17 April 1906 , on tour with the Met , he sang the role at the Grand Opera House in San Francisco . Afterwards he sat up until 3 am reading the reviews in the early editions of the following day 's papers . Two hours later he was awakened by the first violent shocks of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake , after which he and his fellow performers made a hurried escape from the Palace Hotel . 
 The popularity of Carmen continued through succeeding generations of American opera @-@ goers ; by the beginning of 2011 the Met alone had performed it almost a thousand times . It enjoyed similar success in other American cities and in all parts of the world , in many different languages . Carmen 's habanera from act 1 , and the toreador 's song " Votre toast " from act 2 , are among the most popular and best @-@ known of all operatic arias , the latter " a splendid piece of swagger " according to Newman , " against which the voices and the eyebrows of purists have long been raised in vain " . Most of the productions outside France followed the example created in Vienna and incorporated lavish ballet interludes and other spectacles , a practice which Mahler abandoned in Vienna when he revived the work there in 1900 . In 1919 Bizet 's aged contemporary Camille Saint @-@ Saëns was still complaining about the " strange idea " of adding a ballet , which he considered " a hideous blemish in that masterpiece " , and he wondered why Bizet 's widow , at that time still living , permitted it . 
 At the Opéra @-@ Comique , after its 1883 revival , Carmen was always presented in the dialogue version with minimal musical embellishments . By 1888 , the year of the 50th anniversary of Bizet 's birth , the opera had been performed there 330 times ; by 1938 , his centenary year , the total of performances at the theatre had reached 2 @,@ 271 . However , outside France the practice of using recitatives remained the norm for many years ; the Carl Rosa Opera Company 's 1947 London production , and Walter Felsenstein 's 1949 staging at the Berlin <unk> Oper , are among the first known instances in which the dialogue version was used other than in France . Neither of these innovations led to much change in practice ; a similar experiment was tried at Covent Garden in 1953 but hurriedly withdrawn , and the first American production with spoken dialogue , in Colorado in 1953 , met with a similar fate . 
 Dean has commented on the dramatic distortions that arise from the suppression of the dialogue ; the effect , he says , is that the action moves forward " in a series of jerks , rather instead of by smooth transition " , and that most of the minor characters are substantially diminished . Only late in the 20th century did dialogue versions become common in opera houses outside France , but there is still no universally recognised full score . Fritz Oeser 's 1964 edition is an attempt to fill this gap , but in Dean 's view is unsatisfactory . Oeser reintroduces material removed by Bizet during the first rehearsals , and ignores many of the late changes and improvements that the composer made immediately before the first performance ; he thus , according to Susan McClary , " inadvertently preserves as definitive an early draft of the opera " . In the early 21st century new editions were prepared by Robert Didion and Richard Langham @-@ Smith , published by Schott and Peters respectively . Each departs significantly from Bizet 's vocal score of March 1875 , published during his lifetime after he had personally corrected the proofs ; Dean believes that this vocal score should be the basis of any standard edition . Lesley Wright , a contemporary Bizet scholar , remarks that , unlike his compatriots Rameau and Debussy , Bizet has not been accorded a critical edition of his principal works ; should this transpire , she says , " we might expect yet another scholar to attempt to refine the details of this vibrant score which has so fascinated the public and performers for more than a century " . Meanwhile , Carmen 's popularity endures ; according to Macdonald : " The memorability of Bizet 's tunes will keep the music of Carmen alive in perpetuity " , and its status as a popular classic is unchallenged by any other French opera . 
 = = Music = = 
 Hervé Lacombe , in his survey of 19th @-@ century French opera , contends that Carmen is one of the few works from that large repertory to have stood the test of time . While he places the opera firmly within the long opéra comique tradition , Macdonald considers that it transcends the genre and that its immortality is assured by " the combination in abundance of striking melody , deft harmony and perfectly judged orchestration " . Dean sees Bizet 's principal achievement in the demonstration of the main actions of the opera in the music , rather than in the dialogue , writing that " Few artists have expressed so vividly the torments inflicted by sexual passions and jealousy " . Dean places Bizet 's realism in a different category from the verismo of Puccini and others ; he likens the composer to Mozart and Verdi in his ability to engage his audiences with the emotions and sufferings of his characters . 
 Bizet , who had never visited Spain , sought out appropriate ethnic material to provide an authentic Spanish flavour to his music . Carmen 's habanera is based on an idiomatic song , " El <unk> " , by the Spanish composer Sebastián <unk> ( 1809 – 65 ) . Bizet had taken this to be a genuine folk melody ; when he learned its recent origin he added a note to the vocal score , crediting <unk> . He used a genuine folksong as the source of Carmen 's defiant " Coupe @-@ moi , <unk> @-@ moi " while other parts of the score , notably the " Seguidilla " , utilise the rhythms and instrumentation associated with flamenco music . However , Dean insists that " [ t ] his is a French , not a Spanish opera " ; the " foreign bodies " , while they undoubtedly contribute to the unique atmosphere of the opera , form only a small ingredient of the complete music . 
 The prelude to act 1 combines three recurrent themes : the entry of the bullfighters from act 4 , the refrain from the Toreador Song from act 2 , and the motif that , in two slightly differing forms , represents both Carmen herself and the fate that she personifies . This motif , played on clarinet , bassoon , cornet and cellos over tremolo strings , concludes the prelude with an abrupt crescendo . When the curtain rises a light and sunny atmosphere is soon established , and pervades the opening scenes . The mock solemnities of the changing of the guard , and the flirtatious exchanges between the townsfolk and the factory girls , precede a mood change when a brief phrase from the fate motif announces Carmen 's entrance . After her provocative habanera , with its persistent insidious rhythm and changes of key , the fate motif sounds in full when Carmen throws her flower to José before departing . This action elicits from José a passionate A major solo that Dean suggests is the turning @-@ point in his musical characterisation . The softer vein returns briefly , as Micaëla reappears and joins with José in a duet to a warm clarinet and strings accompaniment . The tranquillity is shattered by the women 's noisy quarrel , Carmen 's dramatic re @-@ entry and her defiant interaction with Zuniga . After her beguiling " Seguidilla " provokes José to an exasperated high A sharp shout , Carmen 's escape is preceded by the brief but disconcerting reprise of a fragment from the habanera . Bizet revised this finale several times to increase its dramatic effect . 
 Act 2 begins with a short prelude , based on a melody that José will sing offstage before his next entry . A festive scene in the inn precedes Escamillo 's tumultuous entrance , in which brass and percussion provide prominent backing while the crowd sings along . The quintet that follows is described by Newman as " of incomparable verve and musical wit " . José 's appearance precipitates a long mutual wooing scene ; Carmen sings , dances and plays the castanets ; a distant cornet @-@ call summoning José to duty is blended with Carmen 's melody so as to be barely discernible . A muted reference to the fate motif on an English horn leads to José 's " Flower Song " , a flowing continuous melody that ends pianissimo on a sustained high B @-@ flat . José 's insistence that , despite Carmen 's blandishments , he must return to duty leads to a quarrel ; the arrival of Zuniga , the consequent fight and José 's unavoidable <unk> into the lawless life culminates musically in the triumphant hymn to freedom that closes the act . 
 The prelude to act 3 was originally intended for Bizet 's L 'Arlésienne score . Newman describes it as " an exquisite miniature , with much <unk> and intertwining between the woodwind instruments " . As the action unfolds , the tension between Carmen and José is evident in the music . In the card scene , the lively duet for Frasquita and Mercédès turns ominous when Carmen intervenes ; the fate motif underlines her premonition of death . Micaëla 's aria , after her entry in search of José , is a conventional piece , though of deep feeling , preceded and concluded by horn calls . The middle part of the act is occupied by Escamillo and José , now acknowledged as rivals for Carmen 's favour . The music reflects their contrasting attitudes : Escamillo remains , says Newman , " <unk> polite and ironic " , while José is sullen and aggressive . When Micaëla pleads with José to go with her to his mother , the harshness of Carmen 's music reveals her most unsympathetic side . As José departs , vowing to return , the fate theme is heard briefly in the woodwind . The confident , off @-@ stage sound of the departing Escamillo singing the toreador 's refrain provides a distinct contrast to José 's increasing desperation . 
 The final act is prefaced with a lively orchestral piece derived from Manuel García 's short operetta El Criado <unk> . After the opening crowd scene , the bullfighters ' march is led by the children 's chorus ; the crowd hails Escamillo before his short love scene with Carmen . The long finale , in which José makes his last pleas to Carmen and is decisively rejected , is punctuated at critical moments by enthusiastic off @-@ stage shouts from the bullfighting arena . As José kills Carmen , the chorus sing the refrain of the Toreador Song off @-@ stage ; the fate motif , which has been suggestively present at various points during the act , is heard fortissimo , together with a brief reference to Carmen 's card scene music . Jose 's last words of love and despair are followed by a final long chord , on which the curtain falls without further musical or vocal comment .

 = = Recordings and adaptations = = 
 Carmen has been the subject of many recordings , beginning with early wax cylinder recordings of excerpts in the 1890s , a nearly complete performance in German from 1908 with Emmy <unk> in the title role , and a complete 1911 Opéra @-@ Comique recording in French . Since then , many of the leading opera houses and artistes have recorded the work , in both studio and live performances . Over the years many versions have been commended and reissued . From the mid @-@ 1990s numerous video recordings have become available . These include David McVicar 's Glyndebourne production of 2002 , and the Royal Opera productions of 2007 and 2010 , each designed by Francesca Zambello . 
 In 1883 the Spanish violinist and composer Pablo de Sarasate ( 1844 – 1908 ) wrote a Carmen Fantasy for violin , described as " ingenious and technically difficult " . Ferruccio Busoni 's 1920 piece , Piano Sonatina No. 6 ( Fantasia da camera super Carmen ) , is based on themes from Carmen . In 1967 the Russian composer Rodion <unk> adapted parts of the Carmen music into a ballet , the Carmen Suite , written specifically for his wife Maya Plisetskaya , then the Bolshoi Ballet 's principal ballerina . 
 The character " Carmen " has been a regular subject of film treatment since the earliest days of cinema . The films range across many languages and cultures , and have been created by prominent directors including Raoul Walsh ( 1915 ) , Cecil B. DeMille ( 1915 ) , Otto Preminger ( 1954 ) and Jean @-@ Luc Godard ( 1984 ) . Preminger 's Carmen Jones was adapted from a 1943 Broadway musical of the same name . The story is transposed to 1940s Chicago , and employs an all @-@ black cast . Francesco Rosi 's film of 1984 , with Julia <unk> and Plácido Domingo , is generally faithful to the original story and to Bizet 's music . Carmen on Ice ( 1990 ) , starring Katarina Witt , Brian Boitano and Brian Orser , was inspired by Witt 's gold medal @-@ winning performance during the 1988 Winter Olympics . Robert Townsend 's 2001 film , Carmen : A Hip Hopera , starring Beyoncé Knowles , is a more recent attempt to create an African @-@ American version . 
 = HMS Dreadnought ( 1906 ) = 
 HMS Dreadnought was a battleship of the Royal Navy that revolutionised naval power . Her entry into service in 1906 represented such a paradigm shift in naval technology that her name came to be associated with an entire generation of battleships , the " dreadnoughts " , as well as the class of ships named after her . The generation of ships she made obsolete became known as " pre @-@ dreadnoughts " . She was the sixth ship of that name in the Royal Navy . 
 Admiral Sir John " Jacky " Fisher , First Sea Lord of the Board of Admiralty , is credited as the father of Dreadnought . Shortly after he assumed office , he ordered design studies for a battleship armed solely with 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns and a speed of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) . He convened a " Committee on Designs " to evaluate the alternative designs and to assist in the detailed design work . One ancillary benefit of the Committee was that it would shield him and the Admiralty from political charges that they had not consulted leading experts before designing such a radically different battleship . 
 Dreadnought was the first battleship of her era to have a uniform main battery , rather than having a few large guns complemented by a heavy secondary battery of smaller guns . She was also the first capital ship to be powered by steam turbines , making her the fastest battleship in the world at the time of her completion . Her launch helped spark a naval arms race as navies around the world , particularly the German Imperial Navy , rushed to match her in the build @-@ up to World War I. 
 In 1915 Dreadnought became the only battleship to sink a submarine when she rammed the SM U @-@ 29 when it unexpectedly broke the surface after firing a torpedo at another dreadnought . Dreadnought did not participate in the Battle of Jutland in 1916 as she was being refitted . This was the only time during the war that British dreadnought battleships fired on their German counterparts . Nor did Dreadnought participate in any of the other World War I naval battles . After the Battle of Jutland she was relegated to coastal defence duties in the English Channel , not rejoining the Grand Fleet until 1918 . She was reduced to reserve in 1919 and sold for scrap two years later .

 Gunnery developments in the late 1890s and the early 1900s , led in the United Kingdom by Percy Scott and in the United States by William Sims , were already pushing expected battle ranges out to an unprecedented 6 @,@ 000 yards ( 5 @,@ 500 m ) , a distance great enough to force gunners to wait for the shells to arrive before applying corrections for the next salvo . A related problem was that the shell splashes from the more numerous smaller weapons tended to obscure the splashes from the bigger guns . Either the smaller @-@ calibre guns would have to hold their fire to wait for the slower @-@ firing heavies , losing the advantage of their faster rate of fire , or it would be uncertain whether a splash was due to a heavy or a light gun , making ranging and aiming unreliable . Another problem was that longer @-@ range torpedoes were expected to soon be in service and these would discourage ships from closing to ranges where the smaller guns ' faster rate of fire would become preeminent . Keeping the range open generally negated the threat from torpedoes and further reinforced the need for heavy guns of a uniform calibre . 
 In 1903 , the Italian naval architect Vittorio Cuniberti first articulated in print the concept of an all @-@ big @-@ gun battleship . When the Italian Navy did not pursue his ideas , Cuniberti wrote an article in Jane 's Fighting Ships advocating his concept . He proposed an " ideal " future British battleship of 17 @,@ 000 long tons ( 17 @,@ 000 t ) , with a main battery of a dozen 12 @-@ inch guns in eight turrets , 12 inches of belt armour , and a speed of 24 knots ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) . 
 The Royal Navy ( RN ) , the Imperial Japanese Navy and the United States Navy all recognised these issues before 1905 . The RN modified the design of the Lord Nelson @-@ class battleships to include a secondary armament of 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch ( 234 mm ) guns that could fight at longer ranges than the 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns on older ships , but a proposal to arm them solely with 12 @-@ inch guns was rejected . The Japanese battleship Satsuma was laid down as an all @-@ big @-@ gun battleship , five months before Dreadnought , although gun shortages allowed her to be equipped with only four of the 12 @-@ inch guns that had been planned . The Americans began design work on an all @-@ big @-@ gun battleship around the same time in 1904 , but progress was leisurely and the two South Carolina @-@ class battleships were not ordered until March 1906 , five months after Dreadnought was laid down , and the month after it was launched . 
 The invention by Charles Algernon Parsons of the steam turbine in 1884 led to a significant increase in the speed of ships with his dramatic unauthorised demonstration of <unk> with her speed of up to 34 knots ( 63 km / h ; 39 mph ) at Queen Victoria 's Diamond Jubilee at Spithead in 1897 . After further trials of two turbine @-@ powered destroyers , HMS Viper and HMS Cobra , coupled with the positive experiences of several small passenger liners with turbines , Dreadnought was ordered with turbines . 
 The Battle of the Yellow Sea and Battle of Tsushima were analysed by Fisher 's Committee , with Captain William Pakenham 's statement that " 12 @-@ inch gunfire " by both sides demonstrated hitting power and accuracy , whilst 10 @-@ inch shells passed unnoticed . Admiral Fisher wanted his board to confirm , refine and implement his ideas of a warship that had both the speed of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ) and 12 @-@ inch guns , pointing out that at the Battle of Tsushima , Admiral Togo had been able to cross the Russians ' " T " due to speed . The unheard of long @-@ range ( 13 @,@ 000 metres ( 14 @,@ 000 yd ) ) fire during the Battle of the Yellow Sea , in particular , although never experienced by any navy prior to the battle , seemed to confirm what the RN already believed . 
 = = = Development of Dreadnought = = = 
 Admiral Fisher proposed several designs for battleships with a uniform armament in the early 1900s , and he gathered an unofficial group of advisors to assist him in deciding on the ideal characteristics in early 1904 . After he was appointed First Sea Lord on 21 October 1904 , he pushed through the Board of Admiralty a decision to arm the next battleship with 12 inch guns and that it would have a speed no less than 21 knots ( 39 km / h ) . In January 1905 , he convened a " Committee on Designs " , including many members of his informal group , to evaluate the various design proposals and to assist in the detailed design process . While nominally independent it served to deflect criticism of Fisher and the Board of Admiralty as it had no ability to consider options other than those already decided upon by the Admiralty . Fisher appointed all of the members of the committee and he was President of the Committee . 
 The committee decided on the layout of the main armament , rejecting any superfiring arrangements because of concerns about the effects of muzzle blast on the open sighting hoods on the turret roof below , and chose turbine propulsion over reciprocating engines to save 1 @,@ 100 long tons ( 1 @,@ 100 t ) in total displacement on 18 January 1905 . Before disbanding on 22 February , it decided on a number of other issues , including the number of shafts ( up to six were considered ) , the size of the anti @-@ torpedo boat armament , and most importantly , to add longitudinal bulkheads to protect the magazines and shell rooms from underwater explosions . This was deemed necessary after the Russian battleship Tsesarevich was thought to have survived a Japanese torpedo hit during the Russo – Japanese War by virtue of her heavy internal bulkhead . To avoid increasing the displacement of the ship , the thickness of her waterline belt was reduced by 1 inch ( 25 mm ) .

 Dreadnought was significantly larger than the two ships of the Lord Nelson class , which were under construction at the same time . She had an overall length of 527 feet ( 160 @.@ 6 m ) , a beam of 82 feet 1 inch ( 25 @.@ 0 m ) , and a draught of 29 feet 7 @.@ 5 inches ( 9 @.@ 0 m ) at deep load . She displaced 18 @,@ 120 long tons ( 18 @,@ 410 t ) at normal load and 20 @,@ 730 long tons ( 21 @,@ 060 t ) at deep load , almost 3 @,@ 000 long tons ( 3 @,@ 000 t ) more than the earlier ships . She had a metacentric height of 5 @.@ 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 7 m ) at deep load and a complete double bottom . 
 Officers were customarily housed aft , but Dreadnought reversed the old arrangement , so that the officers were closer to their action stations . This was very unpopular with the officers , not least because they were now berthed near the noisy auxiliary machinery while the turbines made the rear of the ship much quieter than they had been in earlier steamships . This arrangement lasted among the British dreadnoughts until the King George V class of 1910 . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Dreadnought was the first battleship to use steam turbines in place of the older reciprocating triple @-@ expansion steam engines . She had two paired sets of Parsons direct @-@ drive turbines , each of which was housed in a separate engine @-@ room and drove two shafts . The wing shafts were coupled to the high @-@ pressure ahead and astern turbines and the low @-@ pressure turbines to the inner shafts . A cruising turbine was also coupled to each inner shaft , although these were not used often and were eventually disconnected . Her three @-@ bladed propellers were 8 feet 10 inches ( 2 @.@ 69 m ) in diameter . The turbines were powered by eighteen Babcock & Wilcox water @-@ tube boilers in three boiler rooms . They had a working pressure of 250 psi ( 1 @,@ 724 kPa ; 18 kgf / cm2 ) . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 23 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 17 @,@ 000 kW ) , but reached nearly 27 @,@ 018 shp ( 20 @,@ 147 kW ) during trials in October 1906 . Dreadnought was designed for 21 knots ( 38 @.@ 9 km / h ; 24 @.@ 2 mph ) , but reached 21 @.@ 6 knots ( 40 @.@ 0 km / h ; 24 @.@ 9 mph ) during trials . 
 Dreadnought carried 2 @,@ 868 long tons ( 2 @,@ 914 t ) of coal , and an additional 1 @,@ 120 long tons ( 1 @,@ 140 t ) of fuel oil that was to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate . At full capacity , she could steam for 6 @,@ 620 nautical miles ( 12 @,@ 260 km ; 7 @,@ 620 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Dreadnought mounted the 45 @-@ calibre BL 12 @-@ inch Mark X gun in five twin gun turrets . Three turrets were located along the centreline of the ship , with the forward turret ( ' A ' ) and two aft turrets ( ' X ' and ' Y ' ) , the latter pair separated by the torpedo control tower located on a short tripod mast . Two wing turrets ( ' P ' and ' Q ' ) were located port and starboard of the forward superstructure respectively . Dreadnought could deliver a broadside of eight guns between 60 ° before the beam and 50 ° abaft the beam . Beyond these limits she could fire six guns aft , and four forward . On bearings 1 ° ahead or astern she could fire six guns , although she would have inflicted blast damage on the superstructure . 
 The guns could initially be depressed to − 3 ° and elevated to + 13 @.@ 5 ° , although the turrets were modified to allow 16 ° of elevation during World War I. They fired 850 @-@ pound ( 390 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 725 ft / s ( 831 m / s ) ; at 13 @.@ 5 ° , this provided a maximum range of 16 @,@ 450 m ( 17 @,@ 990 yd ) with armour @-@ piercing ( AP ) 2 crh shells . At 16 ° elevation , the range was extended to 20 @,@ 435 yd ( 18 @,@ 686 m ) using the more aerodynamic , but slightly heavier 4 crh AP shells . The rate of fire of these guns was one to two rounds per minute . The ships carried 80 rounds per gun . 
 The secondary armament consisted of twenty @-@ seven 50 @-@ calibre , 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) 12 @-@ pounder 18 cwt Mark I guns positioned in the superstructure and on turret tops . The guns had a maximum depression of − 10 ° and a maximum elevation of + 20 ° . They fired 12 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 7 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ( 790 m / s ) ; this gave a maximum range of 9 @,@ 300 yd ( 8 @,@ 500 m ) . Their rate of fire was 15 rounds per minute . The ship carried three hundred rounds for each gun . 
 The original plan was to dismount the eight guns on the forecastle and quarterdeck and stow them on <unk> on the deck during daylight to prevent them from being damaged by muzzle blast from the main guns . Gun trials in December 1906 proved that this was a bit more difficult than expected and the two port guns from the forecastle and the outer starboard gun from the quarterdeck were transferred to turrets roofs , giving each turret two guns . The remaining forecastle guns and the outer port gun from the quarterdeck were removed by the end of 1907 , which reduced the total to twenty @-@ four guns . During her April – May 1915 refit the two guns from the roof of ' A ' turret were reinstalled in the original positions on the starboard side of the quarterdeck . A year later , the two guns at the rear of the superstructure were removed , reducing her to twenty @-@ two guns . Two of the quarterdeck guns were given high @-@ angle Mark IV * C mounts for anti @-@ aircraft duties and the two guns abreast the conning tower were removed in 1917 . 
 A pair of QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss AA guns on high @-@ angle mountings were mounted on the quarterdeck in 1915 . They had a maximum depression of 8 ° and a maximum elevation of 60 ° . The guns fired a 6 @-@ pound ( 2 @.@ 7 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 765 ft / s ( 538 m / s ) at a rate of fire of 20 rounds per minute . They had a maximum ceiling of 10 @,@ 000 ft ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) , but an effective range of only 1 @,@ 200 yards ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) . They were replaced by a pair of QF 3 @-@ inch 20 cwt guns on high @-@ angle Mark II mounts in 1916 . These gun had a maximum depression of 10 ° and a maximum elevation of 90 ° . They fired a 12 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 7 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 500 ft / s ( 760 m / s ) at a rate of 12 – 14 rounds per minute . They had a maximum effective ceiling of 23 @,@ 500 ft ( 7 @,@ 200 m ) . 
 Dreadnought carried five 18 @-@ inch ( 450 mm ) submerged torpedo tubes in three compartments . Each compartment had two torpedo tubes , one on each broadside , except for the stern compartment which only had one torpedo tube . The forward torpedo room was forward of ' A ' turret 's magazine and the rear torpedo room was abaft ' Y ' turret 's magazine . The stern torpedo compartment was shared with the steering gear . Twenty @-@ three Whitehead Mark III * torpedoes were carried between them . In addition six 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) torpedoes were carried for her steam picket boats . 
 = = = Fire control = = = 
 Dreadnought was one of the first vessels of the Royal Navy to be fitted with instruments for electrically transmitting range , order and deflection information to the turrets . The control positions for the main armament were located in the spotting top at the head of the foremast and on a platform on the roof of the signal tower . Data from a 9 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) Barr and Stroud <unk> @-@ 2 rangefinder located at each control position was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to Vickers range clocks located in the Transmitting Station located beneath each position on the main deck , where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns . Voice pipes were retained for use between the Transmitting Station and the control positions . The target 's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target . The turrets , Transmitting Stations , and control positions could be connected in almost any combination . 
 Firing trials against HMS Hero in 1907 revealed this system 's vulnerability to gunfire , as its spotting top was hit twice and a large splinter severed the voice pipe and all wiring running along the mast . To guard against this possibility , Dreadnought 's fire @-@ control system was comprehensively upgraded during her refits in 1912 – 13 . The rangefinder in the foretop was given a gyro @-@ stabilized Argo mount and ' A ' and ' Y ' turrets were upgraded to serve as secondary control positions for any portion or all of the main armament . An additional 9 @-@ foot rangefinder was installed on the compass platform . In addition , ' A ' turret was fitted with another 9 @-@ foot rangefinder at the rear of the turret roof and a Mark I Dreyer Fire Control Table was installed in the main Transmitting Station . It combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock . 
 Fire @-@ control technology advanced quickly during the years immediately preceding World War I , and the most important development was the director firing system . This consisted of a fire @-@ control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided data to the turrets via pointers , which the turret crew were to follow . The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells . A prototype was fitted in Dreadnought in 1909 , but it was removed to avoid conflict with her duties as flagship of the Home Fleet . Preparations to install a production director were made during her May – June 1915 refit and every turret received a 9 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) rangefinder at the same time . The exact date of the installation of the director is not known , other than it was not fitted before the end of 1915 , and it was most likely mounted during her April – June 1916 refit . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 Dreadnought used Krupp cemented armour throughout , unless otherwise mentioned . Her waterline belt measured 11 inches ( 279 mm ) thick , but tapered to 7 inches ( 178 mm ) at its lower edge . It extended from the rear of ' A ' barbette to the centre of ' Y ' barbette . Oddly , it was reduced to 9 inches ( 229 mm ) abreast ' A ' barbette . A 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) extension ran from ' A ' barbette forward to the bow and a similar 4 inch extension ran aft to the stern . An 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) bulkhead was angled obliquely inwards from the end of the main belt to the side of ' X ' barbette to fully enclose the armoured citadel at middle deck level . An 8 inch belt sat above the main belt , but only ran as high as the main deck . One major problem with Dreadnought 's armour scheme was that the top of the 11 inch belt was only 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) above the waterline at normal load and it was submerged by over 12 inches at deep load , which meant that the waterline was then protected only by the 8 inch upper belt . 
 The turret faces and sides were protected by 11 inches of Krupp cemented armour , while the turret roofs used 3 inches of Krupp non @-@ cemented armour ( KNC ) . The exposed faces of the barbettes were 11 inches thick , but the inner faces were 8 inches thick above the main deck . ' X ' barbette 's was 8 inches thick all around . Below the main deck , the barbettes ' armour thinned to four inches except for ' A ' barbette ( eight inches ) and ' Y ' which remained 11 inches thick . The thickness of the main deck ranged from 0 @.@ 75 to 1 inch ( 19 to 25 mm ) . The middle deck was 1 @.@ 75 inches ( 44 mm ) thick on the flat and 2 @.@ 75 inches ( 70 mm ) where it sloped down to meet the bottom edge of the main belt . Over the magazine for ' A ' and ' Y ' turrets it was 3 inches thick , on slope and flat both . The lower deck armour was 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) forward and 2 inches aft where it increased to 3 inches to protect the steering gear . 
 The sides of the conning tower were 11 inches thick and it had a 3 inch roof of KNC . It had a communications tube with 8 inch walls of mild steel down to the Transmitting Station on the middle deck . The walls of the signal tower were 8 inches thick while it had a roof of 3 inches of KNC armour . 2 inch torpedo bulkheads were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms of ' A ' , ' X ' and ' Y ' turrets , but this increased to 4 inches abreast ' P ' and ' Q ' turrets to compensate for their outboard location . 
 In common with all major warships of her day , Dreadnought was fitted with anti @-@ torpedo nets , but these were removed early in the war , since they caused considerable loss of speed and were easily defeated by torpedoes fitted with net @-@ cutters . 
 = = Construction and trials = = 
 To meet Admiral Fisher 's goal of building Dreadnought in a single year , material was stockpiled in advance and a great deal of <unk> was done before she was formally laid down on 2 October 1905 . In addition , she was built at HM Dockyard , Portsmouth which was regarded as the fastest @-@ building shipyard in the world . Christened with a bottle of Australian wine , Dreadnought was launched by King Edward VII on 10 February 1906 , after only four months on the ways ; the bottle required multiple blows to shatter on a bow that later became famous . She went to sea on 3 October 1906 for her steam trials , only a year and a day after construction started , although she was not commissioned until 11 December 1906 , fifteen months after she was laid down . The ship cost £ 1 @,@ 783 @,@ 883 to build . The suggestion that her building had been sped up by using guns and / or turrets originally designed for the Lord Nelson @-@ class battleships which preceded her is not borne out as the guns and turrets were not ordered until July 1905 . It seems more likely that Dreadnought 's turrets and guns merely received higher priority than those of the earlier ships . 
 Dreadnought sailed for the Mediterranean Sea for extensive trials in December 1906 and then to Port of Spain , Trinidad in January 1907 . Her engines and guns were given a thorough workout by Captain Reginald Bacon , Fisher 's former Naval Assistant and a member of the Committee on Designs . His report stated , " No member of the Committee on Designs dared to hope that all the innovations introduced would have turned out as successfully as had been the case . " During this time she averaged 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) , slowed only by a damaged rudder , an unprecedented high @-@ speed performance . This shakedown cruise revealed several issues that were dealt with in subsequent refits , notably the replacement of her steering engines and the addition of cooling machinery to reduce the temperature levels in her magazines ( cordite degrades more quickly at high temperatures ) . The most important issue , which was never addressed in her lifetime , was that the placement of her foremast behind the forward funnel put the spotting top right in the plume of hot exhaust gases , much to the detriment of her fighting ability .

 From 1907 to 1911 , Dreadnought served as flagship of the Royal Navy 's Home Fleet . In 1910 , she attracted the attention of notorious hoaxer Horace de Vere Cole , who persuaded the Royal Navy to arrange for a party of Abyssinian royals to be given a tour of a ship . In reality , the " Abyssinian royals " were some of Cole 's friends in blackface and disguise , including a young Virginia Woolf and her Bloomsbury Group friends ; it became known as the Dreadnought hoax . Cole had picked Dreadnought because she was at that time the most prominent and visible symbol of Britain 's naval might . She was replaced as flagship of the Home Fleet by HMS Neptune in March 1911 and was assigned to the 1st Division of the Home Fleet . She participated in King George V 's Coronation Fleet Review in June 1911 . 
 Dreadnought became flagship of the 4th Battle Squadron in December 1912 after her transfer from the 1st Battle Squadron , as the 1st Division had been renamed earlier in the year . Between September and December 1913 she was training in the Mediterranean Sea . At the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , she was flagship of the 4th Battle Squadron in the North Sea , based at Scapa Flow . She was relieved as flagship on 10 December by HMS Benbow . 
 Ironically for a vessel designed to engage enemy battleships , her only significant action was the ramming and sinking of German submarine SM U @-@ 29 , skippered by K / Lt Otto Weddigen ( of SM U @-@ 9 fame ) , on 18 March 1915 . U @-@ 29 had broken the surface immediately ahead of Dreadnought after firing a torpedo at HMS Neptune and Dreadnought cut the submarine in two after a short chase . She almost collided with HMS Temeraire who was also attempting to ram . Dreadnought thus became the only battleship ever to sink a submarine . 
 She was refitting from 18 April to 22 June 1916 and missed the Battle of Jutland on 31 May , the most significant fleet engagement of the war . Dreadnought became flagship of the 3rd Battle Squadron on 9 July , based at Sheerness on the Thames , part of a force of pre @-@ dreadnoughts intended to counter the threat of shore bombardment by German battlecruisers . During this time she fired her AA guns at German aircraft that passed over her headed for London . She returned to the Grand Fleet in March 1918 , resuming her role as flagship of the Fourth Battle Squadron , but was paid off in July to begin another refit . Dreadnought was put into reserve at Rosyth in February 1919 . Dreadnought was put up for sale on 31 March 1920 and sold for scrap to T.W. Ward & Company on 9 May 1921 for the sum of £ 44 @,@ 000 . She was broken up at Ward 's new premises at Inverkeithing , Scotland , upon arrival on 2 January 1923 . 
 = = Significance = = 
 Her design so thoroughly eclipsed earlier types that subsequent battleships of all nations were generically known as " dreadnoughts " and older battleships disparaged as " pre @-@ dreadnoughts " . Her very short construction time was intended to demonstrate that Britain could build an unassailable lead in the new type of battleships . Her construction sparked off a naval arms race , and soon all major fleets were adding Dreadnought @-@ like ships . 
 The modern acoustic guitar developed with a wide , deep body was named the Dreadnought shape after this ship .

 Louis Jean " Jack " Le Goff ( April 8 , 1931 in Alençon , Orne , France – July 24 , 2009 in Saumur , Maine @-@ et @-@ Loire , France ) was a French equestrian , best known as the coach of the American three @-@ day eventing team from 1970 to 1984 . He coached the team to multiple international championships , winning 18 international medals , including several in the Olympics . Le Goff is known for having a large impact on the American eventing world , and the era in which he coached has been called the golden era for American equestrianism . 
 Prior to becoming an American coach , Le Goff served in the French Army and competed in three @-@ day eventing for France . He rode in the 1960 Summer Olympics , winning a team bronze medal , and the 1964 Summer Olympics , where he did not win a medal . He subsequently acted as the coach for the French national team , winning multiple regional and international medals . After retiring as the American coach , he acted as a consultant to the United States Equestrian Team ( USET ) for finding new riders , helped to coach the Canadian national team , and served as the director for the USET Training Center . He also served the Federation Equestre Internationale as an eventing judge , committee member and Olympic appeals judge . 
 = = Personal life and competitive career = = 
 Born in 1931 , Le Goff 's father was a French cavalry officer . Jack began riding early , and during his teenage years competed as a steeplechase jockey , as well as showing in dressage , showjumping , and eventing . At the age of seventeen , after the death of his father , Le Goff joined the French military and began riding for Cadre Noir , the national riding academy . After his training , he became a riding master at the school . He remained in this position for a decade . As a French soldier he fought in the Algerian War after his appearance in the 1960 Olympic Games . Le Goff competed in two Olympic Games , in 1960 and 1964 . In 1960 , at the Roma Games , he finished sixth individually and helped the French team to a bronze medal . At the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo , he finished twenty @-@ third individually , while the French team came in eighth . He was also the French national eventing champion in 1956 and 1964 . In the US he had a long @-@ time companion named Susan Smith , and at his death was survived by her , as well as five children , five grandchildren and three great @-@ grandchildren . 
 = = Coaching career = = 
 Following his return from Algeria and his competition in the 1964 Olympics , Le Goff became the coach for the French eventing team , remaining as such through the 1968 Summer Olympics . In this position he was the first civilian equestrian coach for the French national team , which had previously been under the control of the Army . During his tenure , French riders took gold medals at the 1968 Summer Olympics and the 1967 and 1968 European Junior Championships . 
 After that Games , he moved to the United States and became the eventing coach for the American equestrian team . He coached the team through eight international championships , including the 1970 through the 1984 Olympics . His teams earned 18 international medals in all . During his time as coach , Le Goff had complete control over the US eventing team , including the selection , training and pairing of horses and riders . He said that he was able to " identify the Team 's event horses , blindfolded , merely by running his hands down their legs . " Although this power has since been taken away from the US eventing coach and a more objective selection system put in its place , Le Goff 's abilities in this area took the US teams to numerous medals while he was coach . In his position as American coach , USET historian Jennifer Bryant called him " one of the greatest coaches in three @-@ day @-@ eventing history " , as he built a multiple @-@ medal @-@ winning team from previously unknown horses and riders . 
 After retiring as the American coach , he spent five years in Hamilton , Massachusetts as the Director of the United States Equestrian Team ( USET ) Training Center . He also continued to work part @-@ time in developing new riders for the American team , as well as taking a part @-@ time job coaching the Canadian team for the 1992 Summer Olympics . He also served as a member of the Three @-@ Day Event Committee for the Federation Equestre Internationale ( FEI ) , including serving as a three @-@ day eventing judge with the rank of " O " , meaning Official International . He was an eventing judge at the 1994 World Equestrian Games , the 1996 Summer Olympics , and multiple European Championships . At the 2000 Summer Olympics , he served as the chair of the FEI Three @-@ Day Event Committee and as the eventing representative to the Appeal Committee , assisting with supervising equestrian competition at the Games . After his retirement from coaching and judging , he moved between homes in Pennsylvania , Arizona , and France , until he died in France in 2009 .

 In 1983 , Le Goff was named Horseman of the Year by the American Horse Shows Association ( the predecessor to the United States Equestrian Federation ) . In 1999 , he was inducted into the United States Eventing Association 's Hall of Fame , followed by being named as one of the 50 most influential horsemen of the twentieth century by the equine magazine Chronicle of the Horse in 2002 . In 2009 , after his death , the USET announced the creation of the Jack Le Goff Memorial Fund , to provide travel grants to United States riders competing at the FEI Eventing World Cup Final . 
 Veteran US Olympic riders such as Michael Page and Mike Huber cite Le Goff as having a large impact on American eventing . Another US Olympic rider , Michael Plumb , says of Le Goff : " He was a disciplinarian , he was very strict , and he coached the team . I think we miss his approach . He could ride any of the horses brought to the Team , whether it was dressage or steeplechase or cross @-@ country . " The 1960s , 1970s , and early 1980s are known as the US 's " golden age of equestrian sports " , with Le Goff being named as a major player in the eventing arena . Denny Emerson , another top US eventing rider , called Le Goff a " tactician , consensus builder , consummate horseman , outrageous flirt , teller of terrible jokes , promoter , master chef , father , fisherman , and probably that most defining persona of all , the quintessential French male bon vivant .

 = Wintjiya Napaltjarri = 
 Wintjiya Napaltjarri ( born between ca . 1923 to 1934 ) ( also spelt <unk> , Wintjia or <unk> ) , and also known as Wintjia Napaltjarri No. 1 , is a Pintupi @-@ speaking Indigenous artist from Australia 's Western Desert region . She is the sister of artist Tjunkiya Napaltjarri ; both were wives of Toba Tjakamarra , with whom Wintjiya had five children . 
 Wintjiya 's involvement in contemporary Indigenous Australian art began in 1994 at Haasts Bluff , when she participated in a group painting project and in the creation of batik fabrics . She has also been a printmaker , using drypoint etching . Her paintings typically use an iconography that represents the eggs of the flying ant ( <unk> ) and hair @-@ string skirts ( <unk> ) . Her palette generally involves strong red or black against a white background . 
 A finalist in the 2007 and 2008 National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards , Wintjiya 's work is held in several of Australia 's public collections including the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory , the National Gallery of Australia and the National Gallery of Victoria . 
 = = Life = = 
 A 2004 reference work on Western Desert painters suggests Wintjiya was born in about 1923 ; the Art Gallery of New South Wales suggests 1932 ; expert Vivien Johnson reports two possible years : 1932 or 1934 . The ambiguity around the year of birth is in part because Indigenous Australians have a different conception of time , often estimating dates by comparisons with the occurrence of other events . 
 Napaljarri ( in Warlpiri ) or Napaltjarri ( in Western Desert dialects ) is a skin name , one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people . These names define kinship relationships that influence preferred marriage partners and may be associated with particular totems . Although often used as terms of address , they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans . Thus Wintjiya is the element of the artist 's name that is specifically hers . She is sometimes referred to as Wintjia Napaltjarri No. 1 ; there is another artist from the same region , Wintjiya Morgan Napaljarri ( also called Wintjiya Reid Napaltjarri ) , who is known as Wintjiya No. 2 . 
 Wintjiya came from an area north @-@ west or north @-@ east of <unk> ( the Pintupi @-@ language name for Kintore , Northern Territory ) . Johnson reports that Wintjiya was born at <unk> , " a swamp and spring to the northeast of Kintore " , west of Alice Springs . As was the case for a number of artists from the region , Wintjiya 's family walked in to the Haasts Bluff settlement in the 1950s , moving to Papunya in the 1960s . In 1981 , Kintore was established and the family moved there . Her native language is Pintupi , and she speaks almost no English . She is the sister of artist Tjunkiya Napaltjarri , the two women being the second and third wives of Toba Tjakamarra , father ( by his first wife , <unk> Napaltjarri ) of one of the prominent founders of the Papunya Tula art movement , Turkey Tolson Tjupurrula . Wintjiya and Toba had five children : sons Bundy ( born 1953 ) and Lindsay ( born 1961 and now deceased ) ; and daughters <unk> ( born 1955 ) , Claire ( born 1958 ) and Eileen ( born 1960 ) . Superficially frail by 2008 , she nevertheless had the stamina and agility to teach her granddaughter the skills of chasing and capturing goannas .

 Contemporary Indigenous art of the western desert began in 1971 when Indigenous men at Papunya created murals and canvases using western art materials , assisted by teacher Geoffrey Bardon . Their work , which used acrylic paints to create designs representing body painting and ground sculptures , rapidly spread across Indigenous communities of central Australia , particularly after the introduction of a government @-@ sanctioned art program in central Australia in 1983 . By the 1980s and ' 90s , such work was being exhibited internationally . The first artists , including all of the founders of the Papunya Tula artists ' company , were men , and there was resistance among the Pintupi men of central Australia to women also painting . However , many of the women wished to participate , and in the 1990s many of them began to paint . In the western desert communities such as Kintore , Yuendumu , Balgo , and on the outstations , people were beginning to create art works expressly for exhibition and sale . 
 = = = Career = = = 
 Since the 1970s Wintjiya had created artefacts such as <unk> seed necklaces , mats and baskets , using traditional artistic techniques including weaving of spinifex grass . When the women of Kintore , including sisters Wintjiya and Tjunkiya , started creating canvasses , their works bore little resemblance to those of their male peers ( who had been painting for some years ) . Wintjiya 's first efforts were collaborative , as one of a group of women who created murals on the Kintore Women 's Centre walls in 1992 . She then joined a painting camp with other women from Kintore and Haasts Bluff to produce " a series of very large collaborative canvases of the group 's shared Dreamings " ( dreamings are stories used to pass " important knowledge , cultural values and belief systems " from generation to generation ) . Twenty @-@ five women were involved in planning the works , which included three canvases that were 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) square , as well as two that were 3 by 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 by 4 @.@ 9 ft ) ; Tjunkiya and Wintjiya performed a ceremonial dance as part of the preparations . Wintjiya and her sister were determined to participate in the project despite cataracts interfering with their vision . As was the case for Makinti Napanangka , an operation to remove cataracts resulted in a new brightness to Wintjiya 's compositions . Sources differ on when Wintjiya and her sister Tjunkiya had their cataracts removed : Johnson suggests 1999 , but art centre coordinator Marina Strocchi , who worked closely with the women , states that it was 1994 . In the early 2000s Wintjiya and her sister painted at Kintore , but in 2008 they were working from their home : " the widows ' camp outside her ' son ' Turkey Tolson 's former residence " . 
 Tjunkiya and her sister Wintjiya did not confine their activities to painting canvases . In 2001 the National Gallery of Victoria purchased a collaborative batik , created by the sisters in cooperation with several other artists , together with one completed by Wintjiya alone . These works were the product of a batik workshop run for the women of Haasts Bluff by Northern Territory Education Department staff Jill Squires and Therese Honan in the months following June 1994 . The works , including several by Wintjiya , were not completed until 1995 . Circular markings , used by Wintjiya in both these batiks and her subsequent paintings , represent the eggs of the flying ant ( <unk> ) , one of the main subjects of her art . She also portrays " tree @-@ like organic motifs " and representations of hair @-@ string skirts ( <unk> ) . The sisters also gained experience with drypoint etching ; works produced by Wintjiya in 2004 – <unk> and <unk> – are held by the National Gallery of Australia . 
 Wintjiya 's work was included in a survey of the history of Papunya Tula painting hosted by Flinders University in the late 1990s . Reviewing the exhibition , Christine Nicholls remarked of Wintjiya 's <unk> that it was a germinal painting , with fine use of muted colour , and showed sensitivity to the relationships between objects and spaces represented in the work . Likewise , Marina Strocchi has noted the contrast between some of the subtle colours used in batik and Wintjiya 's characteristic painting palette , which is " almost exclusively stark white with black or red " . Hetti Perkins and Margie West have suggested that in paintings by Kintore women artists such as Wintjiya and Tjunkiya , " the viscosity of the painting 's surface seems to mimic the generous application of body paint in women 's ceremonies " . 
 Wintjiya 's painting Rock holes west of Kintore was a finalist in the 2007 National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award . Another of her works , Country west of Kintore , was accepted as a finalist in 2008 . Works by Wintjiya have appeared in many significant exhibitions including : Papunya Women group exhibition ( Utopia Art Gallery , Sydney , 1996 ) ; <unk> Wara : Long Cloth from Aboriginal Australia and the Torres Strait ( National Gallery of Victoria 1998 – 99 ) ; Twenty @-@ five Years and Beyond : Papunya Tula Painting ( Flinders University Art Museum , 1999 ) ; Papunya Tula : Genesis and Genius ( Art Gallery of New South Wales , 2000 ) and Land Marks ( National Gallery of Victoria , 2006 ) . Her first solo exhibition was at <unk> Art Gallery in Brisbane in 2005 , while in 2010 there was one at a Melbourne gallery . Also in 2010 , a print by Wintjiya was selected for inclusion in the annual Fremantle Arts Centre 's Print Award . In 2013 , she was one of sixteen finalists in the Western Australian Indigenous Art Awards . 
 Works by Wintjiya are held in major private collections such as Nangara ( also known as the Ebes Collection ) . Her work has been acquired by several major public art institutions including the Art Gallery of New South Wales , the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory , and the National Gallery of Victoria . Internationally , her work is held in the Aboriginal Art Museum at Utrecht in the Netherlands , and the Kluge @-@ Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection at the University of Virginia . Works by Wintjiya and her sister Tjunkiya are traded in the auction market , fetching prices of a few thousand dollars .

 = Christian views on alcohol = 
 Christian views on wine and alcohol are varied . Christians used " the fruit of the vine " in their central rite — the Eucharist or Lord 's Supper . Some Christian laymen ( e.g. Monica Of Hippo ) kept a strict rule of total abstinence , and the contrasting types of wine were distinguished : " not that wine which produces drunkenness , plots against the senses , and destroys the body , but such as gladdens the heart . " ( See Early Church section . ) Some consumed alcoholic beverages as a common part of everyday life . The latter held that alcohol is a gift from God that makes life more joyous , but that over @-@ indulgence leading to drunkenness is sinful or at least a vice . The Bible indicates wine as a symbol of joy while " strong drink " is a euphemism for drunkenness . 
 In the mid @-@ 19th century , some Protestant Christians moved from a position of allowing moderate use of alcohol ( sometimes called moderationism ) to either deciding that not imbibing was wisest in the present circumstances ( abstentionism ) or prohibiting all ordinary consumption of alcohol because it was believed to be a sin ( prohibitionism ) . Methodists advocated abstentionism and were early leaders in the temperance movement of the 19th and 20th centuries , which had followers from many Protestant churches . Today , all three of these positions exist in Christianity , but the historic position remains the most common worldwide , due to the adherence by the largest bodies of Christians , namely Anglicanism , Roman Catholicism , and Orthodoxy . 
 = = Alcohol in the Bible = = 
 Alcoholic beverages appear in the Bible , both in usage and in poetic expression . The Bible is ambivalent toward alcohol , considering it both a blessing from God that brings merriment and a potential danger that can be unwisely and <unk> abused . Christian views on alcohol come from what the Bible says about it , along with Jewish and Christian traditions . The biblical languages have several words for alcoholic beverages , and though prohibitionists and some abstentionists dissent , there is a broad consensus that the words did ordinarily refer to intoxicating drinks . 
 The <unk> and centrality of wine in daily life in biblical times is apparent from its many positive and negative metaphorical uses throughout the Bible . Positively , for example , wine is used as a symbol of abundance , and of physical blessing . <unk> , wine is personified as a mocker and beer a brawler , and drinking a cup of strong wine to the dregs and getting drunk are sometimes presented as a symbol of God 's judgment and wrath . 
 The Bible also speaks of wine in general terms as a bringer and concomitant of joy , particularly in the context of nourishment and feasting . Wine was commonly drunk at meals , and the Old Testament prescribed it for use in sacrificial rituals and festal celebrations . The Gospel of John recorded the first miracle of Jesus : making copious amounts of wine at the wedding feast at Cana . Jesus instituted the ritual of the Eucharist at the Last Supper during a Passover celebration , he says that the " fruit of the vine " is a " New Covenant in [ his ] blood , " though Christians have differed on the implications of this statement ( see Eucharistic theologies contrasted ) . Alcohol was also used for medicinal purposes in biblical times , and it appears in that context in several passages — as an oral anesthetic , a topical cleanser and <unk> , and a digestive aid . 
 Kings and priests in the Old Testament were forbidden to partake of wine at various times . John the Baptist was a <unk> from birth . <unk> vows excluded not only wine , but also vinegar , grapes , and raisins . ( Jesus evidently did not take such a vow during the three years of ministry depicted in the gospels , but in fact was even accused by the Pharisees of eating and drinking with sinners . St. Paul further instructs Christians regarding their duty toward immature Christians : " It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall . " 
 " Even today , [ Jewish ] priests may not bless the congregation after having even a single glass of wine . " 
 Virtually all Christian traditions hold that the Bible condemns ordinary drunkenness in many passages , and Easton 's Bible Dictionary says , " The sin of drunkenness ... must have been not uncommon in the olden times , for it is mentioned either metaphorically or literally more than seventy times in the Bible . " Additionally , the consequences of the drunkenness of Noah and Lot " were intended to serve as examples of the dangers and repulsiveness of intemperance . " St. Paul later chides the Corinthians for becoming drunk on wine served at their attempted celebrations of the Eucharist . 
 = = Winemaking in biblical times = = 
 Both the climate and land of Palestine , where most of the Bible takes place , were well @-@ suited to growing grapes , and the wine that the vineyards produced was a valued commodity in ancient times , both for local consumption and for its value in trade . Trade with Egypt was quite extensive . Jews were a wine @-@ drinking culture well before the foundation of Rome . Vintage wines were found in the tomb of King Scorpion in Hierakonpolis . Archaeological evidence suggests that Semitic predecessors were thought to be responsible for the vintages that were found in the tomb . Vineyards were protected from robbers and animals by walls , hedges , and manned watchtowers . 
 The harvest time brought much joy and play , as " [ m ] en , women and children took to the vineyard , often accompanied by the sound of music and song , from late August to September to bring in the grapes . " Some grapes were eaten immediately , while others were turned into raisins . Most of them , however , were put into the wine press where the men and boys trampled them , often to music . 
 The fermentation process started within six to twelve hours after pressing , and the must was usually left in the collection vat for a few days to allow the initial , " tumultuous " stage of fermentation to pass . The wine makers soon transferred it either into large earthenware jars , which were then sealed , or , if the wine were to be transported elsewhere , into <unk> ( that is , partially tanned goat @-@ skins , sewn up where the legs and tail had protruded but leaving the opening at the neck ) . After six weeks , fermentation was complete , and the wine was filtered into larger containers and either sold for consumption or stored in a cellar or cistern , lasting for three to four years . Even after a year of aging , the vintage was still called " new wine , " and more aged wines were preferred . 
 Spices and scents were often added to wine in order to hide " defects " that arose from storage that was often not sufficient to prevent all spoiling . One might expect about 10 % of any given cellar of wine to have been ruined completely , but vinegar was also created intentionally for dipping bread among other uses . 
 The Feast of Booths was a prescribed holiday that immediately followed the harvest and pressing of the grapes . 
 = = Alcohol in Christian history and tradition = = 
 It is disputed whether the regular use of wine in the celebration of the Eucharist and in daily life were the virtually universal and undisputed practice in Christianity for over 1 @,@ 800 years . During the 19th and early 20th century , as a general sense of prohibitionism arose , many Christians , particularly some Protestants in the United States , came to believe that the Bible prohibited alcohol or that the wisest choice in modern circumstances was for the Christian to abstain from alcohol willingly . 
 = = = Before Christ = = = 
 The Hebraic opinion of wine in the time before Christ was decidedly positive : wine is part of the world God created and is thus " necessarily inherently good , " though excessive use is soundly condemned . The Jews emphasized joy in the goodness of creation rather than the virtue of temperance , which the Greek philosophers advocated . 
 As the Jews returned from the Babylonian exile ( starting in 537 BC ) and the events of the Old Testament drew to a close , wine was " a common beverage for all classes and ages , including the very young ; an important source of nourishment ; a prominent part in the festivities of the people ; a widely appreciated medicine ; an essential provision for any fortress ; and an important commodity , " and it served as " a necessary element in the life of the Hebrews . " Wine was also used ritualistically to close the Sabbath and to celebrate weddings , circumcisions , and Passover . 
 Although some abstentionists argue that wine in the Bible was almost always cut with water greatly decreasing its potency for inebriation , there is general agreement that , while Old Testament wine was sometimes mixed with various spices to enhance its flavor and stimulating properties , it was not usually diluted with water , and wine mixed with water is used as an Old Testament metaphor for corruption . Among the Greeks , however , the cutting of wine with water was a common practice used to reduce potency and improve taste . By the time of the writing of 2 Maccabees ( 2nd or 1st century BC ) , the Greeks had conquered Palestine under Alexander the Great , and the Hellenistic custom had apparently found acceptance with the Jews and was carried into Jewish rituals in New Testament times . 
 Under the rule of Rome , which had conquered Palestine under Pompey ( see Iudaea Province ) , the average adult male who was a citizen drank an estimated liter ( about a quarter of a gallon , or a modern @-@ day bottle and a third - about 35 oz . ) of wine per day , though beer was more common in some parts of the world . 
 = = = Early Church = = = 
 The Apostolic Fathers make very little reference to wine . Clement of Rome ( died 100 ) said : " Seeing , therefore , that we are the portion of the Holy One , let us do all those things which pertain to holiness , avoiding all evil @-@ speaking , all abominable and impure embraces , together with all drunkenness , seeking after change , all abominable lusts , detestable adultery , and execrable pride . " The earliest references from the Church Fathers make it clear that the early church used in the Eucharist wine - which was customarily mixed with water . The Didache , an early Christian treatise which is generally accepted to be from the late 1st century , instructs Christians to give a portion of their wine in support of a true prophet or , if they have no prophet resident with them , to the poor . 
 Clement of Alexandria ( died c . 215 ) wrote in a chapter about drinking that he admires those who adopt an austere life and " flee as far as possible from wine , shunning it as they would the danger of fire " , and he suggests the young abstain from wine so as not to inflame their " wild impulses . " He says Christ did not teach affected by it . " ... the soul itself is wisest and best when dry . " But he says taking a little wine as medicine or for pleasure after the day 's work is acceptable for those who are " moored by reason and time " such that they aren 't tempted by drunkenness , and nevertheless he encourages mixing " as much water as possible " in with the wine to inhibit inebriation . He also says wine is an appropriate symbol of Jesus ' blood . 
 Tertullian ( died 220 ) forbade ministers drinking in church , citing the Scriptural precedent : “ the Lord said to Aaron : ‘ Wine and spirituous liquor shall ye not drink , thou and thy son after thee , whenever ye shall enter the tabernacle , or ascend unto the sacrificial altar ; and ye shall not die . ’ [ Lev . 10 : 9 ] So true is it , that such as shall have ministered in the Church , being not sober , shall ‘ die . ’ Thus , too , in recent times He <unk> Israel : ‘ And ye used to give my sanctified ones wine to drink . ’ [ Amos 2 : 12 ] ” 
 Origen ( died 253 ) “ abstained from the use of wine , and of all other things beyond his necessary food . ” 
 Cyprian ( died 258 ) rejected undiluted wine in the Eucharist . He explained the meaning : water , being the people of Christ , was mingled with the blood of Christ . Also , it would be better to prevent them who drank it from getting drunk . ( But Cyprian suspected some of the people who used water on its own in the Eucharist did so from a disbelief in the expressed blood of Christ . ) 
 Methodius ( died 312 ) said : " For we perceive from the Scriptures two kinds of vines which were separate from each other , and were unlike ... 
 The sober and joy @-@ producing vine ... 
 the poison of dragons ... it is ordered that a virgin shall not taste of this vine , so that she may be sober and watchful ... 
 " Moreover , it is not only forbidden to virgins in any way to touch those things which are made from that vine , but even such things as resemble them and are akin to them ... all that produces drunkenness and distraction of mind , besides wine . " Jerome ( died 420 ) said similar things against drinking . 
 Church rules against drinking entertainments are found in The Synod of Laodicea ( 363 ) : 
 Rule XXIV : " No one of the priesthood , from presbyters to deacons , and so on in the ecclesiastical order to <unk> , readers , singers , exorcists , door @-@ keepers , or any of the class of the Ascetics , ought to enter a tavern . " 
 Rule LV : " <unk> members of the priesthood nor of the clergy , nor yet laymen , may club together for drinking entertainments . " 
 Equivalent non @-@ drinking rules are also found in the oldest of the " Apostolic Canons " and in the African churches . ( See Monica 's bishop . ) Again , the <unk> Council in <unk> ( 692 AD ) restated the rule : " Let no cleric be permitted to keep a ' public house . ' For if it be not permitted to enter a tavern , much more is it forbidden to serve others in it and to carry on a trade which is unlawful for him . But if he shall have done any such thing , either let him desist or be deposed . " 
 Basil the Great ( died 379 ) repudiated the views of some dualistic heretics who abhorred marriage , rejected wine , and called God 's creation " polluted " and who substituted water for wine in the Eucharist . 
 Monica of Hippo ( died 387 ) eagerly kept the strict rule of total abstinence , which her bishop required . She had never let herself drink much at all , not even " more than one little cup of wine , diluted according to her own temperate palate , which , out of courtesy , she would taste . " But now she willingly drank none at all . Augustine cited a reason for her bishop 's rule : " even to those who would use it with moderation , lest thereby an occasion of excess might be given to such as were drunken . " 
 John of <unk> ( died 395 ) said : " ... if there is any sharp wine I excommunicate it , but I drink the good . " Gregory of Nyssa ( died 395 ) made the same distinction between types of wine ( intoxicating and non @-@ intoxicating ) . " not that wine which produces drunkenness , plots against the senses , and destroys the body , but such as gladdens the heart , the wine which the Prophet recommends " 
 John Chrysostom ( died 407 ) said : " they who do not drink take no thought of the drunken . " A homily on 1 Timothy 5 : 23 stresses moderation and adds that the biblical passage in question is useful for refuting heretics and immature Christians who say there should be no wine . He emphasizes the goodness of God 's creation and <unk> : " Let there be no drunkenness ; for wine is the work of God , but drunkenness is the work of the devil . Wine makes not drunkenness ; but intemperance produces it . Do not accuse that which is the workmanship of God , but accuse the madness of a fellow mortal . " 
 The virtue of temperance passed from Greek philosophy into Christian ethics and became one of the four cardinal virtues under St. Ambrose and St. Augustine . Drunkenness , on the other hand , is considered a manifestation of gluttony , one of the seven deadly sins as compiled by Gregory the Great in the 6th century . 
 = = = Middle Ages = = = 
 The decline of the Roman Empire brought with it a significant drop in the production and consumption of wine in western and central Europe , but the Eastern and Western Church ( particularly the Byzantines ) preserved the practices of viticulture and winemaking . 
 The medieval monks , renowned as the finest creators of beer and wine , were allotted about five liters of beer per day , and were allowed to drink beer ( but not wine ) during fasts . This was justified by the church . Bread and water that made up ale 's ingredients was considered to not be a sin like that of wine . Brewing in monasteries increased and a number of modern breweries can trace their origins back to medieval monasteries . Benedict of Nursia ( died c . 547 ) , who formulated the monastic rules governing the Benedictines , seems to prefer that monks should do without wine as a daily staple , but he indicates that the monks of his day found the old regulation too burdensome . Thus he offers the concession of a quarter liter ( or perhaps , a half liter ) of wine per day as sufficient for nourishment , with allowance for more in special circumstances and for none as a punishment for repeated tardiness . Even so , he believes that abstinence is the best path for those who have a gift from God allowing them to restrain their bodily appetites . 
 Thomas Aquinas ( died 1274 ) , a Dominican friar and the " Doctor <unk> " of the Catholic Church , says that moderation in wine is sufficient for salvation but that for certain persons perfection requires abstinence , and this was dependent upon their circumstance . With regard to the Eucharist , he says that grape wine should be used and that " must " , unlike juice from unripe grapes , qualifies as wine because its sweetness will naturally turn it into wine . So freshly pressed must is indeed usable ( preferably after filtering any impurities ) . 
 Drinking among monks was not universal , however , and in 1319 Bernardo <unk> founded the <unk> Order , initially following a much more ascetic Rule than Benedict 's . The <unk> uprooted all their vineyards , destroyed their wine @-@ presses , and were " fanatical total abstainers , " but the rule was soon relaxed . 
 Because the Catholic Church requires properly fermented wine in the Eucharist — with a modern exception for alcoholic or allergic priests — wherever Catholicism spread , the missionaries also brought grapevines so they could make wine and celebrate the Mass . The Catholic Church continues to celebrate a number of early and medieval saints related to alcohol — for instance , St. Adrian , patron saint of beer ; St. Amand , patron saint of brewers , <unk> , and wine merchants ; St. Martin , the so @-@ called patron saint of wine ; St. Vincent , patron saint of vintners . 
 Wine has a place in the divine services of the Orthodox Church , not only in the celebration of the Divine Liturgy ( Eucharist ) , but also at the <unk> ( blessing of bread , wine , wheat and oil during the All Night Vigil ) and in the " common cup " of wine which is shared by the bride and groom during an Orthodox wedding service . A small amount of warm wine ( <unk> ) is taken by the faithful together with a piece of <unk> after receiving Holy Communion . In the Serbian Orthodox Church wine is used in the celebration of a service known as the Slava on feast days . The fasting rules of the Orthodox Church forbid the consumption of wine ( and by extension , all alcoholic beverages ) on most fast days throughout the year . The Orthodox celebrate St. Tryphon as the patron saint of vines and vineyard workers . 
 = = = Reformation = = = 
 As the Protestant Reformation began , the Reformers from Luther and Calvin to Zwingli and Knox strongly supported the enjoyment of wine as a biblical blessing , and Calvin 's annual salary in Geneva included seven barrels of wine . With Calvin at Geneva , " Low taverns and drinking shops were abolished , and intemperance diminished . " The Lutheran Formula of Concord ( 1576 ) and the Reformed Christian confessions of faith also make explicit mention of and assume the use of wine , as does the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith and the Methodist Articles of Religion ( 1784 ) . In the Dordrecht Confession of Faith ( 1632 ) , even the radical Anabaptists , who sought to expunge every trace of Roman Catholicism and to rely only on the Bible , also assumed wine was to be used , and despite their reputation as <unk> , the English Puritans were temperate partakers of " God 's good gifts , " including wine and ale . 
 = = = Colonial America = = = 
 As the Pilgrim Fathers set out for America , they brought a considerable amount of alcohol with them for the voyage ( more than 28 @,@ 617 liters = 7 @,@ 560 gallons , or 4 litres / person / day ) , and once settled , they served alcohol at " virtually all functions , including ordinations , funerals , and regular Sabbath meals . " M. E. Lender summarizes the " colonists had assimilated alcohol use , based on Old World patterns , into their community lifestyles " and that " [ l ] <unk> brewing began almost as soon as the colonists were safely ashore . " Increase Mather , a prominent colonial clergyman and president of Harvard , expressed the common view in a sermon against drunkenness : " Drink is in itself a good creature of God , and to be received with thankfulness , but the abuse of drink is from Satan ; the wine is from God , but the drunkard is from the Devil . " This Old World attitude is likewise found among the early Methodists ( Charles Wesley , George Whitefield , Adam Clarke , Thomas Coke ) and Baptists ( John Gill and John Bunyan ) . 
 = = = Methodism = = = 
 Methodist founder John Wesley warned : " You see the wine when it sparkles in the cup , and are going to drink of it . I tell you there is poison in it ! and , therefore , beg you to throw it away . " 
 Wesley likewise deplored distilled beverages such as brandy and whisky when they were used non @-@ medicinally , and he said the many distillers who sold indiscriminately to anyone were nothing more than poisoners and murderers accursed by God . In 1744 , the directions the Wesleys gave to the Methodist band societies ( small groups of Methodists intended to support living a Christian life ) required them " to taste no spirituous [ i.e. , distilled ] liquor ... unless prescribed by a physician . " At the 1780 Methodist Conference in Baltimore , the churchmen opposed distilled liquors and determined to " disown those who would not renounce the practice " of producing it . In opposing liquors , the American Methodists anticipated the first wave of the temperance movement that would follow . They expanded their membership rule regarding alcohol to include other alcoholic beverages over the next century . Despite pressure from interested parties to relax rules of all kinds , the American Methodists afterwards reverted to Wesley 's — namely , to avoid " [ d ] <unk> , buying or selling spirituous [ i.e. , distilled ] liquors , or drinking them , unless in cases of extreme necessity " . 
 Adam Clarke indicated the fruit of the vine at the Last Supper was pure and incomparable to what some think of as wine today . Wesley 's Articles of Religion , adopted by the Methodist Episcopal Church ( a precursor of the United Methodist Church ) in 1784 , assume in Articles XVIII that wine is to be used in the Lord 's supper and in Article XIX that it should given to all the people , not ministers only as in the Catholic practice of the time . Bishops in America Thomas Coke and Francis Asbury comment on the latter article saying , " St. Paul does not complain of [ the lay Corinthians ' ] drinking the wine at the Lord 's supper ... but of their both eating and drinking most <unk> " ( emphasis in original ) . Asbury strongly urged citizens to lay aside the use of alcohol . Likewise , the listed duties for Methodist preachers indicate that they should choose water as their common drink and use wine only in medicinal or sacramental contexts , with Coke and Asbury commenting that frequent fasting and abstinence are " highly necessary for the divine life . " 
 Later , British Methodists , in particular the Primitive Methodists , took a leading role in the temperance movement of the 19th and early 20th centuries . Methodists saw alcoholic beverages , and alcoholism , as the root of many social ills and tried to persuade people to abstain from these . Temperance appealed strongly to the Methodist doctrines of sanctification and perfection . 
 = = = Temperance movement = = = 
 In the midst of the social upheaval accompanying the American Revolution and urbanization induced by the Industrial Revolution , drunkenness was on the rise and was blamed as a major contributor to the increasing poverty , unemployment , and crime . Yet the temperate sentiments of the Methodists were shared only by a few others , until the publication of a tract by eminent physician and patriot Benjamin Rush , who argued against the use of " ardent spirits " ( i.e. , distilled alcohol ) , introduced the notion of addiction , and prescribed abstinence as the only cure . Some prominent preachers like Lyman Beecher picked up on Rush 's theme and galvanized the temperance movement to action . Though losing influence during the American Civil War , afterward the movement experienced its second wave , spearheaded by the Women 's Christian Temperance Union , and it was so successful in achieving its goals that Catherine Booth , co @-@ founder of the Salvation Army , could observe in 1879 that in America " almost every [ Protestant ] Christian minister has become an abstainer . " The movement saw the passage of anti @-@ drinking laws in several states and peaked in its political power in 1919 with the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution , which established prohibition as the law of the entire country but which was repealed in 1933 by the Twenty @-@ first Amendment . 
 Initially the vast majority of the temperance movement had opposed only distilled alcohol , which they saw as making drunkenness inexpensive and easy , and espoused moderation and temperance in the use of other alcoholic beverages . Fueled in part by the Second Great Awakening , which emphasized personal holiness and sometimes perfectionism , the temperance message changed to the outright elimination of alcohol . 
 Consequently , alcohol itself became an evil in the eyes of many ( but not all ) abstainers and so had to be expunged from Christian practice — especially from the holy rite of the Lord 's Supper . The use of a grape @-@ based drink other than wine for the Lord 's Supper took a strong hold in many churches , including American Protestantism , though some churches had detractors who thought wine was to be given strong preference in the rite . Some denominational statements required " unfermented wine " for the Lord 's Supper . For example , the Wesleyan Methodists ( since founded 1843 , some fifty years after Wesley 's death ) required " unfermented wine " . 
 Since grape juice begins naturally fermenting upon pressing , opponents of wine utilized alternate methods of creating their ritual drink such as reconstituting concentrated grape juice , boiling raisins , or adding preservatives to delay fermenting and souring . In 1869 , Thomas Bramwell Welch , an ordained Wesleyan Methodist minister , discovered a way to <unk> grape juice , and he used his particular preservation method to prepare juice for the Lord 's Supper at a Methodist Episcopal church . 
 From 1838 to 1845 , Father Mathew , the Irish apostle of temperance , administered an abstinence pledge to some three to four million of his countrymen , though his efforts had little permanent effect there , and then starting in 1849 to more than 500 @,@ 000 Americans , chiefly his fellow Irish Catholics , who formed local temperance societies but whose influence was limited . In 1872 the Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America united these societies and by 1913 reached some 90 @,@ 000 members including the juvenile , women 's , and priestly contingents . The Union pursued a platform of " moral suasion " rather than legislative prohibition and received two papal commendations . In 1878 Pope Leo XIII praised the Union 's determination to abolish drunkenness and " all incentive to it , " and in 1906 Pope Pius X lauded its efforts in " persuading men to practise one of the principal Christian virtues — temperance . " By the time the 18th Amendment was up for consideration , however , Archbishop Messmer of Milwaukee denounced the prohibition movement as being founded on an " absolutely false principle " and as trying to undermine the Church 's " most sacred mystery , " the Eucharist , and he forbade pastors in his archdiocese from assisting the movement but suggested they preach on moderation . In the end , Catholicism was largely unaffected in doctrine and practice by the movements to eliminate alcohol from church life , and it retained its emphasis on the virtue of temperance in all things . 
 Similarly , while the Lutheran and Anglican churches felt some pressure , they did not alter their moderationist position . Even the English denominational temperance societies refused to make abstention a requirement for membership , and their position remained moderationist in character . It was non @-@ Lutheran Protestantism from which the Temperance movement drew its greatest strength . Many Methodists , Baptists , Presbyterians , and other Protestants signed on to the prohibitionist platform . 
 " Despite the Scottish heritage of whisky drinking , Presbyterians were strong supporters of temperance and prohibition . They believed ( with some justification ) that ‘ the demon drink ’ was destructive of family life . The church was a stronghold of the temperance organisation the Band of Hope ... which encouraged youth ... to sign a pledge to abstain from alcohol . <unk> also succeeded in persuading the church to use grape juice rather than fortified wine in the sacrament of communion . " 
 The 1881 assembly of the United Presbyterian Church of North America said " the common traffic in , and the moderate use of intoxicants as a beverage are the source of all these evils . " In 1843 , the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America 's general assembly ( generally considered part of the conservative Old School ) considered and narrowly rejected making the selling of alcoholic beverages grounds for excommunication from the church . 
 The legislative and social effects resulting from the temperance movement peaked in the early 20th century and began to decline afterward . The effects on church practice were primarily a phenomenon in American Protestantism and to a lesser extent in the British Isles , the Nordic countries , and a few other places . The practice of the Protestant churches were slower to revert , and some bodies , though now rejecting their formerly prohibitionist platform , still retain vestiges of it such as using grape juice alone or beside wine in the Lord 's supper . 
 = = Current views = = 
 Today , the views on alcohol in Christianity can be divided into moderationism , abstentionism , and prohibitionism . Abstentionists and prohibitionists are sometimes lumped together as " teetotalers " ( compare list of teetotalers ) , sharing some similar arguments . However , prohibitionists abstain from alcohol as a matter of law ( that is , they believe God requires abstinence in all ordinary circumstances ) , while abstentionists abstain as a matter of prudence ( that is , they believe total abstinence is the wisest and most loving way to live in the present circumstances ) . 
 Some groups of Christians fall entirely or virtually entirely into one of these categories , while others are divided between them . Fifty @-@ two percent of Evangelical leaders around the world say drinking alcohol is incompatible with being a good Evangelical . Even now nominally " Christian " countries still have 42 % who say it is incompatible . Evangelicals in Asia , Africa , and also in Muslim @-@ majority countries are decidedly against drinking . 
 = = = Moderationism = = = 
 The moderationist position is held by Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox , and within Protestantism , it is accepted by Anglicans , Lutherans and many Reformed churches . Moderationism is also accepted by Jehovah 's Witnesses . 
 Moderationism argues that , according to the biblical and traditional witness , ( 1 ) alcohol is a good gift of God that is rightly used in the Eucharist and for making the heart merry , and ( 2 ) while its dangers are real , it may be used wisely and moderately rather than being shunned or prohibited because of potential abuse . Moderationism holds that temperance ( that is , moderation or self @-@ control ) in all of one 's behavior , not abstinence , is the biblical norm . 
 On the first point , moderationists reflect the Hebrew mindset that all creation is good . The ancient Canons of the Apostles , which became part of Canon Law in the eastern and western churches , likewise allows church leaders and laity to abstain from wine for mortification of the flesh but requires that they not " <unk> " or detest it , which attitude " blasphemously abuses " the good creation . Going further , John Calvin says that " it is lawful to use wine not only in cases of necessity , but also thereby to make us merry , " and in his Genevan Catechism , he answers that wine is appropriate in the Lord 's Supper because " by wine the hearts of men are gladdened , their strength recruited , and the whole man strengthened , so by the blood of our Lord the same benefits are received by our souls . " 
 On the second point , Martin Luther employs a reductio ad absurdum to counter the idea that abuse should be met with disuse : " [ W ] e must not ... reject [ or ] condemn anything because it is abused ... [ W ] ine and women bring many a man to misery and make a fool of him ( <unk> . 19 : 2 ; 31 : 30 ) ; so [ we would need to ] kill all the women and pour out all the wine . " In dealing with drunkenness at the love feast in Corinth , St. Paul does not require total abstinence from drink but love for one another that would express itself in moderate , selfless behavior . However , moderationists approve of voluntary abstinence in several cases , such as for a person who finds it too difficult to drink in moderation and for the benefit of the " weaker brother , " who would err because of a stronger Christian exercising his or her liberty to drink . 
 While all moderationists approve of using ( fermented ) wine in the Eucharist in principle ( Catholics , the Orthodox , and Anglicans require it ) , because of prohibitionist heritage and a sensitivity to those who wish to abstain from alcohol , many offer either grape juice or both wine and juice at their celebrations of the Lord 's Supper . Some Christians mix some water with the wine following ancient tradition , and some attach a mystical significance to this practice . 
 = = = = Comparison = = = = 
 In addition to lexical and historical differences , moderationism holds that prohibitionism errs by confusing the Christian virtues of temperance and moderation with abstinence and prohibition and by locating the evil in the object that is abused rather than in the heart and deeds of the abuser . Moreover , moderationists suggest that the prohibitionist and abstentionist positions denigrate God 's creation and his good gifts and deny that it is not what goes into a man that makes him evil but what comes out ( that is , what he says and does ) . The Bible never uses the word ' wine ' of communion . Yet moderationists hold that in banishing wine from communion and dinner tables , prohibitionists and abstentionists go against the ' witness of the Bible ' and the church throughout the ages and implicitly adopt a <unk> moralism that is at odds with the what moderationists consider the right approach to biblical ethics and the doctrines of sin and sanctification . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The abstentionist position is held by many Baptists , Pentecostals , Nazarene , Methodists , and other evangelical and Protestant groups including the Salvation Army . Prominent proponents of abstentionism include Billy Graham , John F. MacArthur , R. Albert Mohler , Jr . , and John Piper . 
 Abstentionists believe that although alcohol consumption is not inherently sinful or necessarily to be avoided in all circumstances , it is generally not the wisest or most prudent choice . While most abstentionists do not require abstinence from alcohol for membership in their churches , they do often require it for leadership positions . 
 Some reasons commonly given for voluntary abstention are : 
 The Bible warns that alcohol can hinder moral discretion . As discussed above , Proverbs 31 : 4 @-@ 5 warns kings and rulers that they might " forget what is decreed , and pervert the rights of all the afflicted . " Some abstentionists speak of alcohol as " corrupt [ ing ] " the body and as a substance that can " impair my judgment and further distract me from God ’ s will for my life . " 
 Christians must be sensitive to the " weaker brother " , that is , the Christian who believes imbibing to be a sin . On this point MacArthur says , " [ T ] he primary reason I don 't do a lot of things I could do , including drinking wine or any alcoholic beverage , [ is ] because I know some believers would be offended by it ... [ M ] any Christians will drink their beer and wine and flaunt their liberty no matter what anyone thinks . Consequently , there is a rift in the fellowship . " 
 Christians should make a public statement against drunkenness because of the negative consequences it can have on individuals , families , and society as a whole . Some abstentionists believe that their witness as persons of moral character is also enhanced by this choice . 
 Additionally , abstentionists argue that while drinking may have been more acceptable in ancient times ( for instance , using wine to purify polluted drinking water ) , modern circumstances have changed the nature of a Christian 's responsibility in this area . First , some abstentionists argue that wine in biblical times was weaker and diluted with water such that drunkenness was less common , though few non @-@ abstentionists accept this claim as wholly accurate or conclusive . Also , the invention of more efficient distillation techniques has led to more potent and cheaper alcohol , which in turn has lessened the economic barrier to drinking to excess compared to biblical times . 
 = = = = Comparison = = = = 
 On historical and lexical grounds , many abstentionists reject the argument of prohibitionists that wine in the Bible was not alcoholic and that imbibing is nearly always a sin . Piper summarizes the abstentionist position on this point : 
 The consumption of food and drink is in itself no basis for judging a person 's standing with God ... [ The Apostle Paul 's ] approach to these abuses [ of food and drink ] was never to forbid food or drink . It was always to forbid what destroyed God 's temple and injured faith . He taught the principle of love , but did not determine its application with regulations in matters of food and drink . 
 Abstentionists also reject the position of moderationists that in many circumstances Christians should feel free to drink for pleasure because abstentionists see alcohol as inherently too dangerous and not " a necessity for life or good living , " with some even going so far as to say , " Moderation is the cause of the liquor problem . "

 The prohibitionist position has experienced a general reduction of support since the days of prohibitionism as a movement , with many of its advocates becoming abstentionists instead . Groups adopting prohibitionist positions include the Southern Baptist Convention and Seventh @-@ day Adventists . The former group resolved that their " churches be urged to give their full moral support to the prohibition cause , and to give a more liberal financial support to dry organizations which stand for the united action of our people against the liquor traffic . " Charles Spurgeon : " I wish the man who made the law to open them had to keep all the families that they have brought to ruin . Beer shops are the enemies of the home ; therefore , the sooner their licenses are taken away , the better . " The founder of the Salvation Army William Booth was a prohibitionist , and saw alcohol as evil in itself and not safe for anyone to drink in moderation . In 1990 , the Salvation Army re @-@ affirms : " It would be inconsistent for any <unk> to drink while at the same time seeking to help others to give it up . " David Wilkerson founder of Teen Challenge said similar things to The Assembly of God : " a little alcohol is too much since drinking in moderation provides Satan an opening to cruel deception . " Billy Sunday : " After all is said that can be said on the liquor traffic , its influence is degrading on the individual , the family , politics and business and upon everything that you touch in this old world . " 
 Prohibitionists such as Stephen Reynolds and Jack Van Impe hold that the Bible forbids partaking of alcohol altogether , with some arguing that the alleged medicinal use of wine in 1 Timothy 5 : 23 is a reference to unfermented grape juice . They argue that the words for alcoholic beverages in the Bible can also refer to non @-@ alcoholic versions such as unfermented grape juice , and for this reason the context must determine which meaning is required . In passages where the beverages are viewed negatively , prohibitionists understand them to mean the alcoholic drinks , and where they are viewed positively , they understand them to mean non @-@ alcoholic drinks . Prohibitionists also accuse most Bible translators of exhibiting a bias in favor of alcohol that obscures the meaning of the original texts . 
 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints , the largest body of the Latter Day Saint movement , also teaches that " God has spoken against the use of ... [ a ] <unk> . " They base this teaching on the Word of Wisdom , a section in Doctrine and Covenants which is part of the Mormon canon , that recommends against the ordinary use of alcohol , though it makes an exception for the use of wine in the sacrament , a similar rite to the Eucharist . However , the church now uses water instead of wine in the sacrament , and since 1851 , the Word of Wisdom 's advice for wise living has been considered " a binding commandment on all Church members . " 
 Many Prohibitionist Christians have claimed that the wine Jesus created in John 2 and drank at the Last Supper were non @-@ alcoholic grape juice ; however , the Greek word <unk> , used in the account of the wedding feast in Cana , is also used to describe alcohol in Ephesians 5 : 18 . 
 = Charles Melville Hays = 
 Charles Melville Hays ( May 16 , 1856 – April 15 , 1912 ) was the president of the Grand Trunk Railway . He began working in the railroad business as a clerk at the age of 17 and quickly rose through the ranks of management to become the General Manager of the Wabash , St. Louis and Pacific Railway . He became Vice @-@ President of that company in 1889 and remained as such until 1896 when he became General Manager of the Grand Trunk Railway ( GTR ) of Canada . 
 Hays left GTR for a short time to serve as the President of the Southern Pacific Railway Company but returned to GTR after one year . As Vice @-@ President and General Manager of GTR he is credited with keeping the company from bankruptcy . In 1909 , he became the president of GTR and all its consolidated lines , subsidiary railroads , and steamship companies . He was known for his philanthropy and received the Order of the Rising Sun , third class , from the Emperor of Japan in 1907 . 
 Hays is credited with the formation of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway ( GTP ) , a dream he had to create a second transcontinental railroad within the borders of Canada . He is also blamed for the insolvency of both the GTR and the GTP . He died before his dream was complete as he perished at sea in the sinking of the RMS Titanic . Before the ship collided with an iceberg , Hays made a statement that was prophetic of the disaster . His body was recovered , and he was buried in Montreal . He was survived by his wife and four daughters .

 Charles Melville Hays was born in Rock Island , Illinois on May 16 , 1856 . His family moved to St. Louis , Missouri when he was a child . 
 = = = Career = = = 
 In 1873 , at the age of 17 , he began his career in the railroad business working for the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad in St. Louis . From 1877 to 1884 , Hays was Secretary to the General Manager of the Missouri Pacific Railroad . Beginning in 1884 , he held the same position with the Wabash , St. Louis and Pacific Railway until 1886 , when he became that company 's General Manager . In 1889 , he became Vice @-@ President of the <unk> Railroad and remained as such until 1896 , when he became General Manager of the Grand Trunk Railway ( GTR ) of Canada . 
 In 1901 , Hays left GTR to serve as the President of the Southern Pacific Railway Company but returned to the company in January 1902 as Vice @-@ President and General Manager . In October 1909 , he was appointed president of GTR , which also gave him control of its subsidiary railroad and steamship companies . These included the Central Vermont Railway , the Grand Trunk Western Railway , the Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway , the Detroit and Toledo Shoreline Railroad , the Toledo , Saginaw and Muskegon Railway , the Southern New England Railway Company , the Canadian Express Company , and several others . In addition , he was sought after to help manage several philanthropies . He was Governor of the Royal Victoria Hospital , Montreal , Montreal General Hospital and McGill University . He received the Order of the Rising Sun , third class , from the Emperor of Japan in 1907 for assistance he gave the Imperial Government Railways . 
 When Hays became General Manager of GTR in 1896 , it was near bankruptcy and under @-@ performing its rival , the Canadian Pacific Railway ( CPR ) . On the advice of American financier J. Pierpont Morgan , the GTR board selected Hays as General Manager to bring more aggressive , " American " business practices to the company . He reorganized the management of the company and successfully negotiated running rights with CPR . He also brought more efficiency to the handling of accounts , built new track and ordered more powerful locomotives . These changes produced an era of greater success for the railroad . 
 = = = = Transcontinental Railway = = = = 
 At this time in Canadian history the western prairies were being rapidly settled . Hays wanted to capitalize on the trend by constructing a transcontinental railroad , within the borders of Canada , to run 3 @,@ 600 miles from Moncton , New Brunswick , to Prince Rupert , British Columbia . In 1900 , he introduced a proposal to extend the lines of the Grand Trunk Western , an American subsidiary , from Chicago to Winnipeg , " and thence to the Pacific . " However , he was turned down by the railroad 's directors in London . Later that year , Hays left GTR to work for Southern Pacific , but a change in ownership there lead to his resignation . He returned to the GTR to find that the president , Sir Charles Rivers Wilson , had convinced the Board of Directors to pursue the transcontinental railway . Meanwhile , the government , under Sir Wilfrid Laurier , had also decided to back the project . Plans to construct the transcontinental line were announced on November 24 , 1902 . 
 Hays ' plan involved the creation of a subsidiary line from Winnipeg to Prince Rupert , with the government building the line from New Brunswick to Winnipeg . The cabinet became weary of Hays ' demands for subsidies , but after negotiations between the government and Hays , aided by the railroad 's president Rivers Wilson , the National Transcontinental Railway Act was passed in 1903 . It enabled the incorporation of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway ( GTP ) . The government 's portion of the line would be called the National Transcontinental Railway ( NTR ) . 
 There were problems with some of Hays ' policies regarding the GTP . 
 Firstly , he had planned to buy out the Canadian Northern Railway ( CNoR ) , but the company resisted and instead provided competition . 
 Secondly , Hays lacked support from the Board of Directors in London ; he wanted to link the GTR with the GTP , but the board would not back this plan . He thus proceeded on his own authority , making commitments that would ultimately ruin both the GTP and the GTR . 
 Thirdly , Hays faced opposition to his choice of Prince Rupert , on Kaien Island , B.C. , for the western terminal , because there was not much traffic there . Hays preferred the location as he believed it would provide a shorter route for transshipment to destinations in Asia . 
 Hays made the construction of the mainline his priority , failing to develop feeder lines . CNoR and CPR joined forces to gain control of the prairie traffic . The competition among the three railroads led to Canada 's ending up with three transcontinental railways instead of one . This was to result in the GTP 's being starved of traffic ; even though it was arguably the best of the three , it ultimately failed to attract enough freight to make it profitable . 
 After construction on the GTP began in 1905 , Hays started the Grand Trunk Pacific Development Company in order to purchase thousands of acres of land on which he established town sites along the route of the railway , including Melville , Saskatchewan , which was named after him . Hays ' vision went beyond the building of the railway . He also had plans for a fleet of ocean liners and a string of resort hotels across the Rocky Mountains . He hired the famed architect Francis <unk> from CPR to design a grand hotel , the Château Prince Rupert , at the westernmost stop on the railway . In 1909 , only 3000 people lived in Prince Rupert , but anticipation of the railroad caused it to grow rapidly , despite the rapidly rising cost of property and the muddy environs . The city was incorporated in 1910 . 
 After Rivers Wilson retired as the railroad 's president in 1909 , Hays was appointed to fill the position . By 1910 , Grand Trunk union workers were demanding wages on par with those of railroad workers in the United States . A strike put a stop to construction . Hays finally gave into the workers ' demands but failed to re @-@ hire 250 previously fired strikers , despite promising to do so . He also denied workers their pensions , causing one member of Parliament to describe him as " heartless , cruel , and tyrannical " . 
 By 1912 , the cost of constructing the railway was increasing , with rising wages and price increases on materials , while the government refused to allow a rate increase . Another reason for the mounting costs was Hays ' insistence on " building to the very highest standards " . Meanwhile , CNoR and CPR monopolized the traffic in the west . In addition , Grand Trunk , which would be leasing the NTR from the government , was responsible for paying back the construction cost of that line . Hays began to fear insolvency .

 In April 1912 , Hays was in London soliciting financial support for the GTP . He was anxious to get back to Canada for the opening of the Château Laurier in Ottawa , Ontario , named after Prime Minister Laurier . The gala opening of this hotel was set for April 25 , 1912 . Hays had also received news that his daughter Louise was having difficulty with her pregnancy . 
 Additionally , he might have had business with J. Bruce Ismay , chairman of the White Star Line ; in any case , <unk> had invited Hays to join him on the RMS Titanic . Hays , his wife , Clara , his daughter , Orian ( see source note ) , his son @-@ in @-@ law , Thornton Davidson , his secretary , Mr. Vivian Payne , and a maid , Miss Mary Anne Perreault , shared a deluxe suite ( cabin <unk> ) on the Promenade Deck . 
 At 11 : 40 pm on April 14 , 1912 , Titanic struck an iceberg . Hays helped the women in his party into one of the ship 's 20 lifeboats , but he , his son @-@ in @-@ law , and his secretary remained and perished when the ship sank , along with 1 @,@ 500 other Titanic passengers and crew . Hays was reported to have made a prophetic remark on the evening of the disaster ; deploring the way the steamship lines were competing to win passengers with ever @-@ faster vessels , he is said to have commented , " The time will come soon when this trend will be checked by some appalling disaster . "

 Hays ' body was recovered from the waters of the North Atlantic by the Minia , and he was buried at Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal . Two funerals were held for him on May 8 – one at the American Presbyterian Church in Montreal , the other in London at the Church of St Edmund , King and Martyr 
 = = = After his death = = = 
 Hays died before he could see the GTP through to completion . He was eulogized as one of the greatest railwaymen in Canada , and work on the GTR was stopped for five minutes , on April 25 , 1912 , in his memory . During the period in which Hays led the GTR it saw its most prosperous era . 
 However , his policies led to the GTP 's collapse in 1919 . The company was placed in receivership , and the government seized GTR 's stock . It was later alleged that Hays had deceived the company 's London directors in 1903 by committing them to conditions in the railway 's agreements with the Canadian government for the building of the GTP that they did not agree to . That scheme was blamed for the company 's collapse . 
 The railroad car in which his body was transported back to Montreal is preserved at the Canadian Railway Museum near Delson , Quebec . There is a statue of him in Prince Rupert , and the city of Melville , Saskatchewan , is named after him , as is the village of <unk> , British Columbia .

 One source used here ( Hacking ) names the daughter with Hays on the Titanic as " Margaret " , however , it was daughter Orian who was traveling with her husband , Thorton Davidson .

There was a 24 @-@ year @-@ old woman , named Margaret Bechstein Hays on the Titanic , but she was staying in a different compartment than the C.M. Hays party , with another group of people . She escaped via lifeboat No. 7 ( with her Pomeranian , Lady ) , while the other Hays women boarded lifeboat No. 3 . Early newspaper reports said that Clara and Margaret Hays , and Mrs. Thornton [ Orian ] Davidson disembarked the rescue ship in New York City together and boarded a train for Montreal , while other sources say that Margaret Hays lived in New York and took care of two young child survivors ( Edmond and Michael Navratil ) , who were unclaimed immediately following the disaster . Margaret ( Hays ) Easton 's 1913 wedding announcement says her father , Frank Hays , walked her down the aisle . Finally , Orian 's death notice lists Marjorie ( Mrs. George Hall ) — not Margaret Easton — as a predeceased sister .

 = HMS Gipsy ( <unk> ) = 
 HMS Gipsy was a G @-@ class destroyer built for the Royal Navy during the 1930s . She spent most of the pre @-@ war period as part of the Mediterranean Fleet . The ship was transferred to the British Isles to escort shipping in local waters shortly after the beginning of World War II . Less than a month after her arrival she struck a mine outside Harwich and sank with the loss of 30 of her crew . Her wreck was salvaged and slowly scrapped over the course of the war . 
 = = Description = = 
 Gipsy displaced 1 @,@ 350 long tons ( 1 @,@ 370 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 883 long tons ( 1 @,@ 913 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of 323 feet ( 98 @.@ 5 m ) , a beam of 33 feet ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 5 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 34 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 25 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3 @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers . Gipsy carried a maximum of 470 long tons ( 480 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 5 @,@ 530 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 240 km ; 6 @,@ 360 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime . 
 The ship mounted four 45 @-@ calibre 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) Mark IX guns in single mounts . For anti @-@ aircraft defence Gipsy had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0 @.@ 5 inch Vickers Mark III machine gun . She was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . One rail and two depth charge throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began . 
 = = Service = = 
 Gipsy was laid down by the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company , at Govan , Scotland on 4 September 1934 , launched on 7 November 1935 and completed on 22 February 1936 . Excluding government @-@ furnished equipment like the armament , the ship cost £ 250 @,@ 364 . Aside from a brief period assigned to the 20th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet after her commissioning , Gipsy spent the pre @-@ war period assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla with the Mediterranean Fleet . She was refitted at Devonport Dockyard between 2 June and 30 July 1938 . 
 On the outbreak of war in September 1939 , Gipsy was deployed with the 1st Destroyer Flotilla for patrols and contraband control in the Eastern Mediterranean , based at Alexandria . Gipsy and her entire flotilla were transferred to the Western Approaches Command at Plymouth in October . On 12 November she collided with her sister ship , Greyhound , en route to Harwich , and her new assignment with the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla , but she was only slightly damaged . The ship rescued three German airmen outside Harwich harbour on 21 November and returned to port to turn them over the army . Later that evening , Gipsy set out with destroyers Griffin , Keith and Boadicea to patrol in the North Sea . She struck a magnetic mine amidships outside the harbour , possibly laid by the aircraft whose crew she had rescued earlier that day , and sank . Thirty of her crew , including the captain , were killed . The 115 survivors were rescued by the other destroyers . 
 The ship 's wreck was upright on the seabed with only the bridge visible at high tide , but it blocked the channel . Only buckled plating amidships held the two main sections of the wreck together and they were cut by explosives when salvage began shortly after her sinking . The two halves were raised by pontoons , and were subsequently broken up . 750 long tons ( 760 t ) of ferrous scrap and 38 long tons ( 39 t ) of non @-@ ferrous metals were recovered between June 1940 and February 1944 . 
 = Wild and Free @-@ Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 = 
 The Wild and Free @-@ Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 ( WFRHBA ) , is an Act of Congress ( Pub.L. 92 – 195 ) , signed into law by President Richard M. Nixon on December 18 , 1971 . The act covered the management , protection and study of " unbranded and unclaimed horses and burros on public lands in the United States . " 
 By the 1900s , feral horse populations were in decline , and there was concern that the horses were destroying land and resources wanted by ranching and hunting interests . Pressure on federal agencies from the 1930s on led to a series of policies which severely reduced herd numbers . By the 1950s , modern practices for capturing horses came to the attention of individuals such as Velma Bronn Johnston , also known as " Wild Horse Annie , " who felt the measures were extreme and cruel . Their activism resulted in the Hunting Wild Horses and Burros on Public Lands Act in 1959 . However , the 1959 Act did not resolve all the advocate 's concerns , leading to the passage of the Wild and Free @-@ Roaming Horses and Burros Act in 1971 . The Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) and U.S. Forest Service manage these herds . Although the BLM struggled to implement adequate herd management in many areas , in 1973 they began a successful program for rounding up excess numbers , and adopting out these captured horses and burros to private owners . This remains the primary method of removing excess horses and burros from managed land , though in recent years the adoption rate has not kept up with the removal rate , and most horses are currently diverted to long @-@ term holding facilities . Administrative challenges to BLM 's management and implementation of the act have been made to the Department of the Interior 's Board of Land Appeals . 
 The act has also been challenged in court . Objections have been varied , focusing on constitutionality , and legal status of the animals , but the Act has been upheld in all instances , including Kleppe v. New Mexico , before the United States Supreme Court . Charges have also been made that the BLM has turned a blind eye to the practice of private investors adopting feral horses for the purposes of slaughter , and courts have determined that the BLM may not ignore the intent of adopters . Congress has taken several actions that affect the act by including provisions in other bills . These provisions have addressed the manner in which horses may be rounded up and the method by which horses may be offered for sale or adoption . 
 = = Contents = = 
 The act provides specific protections to " all unbranded and unclaimed horses and burros on public lands of the United States , " and makes it a crime for anyone to harass or kill these animals on federal land . It requires the departments of the Interior and Agriculture to protect the animals . Beginning with its enactment , it required studies of the habits and habitats of free @-@ ranging horses and burros , permitting public land to be set aside for their use . In addition , the act required that these horses and burros be protected as " living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West " , The BLM was tasked with identification of the areas where free @-@ roaming horses and burros were found , no there was no specific amount of acreage set aside , and the Act required management plans to " maintain a thriving natural ecological balance among wild horse populations , wildlife , livestock , and vegetation and to protect the range from the deterioration associated with overpopulation . " Although wild horse ranges were principally for the protection of the horses , the land was required to be maintained for multiple use . The BLM was also permitted to close public land to livestock grazing to protect wild horse and burro habitat . 
 = = History = = 
 Although the Act uses the technical language " wild free @-@ roaming " to describe the horses and burros protected under the Act , the BLM notes that " today 's American wild horses should not be considered ' native ' . " All protected animals descend from domesticated horses and burros brought to the Americas beginning in the 1500s . Some escaped to the wild while others were released , and over the ensuing centuries , these feral animals adapted to the Western range . Due to the Act , the BLM manages horses and burros as " wild " regardless of their native or non @-@ native status .
