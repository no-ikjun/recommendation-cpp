 A core element of F.E.A.R. is its horror theme , which is heavily inspired by Japanese horror . The design team attempted to keep " [ the ] psychology of the encounter " in the player 's mind at all times , in order to " get under [ the player 's ] skin " , as opposed to the " in your face ' monsters jumping out of closets ' approach " . Lead designer Craig Hubbard stated in an interview that " horror is extremely fragile ... you can kill it by spelling things out too clearly and you can undermine it with too much ambiguity " . He remarked that he attempted to strike a balance with the narrative elements of F.E.A.R. , to give players " enough clues so that [ they ] can form [ their ] own theories about what 's going on , but ideally [ they will ] be left with some uncertainty " . Lead level designer John Mulkey stated , " Creating expectation and then messing with that expectation is extremely important , predictability ruins a scary mood " . 
 The main source of the game 's horror is Alma , a ghostly little girl . Craig Hubbard remarked that " a guy in a mask chasing co @-@ eds with a meat cleaver can be scary , but on some level you 're thinking to yourself you could probably kick his ass if you got the drop on him ... but when a spooky little girl takes out an entire Delta Force squad , how are you supposed to deal with that ? " While Alma has been compared to the character Samara from The Ring , Craig Hubbard stated that she " ... was born out of a tradition of eerie , faceless female ghosts ... " and not " ... as an answer to any specific movie character . " Hubbard acknowledged that Alma " ... admittedly bears some visual resemblance to the ghosts in Dark Water or Séance " , but " ... creepy little girls have been freaking [ him ] out since The Shining . " Developers Dave Matthews and Nathan Hendrickson say the name ' Alma ' comes from the character Alma Mobley in Peter Straub 's novel Ghost Story . 
 F.E.A.R. ' s audio was designed in the style of Japanese horror films , with the sound engineers using inexpensive equipment to create sound effects , using methods including dragging metal across different surfaces and recording pump sounds . Monolith Productions commented , " The sound designers had to be concerned with avoiding predictability " , since " [ l ] <unk> are smart ... they will recognize your formula quickly and then you won 't be able to scare them anymore . " Silence is present in order to " ... allow players to fill in the space , which lets their imagination create their own personal horror " . 
 Monolith Productions composed F.E.A.R. ' s music in reaction to scenes , instead of " ... creating a formula that would consistently produce music throughout the game " . The design team called F.E.A.R. ' s music structure " ... more cerebral and tailored to each individual event " , and continued that " ... sometimes the music is used to ratchet up the tension to toy with players ... [ it ] will build to a terrifying crescendo before cutting off without a corresponding event , only to later have the silence shattered by Alma , when players least expect it . " 
 F.E.A.R. ' s horror theme was praised by critics . Game Informer claimed that " ... the frequent spooky head trips that Monolith has so skillfully woven together make an experience that demands to be played . " IGN opined that " ... the environment has been so well @-@ crafted to keep you edgy and watchful ... [ that ] playing the game for a few hours straight can get a little draining . " GameSpot reacted similarly , calling F.E.A.R. ' s horror " ... exceedingly effective " , and agreeing that it " ... can leave you a bit emotionally exhausted after a while . "

 = = = Story = = = 
 The game begins with a man named Paxton Fettel taking command of a battalion of telepathically controlled clone supersoldiers , seizing control of <unk> Technology Corporation ( ATC ) headquarters , and killing all its occupants . 
 The player then takes control of the Point Man , working for an organization known as F.E.A.R. ( First Encounter Assault Recon ) , attending a briefing held by Commissioner Rowdy Betters , in the company of his F.E.A.R. team @-@ mates Spen Jankowski and Jin Sun @-@ Kwon . The team 's mission is to eliminate Fettel , operating in conjunction with Delta Force . 
 Fettel is located by means of a satellite tracking device and hunted by F.E.A.R. and Delta Force over several locations . While the villain evades capture by the special forces , the player witnesses unexplained , and occasionally life @-@ threatening , paranormal phenomena , including hallucinations that frequently afflict him , all of which are centered on a red @-@ dressed little girl named Alma . <unk> found in the course of the mission , remotely hacked by Commissioner Betters , provide details regarding the background story ; the player learns how Fettel was raised to become a telepathic military commander , that he is the son of Alma , who is described as being a powerful psychic as part of Project Origin , . The files mention something called a " Synchronicity Event " , in which Alma telepathically linked with Fettel when he was ten years old , despite her being in a coma , and which is said to have resulted in several deaths . The files also mention the existence of another child of Alma , who was born before Fettel . 
 All clues lead F.E.A.R. to believe Fettel is being controlled by Alma , who was locked in the Origin facility when ATC closed down the project owing to the danger the woman posed ; Fettel is searching for that same facility to free his mother . The player takes the Point Man to the abandoned structure , fighting back both the clone soldiers and ATC guards , who have received orders to cover up the whole affair . When the protagonist comes to finally face Fettel , he is drawn into a hallucination where the player learns how the Point Man is Alma 's first son and is thereafter enabled to kill Fettel himself . 
 Alma is nonetheless freed when her storage chamber is opened by ATC researcher and leader of Project Origin , Harlan Wade , who felt guilty over the company 's treatment of Alma and who was actually her father . The player is then called to sabotage the structure 's reactor , running a gauntlet against Alma 's ghosts before the whole location explodes . In the aftermath of the detonation , a Delta Force Black Hawk helicopter extracts the Point Man from the rubble , rescuing him . While the player and the survivors of the F.E.A.R. team survey the results of the explosion from the helicopter , Jin wonders what happened to Alma . Just then , the helicopter loses power , and Alma is seen pulling herself up into the cabin : the destruction of the Origin facility has not stopped her quest to get closer to her son . 
 After the game 's credits , the player can listen to a phone call between a mysterious senator and ATC president Aristide , which offers some further explanation : the woman considers the project under control and deems the " first prototype " ( presumably a reference to the Point Man ) a success . 
 = = = Characters and organizations = = = 
 During the course of the game , the player interacts with a number of different characters from various organizations . Some of them are allies , such as the F.E.A.R. and Delta Force team members , while others are hostile , such as Fettel 's soldiers and some ATC personnel . The player 's character never speaks , and instead participates in one @-@ sided discussions with other characters . On occasion , the Point Man is required to hand a communicator to other characters , allowing them to speak over the F.E.A.R. team radio . No artificial intelligence @-@ controlled characters fight alongside the player in F.E.A.R. , except for some sequences in the expansions Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate .

 F.E.A.R. was announced at an E3 2004 pre @-@ show , though its existence as an untitled project was revealed prior to this announcement . The game 's first trailer later premiered at E3 2004 and was well received by critics . During the E3 2004 showing , F.E.A.R. ' s lead designer , Craig Hubbard , stated that the game " ... evolved out of a concept we started developing right after Shogo that we 've been dying to work on . " Monolith Productions ' director of technology , Kevin Stephens , later elaborated that this concept was " ... to make an action movie in a first @-@ person shooter , where you really feel like an action star . " To this effect , the team focused on immersing the player , using elements like a silent , nameless protagonist with an unknown background , and allowing the player to see the protagonist 's body when looking down or sideways . 
 During 2005 , F.E.A.R. made playable appearances at Consumer Electronics Show , Game Developers Conference and E3 , all of which were well received . Its showing at E3 garnered it the Game Critics Award for " Best Action Game " . After the release of a single @-@ player demo , Vivendi allowed gaming journalists to play through the first four levels of the game , which received even more positive reaction than before . F.E.A.R. eventually released on October 18 , 2005 . Alongside the basic CD @-@ ROM edition , a " Director 's Cut " DVD version of F.E.A.R. was released with a number of extra features . A Dark Horse Entertainment comic book and a series of live action vignettes help clarify a number of plot elements depicted in the game , while the " Making of F.E.A.R. " and " Developers ' commentary " documentaries offer several insights and trivia into the game 's development through interviews with employees of Monolith Productions and Vivendi . Also included is the exclusive first episode of the F.E.A.R. machinima , P.A.N.I.C.S. , created by " Rooster Teeth Productions " . 
 Over the course of the " Developer 's roundtable commentary " , producer Chris Hewitt reveals , " We had a whole level in the game where we had this car chase sequence [ ... ] we spent about two months on that thing .... " " [ B ] ut the car chase sequence didn 't work the way we hoped it would " , adds designer Craig Hubbard , commenting on the choice to remove that level from the game . Hewitt also comments that , " Actually we started off with two villains , and [ Fettel ] was one of them until we merged them together .... " Craig Hubbard also remarks that " ... his jacket actually used to belong to another villain we had in the game named Conrad Krieg , whom we combined with Fettel pretty literally . " 
 = = = Engine technology = = = 
 F.E.A.R. is the first game developed using the newest iteration of Monolith 's Lithtech engine . Codenamed " Jupiter EX " , the F.E.A.R. engine is driven by a DirectX 9 renderer and has seen major advancements from its direct precursor , " Jupiter " . The new engine includes both Havok physics and the Havok " Vehicle Kit " , which adds support for common vehicle behavior . The latter feature goes mostly unused in F.E.A.R. , as no vehicles appear outside of scripted sequences . 
 Graphically , F.E.A.R. uses normal mapping and parallax mapping to give textures a more realistic appearance ; the latter is used to give the appearance of depth to flat bullet hole sprites on walls . Volumetric lighting and <unk> are included with the addition of a per @-@ pixel lighting model , allowing complex lighting effects to be developed . Vertex , pixel and high @-@ level shaders , including a host of additional special effects , are also featured in Jupiter EX . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Prior to release , F.E.A.R. generated large amounts of hype from computer game journalists . Upon release , F.E.A.R. received critical acclaim , with Computer Gaming World calling it " ... one of the year 's top single @-@ player shooters ... " and PC Gamer regarding it as " ... the first game to convincingly channel the kinetic exhilaration of ' John Woo violence ' in the FPS format . " 
 IGN claimed that " Monolith forges new shooter territory with some truly freaky elements , challenge , fun , and beauty . " GameSpy praised the game 's plot , later awarding it their " Best Story " Game of the Year award . The New York Times thought differently , stating " I was never quite clear on what was going on in the game . I knew my goal — track down a psychic , escort a corporate executive 's daughter out of danger — but I didn 't ever care who these people were nor did I understand their motives . " The game has also received criticism for its system requirements , which called for an extremely powerful PC for its time . The Xbox 360 port has also received positive reviews , almost as favorable as the PC version . The multiplayer and instant @-@ action mode were praised for better gameplay , but the control scheme was negatively viewed . Reviews have also stated that it lacked bonus features , despite the new mission included in the game . GameSpot gave the game 8 @.@ 6 @.@ while IGN rated it 9 @.@ 1 
 The PlayStation 3 port received less favorable reviews than the other two versions , but still had positive reviews overall . It contained a different longer bonus mission than the one included in the Xbox 360 port , but the chief complaints of the negative reviewers were downgraded graphics and long loading times . GameSpot has given the port a 7 @.@ 1 , making it the third lowest rating of the F.E.A.R. franchise in GameSpot . 
 = = Later developments = = 
 Monolith Productions announced a sequel to F.E.A.R. , which is titled F.E.A.R. 2 : Project Origin after Monolith and Warner Bros. regained the rights to the F.E.A.R. name . Prior to September 2008 , the sequel was not to be titled F.E.A.R. 2 due to Vivendi 's ownership of the F.E.A.R. name . The game was instead to be called Project Origin , which is a name derived from a contest to name the sequel . The sequel remains in the game 's existing universe , retaining the original storyline and characters , but centering on a different character . Monolith Productions published the game with Warner Brothers Interactive Entertainment , which purchased the studio in 2004 while development of F.E.A.R. was under way , after which Vivendi Universal was dropped as publisher . Vivendi Universal published the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 ports of the original game , developed by Day 1 Studios . 
 An expansion pack titled F.E.A.R. Extraction Point was released by TimeGate Studios on October 24 , 2006 . The second expansion pack , F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate , also from TimeGate Studios , was released in November 2007 . F.E.A.R. Files was released simultaneously for the Xbox 360 , consisting of both Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate .

 In 2005 , Rooster Teeth Productions created P.A.N.I.C.S. or <unk> , an acronym for People Acting Normal In Crazy @-@ Ass Situations , is a comic science fiction series based on F.E.A.R. The series was produced primarily by using the machinima technique of synchronizing video footage from video games to pre @-@ recorded dialogue and other audio . The series was produced at the request of Monolith Productions as a part of a tie @-@ in with the Director 's Edition of the F.E.A.R. , which the Rooster Teeth team used to produce the series . The mini @-@ series consists of five episodes . Four of these have been released on the Rooster Teeth website , and one — episode 0 , a prequel — originally shipped exclusively with the F.E.A.R. Director 's Edition DVD . It is also included with the game 's digital release on GOG.com. 
 The story centers on a newcomer to Bravo Team , a special military group formed to battle supernatural enemies . As the series begins , Bravo Team has been sent into a military facility at night to investigate the reports of paranormal activity from within . This is a parody of the main scenario used in F.E.A.R. 
 = SM U @-@ 31 ( Austria @-@ Hungary ) = 
 SM U @-@ 31 or U @-@ XXXI was a U @-@ 27 class U @-@ boat or submarine for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . U @-@ 31 , built by the Hungarian firm of Ganz Danubius at Fiume , was launched in March 1917 and commissioned in April . 
 U @-@ 31 had a single hull and was just over 121 feet ( 37 m ) in length . She displaced nearly 265 metric tons ( 261 long tons ) when surfaced and over 300 metric tons ( 295 long tons ) when submerged . Her two diesel engines moved her at up to 9 knots ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) on the surface , while her twin electric motors propelled her at up to 7 @.@ 5 knots ( 13 @.@ 9 km / h ; 8 @.@ 6 mph ) while underwater . She was armed with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry a load of up to four torpedoes . She was also equipped with a 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) deck gun and a machine gun . 
 In October 1917 , U @-@ 31 sank while in port at Porto <unk> and was out of service through April 1918 while she was raised and repaired . During her service career , U @-@ 31 sank two ships and damaged one warship , sending a combined tonnage of 4 @,@ 088 GRT to the bottom . U @-@ 31 was at Cattaro at war 's end and was awarded to France as war reparation in 1920 , towed to Bizerta and scrapped there . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Austria @-@ Hungary 's U @-@ boat fleet was largely obsolete at the outbreak of World War I. The Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy satisfied its most urgent needs by purchasing five Type UB I submarines that comprised the U @-@ 10 class from Germany , by raising and recommissioning the sunken French submarine Curie as U @-@ 14 , and by building four submarines of the U @-@ 20 class that were based on the 1911 Danish Havmanden class . 
 After these steps alleviated their most urgent needs , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915 . The Germans were reluctant to allocate any of their wartime resources to Austro @-@ Hungarian construction , but were willing to sell plans for up to six of the UB II boats to be constructed under license in Austria @-@ Hungary . The Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from AG Weser of Bremen . 
 U @-@ 31 displaced 264 metric tons ( 260 long tons ) surfaced and 301 metric tons ( 296 long tons ) submerged . She had a single hull with saddle tanks , and was 121 feet 1 inch ( 36 @.@ 91 m ) long with a beam of 14 feet 4 inches ( 4 @.@ 37 m ) and a draft of 12 feet 2 inches ( 3 @.@ 71 m ) . For propulsion , she had two shafts , twin diesel engines of 270 bhp ( 200 kW ) for surface running , and twin electric motors of 280 shp ( 210 kW ) for submerged travel . She was capable of 9 knots ( 16 @.@ 7 km / h ) while surfaced and 7 @.@ 5 knots ( 13 @.@ 9 km / h ) while submerged . Although there is no specific notation of a range for U @-@ 31 in Conway 's All the World 's Fighting Ships , 1906 – 1921 , the German UB II boats , upon which the U @-@ 27 class was based , had a range of over 6 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 000 km ) at 5 knots ( 9 @.@ 3 km / h ) surfaced , and 45 nautical miles ( 83 km ) at 4 knots ( 7 @.@ 4 km / h ) submerged . U @-@ 27 @-@ class boats were designed for a crew of 23 – 24 . 
 U @-@ 31 was armed with two 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) bow torpedo tubes and could carry a complement of four torpedoes . She was also equipped with a 75 mm / 26 ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) deck gun and an 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun . 
 After intricate political negotiations to allocate production of the class between Austrian and Hungarian firms , U @-@ 27 was ordered from Ganz Danubius on 12 October 1915 . She was laid down on 4 July 1916 at Fiume and launched on 20 March 1917 . 
 = = Service career = = 
 After undergoing trials at Fiume during March , U @-@ 31 made a training voyage to Brioni in April . On 24 April 1917 , SM U @-@ 31 was commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy under the command of Linienschiffsleutnant Franz Nejebsy . Nejebsy , a 32 @-@ year @-@ old native of Teplitz @-@ <unk> , Bohemia ( present @-@ day Czech Republic ) , had previously served two stints as commander of U @-@ 1 . U @-@ 31 departed from Pola on 29 May to patrol along the Adriatic coast of Italy and returned on 5 June . U @-@ 31 departed for a patrol in the Mediterranean on 19 June . After a problem with a pump required a stop at Brioni , the U @-@ boat continued on . Nejebsy launched a torpedo attack on an armed yacht west of <unk> on 25 June , but the torpedoes missed their mark . U @-@ 31 ended her patrol at Cattaro after ventilation problems kept the temperature in the engine room from falling below 45 ° C ( 113 ° F ) . 
 After a month of repairs at Cattaro , U @-@ 31 headed out on another patrol on 6 August . On each of the next two days the U @-@ boat had to crash dive to avoid bombing attacks by French airplanes , the second day 's attack damaging the boat slightly . On 10 August , Nejebsy and U @-@ 31 scored their first kill with the sinking of am Italian cargo ship . The 4 @,@ 021 @-@ ton <unk> was carrying ammunition from Syracuse to Malta when U @-@ 31 intercepted her in the Ionian Sea east of Malta . An escorting destroyer dropped a pattern of ten depth charges over U @-@ 31 . The following day , Nejebsy was maneuvering U @-@ 31 into position to attack a convoy when the U @-@ boat was rammed from behind by a destroyer . U @-@ 31 's periscope was hit and twisted by the impact , forcing Nejebsy to end his attack and U @-@ 31 's patrol . On the way back to Cattaro , U @-@ 31 was attacked by an aircraft in the Straits of Otranto , but reached the safety of the port on 15 August . 
 U @-@ 31 was assigned to patrol the Austro @-@ Hungarian and Albanian coasts over the next six weeks . She headed to Fiume via Spalato on 16 October , reaching there three days later . On 26 October U @-@ 31 sank from an unknown cause in the harbor at Porto <unk> . When raised from her resting depth of 8 metres ( 26 ft ) the next day , one crewman was found alive inside the boat . U @-@ 31 was taken first to the Danubius shipyard at nearby Fiume , and , later , on to Pola for repairs and trials . 
 In January , while U @-@ 31 's repairs were still ongoing , Nejebsy was reassigned , leaving the U @-@ boat without a commander for the next three months . On 11 March Linienschiffsleutnant Hermann Rigele was transferred from the helm of U @-@ 20 to assume command of U @-@ 31 . Rigele , who had been born in Sarajevo , was 26 years old and had also been in command of U @-@ 17 and , before that , U @-@ 10 at age 25 . Rigele and U @-@ 31 departed Pola on 30 April for a three @-@ day cruise to Cattaro via Sebenico . On 20 May , the boat left Cattaro for a Mediterranean patrol , but had to turn back with leaks after a day . 
 In June , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy planned an assault on the Otranto Barrage , similar to a May 1917 action that evolved into the Battle of Otranto Straits . U @-@ 31 was deployed from Cattaro on 9 June in advance of the attack . One of the seven separate groups participating in the attack — dreadnoughts Tegetthoff and Szent István — came under attack from Italian MAS torpedo boats in the early morning hours of 10 June . Szent István was hit and sank just after 06 : 00 , and the entire operation was called off . U @-@ 31 returned to Cattaro on 12 June . 
 On 16 June , Rigele and U @-@ 31 again set out for a Mediterranean patrol , but had to immediately return with clutch problems . Two days later , the U @-@ boat set out again for the Mediterranean . The next day , 19 June , Rigele had to take the boat to a depth of 40 metres ( 130 ft ) to avoid a depth charge attack . On 7 July , Rigele stopped the Italian sailing vessel <unk> Padre and , using explosive charges , sank the 67 @-@ ton ship . U @-@ 31 ended her patrol at Cattaro on 10 July . Over the next two months , the submarine operated in the Adriatic out of Cattaro and Pola , patrolling off Durazzo and the Albanian coast . 
 After the Armistice with Bulgaria on 29 September ended Bulgaria 's participation in the war , Durazzo gained importance to the remaining Central Powers as the main port for supplying their forces fighting in the Balkans . Anticipating this , the Allies put together a force to bombard Durazzo . While the second echelon of the attacking force got into position to shell the town , U @-@ 31 and sister boat U @-@ 29 , both patrolling off Durazzo , maneuvered to attack . Although U @-@ 29 was blocked by screening ships and experienced a heavy depth charge attack , U @-@ 31 was able to get in position to launch torpedoes at the British cruiser Weymouth . One of them hit its mark and blew the stern off of Weymouth , killing four sailors in the process . The other British cruisers involved in the attack took the damaged Weymouth under tow and departed . United States Navy submarine chasers were involved in the depth charge attacks on U @-@ 29 and U @-@ 31 and erroneously claimed that they had sunk both of the submarines . U @-@ 31 was able to make her way back to Cattaro on 6 October . 
 Over the next three weeks , U @-@ 31 patrolled between Cattaro and Antivari , Montenegro . After her arrival back at Cattaro on 26 October , she remained there until she was awarded to France as a war reparation in 1920 . U @-@ 31 was towed , along with sister boats U @-@ 29 and U @-@ 41 , from Cattaro for scrapping at Bizerta . In total , U @-@ 31 sank two ships with a combined tonnage of 4 @,@ 088 , and damaged one warship .

 = Adelaide Anne Procter = 
 Adelaide Anne Procter ( 30 October 1825 – 2 February 1864 ) was an English poet and philanthropist . She worked prominently on behalf of unemployed women and the homeless , and was actively involved with feminist groups and journals . Procter never married . She became unhealthy , possibly due to her charity work , and died of tuberculosis at the age of 38 . 
 Procter 's literary career began when she was a teenager ; her poems were primarily published in Charles Dickens 's periodicals Household Words and All the Year Round and later published in book form . Her charity work and her conversion to Roman Catholicism appear to have strongly influenced her poetry , which deals most commonly with such subjects as homelessness , poverty , and fallen women . 
 Procter was the favourite poet of Queen Victoria . Her poetry went through numerous editions in the 19th century ; Coventry Patmore called her the most popular poet of the day , after Alfred , Lord Tennyson . Her poems were set to music and made into hymns , and were published in the United States and Germany as well as in England . Nonetheless , by the early 20th century her reputation had diminished , and few modern critics have given her work attention . Those who have , however , argue that Procter 's work is significant , in part for what it reveals about how Victorian women expressed otherwise repressed feelings . 
 = = Life = = 
 Adelaide Anne Procter was born at 25 Bedford Square in the Bloomsbury district of London , on 30 October 1825 to the poet Bryan Waller Procter and his wife Anne ( née <unk> ) . The family had strong literary ties : novelist Elizabeth Gaskell enjoyed her visits to the Procter household , and Procter 's father was friends with poet Leigh Hunt , essayist Charles Lamb , and novelist Charles Dickens , as well as being acquainted with poet William Wordsworth and critic William Hazlitt . Family friend Bessie Rayner Belloc wrote in 1895 that " everybody of any literary pretension whatever seemed to flow in and out of the house . The <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the Dickens [ sic ] , the <unk> , never seemed to be exactly visitors , but to belong to the place . " Author and actress Fanny Kemble wrote that young Procter " looks like a poet 's child , and a poet ... [ with ] a <unk> @-@ naturally [ sic ] thoughtful , mournful expression for such a little child " . 
 Dickens spoke highly of Procter 's quick intelligence . By his account , the young Procter mastered without difficulty the subjects to which she turned her attention : 
 When she was quite a young child , she learnt with facility several of the problems of Euclid . As she grew older , she acquired the French , Italian , and German languages ... piano @-@ forte ... [ and ] drawing . But , as soon as she had completely vanquished the difficulties of any one branch of study , it was her way to lose interest in it , and pass to another . 
 A voracious reader , Procter was largely self @-@ taught , though she studied at Queen 's College in Harley Street in 1850 . The college had been founded in 1848 by Frederick Maurice , a Christian Socialist ; the faculty included novelist Charles Kingsley , composer John <unk> , and writer Henry Morley . 
 Procter showed a love of poetry from an early age , carrying with her while still a young child a " tiny album ... into which her favourite passages were copied for her by her mother 's hand before she herself could write ... as another little girl might have carried a doll " . Procter published her first poem while still a teenager ; the poem , " <unk> Angels " , appeared in Heath 's Book of Beauty in 1843 . In 1853 she submitted work to Dickens 's Household Words under the name " Mary Berwick " , wishing that her work be judged on its own merits rather than in relation to Dickens 's friendship with her father ; Dickens did not learn " Berwick 's " identity till the following year . The poem 's publication began Proctor 's long association with Dickens 's periodicals ; in all , Procter published 73 poems in Household Words and 7 poems in All the Year Round , most of which were collected into her first two volumes of poetry , both entitled Legends and Lyrics . She was also published in Good Words and Cornhill . As well as writing poetry , Procter was the editor of the journal Victoria Regia , which became the showpiece of the Victoria Press , " an explicitly feminist publishing venture " . 
 In 1851 , Procter converted to Roman Catholicism . Following her conversion , Procter became extremely active in several charitable and feminist causes . She became a member of the Langham Place Group , which set out to improve conditions for women , and was friends with feminists Bessie Rayner Parkes ( later Bessie Rayner Belloc ) and Barbara Leigh Smith , later Barbara <unk> . Procter helped found the English Woman 's Journal in 1858 and , in 1859 , the Society for the Promotion of the Employment of Women , both of which focused on expanding women 's economic and employment opportunities . Though on paper Proctor was merely one member among many , fellow @-@ member Jessie Boucherett considered her to be the " animating spirit " of the Society . Her third volume of poetry , A Chaplet of Verses ( 1861 ) , was published for the benefit of a Catholic Night Refuge for Women and Children that had been founded in 1860 at Providence Row in East London . 
 Procter became engaged in 1858 , according to a letter that her friend William Makepeace Thackeray wrote to his daughters that year . The identity of Procter 's fiancé remains unknown , and the proposed marriage never took place . According to her German biographer Ferdinand <unk> , the engagement seems to have lasted several years before being broken off by Procter 's fiancé . Critic Gill Gregory suggests that Procter may have been a lesbian and in love with Matilda Hays , a fellow member of the Society for the Promotion of the Employment of Women ; other critics have called Procter 's relationship with Hays " emotionally intense . " Procter 's first volume of poetry , Legends and Lyrics ( 1858 ) was dedicated to Hays and that same year Procter wrote a poem titled " To <unk> " in which Procter " expresses love for Hays ... [ Hays was a ] novelist and translator of George Sand and a controversial figure ... [ who ] dressed in men 's clothes and had lived with the sculptor Harriet Hosmer in Rome earlier in the 1850s . " While several men showed interest in her , Procter never married . 
 Procter fell ill in 1862 ; Dickens and others have suggested that her illness was due to her extensive charity work , which " appears to have unduly taxed her strength " . An attempt to improve her health by taking a cure at Malvern failed . On 3 February 1864 , Procter died of tuberculosis , having been bed @-@ ridden for almost a year . Her death was described in the press as a " national calamity " . Procter was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery . 
 = = Literary career = = 
 Procter 's poetry was strongly influenced by her religious beliefs and charity work ; homelessness , poverty , and fallen women are frequent themes . Procter 's prefaces to her volumes of poetry stress the misery of the conditions under which the poor lived , as do poems such as " The Homeless Poor " : 
 In that very street , at that same hour , 
 In the bitter air and drifting sleet , 
 Crouching in a doorway was a mother , 
 With her children shuddering at her feet . 
 She was silent – who would hear her pleading ? 
 Men and beasts were housed – but she must stay 
 <unk> in the great and pitiless city , 
 Till the dawning of the winter day . ( 51 – 58 ) 
 Procter 's Catholicism also influenced her choice of images and symbols ; Procter often uses references to the Virgin Mary , for example , to " introduce secular and Protestant readers to the possibility that a heavenly order critiques Victorian gender ideology 's power structure . " 
 Procter wrote several poems about war ( the majority of poems published on this topic in Household Words were by Procter ) , although she rarely deals directly with the topic , preferring to leave war " in the background , something to be inferred rather than stated . " Generally , these poems portray conflict as something " that might unite a nation that had been divided by class distinctions . " 
 According to critic Gill Gregory , Procter " does not overtly ponder the vexed question of the poet , particularly the woman poet and her accession to fame " , unlike many other women poets of the time , such as Felicia Hemans and Letitia Elizabeth Landon . Procter is instead primarily concerned with the working classes , particularly working @-@ class women , and with " emotions of women antagonists which have not fully found expression " . Procter 's work often embodies a Victorian aesthetic of sentimentality , but , according to Francis O 'Gorman , does so with " peculiar strength " ; Procter employs emotional affect without simplification , holding " emotional energy [ in tension ] ... against complications and nuances . " Procter 's language is simple ; she expressed to a friend a " morbid terror of being misunderstood and misinterpreted " , and her poetry is marked by " simplicity , directness , and clarity of expression " . 
 = = = Reputation = = = 
 Procter was " fabulously popular " in the mid @-@ 19th century ; she was Queen Victoria 's favourite poet and Coventry Patmore stated that the demand for her work was greater than that for any other poet , excepting Alfred , Lord Tennyson . Readers valued Procter 's poems for their plainness of expression , although they were considered " not so very original in thought ; [ their merit is that ] they are indeed the utterances ' of a believing heart ' , pouring out its fulness . " Procter herself expressed little ambition about her work : her friend Bessie Raynor Belloc thought that Procter was pained that her reputation as a poet had outstripped her father 's , and quoted Procter as saying that " Papa is a poet . I only write verses . " 
 Procter 's popularity continued after her death ; the first volume of Legends and Lyrics went through 19 editions by 1881 , and the second through 14 editions by the same year . Many of her poems were made into hymns or otherwise set to music . Among these was " The Lost Chord " , which Arthur Sullivan set to music in 1877 ; this song was the most commercially successful of the 1870s and 1880s in both Britain and the United States . Her work was also published in the United States and translated into German . By 1938 , Procter 's reputation had fallen so far that a textbook could mention her poems only to pronounce them " stupid , trivial and not worthy of the subject " . Critics such as Cheri Larsen <unk> , Kathleen Hickok , and Natalie Joy Woodall argue that the demise of Procter 's reputation is due at least in part to the way Charles Dickens characterized her as a " model middle @-@ class domestic angel " and a " fragile and modest saint " rather than as an " active feminist and strong poet . " Emma Mason argues that although Dickens 's portrayal of Procter " extinguished modern interest " in her , it also " has helped rescue Procter from the kind of endless conjecture about her private life that has confused studies of women like Letitia Landon . " 
 Modern critics have given Procter 's work little attention . The few critics who have examined Procter 's poetry generally find it important for the way that she overtly expresses conventional sentiments while covertly undermining them . According to Isobel Armstrong , Procter 's poetry , like that of many 19th @-@ century women poets , employs conventional ideas and modes of expression without necessarily espousing them in entirety . Francis O 'Gorman cites " A Legend of Provence " as an example of a poem with this kind of " double relationship with the structures of gender politics it seems to affirm . " Other critics since Armstrong agree that Procter 's poetry , while ladylike on the surface , shows signs of repressed emotions and desires . Kirstie Blair states that the suppression of emotion in Procter 's work makes the narrative poems all the more powerful , and Gill Gregory argues that Procter 's poetry often explores female sexuality in an unconventional way , while as often voicing anxiety about sexual desires . Elizabeth Gray criticizes the fact that the few discussions of Procter 's poetry that do exist focus primarily on gender , arguing that the " range and formal inventiveness of this <unk> representative Victorian poet have remained largely unexplored .

He also had 12 assists on his way to a double @-@ double . On December 27 , 2010 , the Big Ten Conference named Morris player of the week . Ann Arbor media felt his omission from the 67 @-@ man 2011 Bob Cousy Award watchlist was a <unk> . Morris repeated as ( co- ) player of the week on January 31 , 2011 sharing the award with Talor Battle , after becoming the third Michigan Wolverines men 's basketball player ( following Gary Grant and Manny Harris ) to record a triple double . On February 1 , 2011 , The Wall Street Journal calculated that Morris was by far the most valuable player to his team among major conference players because his combined assists and field goals account for over 53 % of his team 's points . 
 Morris established a new Michigan single @-@ season assists record during the 2011 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament ( 235 in 35 games ) . The previous highest single @-@ season assists totals in Michigan history were by Gary Grant ( 234 in 34 games , 1987 – 88 ) and Rumeal Robinson ( 233 in 37 games , 1988 – 89 ) .

 ESPN 's Chad Ford described Morris at 6 feet 5 inches ( 1 @.@ 96 m ) as the biggest true point guard in the draft . Morris was selected by his hometown Los Angeles Lakers in the second round of the 2011 NBA Draft with the 41st overall selection . In the week prior to the beginning of the 2011 – 12 NBA season , Morris appeared along with teammates Derek Fisher , Steve Blake and Matt Barnes on the December 22 season 1 finale of The X Factor during a performance by 50 Cent .

When Nash returned to the starting lineup on December 22 , Morris started in place of Metta World Peace , who came off the bench . This was part of a common strategy employed by Lakers head coach Mike D 'Antoni to play players out of position . While a starter , Morris ' responsibility was to defend against the opponents ' most dangerous perimeter player . On January 4 , World Peace returned to the starting lineup in Morris ' place . Then in late January , Jodie Meeks replaced Morris in the rotation as Blake also returned to the rotation . 
 On March 7 , 2013 , Morris was reassigned to the Los Angeles D @-@ Fenders . He played for the D @-@ Fenders on March 9 , scoring 21 points and adding 6 rebounds , 2 assists and a steal .

 Forza Motorsport 4 is a racing video game developed by Turn 10 Studios and published by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox 360 . It is the fourth installment in the Forza series . It is the first title in the series to support the Kinect sensor alongside the traditional controller @-@ based gameplay . It is the last Forza Motorsport released for Xbox 360 ; 2012 's Forza Horizon and its 2014 sequel were the last two Forza games for the platform , while 2013 's Forza Motorsport 5 was released as an Xbox One exclusive . 
 New to the series is the Autovista mode , a mode in which players can view precise details such as engine parts and interior gauges on a select number of cars . It features a partnership with BBC 's Top Gear as well as its American counterpart . Jeremy Clarkson , presenter for Top Gear , provides commentary in the game 's Autovista mode .

These critics did , however , concede that the game was a vast improvement over Forza Motorsport 3 .

 Forza Motorsport 4 is a racing video game , and the fourth in the Forza Motorsport series . Like Sony 's Gran Turismo franchise , Forza games are racing simulations ; heavy emphasis is placed on making the cars drive and look as realistic as possible . Races are conducted on closed circuit tracks . 500 cars are featured in the core game experience , ranging from road cars to race cars . 
 Players can utilize Kinect to look into a corner using a new head tracking feature . This allows them to look toward the apex of a corner or at nearby cars . The controller or steering wheel is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver . Players can also use Kinect as a game controller . In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player 's vehicle utilizing a modified version of the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3 . The steering is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible steering wheel . Kinect will allow the player to use voice commands to start races and navigate menus . 
 New to the Forza series is a feature known as Autovista . It is designed to allow players to walk around and explore inside cars . This feature allows players to view minute details such as brake pads , engine components , and interior details . The player can point at certain features , such as headlights , wheels and the engine for further information about them via audio recording . It can be controlled via Kinect or a game controller . Only 24 cars in the game support the Autovista feature , as it is primarily for sports cars , classic cars , and dream cars . The graphics used to create these cars are formed using image @-@ based lighting which allowed the developers to create perfect reflections , and would better immerse the car in the environment both when racing on a track or in the garage or Top Gear studio when viewing a car . 
 As in Forza Motorsport 3 , there is a career mode for players to complete , which sees players racing at multiple locations around the world . This is known as World Tour Mode in Forza Motorsport 4 , previously known as Season Play in Forza Motorsport 3 . However , one new feature that appears in Forza Motorsport 4 is the game 's ability to adapt the difficulty as the player progresses through the career , and collect a trend of data to see how well they perform . This allows AI drivers to change and upgrade their cars automatically to suit the player 's driving abilities . There are several types of races besides the standard format . Forza Motorsport 4 includes the original bumper @-@ to @-@ bumper races , but also has drift , <unk> , and multiple @-@ heat races . Unlike in Forza Motorsport 3 where players had no choice over which car they received after leveling up , in Forza Motorsport 4 players are now able to choose one out of several cars as a prize , which are automatically upgraded to the high end of their class . Players are able to import their Forza Motorsport 3 profiles into Forza Motorsport 4 . This gives them the ability to transfer a certain amount of in @-@ game credits and gifted cars into their new garage . The amount allowed transferred is based on how long they have played the game and how many cars and credits they have . Players have the option to create car clubs and share cars in their garages within that club . Previous games in the series were limited to eight cars on the track , however Forza Motorsport 4 supports 16 player racing online , and two players offline . 
 Forza Motorsport 4 features 26 courses to compete on . These race courses are mix between circuits courses and point @-@ to @-@ point courses . 17 real @-@ world tracks and nine fictional locations are included . Each course features as reverse configuration , and many have multiple other configurations . Three additional real world race tracks and one fictional track have been added to the Forza franchise , Hockenheimring , Indianapolis Motor Speedway , Infineon Raceway and the fictional Bernese Alps .

 A technology demo for Forza Motorsport 4 was first revealed at Microsoft 's E3 2010 press conference . The live demonstration showcased a passing challenge while driving the 2010 Ferrari 458 Italia . Using the Microsoft Kinect sensor the player steered the car to pass opponents . Forza Motorsport 4 was formally unveiled at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards . Turn 10 announced that the game would feature over 500 cars from 80 manufacturers , and confirmed that it will support Kinect as well as standard Xbox 360 controllers and racing wheels . Turn 10 officially partnered with the American Le Mans Series ( ALMS ) for two years from August 8 , 2011 . The partnership provides several in @-@ game ALMS themed events to complement the cars and tracks raced in the ALMS present in previous entries in the Forza Motorsport series . Unlike past games in the series , vehicles from the SCCA Pro Racing World Challenge were not present initially in Forza Motorsport 4 aside from a Mopar sponsored Dodge Viper . The Porsche download content pack added one World Challenge Porsche <unk> . More known content was leaked during IGN 's visit to E3 2011 , which revealed that there will be the option to create car clubs and share garages within that club , and that the game will support 16 player online racing . Hockenheimring , Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Infineon Raceway were added as three more real world tracks to the Forza series . 
 A Tesla Roadster was used to record the game 's tire sounds . The developers chose the Tesla due to its near @-@ silent electric motor which allowed them to record the sounds cleanly without engine or exhaust noise . Two microphones were mounted to the car and pointed at the tire for recording . Lance Hayes , the award winning composer for Forza Motorsport 3 , returned to score Forza Motorsport 4 , which features a combination of his music and other licensed artists . 15 songs were provided by Hayes for the user interface and some in @-@ race music . In speaking of the tone of the soundtrack , Hayes stated " The score has an increased cinematic feel as well as incorporating many of the styles ( downtempo , electronic , ambient ) that made the Forza Motorsport 3 OST a fan favorite . " 
 On August 26 , 2011 , at PAX Prime it was announced that Turn 10 would include the UNSC Warthog from Microsoft Studios ' Halo series in Forza Motorsport 4 's Autovista mode . The model of Warthog used in Forza Motorsport 4 is identical to the version in the then @-@ upcoming Halo 4 , although the vehicle is not drivable . Turn 10 has cited the vehicle 's exaggerated four wheel steering system , fictional futuristic technology and excessive height as reasons for its exclusion , stating " One , it 's got some technology that 's built into Halo that would have been a big investment for us to then build into the game only to support one vehicle . [ ... ] Technically we don 't support that because no real world cars in our game do . " 
 = = = Top Gear content = = = 
 Turn 10 has entered a multiple year partnership with the BBC 's Top Gear . The content provided by the BBC 's BAFTA award @-@ winning television show Top Gear , also includes narration from presenter Jeremy Clarkson during the virtual showroom ( Autovista ) navigation . The game features the Top Gear test track at Dunsfold Aerodrome , near the village of Cranleigh , UK . The first in @-@ game demo in Autovista was revealed at E3 2011 . An extra piece of content for Top Gear fans is the addition of two of the show 's three reasonably priced cars , the Kia Cee 'd , and the Suzuki Liana , while the TV show 's third such car , the Chevrolet <unk> is not present . At E3 , players were able to complete laps of the Top Gear Test Track and record their own times . The Top Gear test track in Forza Motorsport 4 also features authentic camera angles during replays . The game features Top Gear " Car Football " ( only available online with Xbox Live ) and a Top Gear bowling mini game , both set on the official Top Gear test track . 
 The BBC Top Gear studio is part of the Home Space when viewing a car . The studio has the original TV series cars on plinths , such as the destroyed Toyota Hilux and Clarkson 's Fiat Coupé police car as seen in Series 11 , Episode 1 , and all of the original Top Gear logos , Stig posters , and lighting arrangements , that reflect off the paintwork of the car the player is viewing , similar to how they would on the real Top Gear show . A live action commercial was produced and contained a voice over track by Jeremy Clarkson . The commercial is set in a busy city in which a man merely wants to drive fast . As the man speeds through the city streets with police in pursuit Clarkson speaks of lovers of speed as an endangered species . He notes that places for these people to truly enjoy their cars are being taken away , then pitches the video game . The commercial was well received by the media . Jalopnik 's Ray Wert called the advert " epic " . The driving was performed by professional stunt driver Martin Ivanov . 
 Forza Motorsport 4 was featured in the U.S. version of Top Gear . At the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards professional stunt driver and show co @-@ host Tanner Foust and Rutledge Wood , car expert and co @-@ host were featured in the unveiling of the game . Foust drove a 2010 Dodge Challenger while Wood rode as a passenger . The advertisement showed Foust drifting around the environment and ended with a top @-@ down shot of the pad . On the pavement the word Forza was spelled out in tire marks . Additionally in the final episode of the show 's second season Wood and co @-@ host Adam Ferrara challenged Foust to a timed race at Infineon Raceway , otherwise known as Sears Point ; Foust drove the Lexus LF @-@ A around the real course while Wood and Ferrara drove the course in Forza Motorsport 4 .

 Forza Motorsport 4 has received monthly downloadable content ( DLC ) packs since its release . Each month a number of new cars are bundled into a pack available for purchase . Players can also opt to purchase individual cars from a given pack should they not want all the vehicles presented that month . Players can purchase a Season Pass which entitles them to free downloads of the first six packs . The Top Gear Car Pack DLC was the first of the monthly packs to not be covered by the Season Pass . Unlike previous Forza titles which included Porsche cars through a sublicense from Electronic Arts , Forza Motorsport 4 did not initially include the Porsche marque . Instead , cars from Ruf Automobile , a German car manufacturer which builds their own models from bodies in white received from Porsche , were included . EA 's release of Shift 2 : Unleashed earlier in 2011 was regarded as an expansion into the simulation @-@ racing genre , and brought the Forza series into more direct competition with EA Games . On March 5 , 2012 it was announced there would be a downloadable car pack on May 22 that will feature 30 Porsche cars . The new 2013 SRT Viper GTS was included in Forza Motorsport 4 as free downloadable content on June 22 , 2012 . As a part of the June DLC pack , a 1940 Ford was added . This pack also includes an MG MGA , a Volkswagen Beetle , a BMW 507 , and a Maserati Ghibli . Sometime in late 2015 , all DLC packs were removed without warning , making it so anyone who has yet to purchase said DLC no longer has the chance , restricting the use of over 100 cars . This sparked cries of fury among many fans of the series , yet no plan to re @-@ instate the DLC has been considered , leaving its fate unknown ( although most likely gone ) .

 Super Mario 64 DS ( <unk> , Sūpā Mario Rokujūyon Dī Esu ) is a platform video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld game console . The game was a launch title for the Nintendo DS , released in North America and Japan in 2004 ; it was later released in Europe and Australia in 2005 . 
 Nintendo , who produced the original version of the game , first displayed the game as a multiplayer demonstration at the 2004 E3 titled Super Mario 64 × 4 . In addition to revised graphics , the remake includes new characters , a multiplayer mode , and several minigames independent of the main adventure . As with the original title , the plot of Super Mario 64 DS centers on rescuing Princess Peach from Bowser , with slight changes to accommodate the additional characters . Yoshi is the initial protagonist in this version , with Mario , Luigi , and Wario as unlockable characters . 
 Overall , the game was critically and commercially successful . It won video game awards , and received positive comments from the gaming press , that focused on elements of the single @-@ player mode . The multiplayer mode and lack of analog controls used in Super Mario 64 were common complaints among reviewers . The game sold well in territories , was ranked on best @-@ selling lists , and , as of September 30 , 2015 , has sold 11 @.@ 06 million copies worldwide . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The game begins with Mario receiving a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him . Mario arrives at Peach 's castle , along with Luigi and Wario . The trio disappear as they enter the castle , and Lakitu , the game 's camera operator , informs Yoshi of the disappearance . Yoshi explores Peach 's castle to find Mario , Luigi , Wario and Peach . 
 Scattered throughout the castle are paintings and secret walls , which act as portals to other worlds where Bowser and his minions guard the Power Stars . After recovering most of the power stars and defeating Bowser 's minions , Yoshi acquires keys that access other areas of the castle , where he finds Mario and his friends captured . 
 First , Yoshi defeats <unk> and frees Mario as they continue searching the castle to find more Power Stars . Second , Mario defeats King Boo and frees Luigi who uses " invisibility power " to get Wario 's key . Third , Luigi defeats Chief Chilly and frees Wario using the key . Mario and his friends then tackle three obstacle courses , with each ensuing a battle with Bowser . After defeating him twice , they received a key that opens even more levels of the castle . 
 After collecting 150 power stars , Mario and his friends reach the highest area of the castle , where they ensue a final battle against Bowser . Eventually , after Bowser 's defeat , Mario and his friends return to Peach 's castle , where they free Peach from a stained @-@ glass window above the entrance . As a reward for saving Peach , she kisses Mario on the nose and bakes the cake she had promised . The game ends when Mario , Luigi , Peach , Yoshi and Wario wave goodbye to the player as Lakitu films and then flies away . A photo with Peach 's cake then appears .

 Super Mario 64 DS is a 3D platformer in which the player controls four different characters through numerous levels to collect 150 Power Stars , 30 more than the original game . Each level is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits . The worlds are inhabited with enemies that attack the characters as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance , offer information , or ask for help . The player gathers stars in each course ; some stars only appear after completing certain tasks , often hinted at by the name of the course . These challenges include defeating a boss , solving puzzles , racing an opponent , and gathering coins . As the player collects stars , more areas of the castle become accessible . 
 Power @-@ ups in Super Mario 64 DS take the form of special hats resembling those worn by Mario , Luigi , and Wario ( voiced by Charles Martinet ) , and are available in some levels . Acquiring one such hat will change the player 's character into the corresponding character . The hats fall off if the character is hit , but can be reacquired . Yoshi is able to start a level wearing the hat of any of the available characters . Another power @-@ up item , the " Power Flower " , provides each character with a different ability : Mario is able to float , similar to Super Mario World 's balloon item ; Luigi becomes invisible and transparent , similar to the invisible hat in the Nintendo 64 version ; Wario becomes coated by metal , which makes him temporarily invincible to enemy attacks and sink underwater , similar to the metal hat in the original version ; and Yoshi is able to breathe fire . Each ability is necessary to complete specific areas in the game . Other items include the " Super Mushroom " , which increases the character 's size and strength , and the feather , that only Mario can get , and which allows the character to fly in the same fashion as in Super Mario 64 . However , in multiplayer VS . Mode , other characters can get wings , in Yoshi 's case , he grows wings out of his body like in Super Mario World . 
 The game uses both of the system 's screens to offer new options . The top screen displays the normal gameplay , while the bottom touchscreen can function as an overhead map and touch controls . The overhead map displays the current course the player traverses and displays item locations . The touch controls include virtual buttons , which rotate the top screen 's camera angle , and directional character controls , which can operate with either the DS stylus or the player 's thumb using the DS wrist strap . In addition to the single @-@ player adventure , the game includes 36 minigames and a multiplayer mode . Minigames are made accessible by catching rabbits in the main game . All minigames use the touchscreen to play , and are based on different themes : racing , card games , puzzles , and so forth . The multiplayer mode uses the wireless DS Download Play where up to four players compete against each other using Green , Red , Blue , and Yellow Yoshi ( voiced by Kazumi Totaka ) — character hats appear in the stage allowing players to transform into either Mario , Luigi , or Wario . Wario can stun opponents by picking them up , swinging them , and throwing them . 
 = = Development = = 
 Super Mario 64 DS was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS . It is a remake of the Nintendo 64 launch title Super Mario 64 , with the game 's 3D engine mirroring many visual effects used in the original game . Graphical changes include a higher polygon count for character models and the lack of texture filtering . Originally titled " Super Mario 64 × 4 " , it was first shown as a multiplayer demonstration at the 2004 E3 before the Nintendo DS was released . A few months later , Nintendo announced an actual game — along with many others — was in development . At the Nintendo DS conference on October 7 , 2004 , the game was on demonstration again and new information was revealed ; the name was changed to Super Mario 64 DS and four different characters ( Mario , Luigi , Yoshi , and Wario ) would be used in the main , single @-@ player adventure . The demonstration was a more complete version of the game than the E3 version — the game 's development was 90 % complete at this time — and highlighted the multiple characters in the single @-@ player mode and included minigames ; the multiplayer mode , however , was not present . Prior to the conference , the appearance of the box art on GameStop 's product page caused speculation the game would be a launch title . Nintendo confirmed the rumor by announcing at the conference that the game would be a launch title of the Nintendo DS in North America and Japan . As the game 's release approached , the release schedule of launch titles altered ; many titles were delayed , while others were announced to be released a few days before the Nintendo DS . Super Mario 64 DS was the only game scheduled to be released with the system . Koji Kondo provided the music for the game , while the voice actors from Super Mario 64 returned as well and this time , Kazumi Totaka joined the cast , playing the role of Yoshi .

 The game has won awards and met with overall positive reviews from video game journalists . Upon its release , IGN labeled it as an " Editor 's Choice " and awarded it " Game of the Month " for the Nintendo DS , citing the game as a " great achievement " of the system 's capability . In 2005 , the game won a Golden Joystick Award for best handheld game of year . Prior to the game 's release , Craig Harris of IGN reviewed the early demonstration . He commented on the accurate recreation of the original graphics , and stated that the small Nintendo DS screen helps hide any visual flaws . Harris criticized the game 's controls calling them a little " sluggish " and " clumsy " . Though he praised the graphics and new gameplay additions , Harris expressed disappointment that the Mario launch title for the new system was a remake instead of a full game . IGN 's Anoop Gantayat anticipated the game would be a big hit among American video game enthusiasts . In Japan , Famitsu ranked Super Mario 64 DS the 29th most wanted title . 
 Reviewers praised the game 's accurate recreation of the Nintendo 64 title , additional features , and upgrades . Phil Theobald of GameSpy lauded Super Mario 64 DS , calling it " fantastic " and complimenting the new features : minigames , use of a second screen , and extra stars . He also commented that the gameplay of the original game holds up ten years after its original release . Harris said the original feel of Super Mario 64 is retained , while the new challenges and features build upon it in a way that added to the game 's longevity . He complimented the graphics and audio , and considered the game a good demonstration of the Nintendo DS 's capabilities . Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot also complimented the graphics , specifically the higher polygon count and smooth frame rate . He called Super Mario 64 DS a " great update of a classic game " , and felt the changes and additional features offered a new experience to fans of the original . In contrast , 1UP.com 's Jeremy Parish felt the game did not offer enough new content to warrant a purchase . He praised the inclusion of extra characters , calling them a " nice twist " , but concluded his review by calling the game a " poorly @-@ conceived port " that should be played on the original system . 
 Other criticism focused on the game 's controls and multiplayer mode . Theobald felt the lack of an analog stick made the controls more difficult than the original game and required a short period of adjustment . He further stated that the digital pad and touchscreen 's virtual analog control were " tricky " and required practice . Harris echoed similar comments and noted the touchscreen does not provide physical feedback like an analog stick . He added the game was never intended to be played without proper analog controls . Gerstmann referred to the multiplayer mode as " uneventful " and considered it lacking longevity , but commented that it was a good extra that demonstrated the system 's wireless multiplayer capabilities . Theobald agreed it was a nice addition , but considered it a " diversion " that players would tire of quickly .

 Apogee Stadium is a college football stadium located at the junction of Interstate 35 East and West in Denton , Texas . Opened in 2011 , it is home to the University of North Texas ( UNT ) Mean Green football team , which competes in Conference USA . The facility replaced Fouts Field , where the school 's football program had been based since 1952 . 
 The stadium was proposed by the University of North Texas System Board of Regents after the 2002 New Orleans Bowl . Designed by HKS , Inc . , it was constructed at a cost of $ 78 million after a contentious student body election in 2008 . It was originally named " Mean Green Stadium " , but was renamed when ResNet provider Apogee purchased the naming rights in 2011 . The stadium hosted its first major event on September 10 , 2011 when the Mean Green lost 48 – 23 against the University of Houston Cougars . That game 's attendance of 28 @,@ 075 holds the record for the stadium ; the Mean Green have never sold out a home game in their five seasons at the venue . Official home attendance figures for the team 's first five seasons at Apogee Stadium averaged around 18 @,@ 492 per game , which is slightly under 60 % of its capacity of 30 @,@ 850 . 
 The facility includes various amenities , including a press box , luxury boxes , and an alumni pavilion . It also uses environmental technology ; it is the first newly built stadium to achieve Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ( LEED ) Platinum certification . It can be reached by road , but because of limited parking and traffic congestion on game days , many attendees park on the northeast side of Interstate 35E and cross a pedestrian bridge to reach the stadium . Others use public transportation to reach the facility on game days .

 In September 2002 , the University of North Texas purchased 19 acres ( 7 @.@ 7 ha ) on the opposite side of Interstate 35 from the main campus in Denton , Texas from Liberty Christian School for $ 5 @.@ 1 million . The university also owned an adjacent 158 @-@ acre ( 64 ha ) golf course . Following the football team 's victory at the 2002 New Orleans Bowl , school administrators announced their intent to build an assortment of new athletic facilities on the properties , now called the Mean Green Village . These plans included a new football stadium to replace Fouts Field , where the school 's football team had been based since 1952 . Richard <unk> , vice chancellor of administrative affairs at UNT , stated that that the project 's primary objective was the consolidation of academic facilities and that renovating Fouts Field would cost $ 8 million more than building an entirely new stadium . 
 The University of North Texas System Board of Regents released a long @-@ term campus master plan in 2005 that included a proposed new stadium with a capacity of 35 @,@ 000 and an estimated cost " in excess of $ 35 million " . UNT athletic director Rick Villareal stated that the university would use only private fundraising , rather than another increase in students ' fees , to pay for any new facilities , including a stadium . He projected that the new stadium would cost $ 40 million and seat 50 @,@ 000 spectators . The athletic department changed that capacity estimate in 2007 to 32 @,@ 000 with the possibility of later expansion to 50 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Athletics fee referendum = = = 
 In 2008 , the athletic department tried again to increase the athletics fee to pay for the new stadium , which now had an estimated cost of $ 60 million . UNT Student Government Association ( SGA ) student senators voted to hold a student election on the referendum to approve the new fee , which amounted to a net increase of $ 7 per credit hour for each student , or approximately $ 840 per student over the course of four years . According to state law , students cannot pay for more than half the cost of a stadium . 
 The athletic department made a concerted effort to promote the higher fee to students , and supporters suggested hiring street preachers or troubadours to promote the election . Making the case for the fee prior to the election , athletic director Rick Villareal said that the stadium was " not some arms race for us " and that the fee 's objective was not just to keep up with other universities . 
 The referendum was held between October 13 – 17 , 2008 . Students voted for or against the proposal : 
 In order for the University of North Texas to have a better Athletic program , which in turn can lead to national exposure and increased recognition of UNT ; I agree to a dedicated Athletic Fee not to exceed $ 10 per semester credit hour , capped at 15 hours . Once the Athletic Fee is implemented , the Student Service Fee will be reduced by $ 3 per semester credit hour . The Athletic Fee shall not be implemented until the semester the new football stadium is complete , which is expected to be fall 2011 . 
 On October 21 , 2008 , the UNT SGA announced that in one of the largest turnouts in the school 's history , student voters approved a dedicated athletic fee to fund the new stadium . Almost 14 % of the student body voted , with 2 @,@ 829 students ( 58 @.@ 1 % ) voting for the increase and 2 @,@ 038 ( 41 @.@ 9 % ) voting against it . After the election , the cost estimate for the stadium 's construction increased by $ 18 million to $ 78 million , $ 38 million more than the 2005 estimate . At a press conference with head football coach Todd Dodge , Villarreal stated that " there 's an arms race going on with facilities . This one will put us up there with everybody else . " In February 2009 , the school 's chapter of Students for a Democratic Society unsuccessfully attempted to petition for a re @-@ vote on the referendum . 
 Following the election , Representative Myra Crownover and Senator Craig Estes submitted companion bills during the eighty @-@ first Texas Legislature to approve the fee increase . According to the report submitted by Crownover to the state 's Higher Education Committee , the fee would not begin until construction of the new stadium was complete . As a result of the fee , the athletics department would collect approximately $ 8 @.@ 7 million from students in 2012 , of which $ 3 @.@ 9 million would be put towards payment of the new stadium . Estes ' bill was approved by the Texas House and Senate , and was signed into law by Governor Rick Perry on May 23 , 2009 . Prior to the groundbreaking ceremony on November 21 , 2009 , President of UNT Gretchen Bataille said that of the approximately $ 78 million needed to pay for the new stadium , the department had raised $ 5 million . In 2015 , the eighty @-@ fourth Texas Legislature passed a bill allowing the Board of Regents to raise the fee by up to 10 % each year beyond the original limit of $ 10 . In September 2015 , the Board of Regents approved an increase in the fee , raising it to $ 11 per credit hour .

 In 2008 , president of UNT Gretchen Bataille signed the American College and University President 's Climate Commitment ( <unk> ) to achieve carbon neutrality by 2040 . As part of that process , all new university buildings and facilities are required to achieve a minimum of Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ( LEED ) Silver certification . While planning the stadium 's construction , the university consulted HKS , Inc. to design it to meet a number of green building standards and hired <unk> , an environmental graphic design firm , to design many of the stadium 's graphic elements . As a result , Apogee Stadium uses various forms of environmental technology . To reduce water consumption and urban runoff , the facility includes a 85 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 7 @,@ 900 m2 ) water retention system , 338 @,@ 000 square feet ( 31 @,@ 400 m2 ) of permeable paving , and low @-@ flow plumbing systems . To minimize the human impact on the environment , developers took advantage of the landscape around the stadium whenever possible . 
 The facility also includes three Northern Power Systems 100 wind turbines , which were installed in February 2012 . To fund the turbine project , the Texas State Energy Conservation Office allocated $ 2 million in federal stimulus funds to the university . The 120 @-@ foot ( 37 m ) turbines each have three 30 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) blades and are expected to produce a combined 450 @,@ 000 kilowatt @-@ hours ( 1 @,@ 600 GJ ) of energy per year , which would account for roughly six percent of the athletics department 's power grid in the area . The turbines are also expected to offset 323 metric tons ( 323 @,@ 000 kg ) of carbon dioxide emissions . 
 The stadium 's sustainable design features have earned praise and awards from media outlets and industry groups . In 2011 , Apogee Stadium became the first newly built stadium to achieve LEED Platinum certification , the highest level awarded by the U.S. Green Building Council . The points @-@ based ratings system measures various environmental aspects including water efficiency , energy conservation , indoor air quality , and sustainability .

 Apogee Stadium is located on Bonnie Brae Street at the junction of Interstate 35 East and West in the southeast part of Denton , Texas . It is part of the Mean Green Village , a 175 @-@ acre ( 71 ha ) parcel of land located south of UNT 's main campus that includes various athletic department facilities . In February 2003 , the school conducted studies to identify potential traffic problems in the area . The results of the studies indicated that the intersection of Bonnie Brae Street and Airport Road northwest of the facility represented a potential major traffic hazard , since the two @-@ lane Bonnie Brae Street could not accommodate the additional game day traffic , and Airport Road would be needed for access to Denton Municipal Airport to the north . Initially , university officials planned to address some concerns by rerouting season ticket holders through the surrounding neighborhoods , but in 2009 , residents expressed concerns that the stadium could clog traffic systems in the area . Consequently , the City of Denton passed an ordinance to shut down the area streets on game days to anyone without a resident 's permit . The university began the process of transferring the right @-@ of @-@ way surrounding Bonnie Brae Street to the city in 2012 to allow for the road 's expansion from two lanes to four . The project is expected to improve the region 's transportation system between Interstate 35 East and U.S. Route 377 to the south . 
 To encourage the use of sustainable transportation , developers limited the quantity of parking spaces on site . The facility includes 1 @,@ 758 parking spaces adjacent to the stadium , but to access it on the day of an event , most attendees park at Fouts Field on the opposite side of Interstate 35E and walk across a pedestrian bridge , which leads to the stadium . The university announced plans to build the bridge in August 2011 to address another area of the concern from the 2002 studies . Construction on the $ 2 @.@ 5 million project , a joint venture between the university and the Texas Department of Transportation , began in February 2012 . Although originally expected to open for the football team 's first home game of the 2012 season , construction delays moved the opening date to October 16 for the third home game of the season . 
 In June 2016 , the Fort Worth Transportation Authority announced its intent to begin operating a commuter bus service on weekdays from Fort Worth Intermodal Transportation Center to the stadium parking lot . The Denton County Transportation Authority ( DCTA ) is expected to review the proposal on August 22 , 2016 . On game days , UNT football game attendees can also take the DCTA A @-@ train to the <unk> Brock Downtown Denton Transit Center and take a shuttle to Fouts Field , where they can walk to the stadium . Beginning two hours prior to the beginning of each game and ending one hour after the game is over , the Mean Green Game Day shuttle also stops at various locations in Denton , including the Denton County Courthouse @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Square and the southeast corner of the university . In September 2013 , the school announced a partnership with DCTA to provide free trips on the A @-@ train and shuttle rides to the stadium for football game attendees wearing UNT apparel . 
 = 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania = 
 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania was an oral ultimatum presented to Juozas Urbšys , Foreign Minister of Lithuania , by Joachim von Ribbentrop , Foreign Minister of Nazi Germany , on 20 March 1939 . The Germans demanded that Lithuania give up the Klaipėda Region ( also known as the Memel Territory ) , which had been detached from Germany after World War I , or the Wehrmacht would invade Lithuania . After years of rising tension between Lithuania and Germany , increasing pro @-@ Nazi propaganda in the region , and continued German expansion , the demand was expected . The ultimatum was issued just five days after the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia . The four signatories of the 1924 Klaipėda Convention , which had guaranteed the protection of the status quo in the region , did not offer any material assistance . The United Kingdom and France followed a policy of appeasement , while Italy and Japan openly supported Germany . Lithuania was forced to accept the ultimatum on 22 March . For Germany it was the last territorial acquisition before World War II ; for Lithuania it was a major downturn in economy and morale ; for Europe it was further escalation in pre @-@ war tensions . 
 = = Klaipėda dispute = = 
 Klaipėda ( German : Memel ) , an important seaport in East Prussia , was detached from Germany by Article 28 of the Treaty of Versailles and was governed by the Allies according to Article 99 . France assumed administration of the region while Lithuania continued to lobby for its control , claiming that it should belong to Lithuania as it had a significant Lithuanian population ( see Lithuania Minor ) and was that country 's only access to the Baltic Sea . Poland also laid claim to the territory . As the Allies were hesitant to make a decision and it seemed that the region would remain a free state much like the Free City of Danzig , Lithuania took the initiative and organized the Klaipėda Revolt in January 1923 . Soviet Russia and Germany supported the action . The region , as an autonomous territory with its own parliament ( Klaipėda Parliament ) , was attached to Lithuania . The region covered about 2 @,@ 400 km ² and had a population of approximately 140 @,@ 000 . 
 During the 1920s , Lithuania and Germany maintained a relatively normal relationship as they were united by anti @-@ Polish sentiment . In January 1928 , after long and difficult negotiations , Germany and Lithuania signed a border treaty , which left Klaipėda on the Lithuanian side . However , tensions began rising in the 1930s after the Weimar Republic was replaced with Nazi Germany . An especially tense period came in February 1934 when the Lithuanian government arrested dozens of pro @-@ Nazi activists . In response to these arrests and trials , Germany declared a boycott of Lithuanian agricultural imports . The boycott caused an economic crisis in <unk> ( southern Lithuania ) , where farmers organized violent protests . However , after the plebiscite in Saar most of the pro @-@ Nazi prisoners received amnesty . In the wake of the amnesties , Lithuanian prestige suffered both abroad and in Klaipėda , allowing Germany to strengthen its influence in the region . 
 = = Rising tension = = 
 In the spring of 1938 Adolf Hitler personally stated that gaining Klaipėda was one of his highest priorities , second only to gaining the Sudetenland . When Poland presented its ultimatum to Lithuania in March 1938 , Germany openly declared that in the event of a military clash between Poland and Lithuania , its army would invade Lithuania to capture Klaipėda and a large portion of western Lithuania . A week after Lithuania accepted the Polish ultimatum , Germany presented an eleven @-@ point memorandum that demanded freedom of action for pro @-@ German activists in the region and a lessening of Lithuanian influence there . Its points were worded in a deliberately vague manner , which would enable Germany to accuse Lithuania of violations . Lithuania chose to postpone dealing with the problem , hoping that the international situation would improve . In the meantime it hoped to give the German population no reasons for complaint . 
 This tactic did not prove successful : pro @-@ Nazi propaganda and protests were rampant , even among the Lithuanian population , and the local government was powerless to prevent them . The Nazis physically harassed Lithuanian organizations . On 1 November 1938 Lithuania was pressured into lifting martial law and press censorship . During the December elections to the Klaipėda Parliament , pro @-@ German parties received 87 % of votes ( 25 seats out of 29 ) in the Klaipėda territory . Dr. Ernst Neumann , the chief defendant in the 1934 trials , was released from prison in February 1938 and became the leader of Klaipėda 's pro @-@ German movement . In December he was received by Adolf Hitler , who assured him that the Klaipėda issue would be resolved by March or April 1939 . Neumann and other Nazi activists claimed the right of self @-@ determination for the region and demanded that Lithuania open negotiations over the political status of Klaipėda . The parliament was expected to vote for a return to Germany when it convened on 25 March 1939 . Germany 's official channels maintained silence on the issue . Germany hoped that Lithuania would voluntarily give up the troubled region , and a public stance could have disturbed the sensitive discussions it was then engaged in with Poland over an anti @-@ Communist alliance against the Soviet Union . 
 = = The ultimatum = = 
 Rumors had reached the Lithuanian government to the effect that Germany had specific plans to take over Klaipėda . On 12 March Foreign Minister Urbšys represented Lithuania at the coronation of Pope Pius XII in Rome . On his return to Lithuania he stopped in Berlin with the hope of clarifying the growing rumors . On 20 March Ribbentrop agreed to meet with Urbšys , but not with Kazys Škirpa , who was asked to wait in another room . The conversation lasted for about 40 minutes . Ribbentrop demanded the return of Klaipėda to Germany and threatened military action . Urbšys relayed the verbal ultimatum to the Lithuanian government . Because the ultimatum was never set down in writing and did not include a formal deadline , some historians have downplayed its import , describing it as a " set of demands " rather than as an ultimatum . However , it was made clear that force would be used should Lithuania resist , and it was warned not to seek help from other nations . While a clear deadline was not given , Lithuania was told to make a speedy decision and that any clashes or German casualties would inevitably provoke a response from the German military . 
 Lithuania secretly informed the signatories of the Klaipėda Convention about these demands , since technically Lithuania could not transfer Klaipėda without the approval of the signatories . Italy and Japan supported Germany in the matter , while the United Kingdom and France expressed sympathy for Lithuania but chose not to offer any material assistance . They followed a well @-@ publicized policy of appeasing Hitler . The UK treated the issue in the same way as it had treated the Sudeten Crisis and made no plans to assist Lithuania or the other Baltic States if they were attacked by Germany . The Soviet Union , while supporting Lithuania in principle , did not wish to disrupt its relations with Germany at that point , since it was contemplating an alliance with the Nazis . Without any material international support Lithuania had no choice but to accept the ultimatum . Lithuanian diplomacy characterized the concession as a " necessary evil " that would enable Lithuania to preserve its independence and maintained the hope that it was merely a temporary retreat . 
 = = Acceptance = = 
 At 1 : 00 am on 23 March Urbšys and Ribbentrop signed a treaty , effective 22 March , stating that Lithuania was voluntarily transferring the Klaipėda Region to Germany . The treaty comprised five articles : 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Before the treaty was signed , German soldiers had already entered the port of Klaipėda . Adolf Hitler , on board the cruiser Deutschland , personally toured the city and gave a short speech . The armada sailing to Klaipėda included the cruiser Admiral Graf Spee , the light cruisers Nürnberg , Leipzig , and Köln , two destroyer squadrons , three torpedo boat flotillas , and one tender flotilla . At the time the Lithuanian navy had only one warship , the <unk> Smetona , a 580 @-@ ton converted minesweeper . While the Germans were celebrating the return of the city , European politicians expressed fears that the Free City of Danzig would be Hitler 's next target . 
 President Antanas Smetona 's unconditional acceptance of a second ultimatum in the space of a little over one year became a major source of dissatisfaction with his authoritarian rule . The German ultimatum triggered a political crisis : the passive cabinet of Vladas Mironas was replaced by a cabinet headed by General Jonas <unk> . For the first time since the 1926 coup d 'état , the government included members of the opposition : <unk> <unk> , of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party , was named Minister of Education and Jurgis <unk> , of the Lithuanian Popular Peasants ' Union , was named Minister of Agriculture . Because other parties were banned , <unk> and <unk> were officially billed as independent private citizens . Four generals were now members of the cabinet as well . However , even the looming international crisis did not induce Lithuanian politicians to unite , and they continued to engage in petty political disputes . 
 The loss of its only access to the Baltic Sea was a major blow to the Lithuanian economy . Between 70 % and 80 % of foreign trade passed through Klaipėda . The region , which represented only about 5 % of Lithuania 's territory , contained a third of its industry . Lithuania also lost its heavy investments in the port 's infrastructure . About 10 @,@ 000 refugees , mostly Jews , left the region and sought shelter and support from the Lithuanian government . Lithuanians doubted the fate of their country : in March – April withdrawals of deposits in banks and credit institutions totaled almost 20 % of total deposits . After the loss of Klaipėda , Lithuania drifted into the German sphere of influence , especially in terms of trade . At the end of 1939 , Germany accounted for 75 % of Lithuanian exports and for 86 % of its imports . Germany and the Soviet Union concluded the Molotov – Ribbentrop Pact in 1939 , dividing Eastern Europe into their respective spheres of influence . Not surprisingly , Lithuania was , at first , assigned to Germany . The Nazis went so far as to suggest a German – Lithuanian military alliance against Poland and promised to return the Vilnius Region , but Lithuania held to its policy of strict neutrality . 
 = Neil Brooks = 
 Neil Brooks ( born 27 July 1962 ) is an Australian former sprint freestyle swimmer best known for winning the 4 × 100 m medley relay at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow as part of the Quietly Confident Quartet . Brooks was as much known for his swimming achievements as he was for disciplinary incidents . He often found himself in conflict with officialdom and threatened with sanctions . His international career ended when he was suspended for drinking 46 cans of beer on the return flight to Australia after the 1986 Commonwealth Games . In retirement , he became a news presenter and sports commentator , but was fired amid alcohol problems . 
 Born in England , Brooks emigrated to Australia as a toddler and started swimming lessons after nearly drowning in a childhood accident . After initially being known for his lack of technique , Brooks quickly rose through the youth ranks . Brooks made his debut at the Australian Championships in 1976 , but it was not until 1979 that he medalled at national level and made his debut for Australia at a FINA ( Fédération Internationale de Natation ) Swimming World Cup meet . In 1980 , he gained prominence by breaking the Australian record in the 100 m freestyle and being invited to a national team camp . There he had his first clash with officialdom , walking out after accusing the officials of neglecting him . He then qualified for the Australian team for the 1980 Moscow Olympics , defying political pressure to boycott the Games in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . Arriving in Moscow , Brooks ' experience in the 100 m freestyle was an unpleasant one , suffering an asthma attack and missing the final . The peak of his swimming career came in the 4 × 100 m medley relay , when he caught and passed the Soviet Union 's Sergey Kopliakov during the anchor leg to seal a narrow victory for Australia . This victory remains the only time that the United States did not win the event at Olympic level . 
 Following the Olympics , Brooks was expelled from the Australian Institute of Sport by Don Talbot for disciplinary reasons . He accepted a swimming scholarship at the University of Arkansas , where he enjoyed the more liberal disciplinary standards . He returned to Australia for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane and again raised the ire of officials during a preparatory training camp . After lobbying for improved accommodation conditions , Brooks was involved in a physical altercation with the team manager . As a result , he was given a suspension that was to take effect after the Commonwealth Games . However , his teammates protested and threatened to walk out , resulting in the ban being rescinded . Despite the turbulent preparation , Brooks had a successful meet , winning the 100 m freestyle and anchoring the 4 × 100 m freestyle and medley relays to gold medals . Brooks competed at his second Olympics in Los Angeles in 1984 Games , where he won silver in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay and bronze for swimming the heats of the medley relay . Brooks ' international career ended at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh with silver in the 100 m freestyle and gold in the freestyle relay . Brooks retired after being suspended for his drinking binge during the return trip . He later became a swimming commentator but was sacked in 1998 after a disciplinary incident . 
 = = Early years = = 
 An only child , Brooks was born in Crewe , England , before migrating to Western Australia when he was four , along with his working @-@ class parents Mick and Norah . His first aquatic adventure was almost his last . Aged seven , he was playing with a friend on the shore of the Swan River when they climbed into a boat that drifted deeper into water and overturned . Brooks was forced to cling to the boat as his friend swam ashore to seek help . His parents immediately enrolled him in swimming lessons at the <unk> Swim Club . Shortly after , he switched to the tutelage of Kevin Duff , who coached him for the next fifteen years . After just six weeks under Duff , Brooks came third in the 50 m breaststroke at the State Age Championships . Despite coaching the likes of Olympic medallists Kevin O 'Halloran , Lyn <unk> , David Dickson and Lynne Watson , Duff was virtually unknown outside Western Australia . Brooks was known for his rebellious nature , and had a glowing assessment of his coach , opining that " He 's not pushy like many other Australian coaches and he 's not in the politics of Australian swimming " . 
 Brooks attended Hale Primary School and trained at Beatty Park Pool , routinely dominating the State Age Championships . He won bronze in the 100 m and 200 m backstroke , and silver in the 200 m freestyle at the 1974 Australian Age Championships . Owing to a lack of style , he was known during his primary school years as " Basher Brooks " , but by the time he entered Churchlands Senior High School , his stroke had become more technically refined . Nevertheless , he was always confident in his mental ability , stating " before I just swam on guts , now I had the stroke as well as the guts . I was always the toughest kid in the race . " 
 At the age of 13 , Brooks suffered a loss of confidence . After being champion in all four strokes for the previous four years , he was now frequently losing . The other children had grown more at the start of their adolescence and he was struggling to match them . Within a year , Brooks ' physical growth began to catch up and he started to regain the dominant position . He also switched from distance to sprint events . 
 = = National debut = = 
 In 1976 , at the age of 13 , Brooks competed at his first open Australian Championships , but did not gain any podium finishes and as such missed selection in the team for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal . In the same year , the Australian team came to Perth for its pre @-@ Olympic training camp and were billeted in the homes of members of the local swimming community . Brooks ' family took his future relay team @-@ mate Mark Tonelli , who had a reputation for indiscipline . Brooks , however , was inspired by Tonelli and cited him as a key motivating factor in him wanting to become an Olympian . 
 During the 1976 – 77 season , Brooks came to prominence as a possible Australian representative sprinter . He broke six records in winning two events at the 1977 Western Australian Championships . He swam the 100 m freestyle in 56 @.@ 56 s , breaking the state records for 14- , 15- , and 16 @-@ year @-@ olds , before repeating the achievement in the 200 m backstroke . Still aged 14 , he competed at his second Australian Championships and came fourth in the 100 m freestyle . In 1978 , he came third in the 100 m freestyle and missed selection for the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton , Canada by 0 @.@ 03 s . He spent the rest of the year training and studying accounting at Leederville Technical College . During the year , Brooks set Australian age group records in the 200 m individual medley , the 200 m backstroke and the 100 m freestyle . At the inaugural Australian Short Course Championships in Launceston , Tasmania in 1979 , he won silver in the 200 m individual medley and bronze in the 100 m freestyle . His performances earned him selection in the Australian team for the first time , competing in the FINA Swimming World Cup event in Tokyo in April 1979 , aged 16 years and nine months . 
 Aged 17 , Brooks swam 51 @.@ 91 s in Perth in January 1980 , breaking Tonelli 's Australian record in the 100 m freestyle . As a result , he was invited to his first national training camp under Bill Sweetenham for prospective Olympic swimmers . He had the first of his many clashes with sporting administrators , first claiming that the officials did not want him to board with Tonelli 's family and then stating that Sweetenham had only coached him two or three times , which he felt was insufficient . Brooks walked out of the camp and returned to Perth to train under Duff . At the Australian Championships , the 100 m was seen as a clash between Tonelli and Brooks . The latter came second in the 100 m freestyle , outsprinted in the dying stages by Tonelli , who reclaimed his national record in a time of 51 @.@ 80 s . As a result , Brooks was selected in both the individual event and the 4 × 100 m medley relay . 
 However , another obstacle arose with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , which resulted in a boycott of the Games by a large part of the Western World , led by the United States . The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee , and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games . Tonelli , however , realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated . He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete . 
 = = Moscow Olympics = = 
 The 4 × 100 m medley relay was the focal point of Brooks ' Moscow campaign and it came only two days before his 18th birthday . The event had always been won by the United States since its inception at Olympic level in 1960 , and their boycott had opened up the field in the event . In the five times the event had been contested , Australia 's best result was a silver in the inaugural race . A bronze in 1964 was the only other medal success and the 1976 edition of the medley relay had seen Australia eliminated in the heats . This time , Australia were regarded as a medal chance , but were not seen as the main threats ; Sweden , Great Britain and the Soviet Union were the most heavily fancied teams . The hosts boasted the silver medallists in the 100 m backstroke and breaststroke , and their butterflyer had come fifth ; their freestyler would place fourth a few days later . The British had Duncan Goodhew , the breaststroke gold medallist , while Sweden 's butterflyer and backstroker had won their respective events and their freestyle swimmer would come second in the 100 m . On paper , Australia 's team paled in comparison . Peter Evans was the only individual medallist over a 100 m race , claiming bronze in the breaststroke . Mark Kerry had been eliminated in the backstroke semifinals , while Tonelli was swimming as a makeshift butterflyer , despite having performed better than Kerry in the 100 m backstroke . Adding to the pressure was the fact that Australia won no gold medals at the 1976 Olympics in any sport , and were yet to win in Moscow , so the public were still awaiting their first victory since Munich in 1972 . Coming into the Olympics , Australia were ranked seventh out of the thirteen competing countries . Australia 's prospects improved after the morning heats in which Sweden was disqualified . Tonelli , the eldest swimmer in the quartet at the age of 23 , convened the team as its de facto leader . He asked his team @-@ mates to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time ; Kerry vowed to swim the backstroke in 57 s , Evans the breaststroke in 63 s flat , Tonelli the butterfly in 54 s and Brooks promised to anchor the team in 49 @.@ 8 s , even though he had never gone faster than 51 s . Tonelli named the foursome as the Quietly Confident Quartet , and they exhibited a quiet confidence as they lined up for the race . 
 Kerry led off in a faster time than he had clocked in the individual event , but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57 @.@ 87 s . This left Australia in fourth place at the end of the first leg . Evans then swam a personal best of 63 @.@ 01 s , leaving the team almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark . Tonelli then swam his leg in 54 @.@ 94 s , almost two seconds faster than his previous best . He did so with an uneven arm technique due to the disparity in the strength of his arms . He began to lose ground in the last 50 m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre of the lead by the end of his leg . Brooks then made a powerful , well @-@ timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart . At the halfway mark , he had drawn level and made a superior turn to take the lead . The Soviet freestyler Kopliakov pulled level at the 25 m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0 @.@ 22 s . He did not breathe in the last ten metres , and claimed to be laughing for the final five metres , confident that his opponent could not pass him . The Australian freestyler had finished his leg in 49 @.@ 86 s as he had vowed to his team mates . The time of 3 m 45 @.@ 70 s sealed Australia 's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics , for men or women . Brooks dedicated the team 's win to his mother , who had died from cancer the previous Christmas . Upon returning to Australia , he was greeted as a hero , but he considered retiring due to waning desire for success after his triumph in Moscow . In 2000 , Brooks and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the Australian Sports Medal for their victory in Moscow . 
 In the individual event , which occurred after the relay , Brooks had come equal first in his heat with eventual bronze medallist Per Johansson from Sweden in a time of 52 @.@ 11 s . This made him the seventh fastest qualifier for the semi @-@ finals , but he suffered a severe asthma attack and had to be hospitalised . He swam the semi @-@ final regardless , despite having a heart @-@ rate before the start of race of 120 , compared to his usual 72 . He finished seventh in a time of 52 @.@ 70 s , which saw him place 14th , missing the final by 0 @.@ 83 s . 
 = = US college career = = 
 Brooks suffered from a lack of motivation after the Olympics . He was recruited to the Australian Institute of Sport by swimming coaches Bill Sweetenham and Dennis <unk> , but his stay was brief . The inaugural director Don Talbot , a former head coach of the Australian swimming team , expelled him for indiscipline . He then won the 1981 Australian title in the 100 m freestyle without training , but his time of 52 @.@ 61 s was substantially slower than his personal best . Brooks then accepted a scholarship to go to the University of Arkansas to train under Sam Freas . He enjoyed the more liberal culture in the American collegiate system , particularly the relationship between swimmers and their coaches . He enjoyed the less paternalistic treatment that the coaches accorded to their swimmers , saying that " In Australia , after a race they want to lock you in your room . In America , you can share a beer after the meet with the coach . " The <unk> pools used in the United States played into the hands of Brooks , as his strong legs gave him an advantage in pushing away from the turns , which came twice as often in comparison to <unk> ( 50 m ) pools . He had initially planned to stay in the United States for only a year , but decided to extend his stay by a year , having enjoyed the high frequency of racing and the recognition accorded to university athletes in the United States . In both years , he won the 50 m and 100 m freestyle double in the Southwest Conference , and was fourth in the 100 m freestyle at the 1981 National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Championships . He also came second in the 100 m freestyle at the <unk> Championships to Rowdy Gaines , who went on to win the event at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics . 
 Despite his successes in America , the Australian Swimming Union did not offer to fund a return home for Brooks for the 1982 Australian Championships , but the University of Arkansas paid his fare as a reward for his performances in collegiate competition . Despite failing to defend his 100 m title , he qualified for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane . The team then went into a five @-@ week training camp in the seaside Sydney suburb of South Coogee . The team resided at a migrant hostel , which at the time was primarily occupied by Vietnamese refugees from the Vietnam War . Brooks spoke out about the quality of the accommodation , leading officials to make improvements . 
 = = Brief suspension for disciplinary reasons and 1982 Commonwealth Games = = 
 Brooks ' protests against the accommodation was overshadowed by a much @-@ publicised physical confrontation with a team official . He telephoned his coach in the United States to make return travel arrangements for the conclusion of the Commonwealth Games . Due to the difference in time zones , he made his call after the team curfew , prompting team manager Jeff Hare to attempt to disconnect the line . After Hare threatened to expel him from the team , Brooks lost his temper and pinned the manager against the wall . The swimmer was summoned to a meeting with ASU officials the following day , where he remained unrepentant . He received a one month ban , effective after the conclusion of the Commonwealth Games . Brooks demanded that if the ASU were to suspend him , they should do so immediately for the Commonwealth Games , rather than letting him compete and win medals before punishing him . His complaints about the training conditions had gained the attention of his team @-@ mates , and several senior swimmers threatened to leave if he was banned . In the end , the ASU rescinded the suspension . Brooks has remained strongly critical of the attitude of swimming bureaucracy , claiming that " too many officials expect unquestioning obedience " , calling for the formation of a swimmers ' committee . 
 Arriving in Brisbane for the Commonwealth Games , Brooks and some of his fellow sprinters shaved their heads , something that received much attention from the Australian public . He won his heat of the 100 m freestyle in a Commonwealth and Commonwealth Games record of 51 @.@ 09 s . He swam slower in the final , but his time of 51 @.@ 14 s was enough to secure the gold medal in a close contest . Just 0 @.@ 43 s separated him and the bronze and silver medallists Greg Fasala and Michael Delany , both of Australia . 
 Brooks then won gold as part of the winning 4 × 100 m freestyle relay , anchoring the team of Fasala , Delany and Graeme Brewer to a victory by almost three seconds , putting in a split of 50 @.@ 56 s . The shaven @-@ headed quartet was dubbed the Mean Machine . He collected another gold in the medley relay , combining with David Orbell , Evans and Jon Sieben , this time completing his freestyle anchor leg in 50 @.@ 44 s . Canada had finished the race far ahead of the Australians , but were disqualified for an early changeover . After the games , Brooks completed the American college season before returning to Australia . He was named as Western Australia 's Sportsman of the Year . 
 = = Second Olympics = = 
 Brooks came into the 1984 Australian Championships as the favourite , but this time he was on the receiving end of a close result . He placed third in the 100 m freestyle behind Mark Stockwell and Delany , missing individual selection by 0 @.@ 05 s . The trio was separated by a total of only 0 @.@ 15 s . Selected as a relay swimmer only , he went to Los Angeles hoping to win the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay , an event that the United States had always won . 
 During the heats , the Australian team of Brooks , Fasala , Delany and Stockwell showed their intention to deny the Americans the gold for the first time at Olympic level . Drawn alongside the Americans in the third and final heat , the Australians set a new Olympic record of 3 m 19 @.@ 94 s . Brooks led off in the heat , setting a time of 50 @.@ 36 s , before Stockwell made up a deficit of 0 @.@ 41 s during the anchor leg to beat the hosts by 0 @.@ 20 s . Australia and the United States had stamped their authority on the event , qualifying almost four seconds faster than third @-@ placed Sweden . However , the Americans had more speed in reserve , having rested 200 m freestyle silver medalist Mike Heath and 100 m freestyle gold medallist Rowdy Gaines , whereas Australia used its full @-@ strength team . 
 In the final , Australian coach Terry Buck switched the swimming order , putting Fasala as the leadoff leg , while the Americans brought in Heath and Gaines . Fasala 's time of 51 @.@ 00 s put the Australians second at the first change , behind the Americans , for whom Chris Cavanaugh had built a 0 @.@ 17 s lead . After the first leg , the race was still close — 0 @.@ 90 s separated all the teams . Brooks completed his leg in 49 @.@ 36 s , the fourth fastest in the race , 0 @.@ 24 s faster than his American counterpart Heath , giving the Australians a slender 0 @.@ 07 s lead at the halfway point . Australia and the United States had broken away from the field , which was now the best part of two seconds in arrears . However , the Australian lead was short @-@ lived . Matt Biondi took 0 @.@ 59 s from Delany and Gaines took another 0 @.@ 13 s from Stockwell , as the United States won in a world record time of 3 m 19 @.@ 03 s . Australia were 0 @.@ 65 s behind with Sweden a further 2 @.@ 99 s in arrears . Brooks remained adamant that either he or Stockwell should have led off , stating that " the gold was there for the taking " . 
 Brooks collected a bronze in the medley relay after swimming the freestyle leg in the heats before being replaced by first @-@ choice Stockwell in the final . Competing in the third and final heat , Australia and the United States were equal at the last change before Brooks posted the fastest freestyle leg in the heats , pulling out a 0 @.@ 40 s margin over Tom Jager .

He then combined with Tom <unk> , Paul Lee and Barry Armstrong , as Western Australia won the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay for the first time . Brooks maintained his form and despite not defending his Australian 100 m title , was selected for the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh , where he came second to Fasala in the 100 m freestyle in a time of 51 @.@ 01 s . He claimed gold in the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay along with Fasala , Stockwell and Matthew Renshaw , anchoring the quartet in setting a Commonwealth Games record . On the return flight , he consumed 46 cans of beer and was banned for six months after he talked about the incident during a television interview . In his memoirs , Talbot , a non @-@ drinker , cited Brooks and his Mean Machine teammates as being one of the biggest proponents of a hard @-@ drinking culture that had permeated the Australian swimming scene at the time . In particular , he singled out Brooks as being a focal point of disruptive activity during his time at the Australian Institute of Sport . Talbot sees alcohol as the main reason behind the collapse of Australia 's standing in the swimming world in the 1970s and the subsequent prolonged period of international <unk> in the 1980s .

 Brooks retired thereafter , moving to Nambour , Queensland and starting a rock band called The Union . He played the electric guitar , and also wrote his own music and songs . He also represented Western Australia in water polo and indoor cricket and played Australian rules football at district level . 
 Having graduated from the University of Arkansas with a degree in journalism in 1985 , Brooks entered the media . Before his graduation , he had been a cadet with the Seven Network in Perth for five years , reading the sports segment on the weekday evening news . He was a television commentator at the 1988 , 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics . Aside from covering the swimming and water polo , he also commentated on volleyball and in 1998 , he called various downhill skiing events at the Nagano Winter Olympics . Domestically , Brooks called Australian Football League matches and read the sports segment on the weekday evening news for the Seven Network . For three years , he hosted <unk> 's Footy Show , a Western Australian travel / holiday show called Wild West , and in the lead @-@ up to the Sydney Olympics , co @-@ hosted The Games with Tracey Holmes . 
 However , Brooks ' career began to unravel in the late @-@ 1990s . He became addicted to alcohol , leading to a series of on @-@ screen incidents . He once read the sports news segment while inebriated , and was then involved in a drunken argument with the Nine Network 's Australian rules football pundit Sam Newman . In early 1999 , Seven suspended Brooks from on @-@ screen duties for six weeks after he made comments that they deemed to be " tasteless and offensive " . In an interview with a magazine that had not been authorised by Seven , Brooks was asked what event he was looking forward to most at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney , and replied " The after @-@ Olympics piss @-@ up " . He was eventually sacked , denying him the opportunity to commentate on the swimming events and costing him an annual salary of <unk> . 
 In late 2000 , Brooks was declared bankrupt by the Federal Court in Perth after failing to repay a <unk> debt to BankWest . In May 2001 , the police raided Brooks ' Perth home and found a metre @-@ high cannabis plant . Brooks claimed that the plant belonged to a friend , and then announced that he would be leaving the state . Having moved to South Australia in 2003 , Brooks started Local , which he billed as the state 's leading lifestyle magazine . The venture was run solely by him and his wife , and was dominated by advertising . Journalist Peter FitzSimons criticised the lack of grammar checking and copyediting , citing a quote from Kieren Perkins , which was rendered thus in the publication : " I was over the moon . Winning is something you strive to do but when I consider all the factors being married two children twenty seven years of age competing in my third Games and I broke fifteen minutes twice in two days it really was quite outstanding and whichever way you cut it Grant Hackett was just the next generation of swimmer [ sic ] . " Brooks stood 200 cm and weighed 95 kg during his career , but in the early part of the 21st century fought a battle with obesity , after ballooning to 150 kg . As of 2007 , he had lost substantial weight and fought off his alcohol problems . 
 Brooks later became a partner in Nitro Energy Drink Company , which was involved in motorsport sponsorship . However , the firm suffered from financial trouble and he had a falling out with his business partner . In 2009 , Brooks was removed from the board and the company was put into administration , and both he and his former partner have started legal proceedings . 
 Brooks ' first marriage was to Lynette <unk> in January 1985 . Their son Luke is a member of the Australian water polo team , playing as a goalkeeper . He has two other children from other relationships . In 2000 , he married his third wife Linda . 
 = Irruputuncu = 
 Irruputuncu is a volcano in the commune of Pica , <unk> Province , Tarapacá Region , Chile , as well as San Pedro de <unk> Municipality , Nor Lípez Province , Potosí Department , Bolivia . The mountain 's summit is 5 @,@ 163 m ( 16 @,@ 939 ft ) high and has two summit craters — the southernmost 200 m ( 660 ft ) -wide one has active fumaroles . The volcano also features lava flows , block @-@ and @-@ ash flows and several lava domes . The volcano is part of the Andean Central Volcanic Zone ( CVZ ) . 
 The volcano has been active during the Pleistocene and Holocene , with major eruptions occurring 258 @.@ 2 ± 48 @.@ 8 ka ago , between 55 @.@ 9 ka and 140 ka ago and 1570 ± 900 BP ( 380 ± 900 AD ) , which were accompanied by the formation of ignimbrites . Historical volcanic activity is less clear ; an eruption in 1989 is considered unconfirmed . Plumes linked to phreatomagmatic eruptive activity were observed on 26 November 1995 and 1 September 2003 . Seismic activity is also observed on Irruputuncu , and ongoing fumarolic activity releasing 21 – 50 t / d ( 0 @.@ 24 – 0 @.@ 57 long ton / ks ) of sulfur dioxide has left sulfur deposits in the active crater . 
 The Central Volcanic Zone is thinly inhabited and most volcanoes are not under reconnaissance , but Irruputuncu is watched by the Chilean <unk> geologic service . The possibility of geothermal energy production from the volcano has been examined .

 = = = Regional setting = = = 
 The subduction of the Nazca plate and the Antarctic plate beneath the western side of South America has generated a belt of volcanic activity named the Andean Volcanic Belt . The belt is separated in a number of volcanic zones by segments lacking recent volcanic activity ; in these segments , shallow subduction of the plates presumably displaces the asthenosphere away from these segments . The segments with active volcanism are the Northern Volcanic Zone ( <unk> ) , the Central Volcanic Zone ( CVZ ) , the Southern Volcanic Zone ( SVZ ) and the Austral Volcanic Zone ( <unk> ) . The " Volcanoes of the World " catalogue counts about 575 eruptions in the entire volcanic belt . 
 Volcanic activity in the belt is usually linked to the dehydration of the subducting slabs , which causes water and other subducted components to be added to the overlying mantle . In the case of the CVZ , this addition generates magmas that are further modified by the thick crust in the area , forming andesites , dacites and rhyolites . 
 = = = Local setting = = = 
 Volcanism in the CVZ is linked to the subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South America plate . This subduction within the past c . 27 @.@ 5 mya has triggered a thickening of the crust and orogeny . Approximately 44 volcanic centres that are either active or potentially active are found in the CVZ . Some centres are fumarolically active ; these include <unk> , Lastarria and <unk> . Irruputuncu and other volcanoes including <unk> , <unk> , Lascar and San Pedro have displayed phreatic or magmatic @-@ phreatic activity . The arid climate of the area has led to good preservation of volcanic structures . 
 A small gap about 100 km ( 62 mi ) wide , which is known as the " Pica gap " but includes the Pliocene @-@ Pleistocene Alto <unk> volcano that features vigorous seismic activity , separates Irruputuncu from <unk> in the north . Irruputuncu is part of an elliptical alignment of volcanoes that extends to the east , which may be linked to a cup @-@ shaped intrusion in the crust . Older Pliocene volcanoes around Irruputuncu are Laguna volcano to the northeast and <unk> to the southeast . Irruputuncu lies at the end of a chain of volcanoes that trends northeastward away from it . 
 The volcanic complex sits on top of ignimbrite layers , the Miocene Ujina and Pleistocene Pastillos Ignimbrites . These ignimbrites are <unk> m ( 490 ft ) and 20 – 90 m ( 66 – 295 ft ) thick , the former is a welded ignimbrite that was erupted 9 @.@ 3 ± 0 @.@ 4 mya and the latter in two stages 0 @.@ 79 ± 0 @.@ 2 - 0 @.@ 73 ± 0 @.@ 16 mya and 0 @.@ 32 ± 0 @.@ 25 mya . In terms of composition , the Ujina is pink @-@ grey crystals and pumice and the Pastillos a gray @-@ white pumice forming the lower member and the upper member of the Pastillos contains <unk> with accessory <unk> , siltstones and <unk> . Further volcanic rocks beneath Irruputuncu are hydrothermally altered dacites that may be part of an older now deeply eroded edifice . 
 Irruputuncu is a relatively small , 5 @,@ 163 m ( 16 @,@ 939 ft ) high volcano , which covers a surface area of 23 @.@ 861 km2 ( 9 @.@ 213 sq mi ) with a volume of 4 km3 ( 0 @.@ 96 cu mi ) and has two summit craters , of which the 200 m ( 660 ft ) -wide southwestern one is fumarolically active . Crater II , the youngest crater , is surrounded by the Crater lava flows that form lava domes and seven short lava flows 0 @.@ 54 – 0 @.@ 94 km ( 0 @.@ 34 – 0 @.@ 58 mi ) long , 68 – 107 m ( 223 – 351 ft ) thick and with a total volume of 0 @.@ 042 km3 ( 0 @.@ 010 cu mi ) emitted from it . They have weakly developed ogives and there is no evidence of glacial activity anywhere on the volcano . The current edifice is constructed within a collapsed amphitheater of an older edifice . Overall , the volcano has a pristine morphology . Block @-@ and @-@ ash flows and thick lava flows of high viscosity form the <unk> . A rhyolitic ignimbrite is found southwest of the volcano . The oldest lava flows on the northern and eastern side of the volcano were erupted from a northeastern crater named Crater I and are 35 – 113 m ( 115 – 371 ft ) thick with erosional features and preserved ogives . They have a volume of around 0 @.@ 097 km3 ( 0 @.@ 023 cu mi ) . 
 The younger flows are known as <unk> lava flows ; they form six distinct flows on the western sides of the volcano . They have different appearances depending on the side ; the northwestern flows form lateral lava levees and ogives and reach thicknesses of 117 – 180 metres ( 384 – 591 ft ) while the other flows have lobate structures with thicknesses of 23 – 95 m ( 75 – 312 ft ) . These thicknesses may be the result of high @-@ viscosity magma and / or low eruption rates . A major block @-@ and @-@ ash deposit with the volume of 0 @.@ 023 km3 ( 0 @.@ 0055 cu mi ) covers a surface area of 11 @.@ 333 km2 ( 4 @.@ 376 sq mi ) ; it was highly mobile considering the distances it reached from the volcano on all three sides of the younger crater . It contains large blocks and has long flow ridges . A second block @-@ and ash flow formed by the collapse of lava domes covers 0 @.@ 801 km2 ( 0 @.@ 309 sq mi ) . Its blocks are somewhat smaller and its ridges are poorly developed . Fissure eruptions have generated large lava flows from the flanks . The El Pozo ignimbrite covers a surface area of 0 @.@ 02 km2 ( 0 @.@ 0077 sq mi ) northwest of the volcano with a thickness of 50 m ( 160 ft ) , an approximate volume of 0 @.@ 001 km3 ( 0 @.@ 00024 cu mi ) and is probably linked to Irruputuncu , in which case it would be the volcano 's oldest unit . 
 Irruputuncu underwent a flank collapse that subdivides the volcano into two edifices , the older Irruputuncu I and the younger Irruputuncu II , about 140 ± 40 ka ago . This flank collapse extends 6 @.@ 3 km ( 3 @.@ 9 mi ) southwest from the older crater I and is about 10 m ( 33 ft ) thick . It was formed by the collapse of the southwestern flank and forms three distinct units formed by hummock @-@ forming lava blocks and flow ridges up to 1 km ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) long . Each stage is associated with an individual crater named Crater I and Crater II . The flank collapse was probably produced by <unk> of the volcano or by asymmetric growth . Subsequent activity of the volcano has completely filled the scarp . The lack of ground deformation during eruptive activity suggests the magma chamber of Irruputuncu may be more than 7 – 15 km ( 4 @.@ 3 – 9 @.@ 3 mi ) deep , which may be linked to the thickness of the crust beneath the Central Andes , ranging 50 – 70 km ( 31 – 43 mi ) . 
 Irruputuncu displays vigorous fumarolic activity that occupies about half the summit crater and is visible within several 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) . The 200 m ( 660 ft ) high fumaroles have temperatures of 83 – 240 ° C ( 181 – 464 ° F ) and are composed mainly by sulfur dioxide , followed by minor amounts of hydrogen sulfide , hydrogen chloride , hydrogen fluoride , methane , nitrogen and oxygen . In addition , argon , carbon monoxide , helium , hydrogen and sulfur are found . The temperatures of the fumaroles are comparable with or exceed the boiling point at such altitudes . <unk> imagery indicates Irruputuncu 's fumarole field has a small surface area with high temperatures . Total sulfur dioxide flux from the volcano is between 21 – 50 t / d ( 0 @.@ 24 – 0 @.@ 57 long ton / ks ) . The fumarolic activity has left sulfur deposits on the volcano . Sulfur deposits are found in the youngest crater in an area of about 0 @.@ 011 km2 ( 0 @.@ 0042 sq mi ) , and also form small sulfur flows with pahoehoe @-@ type morphology . Deposits are generally yellow but close to the fumaroles they display different colours depending on their temperatures . Gravel and eolian deposits form sedimentary units around the volcano . 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 Irruputuncu 's rocks consist of <unk> and dacite @-@ containing hornblende and pyroxene . The El Pozo ignimbrite is pumice @-@ rich and has a composition between trachyandesite and <unk> . Minerals amphibole , biotite , hornblende , quartz and plagioclase comprise the rocks . The Irruputuncu I lava flows are composed of trachyandesitic with biotite and plagioclase , while the <unk> are composed of andesite and trachyandesite . The block @-@ and @-@ ash flows and Crater lavas consist of solely trachyandesitic . Overall , these rocks belong to the potassium @-@ rich calc @-@ alkaline series typical of CVZ volcanoes . The magmas are formed by plagioclase and clinopyroxene crystallization with some mixing . Irruputuncu 's rocks show minor evidence of crustal contamination , similar to other CVZ volcanoes located within transition zones . 
 Water is the most important component in the volcano 's fumarolic gases , comprising 96 @.@ 05 % to 97 @.@ 95 % by volume . Examinations of deuterium and oxygen @-@ 18 content of the water have determined that like the water of fumaroles in other Andean volcanic centres , Irruputuncu water is a mixture of weather @-@ related water and water contained in andesite . The helium isotope ratios indicate the magmatic component dominates the gasses at Irruputuncu , Much of the carbon dioxide comes from subducted and crustal carbonates . The gases escape from oxidizing magma at 491 – 781 ° C ( 916 – 1 @,@ 438 ° F ) and pass through a weakly developed hydrothermal system with temperatures of c . 340 ° C ( 644 ° F ) . Argon isotope ratios appear to be radiogenic .

 The oldest rocks at Irruputuncu are lavas that have been dated by potassium @-@ argon dating to 10 @.@ 8 ± 0 @.@ 6 mya . The oldest component clearly belonging to the volcano is the El Pozo ignimbrite that was erupted 258 @.@ 2 ± 48 @.@ 8 ka , forming a multi @-@ layered ignimbrite that was probably generated by the injection of new , hot magma into older , cooler magma . A lava dome on the upper flank on the western side of the volcano is 0 @.@ 14 ± 0 @.@ 04 mya old . The block @-@ and @-@ ash flow between 55 @.@ 9 ka and 140 ka old , but has not been <unk> dated . The Crater lavas are 55 @.@ 9 ± 26 @.@ 8 ka old . The block @-@ and @-@ ash flow on the southwestern flank was formed 1570 ± 900 years BP . 
 Historical activity of Irruputuncu is unclear . An unconfirmed eruption was reported in Bolivia in December 1989 and fumarolic activity in the crater was reported on 25 March 1990 . Eruption plumes on Irruputuncu , which reached an altitude of 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) and dispersed to the east , probably triggered by phreatomagmatic activity , were seen on 26 November 1995 . The plume 's colour changed between black and white repeatedly . Another plume was observed on 1 September 2003 ; neither of these incidents were <unk> with noticeable ground deformation . Like some other volcanoes in the area , activity at Irruputuncu has not been preceded by ground inflation during historical times . Several theories , including aliasing of the imagery , have been proposed to explain the lack of ground inflation . 
 Ongoing seismic activity at a rate of about 5 – 6 earthquakes per 10 days recorded in two separate phases , November 2005 @-@ March 2006 and April 2010 @-@ February 2011 respectively and including one seismic swarm during the first measurement period , has been recorded at Irruputuncu . Some of this activity may be caused by mine blasts from nearby mining projects . Geothermal anomalies of about 9 K ( − 264 @.@ 15 ° C ; − 443 @.@ 47 ° F ) have been noted , including hot springs west and northwest of the volcano . 
 = = Threats and geothermal prospecting = = 
 With the exception of Peruvian volcanoes such as Misti , most of the volcanoes of the CVZ are in remote areas and are not closely watched . Irruputuncu is a remote volcano ; a road between Iquique and the <unk> mine is the main infrastructure that could be affected by future activity . In Chile , Irruputuncu is surveilled by <unk> , which produces regular status reports . 
 Irruputuncu has been examined as a potential location for a geothermal energy project involving a company named Minera Doña Inés de <unk> . A geothermal prospect made at the base of Irruputuncu indicated the presence of water at temperatures of up to 220 ° C ( 428 ° F ) in a deep reservoir .

 Broken Sword : The Shadow of the Templars ( also known as Circle of Blood in the United States ) is a 1996 point @-@ and @-@ click adventure game developed by Revolution Software . The player assumes the role of George Stobbart , an American tourist in Paris , as he attempts to unravel a conspiracy . The game takes place in both real and fictional locations in Europe and the Middle East . 
 In 1992 , Charles Cecil began researching the Knights Templar for the game after he , Noirin Carmody and Sean Brennan conceived Broken Sword . It was built with Revolution 's Virtual Theatre engine . This was also used for the company 's previous two games . Cecil co @-@ wrote and directed the game , while Eoghan Cahill and Neil Breen drew the backgrounds in pencil and digitally colored them in Photoshop . The game has a serious tone , but features humor and graphics in the style of classic animated films . 
 Critics lauded Broken Sword 's story , puzzles , voice acting , writing , gameplay , and music . The game received numerous award nominations and wins . It achieved commercial success as well , with one million copies sold in the mid @-@ 1990s . Topping several lists , it is known as one of the greatest examples of adventure gaming . Many developers of later games have cited Broken Sword as an influence . 
 After its initial release on Microsoft Windows , Mac OS , and PlayStation , it was ported to the Game Boy Advance , Palm OS , and Windows Mobile . The game spawned a number of sequels collectively known as the Broken Sword series . From 2009 to 2012 , a director 's cut version was released on Wii , Nintendo DS , Microsoft Windows , OS X , iOS , Android and Linux . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Broken Sword is a 2D adventure game played from a third @-@ person perspective . The player uses a point @-@ and @-@ click interface to interact with the environment and to guide protagonist George Stobbart through the game 's world . To solve puzzles and progress in the game , the player collects items that may be combined with one another , used on the environment , or given to non @-@ player characters ( NPCs ) . The protagonist converses with NPCs via dialogue trees presented through " conversation icons " to learn about the game 's puzzles and plot . Clues and other information are obtained by clicking on items in the inventory and on objects in the environment . The player navigates with a map , to which new locations are added as the story unfolds . Unlike in most adventure games at the time , the protagonist 's death is possible , after which the player starts from the last save point . 
 = = Plot = = 
 As the game begins , American tourist George Stobbart witnesses a terrorist attack at a café in Paris , during which a clown steals an old man 's briefcase and detonates a bomb . Soon after , George meets Nicole Collard , a journalist who is photographing the scene . George investigates the area to help Nicole gather information about the attack . He finds the clown 's discarded nose and learns that a man was seen escaping with a briefcase . After Nicole discovers the address of a costume shop inside the clown nose , George learns from that shop 's owner that the nose had been purchased by a man named Khan . 
 George travels to the hotel where Khan is staying , where he obtains an ancient manuscript from Khan 's hotel safe . After evading two hired thugs , Flap and Guido , George takes the manuscript to Nicole , who deduces that it is related to the Knights Templar . In a nearby museum , George finds a tripod that is illustrated in the manuscript . He soon travels to the excavation site in Lochmarne , Ireland where the tripod had been discovered ; and , there , he obtains a gem identical to one on the manuscript . After facing a goat , George finds an entrance to a Templar chapel beneath the local castle ruins , where he discovers a mural of a hanged man with " Montfauçon " written underneath . 
 George returns to Paris and learns from Andre Lobineau , a colleague of Nicole 's , that Montfauçon is a location in Paris . Flap and Guido attempt to steal the tripod from the museum ; but they are beaten to the theft by Nicole , who gives the artifact to George . In the sewers of Montfauçon , George spies on a secret meeting of people who claim to be the Templars , and he learns of their plan to find the Sword of Baphomet . After the group leaves , George uses the tripod and gem in the underground chamber to reveal the name of a village in Syria : Marib . He travels to the village and discovers that Khan has been looking for him . At a nearby rock formation called the Bull 's Head , George finds a lens and deduces that it is represented on the manuscript as a crystal ball . He also discovers an idol with three bearded faces , Baphomet ; and a Latin inscription that describes Britain . Khan arrives and holds George at gunpoint , but George manages to escape . 
 Back in Paris , George learns from Andre that the manuscript mentions the Spanish De Vasconcellos family , who were once connected with the Templars . At the family 's villa , George speaks to the family 's sole surviving member , a Countess , who leads him to the De Vasconcellos mausoleum . There , George discovers the family 's chalice , which the Countess entrusts to George . She asks him to find her missing ancestor , Don Carlos . In Paris , George uses the lens in the church at Montfauçon and discovers a hidden image of a burning man . In the church , George find Don Carlos ' tomb , which is inscribed with a series of biblical references . 
 Andre reveals that an idol of Baphomet has been discovered in Paris , and George gains access to the excavation . Using the chalice , he discovers an image of a church with a square tower . George returns to the Countess , and he discovers that the biblical references show a secret area inside a well containing a chessboard mural with a river running through it . Compiling their clues , George , Nicole , and Andre decide that the Templars are going to Bannockburn , Scotland . George and Nicole board a train , but she and an old woman in their compartment soon go missing . He reaches the conductor 's carriage , where the old woman , Khan in disguise , throws Flap out of the carriage . However , Khan is shot and killed during the confrontation .. George and Nicole reach the church in time to see the Grand Master of the Templars acquire a power from two huge Baphomet idols — the Sword of Baphomet , or the Broken Sword . After trying to tempt George to join their ranks , the Grand Master orders the couple to be killed , but they escape with the aid of explosives Khan had given Nicole before his death . The church explodes , killing Guido , the Templars , and — presumably — the Grand Master . The game ends with George and Nicole 's first kiss . 
 = = Development = = 
 In 1992 , Cecil and Noirin Carmody met with Sean Brennan , then @-@ head of publishing at Virgin Interactive , and spoke about how the Knights Templar would make an ideal subject to base a game on . Later , Virgin agreed to issue the game . In a September 1992 interview for French magazine Génération 4 , Charles Cecil stated that he had begun working on a scenario for Revolution 's third game , after 1992 's Lure of the Temptress and 1994 's then @-@ upcoming Beneath a Steel Sky . The game would be set in Paris with a Templar story line . The following month , Cecil visited Paris to research the Templars ; after reading The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail , he was certain there was enough known about the Templars to make them a good subject for a game . Cecil , Dave Cummins , and Jonathan Howard began work on the story and design . Cecil and Cummins attended a film @-@ writing course and their script was read by Alan Drury , a senior BBC scriptwriter and dramatist . Revolution artist Steve Ince created initial location sketches for the game before working on Beneath a Steel Sky . He was promoted to producer halfway through the project . 
 Despite releasing the PC version , Virgin was not interested in publishing the game on the PlayStation , feeling that only 3D games would sell for the console . As a result , Cecil contacted Sony Computer Entertainment , who agreed to release the game for the console . In North America , Broken Sword was renamed to Circle of Blood . Cecil was uneasy about the name change , feeling that it gave a wrong impression of what type of game it was . In 1998 however , THQ published the game on the PlayStation platform under its original Broken Sword : The Shadow of the Templars title . 
 One of Cecil 's goals was to depart from the humorous adventure games more popular at the time , such as LucasArts ' Monkey Island series , by creating a game with good pacing and a complex storyline , a reason he thought the Knights Templar would be an ideal subject . Unlike LucasArts games , which used a question @-@ and @-@ answer conversation system , Broken Sword offered " conversation icons " that would not reveal to the player what the protagonist was about to say ; Cecil 's intention was to make the game more cinematic , but not resemble interactive movies of that time ; he felt that they were " mimicking movies . " He wanted to create two protagonists who would exchange ideas , helping drive the game along . He made George American and Nico French to appeal to US and European markets . 
 The team at Revolution had high expectations for Broken Sword , but there was significant competition . Revolution had a team that had created successful adventure games , but believed they needed to utilise the best of other creative industries . Eoghan Cahill and Neil Breen of Dublin 's Don Bluth studios drew the backgrounds in pencil and digitally colored them in Photoshop . The introductory sequence and the main characters were done by animator Mike Burgess , who worked for the Red Rover animation studio . The game 's graphics were animated in a style resembling classic animated films . 
 Cecil contacted composer Barrington Pheloung , who agreed to create the game 's score . Revolution had already cast Hazel Ellerby as Nicole Collard , but had trouble finding a voice actor for George Stobbart . Hazel , who went to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London , suggested her former schoolmate from Guildhall , Rolf Saxon , as George . Charles offered him the job , and Saxon accepted . The remaining credited voice actors in the original are Rachel Atkins , David Bannerman , Rosy Clayton , Jack Elliott , Steve Hodson , David Holt , Peter Kenny , Richard <unk> , Matthew Marsh , Colin McFarlane , Don <unk> , Gavin Muir , Paul <unk> , and Andrew Wincott . 
 Cecil was the game 's director and writer , Tony Warriner and David Sykes the designer @-@ programmers , and Noirin Carmody the executive producer . The game uses the Virtual Theatre engine , as do Lure of the Temptress and Beneath a Steel Sky . The game 's final cost was one million pounds . It was ported to the Game Boy Advance in 2002 , and to the Palm OS and Windows Mobile in 2006 . 
 In March 2009 , Ubisoft released a director 's cut of The Shadow of the Templars entitled Broken Sword : The Shadow of the Templars – Director 's Cut for the Wii and Nintendo DS . Dave Gibbons , with whom Revolution worked on Beneath a Steel Sky , created additional artwork for the game . Due to the platform 's size limits , the DS version contains no spoken dialogue , only subtitles . A version of the Director 's Cut for iPhone and iPod Touch was released on January 20 , 2010 . In May 2010 , a version in high definition was released for the iPad . Versions for Windows and Mac OS X were released in September 2 , 2010 , on digital @-@ distribution services . An Android version was released on Google Play in June 2012 . The original version of the game is only available from Sold @-@ Out Software and GOG.com with Director 's Cut purchases .

 Broken Sword was acclaimed by critics , who praised the game 's story , art direction , musical score , voice acting , and writing . Edge stated that Broken Sword was superior to LucasArts ' adventure games , such as Monkey Island and The Dig , and believed it to be an " adventure gaming milestone " and the " best graphic adventure to date . " The game was a commercial success , with roughly one million copies sold in the mid @-@ 1990s . Broken Sword : The Shadow of the Templars – Director 's Cut also received praise — particularly the iOS versions , which , along with The Smoking Mirror 's remastered edition , was downloaded by over four million people in 2011 . According to Cecil , the remake 's sales were higher than those of The Sleeping Dragon and The Angel of Death . 
 Adventure Gamers ' <unk> Mooney commented that the game 's " deep and mysterious plot is designed to be thought @-@ provoking and highly entertaining at the same time . " GameSpot 's Rebecca B. Anderson found that the game 's combination of real history and " highly @-@ creative " storytelling " add [ s ] spice to an already @-@ entertaining adventure . " Joe Antol of Adventure Classic Gaming wrote that the involvement of the Knights Templar generated a " unique experience of creative storytelling . " A writer for Next Generation magazine stated that the story is " rich in mystery and intrigue , with plenty of puzzles and locations to explore . " Edge 's reviewer praised the game 's use of " legend and modern @-@ day intrigue " , and believed that " Revolution Software finally escaped the shadow of Monkey Island et al. and [ have ] taken the graphic adventure to new levels in terms of both story and spectacle . " The writer commented that , by weaving its " trans @-@ European plot around the legends of the Knights Templar " , the game " succeeds in appearing weighty and complex without ever losing its sense of place " . 
 Mark Wolf of PC Gamer US called the game " visually stunning " , praising the animated graphics as " crisp and clear " and the artwork as " simply beautiful " . He also wrote , " At the highest setting , the background and foreground scroll separately , delivering a sense of depth you don 't see in many graphic adventures . Even the atmosphere of each of the areas you explore fit the locale . " Mooney called the animation " extremely colorful and well @-@ executed " and noted that the art team " have taken this style of animation and really made an elegant , mature game with it . " The writer also noted that the environments are " detailed and inviting " . Anderson called the game a " visual treat " and a " work of art , " noting that " every scene is filled with rich , lush , illustrative detail that rivals any animated feature film . " Next Generation 's writer called the character movements " fantastic " and the cutscenes " a joy to watch . " The writer for Edge praised its art direction , in which " every visual element is polished to the ' nth ' degree " . The reviewer believed that " the SVGA artwork by far exceeds the competition in this genre . " 
 Edge complimented its musical score for " play [ ing ] a large part in mood enhancement " , noting that " it 's beautifully orchestrated and adds immeasurable atmosphere . " Mooney also praised the score , calling it " ambitious and beautiful " and saying it adds a very " cinematic feel " to the experience . Mooney said that the game 's voice acting is " of supreme quality " with " delightful dialogue " , but noted that long conversations might " turn some players off " . Wolf was more critical of the voice acting , calling it " not too professional " and " the worst thing in the game " . 
 Mooney stated that the game 's puzzles are well integrated into the plot and are moderately challenging . Wolf called the puzzles inventive and challenging , but believed that some require " too much pixel @-@ hunting " . Next Generation 's writer said that the puzzles can be " disappointing . " Despite acclaiming the Windows version , GameSpot deemed the PlayStation version mediocre , criticizing technical deficiencies , such as lengthy load times and muddy graphics . Cecil later cited the PlayStation version as his " one big regret " regarding the game . He believed that the team should have introduced direct control over the player character in this version , instead of mouse @-@ driven point @-@ and @-@ click interaction .

Joao Diniz Sanches of Pocket Gamer said Broken Sword 's story is a " tale , some would argue , that effortlessly outclasses Dan Brown 's similarly themed and <unk> novel .

 In May 2007 , ComingSoon.net reported that Cecil , encouraged by the success of The Angel of Death , had begun work on a Broken Sword theatrical film adaptation . According to the website , producers Jay Douglas and Nav <unk> and their <unk> Studios production company were involved . Justin Kaplan introduced Cecil to the company and was set to be one of the producers .

 In July 2008 , Cecil said he was conversing with small studios from Los Angeles . Although he was interested in making a film , he believed that it was not necessary , since the series was already successful and a bad film could only " damage " its reputation . Cecil said that he was not prepared to " give somebody [ he doesn ] ' t know the editorial control " , and that , should the film be created , he would write it himself . He wanted any adaptation to be true to the source material , a film that " enhances [ the game ] rather than cashes in on it " . In May 2009 , Cecil stated that he was in discussion with the production company Radar Pictures , known for films such as The Last Samurai and The Chronicles of Riddick , and that he was re @-@ writing the game into a film . 
 In August 2012 , Cecil said that he and Revolution were trying to " find the right partner " to create the film . Cecil believed that " a lot of film makers now in their early 30s played Broken Sword the first time around , so they have a lot of affection , and a number of them know a lot about the brand as well .

 = Don Tallon with the Australian cricket team in England in 1948 = 
 Don Tallon was a key member of Donald Bradman 's famous Australian cricket team tour of England in 1948 , in which Australia was undefeated in their 34 matches . This unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet The Invincibles . 
 The team 's first @-@ choice wicket @-@ keeper ahead of Ron Saggers , Tallon played in four of the five Tests , missing the Fourth Test due to injury . Despite being the preferred gloveman , Tallon conceded byes at a higher rate than Saggers during the tour . 
 Bradman rotated the two glovemen during the tour , and Tallon played in 14 of the 31 first @-@ class matches , taking 29 catches and 14 stumpings . Tallon 's catch of Len Hutton in the Fifth Test at The Oval was described as Wisden as the best of the year . He also took a difficult catch to remove George Emmett in the Third Test at Old Trafford , catching a ball that flew to his feet at yorker length . However , Tallon also had some mishaps , with finger injuries inflicted by failing to catch the ball correctly . Tallon had few opportunities with the bat , scoring 283 runs at a batting average of 25 @.@ 72 in 13 first @-@ class innings , including two fifties . During the Test , Tallon scored 112 runs at 28 @.@ 00 , including a 53 in the Second Test that saw Australia recover to a first innings of 350 after a middle @-@ order slump had seen England take the upper hand . He took 12 catches in the Tests . 
 In recognition of his performances , Tallon was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1949 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Tallon 's form as Australia 's wicket @-@ keeper since World War II saw him selected for the 1948 Ashes tour as part of the side that would become known to cricket history as the Invincibles . Tallon was the first @-@ choice wicket @-@ keeper , with Saggers as his deputy . Having spent the majority of his life in sunny Queensland and growing up in tropical Bundaberg , the cold English climate initially caught Tallon off guard . He did not wet his inner gloves as was his custom due to the temperature . As England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs , this meant that the ball would more frequently be in a favourable state for fast bowling , since it would swing more . As a result , Australia adopted a pace @-@ oriented strategy and Ian Johnson was the only spinner regularly used in the Test matches . Colin McCool was not to play a Test on the tour , depriving Tallon of an opportunity to show his stumping abilities standing up at the stumps to his Queensland team @-@ mate in the Tests . 
 = = Early tour = = 
 Australia traditionally fielded its first @-@ choice team in the tour opener , which was customarily against Worcestershire . Accordingly , Tallon was selected as the wicket @-@ keeper for the match . The home side batted first and Tallon made his first dismissal on English soil by catching Worcestershire captain Allan White from the bowling of Keith Miller . He then stumped former England captain Bob Wyatt from McCool . In reply to the hosts ' 233 , Tallon was promoted to No. 6 , but managed only six in a collapse of 4 / 38 before Australia recovered to declare at 8 / 462 . He took a further three dismissals in the second innings , two of them stumpings from McCool 's bowling , as Australia crushed the hosts by an innings and 17 runs . Tallon conceded 11 byes in the match . 
 Tallon was rested for the second tour match against Leicestershire , which Australia won by an innings with Saggers behind the stumps . 
 Tallon played a key role in Australia 's victory in the next match against Yorkshire , on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling . He came in at 7 / 86 and made ten in the first innings to push Australia to 101 in reply to Yorkshire 's 71 , in which Tallon did not concede a bye . However , Tallon was not so tidy in the second innings , conceding 11 byes as the hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings . He did not make a dismissal in the match . Australia then collapsed to 6 / 31 in pursuit of 60 for victory when Tallon strode in . To make matters worse , Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat , so Australia only had three wickets in hand . Australia faced its first loss to an English county since 1912 . He survived an immediate leg before wicket appeal and then hit a shot that fell just short of a fielder . He then compiled 17 unbeaten runs as Australia scraped home by four wickets . 
 The Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval . Tallon came in with the score at 6 / 553 , and held up his end , scoring an unbeaten 50 as his partners steadily fell and Australia were bowled out at 632 . Tallon had some difficulty in English conditions as he sustained a bruised right finger when he lost sight of a Ray Lindwall bouncer on a misty morning during the match and was hit as he put hand over his face for protection , with the ball running away for four byes . Tallon took two catches in the second innings as Australia won the match by an innings , but he also conceded 24 byes in Surrey 's match total of 336 . 
 After sustaining the bruised finger , Tallon was rested for the following three matches , which were against Cambridge University , Essex and Oxford . Australia won each of the matches by an innings . Saggers filled in and scored 110 runs including a 104 not out against Essex and took five dismissals . Saggers conceded only 34 byes in his four tour matches , while Tallon had conceded 46 in <unk> 
 The next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) at Lord 's . The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests , N- and were basically a full strength Test team , as were Australia , who fielded their first @-@ choice team . It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage , and Tallon was selected despite conceding byes at a higher rate in the preceding tour matches . He made 11 batting at No. 9 , including a six from Jim Laker as Australia made 552 . He took three catches in the first innings , having a hand in the first three wickets to fall , Jack Robertson , Bill Edrich and Denis Compton . He then took two stumpings in the second innings as the follow on was enforced , but also conceded 26 byes as Australia won by an innings . Tallon had conceded 72 byes to Saggers ' 34 with both having played four <unk> 
 Following the match against the MCC , there were four more county fixtures before the First Test , against Lancashire , Nottinghamshire , Hampshire and Sussex . Australia drew the first two before winning the latter two by eight wickets and an innings and 325 runs respectively . Tallon played in only the Nottinghamshire match , taking two catches in the first innings and two stumpings in each of the innings . The catches were all from Lindwall and the stumpings from Doug Ring . Tallon conceded 18 byes for the match and scored 27 , being last man out at 400 after coming to the crease at 6 / 355 . In Saggers 's three matches , 36 byes were conceded and six dismissals were made . 
 = = First Test = = 
 Despite averaging more byes per innings than Saggers during the warm @-@ up matches , N- Tallon was retained in the Test team . During the First Test at Trent Bridge , Tallon took four catches . In the first innings , Tallon caught Jim Laker from the bowling of Keith Miller to end England 's innings of 165 after he and Alec Bedser had joined forces at 8 / 74 . 
 When Australia batted , Tallon came in at 6 / 338 to accompany Lindsay Hassett and took 39 minutes to compile 10 before hitting a return catch to the left arm orthodox spin of Jack Young . The scoring was slow during this passage of play — Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs and his 26 @-@ over spell conceded only 14 runs with Australia using leg theory . 
 After Australia ended with 509 and took a 334 @-@ run lead , Tallon took two difficult catches to dismiss key batsmen at the start of England 's second innings . Miller removed Cyril Washbrook for one from a top @-@ edged hook shot to Tallon . Bill Edrich was then caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson . He did not read the arm ball that went straight on and the ball took the outside edge , leaving England at 2 / 39 . He thus helped Australia to seize the initiative by denying England a good start , but they recovered . Later , he caught Godfrey Evans for 50 from Johnson as England ended at 441 . Australia reached their target of 98 with two wickets down , completing an eight @-@ wicket victory . Tallon conceded five and 12 byes in the two innings respectively . 
 Between Tests , Australia played Northamptonshire and Yorkshire , and Tallon was rested for both matches . The first was won by an innings and second was drawn . Saggers made four and 22 and conceded 24 byes in four innings . 
 = = Second Test = = 
 The teams moved on to Lord 's for the Second Test and Australia compiled 350 in its first innings . Tallon came to the crease with Australia at 6 / 225 after Hassett and Bill Brown had gone in quick succession , joining Johnson in the middle . Johnson struggled to score , while Tallon did so freely in the last hour . After Johnson fell for four at 7 / 246 , Lindwall then joined Tallon and the pair survived to the close of play . England were well placed when Australia ended at stumps on 7 / 258 with Tallon on 25 . Tallon had dominated the scoring late in day , making 25 of the 33 runs added . The crowd was optimistic about England 's position and some immediately camped outside the turnstiles upon leaving the ground . 
 Australia 's lower order batted the tourists into control on the second morning . Despite the loss of Lindwall for 15 at 8 / 275 , Tallon kept on batting in a conventional manner , supported by Johnston and Ernie Toshack , who scored their highest Test scores . Both tail @-@ enders threw the bat at the ball , which often went in vastly different directions to where they had aimed their shots . Tallon put on 45 with Johnston — who scored 29 — before holing out for 53 . Ending at 350 , the Australians had regained the momentum , taking 92 runs from 66 minutes of hitting in the morning . 
 Tallon did not concede a bye in England 's first innings of 215 and his diving was estimated to have saved around 40 runs . He caught Washbrook from Lindwall to leave England at 1 / 17 , and later caught Laker from Johnson . Tallon was not needed in the second innings ; Lindwall was promoted above Tallon because Australia needed quick runs and Lindwall was a big @-@ hitter . Australia declared at 7 / 460 , leaving England a target of 509 . 
 With the score at 2 / 65 , Washbrook inside edged a Toshack full toss directly downwards at Tallon 's ankle . Bradman described the catch as " miraculous " because Tallon had to reach so low , so quickly , in order to take the catch . Another dive to stop a leg glance resulted in a severely bruised left little finger . Tallon conceded 16 byes in the second innings , more than 8 % of England 's score . Australia won the Test by 409 runs , and nursing his finger , Tallon was rested for both tour matches between the Tests , which were against Surrey and Gloucestershire , which were won by ten wickets and an innings respectively . In his place , Saggers scored 12 , took nine dismissals and conceded 31 byes in four innings . 
 = = Third Test = = 
 The teams then played out a rain @-@ affected draw in the Third Test match at Manchester , where England elected to bat first . On the first day , Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall delivery and was caught by Tallon for 32 , leaving England at 5 / 119 . Compton returned at the fall of Edrich 's wicket after previously leaving the ground after being bloodied in the head by a Lindwall bouncer . He batted to stumps , after being dropped one @-@ handed on 50 by Tallon , before again being dropped on 64 late in the day by the gloveman from the bowling of Johnston . England closed at 7 / 231 with Compton on 64 . 
 On the second morning , Tallon again dropped Compton from Johnston when the batsman was on 73 . England eventually finished on 363 , with Compton not out on 145 . Thus Tallon 's drops cost 95 runs as well as allowing Compton to hold up one end so his partners could score . Tallon also conceded seven byes . 
 Australia reached 3 / 135 when Miller and Arthur Morris departed in quick succession . With Sid Barnes retiring hurt because of a blow to the ribs , Tallon came in at 5 / 139 , effectively six wickets down and made 18 in half an hour before falling at 6 / 172 . Australia managed to reach 221 and avoid the follow on . 
 England batted again and Tallon dismissed George Emmett from Lindwall with a diving one @-@ handed catch . Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket @-@ keeper Tallon , who took it in his right hand with a dive , leaving England at 1 / 1 . England then declared at 3 / 174 ; Tallon conceded nine byes and with more than a day was lost to rain , Tallon was not required as Australia batted out the last session for a draw . 
 Tallon 's little left finger swelled up after the Third Test and he exacerbated the injury during a tour match against Middlesex . In this match , he scored 17 , took two catches and a stumping in the first innings and conceded only seven byes for the entire match as Australia won by ten wickets . 
 = = Fourth Test = = 
 The left finger injury ruled him out of the Fourth Test at Headingley , and he was replaced by Saggers . Australia set a world record in successfully chasing a target of 404 to win the match by seven wickets and secure the series . Saggers leaked only six byes in 299 @.@ 1 overs of glovework during the match as Australia conceded a total of 861 runs for the match . It was the lowest percentage of byes conceded in a match total by an Australian wicket @-@ keeper for the tour ( 0 @.@ 697 % ) .N- 
 Tallon missed the innings victory over Derbyshire , before returning against Glamorgan . In his first match back from injury , Tallon took a catch and two stumpings as the hosts were dismissed for 197 , but he also conceded 19 byes . Byes made 9 @.@ 64 % of the match total conceded by Australia , the highest proportion by the tourists during the <unk> He did not bat as rain ended the match with Australia at 3 / 215 . He was rested for the nine @-@ wicket win over Warwickshire , before returning for Australia 's second match and second draw against Lancashire . Tallon came in at 7 / 232 and scored 33 , adding 63 with Ian Johnson to help Australia reach 321 . He took two catches and two stumpings but also conceded 23 byes . In the non @-@ first @-@ class match against Durham , Tallon played purely as a batsman , while Saggers kept wicket . He opened the batting , but was dismissed for one as Australia made 273 and the hosts reached 5 / 73 before rain ended the match . 
 = = Fifth Test = = 
 Tallon returned for the Fifth Test at The Oval , where England elected to bat first on a rain @-@ affected pitch . Tallon caught Jack Crapp from an outside edge for a duck from the bowling of Miller , leaving England at 4 / 23 as play was adjourned for lunch . England continued to struggle against the moving ball and were all out for 52 in the middle session . The innings ended when Tallon took an acrobatic catch to dismiss Len Hutton down the leg side , catching it with his left hand . It was considered the catch of the season by Wisden . Tallon conceded six byes in the innings . 
 Australia batted and passed England 's total on the first afternoon . Tallon came in to bat on the second day with the score at 7 / 332 , joining opener Morris , who had already passed 150 . It took a run out to remove Morris ; he attempted a quick run to third man after being called through by Tallon but was not quick enough for the substitute fielder 's arm , leaving Australia at 8 / 359 . Tallon , who scored 31 , put on another 30 runs with Doug Ring , before both were out on 389 , ending Australia 's innings . In the second innings , Tallon caught Hutton from Miller and conceded nine byes as England were dismissed for 188 and lost by an innings , sealing a 4 – 0 series victory for Australia . 
 = = Later tour matches = = 
 Seven matches remained on Bradman 's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat . Tallon was rested for three consecutive matches against Kent , the Gentlemen of England , and Somerset , all of which Australia won by an innings . Saggers stood in and made seven dismissals and conceded 29 byes in the six innings of the three matches . 
 He returned for the following match against the South of England . He did not bat as Australia declared at 7 / 522 . He then took three catches and conceded 13 byes as the match was washed out when the hosts were dismissed for 298 . 
 Australia 's biggest challenge in the post @-@ Test tour matches was against the Leveson @-@ Gower 's XI . During the last tour in 1938 , this team was effectively a full @-@ strength England outfit , but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play for the hosts . Bradman then fielded a full @-@ strength team , with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being Johnson coming for Doug Ring . Tallon made two as Australia declared at 8 / 489 . He conceded seven byes and did not make a dismissal as the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays . 
 The tour ended with two non @-@ first @-@ class matches against Scotland . In the first match , Tallon played as a batsman while Saggers kept wicket . Tallon scored only six in Australia 's 236 and then took 0 / 10 in Scotland 's second innings and did not take a catch in the innings victory . In the second match in Aberdeen , Tallon kept wicket , conceding 26 byes and not taking a dismissal and he was not required to bat . When the match became safe , with Australia in an unassailable position in Scotland 's second innings , Bradman allowed Tallon to dispense with his wicket @-@ keeping pads and try his luck at bowling leg spin . Tallon never bowled in his Test career and only rarely in first @-@ class cricket , where he delivered 301 balls , the approximate workload of a specialist bowler in one match . Tallon took 2 / 15 as Australia finished the tour with another innings win . 
 = = Role = = 
 Tallon had had moderate success with his batting during the Test series , aggregating 114 runs at 28 @.@ 50 . He usually batted at No. 8 , and only had four innings as Australia 's batting strength was such that he did not need to bat in the second innings in any of the Tests . The Australian team strategy of primarily depending on fast bowling saw Tallon make 12 catches and no stumpings during the Tests . However , Bradman gave his lead pace bowlers Miller and Lindwall more rest during the tour games to save energy for the Tests , and relied more heavily on the off spin of Ian Johnson and the leg spin of McCool and Doug Ring in the county matches . Thus overall Tallon took 29 catches and 14 stumpings for the first @-@ class matches during the tour . Tallon scored 283 runs at 25 @.@ 72 for the season at an average higher than Saggers 's 23 @.@ 22 . In all his matches on tour , Tallon conceded 249 byes as Australia conceded 5331 runs , a bye percentage of 4 @.@ 67 % , compared to Saggers 's 221 byes from 6190 runs , a percentage of 3 @.@ 57 % .N- 
 During the tour , Tallon had few opportunities with the bat , generally batting between No. 8 and No. 9 , N- because Australia 's frontline bowlers included the likes of Ray Lindwall , Colin McCool , Ian Johnson and Doug Ring , who were all capable with the bat . Lindwall scored two Test centuries in his career , while McCool scored 18 first @-@ class centuries , including one in Tests . Johnson and Ring both scored more than 20 fifties at first @-@ class level . As Australia often won by an innings , and often declared in the first innings , Tallon only had 13 innings in his 14 first @-@ class fixtures and was not out two times as he ran out of partners . 
 Tallon 's performances during the English summer saw him named by Wisden as one of its five Cricketers of the Year .

 Fred Durst grew up in Jacksonville , Florida , where he took an interest in breakdancing , hip hop , punk rock and heavy metal . He began to rap , skate , beatbox and deejay . While mowing lawns and working as a tattoo artist , he developed an idea for a band that combined elements of rock and hip hop . Durst played with three other bands , Split 26 , Malachi Sage , which were unsuccessful , and 10 Foot Shindig , which Durst left to form a new band . Durst told Sam Rivers , the bassist for Malachi Sage , " You need to quit this band and start a band with me that 's like this : <unk> ' and rockin ' . " Rivers suggested that his cousin , John Otto , who was studying jazz drumming at the Douglas Anderson School of the Arts and playing in local avant garde bands , become their drummer . Durst , Rivers and Otto jammed and wrote three songs together , and Wes Borland later joined as a guitarist . 
 Durst named the band Limp Bizkit , because he wanted a name that would repel listeners . According to Durst , " The name is there to turn people 's heads away . A lot of people pick up the disc and go , ' Limp Bizkit . Oh , they must suck . ' Those are the people that we don 't even want listening to our music . " Other names that were considered by Durst included <unk> Disco , Split <unk> , Bitch Piglet , and Blood Fart . Every record label that showed an interest in the band pressured its members to change its name . Limp Bizkit developed a cult following in the underground music scene , particularly at the Milk Bar , an underground punk club in Jacksonville . The band 's local popularity was such that Sugar Ray , who had a major label contract , opened for a then @-@ unsigned Limp Bizkit at Velocity with hip hop group <unk> . <unk> owner , Danny Wimmer , stated that Limp Bizkit " had the biggest draw for a local band . They went from playing [ for ] ten people to eight hundred within months . Fred [ ... ] was always marketing the band . He would go to record stores and get people involved , he was in touch with high schools . " However , the band knew that to achieve national success , they would have to distinguish themselves in their live performances . Attracting crowds by word of mouth , the band gave energetic live performances , covering George Michael 's " Faith " and Paula Abdul 's " Straight Up " , and featuring Borland in bizarre costumes . Borland 's theatrical rock style was the primary attraction for many concert attendees . 
 Durst unsuccessfully tried to attract attention from A & R representatives at various labels by pretending to be the band 's manager . Later , when Korn performed in town as the opening act for Sick of It All , Durst invited Korn to drink beer and tattoo them . Although Durst 's tattoos were unimpressive , he was able to persuade Reginald " Fieldy " Arvizu to listen to a demo , consisting of the songs " Pollution " , " Counterfeit " and " Stuck " . Korn added a then @-@ unsigned Limp Bizkit to two tours , which exposed the band to a new audience . The band attempted to expand their sound by auditioning an additional guitarist , but Borland soon determined that another guitarist was not the answer , and DJ Lethal , formerly of the hip hop group House of Pain , joined the band as a turntablist after a successful practice performance . Joining the band gave Lethal an opportunity to experiment with his turntable technique in ways that hip hop had not allowed him to do , helping shape the band 's style . However , Borland left the band due to creative differences .

 After their performance opening for Korn at the Dragonfly in Hollywood was well received , Limp Bizkit signed with Mojo , a subsidiary of MCA Records . While heading to California to record their first album , the band wrecked their van . As a result of the near death experience , Durst made amends with Borland , who rejoined the band . After a dispute with Mojo , Limp Bizkit signed with Flip , a subsidiary of Interscope Records . Arvizu persuaded Ross Robinson to listen to the demo . Robinson neglected to listen to it until it was appraised by his girlfriend . Impressed by the band 's motivation and sound , Robinson produced Limp Bizkit 's debut , which was recorded at Indigo Ranch . Durst 's problems with his girlfriend inspired him to write the song " Sour " . The mood and tone set by Robinson in the studio allowed the band to improvise ; a recording of the band improvising appeared as the last track on the album , " Everything " . 
 Despite the success of live performances of the band 's cover of the song " Faith " , Robinson was opposed to recording it , and tried to persuade the band not to play it on the album . However , the final recording , which incorporated heavier guitar playing and drumming , as well as DJ scratching , impressed him . Robinson also bonded with Borland , who he perceived as not taking the band seriously . The progressive metal band Tool provided a strong influence in shaping the album 's sound , particularly in the song " Nobody Loves Me " , which contains a breakdown in which Durst imitated the singing style of Maynard James Keenan . 
 Continuing the band 's policy of using names that would repulse potential listeners , the band named the album by using part of the phrase " queer as a three dollar bill " and adding the word " Y 'all " for Florida flavor , naming the album , Three Dollar Bill , Yall . The completed album featured an abrasive , angry sound which Limp Bizkit used to attract listeners to their music . After the band completed recording , they toured with Korn and Helmet . Critics reacted unfavorably to performances of Korn and Limp Bizkit ; Milwaukee Journal @-@ Sentinel music critic Jon M. Gilbertson criticized Durst 's performance , stating " The one attention @-@ grabbing moment of Limp Bizkit 's rap / thrash show was when the lead singer expressed a desire for gay men to be ' stomped ' . Which isn 't remotely rebellious . It 's just puerile . " 
 Interscope proposed to the band that the label pay $ 5 @,@ 000 to guarantee that a Portland , Oregon radio station play the song " Counterfeit " fifty times , preceded and concluded with an announcement that the air time was paid for by Interscope . The paid air time was criticized by the media , who saw it as " payola " . The band 's manager Jeff Kwatinetz later termed the plan as a " brilliant marketing move " . Durst stated , " It worked , but it 's not that cool of a thing . " Following the release of " Counterfeit " as a single , Three Dollar Bill , Yall was released on July 1 , 1997 , and was met with minimal response . AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote , " They might not have many original ideas [ ... ] but they do the sound well . They have a powerful rhythm section and memorable hooks , most of which make up for the uneven songwriting . " However , Robert Christgau panned the album . Despite the minimal response to his band 's album , Durst was appointed Senior Vice President of A & R at Interscope . 
 Limp Bizkit joined the Warped Tour , performing alongside the bands Pennywise , Mighty Mighty Bosstones , Sick of It All , Lagwagon and Blink @-@ 182 . Preceding their first tour with DJ Lethal , Otto became familiar with Lethal 's contributions to collaborate with him better on stage . In addition to touring with Primus and Deftones , Limp Bizkit headlined the Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour , which was intended to diversify the band 's fanbase , which was largely male , by offering free tickets to female attendees . This plan successfully increased the band 's female fanbase . 
 In 1998 , Limp Bizkit toured with Soulfly and Cold on Soulfly 's first European tour . Touring consistently increased Limp Bizkit 's success , and the second single from Three Dollar Bill , Yall , a cover of George Michael 's " Faith " , became a successful radio hit , leading to a slot on Ozzfest , a tour organized by Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne . In July , Snot singer Lynn Strait was arrested after he emerged nude from Limp Bizkit 's prop toilet , and was charged with indecent exposure . Because Limp Bizkit 's fans would often break through the barricades , the band was almost kicked off the tour after two days . In August , John Otto spent the night in jail in Auburn Hills , Michigan , on a misdemeanor charge of carrying a concealed weapon , after allegedly firing a BB gun and being arrested for carrying a switchblade . 
 After completing Ozzfest , Limp Bizkit took a break from performing , and later performed on Korn 's Family Values Tour . Durst also directed a music video for the band 's single " Faith " in promotion for its appearance in the film Very Bad Things , but was unsatisfied with it , and directed a second video which paid tribute to tourmates like Primus , Deftones and Korn , who appeared in the video . Borland stated in an interview that George Michael , the writer of the song , hated the cover and " hates us for doing it " . 
 = = = Significant Other ( 1999 – 2000 ) = = = 
 Following the radio success of " Faith " , the band was determined to record the follow @-@ up to their first album in order to show that they weren 't a Korn <unk> or a cover band ; the band began writing an album which dealt with issues deriving from their newfound fame . Terry Date , who had produced albums for Pantera , White Zombie and Deftones , was chosen to produce the album . The band allowed Durst and Lethal to explore their hip hop origins by recording a song with Method Man . The song was originally titled " Shut the Fuck Up " , but was retitled " N 2 Gether Now " for marketing purposes . Durst also recorded with Eminem , but the collaboration , " Turn Me Loose " , was left off the album . The album also featured guest appearances by Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland , Korn 's Jonathan Davis and Staind singer Aaron Lewis , and interludes by Les Claypool and Matt Pinfield . 
 Significant Other saw Limp Bizkit reaching a new level of commercial success ; the band was featured on the covers of popular music magazines , including Spin , and now found themselves repeatedly mobbed for autographs ; the band was allowed to interact directly with their fans on a website established by Dike 99 . Durst also moved from Jacksonville to Los Angeles . Significant Other was seen as an improvement over their debut , and was generally well received by critics with mixed to positive reviews . However , the band also continued to be criticized by the media ; an article profiling the band in Spin and discussing Significant Other claimed that " Limp Bizkit had yet to write a good song " , and musicians Marilyn Manson and Trent Reznor criticized the band . 
 The band promoted the album by playing unannounced concerts in Detroit and Chicago , as radio stations received a strong amount of requests for the album 's first single , " Nookie " . Significant Other climbed to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 , selling 643 @,@ 874 copies in its first week of release . In its second week of release , the album sold an additional 335 @,@ 000 copies . On the opening night of the band 's <unk> tour with Kid Rock , Sam Rivers smashed his bass in frustration over the venue 's poor sound , cutting his hand . After his hand was stitched up at a hospital , Rivers returned to finish the set . On July 12 , Durst allegedly kicked a security guard in the head during a performance in St. Paul , Minnesota , and was later arrested on assault charges . Further criticisms of the band appeared in Rolling Stone and The New York Times . New York Times writer Ann Powers wrote , " DJ Lethal used his turntables as a metal guitar , riffing expansively and going for effects instead of rhythm . John Otto on drums and Sam Rivers on bass never even tried to get funky , instead steering hip @-@ hop 's break @-@ beat @-@ based structure into a backbone for power chords . This makes for a hybrid that would be more interesting if the band did not constantly mire itself in boring tempos , and if Mr. Durst had any talent as a singer " . 
 In the summer of 1999 , Limp Bizkit played at the highly anticipated Woodstock ' 99 show in front of approximately 200 @,@ 000 people . Violent action sprang up during and after their performance , including fans tearing plywood from the walls during a performance of the song " Break Stuff " . Several sexual assaults were reported in the aftermath of the concert . Durst stated during the concert , " People are getting hurt . Don 't let anybody get hurt . But I don 't think you should mellow out . That 's what Alanis Morissette had you motherfuckers do . If someone falls , pick ' em up . We already let the negative energy out . Now we wanna let out the positive energy " . Durst later stated in an interview , " I didn 't see anybody getting hurt . You don 't see that . When you 're looking out on a sea of people and the stage is twenty feet in the air and you 're performing , and you 're feeling your music , how do they expect us to see something bad going on ? " Les Claypool told The San Francisco Examiner , " Woodstock was just Durst being Durst . His attitude is ' no press is bad press ' , so he brings it on himself . He wallows in it . Still , he 's a great guy . " 
 Durst saw the band as being scapegoated for the event 's controversy , and reflected on the criticisms surrounding the band in his music video for the single " Re @-@ Arranged " , which depicted the band members receiving death sentences for their participation in the concerts . The video ended with angry witnesses watching as the band drowned in milk while performing the song . Durst later stated that the promoters of Woodstock ' 99 were at fault for booking his band , due to their reputation for raucous performances . Despite this controversy , Significant Other remained at No. 1 on the Billboard charts , and the band headlined the year 's Family Values Tour . Durst directed a music video for " N 2 Gether Now " which featured Method Man and Pauly Shore , and was inspired by Inspector Clouseau 's fights with his butler , Cato Fong , in the Pink Panther film series . 
 = = = Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water ( 2000 – 01 ) = = = 
 In 2000 , Durst announced that the band 's third studio album would be titled Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water . The press thought he was joking about this title . The album title is intended to sound like a fictional band ; the phrase " Chocolate Starfish " refers to the human anus , and Durst himself , who has frequently been called an " asshole " . Borland contributed the other half of the album 's title when the band was standing around at a truck stop , looking at bottles of flavored water , and Borland joked that the truck stop didn 't have hot dog or meat @-@ flavored water . 
 In June 2000 , Limp Bizkit performed at the WXRK <unk> Family Picnic , but showed up an hour late for their set . An Interscope spokesman stated that there was confusion over the band 's set time . During the band 's performance , Durst criticized Creed singer Scott Stapp , calling him " an egomaniac " . Creed 's representatives later presented Durst with an autographed anger management manual during an appearance on Total Request Live . In the summer , Limp Bizkit 's tour was sponsored by the controversial file sharing service Napster , doing free shows with a metal cage as the only thing separating them from the audience . Durst was an outspoken advocate of file sharing . They also did a " Guerrilla Tour " which involved the band setting up illegally and impromptu public gigs on rooftops and alleyways , some being shut down by the police . 
 During the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards , Durst performed " Livin ' It Up " , a song from the upcoming album , as a duet with Christina Aguilera . In response to the performance , Filter frontman Richard Patrick was quoted as saying " Fred getting onstage with Christina Aguilera embarrassed us all . " In response to the negative reactions to the performance , Durst remarked , " I already told you guys before , I did it all for the <unk> , man . " In response to Durst 's remark , Aguilera commented , " He got no <unk> . " 
 Released on October 17 , Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water set a record for highest first @-@ week sales for a rock album with over one million copies sold in the US in its first week of release . 400 @,@ 000 of those sales happened during the first day , making it the fastest @-@ selling rock album ever , breaking the record held for 7 years by Pearl Jam 's Vs . Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water was certified Gold , Platinum and six times Multi @-@ Platinum . The album received mixed reviews , with Allmusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing , " Durst 's self @-@ pitying and the monotonous music give away that the band bashed Chocolate Starfish out very quickly – it 's the sound of a band determined to deliver a sequel in a finite amount of time . " Entertainment Weekly writer David Browne named it as the worst album title of 2000 . 
 During a 2001 tour of Australia at the Big Day Out festival in Sydney , fans rushed the stage in the mosh pit , and teenager Jessica Michalik died of asphyxiation . In court , Durst , represented by long @-@ time attorney , Ed McPherson , testified he had warned the concert 's organizers Aaron Jackson , Will Pearce and Amar Tailor , and also the promoter Vivian Lees , of the potential dangers of such minimal security . After viewing videotapes and hearing witness testimony , however , the coroner said it was evident that the density of the crowd was dangerous at the time Limp Bizkit took the stage , stating that Fred Durst should have acted more responsibly when the problem became apparent . Durst stated that he was " emotionally scarred " because of the teenager 's death . 
 Later in 2001 , numerous hip @-@ hop artists including P. Diddy , Timbaland , Bubba Sparxxx and Everlast remixed famous songs from the band into hip @-@ hop versions adding their own styles and modifications . The album was called New Old Songs . 
 = = = Departure of Borland , Mike Smith and Results May Vary ( 2001 – 03 ) = = = 
 In October 2001 , Durst released a statement on their website stating that " Limp Bizkit and Wes Borland have amicably decided to part ways . Both Limp Bizkit and Borland will continue to pursue their respective musical careers . Both wish each other the best of luck in all future endeavors . " Durst also stated that the band would " comb the world for the <unk> guitar player known to man " to replace Borland . 
 After holding a nationwide audition for a new guitarist , called " Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is " , the band recorded with Snot guitarist Mike Smith , but later scrapped their recording sessions with Smith . Durst told a fan site that he had a falling out with Smith , saying " We are the type of people that stay true to our family and our instincts and at any moment will act on intuition as a whole . Mike wasn 't the guy . We had fun playing with him but always knew , in the back of our minds , that he wasn 't where we needed him to be mentally . " 
 After recording another album without Smith , the band scrapped the new sessions and assembled a new album combining songs from different sessions . During the album 's production , the working title changed from Bipolar to Panty Sniffer , and was completed under the title Results May Vary . Under Durst 's sole leadership , the album encompassed a variety of styles , and featured a cover of The Who 's " Behind Blue Eyes " , which differed from the original 's arrangement in its inclusion of a Speak & Spell during the song 's bridge . 
 In the Summer of 2003 , Limp Bizkit participated on the Summer Sanitarium Tour , headlined by Metallica . At the tour 's stop in Chicago , attendees of the concert threw items and heckled Durst from the moment he walked on stage . With the crowd chanting " Fuck Fred Durst " and continuing their assault on him , Durst threw the mic down after six songs and walked off stage , but not before heckling the crowd back . He repeatedly said , " Limp Bizkit are the best band in the world ! " until a roadie took his microphone away . An article in the Sun @-@ Times stated that the hostility was started by radio personality <unk> . 
 Results May Vary was released on September 23 , 2003 , and received largely unfavorable reviews . Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine panned the album , writing , " the music has no melody , hooks , or energy , [ and ] all attention is focused on the clown jumping up and down and screaming in front , and long before the record is over , you 're left wondering , how the hell did he ever get to put this mess out ? " The Guardian reviewer Caroline Sullivan wrote , " At least Limp Bizkit can 't be accused of festering in the rap @-@ rock ghetto [ ... ] But Durst 's problems are ever @-@ present – and does anybody still care ? " Despite criticisms of the album , it was a commercial success , peaking at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 .

 In August 2004 , Borland rejoined Limp Bizkit , which began recording another album , The Unquestionable Truth ( Part 1 ) . 
 In May , The Unquestionable Truth ( Part 1 ) was released . Sammy Siegler took over drumming duties for the band for much of the album , which featured a more experimental sound , described by Allmusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine as " neo @-@ prog alt @-@ metal " . At Durst 's insistence , the album was released as an underground album , without any advertising or promotion . Borland disagreed with the decision , suggesting that it was " self @-@ sabotage " : " Maybe he was already unhappy with the music , and he didn 't really want to put it out there . " 
 The album received mixed reviews . Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the music , calling it " a step in the right direction – it 's more ambitious , dramatic , and aggressive , built on pummeling verses and stop @-@ start choruses . " However , he felt that the band was being " held back " by Durst , who he called " the most singularly unpleasant , absurd frontman in rock . " IGN writer Spence D. similarly gave it a mixed review , as he felt that the album lacked direction , but that showed potential for the band 's musical growth . 
 The Unquestionable Truth ( Part 1 ) sold over 37 @,@ 000 copies worldwide , peaking at No. 24 on the Billboard 200 . Following the release of the band 's Greatest Hitz album , the band went on hiatus . Borland stated that it was unlikely that a sequel to The Unquestionable Truth would be produced and that " As of right now , none of my future plans include Limp Bizkit . " 
 = = = Reunion , Gold Cobra and departure from Interscope ( 2009 – 11 ) = = = 
 In 2009 , Limp Bizkit reunited with Borland playing guitar and launched the Unicorns N ' Rainbows Tour . Durst announced that they had begun to record a new album , which Borland titled Gold Cobra . Borland said that the title does not have any meaning , and that it was chosen because it fit the style of music the band was writing for the album . The band recorded a spoken intro written by Durst and performed by Kiss member Gene Simmons for the album , but it was left off the completed album . The band also recorded additional " non @-@ album " tracks , including " Combat Jazz " , which featured rapper Raekwon and " Middle Finger " , featuring Paul Wall . " Shotgun " was released as a single on May 17 , 2011 . The song is noted for featuring a guitar solo by Borland , something that the band is not known for . " Shotgun " received favorable reviews , with Artistdirect writing , " [ ' Shotgun ' ] feels like Bizkit approached the signature style on Three Dollar Bill Y 'All and Significant Other with another decade @-@ plus of instrumental experience and virtuosity , carving out a banger that could get asses moving in the club or fists flying in the mosh pit . " 
 Gold Cobra was released on June 28 and received mixed to positive reviews . AllMusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it " a return to the full @-@ throttled attack of Three Dollar Bill Y 'All . IGN writer Chad Grischow wrote , " Though far from their best work , Limp Bizkit 's latest at least proves that their 2005 Greatest Hitz album may have been premature . " Metal Hammer writer Terry Bezer appraised the album , writing " Aside from the odd duff moment , Gold Cobra throws out the hot shit that 'll make you bounce in the mosh pit over and over again . " The band launched the Gold Cobra Tour in support of the album . A music video for the title track was released . Gold Cobra has sold nearly 80 @,@ 000 copies in the United States alone and peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 ; however , the band left Interscope after the album 's release .

On February 24 , Limp Bizkit signed with Cash Money Records , and revealed plans to release a new single , " Ready to Go " , a full @-@ length album , Stampede of the Disco Elephants , and an EP , The Unquestionable Truth ( Part 2 ) . Due to mounting tensions and following a dispute between Durst and bandmates Lethal and Otto about the latter two 's alleged chronic drug and alcohol use , DJ Lethal resigned from the band with strong animosity .

This is the first time Limp Bizkit has worked with WWE since 2001 .

 It was announced on October 26 , 2012 on Fred Durst 's official Twitter account that a video for the first Cash Money single with Lil Wayne , " Ready to Go " was currently being filmed . Limp Bizkit also " leaked " a new song on the web called " <unk> ( City of Angels ) " via YouTube . The band is currently recording their seventh studio album , Stampede of the Disco Elephants with producer Ross Robinson , who also produced the band 's debut album , Three Dollar Bill , Yall , and their 2005 album The Unquestionable Truth ( Part 1 ) .

 In October 2014 , Fred Durst revealed that the band had left Cash Money , and became independent again . The split was carried out amicably , and Fred says that " We really love the jam we did with Lil Wayne , though . We love that song . " ( the song " Ready to Go " ) . 
 The band started its 2015 activities with news : Stampede of the Disco Elephants is in the final stages of production , however as of 2016 no news has come of release of the album . A few days later , the band announced their major 2015 tour called " Money Sucks " , a Russian 20 @-@ date tour to take place during October and November , celebrating the 20th anniversary of Limp Bizkit . The tour name is a nod to the difficult economic situation that Russia was facing at the time . 
 Limp Bizkit was leading <unk> 2015 cruise from February 2 to 6 . Other bands present were Chevelle , Black Label Society , P.O.D. , Sevendust among others . But some days before the event , Borland took to Instagram to express his discontent , posting a photo of his luggage with a caption reading : " Can 't wait to see me some <unk> out tribal tattooed spray tanned Jell @-@ O shot filled <unk> do their best drunk MMA impressions in the top deck mosh pit . " Speaking to NME , Borland moved to clarify the comments , saying " When I first read the description of the cruise I realised it is what it is and I thought I 'd have some fun with it " he says . " I 'll retract everything if I don 't see a big muscly frat boy moshing in the pit . I think that is going to happen though so I feel safe . I 'm turning 40 next week and I think it 's funny that I 'm spending the last week of my 40s on <unk> . It 's funny to me . It 's a joke with truth in it . I just don 't want our fans to get all <unk> and thinking I 'm criticising them , because I 'm not . " 
 Before the band travel to Europe to attend some shows and the " Money Sucks " Tour through Russia , Sam Rivers was diagnosed with a degenerative disease of the discs of the spine and that was complicated due to a pinched nerve , causing a lot of pain in such area , which has prevented him from being with the band . Through the <unk> forums Sam offers this statement , adding that he will have surgery , following for rehabilitation . Bass duties are covered by Samuel Gerhard <unk> .

 Durst wanted Limp Bizkit to be a " <unk> " which could cross over into as many different styles of music as possible . Limp Bizkit 's music has predominately been described as nu metal , rap metal and rap rock . Limp Bizkit have also been described as alternative metal , alternative rock and post @-@ grunge . Limp Bizkit 's music is noted for its " kinetic , frenzied energy " . Otto is adept in drumming in a variety of styles ranging from Brazilian and Afro @-@ Cuban music to bebop and funk . DJ Lethal functions as a sound designer for the band , shaping their sound . According to Lethal , " I try and bring new sounds , not just the regular chirping scratching sounds . [ ... ] It 's all different stuff that you haven 't heard before . I 'm trying to be like another guitar player . " 
 Borland 's guitar playing is experimental and nontraditional , and he is noted for his creative use of six and seven @-@ string guitars . Three Dollar Bill , Yall features him playing without a guitar pick , performing with two hands , one playing melodic notes , and the other playing chord progressions . His guitar playing has made use of octave shapes , and choppy , eighth @-@ note rhythms , sometimes accompanied by muting his strings with his left hand , creating a percussive sound . Borland has also made use of unevenly accented syncopated sixteenth notes to create a disorienting effect , and hypnotic , droning licks . The song " Stuck " uses a sustain pedal in the first bar , and muted riffs in the second bar . 
 AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that their album , Significant Other , contains " flourishes of neo @-@ psychedelia on pummeling metal numbers " and " swirls of strings , even crooning , at the most unexpected background " . The band did not employ solos until Gold Cobra ( except for the song " Underneath The Gun " out of Results May Vary ) , however , during the recording of Significant Other , drummer John Otto performed an extended solo in the middle of the song " Nobody Like You " . Durst 's lyrics are often profane , scatological or angry . Much of Durst 's lyrical inspiration came from growing up and his personal life . The song " Sour " , from the album Three Dollar Bill , Yall , was inspired by Durst 's problems with his girlfriend . His breakup with her inspired the Significant Other songs " Nookie " and " Re @-@ Arranged " . When describing Limp Bizkit 's lyrics , The Michigan Daily said " In a less @-@ serious vein , Limp Bizkit used the nu @-@ metal sound as a way to spin testosterone fueled fantasies into snarky white @-@ boy rap . Oddly , audiences took frontman Fred Durst more seriously than he wanted , failing to see the intentional silliness in many of his songs . " Furthermore , Limp Bizkit 's lyrics were described as " misogynistic " . The Unquestionable Truth ( Part 1 ) focuses on more serious and darker lyrical subject matter , including Catholic sex abuse cases , terrorism and fame .

 Borland is known for performing in costumes and body paint during concerts , appearing in bunny and kung fu suits , and painted as a skeleton and what he describes as a " burnt match " . Describing the character , he stated , " I go onstage wearing almost nothing . I have underwear and my boots on , and I paint my whole head black — from the neck up — and I have the black contacts . All you can see is these glowing teeth . " Borland 's black contacts were customized for him by a company noted for making contacts for the science fiction TV series Babylon 5 . 
 In addition to Borland 's visual appearance , the band has also used elaborate stage setups in their performances . Their Ladies Night in Cambodia club tour visually paid tribute to the film Apocalypse Now , with an elaborate stage setup which featured an empty Jeep , camouflage mesh and palm trees . During the band 's tour with Primus , Limp Bizkit took inspiration from Primus ' trademark self @-@ deprecatory slogan " Primus sucks " : Durst , Borland , Rivers , Otto and Lethal took the stage with middle fingers raised . According to Borland , " they finger us back — and you know what that means to us — that they love us . It 's kind of like saying something is bad when you really mean good . Les Claypool came out the first night of the tour and got a big kick out of it . We figured it was the right idea . It makes hecklers go ' huh . ' " 
 During the band 's sets at Ozzfest , audience members at the tour heckled Limp Bizkit , leading the band to use a 30 @-@ foot toilet as a stage prop , which they would emerge from during each performance ; the band punctuated their sets by " flushing " cardboard cutouts of pop stars like Hanson and the Spice Girls . During their appearance at the first Family Values Tour , Limp Bizkit performed on a set which the Los Angeles Times described as " a mix of The War Of The Worlds and Mars Attacks " . The band emerged from a spaceship during the tour , and Borland continued to experiment with visual appearances . During the band 's Halloween performance on the tour , each of the band 's members dressed as Elvis Presley at various stages in his career .

 = Battle of Höchstädt ( 1800 ) = 
 The Battle of Höchstädt was fought on 19 June 1800 on the north bank of the Danube near Höchstädt , and resulted in a French victory under General Jean Victor Marie Moreau against the Austrians under Baron Pál Kray . The Austrians were subsequently forced back into the fortress town of Ulm . Instead of attacking the heavily fortified , walled city , which would result in massive losses of personnel and time , Moreau dislodged Kray 's supporting forces defending the Danube passage further east . As a line of retreat eastward disappeared , Kray quickly abandoned Ulm , and withdrew into Bavaria . This opened the Danube pathway toward Vienna . 
 The Danube passage connecting Ulm , Donauwörth , Ingolstadt and Regensburg had strategic importance in the ongoing competition for European hegemony between France and the Holy Roman Empire ; the army that commanded the Danube , especially its passage through Württemberg and Bavaria , could command access to the important cities of Munich and the seat of Habsburg authority : Vienna . The end result of the battle was the opposite of what had occurred on those same fields almost 100 years earlier , when the armies of the Grand Alliance had faced the armies of France during the War of the Spanish Succession . At the Second Battle of Höchstädt in 1704 , called the Battle of Blenheim by the English , the overwhelming Allied victory ensured the safety of Vienna from the Franco @-@ Bavarian army , thus preventing the collapse of the Grand Alliance . France 's loss during that engagement opened the pathway into France for the allied English and Austrian forces . 
 = = Background = = 
 Although the First Coalition forces achieved several initial victories at Verdun , Kaiserslautern , Neerwinden , Mainz , Amberg and Würzburg , the efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the Peace of Leoben ( 17 April 1797 ) and the subsequent Treaty of Campo Formio ( October 1797 ) . This treaty proved difficult to administer . Austria was slow to give up some of the Venetian territories . A Congress convened at Rastatt for the purposes of deciding which southwestern German states would be <unk> to compensate the dynastic houses for territorial losses , but was unable to make any progress . Supported by French republican forces , Swiss insurgents staged several uprisings , ultimately causing the overthrow of the Swiss Confederation after 18 months of civil war . By early 1799 , the French Directory had become impatient with stalling tactics employed by Austria . An uprising in Naples raised further alarms , and recent gains in Switzerland suggested the timing was fortuitous for the French to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany . 
 At the beginning of 1800 , the armies of France and Austria faced each other across the Rhine . Feldzeugmeister Pál Kray led approximately 120 @,@ 000 troops . In addition to his Austrian regulars , his force included 12 @,@ 000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria , 6 @,@ 000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg , 5 @,@ 000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz , and 7 @,@ 000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol . Of these , 25 @,@ 000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance ( Bodensee ) to protect the Vorarlberg . Kray posted his main body of 95 @,@ 000 soldiers in the L @-@ shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France . Unwisely , Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach , near the northwestern end of Lake Constance , only a day 's march from French @-@ held Switzerland . 
 General of Division Jean Victor Marie Moreau commanded a modestly @-@ equipped army of 137 @,@ 000 French troops . Of these , 108 @,@ 000 troops were available for field operations while the other 29 @,@ 000 watched the Swiss border and held the Rhine fortresses . Napoleon Bonaparte offered a plan of operations based on outflanking the Austrians by a push from Switzerland , but Moreau declined to follow it . Rather , Moreau planned to cross the Rhine near Basel where the river swung to the north . A French column would distract Kray from Moreau 's true intentions by crossing the Rhine from the west . Bonaparte wanted Claude Lecourbe 's corps to be detached to Italy after the initial battles , but Moreau had other plans . Through a series of complicated maneuvers in which he flanked , double flanked , and <unk> Kray 's army , Moreau 's forces lay on the eastern slope of the Black Forest , while portions of Kray 's army was still guarding the passes on the other side . Battles at Engen and Stockach were fought on 3 May 1800 between the Moreau 's and Kray 's armies . The fighting near Engen resulted in a stalemate with heavy losses on both sides . However , while the two main armies were engaged at Engen , Claude Lecourbe captured Stockach from its Austrian defenders under the Joseph , Prince of Lorraine @-@ Vaudemont . The loss of this main supply base at Stockach compelled Kray to retreat north to Messkirch , where his army enjoyed a more favorable defensive position . It also meant , however , that any retreat by Kray into Austria via Switzerland and the Vorarlberg was cut off . 
 On 4 and 5 May , the French launched repeated and fruitless assaults on the Messkirch . At nearby <unk> , where the Austrians also had the superiority of position and force , the 1st Demi @-@ Brigade took the village and the heights around it , which gave them a commanding aspect over Messkirch . Subsequently , Kray withdrew his forces to Sigmaringen , followed closely by the French . Fighting at nearby Biberach an der Ris ensued on 9 May ; action principally consisted of the 25 @,@ 000 man @-@ strong French " Center " , commanded by Laurent de Gouvion Saint @-@ Cyr against a Habsburg force of similar size . Again , on 10 May , the Austrians withdrew with heavy losses , this time to Ulm .

 Sources are unclear which forces were present . Certainly , it was approximately 40 @,@ 000 troops , and possibly 60 @,@ 000 , well above the 10 @,@ 000 – 30 @,@ 000 total Austrian and Württemberg numbers . Contemporary accounts place the 94th Demi @-@ brigade at the center of action in <unk> , a village between Höchstädt and Donauwörth , about .5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) from Blindheim . This suggests the presence of General Claude Jacques Lecourbe ' s Corps , including the forces of generals Laval , Molitor , Jardon , and <unk> . This is also confirmed in an extract of Moreau 's dispatch to the French Minister of War , published in the London Chronicle , 10 June 1800 . " The 6th chasseurs , 13th cavalry , 4th hussars and 11th chasseurs distinguished themselves in this affair . The rest of the division , and that of <unk> , passed rapidly the Danube ... General Grenier was equally well prepared . " In his Art of War , Baron Antoine @-@ Henri Jomini also refers to General <unk> @-@ Duclos as having a key role in the French success at Höchstädt .

 The Allied force included approximately 20 @,@ 000 Habsburg regulars and Württemberg 's contingent of troops raised for the war :

 Kray assumed that Moreau would follow him to fortress at Ulm , on the Danube , where he arrayed most of the Austrian regulars and Württemberg contingent and supplies . This position gave him ready access to both shores of the river and effectively , he assumed , blocked Moreau 's path into Bavaria . At several points east on the Danube , he posted modest forces to protect the river crossings there , and to dismantle , if necessary , the stone bridges across the river . Several bridges crossed the river between Ulm and Donauwörth , which lay downstream to the east , and each presented a strategic point at which to rupture Kray 's potential line of march into Bavaria : <unk> , Günzburg , Gundelfingen , Lauingen , Dillingen , Höchstädt , <unk> , and Elchingen . 
 According to Moreau 's narrative , he intended to force Kray to either come to battle outside Ulm , or to abandon the city . Ulm obstructed unfettered French access into Bavaria , and blocked the main force of the Army of the Rhine . To keep his forces secure , accepted military wisdom required that Moreau secure at least half of the crossings of the river , and that his troops follow a line of march perpendicular to the river . This would prevent them from having to fight a battle ( or a skirmish ) with their backs to the river . The more bridges his force could take , the more secure the approach on Ulm . 
 = = General engagement = = 
 Moreau appeared to march toward Ulm , which lay some twenty miles east of Sigmaringen and Biberach an der Ris , where his army and Kray 's had engaged a few days earlier . Instead of striking directly at the well @-@ fortified and supplied city , however , his force suddenly veered to the east and struck at the smaller forces posted between Ulm and Donauwörth . Lecourbe first secured posts in Landsberg and Augsburg , and left sufficient rearguard troops to protect himself from Prince Reuss @-@ Plauen , who remained in the Tyrol guarding mountain access to Vienna . He then approached Dettingen , Blindheim ( Blenheim ) and Höchstädt . The Corps of General Grenier has been posted with their right flank to the Danube and Gunzburg , and their left flank at <unk> . General Richepanse protected both shores of the Iller , covering the road from Ulm south to Memmingen , and secured communication with Switzerland ; there , he withstood considerable skirmishing with the Austrians . Three divisions of reserve remained at the hamlets of <unk> and Mindel , to support the attack made by General Lecourbe on Ulm , in a case it should succeed , or Grenier 's attack upon Gunzburg , in case Lecourbe should not succeed . 
 Lecourbe made several feints on the bridge at <unk> , but his reconnaissance suggested instead that he focus on the bridges at <unk> , Blindheim and Höchstädt , which he did the next day . A small group of 80 or so men from the 94th Demi @-@ Brigade managed a spectacular crossing of the river . After stripping their clothing and weapons , and loading them into a small raft , the naked men swam the river , pulling their weapons on rafts behind them . Once reaching the other side , they took possession of several guns and some ammunition , wood , and materials . Here they held their position until some artillery men managed to scramble across the wreck of the bridge at <unk> and support them . The pioneers and bridge builders reconstructed the bridges under Austrian fire , allowing the remainder of the 94th crossed the river . This accomplishment seemed to mark the turning point of the action , at least it did to Moreau , who mentioned it at length in his dispatch . A full Austrian Corps maintained a stand at Höchstädt , but were dislodged by repeated attacks of carabiners , cuirassiers and hussars , who took about 2 @,@ 000 of the Austrians and <unk> as prisoners , along with some cannons and standards . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Once the French had secured the downstream shores of the Danube , Kray had no choice but to evacuate his corps from Ulm , leaving only a small garrison behind . The French invested the fortress at Ulm immediately , and on the 20th , the 6th Chasseurs captured a convoy of 300 wagons loaded with grain . A few days later , a general armistice halted all fighting . Emperor Francis II dismissed Pál Kray and appointed his brother , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Archduke John , to command the Austrian army . To bolster the inexperienced archduke , the emperor named Franz von Lauer as deputy commander and Oberst ( Colonel ) Franz von Weyrother as Chief of Staff . 
 The campaign culminating in Kray 's evacuation of Ulm was one of Moreau 's most resounding triumphs . Napoleon Bonaparte had given Moreau specific instructions about the conduct of the campaign , all of which Moreau had ignored . Regardless , their combined efforts damaged Habsburg military operations . In Spring 1800 , while Moreau wrecked Austrian defenses in Germany , Massena and Desaix ran into stiff Austrian offensives in Northern Italy . Napoleon brought in the reserve corps and defeated the Austrians at Marengo . The battle near Höchstädt , five days after the Austrian disaster at Marengo , allowed the French to take Munich . The combined efforts forced the Habsburgs to accept an armistice ended hostilities for the rest of the summer , but the French extracted massive levies on the Bavarians . Despite these significant losses — both of them decisive — the Austrians were reluctant to accept disadvantageous peace terms . In mid @-@ November , the French ended the truce and Moreau inflicted another significant and decisive defeat at Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800 . The subsequent Peace of Lunéville stripped Austria of much of her Italian territories , obliged the Habsburgs to recognize the French satellites in the Low Countries , Switzerland , and northern Italy , and laid the groundwork for the <unk> of the small independent ecclesiastical and secular imperial polities by the duchies of Baden and Württemberg , and the Electorate of Bavaria .

 York Park is a sports ground in the Inveresk and York Park Precinct , Launceston , Australia . Holding 21 @,@ 000 people — the largest capacity stadium in Tasmania — York Park has been known as Aurora Stadium under a six @-@ year naming rights agreement signed with Aurora Energy in 2004 . Primarily used for Australian rules football , its record attendance of 20 @,@ 971 was set in June 2006 , when Hawthorn Football Club played Richmond Football Club in an Australian Football League ( AFL ) match . 
 The area was swampland before becoming Launceston 's showgrounds in 1873 . In the following decades the grounds were increasingly used for sports , including cricket , bowls and tennis . In 1919 , plans were prepared for the transformation of the area into a multi @-@ sports venue . From 1923 , the venue was principally used for Australian rules football by the Northern Tasmanian Football Association , and for occasional inter @-@ state games . Visiting mainland football clubs regularly played mid @-@ season or end @-@ of @-@ season matches at the ground . Other sports such as cricket , tennis , bowling , cycling and foot @-@ racing have been played at the venue . 
 Hawthorn has played between two and five AFL matches each season since 2001 , and the St Kilda Football Club played two games a year between 2003 and 2006 . In 2007 , the Tasmanian Government signed a $ 16 @.@ 4 million , five @-@ year sponsorship deal with Hawthorn , under which the club will play four regular season games and one National Australia Bank Cup pre @-@ season match at the venue each year . 
 Throughout its history , York Park has hosted major pop concerts and other entertainments . Since 2001 it has been a venue for international sports events , and in 2005 was redeveloped at a cost of $ 23 @.@ 6 million . On 21 February 2009 York Park became home to the Tasmanian Football Hall of Fame . 
 = = History = = 
 The area now known as York Park was originally " swampy , sour , and choked with weeds " . After European settlement , it was used for landfill before becoming the Launceston showgrounds in 1874 . By 1881 , 47 acres ( 0 @.@ 19 km2 ) of land ( now York and Invermay Parks ) had been taken over by the Launceston City Council " for the purpose of recreation , health and enjoyment " . The area was ready to be used for two cricket games by the end of 1886 . Cricketers were full of praise for the ground , but because winter rain caused it to become waterlogged , footballers ( Australian rules ) were often unable to use the facility . 
 At a council meeting in July 1901 , one member , Alderman <unk> , proposed that Inveresk Park be renamed York Park in honour of the Duke of York ( later King George V ) , who visited Tasmania during the Federation celebrations of 1901 . The proposal was passed 4 – 2 , although another member , Alderman <unk> , noted that " Launceston was well known as a loyal community and did not need to change the park 's name " to prove their fidelity to the monarchy . A bowling green and tennis courts were completed by 1910 , along with the main oval which was used for state school sports . In 1919 , the council held a competition for the design of the York Park sports ground , the winner to receive £ 20 . The final design had to include two full sized tennis courts , a bowling green , a cycling track , cricket and football grounds with dressing rooms and facilities for spectators . Although not fully complete , York Park was officially opened by the St Andrews Caledonian Society on 1 January 1921 . A cycling track surrounding the perimeter fence was in use by September of the same year . On 4 May 1923 The Examiner reported on that " Work on the grandstand was completed for the opening of the 1923 football season , when the game was transferred from the NTCA Ground to York Park . Work on the grandstand and the seating round the oval has been proceeded with at top speed , and spectators at the game tomorrow should have little to complain of . " The first game between teams representing the northern and southern halves of Tasmania took place at the oval in August 1923 in front of a crowd of 9 @,@ 441 . A reporter from The Examiner commented : " The oval is in good order and well grassed and the new motor mower copes with the latter very effectively under favourable conditions . The whole five acres can be cut in six hours , as compared with twenty hours by the horse mower . " When the ground was harrowed , glass and other debris would surface ; a contemporary observer , John Orchard , later remembered : " they 'd line up a whole group of people , perhaps thirty or forty players , and we 'd go along with a container alongside each other and we 'd pick up everything that was likely to hurt a player . " 
 Heavy floods in 1929 caused substantial damage to the ground , destroying the cycling track , which was subsequently rebuilt . In the 1930s the Launceston Football Club , who played regularly at the ground , won six consecutive premierships before World War II intervened . As a consequence of the war NTFA matches were canceled after the 1941 season , not to resume until May 1945 . Three years later , 12 ornamental trees were planted at the ground , in memory of NTFA players who had lost their lives in the war . 
 In 1960 , York Park was the venue of a football match in which Tasmania defeated Victoria for the first time . The match was attended by a record crowd of approximately 15 @,@ 000 . Four years later , the southern stand ( demolished in 2004 ) was completed . In the 1970s another stand was added , capable of holding 650 spectators and incorporating sales kiosks and committee rooms . 
 Up to 1999 York Park had remained a sports ground used predominately for local events , generally attracting modest crowds ; according to ground manager Robert Groenewegen , supporters were able to " park [ their ] car [ s ] next to the boundary fence " . However , before the 1998 federal election the local member of parliament ( MP ) representing the Division of Bass , Warwick Smith — a minister from the ruling Liberal Party — promised public funding for the redevelopment of York Park . Although Smith lost his seat , the Liberals retained power and kept the promise . The $ 6 @.@ 4 million redevelopment completed in 2000 was the first major phase in the process of raising the ground to Australian Football League ( AFL ) standard . Work included the construction of the Gunns Stand , a two @-@ level grandstand originally holding 2 @,@ 500 ( now extended to 5 @,@ 700 ) which incorporates corporate facilities . Other improvements added were five 45 m ( 148 ft ) television standard light towers , a watering and drainage system able to disperse up to 100 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) of rain an hour , and 85 in @-@ ground sprinklers capable of rising 15 centimeters ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) . 
 In 2003 , the Government of Tasmania allocated $ 2 million to erect a roof above 6 @,@ 000 terrace seats , in readiness for the 2003 Rugby Union World Cup ; this meant that almost all of the seating area was protected from the weather . In 2004 , the ground became known as Aurora Stadium as the result of six @-@ year naming rights sponsorship deal with Aurora Energy . During 2006 , the state government supplied $ 150 @,@ 000 for new gates and ticket boxes at the stadium entry . The gates were later named after recently deceased Tasmanian Premier Jim Bacon . These gates , and the heritage @-@ listed Northern Stand , have been placed on the Tasmanian Heritage Register as culturally significant to the state . The two @-@ storey Cameron @-@ Tyson stand was in 2005 , replaced by an extension of the Gunns Stand . 
 In March 2008 , an arson attack destroyed part of the Northern Stand , causing between $ 300 @,@ 000 and $ 500 @,@ 000 damage . In December 2008 the Launceston City Council proposed a $ 7 million development for a replacement Northern Stand . The project includes the relocation of the old Northern Stand 's heritage roof into part of the redevelopment of facilities at Invermay Park . The old structure at York Park will be replaced with a 2 @,@ 125 @-@ seat grandstand which will include three AFL compliant <unk> , an AFL umpire <unk> , a corporate facility for 936 people in corporate boxes , suites and function rooms , coaches boxes , along with statistician , timekeepers and print media rooms . Post @-@ match press conference , drug testing , and radio rooms will also be included . The stand has increased the ground 's capacity to 21 @,@ 000 and the seating capacity to 13 @,@ 825 . The Australian Government was expected to contribute $ 4 million , the Tasmanian Government $ 2 million and Launceston City Council $ 500 @,@ 000 . The Hawthorn Football Club are currently asking for a " sizeable " contribution from the AFL towards the development , and Inveresk Precinct Authority chairman Robin McKendrick has indicated that a contribution of $ 1 million was possible .

 Australian rules football is the main sport played at the stadium which has hosted Australian Football League ( AFL ) games since 2001 , when the state government started paying interstate clubs to relocate their home games . Melbourne @-@ based Hawthorn played one game in 2001 and two in 2002 , and in 2003 were joined by another Melbourne team , St Kilda . In 2004 , it was estimated that the cost to the government per game was between $ 300 @,@ 000 and $ 500 @,@ 000 , but Tasmanian Premier Jim Bacon stated that the government was making a profit on its investment , estimating that each game injected between $ 1 million and $ 1 @.@ 5 million into the Tasmanian economy . 
 The number of AFL matches peaked in 2006 , when Hawthorn played three home games and one pre @-@ season game , while St Kilda played two home games . The games drew an average crowd of 17 @,@ 108 , with a record attendance of 20 @,@ 971 for the match between Hawthorn and Richmond . 
 Controversy occurred at York Park when , in a game between St Kilda and Fremantle , the final siren was too quiet to be heard by any of the umpires ; play was restarted in error , and in the subsequent confusion St Kilda levelled the scores . After a protest , the AFL Commission convened and overturned the result , awarding Fremantle the victory . The stadium 's sirens have since been replaced , and the old ones will be put on display at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery . 
 In 2007 York Park benefitted from a five @-@ year , $ 16 @.@ 4 million sponsorship of Hawthorn by the state government . Under the sponsorship agreement the stadium is the venue for five of Hawthorn 's matches each year — one pre @-@ season and four premiership games . Hawthorn president Jeff Kennett has expressed interest in his club playing higher profile teams , such as Collingwood , at the stadium . 
 As well as being an AFL venue , York Park is the long @-@ term base of North Launceston , and thus hosts regular Tasmanian State League matches . The ground also hosted occasional Tasmanian Devils Football Club home games in the Victorian Football League , from 2001 until the club 's demise in 2008 .

 York Park hosted its first international sporting fixture in the group phase of the 2003 Rugby Union World Cup , when Romania and Namibia played in front of 15 @,@ 457 spectators . As a soccer venue the stadium has hosted one National Soccer League match and three A @-@ League pre @-@ season games . Melbourne Knights and Perth Glory played a national league match at the stadium during the 2001 – 02 NSL season . In July 2006 , after the A @-@ League replaced the NSL , the stadium hosted Tasmania 's first A @-@ League match when Melbourne Victory and Adelaide United played in the pre @-@ season competition . In 2007 , 8 @,@ 061 attended the corresponding match , which has since become a regular fixture . In addition to pre @-@ season matches , Aurora Stadium has also hosted regular season A @-@ League matches : on 1 February 2012 , Melbourne Victory played Gold Coast United FC in a regular season A @-@ League game in front of a crowd of 5 @,@ 268 people and on 12 January 2013 , Melbourne Victory played against Central Coast Mariners in front of a crowd of 6 @,@ 238 people . Inveresk Precinct Authority chairman Robin McKendrick has stated that ground authorities are attempting to win hosting rights for Australian national soccer team matches . 
 Among non @-@ sporting events , before its redevelopment the stadium hosted an Ike & Tina Turner concert and a Billy Graham religious revival meeting . The <unk> Demons performed at the stadium during 2006 and March 2008 . Elton John performed at York Park during his Rocket Man Solo Tour at the end of 2007 ; this remains his only appearance in Tasmania as of August 2009 .

 York Park is an oval @-@ shaped grassed arena surrounded by several different stands , the largest being the two @-@ tier Gunns Stand on the ground 's western side . The stand originally had a capacity of 2 @,@ 500 , which was increased by an extension in 2005 to 5 @,@ 700 . The stand has two corporate box areas , the Gunns Function Centre and the Corporate Function Centre . Immediately north of the Stand is the Aurora Function Centre , which also houses coaches ' boxes , and is next to the heritage listed Northern Stand connecting the Northern , Southern and Eastern Terraces . The stands have a collective capacity of 6 @,@ 000 , bringing the ground 's total seating to 11 @,@ 700 . The Railway Workers Hill is a small , uncovered stand located at the eastern side of the ground between the Northern and Eastern Terraces . The ground has a parking capacity of approximately 2 @,@ 500 , from the use of large grassy areas at the adjacent Inveresk site , with an option of street parking . 
 York Park has often been criticised for its large playing surface , which is blamed for producing unattractive low @-@ scoring football . Prior to the start of 2009 , only 11 of 28 matches saw a score beyond 100 points . For a pre @-@ season match in 2009 , 13 metres of width was removed from the outer wing " in a bid to produce more attractive games . " Before the match , Groenewegen said , " Because that outer wing was so wide , once they [ a team ] chipped wide out there it was very easy for teams to flood back because you were so far away from the goals . " The ground is also known for its strong wind , which hinders the accuracy of long @-@ distance kicks that are propelled high into the air . 
 A grant of $ 50 @,@ 000 from the Tasmanian Community Fund in 2005 helped the Launceston City Council and AFL Tasmania construct a permanent Tasmanian Football Hall of Fame at York Park . The ground was chosen as the site because it is regarded as the home of Australian rules football in Tasmania . AFL Tasmania initiated the Hall of Fame nomination process , and since 2005 various clubs , players and grounds have been inducted . The Hall of Fame opened to the public on 21 February 2009 .

 = Birkebeineren Ski Stadium = 
 Birkebeineren Ski Stadium ( Norwegian : Birkebeineren <unk> ) is a cross @-@ country skiing and biathlon venue located in Lillehammer , Norway . Situated 3 kilometers ( 2 mi ) from the town center and at 485 meters ( 1 @,@ 591 ft ) above mean sea level , it has two stadium areas , one for cross @-@ country and one for biathlon . The former has a capacity for 31 @,@ 000 spectators , and the latter for 13 @,@ 500 . The venue was built for the 1994 Winter Olympics , costing 83 @.@ 6 million Norwegian krone ( NOK ) . It was subsequently used by the 1994 Winter Paralympics for Paralympic Nordic skiing and Paralympic biathlon . After the games , ownership was transferred to the municipal Lillehammer Olympiapark . The venue has since been used for one Biathlon World Cup , three FIS Cross @-@ Country World Cup and nine FIS Nordic Combined World Cup tournaments , the latter with the ski jumping competition taking place at the nearby Lysgårdsbakkene Ski Jumping Arena . Birkebeineren is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The location of the venue was decided in January 1990 , following Lillehammer 's successful bid to host the 1994 Winter Olympics . Construction was managed by the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee ( LOOC ) . Architects were <unk> Arkitekter and the main consultant was <unk> & <unk> . Construction started in early 1991 , before planning was completed , and lasted until 1993 . The construction work was subcontracted to several companies . Landscaping was completed in 1994 . The facilities used concrete and wood as the main materials . The stadium included 3 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ meter ( 32 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of temporary buildings , a 1 @,@ 620 @-@ square @-@ meter ( 17 @,@ 400 sq ft ) building converted to a riding center after the Olympics , and a 3 @,@ 200 @-@ square @-@ meter ( 34 @,@ 000 sq ft ) tent . The land around the venue is a swamp , and most of the surface soil had to be removed and replaced with harder earth . The soil was used as fertilizer or fill in other parts of the arena . A creek had to be bypassed with a 220 meters ( 720 ft ) long pipe . The arena is also so flat that a drainage system had to be installed . After the Olympics , four temporary overpasses were removed . Construction of the tracks was done to minimize the impact on the forest . 
 The venue cost NOK 83 @.@ 6 million , and was inaugurated on 28 November 1992 with an international biathlon competition . In December 1992 , the LOOC stated that they wanted to upgrade the stadium spectator capacity , but that the transport systems would not allow more people . In 1993 , the stadium had World Cup tournaments in biathlon and cross @-@ country skiing as a trial before the Olympics . During several events , the computer system controlling the scoreboard and television scores collapsed . President Johan Baumann of the Norwegian Ski Federation criticized the venue and demanded that a new stadium be built . He stated that the stadium had been built to optimize television pictures , and that it had insufficient facilities for the spectators . In particular , he criticized the fact that the spectators were too far away from the skiers and the lack of a television screen and more scoreboards . In May , the LOOC announced that the stadium would be expanded for another 6 @,@ 000 people before the Olympics . On 7 September , the ownership of the venue was transferred from the LOOC to Lillehammer Municipality via the subsidiary Lillehammer Olympiavekst , which later changed its name to Lillehammer Olympiapark . In October , the forest along the tracks were partially cleared to allow spectators without tickets to watch the events . 
 = = Facilities = = 
 The arena covers an area of 200 hectares ( 490 acres ) , and is 3 kilometers ( 2 mi ) from the town center . For the Olympics , 27 kilometers ( 17 mi ) of cross @-@ country tracks and 9 kilometers ( 5 @.@ 6 mi ) of biathlon tracks were built . There are two stadiums , one for cross @-@ country skiing and one for biathlon . The former has a spectator capacity for 31 @,@ 000 , while the latter has a capacity for 13 @,@ 500 . In addition , up to 75 @,@ 000 people watched the events the trackside during the Olympics . Permanent buildings include a 214 @-@ square @-@ meter ( 2 @,@ 300 sq ft ) finishing house for biathlon , a 155 @-@ square @-@ meter ( 1 @,@ 670 sq ft ) finishing house for cross @-@ country , a 355 @-@ square @-@ meter ( 3 @,@ 820 sq ft ) plant room . The cross @-@ country stadium is 200 square meters ( 2 @,@ 200 sq ft ) long , while the biathlon stadium is 150 square meters ( 1 @,@ 600 sq ft ) long . The biathlon stadium has 30 shooting stations . The facility has a 1 @,@ 250 kVA transformer , with an additional transformer used during the Olympics . Critical systems , such as computers and time @-@ keeping equipment , have an uninterruptible power supply . 
 As a recreational venue , Birkebeineren connects to 450 kilometers ( 280 mi ) of skiing tracks , including a 5 kilometers ( 3 mi ) lighted track which is lit until 22 : 00 every day during winter , and is open to the public . During the summer , the tracks are available for jogging , running , roller skiing and similar activities . There is a café between the two stadiums , which also have dressing rooms and showers . The biathlon venue can be rented to hold private biathlon competition , with or without skis . 
 The dominant means of transport during the Olympics was by railway . Spectators heading to Birkebeineren were transported by train to <unk> Station on the Dovre Line , and would then be transported by shuttle bus to the stadium . In addition , spectators from certain areas were transported by bus directly to the stadium . 
 = = Events = = 
 During the 1994 Winter Olympics , the venue hosted ten cross @-@ country skiing events , six biathlon events and two Nordic combined events . Over 203 @,@ 000 people applied for the 31 @,@ 000 seats for the relay . During the 1994 Winter Paralympics , the venue hosted the Paralympic Nordic skiing events and Paralympic biathlon . 
 The FIS Cross @-@ Country World Cup has been hosted three times , in 1993 , 2000 and 2002 , all in February or March . The FIS Nordic Combined World Cup has been hosted seven times at the stadium , in 1998 , 2000 , 2003 , 2005 , 2006 , 2009 and 2010 . All tournaments have been held in December , and have seen the ski jumping competition hosted at Lysgårdsbakken , the Olympic ski jumping hill in Lillehammer . Birkebeineren hosted Biathlon World Cup events from 1993 to 1997 . The stadium has also since 1992 been used as the goal area for Birkebeinerrennet , an annual ski marathon with thousands of participants . It has also hosted the Norwegian Nordic Ski Championships in 1993 . Lillehammer is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics .

 = Oil shale in Estonia = 
 Oil shale ( Estonian : <unk> ) is a strategic energy resource that constitutes about 4 % of Estonia 's gross domestic product . The oil shale industry in Estonia is one of the most developed in the world . In 2012 , the country 's oil shale industry employed 6 @,@ 500 people – about 1 % of the national workforce . Of all the oil shale fired power stations in the world , the two largest are in this country . In 2012 , 70 % of mined oil shale was used for electricity generation , accounting for about 85 % of Estonia 's total electricity production . A smaller proportion of the mined oil shale is used to produce shale oil , a type of synthetic oil extracted from shale by pyrolysis , which is sufficient to keep Estonia as the second largest shale oil producer in the world after China . In addition , oil shale and its products are used in Estonia for district heating and as a feedstock material for the cement industry . 
 There are two kinds of oil shale in Estonia , both of which are sedimentary rocks laid down during the Ordovician geologic period . Graptolitic argillite is the larger resource , but , because its organic matter content is relatively low , it is not used industrially . The other one is kukersite , which has been mined for almost a hundred years and is expected to last for another 25 – 30 years . By the end of 2012 , the total kukersite resource was 4 @.@ 8 billion tonnes , of which up to 650 million tonnes was recoverable . Kukersite deposits in Estonia account for 1 @.@ 1 % of global oil shale deposits . 
 In the 18th and 19th centuries , Estonian oil shale was described by several scientists and used as a low @-@ grade fuel . Its use in industry commenced in 1916 . Production of shale oil began in 1921 and oil shale was first used to generate electrical power in 1924 . Shortly thereafter , systematic research into oil shale and its products began , and in 1938 a department of mining was established at Tallinn Technical University . After World War II , Estonian oil shale gas was used in Saint Petersburg ( then called Leningrad ) and in northern cities in Estonia as a substitute for natural gas . Increased need for electricity in the north @-@ west of the Soviet Union led to the construction of large oil shale @-@ fired power stations . Oil shale extraction peaked in 1980 . Subsequently , the launch of nuclear reactors in Russia , particularly the Leningrad Nuclear Power Station , reduced demand for electricity produced from oil shale , and , along with a post @-@ Soviet restructuring of the industry in the 1990s , led to a decrease in oil shale mining . After decreasing for two decades , oil shale mining started to increase again at the beginning of the 21st century . 
 The industry continues to have a serious impact on the environment . In 2012 , it produced about 70 % of Estonia 's ordinary waste , 82 % of its hazardous waste , and more than 70 % of its greenhouse gas emissions . Its activities lower groundwater levels , alter water circulation , and spoil water quality . Water pumped from the mines and used by oil shale @-@ fired power stations exceeds 90 % of all water used in Estonia . <unk> from waste heaps pollute surface and groundwater . Former and current oil shale mines cover about one percent of Estonia 's territory .

 = = = Graptolitic argillite = = = 
 Estonian graptolitic argillite ( also known as dictyonema argillite , dictyonema oil shale , dictyonema shale or alum shale ) is a marine @-@ type of black shale , belonging to the <unk> @-@ type of oil shales . Although the name dictyonema argillite is widely used instead of graptolitic argillite , it is now considered a misnomer as the <unk> fossils in the rock , earlier considered <unk> , were reclassified during the 1980s as members of the genus <unk> . 
 Graptolitic argillite was formed some 480 million years ago during the Early Ordovician under a marine environment . In mainland Estonia , it occurs at the foot of the North Estonian Klint , ranging from the <unk> Peninsula to Narva in an area covering about 11 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 4 @,@ 200 sq mi ) . When findings in the western Estonian islands are included , its extent increases to about 12 @,@ 200 square kilometres ( 4 @,@ 700 sq mi ) . The thickness of the layer varies from less than 0 @.@ 5 metres ( 1 ft 8 in ) to a maximum of 8 metres ( 26 ft ) in western Estonia , and its depth below the surface varies from 10 to 90 metres ( 33 to 295 ft ) . 
 Resources of graptolitic argillite in Estonia have been estimated at 60 – 70 billion tonnes . Although resources of graptolitic argillite exceed that of kukersite , attempts to use it as an energy source have been unsuccessful due to its low calorific value and high sulfur content . Its organic content ranges from 10 to 20 % and its sulfur content from 2 to 4 % . Correspondingly , its calorific value is only 5 – 8 megajoules per kilogram ( MJ / kg ; 1 @,@ 200 – 1 @,@ 900 kcal / kg ) and its Fischer Assay oil yield is 3 – 5 % . However , the graptolitic argillite resource in Estonia contains a potential 2 @.@ 1 billion tonnes of oil . In addition , it contains 5 @.@ 67 million tonnes of uranium – making it one of the main potential sources of uranium in Europe – 16 @.@ 53 million tonnes of zinc , and 12 @.@ 76 million tonnes of molybdenum . There is as yet no economical and environmentally friendly technology to extract either the metals or the oil . 
 = = = Kukersite = = = 
 Kukersite is a light @-@ brown marine @-@ type Late Ordovician oil shale formed some 460 million years ago . It was named as <unk> by the Baltic German geologist Carl Friedrich Schmidt in the mid @-@ 19th century , and as kukersite by the Russian paleobotanist Mikhail <unk> in 1916 . The name reflects the German name for Kukruse Manor where oil shale samples were obtained . 
 Kukersite deposits in Estonia are the world 's second highest @-@ grade oil shale deposits after the Australian <unk> . Its organic content varies from 15 % to 55 % , averaging over 40 % . Correspondingly , its mean calorific value is 15 MJ / kg ( 3 @,@ 600 kcal / kg ) . The conversion ratio of its organic content into usable energy ( shale oil and oil shale gas ) is between 65 and 67 % , and its Fischer Assay oil yield is 30 to 47 % . 
 The principal organic component of kukersite is telalginite , which originated from the fossil green alga Gloeocapsomorpha prisca , deposited in a shallow marine basin . Kukersite lies at depths of 7 to 170 metres ( 23 to 558 ft ) . The most significant kukersite deposits in Estonia – the Estonian and the Tapa – cover about 3 @,@ 000 to 5 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 1 @,@ 200 to 1 @,@ 900 sq mi ) , and together with the Leningrad deposit ( an extension of the Estonian ) form the Baltic Oil Shale Basin . The Estonian deposit , which covers about 2 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 770 sq mi ) , is used industrially . It consists of 23 exploration and mining fields . The Tapa deposit is not accounted as a reserve due to its lower calorific value , which makes its extraction economically inexpedient . In northern Estonia there are 50 layers of kukersite ; the six lowest of these form a 2 @.@ 5 @-@ to @-@ 3 @-@ metre ( 8 ft 2 in to 9 ft 10 in ) thick mineable bed . In this area kukersite lies near the surface . To the south and west it lies deeper and its thickness and quality decrease . 
 According to the International Energy Agency , Estonia 's kukersite represents about 1 @.@ 1 % of global and 17 % of European oil shale resources . The total kukersite resources in Estonia are estimated to be about 4 @.@ 8 billion tonnes , including 1 @.@ 3 billion tonnes of economically proven and probable reserves . Economically proven and probable reserves consist of mineable deposits with energy ratings of at least 35 <unk> per square metre and calorific values of at least 8 MJ / kg , located in areas without environmental restrictions . Up to 650 million tonnes of economically proven and probable reserves are designated as recoverable .

 It is often reported that 18th @-@ century naturalist and explorer Johann Anton Güldenstädt had mentioned a discovery of a " burning rock " near Jõhvi in 1725 , but his published travel notes mention neither oil shale nor Estonia . It is also often reported that the earliest documented record of oil shale in Estonia , authored by the Baltic German publicist and linguist August Wilhelm <unk> , dates to 1777 . However , this is based on a misinterpretation of the German word <unk> ( meaning : stone oil ) , which was used by <unk> but which most likely did not mean oil shale in the context of his publication . 
 In the second half of the 18th century , the St. Petersburg Free Economic Society started to search for information about combustible minerals which as fuels would replace the decreasing stock of trees in the European part of Russia . As a result of these inquiries , the Society received information about a combustible mineral found at the Kohala Manor near Rakvere . According to the landlord of the Kohala estate , Baron Fabian Reinhold <unk> @-@ Sternberg , the ' burning rock ' was discovered at a depth of about ten meters when a spring was opened on the slope of a sandy hump , as it was during the digging of a well some years earlier on the same slope . This discovery was briefly mentioned in a paper prepared by the German chemist Johann Gottlieb Georgi and presented by the Actual State Councillor Anton @-@ Johann Engelhardt at the meeting of the Society in 1789 . The first scientific research into the rock 's oil yield , using samples from the Vanamõisa village of the Kohala Manor , was published by Georgi at the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1791 . In 1838 and 1839 , the Baltic German geologist Gregor von <unk> published a detailed description of the deposits of kukersite in Vanamõisa and graptolitic argillite in Keila @-@ <unk> . In 1838 he made a thorough experiment to distil oil from the Vanamõisa oil shale deposit . 
 During the 1850s , large @-@ scale works were undertaken in Estonia to transform excessively wet land into land suitable for agriculture ; this included the digging of drainage ditches . In the process , previously unknown layers of oil shale were discovered in several locations . In the years 1850 – 1857 , the territory of Estonia was explored by the Baltic German geologist Carl Friedrich Schmidt who studied these findings of oil shale . Russian chemist Aleksandr <unk> , who at the end of the 1860s had studied the composition and properties of oil shale originating from the Kukruse area , concluded it made sense to use oil shale for the production of gas and as a solid fuel . However , he considered shale oil production unprofitable . During the remainder of the 19th century oil shale was used locally as a low @-@ grade fuel only . For example , in the 1870s , Robert von Toll , landlord of the Kukruse Manor , started to use oil shale as a fuel for the manor 's distillery . There were failed attempts to use graptolitic argillite as fertilizer in the 19th century . In the beginning of the 20th century , geologist and engineer Carl August von <unk> studied self @-@ ignition of graptolitic argillite near Paldiski . At the University of Tartu oil shale geology and chemistry analyses were conducted during the 19th century by Georg Paul Alexander <unk> , Alexander Gustav von Schrenk , and Carl Ernst Heinrich Schmidt , among others . 
 = = = Beginning of oil shale industry = = = 
 Analysis of Estonian oil shale resources and mining possibilities intensified during the early 20th century while Estonia was part of the Russian Empire . Industrial development was under way in Saint Petersburg ( known as Petrograd in 1914 – 24 ) , but regional fuel resources were in short supply . A large shale oil extraction plant for processing Estonian oil shale was proposed in 1910 . The outbreak of World War I , coupled with a fuel supply crisis , accelerated the pace of the research . 
 In June 1916 , the Russian geologist Nikolay <unk> oversaw mining of the first tonnes of oil shale at Pavandu and delivered it to Saint Petersburg ( then Petrograd ) Polytechnic Institute for large @-@ scale experiments . These events marking the beginning of the Estonian oil shale industry took place more than half a century after an oil shale industry had emerged in Scotland , the leading oil shale industry in 1916 , and a decade before the industry emerged in China , which , besides Estonia , is today the other leading oil shale @-@ exploiting country . In 1916 a total of 640 – 690 tonnes of oil shale were sent to Saint Petersburg for testing . The tests proved that the oil shale was suitable for combustion as a solid fuel and for extraction of oil shale gas and shale oil . Based on these promising results , a plan for oil shale mining in Estonia was presented to the Emperor Nicholas II on 3 January 1917 . On 13 February 1917 , the Council of Ministers of Russia allocated 1 @.@ 2 million rubles to purchase land and start mining activities . After the February Revolution , the Russian Provisional Government appointed a special commissioner for oil shale purchasing and stockpiling who began preliminary work for the digging of an oil shale mine at Pavandu , with full @-@ scale construction carried out by about 500 workers , including war prisoners , in the summer of 1917 . After the October Revolution , financing ceased and construction stopped . Two private Saint Petersburg firms , established specially for oil shale mining , <unk> & Co. and <unk> & Co . , which in the fall of 1916 had begun surface mining at Kukruse and Järve , respectively , also terminated their mining activities in 1917 . 
 In February 1918 , the area surrounding the oil shale basin in northeast Estonia was occupied by German troops . During this occupation , mining activities were carried out at Pavandu by the German company Internationales <unk> ( English : International Construction Consortium ) , including sending oil shale to Germany for research and experimentation . This work used a retort constructed by Julius Pintsch AG , known as a Pintsch generator . In late 1918 , German forces left Estonia , by which time no more than a single trainload of oil shale had been mined and sent to Germany . 
 = = = Developments in interwar Estonia = = = 
 After Estonia gained independence , the state owned oil shale enterprise , Riigi Põlevkivitööstus ( English : Estonian State Oil Shale Industry ) , was established as a department of the Ministry for Trade and Industry on 24 November 1918 . The enterprise , later named <unk> Eesti Põlevkivitööstus ( English : First Estonian Oil Shale Industry ) , was the predecessor of Viru Keemia Grupp , one of the current shale oil producers in Estonia . It took over the existing Pavandu open @-@ pit mine , and opened new mines at Vanamõisa ( 1919 ) , Kukruse ( 1920 ) , and Käva ( 1924 ) . Also , several private investors , including investors from abroad , initiated oil shale industries in Estonia by opening mines at Kiviõli ( 1922 ) , Küttejõu ( 1925 ) , Ubja ( 1926 ) , <unk> ( 1936 ) , and Kohtla ( 1937 ) . Pavandu mine was closed in 1927 and Vanamõisa mine was closed in 1931 . While in 1918 only 16 tonnes and in 1919 only 9 @,@ 631 tonnes of oil shale were mined , in 1937 the annual output exceeded one million tonnes . In 1940 , the annual output reached 1 @,@ 891 @,@ 674 tonnes . 
 Initially , oil shale was used primarily in the cement industry , but also for firing locomotive furnaces and as a household fuel . The first major industrial consumers of oil shale were cement factories in Kunda and <unk> . By 1925 , all locomotives in Estonia were powered by oil shale . 
 Shale oil production started in Estonia in 1921 when Riigi Põlevkivitööstus built 14 experimental oil shale processing retorts in Kohtla @-@ Järve . These vertical retorts used the method developed by Julius Pintsch AG that would later evolve into the current Kiviter processing technology . Along with the shale oil extraction plant , an oil shale research laboratory was founded in 1921 . Following the experimental retorts , the first commercial shale oil plant was put into operation on 24 December 1924 . The German @-@ owned company Eesti Kiviõli ( German : <unk> <unk> , English : Estonian Stone Oil , predecessor of Kiviõli Keemiatööstus ) , affiliated with G. Scheel & Co. and Mendelssohn & Co . , was established in 1922 . By the end of 1930s , it had become the largest shale oil producer in Estonia . Around the company 's mine and oil plant , the Kiviõli settlement ( now town ) was formed in the same way as the Küttejõu settlement ( now district of Kiviõli ) formed around the mine owned by Eesti <unk> . In 1924 , the British investor @-@ owned Estonian Oil Development Syndicate Ltd . ( later Vanamõisa <unk> Ltd . ) purchased an open @-@ pit mine in Vanamõisa and opened a shale oil extraction plant that was abandoned in 1931 due to technical problems . The Swedish – Norwegian consortium <unk> <unk> ( Swedish : <unk> <unk> , English : Estonian Oil Consortium ) , controlled by Marcus Wallenberg , was founded in Sillamäe in 1926 . New Consolidated Gold Fields Ltd. of the United Kingdom built a shale oil extraction plant at Kohtla @-@ Nõmme in 1931 . This facility continued to operate until 1961 . 
 In 1934 , Eesti Kiviõli and New Consolidated Gold Fields established the service station chain <unk> <unk> ( now : <unk> ) in Finland , which in 1940 sold more shale @-@ oil @-@ derived gasoline in Finland than did the entire conventional gasoline market in Estonia . Since 1935 , Estonian shale oil has been supplied to the German Kriegsmarine as a ship fuel . In 1938 , 45 % of Estonian shale oil was exported , accounting for 8 % of Estonia 's total exports . Although the price of oil shale @-@ based gasoline was at least triple that of global gasoline prices , high production and bilateral agreements with Germany facilitated its export . In 1939 , Estonia produced 181 @,@ 000 tonnes of shale oil , including 22 @,@ 500 tonnes of oil that were suitable gasoline equivalents . The mining and oil industry employed 6 @,@ 150 persons . 
 The oil shale @-@ fired electrical power industry started in 1924 when the Tallinn Power Station switched to oil shale . In 1933 , it reached a capacity of 22 megawatts ( MW ) . Other oil shale @-@ fired power stations were built in <unk> ( 3 @.@ 7 MW ) , Kohtla ( 3 @.@ 7 MW ) , Kunda ( 2 @.@ 3 MW ) , and Kiviõli ( 0 @.@ 8 MW ) . At the beginning of World War II , the total capacity of oil shale @-@ fired power stations was 32 @.@ 5 MW . Only the Tallinn and <unk> power stations were connected to the grid . 
 On 9 May 1922 the first international discussion of Estonian kukersite took place at the 64th meeting of the Institution of Petroleum Technologists . Systematic research into oil shale and its products began at Tartu University 's Oil Shale Research Laboratory in 1925 , initiated by professor Paul <unk> . In 1937 , the Geological Committee under the Ministry of Economic Affairs , and the Institute of Natural Resources , an independent academic institution , were established . A department of mining was established at Tallinn Technical University in 1938 . Estonian oil shale industries conducted tests of oil shale samples from Australia , Bulgaria , Germany and South Africa . 
 = = = Developments in German @-@ occupied Estonia = = = 
 Soon after the Soviet occupation in 1940 , the entire oil shale industry was nationalised and subordinated to the Mining Office and later to the General Directorate of Mining and Fuel Industry of the Peoples ' Commissariat for Light Industry . Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 and the industry 's infrastructure was largely destroyed by retreating Soviet forces . During the subsequent German occupation , the industry was merged into a company named Baltische Öl GmbH . Baltische Öl became the largest industry in the Estonian territory . This entity was subordinated to <unk> Öl , a company that had exclusive rights to oil production in German @-@ occupied territories . 
 The primary purpose of the industry was production of oil for the German Army . In 1943 , after the German troops retreated from the Caspian oil region , Estonian oil shale became increasingly important . On 16 March 1943 , Hermann Göring issued a secret order stating that " development and utilisation of Estonian oil shale industry is the most important military @-@ economic task in the territories of the former Baltic states " . On 21 June 1943 , Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler issued an order to send as many male Jews as possible to the oil shale mining . 
 Baltische Öl consisted of five units ( Kiviõli , Küttejõu , Kohtla @-@ Järve , Sillamäe , and Kohtla ) , all of which were partially restored , previously existing industries . In addition , Baltische Öl started construction of a new mining and shale oil extraction complex in Ahtme , but it never became operational . Prisoners of war and forced labour made up about two @-@ thirds of the work force in these units . 
 While Soviet troops were advancing into Estonia during 1944 , about 200 Estonian oil shale specialists were evacuated to <unk> , Germany , to work at an oil shale industry there , codenamed Operation Desert ( Unternehmen <unk> ) . Shale oil extraction plants in Estonia were destroyed and mines were ignited or inundated by the retreating Germans . Existing oil shale @-@ fired power stations were also destroyed . 
 = = = Developments in Soviet Estonia = = = 
 In 1945 – 1946 the mining industry was merged into Eesti Põlevkivi ( Russian : <unk> , English : Estonian Oil Shale , now Eesti Energia Kaevandused ) under the General Directorate of Oil Shale Industry of the USSR ( <unk> ) . Shale oil extraction , except the Kiviõli and Kohtla @-@ Nõmme plants , was merged into the Kohtla @-@ Järve shale oil <unk> ( Russian : <unk> , now Viru Keemia Grupp ) under the General Directorate of Synthetic Liquid Fuel and Gas of the USSR ( <unk> ) . Both organisations were directed from Moscow . 
 New mines were opened in Ahtme ( 1948 ) , Jõhvi ( No. 2 , 1949 ) , Sompa ( 1949 ) , Tammiku ( 1951 ) , and in the area between Käva and Sompa ( No. 4 , 1953 ) . The Küttejõu open @-@ pit mine was closed in 1947 and the Küttejõu underground mine was merged with the Kiviõli mine in 1951 . The Ubja mine was closed in 1959 . After construction of large oil shale @-@ fired power stations , demand for oil shale increased and consequently new larger mines were constructed : the underground mines Viru ( 1965 ) and Estonia ( 1972 ) along with the open @-@ pit mines Sirgala ( 1963 ) , Narva ( 1970 ) and <unk> ( 1974 ; later named Aidu ) . Correspondingly , several exhausted smaller mines like Kukruse ( 1967 ) , Käva ( 1972 ) , No. 2 ( 1973 ) , No. 4 ( 1975 ) , and Kiviõli ( 1987 ) were closed . The Estonia Mine became the largest oil shale mine in the world . Because of the success of oil shale @-@ based power generation , Estonian oil shale mining peaked in 1980 at 31 @.@ 35 million tonnes , and in the same year power generation peaked at 18 @.@ 9 TWh . The industry declined during the subsequent two decades . Demand for electric power generated from oil shale decreased following construction of nuclear power stations in the Russian SFSR , particularly the Leningrad Nuclear Power Station . At the end of 1988 , a fire broke out in the Estonia Mine . The largest underground fire in Estonia , it continued for 81 days and caused serious pollution of ground and surface waters . 
 The shale oil industry at Kohtla @-@ Järve and Kiviõli was redeveloped . In 1945 , the first tunnel kiln was restored , and by the end of the 1940s four tunnel kilns located in Kiviõli and Kohtla @-@ Nõmme had been restored . German prisoners of war contributed most of the labour . Between 1946 and 1963 , 13 Kiviter @-@ type retorts were built in Kohtla @-@ Järve and eight in Kiviõli . In 1947 , a pilot Galoter retort was built at the <unk> engineering plant in Tallinn . This unit , in operation until 1956 , was capable of processing 2 @.@ 5 tonnes of oil shale per day and was used for modelling the next generation of commercial @-@ scale retorts . The first Galoter @-@ type commercial @-@ scale pilot retorts were built at Kiviõli in 1953 and 1963 with capacities of 200 and 500 tonnes of oil shale per day , respectively . The first of these retorts closed in 1963 and the second in 1981 . The Narva Oil Plant , annexed to the Eesti Power Station and operating two Galoter @-@ type 3 @,@ 000 @-@ tonnes @-@ per day retorts , was commissioned in 1980 . Started as a pilot plant , the process of converting it to a commercial @-@ scale plant took about 20 years . 
 In 1948 an oil shale gas plant in Kohtla @-@ Järve became operational , and for several decades the oil shale gas was used as a substitute for natural gas in Saint Petersburg ( then known as Leningrad ) and in northern Estonian cities . It was the first time in history that synthetic gas from oil shale was used in households . To enable delivery of the gas , a 200 @-@ kilometre ( 120 mi ) pipeline from Kohtla @-@ Järve to Saint <unk> was built , followed by a 150 @-@ kilometre ( 93 mi ) pipeline from Kohtla @-@ Järve to Tallinn . During the 1950s , unsuccessful tests of oil shale underground gasification were conducted at Kiviõli . In 1962 and 1963 , the conversion of oil shale gas into ammonium was tested ; however , for industrial production , oil shale gas was replaced with natural gas . Although this gas had become uneconomical by 1958 , production continued and was even expanded . After peaking in 1976 at 597 @.@ 4 million cubic metres ( 21 @.@ 10 × 10 ^ 9 cu ft ) , ceased in 1987 . In total , 276 generators were operated for the gas production . 
 In 1949 , the 48 MW Kohtla @-@ Järve Power Station – the first power station in the world to use pulverised oil shale at an industrial scale – was commissioned , followed by the 72 @.@ 5 MW Ahtme Power Station in 1951 . To ensure sufficient electricity supply in Estonia , Latvia and north @-@ west Russia , the Balti Power Station ( 1 @,@ 430 MW ) and the Eesti Power Station ( 1 @,@ 610 MW ) were built , the former between 1959 and 1971 and the latter between 1969 and 1973 . The stations , collectively known as the Narva Power Stations , are the world 's two largest oil shale @-@ fired power stations . In 1988 Moscow @-@ based authorities planned a third oil shale @-@ fired power station in Narva with a capacity of 2 @,@ 500 MW , together with a new mine at <unk> . The plan , disclosed at the time of the <unk> War and the Singing Revolution , met with strong local opposition and was never implemented . 
 Between 1946 and 1952 , uranium compounds were extracted from locally mined graptolitic argillite at the Sillamäe Processing Plant ( now : <unk> ) . More than 60 tonnes of uranium compounds ( corresponding to 22 @.@ 5 tonnes of elemental uranium ) were produced . Some sources note that uranium produced in Sillamäe was used for construction of the first Soviet atomic bomb ; however , this information is not confirmed by the archive materials . 
 An oil shale research institute ( now a department within Tallinn University of Technology ) was founded at Kohtla @-@ Järve in 1958 . Preliminary research into oil shale @-@ based chemical production began the same year , exploring the potential for the use of oil shale in bitumen , synthetic construction materials , detergents , synthetic leathers , synthetic fibres , plastics , paints , soaps , glues , and pesticides . Between 1959 and 1985 , 5 @.@ 275 billion cubic metres ( 186 @.@ 3 × 10 ^ 9 cu ft ) of mineral wool were produced from oil shale coke , a solid residue of oil shale . In 1968 , a branch of the <unk> Institute of Mining was established in Kohtla @-@ Järve , and in 1984 the scientific @-@ technical journal Oil Shale was founded in Estonia . 
 = = = Developments in independent Estonia = = = 
 In the 1990s , after Estonia regained independence , the country underwent a restructuring of the economy , causing the collapse of a large part of the heavy industry sector . This collapse led to a decrease in the consumption of electricity and thus a decrease in the need for the oil shale that was mined to produce it . Electricity and shale oil export to former Soviet markets largely ceased . Due to a decrease in demand , the Tammiku and Sompa mines closed in 1999 and those at Kohtla and Ahtme closed in 2001 . 
 In 1995 , state @-@ owned shale oil producers in Kohtla @-@ Järve and Kiviõli were merged into the single company named RAS Kiviter . In 1997 , Kiviter was privatized and a year later it declared insolvency . Its factories in Kohtla @-@ Järve and Kiviõli were sold separately and new oil producers – Viru Keemia Grupp and Kiviõli Keemiatööstus – emerged . 
 In 1995 , the Government of Estonia started negotiations with American company NRG Energy to create a joint venture on the basis of the Narva Power Stations , the largest consumer of oil shale in Estonia . As a part of the deal , 51 % of the government @-@ owned shares in the oil shale mining company Eesti Põlevkivi was transferred to the Narva Power Stations . The proposed deal with NRG Energy met a strong public and political opposition and was cancelled after NRG Energy failed the deadline to secure financing for the project . Consequently , the Government transferred its remained shares in Eesti Põlevkivi to a state @-@ owned company Eesti Energia , a parent company of the Narva Power Stations , and Eesti Põlevkivi became a fully owned subsidiary of Eesti Energia . 
 Oil shale production started to increase again in the beginning of the 21st century . In 2000 , the open @-@ pit mines at <unk> , Sirgala and Narva were merged into the single Narva open @-@ pit mine . Since 2003 , several new mines were opened : the <unk> @-@ Kiviõli open @-@ pit mine in 2003 , the Ubja open @-@ pit mine in 2005 , and the Ojamaa underground mine in 2010 . By 2006 , after 90 years of major mining in Estonia , the total amount of mined oil shale reached one billion tonnes . The exhausted Aidu open @-@ pit mine was closed in 2012 , followed a year later by the Viru underground mine . 
 In 2004 , two power units with circulating fluidised bed combustion boilers were put into operation at the Narva Power Stations . Construction of the Auvere Power Station , located next to the existing Eesti Power Station , began in 2012 . In the end of 2012 , the Ahtme Power Station was closed . 
 In 2008 , Eesti Energia established a joint venture , Enefit Outotec Technology , with the Finnish technology company Outotec . The venture sought to develop and commercialise a modified Galoter process – the Enefit process – that would enhance the existing technology by using circulating fluidised beds . In 2013 , Enefit Outotec Technology opened an Enefit testing plant in Frankfurt . 
 Kiviõli Keemiatööstus began to test two Galoter @-@ type retorts in 2006 . Eesti Energia opened a new generation Galoter @-@ type plant using Enefit 280 technology in 2012 . VKG Oil opened three new Galoter @-@ type oil plants called <unk> correspondingly in December 2009 , in October 2014 , and in November 2015 . In January 2016 , the company announced that due to low oil price , it will close the old oil plants using Kiviter technology and lay off 500 workers .

 The National Development Plan for the Utilisation of Oil Shale 2008 – 2015 describes oil shale as a strategic energy resource . Other mineral resources in Estonia that are mined currently are peat , dolostone , clays , limestone , sand and gravel . Potentially mineable resources include granite , iron ore and <unk> . 
 The oil shale industry in Estonia is one of the most developed in the world . Estonia is the only country in the world that uses oil shale as its primary energy source . In 2012 , oil shale supplied 70 % of Estonia 's total primary energy and accounted for 4 % of Estonia 's gross domestic product . About 6 @,@ 500 people ( 1 @.@ 1 % of the workforce in Estonia ) were directly employed in the oil shale industry . In 2012 , the state revenue from oil shale production was about € 90 million , including € 34 million of excise duty and labour taxes , and € 56 million of environmental charges . There are no royalties . The operating profit of shale oil producers was about € 91 million . 
 In 2011 , about one @-@ third of Estonian public research , development and demonstration expenditures ( € 3 @.@ 1 million ) went to the oil shale sector . A new development plan for 2016 – 2030 is at a preparatory stage . 
 = = = Mining = = = 
 Estonia has adopted a national development plan that limits the annual mining of oil shale to 20 million tonnes . At this rate , mineable reserves will last for 25 – 30 years . In 2012 , 15 @.@ 86 million tonnes of oil shale were mined . Mining losses were about four million tonnes . As of 2014 , five oil shale mines are in operation ; three are open @-@ pit mines and two are underground mines . The mines are owned by four companies . Plans for opening several new mines are in the preparatory phase . Historically , the ratio of underground mining to open @-@ pit mining has been approximately even , but as usable deposits close to the surface become scarcer , underground mining will probably increase . 
 The Estonia underground mine at Väike @-@ <unk> , operated by state owned Eesti Energia Kaevandused , is the largest oil shale mine in the world . The other underground mine , operated by privately owned Viru Keemia Grupp , is located at Ojamaa . Both mines use the room and pillar mining method . Oil shale mined at Ojamaa is transported to the processing plant by a unique 13 @-@ kilometre ( 8 @.@ 1 mi ) conveyor belt . Although there are similar conveyors in operation in other countries , the one at Ojamaa is an unusually challenging installation since its path contains many curves and sharp turns . 
 The Narva open @-@ pit mine is operated by Eesti Energia Kaevandused , and the <unk> @-@ Kiviõli open @-@ pit mine is operated by privately owned Kiviõli Keemiatööstus . Both mines use highly selective extraction in three layers of seams . The Narva mine uses a technology that involves breaking up both the overburden and the targeted deposits by blasting and then stripping the rock with relatively large @-@ bucket ( 10 – 35 cubic metres or 350 – 1 @,@ 240 cubic feet ) excavators . The third open @-@ pit mine , operated by Kunda Nordic <unk> which belongs to German <unk> group , is located at Ubja . 
 In 2012 , 70 % of mined oil shale was used for electricity production , 27 % for shale oil production , and 3 % for thermal energy , cement and chemical products . 
 = = = Electricity and heat generation = = = 
 The National Development Plan for the Utilisation of Oil Shale 2008 – 2015 prioritises oil shale as a resource for ensuring Estonia 's electricity supply and energy security . However , the share of oil shale in Estonia 's electricity and heat production is set to decrease due to the European Union 's climate policy as well as the country 's recognition of the environmental impact of oil shale @-@ fired power stations and need to diversify the national energy balance . Although Estonia has the right to allocate a gradually decreasing limited number of emission allowances free of charge , this will be phased out by 2020 . According to the International Energy Agency , Estonia should adopt the energy strategy in order to reduce the share of oil shale in the primary energy supply by improving the efficiency of shale @-@ fired power stations and increasing the use of other energy sources such as renewable energy and natural gas . 
 In 2012 , 70 % of oil shale mined in Estonia was used for power generation , and about 85 % of Estonia 's electricity was generated from oil shale . About 29 % of produced electricity was exported to Finland , Latvia , and Lithuania . 
 Eesti Energia owns the largest oil shale @-@ fuelled power stations ( Narva Power Stations ) in the world . In addition , a new 300 MW station , which will use circulating fluidised bed boiler technology , is under construction in Auvere . 
 In 2010 , 11 @.@ 4 % of the heat supply in Estonia was generated by direct combustion of oil shale and 5 @.@ 88 % by combustion of shale oil . Shale oil was used as a fuel by 9 @.@ 36 % of all boiler houses in Estonia . Heat produced by co @-@ generation at the Balti Power Station is used for district heating of Narva , the third largest city in Estonia with 58 @,@ 700 inhabitants ( 2013 ) . The co @-@ generation plants in Kohtla @-@ Järve , Sillamäe , and Kiviõli burn oil shale to produce electrical power and supply district heating to nearby towns . In addition to raw oil shale , the Kohtla @-@ Järve Power Station uses oil shale gas , a by @-@ product of shale oil production , for the same purposes . 
 = = = Shale oil extraction = = = 
 In 2008 , Estonia was the second largest shale oil producer in the world after China . Production was 651 @,@ 000 tonnes of shale oil in 2012 . Up to 78 % of produced shale oil was exported , mainly to European countries , as bunker fuel and refinery feedstocks ; the remainder is used mainly for district heating . 
 There are three shale @-@ oil producers in Estonia . In 2012 , VKG Oil ( a subsidiary of Viru Keemia Grupp ) produced 370 @,@ 000 tonnes of shale oil , Eesti Energia <unk> ( a subsidiary of Eesti Energia ) produced 211 @,@ 000 tonnes , and Kiviõli Keemiatööstus ( a subsidiary of <unk> Energia ) produced 70 @,@ 000 tonnes . Two processes – the Kiviter process and the Galoter process – are in use for shale oil extraction . Eesti Energia <unk> uses the Galoter process while VKG Oil and Kiviõli Keemiatööstus use both – Kiviter and Galoter processes . 
 = = = Cement production = = = 
 Spent shale , a solid residue of oil shale , is used for Portland cement production at the Kunda Nordic <unk> factory . In 2002 , 10 @,@ 013 tonnes of spent shale were used for cement production . VKG <unk> , a subsidiary of Viru Keemia Grupp , produces building blocks by using oil shale ash and spent shale , and plans to construct a cement factory . The mined waste rock is used for road construction . 
 = = Environmental impact = = 
 = = = Wastes and land usage = = = 
 The mining and processing of about one billion tonnes of oil shale in Estonia has created about 360 @-@ 370 million tonnes of solid waste . Combustion ashes are the largest component ( 200 million tonnes ) , followed by mining waste ( 90 million tonnes ) and spent shale ( mainly semi @-@ coke , 70 – 80 million tonnes ) . According to the European Union waste list , oil shale ash and spent shale are classified as hazardous waste . In addition , approximately 73 million tonnes of graptolitic argillite as overlying deposit were mined and piled in waste heaps in the process of phosphorite – ore mining near <unk> in 1964 – 1991 . 
 In 2012 , the oil shale industry produced 70 % of Estonia 's ordinary waste and 82 % of its hazardous waste . Nine million tonnes of mining waste , eight million tonnes of oil shale ash , and one million tonnes of semi @-@ coke were generated . Due to the oil shale industry , Estonia ranks first among the European Union countries by generated waste per capita . About four million tonnes of oil shale are lost per year during mining ; combined with losses incurred during the enrichment process , more than 30 % of the resource is lost . Although the oil shale development plan sets the more efficient use of oil shale as a goal , mining losses have not decreased in 2007 – 2011 . 
 The oil shale waste heaps pose a spontaneous ignition risk due to their remaining organic content . The waste material , particularly semi @-@ coke , contains pollutants including sulphates , heavy metals , and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) , some of which are toxic and carcinogenic . 
 As a result of decades of mining activity , the topography of the oil shale region has changed ; this includes a greater range of altitudes within the mined area . Former and current oil shale mines occupy about 1 % of Estonia 's territory . About 500 square kilometres ( 190 sq mi ) or 15 % of Ida @-@ Viru County 's territory is out of use due to open @-@ pit mines and waste landfills ; an additional 150 square kilometres ( 58 sq mi ) has sunk or become unstable due to underground mining . As of 2006 , semi @-@ coke heaps near Kohtla @-@ Järve and Kiviõli covered 180 – 200 hectares ( 440 – 490 acres ) and ash heaps near Narva covered 210 hectares ( 520 acres ) . These heaps protruding from the flat landscape are regarded as landmarks and as monuments to the area 's industrial heritage . 
 There is less biodiversity within the mined area ; in particular , the reclaimed and reforested areas have less biodiversity than the areas which have undergone a natural succession . 
 = = = Water usage and pollution = = = 
 Surface water flows into mines and accumulates along with groundwater . This water must be pumped out in order for mining to proceed . The water that is pumped from the mines and the coolant water used by oil shale @-@ fired power stations combined exceeds 90 % of all water used in Estonia . For each cubic meter of oil shale mined in Estonia , 14 – 18 cubic metres ( 490 – 640 cu ft ) of water must be pumped from the mines , amounting to about 227 million cubic metres ( 184 @,@ 000 acre · ft ) that are pumped from mines annually . Groundwater comprises 64 % of the water pumped from underground mines annually and 24 % of that pumped from open @-@ pit mines . This alters both the circulation and quality of the groundwater , lowers groundwater levels , and releases mine water into surface water bodies such as rivers and lakes . Mining activities have contributed to lower water levels in 24 out of the 39 lakes in the Kurtna Lake District . The release of mine water into the environment has changed the natural movement of surface water . As a result of mining activities , groundwater moves towards the excavation cavities . A 220 @-@ kilometre ( 85 @-@ square @-@ mile ) underground water body that holds over 170 million cubic metres ( 140 @,@ 000 acre · ft ) of water has formed in eight abandoned underground mines : Ahtme , Kohtla , Kukruse , Käva , Sompa , Tammiku , No.2 and <unk> 
 The process of pumping water from the mines introduces oxygen via aeration , thereby oxidising the rock 's pyrite . Pyrite contains sulfur , and one consequence of its oxidation is the introduction of significant amounts of sulphates into mine water . This has had a negative impact on water quality in five lakes in the Kurtna Lake District . In some lakes , sulphate levels have increased tens of times compared to the pre @-@ mining period . Suspended mineral matter in the mine water pumped into these lakes has changed the composition of the lakes ' sediments . However , it has been found that this disturbance diminishes over time ; studies show that sulphates and iron in mining water decrease to levels that meet drinking water quality standards about five years after mine closure . 
 The process and waste waters used in shale oil extraction contain phenols , tar , and several other environmentally toxic products . Power stations use water as a coolant and for hydraulic transportation of oil shale ash to the ash heaps . Narva power stations use 1 @,@ 306 million cubic metres ( 1 @,@ 059 @,@ 000 acre · ft ) of water from the Narva River annually for cooling . For ash transportation , generated oil shale ash is mixed with water at a ratio of 1 : 20 and the resulted mixture , known as " ash pulp " , is pumped to the heaps . Consequently , the transportation water becomes highly alkaline . The total volume of formed alkaline water is 19 million cubic metres ( 15 @,@ 000 acre · ft ) . 
 Another source of water pollution is aqueous leachates from oil shale ash and spent shale . About 800 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 650 to 970 acre · ft ) of toxic leachate from the Narva ash heaps inflows annually to the Narva River and further to the Gulf of Finland . Before the closure of old semi @-@ coke heaps in Kohtla @-@ Järve and Kiviõli , an additional 500 @,@ 000 cubic metres ( 410 acre · ft ) of leachates reached via the Kohtla and <unk> rivers to the Baltic Sea annually . The toxicity of leachate is mainly caused by the alkalinity and sulphides ; leachate also includes chlorides , oil products , heavy metals , and PAHs which are <unk> . 
 = = = Air emissions = = = 
 Oil shale @-@ fired power stations pollute air with the fly ash and flue gases like carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , nitrogen oxides ( NOx ) , sulfur dioxide ( SO 
 2 ) , and hydrogen chloride ( HCl ) . In addition to Estonia , this pollution also affects Finland and Russia . The industry emits into the atmosphere annually about 200 @,@ 000 tonnes of fly @-@ ash , including heavy metals , carbonates , alkaline oxides ( mainly calcium oxide ( CaO ) ) , and harmful organic substances ( including PAHs ) . About 30 % of the fly @-@ ash is CaO , a portion of which is neutralised by atmospheric CO2 . Alkaline fly ash has raised the pH value of lake and bog water . This has caused the invasion of eutrophic plants in the area of the oil shale industry , leading to the degradation of those waterbodies . Another source of air pollution is the dust that arises during deposition of oil shale ash and semi @-@ coke . 
 According to a 2001 study , the concentration of particulate matter in the fly @-@ ash is 39 @.@ 7 mg per cubic metre . The most hazardous particles are those with a diameter of less than 2 @.@ 5 micrometres ( 9 @.@ 8 × 10 − 5 in ) ; these particles are associated with an increase in cardiovascular mortality and in the number of premature deaths in Estonia . 
 The combustion of oil shale releases more CO2 into the atmosphere than any other primary fuel . Generating 1 MWh of electricity in modern oil shale @-@ fired boilers creates 0 @.@ 9 – 1 tonnes of CO2 . Therefore , oil shale industry is the chief source – more than 70 % – of greenhouse gas emissions in Estonia . Due to the oil shale @-@ based electricity generation , Estonia 's has the second highest greenhouse gas emissions relative to GDP among the OECD and the fifth highest emissions per capita among the IEA countries . The whole energy sector of Estonia emitted the CO2 equivalent 17 million tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2012 . In order to reduce the country 's CO2 emissions and to meet the emissions reduction targets , use of oil shale in electricity generation needs to be scaled down . CO2 emissions in Estonia could be reduced by two @-@ thirds if oil shale would be used for production of lighter oil products instead of burning it for electricity generation . It could be achieved by raising taxes on oil shale use and harmonizing tax rates of fossil fuels according to the CO2 emission content . 
 = = = Mitigation = = = 
 Various efforts have reduced the industry 's environmental impact . <unk> bed combustion generates fewer NOx , SO 
 2 , and fly @-@ ash emissions , including PAHs , than the earlier technologies that burned pulverised oil shale . Reclamation and reforestation of exhausted mining areas has been carried out since the 1970s . In 2010 – 2013 , a € 38 million project was implemented for the environmentally safe closing of 86 hectares ( 210 acres ) of semi @-@ coke and ash heaps . In accordance with a European Union waste framework directive , the heaps were covered with waterproof material , new topsoil , and sod . In Kiviõli , a 90 @-@ metre ( 300 ft ) semi @-@ coke heap , the highest artificial hill in the Baltic countries , was converted into a ski centre . The former Aidu open @-@ pit mine was converted into a rowing course . A part of the former Sirgala open pit mine has been used as a military training area . 
 There is no recent research about monetary valuation of health damage and environmental impacts caused by the oil shale industry . An oil shale sector health impact survey will be carried out in 2015 .

 Modern Life Is Rubbish is the second studio album by the English alternative rock band Blur , released in May 1993 . Although their debut album Leisure ( 1991 ) had been commercially successful , Blur faced a severe media backlash soon after its release , and fell out of public favour . After the group returned from an unsuccessful tour of the United States , poorly received live performances and the rising popularity of rival band Suede further diminished Blur 's status in the UK . 
 Under threat of being dropped by Food Records , for their next album Blur underwent an image makeover championed by frontman Damon Albarn . The band incorporated influences from traditional British guitar pop groups such as the Kinks and the Small Faces , and the resulting sound was melodic and lushly produced , featuring brass , woodwind and backing vocalists . Albarn 's lyrics on Modern Life Is Rubbish use " poignant humour and Ray Davies characterisation to investigate the dreams , traditions and prejudices of suburban England " , according to writer David Cavanagh . 
 Modern Life Is Rubbish was a moderate chart success in the UK ; the album peaked at number 15 , while the singles taken from the album charted in the Top 30 . <unk> by the music press , the album 's Anglocentric rhetoric rejuvenated the group 's fortunes after their post @-@ Leisure slump . Modern Life Is Rubbish is regarded as one of the defining releases of the Britpop scene , and its chart @-@ topping follow @-@ ups — Parklife and The Great Escape — saw Blur emerge as one of Britain 's leading pop acts .
