 Tropical cyclones do not typically bring high winds to the southwestern United States . Most Pacific hurricanes are embedded in easterly winds south of the subtropical ridge , and thus move westward — away from large land masses — until they dissipate over cold waters . However , during early autumn , tropical cyclones generally form closer to the Mexican shoreline than average , making them more likely to recurve , or to curve again , northwards under the influence of an approaching trough . These troughs tend to extend farther to the south during the latter part of the Pacific hurricane season , in the period between late August and early October . They also produce a synoptic @-@ scale flow that is conducive to steering hurricanes towards the southwestern United States . However , many hurricanes that approach the southwestern United States tend to be undergoing extratropical transition as they encounter increased wind shear and markedly cooler sea surface temperatures , and as they interact with the deep troughs that caused them to recurve . Kathleen is one of only six recorded tropical cyclones in the eastern Pacific Ocean known to have brought gale @-@ force or hurricane @-@ force winds to the Continental United States .

 A large area of thunderstorms , with a diameter of about 500 mi ( 800 km ) , formed 270 mi ( 430 km ) southwest of Acapulco . Moving rapidly west @-@ northwest , a tropical depression formed on September 7 . While briefly moving towards the east , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Kathleen . Moving above 83 ° F ( 28 ° C ) sea surface temperatures , Kathleen quickly strengthened . Before passing 40 mi ( 64 km ) east of Socorro Island , Kathleen reached its secondary peak with winds of 65 mph ( 115 km / h ) . Kathleen then weakened considerably , and by 0600 UTC September 9 , Tropical Storm Kathleen was barely a tropical storm . At this time , the system was located at 55 mi ( 89 km ) north of the island . Shortly thereafter , Kathleen turned north @-@ northeast into warmer waters . 
 Subsequently , the tropical storm began to re @-@ strengthen . Despite moving rapidly north , the cyclone strengthened into Hurricane Kathleen . The hurricane passed near several ships , and was intercepted by a Hurricane Hunter aircraft early on September 10 . It is estimated that the storm peaked in intensity around that time , with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 986 mb ( 986 hPa ) . However , Kathleen never developed an eye . About an hour after the first flight reached Kathleen , a second flight suggested that Kathleen had weakened back into a tropical storm . With precipitation falling in the United States , some 700 mi ( 1 @,@ 100 km ) north of the cyclone 's atmospheric circulation , Kathleen 's motion accelerated to speeds of 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) -38 mph ( 61 km / h ) . 
 After crossing the Point Eugenia peninsula ( the cyclones first landfall ) later on the morning of September 10 , Kathleen made its second landfall 120 mi ( 190 km ) north of Ensenada at 1130 UTC the same day . Unlike most tropical cyclones , Kathleen weakened slowly over California . Tropical Storm Kathleen weakened further into a depression over southern California and shortly thereafter , moved across Death Valley . On September 11 , Kathleen entered western Nevada . Finally , the center became difficult to locate , and the depression dissipated later on September 11 . After undergoing a Fujiwhara @-@ like interaction , where two circulations interact with each other , with a low @-@ pressure area stalled off the Pacific coast , moisture later spread into the northwestern part of the United States . After the stalled low was pulled inland , Kathleen combined with the low to produce additional rainfall over parts of California .

 The bulk of the rainfall from the tropical cyclone fell over Baja California Norte and Baja California Sur , to the east of its track . The highest amount reported was 6 @.@ 52 in ( 166 mm ) in San Antonio .

 On September 10 – 11 , gale @-@ force winds caused considerable damage to the city of Yuma . For a time , the sustained winds exceeded 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) , with gusts up to 76 mph ( 122 km / h ) . The National Weather Service 's forecast office in Tucson estimates that tropical storm @-@ force winds extended as far east as Pima County , and as far north as Lake Havasu . Rains caused severe flash @-@ flooding in Mohave County . One man was killed when the wind blew a palm tree onto his mobile home and 13 people across the state were hurt . The Tucson metropolitan area was particularly hard hit with flash flooding , with golf @-@ ball size hail . On Mount Lemmon , the hail reached a depth of 5 in ( 13 cm ) . While most of the rainfall from Tropical Storm Kathleen fell in California , 2 @.@ 87 inches ( 7 @.@ 3 cm ) fell at the Davis Dam on the Colorado River .

 The state received record rainfall , with 14 @.@ 76 in ( 37 @.@ 5 cm ) falling on the southern slopes of Mount San Gorgonio , and 10 @.@ 13 in ( 25 @.@ 7 cm ) accumulated on Mount Laguna . Because the village is situated atop an alluvial fan , a 40 ft ( 12 m ) wall of water exited a mountain canyon . Ocotillo was flooded with 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) -6 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) of water ; subsequently , half the town was destroyed . Six people drowned in the mud and waters in the town and two people were initially reported missing , though they were later found by officials . Overall , <unk> was 70 % – 80 % destroyed . Officials evacuated 175 people from the flooded area of Ocotillo and the nearby communities that surround the Salton Sea ; the sea rose 6 in ( 150 mm ) -8 in ( 200 mm ) . A quarter mile of interstate and a 60 @-@ foot bridge were destroyed by the flood , which also washed away mobile homes , trucks , and cars . 
 In Los Angeles , two people died of injuries suffered from slippery roads . One man drowned in El <unk> and two people drowned when their cars tumbled into the water near the city . Record flood stage was attained at numerous streams near the Coachella Valley . Widespread property damage was recorded on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada as well as the nearby desert . Across the San Joaquin Valley , 2 / 3 of the $ 150 million raisin crop was threatened . Crops including cotton , lettuce , and hay were damaged . 
 Homeowners in Palm Desert suffered $ 4 million in damage from the storm ; the town received more than a year 's worth of rainfall in a matter of days . No serious injuries were reported throughout the desert city , though two agricultural dikes broke . 
 Several miles of railway track , including three trestles that belonged to the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway , were destroyed and five others were damaged . At more than 50 other locations , tracks were buried by mudslides or had the ground under them washed away . After assessing the damage from Kathleen , the Southern Pacific Transportation Company decided in 1977 to abandon most of the railroad . A 700 ft ( 210 m ) section of Interstate 8 from Yuma to San Diego was destroyed . 
 Overall , hundreds of homes were damaged or destroyed ; Tropical Storm Kathleen was described as a one @-@ in- 160 @-@ year event . Total damage was $ 160 million , making Kathleen one of the costliest tropical storms in state history . Parts of California were declared a disaster area , and flash flood watches were issued throughout Southern California , including the desert and mountains . Flash flood warnings were also issued for parts of California , as well as nearby states Nevada and Arizona , but were dropped as the rain tampered off on September 11 .

 In Wyoming , the cyclone is credited for the first known sighting of a white ibis in the state 's history . In Montana , Kathleen dropped locally heavy rainfall approaching 2 inches ( 51 mm ) in localized spots , enough to become the wettest known tropical cyclone in state history . The remnants of the storm also affected Oregon and Idaho .

 = Japanese ironclad Hiei = 
 Hiei ( <unk> , Hiei ) was the second and last vessel of the Kongō @-@ class ironclad corvettes built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) in the 1870s . They were built in the United Kingdom because the Japanese were unable to build ironclad warships in Japan . She became a training ship in 1887 and made training cruises to the Mediterranean and to countries on the edge of the Pacific Ocean . The ship returned to active duty during the First Sino @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 95 where she was damaged during the Battle of the Yalu River . Hiei also participated in the Battle of Weihaiwei and the invasion of Formosa in 1895 . The ship resumed her training duties after the war , although she played a minor role in the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 . She was reclassified as a survey ship in 1906 and was sold for scrap in 1912 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 During the brief Japanese occupation of Taiwan in 1874 , tensions heightened between China and Japan , and the possibility of war caused the Japanese government to realize that it needed to reinforce its navy . The following year the government placed an order for the armored frigate Fusō and two Kongō @-@ class ships , designed by the British naval architect Sir Edward Reed , from British shipyards as no Japanese shipyard was able to build a ship of this size . 
 Hiei was 220 feet ( 67 @.@ 1 m ) long between perpendiculars and had a beam of 41 feet ( 12 @.@ 5 m ) . She had a forward draft of 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) and drew 19 feet ( 5 @.@ 8 m ) aft . The ship displaced 2 @,@ 248 long tons ( 2 @,@ 284 t ) and had a crew of 22 officers and 212 enlisted men . Her hull was of composite construction with an iron framework planked with wood . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The ship had a single two @-@ cylinder , double @-@ expansion , horizontal return connecting @-@ rod steam engine , driving a single propeller using steam from six cylindrical boilers . The engine was designed to produce 2 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 1 @,@ 900 kW ) to give the Kongō @-@ class ironclads a speed of 13 @.@ 5 knots ( 25 @.@ 0 km / h ; 15 @.@ 5 mph ) . During her sea trials on 7 December 1877 , the ship reached a maximum speed of 13 @.@ 92 knots ( 25 @.@ 78 km / h ; 16 @.@ 02 mph ) . She carried enough coal to steam 3 @,@ 100 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 700 km ; 3 @,@ 600 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . The ironclad was barque @-@ rigged and had a sail area of 14 @,@ 036 square feet ( 1 @,@ 304 m2 ) . The ship was reboilered at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in 1889 with two steel cylindrical boilers ; the new boilers proved to be less powerful during sea trials . Hiei reached a maximum speed of 10 @.@ 34 knots ( 19 @.@ 15 km / h ; 11 @.@ 90 mph ) from 1 @,@ 279 ihp ( 954 kW ) . Her topmasts were removed in 1895 . 
 = = = Armament and armor = = = 
 Hiei was fitted with three 172 @-@ millimeter ( 6 @.@ 8 in ) Krupp rifled breech @-@ loading ( RBL ) guns and six RBL 152 @-@ millimeter ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) Krupp guns . All of the 172 @-@ millimeter guns were positioned as chase guns , two forward and one aft . The 152 @-@ millimeter guns were mounted on the broadside . The ship also carried two short 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) guns for use ashore or mounted on the ship 's boats . 
 During the 1880s , the armament of the ship was reinforced with the addition of four quadruple @-@ barreled 25 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 0 in ) Nordenfelt and two quintuple @-@ barreled 11 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) Nordenfeldt machine guns for defense against torpedo boats . Around the same time she also received two 356 @-@ millimeter ( 14 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes for Schwartzkopff torpedoes . The anti @-@ torpedo boat armament was again reinforced in 1897 by the addition of a pair of 2 @.@ 5 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss guns . After the end of the Russo @-@ Japanese War , Hiei 's armament was reduced to six ex @-@ Russian 12 @-@ pounder guns and six 2 @.@ 5 @-@ pounders . 
 The Kongō @-@ class corvettes had a wrought @-@ iron armor waterline belt 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) thick amidships that tapered to 3 inches ( 76 mm ) at the ends of the ship . 
 = = History = = 
 The contract for Hiei was awarded to Milford Haven Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. in Pembroke Dock , Wales , on 24 September 1875 for the price of £ 119 @,@ 600 , exclusive of armament . Japanese sources universally give the date for Hiei 's keel @-@ laying as 24 September 1875 — the same as that for the awarding of the contract — but historian Hans Langerer describes this as improbable , arguing that no shipyard would order enough material to begin construction without cash in hand . She was launched on 12 June 1877 ; Reed 's daughter smashed a bottle of champagne on the ship 's bow in the traditional Western style . The ship was named for Mount Hiei . Completed in February 1878 , Hiei sailed for Japan on 22 March under the command of a British captain and with a British crew because the IJN was not yet ready for such a long voyage . One of the passengers aboard her was the future admiral Togo Heihachiro , who had just completed six years of study in the United Kingdom . She arrived in Yokohama on 22 May and was assigned to the Tokai Naval District a month later . On 10 July a formal ceremony was held in Yokohama for the receipt of the ship that was attended by the Meiji Emperor and many senior government officials . The ship was opened for tours by the nobility , their families and invited guests for three days after the ceremony . On 14 July , the general public was allowed to tour the ship for a week . 
 During 1880 , Hiei visited ports in India , Persia , the Persian Gulf and various ports in Southeast Asia . The ship made annual port visits to Jinsen in Korea in 1881 through 1883 . She was assigned to the Small Standing Fleet in 1886 and became a training ship in 1887 the following year . Together with her sister ship Kongō , Hiei sailed from Shinagawa , Tokyo on 13 August 1889 on a training cruise to the Mediterranean with cadets from the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy , returning on 2 February 1890 . On 5 October the sisters departed Shinagawa for Kobe to pick up the 69 survivors of the wrecked Ottoman frigate Ertuğrul and continued on to Constantinople , Turkey to return them to their homeland . They arrived on 2 January 1891 , and the ships ' officers were received by Sultan Abdul Hamid II . The ships also carried a class of naval cadets . On the return voyage , they made a port visit at Piraeus where they were visited by King George I of Greece and his son , Crown Prince Constantine . Making stops at Alexandria , Port Said , Aden , Colombo , Singapore and Hong Kong , the sisters arrived at Shinagawa on 10 May . 
 Hiei began another cadet cruise on 30 September 1891 and visited Australia and Manila before returning to Shinagawa on 10 April 1892 . The ship was not in service in 1893 , but she was recommissioned before the beginning of the First Sino @-@ Japanese War in 1894 . Hiei was assigned to the Standing Fleet on 2 July . She was the last ship in the Japanese line during the Battle of the Yalu River in September and was heavily damaged when her captain decided to pass through the Chinese fleet rather than try to keep up with the faster Main Squadron . The ship became the target of most of the Chinese ships and was forced to disengage to prevent further damage . Hiei was transferred to the West @-@ Sea Fleet on 14 October , and the sisters were assigned to the Second Raiding Unit in December for operations against the Chinese port of Weihaiwei . The ships were present during the Battle of Weihaiwei in January – February 1895 , although neither saw any significant combat . Hiei took part in the invasion of Formosa in 1895 , and participated in the bombardment of the Chinese coastal forts at <unk> ( Kaohsiung ) on 13 October 1895 . 
 After the war , Hiei alternated her training cruises with Kongō , making the 1897 cruise to the West Coast of North America and Hawaii from 13 April to 20 September and repeating the same cruise from 14 December 1898 to 28 August 1899 . During that cruise , on 21 March 1898 , the ship was re @-@ designated as a 3rd @-@ class coast defense ship , although she retained her training duties . Both ships made the 1902 cruise , their last , to Manila and Australia from 19 February to 25 August . Hiei played a minor role in the Russo @-@ Japanese War before she was reclassified as a survey ship in 1906 . Hiei was stricken from the Navy List on 1 April 1911 and ordered to be sold on 21 December . The exact date of her sale is not known , although Maizuru Naval District reported her sale on 25 March 1912 . 
 = Moncton = 
 Moncton / <unk> / is a city located in Westmorland County in the southeastern portion of the province of New Brunswick , Canada . Situated in the Petitcodiac River Valley , Moncton lies at the geographic centre of the Maritime Provinces . The city has earned the nickname " Hub City " due to its central location in the region and its history as a railway and land transportation hub for the Maritimes . 
 The city proper has a population of 69 @,@ 074 ( 2011 ) and has a land area of 142 km2 ( 55 sq mi ) . The Moncton CMA has a population of 138 @,@ 644 ( 2011 ) , making it the largest CMA in New Brunswick , the second @-@ largest CMA in the Maritime Provinces , and the third @-@ largest CMA in Atlantic Canada . The CMA includes the neighbouring city of Dieppe and the town of Riverview , as well as adjacent suburban areas in Westmorland and Albert counties . 
 Although the Moncton area was originally settled in 1733 , Moncton is considered to have been officially founded in 1766 with the arrival of Pennsylvania Dutch immigrants from Philadelphia . Initially an agricultural settlement , Moncton was not incorporated until 1855 . The city was named for Lt. Col. Robert Monckton , the British officer who had captured nearby Fort Beauséjour a century earlier . A significant wooden shipbuilding industry had developed in the community by the mid @-@ 1840s , allowing for the civic incorporation in 1855 , but the shipbuilding economy collapsed in the 1860s , causing the town to lose its civic charter in 1862 . Moncton regained its charter in 1875 after the community 's economy rebounded , mainly due to a growing railway industry . In 1871 , the Intercolonial Railway of Canada had chosen Moncton to be its headquarters , and Moncton remained a railroad town for well over a century until the closure of the Canadian National Railway ( CNR ) locomotive shops in the late 1980s . Although the economy of Moncton was traumatized twice — by the collapse of the shipbuilding industry in the 1860s and by the closure of the CNR locomotive shops in the 1980s — the city was able to rebound strongly on both occasions . The city adopted the motto Resurgo after its rebirth as a railway town . At present , the city 's economy is stable and diversified , primarily based on its traditional transportation , distribution , retailing , and commercial heritage , and supplemented by strength in the educational , health care , financial , information technology , and insurance sectors . The strength of Moncton 's economy has received national recognition and the local unemployment rate is consistently less than the national average .

 Acadians first settled the head of the Bay of Fundy in the 1670s . The first reference to the " <unk> River " was on the De <unk> map of 1686 . Settlement of the Petitcodiac and Memramcook river valleys began about 1700 , gradually extending inland and reaching the site of present @-@ day Moncton in 1733 . The first Acadian settlers in the Moncton area established a marshland farming community and chose to name their settlement Le Coude ( The Elbow ) , an allusion to the 90 ° bend in the river near the site of the settlement . 
 In 1755 , nearby Fort Beausejour was captured by English forces under the command of Lt. Col. Robert Monckton . The Beaubassin region including the Memramcook and Petitcodiac river valleys subsequently fell under English control . 
 Later that year , Governor Charles Lawrence issued a decree ordering the expulsion of the Acadian population from Nova Scotia ( including recently captured areas of Acadia such as le Coude ) . This action came to be known as the " Great Upheaval " . 
 The reaches of the upper Petitcodiac River valley then came under the control of the Philadelphia Land Company ( one of the principals of which was Benjamin Franklin ) and in 1766 Pennsylvania Dutch settlers arrived to re @-@ establish the pre @-@ existing farming community at Le Coude . The Settlers consisted of eight families ; <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , Jacob Treitz ( <unk> ) , Matthias Sommer ( Somers ) , Jacob <unk> ( Ricker ) , Charles Jones ( Schantz ) , George <unk> ( Wortman ) , Michael Lutz ( Lutes ) , and George Koppel ( <unk> ) . There is a plaque dedicated in their honor at the mouth of Hall 's Creek . They renamed the settlement " The Bend " . The Bend remained an agricultural settlement for nearly 80 more years . Even by 1836 , there were only 20 households in the community . At this time , the Westmorland Road became open to year round travel and a regular mail coach service was established between Saint John and Halifax . The Bend became an important transfer and rest station along the route . Over the next decade , lumbering and then shipbuilding would become important industries in the area . 
 The turning point for the community was when Joseph Salter took over ( and expanded ) a shipyard at The Bend in 1847 . The expanded shipyard ultimately grew to employ about 400 workers . The Bend subsequently developed a service @-@ based economy to support the shipyard and gradually began to acquire all the amenities of a growing town . The prosperity engendered by the wooden shipbuilding industry allowed The Bend to incorporate as the town of Moncton in 1855 . The town was named for Lt. Col. Robert Monckton , but a clerical error at the time the town was incorporated resulted in the misspelling of the community 's name , which has been perpetuated to the present day . The first mayor of Moncton was the shipbuilder Joseph Salter . 
 Two years later , in 1857 , the European and North American Railway opened its line from Moncton to nearby Shediac ; this was followed by a line from Moncton to Saint John opening in 1859 . At about the time of the arrival of the railway , the popularity of steam @-@ powered ships forced an end to the era of wooden shipbuilding . The Salter shipyard closed in 1858 . The resulting industrial collapse caused Moncton to surrender its civic charter in 1862 . 
 Moncton 's economic depression did not last long and a second era of prosperity came to the area in 1871 when Moncton was selected to be the headquarters of the Intercolonial Railway of Canada ( ICR ) . The arrival of the ICR in Moncton was a seminal event for the community . For the next 120 years , the history of the city would be firmly linked with that of the railway . In 1875 , Moncton was able to reincorporate as a town and adopted the motto " Resurgo " ( Latin for I rise again ) . One year later , the ICR line to Quebec was opened . The railway boom that emanated from this and the associated employment growth allowed Moncton to achieve city status on 23 April 1890 . 
 Moncton grew rapidly during the early 20th century , particularly after provincial lobbying helped the city become the eastern terminus of the massive National Transcontinental Railway project in 1912 . In 1918 , the ICR and NTR were merged by the federal government into the newly formed Canadian National Railways ( CNR ) system . The ICR shops would become CNR 's major locomotive repair facility for the Maritimes and Moncton became the headquarters for CNR 's Maritime division . The T. Eaton Company 's catalogue warehouse moved to the city in the early 1920s , employing over seven hundred people . Transportation and distribution became increasingly important to the Moncton economy throughout the middle part of the 20th century . The Moncton Airport opened in 1929 and quickly became an important fixture in the community . During the Second World War the Canadian Army built a large military supply base in the city to service the Maritime military establishment . The CNR continued to dominate the economy of the city with railway employment in Moncton peaked at nearly six thousand workers in the 1950s before beginning a slow decline . 
 Moncton was placed on the Trans @-@ Canada Highway network in the early 1960s after Route 2 was built along the northern perimeter of the city . Subsequent development saw Route 15 built between the city and Shediac . At the same time , the Petitcodiac River Causeway was constructed . The Université de Moncton was founded in 1963 . This institution became an important resource in the development of Acadian culture in the area . 
 The late 1970s and the 1980s again saw a period of economic hardship hit the city as several major employers closed or restructured . The Eatons catalogue division , CNR 's locomotive shops facility and CFB Moncton were all closed during this time throwing thousands of citizens out of work . 
 Diversification in the early 1990s saw the rise of information technology , led by call centres which made use of the city 's bilingual workforce . By the late 1990s , retail , manufacturing and service expansion began to occur in all sectors and within a decade of the closure of the CNR locomotive shops Moncton had more than made up for its employment losses . This dramatic turnaround in the fortunes of the city has been termed the " Moncton Miracle " . 
 The growth of the community has continued unabated since the 1990s and has actually been accelerating . The confidence of the community has been bolstered by its ability to host major events such as the Francophonie Summit in 1999 , a Rolling Stones concert in 2005 , the Memorial Cup in 2006 and both the IAAF World Junior Championships in Athletics and a neutral site regular season CFL football game in 2010 . Recent positive developments include the Atlantic Baptist University ( later renamed Crandall University ) achieving full university status and relocating to a new campus in 1996 , the Greater Moncton Airport opening a new terminal building and becoming a designated international airport in 2002 , and the opening of the new Gunningsville Bridge to Riverview in 2005 . In 2002 , Moncton became Canada 's first officially bilingual city . In the 2006 census , Moncton was officially designated a Census Metropolitan Area and became the largest metropolitan area in the province of New Brunswick . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Moncton lies in southeastern New Brunswick , at the geographic centre of the Maritime Provinces . The city is located along the north bank of the Petitcodiac River at a point where the river bends acutely from a west − east to north − south flow . This geographical feature has contributed significantly to historical names given to the community . 
 Petitcodiac in the Mi 'kmaq language has been translated as meaning " bends like a bow " . The early Acadian settlers in the region named their community Le Coude which means " the elbow " . Subsequent English immigrants changed the name of the settlement to The Bend of the Petitcodiac ( or simply The Bend ) . 
 The Petitcodiac river valley at Moncton is broad and relatively flat , bounded by a long ridge to the north ( Lutes Mountain ) and by the rugged Caledonia Highlands to the south . Moncton lies at the original head of navigation on the river , however a causeway to Riverview ( constructed in 1968 ) resulted in extensive sedimentation of the river channel downstream and rendered the Moncton area of the waterway unnavigable . On 14 April 2010 , the causeway gates were opened in an effort to restore the silt @-@ laden river . 
 = = = Tidal bore = = = 
 The Petitcodiac River exhibits one of North America 's few tidal bores : a regularly occurring wave that travels up the river on the leading edge of the incoming tide . The bore is as a result of the extreme tides of the Bay of Fundy . Originally , the bore was very impressive , sometimes between 1 and 2 metres ( 3 ft 3 in and 6 ft 7 in ) in height and extending across the 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) width of the Petitcodiac River in the Moncton area . This wave would occur twice a day at high tide , travelling at an average speed of 13 km / h ( 8 @.@ 1 mph ) and producing an audible roar . Unsurprisingly , the " bore " became a very popular early tourist attraction for the city , but when the Petitcodiac causeway was built in the 1960s , the river channel quickly silted in and reduced the bore so that it rarely exceeds 15 to 20 centimetres ( 5 @.@ 9 to 7 @.@ 9 in ) in height . On 14 April 2010 , the causeway gates were opened in an effort to restore the silt @-@ laden river . A recent tidal bore since the opening of the causeway gates measured a 2 @-@ foot @-@ high ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) wave , unseen for many years . 
 = = = Nearby natural features = = = 
 There are many natural attractions near Moncton . Two major national parks , Fundy National Park and <unk> National Park , are within a one @-@ hour drive of the city . The warmest salt water beaches north of Virginia can be found on the Northumberland Strait , only 15 minutes away at Parlee Beach in the nearby town of Shediac . New Brunswick 's signature natural attraction , the Hopewell Rocks , are a half @-@ hour 's drive down the Petitcodiac river valley . Cape <unk> , located near Alma , includes a historic lighthouse , fossil cliffs , scenic vistas , and adventure tourism . The Sackville Waterfowl Park includes nature trails and a boardwalk over a freshwater marsh as well as waterfowl viewing platforms . Other nearby attractions ( within one hour of the city ) include The Cape <unk> National Wildlife Preserve , La Dune de <unk> Eco @-@ Centre , ( an ecotourism site and beach ) and the <unk> Fossil Cliffs in Nova Scotia ; a UNESCO world heritage site . 
 = = Climate = = 
 Despite being less than 50 km ( 31 mi ) from the Bay of Fundy and less than 30 km ( 19 mi ) from the Northumberland Strait , the climate tends to be more continental than maritime during the summer and winter seasons , with maritime influences somewhat tempering the transitional seasons of spring and autumn . 
 Moncton has a warm summer continental climate ( Köppen climate classification Dfb ) with uniform precipitation distribution . Winter days are typically cold but generally sunny with solar radiation generating some warmth . Daytime high temperatures usually range a few degrees below the freezing point . Major snowfalls can result from nor 'easter ocean storms moving up the east coast of North America . These major snowfalls typically average 20 – 30 cm ( 8 – 12 in ) and are frequently mixed with rain or freezing rain . Spring is frequently delayed because the sea ice that forms in the nearby Gulf of St. Lawrence during the previous winter requires time to melt , and this will cool onshore winds , which can extend inland as far as Moncton . The ice burden in the gulf has diminished considerably over the course of the last decade ( which may be a consequence of global warming ) , and the springtime cooling effect has weakened as a result . Daytime temperatures above freezing are typical by late February . Trees are usually in full leaf by late May . Summers are hot and humid due to the seasonal prevailing westerly winds strengthening the continental tendencies of the local climate . Daytime highs sometimes reach more than 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) . Rainfall is generally modest , especially in late July and August , and periods of drought are not uncommon . Autumn daytime temperatures remain mild until late October . First snowfalls usually do not occur until late November and consistent snow cover on the ground does not happen until late December . The Fundy coast of New Brunswick occasionally experiences the effects of post @-@ tropical storms . The stormiest weather of the year , with the greatest precipitation and the strongest winds , usually occurs during the fall / winter transition ( November to mid @-@ January ) .

 Moncton generally remains a " low rise " city . The city 's skyline however encompasses many buildings and structures with varying architectural styles from many periods . The most dominant structure in the city is the Bell Aliant Tower , a 127 metres ( 417 ft ) microwave communications tower built in 1971 . When it was constructed , it was the tallest microwave communications tower of its kind in North America . It remains the tallest structure in Moncton , dwarfing the neighbouring Place L ’ <unk> by 46 metres ( 151 ft ) . Indeed , the Bell Aliant Tower is also the tallest free @-@ standing structure in all four Atlantic provinces . Assumption Place is a 20 @-@ story office building and is the headquarters of Assumption Mutual Life Insurance . This building is 81 metres ( 266 ft ) in height and is tied with Brunswick Square ( Saint John ) as the tallest building in the province .

 Tourism is an important industry in Moncton and historically owes its origins to the presence of two natural attractions , the tidal bore of the Petitcodiac River ( see above ) and the optical illusion of Magnetic Hill . The tidal bore was the first phenomenon to become an attraction but the construction of the Petitcodiac causeway in the 1960s effectively extirpated the attraction . Magnetic Hill , on the city 's northwest outskirts , is the city 's most famous attraction . The Magnetic Hill area includes ( in addition to the phenomenon itself ) , a golf course , major water park , zoo , and an outdoor concert facility .

 = = Military = = 
 Aside from locally formed militia units , the military did not have a significant presence in the Moncton area until the beginning of the Second World War . In 1940 , a large military supply base ( later known as CFB Moncton ) was constructed on a railway spur line north of downtown next to the CNR shops . This base served as the main supply depot for the large wartime military establishment in the Maritimes . In addition , two Commonwealth Air Training Plan bases were also built in the Moncton area during the war : No. 8 Service Flying Training School , RCAF , and No. 31 Personnel Depot , RAF . The RCAF also operated No. 5 Supply Depot in Moncton . A naval listening station was also constructed in Coverdale ( Riverview ) in 1941 to help in coordinating radar activities in the North Atlantic . Military flight training in the Moncton area terminated at the end of World War II and the naval listening station closed in 1971 . CFB Moncton remained open to supply the maritime military establishment until just after the end of the Cold War . 
 With the closure of CFB Moncton in the early 1990s , the military presence in Moncton has been significantly reduced . The northern portion of the former base property has been turned over to the Canada Lands Corporation and is slowly being redeveloped . The southern part of the former base remains an active DND property and is now termed the Moncton Garrison . It is affiliated with CFB Gagetown . Resident components of the garrison include the 1 Engineer Support Unit ( Regular force ) . The garrison also houses the 37 Canadian Brigade Group Headquarters ( reserve force ) and one of the 37 Brigades constituent units ; the 8th Canadian Hussars ( Princess Louise 's ) , which is an armoured reconnaissance regiment . 3 Area support unit Det Moncton , and 42 Canadian Forces Health Services Center Det Moncton provide logistical support for the base . In 2013 , the last regular forces units left the Moncton base , but the reserve units remain active and Moncton remains the 37 Canadian Brigade Unit headquarters .

 = Be Someone Else = 
 Be Someone Else is the second studio album by Portuguese singer @-@ songwriter Slimmy . Saul Davies was first set to be the producer of the album , however , such collaboration wasn 't possible and Slimmy started working on the album with his longtime producers Quico Serrano and Mark J Turner . Other musicians joined Slimmy for the recording of the album : Paulo Garim in the bass and Tó @-@ Zé in the drums , who already worked with <unk> in Beatsound Loverboy , and Gustavo Silva , in the keyboards and Daniel Santos in the guitar as guest musicians . He mentioned that all production process happened because of him and that he was the one with the " last word " on his projects , not the bands or producers that he worked with . Originally due for release on May 2010 , the album 's release was pushed back to 14 June 2010 . The album was released in three formats : the physical standard edition , the physical deluxe edition with 2 discs and the digital format featuring 10 tracks . 
 Slimmy defined the album as " freedom , with a bit of " teasing " and " sexual " , an album full of strong songs dedicated to his fans . The album is essentially a rock album , a completely opposite of Beatsound Loverboy , which features a more electronic sound , keeping , however , the same connection between rock and electro music . In an interview with JN Slimmy declared that the album feels more organic and less electronic because in Beatsound Loverboy , there was no one else to play the songs but him . While maintaining his irreverence , Slimmy guarantees , however , that what matters is to make music that people intending to sing and lyrics that people can understand . He also said that he already received criticism for not being a singer with a proper style , but " I try to provide different sensations to people . 
 Slimmy 's most significant promotion marked the beginning of " A Very Slimmy Tour " , starting on 18 February 2011 at the <unk> River Klub in Esposende and ending on 30 April 2011 at the Pitch Club in Porto . Slimmy 's " Be Someone Else Tour " began on 6 May 2011 with its opening show at the Academy Week in <unk> . Neither of the album 's singles , " Be Someone Else " and " The Games You Play " , were particularly successful , charting anywhere . Critical response to the album was generally favorable , with critics praising Quico Serrano and Mark Turner 's Be Someone Else 's polished production , calling the album more direct and humanized than Beatsound Loverboy . " Be Someone Else " was a commercial disappointment , the album didn 't managed to chart on any official chart company to date . Two music videos were released from the album : " The Games You Play " , produced by Ana Andrade , Carla <unk> , Clara Araújo Teixeira and Helena Oliveira , premiered on 17 November 2009 on YouTube and " Be Someone Else " , produced by Riot Films and premiered on 27 June 2010 .

Other musicians joined Slimmy for the recording of the album : Paulo Garim in the bass and Tó @-@ Zé in the drums , who already worked with <unk> in Beatsound Loverboy , and Gustavo Silva , in the keyboards and Daniel Santos in the guitar as guest musicians . Slimmy commented that most songs on the album are re @-@ recordings which were recorded in Portugal in 2006 and 2007 , however , these suffered some changes during the recording sessions at the Wrong Planet Studios in the UK , to improve their sound quality . 
 In an interview with Susana Faria of JPN , Slimmy defined the album as " freedom , with a bit of " teasing " and " sexual " , an album full of strong songs dedicated to my fans " . During this same interview , Slimmy talked about the album : 
 = = = Concept and music = = = 
 The album is essentially a rock album , a completely opposite of Beatsound Loverboy , which features a more electronic sound , keeping , however , the same connection between rock and electro music . Slimmy has been influenced by rock artists such as Placebo , <unk> and Kings of Leon . Slimmy explained that Be Someone Else sounds different from Beatsound Loverboy because of its complex and structured production . Slimmy mentioned that Be Someone Else is less individualist than Beatsound Loverboy , he declares that this album is like " a message about being who you are " , while his previous album talked about his past experiences , specially about his experience in London . In an interview with Palco Principal , Slimmy was asked if he missed the " One Man Show " times . He declared that " Doesn 't matter how big the bands that play with me are , I will always feel like " one " , because , in this new record , I was the one who spent nights working on the album , not my band " . He also mentioned that all production process happened because of him and that he was the one with the " last word " on his projects , not the bands or producers that he worked with . During this same interview , Slimmy confessed that is always good to have someone with great ideas to work with , in this case , he was talking about him . He explained : " if there were five persons creating music , there would be a lot of mess , that 's why do it all and I 'm glad people trust in me for that " . 
 " I Can 't Live Without You In This Town " , an electro rock ballad , makes a <unk> difference from the other tracks , some critics called the chorus of the song memorable . The song is dedicated to a girl Slimmy met in Texas in 2004 . The album also features a song entitled " Together 4ever " remixed by DJ Ride . The song " Beatsound Loverboy " , included on the Beatsound Loverboy Remixes EP , was also remixed by DJ Ride . 
 In an interview with JN Slimmy declared that the album feels more organic and less electronic because in Beatsound Loverboy , there was no one else to play the songs but him . He explained that with the trio now completely formed , it is a whole different concept , everything sounds different , and their presence on stage is more energetic and <unk> . Slimmy also declared that <unk> is no longer a solo project , but also belongs to those who follow it . In an interview with Jornal Metro , Slimmy said that the album reflects the maturity , greater stability in the mind . While maintaining his irreverence , Slimmy guarantees , however , that what matters is to " make music that people intending to sing and lyrics that people can understand . I do not do things to shock " , he also said that he already received criticism for not being a singer with a proper style , but " I try to provide different sensations to people . When I sing alive , I sound much more rock , but in this album , there are many different spirit moods " .

Both standard and deluxe edition 's jewel case CD contained a booklet with alternative covers . 
 In an interview with Palco Principal , on March 23 , 2010 , Slimmy revealed the title of the album . He explained : " As a first resort , when I wrote the lyrics of the song [ " Be Someone Else " ] , I just wanted to warn those who not work , but still waiting for results . If you want to be somebody , you have to give much of yourself , is not enough to " give less and expect more " . However , over the years , I realized that music was also for the kind of people that bring us down . Life is not a race . We must be ourselves , open our eyes and always look forward . " 
 While being interviewed by Palco Principal , Slimmy declared he was bit " unsure " about the promotion process of the album , he affirmed that he already had shows to make in France and Germany , but his real intention was to tour Portugal intensively , because he felt he had no success in his country . The first promotional concert toke place at the Cidade do Porto Shopping on 26 March 2010 , where Slimmy sang a few songs from his album , including " The Games You Play " and " Be Someone Else " .

 = Delichon = 
 Delichon is a small genus of passerine birds that belongs to the swallow family and contains three species named as house martins . These are chunky , bull @-@ headed and short @-@ tailed birds , blackish @-@ blue above with a contrasting white rump , and with white or grey underparts . They have feathering on the toes and tarsi that is characteristic of this genus . The house martins are closely related to other swallows that build mud nests , particularly the Hirundo barn swallows . They breed only in Europe , Asia and the mountains of North Africa . Two species , the common and Asian house martins , migrate south in winter , while the Nepal house martin is resident in the Himalayas year @-@ round . 
 The house martins nest in colonies on cliffs or buildings , constructing <unk> or grass @-@ lined mud nests . The typical clutch is two or three white eggs ; both parents build the nest , incubate the eggs and feed the chicks . These martins are aerial hunters of small insects such as flies and aphids . Despite their flying skills the Delichon martins are sometimes caught by fast @-@ flying birds of prey . They may carry fleas or internal parasites . None of the species are considered threatened , although widespread reductions in common house martin numbers have been reported from central and northern Europe . This decline is due to factors including poor weather , poisoning by agricultural pesticides , lack of mud for nest building and competition with house sparrows for nest sites . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The three Delichon species are members of the swallow family of birds , and are classed as members of the Hirundininae subfamily which comprises all swallows and martins except the very distinctive river martins . DNA studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae , broadly correlating with the type of nest built . The groups are the " core martins " including burrowing species like the sand martin , the " nest @-@ adopters " , which are birds like the tree swallow that utilise natural cavities , and the " mud nest builders " . The Delichon species construct a closed mud nest and therefore belong to the latter group ; they appear to be intermediate between the Hirundo and Ptyonoprogne species that make open cup nests , and the Cecropis and Petrochelidon swallows , which have retort @-@ like closed nests with an entrance tunnel . The genetic evidence suggests a close relationship between Hirundo and Delichon , which is further supported by the frequency of interbreeding between two widespread species , the barn swallow and the common house martin , despite being their being in different genera . The suggested taxonomic sequence of the mud @-@ building swallows has been recommended by at least two European taxonomic committees . 
 The genus Delichon was created by American naturalist Thomas Horsfield and British entomologist Frederic Moore in 1854 to accommodate the Nepal house martin that was first described by Moore in the same year , and is therefore the type species for the genus . The two other house martins were moved to Delichon from the genus Chelidon in which they had been placed up to that time . The name of the new genus , " Delichon " , is an anagram of the Ancient Greek term χελιδον / chelidôn , meaning swallow . 
 The genus contains three similar species : 
 Common house martin ( Delichon urbicum ) originally described as Hirundo urbica by Linnaeus in 1758 . 
 Asian house martin ( Delichon dasypus ) described as Chelidon dasypus by Bonaparte in 1850 . 
 Nepal house martin ( Delichon nipalense ) described by Moore in 1854 . 
 The common and Asian house martins have sometimes been considered to be a single species , although both breed in the western Himalayas without hybridising . There is also limited DNA evidence that suggests a significant genetic distance between these two martins . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Delichon is an Old World genus with all three species breeding only in the Northern Hemisphere . The common house martin is a widespread migrant breeder across Europe , north Africa and all northern temperate Asia to Kamchatka . Its western subspecies D. u. urbicum winters in tropical Africa , and eastern D. u. lagopodum moves to southern China and Southeast Asia . The Asian house martin breeds further south than common house martin in the mountains of central and eastern Asia ; its nominate subspecies winters in Southeast Asia , but the races breeding in the Himalayan and Taiwan may just move from the high mountains to lower altitudes . The Nepal house martin is resident in the mountains of southern Asia . 
 The preferred habitat of the common house martin is open country with low vegetation , such as pasture , meadows and farmland , and preferably near water , although it is also found in mountains up to at least 2 @,@ 200 metres ( 7 @,@ 200 ft ) altitude . As its name implies , it readily nests on man @-@ made buildings , and will breed even in city centres if the air is clean enough . The other two species favour mountainous country ( and sea cliffs in the case of Asian house martin ) ; they use buildings as nest sites less frequently than their northern relative . The wintering grounds of the two migrant species include a range of open country and hilly habitats . 
 = = Description = = 
 Delichon martins are 13 – 15 cm ( 5 – 6 in ) long , blackish blue above with a contrasting white rump , and with white or grey underparts . They are chunky , bull @-@ headed and short @-@ tailed birds , and have feathering on the toes and tarsi . The common house martin is the largest bird of the three , with an average weight of 18 @.@ 3 g ( 0 @.@ 65 oz ) , and has the most deeply forked tail ; the Nepalese species is the smallest ( 15 g , 0 @.@ 53 oz ) and has the <unk> tail . Distinctive species plumage features are the black chin and black undertail coverts of the Nepal house martin , and the greyish wash to the underparts of the Asian house martin . As with other swallows and martins , the moult is slow and protracted because of the need to maintain efficient flight at all times to enable feeding . Moult normally starts on arrival at the wintering grounds , but overlaps with the breeding season for the non @-@ migratory Nepal house martin . 
 The Delichon martins have simple flight calls of one to three notes . In the two more widespread species these have a distinctive buzzing quality . The male 's song is a short simple ripple , perhaps less musical than that given by other swallows . 
 As a group , the house martins cannot easily be confused with any other swallows . Four species of the genus <unk> have white rumps and underparts , but they have bright metallic green or blue @-@ green upperparts , longer tails , and are restricted to Central and South America . The variable plumages of the South Asian species and a confused taxonomic history has left their distribution ranges in doubt . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 The Delichon martins were originally cliff nesters , breeding in colonies situated under an overhang on a vertical cliff . However , the house martin now largely uses human structures , as , to a lesser extent , does the Asian house martin . The typical nest is a grass or feather @-@ lined deep closed mud bowl with a small opening at the top , but many Asian house martins leave the top of the nest open . 
 David Winkler and Frederick Sheldon believe that evolutionary development in the mud @-@ building swallows , and individual species follow this order of construction . A retort builder like red @-@ rumped swallow starts with an open cup , closes it , and then builds the entrance tunnel . Winkler and Sheldon propose that the development of closed nests reduced competition between males for copulations with the females . Since mating occurs inside the nest , the difficulty of access means other males are excluded . This reduction in competition permits the dense breeding colonies typical of the Delichon martins . 
 The urban common house martin has to compete with house sparrows , which frequently attempt to take over the nest during construction , with the house martins rebuilding elsewhere if the sparrows are successful . The entrance at the top of the completed cup is so small that the sparrows cannot take over the nest once it is finished . 
 As with other swallows , pairing and copulation displays are normally brief , taking just a few minutes . The male calls to a female and attempts to lead her to the nest , where he lands and continues calling while posing with lowered head , dropped wings and ruffled throat . If he is successful , the female calls and allows him to mount her , usually in the nest . Three or four white eggs are the normal clutch and all three species are frequently double @-@ brooded . Both sexes build the nest , incubate the eggs and feed the chicks , although the female does most of the incubation , which normally lasts 14 – 16 days . The newly hatched chicks are altricial , and after a further 22 – 32 days , depending on weather , the chicks leave the nest . The fledged young stay with , and are fed by , the parents for about a week after leaving the nest . Occasionally , young birds from the first brood will assist in feeding the second brood . 
 A Scottish study showed that mortality in common house martins occurred mostly outside the breeding season and averaged 57 % . Females that had raised two clutches in a season had a higher mortality than those that were single @-@ brooded , but there was no such correlation for the males . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The Delichon species typically feed higher in the air , and take smaller prey than other swallows . It is believed that this reduces inter @-@ specific food competition , particularly with the barn swallow which shares much of the breeding and wintering range of the martins . The insects eaten are mostly small flies , aphids and Hymenoptera such as winged ants . A wide range of other insects are caught , including Lepidoptera , beetles and lacewings . The Asian house martin appears to occasionally take terrestrial springtails and larvae and the common house martin also sometimes feeds on the ground . These martins are gregarious , feeding in flocks often with other aerial predators like swifts , or other hirundines such as the barn or striated swallows . In the case of at least the common house martin , the start of egg laying appears to be linked to the appearance of large numbers of flying aphids , which provide a stable and abundant food supply . 
 = = = Predators and parasites = = = 
 The main predators of the house martins are those birds of prey which are capable of catching these agile fliers , such as the hobby ( Falco subbuteo ) . Birds of the Delichon species are most vulnerable when collecting mud from the ground . This has therefore become a communal activity , with a group of these birds descending suddenly on a patch of mud . The generally insectivorous collared falconet has been recorded as hunting Nepal house martins . 
 The house martins are parasitised by fleas and mites , including the " house martin flea " , Ceratophyllus hirundinis and its relatives . A Polish study of the common house martin showed that nests typically contained more than 29 species of ectoparasite , with C. hirundinis and another swallow specialist , Oeciacus hirundinis , the most abundant . The genus also hosts endoparasites such as Haemoproteus <unk> ( avian malaria ) , which are transmitted by blood @-@ sucking insects including mosquitoes . 
 More than 40 beetle species have been recorded in common house martin nests , but most are either typical of the locality or found in the nests of other birds . The typical number of individuals , around 200 , is relatively low compared to other bird species ( 1 @,@ 400 individual beetles for house sparrow , 2 @,@ 000 for sand martin ) . The beetles have no effect on the nesting birds , and the reason for their comparatively low numbers is unknown , although the numbers of specific parasites found in house martin 's nests is also quite small .

A species is assessed as subject to varying levels of threat if it has a small , fragmented or declining range , or if the total population is less than 10 @,@ 000 mature individuals , or if numbers have dropped rapidly ( by more than 10 % in ten years or three generations ) . None of the three Delichon species meets these criteria , and three genus house martins are therefore considered of least concern . 
 The numbers of the two Asian species are unknown , but both can be locally common or abundant , and the Asian house martin is extending its range in southern Siberia . The lowland breeding common house martin has greatly benefited from forest clearance , creating the open habitats it prefers , and from human habitation which has given it an abundance of safe man @-@ made nest sites , although widespread declines in its numbers have been reported from central and northern Europe since 1970 . This is due to factors including poor weather , poisoning by agricultural pesticides , lack of mud for nest building and competition with house sparrows for nest sites . Despite this , the huge geographical range and large numbers of the common house martin mean that its global status is secure .

 = = Plot = = 
 The Fringe team is brought to a nursing home , where Roscoe Joyce ( Christopher Lloyd ) , the former keyboardist of the band Violet Sedan Chair , was seen talking to his son Bobby ( Nick Ouellette ) who had died in 1985 , as well as evidence of an Observer . Walter Bishop ( John Noble ) , meeting his musical hero , requests to take Roscoe back to his lab to help Roscoe remember what his son said . Walter is able to help Roscoe remember much of his past since the loss of his son through therapy that includes helping Roscoe to recall his piano @-@ playing skills . Roscoe shortly recalls the conversation with his son , which was actually a message from the Observer September to Walter . September ( Michael Cerveris ) soon appears at the lab and requests to speak to Walter . 
 As they walk , September reminds Walter of the damage he did when he brought Peter from the parallel universe . September recounts the events of one such chain : in the prime universe , three months after Walter 's crossing , Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) captured a firefly which set into motion a chain of events that eventually led to the death of a pedestrian in a car accident . September mysteriously departs when Walter answers a telephone call , but not before leaving him with a message : " give him the keys and save the girl . " Later , Walter returns Roscoe to the nursing home . Roscoe thanks him and explains that the recent events reminded him of the last phone call he had with his son , where Bobby said he had dreamed of meeting Roscoe in a nursing home in the future . Roscoe is remorseful that Bobby died shortly after that call when a car struck him while crossing the street , which led to the breakup of the band . Walter realizes that Roscoe 's son was the pedestrian that was previously alluded to by September . 
 Unbeknownst to the Fringe team , September has engineered several events in the last few days , including stopping an armed robbery to help the asthmatic female employee ( Olivia Cheng ) recover from an asthma attack , taking her inhaler . When Walter hears of this witness , he requests Peter and Agent Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv ) to bring her to his lab , believing her to be related to the Observer 's warning . Minutes from the lab , September rams the car in which the woman is being transported , initiating another asthma attack . September races from the scene , prompting Peter to follow him in Walter 's car , requesting Walter to " give me the keys and save the girl . " Walter realizes that September has been orchestrating the events leading up to this point and urges Peter not to go , believing that following the advice of the Observer might lead to Peter 's death . Walter eventually relents and returns to help the woman , creating a makeshift inhaler before emergency help arrives . Meanwhile , Peter and Olivia follow the Observer to a rooftop . Peter corners September , who says " It must be very difficult , being a father " , before he shoots Peter with an energy blast that knocks him off his feet . Olivia arrives in time to give chase to the Observer but September disappears from an adjacent rooftop . 
 While Walter and Agent Astrid Farnsworth ( Jasika Nicole ) ensure that the witness is safe at the hospital , Olivia takes Peter back to the lab . Peter , suffering from a headache , takes an aspirin and drinks out of what he believes to be an ordinary bottle of milk from the fridge . In reality , the milk contains a serum developed by Walter in order to help him recover his full mental function . However , the serum was incorrectly prepared , which causes Peter to begin convulsing . Over the phone , Walter directs Olivia to inject Peter with the correct compounds in order to save his life . Walter realizes that the serum would have killed him if he had consumed it , and that this was another step in the Observer 's plot . Later that evening , September meets with another Observer , and identifies the fact that Walter was able to let Peter go , despite believing that he may not survive , and that when the time comes , they can expect Walter to do it again . 
 In a side plot , Olivia and Peter attempt to reorganize their relationship after Olivia receives a book ( If You Meet The Buddha On The Road , Kill Him ! by Sheldon Kopp ) from Peter that he had originally ordered for Olivia 's doppelgänger from the parallel universe .

 " The Firefly " was co @-@ written by co @-@ showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner , while being directed by Supernatural veteran Charles Beeson . On October 20 , 2010 , TV Guide announced that Back to the Future star Christopher Lloyd had been cast in an upcoming episode as " Walter 's musical hero " . Noble explained Lloyd 's role : " We all know how much Walter loves music , right ? Well this fellow was one of his icons . He adored this man . So Walter gets to be a bit of a fanboy " . Lloyd began shooting the episode in late October . Soon before the episode aired , Lloyd told reporters " I was very excited for this role . My character is going through an experience he never expected to happen to him , and he 's adjusting to that . " Lloyd also added he felt welcomed in as a part of the ensemble cast . In a conference call interview with journalists , John Noble explained that " probably the best fun that I 've had [ on Fringe ] was doing the stuff with Chris Lloyd , because it was two crazy old guys just trying desperately to communicate with each other . We had a lot of laughs . There was a common thread of trying to find the music again , because Chris ' character had forgotten how to play the piano , so we go through this journey of bringing the music back to him , and [ it 's a ] thrill to Walter . This happens all the way through this very complicated episode " . 
 The band name of Lloyd 's character Roscoe Joyce , " Violet Sedan Chair , " is a fictional band that Walter Bishop had mentioned the previous season , in the episode Grey Matters . J.J. Abrams had also named @-@ dropped the fictional band two years earlier in an issue of Wired for which he had guest @-@ edited , alluding to the band 's album , Seven Suns , recorded in the 1970s . Several months prior to the broadcast of " The Firefly " , a number of vinyl records of Seven Suns were shipped to a select number of independent record stores across the United States , which have been discovered by some people . The album does contain twelve songs in the style of psychedelic and folk . The album itself has been briefly shown in the series . 
 As with other Fringe episodes , Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children , focusing on the science seen in " The Firefly " , with the intention of having " students learn about pharmacology and the interactions that occur between a living organism and chemicals that affect normal or abnormal biochemical functions .

 Walter explains that the red and blue sunglasses he uses in order to see Roscoe Joyce 's aura were sent to him by his friend , Doctor Jacoby from Washington State . This is a reference to the television series Twin Peaks , set in Washington State where Doctor Lawrence Jacoby is the local psychiatrist who also owns a pair of the same sunglasses . Reviewers also contrasted the casting of Christopher Lloyd , better known for his role of the scientist " Doc " Brown from the Back to the Future trilogy which took place in 1985 , to that of a character involved with time travel involving the year 1985 . Some journalists have speculated that the episode 's title was in reference to Joss Whedon 's Firefly series , which while critically acclaimed was cancelled mid @-@ season after being scheduled in the Friday night death slot . However , though " The Firefly " was the first Fringe episode to be first aired in the new Friday night slot , the producer had already selected the title of the episode prior to the Fox Network rescheduling .

 In November 2010 , Fox announced that Fringe was being moved to Friday nights as a part of the network 's midseason overhaul , to air after the fourth season of their reality series Kitchen Nightmares . The move meant that Fringe would be airing against Supernatural , a show with a similar science fiction genre , though this competition did not begin until Fringe 's third Friday episode " Concentrate and Ask Again " . Fox 's popular reality series American Idol took Fringe 's timeslot , as it was shifted a day later to Wednesdays and Thursdays . Executive producer J.H. Wyman stated in an interview that they were excited and believed Friday nights are " open territory that can be conquered ... [ We believe ] we can actually deliver like The X @-@ Files did . ... I think we both agree it 's a good opportunity " . Wyman elaborated that the show 's high DVR numbers proved that though fans were watching the show , they did not want to do so on Thursdays . Co @-@ executive producer Jeff Pinkner felt that if the show " can build a fan base on and carve out some territory on Friday night , we can be there for years " . 
 The episode was originally going to air on January 28 until it was moved to a week earlier , on January 21 behind the season premiere of Kitchen Nightmares . " The Firefly " was the first Fringe episode to broadcast in its Friday slot , and many journalists considered the pending viewership numbers critical for the future of the show . The episode was the most watched show of the night , earning a 1 @.@ 9 / 6 share or about 4 @.@ 88 million viewers in the 18 – 49 age group . This figure was slightly higher than the average viewership for Fringe in the first half of the 2010 @-@ 2011 television season , and 18 % higher than the previous episode , " Marionette " . When time shifted viewership over the following three days is considered , the episode received a 42 % ratings increase with a 2 @.@ 7 rating share , and within 7 days after its airing , reported a total of 6 @.@ 7 million viewers with 2 @.@ 8 rating , representing a 37 % increase from the live broadcast .

 " The Firefly " was well received by critics who considered the episode to be backed by a strong script . Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered " The Firefly " as one of the series ' " finest episodes " , calling on the show 's many qualities : 
 The pull of family ; the knotty complexity of romance ; the way sci @-@ fi can provide fresh metaphors for the most frequently explored ideas and emotions ; the way we encounter humor and surprise even in the midst of anguish and regret — this is the stuff of which Fringe is made . 
 The A.V. Club 's Zack Handlen rated the episode an " A " in considering the " elegance " of the complicated Rube Goldberg @-@ like plot , and praised the " beautiful , beautiful writing " in the reveal of the connection between Walter 's actions and Roscoe 's loss . Time 's James Poniewozik also enjoyed the elegant plot , calling the episode " an impressive outing for the series to welcome back its fans with " ; Poniewozik also appreciated John Noble 's performance as he " made Walter 's regret , and the toll it has taken , real — while also pulling off an amusing turn as an overawed , elderly rock fanboy " . 
 Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times , though somewhat confused to the cause @-@ and @-@ effect of the Observer 's plot , he still found the show enjoyable , and called it " the Fringe version of the butterfly effect " , a trope often used in other shows to show the impact of small changes in the characters ' lives . IGN 's Ramsey Isler gave the episode a rating of 7 @.@ 5 / 10 , stating that was " an important part of the setup for the second half of the season " with strong character development , but felt the pacing was slow and needed more action . Television Without Pity graded the episode a " B + " . The A.V. Club staff highlighted the episode in their review of the best television shows of 2011 .

 = Ironsword : Wizards & Warriors II = 
 Ironsword : Wizards & Warriors II is a platforming action @-@ adventure video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) developed by UK @-@ based company Zippo Games , a subsidiary of Rare Ltd. it was published by Acclaim and released in North America in December 1989 and in Europe on March 27 , 1991 . It is the sequel to Rare 's 1987 title Wizards & Warriors . In Ironsword , the player controls the knight warrior Kuros as he ventures in the land of Sindarin . He must defeat the evil wizard Malkil , who has assumed the elemental forms of Earth , Wind , Fire , and Water . Kuros must collect the parts of and assemble the legendary " IronSword " in order to defeat Malkil , who resides at the top of IceFire Mountain . 
 Ironsword : Wizards & Warriors II was developed by Zippo Games ' founder Ste Pickford and was the first game that he developed for the NES . Steve Hughes also assisted in development , while Rare 's video game composer David Wise did the music and sound . Pickford wanted to expand on the previous Wizards & Warriors game . Having experience with developing computer games , Pickford used various animation and graphics techniques to try and show off the NES ' graphical capabilities . In addition , Acclaim hired Italian male model Fabio Lanzoni to pose as Kuros on the game 's cover . 
 The game was fairly well @-@ received , selling 500 @,@ 000 copies in North America and 50 @,@ 000 copies in Europe . Various video game magazines praised Ironsword for its size , graphics and sound , detailed characters and bosses , and gameplay . Other reviews criticized its lack of originality as compared to other games that were released at the time . The game led Zippo Games to develop additional games for Rare on the NES such as Solar Jetman : Hunt for the Golden Warpship and Wizards & Warriors III : Kuros : Visions of Power . Ironsword won " Game Player 's NES Excellence Award " from Game Players magazine as one of the better NES titles of 1990 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Ironsword : Wizards & Warriors II is a platforming video game where the player controls the renowned warrior Kuros as he explores the land of Sindarin to defeat the evil wizard Malkil . This time , Malkil has taken the form of the four " Elementals " , based on the Greek classical elements – Earth , Wind , Fire , and Water – to stop Kuros in his quest . The objective is to assemble the legendary " IronSword " — the only weapon that can defeat Malkil — and defeat the evil wizard who lies at the peak of IceFire Mountain . In the game , players can move Kuros left or right , or make him crouch with the control pad ; the buttons allow Kuros to jump , to use his sword or a magic spell to defeat enemies , to access the " Magic Spell Screen " , or to pause the game . Kuros has a life meter that decreases every time he sustains damage from an enemy or a dangerous projectile , or if he falls for too long a distance . Along the way , players can collect chicken and brew to replenish Kuros ' life meter . Kuros loses a life when his life meter runs out , and the game ends when he loses all his lives . However , players may continue and restart the game where they left off up to two times . The continue feature would normally be disabled after the player had completed the earth domain , but due to an in @-@ game bug , the player actually loses the continue function immediately upon merely setting foot in the domain . 
 Ironsword : Wizards & Warriors II consists of four levels called " domains , " each named after the four elementals . In each domain , Kuros must find a golden artifact that belongs to the domain 's " Animal King " and return it to him . Upon doing so , the path to the second part of the domain will appear . In the second part , Kuros must find the magic spell necessary to defeat the boss – the domain 's Elemental . Without the spell , it is impossible to damage the boss . Once the elemental in each stage has been destroyed , Kuros obtains a piece of the IronSword , which is needed for the final battle on <unk> Mountain . Throughout the game , players must collect items , spells , and money to progress . Money helps buy magic spells , more powerful weapons , shields , helmets , keys to open locked treasure chests , and additional food . Treasure chests — located throughout the game — can contain one of the following items : Additional money , magic spells , or weapon and armor upgrades . In each domain , players can visit inns where they can buy food , keys , or items ; they may also participate in a " Bonus chance " game where they may gamble their money to see which cup a bouncing skull will fall into . 
 In the game , magic spells help against enemies and Elemental bosses ; some are bought , while others must be found . Magic spells include " The Familiar Spell , " which turns enemies into money and helps retrieve golden objects , the " Dragon Tooth Spell , " which turns enemies into food , the " Asp Tongue Spell , " which slows down enemies , the " Silver Fleece Spell , " which makes Kuros temporarily invincible , and the " Water Spout Spell , " which creates an upward column of water that allows Kuros to reach high places . Each spell has a limited number of uses before it vanished from the player 's inventory . Other magic spells are necessary to defeat the Elemental bosses . These spells are found in each of the four domains , and include " <unk> , " " <unk> , " " <unk> " and " <unk> . " These spells can be used only in the corresponding levels in which they are obtained , and each consumes magic upon <unk> players can obtain additional magic by collecting small , floating , gold bubbles that appear randomly or are triggered by the player 's proximity to secret locations . 
 Players may also increase their score by defeating enemies or collecting items . Hidden along the way are the " Relics of Sindarin , " which are worth many points when collected . At the end of the game , players with a high enough of a score can place their names in the " IronSword Hall of Fame . " However , the list resets when the console is turned off . The game also includes a password feature in which players can obtain a password from the " Magic Spell Screen " to use to continue the game at a later time , even after the console has been turned off .

 Ironsword : Wizards & Warriors II was developed by UK @-@ based computer game company Zippo Games , headed by Ste and John Pickford ; this was the first game Zippo developed for fellow UK @-@ based video game company Rare . At the time , Zippo Games had just completed a previous game titled Cosmic Pirate - a game that was published by Palace Software and released for the Commodore 64 , Atari ST , and Amiga in 1988 . New to the technical capabilities of the Nintendo Entertainment System , the Pickford brothers visited Rare and were pleased with their NES library , though they thought they were backtracking by deciding to develop games for the console . According to Ste Pickford : " The NES seemed primitive by comparison , sub @-@ Commodore 64 . But the games were ten times better than everything being released for home computers , which we appreciated , and we wanted to try to make games as good as that . " Rare decided to hire Zippo Games to develop this Wizards & Warriors sequel ; Pickford remarked : " Rare showed us Wizards & Warriors and asked us to develop the sequel , and pretty much left us to it . " Rare felt that Zippo Games was trustworthy enough to develop the sequel without much help from them . 
 Development started in early 1989 , when the Pickford brothers were still learning about the NES and what it could do . At the same time , as being new to developing console video games , they were also learning about the market aspects and Nintendo 's policies and restrictions on games . Feeling that the graphics in most of the games in the NES library were poor , they placed emphasis on the graphics and animation . Pickford was particularly pleased with the animation of the enemy eagles and their movement . Rare assisted with the sound , and all of the game 's background music was composed by video game composer David Wise , who Pickford said " did a fantastic job on IronSword " . As far as gameplay was concerned , they tried to expand upon its predecessor , introducing more adventure @-@ based gameplay and additional RPG elements such as magic , inns , and money . 
 = = = Graphics and animation = = = 
 Ste Pickford developed the gameplay map for Ironsword . According to him , he basically copied the map that was used in a conversion port of Ghosts ' n Goblins that he developed a couple of years earlier . Moreover , the Pickford brothers were trying to resemble Ghosts ' n Goblins and similar games by Capcom as part of their attempt to earn the rights to develop the game from Rare . For the map screen , Ste Pickford used specific character data in the ROM itself , used the font from elsewhere in the data that was inserted separately , and overlaid the Elementals ' floating heads over the top of the graphic . According to Pickford : " The job of graphic was always about 30 % drawing , and about 70 % fiddly technical stuff ( which was why so many terrible artists – people who couldn 't draw at all – made decent video game artists back then , if they could manage the technical side of things well enough ) . " 
 In developing the game 's graphics , Ste Pickford translated black and white sketches into the character maps in the game . For the bosses , the plan was to use the entire screen while involving as few moving sprites as possible " to fool the player into thinking the whole thing was alive " . The same was done with the " Dragon King " , which was not one of the game 's bosses ; the dragon 's head and neck were composed of sprites , while the rest of the body was considered part of the background . The dragon 's neck stretched out vertically due to NES hardware sprite limitations horizontally . 
 The animation of the eagle ( the " Eagle King " ) that transports Kuros to the Wind Elemental was one of Ste Pickford 's first graphics which he drew for the NES . It was done in Deluxe Paint for the Amiga with sketching done by mouse - without assistance from graphics tablets or other scanners . He took eagle drawings from a book on animals in motion by Eadweard Muybridge . Pickford wanted to show off the possible graphical capabilities of the NES ; he said , " I wanted to do something ' flashy ' early in the game , trying to show off my amazing graphic art skills on the rather primitive NES . We were working on Amiga and ST games at the same time , so were always trying to push the NES with bigger and better graphics , right from the start of our work on the machine . " The eagle consisted of only three colors and between 11 and 17 sprites per frame of animation . There was a smaller version of the same eagle , which was used as a regular enemy in that level . 
 Development of the game 's title screen was inspired by loading screens that were used in most computer games at the time ; the objective was to create a nice @-@ looking graphic while waiting for the game to load , even though the NES , more rooted in arcade traditions , did not require that . Pickford spent most of his character space on the title screen image ; he was limited in the number of available colors due to the more limited graphic capabilities of the NES ( as opposed to most home computers ) , as it was more designed for scrolling and animation and not for stationary graphics . The sword in the title screen used character sprites and used a different palette from the picture of Kuros himself ; the sword had to be vertical as the NES hardware did not allow for too many sprites horizontally . Pickford planned to use and completed an Ironsword logo of his own when Acclaim made him use their planned logo , which he said " was a bit more bland and blocky , with detail that didn 't work very well at such a low pixel resolution " .

 Ironsword : Wizards & Warriors II was first unveiled in North America as part of the 1989 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas , Nevada and was displayed with other games to be released later that year by Acclaim . It was mentioned as a future game in the May 1989 premiere issue of video gaming magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly . It was also covered in GamePro 's premiere issue in May 1989 . Finally , it was previewed by Nintendo Power in its July – August 1989 issue . 
 For the game 's cover , Acclaim hired Italian male model Fabio Lanzoni to pose as Kuros ; Fabio was presented on the cover bare @-@ chested and without armor . When Zippo Games saw the image of the cover a week prior to its release , they were perplexed . According to Ste Pickford , " Our jaws hit the floor when we first saw this image ( which was , being merely the developers , probably about a week before the game 's release ) . Why on earth did they choose a photograph of a bare @-@ chested barbarian to promote a game starring a knight in shining armour ? " . Pickford added that " We used it as an example of the lack of imagination of Americans " , while suggesting that having an actual suit or armor would be too costly to use for a photo shoot . Ironsword : Wizards & Warriors II was released by Acclaim for the NES in North America in December 1989 and in Europe and Australia in 1991 . It managed to sell about 500 @,@ 000 copies in North America and about 50 @,@ 000 copies in Europe . Following the game 's release , Zippo Games would proceed to develop its next game for Rare , Solar Jetman : Hunt for the Golden Warpship ; they would eventually also release the third installment in the Wizards & Warriors series , Wizards & Warriors III : Kuros : Visions of Power . 
 The television advertisement consisted of a boy who is shown playing the first Wizards & Warriors game when a Conan the Barbarian @-@ lookalike enters his room after having defeated a monster and hands him a copy of Ironsword . After describing the brief plot and shortly showing clips of the game , the Conan @-@ lookalike leaves his room while exclaiming , " The fate of the world is in your hands ! Back vile beast ! " . At the end of the commercial , after briefly playing Ironsword , the boy opens the door in his room , only to find his dog , who now has smoke coming from his behind .

 Ironsword : Wizards & Warriors II was initially reviewed and received positive ratings in the June 1989 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly . Steve Harris said that the game was very large and expansive , noting that it " is so big , and has so much to offer , most of the competition pales by comparison " . Ed Semrad called the game " a worthy sequel that fortunately is better than the original " , similarly noting the game 's size as well as difficulty . Donn Nauert appreciated the game 's good graphics which complement the adventure theme , but he noted that some of the precise movements that are required in various areas may cause some frustration in gameplay . Jim Allee praised all the aspects of the game , saying " if you liked Wizards & Warriors , you 'll love Ironsword " . All four reviewers lauded the game 's involving gameplay and graphics . 
 The game would also be featured in the magazine 's September 1989 issue , in which it was named the magazine 's " Game of the Month " ; it also featured the game 's box art , with Fabio , on the cover . The reviewers , the U.S. National Video Game Team , noted that the game was superior to its predecessor as well as other games released at the time , noting that it was particularly better than Castlevania II : Simon 's Quest . They praised its well @-@ detailed and thought @-@ out graphics , the inclusion of well @-@ drawn out large bosses and supporting characters , the sound which " has an eerie tone that sets the mood for the whole game " , and additional features which expanded upon the game 's predecessor . They concluded that Ironsword was " one of the most welcome Nintendo Entertainment System games in a long time " . The game was also one of the featured games in the November – December 1989 issue of Nintendo Power , where it received six pages of coverage and featured a poster of the game . Game Players magazine awarded Ironsword the " Game Player 's NES Excellence Award " as one of the best games for the console in 1990 . 
 The game was also featured in UK @-@ based magazine Mean Machines in May 1991 . Matt Regan said that he was not impressed with the game , saying that similar platforming games such as <unk> and Gremlins 2 : The New Batch were superior to Ironsword and had a more original approach in gameplay . He also criticized the fact that players cannot hit enemies while in mid @-@ air . However , he noted the game 's good gameplay . Julian Rignall also said that the game was fun , but it was not spectacular . However , just as Regan noted , Rignall said that the game did not offer anything special like with better titles such as Mega Man 2 or Super Mario Bros. 2 . However , he noted the game 's good graphics and challenge , though both noted that the backgrounds " are slightly bland " . Both reviewers said the game was well @-@ presented with good introductions and a password mode , easy controls , fair challenge , and " fairly good tunes and effects which fit the action well " . Overall , they said that Ironsword was " a fun but ultimately limited game that will appeal to platform fans " . 
 Ironsword : Wizards & Warriors II was listed at # 64 in IGN 's list of " Top 100 NES Games " . Reviewer Sam Claiborn said that the game was more expansive than its predecessor and that it featured many of the good graphics , gameplay , and usage of Middle English . He also noted that " Fabio 's bare @-@ breasted likeness smoldering on IronSword 's cover art that made this game a smash hit with kids and moms alike " . Website GamesRadar praised the game 's music , especially the title theme ; Brett Elston said it set a serious tone for the game , saying " its heavy , droning beats mix with a fantasy @-@ minded melody that make it sound like a funeral dirge in the Shire " . 
 The game 's cover , which features Fabio , has received significant coverage from many gaming websites . IGN listed Ironsword as having one of the most notable covers in video game history , listing its cover as the 2nd best of all time behind Ninja Golf . Conversely , 1UP.com listed Ironsword as having one of the worst covers of all time , comparing it to the cover for Mega Man . GameSpy listed it as the 4th worst video game cover in history , saying that " thanks to the presence of Fabio on the cover , gamers got confused and thought they had accidentally picked up one of their mom 's romance novels " . In a retrospective of the NES for the console 's 25th anniversary , Nintendo Power wrote that " the game 's quality will be forever overshadowed by Acclaim 's choice of Fabio as the cover model " . 
 = Unas = 
 Unas / <unk> / or <unk> , also spelled <unk> ( hellenized form <unk> / <unk> / or Onnos ) , was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh , the ninth and last ruler of the Fifth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom period . Unas reigned for 15 to 30 years in the mid @-@ 24th century BC succeeding Djedkare Isesi , who might have been his father . Little is known of Unas ' activities during his reign , which was a time of economic decline . Egypt maintained trade relations with the Levantine coast and Nubia , and military action may have taken place in southern Canaan . The growth and decentralization of the administration in conjunction with the lessening of the king 's power continued under Unas , ultimately contributing to the collapse of the Old Kingdom some 200 years later . 
 Unas built a pyramid in Saqqara , the smallest of the royal pyramids completed during the Old Kingdom . The accompanying mortuary complex with its high and valley temples linked by a 750 m ( 2 @,@ 460 ft ) long causeway was lavishly decorated with painted reliefs , whose quality and variety surpass the usual royal iconography . Furthermore , Unas was the first pharaoh to have the Pyramid Texts carved and painted on the walls of the chambers of his pyramid , a major innovation that was followed by his successors until the First Intermediate Period ( c . 2160 – c . 2050 BC ) . These texts identify the king with Ra and with Osiris , whose cult was on the rise in Unas ' time , and were meant to help the king reach the afterlife . 
 Unas had several daughters and possibly one or two sons who are believed to have predeceased him . Manetho , an Egyptian priest of the Ptolemaic period and author of the first history of Egypt , claims that with Unas ' death the Fifth Dynasty came to an end . Unas was succeeded by Teti , the first pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty , possibly after a short crisis . However the archaeological evidence suggests that the Egyptians at the time made no conscious break with the preceding dynasty and the distinction between the Fifth and Sixth dynasties might be illusory . 
 The funerary cult of Unas established at his death continued until the end of the Old Kingdom and may have survived during the chaotic First Intermediate Period . The cult was still in existence or revived during the later Middle Kingdom ( c . 2050 – c . 1650 BC ) . This did not prevent Amenemhat I and Senusret I ( c . 1990 – c . 1930 BC ) from partially dismantling the mortuary complex of Unas for its materials . In parallel to the official cult , Unas may have received popular veneration as a local god of the Saqqara necropolis until as late as the Late Period ( 664 – 332 BC ) , nearly 2000 years after his death . 
 = = Attestations = = 
 = = = Historical sources = = = 
 Unas is well attested by historical sources with three ancient Egyptian king lists dating to the New Kingdom period mentioning him . Unas occupies the 33rd entry of the Abydos King List , which was written during the reign of Seti I ( 1290 – 1279 BC ) . Unas ' name is also present on the Saqqara Tablet ( 32nd entry ) and on the Turin canon ( third column , 25th row ) , both of which were written during the reign of Ramses II ( 1279 – 1213 BC ) . The Turin canon further credits Unas with 30 years of reign . These sources all place Unas as the ninth and final ruler of the Fifth Dynasty , succeeding Djedkare Isesi and preceding Teti on the throne . This relative chronology is corroborated by archaeological evidence , for example in the tomb of officials serving under these kings . 
 In addition to these sources , Unas was also likely mentioned in the Aegyptiaca , a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II ( 283 – 246 BC ) by the Egyptian priest Manetho . No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived to this day and it is known to us only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius . Africanus relates that the Aegyptiaca mentioned a pharaoh " Onnos " reigning for 33 years at the end of the Fifth Dynasty . Onnos is believed to be the hellenized form for Unas , and Africanus ' 33 @-@ year figure fits well with the 30 years of reign given to Unas on the Turin canon . 
 = = = Contemporaneous sources = = = 
 The primary contemporaneous sources attesting to Unas ' activities are the many reliefs from his pyramid complex . Excluding these , surprisingly few documents dating to Unas ' reign have survived to this day , considering the 30 @-@ year length that later records give for his reign . Excavations at Abusir , the royal necropolis of the Fifth Dynasty , have produced only four dated inscriptions safely attributable to Unas . They explicitly mention his third , fourth , sixth and eighth years on the throne . Unas also left a rock inscription on the island of Elephantine , next to the First Cataract of the Nile in Nubia . 
 In addition , several alabaster vases bearing Unas ' cartouche are known . A complete vessel and additional fragments originating from Byblos on the Levantine coast are now in the National Museum of Beirut . A vase of unknown provenance is located in the National Archaeological Museum of Florence and reads " Horus <unk> , living eternally , king of Upper and Lower Egypt , son of Ra , Unas , living eternally " . Another vessel , of unknown origins , is on display at the Louvre Museum . It is a 17 cm ( 6 @.@ 7 in ) tall 13 @.@ 2 cm ( 5 @.@ 2 in ) large globular alabaster vase finely decorated with a falcon with outstretched wings and two uraei , or rearing cobras , holding ankh signs surrounding Unas ' cartouche . An ointment jar bearing Unas ' cartouche and Horus name is in the Brooklyn Museum . Finally , a fragment of a calcite vase rim bearing two cartouches of Unas is on display in the Petrie Museum . 
 = = Reign = = 
 = = = Family = = = 
 Unas assumed the throne at the death of his predecessor Djedkare Isesi . Djedkare is thought to have been Unas ' father , in spite of the complete lack of evidence bearing on the question . The succession from Djedkare Isesi to Unas seems to have been smooth . 
 Unas had at least two queens , Nebet and <unk> , who were buried in a large double mastaba adjacent to their husband 's pyramid . Unas and Nebet possibly had a son , the " king 's son " , " royal chamberlain " , " priest of Maat " and " overseer of Upper Egypt " Unas @-@ Ankh , who died about 10 years into Unas ' reign . The filiation of Unas @-@ Ankh is indirectly hinted at by his name and titles and by the presence of his tomb near those of Nebet and Unas but is not universally accepted . Two other sons have been proposed , <unk> and <unk> , but these <unk> are conjectural and contested . Unas likely died without a male heir . 
 Unas had at least five daughters named <unk> Hemi , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> Iku , and <unk> <unk> . The status of another possible daughter , Iput , is uncertain . 
 = = = Duration = = = 
 The duration of Unas ' reign is uncertain . As indicated above , historical sources credit him with 30 and 33 years on the throne , figures that have been adopted by many Egyptologists , including Flinders Petrie , William C. Hayes , Darrell Baker , Peter Munro , and Jaromir Malek . In favor of such a long reign are scenes of a Sed festival found in Unas ' mortuary temple . This festival was normally celebrated only after 30 years of reign and was meant to rejuvenate the pharaoh 's strength and power . Mere depictions of the festival do not necessarily imply a long reign however , for example a relief showing pharaoh Sahure in the tunic of the Sed festival has been found in his mortuary temple , although both historical sources and archeological evidence agree that he ruled Egypt for less than 14 full years . 
 Other Egyptologists suspect a reign of less than 30 years for Unas owing to the scarcity of artefacts datable to his reign as well as the lack of documents dated to beyond his eighth year on the throne . Hence , Jürgen von Beckerath believes that Unas ruled Egypt for 20 years while Rolf Krauss , David Warburton and Erik Hornung shortened this number to 15 years in their 2012 study of Egyptian chronology . Krauss and Miroslav Verner further question the credibility of the Turin canon concerning the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties , so that the 30 years figure credited to Unas by the canon might not be reliable . 
 Excavations of the tomb of Nikau @-@ Isesi under the direction of Naguib Kanawati at Saqqara have yielded evidence in support of a shorter reign . Nikau @-@ Isesi was an official who started his career during the reign of Djedkare Isesi , lived through that of Unas and died as overseer of Upper @-@ Egypt under Unas ' successor Teti . Nikau @-@ Isesi is known to have died on the year of the eleventh cattle count during Teti 's reign , an event consisting of counting the livestock throughout the country to evaluate the amount of taxes to be levied . It is traditionally believed that such counts occurred every two years during the Old Kingdom and every year during the later Middle Kingdom ( <unk> – c.1650 BC ) . Thus Nikau @-@ Isesi would have lived for 22 years after Teti took the throne and together with the 30 years of reign credited to Unas , would have died past 70 years old . However , forensic examination of his mummy yielded an age at death of no more than 45 years old . This suggests that the cattle count occurred more than once every two years during Unas and Teti 's time , possibly irregularly . If so , Unas ' 30 years figure on the Turin canon , understood to mean 15 cattle counts , could translate into as little as 15 years , which together with just 11 years during Teti 's reign would account for Nikau @-@ Isesi 's death at around 40 – 45 years of age . 
 = = = Activities = = = 
 Trade and warfare 
 Owing to the scarcity of evidence dating to Unas ' reign , we know very little about his activities . Existing trade relations with foreign countries and cities , in particular Byblos , seem to have continued during Unas ' time on the throne . Reliefs from the causeway of his pyramid complex show two large seagoing ships coming back from an expedition to the Levantine coast with Syro @-@ Canaanite men , who were either the boat crews or slaves . Another relief depicts a military campaign , Egyptians armed with bows and daggers attacking Canaanite nomads called the <unk> . Similar reliefs have been found in preceding pyramid complexes , such as that of Sahure , and they may thus be standard themes rather than depictions of actual events . Other sources tend to confirm the accuracy of these depictions however , for example the autobiography of <unk> relates many punitive raids against Canaanite nomads in the early Sixth Dynasty . 
 To the South of Egypt , inscriptions of Unas on Elephantine record a visit of the king to Lower Nubia , possibly to receive tribute from local chieftains or because of growing unrest in the region . In addition , a relief from the causeway of Unas leading to his pyramid shows a giraffe , suggesting trade relations with Nubia . 
 Domestic 
 Unas ' reign was a time of economic decline although , as the French Egyptologist Nicolas Grimal writes , it was " by no means a time of decadence " . Indeed , the Egyptian state was still capable of mounting important expeditions to provide building stones for the king 's pyramid complex . These expeditions are depicted on unique reliefs found in Unas ' causeway and are also referred to in the autobiographical stela of an administration official . This official reports the transport of 10 @.@ 40 m ( 34 @.@ 1 ft ) tall palmiform columns of red granite from Elephantine to Saqqara in only four days , a feat for which he was praised by the king . In addition to the important construction works undertaken in Saqqara for the construction of his pyramid complex , building activities also took place on Elephantine . 
 Until 1996 , the domestic situation during Unas ' reign was thought to have been disastrous , based on reliefs from the causeway of his pyramid complex showing emaciated people and thus suggesting times of famine . This changed when excavations at Abusir in 1996 yielded similar reliefs in the mortuary complex of Sahure , who reigned at a prosperous time in the early Fifth Dynasty . In addition , research showed that the starving people are likely to be desert dwellers , nomads distinguished by their specific hair @-@ style , rather than Egyptians . Thus , these reliefs are now understood to be standard representations of the generosity of the king towards the destitute and of the hardships of life in the desert regions bordering Egypt rather than referring to actual events . 
 = = = Death and end of a dynasty = = = 
 In his history of Egypt Manetho states that with the death of Unas the Fifth Dynasty came to an end . This may be because Unas died without a male heir , his probable son Unas @-@ Ankh having predeceased him . This might have caused a succession crisis hinted at by the personal name chosen by Teti upon his accession to the throne : " <unk> " meaning " He who reconciles / pacifies the two lands " . Teti 's claim to the throne could have relied on his marriage to Iput , who may have been a daughter of Unas . This possibility is heavily debated , as the interpretation of Iput 's titles that would indicate that she was the daughter of a king is uncertain . Furthermore , the idea that Teti could legitimate his claim by marrying into the royal family is rejected by many Egyptologists , including Munro , Dobrev , Baud , Mertz , <unk> , and Robin , who do not think that the right to the pharaonic throne passed through the female line . 
 In addition to Manetho 's statement , the Turin king list presents a special break point between Unas and his successor Teti . Although the king list is not organized in dynasties – which were invented by Manetho – the Egyptologist Jaromir Malek explains that " the criterion for such divisions in the Turin Canon invariably was the change of location of the capital and royal residence . " Malek thus suggests that the capital of Egypt , then known as <unk> @-@ <unk> , was indeed supplanted at the time by settlements located to the South , East of South Saqqara , where Unas ' palace may have been located . In the second millennium BC these cities finally merged and gave rise to Memphis . 
 Whatever the basis for Manetho 's choice to end the Fifth Dynasty with Unas , Egyptians living at the time probably perceived no particular change from one dynasty to the next . The administration of the state shows no evidence of disturbances , with many officials continuing their careers from Unas ' onto Teti 's reign . These include the viziers Mehu , Kagemni and Nikau @-@ Isesi and the overseer of the province of Edfu <unk> . Given that the Egyptians of the Old Kingdom might not have conceived of dynasties , the distinction between the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties might be illusory . 
 = = Evolution of religion and kingship = = 
 The reigns of Djedkare Isesi and of Unas were a time of changes in Ancient Egyptian religion and in the ideology of kingship , changes that are first demonstrable under Unas . A statistical analysis of clay seal fragments bearing Horus names of pharaohs of the Fifth Dynasty points to a marked decline of the cult of the king during Unas ' time on the throne . This continued under Unas ' successor Teti , for whom we know only two seals bearing his Horus name . This trend reflects the lessening of the king 's power in conjunction with the growth of the administration and priesthood . 
 Meanwhile , the cult of Osiris was becoming more important with this god replacing the king as the guarantor of life after death for the pharaoh 's subjects . The German Egyptologist Hartwig Altenmüller writes that for an Egyptian of the time " the [ ... ] afterlife no longer depends on the relationship between the individual mortal and the king , [ ... ] instead it is linked to his ethical position in direct relation to Osiris " . In contrast , the cult of the sun god Ra was in apparent decline , even though Ra was still the most important deity of the Egyptian pantheon . Thus , Djedkare Isesi and Unas did not build a sun temple in contrast with most of their Fifth Dynasty predecessors . In addition , the names of Menkauhor Kaiu and Unas do not incorporate any reference to Ra , in rupture with a tradition which held since the reign of Userkaf , about a century earlier . The Pyramid Texts found in Unas ' pyramid demonstrate the importance of Osiris and Ra in ancient Egyptian religion at the time . Both gods were believed to play the key roles in accessing the afterlife , with Ra as the source of life and Osiris as the force through which the next life would be attained . 
 = = Pyramid = = 
 Unas had a pyramid built for himself in North Saqqara , between the pyramid of Sekhemkhet and the southwestern corner of the pyramid complex of Djoser , in symmetry with the pyramid of Userkaf located at the northeastern corner . In the process , workers leveled and covered older tombs located in the area , most notably the tomb of the Second Dynasty pharaoh Hotepsekhemwy ( c . 2890 BC ) . 
 The original Egyptian name of the pyramid was " Nefer <unk> Unas " , meaning " Beautiful are the places of Unas " . The pyramid of Unas is the smallest of the pyramids completed during the Old Kingdom , having a square base of 57 @.@ 7 m × 57 @.@ 7 m ( 189 ft × 189 ft ) for a height of 43 m ( 141 ft ) . 
 = = = Mortuary complex = = = 
 The pyramid of Unas is part of a larger mortuary complex built around it . It was approached via an ancient lake on the shores of which Unas ' valley temple was located . This temple received the provisions for the cult of the king and the offerings to be made were prepared there . At the back of the valley temple was the beginning of a 750 m ( 2 @,@ 460 ft ) -long causeway , equaled only by that of Khufu , and leading to an upper temple adjacent to the pyramid . A thin slit in the roof of the causeway allowed the light to illuminate its walls covered for their entire length in painted reliefs . These depicted the Egyptian seasons , processions of people from the nomes of Egypt , craftsmen at work , offerings bearers , battle scenes and the transport of granite columns for the construction of the pyramid complex . 
 At the end of the causeway was a large hall leading to a pillared open court surrounded by magazine chambers . The court led into the mortuary temple proper which housed statues of the king and where the offerings to the deceased took place . This was immediately adjacent to the eastern side of the pyramid , which was surrounded by an enclosure wall defining the sacred space . At the southeast corner of the enclosure was a small satellite pyramid for the Ka of the king . The internal chambers of the pyramid were entered in 1881 by Gaston Maspero , who thus discovered the pyramid texts . The burial chamber housed nothing but a black basalt sarcophagus sunk into the floor and a canopic chest . The sarcophagus proved to contain scattered bones , which may belong to Unas . 
 = = = Pyramid Texts = = = 
 The main innovation of the pyramid of Unas is the first appearance of the Pyramid Texts , one of the oldest religious texts in Egypt to have survived to this day . In doing so , Unas initiated a tradition that would be followed in the pyramid of the kings and queens of the Sixth to Eighth Dynasties , until the end of the Old Kingdom circa 200 years later . 
 In total 283 magical spells , also known as utterances , were carved and the signs painted blue on the walls of the corridor , antechamber , and burial chamber of Unas ' pyramid . They constitute the most complete rendition of the Pyramid Texts existing today . These spells were intended to help the king in overcoming hostile forces and powers in the Underworld and thus join with the sun god Ra , his divine father in the afterlife . By writing the texts on the walls of the pyramid internal chambers , the architects of Unas ' pyramid ensured that the king would benefit from their potency even if the funerary cult was to cease . Hence , the Pyramid Texts of the pyramid of Unas incorporate instructions for ritual actions and words to be spoken , suggesting that they were precisely those performed and recited during the cult of the king in his mortuary temple . 
 The good preservation of the texts in Unas ' pyramid shows that they were arranged so as to be read by the Ba of Unas , as it arose from the sarcophagus thanks to resurrection utterances and surrounded by protective spells and ritual offerings . The Ba would then leave the burial chamber , which incorporates texts identifying the king with Osiris in the Duat , and would move to the antechamber symbolizing the Akhet . Included in the spells written on the walls of the antechamber of Unas are two utterances known as the Cannibal Hymn , which portrays the pharaoh as flying to heaven through a stormy sky and eating both gods and men . In doing so the king would receive the life force of the gods . At this point the Ba of Unas would face east , the direction of the sunrise , and beyond the pyramid masonry , the false door of the mortuary temple where funerary rituals were performed . Finally , turning left the Ba would join Ra in the sky by passing through the pyramid corridor . 
 An example of a spell from the pyramid of Unas is <unk> 217 : 
 Re @-@ Atum , this Unas comes to you 
 A spirit indestructible 
 Your son comes to you 
 This Unas comes to you 
 May you cross the sky united in the dark 
 May you rise in <unk> , the place in which you shine ! 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Unas ' most immediate legacy is his funerary cult , which continued at least until the end of the Old Kingdom . This cult is attested by the tombs at Saqqara of seven priests responsible for the religious duties to be performed in the funerary complex . Three of these tombs date to the early Sixth Dynasty in the time following the death of Pepi I. Three more tombs date to the reign of Pepi II and the last one dates to the very end of the Old Kingdom ( c . 2180 BC ) . The priests of the cult of Unas adopted <unk> names , incorporating that of the king , possibly upon taking office . 
 Unas ' funerary cult appears to have survived during the chaotic First Intermediate Period until the Middle Kingdom . By the time of the 12th Dynasty ( c . 1990 – c . 1800 BC ) , the lector @-@ priest <unk> and his family were involved in the cult of Unas . In spite of this , Unas ' funerary complex was partially dismantled and its materials <unk> for the construction of Amenemhat I and Senusret I own pyramid complexes . 
 In addition to his official cult , Unas was deified and became a local god of the Saqqara necropolis . Grimal attributes this directly to the grandeur of his funerary complex . Malek doubts the existence of a popular cult of Unas during the Old Kingdom but acknowledges it from the Middle Kingdom onwards . He attributes this Middle Kingdom revival to the geographic position of Unas ' complex making it a natural gateway to the Saqqara necropolis . The popular cult of the deified Unas continued for nearly 2000 years as shown by the numerous scarabs bearing Unas ' name found in Saqqara and dated from the New Kingdom ( <unk> – <unk> BC ) until the Late Period ( 664 – 332 BC ) . The epicenter of this cult was not the pyramid of Unas nor the associated mortuary temple but rather the statues of the king in the valley temple . This activity could explain why the pyramid complex of Unas was the object of restoration works under the impulse of Prince Khaemweset , a son of Ramesses II ( 1279 – 1213 BC ) . 
 = Bulldog Drummond = 
 Bulldog Drummond is a British fictional character , created by H. C. McNeile and published under his pen name " Sapper " . After an unsuccessful one @-@ off appearance as a policeman in The Strand Magazine , the character was reworked by McNeile into a gentleman adventurer for his 1920 novel Bulldog Drummond . McNeile went on to write ten Drummond novels , four short stories , four stage plays and a screenplay before his death in 1937 . The stories were continued by his friend Gerard Fairlie between 1938 and 1954 ; further books were published in the 1960s and one in 1983 . 
 Drummond is a First World War veteran , brutalised by his experiences in the trenches and bored with his post @-@ war lifestyle . He publishes an advertisement looking for adventure , and soon finds himself embroiled in a series of exploits , many of which involve Carl Peterson — who becomes his nemesis — and Peterson 's mistress , the femme fatale Irma . After his first adventure Drummond marries his client , Phyllis Benton ; in later episodes she becomes involved in Drummond 's exploits , often as the victim of kidnapping by Drummond 's enemies . 
 In 1921 an adaptation of the first novel was staged in London , with Gerald du Maurier playing the role of Drummond ; the play was further adapted and resulted in the 1922 silent film Bulldog Drummond , with Carlyle Blackwell in the lead role . Several other Drummond films have followed , either based on McNeile 's stories or with unique storylines . 
 = = Drummond = = 
 The Bulldog Drummond stories of H. C. McNeile follow Captain Hugh " Bulldog " Drummond , DSO , MC . Drummond is a member of " the Breed " , a class of Englishman who were patriotic , loyal and " physically and morally intrepid " . Drummond is a wealthy gentleman , formerly an officer in the fictional " Royal <unk> Regiment " , who , after the First World War , spends his new @-@ found leisure time looking for adventure . McNeile first wrote the Drummond character as a detective for a short story in The Strand Magazine , but the portrayal was not successful and was changed for the novel Bull @-@ dog Drummond , which was a thriller . The character was an amalgam of McNeile 's friend Gerard Fairlie , and his idea of an English gentleman , although writer J.D. Bourn disputes Fairlie 's claim to be a model for the character , noting that " he was still at school when Sapper created his ... hero " . Drummond also had roots in the literary characters Sherlock Holmes , Sexton Blake , Richard Hannay and The Scarlet Pimpernel . 
 Drummond 's wartime experience had given him a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter : stealth — " he could move over ground without a single blade of grass rustling " — and the ability to incapacitate others — " he could kill a man with his bare hands in a second " . During his time on the Western Front he would take himself on solitary raids through no man 's land . Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing , was a crack shot , played cricket for the Free Foresters , and was an excellent poker player . In addition to Drummond 's physical attributes is his common sense , which allows him to equal and beat his opponents , even if they have a superior intellect . 
 Drummond is characterised as large , very strong , physically unattractive and an " apparently brainless hunk of a man " , He is six feet tall , weighs around 14 stone , and has a " cheerful type of ugliness which inspires immediate confidence in its owner " . Throughout his exploits , Drummond is joined by several of his ex @-@ army friends and colleagues , including Algy Longworth ( who would appear in many of the films , as Drummond 's sidekick ) , MC ; Toby Sinclair , VC ; Peter Darrell and Ted Jerningham . Dummond 's ex @-@ batman from his military days , James Denny , runs Drummond 's flat on Half @-@ Moon Street in Mayfair , London , along with Mrs Denny . ( Denny appeared as Drummond 's sidekick in the radio series , a version of the character named <unk> appeared in the films ) Drummond is a gentleman with a private income ; he is also be construed as " a brutalized ex @-@ officer whose thirst for excitement is also an attempt to reenact [ sic ] the war " , although the character was later described by Cecil Day @-@ Lewis as an " unspeakable public school bully " . 
 The novel Bulldog Drummond begins when Drummond places an advertisement in a newspaper looking for adventure to lift the ennui of his life in post @-@ war London . The response comes from Phyllis Benton , who is concerned for the health and well @-@ being of her father , over whom Henry <unk> and Carl Peterson have a hold . At the end of the novel Drummond and Phyllis marry , and remain married throughout the course of the McNeile and Fairlie series of books , in contrast to the films , which generally portray Drummond as unmarried . Phyllis becomes integral to the plot of some of the novels : she is kidnapped by Irma Peterson in several stories , including The Black Gang and The Female of the Species . 
 In the matter of his personal tastes , Drummond is a member of the fictional Junior Sports Club , a gentleman 's club on St. James 's Square , London . His preferred drink is beer although he also enjoys drinking martinis and is knowledgeable about wines . Drummond owns both a Rolls @-@ Royce and a Bentley . 
 Although Drummond 's actions are intended to maintain the conservative status quo of Britain , academic Hans Bertens considers that instead , he comes across as " a murderous exponent of a fierce competitive individualism " . 
 = = Carl and Irma Peterson = = 
 The first four books deal with Drummond against Carl Peterson , who becomes Drummond 's arch @-@ enemy . Peterson is also a master of disguise and uses several aliases . Peterson is killed in the fourth book , The Final Count , although Fairlie brings him back for his final novel , The Return of the Black Gang . Drummond forms a grudging respect for Peterson , and offers an honourable duel to the death at the end of The Third Round , instead of the usual summary justice that normally befalls members of Peterson 's gang . The writer Richard Usborne sees Peterson as " quite a sympathetic character . Almost , in fact , a hero " , and wrote that " authors ... fall in love with their big villains ... Sapper came to love Carl Peterson dearly , and so did Drummond " . 
 The title of the fifth Bulldog Dummond book , The Female of the Species refers to Rudyard Kipling 's line " the female of the species is more deadly than the male " . Irma is described by Jonathon Green as " the slinky epitome of a twenties ' vamp ' " , and by Lawrence Treadwell as dark , sexy and from an oriental background , " a true femme fatale " . After Carl Peterson 's death in The Final Count , Irma swears revenge on Drummond and kidnaps his wife — whom he had met in Bulldog Drummond — with the intent of killing him in the ensuing chase . Irma Peterson appears in six of McNeile 's books , and in a further five by Fairlie .

 The Drummond series proved popular with contemporary audiences , with Bulldog Drummond selling 396 @,@ 302 copies between 1920 and 1939 , exceeding the 100 @,@ 000 @-@ copy benchmark for " best @-@ sellers " . At his peak in the 1920s , McNeile was the highest @-@ paid short story writer in the world , and it was estimated that in the last five years of his life he was earning around £ 10 @,@ 000 a year ; the Daily Mirror estimated that during his writing career he had earned £ 85 @,@ 000 . 
 When reviewing Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back for The New York Times , the critic observed that " if you like a good knock @-@ down @-@ and @-@ drag @-@ out yarn with excitement and violence on nearly every page , you can 't go wrong on Bulldog Drummond " ; for the novel Bulldog Drummond at Bay , the reviewer considered that " as a piece of fictional melodrama , the book is first rate " . In the British market , The Times Literary Supplement also characterised McNeile as a mass @-@ market thriller writer , which contrasted with its consideration of his earlier works . 
 Throughout the Drummond stories , much of the language used by McNeile relating to ethnic minorities or Jews is considered by the academic Joan DelFattore to be " intensely conservative by modern standards " ; Green observes that while the characters of other contemporary writers , such as Agatha Christie , " exhibit the inevitable xenophobia and anti @-@ semitism of the period , McNeile 's go far beyond the ' polite ' norms " . J.D. Bourn considers his language to be " rather distasteful " , while the academic Michael Denning observed that " Drummond is a bundle of <unk> , hating Jews , Germans , and most other foreigners " . The academic Ion Trewin comments that for the readers of the 1920s and ' 30s , McNeile was seen at the time as " simply an upstanding Tory who spoke for many of his countrymen " .

 Drummond later became a model for other literary characters created in the 1940s and ' 50s : W. E. Johns used McNeile 's work as a model for his character Biggles , while Ian Fleming stated that James Bond was " Sapper from the waist up and Mickey Spillane below " .

The first castle in Lydford , sometimes termed the Norman fort , was a small ringwork built in a corner of the Anglo @-@ Saxon fortified burh in the years after the Norman conquest of England . It was intended to help control Devon following the widespread revolt against Norman rule in 1068 . The Norman fort was abandoned by the middle of the 12th century . 
 The second castle in Lydford was constructed in 1195 following a wave of law and order problems across England . It included a stone tower with a surrounding bailey , and rapidly became used as a prison and court to administer the laws in the Forest of Dartmoor and the Devon stannaries . The tower was rebuilt in the middle of the 13th century , probably in the 1260s by Richard , the Earl of Cornwall . It was redesigned to resemble a motte and bailey castle , an antiquated design for the period but one that was heavily symbolic of authority and power . In 1342 the castle , still being used as a prison and courtroom , passed to the Duchy of Cornwall , who owned it until the 20th century . 
 The condition of the castle varied considerably over time , and was repeatedly renovated and then left to deteriorate once again . Nonetheless , other than a period during the English Civil War and the Restoration in the 17th century , Lydford Castle played an important part in stannary and forest administration until the 19th century . The castle acquired a bad reputation for injustice in the 14th century , and complaints about " Lydford Law " persisted for centuries . In the early 19th century , however , Dartmoor Prison was constructed , and Lydford ceased to be the centre for legal administration . The castle fell into ruin by the middle of the century . 
 In 1932 , Lydford Castle passed into the hands of the state , and in the 21st century is run by English Heritage as a tourist attraction . Historian Andrew Saunders has described the castle as architecturally significant , being " the earliest example of a purpose @-@ built gaol " in England . The earthworks of the Norman fort are owned by the National Trust and are also open to the public .

 The first castle at Lydford was built in the aftermath of the Norman conquest of England in 1066 . In 1068 William the Conqueror intervened in South @-@ West England to put down widespread Anglo @-@ Saxon revolts against Norman rule and set about pacifying the region . William had been responsible for building urban castles across England in the former centres of Anglo @-@ Saxon power and in Devon he constructed new urban castles at Exeter , Totnes , possibly Barnstaple and in the town of Lydford . 
 Lydford , then called <unk> , was a type of fortified Anglo @-@ Saxon town called a burh . The castle , in the 21st century called the " Norman fort " , was built on the isolated south @-@ west corner of the burh , soon after 1068 . It had a ringwork design and was only 55 metres ( 180 ft ) by 60 metres ( 200 ft ) in size , protected in part by the existing defences of the burh . A similar pattern of castle building within existing Anglo @-@ Saxon burhs can be seen at Wallingford and Bedford castles . Most of the interior of the castle was used to store grain in large timber and earth buildings . It is uncertain whether these storage facilities were intended for supplying Norman troops or storing grain for wider economic purposes . 
 This first castle was used only briefly and seems to have been abandoned by the middle of the 12th century . The grain stores were destroyed by fire , but the reason for this is uncertain . By this period , the town of Lydford as a whole was also in serious economic decline .

 In the late 12th century Richard I 's government attempted to promote the growth of Lydford , including revitalising trade in the town . Then , in 1195 , there were widespread problems with law and order across England , including the South @-@ West , and on the basis of this Richard 's government decided to build a fortification for holding royal prisoners in Lydford , further along the west side of the town from the old castle , in a prestigious location next to the town 's church . This fortification is referred to in contemporary documents variously as a <unk> domus and <unk> de <unk> , a " strong house " and " Lydford Castle " respectively . 
 It is unclear why the decision was taken to build the new castle in a different location within the town . Lydford 's case is not unique , as a similar shift occurred at Canterbury and Gloucester ; generally , such changes in castle location are associated with the destruction of the older defence or changes in political leadership . Archaeologist Andrew Saunders suggests that the new site was chosen because the earlier castle at Lydford was not owned by the Crown in 1195 and was , in any case , in disrepair . £ 74 was spent on the construction of the castle , paid for by Crown revenues from both Devon and Cornwall . 
 The castle took the form of a stone tower with a surrounding bailey . The bailey was rectangular and in the 21st century measures 180 feet ( 55 m ) by 130 feet ( 40 m ) . The bailey was protected by ramparts and deep ditches on the south @-@ west and north @-@ east sides , with the north @-@ west side protected by the ramparts and valley of the original burh fortifications . The south @-@ east side of the bailey probably formed a small courtyard in front of the tower , in a space now occupied by part of the 13th century earthworks , and was probably the entrance to the original castle . 
 The tower was a square , free @-@ standing building , 52 feet ( 16 m ) by 52 feet ( 16 m ) and at least two storeys tall ; in the 12th century the tower sat on flat ground with no mound around it . The walls were roughly built from slate and granite , up to 11 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) thick , and pierced by arrow slits . The tower had a spine wall along the middle of the building , dividing each floor into two rooms . The entrance was probably on the first floor of the building . An internal water supply was installed , of which a decorated spout still survives . 
 = = = = Role in stannary and forest law = = = = 
 Lydford Castle does not seem to be primarily designed to have a military function , although in 1199 when King John succeeded to the throne he had the castle garrisoned and expensively equipped to prevent any potential unrest breaking out in the region . The castle lacked the usual military features of the time , such as external gatehouses , and its design seems to have been intended to evoke the authority of a traditional defensive fortification rather than to resist an actual attack . Instead , as well as helping to deal with the wider problems in 1195 , the castle appears to have been built with the intention of enforcing the stannary and forest law in Devon . It is possible that the Crown originally intended that the castle took over the stannary law across the whole of Cornwall and Devon , although in practice its role only extended only to governing the Devon stannaries . 
 Stannary law was a medieval English legal system for governing the tin industry . South @-@ West England , and in particular Devon , was a major producer of tin in the 12th century , produced by independent miners who worked the alluvial deposits across the region . The industry was regulated by the Crown , who taxed mining output and raised revenue from any fines imposed on those who broke the stannary laws . The laws also helped to manage the relationship between the miners and other local people , whose economic interests were often at odds . The output of tin increased from the end of the 12th century onwards , encouraging the Crown to extend its regulation and generate more revenue . In 1198 , William of Wrotham , who controlled Lydford Castle at the start of John 's reign , was appointed as the Warden of the Stannaries , a new office intended to provide additional rigour to the administration of the mining industry . Stannary courts were established in Devon , backed by a team of officials , and , with the creation of the Duchy of Cornwall in the 14th century , the administration of stannary law was delegated to the duchy . From 1198 onwards , Lydford Castle was designated as the prison for supporting the court and its processes . 
 Forests were special areas of land in medieval England , owned by the Crown and subject to forest law . They were often selected because of their natural resources , and were expected to provide the Crown with a flow of money or raw materials . In 1195 , the Forest of Dartmoor extended across all of Devon , but in 1204 John curtailed the extent of the royal forest , removing much of Devon from Forest Law and leaving the area known in the modern period as Dartmoor . This reduced forest was still subject to the Forest Laws , involving a specialised group of legal officials who met at Lydford Castle to impose fines and other punishments . Probably both Lydford Castle and the forest was given to the Sheriff of Devon , William Brewer , in 1216 . The arrangement changed under Henry III , when the estates were given to Richard , the Earl of Cornwall in 1239 . Legally , this meant that the Forest of Dartmoor was converted to a chase , although the Earls of Cornwall continued to hold law courts at Lydford Castle , enforcing chase laws that closely resembled the former Forest Laws .

 Richard , Edward II 's second son , took possession of Lydford Castle in 1239 as the Earl of Cornwall . Richard took a close interest in developing the town of Lydford , creating an additional market and introducing a new fair in the 1260s . Around this time , the main tower at Lydford Castle was demolished and rebuilt , probably by Richard , possibly following a serious fire in the building . Richard was a wealthy politician and rebuilding the castle in this way would have provided him with an important status symbol in the region . 
 The previous tower was stripped back , the existing walls levelled off around 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) from the ground and the ground floor arrow slits filled in . Two more storeys were then built on top of the older walls , better executed with a higher proportion of granite stone and thinner , typically around 6 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) thick . Although the structure remained essentially the same , the new tower was slightly smaller , measuring around 48 feet ( 15 m ) by 47 feet ( 14 m ) . The first floor was only basically designed , with a sequence of rooms of different levels of comfort , and intended to function as the prison , and the second floor was better finished , with a hall and a chamber , and probably operated as the courtroom and provided accommodation for the keeper of the castle . 
 As part of the work , an earth mound , or motte , 17 @-@ foot ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) high , was piled up around the base of the tower . The original ground floor of the castle was now an underground cellar , probably used as a <unk> , or pit , for detaining low status prisoners and reached by ladder from the first floor . Some infilling of the ground floor occurred in order to equalise the pressure on the walls from the mound . It is uncertain how many other towers or keeps have similar mounds , as excavation is usually required before the foundations can be examined , but Totnes and Farnham castles are known to have mottes build against the walls of the keep . The reason for building the mound is uncertain , but it was almost certainly not designed as a serious defensive feature . It was instead probably intended as to superficially imitate older motte and bailey designs , with the completed castle echoing these former symbols of power and reinforcing the current political status of its owner .

 Richard 's son , Edmund took over the earldom in 1278 but had little interest in Lydford , preferring Restormel and Lostwithiel ; by his death in 1299 the castle had been left to decay and was in ruins . It reverted to the Crown , and when Edward II made his royal favourite , Piers Gaveston , the Earl of Cornwall in 1307 , Lydford Castle was passed to him . The castle was repaired at the start of the century and was in use once again as a prison . Edward II and Gaveston fell from power in 1327 and Thomas le <unk> was temporarily entrusted with the castle and Dartmoor by the new regime . In 1329 the castle was valued at a little over £ 11 . Piers Gaveston 's widow , Margaret de Clare , leased the property to Tavistock Abbey , and it continued to operate as a prison . 
 Edward , the Black Prince became Duke of Cornwall in 1337 and he acquired Lydford Castle on Margaret 's death in 1342 . Extensive repairs took place over the next three years , and the castle was considered to be well roofed and decorated inside . Over the next two centuries the condition of the castle fluctuated . Around 1390 the castle roof was stripped for its lead , to be used on castles in Cornwall . The castle well was possibly dug during the 15th century . After 1425 , the Crown let it to a range of individuals , including Sir Walter Hungerford and Sir Philip Courteney . 
 Lydford remained the centre of the forest administration through the 14th and 15th centuries . Despite complaints from non @-@ miners at the start of the 14th century that the prison regime at Lydford Castle was overly lax , by the end of the century the prison had a reputation for poor , grim conditions . The first known rhymes complaining about " Lydford Law " date from 1399 , and continued to be popular for several centuries . In 1510 , Richard Strode , a Member of Parliament campaigning for reform of the Stannary laws , was infamously arrested by Stannary officials and imprisoned in Lydford Castle . He later described how he was kept in an underground room in the keep , fed only bread and water , and encumbered with <unk> until he paid the keeper to release him from the irons . 
 After 1485 , the Duchy took the castle back into direct control , and by 1546 it was in poor repair . Renovation work was carried out under Elizabeth I , but a report of 1618 suggested that the castle was unable to function as a prison because of its poor condition , and fresh repair work was carried out in the 1620s and 1630s under Charles I.

 Lydford Castle was involved in the English Civil War that broke out in 1642 between the Royalist supporters of Charles I and Parliament . The castle was used by the Royalist commander Sir Richard Grenville as his main military prison in the region . It had a terrible reputation amongst Parliamentarians , who complained that it was used to summarily execute military prisoners and to extort money from innocent civilians , on fear of imprisonment . At the end of the civil war , the Lydford estate appears to have been sold off by Parliament The castle was assessed by their surveyors to be " almost totally ruined " in 1650 : the roof of the tower was still mostly intact , but the floors and their beams were collapsing , and the whole site , including the bailey , was only worth around £ 80 . 
 With the Restoration of Charles II to the throne in 1660 the castle and the forest were taken back to the ownership of the Duchy . Sir John Granville was made the Rider and Master Forester of Dartmoor and the Lydford Castle courts continued to be held to regulate the Forest . Repairs to the dilapidated building do not appear to have been carried out , however , and in 1704 a report was drawn up for the government , noting that the Stannary laws could not be enforced without a working prison . 
 Work was carried out between 1616 and 1733 , bringing the castle back into good order . As part of this , the spine wall was rebuilt properly , and the second floor windows enlarged . The courtroom featured a chair for the Stannary court judge , additional seating for the court officials and a railed , public section around the outside of the room . The courtroom also doubled as a hall for village dances and feasts . At the start of the 19th century , however , Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt , the Lord Warden of the Stannaries , began the construction of Dartmoor Prison at Princetown . Dartmoor Prison and Princetown grew increasingly important and courts began to be held there instead of Lydford Castle . 
 The castle declined once again , the courtroom became unsafe to use and by 1833 , the remaining judicial fittings had been stripped out . In the middle of the 19th century the Duchy of Cornwall rejected proposals to repair the castle in order to bring it back into service as being too expensive , but the castle site was enclosed to prevent injuries to children who might be tempted to play on the stonework . By the 1870s , the town of Lydford was vastly reduced in importance from the medieval period and the castle 's roofs and floors had either collapsed or been removed .

 The Duchy of Cornwall continued to own Lydford Castle into the 20th century . Albert Richardson , the architect to the Duchy estate , proposed converting the property into a private house in 1912 , but the duchy turned down the project . In 1932 the Duchy gave the castle to the Office of Works . Repairs were carried out in the 1930s and the 1950s , and archaeological investigations were undertaken in the 1960s . In the 21st century , the castle is controlled by English Heritage and operated as a tourist attraction . Historian Andrew Saunders has described the castle as architecturally significant , being " the earliest example of a purpose @-@ built gaol " in England . The earthworks of the Norman fort are owned by the National Trust and are also open to the public . Both castle sites are protected under law as ancient monuments . 
 = Typhoon Cimaron ( 2006 ) = 
 Typhoon Cimaron , known in the Philippines as Typhoon <unk> , was the most intense tropical cyclone to strike the Philippine island of Luzon since Typhoon Zeb in 1998 . Originating from a tropical depression on October 25 , Cimaron developed within an environment strongly favoring tropical cyclogenesis east of the Philippines . On October 28 , the system underwent rapid intensification , culminating in attaining its peak strength with winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . Estimates from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ranked the system as a Category 5 @-@ equivalent super typhoon with one @-@ minute sustained winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) , though this is argued to have underrepresented the typhoon 's strength . The system moved ashore near Casiguran , Aurora in northern Luzon at peak strength . Crossing the island , Cimaron emerged over the South China Sea where conditions allowed for temporary reorganization . After becoming nearly stationary on November 1 , the typhoon executed a tight anti @-@ cyclonic loop and rapidly weakened . The storm degraded to a tropical depression on November 4 before dissipating three days later off the coast of Vietnam . 
 Prior to impacting the Philippines , Public Storm Warning Signals # 3 and # 4 , the two highest levels , were raised for several provinces in Luzon . Thousands of residents were urged to evacuate while local authorities prepared services for quick recovery efforts . With Cimaron initially expected to strike Vietnam , officials planned to evacuate 218 @,@ 000 people ; however , Cimaron 's slow motion and demise over open waters resulted in these plans being suspended . Officials in Thailand and southern China also advised residents of possible effects from the storm . 
 In contrast to the typhoon 's extreme intensity , damage was somewhat limited in the Philippines due to the lower population density of the affected areas . Widespread flooding and landslides caused substantial disruptions to travel and isolated some communities . Thirty @-@ four people were killed in various incidents , mostly from flooding . Nearly 365 @,@ 000 people were affected by the storm and losses amounted to 1 @.@ 21 billion PHP ( US $ 31 million ) . Winds along the periphery of Cimaron fanned a large wildfire near Hong Kong , and moisture from it fueled record @-@ breaking rains in British Columbia , Canada . Relief efforts in the Philippines began soon after the storm 's passage ; however , two other storms struck the country in November , with one resulting in far greater damage . Following a request for international assistance in early December , more than US $ 10 million was provided in relief aid to the Philippines .

 On October 24 , 2006 , an area of disturbed weather , characterized by flaring convection around a low @-@ level circulation , developed approximately 595 km ( 370 mi ) east of Guam . Situated within a region favoring tropical cyclogenesis , the system consolidated as it tracked generally westward . Late on October 25 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) classified the low as a tropical depression . With poleward outflow improving , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert the following day before initiating advisories on Tropical Depression 22W . Several hours later , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigned the storm the local name <unk> as was within their area of responsibility . Situated south of a strong subtropical ridge , the system maintained a general west @-@ northwest track . On October 27 , the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was assigned the name Cimaron by the JMA . The small storm subsequently underwent a period of rapid intensification as dual outflow channels developed ; the storm reached typhoon status early on October 28 . At the end of this phase on October 29 , Cimaron attained its peak intensity with winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) and a barometric pressure of 920 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 17 inHg ) . 
 The JTWC estimated Cimaron to have been a stronger system , attaining its peak intensity as a Category 5 @-@ equivalent super typhoon with one @-@ minute winds of 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) . However , satellite estimates from forecasters within the agency itself , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's Satellite Analysis Branch ( SAB ) , the Air Force Weather Agency ( AFWA ) , and Dr. Karl Hoarau of Cergy @-@ Pontoise University stated Cimaron to have been an even stronger system . Using the Dvorak technique – a method of determining a tropical cyclone 's intensity based on satellite appearance – AFWA and SAB yielded a peak value of <unk> , 285 km / h ( 180 mph ) , while advanced operational values from the JTWC peaked at <unk> , 305 km / h ( 190 mph ) . Additionally , a forecaster at SAB noted that the lower estimates were likely due to restrictions on the Dvorak technique stemming from Cimaron 's rapid intensification . The forecaster also noted that a second type of estimate gave a maximum value of T8.0 , 315 km / h ( 195 mph ) , the highest rating on the scale . 
 While at its peak strength , Cimaron displayed two small concentric eyewalls , separated by a few kilometres . The storm later made landfall near Casiguran , Aurora in northern Luzon shortly after 1200 UTC on October 29 ; it became one of the strongest storms to ever hit the region . Interaction with the island 's mountainous terrain caused substantial weakening , though Cimaron maintained typhoon status during its 12 ‑ hour crossing . After emerging over the South China Sea on October 30 , the system initially maintained its west @-@ northwest course . However , the following day , a weakness developed within the ridge previously steering the typhoon , and Cimaron briefly turned north before essentially stalling . During this time , the system reorganized somewhat and reached a secondary peak intensity with winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) on November 2 . While executing a tight clockwise loop , increased wind shear and entrainment of dry air soon caused Cimaron to dramatically weaken . With a new ridge becoming established over China , the weakening system acquired a general southwestward track . Cimaron weakened to a tropical depression on November 4 and ultimately dissipated three days later just off the coast of southeastern Vietnam .

 By October 28 , Isabela , southern Cagayan , Quirino , and northern Aurora provinces were placed under Public Storm Warning Signal ( PSWS ) # 3 , the second @-@ highest level . More than 20 provinces overall were placed under varying PSWS levels . Residents living along the coast were urged to evacuate . Early on October 29 , several provinces along Luzon 's east coast were placed under PSWS # 4 , the highest level of alert . During a national radio broadcast President Gloria Macapagal @-@ Arroyo urged residents to heed warnings and not to venture out during the storm . Throughout Luzon , schools and government offices were closed on October 29 while residents in mountainous areas were urged to evacuate due to threat of mudslides . The National Transmission Corporation deployed power restoration crews across the region to allow for quick post @-@ storm response . Hospitals in Cimaron 's projected path requested employees to be present in anticipation of an influx of patients . Quick response teams from the Department of Social Welfare and Development were placed on standby for possible deployment . Within evacuation areas , the Philippine National Police was dispatched to prevent people from returning to these areas . Bus companies suspended all services north of Tarlac City and San Jose . 
 As Cimaron emerged over the South China Sea , officials in Vietnam began preparing for possible effects from the storm . Authorities began evacuating residents in flood @-@ prone areas along the coast from Quảng Bình Khánh Hòa , including 12 @,@ 500 in Thừa Thiên – Huế Province . Fishermen were urged to seek shelter at nearby ports until the storm subsided . The Vietnamese Government also requested the deployment of the nation 's Army , Coast Guard , and Navy to assist in evacuation efforts . Residents still recovering from Typhoon Xangsane in early October were forced to secure their homes and evacuate once again . An estimated 218 @,@ 000 people were planned to be relocated across Vietnam : 68 @,@ 000 in Quảng Nam , 60 @,@ 000 in Quảng Trị , 50 @,@ 000 in Thừa Thiên – Huế , and 40 @,@ 000 in Quảng Bình . Appeals were made to roughly 3 @,@ 500 vessels , with a collective crew count of 32 @,@ 285 , to return to port . The Navy deployed 42 ships for possible search and rescue missions . Following Cimaron 's change in course and cessation of movement , the Vietnamese Government suspended all evacuation plans on November 2 ; however , fishermen were urged to remain at port in fears of repeating the incidents during Typhoon Chanchu in May of that year where over 200 fishermen lost their lives . 
 Officials in Thailand also monitored the storm as a potential flood threat . Many reservoirs in the nation were above 80 percent capacity and further heavy rains would lead to a major flood event ; the main concerns were for the Bhumibol and Sirikit dams in Tak and <unk> provinces , respectively . Authorities in Hainan province , China , warned of possible effects from the storm as well beginning on October 31 . Heavy squalls , with winds of 50 to 100 km / h ( 31 to 62 mph ) were forecast for eastern areas of the island and areas offshore . By November 1 , approximately 20 @,@ 000 fishing vessels returned to port as conditions over the South China Sea deteriorated ; shipping over the Qiongzhou Strait remained unaffected .

 Typhoon Cimaron struck the Philippines with winds estimated at 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) and gusts in excess of 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) . Along coastal Aurora Province , a mother and daughter were killed when strong winds destroyed their home . Numerous trees and power lines were felled by the winds as well , causing widespread blackouts in Luzon . The majority of Aurora and Isabela provinces were left without power and telecommunications for more than two weeks . Approximately 90 percent of the homes in <unk> were damaged . Heavy rains across the region swelled many rivers , flooding low @-@ lying areas along their banks . Several bridges became impassable and officials had to release water from two major dams to prevent them from overflowing . The most significant flooding occurred along the Allied @-@ <unk> and <unk> rivers in Pangasinan . Low @-@ lying areas along the Cagayan , Chico , <unk> , <unk> , Tuguegarao Pared rivers throughout Cagayan province were also affected by flooding . Numerous roads were blocked off by landslides or washed away by flooding , severely limiting travel . A landslide temporarily isolated four barangays in Nueva Vizcaya . A Provincial Disaster Coordinating Council search and rescue team was later deployed to <unk> where at least four people were killed by flooding . Fatal landslides took place in Benguet and Kalinga provinces . A traffic accident blamed on the storm in La Union resulted in one death and seven injuries . 
 Throughout the Philippines , damage amounted to roughly 1 @.@ 21 billion PHP ( US $ 31 million ) , of which 664 million PHP ( US $ 17 million ) was attributed to agriculture . Approximately eight percent of the corn and rice harvest was destroyed . A total of 2 @,@ 605 homes were destroyed while another 18 @,@ 181 were damaged . Across seven provinces , 364 @,@ 733 people were affected by the typhoon , 65 @,@ 585 of whom were significantly impacted . A total of 34 people lost their lives as a result of Cimaron . Additionally , 65 people sustained injuries .

 Though the storm remained over open waters after moving over the South China Sea , strong winds stemming from it fanned a large wildfire in Tai Lam Country Park , Hong Kong . At least 136 fires ignited on October 30 during the Chung Yeung Festival . The Tai Lam fire grew to be the largest in over a decade , ultimately charring 450 hectares ( 1 @,@ 112 acres ) and 66 @,@ 000 trees . The storm 's winds coupled with seasonally low humidity made conditions difficult for firefighters trying to suppress the fire . Over the South China Sea , the 128 m ( 420 ft ) long Chinese cargo ship , <unk> 998 , became stranded amid 5 m ( 16 ft ) swells and 75 to 88 km / h ( 47 to 55 mph ) winds after its engine failed . All 18 crewmen were unharmed after the vessel was towed to port in Zhuhai by the rescue ship <unk> . 
 Moisture from the typhoon also fed an extratropical cyclone , in a process referred to as the Pineapple Express , that brought heavy rains to southern British Columbia , Canada , prompting flood watches for the region Southern areas of the province were deluged by the storm , with some areas receiving 250 to 300 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 to 11 @.@ 8 in ) of rain . The daily rainfall record for November 6 of 20 @.@ 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 81 in ) at Victoria International Airport was shattered with 50 @.@ 4 mm ( 1 @.@ 98 in ) falling . Widespread flooding occurred as rivers over @-@ topped their banks ; hundreds of homes were inundated , prompting numerous evacuations . The Vedder River reached a 25 @-@ year high and forced the evacuation 200 residences .

 Damage assessments in the Philippines began on October 31 , with aerial surveys being utilized for isolated areas . With numerous roads blocked off or washed away , clearing operations were a priority . The Philippine Red Cross assisted in the immediate aftermath of Typhoon Cimaron , evacuating people in La Union and providing relief goods to more than 16 @,@ 000 people in Aurora . The majority of relief work was handled by local governments , though some assistance from the National Disaster Coordinating Council was received . By November 1 , the estimated cost of humanitarian assistance reached 3 @.@ 2 million PHP ( US $ 81 @,@ 000 ) . Teams from the Red Cross were already deployed in the Philippines due to Typhoon Xangsane in September and were able to quickly respond in Cimaron 's aftermath . Relief efforts for Cimaron were cut short as just two weeks later , Typhoon <unk> struck nearly the same areas . A weaker , though still powerful typhoon , damage from <unk> was relatively limited . 
 In late November , Typhoon Durian brought even greater devastation to the Philippines and prompted greater need for international assistance . On December 11 , President Arroyo declared a national state of calamity and released 1 billion PHP ( US $ 25 @.@ 6 million ) in relief and rehabilitation funds . Throughout 2006 as a whole , the Philippines was devastated by multiple natural disasters that collectively killed well over 1 @,@ 000 people and left more than US $ 1 @.@ 6 billion in damage . Consequently , the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs appealed for emergency assistance to the nation , in the form of US $ 46 million in funds for the most severely affected areas . The European Commission Humanitarian Aid department also provided € 2 million ( US $ 1 @.@ 9 million ) in emergency funds in relation to the four major typhoons that struck the country , with a focus on areas affected by Typhoon Durian . The Red Cross ultimately provided US $ 9 @.@ 67 million in assistance to the nation in relation to the four typhoons as well as Typhoon Fengshen in June 2008 which struck while relief efforts from the 2006 storms were still ongoing .

 The Big Inch and Little Big Inch , collectively known as the Inch pipelines , are petroleum pipelines extending from Texas to New Jersey , built between 1942 and 1944 as emergency war measures in the U.S. Before World War II , petroleum products were transported from the oil fields of Texas to the north @-@ eastern states by oil tanker . After the United States entered the war on 1 January 1942 , this vital link was attacked by German submarines in the Operation <unk> , threatening both the oil supplies to the north @-@ east and its onward transshipment to Great Britain . The Secretary of the Interior , Harold Ickes , championed the pipeline project as a way of transporting petroleum by the more @-@ secure , interior route . 
 The pipelines were government financed and owned , but were built and operated by the War Emergency Pipelines company , a non @-@ profit corporation backed by a consortium of the largest American oil companies . It was the longest , biggest and heaviest project of its type then undertaken ; the Big and Little Big Inch pipelines were 1 @,@ 254 and 1 @,@ 475 miles long ( 2 @,@ 018 km and 2 @,@ 374 km ) respectively , with 35 pumping stations along their routes . The project required 16 @,@ 000 people and 725 @,@ 000 short tons ( 658 @,@ 000 t ) of materials . It was praised as an example of private @-@ public sector cooperation and featured extensively in US government propaganda . 
 After the end of the war there were extended arguments over how the pipelines should be used . In 1947 , the Texas East Transmission Corporation purchased the pipelines for $ 143 @,@ 127 @,@ 000 , the largest post @-@ war disposal of war @-@ surplus property . The corporation converted them to transport natural gas , transforming the energy market in the north @-@ east . The Little Big Inch was returned to carry oil in 1957 . The pipelines are owned by Spectra Energy Partners and Enterprise Products and remain in use . 
 = = Background = = 
 By the time that the United States entered World War II in 1941 , oil was a vital part of military operations around the world . The United States produced 60 percent of the world 's crude oil , with the state of Texas in the south @-@ west leading this production , producing more than twice as much crude as any other state . The industry comprised a handful of very large producers and more than 3 @,@ 500 smaller operators . 
 The north @-@ east coast of the United States depended on these supplies of oil , importing both crude and refined products . Across most of Texas , there had been little interest in building pipelines to transport oil , and petroleum was typically moved from the south @-@ west to the north @-@ east coast using a mixture of sea freight and railroad transport . In early 1941 , 70 @,@ 000 barrels of oil were moved on the railroads each day , but this method was expensive , and the bulk of the oil was moved using barges , some with a capacity of up to 15 @,@ 000 barrels , operating up and down the rivers and the Atlantic Coast . 
 With the outbreak of war , the eastern sea routes of the country were attacked by German U @-@ boat submarines . United States naval defence was very limited and largely obsolete ; between January and April 1942 , among other naval losses , 46 oil tankers were sunk and 16 damaged . The problem was made worse as 50 tankers had been sent to help the UK earlier in 1941 . Insurers began to refuse to underwrite the remaining vessels and the volume of crude oil reaching the north @-@ east from the Texas Gulf dropped . 
 In response , steps were taken to better protect the tankers from attack , but losses continued to mount until , in April 1942 , they were banned by the Navy from operating the north @-@ east sea routes . The government and industry took steps to maximise the use of the railroads , increasing the amount of oil carried on them more than ten @-@ fold , but there were shortages of rail tank cars , and the existing fleet of cars was in poor condition . Instead , the United States government began to examine options for the use of pipelines to fulfil the demand for petroleum in the north @-@ east . 
 = = Concept = = 
 Transporting petroleum by pipeline from the south @-@ west to the north @-@ east was a potentially attractive option for the government as it would be safe from submarine attack and could operate efficiently regardless of the weather . Pipelines had been in use in the industry since 1862 , but by the 1930s they were usually only 8 inches ( 200 mm ) wide , able to deliver 20 @,@ 000 barrels of oil a day ; larger pipes could be built , but due to structural weaknesses they could not operate at the regular pressures . Technologies to build high @-@ pressure pipes at sizes larger than 12 inches ( 300 mm ) began to emerge during the decade before the war , but their adoption was not commercially viable . 
 The concept of constructing such a pipeline was first proposed in 1940 by the Secretary of the Interior , Harold Ickes , who argued that " the building of a crude oil pipeline from Texas to the East might not be economically sound ; but that in the event of an emergency it might be absolutely necessary " . A consortium led by Standard Oil put forward a bid to build one in spring 1941 , but the plan failed , due to concerns over the amount of steel that would be required for such a project . In May 1941 , Ickes was appointed as the Petroleum Coordinator for National Defense , and in December 1942 became the administrator of the Petroleum Administration for War . New laws were passed to enable the building of pipelines necessary for the war effort , including the compulsory purchasing of land under the right of eminent domain . 
 Initial planning for the Inch pipelines began on May 15 , 1941 , when a meeting of Ickes and the oil industry commissioned an aerial survey of the possible route . A preliminary design was ready that September , and a consortium of major oil companies formed a new company , National Defense Pipelines , to build a pipeline along the route . The government Supply Priorities and Allocation Board , however , refused to approve the necessary steel , and the consortium 's plan was dissolved shortly before the outbreak of war . After the outbreak of fighting , and the consequent deterioration of the sea routes for transporting oil , industry representatives met in March 1942 to produce a new pipeline strategy , called the Tulsa Plan . This included the construction of the Inch pipelines , backed by the slogan " longlines are lifelines " , for which the steel was finally approved by the War Production Board on June 10 . 
 Once steel supplies had been agreed , an initial tranche of $ 35 million in funding was provided by the government Reconstruction Finance Corporation , which owned and manage the operation of the pipelines through its subsidiary organizations , the Defense Plants and the Defense Supplies corporations . In turn , the actual construction and operation of the pipelines would be carried out by the War Emergency Pipelines company ( WEP ) , a non @-@ profit corporation backed by a consortium of the largest oil companies in the United States : Atlantic Refining , Cities Service Oil , Consolidated Oil , Gulf Oil , Pan American Petroleum and Transportation , Standard Oil , Tidewater Associated Oil , Shell Oil , <unk> @-@ Vacuum Oil , Sun Oil and the Texas Pipe Line Company . The WEP was led by W. Alton Jones and Burt Hull , both with extensive backgrounds in the industry , with Oscar Wolfe as its chief engineer . The company established its offices in Little Rock , Arkansas .

 The Inch pipelines comprised two systems , the Big Inch pipeline and the Little Big Inch pipeline . The Big Inch was a 24 @-@ inch ( 610 mm ) pipeline for crude oil ; it ran from the East Texas Oil Field at Longview , Texas , to Norris City , Illinois , and onto Phoenixville , Pennsylvania , from where it branched into 20 @-@ inch @-@ diameter ( 510 mm ) segments . One served New York and terminated at Linden , New Jersey , and the other served Philadelphia and terminated at Chester Junction , Pennsylvania . The Little Big Inch , a largely parallel 20 @-@ inch @-@ diameter ( 510 mm ) line intended for refined products , ran from Beaumont , Texas , to Little Rock , Arkansas , where it joined the path of the Big Inch , making use of the same pumping stations . From there it ran along the same right @-@ of @-@ way as the Big Inch to New Jersey and Pennsylvania . 
 The pipeline project was the longest , biggest and heaviest of its kind in the world . In total , the Big Inch pipeline was 1 @,@ 254 miles ( 2 @,@ 018 km ) long , with 222 miles ( 357 km ) of secondary distribution and feeder lines , and had 28 pumping stations along the route , approximately every 50 miles ( 80 km ) . The Little Big Inch was 1 @,@ 475 miles ( 2 @,@ 374 km ) long , with 239 miles ( 385 km ) of secondary lines , and had seven unique pumping stations along its southern leg . 
 Charles <unk> of the <unk> directed the engineering project , with much of the work undertaken by Oscar Wolfe and , on the Little Inch pipeline , F. E. Richardson and L. F. Scherer . A meeting of all of the contractors for the build was held at the start of the July to kickstart the project ; overall , 82 different companies would take on the pipeline work on a " cost @-@ plus " basis , employing over 16 @,@ 000 staff . The construction required the government to acquire permission to build the pipeline across 7 @,@ 500 parcels of land ; of these , the right of eminent domain had to be exercised in 300 cases . Major <unk> <unk> , a director in the Petroleum Administration for War , considered the Inch pipelines to be part of “ the most amazing Government @-@ industry cooperation ever achieved ” . 
 The pipelines were soon given the names " Big Inch " and " Little Big Inch " by the construction teams , on account of their unprecedented diameters . The construction project was extensively advertised , as part of the US government 's war @-@ time propaganda effort . Newsreels ran clips such as Pipeline Goes Through ! and Pipe Dream Comes True @-@ Oil ! , and short @-@ films were made about the construction work , including Pipeline . The pipelines also appeared in the RKO Pathé film Oil is Blood . 
 = = = Process = = = 
 The Big Inch pipeline was made from sections of seamless steel pipe up to 44 feet ( 13 m ) long , 3 ⁄ 8 inch ( 9 @.@ 5 mm ) thick and 4 @,@ 200 pounds ( 1 @,@ 900 kg ) in weight . The Little Big Inch used both 5 ⁄ 16 inch ( 7 @.@ 9 mm ) thick seamless steel and electric weld pipe , and a small amount of 1 ⁄ 2 inch ( 13 mm ) thick seamless pipe . In total , 21 @,@ 185 railcar loads of steel piping were laid during the project , the Big Inch alone requiring 360 @,@ 700 short tons ( 327 @,@ 200 t ) of steel . 
 The pipe was laid in trenches 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) deep and 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) wide , dug out by a combination of ditching machines and manual labor . The pipes were then cleaned by pulling a workman through the inside of them with cloths , and welded together , using both the " <unk> " method and the roll @-@ weld , or " firing line " , methods . <unk> was an older method , in which the welder worked his way around two pipes , which remained stationary ; the newer roll @-@ weld approach instead rotated the pipes , allowing the welder to remain in one position as he worked , with up to seven pipes being welded together at the same time . 
 Where it was necessary for the pipeline to curve to fit the route , the steel pipes were bent , using either a cold @-@ bending approach , in which tractors would pull and push the pipelines into position , or a hot @-@ bending method , with the pipe heated up by blow @-@ torches and pulled into place using a jig . A new , specialized piece of equipment for bending pipes , the Cummings bending jig , was invented during the Big Inch build , and used on the construction of the Little Big Inch pipeline . To protect the pipeline from corrosion , its outside was then cleaned by machine , and painted in first a layer of coal tar enamel , and then hot coal tar coating , before being wrapped in asbestos felt . Finally the pipeline was lowered into position , taking care not to damage the ends of the pipes ; the larger pipes were so heavy that they required a D @-@ 8 caterpillar tractor equipped with counter @-@ weights to lift them . The trench was then back @-@ filled , completing the process . 
 The Big Inch pipeline had to pass under 33 rivers and 200 creeks and lakes , as well as under 289 railroad and 626 highway intersections . Specially lined tunnels were bored to lay the pipe under the roads and railroad lines , and specialist trenches dug to lay the pipelines across on the riverbeds and lakes , weighing down the pipeline to stop it floating to the surface . Around 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) of underwater piping was laid in total . In marshy areas , the soft ground was filled in to provide firm foundations for the pipeline to rest on . 
 The pumping stations for the pipelines were built on parcels of land between 11 acres ( 4 @.@ 5 ha ) and 44 acres ( 18 ha ) in size ; those with storage tanks were between 90 acres ( 36 ha ) and 131 acres ( 53 ha ) big . The plain , utilitarian buildings were initially prefabricated steel constructs , but as supplies grew scarce , wood was used instead . As much as 725 @,@ 000 short tons ( 658 @,@ 000 t ) of materials was needed for the total project . 
 = = = Completion = = = 
 Work on the Inch pipelines began immediately after the establishment of the WEP on June 26 , 1942 . They were built in three phases . The first part to be constructed was the Big Inch , its initial leg running to an interim terminal at Norris City , where oil was to be off @-@ loaded to the railroad network . Once this leg was complete , it was extended to its terminus at Phoenixville . When the Big Inch was complete , work began on the third phase of the project , the Little Big Inch . 
 The first purchase order , for 137 @,@ 500 short tons ( 124 @,@ 700 t ) of 24 @-@ inch @-@ diameter pipe , was placed on July 2 , 1942 . To meet a construction deadline of January 1 , 1943 , the laying of pipe began on August 3 , 1942 , near Little Rock . Other pipeline crews began work immediately on segments elsewhere in Arkansas and Texas . By September 10 all eight pipelaying crews , each consisting of between 300 and 400 men , were in the field working . The schedule called for 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) of the Big Inch pipeline to be laid each day . But soon men were laying as much as 9 miles ( 14 km ) a day . In all , roughly 7 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 5 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 m3 ) of material were excavated . Oil began flowing through the Big Inch Line between Texas and Illinois on New Year 's Eve 1942 . Work on the Little Big Inch then began in 1943 . 
 The first crude oil arrived at Phoenixville via the Big Inch on August 14 , 1943 , and the first refined product in the Little Big Inch arrived on March 2 , 1944 . The Big Inch carried up to 334 @,@ 456 barrels of crude oil a day , the Little Big Inch 239 @,@ 844 barrels of gasoline ; the lines were among the largest industrial consumers of electricity in the US , requiring 3 @.@ 89 million kilowatt hours a day to pump the oil along the pipes .

 By the end of the war , there was considerable debate over the future of the pipelines . The major oil companies , such as Standard Oil , campaigned for the conversion of the pipelines for the transfer of natural gas . Demand for natural gas was rising rapidly , and it was produced in large quantities in the Texas oilfields , but could not be got to market in the north @-@ east and was otherwise burnt off uselessly into the atmosphere . The railroad and coal companies , who saw this as likely to introduce additional competition for coal and coal gas , and therefore lower demand for their goods and services , argued against this move . The smaller oil companies proposed continuing to use the pipelines for oil in order to undermine the transport monopolies of the larger corporations . 
 A government inquiry was undertaken to determine the future use of the pipelines , and took evidence from the various stakeholders , most of whom presented the case that favored their companies or industry . The inquiry concluded that the pipelines should be sold for continued use in transporting petroleum . An auction for the pipelines was announced in 1946 , which was designed to give preference to bidders who intended to use them for moving petroleum . 16 bids were received , with the highest cash bidders being companies hoping to use the pipelines for natural gas . Assessing the different bids proved difficult and the discussions became enmeshed in national politics , with companies seeking support from various Washington politicians . Meanwhile , a threatened national coal strike raised concerns over the availability of natural gas , strengthening the arguments of the natural gas lobby . 
 A fresh inquiry was declared in November , voiding the previous competition and the Inch Lines were transferred to the War Assets Administration on December 2 , 1946 , for disposal . Pending any final decision on their sale , the lines were leased to the Tennessee Gas Company for use in shipping natural gas as far as Ohio and the Appalachians , but no further east , and only for 12 months . Tennessee Gas did not convert the pipelines in any way for their new role , and simply pumped the gas through the system under its own pressure , moving 138 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic feet ( 3 @,@ 900 @,@ 000 m3 ) of gas a day in this way . 
 A second auction was held , with bids for natural gas given equal weight to those wishing to transfer crude oil , although any natural gas bidder would be obliged to maintain the oil pumping stations for use in a national emergency . Ten bids were received and on February 8 , 1947 , the Texas East Transmission Corporation ( TETCO ) was declared successful . Its bid of $ 143 @,@ 127 @,@ 000 would make the disposal the largest sale of war @-@ surplus property to the private sector following World War II . 
 = = Conversion by TETCO = = 
 TETCO was the brainchild of corporate lawyers Charles Francis and James Elkins , who convinced the construction specialists George and Herman Brown , and the fuel engineer E. Holley Poe , that buying the Big and Little Inch pipelines could be a lucrative opportunity . The corporation was established specifically for the purposes of the bid , and came to their bidding figure by estimating that the likely competition would bid at $ 130 million ; their own figure exceeded this by 10 percent , and added on $ 127 @,@ 000 to avoid a suspiciously round number . TETCO believed it could afford to make this offer because it intended to reuse the electric motors in the oil pumping mechanisms for moving the natural gas ; it also believed that the price of gas would rise considerably in the post @-@ war markets . 
 After winning the bidding , TETCO raised the money to pay the government through a combination of bonds and share issues . A further government enquiry was required before the sale was allowed to go through , which was complicated by the reluctance of the state of Pennsylvania to allow the pipelines to be used to pump gas east through its territory . The government of Pennsylvania was influenced by the coal industry , who feared they would lose sales , but it eventually relented and the sale of the pipelines to TETCO was finally completed on November 1 . The value of the company soared , and the original investors saw the value of their holdings increase 63 @-@ fold . 
 TETCO immediately began to convert the pipelines for permanent use as natural gas transmission lines , under the direction of Baxter Goodrich , their chief engineer . 24 compressor stations were constructed along the pipeline with centrifugal compressors , increasing the capacity of the system to 433 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic feet ( 12 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 m3 ) of gas a day , and the old oil pumps were retained for reuse in a future crisis . Steel valves replaced the older , less reliable cast iron designs . Demand continued to increase , requiring additional compressor capability , and by January 1949 the pipelines were moving 508 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 cubic feet ( 14 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 m3 ) a day . 
 The supply route undermined the local markets for manufactured gas , and the major cities of the north @-@ east rapidly converted to the use of natural gas ; historian David <unk> describes how the pipelines contributed to " an extraordinary expansion of natural gas customers and gas company employees after World War II " . The Inch pipelines encouraged the development of further long distance pipelines in the US through the 1960s and 1970s . 
 = = Later use = = 
 In 1957 , the operation of the Little Big Inch , and its ownership south of Ohio , was transferred from TETCO to the subsidiary Texas Eastern Petroleum Products Corporation ( <unk> ) , and converted back to use for petroleum products . <unk> was purchased by Enterprise Products in 2010 . Around 1961 , there was discussion of converting the Big Inch pipeline back to petroleum use , but it continued in use as a gas pipeline . In 1989 , TETCO was taken over by the Panhandle Eastern Corporation , and in 1997 this company was merged with Duke Power , to form the Duke Energy Corporation ; in 2007 , the oil pipelines were spun off from Duke Energy , to form part of Spectra Energy Partners . 
 The Inch pipelines are listed on the National Register of Historic Places . Along the western parts of the pipelines , around 90 percent of the pipes are the original installation , although in the east large parts have since been replaced , largely due to the absence of anti @-@ corrosion protective coatings on the original piping . 62 of the original buildings from 1942 and 1943 remain , including pump @-@ houses , offices , employee houses and garages . The best surviving examples of the original buildings are in Pennsylvania . A " Big Inch pipeline " construction playset was produced as a children 's toy in 1962 by the Marx company .

 = Horace Robertson = 
 Lieutenant General Sir Horace Clement Hugh Robertson , KBE , DSO ( 29 October 1894 – 28 April 1960 ) was a senior officer in the Australian Army who served in the First World War , the Second World War and the Korean War . He was one of the first graduates of the Royal Military College , Duntroon , to reach the ranks of major general and lieutenant general . 
 During the First World War , Robertson served with the 10th Light Horse in the Gallipoli Campaign , including the disastrous Battle of the Nek , where much of his regiment was wiped out . He later participated in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign , where he captured a Turkish Army general , and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order . 
 During the Second World War , Robertson led the 19th Infantry Brigade at the Battle of Bardia and accepted the surrender of the Italian Navy at Benghazi . Later , he commanded the 1st Armoured Division in Western Australia . In the final weeks of the war he commanded troops in the closing stages of the New Britain Campaign and the Aitape – Wewak campaign . At the end of the war , he accepted the surrender of Japanese Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi . 
 Following the war , he commanded the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in the Occupation of Japan and the British Commonwealth Forces Korea in the Korean War . Robertson was a key figure in establishing the Australian Armoured Corps . Its headquarters in Darwin is named Robertson Barracks in his honour . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Horace Clement Hugh Robertson was born in Warrnambool , Victoria , on 29 October 1894 , the sixth child of John Robertson , a state school teacher , and his wife Anne née Grey . Horace was educated at a state school in <unk> , from May 1905 to April 1910 , when he went to The Geelong College . Horace was nicknamed " Red Robbie " by his fellow schoolboys after his hair colour , in contrast to his older brother John , or " Black Robbie " . 
 In October 1911 Robertson took the entrance examination for the Royal Military College , Duntroon , and was accepted into the second intake of cadets in 1912 . His class was due to be commissioned on 1 January 1916 , but the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 caused it to be graduated early . He was commissioned as a lieutenant in both the Permanent Military Forces ( PMF ) and the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) on 3 November 1914 . 
 On 7 November 1914 , Robertson married Jessie Bonnar in a private service at a registry office in Collingwood . The ceremony was kept secret , because at the time junior officers required the Army 's permission to marry , and at age 20 Robertson would not have received it . Later they would claim that they had been married in 1916 . Their marriage produced no children . 
 = = First World War = = 
 Major General William Bridges decided that the Duntroon cadets , none of whom had yet finished their training , should be split up and posted to the various units of the AIF as regimental rather than staff officers . Robertson was posted to the 10th Light Horse as its machine @-@ gun officer . He was one of seven members of his class in the 3rd Light Horse Brigade . By the end of August 1915 , three of them would be dead . 
 The 10th Light Horse was concentrated at Claremont , Western Australia , before departing for the Middle East on the transport Mashobra in February 1915 . After arriving at Alexandria , Egypt , in March 1915 , the regiment moved to Mena Camp near Cairo . In May , the 3rd Light Horse Brigade began moving , without horses , to Gallipoli , preceded by the machine @-@ gun sections , which embarked at Alexandria on 8 May 1915 . At Gallipoli , the machine guns were brigaded together to provide additional firepower . Robertson 's machine guns were in support during the disastrous Battle of the Nek on 7 August 1915 , during which much of the 10th Light Horse became casualties . Afterwards , Robertson was promoted to captain and became second in command of A Squadron . He assumed command of C Squadron on 28 August , and led it in the fighting at Hill 60 the next day . 
 The 10th Light Horse was reorganised after returning to Egypt in January 1916 , and Robertson assumed command of B Squadron , with the AIF rank of major from May 1916 . This was as far as he could go , for Duntroon graduates could not be promoted above major in the AIF . This was the result of an AIF policy aimed at giving them a broad a range of experience , which would benefit the post @-@ war Army , while not allowing an accumulation of young officers of high rank , for whom the reduced post @-@ War Army would not have sufficient posts . His substantive rank remained that of lieutenant ; he would not be promoted to the substantive rank of captain in the PMF until 30 September 1920 , and promotion to major would not come until 1 July 1932 . At the Battle of Magdhaba , his colonel was wounded and Robertson took over command of the 10th Light Horse . He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order ( DSO ) for his actions during this battle . His citation read : 
 For distinguished and gallant service in the field . He led a mounted change and was the first officer to enter the enemy 's trenches . He is an officer of exceptional organising and training powers and thoroughly deserves reward . 
 Robertson 's men took many Turkish prisoners , including a senior officer of engineers who insisted that he would only surrender his sword to the Australian officer in charge . He was disappointed to discover that it was Robertson , a youthful major , but handed it over anyway . 
 In February 1917 Robertson was attached to the Desert Column as a staff officer . From there , he was sent to staff school in Egypt . However , on 7 March he suffered a broken leg in a riding accident and was hospitalised for two months . He returned to the staff school in May and finally graduated on 17 June . He was then posted to the newly formed Yeomanry Mounted Division as a General Staff Officer ( Grade 3 ) . In March 1918 , he was posted to Headquarters Delta Force in Cairo . This was disbanded in April and Robertson became Deputy Assistant Adjutant General ( <unk> ) at AIF Headquarters in Cairo . In January 1919 , he became Assistant Adjutant General ( AAG ) . He returned to Australia in July 1919 . In addition to his Distinguished Service Order , he was twice mentioned in despatches , and awarded the Order of the Nile ( 4th Class ) by the Sultan of Egypt . 
 = = Between the wars = = 
 On returning to Australia , Robertson became brigade major in the 7th Light Horse Brigade . In September 1920 he was posted to the staff of the 3rd Military District and then the 2nd Cavalry Division and the 3rd Division . In April 1922 he sat for and passed the entrance examination to the Staff College , Camberley , where his class included Majors Arthur Percival , John Smyth and Georges Vanier , and Lieutenant Colonel Harry Crerar . Robertson eventually became the first Australian to graduate with an A @-@ grade pass . 
 Afterwards , Robertson went on to attend a series of shorter training courses in Britain . He attended the School of Musketry at Hythe , Kent ; the Machine Gun School at Netheravon , Wiltshire ; the Artillery College at Woolwich ; the Anti @-@ Gas School at Porton Down ; the Anti @-@ Aircraft School at <unk> , Kent ; and the Royal Tank Corps School at Woolwich . He returned to Australia in 1925 to become Chief Instructor at the Small Arms School at Randwick , New South Wales in 1926 . Following the retirement of General Sir Harry Chauvel in 1930 , Robertson was posted to the 7th Infantry Brigade as its brigade major . In 1931 he became brigade major of the 1st Cavalry Brigade in Queensland . He returned to Sydney in February 1934 as General Staff Officer ( Grade 2 ) at the 2nd District Base . In June 1934 , he was appointed Director of Military Art at the Royal Military College , which had been transferred to Victoria Barracks , Sydney , as a cost @-@ cutting measure during the Great Depression . It returned to Canberra in 1937 , and Robertson returned with it . 
 Robertson was finally breveted as a lieutenant colonel in June 1936 . The rank became substantive in July 1937 . Like other regular officers , Robertson was opposed to the " Singapore strategy " , and therefore to the defence policy of the government of the day , and said so publicly in the British Army Quarterly . Robertson argued for a local defence of Australia by land and air units . The naval theorist , Admiral Sir Herbert Richmond , responding to Robertson 's arguments in an editorial , pointed out that local defence would fragment the British Empire 's defence effort and could not secure the sea lanes . However , in view of the weakness of the Royal Navy , Richmond was forced to concede that Robertson 's approach was not unreasonable .

 In March 1939 , Robertson was appointed commander of the 7th Military District , which encompassed the Northern Territory . It was his first command since the First World War . He was promoted to the temporary rank of colonel in August 1939 , and this became substantive in November . The job involved cooperation with the Royal Australian Navy and Royal Australian Air Force , and the administration of a company of regular soldiers known as the Darwin Mobile Force . After the Second World War began in September 1939 , Robertson became responsible for supplying the 7th Military District 's quota of volunteers for the Second Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) . A strike on the waterfront saw Robertson committing troops to help unload cargo . 
 On 4 April 1940 , Robertson joined the Second AIF himself , with the rank of brigadier , and was allocated the AIF service number <unk> . He was appointed to command the 19th Infantry Brigade , which was then being formed from units made surplus by the reduction of the 6th Division from 12 infantry battalions to nine . All three of its battalions , the 2 / 4th , 2 / 8th and 2 / 11th Infantry Battalions , were initially commanded by over @-@ age officers , but the commander of the 2 / 4th was replaced by Ivan Dougherty in August . Initially , Dougherty received a cool reception from Robertson , who was disappointed at being unable to select his own battalion commanders , but Dougherty soon made such a good impression that when Robertson went on leave in October 1940 he recommended that Dougherty act as brigade commander , despite the fact that he was the youngest and most junior of Robertson 's battalion chiefs . 
 The Battle of Bardia brought to the fore the simmering hostility between regular officers and reservists . Frank Berryman , the 6th Division 's General Staff Officer ( Grade 1 ) , and Alan Vasey , the Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General ( DA & QMG ) , were eager for Robertson to do well and show that Staff Corps officers could make good commanders , and if that could be done at the expense of an old @-@ style reservist like Stanley Savige , so much the better . They pushed for Robertson 's 19th Infantry Brigade , then in reserve , to be committed when the attack by Savige 's 17th Infantry Brigade slowed down . The abrupt manner in which this was done generated antipathy between Robertson and Savige . 
 The 19th Infantry Brigade then advanced on Tobruk . The attack on this fortified town proceeded along similar lines to that on Bardia , with the 16th Infantry effecting a break @-@ in of the position , but this time the 19th Infantry Brigade was to carry out the exploitation phase . Robertson 's contribution to the plan was to increase its tempo , so that the attack would be carried through without pause , the exploitation being carried out before the initial break @-@ in was complete . Robertson accepted the surrender of the fortress commander , Generale di Corpo d <unk> <unk> <unk> , and later Admiral <unk> <unk> , the Italian naval commander . Comments by " a sunburnt red @-@ headed Australian brigadier " made headlines in Britain , where senior officers rarely spoke to the media , but did not endear Robertson to his critics , who felt that his ego was out of control . Following the entry of the 19th Infantry Brigade to Benghazi on 7 February , Robertson declared " give me two stout ships and a bearing on Rome and we 'll dine in the hall of the caesars " . 
 For this campaign , Robertson was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) , but later that month he was hospitalised for varicose veins in the leg he had broken in 1917 . He was replaced as commander of the 19th Infantry Brigade by Alan Vasey . When Robertson recovered he was given responsibility for the training of AIF reinforcements in the Middle East . Robertson 's service in the field and his long experience in training troops made him an ideal candidate for the post . For his services , Robertson was mentioned in despatches a third time . 
 = = = Defence of Australia = = = 
 Around the time of the outbreak of war with Japan , many senior officers with distinguished records in the Middle East were recalled to Australia to lead militia formations and fill important staff posts . One of these was Robertson , who was recalled to take command of the 1st Cavalry Division in January 1942 . In March 1942 , an unusual event occurred . Major Generals Alan Vasey and Edmund Herring , and Brigadier Clive Steele , fearing that Gordon Bennett or John Lavarack was about to be appointed Commander in Chief , approached the Minister for the Army , Frank Forde , with a proposal that in view of the danger of an invasion of Australia , all officers over the age of 50 be immediately retired and Robertson be appointed Commander in Chief . This reflected an extraordinary endorsement of Robertson by his colleagues , but such favourable opinion was not universally held . Sydney Rowell later explained that : 
 Robbie , although in Sydney , was not unaware of what was going on . The thing that really riled me was Vasey 's saying that " perhaps Robbie 's vices in peace would be virtues in war , to which I replied that " if <unk> and disloyalty could be counted as virtues at any time I might be prepared to go along with him . " 
 The " revolt of the generals " collapsed with the welcome news that Blamey was returning from the Middle East to become Commander in Chief . In the reorganisation of the Army that followed , Robertson was appointed to command the 1st Armoured Division . Initially , the 1st Armoured Division had a key role in the defence of Australia as a mobile reserve , but it was only partly trained and equipped , representing another major challenge to Robertson as a trainer of troops . When the prospect of an invasion of Australia became remote , the 1st Armoured Division was sent to Western Australia in January 1943 , where it became part of Bennett 's III Corps . The area became a backwater and the 1st Armoured Division was slowly broken up and then disbanded . To recoup some of the nation 's investment in training for armoured warfare , Robertson arranged for 25 officers to be seconded to the British 7th Armoured Division in Europe . Following the disbandment of the 1st Armoured Division , Robertson took over command of the 2nd Division , the other division in Western Australia , and then , upon Bennett 's retirement , III Corps in April 1944 . This too was disbanded in June 1944 and Robertson took over Western Command . 
 Because the Army reached its greatest extent in 1942 and shrank in size thereafter , Blamey was faced with a limited number of senior appointments and more senior officers than he needed to fill them . He faced public and political criticism over " shelving " senior officers , including Robertson . That Robertson and Bennett , two troublesome potential rivals of Blamey 's , had been sent to Western Australia did not escape comment . However , it was always more likely that Robertson would be the one recalled . Nevertheless , Blamey had serious concerns about Robertson 's health , after the latter was hospitalised with internal haemorrhaging in July 1944 and sent to the eastern states to convalesce . While there he joined Vasey and Brigadier Bertrand Coombes , the Commandant of Duntroon , in conducting an inquiry into the future training and organisation of the Royal Military College . Their report , submitted to Blamey in January 1945 , called for a number of reforms , the most significant being that the postings of regular officers should alternate between staff and regimental duties .

 In April 1945 , Robertson returned to the field , replacing Alan Ramsay as commander of the 5th Division , which was then engaged in the final stages of the New Britain Campaign . In July , Robertson became commander of the 6th Division , leading it through the final days of the Aitape – Wewak Campaign . On 13 September 1945 , Robertson accepted the surrender of Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi , and his Japanese Eighteenth Army . In December 1945 , Robertson took over command of the First Army , becoming one of a select number of Australians to command such a formation , at least on paper , with the rank of lieutenant general . For the final campaigns , Robertson was mentioned in despatches a fourth time .

 = = = British Commonwealth Occupation Force = = = 
 Robertson returned to Australia in March 1946 to take over Southern Command . In June he was appointed to replace Lieutenant General John Northcott as commander of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) in the occupation of Japan . Northcott had negotiated the Northcott @-@ MacArthur agreement in January 1946 with General of the Army Douglas MacArthur , which governed the terms and conditions under which the BCOF would occupy part of Japan . They agreed that the BCOF would serve under American command , with American policy being followed . It remained to make the occupation work . Robertson had a poor relationship with the British component commander , Major General David Tennant Cowan , who resented being placed under an Australian officer . " It did not occur to me " , Robertson later wrote , " that officers of the British and Indian armies looked upon us from Australia and New Zealand as they looked upon Indians , and were prepared to do anything to avoid being publicly commanded by us . " 
 The British government 's principal interest in Japan was to renew pre @-@ war trade concessions , and to secure new ones ; it was particularly interested in the port city of Kobe . The Americans blocked these attempts . Robertson clashed repeatedly with Lieutenant General Sir Charles Gairdner , the official representative of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom . Gairdner was nominally senior in rank to Robertson until March 1947 , when Robertson was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant general , backdated to January 1944 . Robertson resisted Gairdner 's requests for BCOF aircraft for personal purposes . 
 = = = Korean War = = = 
 By mid @-@ 1950 , the BCOF was winding down . All the contingents other than the Australians had departed , and the Australians were preparing to leave . For his services as commander of the BCOF , Robertson was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( Military Division ) ( KBE ) in the King 's Birthday Honours List . Robertson intended to travel to London to be invested by King George VI but his plans were disrupted by the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950 . Robertson passed on to the Australian government requests from MacArthur for BCOF assistance , which were agreed to . He committed the frigate HMAS Shoalhaven and No. 77 Squadron RAAF but , although authorised to do so , he hesitated to deploy the 3rd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment , as he considered the risks too great . 
 Robertson built up what became the British Commonwealth Forces Korea ( <unk> ) . While the British government had hoped to have the Americans supply all their logistic support , Robertson realised that this was impossible . The US Army was being stretched to its limit just supporting itself and the army of the Republic of Korea , and British Commonwealth equipment was different in many respects . The British Army then scrambled to meet its own logistic needs , creating ad hoc arrangements and requesting support from Robertson and MacArthur . The Chief of the General Staff , Sydney Rowell , sent a cable to his British counterpart , Field Marshal Sir William Slim , warning of " a bugger 's muddle in which the only people to suffer will be the soldiers " . Slim agreed ; a Maintenance Area was established in Korea to support Commonwealth forces there , which drew some resources from American sources , such as petrol , oil and lubricants , engineer stores , casualty evacuation and port operations , and the rest from BCOF in Japan . 
 Once again , the British government did not wish to entrust its interests in Japan to a foreign officer , so the British Chiefs of Staff appointed Air Vice Marshal Cecil <unk> as their representative at MacArthur 's headquarters . His brief made it clear that he had no responsibility or authority over the BCOF or Commonwealth forces in Korea . After rashly ordering the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade to Pusan without transport or heavy equipment , much to Robertson 's annoyance , <unk> did attempt to confine himself to acting solely as a liaison officer . Following the dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur , Robertson held a press conference in which he defended the general and his conduct of the war . This constituted an implicit condemnation of the British government 's policy . Soon after , during the Battle of the Imjin River , Robertson was consulted by the Americans about the possible consequences of the loss of the 1st Battalion , the Gloucestershire Regiment , and he advised them not to endanger the rest of the I Corps line with a rescue attempt . For his services in the Korean War , he was awarded the American Legion of Merit , and the South Korean Order of Military Merit .

 Robertson was recalled to Australia in November 1951 , replacing Sir Edmund Herring as Director General of Recruiting . In January 1953 , Robertson took over Southern Command again . This put him in uncomfortably close proximity to Rowell , however , and the two clashed over a number of minor issues . Robertson turned 60 on 29 October 1954 , and retired the next day , after racking up 3 @,@ 985 days of active service in 43 years in the Australian Army . From 1954 to 1960 , he was honorary colonel of the Royal Australian Regiment . In retirement Robertson served on the committee of the Metropolitan Golf Club and was president of the Victorian branch of the Royal Empire Society for a time . He commenced writing his memoirs , which he promised would be " the million pound libel " . Unfortunately , the fate of the papers he gathered for it and the unfinished manuscript itself is unknown . 
 On 28 April 1960 he suffered a ruptured aorta and died at the Repatriation General Hospital , Heidelberg . His sudden death came as a shock to many . A funeral with full military honours was held at Scots ' Church , Melbourne . For pall bearers , he had eight generals : Leslie Beavis , Allan Boase , Cyril Clowes , Hector Edgar , Ragnar Garrett , Edmund Herring , Sydney Rowell and Colin Simpson . Frank Kingsley Norris carried his decorations while the 2nd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment and 1st Armoured Regiment provided honour guards for the largest military funeral since Blamey 's in 1951 . Afterwards , he was buried with his wife , who had died in 1956 , at Springvale Botanical Cemetery . The Robertson Barracks was later named in his honour .

 Curiosity is the first EP by Canadian recording artist Carly Rae Jepsen . It was released on February 14 , 2012 , by 604 Records . Initially planned as a full @-@ length album , Curiosity was cut down to a six @-@ song EP just days before its release . Musically , Curiosity is a pop album influenced by several genres such as dance @-@ pop and R & B , while its lyrical content is mostly about love . 
 Curiosity received generally positive reviews from contemporary music , with many praising the quality of the tracks and labeling it mainstream . Its lead single , " Call Me Maybe " , was a commercial success , topping the charts in several countries and is one of the best @-@ selling singles of all time , with over 18 million copies sold . The album peaked at number six on the Canadian Albums Chart .

 Jepsen 's second studio album was initially planned to be released on February 14 , 2012 ; however , she chose not to release it because she wanted to make sure she " got the second CD right . I think I got a little nervous about the idea of the sophomore being a little less @-@ than because it 's so rushed . So I wanted to give myself the time to not feel that pressure . " She then worked with songwriter Josh Ramsay and producer Ryan Stewart on most of the album 's tracks . Jepsen 's songwriting process was inspired by her life and friends . After the recording sessions were completed , Curiosity was announced as a full @-@ length album , with a digital release date confirmed for February 14 , 2012 . A few days before its official release , however , the label decided to change the format of the album , turning it into an extended play . 
 = = Composition = = 
 The EP opens with " Call Me Maybe " , an upbeat track that draws influences from dance @-@ pop and R & B. The clever lyrics of the song describes the " infatuation and inconvenience of a love at first sight , " as described by Bill Lamb of About.com. During the pre @-@ chorus , the singer states , " Ripped jeans , skin was showing / Hot night , wind was blowing / Where you think you ’ re going , baby ? " As the chorus begins , the background incorporates synthesized string chords , and she sings , " Hey , I just met you , And this is crazy , But here 's my number , So call me maybe . " Melody Lau of Rolling Stone wrote that " Call Me Maybe " is a " Taylor Swift meets Robyn " song . The title track , " Curiosity " , has a similar sound to " Call Me Maybe " , and features heavy dance beats and catchy hooks . In the song , Jepsen sings about being poorly treated by a bad boy , and begs for more of his love . " Picture " is a ballad that focuses on patience in a relationship . Critics noted that the song would work well during the climax of a motion picture due to its lyrical content . " Talk to Me " and " Just a Step Away " were both described as mid @-@ tempo pop songs that alludes to summer love , teen love and that first crush . Fiona Eadie of Cadence Canada noted that in both tracks , Carly is able to transcend the listener " to a porch swing or riding a bicycle along an old dirt road in the countryside ’ s summer sunshine . Her voice sings the highs and lows of love and everything that comes along with it . " The final song is a cover of Joni Mitchell 's " Both Sides Now " . Musically , the song is also an upbeat ballad , and differs from the original version in the sense that Jepsen 's version is " fresh and modern with her unique bubblegum twist . " Critics also added that Jepsen will be able to " attract a new generation to this widely recognized hit " with her " unique version . "
