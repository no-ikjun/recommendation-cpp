 = Kennedy half dollar = 
 The Kennedy half dollar , first minted in 1964 , is a fifty @-@ cent coin currently issued by the United States Mint . Intended as a memorial to the assassinated President John F. Kennedy , it was authorized by Congress just over a month after his death . Use of existing works by Mint sculptors Gilroy Roberts and Frank Gasparro allowed dies to be prepared quickly , and striking of the new coins began in January 1964 . 
 The silver coins vanished from circulation upon their release in March 1964 due to collectors , hoarders , and those interested in a memento of the late president . Although the Mint greatly increased production , the denomination was seldom seen in circulation . Continued rises in the price of silver increased the hoarding — many early Kennedy half dollars have been melted for their silver . Starting with 1965 @-@ dated pieces , the percentage of fine silver was reduced from 90 % to 40 % ( silver clad ) , but even with this change the coin saw little circulation . 
 In 1971 , silver was eliminated entirely from the coins . A special design for the reverse of the half dollar was issued for the United States Bicentennial and was struck in 1975 and 1976 . In addition to business strikes , special collector coins were struck for the Bicentennial in silver clad ; silver proof sets in which the dime , quarter and half dollar were struck in 90 % silver were first minted in 1992 . In 2014 a special edition of the Kennedy half dollar was also struck in 99 @.@ 99 % gold . 
 Even though ample supplies of circulating half dollars are readily available from banks , their circulation is extremely limited . Since 2002 , Kennedy half dollars have only been struck to satisfy the demand from collectors , and are available at a premium through the Mint . 
 = = Inception = = 
 Within hours of the assassination of John F. Kennedy on November 22 , 1963 , Mint Director Eva Adams called Chief Engraver Gilroy Roberts , informing him that serious consideration was being given to depicting Kennedy on one of the larger silver coins : either the silver dollar , half dollar , or quarter dollar . Adams called Roberts again on November 27 and authorized the project , stating that the late president 's widow , Jacqueline Kennedy preferred that he be depicted on the half dollar , replacing the previous design of Benjamin Franklin . Mrs. Kennedy 's reasoning was that she did not want to replace George Washington on the quarter . 
 In the interest of time ( the striking of the new coin was to begin in January 1964 ) , Roberts modified the existing bust of Kennedy he had created for use on the Kennedy medal in the Mint 's Presidential series , while Frank Gasparro began modifications to the reverse he had created for the same medal . Both Roberts ' and Gasparro 's designs had been approved by Kennedy . Roberts had met with Kennedy in person to show him early models of the design ; although the President expressed no opinion regarding the depiction , Roberts decided to make some changes after meeting him . After the Mint produced trial strikes , Jacqueline and Robert Kennedy were invited to view them . Mrs. Kennedy viewed the designs favorably , but suggested that the hair be altered slightly . It was also suggested that a full or half figure of the president be used instead of the profile , but Roberts noted that there was not enough time to produce an entirely new design because of the project 's time constraints , and also that he believed the left profile would give a more attractive appearance . 
 Frank Gasparro 's reverse design of the Kennedy half dollar was also influenced by the experience he gained from designing the President John . F. Kennedy appreciation medal . In 1962 , President Kennedy had three hundred appreciation medals struck by the United States Mint in Philadelphia that were later presented during his June 23 , 1963 through July 2 , 1963 trip to the nations of Federal Republic of Germany , Germany ( West Berlin ) , Ireland , United Kingdom , Italy , and the Vatican City State . The reverse design of the Kennedy appreciation medal depicts a larger and more detailed Presidential Seal than the one he designed on the Mint 's Presidential series ( Bureau of the Mint Presidential series stock medal # 135 known as the John F. Kennedy Presidential inauguration medal ) . Gasparro 's placement of his initials FG is also similarly located ( under the right leg of the eagle ) on both the Kennedy appreciation medal and Kennedy half dollar . 
 Congressional approval was required for any design change within 25 years of the last . In early December , Representative Henry Gonzalez ( Democrat @-@ Texas ) introduced a bill for Kennedy to appear on the half dollar . On December 10 , the new President , Lyndon Johnson , endorsed the call for a Kennedy half dollar , asking Congress to pass the legislation promptly to allow striking of the new piece to begin early in 1964 . President Johnson stated that he had been moved by letters from many members of the public to agree with the plan . The bill to authorize the Kennedy half dollar passed on December 30 , 1963 . Work was already underway on coinage dies ; the use of the already @-@ available designs allowed for the completion of the first dies on January 2 , 1964 . Only proof coins were initially struck . The first Kennedy half dollars intended for circulation were struck at the Denver Mint on January 30 , 1964 , followed by the Philadelphia Mint the next week . A ceremonial first strike was held at both Philadelphia and Denver on February 11 , 1964 .

 The Treasury Department made the coins available to the public beginning on March 24 , 1964 . A line a block long formed at the department 's windows in Washington to purchase the 70 @,@ 000 coins initially allocated for public sale . Although the department limited sales to 40 per customer , by the end of the day , the coins were gone , but the line had not shortened . Banks in Boston and Philadelphia quickly rationed supplies , but still sold out by noon . Sales in New York did not begin until the following day , and rationing was imposed there as well , to the disgruntlement of the head of the coin department at <unk> , the largest dealer in the city , which had hoped to sell the coins at a premium . 
 The coins were popular overseas as well . U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs G. Mennen Williams distributed plastic @-@ encased specimens to presidents and foreign ministers of African nations and to the U.S. ambassadors serving there " to win friends for the United States in Africa " . Shortly after the coin 's release , the Denver Mint began receiving complaints that the new coin depicted a hammer and sickle on the bottom of Kennedy 's truncated bust . In response , Roberts stated that the portion of the design in question was actually his monogram , a stylized " GR " . 
 The Mint struck Kennedy half dollars in large numbers in an attempt to meet the overwhelming demand . The Treasury had initially planned to issue 91 million half dollars for 1964 , but raised the number to 141 million . However , a public announcement of the increase failed to cause more coins to actually circulate or to decrease the prices on the secondary market . By late November , the Mint had coined approximately 160 million pieces , yet the coin was almost never seen in circulation . Silver prices were rising , and many coins were being hoarded . Hopeful that issuing more 1964 @-@ dated coins would counter the speculation in them , the Treasury requested and received Congressional authorization to continue striking 1964 @-@ dated coins into 1965 . Eventually , almost 430 million half dollars dated 1964 were struck , a sum greater than the total struck for circulation in the sixteen years of the Franklin half dollar series . 
 These minting operations were rapidly depleting the Treasury 's stock of silver . Prices for the metal were rising to such an extent that , by early June , a dime contained 9 @.@ 33 cents ' worth of silver at market prices . On June 3 , 1965 , President Johnson announced plans to eliminate silver from the dime and quarter in favor of a clad sandwich with layers of copper @-@ nickel on each side of a layer of pure copper . The half dollar was changed from 90 % silver to 40 % . Congress passed the Coinage Act of 1965 in July . The new half dollars retained their silvery appearance , due to the outer layer being 80 % silver and 20 % copper . The coin was also minted with an inner layer of 21 % silver and 79 % copper . The first clad half dollars were struck at the Denver Mint on December 30 , 1965 . They bore the date 1965 ; the date would not be changed for US coins until the coin shortage was eased . Beginning on August 1 , 1966 , the Mint began to strike 1966 @-@ dated pieces , and thereafter it resumed the normal practice of striking the current year 's date on each piece . Despite the proclaimed end to the coin shortage , Kennedy half dollars circulated little , a scarcity caused by continued hoarding and a dip in production , with the Treasury reluctant to expend more of the nation 's silver holdings on a coin which did not circulate . According to coin dealer and numismatic author Q. David Bowers , 
 Where the hundreds of millions of them went remains somewhat of a mystery today . In the meantime , Washington quarters , the same design used since 1932 , became the highest value coin of the realm , in terms of circulation use . These were particularly popular for vending machines , arcade games , and the like . Today , this continues to be the case , and Kennedy half dollars as well as the later mini @-@ dollar coins , are almost never encountered . " 
 = = = Switch to base metal = = = 
 In May 1969 , the Treasury sought authorization to eliminate the half dollar 's silver content , changing it to the same copper @-@ nickel clad composition as the dime and quarter . The Treasury also sought approval to strike base @-@ metal dollar coins , which would fill a need for gaming tokens in Western casinos . Former president Dwight Eisenhower had died recently , and there was discussion of placing Eisenhower 's portrait on the dollar . The Treasury hoped that with the removal of the silver content , the coin would cease to be hoarded and again circulate . Despite the support of President Richard Nixon , some Republicans in the House of Representatives initially scuttled the legislation , disliking the idea of putting Eisenhower on a base metal coin . The dispute dragged on for over a year before Nixon signed a bill on December 31 , 1970 which authorized the Eisenhower dollar and eliminated silver from the half dollar . As a result of the delay , in 1970 non @-@ proof half dollars were only made in Denver and released solely in mint sets . With a mintage of 2 @.@ 1 million the 1970 @-@ D Kennedy is considered the " key " to the series , although enough were produced to keep prices modest . The Mint did not announce that 1970 half dollars would not be struck for circulation until after mint set ordering had closed . 
 By the time silver was eliminated from the half dollar , it had been out of circulation for so long that banks had eliminated the slot for the denomination from machines . The Mint anticipated a comeback for the denomination , but in July 1971 , Mint Director Mary Brooks disclosed that the Treasury was holding 200 million of the new base metal half dollars , as commercial banks expressed little interest in ordering them . " I can 't understand the population . They 're not using them . " According to Brooks , most of the over one billion Kennedy half dollars containing silver had been hoarded by the public . Brooks theorized that because the silver Kennedy half dollar never circulated much and few half dollars were struck in 1970 in anticipation of the authorization to eliminate silver , the public had become accustomed to not seeing the half dollar in trade . Brooks suggested , " If the country knew there were plenty of them around , they 'd probably start hoarding them , too . " 
 On March 5 , 1973 , Brooks announced that the Mint would be soliciting new reverse designs for the half dollar and dollar to commemorate the 1976 United States Bicentennial . On October 18 , President Nixon signed Public Law 93 @-@ 127 , which provided for new reverse designs for the quarter , half dollar , and dollar . The designs were to be emblematic of the Bicentennial era . The Mint announced a competition open to all American sculptors . Seth G. Huntington 's design depicting Independence Hall was selected for the half dollar . All half dollars struck in 1975 and 1976 bore the double date 1776 – 1976 on the obverse and Huntington 's design on the reverse . Over 521 million Bicentennial half dollars were struck for circulation . 
 Following the high mintage of the Bicentennial piece , the number of pieces struck per year declined . However , in 1979 , Mint Director Stella B. Hackel indicated that the Mint would continue to strike them . " We really don 't think many half dollars are being used in commerce . They do go somewhere , though , so someone must want them . " By then , more than 2 @.@ 5 billion Kennedy half dollars had been struck , more than all previously struck half dollars combined . The New York Times numismatic columnist Ed Reiter suggested that hoarding had continued even into the base @-@ metal era , accounting for the shortage of pieces in commerce . The late 1970s saw the destruction of many early Kennedy half dollars , as high silver prices caused extensive melting for the metal content . 
 The coin continued to be struck through the remainder of the twentieth century , and mintage numbers remained relatively steady in both the Philadelphia and Denver mints until 1987 , a year in which no half dollars were struck for circulation ; the Treasury had accumulated a two @-@ year supply of the pieces , making further production <unk> . Demand for half dollars dropped , and casinos ( where they were commonly used ) increasingly began producing fifty cent tokens to use in place of the coins . With mintage numbers remaining low , beginning in 2002 , the Kennedy half dollar ceased to be struck for general circulation . Rolls and bags of the current year 's pieces may be purchased from the Mint , at a premium above face value . 
 In January 2014 , a private firm , on behalf of the Mint , began surveying customers on possible options for a special issue of the half dollar in commemoration of its 50th anniversary . In June , the Mint announced plans to issue seven special 2014 Kennedy half dollars in commemoration of the series ' fiftieth anniversary : two in clad , from Philadelphia and Denver , four in silver from Philadelphia , Denver , San Francisco , and the West Point Mint , and one in .9999 gold , from West Point . The clad and silver versions bear the normal date ; the gold coin has the double date 1964 – 2014 . All have higher relief than the usual issues . The gold coins were released in conjunction with the American Numismatic Association convention in Rosemont , Illinois on August 5 , 2014 . 
 = = Collecting = = 
 With the exception of 1965 through 1967 , proofs have been struck each year in the same metallic composition as regular issue pieces . The first Kennedy half dollar proofs were struck in early January 1964 . Early strikes depicted Kennedy with heavily accented hair ; an estimated 100 @,@ 000 coins were struck with this feature . This was altered for the remainder of the mintage of nearly four million proof coins . Due to the coin shortage , the Treasury Department announced that no proof sets would be struck in 1965 . Instead , Special Mint Sets would be struck to satisfy collector demand . Coins for these sets , minted at the San Francisco Assay Office , were struck with no mint marks early in 1966 with heavily polished dies dated 1965 . Similar sets bearing the dates 1966 and 1967 were also struck . A few of the 1966 halves from the Special Mint Sets are known with Gasparro 's initials " FG " missing from the reverse , apparently because of an <unk> die . The first year 's production was sold in soft plastic packaging ; the 1966 and 1967 issues were sonically sealed in hard plastic cases . In 1968 , regular proof coinage was resumed , although production of proof coins was shifted to San Francisco , the " S " mintmark added and sets were encapsulated in hard plastic . 
 In 1973 , Congress authorized silver @-@ clad collector versions of the Bicentennial coins ; in April 1975 , the Mint began to strike them . The coins were issued in both proof and uncirculated quality . Copper @-@ nickel clad Bicentennial coins were placed in both the 1975 and 1976 proof sets , while their silver clad counterparts were sold in three coin sets . Since 1992 , the Mint has struck Kennedy half dollars in 90 % silver for inclusion in special silver proof sets . 1964 proofs were struck in Philadelphia , and since 1968 , proof coins have been struck in San Francisco only . In 1998 , some silver proof pieces were struck to a matte finish for inclusion in a set along with a Robert Kennedy commemorative silver dollar . From 2005 – 2010 , uncirculated pieces included in mint sets received a matte finish , which differentiates them from the pieces sold in bags and rolls . 
 = Macedonia ( terminology ) = 
 The name " Macedonia " is used in a number of competing or overlapping meanings to describe geographical , political and historical areas , languages and peoples in a part of south @-@ eastern Europe . It has been a major source of political controversy since the early 20th century . The situation is complicated because different ethnic groups use different terminology for the same entity , or the same terminology for different entities , with different political connotations . 
 Historically , the region has presented markedly shifting borders across the Balkan peninsula . Geographically , no single definition of its borders or the names of its subdivisions is accepted by all scholars and ethnic groups . Demographically , it is mainly inhabited by four ethnic groups , three of which self @-@ identify as Macedonians : two , a Bulgarian and a Greek one at a regional level , while a third ethnic Macedonian one at a national level . Linguistically , the names and affiliations of languages and dialects spoken in the region are a source of controversy . Politically , the rights to the extent of the use of the name Macedonia and its derivatives has led to a diplomatic dispute between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia . Despite mediation of the United Nations , the dispute is still pending resolution since 1993 , but as a result it was admitted under the provisional reference of the " former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia " , sometimes abbreviated as FYROM . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name Macedonia derives from the Greek Μακεδονία ( <unk> ) , a kingdom ( later , region ) named after the ancient Macedonians . Their name , <unk> ( <unk> ) , is cognate to the Ancient Greek adjective <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " tall , slim " . It was traditionally derived from the Indo @-@ European root * <unk> , meaning ' long ' or ' slender ' ( attested in Homer , and recorded by Hesychius of Alexandria as a Doric word meaning " large " ) , or makros ( ' long , large ' ) , as well as related words in other Indo @-@ European languages . It is commonly explained as having originally meant ' the tall ones ' or ' highlanders ' . However , according to modern research by Robert S. P. <unk> , both terms are of Pre @-@ Greek substrate origin and cannot be explained in terms of Indo @-@ European morphology . 
 = = History = = 
 The region of Macedonia has been home to several historical political entities , which have used the name Macedonia ; the main ones are given below . The borders of each of these entities were different . 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 = = = = Ancient Macedonia = = = = 
 Macedonia or Macedon , the ancient kingdom , was centered on the fertile plains west of the Gulf of Salonica ; the first Macedonian state emerged in the 8th or early 7th century BC . Its extent beyond the center varied ; some Macedonian kings could not hold their capital ; Philip II expanded his power until it reached from Epirus , across Thrace to Gallipoli , and from Thermopylae to the Danube . His son Alexander the Great conquered most of the land in southwestern Asia stretching from what is currently Turkey in the west to parts of India in the east . However , while Alexander 's conquests are of major historical importance as having launched the Hellenistic Age , Macedon as a state had no significant territorial gains due to them . Alexander 's kingdom fell apart after his death in 323 BC ; several of his Successors attempted to form a kingdom for themselves in Macedonia ; the kingdom formed by Antigonus Gonatas contained all the land Philip II had started with and controlled much of what is now modern Greece ; it lasted until the Romans divided it into four republics in 168 BC . 
 = = = = Roman Macedonia = = = = 
 The ancient Romans had two different entities called Macedonia , at different levels . Macedonia was established as a Roman province in 146 BC . Its boundaries were shifted from time to time for administrative convenience , but during the Roman Republic and the Principate it extended west to the Adriatic and south to Central Greece . 
 Under Diocletian , Thessaly , including parts of West Macedonia , was split off to form a new province , and the central and southern Balkan provinces were grouped into the Diocese of Moesia . At some point in the 4th century ( first securely attested in 370 ) this was divided into two new dioceses , the mostly Latin @-@ speaking Diocese of Dacia in the north and the mostly Greek @-@ speaking Diocese of Macedonia in the south . Under Constantine the Great , the western part of the province of Macedonia was also split off to form the new province of Epirus nova . After Constantine 's death , the western Balkans , Macedonia included , became part of the praetorian prefecture of Illyricum . 
 With the exception of a short @-@ lived division between Macedonia Prima in the south and Macedonia <unk> in the north towards the end of the 4th century ( attested only in the Notitia Dignitatum ) , Macedonia formed a single province until re @-@ divided into southern and northern parts sometime in the late 5th century ( the division is first securely attested in 482 ) , although the province seems to have been reunified by 535 . According to the 6th @-@ century <unk> , Macedonia Prima , with Thessalonica as its capital and governed by a consularis , counted 32 cities , and Macedonia Secunda in the north , with <unk> as its capital and governed by a praeses , only eight . The approximate boundary between the two ran on a rough line from north of Bitola ( which belonged to Macedonia Prima ) to the area of Demir Kapija . 
 = = = = Byzantine Macedonia = = = = 
 During the 7th century , most of the Balkans were overrun by Slavic invasions , which left only the fortified towns and the coasts in the hands of the Greek @-@ speaking Byzantine Empire . " Macedonia " was then used for a new theme in the late 8th century under Irene of Athens . Geographically however it was located in Thrace and not in Macedonia , which was under the themes of Thessalonica , Strymon and other smaller commands such as <unk> or <unk> . Themes were not named geographically and the original sense was " army " . They became districts during the military and fiscal crisis of the seventh century , when the Byzantine armies were instructed to find their supplies from the locals , wherever they happened to be . Thus the Armeniac theme was considerably west of Armenia ; the Thracesian Theme was in Asia Minor , not in Thrace . The Macedonian dynasty of the Byzantine Empire acquired its name from its founder , Basil I the Macedonian , an Armenian by descent , who was born in the theme of Macedonia . 
 The interior of Macedonia remained in Slavic and later Bulgarian hands until the campaigns of Basil II , which ended the existence of the Bulgarian state and extended Byzantine authority across the central and northern Balkans . Thereafter Macedonia remained under Byzantine control until the Fourth Crusade ( 1204 ) . A short @-@ lived Latin Kingdom of Thessalonica was established which survived until 1224 , when it was captured by Epirus . Most of Macedonia then came under the control of the Empire of Nicaea in 1246 , although its northern regions remained disputed with the Serbs and the Bulgarians . Most of the region was conquered by the Serbs under Stephen <unk> during the Byzantine civil war of 1341 – 1347 . Only Thessalonica and its environs remained in Byzantine hands . By the late 14th century , the Ottoman Turks in turn had conquered the region , although Thessalonica held out under Byzantine and later Venetian control until 1430 . 
 = = = = Ottoman Macedonia = = = = 
 The Ottomans did not keep Macedonia as an administrative unit : since 1864 parts of geographical Macedonia lay in three <unk> , which also comprised some non @-@ Macedonian areas . Northern Macedonia was part of the Kosovo vilayet and then of Skopje ; the Thessaloniki ( south Macedonia ) , and the Monastir ( Central Macedonia ) vilayet were also created . This administrative division lasted until 1912 – 13 , when Macedonia was divided among the Balkan states . 
 = = = Modern history = = = 
 Since the early stages of the Greek Revolution , the provisional government of Greece claimed Macedonia as part of Greek national territory , but the Treaty of Constantinople ( 1832 ) , which established a Greek independent state , set its northern boundary between Arta and Volos . When the Ottoman Empire started breaking apart , Macedonia was claimed by all members of the Balkan League ( Serbia , Montenegro , Greece and Bulgaria ) , and by Romania . Under the Treaty of San Stefano that ended the Russo @-@ Turkish War , 1877 – 78 the entire region , except Thessaloniki , was included in the borders of Bulgaria , but after the Congress of Berlin in 1878 the region was returned to the Ottoman Empire . The armies of the Balkan League advanced and occupied Macedonia in the First Balkan War in 1912 . Because of disagreements between the allies about the partition of the region , the Second Balkan War erupted , and in its aftermath the arbitrary region of Macedonia was split into the following entities , that existed or still exist in this region : 
 Macedonia ( as a region of Greece ) refers to three regions in northern Greece , incorporated in 1913 , as a result of the Balkan Wars between the Ottoman Empire and the Balkan League . 
 Macedonia ( as a People 's Republic within Yugoslavia ) used to refer to the People 's Republic of Macedonia established in 1946 , later known as the Socialist Republic of Macedonia , one of the constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , renamed in 1963 . Between 1929 and 1941 this region was part of Vardar Banovina province in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia . 
 Macedonia ( as a contemporary sovereign state ) refers to the conventional short form name of the Republic of Macedonia , which held a referendum and established its independence from Yugoslavia on 8 September 1991 . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Macedonia ( as a current geographical term ) refers to a region of the Balkan peninsula in south @-@ eastern Europe , covering some 60 @,@ 000 or 70 @,@ 000 square kilometers . Although the region 's borders are not officially defined by any international organization or state , in some contexts , the territory appears to correspond to the basins of ( from west to east ) the Haliacmon ( <unk> ) , Vardar / Axios and Struma / <unk> rivers , and the plains around Thessaloniki and Serres . 
 In a historic context , the term Macedonia was used in various ways . Macedonia was not an administrative division of the Ottoman Empire ; its entire territory was part of the <unk> of Rumelia . The geographer H. R. Wilkinson suggests that the region " defies definition " but that many <unk> agree " on its general location " . Macedonia was well enough defined in 1897 for Gladstone to propose " Macedonia for the Macedonians " ; philhellenes argued that the phrase could not be used by a man of <unk> , while <unk> asserted that there are six different kinds of Macedonians , and only Turkish rule could prevail total anarchy in the region . The Balkan nations began to proclaim their rights to it after the Treaty of San Stefano in 1878 and its revision at the Congress of Berlin . 
 Many ethnographic maps were produced in this period of controversy ; these differ primarily in the areas given to each nationality within Macedonia . This was in part a result of the choice of definition : an inhabitant of Macedonia might well have different nationalities depending on whether the basis of classification was denomination , descent , language , self @-@ identification or personal choice . In addition , the Ottoman census , taken on the basis of religion , was misquoted by all sides ; descent , or " race " , was largely conjectural ; inhabitants of Macedonia might speak a different language at the market and at home , and the same Slavic dialect might be called Serbian " with Bulgarian influences " , Macedonian , or West @-@ Bulgarian . 
 These maps also differed somewhat in the boundaries given to Macedonia . Its only <unk> limits were the Aegean Sea and the Serbian and Bulgarian frontiers ( as of 1885 ) ; where it bordered Old Serbia , Albania , and Thrace ( all parts of Ottoman Rumelia ) was debatable . 
 The Greek ethnographer Nicolaides , the Austrian Meinhard , and the Bulgarian <unk> placed the northern boundary of Macedonia at the Šar Mountains and the Crna hills , as had scholars before 1878 . The Serb <unk> preferred a line much further south , assigning the entire region from Skopje to Strumica to " Old Serbia " ; and some later Greek geographers have defined a more restricted Macedonia . In addition , maps might vary in smaller details : as to whether this town or that was Macedonian . One Italian map included Prizren , where Nicolaides and Meinhard had drawn the boundary just south of it . On the south and west , Grevena , Korçë , and <unk> varied from map to map ; on the east , the usual line is the lower Mesta / Nestos river and then north or northwest , but one German geographer takes the line so far west as to exclude Bansko and <unk> / <unk> <unk> .

 The region of Macedonia is commonly divided into three major and two minor sub @-@ regions . The name Macedonia appears under certain contexts on the major regions , while the smaller ones are traditionally referred to by other local toponyms : 
 = = = = Major regions = = = = 
 The region of Macedonia is commonly split geographically into three main sub @-@ regions , especially when discussing the Macedonian Question . The terms are used in non @-@ partisan scholarly works , although they are also used in ethnic Macedonian literature of an irredentist nature . 
 Aegean Macedonia ( or Greek Macedonia ) is a term that refers to an area in the south of the Macedonia region . The borders of the area are , overall , those of ancient Macedonia in Greece . It covers an area of 34 @,@ 200 square kilometres ( 13 @,@ 200 sq mi ) ( for discussion of the reported irredentist origin of this term , see Aegean Macedonia ) . 
 Pirin Macedonia ( or Bulgarian Macedonia ) is an area in the east of the Macedonia region . The borders of the area approximately coincide with those of Blagoevgrad Province in Bulgaria . It covers an area of 6 @,@ 449 square kilometres ( 2 @,@ 490 sq mi ) . 
 Vardar Macedonia ( formerly Yugoslav Macedonia ) is an area in the north of the Macedonia region . The borders of the area are those of the Republic of Macedonia . It covers an area of 25 @,@ 333 square kilometres ( 9 @,@ 781 sq mi ) . 
 = = = = Minor regions = = = = 
 In addition to the above named sub @-@ regions , there are also two smaller regions , in Albania and Serbia respectively . These regions are also considered geographically part of Macedonia . They are referred to by ethnic Macedonians as follows , but typically are not so referred to by non @-@ partisan scholars . 
 Mala Prespa and Golo Brdo is a small area in the west of the Macedonia region in Albania , mainly around Lake Ohrid . It includes parts of the Korçë , Pogradec and <unk> districts . These districts in whole occupy about 3 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 1 @,@ 158 sq mi ) , but the area concerned is significantly smaller . Gora ( part of the municipality of Dragaš ) and <unk> <unk> are minor parts in the north of the Macedonia region in Serbia . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 The region , as defined above , has a total population of about 5 million . The main disambiguation issue in demographics is the self @-@ identifying name of two contemporary groups . The ethnic Macedonian population of the Republic of Macedonia self @-@ identify as Macedonian on a national level , while the Greek Macedonians self @-@ identify as both Macedonian on a regional , and Greek on a national level . According to the Greek arguments , the ancient Macedonians ' nationality was Greek and thus , the use of the term on a national level lays claims to their history . This disambiguation problem has led to a wide variety of terms used to refer to the separate groups , more information of which can be found in the terminology by group section . 
 The self @-@ identifying Macedonians ( collectively referring to the inhabitants of the region ) that inhabit or inhabited the area are : 
 As an ethnic group , Macedonians refers to the majority ( 64 @.@ 7 % , 2002 ) of the population of the Republic of Macedonia . Statistics for 2002 indicate the population of ethnic Macedonians within the country as c . 1 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 . On the other hand , as a legal term , it refers to all the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia , irrespective of their ethnic or religious affiliation . However , the preamble of the constitution distinguishes between " the Macedonian people " and the " Albanians , Turks , Vlachs , <unk> and other nationalities living in the Republic of Macedonia " , but for whom " full equality as citizens " is provided . As of 2002 the total population of the country is 2 @,@ 022 @,@ 547 . 
 As a regional group in Greece , Macedonians refers to ethnic Greeks ( 98 % , 2001 ) living in regions referred to as Macedonia , and particularly Greek Macedonia . This group composes the vast majority of the population of the Greek region of Macedonia . The 2001 census for the total population of the Macedonia region in Greece shows 2 @,@ 625 @,@ 681 . 
 The same term in antiquity described the inhabitants of the kingdom of Macedon , including their notable rulers Philip II and Alexander the Great who self @-@ identified as Greeks . 
 As a regional group in Bulgaria , Macedonians refers to the inhabitants of Bulgarian Macedonia , who in their vast majority self @-@ identify as Bulgarians at a national level and as Macedonians at a regional , but not ethnic level . As of 2001 , the total population of Bulgarian Macedonia is 341 @,@ 245 , while the ethnic Macedonians living in the same region are 3 @,@ 117 . The Bulgarian Macedonians also self @-@ identify as <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) to avoid confusion with the neighboring ethnic group . 
 Macedo @-@ Romanians can be used as an alternative name for Aromanians , people living throughout the southern Balkans , especially in northern Greece , Albania , the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria , and as an emigrant community in Northern Dobruja , Romania . According to Ethnologue , their total population in all countries is 306 @,@ 237 . This not very frequent appellation is the only one with the <unk> portmanteau , both within the members of the same ethnic group and the other ethnic groups in the area . To make matters more confusing , Aromanians are often called " <unk> " by Romanians , as opposed to the citizens of Macedonia , who are called " <unk> " . 
 The ethnic Albanians living in the region of Macedonia , as defined above , are mainly concentrated in the Republic of Macedonia ( especially in the northwestern part that borders Kosovo and Albania ) , and less in the Albanian minor sub @-@ region of Macedonia around the Lake Ohrid . As of 2002 , the total population of Albanians within the republic is 509 @,@ 083 or 25 @.@ 2 % of the country 's total population . 
 = = Linguistics = = 
 As language is one of the elements tied in with national identity , the same disputes that are voiced over demographics are also found in linguistics . There are two main disputes about the use of the word Macedonian to describe a linguistic phenomenon , be it a language or a dialect : 
 The origins of the Ancient Macedonian language are currently debated . At this time it is not conclusively determined whether the language / dialect was a Greek dialect related to Doric Greek and / or <unk> Greek dialects among others , a sibling language of ancient Greek forming a Hellenic ( i.e. Greco @-@ Macedonian ) supergroup , or viewed as an Indo @-@ European language which is a close cousin to Greek ( and perhaps somewhat related to Thracian and / or Phrygian languages ) . The scientific community generally agrees that , although sources are available ( e.g. Hesychius ' lexicon , Pella curse tablet ) there is no decisive evidence to exclude any of the above hypotheses . 
 Modern Macedonian language , a south Slavic language , is unrelated to the Ancient Macedonian language . It is currently the subject of two major disputes . The first is over the name ( alternative ways of referring to this language can be found in the terminology by group section and in the article Macedonian language naming dispute ) . The second dispute is over the existence of a Macedonian language distinct from Bulgarian , the denial of which is a position supported by nationalist groups , Bulgarian and other linguists and also by many ordinary Bulgarians . 
 Macedonian is also the name of a dialect of Modern Greek , a language of the Indo @-@ European family . Additionally , Macedo @-@ Romanian is an Eastern Romance language , spoken in Southeastern Europe by the Aromanians . 
 = = Politics = = 
 The controversies in geographic , linguistic and demographic terms , are also manifested in international politics . Among the autonomous countries that were formed as a result of the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s , was the ( until then ) subnational entity of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , by the official name of " Socialist Republic of Macedonia " , the others being Serbia , Slovenia , Croatia , Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro . The peaceful break @-@ away of that nation resulted in the change of its name to " Republic of Macedonia " . 
 Republic of Macedonia is the constitutional name of the sovereign state which occupies the northern part of the geographical region of Macedonia , which roughly coincides with the geographic subregion of Vardar Macedonia . The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ( FYROM ) is a term used to refer to this state by the main international organisations , including United Nations , European Union , NATO , IMF , WTO , IOC , World Bank , EBRD , OSCE , FIFA , and FIBA . The term was introduced in 1993 by the United Nations , following a naming dispute with Greece . Some countries use this term as a stop @-@ gap measure , pending resolution of the naming dispute . 
 Greece and the Republic of Macedonia each consider this name a compromise : it is opposed by some Greeks for containing the Greek self @-@ identifying name Macedonia , and by many in the Republic of Macedonia for not being the short self @-@ identifying name . Greece uses it in both the abbreviated ( FYROM or <unk> ) and <unk> form ( <unk> <unk> Δημοκρατία της <unk> ) . 
 Macedonia refers also to a geographic region in Greece , which roughly coincides with the southernmost major geographic subregion of Macedonia . It is divided in the three administrative sub @-@ regions ( regions ) of West , Central , and East Macedonia and Thrace . The region is overseen by the Ministry for Macedonia – Thrace . The capital of Greek Macedonia is Thessaloniki , which is the largest city in the region of Macedonia ; Greeks often call it the " co @-@ capital " of Greece . 
 = = = Ethnic Macedonian nationalism = = = 
 Ethnic Macedonian <unk> following the idea of a " United Macedonia " have expressed claims to what they refer to as " Aegean Macedonia " ( in Greece ) , " Pirin Macedonia " ( in Bulgaria ) , " Mala Prespa and Golo Bardo " ( in Albania ) , and " Gora and <unk> <unk> " ( in Serbia ) . 
 Loring Danforth , a professor of anthropology at Bates College , asserts that ethnic Macedonian nationalists , who are concerned with demonstrating the continuity between ancient and modern Macedonians , deny they are Slavs and claim to be the direct descendants of Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians . Danforth stresses , however , that the more moderate Macedonian position , publicly endorsed by Kiro <unk> , the first president of the Republic of Macedonia , is modern Macedonians have no relation to Alexander the Great , but are a Slavic people whose ancestors arrived in Macedonia in the sixth century AD . Proponents of both the extreme and the moderate Macedonian positions stress that the ancient Macedonians were a distinct non @-@ Greek people . In addition to affirming the existence of the Macedonian nation , Macedonians are concerned with affirming the existence of a unique Macedonian language as well . They thus emphasize that the Macedonian language has a history dating to the Old Church Slavonic used by Saints Cyril and Methodius in the ninth century . 
 Although ethnic Macedonians agree Macedonian minorities exist in Bulgaria and Greece and these minorities have been subjected to harsh policies of forced assimilation , there are two different positions with regard to what their future should be . These were summarized by Danforth : 
 The goal of more extreme Macedonian nationalists is to create a " free , united , and independent Macedonia " by " liberating " the parts of Macedonia " temporarily occupied " by Bulgaria and Greece . More moderate Macedonian nationalists recognize the inviolability of the Bulgarian and Greek borders and explicitly renounce any territorial claims against the two countries . They do , however , demand that Bulgaria and Greece recognize the existence of Macedonian minorities in their countries and grant them the basic human rights they deserve . 
 <unk> and official government publications in the Republic have shown the country as part of an " <unk> " whole , although the constitution of the Republic , especially after its amendment in 1995 , does not include any territorial claims . 
 = = = Greek nationalism = = = 
 Danforth describes the Greek position on Macedonia as follows : because Alexander the Great and the ancient Macedonians were Greeks , and because ancient and modern Greece are bound in an unbroken line of racial and cultural continuity , it is only Greeks who have the right to identify themselves as Macedonians . According to Danforth , this is why Greeks generally refer to Ethnic Macedonians as " <unk> " , a practice comparable to calling Greeks " Athenians " . Danforth asserts that the negation of Macedonian identity in Greek nationalist ideology focuses on three main points : the existence of a Macedonian nation , a Macedonian language , and a Macedonian minority in Greece . More specifically , Danforth says : 
 From the Greek nationalist perspective there cannot be a Macedonian nation since there has never been an independent Macedonian state : the Macedonian nation is an " artificial creation " , an " invention " , of Tito , who " baptized " a " mosaic of nationalities " with the Greek name " Macedonians " . Similarly Greek nationalists claim that because the language spoken by the ancient Macedonians was Greek , the Slavic language spoken by the " <unk> " cannot be called " the Macedonian language . " Greek sources generally refer to it as " the linguistic idiom of Skopje " and describe it as a corrupt and impoverished dialect of Bulgarian . Finally , the Greek government denies the existence of a Macedonian minority in northern Greece , claiming that there exists only a small group of " <unk> Hellenes " or " bilingual Greeks " , who speak Greek and " a local Slavic dialect " but have a " Greek national consciousness " . 
 Thus from the Greek nationalist perspective the use of the term " Macedonian " by the " Slavs of Skopje " constitutes a " felony " , an " act of plagiarism " against the Greek people . Greek nationalists believe that , by calling themselves " Macedonians " , the ethnic Macedonians are " stealing " a Greek name , " embezzling " Greek cultural heritage , and " falsifying " Greek history . Greek fears that the use of the name " Macedonia " by the ethnic Macedonians will inevitably lead to the assertion of irredentist claims to territory in Greek Macedonia are heightened by fairly recent historical events . 
 From a different point of view , Demetrius Andreas <unk> <unk> , of Hughes Hall , Cambridge , a leading commentator on the naming dispute from the Greek side , sums up this nationalistic reaction as follows : the Republic of Macedonia was accused of usurping the historical and cultural patrimony of Greece " in order to furnish a nucleus of national self @-@ esteem for the new state and provide its citizens with a new , distinct , non @-@ Bulgarian , non @-@ Serbian , non @-@ Albanian identity " . The Republic emerged thus to Greek eyes as a country with a personality crisis , " a nondescript parasitic state " that lived off the history of its neighbours , because it allegedly lacked an illustrious past of its own , for the sake of achieving cohesion for what Greeks regarded as an " <unk> little new nation " . <unk> criticizes Greek stance as follows : 
 What appeared to go unquestioned in Greece nevertheless was whether there was indeed substance in the claims of FYROM that their citizens do feel members of a distinct ' Macedonian ' nationality . To answer this appropriately , neither the decades of persistent indoctrination [ during Tito 's time ] should be left out of consideration , nor Greece 's violent struggle since 1991 in contrast to her complacency for the 45 years before this . If it was a common bond that the people in Skopje wanted , they found it by claiming this name and rallying the whole population in a united resistance front under a common cause against pugnacious Greece . After this bitter and protracted struggle , even the ones in FYROM who might have not initially been infused with any distinct Macedonian ethnic identity must be feeling very Macedonian now , thanks to Greece 
 As of early 2008 , the official position of Greece , adopted unanimously by the four largest political parties , has made a more moderate shift towards accepting a " composite name solution " ( i.e. the use of the name " Macedonia " plus some qualifier ) , so as to disambiguate the former Yugoslav Republic from the Greek region of Macedonia and the wider geographic region of the same name .

 = = Terminology by group = = 
 All these controversies have led ethnic groups in Macedonia to use terms in conflicting ways . Despite the fact that these terms may not always be used in a pejorative way , they may be perceived as such by the ethnic group to which they are applied . Both Greeks and ethnic Macedonians generally use all terms deriving from Macedonia to describe their own regional or ethnic group , and have devised several other terms to disambiguate the other side , or the region in general . 
 Bulgarians and ethnic Macedonians seek to deny the self @-@ identification of the Slavic speaking minority in northern Greece , which mostly self @-@ identifies as Greek . Extremists on all sides have been known to fabricate and reproduce falsified information , along with denying genuine information and propagating unscientific and pseudoscientific theories . 
 Certain terms are in use by these groups as outlined below . Any denial of self @-@ identification by any side , or any attribution of Macedonia related terms by third parties to the other side , can be seen as highly offensive . General usage of these terms follows :

 <unk> ( <unk> ) is a derogatory term used to refer to the largest portion of the Slavic @-@ speaking minority of Macedonia in Greece who self @-@ identify as Greeks . 
 Macedonian ( <unk> ) is a person originating from the region of Macedonia – the term has only regional , not ethnic meaning , and it usually means a Bulgarian , or a clarification is made ( Greek , Albanian ... ) . 
 Macedonian ( <unk> ) and the Slavic dialects of Greece are considered dialects of Bulgarian by Bulgarian linguists ; not independent languages or dialects of other languages ( e.g. Serbian ) . This is also the popular view in Bulgaria . The Bulgarian government , therefore , has officially recognized the language merely as " the constitutional language of the Republic of Macedonia " . Translations are officially called " adaptations " . 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) is a term referring to the political ideology or simply views that the Slavs of Macedonia are an ethnic group separate from Bulgarians , with their own separate language , history and culture . It is also used to describe what Bulgarians view as the falsification of their history whether by Macedonian or foreign scholars who subscribe to the <unk> point of view . It carries strong negative connotations . 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) is a term , generally synonymous with disciplines such as study of the origins of the Macedonian language and history of the Macedonian people conducted in the Republic of Macedonia and in former Yugoslavia . It is generally considered in Bulgaria to be a kind of pseudoscience . 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) is a term for a person ( typically Macedonian Slav ) who believes that Macedonian Slavs are not ethnic Bulgarians but a separate ethnic group , directly descended from the ancient Macedonians . It is a more negatively charged synonym of " Macedonian nationalist " . More rarely it is used for someone associated with the study of the origins of the Macedonian language and history of the Macedonian people ( not necessarily from the Republic of Macedonia or Yugoslavia ) , whose studies support the official historical doctrine of the Republic of Macedonia or former Yugoslavia . 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) is a derogatory term used to refer to people in the Republic of Macedonia self @-@ identifying as Serbian , or having a pro @-@ Serb orientation . It is also used pejoratively by Bulgarians to refer to Macedonians who refuse the Bulgarian national idea . 
 Old Bulgarian ( <unk> ) is the name Bulgarians give to the Old Church Slavonic language used in the Ohrid Literary School among others . In contrast , Old Church Slavonic is rarely referred to by ethnic Macedonians as " Old Macedonian " or " Old Slavic " .

 = Battle of Šibenik = 
 The Battle of Šibenik ( Croatian : Bitka za Šibenik ) , also known as the September War ( Rujanski rat ) , was an armed conflict fought between the Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) , supported by the Croatian Serb @-@ established Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina ( SAO Krajina ) , and the Croatian National Guard ( Zbor Narodne Garde – ZNG ) , supported by the Croatian Police . The battle was fought to the north and west of the city of Šibenik , Croatia on 16 – 22 September 1991 , during the Croatian War of Independence . The JNA 's initial orders were to relieve Croatian siege of their barracks in the city and isolate the region of Dalmatia from the rest of Croatia . The JNA 's advance was supported by the Yugoslav Air Force and the Yugoslav Navy . 
 Fighting stopped following a Croatian counter @-@ attack that pushed the JNA back from the outskirts of Šibenik . Although some ground was lost to the Yugoslavs , especially around the town of Drniš , northeast of Šibenik , the ZNG captured several JNA and Yugoslav Navy facilities in the city , including dozens of navy vessels and several coastal artillery batteries . The captured batteries were used to support defence of the city . The JNA Šibenik garrison was evacuated following an agreement between the Croatian officials and the JNA , except for several comparably small JNA posts in the city which were captured by the ZNG . 
 The September – October fighting caused three Croatian military and seven civilian deaths , as well as more than a hundred wounded . JNA bombarded Šibenik , causing damage to numerous structures , including the Cathedral of St. James , a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The New York Times judged the bombardment to be a part of calculated assaults on the heritage of Croatia . Artillery bombardment of the city continued over the following 100 days . The battle is commemorated in Šibenik each year . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1990 , following the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia , ethnic tensions worsened . The Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) confiscated Croatia 's Territorial Defence weapons to minimize resistance . On 17 August , tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs , centred on the predominantly Serb @-@ populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin , parts of the Lika , Kordun , Banovina and eastern Croatia , largely fueled by recollections of the Serbs of the genocide to which they had been subjected in the Independent State of Croatia during World War II , and their resultant unwillingness to be minorities in an independent Croatia . 
 After two unsuccessful attempts by Serbia , supported by Montenegro and Serbia 's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo , to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency 's approval of a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces in January 1991 , and a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March , the JNA itself , supported by Serbia and its allies , asked the federal Presidency to give it wartime authorities and declare a state of emergency . The request was denied on 15 March , and the JNA came under control of Serbian President Slobodan Milošević . Milošević , preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than preservation of Yugoslavia , publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency . The threat caused the JNA to gradually abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of expansion of Serbia . By the end of the month , the conflict had escalated to the first fatalities . The JNA stepped in , supporting the insurgents , and preventing Croatian police from intervening . In early April , leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention of integration of the area under their control , viewed by the Government of Croatia as a breakaway region with Serbia . 
 In the beginning of 1991 , Croatia had no regular army . In an effort to bolster its defence , Croatia doubled police personnel to about 20 @,@ 000 . The most effective part of the force was 3 @,@ 000 special police , deployed in twelve battalions adopting military unit organization . In addition , there were 9 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 regionally organized reserve police . The reserve police were set up in 16 battalions and 10 companies , but the reserve force lacked weapons . In May , the Croatian government responded by forming the Croatian National Guard ( Zbor narodne garde ) , but its development was hampered by a United Nations arms embargo introduced in September 1991 .

 By late June and throughout July , northern Dalmatia saw daily armed skirmishes but no actual combat . Nonetheless , the increasing intensity of the conflict in the region and elsewhere in Croatia led to the preparation of bomb shelters in Zadar by city officials . Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina ( SAO Krajina ) authorities called up three Territorial Defence units in the Zadar hinterland on 11 July , one day after another fatal shooting of a Croatian police patrol in the Zadar area , while the JNA 9th ( Knin ) Corps conscripted the local Serb population in Benkovac to strengthen its ranks by the end of the month . In late July , a paramilitary group , led by Miro <unk> and formally subordinated to the Croatian Ministry of Defence , conducted several sabotages in the Benkovac area . On 1 August , Croatia deployed two battalions of the ZNG 4th Guards Brigade to Kruševo near Obrovac . Two days later they engaged in combat against the SAO Krajina Territorial Defence and police forces , marking the first such engagement of the Croatian War of Independence in the region . On 26 August , the JNA 9th ( Knin ) Corps openly sided with the SAO Krajina forces as they jointly attacked Kijevo , expelling all Croats from the village . Another significant setback for Croatia in the region was JNA capture of the Maslenica Bridge on 11 September . That severed the last overland road link between Dalmatia and the rest of Croatia . On 11 – 13 September , an attack in the area of <unk> cut water and power supply to Šibenik . 
 On 14 September , the ZNG and the Croatian police blockaded and cut utilities to all JNA facilities located in Croatian @-@ controlled territory , beginning the Battle of the Barracks . The move blockaded 33 large JNA garrisons in Croatia and numerous smaller facilities , including border posts , weapons and ammunition storage depots . The blockade forced the JNA to amend its planned campaign in Croatia to accommodate the new development . The same day , a coastal artillery battery on the Žirje Island was captured by Croatian forces , after JNA Senior Sergeant Željko <unk> , battery commanding officer , switched his allegiance . The battery consisted of twelve Ansaldo 90 / 53 guns which were once armament of the Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto . 
 = = Order of battle = = 
 The JNA 's planned campaign included an advance in the Šibenik area by the 9th ( Knin ) Corps , which was tasked with isolating Dalmatia from the rest of Croatia . As it was fully mobilised and prepared for deployment , the corps began operations against the ZNG on 16 September . Its main axis of attack was directed at Vodice , with supporting advances towards Zadar , Drniš and Sinj . The push was designed to create favourable circumstances to attack Zadar , Šibenik and Split . With support from a corps @-@ level battalion of M @-@ 84 tanks and the SAO Krajina Territorial Defence , the JNA 221st Mechanised Brigade ( without its battalion of T @-@ 34 tanks ) , was committed to the main axis of the attack . The secondary advance , towards Biograd na Moru on the right flank , was assigned to the 180th Mechanised Brigade , supported by the armoured battalion removed from the 221st Brigade , the 557th Mixed Antitank Artillery Regiment and the SAO Krajina Territorial Defence . Offensive support was provided by the 9th Mixed Artillery Regiment and the 9th Military Police Battalion . The 221st Brigade was commanded by Colonel Borislav <unk> . Elements the 46th Partisan Division , drawn from the 24th ( Kragujevac ) Corps , also <unk> support for the corps . The JNA garrison in Šibenik barracks included the 11th Marine Infantry Brigade — one of a handful of units regularly maintained at full combat readiness . 
 In opposition to the JNA , the ZNG 113th Infantry Brigade , commanded by Milivoj Petković , defended the city of Šibenik together with police forces , under overall control of the Šibenik crisis centre headed by Josip <unk> . The 4th Battalion of the 113th Infantry Brigade , commanded by Josip <unk> , as well as the 4th Battalion of the 4th Guards Brigade , commanded by Ivan <unk> , defended the Drniš area , 25 kilometres ( 16 miles ) northeast of Šibenik , supported by a company of police . The 600 @-@ strong 4th Battalion of the 4th Guards Brigade represented the strongest ZNG unit in the area , while the JNA is estimated by Croatian sources to have deployed approximately 1 @,@ 500 troops against Drniš . On 20 September , all Croatian combat troops in Drniš area were subordinated to Luka Vujić . The western bank of the Krka River and approaches to Vodice were controlled by the 3rd Battalion of the 113th Infantry Brigade . While small arms were sufficient to arm a part of the battalion at a time , the battalion did not have any heavy weapons .

 The offensive commenced at 16 : 00 on 16 September . On the left flank , the JNA advanced towards Drniš , capturing the villages of <unk> and <unk> , and interdicting the Drniš – Split , east of the Krka River . On the opposite river bank , the JNA advanced towards Vodice and Šibenik , threatening the city from the west , reaching the western side of the 390 @-@ metre ( 1 @,@ 280 ft ) Šibenik Bridge on the Adriatic Highway . The advance was so rapid it cut off the 1st Company of the 3rd Battalion of the ZNG 113th Infantry Brigade from the rest of the ZNG force . That day , the ZNG captured a 100 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) coastal artillery battery near village of Zečevo . By 17 September , the commanding officer of the JNA 9th ( Knin ) Corps , Major General Vladimir Vuković , modified the initial deployment plan , because of strong resistance offered by the ZNG and the Croatian police , relying on populated areas and terrain features to hold back the JNA forces north of Vodice . The changes involved diverting a part of the force to attack Drniš and Sinj directly , while the remainder of the attacking force rested . The Yugoslav Navy started a blockade of Šibenik and the entire Croatian Adriatic coast . 
 On the night of 17 / 18 September , the JNA was ordered to trap and destroy the ZNG force in Drniš and the Miljevci Plateau area , while holding positions achieved elsewhere . In the morning , the JNA resumed its offensive towards Vodice , on the right flank of the attack , while the ZNG abandoned Drniš and pulled back to village of <unk> . On 19 September , the ZNG captured a 88 @-@ millimetre ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) JNA coastal artillery battery on the Smokvica Island and the " <unk> " barracks near Rogoznica . Weapons retrieved from the captured barracks , a shipment received from Gospić following capture of JNA facilities in the town , as well as use of the captured artillery pieces , significantly improved ZNG 's capabilities . The JNA advance south from Drniš was effectively halted that day , following three successful ambush attacks by the ZNG in <unk> , <unk> Selo and south of Žitnić . 
 The JNA orders were changed again on 20 September , when the JNA 9th ( Knin ) Corps orders were supplanted by the Military @-@ Maritime District order , issued by Vice Admiral Mile <unk> , for the corps to reorient the JNA force north of Vodice towards Šibenik and Split . This required crossing the Šibenik Bridge spanning the Krka River ria . The eastward advance — with close air support from the Yugoslav Air Force — failed , and cost the air force four aircraft shot down by the ZNG . On 22 September , a Croatian counter @-@ attack , supported by recently acquired artillery , pushed back the JNA from the bridge by 10 : 00 , extending the ZNG @-@ controlled bridgehead to the area of <unk> , 9 kilometres ( 5 @.@ 6 miles ) to the northwest . Four guns of the Žirje battery were used as anti @-@ tank guns in support of the counter @-@ attack . 
 On 22 September , the Croatian forces captured the JNA " Kuline " barracks in Šibenik itself along with the 15 Yugoslav Navy vessels based there . In addition , 19 vessels undergoing various stages of overhaul were captured in the " Velimir Škorpik " shipyard . The ships , comprising approximately a quarter of the Yugoslav Naval assets , included : Vlado Ćetković ( RTOP @-@ 402 ) Končar @-@ class fast attack craft ( renamed Šibenik ( RTOP @-@ 21 ) later on ) , Velimir Škorpik ( RČ @-@ 310 ) Osa @-@ class missile boat , Partizan II ( TČ @-@ 222 ) Shershen @-@ class torpedo boat and Biokovo ( PČ @-@ 171 ) , Cer ( PČ @-@ 180 ) and Durmitor ( PČ @-@ 181 ) Mirna @-@ class patrol boats . 
 On 23 September , the JNA fully secured Drniš and its surroundings . At the same time , it shifted its focus to the Battle of Zadar , away from Šibenik . The Yugoslav naval blockade was lifted unilaterally the same day . Even though a number of JNA facilities in the city were captured by the ZNG , several major JNA posts remained in Šibenik . Those included " Rade Končar " barracks housing the 11th Marine Infantry Brigade , " Ante Jonić " barracks , " <unk> " depot where naval mines were stored , " <unk> " depot and the " <unk> " artillery battery containing confiscated Croatian Territorial Defence weapons and " <unk> " fuel storage . The " <unk> " depot consisted of three 1 @,@ 410 @,@ 000 @-@ litre ( 310 @,@ 000 imp gal ; 370 @,@ 000 US gal ) storage tanks . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The JNA was defeated in the battle , subsequently nicknamed the " September War " ( Rujanski rat ) . Its total losses in the battle were not reported . The ZNG and the Croatian police sustained losses of three killed and 49 wounded troops in the battle . At the same time seven civilians were killed and 64 wounded . JNA artillery continued intermittent bombardment of Šibenik over the following 100 days resulting in further casualties and damage . The damaged structures included the Cathedral of St. James , a UNESCO World Heritage Site . An editorial in The New York Times labeled bombardment of the cathedral as a part of the " calculated assaults " on treasures of Croatia . During the fighting , electrical substations in <unk> and <unk> were destroyed , disrupting electric power distribution in Dalmatia . 
 Evacuation of the JNA facilities and surrender of the confiscated Territorial Defence weapons stored in the Šibenik – Split area was agreed on 21 November . Throughout the process , tensions remained high , and the JNA made contingency plans to break through from Knin to Šibenik and Split to relieve the siege of its forces there — codenamed Operation Coast @-@ 91 ( Operacija <unk> @-@ 91 ) and Operation Hurricane @-@ 91 ( Operacija Orkan @-@ 91 ) respectively . All of the JNA facilities in Šibenik , along with the confiscated Territorial Defence weapons , were handed over to the Croatian authorities by 10 December . 
 News coverage of the battle produced television footage of ZNG air defence artillery at Zečevo firing at a Yugoslav Air Force Soko J @-@ 21 Jastreb and scoring a hit on another J @-@ 21 using a guided missile . The footage , ending in shouts claiming that both of the planes were downed , became one of the most significant pieces of material in terms of propaganda and morale in Croatia . Nonetheless , the footage proved controversial , since the first plane is not shown falling to the ground or into the sea , but diving towards the horizon after giving away a puff of smoke — variously interpreted as smoke caused by the plane 's cannon fire or anti @-@ aircraft fire damage . While the first J @-@ 21 downing remains unconfirmed , the second J @-@ 21 , piloted by Croat Valter <unk> of the 240th Fighter @-@ Bomber Aviation Squadron , was shot down by Neven <unk> using a <unk> Igla and wreckage of the plane was retrieved . 
 Another controversy which arose in the aftermath of the battle pertains to the Žirje Island coastal artillery battery . Extent of the role played by the battery was disputed between Brigadier General Rahim Ademi , who claimed the bridge was beyond range of the guns , and thirteen ZNG and police officers , who held various posts in Šibenik at the time , who claimed Ademi was wrong in his assessment . After the war , the guns were removed from Žirje . As of 2010 two were refurbished in preparation for return to Žirje , as museum exhibits . 
 The battle is commemorated annually in Šibenik each September . There are two documentary films covering Šibenik and its surroundings during the battle : My city will be happy too ( I <unk> <unk> grad <unk> <unk> ) by <unk> Šarić and September War 1991 , Šibenik – Vodice ( Rujanski rat 1991 . Šibenik – Vodice ) by Šime <unk> . 
 = Italian Heavy Draft = 
 The Italian Heavy Draft , or Rapid Heavy Draft , is a breed of draft horse from Italy . The full Italian name of the breed is Cavallo <unk> Italiano da Tiro Pesante Rapido , " Italian Rapid Heavy Draft Farm Horse " , and the abbreviation TPR ( Italian pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) ) is often used . 
 Generally chestnut in color , the breed is known for its combination of strength and speed . Its development traces to 1860 and continued through the late 19th and early 20th centuries as breeders utilized a mix of foundation bloodstock that included native Italian stock and imported horses , all mainly of draft type . Its versatility has led to its use in both agricultural and military capacities , as well as for the production of mules . In 1926 , a stud book was formed , and population numbers continued to rise until the beginning of World War II . Breeding programs suffered during the war , and despite care afterward , population numbers continued to dwindle as increasing mechanization decreased the need for draft horses . In the 1970s , selective breeding goals were changed to produce a horse suitable for meat production , which today remains the primary use of the Italian Heavy Draft . 
 = = Breed characteristics = = 
 The Italian Heavy Draft generally stands between 14 @.@ 2 and 15 @.@ 3 hands ( 58 and 63 inches , 147 and 160 cm ) high , and weighs between 1 @,@ 320 and 1 @,@ 540 pounds ( 600 and 700 kg ) . They are generally chestnut ( usually with flaxen mane and tail ) , although they may be red roan , or bay . The head is light for a draft breed , with a straight or slightly convex profile , and it is set on a short , broad and muscular neck . The withers are fairly pronounced and muscular , the chest broad and deep , and the shoulders sloping . The back is straight and short , the flanks short and rounded , with a sloping croup . The legs are short , with broad joints and smallish , though well @-@ formed , hooves . It closely resembles the Breton breed , which was used heavily in the creation of the Italian Heavy Draft . Although larger , it also bears a resemblance to the Haflinger , also developed in northern Italy . Horses that meet the breed conformation standards set by the breed registry are branded with a design of a ladder with five pegs enclosed by a shield . Foals are examined twice , at between two and seven months and again two and a half years . Horses passing the first evaluation are branded on the left hindquarter ; those that pass the second are marked again on the left side of the neck . 
 = = History = = 
 Selection for what eventually became the Italian Heavy Draft was begun in 1860 at the <unk> Cavalli <unk> ( military stud ) of Ferrara , Italy . The breed was originally developed by crossing native stock with large Brabant horses . While the resulting horses were strong , they were not light or fast enough for the farm work required of them by the Italians . To make the breed lighter and faster , Percheron and Boulonnais blood were added . However , the resulting horse was still not exactly what its creators were looking for , and in the 19th century they added more Breton blood to the mix , bringing the breed to its current conformation and gaits . In 1926 , a stud book was begun , and selection processes were developed to select horses for use in draft capacities . The breeding programs suffered during World War II , but a careful crossbreeding program with Ardennes , Percheron and Breton horses after the war brought the Italian Heavy Draft to its current state . 
 Despite the Italian Heavy Draft 's early popularity as a strong but fast draft horse , increasing mechanization in the farming and military sectors reduced the need for all draft horses , and population numbers declined . In the 1970s , selection processes were changed to focus on the production of animals for horse meat , and that has continued to be the primary focus through the present time . In 1976 , a breed association was formed in Italy to preserve and promote the Italian Heavy Draft . The association is charged with maintaining the stud book , evaluating breeding stock , granting equine passports , maintaining genetic databases , and exhibiting the breed . The main breeding areas for the Italian Heavy Draft are in the plains and hills around Verona , Padova , Vicenza , Venice , Treviso and Udine . In 2005 , it was estimated that there were just under 6 @,@ 500 Italian Heavy Drafts , about half of which were mares . The registered population at the end of 2010 was <unk> , with the largest numbers in Lazio and Umbria ; the number of unregistered Heavy Drafts is not reported . 
 No modern trace remains of the slower Italian Slow Heavy Draft Horse , the Cavallo Italiano da Tiro Pesante Lento , subject of a biometric and morphological study in 1939 . 
 = = Uses = = 
 The Italian Heavy Draft was originally bred to be a versatile horse used in agriculture , urban settings , and military capacities , as well as for the production of large mules for the military . The breed 's docility , size , strength , and speed made it extremely useful for Italian farmers before the introduction of mechanization . It is still used for farming in a few areas where mechanization is impractical . The mares are also still used for the production of mules , although most horses today are bred for meat . Italy is one of the top global consumers of horse meat ; consumption jumped by 31 percent between 2001 and 2006 . <unk> to eighteen @-@ month @-@ old foals are preferred for slaughter . 
 = Matthew Charlton = 
 Matthew Charlton ( 15 March 1866 – 8 December 1948 ) was an Australian Labor Party politician . 
 Charlton was born at Linton in rural Victoria but moved to Lambton , New South Wales at the age of five . He worked as a coal miner after only a primary education and then married Martha Rollings in 1889 . Charlton had an interest in politics from his early middle age , and joined union strikes against wage reductions in 1896 . 
 After a two @-@ year stint in Kalgoorlie , Western Australia , Charlton returned to Lambton and rejoined the local colliery workers ' union , becoming its treasurer in 1901 . He won a by @-@ election for the NSW seat of Waratah in 1903 and transferred to Northumberland in 1904 . 
 In 1910 Charlton won the seat of Hunter and rose through the ranks of Andrew Fisher 's government , then staying with the Australian Labor Party during its period in opposition . Charlton rose through the ranks to become party leader in 1922 . He lost his first election campaign , partly because he was hospitalised with illness during its course . In 1924 Charlton was invited to a meeting of the League of Nations ( now United Nations ) but was unsuccessful in getting Australia to adopt the Geneva Protocol , established during the meeting . 
 Due to union strikes in 1925 , Charlton and his party lost the election held that year and he resigned in 1928 . He died on 8 December 1948 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Little is recorded about Charlton 's early life , as he grew up in a relatively unknown mining district . It is known , however , that Charlton was born on 15 March 1866 in Linton , Victoria , a small town near Ballarat that today has less than 500 residents . He was born to Matthew Charlton , an English miner from Durham , and Mabel ( née Foard ) . In 1871 , the five @-@ year @-@ old Charlton 's father moved with his family to Lambton , a suburb of Newcastle , New South Wales . After primary education at Lambton Public School , Charlton began work at Lambton Colliery as a coal trapper ; a children 's @-@ only job opening trapdoors for coal carts . When too old for the job , Charlton was given a job at the coal @-@ face . At 23 he married Martha Rollings at nearby New Lambton . 
 = = Emerging interest in politics = = 
 In 1896 plans to reduce coal workers ' wages led to strike action . Charlton supported the struggle against wage reductions , but the effort failed and , along with many other miners , he moved to the goldfields near Kalgoorlie , Western Australia . After two years there , Charlton returned to Lambton and became an official in the Colliery Employees ' Federation , becoming treasurer in 1901 . While occupying that position , Charlton also prepared arbitration cases . Battling for an improvement in mine workers ' conditions , he attended a trade union congress in November 1902 , at which he moved for nationalisation of the coal mining industry , believing it would " eliminate cut @-@ throat competition between owners that depressed miners ' wages and conditions " . That idea was opposed as being too radical but a compromise was drawn up urging state governments to open and run their own coal mines , while affirming the ultimate desirability of full nationalisation . 
 = = State political career = = 
 Colleagues urged Charlton to stand for the state electoral district of Waratah , and on 5 December 1903 Charlton became the second member for the district in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly . His representation of that district was short @-@ lived , as the next year he transferred to Northumberland , replacing John Norton . Charlton became the unofficial spokesperson for the miners , speaking principally about mining matters in parliament . In 1909 a coal miners ' strike struck New South Wales and Charlton was called upon by the Colliery Employees ' Federation to represent it in front of a wage board . Charlton was unsuccessful in gaining better conditions for the miners but he did settle the dispute , talking to miners around the state and convincing them to return to work . He resigned from state politics and in 1910 Charlton wrested the federal Division of Hunter from the sitting Frank <unk> has remained a safe Labor seat ever since . 
 = = Early federal career = = 
 Charlton was an immediate success with Andrew Fisher and was promoted to the temporary chairmanship of committees in the House in 1913 , however Charlton threatened to resign in 1915 over a dispute in government delays in granting the committee increased powers . Fisher mollified him and in 1916 Charlton proved his loyalty to the new Labor leader Billy Hughes by voting for Hughes ' conscription referendum bill , even though he was vehemently opposed to conscription and fought hard against it . However , Charlton seemed to accept the affirmative result of the referendum and again proved his loyalty to Hughes by defending him when he became the target of caucus criticism . Charlton attempted to deflect attacks made on Hughes to a party conference , but Hughes left the party before a decision could be made . 
 The new Labor leader Frank Tudor was a weak leader in health and political prowess . A successor @-@ designate was chosen by the caucus but it was not Charlton . T. J. Ryan was chosen over him , but he died in 1921 and Charlton filled the deputy leadership position . During election year , 1922 , Tudor died also , and Charlton became Leader of the Opposition going into the 1922 election . 
 = = Leader of the Opposition = = 
 Charlton offered alternative policies and looked to be favourite until he was hospitalised with illness halfway through the campaign . Labor still won the most seats as a single party , but Charlton was unable to defeat a strong government coalition . Labor remained in opposition . 
 Because of great losses during World War I , Charlton opposed military training and commitments of Australian forces . In 1924 Charlton was invited to a League of Nations ( now United Nations ) conference in Geneva , Switzerland . At the conference Charlton strongly opposed war , and the Geneva Protocol took form . Upon his return to Australia , Charlton advocated adoption of the protocol , but the government sided with the British and refused to observe it . 
 Charlton lost the 1925 election , largely due to his stance on industrial relations and continual militant union action which plagued his campaign . Charlton always aided in maintaining amicable relations in the party and many times lent his expertise to conflicts within the NSW branch of the Labor Party . He resigned from his positions on 29 March 1928 . His successor James Scullin went on to become the Prime Minister of Australia , something Charlton never managed to do . 
 = = Final years = = 
 Following his six years of service as Labor leader , Charlton took an interest in local government and became an alderman on the Lambton Council from 1934 to 1938 ( before its merger with the City of Newcastle ) . On 8 December 1948 Charlton died at Lambton , New South Wales , where he grew up and had lived most of his life . 
 The Division of Charlton in the Hunter Region was named in his honour and had been a safe Labor seat since its creation in 1984 until its abolition in 2016 . 
 = Italian battleship Andrea Doria = 
 Andrea Doria was the lead ship of her class of battleships built by the Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) . The class included only one sister ship , Caio Duilio . Andrea Doria was named after the 16th century Genoese admiral of the same name . Laid down in March 1912 , the battleship was launched a year later in March 1913 , and completed in March 1916 . She was armed with a main battery of thirteen 305 mm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) guns and had a top speed of 21 kn ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) . 
 Andrea Doria saw no major action in World War I , and served extensively in Mediterranean in the 1920s and 1930s . She was involved in the suppression of rebels in Fiume and the Corfu incident in the 1920s . Starting in 1937 , Andrea Doria underwent an extensive modernization , which lasted until 1940 . She saw relatively little action during World War II ; she was tasked with escorting convoys to Libya throughout 1941 and into 1942 , during which she engaged in the inconclusive First Battle of Sirte . After the Armistice in September 1943 the ship was sailed to Malta and interned by the Allies . She remained there until 1944 , when she was permitted to return to Italian ports . Andrea Doria survived the war and soldiered on in the post @-@ war navy as a training ship until 1956 . Paid off in September , she was formally stricken from the naval register on 1 November and sold for scrapping later that year . 
 = = Design = = 
 Andrea Doria was 176 meters ( 577 ft ) long overall ; she had a beam of 28 m ( 92 ft ) and a draft of 9 @.@ 4 m ( 31 ft ) . At full combat load , she displaced up to 24 @,@ 729 metric tons ( 24 @,@ 338 long tons ; 27 @,@ 259 short tons ) . She had a crew of 35 officers and 1 @,@ 198 enlisted men . She was powered by four Parsons steam turbines , with steam provided by eight oil @-@ fired and twelve coal and oil @-@ burning Yarrow boilers . The boilers were trunked into two large funnels . The engines were rated at 30 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 22 @,@ 000 kW ) , which provided a top speed of 21 knots ( 39 km / h ; 24 mph ) . She had a cruising radius of 4 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 900 km ; 5 @,@ 500 mi ) at 10 kn ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The ship was armed with a main battery of thirteen 305 mm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) 46 @-@ caliber guns in three triple turrets and two twin turrets . The secondary battery comprised sixteen 152 mm ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) 45 @-@ caliber guns , all mounted in casemates clustered around the forward and aft main battery turrets . Andrea Doria was also armed with thirteen 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) 50 @-@ caliber guns and six 76 @-@ mm anti @-@ aircraft guns . As was customary for capital ships of the period , she was equipped with three submerged 450 mm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes . She was protected with Krupp cemented steel manufactured by Terni . The belt armor was 254 mm ( 10 @.@ 0 in ) thick and the main deck was 98 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick . The conning tower and main battery turrets were protected with 280 mm ( 11 in ) worth of armor plating . 
 = = = Modifications = = = 
 Andrea Doria was heavily rebuilt in 1937 – 1940 at Trieste . Her forecastle deck was extended further aft , until it reached the mainmast . The stern and bow were rebuilt , increasing the length of the ship to 186 @.@ 9 m ( 613 ft ) , and the displacement grew to 28 @,@ 882 t ( 28 @,@ 426 long tons ; 31 @,@ 837 short tons ) . Her old machinery was replaced with more efficient equipment and her twenty boilers were replaced with eight oil @-@ fired models ; the new power plant was rated at 75 @,@ 000 shp ( 56 @,@ 000 kW ) and speed increased to 26 kn ( 48 km / h ; 30 mph ) . The ship 's amidships turret was removed and the remaining guns were bored out to 320 mm ( 13 in ) . Her secondary battery was completely overhauled ; the 152 mm guns were replaced with twelve 135 mm ( 5 @.@ 3 in ) guns in triple turrets amidships . The anti @-@ aircraft battery was significantly improved , to include ten 90 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) guns , fifteen 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns , and sixteen 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) guns . Later , during World War II , four more 37 mm guns were installed and two of the 20 mm guns were removed . After emerging from the modernization , Andrea Doria 's crew numbered 35 officers and 1 @,@ 450 enlisted men . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Andrea Doria , named for the 16th century Genoese admiral of the same name , was laid down at the La Spezia shipyard in Naples on 24 March 1912 . She was launched on 30 March 1913 and completed by 13 March 1916 . The Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , which had been Italy 's primary rival for decades , was the primary opponent in the conflict . The Austro @-@ Hungarian battle fleet lay in its harbors directly across the narrow Adriatic Sea and did not emerge for the duration of the conflict . In addition , Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel , the Italian naval chief of staff , believed that Austro @-@ Hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic . The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way . Instead , Revel decided to implement blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet , while smaller vessels , such as the MAS boats , conducted raids on Austro @-@ Hungarian ships and installations . Meanwhile , Revel 's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro @-@ Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement . 
 Starting in November 1918 , Andrea Doria was based in Taranto . On 10 November , she was sent to Corfu , where she remained until 19 February 1919 . She then returned to Taranto , before proceeding to Constantinople in July , departing on the 4th and arriving on the 9th of the month . She joined an Allied fleet in the city and remained there until 9 November , when she returned again to Taranto . In 1920 , most of the Italian fleet was temporarily demobilized to provide crews to bring ex @-@ German warships that had been awarded to Italy under the Treaty of Versailles ; Andrea Doria was the only battleship to remain operational during the period . In November , the Treaty of Rapallo was signed with the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes . Andrea Doria was sent to remove the rebellious forces of Gabriele d 'Annunzio from Fiume that month . On 24 December , she joined the attack on Fiume , and two days later fired three salvos from her 76 mm guns at the destroyer Espero , which had rebelled and joined d 'Annunzio . Andrea Doria 's gunfire badly damaged Espero . Andrea Doria also shelled d 'Annunzio 's headquarters and wounded him ; he surrendered on 31 December . 
 During the 1923 Corfu incident with Greece , the Italian Navy , including Andrea Doria , was deployed to the island to secure a Greek apology following the murder of Enrico Tellini and four others . Following the peaceful resolution of the incident , Andrea Doria visited Spain . On 16 January 1925 , Andrea Doria visited Lisbon to participate in the 400th anniversary of the death of Vasco de Gama . She thereafter went to La Spezia for a refit , which began on 7 February and was completed by June . Following civil unrest in Syria , Andrea Doria steamed to the eastern Mediterranean with a squadron of destroyers in the event that Italian nationals would need to be evacuated . The ships remained docked in Leros until 12 December , by which time the disturbances in Syria had been calmed down . She spent the next six years on normal peacetime duties , until she was withdrawn from service in August 1932 . She was placed in reserve in Taranto , with a skeleton crew for maintenance . In March 1937 , she started the major reconstruction in Trieste , where she arrived on the 30th . The refit began on 8 April at the Cantieri Riuniti dell 'Adriatico shipyard .

 Andrea Doria was still out of service in 1939 when the Second World War broke out in Europe . Work was finished by October 1940 , and on the 26th of the month , she rejoined the Italian fleet in the 5th Division in Taranto . She was undamaged by the British attack on Taranto on the night of 11 – 12 November , and was sent to Naples on the 12th . In early December , the Italian Navy reorganized the fleet ; Andrea Doria remained in the 5th Division , along with the battleship Giulio Cesare . She undertook her first operation in early January with the new battleship Vittorio Veneto in response to Operation Excess , a complex series of British convoys to Malta . The Italian battleships were unable to locate any British forces , and so returned to port by 11 January . On 8 February , Andrea Doria sortied again , along with Vittorio Veneto and Giulio Cesare , in response to reports of a British fleet in the area . They were steaming off Sardinia when they received word that the British had bombarded Genoa ; they immediately turned north to intercept them , but heavy fog allowed the British to escape . 
 In December 1941 , Andrea Doria formed part of the escort during Operation M41 , a major convoy from Italy to Benghazi in Libya on the 13th . M42 followed on 17 – 19 December , where Andrea Doria saw action against British cruisers and destroyers in the First Battle of Sirte . Late on the 17th , the Italian fleet , commanded by Admiral Angelo Iachino , engaged the British light forces . Both sides acted hesitantly , however , and no decisive engagement resulted . Operation M43 followed on 3 January 1942 ; Andrea Doria again provided escort for the three convoys to Libya . While on the operation , Andrea Doria suffered mechanical problems and had to return to port early . She remained inactive for the remainder of the year , and indeed until the Armistice in September 1943 that removed Italy from the war , owing to severe fuel shortages in the Italian Navy . On 9 September 1943 , Andrea Doria left Italy , bound for internment in Malta , where she remained until 8 June 1944 . She was then released to return to Sicily , and eventually returned to Taranto on 14 March 1945 . After the war ended in May 1945 , Andrea Doria went to Syracuse , where she remained until 13 December 1949 . She was then made flagship of the Italian fleet , a role she performed until 9 December 1950 . She held the position again from 9 March 1951 to May 1953 , after which time she was used as a gunnery training ship . She was paid off on 16 September 1956 , after serving in the Italian Navy for over 40 years . She was formally stricken from the naval register on 1 November and subsequently broken up for scrap in La Spezia .

Behemoth was the tallest and fastest roller coaster in Canada until 2012 when Leviathan , a roller coaster also manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard , was built at the opposite side of Canada 's Wonderland , claiming these titles . Behemoth is similar to Diamondback ( Kings Island ) , Goliath ( La Ronde ) and Nitro ( Six Flags Great Adventure ) . 
 After a year and a half of preparation and development , Behemoth premiered in May 2008 . With its high speeds , tall heights and rapid changes in both direction and elevation , the attraction is one of the most aggressive thrill rides in the park . Behemoth also has a high hourly passenger throughput – making it one of the most efficient rides in the park . 
 The ride features a prototype seating arrangement to ensure an unobstructed view for every rider – a first for a roller coaster of this type . The Behemoth experience lasts for approximately three minutes and subjects the rider to a maximum speed of 124 km / h ( 77 mph ) achieved in less than 3 @.@ 9 seconds followed by five air @-@ time hills , a hammerhead turn and two helixes .

 = Marian Breland Bailey = 
 Marian Breland Bailey , born Marian Ruth Kruse ( December 2 , 1920 – September 25 , 2001 ) and nicknamed " Mouse " , was an American psychologist , an applied behavior analyst who played a major role in developing empirically validated and humane animal training methods and in promoting their widespread implementation . She and her first husband , Keller Breland ( 1915 – 1965 ) , studied at the University of Minnesota under behaviorist B. F. Skinner and became " the first applied animal psychologists . " 
 = = Childhood and education = = 
 Born to Christian and Harriet ( Prime ) Kruse , Marian Ruth Kruse grew up in Minneapolis , Minnesota . German @-@ born Christian worked for an automotive supply store , and Harriet was a registered nurse . Marian 's father and then others called her " Maus " ( " mouse " ) , a common German nickname for little girls . After graduating from Washburn High School as her senior class 's valedictorian , Marian Kruse went to the University of Minnesota to major in Latin and minor in Greek . Although financial times were difficult as her family had lost everything during the banking collapse of the Great Depression , a full scholarship and a Works Progress Administration award for writers supported her undergraduate education . Before long , she also became a research assistant for B. F. ( Fred ) Skinner . 
 To meet a science requirement , Marian took psychology because , as she later explained , " I thought it the least painful science . " As a straight A student , she was recommended for a highly selective psychology class taught by Skinner ( the first of what Skinner later called " pro @-@ seminars " ) , under whom she studied along with George Collier , W. K. Estes , Norman Guttman , Kenneth <unk> , Paul Everett <unk> , and others bound for later fame in their field . With its emphasis on Skinner 's new operant training techniques , the course inspired Marian to major in psychology with a minor in child psychology and to study operant conditioning . 
 Marian worked as Skinner 's teaching and laboratory assistant when he published his pivotal work The Behavior of Organisms in 1938 . She trained rats for Skinner , typed lecture notes for him , proofread his classic text The Behavior of Organisms , and even babysat his children . Skinner gave her the final galley proof of The Behavior of Organisms , which she considered a prized possession . While still an undergraduate student , Marian met her future husband Keller Breland , who came to call her " Mouse " without knowing that family called her " Maus " . Marian and others soon decided that her name was Mouse . 
 In 1940 , Marian joined Psi Chi , the national honor society in psychology . She graduated with her bachelor of arts degree summa cum laude in 1941 , the only member of her graduating class with an A average . 
 = = Work with Keller Breland = = 
 After Marian earned her bachelor 's degree , she married psychologist Keller Breland on August 1 , 1941 . Together , they had three children : Bradley ( 1946 ) , Frances ( 1948 ) , and Elizabeth ( 1952 ) . 
 Marian became the second graduate student to work under the renowned Skinner . Her husband soon came to work with Skinner as well . While graduate students , they collaborated with Skinner on military research during World War II . Their work involved training pigeons for use by the U.S. Navy , teaching the birds to guide bombs . This was never actually used . Although many sources incorrectly refer to the work as Project Pigeon or the Pigeon Project , Marian assured colleagues that its name had actually been " Pigeon in a Pelican " , with pelican referring to the missile each pigeon was to guide . 
 The Brelands saw the commercial possibilities of operant training . So they left the University of Minnesota without completing their doctorates , and founded Animal Behavior Enterprises ( ABE ) on a farm in Minnesota . Skinner tried to dissuade the Brelands from abandoning their graduate education for an untested commercial endeavor . Classmate Paul <unk> bet $ 10 they would fail . ( His 1961 check for $ 10 later hung framed on Marian 's office wall . ) 
 ABE 's first project was training farm animals to appear in feed advertisements for General Mills . The Brelands went on to train " more animals and different species of animals than any other animal trainers " of their time , including animals of the land ( cats , cattle , chickens , dogs , goats , pigs , rabbits , raccoons , rats , and sheep ) , the air ( ducks , parrots , and ravens ) , and the sea ( dolphins and whales ) . At their busiest , they trained " more than 1 @,@ 000 animals at a given time " . In training animals for recreational facilities such as Marineland of Florida , Parrot Jungle , SeaWorld , and Six Flags , they created the very first dolphin and bird shows , a form of program now considered traditional entertainment fare . Most major theme parks ' animal programs can be traced back to the Brelands ' pioneering work . The Brelands also established the first coin @-@ operated animal shows . The Buck Bunny commercial featured their trained rabbits for a Coast Federal Savings television ad that ran for twenty years and which still holds the record for longest running TV commercial advertisement . They trained animals for many other venues including circuses , motion pictures , museums , stores , and zoos . 
 Earlier animal trainers had historically relied primarily on punishment when teaching animals . The Brelands instead followed Skinner 's emphasis on the use of positive reinforcement to train animals , using rewards for desired behavior . Although other students of Skinner 's later entered commercial animal training as well , the Brelands ' techniques dominated the field because they found ways to simplify the training of complex behaviors . The Brelands did not just train the animals . They also trained other animal trainers , establishing in 1947 " the first school and instruction manual for teaching animal trainers the applied technology of behavior analysis . " Marlin Perkins of Wild Kingdom and Walt Disney were among those who learned from them . 
 Marian led ABE 's government research , some of which remains classified to this day . Known projects included the development of an avian ambush detection system . In 1950 , the Brelands relocated ABE to a farm near Hot Springs , Arkansas . In 1955 , they opened the " I.Q. Zoo " in Hot Springs as both a training facility and a showcase of trained animals . " Popular acts included chickens that walked <unk> , dispensed souvenirs and fortune cards , danced to music from jukeboxes , played baseball and ran the bases ; rabbits that kissed their ( plastic ) girlfriends , rode fire trucks and sounded sirens , and rolled wheels of fortune ; ducks that played pianos and drums ; and raccoons that played basketball . " 
 The Brelands were also " the first to introduce the public to the applied technology of behavior analysis via numerous personal appearances at fairs , exhibitions , and theme parks across the country " . They appeared on well known television shows such as The Today Show , The Tonight Show , Wild Kingdom , and You Asked For It . Publications including Colliers , Life , Popular Mechanics , Reader 's Digest , Saturday Evening Post , Time , and even The Wall Street Journal featured them and their work . Although Keller was often the public face of ABE with some ads referring to " Keller Breland 's I.Q. Zoo , " the Brelands collaborated equally in ABE 's endeavors . 
 The Brelands stirred controversy among behaviorists with their 1961 article , " The misbehavior of organisms " — the title of which involved a play on words referring to Skinner 's classic 1938 work The Behavior of Organisms . Marian and Keller outlined training difficulties in which instinct or instinctive drift might occur as tendencies biologically inherent in a species intrude into the behaviors a trainer was attempting to teach an animal . The article is recognized as a milestone in the history of psychology . 
 In 1963 , Marian designed and implemented a program to improve techniques for working with profoundly mentally retarded individuals at a human development center in Alexandria , Louisiana . She emphasized the value of positive reinforcement , and taught ward attendants humane practices that became the standard for institutions of this kind . The 1965 training manual Teaching the Mentally Retarded , which she and others prepared , remained in use for decades . 
 On June 16 , 1965 , Keller died of a heart attack . In their 1966 textbook , Marian described him as the “ dreamer ” and herself as the “ engineer ” . She continued writing , researching , and training animals . 
 = = Work with Bob Bailey = = 
 In 1976 , Marian married Robert E. ( Bob ) Bailey . He had been the first Director of Training in the Navy 's Marine Mammal Program , then became ABE 's General Manager . He and Marian had founded the facility " Animal Wonderland " in 1972 . Among their many activities , the Baileys worked with the Canine Companions for Independence nonprofit organization which trained dogs to assist disabled individuals . Together , the Baileys trained animals from over 140 species . 
 Marian 's graduate studies had stopped when she and Keller left to found ABE . Marian now returned to grad school , and earned her Ph.D. in Psychology at the University of Arkansas in 1978 . She then served as a professor of psychology at Henderson State University from 1981 until her retirement in 1998 . During these years , the Baileys produced educational films on topics such as the history of behaviorism . Their film work included The History of Behavioral Analysis Biographies , the ABE documentary Patient Like the Chipmunks , and An Apple for the Student : How Behavioral Psychology Can Change the American Classroom . 
 Marian continued writing about the " misbehavior " of animals during operant conditioning for publications like American Psychologist , ' , the official journal of the American Psychological Association ( APA ) . The Baileys were chief among the behaviorists who began using the Internet for instruction , problem solving , and promotion of their science . 
 In 1996 , the Baileys began the Bailey & Bailey Operant Conditioning Workshops , which provided training to animal trainers , psychologists , students , and many others from throughout the world . The program of study involved four increasingly advanced levels of the " physically , mentally , and emotionally demanding " workshops . In 1998 , the University of Arkansas inducted Marian into the university 's Fulbright College Alumni Academy as one of their first Distinguished Alumni Award recipients . 
 On September 25 , 2001 , Marian died at St. Joseph 's Hospital in Hot Springs .

 After Marian 's death , numerous professionals in the field recognized her death with obituaries and biographies . Dr. Art <unk> and Dr. Elson <unk> of the University of Central Arkansas wrote an obituary for the American Psychologist . Psi Chi 's <unk> on Psi Chi honored Marian , who had been a member for over sixty years , with a biography by Dr. Todd <unk> of Henderson State . The year after her death , the Arkansas Historical Quarterly featured a retrospective on Marian , who had been a figure in the state of Arkansas for decades .

Other obituaries and biographies have appeared online . 
 In her name , Henderson State University presents the Marian Breland Bailey Endowed Scholarship in Psychology to select psychology undergraduates . Memorial contributions in Marian 's memory go to this scholarship and to the Arkansas Kidney Foundation . 
 Marian 's husband Bob continued to teach seminars they developed and the Bailey & Bailey Operant Conditioning Workshops which they began together .

Odubade played a total of 47 times during his first season at Stevenage , scoring 16 times and finishing as the club 's top goalscorer for the season – a season that witnessed the club reach the Football League for the first time in their history after finishing as league champions . 
 Ahead of the 2010 – 11 season , Odubade scored in a pre @-@ season friendly against Histon , in a 2 – 0 win . He featured in the club 's first Football League match , against Macclesfield Town in August 2010 , coming on as a 60th @-@ minute substitute in a match that ended 2 – 2 . He subsequently started his first game of the season in Stevenage 's 2 – 1 loss to Portsmouth in the League Cup . Odubade scored his first goal of the season in the club 's 1 – 1 home draw against Crewe Alexandra in September 2010 , tapping in from close range to give Stevenage the lead . He scored his second goal of the season in Stevenage 's 2 – 0 televised FA Cup victory against AFC Wimbledon . 
 In January 2011 , Odubade went on loan to Conference National side Newport County until the end of the 2010 – 11 campaign . He made his Newport debut in the club 's televised 3 – 3 away draw against Mansfield Town , coming on as an 82nd @-@ minute substitute in the match . Odubade made his first start for Newport in a 2 – 2 away draw against Bath City on 22 February 2011 , scoring Newport 's first goal after 14 minutes . It was to be Odubade 's only goal for Newport in the eleven appearances he made for the club , seven of which were as a substitute . He returned to his parent club on 17 May 2011 . 
 = = = Gateshead = = = 
 Having been released by Stevenage at the end of the 2010 – 11 season , Odubade signed for Conference National side Gateshead on 7 June 2011 . He joined Gateshead on a free transfer , signing for the club alongside Eddie Odhiambo ; the two had previously played alongside each other at Oxford United , Stevenage , and Newport County . On joining Gateshead , Odubade said " I have parted company with Stevenage on good terms and this is now a new chapter for me . Gateshead is a good club that is moving in the right direction and I 'm sure we can kick on next season . I don 't look back with any regrets as things happen for a reason . I am always looking forward . Gateshead is a new challenge for me and I can only see good things coming from it " . He made his Gateshead debut on 13 August 2011 in the club 's 3 – 2 away win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough , assisting Kris Gate 's goal in the 80th minute . Odubade scored his first goal for Gateshead three days later at Gateshead International Stadium in Gateshead 's 3 – 0 win against Mansfield Town , which was voted Goal of the Season in the club 's end of season awards . His first season at Gateshead was disrupted by two @-@ foot injuries mid @-@ way through the campaign , with Odubade breaking his metatarsal bone on two occasions , subsequently missing a total of 18 games . Despite the injuries , he made 34 appearances throughout the season , scoring seven times . He signed a one @-@ year contract extension with Gateshead in May 2012 . 
 Despite appearing 24 times for Gateshead during the opening half of the 2012 – 13 season , although eight of which were as a substitute , Odubade was loaned to Conference National side Forest Green Rovers on 17 January 2013 , for the remainder of the campaign . He made his debut on 19 January as a second @-@ half substitute against Stockport County , a game in which Forest Green lost 2 – 1 . He scored his first goal for Forest Green on 12 March 2013 in a 2 – 1 win over Southport . It proved to be his only goal during his time at Forest Green , making 14 appearances , all of which in the league . Odubade returned to Gateshead following the conclusion of the 2012 – 13 season , and was told he was one of seven players released by the club in April 2013 . 
 = = = Eastleigh = = = 
 Following his release from Gateshead , Odubade joined Conference South side Eastleigh on a free transfer on 31 May 2013 . On acquiring Odubade 's services , Eastleigh manager Richard Hill stated — " I was impressed with his own personal ambition and his desire to be successful and Yemi opted to sign for Eastleigh as he wants to be with a Club that hold the same ambitions " . While playing for Eastleigh , Odubade went on loan to Woking during the 2014 / 15 season and made his debut as a substitute against Alfreton . He soon became a regular starter and scored in half the games he played in for the club . 
 = = Style of play = = 
 Odubade is generally deployed as a striker , but has also been used as a winger . He believes that his best asset is his turn of pace , and that he is at his most dangerous when he is " running at opposition defences " . He is predominantly right @-@ footed , and scores the majority of his goals with his right foot , but is also comfortable using his left . During his time at Stevenage , manager Graham Westley has used Odubade as the second striker as part of a 4 – 4 – 2 formation sitting off the shoulder of the centre forward . Westley has also used him as part of a 4 – 3 – 3 formation , usually on the right side of a three @-@ pronged attack . Odubade has been described as possessing " blistering pace " , which was emphasised following two goals away at Crawley Town in March 2010 , whereby his pace left the Crawley defence " in their tracks " . Former Oxford United manager Darren Patterson said that Odubade needs " to work on his movement up front , and he 's got to realise what his assets are and play to them " .

 = 1997 Pacific hurricane season = 
 The 1997 Pacific hurricane season was a very active hurricane season . With hundreds of deaths and hundreds of millions of dollars in damage , this season was the costliest and one of the deadliest Pacific hurricane seasons . This was due to the exceptionally strong 1997 – 98 El Niño event . The 1997 Pacific hurricane season officially started on May 15 , 1997 in the eastern Pacific , and on June 1 , 1997 in the central Pacific , and lasted until November 30 , 1997 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when almost all tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean . 
 Several storms impacted land . The first was Tropical Storm Andres which killed four people and left another two missing . In August , Tropical Storm Ignacio took an unusual path , and its extratropical remnants caused minor damage in the Pacific Northwest and California . Linda became the most intense east Pacific hurricane in recorded history . Although it never made landfall , it produced large surf in Southern California and as a result five people had to be rescued . Hurricane Nora caused flooding and damage in the Southwestern United States , while Olaf made two landfalls and caused eighteen deaths and several other people were reported missing . Hurricane Pauline killed several hundred people and caused record damage in southeastern Mexico . In addition , Super Typhoons Oliwa and Paka originated in the region before crossing the International Date Line and causing significant damage in the western Pacific . There were also two Category 5 hurricanes : Linda and Guillermo . 
 Activity in the season was above average . The season produced 17 named storms , which was a little above normal . The average number of named storms per year is 15 . The 1997 season also had 9 hurricanes , compared to the average of 8 . There were also 7 major hurricanes compared to the average of 4 . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 The 1997 Pacific hurricane season officially started on May 15 , 1997 in the eastern Pacific , and on June 1 , 1997 in the central Pacific , and lasted until November 30 , 1997 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean . This season exceeded these boundaries appreciably , as Tropical Storm Paka formed December 2 , and dissipated nineteen days later after crossing the International Dateline and then moved into the Western Pacific . 
 The 1997 Pacific hurricane season was fairly active , due to the strong El Niño that was occurring at the time . El Niño causes wind shear to be reduced and water temperatures to increase , resulting in conditions more conductive for tropical cyclones in the East Pacific . There were 24 cyclones in total , including five unnamed tropical depressions . Of these , 19 were in the east Pacific ( east of 140 ° W ) . Of these , eight peaked at tropical storm intensity , while ten reached hurricane status . Seven of these reached Category 3 intensity or higher on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane scale , including central Pacific cyclones Super Typhoons Oliwa and Paka , which became typhoons after crossing into the western Pacific . The first hurricane of the year was Hurricane Dolores , and the first major hurricane was Hurricane Enrique . Most months during the year had several storms , but no records were set for storms in any particular month . 
 Activity in the central Pacific was also above average . Two tropical storms formed , as did several tropical depressions . A number of storms moved in from the east . With a total of nine tropical cyclones entering or forming there , this was the fourth highest number since satellite observations began . The first storm formed on June 1 . The last storm dissipated December 21 , which gives this season the latest known end . However , if December 6 , the date the last storm crossed the dateline is taken to be the end , this season has the second latest end , behind the 1983 season and tied with the 1957 season . 
 = = Season summary and statistics = = 
 The season began with the formation of Tropical Depression One @-@ E on June 1 and ended with the dissipation of Tropical Depression Paka on December 22 . The season can alternatively be considered to end on December 6 , the day Tropical Storm Paka crossed the international dateline . No named storms formed in May , three in June , four in July , four in August , five in September , one in October , and one in November . Very unusually , a tropical storm formed in December , after the season ended . The other two times this feat occurred since the satellite era began in 1971 were in 1983 and 2010 . 
 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Tropical Storm Andres = = = 
 Andres originated from a disturbance that slowly organized and formed into Tropical Depression One @-@ E on June 1 . The next day , it reached tropical storm status as a second circulation formed north @-@ northwest of the initial circulation . However , the former circulation became dominant , and Andres intensified slightly . After a brief period of a normal track to the northwest , Andres was picked up by westerly winds and became the first named storm to threaten Central America . Initially forecast to cross the isthmus and enter the Caribbean Sea , Andres instead turned to the southeast and paralleled the coast . This was the first time since record @-@ keeping began that any East Pacific storm had taken such a path . Andres then turned back to the northeast . It weakened to a depression and made landfall near San Salvador on June 7 and dissipated shortly thereafter . 
 Among the casualties were two fishers who were reported missing . Andres caused power outages , flooding rivers , several car crashes , and damage to roughly ten homes . The highest rainfall report from Mexico was 11 @.@ 42 inches ( 290 mm ) at <unk> . Damage was noted in parts of Nicaragua . Andres also killed four people in <unk> , El Salvador due to heavy flooding . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Blanca = = = 
 Tropical Depression Two @-@ E formed from a broad area of low pressure on June 9 . Six hours later the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Blanca . This system developed a good outflow , and reached its peak intensity with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) . However , its circulation was not well @-@ defined and a weakening trend began , and Blanca was downgraded to a depression on June 12 . It lost its closed circulation shortly thereafter and was thus declared dissipated . 
 Blanca briefly threatened land on June 10 as warnings and watches were established by the Mexican Servicio Meteorológico Nacional . Shortly thereafter , a ridge of high pressure turned Blanca away from the coast . As Blanca moved just south of the Mexican coast , it dropped a total of 5 @.@ 77 inches ( 147 mm ) of rainfall at <unk> <unk> / <unk> . There were no major damage or casualties as Blanca 's impact was generally minimal . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Three @-@ E = = = 
 Tropical Depression Three @-@ E formed June 21 . Moving rapidly westward , it never strengthened and the winds of the depression soon decreased . It dissipated early on June 24 . The depression never impacted land . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Carlos = = = 
 On June 22 , showers increased associated with a tropical wave several hundred miles away from land . Three days later , deep convection became more concentrated , and the system became a tropical depression . It intensified into Tropical Storm Carlos as banding features increased and the outflow became better defined . As it moved west , convection diminished as Carlos moved into cooler water . Shortly thereafter , increased wind shear took its toll on Carlos as the low @-@ level center became exposed from the deep convection . Carlos weakened into a depression early on June 27 , and dissipated June 28 . However , a swirl of clouds remained for a couple of days . Except for Socorro Island , which the system passed close to , Carlos never threatened land . No indications of casualties or damage were reported . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Five @-@ E = = = 
 On the afternoon of June 29 , Tropical Depression Five @-@ E formed . It erratically moved westward . On July 1 , the depression weakened slightly , but quickly reintensified . It dissipated on July 4 , without even threatening land . 
 = = = Hurricane Dolores = = = 
 In early July , shower activity increased in association with an area of disturbed weather . With surface pressures lower than normal for a tropical disturbance , deep convection increased further and Tropical Depression Six @-@ E formed late on July 5 and reaching tropical storm status the following day and was named Dolores . Despite moderate wind shear , very cold cloud tops formed as the winds increased to 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) , a moderate tropical storm . Moving westward , Dolores strengthened into the first hurricane of the season on July 7 as a ragged eye formed . 
 Dolores continued to intensify and it reached a peak windspeed of 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) , a strong Category 1 hurricane , two days later . Meanwhile , Dolores became the first hurricane in over two years to cross longitude 125 ° W. Shortly thereafter , the hurricane started losing strength as it moved over cooler waters . The eye dissipated from satellite imagery while the associated thunderstorm activity became sheared . Dolores weakened back into a tropical storm on July 10 and a tropical depression the next day . The cyclone then crossed into the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility ( west of longitude 140 ° W ) while producing minimal shower activity . It dissipated on July 12 . The hurricane was not a threat to any land . 
 = = = Hurricane Enrique = = = 
 The first major hurricane of the season originated from a broad area of low pressure on July 8 near the Gulf of Tehuantepec . The thunderstorms gradually became more concentrated and a tropical depression formed on July 12 . It strengthened into a tropical storm twelve hours later , and then began to rapidly intensify as convection increased further near the center . It became a hurricane on July 13 . Enrique continued to steadily intensify and became a Category 2 hurricane on July 14 . The next day , Enrique reached its peak intensity of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) and peak pressure 960 mbar ( hPa ) on July 14 . Shortly thereafter , the hurricane outflow became asymmetrical and it began to weaken over cool waters . It weakened fairly quickly and was downgraded into a Category 2 hurricane on July 15 . It then lost hurricane intensity later that day . On July 16 the winds had decreased further to 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . Enrique weakened into a depression the next day , and degenerated into a swirl of clouds shortly thereafter . The system never threatened land . 
 = = = Hurricane Felicia = = = 
 A large area of disturbed weather formed on July 13 . It then organized into a depression south of Manzanillo , Colima , on July 14 . Intensification was delayed by wind shear due to its proximity to Enrique for about two days . However , it became a tropical storm late July 15 as it moved west @-@ northwestward . Continuing to intensify , an eye formed . Based on this , Felicia was upgraded into a hurricane on July 17 . Its development was again halted by increased wind shear , and as such it leveled off in intensity . After the shear decreased , Felicia began to intensify and the hurricane 's winds reached 135 mph ( 217 km / h ) and its pressure fell to 948 mbar ( hPa ) , making it a moderate low @-@ end Category 4 hurricane . Shear increased for the third time , and then moved into cooler waters . It began to weaken as it moved west @-@ northwest . On July 20 , it lost major hurricane intensity . Shortly before being downgraded to a tropical storm , it crossed 140 ° W. A strong wind shear took toll on Felicia and it was downgraded into a tropical depression July 22 . No damage or deaths were reported in wake of the hurricane . 
 = = = Tropical Depression One @-@ C = = = 
 Tropical Depression One @-@ C formed on July 26 from a disturbance that had been showing signs of organization for the past three days . It moved west to southwest through an unfavorable environment . On the morning of July 27 , it dissipated due to strong wind shear caused by an upper @-@ level trough . The system never impacted land , thus no damage was reported . 
 = = = Hurricane Guillermo = = = 
 A tropical wave emerged into the Pacific Ocean on July 27 . It organized into a depression July 30 and was named Tropical Storm Guillermo the next day . It quickly intensified , reaching hurricane status on August 1 . Guillermo became a major hurricane August 2 . It reached Category 4 intensity on August 3 . Continuing to rapidly intensify , Guillermo attained Category 5 strength August 4 . The tropical cyclone peak intensity was 919 mbar ( hPa ) and 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) . 
 Guillermo then weakened slowly , becoming a tropical storm August 8 . It crossed 140 ° W and entered the Central Pacific . It weakened to a depression late August 10 , but restrengthened back into a storm 24 hours later when it encountered a small area of warmer water . It weakened to a depression for the second and final time August 15 and became an extratropical cyclone early the next day . The storm 's remnants recurved over the far northern Pacific . They were tracked to a point 500 nautical miles ( 930 km ) west of Vancouver Island . The remnants persisted for a few more days and drifted south before being absorbed by a mid @-@ latitude cyclone August 24 off the coast of California . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Hilda = = = 
 A tropical wave that had showed signs of development emerged into the East Pacific and organized into Tropical Depression Ten @-@ E on August 10 . Despite some wind shear , the depression managed to become a tropical storm late on August 11 . Hilda reached its peak intensity as a moderate 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) tropical storm the next day . After maintaining its peak intensity for 24 hours , it gradually weakened due to increasing wind shear On August 14 , shear weakened Hilda to a depression and the cyclone dissipated early the next morning . Hilda was no threat to land and caused no known damage or deaths . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Ignacio = = = 
 Tropical Storm Ignacio formed first as a depression in an area of disturbed weather on August 17 . Twelve hours later , it organized into a tropical storm . Its location of tropical cyclone formation was further north and west of where most East Pacific tropical cyclones develop . Steering currents pulled Ignacio north , where it encountered wind shear and cooler waters . Ignacio never intensified beyond 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) and then was downgraded into a depression on August 18 . It last transitioned into an extratropical cyclone 24 hours later . It was then absorbed by a cyclone associated with the remnants of Hurricane Guillermo . 
 Ignacio 's remnants moved north , bringing gusty winds to California coastal waters before dissipating . Severe flooding was recorded along Highway 97 with a debris flow estimated at 0 @.@ 5 mi ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) and 7 ft ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) deep . They caused rainfall as far north as the U.S. state of Washington . Thunderstorms caused power outages in central California . 
 = = = Hurricane Jimena = = = 
 During the third week of August , a tropical disturbance formed far from land . Although the system was located over warmer than average sea surface temperatures , the upper @-@ level environment was initially unfavorable . However the environment gradually became more conducive for tropical cyclone formation and Tropical Depression Twelve @-@ E formed August 25 from an area of disturbed weather in a rather easterly location . It became a tropical storm the next day and a hurricane on August 27 . Intensification was rapid , with winds increasing from 75 mph ( 121 km / h ) to 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) in just 6 hours . Continuing to rapidly intensify , it reached its peak intensity as a low @-@ end category 4 hurricane . After maintaining peak intensity for 30 hours , it moved north @-@ northwest and encountered increasing wind shear which reduced its winds from 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) to 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) in just 24 hours . Jimena completely dissipated on August 30 , not long after entering the Central Pacific Basin . Hurricane Jimena was of no threat to land . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Oliwa = = = 
 Tropical storm Oliwa began as a tropical disturbance that had meandered south of Johnston Atoll . It organized into Tropical Depression Two @-@ C on September 2 . Later that day , it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Oliwa ( Hawaiian for Oliver ) as it slowly moved towards the west . It crossed the dateline late on September 3 and entered the Joint Typhoon Warning Center 's Area of Responsibility . ) In the Pacific Ocean , tropical cyclones are not renamed when they cross basin boundaries , so Oliwa kept its name . 
 Oliwa passed south of Wake Island on September 6 , where it caused heavy rains but no damage . On September 7 , Oliwa started a period of rapid strengthening , becoming a typhoon on September 8 and a Super Typhoon eight hours later . Oliwa stayed at that intensity for over two days . While still a strong typhoon , Oliwa passed near the Northern Marianas Islands . It then started weakening as it curved towards Japan . It made landfall as a minimal typhoon September 16 . It quickly dissipated later that same day . Typhoon Oliwa caused 12 fatalities and left 30 @,@ 000 people homeless . Damage totaled to 4 @.@ 36 billion yen ( $ 50 @.@ 1 million USD ) . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Kevin = = = 
 Tropical Storm Kevin , first displayed hints of development while located near Panama , and developed a well @-@ defined circulation after emerging into the Pacific . It was classified as a tropical depression in the Pacific on September 3 while located south @-@ south west of Baja California . Convection increased and the outflow of the storm became better defined . As such , it became a tropical storm on the morning of September 4 . Gradually intensifying , it reached it peak intensity as a mid @-@ level tropical storm on September 5 . As it moved westbound , it maintained its intensity for 12 hours . The environment was unfavorable , and two days later , Kevin weakened to a depression when deep convection ceased . It dissipated early on September 7 , having never posed a threat to land . 
 = = = Hurricane Linda = = = 
 A tropical disturbance formed on September 9 and became Tropical Depression Fourteen @-@ E later that day . The cyclone moved northwest and strengthened into a tropical storm on September 10 . Linda then rapidly intensified reaching hurricane intensity the next day as an eye formed . It peaked in intensity on September 12 with it reaching a maximum windspeed of 185 mph ( 298 km / h ) — enough to make it a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale — and a minimum pressure of 902 mbar ( 902 hPa ) , making it the most intense Pacific hurricane ever recorded until Hurricane Patricia took its place in 2015 . However , Linda soon moved over cooler waters , and lost hurricane intensity on September 16 . It then slowly weakened and dissipated on September 17 . 
 Linda passed very near Socorro Island . In addition , early forecasts predicted that Linda would make landfall in California . The landfall never materialized and warnings or watches were not necessary for any location . However , Linda caused large surf , which crashed ashore in California , where it swept five people off a jetty . Moisture related to Linda also contributed to a landslide in southern California that destroyed or damaged 79 houses . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Marty = = = 
 An area of disturbed weather formed early on September 10 . It became better organized two days later as convection increased , and then organized into Tropical Depression Fifteen @-@ E late on September 12 . Moving slowly in a westward direction , it strengthened into a tropical storm in the morning of September 14 . Later that day , the system reached its peak intensity of 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) . Meanwhile , the storm 's forward speed slowed down even more , and it turned to the south . It then encountered an area of strong wind shear , and it weakened into a depression on September 15 as the center of circulation became displaced from the deep convection . The shear continued to weaken , and the tropical cyclone dissipated late on September 16 . There were no deaths or damage . 
 = = = Hurricane Nora = = = 
 A large area of disturbed weather moved into the Pacific on September 12 . It then organized into Tropical Depression Sixteen @-@ E on September 16 and quickly strengthened into a tropical storm . Early on September 18 , a poorly defined and ragged eye appeared on infrared imagery . Shortly thereafter , its winds reached 105 mph ( 169 km / h ) . Nora eventually peaked at Category 4 . It then encountered water temperature anomalies , and fluctuated in strength . Then , a trough pulled Nora northward and accelerated the storm . After weakening to a Category 1 , Nora made landfall in northern Baja California and stayed a tropical storm as it entered the United States . At that time , however , most of the deep rest convection was displaced to the northeast . Nora dissipated over Arizona , but its remnants kept going north . 
 Hurricane Nora was the first Pacific hurricane to bring gale @-@ force winds to the Continental United States since Kathleen in 1976 . In Mexico , Nora produced high waves , flooding , and heavy damage . Many homes were destroyed . In the United States , rains were heavy , and damage amounted to several hundred million dollars . Several hundred people were rendered homeless , and there was wind and flood damage in Arizona . Nora killed two people in Mexico , and several indirect deaths were reported in California . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Olaf = = = 
 A tropical disturbance left Central America on September 22 . Despite some wind shear , the system gradually became better organized and a tropical depression formed September 26 , being upgraded to a tropical storm several hours later . The cyclone immediately moved north . Instead of strengthening into a hurricane before landfall as forecasted , Olaf weakened due to its proximity to land . On September 29 , Olaf made landfall near Salina Cruz , Oaxaca . 
 Olaf , as a tropical depression , moved westward , far out to sea . Operationally , Olaf was believed to have dissipated for six days. however , in the Tropical Cyclone Report , a report issued several months after the hurricane 's duration , it was believed to have remained a tropical cyclone the entire time . After restrengthening slightly , Olaf moved southeast on October 5 due to the influence of Hurricane Pauline . Olaf then turned north , and on October 12 made a second landfall near Manzanillo , Colima , as a tropical depression . Olaf 's surface circulation weakened , and its remnants moved back out to sea , but did not redevelop . 
 Olaf resulted in some reports of damage and flooding in Mexico and Guatemala . During two time frames , from September 27 through October 2 and 10 through October 16 , a total of 27 @.@ 73 inches ( 704 mm ) of rainfall fell in association with Olaf in <unk> / <unk> . Several people were reported missing . Most of its damage was from its first landfall . Throughout Southern Mexico , Guatemala and El Salvador , flooding caused by Olaf was blamed for eighteen deaths . 
 = = = Hurricane Pauline = = = 
 On October 3 , a distinct area of disturbed weather formed . It drifted eastbound , and a well @-@ defined low pressure soon formed . It became Tropical Depression Eighteen @-@ E on October 5 . Early the next day it intensified into tropical Storm Pauline . An eye feature developed on October 7 and as such Pauline was upgraded into a hurricane . In a favorable environment , the cyclone rapidly intensified , reaching Category 4 intensity . After fluctuating in intensity , interaction with land weakened Pauline to a Category 2 by the time it made landfall on October 9 . It accelerated to the northwest , and passed over a mountainous region . The mountains disrupted Pauline 's circulation , and squeezed the moisture from the hurricane . Pauline dissipated on October 10 while over Jalisco . 
 Hurricane Pauline was the deadliest storm of the season . Landslides and flooding caused by heavy rain caused tragic loss of life and left thousands homeless . There were at least 230 casualties . The Red Cross reported that 400 people died , but this was disputed by Mexican officials . Pauline was Mexico 's deadliest hurricane since 1976 's Liza . In addition , the hurricane caused $ 447 @.@ 8 million in damage ( 1997 USD ; $ 473 million 2008 USD ) .

 = = = Hurricane Rick = = = 
 The first hurricane in November since 1991 formed from a tropical disturbance . Although the circulation was initially poorly defined , it later acquired enough organization and was classified as a tropical depression on November 7 . It moved north until a trough of low pressure turned it to the northeast . It was named on November 8 , and was upgraded to a hurricane the next day . It reached its peak intensity of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) and 973 mbar ( hPa ) . Rick made landfall in Oaxaca – the same area devastated by Hurricane Pauline one month earlier – and quickly weakened , dissipating early on November 11 . 
 The storm downed trees , washed out recently repaired roads , and disrupted communications in some small population centers . A total of 10 @.@ 47 inches ( 266 mm ) of rain was reported at <unk> / San Pedro <unk> near the point of landfall in Mexico . No one was killed . 
 Rick is one of only eight known hurricanes to form in the Pacific Ocean east of the dateline in the month of November . The other ones are Nina , Tara , Iwa , Nora , Sergio , Kenneth , and Sandra of which only Rick , Tara , and Iwa directly impacted land . It was also the second @-@ latest landfalling Pacific hurricane .

 Tropical Depression Five @-@ C formed on December 2 , two days after the season ended . It was the second December tropical depression east of the dateline ; 1983 's Hurricane Winnie was the only other one . The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Paka ( Hawaiian for Pat ) while west of Palmyra Atoll . The system began to move westward at a steady pace . As Paka moved westward , dry air and wind shear disrupted its development until it crossed the dateline on December 6 . 
 After entering the Western Pacific , the cyclone encountered a more favorable environment , resulting in rapid intensification . It became a typhoon on December 10 and passed near Kwajalein with winds of 120 mph ( 190 km / h ) . It strengthened further , twice reaching Category 5 intensity . While a super typhoon , Paka passed close to Guam on December 17 , causing major damage . Afterwards , Paka encountered a hostile environment and had completely dissipated by the evening of December 22 .

It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm @-@ force winds every six hours , summing the results , and dividing that total by 104 . This explains why Hurricane Guillermo has a higher ACE than Linda . It was not as strong as that storm , but because it was above tropical storm force for a longer time , it reached a higher ACE level . As a tropical cyclone does not have gale @-@ force winds until it becomes a tropical storm , tropical depressions are not included in these tables . For all storms , ACE is given to three significant figures . The ACE in the east Pacific proper ( 140 ° W to North America ) is given ; the ACE in the central Pacific ( the international dateline to 140 ° W ) is given in brackets . 
 The table includes the ACE for Oliwa and Paka only during those storm 's time east of the dateline . Their ACE west of the dateline is part of the totals of the 1997 typhoon season . 
 The National Hurricane Center uses ACE to rank hurricane seasons as above @-@ normal , near @-@ normal , and below @-@ normal . This season has a total of 17 tropical storms , 9 hurricanes , and 7 major hurricanes . The total ACE of this season is 160 * 104 kt2 in the east Pacific proper . This qualifies this season as above @-@ normal .

 The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1997 . Names that were not assigned are marked in gray . The names not retired from this list were used again in the 2003 season . This is the same list used for the 1991 season except for Felicia , which replaced Fefa . A storm was named Felicia for the first time in 1997 . Also , the name " Dolores " was misspelled " Delores " in the 1991 season ; in this and subsequent seasons , the typo was corrected . 
 For storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility , encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line , all names are used in a series of four rotating lists . The next four names that were slated for use in 1997 are shown below , however , only two of them were used .

 = Yugoslav submarine Nebojša = 
 The Yugoslav submarine Nebojša was the second of the Hrabri @-@ class diesel @-@ electric submarines built by the Vickers @-@ Armstrong Naval Yard on the River Tyne in the United Kingdom , for the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( later Yugoslavia ) and was launched in 1927 . Her design was based on that of the British L @-@ class submarine of World War I , and she was built using parts originally assembled for a Royal Navy L @-@ class submarine that was never built . She was armed with six bow @-@ mounted 533 mm ( 21 in ) torpedo tubes , two 102 mm ( 4 in ) guns and one machine gun , and could dive to 60 metres ( 200 ft ) . 
 Prior to World War II Nebojša participated in cruises to several Mediterranean ports . During the German @-@ led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 , she evaded capture by Italian forces , and joined British naval forces in the Mediterranean where she performed a training role . After the war she was taken over by the new Yugoslav government and renamed Tara . She was eventually stricken in 1954 , and scrapped in 1958 . 
 = = Description and construction = = 
 Yugoslav naval policy in the interwar period lacked direction until the mid @-@ 1920s , although it was generally accepted that the Adriatic coastline was effectively a sea frontier that the naval arm was responsible for securing with the limited resources made available to it . In 1926 , a modest ten @-@ year construction program was initiated to build up a force of submarines , coastal torpedo boats , torpedo bombers and conventional bomber aircraft to perform this role . The Hrabri @-@ class submarines were one of the first new acquisitions aimed at developing a naval force capable of meeting this challenge . 
 Nebojša ( Fearless ) was built in 1927 for the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( later Yugoslavia ) , by the Vickers @-@ Armstrong Naval Yard on the River Tyne in the United Kingdom . Her design was based on that of the British L @-@ class submarine of World War I , and she was built using parts originally assembled for HMS L @-@ 68 , which was never completed . Along with her sister submarine Hrabri , she had an overall length of 72 @.@ 05 metres ( 236 ft 5 in ) , a beam of 7 @.@ 32 m ( 24 ft 0 in ) , and a surfaced draught of 3 @.@ 96 m ( 13 ft 0 in ) . Her surfaced displacement was 975 long tons ( 991 t ) or 1 @,@ 164 long tons ( 1 @,@ 183 t ) submerged , and her crew consisted of 45 officers and enlisted men . She had an operational depth of 60 m ( 200 ft ) . 
 The Hrabri @-@ class had two shafts driven by two diesel engines ( when surfaced ) or two electric motors ( when submerged ) . Their diesel engines were rated at 2 @,@ 400 brake horsepower ( 1 @,@ 800 kW ) and the electric motors at 1 @,@ 600 shaft horsepower ( 1 @,@ 200 kW ) , and they were designed to reach a top speed of 15 @.@ 7 knots ( 29 @.@ 1 km / h ; 18 @.@ 1 mph ) under diesel power while surfaced , and 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) on their electric motors when submerged . They were armed with six bow @-@ mounted 533 mm ( 21 in ) torpedo tubes , and carried twelve torpedoes . They were also equipped with two 102 mm ( 4 in ) deck guns ( one forward and one aft of the conning tower ) , and one machine gun . Their radius of action was 3 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 000 km ; 4 @,@ 400 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 = = Service career = = 
 Nebojša was launched in 1927 as the second submarine of the navy of the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes , which later became the Royal Yugoslav Navy . Along with her sister submarine Hrabri , she left the Tyne in late January 1928 . In company with the Yugoslav submarine tender Hvar , the two submarines arrived in the Bay of Kotor on the southern Adriatic coast on 8 April 1928 . In May and June 1929 , Hrabri , Nebojša , Hvar and six torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser Dalmacija on a cruise to Malta , the Greek island of Corfu in the Ionian Sea , and Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia . The British naval attaché observed that the ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta . On 16 May 1930 , Nebojša was exercising her crew at periscope depth near the entrance to the Bay of Kotor when she collided with a Yugoslav steamship . The damage was not serious and there were no injuries , but her forward 102 mm gun was lost overboard . The necessary repairs were carried out at the dockyard in the Bay of Kotor . 
 In June and July 1930 , Hrabri , Nebojša and the fleet auxiliary Sitnica again cruised the Mediterranean , visiting Alexandria and Beirut . In 1932 , the British naval attaché reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises , manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets . In September 1933 , Nebojša and the submarine Osvetnik cruised the southern part of the central Mediterranean . In August 1936 , Nebojša and Osvetnik visited the Greek island of Corfu . 
 During the German @-@ led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941 , she and two Orjen @-@ class motor torpedo boats evaded capture by Italian forces at the Bay of Kotor , arriving at Suda Bay , Crete , on 23 April , after eight days at sea . Despite this , the Italians claimed that they had sunk all the Yugoslav vessels . Nebojša then sailed to Alexandria , but the Royal Navy considered her unfit for combat duties . British Prime Minister Winston Churchill suggested her crew might be retrained and used to operate the recently captured German Type VIIC U @-@ boat U @-@ 570 , but this idea was soon abandoned . She was based at Valletta in Malta as an anti @-@ submarine warfare training vessel , serving with the British 2nd Submarine Flotilla in 1942 and the British 3rd Submarine Flotilla in 1943 . She continued working in the Mediterranean until the end of the war , but her service with the Royal Navy appears to have been limited to a training role . 
 After the war she was towed first to Bari in Italy , then in August 1945 to the port of Split where she was overhauled , renamed Tara and given the pennant number 801 . She was then transferred to Pula on the Istrian peninsula in the northern Adriatic . Used to train the fledgling Yugoslav Navy submarine arm , she was stricken in 1954 . One of her guns was removed at the end of her career , and she was eventually scrapped in 1958 .

 = 2 / 3rd Machine Gun Battalion ( Australia ) = 
 The 2 / 3rd Machine Gun Battalion was formed in June 1940 as part of the 7th Division and served in Egypt , Syria , the Netherlands East Indies and New Guinea during World War II . Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Blackburn when it was raised , the battalion was primarily a South Australian unit , although it had sub @-@ units formed in Victoria , Tasmania and Western Australia . After completing training in Australia , in April 1941 the battalion embarked for the Middle East . In June / July 1941 it saw action against Vichy French forces during the Syria – Lebanon campaign , during which time the battalion was heavily involved in supporting various elements of the 7th Division . 
 Following Japan 's entry into the war , the decision was made to transfer a large number of Australian troops from the Middle East to the Pacific region . In early 1942 , as the Japanese advanced through the Netherlands East Indies , the majority of the battalion was captured during the Battle of Java . A small number of the battalion 's personnel returned to Australia and it was subsequently re @-@ raised in mid @-@ 1942 . It was later attached to the 6th Division as a corps unit and served in Papua New Guinea during the Aitape – Wewak campaign in 1944 – 45 . The battalion was disbanded in January 1946 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Formation and training = = = 
 The 2 / 3rd Machine Gun Battalion was one of four machine gun battalions that were raised as part of the all @-@ volunteer Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) for service overseas during World War II . Motorised infantry units , equipped with wheeled motor vehicles , motorcycles and sometimes tracked carriers , the machine gun battalions were formed to provide a greater level of support by fire than that which was organically available within ordinary infantry battalions . At its peak , the 2 / 3rd was equipped with 124 motor vehicles of various descriptions and 50 motorcycles . 
 Developed by the British Army , the concept within the Australian Army had its genesis during the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915 , when the machine guns assigned to the infantry battalions – initially two and then , later , four – had been grouped together and co @-@ ordinated at brigade level to help compensate for the lack of artillery support . Over the course of the war , on the Western Front the concept had evolved through the establishment of machine gun companies in 1916 and machine gun battalions in 1918 . Similar formations had also been established amongst the Australian Light Horse units serving in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign . During the inter @-@ war years , the machine gun battalions had been deemed unnecessary . When the Army was reorganised in 1921 , they were not re @-@ raised , but in 1937 , as the Army looked to expand as fears of war in Europe loomed , four such units were raised within the part @-@ time Militia , by converting light horse units and motorising them . When World War II broke out , the decision was made to raise several machine gun battalions within the 2nd AIF , allocated at a rate of one per division . 
 The 2 / 3rd Machine Gun Battalion was formed on 17 June 1940 , in Wayville , South Australia . Upon formation , the battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Blackburn , a World War I veteran who had received the Victoria Cross for actions at Pozieres . Designated a South Australian battalion , its personnel were nevertheless recruited from several Australian states : South Australians predominated , but there were also men from Victoria , Tasmania , and Western Australia , with many of the battalion 's cadre staff of officers and senior non commissioned officers having served previously in the Militia with various light horse regiments and infantry battalions . In common with the other Australian machine gun battalions , the colours chosen for the battalion 's Unit Colour Patch ( UCP ) were black and gold . These were presented in a triangular shape with a border of grey . 
 Initially , the battalion was stretched across several locations , with companies being formed in Seymour , Victoria , Brighton , Tasmania , and Northam , Western Australia . The Tasmanians and Western Australians had initially been intended to join the 2 / 2nd Machine Gun Battalion , and during its formative period , the companies completed basic training in their home locations , before concentrating together at <unk> , South Australia with the Tasmanians sailing to Melbourne to link up with Victorians prior to <unk> for the journey west , while the Western Australians crossed the Nullarbor Plain . At this point , the unit 's establishment was completed , as the battalion structure was finalised . It was structured along the same lines as the other 2nd AIF machine gun battalions , which consisted of between 800 and 900 personnel organised into a headquarters element consisting of three platoons – signals , anti @-@ aircraft and administration – and four machine gun companies , each equipped with 12 Vickers machine guns , to make a total of 48 across the entire battalion . Within the machine gun companies there were three platoons ; these were numbered sequentially starting from 1 to 3 in Headquarters Company through to 13 to 15 in ' D ' Company . A Light Aid Detachment of electrical and mechanical engineers was also attached . 
 = = = Fighting against the French : Palestine and Syria = = = 
 In early April 1941 , the battalion , less ' D ' Company which travelled west for home leave , entrained at Oakbank , near to Woodside , South Australia where they had moved the previous February . From there , the battalion travelled overland to Sydney where they embarked upon the SS Ile de France from Pyrmont Wharf , bound for the Middle East , as part of a large convoy of troopships . Sailing via Fremantle where ' D ' Company rejoined the battalion , they sailed on to Colombo , which was reached in late April , where the troopship put in for repairs and shore leave was given to all battalion personnel . Departing again in early May , they continued on alone , crossing the Red Sea in a week and making landfall at Port Tewfik . The troops had to endure a two day wait before disembarkation whereupon they were taken to the eastern side of the Suez Canal by lighter and then transferred by train to Kantara . 
 Upon arrival in the Middle East , the 2 / 3rd was assigned to the 7th Division , the 2nd AIF 's second division – there were also five infantry divisions as part of the Militia at this time , which were reserved for service in Australia and New Guinea – and subsequently joined them in Palestine , establishing a camp at Hill 95 , to the north of Gaza . There the battalion undertook a vigorous physical training regime to regain the fitness lost from the sea voyage . The final elements of unit identity were issued at the time : <unk> and colour patches . It also finally began to receive its vehicles and heavy equipment , including its Vickers machine guns as preparations were made for the battalion to join the fighting in the Western Desert . 
 In the end , this did not eventuate , as the 7th Division was committed to the Syria – Lebanon campaign in early June , to secure the Allied eastern flank from attack . Due to the presence of Vichy French troops , the campaign was politically sensitive and as a result of heavy censorship not widely reported in Australia at the time ; the nature of the fighting , where it was reported , was also downplayed with the Vichy Forces outnumbering the Allies and also being better equipped . For the 2 / 3rd , the campaign saw them heavily involved throughout the short , but sharply contested campaign , with each of the four machine gun companies supporting separate efforts by elements of the 7th Division and also British troops , seeing action around <unk> , Metula , Quneitra , Sidon and Damour before the Vichy French requested an armistice in mid @-@ July . The 2 / 3rd 's casualties during the campaign amounted to one officer and 41 other ranks killed or wounded . In the aftermath of the campaign , the 2 / 3rd stayed on as part of the Allied occupation force established in Syria and Lebanon to defend against a possible drive south by Axis forces through the Caucasus . The battalion defended a position north @-@ east of Beirut , around <unk> , initially but was moved around to various locations including Aleppo , on the Turkish border , throughout the remainder of 1941 . They endured a bitter cold , and snowy , winter at <unk> near Tripoli , which was punctuated by leave drafts to Tel Aviv . 
 = = = Into action against the Japanese : Java and captivity = = = 
 In late 1941 , the Japanese entered the war , attacking Pearl Harbor and launching an invasion of Malaya . Faced with a threat closer to home , the Australian government pressed for the return of its troops from the Middle East , and so in early 1942 the 7th Division began withdrawing from their garrison posts in Syria and Lebanon . The 2 / 3rd left the village of <unk> and moved to a camp at Hill 69 , in Palestine , on 14 January 1942 . They remained there until 31 January when they boarded a train which took them to Kantara where they were ferried across the canal to continue the journey to Port Tewfik where the majority of the battalion , totalling 636 personnel of all ranks , boarded the troopship Orcades . Men who were in the hospital or on course were subsequently reposted to the 2 / 2nd Machine Gun Battalion , and remained in the Middle East , later seeing action at El Alamein . Others who did not board the Orcades included the battalion 's ' B ' Echelon , essentially all its vehicles , baggage and heavy weapons , and its maintenance personnel . These embarked on eight smaller vessels : the Silver Willow , Penrith Castle , Shillong , Tarifa , <unk> , <unk> , Industria and Tricolor . These ships were to follow the Orcades up at its eventual destination , which was at the time , still being kept secret even to the troops on board . 
 The Orcades , a fast transport capable of 26 knots , set sail for Colombo before even the battalion 's baggage could be brought on board . On 8 February 1942 , the ship reached its intermediate destination from where it was escorted by the cruiser HMS Dorsetshire . As the situation in the Pacific worsened for the Allies – Singapore had fallen in early February and the Japanese were steadily advancing through the Netherlands East Indies – the Allies made the decision to hastily make a stand . The Orcades reached Oosthaven , in Sumatra , on 15 February , and the troops from Orcades were ferried ashore on the tanker Van <unk> , where they were grouped together as " Boost Force " under orders to take up the defence of the Palembang airfields and providing protection to civilians as they were evacuated . Missing many of their weapons , the troops were re @-@ equipped with rifles from the Orcades 's armoury . However , shortly after their arrival , they were ordered to re @-@ embark on the tanker , which eventually caught up with Orcades and transferred its personnel for the remainder of the journey to Batavia . There , fresh orders reached them . The units aboard the Orcades – the 2 / 2nd Pioneers as well as an engineer field company , and an anti @-@ aircraft regiment as well as transport and medical personnel – were ordered to form an ad hoc force along with a squadron from the British 3rd The King 's Own Hussars and an artillery battery from the US 131st Field Artillery Regiment . This force , under Blackburn who was promoted to brigadier , came to be known as " Blackforce " , with headquarters being established at Batavia . In Blackburn 's stead , the ' D ' Company commander , Major Edward Lyneham , was promoted to take over command of the battalion . 
 Blackburn established his force into a brigade formation , utilising the pioneers and machine gunners as infantry battalions , and forming a third infantry battalion from troops that were assigned to garrison the base , as well as logistics and administrative personnel , and members of the AIF who had been able to get out of Singapore before it fell . Due to the presence of a large amount of equipment on the wharf , which had been intended to be sent to Singapore before its fall , Blackforce was able to re @-@ equip itself handsomely with vehicles including carriers and armoured cars , Bren guns , Thompson sub @-@ machine guns and mortars ; but there were no machine guns . Concentrating around the civilian airport at <unk> , the battalion formed part of Blackforce 's defensive garrison , tasked with protecting Batavia 's five airfields from Japanese paratroopers ; ' B ' Company was detached in this time to defend the Buitenzorg military airfield . Shortly afterwards , they came under air attack from Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zeroes on 22 February , during which one member of the 2 / 3rd was killed , while six others were wounded . Two of these wounded were later smuggled out of the Indies by medical personnel back to Australia , with one rejoining the battalion there later in the year . As the Japanese began advancing further in the Indies , Blackburn sought to re @-@ orient his troops , and the machine gunners were subsequently moved to the Leuwiliang area , 15 miles ( 24 km ) west of Buitenzorg along an expected main avenue of advance , and they were given the task for defence the bridge over the Tjianten River . 
 Following the Battle of the Java Sea , the Japanese were able to land a force around Banten Bay and Marek , on the western tip of Java , and subsequently began advancing east towards Batavia and Buitenzorg , forcing Blackforce to <unk> itself east of the Tjianten River , to make a stand south of Buitenzorg . On 3 March , the battalion went into action around Leuwiliang for the first time as Dutch troops began to withdraw . Occupying positions in support of the 2 / 2nd Pioneers who held the bridge over the Tjianten River , they were alerted to the advancing Japanese by the presence of fifth columnists , who were seen to be laying out marking panels . A short time later , a force of five Japanese light tanks attempted to cross the river , but were rebuffed by anti @-@ tank rifles and small arms . The plan had been for the Dutch troops to make a stand at <unk> , but faulty intelligence resulted in a rout and the Dutch began to withdraw back to Bandung , flooding through Blackforce 's lines . In the ensuing chaos , Dutch engineers blew up the bridge at the Tjianten River . For the next couple of days , the battalion fought several skirmishes with ' C ' Company bearing the brunt of the Japanese attacks , suffering seven killed and 28 wounded , while inflicting about 200 casualties on the Japanese . As the Allied defence of the island began to collapse , the machine gunners were ordered to hold up the Japanese around Leuwiliang for a day . After this , Blackforce began moving towards <unk> on 5 March , as part of efforts to reach Tjilatjap on the southern coast of the island to secure passage back to Australia . Ultimately , this never eventuated and Blackforce was ordered to surrender on 9 March 1942 following the Dutch capitulation the day before . They would subsequently endure three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years in captivity as Japanese prisoners of war , being sent to camps across south @-@ east Asia , including the infamous Thai – Burma Railway . Forced to endure brutal conditions , over worked in labour camps , and inadequately provided for , casualties amongst these men were high .

 While the troops who had boarded the Orcades went into captivity on Java , the five officers and 257 other ranks that had been transported on the eight smaller ships returned to Australia in the last week of March 1942 . Arriving at Port Adelaide , the battalion 's vehicles , weapons and heavy equipment was moved to Morphettville Racecourse and the remaining personnel concentrated at Sandy Creek . On 15 April 1942 , the order was passed to re @-@ form the battalion , under Lieutenant Colonel Sidney Reed , the battalion 's original second @-@ in @-@ command . Reinforcements arrived from various locations , including the Machine Gun Training Battalion based at Camden , New South Wales , while others came from the 2 / 1st Machine Gun Battalion to provide a cadre of experienced personnel . 
 In May , the battalion moved to Balcombe on the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria , where they undertook range shoots , planning exercises and <unk> . In mid @-@ July , the 2 / 3rd received orders to move north to Cowra by road . Along the way , they stopped at Ingleburn , New South Wales where a draft of almost 400 reinforcements was received ; the result of this was that in its second incarnation , about half the battalion came from New South Wales , instead of South Australia . The battalion remained in Cowra , where they carried out training , for ten months , eventually proceeding north to south @-@ east Queensland in May 1943 . Based around the Deception Bay area , north of Brisbane , a company was deployed to Moreton Island and another to Bribie Island . In late June , ' B ' Company embarked upon the Dutch vessel , the SS <unk> and deployed to Netherlands New Guinea as part of Merauke Force , remaining there in a defensive capacity until May 1944 . 
 While ' B ' Company was deployed to Merauke , the remainder of the battalion moved to the Atherton Tablelands in mid @-@ August 1943 , at which time the battalion was transferred to the command of the 6th Division , assigned as a corps unit rather than a direct command unit . Lieutenant Colonel Roy Gordon , who had raised the original ' C ' Company in 1940 , took over command of the battalion in February 1944 . A long period of relative inactivity subsequently followed as a result of inter @-@ Allied service politics which saw the US Army assume primacy of operations in the Pacific , and indecision about the future role of Australian forces in the Pacific campaign . During this time , the battalion was based around Wondecla , south @-@ west of Cairns . The battalion was transferred to the " tropical war establishment " during this period as part of an Army @-@ wide reorganisation intended to optimise units for jungle warfare . As a result of this change , the battalion was required to return all of its vehicles , with the intention that its guns would largely be carried across the battlefield by soldiers moving on foot . The 2 / 3rd remained at Wondecla until 2 December 1944 , when they entrained for Cairns and subsequently boarded the transport Evangeline , a former cruise ship , bound for New Guinea , where they were to undertake their final campaign of the war . 
 = = = Aitape – Wewak : The final campaign = = = 
 Although it had been intended to deploy the Australians as part of the Allied efforts to recapture the Philippines , this did not eventuate . Instead , the Australian troops were tasked with relieving the US forces around New Guinea , so that they could be redistributed in the Pacific . The 6th Division was subsequently assigned to take over from the US XI Corps around Aitape – Wewak . The campaign that followed was , in the words of author Eustace Keogh , essentially a " mopping up campaign " , with the division being tasked with security of the airstrip and base area , and ensuring that contact was maintained with Japanese forces in the area . These tasks were to be achieved without large @-@ scale offensive action , due to contingency plans for the division to be re @-@ deployed to the Philippines ; in the event this did not occur and the 6th Division remained in Aitape – Wewak for the remainder of the war . 
 With priority of effort being given to the campaigns in the Philippines and Borneo , the arrival of the 6th Division took place over several months . Initially , they were camped around Tadji defending the airfield there , but after Christmas , the majority of the battalion – headquarters , headquarters company and two machine gun companies – was assigned to the 19th Brigade as they advanced west along the coast towards the <unk> , switching to providing support to the 16th Brigade in early January as it drove towards Abau ; in the open country of the coastal area the machine guns proved quite effective . While this took place , ' B ' and ' D ' Companies were assigned to the 17th Brigade , with whom they undertook a mainly defensive role around Aitape , while accompanying infantry patrols into the interior . 
 In February 1945 , as the Australians began advancing into the thick , hilly interior , the utility of the machine guns decreased . At the behest of Brigadier Roy King , commander of the 16th Brigade , the 2 / 3rd Machine Gun Battalion was hastily converted into a standard infantry battalion , which was achieved with a quick issue of rifles , sub @-@ machine guns and mortars . From then until the end of the war , the battalion took part in the ground advance through Wewak and beyond , fighting a series of small scale patrol actions , initially advancing through <unk> and <unk> , and finally the town of But , while ' B ' Company was assigned to Farida Force and carried out an amphibious landing around Dove Bay , in early May . The battalion later moved into the Mandi and Brandi areas where they were tasked with re @-@ invigorating the Australian operations in the area , as Japanese resistance around the plantations increased . By late July , the majority of the battalion moved to Wewak Point , while two companies remained in the vicinity of Mandi – Bandi ; operations in the area had killed 59 Japanese , for the loss of four men from 2 / 3rd killed in action and eight wounded . The battalion 's final action of the war came on 7 August when a patrol killed four Japanese . A week later , the Japanese surrender was announced , bringing combat operations officially to an end . The battalion 's final campaign of the war cost them 94 battle casualties . 
 = = = Disbandment = = = 
 In late August , following the conclusion of hostilities the 2 / 3rd was concentrated at Wewak Point , in the 19th Brigade 's area , where final parades were held and education classes commenced to prepare the soldiers for discharge and return to civilian life . Meanwhile , following the conclusion of hostilities , the battalion 's personnel were slowly transferred to other units or repatriated back to Australia for demobilisation . In early December 1945 , the 2 / 3rd 's remaining personnel returned to Australia aboard the British aircraft carrier HMS Implacable , arriving in Sydney , and the following month , in January 1946 , after final clearances had been obtained the unit was disbanded . During the war the battalion lost 202 men killed or died on active service , of which 56 were killed in action , 139 died while prisoners of war and seven in accidents or illness on active service . Members of the battalion received the following decorations : one Distinguished Service Order , three Military Crosses , four Military Medals , one British Empire Medal and 21 Mentions in Despatches . In addition , one member was appointed as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire and four were appointed as Members of the Order of the British Empire . 
 After the war , the Australian Army moved away from the machine gun battalion construct and consequently no similar units have been raised since , with the role being subsumed into the support companies of individual infantry battalions . The concept was arguably misunderstood by Australian commanders throughout the war , and this may have influenced the decision to move away from the concept . When the units had been established , the intent had been that the machine gun battalions would provide highly mobile fire support ; however , this was largely only applicable in theatres where principles of open warfare could be applied . Once the focus of Australian Army combat operations shifted to the Pacific , the machine gun battalions were largely misused , being employed in a static defensive capacity against short and medium range targets , or for menial tasks , rather than as offensive fire support weapons that could have been employed to provide long range fire support . The medium machine guns were also largely utilised in the same manner as light machine guns , such as the Bren . Other reasons identified for the concept 's limited use include distrust of overhead fire by some commanders , a preference for organic fire support over attached sub @-@ units , over @-@ estimating the difficulty of transporting Vickers guns in the jungle , and a tendency to ignore targets that could not be seen . The difficulties of target acquisition in dense jungle also contributed . For the 2 / 3rd , the Syrian campaign was the only one of its three campaigns where it was employed wholly as a machine gun unit in support of the infantry ; on Java and in Aitape – Wewak , it was utilised as infantry .

Speaking to noted UK R & B writer Pete Lewis of the award @-@ winning Blues & Soul , Ne @-@ Yo explained the thinking behind its title : " To me Year of the Gentleman is all about a persona , a swag and a charm . I made an assessment of the music business . And , in my personal opinion , the essence of the gentleman is absent right now . Everybody kinda looks the same , everybody 's kinda doing the same thing , everybody 's kinda rude and full of themselves . Whereas a gentleman is calm , courteous , kind , charming ... So that title basically represents me trying to lead by example , and showing these cats what it is to be a gentleman in this business still . "

 = George Odlum = 
 George William Odlum ( 24 June 1934 – 28 September 2003 ) was a Saint Lucian left @-@ wing politician who served as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister . Born in Castries , Odlum studied at Bristol University and Oxford University in the United Kingdom before returning to Saint Lucia as Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Trade . After working for the Commonwealth Secretariat and the West Indies Associated States , he formed the Saint Lucia Forum , a left @-@ wing pressure group . This group merged with the Saint Lucia Labour Party in time for the 1974 elections ; although the Party did not win , the progress they made allowed them to take power in 1979 , with Odlum as Deputy Prime Minister . 
 Although a secret agreement originally stated that Odlum would take power after six months , his support for Cuba and similar left @-@ wing nations led to American pressure to keep him out . After months of negotiations , Odlum was dismissed as Deputy Prime Minister , and the ensuing government weakness and infighting led to its defeat in the 1982 election . In opposition , Odlum was made Ambassador to the United Nations , resigning in 1996 . When the Labour Party came to power again a year later , he became Foreign Minister , overseeing the establishment of stronger relations with both Cuba and China . Amidst controversy over his alleged alliance with the opposition , Odlum resigned in 2001 . Never again returning to power , he died on 28 September 2003 following a battle with pancreatic cancer . 
 Odlum 's legacy is controversial : while noted as a skilled orator who cared deeply for Saint Lucia 's working class , his idealism , support for controversial figures such as Muammar Gaddafi and departure from two Labour administrations were noted as factors which harmed him and others around him . Despite this , his funeral saw widespread grieving , with Ralph Gonsalves , the Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines , describing him simply as a " giant of a man " . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Odlum was born on 24 June 1934 in Castries , the son of a barber . He studied economics at Bristol University , becoming the first Afro @-@ Caribbean head of the University of Bristol Union before moving to Magdalen College , Oxford in 1959 , where he studied Philosophy , Politics and Economics and was one of the few Afro @-@ Caribbean students to attend . At university , Odlum acted , played both football and cricket , and became noted as a successful debater . After graduating from Oxford he returned to St Lucia in 1961 , becoming a Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Trade . He moved back to the United Kingdom in 1964 to work as an economist in the Commonwealth Secretariat , leaving 3 years later . Returning to St Lucia again , he became Executive Secretary to the Council of Ministers of the West Indies Associated States . 
 = = Career = = 
 During the early 1960s , St Lucia and the other West Indies Associated States were British colonies , with a limited degree of self @-@ rule . In St Lucia , the Saint Lucia Labour Party was considered the traditional party for " political and constitutional advance " but , despite this , it lost the general election in 1964 to the United Workers Party , a right @-@ wing party led by John Compton that continued to rule until 1979 . In response Odlum , a socialist , founded the Saint Lucia Forum , a pressure group that discussed " the socialist and black cultural ideas which were beginning to challenge the Caribbean status quo " . This was part of a group of Forums established in 1970 following secret talks with other left @-@ wing Caribbean intellectuals , including Maurice Bishop . In 1972 Odlum left his job with the Council of Ministers to form the St Lucia Action Movement , which later merged with a weakened Labour Party in time for the 1974 general election . 
 Odlum 's faction of the Labour Party did most of the work in the election , building their power base among the banana @-@ producing small farmers , with Odlum leading frequent strikes in an attempt to improve working conditions . His work in the 1974 election , along with his " good looks and charisma " , yielded a safe seat in Castries , which he allowed his brother to run for . Odlum instead chose to campaign for a rural seat held by the United Workers Party , which he lost by a small margin . Despite the Labour Party still being in opposition in Saint Lucia , socialism and left @-@ wing politics were on the rise in the Caribbean as a whole and , during his time out of Parliament , Odlum was the public face of socialism in the region . 
 Saint Lucia gained full independence in 1979 . Immediately beforehand , Odlum organised large protests in front of international news cameras , further cementing his role in the region 's communist and socialist movement . Three weeks after independence , the nearby country of Grenada saw the overthrow of its government by communists revolutionaries led by Maurice Bishop . When the United Workers Party called a general election in Saint Lucia three weeks later , Compton 's government fell – Odlum was returned to Parliament and the Labour Party , led by Allan Louisy , came to power . 
 = = = Deputy Prime Minister = = = 
 Odlum 's prominent role within the party led to his immediate appointment as Deputy Prime Minister , with the portfolios of foreign affairs and trade and industry . He publicly supported the Grenadian revolutionaries , who were constructing a new airport with Cuban support . Ronald Reagan alleged that this was to be used as a launching point for Soviet aircraft , and Odlum 's support for it worried both the Americans ( due to their concerns about the purposes of the new facility ) and his fellow communists , who saw him as a " loose cannon " and thought that his continuing public championing of it would further draw American attention . 
 Louisy had become Prime Minister thanks to a secret agreement with Odlum that he would resign , allowing Odlum to take over , within 6 months . When the time came Louisy refused , backed by the Americans , who wanted to keep Odlum out of office at all costs . This saw Odlum turn against his own government and even vote against the budget . A second proposal that Louisy resign was rejected on 30 December 1980 , with the power struggle continuing despite his agreement to hand over some of his portfolios . The dispute continued into 1981 , with Odlum attracting controversy by announcing on 3 March that he had not ignored the possibility of his grouping within the Labour Party splitting and joining the United Workers Party . 
 The result was the 1981 dismissal of Odlum as Deputy Prime Minister and the resignation of Louisy . Louisy was succeeded not by Odlum , but by Winston Cenac , who himself resigned eight months later on 16 January 1982 . Cenac was succeeded by Michael Pilgrim in an attempt by moderates in the Labour Party to avoid the possibility of Odlum leading the country . By this point Odlum had left the party , forming the Progressive Labour Party ( PLP ) . Pilgrim 's government also collapsed , necessitating an early general election in 1982 in which the Labour Party was left with only 3 of the 17 seats , returning the United Workers Party to government and seeing Odlum dismissed from Parliament . His Progressive Labour Party won only a single seat . 
 = = = Ambassador and Foreign Minister = = = 
 Now outside Parliament , Odlum maintained his presence in the public eye through meetings and the work of his newspaper , The Crusader . His revenge over the Labour Party finally occurred during the 1987 general election , when the PLP split the vote and denied his old allies victory . In 1995 he accepted the position of Ambassador to the United Nations from Compton , his old enemy , holding it for only a year . When Compton resigned in 1996 , Odlum chose to stand for election against his successor and lost the contest . 
 After again allying with the Labour Party in 1997 , Odlum was returned to Parliament , receiving appointment as Foreign Minister in the government of Kenny Anthony . In this position , he oversaw the improvement of diplomatic relations with Cuba , announcing that a consulate would be established there and spearheading the signing of a joint Cuban @-@ Saint Lucian trading agreement to oversee improvements in the agricultural and healthcare sectors . Odlum 's ministry also saw the diplomatic recognition of China in 1997 , following month @-@ long negotiations and the offer of several million dollars worth of aid to Saint Lucia . Taiwan responded to the announcement by breaking off relations , stating that the government 's move to recognise China had harmed Taiwan 's " national interests and dignity " . After diplomatic relations were officially established , Odlum visited China between 5 and 12 September . 
 Odlum resigned in 2001 after a series of controversies . His fellow ministers accused him of conspiring against the government and attempting to have it overthrown and replaced with a new administration . Odlum , on the other hand , argued that ruling members of the Labour Party had been making efforts to remove him and that the " dastardly act " of cutting away a significant portion of his constituency in a boundary change was what had forced him over the edge . His resignation came immediately before a letter of dismissal arrived at his house . 
 Odlum formed the National Alliance party to contest the 2001 elections , but the party failed to win any seats . 
 = = Retirement and death = = 
 Odlum attracted controversy in November 2002 when he spoke at the funeral service for Antiguan politician Tim Hector . His speech censured the attendees for what he perceived as mourning Hector in death while failing to support him in life , asking " were you there when the ballot process was contaminated to declare him a loser ? Were you there ? " . His speech was criticised by Vere Bird , Jr . , the Antiguan Minister of Agriculture , Lands and Fisheries , who called Odlum 's words " strident and ill @-@ informed reflections " . 
 Following a long fight against cancer , spending most of the last year of his life in and out of hospital , Odlum died on 28 September 2003 in <unk> Hospital , Castries , aged 69 . The body lay in state on 5 October , where it was viewed by <unk> Louisy , Kenny Anthony , and members of the Cabinet . Odlum 's funeral was held on 6 October , with a 30 @-@ vehicle procession travelling from Vieux Fort to Castries ; it was led by a pair of police outriders and a coach carrying the coffin , draped in the national flag . St Lucian citizens were reported to be openly weeping at Odlum 's death . The funeral itself was held in a park , due to no church in Castries being large enough to hold the number of mourners . During the service , sections of his most famous speeches were broadcast from loudspeakers . James Fletcher , a Cabinet Secretary , had previously announced that all flags would be flown at half @-@ mast for the day as a tribute . 
 Edwin Carrington , the Secretary @-@ General of the Caribbean Community , stated that Odlum " served his country , St Lucia , with distinction " and was " charismatic , eloquent and a consummate master of communication , both in speaking and writing ... one of the region 's leading and most persistent exponents on the debilitating effects of the erosion of trade preferences for the region 's banana industry on the livelihood of the people " . Other tributes came from Ralph Gonsalves , the Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines , who described Odlum as " one of the region 's finest political orators , who was persuasive , eloquent and was able to command attention universally , not only in his native capital city Castries but also at the United Nations , in Geneva , Cape Town or in London " . 
 In 2004 , on the anniversary of his death , a series of activities were organised in memory of Odlum . These included the dedication of a tomb at the Choc Cemetery and a service at the Mount of Prayer in <unk> that was attended by his family and close friends . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Odlum , known simply as " Brother George " , had a controversial legacy . He was noted as one of the region 's greatest orators , able to command attention not only in Saint Lucia itself , but at the United Nations and on the world stage . Supporters praised his connection with the working class , and his fight for better pay and conditions in the agricultural sector . 
 At the same time , both critics and supporters point towards awkward elements of his personality and career . Gonsalves , at his funeral , noted that " the strictures of bureaucratic systems he found difficult to be contained within " , while his obituary in The Times described him as a man " with more flamboyance than substance " . His resignation from the two Labour administrations , as well as his alliances with the <unk> and other factions , were noted as contradictions which would require historical debate and assessment . His support of figures such as Fidel Castro and Muammar Gaddafi was also noted as controversial , with his relentless left @-@ wing approach to politics being identified as damaging both to others and to the causes he championed .

 John Baker White ( August 4 , 1794 – October 9 , 1862 ) was a 19th @-@ century American military officer , lawyer , court clerk , and civil servant in the U.S. state of Virginia . 
 During the War of 1812 , White enlisted in the United States Army as a soldier and was promoted to the military rank of ensign . In 1815 , White was qualified as Clerk of Court for both the county and circuit courts of Hampshire County , Virginia ( now West Virginia ) and he continued to hold these offices through successive appointments and elections for 46 years between 1815 and 1861 . To date , White remains the longest @-@ serving Clerk of Court for Hampshire County since the office 's creation in 1757 . As a prominent lawyer and court clerk , White taught jurisprudence . Many of White 's law students later became eminent lawyers and public officials in their own right , including Henry Bedinger , United States House Representative and United States Ambassador to Denmark . 
 During the American Civil War , White was concerned for the safety of the county 's records and proceeded to load land registration records ledger books onto wagons and had them transported for safekeeping . Because of White 's efforts , Hampshire County land records survived the war , while those records that remained in the courthouse were destroyed . White was threatened by occupying Union Army forces to either vacate his residence in Romney or face arrest because of his Confederate sympathies . White relocated to Richmond and served in the Confederate States Department of the Treasury . 
 White was a member of the White political family of Virginia and West Virginia and was the son of prominent Virginia judge Robert White ( 1759 – 1831 ) and the father of West Virginia Attorney General Robert White ( 1833 – 1915 ) and Hampshire County Clerk of Court Christian Streit White ( 1839 – 1917 ) .

 John Baker White was born on August 4 , 1794 , near Winchester in Frederick County , Virginia . White was the third and youngest child of prominent Virginia General Court judge Robert White ( 1759 – 1831 ) and his wife Arabella Baker . Among his other relations , White was a great @-@ great @-@ nephew of United States House Representative Alexander White ( 1738 – 1804 ) and a great @-@ nephew of another United States House Representative , Francis White ( 1761 – 1826 ) .

 Following his service in the War of 1812 , White settled in Romney , Virginia ( now West Virginia ) where he was appointed as deputy clerk for both the superior court and circuit court in Hampshire County in 1814 . On March 20 , 1815 , White was qualified as Clerk of Court for both the superior and circuit courts of Hampshire County , and he continued to hold these offices through successive appointments and elections for 46 years between 1815 and 1861 .

 = = Academic affairs = = 
 As a prominent lawyer and court clerk , White conducted the teaching of jurisprudence in both his Clerk of Court office and residence , where he allowed his law students to reside during their studies . Many of White 's law students later became eminent lawyers and public officials in their own right , including : Henry Bedinger , United States House Representative and United States Ambassador to Denmark ; James Dillon Armstrong , Hampshire County Circuit Court judge and son of William Armstrong ; Dr. Robert White , Presbyterian minister of Tuscaloosa , Alabama ; and Virginia lawyers Newton Tapscott , Alfred P. White , and Philip B. Streit . 
 In addition to his law instruction , White was an active member of the Romney Literary Society . When the act of incorporation for Romney Academy was amended by the Virginia General Assembly on March 25 , 1839 , White was appointed as a trustee along with other prominent Romney area residents David Gibson , Angus William McDonald , Daniel Mytinger , and John Kern , Jr . The 1839 act authorized any of the five appointed trustees of Romney Academy to fill vacancies on the board " occasioned by death , resignation , removal , or legal disability " , thereby preventing future prolonged vacant trustee seats . 
 = = Business affairs = = 
 By 1839 , White was serving on the board of directors of the Bank of the Valley of Virginia in Romney . During the absence of the board 's president , David Gibson , White served as president pro tempore from November 29 until December 13 , 1839 . The Wirgman Building housed the Bank of the Valley of Virginia during White 's tenure on its board of directors . 
 = = American Civil War = = 
 Prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War , White was in support of preserving the United States . In the United States presidential election of 1860 , White supported Constitutional Union Party presidential candidate John Bell and his running mate Edward Everett . The Constitutional Union Party was formed by former Whig Party members seeking to avoid secessionism over the issue of slavery . In 1861 , White voted for Union candidates to serve as delegates from Hampshire County in the Virginia secession convention , one of which was his son @-@ in @-@ law Colonel E. M. Armstrong . 
 White 's national loyalties shifted following the Battle of Fort Sumter and other Union encroachments into the Confederate States of America , after which White supported the defense of Virginia 's states ' rights and of the United States Constitution . White 's eldest three sons out of four joined the Confederate States Army , and White became active in enlisting and arousing support within Hampshire County for the Confederate States cause . Because of his Confederate sympathies , White was threatened by occupying Union Army forces to either vacate his residence in Romney or face arrest . 
 = = = Preservation of Hampshire County records = = = 
 No court proceedings convened in the county between 1861 and 1864 , and the Hampshire County Courthouse was utilized as a stable by Union soldiers stationed in Romney during the war . In 1861 , Union Army forces under the command of Lew Wallace occupied Romney following a minor battle there during which White " kept close watch over " the county 's record books so that they would not be destroyed by Union forces . Later in the fall of 1861 , Union Army forces under the command of Benjamin Franklin Kelley advanced upon Romney . 
 Upon learning of this , White was again concerned for the safety of the county 's records and proceeded to load land registration records ledger books onto wagons and had them transported to Winchester for safekeeping . White selected for transport only the bound volumes of records which included " deed books , wills , and settlements of estates " and kept the unbound paper records in the courthouse , thus separating them so that the entirety of the county 's records could not be destroyed by Union forces . White likely chose to transport the bound volumes of records , as the loose paper records would have been more cumbersome to keep together . 
 In 1863 , when Winchester was no longer a safe location for the storage of Hampshire County 's records and they again risked destruction by Union Army forces , White 's son Captain Christian Streit White took responsibility for the records and transferred them to Front Royal . When Front Royal became endangered by advancing Union Army forces , Captain White had the records moved to Luray Caverns where they remained for several months . In the fall of 1864 , the county 's record books were rescued by Captain White and his company as Union Army troops were in the process of destroying them . Captain White 's company loaded about 150 record books into a wagon , and they were taken to North Carolina where they remained safely for the duration of the war . Hampshire County 's land records survived and were returned to the courthouse following the conclusion of the American Civil War , likely by a soldier returning to the area from North Carolina . Had White not separated the records and sent the bound volumes away for safekeeping , Hampshire County would have lost all its records during the course of the war , as those that remained in the courthouse were destroyed . 
 In addition to the desecration of the courthouse 's loose paper records , either a Union Army officer or an Indiana unit confiscated an old Scots language Bible belonging to White , which had been passed down to him from his grandfather , John White . The " old Scots Bible " was purportedly taken as punishment against White for his support of the Confederacy . 
 = = = Removal to Richmond = = = 
 White left Romney with his wife and youngest children and traveled to Richmond where he was offered a position in the Confederate States Department of the Treasury within the government of the President of the Confederate States of America , Jefferson Davis . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 White died soon after his arrival in Richmond on October 9 , 1862 . He was interred by Scottish Rite Masons at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond . Distant relative Reverend Moses D. Hoge of the Southern Presbyterian Church , Bishop Duncan of the Methodist Episcopal Church , South , and Bishop <unk> of the Southern Protestant Episcopal Church participated in White 's funeral services . 
 White 's friends and family believed that he " died of grief " caused by the loss of his property in Romney and his concern for the safety of the records in the Hampshire County Courthouse during the conflict . In their History of Hampshire County , West Virginia : From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present ( 1897 ) , West Virginia historians Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher said of White :

 White was married first to Alcinda Louisa Tapscott of Jefferson County , Virginia ( now West Virginia ) , on December 15 , 1815 . Tapscott was White 's cousin through his mother , Arabella Baker White . White and his first wife Alcinda had three children together : 
 White was married for the second time to Frances Ann Streit ( March 19 , 1811 – November 12 , 1866 ) , a daughter of Lutheran Reverend Christian Streit of Winchester , Virginia . Streit and her family were of Swiss descent . White and his second wife , Frances , had ten children ( one of which died in infancy ) : 
 = = = Residence = = = 
 White and his family resided in a large brick mansion located along East Main Street ( Northwestern Turnpike ) which was later known as " Liberty Hall " . Due to his upbringing in an affluent family , White was a person of means from a young age , and in his early adulthood he was able to construct a " large brick mansion " at this location . His original residence was destroyed by fire in 1857 , and White replaced it with a more modest brick edifice where he resided until his departure from Romney in 1861 during the American Civil War . White 's home was a " seat of true old Virginia hospitality " and it was frequented by all socio @-@ cultural strata of Hampshire County and the greater Valley of Virginia region . 
 During the construction of the Northwestern Turnpike through Romney , the state superintendent for the project , Angus William McDonald , proposed building the thoroughfare through White 's garden in front of his residence . White won an appeal in court which caused the turnpike to be rerouted , thus creating the present curve on East Main Street in front of White 's former residence . 
 = Battle of Glenmama = 
 The Battle of Glenn Máma ( Irish : Cath <unk> Máma , The Battle of " The Glen of the Gap " ) or Glenmama was a battle that took place , most probably near Lyons Hill in Ardclough . County Kildare in AD 999 between Windmill Hill and <unk> . It was the decisive and only engagement of the brief Leinster revolt of 999 – 1000 against the King of Munster , Brian Boru . In it , the combined forces of the Kingdoms of Munster and Meath , under King Brian Boru and the High King of Ireland , Máel Sechnaill II , inflicted a crushing defeat on the allied armies of Leinster and Dublin , led by King Máel Mórda of Leinster . 
 The two armies met in a narrow valley , causing a rout of Máel Mórda 's army in at least three directions . They were pursued , and the main body of the army was slaughtered when they rallied at several fording points along the River Liffey . The main commanders were either killed or captured . 
 The battle resulted in the occupation of Dublin by Brian 's Munster forces , and the submission of Máel Mórda and King Sigtrygg Silkbeard of Dublin to Brian Boru . The solution did not prove permanent , however , and eventually resulted in the second Leinster revolt against Brian and the Battle of Clontarf in 1014 . 
 = = Location = = 
 Although nineteenth century scholars , including John O ’ Donovan and Todd , and especially the Dunlavin @-@ based clergyman John Francis Shearman ( in 1830 ) were tempted to locate the battle @-@ site in the vicinity of Dunlavin , Co Wicklow , within their lifetime the theory was disputed by Goddard Orpen , and were disproved by Joseph Lloyd in 1914 and subsequently by <unk> mac <unk> who located the battle site beside Ardclough on the Dublin @-@ Kildare border in 1914 ( he Irish form of Dunlavin is in reality Dun <unk> ) . between Windmill Hill and <unk> . 
 Ailbhe Mac Shamhráin wrote : 
 Given the propensity for battles to take place in border regions , it seems reasonable to seek a location close to the perimeter of the Hiberno @-@ Norse kingdom of Dublin . On that account , the suggestion of Lloyd , which places the battle at a gap now crossed by the Naas Road on the section between Kill and <unk> , is still worthy of consideration . In any event , the engagement took place within an easy day ’ s march of Dublin , as Brian pressed on immediately afterwards to reach the town on the following day .
