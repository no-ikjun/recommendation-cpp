 In total , between 28 October 1940 and 21 September 1942 , 17 anti @-@ Jewish ordinances were proclaimed by the Military Administration . 
 = = = = Association des Juifs en Belgique = = = = 
 The " Association of Jews in Belgium " ( AJB ) was a Judenrat created by the Germans to administer the Jewish population of Belgium from November 1941 . Though directed by the Germans , the AJB was run by Jews and acted as an " organizational ghetto " , allowing the Nazis to deal with Belgian Jews as a unit . The AJB played a major role in registering Jews in the country . In total , 43 @,@ 000 Jews were registered with the AJB . This number represents only half of the total Jewish population , reflecting the community 's mistrust of the organization , but it was the figure that SS @-@ Obersturmbannführer Adolf Eichmann presented as the total number of Jews in Belgium at the Wannsee Conference in January 1942 . 
 During the deportations , around 10 @,@ 000 Jews were arrested based on their affiliation to the AJB . The AJB , closely supervised by the SiPo @-@ SD ( Sicherheitspolizei und Sicherheitsdienst ; " Security Police and Intelligence Service " ) , was also responsible for the administration of the transit camp at Mechelen . The AJB played a major role in persuading Jews to turn up voluntarily for deportation , though whether they knew the fate awaiting the deportees is disputed . From 1942 , following the assassination by the Resistance of Robert Holzinger , an AJB leader , confidence in the association declined and it was regarded with increasing suspicion . 
 After the war , the leaders of the AJB were tried and acquitted of complicity in the Holocaust .

 On 14 April 1941 , after watching the German propaganda film Der Ewige Jude , Flemish paramilitaries from the <unk> , VNV and Algemeene @-@ SS Vlaanderen began a pogrom in the city of Antwerp . The mob , armed with iron bars , attacked and burned two synagogues in the city and threw the Torah scrolls onto the street . They then attacked the home of Marcus <unk> , the town 's chief rabbi . The police and fire brigade were summoned , but they were forbidden to intervene by the German authorities . 
 = = = = Yellow badge = = = = 
 As in the rest of occupied Europe , compulsory wearing of the yellow badge was enforced from 27 May 1942 . The Belgian version of the badge depicted a black letter " J " ( standing for " <unk> " in French and " <unk> " in Dutch ) in the centre of a yellow star of David . The star had to be displayed prominently on all outer clothing when in public and there were harsh penalties for non @-@ compliance . The decree sparked public outrage in Belgium . At great personal risk , the Belgian civil authorities in Brussels and Liège refused to distribute the badge , buying time for many Jews to go into hiding . 
 The German authorities in Antwerp attempted to enforce the wearing of badges in 1940 , but the policy was dropped when non @-@ Jewish citizens protested and wore the armbands themselves . 
 = = = Deportation and extermination , 1942 @-@ 44 = = = 
 From August 1942 , the Germans began deporting Jews , using <unk> ( " recruitment for work " ) in German factories as a pretext . Around half of the Jews turned up voluntarily ( though coerced by the German authorities ) for transportation although round @-@ ups were begun in late July . Later in the war , the Germans increasingly relied on the police to arrest or round up Jews by force . 
 The first convoy from Belgium , carrying stateless Jews , left Mechelen transit camp for Auschwitz on 4 August 1942 and was soon followed by others . These trains left for extermination camps in Eastern Europe . Between October 1942 and January 1943 , deportations were temporarily halted ; by this time 16 @,@ 600 people have been deported on 17 rail convoys . As the result of Queen Elisabeth 's intervention with the German authorities , all of those deported in this first wave were not Belgian citizens . In 1943 , the deportations resumed . By the time that deportations to extermination camps had begun , however , nearly 2 @,@ 250 Belgian Jews had already been deported as forced laborers for Organisation Todt , a civil and military engineering group , which was working on the construction of the Atlantic Wall in Northern France . 
 In September , armed <unk> ( <unk> ; " Currency protection command " ) units raided homes to seize valuables and personal belongings as the occupants were preparing to report to the transit camp , and in the same month , Jews with Belgian citizenship were deported for the first time . <unk> units relied on networks of informants , who were paid between 100 and 200 Belgian francs for each person they betrayed . After the war , the collaborator Felix <unk> stated in his trial that 80 per cent of arrests in Antwerp used information from paid informants . In total , 6 @,@ 000 Jews were deported in 1943 , with another 2 @,@ 700 in 1944 . Transports were halted by the deteriorating situation in occupied Belgium before the liberation . 
 The percentages of Jews which were deported varied by location . It was highest in Antwerp , with 67 per cent deported , but lower in Brussels ( 37 per cent ) , Liège ( 35 per cent ) and Charleroi ( 42 per cent ) . The main destination for the convoys was Auschwitz in German @-@ occupied Poland . Smaller numbers were sent to Buchenwald and Ravensbrück concentration camps , as well as <unk> concentration camp in France . 
 In total , 25 @,@ 437 Jews were deported from Belgium . Only 1 @,@ 207 of these survived the war . Amongst those deported and killed was the surrealist artist Felix Nussbaum in 1944 . 
 = = Belgian collaboration in the Holocaust = = 
 Members of Belgian fascist political parties actively attempted to assist in the deportation of Jews . The VNV and Algemeene @-@ SS Vlaanderen encouraged the deportations , while an association known as La Défense du Peuple / <unk> ( " The People 's Defence " ) was specially formed to bring together Belgian anti @-@ Semites and to assist in the deportations . During the early stages of the occupation , they campaigned for harsher anti @-@ Jewish laws . Both Rex and the VNV routinely published anti @-@ Semitic articles in their party newspapers . 
 Although the Belgian civil authorities ( especially the police and security service ) were officially forbidden to assist the German authorities in anything other than routine maintenance of order , several incidents occurred where individual policemen or police sections assisted in the German arrest of Jews , against orders . In Antwerp , the Belgian authorities facilitated the conscription of Jews for forced labour in France in 1941 and aided in the rounding up of Jews in August 1942 after the SiPo @-@ SD threatened to imprison local officials in Fort Breendonk . Outside Antwerp , the Germans used coercion to force the Belgian police to intervene , and in Brussels at least three police officers disobeyed orders and helped arrest Jews . The historian Insa Meinen argued that around a fifth of the Jews arrested in Belgium were rounded up by the Belgian police . 
 Nevertheless , the general refusal of the Belgian police to assist in the Holocaust has been cited as a reason for the comparatively high survival rate of Belgian Jews during the Holocaust . 
 = = Belgian opposition to Jewish persecution = = 
 Belgian resistance to the treatment of Jews crystallised between August – September 1942 , following the passing of legislation regarding wearing yellow badges and the start of the deportations . When deportations began , Jewish partisans destroyed records of Jews compiled by the AJB . The first organization specifically devoted to hiding Jews , the Comité de Défense des Juifs ( CDJ @-@ <unk> ) , was formed in the summer of 1942 . The CDJ , a left @-@ wing organization , may have saved up to 4 @,@ 000 children and 10 @,@ 000 adults by finding them safe hiding places . It produced two Yiddish language underground newspapers , Unzer Wort ( <unk> @-@ <unk> , " Our Word " , with a Labour @-@ Zionist stance ) and Unzer <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , " Our Fight " , with a Communist one ) . The CDJ was only one of dozens of organised resistance groups that provided support to hidden Jews . Other groups and individual resistance members were responsible for finding hiding places and providing food and forged papers . Many Jews in hiding went on to join organised resistance groups . Groups from left wing backgrounds , like the Front de l 'Indépendance ( FI @-@ OF ) , were particularly popular with Belgian Jews . The Communist @-@ inspired Partisans Armés ( PA ) had a particularly large Jewish section in Brussels . 
 The resistance was responsible for the assassination of Robert Holzinger , the head of the deportation program , in 1942 . Holzinger , an active collaborator , was an Austrian Jew selected by the Germans for the role . The assassination led to a change in leadership of the AJB . Five Jewish leaders , including the head of the AJB , were arrested and interned in Breendonk , but were released after public outcry . A sixth was deported directly to Auschwitz . 
 The Belgian resistance was unusually well informed on the fate of the deported Jews . In August 1942 ( two months after the start of the Belgian deportations ) , the underground newspaper De <unk> reported that " They [ the deported Jews ] are being killed in groups by gas , and others are killed by salvos of machinegun fire . " 
 In early 1943 , the Front de l 'Indépendance sent Victor Martin , an academic economist at the Catholic University of Louvain , to gather information on the fate of deported Belgian Jews using the cover of his research post at the University of Cologne . Martin visited Auschwitz and witnessed the crematoria . Arrested by the Germans , he escaped , and was able to report his findings to the CDJ in May 1943 . 
 = = = Attack on the 20th transport = = = 
 The best @-@ known Belgian resistance action during the Holocaust was the attack on the 20th rail convoy to Auschwitz . In the evening of 19 April 1943 , three poorly armed members of the resistance attacked the railway convoy as it passed near <unk> in Flemish Brabant . The train , containing over 1 @,@ 600 Jews , was guarded by 16 Germans from the SiPo @-@ SD . Resistance members used a lantern covered with red paper ( a danger signal ) to stop the train , and freed 17 prisoners from one wagon before they were discovered by the Germans . A further 200 managed to jump from the train later in the journey , as the train 's Belgian driver deliberately kept his speed low to allow others to escape . All three resistance members responsible for the attack were arrested before the end of the occupation . <unk> <unk> was executed and Jean <unk> and Robert <unk> were deported to concentration camps but survived the war . 
 The attack on the 20th train was the only attack on a Holocaust train from Belgium during the war , as well as the only transport from Belgium to experience a mass breakout . 
 = = = Passive resistance = = = 
 The treatment of Jews by the Germans led to public resistance in Belgium . In June 1942 , the representative of the German Foreign Ministry in Brussels , Werner von Bargen , complained the Belgians did not exhibit " sufficient understanding " of Nazi racial policy . 
 The Belgian underground newspaper La Libre Belgique called for Belgian citizens to make small gestures to show their disgust at the Nazi racial policy . In August 1942 , the paper called for Belgians to " Greet them [ the Jews ] in passing ! Offer them your seat on the tram ! Protest against the barbaric measures that are being applied to them . That 'll make the Boches furious ! " 
 Discrimination against Jews was condemned by many high @-@ profile figures in the occupied country . As early as October 1940 , the senior Catholic clergyman in Belgium , Cardinal Jozef @-@ Ernest van Roey , condemned the German policy and particularly the legislation from 1942 . 
 Van Roey made many of the church 's resources available for hiding Jews , but was prevented from publicly condemning the treatment of the Jews by his peers , who feared a Nazi repression of the Church . German attempts to involve the Belgian authorities and local government in its implementation began to arouse protest from 1942 . The Committee of Secretary @-@ Generals , a panel of Belgian senior civil servants tasked with implementing German demands , refused from the outset to enforce anti @-@ Jewish legislation . In June 1942 , a conference of the 19 mayors of the Greater Brussels region refused to allow its officials to distribute yellow badges to Jews in their districts . At great personal risk , the mayors , led by Joseph Van De <unk> , sent a letter protesting the decree to the German authorities on 5 June . The refusal of Brussels ' council , and later that of the city of Liège , to distribute badges allowed many Jews to go into hiding before the deportations began . 
 In the same year , members of the AJB met with Queen Elisabeth to appeal for her support against the deportations . She appealed to the Military Governor of Belgium , General Alexander von Falkenhausen , who sent Eggert Reeder , his deputy and head of the non @-@ military aspects of the administration , to Berlin to clarify the policy with Reichsführer @-@ SS Heinrich Himmler . The SS @-@ Reichssicherheitshauptamt ( RSHA ; " Reich Main Security Office " ) made concessions to Elisabeth , allowing Jews with Belgian citizenship to be exempt from deportation , and Jewish families would not be broken up . The RSHA also agreed not to deport Jewish men over the age of 65 and women over 60 , after Belgian protests that they would be too old to be used as forced labor . 
 = = Legacy and remembrance = = 
 In the aftermath of the war , emigration to Israel further decreased the Jewish population of Belgium , which as of 2011 was estimated at between 30 @,@ 000 and 40 @,@ 000 . The population is still concentrated in Brussels and Antwerp , but new smaller communities ( such as those in Ghent , <unk> , Waterloo and Arlon ) have developed since 1945 . Notable Belgian Holocaust survivors include François Englert , a joint recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2013 , and Paul Lévy , a well @-@ known journalist ( who converted to Christianity ) who was also responsible for the design of the European flag . 
 Since the passing of the Holocaust denial law in 1995 , it is illegal to deny or attempt to justify the Holocaust . The act follows the Belgian Anti @-@ Racism Law , passed in 1981 , which led to the establishment of the Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism , which researches racism and anti @-@ Semitism in Belgium as well as aiding victims of discrimination . Breendonk and Dossin Barracks ( at the site of the former Mechelen transit camp ) are preserved as museums to the Holocaust and to German repression in Belgium during the occupation . 
 In 2004 , the Belgian Senate commissioned the Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society ( <unk> ) to produce a definitive historical report on Belgian collaboration in the Holocaust . The report , entitled " Docile Belgium " ( La Belgique Docile / <unk> <unk> ) , was published in 2007 . It generated significant public interest in Belgium and abroad . The report 's findings were controversial , as they emphasised the extent to which the Belgian police and authorities had collaborated in the deportation of Jews . 
 As of 2013 , a total of 1 @,@ 612 Belgians have been awarded the distinction of Righteous Among the Nations by the State of Israel for risking their lives to save Jews from persecution during the occupation . 
 = Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd = 
 Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Baxter Healthcare Pty Ltd ( Baxter ) was a decision of the High Court of Australia , which ruled on 29 August 2007 that Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited , a tenderer for various government contracts , was bound by the Trade Practices Act 1974 ( TPA , Australian legislation governing anti @-@ competitive behaviour ) in its trade and commerce in tendering for government contracts . More generally , the case concerned the principles of derivative governmental immunity : whether the immunity of a government from a statute extends to third parties that conduct business with the government . 
 The High Court 's judgment marked a successful appeal for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission , the Australian regulator of anti @-@ competitive conduct , having lost at first instance and on appeal in the Federal Court of Australia . The ACCC was again successful when the case was remitted to the Federal Court for reconsideration , ending eight years of litigation between the parties . The High Court 's judgment was received as a significant precedent in the law of derivative governmental immunity in Australia . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Facts = = = 
 Baxter Healthcare Proprietary Limited ( Baxter ) , was the Australian subsidiary of the multinational health care company Baxter International . Baxter manufactured intravenous ( IV ) and peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) fluids at various plants in Australia . Because of the cost of importing sterile IV fluids and the absence of a rival domestic producer , Baxter was a monopoly supplier of sterile IV fluids in the Australian market . Its monopoly covered large volume parenteral fluids , irrigating solutions and parenteral nutrition fluids . However , Baxter faced competition in the market for peritoneal dialysis fluids ( PD fluids ) . 
 A number of state governments issued requests for tender for the supply of sterile fluids and PD fluids . Baxter responded to the requests with tenders that put forward two alternative pricing options : either a state could purchase sterile fluids and PD fluids as a bundled package at a discounted rate , or the state could buy each product separately but at a higher rate . 
 = = = Legislation = = = 
 Section 46 of the TPA prohibited corporations from misusing market power . Section 47 prohibited exclusive dealing . The critical provision to the case was Section 2B of the TPA . Section 2B provided that Sections 46 and 47 of the TPA : 
 bind the Crown in right of each of the States , of the Northern Territory and of the Australian Capital Territory , so far as the Crown carries on a business , either directly or by an authority of the State or Territory 
 Section 2B thus provided an immunity from state and territory governments from Sections 46 and 47 of the TPA insofar as the governments were not carrying on a business . 
 = = = The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission = = = 
 The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ( ACCC ) , the Australian government authority responsible for regulating the TPA , commenced an action in the Federal Court of Australia seeking declarations that Baxter 's bundling pricing structure in its tenders had contravened Sections 46 and 47 of the TPA . The ACCC sought the imposition of injunctions and pecuniary penalties by the court . 
 = = = Derivative governmental immunity before Baxter = = = 
 Derivative governmental immunity refers to the extension of a government 's immunity from a statute to a non @-@ government party on the basis the government would be affected if the statute was to apply to the other party . 
 Prior to Baxter , the leading case on derivative governmental immunity in Australia was the 1979 High Court judgment in Bradken Consolidated Ltd v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd . In Bradken , the High Court upheld a claim for derivative governmental immunity by equipment suppliers to the Queensland Commissioner for Railways . The majority 's conclusion was that if the Queensland government was immune from the TPA , it would prejudice the Queensland government if the contracts and arrangements it entered were subject to the TPA through the other parties to the contracts and arrangements . 
 Bradken 's application of the principle of derivative governmental immunity had been subject to criticism . Robertson Wright SC , a Senior Counsel specialising in competition and trade practices law , argued there are " a number of difficulties " with the judgment , including the " unsatisfactory nature " of the authorities it relied on . The High Court 's judgment in Baxter would mark a retreat from Bradken . 
 = = = Federal Court litigation = = = 
 The ACCC conceded that the state governments were not carrying on businesses in procuring the medical products . This meant that the governments were immune from Sections 46 and 47 of the TPA . Baxter argued that this immunity extended to itself , by claiming derivative governmental immunity . On 16 May 2005 , The Federal Court of Australia ( Allsop J presiding ) found in Baxter 's favour at first instance . While the court held that Baxter would have breached the TPA , governmental immunity under Section 2B extended to Baxter Healthcare . Allsop J 's judgment was upheld unanimously on appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court ( Justices Mansfield , Dowsett and Gyles presiding ) . The full bench expressed unease about its own judgment , stating that the question of derivative governmental immunity should be left to the High Court for reconsideration of Bradken . 
 = = High Court appeal = = 
 The ACCC was granted special leave to appeal to the High Court against the judgment of the full bench of the Federal Court . The appeal was heard on 16 May 2007 . The Australian Government Solicitor acted for the ACCC , with Lindsay Foster as Senior Counsel ; Blake Dawson and David Yates SC represented Baxter . In addition to Baxter , the states of Western Australia , South Australia and New South Wales were respondents to the appeal . The High Court decided on 29 August 2007 , by a 6 – 1 majority , to allow the ACCC 's appeal and remit the matter back to the full bench of Federal Court for reconsideration . The majority held that Baxter was not covered by derivative governmental immunity in its dealings with the state governments . 
 = = = Judgments = = = 
 = = = = Joint judgment = = = = 
 Five judges ( Chief Justice Gleeson and Justices Gummow , Hayne , Heydon and <unk> ) joined in the leading majority judgment allowing the ACCC 's appeal . The joint judgment reasoned that Parliament could not have intended for corporations that do business with the government to be exempt from the restrictive trade practices provisions in Part IV of the TPA in respect of that business . Emphasising the overall purpose of the TPA , the judges reasoned that the purpose would not be fulfilled if Baxter could claim derivative immunity . In response to the concern that one party to a transaction ( the government ) would be immune from the TPA while the other party would be bound by it , the joint judgment reasoned there was " nothing unusual " about such an outcome . 
 The joint judgment did not rule out derivative governmental immunity in all cases . In determining the scope of whether governmental immunity from a statutory provision extends to a party dealing with the government , the judgment adopted the following position of Justice Kitto , then dissenting , in the 1955 High Court case of Wynyard Investments v Commissioner for Railways ( NSW ) : 
 The object in view is to ascertain whether the Crown has such an interest in that which would be interfered with if the provision in question were held to bind the corporation that the interference would be , for a legal reason , an interference with some right , interest , power , authority , privilege , immunity or purpose belonging or appertaining to the Crown . 
 Wynyard Investments was a case about governmental immunity generally ( not derivative governmental immunity specifically ) , but Justice Kitto 's dissenting judgment extended to derivative governmental immunity . 
 Having examined the characteristics of the TPA as a law to promote competitive behaviour , the joint judgment held that the extension of derivative governmental immunity from the TPA to a trading corporation would be a " remarkable " conclusion and " far beyond what is necessary to protect the legal rights of governments , or to prevent a divesting of proprietary , contractual or other legal rights and interests . " 
 = = = = Kirby J = = = = 
 Justice Kirby 's judgment agreed with the outcome of the joint judgment , for different reasons . Kirby criticised the concept of governmental immunity itself , stating that " persisting with [ governmental immunity ] into the twenty @-@ first century is unacceptable . "

 Justice Callinan dissented from the majority , holding that derivative governmental immunity extended to Baxter . Callinan followed Bradken , concluding that it remained authoritative . 
 = = Reaction to judgment = = 
 = = = Significance = = = 
 Robertson Wright , writing after the judgment was handed down , claimed that Baxter represented a change to the law , drawing the following conclusions from the judgment : 
 The application of derivative governmental immunity depends on a construction of the particular statute ( particularly the object and purpose of the statute ) . 
 As a general rule , derivative governmental immunity applies if the statute 's coverage of a person would divest the government of proprietary , contractual , or other legal rights or interests ( as opposed to commercial or policy rights or interests ) . 
 The judgment was reported in the press as a significant legal victory for the ACCC . The judgment was also received as an " historic decision " setting a precedent for government procurement , on the basis that businesses might no longer be able to rely on immunity from the TPA when contracting with governments . 
 = = = Criticism = = = 
 Nicholas Seddon , a lawyer and academic specialising in commercial and government law , claimed the High Court 's judgment leaves " many uncertainties " , particularly regarding whether derivative governmental immunity will extend to private sector providers carrying out governmental functions that have been contracted to them ( as opposed to merely providing goods or services to the government ) . Robertson Wright echoed these concerns , arguing the joint judgment did not " set out in as helpful detail " as it might the factors to be taken into account in deciding whether governmental immunity will derive to a party dealing with the government . Seddon also criticised the outcome of the case itself , arguing it is " difficult to see how derivative immunity does not inevitably flow " from the governmental immunity from the TPA . He suggested that the application of the TPA to a party that deals with a government compromises the intention of Parliament that State and Territory governments should be immune from the TPA . 
 = = Later action = = 
 The ACCC was successful , by a 2 – 1 majority , upon the <unk> of the case to the full bench of the Federal Court . The full bench found that Baxter contravened Sections 46 and 47 of the TPA . That judgment ended the eight @-@ year @-@ long litigation between Baxter and the ACCC . It was the first time in over 10 years that a corporation had unsuccessfully defended a prosecution brought by the ACCC for an alleged contravention of Section 46 . The full bench declared that Baxter breached Sections 46 and 47 of the TPA , but left it to the ACCC to seek pecuniary penalties . Baxter was refused special leave to appeal to the High Court against the full bench 's judgment .

 The cane cholla ( or walking stick cholla , tree cholla , <unk> cactus , etc . ) ( Cylindropuntia imbricata ) is a cactus found in the Southwestern United States and northern Mexico , including some cooler regions in comparison to many other cacti . It occurs primarily in the arid regions of the Southwestern United States in the states of Oklahoma , Texas , New Mexico , Arizona and Nevada . It is often conspicuous because of its shrubby or even tree @-@ like size , its silhouette , and its long @-@ lasting yellowish fruits . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The cane cholla 's range is the arid regions of Nevada , Arizona , New Mexico , Oklahoma , and Texas , south to Durango , Zacatecas , and San Luis Potosí . It occurs at altitudes from 1 @,@ 200 to 2 @,@ 300 m ( 3 @,@ 900 to 7 @,@ 500 ft ) and is hardy for a cactus ( USDA Zone 5A ) . 
 In parts of its range , often just below the pinyon @-@ juniper belt , it can be abundant , surrounded by low grasses and forbs that are brown most of the year ; in such places <unk> are conspicuous as the only tall green plant . Plants may form thickets or be spaced at a few times their width in " gardens " . 
 The species is naturalised in Australia in old mining localities and along watercourses . It is known there by the common names of Devil 's rope cactus or Devil 's rope pear . It is a declared noxious weed in New South Wales and also occurs in Queensland , Victoria and South Australia . 
 = = Description = = 
 The above @-@ ground part consists of much @-@ branched cylindrical stems , the end joints being about 3 cm in diameter . The joints , unlike those of some <unk> , are hard to detach . The stems are highly tubercular ( lumpy ) with a pattern of long oval lumps . A typical height is about 1 m , but exceptionally it can grow to 4 @.@ 6 m ( 15 ft ) with a " trunk " diameter of 25 cm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) . The width is often similar to or somewhat greater than the height . The stems are armed with clusters of up to about 10 red to pink spines , which may be 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) long and are barbed and sharp enough to easily penetrate leather gardening gloves . The stems and fruits also have many spines or " <unk> " about 1 mm long that can detach and stick in the skin . 
 There are two kinds of stems or " cladodes " : long <unk> , bearing flowers at the ends and falling off after a few years , and long orthotropic , primarily serving for support and transport and staying on the plant . <unk> stems grow in a <unk> or crown @-@ like pattern around a central orthotropic stem . This species blooms in late spring or early summer . The flowers are purple or magenta , rarely rose @-@ pink , about 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) wide . The fruits are yellowish , tubercular like the stems , and shaped something like the frustum of a cone , with a hollow at the wide end where the flower fell off ; they are often mistaken for flowers . The plant retains them all winter . They are dry and not tasty , though the Indians of Arizona and New Mexico are said to have eaten them . 
 In addition to sexual reproduction , the tree cholla reproduces when stem joints fall to the ground and take root . Thus this species spreads and its spread is hard to control , especially where animals defecate seeds and carry stem joints stuck to their hide some distance from the parent plant . ( Some cows , " cholla eaters " , learn to eat cholla fruits despite the pain . ) " Waves of invasion " typically occur four or five years after drought combined with grazing , probably because this combination exposes soil on which the stem joints can take root . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 The fruits are also eaten by various wild birds and mammals , including pronghorn , desert bighorn sheep , and deer . The thorny plants provide escape for cover for many small animals . 
 The leafcutter bee <unk> apicalis has been observed to pollinate the flowers . 
 = = Uses = = 
 The plants are sometimes grown as ornamentals . Dead stems decay to leave a hollow wooden tube with a pattern of lengthwise slits . These are sometimes used as canes or to make curios . The Roman Catholic <unk> of New Mexico formerly tied fresh stems to their bare backs in Holy Week processions . The Zuni people use the imbricata variety ceremonially .

 = Sid Meier 's Alpha Centauri = 
 Sid Meier 's Alpha Centauri is a video game in the 4X genre which is considered a spiritual sequel to the Civilization series . Set in a science fiction depiction of the 22nd century , the game begins as seven competing ideological factions land on the planet Chiron ( " Planet " ) in the Alpha Centauri star system . As the game progresses , Planet 's growing sentience becomes a formidable obstacle to the human colonists . 
 Sid Meier , designer of Civilization , and Brian Reynolds , designer of Civilization II , developed Alpha Centauri after they left MicroProse to join the newly created developer Firaxis Games . Electronic Arts released both Alpha Centauri and its expansion , Sid Meier 's Alien Crossfire , in 1999 . The following year , Aspyr Media ported both titles to Mac OS while Loki Software ported them to Linux . 
 Alpha Centauri features improvements on Civilization II 's game engine , including simultaneous <unk> , social engineering , climate , customizable units , alien native life , additional diplomatic and spy options , additional ways to win , and greater mod @-@ ability . Alien Crossfire introduces five new human and two non @-@ human factions , as well as additional technologies , facilities , secret projects , native life , unit abilities , and a victory condition . 
 The game received wide critical acclaim , being compared favorably to Civilization II . Critics praised its science fiction storyline ( comparing the plot to works by Stanley Kubrick , Frank Herbert , Arthur C. Clarke , and Isaac Asimov ) , the in @-@ game writing , the voice acting , the user @-@ created custom units , and the depth of the technology tree . Alpha Centauri also won several awards for best game of the year and best strategy game of the year . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 = = = Setting = = = 
 Space @-@ race victories in the Civilization series conclude with a journey to Alpha Centauri . Beginning with that premise the Alpha Centauri narrative starts in the 22nd century , after the United Nations sends " Unity " , a colonization mission , to Alpha Centauri 's planet Chiron ( " Planet " ) . Unbeknownst to humans , advanced extraterrestrials ( " Progenitors " ) had been conducting experiments in vast distributed nervous systems , culminating in planetary biosphere @-@ sized <unk> nervous system ( " Manifold " ) on Chiron , leaving behind monoliths and artifacts on Planet to guide and examine the system 's growth . Immediately prior to the start of the game , a reactor malfunction on the Unity spacecraft wakes the crew and colonists early and irreparably severs communications with Earth . After the captain is assassinated , the most powerful leaders on board build ideological factions with dedicated followers , conflicting agendas for the future of mankind , and " desperately serious " commitments . As the ship breaks up , seven escape pods , each containing a faction , are scattered across Planet . 
 In the Alien Crossfire expansion pack , it is learned that earlier alien experiments had led to disastrous consequences at Tau Ceti , creating a hundred @-@ million @-@ year evolutionary cycle that ended with the eradication of most complex animal life in several neighbouring inhabited star systems . After the disaster ( referred to by Progenitors as " Tau Ceti Flowering " ) , the Progenitors split into two factions : Manifold Caretakers , opposed to further experimentation and dedicated to preventing another Flowering ; and Manifold Usurpers , favoring further experimentation and intending to induce a controlled Flowering in Alpha Centauri 's Planet . In Alien Crossfire , these factions compete along with the human factions for control over the destiny of Planet . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The game focuses on the leaders of seven factions , chosen by the player from the 14 possible leaders in Alpha Centauri and Alien Crossfire , and Planet ( voiced by Alena <unk> ) . The characters are developed from the faction leaders ' portraits , the spoken monologues accompanying scientific discoveries and the " photographs in the corner of a <unk> – home towns , first steps , first loves , family , graduation , spacewalk . " The leaders in Alpha Centauri comprise : Lady Deirdre Skye , a Scottish activist ( voiced by Carolyn Dahl ) , of Gaia 's <unk> ; Chairman Sheng @-@ Ji Yang , a Chinese Legalist official ( voiced by Lu Yu ) , of the Human Hive ; Academician <unk> Zakharov , a Russian academic ( voiced by Yuri <unk> ) of the University of Planet ; CEO <unk> Morgan , a Namibian businessman ( voiced by <unk> Davis ) , of Morgan Industries ; Colonel Corazon Santiago , a Puerto Rican <unk> ( voiced by Wanda Niño ) , of the Spartan Federation ; Sister Miriam Godwinson , an American minister and social psychologist ( voiced by Gretchen Weigel ) , of the Lord 's Believers ; and Commissioner Pravin Lal , an Indian surgeon and diplomat ( voiced by Hesh Gordon ) , of the Peacekeeping Forces . 
 The player controls one of the leaders and competes against the others to colonize and conquer Planet . The <unk> ( voiced by Robert Levy and Katherine Ferguson ) are minor characters who provide information to the player . Each faction excels at one or two important aspects of the game and follows a distinct philosophical belief , such as technological utopianism , Conclave Christianity , " free @-@ market " capitalism , militarist survivalism , Chinese Legalism , U.N. Charter humanitarianism , or Environmentalist Gaia philosophy . The game takes place on Planet , with its " rolling red ochre plains " and " bands of lonely terraformed green " . 
 The seven additional faction leaders in Alien Crossfire are Prime Function Aki Zeta @-@ Five , a Norwegian research assistant @-@ turned @-@ cyborg ( voiced by Allie <unk> ) , of The Cybernetic Consciousness ; Captain Ulrik <unk> , an American fisherman and naval officer ( voiced by James Liebman ) , of The Nautilus Pirates ; Foreman <unk> , an Australian labor leader ( voiced by Frederick Serafin ) , of The Free Drones ; <unk> <unk> Roze , a Trinidadian hacker ( voiced by Christine Melton ) , of The Data Angels ; Prophet Cha Dawn , a human born on Planet ( voiced by Stacy Spenser ) of The Cult of Planet ; Guardian <unk> H <unk> , a Progenitor leader ( voiced by Jeff Gordon ) , of The Manifold Caretakers ; and Conqueror <unk> Maar , a Progenitor leader ( voiced by Jeff Gordon ) , of The Manifold Usurpers . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 The story unfolds via the introduction video , explanations of new technologies , videos obtained for completing secret projects , interludes , and cut @-@ scenes . The native life consists primarily of simple wormlike alien parasites and a type of red fungus that spreads rapidly via spores . The fungus is difficult to traverse , provides invisibility for the enemy , provides few resources , and spawns " <unk> " that attack population centres and military units by <unk> parasitising them . <unk> can eventually be captured and bred in captivity and used as terroristic bioweapons , and the player eventually discovers that the fungus and <unk> can think collectively . 
 A voice intrudes into the player 's dreams and soon waking moments , threatening more attacks if the industrial pollution and terraforming by the colonists is not reversed . The player discovers that Planet is a dormant semi @-@ sentient hive organism that will soon experience a metamorphosis which will destroy all human life . To counter this threat , the player or a computer faction builds " The Voice of Alpha Centauri " secret project , which artificially links Planet 's distributed nervous system into the human <unk> , delaying Planet 's metamorphosis into full self @-@ awareness but incidentally increasing its ultimate intelligence substantially by giving it access to all of humanity 's accumulated knowledge . Finally , the player or a computer faction embraces the " Ascent to Transcendence " in which humans too join their brains with the hive organism in its metamorphosis to " godhood " . Thus , Alpha Centauri closes " with a swell of hope and wonder in place of the expected triumphalism " , reassuring " that the events of the game weren ’ t the entirety of mankind ’ s future , but just another step . " 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Alpha Centauri , a turn @-@ based strategy game with a science fiction setting , is played from an isometric perspective . Many game features from Civilization II are present , but renamed or slightly tweaked : players establish bases ( Civilization II 's cities ) , build facilities ( buildings ) and secret projects ( Wonders of the World ) , explore territory , research technology , and conquer other factions ( civilizations ) . In addition to conquering all non @-@ allied factions , players may also win by obtaining votes from three quarters of the total population ( similar to Civilization IV 's Diplomatic victory ) , " cornering the Global Energy Market " , completing the Ascent to Transcendence secret project , or for alien factions , constructing six Subspace Generators . 
 The main map ( the upper two thirds of the screen ) is divided into squares , on which players can establish bases , move units and engage in combat . Through terraforming , players may modify the effects of the individual map squares on movement , combat and resources . Resources are used to feed the population , construct units and facilities , and supply energy . Players can allocate energy between research into new technology and energy reserves . Unlike Civilization II , new technology grants access to additional unit components rather than pre @-@ designed units , allowing players to design and re @-@ design units as their factions ' priorities shift . Energy reserves allow the player to upgrade units , maintain facilities , and attempt to win by the Global Energy Market scenario . Bases are military strongpoints and objectives that are vital for all winning strategies . They produce military units , house the population , collect energy , and build secret projects and Subspace Generators . Facilities and secret projects improve the performance of individual bases and of the entire faction . 
 In addition to terraforming , optimizing individual base performance and building secret projects , players may also benefit their factions through social engineering , probe teams , and diplomacy . Social engineering modifies the ideologically based bonuses and penalties forced by the player 's choice of faction . Probe teams can sabotage and steal information , units , technology , and energy from enemy bases , while diplomacy lets the player create coalitions with other factions . It also allows the trade or transfer of units , bases , technology and energy . The Planetary Council , similar to the United Nations Security Council , takes Planet @-@ wide actions and determines population victories . 
 In addition to futuristic technological advances and secret projects , the game includes alien life , structures and machines . " <unk> " and " sea fungus " provide movement , combat , and resource penalties , as well as concealment for " mind worms " and " spore launchers " . Immobile " fungal towers " spawn native life . Native life , including the seaborne " Isles of the Deep " and " <unk> " and airborne " Locusts of Chiron " , use psionic combat , an alternate form of combat which ignores weapons and armor . <unk> repair units and provide resources ; artifacts yield new technology and hasten secret projects ; landmarks provide resource bonuses ; and random events add danger and opportunity . Excessive development leads to terraforming @-@ destroying fungus blooms and new native life . 
 Alpha Centauri provides a single player mode and supports customization and multiplayer . Players may customize the game by choosing options at the beginning of the game , using the built @-@ in scenario and map editors , and modifying Alpha Centauri 's game files . In addition to a choice of seven ( or 14 in Alien Crossfire ) factions , pre @-@ game options include scenario game , customized random map , difficulty level , and game rules that include victory conditions , research control , and initial map knowledge . The scenario and map editors allow players to create customized scenarios and maps . The game 's basic rules , diplomatic dialog , and the factions ' starting abilities are in text files , which " the designers have done their best to make it reasonably easy to modify ... , even for non @-@ programmers . " Alpha Centauri supports play by email ( " <unk> " ) and TCP / IP mode featuring simultaneous movement , and introduces direct player @-@ to @-@ player negotiation , allowing the unconstrained trade of technology , energy , maps , and other elements .

 = = = Inspirations = = = 
 In 1996 , MicroProse released the lauded Civilization II , designed by Brian Reynolds . However , the firm 's management had changed and moved to California by the time the game shipped , and disagreements between the new management and its employees prompted Reynolds , Jeff Briggs , and Sid Meier ( designer of the original Civilization ) to leave MicroProse and found Firaxis . Although unable to use the same IP as Civilization II , the new company felt that players wanted " a new sweeping epic of a turn @-@ based game " . Having just completed a game of human history up to the present , they wanted a fresh topic and chose science fiction . 
 With no previous experience in science fiction games , the developers believed future history was a fitting first foray . For the elements of exploring and terraforming an alien world , they chose a plausible near future situation of a human mission to colonize the solar system 's nearest neighbour and human factions . Reynolds researched science fiction for the game 's writing . His inspiration included " classic works of science fiction " , including Frank Herbert 's The Jesus Incident , A Fire Upon the Deep by Vernor Vinge , and The Mote in God 's Eye by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle for alien races ; Kim Stanley Robinson 's Red Mars , Slant by Greg Bear , and Stephen R. Donaldson 's The Real Story for future technology and science ; and Dune by Herbert and Bear 's Anvil of Stars for negative interactions between humans . 
 Alpha Centauri set out to capture the whole sweep of humanity 's future , including technology , futuristic warfare , social and economic development , the future of the human condition , spirituality , and philosophy . Reynolds also said that " getting philosophy into the game " was one of the attractions of the game . Believing good science fiction thrives on constraint , the developers began with near @-@ future technologies . As they proceeded into the future , they tried to present a coherent , logical , and detailed picture of future developments in physics , biology , information technology , economics , society , government , and philosophy . Alien ecologies and mysterious intelligences were incorporated into Alpha Centauri as external " natural forces " intended to serve as flywheels for the backstory and a catalyst for many player intelligences . Chris Pine , creator of the in @-@ game map of Planet , strove to make Planet look like a real planet , which resulted in evidence of tectonic action . Another concern was that Planet matched the story , which resulted in the fungus being connected across continents , as it is supposed to be a gigantic neural network . 
 <unk> is a natural outgrowth of colonizing an alien world . The first playable prototype was just a map generator that tested climate changes during the game . This required the designers to create a world builder program and climatic model far more powerful than anything they 'd done before . Temperature , wind , and rainfall patterns were modeled in ways that allow players to make changes : for example , creating a ridge @-@ line and then watching the effects . In addition to raising terrain , the player can also divert rivers , dig huge boreholes into the planet 's mantle , and melt ice caps . 
 In addition to scientific advances , the designers speculated on the future development of human society . The designers allow the player to decide on a whole series of value choices and choose a " ruthless " , " moderate " , or " idealistic " stance . Reynolds said the designers don 't promote a single " right " answer , instead giving each value choice positive and negative consequences . This design was intended to force the player to " think " and make the game " addictive " . He also commented that Alpha Centauri 's fictional nature allowed them to draw their characters " a lot more sharply and distinctly than the natural blurring and <unk> of history " .

 In July 1996 , Firaxis began work on Alpha Centauri , with Reynolds heading the project . Meier and Reynolds wrote playable prototype code and Jason Coleman wrote the first lines of the development libraries . Because the development of Gettysburg took up most of Firaxis ' time , the designers spent the first year prototyping the basic ideas . By late 1996 , the developers were playing games on the prototype , and by the middle of the next year , they were working on a multiplayer engine . Although Firaxis intended to include multiplayer support in its games , an important goal was to create games with depth and longevity in single @-@ player mode because they believed that the majority of players spend most of their time playing this way . Reynolds felt that smart computer opponents are an integral part of a classic computer game , and considered it a challenge to make them so . Reynolds ' previous games omitted internet support because he believed that complex turn @-@ based games with many player options and opportunities for player input are difficult to facilitate online . 
 Reynolds said that the most important principle of game design is for the designer to play the game as it is developed ; Reynolds claimed that this was how a good artificial intelligence ( AI ) was built . To this end , he would track the decisions he made and why he made them as he played the game . The designer also watched what the computer players did , noting " dumb " actions and trying to discover why the computer made them . Reynolds then taught the computer his reasoning process so the AI could find the right choice when presented several attractive possibilities . He said the AI for diplomatic personalities was the best he had done up to that point . 
 Doug Kaufman , a co @-@ designer of Civilization II , was invited to join development as a game balancer . Reynolds cited the Alpha Centauri 's balance for the greater sense of urgency and the more pressing pacing than in his earlier game , Sid Meier 's Colonization . According to producer Timothy Train , in designing the strengths and weaknesses of the factions , the goal was to suggest , without requiring , certain strategies and give the player interesting and fun things to do without unbalancing the game . He didn 't want a faction to be dependent on its strength or a faction 's power to be dominant over the rest . Train felt that fun meant the factions always have something fun to do with their attributes . 
 Around the summer of 1997 , the staff began research on the scientific realities involved in interstellar travel . In late 1997 , Bing Gordon — then Chief Creative Officer of Electronic Arts — joined the team , and was responsible for the Planetary Council , extensive diplomacy , and landmarks . A few months before the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) , the team incorporated the Explore / Discover / Build / Conquer marketing campaign into the game . The game was announced in May 1998 at E3 . 
 In the latter half of 1998 , the team produced a polished and integrated interface , wrote the game manual and foreign language translations , painted the faction leader portraits and terrain , built the 3D vehicles and vehicle parts , and created the music . Michael Ely directed the Secret Project movies and cast the faction leaders . 25 volunteers participated in Firaxis ' first public beta test . The beta testers suggested the Diplomatic and Economic victories and the Random Events . 
 There were a lot of " firsts " for our team in the making of Alpha Centauri . We had never done a public beta test before Alpha Centauri , and this was also the first time we released a demo before the game was out . Since we 'd not done one before , we didn 't know exactly what to expect when we released it , but it turned out to fit right in with Firaxis ' iterative design method . 
 The design team started with a very simple playable game . They strengthen the " fun " aspects and fixed or removed the unenjoyable ones , a process Sid Meier called " surrounding the fun " . After the revision , they played it again , repeating the cycle of revision and play . Playing the game repeatedly and in @-@ depth was a rule at Firaxis . In the single @-@ player mode , the team tried extreme strategies to find any sure @-@ fire paths to victory and to see how often a particular computer faction ends up at the bottom . The goal was a product of unprecedented depth , scope , longevity , and addictiveness , where the player is always challenged by the game to come up with new strategies with no all @-@ powerful factions or unstoppable tactics . According to Reynolds , the process has been around since Sid Meier 's early days at <unk> . At Firaxis , as iterations continue , they expand the group giving feedback , bringing in outside gamers with fresh perspectives . Alpha Centauri was the first Firaxis game with public beta testers . 
 Finally , Brian Reynolds discussed the use of the demo in the development process . Originally a marketing tool released prior to the game , they started getting feedback . They were able to incorporate many suggestions into the retail version . According to Brian Reynolds , they made improvement in the game 's interface , added a couple of new features and fixed a few glitches . They also improved some rules , fine @-@ tuned the game balance and improved the AI . Finally , he adds that they continued to add patches to enhance the game after the game was released . In the months leading to the release of Alpha Centauri , multimedia producer Michael Ely wrote the 35 weekly episodes of Journey to Centauri detailing the splintering of the U.N. mission to Alpha Centauri . 
 = = = Alien Crossfire = = = 
 A month after Alpha Centauri 's February 1999 release , the Firaxis team began work on the expansion pack , Sid Meier 's Alien Crossfire . Alien Crossfire features seven new factions ( two that are non @-@ human ) , new technologies , new facilities , new secret projects , new alien life forms , new unit special abilities , new victory conditions ( including the new " Progenitor Victory " ) and several additional concepts and strategies . The development team included Train as producer and designer , Chris Pine as programmer , Jerome <unk> and Greg Foertsch as artists , and Doug Kaufman as co @-@ designer and game balancer . 
 The team considered several ideas , including a return to a post @-@ apocalyptic earth and the conquest of another planet in the Alpha Centauri system , before deciding to keep the new title on Planet . The premise allowed them to mix and match old and new characters and delve into the mysteries of the monoliths and alien artifacts . The backstory evolved quickly , and the main conflict centered on the return of the original alien inhabitants . The idea of humans inadvertently caught up in an off @-@ world civil war focused the story . 
 Train wanted to improve the " build " aspects , feeling that the god @-@ game genre had always been heavily slanted towards the " Conquer " end of the spectrum . He wanted to provide " builders " with the tools to construct an empire in the face of heated competition . The internet community provided " invaluable " feedback . The first " call for features " was posted around April 1999 and produced the <unk> Defense System , Algorithmic Enhancement , and The Nethack Terminus . 
 The team had several goals : factions should not be " locked @-@ in " to certain strategies ; players should have interesting things to do without unbalancing the game , and the factions must be fun to play . The team believed the " coolness " of the Progenitor aliens would determine the success or failure of Alien Crossfire . They strove to make them feel significantly different to play , but still compatible with the existing game mechanics . The developers eventually provided the aliens with Battle Ogres , a Planetary survey , non @-@ blind research , and other powers to produce " a nasty and potent race that would take the combined might of humanity to bring them down " . Chris Pine modified the AI to account for the additions . The team also used artwork , sound effects , music , and diplomatic text to set the aliens apart . Other than the aliens , the Pirates proved to be the toughest faction to balance because their ocean start gave them huge advantages . 
 Upon completion , the team felt that Alien Crossfire was somewhere between an expansion and a full @-@ blown sequel . In the months leading to the release of Alien Crossfire , multimedia producer Michael Ely wrote the 9 episodes of Centauri : Arrival , introducing the Alien Crossfire factions . The game initially had a single production run . Electronic Arts bundled Alpha Centauri and Alien Crossfire in the Alpha Centauri Planetary Pack in 2000 and included both games in The Laptop Collection in 2003 . In 2000 , both Alpha Centauri and Alien Crossfire were ported to Mac OS by Aspyr Media and to Linux by Loki Software . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Alpha Centauri received wide critical acclaim upon its release , with reviewers voicing respect for the game 's pedigree , especially that of Reynolds and Meier . The video game review aggregator websites Game Rankings and Metacritic , which collect data from numerous review websites , listed scores of 92 % and 89 % , respectively . The game was favorably compared to Reynold 's previous title , Civilization II , and Rawn Shah of IT World Canada praised the expansion for a " believable " plot . However , despite its critical reception , it sold the fewest copies of all the games in the Civilization series . It sold more than 100 @,@ 000 copies in its first two months of release . This was followed by 50 @,@ 000 copies in April , May and June .

 The game showed well at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) . Walter <unk> of GameSpot said that Alpha Centauri was " more than hi @-@ tech physics and new ways to blow each other up " , and that the game would feature realistic aliens . Terry Coleman of Computer Gaming World predicted that Alpha Centauri would be " another huge hit " . <unk> awarded it " Most Promising Strategy Game " and one of the top 25 games of E3 ' 98 . In a vote of 27 journalists from 22 gaming magazine , Alpha Centauri won " Best Turn Based Strategy " of E3 Show Award . Aaron John Loeb , the Awards Committee Chairman , said " for those that understand the intricacies , the wonder , the glory of turn based ' culture building , ' this is the game worth skipping class for . " 
 Alpha Centauri 's science fiction storyline received high praise ; IGN considered the game an exception to PC sci @-@ fi cliches , and GamePro compared the plot to the works of writers Stanley Kubrick and Isaac Asimov . J.C. Herz of The New York Times suggested that the game was a marriage of SimCity and Frank Herbert 's Dune . GamePro 's Dan Morris said " As the single @-@ player campaign builds to its final showdown , the ramifications of the final theoretical discoveries elevate Alpha Centauri from great strategy game to science @-@ fiction epic . " Game Revolution said , " The well crafted story , admirable science @-@ fiction world , fully realized scenario , and quality core gameplay are sure to please . " Edge praised the uniqueness of expression saying it was " the same kind of old @-@ fashioned , consensual storytelling that once drew universes out of ASCII . " The in @-@ game writing and faction leaders were also well @-@ received for their believability , especially the voice acting . GameSpot reviewer Denny Atkin called the factions and their abilities Alpha Centauri 's " most impressive aspect " . Greg Tito of The Escapist said , " the genius of the game is how it flawlessly blends its great writing with strategy elements . " 
 Alpha Centauri 's turn @-@ based gameplay , including the technology trees and factional warfare , was commonly compared to Civilization and Civilization II . The Adrenaline Vault 's Pete Hines said , " While Alpha Centauri is the evolutionary off @-@ spring to [ Civilization ] and [ Civilization II ] , it is not [ Civilization II ] in space . Although the comparison is inevitable because of the lineage , it is still short @-@ sighted . " Edge in 2006 praised " Alpha Centauri ’ s greater <unk> as a strategy game . " IGN said " Alpha Centauri is a better game than Civilization II ; it 's deep , rich , rewarding , thought @-@ provoking in almost every way . " Game Revolution 's reviewer was less magnanimous , saying " Alpha Centauri is at least as good a game as Civilization 2 . But it is its great similarity that also does it the most detriment . Alpha Centauri simply does not do enough that is new ; it just doesn 't innovate enough to earn a higher grade . " The ability to create custom units was praised , as was the depth of the tech tree . The artificial intelligence of computer @-@ controlled factions , which featured adaptability and behavioral subtlety , was given mixed comments ; some reviewers thought it was efficient and logical , while others found it confusing or erratic . Edge was disappointed in the game 's diplomacy , finding " no more and no less than is expected from the genre " and unhappy with " the inability to sound out any real sense of relationship or rational discourse . " 
 If you 're looking for gratuitous eye candy , then you 're obviously in the wrong place . Alpha Centauri 's graphics are quite good , but they 're not going to make anyone sit up and take notice . 
 The game 's graphics were widely acknowledged to be above average at the time of its release , but not revolutionary . Its maps and interface were considered detailed and in accordance with a space theme , but the game was released with a limited color palette . The in @-@ game cutscenes , particularly the full motion video that accompanied technological advances , were praised for their quality and innovation . Alpha Centauri 's sound and music received similar comments ; FiringSquad said " [ The sound effect quality ] sort of follows the same line as the unit graphics – not too splashy but enough to get the job done . " 
 Alpha Centauri has won several Game of the Year awards , including those from the Denver Post and the Toronto Sun . It won the " Turn @-@ based Strategy Game of the Year " award from GameSpot as well . The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences named Alpha Centauri the best strategy game of the year , and in 2000 , Alpha Centauri won the Origins Award for Best Strategy Computer Game of 1999 . Alpha Centauri has the distinction of receiving gaming magazine PC Gamer 's highest score ( 98 % ) , surpassing Civilization II 's score ( 97 % ) . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 There have been no direct sequels beyond Alien Crossfire , something that writer Greg Tito attributed to Reynolds leaving Firaxis in 2000 to form Big Huge Games . Alien Crossfire producer and lead designer Timothy Train left Firaxis with Reynolds . 
 However , many of the features introduced in Alpha Centauri were carried over into subsequent Civilization titles ; in fact , upon its release , Civilization III was compared negatively to Alpha Centauri , whose Civilization characteristics were reminiscent of faction bonuses and penalties . 
 Edge magazine noted that Alpha Centauri remained " highly regarded " in 2006 . The government system in Civilization IV closely resembles Alpha Centauri 's , and Civilization V includes a new victory condition : the completion of the ' Utopia project ' , which is reminiscent of the Ascent to Transcendence secret project . 
 A decade after its release Sold @-@ Out Software and GOG.com re @-@ released the game for online @-@ download sales . Civilization : Beyond Earth , a spiritual sequel to Alpha Centauri , was announced by Firaxis in April 2014 and released on October 24 , 2014 ; several of those that worked on Alpha Centauri helped to develop the new title . 
 After the release of the expansion , multimedia producer Michael Ely wrote a trilogy of novels based on the game . Illustrator Rafael <unk> also wrote a graphic novel entitled Alpha Centauri : Power of the <unk> . Steve Jackson Games published GURPS Alpha Centauri , a sourcebook for the GURPS role @-@ playing game set in the Alpha Centauri universe . 
 On May 7 , 2010 , a Brendan Casey ( also known as <unk> ) released an unofficial patch , which fixes bugs in Alpha Centauri . His project began in February 2009 at <unk> 's Alpha Centauri site , and moved in June 2009 to the Civilization Gaming Network , where he planned to continue developing further patch versions . He seemed to have resumed work in March 2013 at the http : / / <unk> fan site . Currently , the subsequent patches of other modders generally build upon <unk> 's original 1 @.@ 0 patch . There is a graphics update , Artificial Intelligence update , and an additional modifications patch amongst others there . 
 = Victory Road ( 2004 ) = 
 Victory Road ( 2004 ) was a professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view ( PPV ) event produced by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA ) , which took place on November 7 , 2004 at the TNA Impact ! Zone in Orlando , Florida . It was the first event under the Victory Road chronology , which became an annual event in 2006 . Nine matches were featured on the event 's card . 
 The main event was a Ladder match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship , in which the champion , Jeff Jarrett , defeated the challenger , Jeff Hardy , by climbing a ladder and retrieving the championship . America 's Most Wanted ( Chris Harris and James Storm ) defeated Triple X ( Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper ) in another featured match contested under Elimination Last Team Standing rules . The event 's undercard featured different varieties of matches . One match on the undercard was contested for the TNA X Division Championship , in which Petey Williams successfully defended it against A.J. Styles . Also a match that was held under no disqualification rules called a Monster 's Ball match was won by Monty Brown by defeating Raven and Abyss . 
 The event is remembered as being TNA 's first monthly three @-@ hour PPV event . Before Victory Road , TNA only hosted weekly two @-@ hour PPV events . The professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer website rated the entire event a 5 out of 10 , lower than the 2006 event 's rating of 5 @.@ 5 . 
 = = Background = = 
 The event featured nine professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre @-@ existing scripted feuds , plots , and storylines . Wrestlers were portrayed as either villains or heroes in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches . 
 The main event at Victory Road was a Ladder match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship between the champion , Jeff Jarrett , and the challenger , Jeff Hardy . In a Ladder match , two or more participants fight to climb a ladder to retrieve a contract , championship belt , or some other type of object to win . Jarrett was scripted to defend the championship against Hardy on the October 15 episode of TNA 's primary television program , TNA Impact ! , after Hardy won a tournament to become number one contender . Jarrett defeated Hardy to retain the championship once before , on September 6 at TNA 's final weekly PPV , which set up the rivalry between the two . On the October 22 episode of Impact ! , Hardy challenged Jarrett to contest their bout under Ladder match rules , which Jarrett accepted . 
 The highest promoted match , second only to the main event in importance , scheduled for Victory Road was between the tag team pairings of America 's Most Wanted ( Chris Harris and James Storm ) ( AMW ) and Triple X ( Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper ) ( XXX ) , with them competing in an Elimination Last Team Standing match . In this match , the teams fought each other until both members of one team could not stand up before the referee counted to ten . The build up to this match began on the previous weekly PPV , when Storm was not cleared to wrestle so XXX took AMW 's place in challenging for the NWA World Tag Team Championship . Daniels was injured early in the evening after a scripted assault by The Naturals ( Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens ) . Harris was written into the plotline to replace Daniels in challenging and defeating The Naturals for the tag team championship at the PPV . On the September 24 episode of Impact ! , Daniels and Storm were forced to team together and challenge Skipper and Harris for the championship , which they were successful in winning . Storm and Daniels later lost the championship to Team Canada ( Bobby Roode and Eric Young ) on the October 15 episode of Impact ! . Harris and Storm then re @-@ joined together to continue as AMW , while Daniels and Skipper did the same as XXX . After a few brawls between the two teams on Impact ! , AMW challenged XXX to a Last Team Standing match at Victory Road on the October 29 episode of Impact ! . 
 In TNA 's X Division , the TNA X Division Champion Petey Williams was scripted to defend the championship against A.J. Styles . The narrative plot assigned to their rivalry began when Williams assaulted Styles after he defeated Kid Kash in a Tables match on the previous weekly PPV . Williams and the alliance he was associated with at the time , Team Canada , repeatedly attacked Styles following the event on Impact ! . Styles become the number one contender to the X Division Championship by winning a match involving six other men on the October 1 episode of Impact ! , setting up a match between the two at Victory Road for the championship . 
 TNA held the first ever Monster 's Ball match , featuring Monty Brown , Abyss , and Raven , at Victory Road . There were no disqualifications and pinfalls and submissions were counted anywhere in this match . Brown , Abyss , and Raven were all involved in a tournament to challenge Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Victory Road which set up a rivalry between the three . On the October 29 episode of Impact ! , Raven challenged Brown and Abyss to a Monsters Ball match at Victory Road , which was later booked for the event without Brown nor Abyss accepting the challenge . 
 The TNA Director of Authority ( DOA ) was voted on at Victory Road . The candidates were the current DOA , Vince Russo , and Dusty Rhodes . After weeks of arguing between the two over how TNA should be run , Russo stated on the October 15 episode of Impact ! that the fans would decide at Victory Road , per an online vote held on TNA 's official website .

 The first match at Victory Road to air live on PPV was a twenty @-@ man Gauntlet match , consisting of wrestlers who compete in TNA 's X Division . In this particular match , wrestlers were eliminated by being thrown over the top rope and down to the floor until there were two left in the ring . Those two men had a standard match until one was pinned or made to submit . The final two participants were Kazarian and Héctor Garza . Kazarian tried to pin Garza with a Cradle , but Garza countered the maneuver with a roll @-@ up for the win . 
 The second match was an Eight Man Tag Team match consisting of the team of Ron Killings , Erik Watts , Johnny B. Badd and Pat Kenney against the team of Kid Kash , Dallas , and The Naturals ( Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens ) . After various offensive maneuvers between the two teams , Killings pinned Stevens after a double underhook DDT . 
 The third match was a lucha libre midget match between Mascarita Sagrada and <unk> Morgan . Sagrada won the match when he pinned Morgan with a small package . 
 A Tag Team match for the NWA World Tag Team Championship between the champions , Team Canada ( Bobby Roode and Eric Young ) , and the 3Live Kru ( B.G. James and Konnan ) ( 3LK ) followed . The match went back and forth between the two teams with each taking advantage of the pace multiple times . The 3LK won the match and the championship by pinfall after Konnan lifted Roode up in the air , <unk> , and forced Roode 's face into the mat . 
 Trinity , who was accompanied by The New York Connection ( NYC ) pairing of Johnny Swinger and Glenn Gilberti , fought an unknown opponent in an open challenge by Trinity in the fifth bout . Jacqueline Moore made her TNA debut and answered the challenge . During the match , NYC interfered on Trinity 's behalf by distracting Moore to allow Trinity to perform the Fall from Grace from the top rope to gain the pinfall victory .

Critic Barry Walters has described it as a key release in the emerging the genre of the alternative R & B.

 In 2010 , Usher released his sixth studio album Raymond v. Raymond , with a mixed critical response and commercial success ; the project went on to earn two Grammy Awards at the 2011 ceremony . His follow @-@ up record was originally rumored to be titled The <unk> and due for release on March 23 , 2012 , though Usher later refuted the speculation . 
 While on hiatus between the release of his first EP Versus and Looking 4 Myself , Usher told AOL Music that he mainly traveled to various locations to listen to music which he " felt was really significant in terms of energy . " Some of these locations included the Coachella Music Festival , Ibiza , Germany , Las Vegas , Miami and Southern France . He described some of the music as a " little bit more electronic , some of it a little bit more dance . Some of it , a bit more world . " It was Australian electronic music duo Empire of the Sun that inspired Usher to produce the album 's title track , with producer Rico Love , which led to the singer collaborating with producers he normally wouldn 't work with or admired , such as Diplo . Usher 's intention for the album was one " that was not genre @-@ specific but just experimental " . During an episode of NBC 's The Voice , Usher called the album " by far one of my most risky records ... I wanted to challenge myself " . Looking 4 Myself was chosen as the album 's title as it described Usher 's ' musical journey ' . 
 RCA Records CEO Peter Edge spoke to Billboard on which two specific groups they want the album to appeal to , " By the time the album is available , Usher 's collective audience will have had a chance to really sample a number of songs from the album [ ... ] the end result will be an Usher album that appeals to his earliest fans , and people who may have never listened to or owned an Usher album before . " Prior to the album 's release , Usher was put under the management of Grace Miguel — whom he is in a relationship with — replacing Randy Phillips , who managed Usher for a short period after he split with his mother , Jonnetta Patton for a second time , in 2008 . The cover art and track listing for both the standard and deluxe edition of the album were revealed on May 3 , 2012 . On June 4 , 2012 , 30 second snippets of each track were leaked on the internet .

 Diplo , Rico Love , Jim Jonsin , Salaam Remi and Max Martin were the first producers confirmed for Looking 4 Myself on March 2012 . After Usher had attended the Coachella Music Festival , he worked with electronic music duo Empire of the Sun to produce the album 's title track ; he described the band 's music as an " incredible sound " . The collaboration and the band 's music inspired Usher to produce more experimental music , and to produce records with producers he normally wouldn 't work with or admired . DJ and producer Diplo was one of them , and so both collaborated on the album 's lead single , " Climax " . They discussed the concept throughout the song 's development and how it relates to Usher 's life , as Diplo " tried to help realise these lyrics and feelings . " After conceiving some melody lines , they wrote the song in about an hour . Usher and Diplo worked on the song 's production for two months , recording in studios in Los Angeles , New York , and Atlanta . 
 Usher wanted to work with Swedish electronic dance music trio Swedish House Mafia since their joint performance at the American Music Awards in 2011 . The group later agreed to work with the singer , where they intended to travel to Atlanta to work on track production , writing , and to " move the ball forward . " Steve Angello , a member of Swedish House Mafia , told MTV News that the group hung out with Usher in Ibiza after the awards ceremony ; they worked with him in Atlanta for five days . They produced the final tracks " Numb " , " Euphoria " and " Way to Count " , with the latter not making the final cut . 
 Usher contacted several producers and musicians who he endeavoured to , but ended up not collaborating with , including Skrillex , Calvin Harris , Afrojack , Kaskade , Little Dragon and David Guetta . The latter had revealed to The Hollywood Reporter in May 2012 that he and Usher had worked on a " crazy " record , though it did not appear on the album due to a scheduling conflict ; rapper Ludacris was involved in the song 's production . English singer @-@ songwriter Labrinth spent two studio sessions with Usher in April 2012 working on Looking 4 Myself .

 Usher told <unk> in November 2011 that he is working on a new genre of music , which he depicted as " revolutionary pop " . He explained that it " combines several other music genres to form a new sound " . In a later interview , Usher clarified that his latter quote was misinterpreted , in that it is not a specific type of sound , but rather what he found as inspiration behind where he was and what he was working on " was revolutionary " . The album incorporates pop styles , which Usher described as being " relevant " to its time and " what [ people are ] listening to " . Randall Roberts of Los Angeles Times summed up the production of the album , writing that it " draws on a world of styles permeating pop culture in 2012 " , by implementing the genres electronic dance , dubstep , pop and hip @-@ hop to create a hybrid pop . Allmusic 's Andy Kellman described revolutionary pop as " contemporary pop @-@ oriented R & B , or european dance @-@ pop , or some combination of the two " , and that the album is " weighted more heavily toward dance @-@ pop " compared to his previous efforts .

 Usher held multiple private listening sessions for Looking 4 Myself . On April 27 , 2012 he debuted the album in the off @-@ broadway show Fuerza Bruta : Look Up , in Daryl Roth Theater in New York City . When speaking to MTV , he explained his reasoning for performing in the show " It 's not often that you 're able to give somewhat of a visual or an emotional kind of basis of what your songs mean [ ... ] I felt like , yeah , it would be a physical challenge , yeah it would be a lot for me , but [ I want to ] at least try it , there are many times I 'd seen the show and I 'd only hoped that I would make it happen " . Steven Horowitz of Rolling Stone commented that Usher " theatrically sequenced the entirety of the project to strobing lights and choreographed moves " . Horowitz also praised the singer 's performance , concluding that " the veteran entertainer reasserts himself as a master of rapturous dance fodder , capable of turning a room into a thumping rave with ease " . Usher appeared on Saturday Night Live — hosted by Will Ferrell — where he performed the singles " Scream " and " Climax " . He performed both singles again , in the 2012 Today summer concert , being the opening act of the series .

 Bullen was born in Bramhall , Cheshire . Bullen 's father , Alex , was a chemical engineer , and his mother , Joan , was a housewife . Mike and his sister Jane were raised in Solihull , where he attended Solihull School . At the age of 18 he was accepted to Magdalene College , Cambridge , to read economics . He did not enjoy the subject , so switched to history of art . Despite his public school background , Bullen felt out of place at Cambridge among students who did not come from the urban West Midlands , later stating that " Half the students were debutantes who spent a lot of time brushing their hair ; the other half ended up working in Sotheby 's . " His first experiences of writing came when he was a child and wrote a newspaper for his neighbours . At Cambridge , he dramatised a Johann Wolfgang von Goethe novel . 
 Following his graduation , Bullen began a career as a media planner buyer for an advertising company . The job did not excite him and he has described it as " pretty pointless " . He quit the job to go backpacking in south @-@ east Asia . On his return he applied for a position as a radio producer at Radio Netherlands Worldwide , having previously worked for a hospital radio . He eventually began freelance work for the BBC World Service , where he was a presenter and producer for the magazine programmes On Screen and Outlook .

 In 1994 , aged 34 , Bullen began thinking about writing a television script , based on the idea that he could " write crap " on television . He was inspired in particular by the American television series Hill Street Blues ( a show he " cancelled [ his ] social life for " ) and Thirtysomething . He began work on scripts for Pie in the Sky and Soldier Soldier but did not complete either . To improve his writing skills , he took a writing course at the National Film and Television School , a comedy course by Anji Loman Field , and attended Robert McKee 's <unk> seminar . 
 He began writing another script , this time drawing on his American television influences . Believing that there was nothing on British television for people in his age group that was not a soap opera or a costume drama , Bullen wrote a script entitled The Perfect Match , about a man who proposes to his girlfriend using the screen at Wembley Stadium during the FA Cup Final . He secured an agent , who managed to sell the script on spec to Andy Harries , controller of comedy at Granada Television . Harries described the writing as " impressive — cleverly constructed dialogue , very funny , well observed " and commissioned it as part of his drive to move away from making traditional @-@ style sitcoms . Bullen described the moment he walked onto the set of The Perfect Match as " <unk> [ … ] wandering around a room which had previously only existed in my head " . It was broadcast on ITV in September 1995 to poor reviews . 
 Harries was pleased enough with Bullen 's work to ask him to pitch some more ideas to The Perfect Match assistant producer Christine Langan , who shared Bullen 's desire to see more television directed at their age bracket . Bullen pitched the idea of a traditional " boy @-@ meets @-@ girl , boy @-@ loses @-@ girl , boy @-@ wins @-@ girl @-@ back " story told from both sides of the relationship but using elements of fantasy and flashback to distort events to fit a character 's point of view . Harries accepted the pitch and Bullen began work on Cold Feet . Initially commissioned as a pilot for ITV 's Comedy Premieres programming strand , the prospect of a full television series was given to Bullen . Cold Feet 's main character , Adam Williams , a lothario character and a serial monogamist , was based on Bullen himself during his twenties . The other main character , Rachel Bradley , was based on a combination of his ex @-@ girlfriends and the " ideal girlfriend " . Harries suggested that if a series were to be commissioned , more characters would be needed . Bullen developed a supporting cast for Cold Feet , basing each character on friends of his . The script for Cold Feet went through " six or seven " drafts before being filmed in 1996 and was broadcast in 1997 . After a hiatus , it was commissioned for a full series . During the hiatus , he wrote a romantic comedy feature film script for Granada and developed a pilot for London Weekend Television , neither of which were picked up . The Writers ' Guild of Great Britain presented to Bullen the award for New Writer of the Year at their awards ceremony in October 1997 . 
 When he first started writing professionally , Bullen could not structure his scripting in a coherent way , adopting a " mix and match " method ; he began by structuring a script on cards , then typing what he had onto a computer , then returning to the cards . After completing the Cold Feet pilot , he starting writing ten pages of script per day , regardless of the quality of the writing . His own third draft was usually submitted to producers as the " first draft " . 
 = = = 1998 – 2003 = = = 
 Production on the first series of Cold Feet began in January 1998 . Bullen continued his method of developing storylines based on his own life ; he and his wife had their first child in the latter half of 1997 , so he integrated their experiences into the storyline of characters Pete and Jenny , who have their first child in Cold Feet 's first episode . Throughout 1998 , he retained his job at the BBC , working on three radio shows per week at the same time as writing Cold Feet . During the second series he cut back to one show per week . By the time of the third series in 2000 , he felt confident enough that he would have a future in television that he was able to give up radio presenting completely . He moved from his home in London to Cambridge , where he was able to write for two full days a week and at evenings and weekends . 
 He worked on other projects at the same time as Cold Feet : After watching the 1997 <unk> Holiday Reps , he became interested in what happens in the personal lives of holiday representatives while in foreign countries . Out of this idea he developed Sunburn for BBC One . Sunburn starred Michelle Collins and was broadcast for two series from 1999 to 2000 . Bullen shared writing duties with Lizzie Mickery and Sally Wainwright . His inspiration from American television continued ; following the premiere of The West Wing in 1999 , he began outlining a British version , The Firm , that would be set in Buckingham Palace . The project never moved beyond planning stages because Bullen believed that British political issues such as " cod wars with Spain " are not as " sexy " as the issues covered in The West Wing . 
 In 1999 , Cold Feet was adapted into a series of the same name for American network NBC . He wrote the screenplay for one of the pilot episodes . At the same time , NBC and Granada Entertainment USA commissioned a pilot script from Bullen entitled Small Beer , which centred on a group of people who take over a microbrewery in the north @-@ western United States . 
 The third series of Cold Feet ( 2000 ) was extended from six to eight episodes by ITV . Bullen believed that the production team had covered all potential storylines in the first two series , so declined to write any more episodes . A team of five writers was hired by Granada Television , overseen by Bullen as a co @-@ executive producer . Four out of the five writers left the team due to their scripts not being appropriate for the series , leaving only David Nicholls on staff . The writing process had made Bullen think twice about not writing and he began thinking about further storylines , such as mid @-@ life crises and IVF . The same year , he signed a two @-@ year contract with Granada to develop new projects . A fourth series of Cold Feet , also of eight episodes , was commissioned for 2001 . Bullen announced that he did not want to write a fifth series , and that the fourth would be the last . His reasons were that with ITV 's proposed commission of up to 20 episodes a year , the series would become like a soap opera . The popularity of the fourth series persuaded Bullen to write four more episodes that formed the fifth series in 2003 . The fifth series won Bullen the Writer of the Year Award at the 2003 British Comedy Awards . 
 In 2002 , he began developing Life Begins , a one @-@ hour television series . The following year he conceived George the Third . He moved to Australia in 2002 but continued to work on UK @-@ based series . 
 = = = 2004 – 2006 = = = 
 Life Begins was inspired by Bullen 's re @-@ evaluation of the lives of people around him as they approached 40 years old . During a conversation with a friend he realised that three women he knew had had failed marriages by the time they reached 40 . The series was designed as a vehicle for actress Sarah Lancashire , who had signed an exclusive " golden handcuffs " deal with ITV . Two months after the series was announced , Lancashire left Life Begins , feeling unable to commit to a potentially long @-@ running series . ITV replaced Lancashire with Caroline Quentin . Life Begins concerns Maggie Mee , who believes she is in a loving relationship with her husband Phil ( Alexander Armstrong ) . When Phil announces on a family holiday that he is leaving her , she realises that she must begin her life again . Bullen wrote the series with John Forte . The first series was broadcast in 2004 . As with Cold Feet , he integrated events from his own life into the storylines ; Maggie 's father suffers from Alzheimer 's disease as does one of Bullen 's own relatives . He researched Maggie 's travel agency job by spending a week at a travel agents ' in Bristol . 
 In 2003 Bullen made a journey to Perth 's Small Screen Big Picture . On the return leg , after 12 hours of seeing nothing but the Nullarbor Plain through the train window , he began developing a short subject on infidelity at television conferences . The short , entitled <unk> Tale , which marked Bullen 's directorial debut , was screened at various film festivals in 2005 , and was a finalist for the first Rosemount Diamond at the Jackson Hole Film Festival . On the themes of the film , Bullen said , " What has always interested me is the notion of ordinary people and how they react in ordinary situations [ … ] what fascinated me is the way we arrive at the choices we make . The idea of this film is to say that the choices we make might not lead to the outcomes we expect . " He formerly expressed interest in directing an episode of Cold Feet , but decided against it on the basis that his inexperience would make him " inadequate " and that the job was best left to professional directors . The short was produced by <unk> Granite Productions , a company set up by Bullen after his exclusive contract with Granada ended in September 2004 . At the end of 2004 , he became the seventh person to rewrite the script of the DreamWorks / Aardman Animations film Tortoise vs. Hare . He made at least three drafts . 
 Alongside the second series of Life Begins , Bullen continued developing George the Third . The title was changed to It Happens until eventually settling on All About George in time for filming in 2005 . All About George starred Rik Mayall as George Kinsey , a builder whose life is changed when six generations of his family move into his home . Initially excited about the series when he attended the cast read @-@ throughs , Bullen 's optimism waned by the time it was broadcast as he felt there were too many characters and the series ' premise unclear . In a 2008 interview , he describes it as one of his worst TV series . Life Begins returned for a third and final series in 2006 . The same year , filming commenced on Tripping Over , a series about intercontinental backpackers in 1976 and 2006 . <unk> writers Andrew Knight and Andrea Denholm conceived the idea in 2003 and asked Bullen , a friend of Knight 's , to develop it with them . A co @-@ production between Australia 's Channel Ten and Britain 's Five , Tripping Over was broadcast in both countries at the end of 2006 . 
 = = = 2007 – 2012 = = = 
 In 2007 , Bullen was approached by David Maher , a Fox World producer , who commissioned him to write a television pilot for UKTV . Bullen agreed and spent a " torturous " time trying to come up with an idea for the script . Continuing his trend for taking ideas from real life , he decided to write about a family moving from the UK to Australia . The pilot , entitled Make or Break , was also Bullen 's television directoral debut . British actor Robson Green had recently completed work on " Prayer of the Bone " , a one @-@ off special episode of Wire in the Blood set in the United States . Green and Wire producer Sandra Jobling considered another special episode set in Australia . Green suggested asking Bullen to write the episode and Bullen responded by asking Green if he would like to play the lead in Make or Break . Fox World sent the script to Green and he signed on . As the pilot was Bullen 's first attempt at directing television , he sought advice from the experienced production crew , in particular the director of photography . The pilot was first broadcast in March 2008 . Bullen and Fox World sought financial investment from a UK production company to develop a full @-@ length series . 
 In 2010 , Bullen wrote his first screenplay for the BBC since Sunburn ; Reunited is a pilot about six friends who once shared a house together reuniting after eight years . Bullen admitted that his career was " declining " before he made Reunited , and he even moved back to the UK for five months while it was produced . He considers Reunited his best work since the end of Cold Feet . The pilot received only 3 @.@ 3 million viewers when it was broadcast , and a series was not commissioned . Bullen has since discussed other projects with Ed Byrne , one of the actors in the pilot . 
 Bullen and his family returned to the UK in 2011 ; Bullen told The Manly Daily " I realised if I still am going to have a UK @-@ based television career I need to be based in the UK . " As of 2012 , Bullen has three television series in development with British television networks . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Bullen is married to Lisa Bullen , whom he met while working at the BBC . They have two children : Maggie ( born 1997 ) and Rachel ( born 1999 ) . In 2002 the family moved to Avalon , New South Wales . They later moved to Newport , New South Wales and became Australian citizens in 2005 . The family returned to the UK in 2011 .

 = Climate of Argentina = 
 The climate of Argentina is a complex subject : the vast size of the country and considerable variation in altitude make for a wide range of climate types . Argentina has four seasons : winter ( June – August ) , spring ( September – November ) , summer ( December – February ) and autumn ( March – May ) , all featuring different weather conditions . Summers are the warmest and wettest season in most of the country except in most of Patagonia where it is the driest season . Winters are normally mild in the north , cool in the center and cold in the southern parts with the latter experiencing frequent frost and snow . Because southern parts of the country are moderated by the surrounding oceans , the cold is less intense and prolonged than areas at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere . Spring and autumn are transition seasons that generally feature mild weather . 
 Many regions have different , often contrasting , microclimates . In general , northern parts of the country are characterized by hot , humid , rainy summers and mild winters with periodic droughts . Mesopotamia , in the northeast is characterized by high temperatures and abundant precipitation throughout the year with droughts being uncommon . West of this lies the Chaco region , which is the warmest region in Argentina . Precipitation in the Chaco region decreases westwards , resulting in the vegetation changing from forests in the east to shrubs in the west . Northwest Argentina is predominantly dry and hot although the rugged topography makes it climatically diverse , ranging from the cold , dry Puna to thick jungles . The center of the country , which includes the Pampas to the east and the drier Cuyo region to the west has hot summers with occasional tornadoes and thunderstorms , and cool , dry winters . Patagonia , in the southern parts of the country has a dry climate with warm summers and cold winters characterized by strong winds throughout the year and one of the strongest precipitation gradients in the world . High elevations at all latitudes experience cooler conditions , and the mountainous zones can see heavy snowfall . 
 The geographic and geomorphic characteristics of Argentina tend to create extreme weather conditions , often leading to natural disasters that negatively impact the country both economically and socially . The Pampas , where many of the large cities are located , has a flat topography and poor water drainage , making it vulnerable to flooding . Severe storms can lead to tornados , damaging hail , storm surges , and high winds , causing extensive damage to houses and infrastructure , displacing thousands of people and causing significant loss of life . Extreme temperature events such as heat waves and cold waves impact rural and urban areas by negatively impacting agriculture , one of the main economic activities of the country , and by increasing energy demand , which can lead to energy shortages . 
 Argentina is vulnerable and will be significantly impacted by climate change . Temperatures have increased in the last century while the observed changes in precipitation are variable , with some areas receiving more and other areas less . These changes have impacted river flow , increased the frequency of extreme weather events , and led to the retreat of glaciers . Based on the projections for both precipitation and temperatures , these climatic events are likely to increase in severity and create new problems associated with climate change in the country . 
 = = Seasons = = 
 = = = Winter = = = 
 In winter ( June – August ) , the northern parts of Argentina are generally warm , the central parts mild , and the southern parts cold with frequent frost and snow . The climate of the southern parts of the country is moderated by the surrounding oceans , resulting in cold weather that is less intense and prolonged than at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere . The northern parts of the country have the warmest temperatures , with an average of 14 ° C ( 57 ° F ) ; the central parts are cooler , with an average of 10 ° C ( 50 ° F ) . In the extreme south , mean temperatures are below 4 ° C ( 39 ° F ) . At higher altitudes in the Andes , average winter temperatures are below 0 ° C ( 32 ° F ) . June and July temperatures are normally similar to each other ; however , in August temperatures see a rise of about 2 ° C ( 4 ° F ) . 
 Precipitation varies widely during the winter months . The highest are in the extreme northern part of the Littoral region and northwestern parts of Patagonia , where mean winter precipitation exceeds 250 mm ( 10 in ) . Most of the humid Pampas , averages between 75 and 200 mm ( 3 and 8 in ) while in the north , in areas bordering the Andes , it averages less than 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) . 
 = = = Spring = = = 
 Spring ( September – November ) is similar to autumn , with mild days and cool nights . During mid @-@ October a large variety of wild and urban flora are in bloom . Temperatures range from 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) in the north to 14 ° C ( 57 ° F ) in the center , and 8 to 14 ° C ( 46 to 57 ° F ) in most of Patagonia . Tierra del Fuego Province and the higher altitudes of the Andes have the coolest springs , with mean temperatures below 8 ° C ( 46 ° F ) . Temperatures grow warmer as spring progresses . 
 During spring , precipitation in the country varies , with the greatest amounts being in northern Buenos Aires Province and the Littoral region , where the average precipitation exceeds 250 mm ( 10 in ) . Arid regions ( Arid Diagonal ) have the lowest spring precipitation , with an average precipitation of less than 50 mm ( 2 in ) . 
 = = = Summer = = = 
 In summer ( December – February ) , temperatures range from an average of 26 ° C ( 79 ° F ) in the north to a mean of 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) in the center of the country except for the southeastern parts of Buenos Aires Province , where temperatures are cooler in summer due to the maritime influence . In the extreme south of the country , the temperature averages 12 ° C ( 54 ° F ) ; at very high altitudes , the average is below 10 ° C ( 50 ° F ) . 
 During summer , mean precipitation varies throughout the country : the eastern parts of Salta Province , Jujuy Province , northern Tucumán Province and all of Misiones Province are the wettest , receiving more than 400 mm ( 16 in ) of precipitation during the season . Most of the Littoral region and Buenos Aires Province , average between 200 and 300 mm ( 8 and 12 in ) . On the other hand , the Patagonia region is dry , with precipitation averaging less than 50 mm ( 2 in ) – and occasionally below 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) – much lower than other regions ; Patagonia receives a monthly precipitation of 10 to 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 0 in ) . In the central and northern parts of the country , January is usually the wettest month , with an average monthly precipitation of 100 mm ( 4 in ) in most places , even exceeding 200 mm ( 8 in ) in some places . 
 = = = Autumn = = = 
 Autumn ( March – May ) is generally mild . Some forests and vineyards display red and orange autumn foliage , especially in mid @-@ April . Frost arrives notably earlier in the south and later in the north . Mean temperatures can exceed 22 ° C ( 72 ° F ) in the northern parts of the country , while they can touch 16 ° C ( 61 ° F ) in most of the central parts of the country , and less than 6 ° C ( 43 ° F ) at the higher altitudes . As autumn progresses , mean temperatures fall in all regions , with March warmer than May . In the north , mean temperatures range from 24 ° C ( 75 ° F ) in March to 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) in May . In the central parts of the country , mean temperatures in March are between 18 and 22 ° C ( 64 and 72 ° F ) , dropping to 10 and 14 ° C ( 50 and 57 ° F ) in May . The mean temperature in Tierra del Fuego Province in the extreme south is 10 ° C ( 50 ° F ) , and occasionally lower . 
 Precipitation is highest in northeast Argentina and lowest in the Patagonia and Cuyo regions . In northeast Argentina , mean precipitation can exceed 400 mm ( 16 in ) while in most of Buenos Aires Province and northwest Argentina , mean autumn precipitation ranges between 200 and 500 mm ( 8 and 20 in ) . In most of the western parts of northwest Argentina , Patagonia ( except for western Patagonia where precipitation is higher , averaging 100 to 200 mm ( 4 to 8 in ) ) and Cuyo regions , precipitation can average less than 50 mm ( 2 in ) . In the northwest , precipitation decreases as autumn progresses , ushering in the dry season . For example , in Tucuman Province , March averages more than 200 mm ( 8 in ) of precipitation while May averages less than 50 mm ( 2 in ) . In contrast , precipitation increases in Patagonia , particularly in the western parts where May precipitation can exceed 100 mm ( 4 in ) . 
 = = Regional climate = = 
 Argentina possesses a wide variety of climatic regions ranging from subtropical in the north to subantarctic in the far south . Lying between those is the Pampas region , which features a mild and humid climate . Consequently , there is a wide variety of biomes in the country , including subtropical rain forests , semi @-@ arid and arid regions , temperate plains in the Pampas , and cold subantarctic in the south . However , despite the diversity of biomes , about two @-@ thirds of Argentina is arid or semi @-@ arid . In general , Argentina has four main climate types : warm , moderate , arid , and cold , all determined by the expanse across latitude , range in altitude , and relief features . Mean annual temperatures range from 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) in the far south to 25 ° C ( 77 ° F ) in the north . Also , because of the narrowness of the South American continent , the nation 's climate is influenced by the Andes mountain chain along its western border and maritime influences from the Atlantic Ocean . 
 = = = Mesopotamia = = = 
 Mesopotamia has a subtropical climate with no dry season . Under the Köppen climate classification , it has a humid subtropical climate ( Cfa ) . The main features of the climate are high temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year ; this abundant rainfall makes water scarcity and extended periods of drought uncommon ; most of the region has a positive water balance . 
 Average annual precipitation ranges from less than 1 @,@ 000 mm ( 39 in ) in the southern parts of the Province to approximately 1 @,@ 800 mm ( 71 in ) in the eastern parts . Precipitation is slightly higher in the summer than in the winter and generally decreases from east to west and from north to south . Summer is the most humid season , ranging from a low of 300 mm ( 12 in ) to a high of 450 mm ( 18 in ) . In this season , most rain falls during convective thunderstorms . Autumn is one of the rainiest seasons , with many places receiving over 350 mm ( 14 in ) . As in summer , precipitation falls mainly during convective thunderstorms . Winter is the driest season , with precipitation ranging from less than 40 mm ( 2 in ) in the west to over 340 mm ( 13 in ) in the east . Most of the precipitation during winter comes from frontal systems , particularly the sudestada ( Spanish for strong southeasterly winds ) , bringing long periods of rain , cloudiness , cooler temperatures , and strong winds . Spring is similar to autumn , with a mean precipitation of 340 mm ( 13 in ) . 
 Summers are very hot and humid while winters are mild to warm . The northern parts of the region are warmer than the southern parts . During heat waves , temperatures can exceed 40 ° C ( 104 ° F ) in the summer months , while in the winter months , cold air masses from the south can push temperatures below freezing , resulting in frost . However , such cold fronts are brief and are less intense than areas further south or at higher altitudes . Snowfall is extremely rare and mainly confined to the uplands of Misiones Province , where the last significant snowfall occurred in 1975 in Bernardo de Irigoyen . 
 = = = Chaco = = = 
 The Chaco region in the center @-@ north has a subtropical climate with hot , humid summers and mild , dry winters . Under the Köppen climate classification , the west has a semi @-@ arid climate ( Bs ) while the east has a humid subtropical climate ( Cfa ) . Chaco is one of the few natural regions in the world located between tropical and temperate latitudes that is not a desert . Precipitation and temperature are relatively homogeneous throughout the region . 
 Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1 @,@ 200 mm ( 47 in ) in the eastern parts of Formosa Province to a low of 450 to 500 mm ( 18 to 20 in ) in the west and southwest . Summer witnesses the maximum precipitation . Summer rains are intense , and torrential rain is common , occasionally causing floods and soil erosion . During the winter months , precipitation is sparse . Eastern areas receive more precipitation than western areas since they are more influenced by moist air from the Atlantic Ocean , which penetrates the eastern areas more than the west , bringing in more precipitation . As a result , the vegetation differs : eastern areas are covered by forests , savannas , marshes and subtropical wet forest , and western areas are dominated by medium and low forests of mesophytic and xerophytic trees and a dense understory of shrubs and grasses . In all parts of the region , precipitation is highly variable from year to year . 
 The Chaco region is the hottest in Argentina , with a mean annual temperature of 23 ° C ( 73 ° F ) . With mean summer temperatures occasionally reaching 28 ° C ( 82 ° F ) , the region has the hottest summers in the country . Winters are mild and brief , with mean temperatures in July ranging from 16 ° C ( 61 ° F ) in the northern parts to 14 ° C ( 57 ° F ) in the southernmost parts . Temperatures can reach as high has 49 ° C ( 120 ° F ) in summer , and during cold waves can fall to − 6 ° C ( 21 ° F ) . 
 = = = Northwest = = = 
 Northwest Argentina is predominantly dry , hot , and subtropical . Owing to its rugged and varied topography , the region is climatically diverse , depending on the altitude , temperature and distribution of precipitation . Consequently , the vegetation will also differ . Under the Köppen climate classification , the region has five different climate types : semi – arid ( BS ) , arid ( BW ) , temperate without a dry season and temperate with a dry season ( Cf and CW respectively ) , and , at the highest altitudes , an alpine . 
 Precipitation is highly seasonal and mostly concentrated in the summer months . It is distributed irregularly due to the country 's topography although it generally decreases from east to west . The eastern slopes of the mountains receives between 1 @,@ 000 and 1 @,@ 500 mm ( 39 and 59 in ) of precipitation a year , though some places receive up to 2 @,@ 500 mm ( 98 in ) annually owing to orographic precipitation . The high rainfall on these first slopes creates a thick jungle that extends in a narrow strip along these ranges . The temperate valleys , the location of major cities such as Salta and Jujuy , have an average precipitation ranging between 500 and 1 @,@ 000 mm ( 20 and 39 in ) , with rainfall mainly concentrated in the summer months , often falling in short but heavy bursts . Valleys in the southern parts of the region are drier than those in the north due to the greater height of the Andes and the Sierras Pampeanas on the eastern slopes than the northern mountains , presenting a significant orographic barrier that blocks moist winds from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans . These valleys receive less than 200 mm ( 8 in ) of precipitation per year and are characterized by sparse vegetation adapted to the arid climate . The area further west in the Puna region , with an average altitude of 3 @,@ 900 m ( 12 @,@ 800 ft ) , is mostly a desert due to the blocking of the easterly winds by the Andes and the northwest extension of the Sierras Pampeanas . Precipitation in the Puna region averages less than 200 mm ( 8 in ) a year while high isolation , strong winds , and low humidity exacerbate the dry conditions . 
 Temperatures in northwest Argentina vary by altitude . The temperate valleys have a temperate climate , with mild summers and dry and cool winters with regular <unk> the Quebrada de Humahuaca valley , mean annual temperatures range from 12 @.@ 0 to 14 @.@ 1 ° C ( 53 @.@ 6 to 57 @.@ 4 ° F ) , depending on altitude . In the Calchaquí Valleys in Salta Province , the climate is temperate and arid with large thermal amplitudes , long summers , and a long frost @-@ free period . In the valleys in the south in La Rioja Province , Catamarca Province and the southwest parts of Santiago del Estero Province , which is part of the arid Chaco ecoregion , temperatures during the summer are very high , averaging 26 ° C ( 79 ° F ) in January while winters are mild , averaging 12 ° C ( 54 ° F ) . Cold fronts from the south bringing cold Antarctic air can cause severe frosts in the valleys of La Rioja Province and Catamarca Province . In contrast , the Zonda wind , which occurs more often during the winter months , can raise temperatures up to 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) with strong gusts , sometimes causing crop damage . Temperatures in the Puna region are much colder , with a mean annual temperature of less than 10 ° C ( 50 ° F ) owing to the high altitude . The Puna region is characterized by being cold with a large diurnal range but sunny throughout the year . 
 = = = Cuyo = = = 
 The Cuyo region has an arid or a semi @-@ arid climate . The region 's wide range in latitude , combined with altitudes ranging from 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) to nearly 7 @,@ 000 m ( 23 @,@ 000 ft ) , means that it has a variety of different climate types . In general , most of the region has a temperate climate , with valleys at higher altitudes having a milder climate . At the highest altitudes ( over 4 @,@ 000 m ( 13 @,@ 123 ft ) ) , icy conditions persist year round . 
 Average annual precipitation ranges from 100 to 500 mm ( 4 to 20 in ) , though it is generally unpredictable . More than 85 % of annual rainfall occurs from October to March , which constitutes the warm season . In contrast , the winter months are dry . Eastern and southeastern areas of the region receive more precipitation than the western areas since they receive more summer rainfall . Precipitation is highly variable from year to year and appears to follow a cycle between dry and wet years in periods of about 2 , 4 – 5 , 6 – 8 , and 16 – 22 years . In wet years , easterly winds caused by the subtropical South Atlantic High are stronger , causing moisture to flow towards this region ; during dry years , these winds are weaker . 
 Summers in the region are hot and generally sunny ; winters are dry and cold . Since this region has a wide range of altitudes , ranging from 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) to nearly 7 @,@ 000 m ( 23 @,@ 000 ft ) , temperatures can vary widely . The Sierras Pampeanas , which cross into both San Juan Province and San Luis Province , have a milder climate with mean annual temperatures ranging from 12 to 18 ° C ( 54 to 64 ° F ) . Throughout the region , the diurnal range is great , with very high temperatures during the day followed by cold nights . In all locations , at altitudes over 3 @,@ 800 m ( 12 @,@ 500 ft ) , permafrost is present ; icy conditions persist year round at altitudes over 4 @,@ 000 m ( 13 @,@ 000 ft ) . 
 The Zonda , a Foehn wind characterized by warm , dry air , can cause temperatures to exceed 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) and occasionally 45 ° C ( 113 ° F ) , as occurred in 2003 . However , cold waves are also common , caused by the channeling by the Andes of cold air from the south , making for frequent cold fronts during the winter months and bringing temperatures that can fall below freezing , and occasionally below − 10 to − 30 ° C ( 14 to − 22 ° F ) at higher altitudes . 
 = = = Pampas = = = 
 The Pampas region has land that is appropriate for agriculture and raising livestock . It is a mostly flat area , interrupted only by the Tandil and Ventana <unk> in its southern portion . The climate of the Pampas is characterized as temperate and humid with no dry season , featuring hot summers and mild winters ( Cfa / Cfb according to the Köppen climate classification ) . The weather in the Pampas is variable due to the contrasting air masses and frontal storms that impact the region . Annual temperatures range from 17 ° C ( 63 ° F ) in the north to 14 ° C ( 57 ° F ) in the south . Precipitation increases toward the east and ranges from under 500 mm ( 20 in ) in the south and west to 1 @,@ 200 mm ( 47 in ) in the northeast . Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year in the easternmost parts of the Pampas ; in the western parts , most of the precipitation is concentrated during the summer months , and winters are drier . The Pampas are influenced by the El Niño Southern Oscillation , which is responsible for variation in annual precipitation . An El Niño year leads to higher precipitation while a La Niña year leads to lower precipitation . 
 Summers in the Pampas are hot and humid with coastal areas being modified by the cold Malvinas Current . Afternoon thunderstorms , which can bring intense amounts of precipitation , are common , as are heat waves that can bring temperatures in the 36 to 40 ° C ( 97 to 104 ° F ) range for a few days . These thunderstorms are known to have the most frequent lightning and highest convective cloud tops in the world . The severe thunderstorms produce intense hailstorms , floods , including flash floods , as well as the most consistently active tornado region outside the central and southeastern US . These are usually followed a day or two of strong Pampero winds from the south , which bring cool , dry air . Precipitation in the summer is high , with monthly amounts averaging between 90 mm ( 4 in ) and 160 mm ( 6 in ) in most places . 
 Autumn arrives in March and brings periods of very rainy weather followed by dry , mild stretches and cool nights . Some places in the east receive rainfall throughout autumn whereas in the west , after the rains , the weather quickly becomes very dry . Generally , frost arrives in early April in the southernmost areas , in late May in the north , and ends by mid @-@ September , although the dates of the first and last frosts can vary from year to year . Frost is rarely intense or prolonged and may not occur each year . 
 Winters are mild with frequent frosts and cold spells . Temperatures are usually mild during the day and cold during the night . Most precipitation results from frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and sudestada , which bring long periods of precipitation , cloudiness and cooler temperatures , particularly in the southern and eastern parts . Dull , gray and damp weather characterize winters in the Pampas . Occasionally , tropical air masses from the north may move southward , providing relief from the cool , damp temperatures . Snowfall is extremely rare . When it does snow , it usually lasts for only a day or two . 
 = = = Patagonia = = = 
 The Patagonian climate is classified as arid to semi @-@ arid and temperate to cool temperate . One defining characteristic are the strong winds from the west which blow year round ( stronger in summer than in winter ) , which favors evaporation and is a factor in making the region mostly arid . There are three major factors that influence the climate of the region : the Andes , the South Pacific High and South Atlantic High , and an isolation that is more pronounced in eastern than western areas . 
 The north – south orientation of the Andes creates a barrier for humid air masses coming from the Pacific Ocean , forming an extensive rain shadow and causing most of the region to be arid . South of 52 ° S , the Andes are lower in elevation , reducing the rain shadow effect in Tierra del Fuego Province and allowing forests to thrive on the Atlantic coast . Patagonia is located between the subtropical high pressure belt and the subpolar low pressure zone , meaning it is exposed to westerly winds that are strong , since south of 40 ° S there is little land to block these winds . Because Patagonia is located between the semi @-@ permanent anticyclones of the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean at around 30 ° S , and the Subpolar Low at around 60 ° S , the movement of the high and low pressure systems along with ocean currents determine the precipitation pattern . 
 The influence of the Pacific Ocean , general circulation patterns , and the topographic barrier caused by the Andes results in one of the strongest precipitation gradients in the world . Precipitation steeply decreases from west to east , ranging from 4 @,@ 000 mm ( 160 in ) in the west on the Andean foothills at 41 ° S to 150 mm ( 6 in ) in the central plateaus . The high precipitation in the Andes in this region allows forests to thrive as well as glaciers and permanent snowfields . Most of the region receives less than 200 mm ( 8 in ) of precipitation per year . The aridity of the region is due to the combination of low precipitation , strong winds , and high temperatures in the summer months , all of which cause high evaporation rates . In most of Patagonia , precipitation is concentrated in the winter months , except for the northeastern and southern parts , where precipitation is more evenly distributed . Thunderstorms are infrequent , occurring only during summer . Snowfall occurs mainly in the west and south , which can result in strong snowstorms . 
 Patagonia 's temperatures are relatively cold for its latitude due to the cold Malvinas Current and the high altitude . A characteristic of the temperature pattern is the NW – SE distribution of isotherms due to the presence of the Andes . The warmest parts of the region are in northern parts of Rio Negro Province and Neuquén Province , where mean annual temperatures range from 13 to 15 ° C ( 55 to 59 ° F ) , while the coldest are in western Santa Cruz Province and Tierra del Fuego Province , where mean temperatures range from 5 to 8 ° C ( 41 to 46 ° F ) . At higher altitudes in the Andes stretching from Neuquén Province to Tierra del Fuego Province , mean annual temperatures are below 5 ° C ( 41 ° F ) . Strong westerly winds can decrease the perception of temperature ( wind chill ) , particularly in summer . The annual range of temperatures in Patagonia is lower than at similar latitudes in the northern hemisphere owing to the narrowness of the region at higher latitudes and the stronger maritime influence .

 = = = Floods = = = 
 Argentina 's geomorphic characteristics make the country highly vulnerable to floods . These floods can damage infrastructure , cause loss of life , increase the risk of diseases , and negatively impact agricultural productivity , which is one of the main economic activities of the country . Many of the large Argentinean cities and agriculturally productive areas lie near rivers . The plains are at highest risk for flooding , particularly in the northeastern and central parts of the country , including Greater Buenos Aires . This is because these plains , which cover 35 % of the land area in the country ( including the Chaco and Pampean areas ) , are characterized by a flat landscape , which can impede proper water drainage . Both the Parana and Paraguay basins have a flat landscape and are thus highly susceptible to flooding due to river overflows following high rainfall . These floods can last for months , particularly in the Parana River , owing to its large basin . In the most extreme case , during the year 1982 – 1983 , the floods in the Parana River persisted for more than a year , negatively impacting the area both socially and economically . Major flooding events in the Parana River include those of 1992 and 1997 and have been more frequent since the 1980s due to higher precipitation trends . Similarly , in Buenos Aires Province , flooding occurs due to river overflows and poor water drainage ; major flooding events in the province occurred in 1987 , 2002 / 2003 , 2012 and in 2014 , causing damage to agriculture production . Most of the flooding events occur in El Niño years owing to higher rainfall . Flooding can also affect Patagonia and urban centers in the northwest , but the number of people affected and economic losses are lower than those in the Pampas owing to lower population densities . Flooding can jeopardize access to safe water . A leptospirosis outbreak occurred following a flood in 1998 . 
 = = = Droughts and dust storms = = = 
 Argentina is highly dependent on water supplies originating outside its borders , making it highly vulnerable to changes in water supply due to climate change . Droughts are frequent and devastating . Several years of droughts during the last decade have severely affected agricultural production and reduced economic growth . A drought in 2009 was the worst drought in more than 50 years . Many cattle died of hunger , and huge swaths of soy , corn and wheat fields were affected . It was estimated that the country lost more than US $ 5 billion from the drought . A drought in 2011 affected farming of soy and corn , causing losses of US $ 2 @.@ 5 billion . 
 Drier parts of the country are highly prone to dust storms . These include areas west of Buenos Aires , which can average more than eight dust storms per year , and parts of Patagonia , owing to its aridity and windy climate . Certain areas in the Altiplano are also highly prone to dust storms owing to extensive areas of closed depressions and the presence of salt flats that erode the rock , which becomes a source of fine material that can travel large distances during periods of strong wind . Dust storms are more frequent during droughts , particularly in agricultural areas . Dust storms can effect large areas , leading to numerous impacts . These dust storms can lead to loss of crop and livestock , affecting the local economy . Productive topsoil may be lost during dust storms , leading to loss in soil productivity , which can increase soil erosion and negatively affect crop productivity in the long term . In addition to the impact on agriculture , dust storms can damage cars and buildings , lower visibility on roads , affect air quality , and affect water quality in rivers and lakes . 
 = = = Tornados and severe storms = = = 
 Argentina experiences frequent tornados each year . Tornados occur in the South American " tornado alley " ( Spanish : <unk> de los Tornados ) , which includes the provinces of Entre Ríos , Córdoba Province , Santa Fe , La Pampa and Greater Buenos Aires . The frequency of tornadoes is similar to the one found in Tornado Alley in North America . However , there is no exact number of tornado occurrences per year , owing to the lack of data . These regions have the most frequent and intense mesoscale convective systems . Tornados occur between November and April . In this region , which occupies most of the Pampas , cold air from Patagonia meets warm , humid air from Brazil with dry air coming from the Andes . When these air masses collide , they can produce intense storms , frequently becoming supercells that can produce tornados . With a larger number of convective storms , there is a higher chance that some of these storms will produce tornados . Most tornados are relatively weak and rarely cause deaths . The strongest tornado recorded in Argentina occurred in 1973 when a tornado struck San Justo , Santa Fe . The tornado was an F5 on the Fujita scale , with winds up to 500 km / h ( 310 mph ) , making it the worst tornado in Latin America and the Caribbean . 
 Severe storms impact large cities more often and can damage cars , houses and disrupt public services such as transportation and collection and disposal of urban solid waste . The foothills of the Andes and the Sierras de Cordoba are vulnerable to hail . This is because the Andes force humid air from the Atlantic upwards , intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms , making hail more likely . Mendoza , a city located in the Andean foothills , experiences frequent hailstorms that can impact the agriculture of the region . Hailstorms have caused serious losses in both urban and rural areas . It is estimated that wine and fruit production experience yearly losses of US $ 50 million and US $ 30 million , respectively , due to hail . Most of these hailstorms occur in the summer although they can occur in winter , particularly in the east where warm and humid air from the north frequently collides with cold air from the south , leading to convective thunderstorms that can produce hail . 
 Storm surges caused by extratropical cyclones have been recorded along the coastal areas . These storm surges are formed from strong winds that blow towards the land . They are formed due to the interaction between the semi @-@ permanent South Pacific High and a low pressure system over the Atlantic , southeast of Argentina , creating strong winds from the south or southwest . The sudestada , which brings the worst storm surges , occurs when there is a high pressure system over southern Argentina in the Atlantic Ocean that interacts with a low pressure over Uruguay and southern Brazil , causing strong winds from the southeast . Storm surges have caused flooding of coastal areas , leading to extensive property loss and other damage . It is also the main natural factor in the erosion of coastlines . The flooding as a result of storm surges are particularly destructive in flat coastal areas such as the Rio de La Plata shores , and the Salado Basin . 
 = = = <unk> and cold waves = = = 
 Argentina regularly receives cold air from the south that can reach low latitudes owing to the influence of the Andes . Cold waves are usually accompanied with severe snowstorms or extremely cold conditions that can have a devastating impact on the country 's economy . These snowstorms and / or extremely cold conditions can partially or completely paralyze activities in large areas of Patagonia and the center of the country . In addition , cold conditions can lead to energy shortages during the winter months due to increased demand . The low temperatures brought by these cold waves can cause frosts that can damage plants , severely affecting agricultural production and devastating the local economy . 
 = = Climate change = = 
 According to the national government and scientists , climate change is predicted to have a significant effect on the climate of Argentina . There has been an increase in annual precipitation in almost all of Argentina during the 20th century , particularly in the northeast and the center of the country , where agricultural production has expanded to the west by more than 100 km ( 62 mi ) in areas that were previously too dry during middle of the 20th century . In contrast , the Andean part of Patagonia , along with the Cuyo region , has seen a decrease in precipitation , leading to a reduction in river flow in the last 100 years . These trends were observed with an increase in the river – stream flows in most of the country , excluding rivers originating from the Andes , and an increase in extreme precipitation events that led to considerable socioeconomic losses . The increase in precipitation has led to more variability in precipitation from year to year in the northern parts of the country , with a higher risk of prolonged droughts . 
 Mean temperatures have increased by 0 @.@ 5 ° C ( 0 @.@ 9 ° F ) between 1901 and 2012 , slightly lower than the global average . Temperatures in the Andean part of Patagonia have increased by more than 1 ° C ( 1 @.@ 8 ° F ) , which has caused the retreat of almost all of the glaciers . This is affecting water availability to the arid areas of the country that depend on glacier meltwater . Higher temperatures can reduce winter snowfall , causing river flow to decrease , which in turn can reduce hydroelectric energy production ; losses of up to 40 % have been observed . In the last half of the 20th century , the lack of snow in the highest peaks in the Cuyo region has impacted agriculture and viticulture production due to the decrease in available water in the rivers . Outside of Patagonia , mean temperatures have increased at a slower rate since the increase in minimum temperatures is counteracted by the decrease in maximum temperatures . There has been a decrease in the number of days with frost , and there have been increases in the frequency of hot nights and heat waves throughout the country . 
 Within the next two or three decades ( 2016 – 2035 ) , mean temperatures are predicted to increase by 0 @.@ 5 to 1 @.@ 0 ° C ( 0 @.@ 9 to 1 @.@ 8 ° F ) under the two scenarios ( RCP 4 @.@ 5 and RCP 8 @.@ 5 ) from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report . In both scenarios , the projected warming will be more pronounced during the summer months . The predicted trend for precipitation is not as clear as the one for temperature . In the northern and central regions , precipitation is predicted to increase while in most of central – western Argentina and Patagonia , precipitation is predicted to decrease . Because Argentina is potentially vulnerable to climate change , such projected changes based on the models could exacerbate current problems or create new problems associated with climate change in Argentina . 
 Scientists predict that glaciers will continue to recede and melt or , in some areas , disappear . It is also predicted that the Cuyo region could face a potential water crisis due to an increase in water demand caused by a reduction in river <unk> . In northern Patagonia , a similar situation is projected in which there will be a negative impact on fruit and vegetable growing owing to a reduction in the river flow in the Colorado and Chubut rivers . In the north and central parts of the country , the higher temperatures and lower precipitation projected for this region will lead to higher evaporation , intensifying droughts and leading to desertification . Heat waves could become more frequent and intense , negatively impacting agricultural production while placing more demand on energy needs . Intense precipitation could become more common , increasing the likelihood of suffering from events such as flooding , since most of its population lives in urban areas near a body of water ( rivers , lakes and oceans ) . Climate change could extend the habitats of vectors carrying tropical diseases such as malaria southwards . Though most of the coastal regions of Argentina will not suffer permanent flooding associated with sea level rise , it is predicted that storm surges will become more frequent in coastal areas , affecting locations such as Buenos Aires .

 After finishing high school , Velvet McIntyre moved to Oregon in 1980 to train with Sandy Barr , under whom she trained with her future opponent and tag team partner , Princess Victoria . McIntyre made her professional wrestling debut in Idaho in 1980 , but she did not begin wrestling full @-@ time until three months later . She then joined Vancouver 's All Star Wrestling in 1981 , where she feuded with Princess Victoria . She continued to feud with Victoria for the remainder of the year in both singles and tag team matches in Vancouver and the NWA Pacific Northwest under promoter Don Owen . In 1982 , however , she joined the World Wrestling Federation where she began teaming with Princess Victoria , and in March , the duo lost a series of matches against the team of The Fabulous Moolah and Wendi Richter . McIntyre , however , defeated Richter in two separate matches in Bill Watts 's Mid @-@ South Wrestling Association . In November and December 1982 , McIntyre worked for Stampede Wrestling , where she teamed with Judy Martin against Richter and Joyce Grable ; the feud between the two teams resumed in April 1983 in Verne Gagne 's American Wrestling Association . 
 In May 1983 , McIntyre returned to Stampede Wrestling , where she continued her rivalry with Richter and Grable ; this time , however , she teamed once again with Princess Victoria . Victoria and McIntyre won the NWA Women 's World Tag Team Championship on May 13 in Calgary .

 In 1983 , the World Wrestling Federation withdrew from the National Wrestling Alliance , and when McIntyre and Victoria rejoined the promotion in 1984 , they were immediately recognized as holding the WWF Women 's Tag Team Championship . The duo defended the championship against the team of Wendi Richter and Peggy Lee . Desiree Petersen later replaced Victoria in the team , and the new duo lost the title in August 1985 to Judy Martin and Leilani Kai ( known as The Glamour Girls ) in Egypt . 
 McIntyre then began wrestling as a singles wrestler , immediately feuding with The Fabulous Moolah , unsuccessfully challenging her at Wrestlemania 2 ( the referee counted the pin on McIntyre despite her left leg being draped over the bottom rope which should have stopped the count ) . She won the WWF Women 's Championship on July 3 , 1986 when she defeated Moolah at the Brisbane Festival Hall on the WWF 's 1986 Australian tour , but re @-@ lost the title to Moolah six days later at the Sydney Entertainment Centre ( the only two times the WWF Women 's Championship changed hands in the Southern Hemisphere ) . Years later , Moolah called McIntyre the best female wrestler in Canada . In 1987 , McIntyre consistently lost matches to Moolah and Sherri Martel . She also competed at the Survivor Series , teaming with Moolah , Rockin ' Robin , and the Jumping Bomb Angels against Martel , Leilani Kai , Judy Martin , Donna Christanello , and Dawn Marie . By 1990 , however , the women 's division in the WWF was again on hiatus .

 = History of the Ottawa Senators ( 1992 – ) = 
 Founded and established by Ottawa real estate developer Bruce Firestone , the Ottawa Senators are the second National Hockey League ( NHL ) franchise to have the Ottawa Senators name . The original Ottawa Senators , founded in 1883 , had a famed history , winning 11 Stanley Cups and played in the NHL from 1917 until 1934 . On December 6 , 1990 , after a two @-@ year public campaign by Firestone to return the NHL to Ottawa , the NHL awarded a new franchise , which began play in the 1992 – 93 season . 
 The club has seen its share of struggles , both on and off the ice . The team has had two changes of ownership , from Firestone to Rod Bryden in 1993 due to the arena development process and its financing , and subsequently to Eugene Melnyk after the team filed for bankruptcy in 2003 . On the ice , the club finished last in the League in its first four seasons . Changes in hockey management have led to steady improvement of the team 's play , resulting in the team qualifying for the Stanley Cup playoffs in 11 of the last 12 seasons , winning the Presidents ' Trophy in 2002 – 03 and making it to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2007 . 
 = = The " Bring back the Senators " campaign = = 
 At the weekly Terrace Investments Ltd. management meeting on December 4 , 1987 , Duncan MacDonald tabled the initial idea of the NHL coming to Ottawa after learning ( Ottawa Citizen , Sports section ) about the League 's expansion plans for three new <unk> in the 1990s . The idea incubated with real estate developer Bruce Firestone for months and accepted that Ottawa was now ready to again support a franchise . He decided to launch a bid for the Ottawa franchise through his development firm Terrace Investments . Firestone first told his fellow Terrace executives , Cyril Leeder , and Randy Sexton , after a game of shinny hockey in March 1988 . Both were surprised ; Leeder thought the idea was " ridiculous " . 
 Terrace did not have enough assets to finance the team , but Firestone believed that they could do so as part of a development project . Their plan was to build a mini @-@ city ( named West Terrace ) of 9 @,@ 000 around a $ 100 million arena and hotel development on approximately 500 acres ( 2 @.@ 0 km2 ) . Getting an NHL club for the arena would drive up the price of the surrounding lands and Terrace 's net worth would jump from $ 100 million to $ 400 million by 1997 . The strategy was straightforward : " Buy the site , win the franchise , build the building . " In 1989 , Terrace found a suitable site west of Ottawa , 600 acres ( 2 @.@ 4 km2 ) of farmland , located on both sides of the 417 Highway west of Terry Fox Drive in the then City of Kanata . 
 On June 22 , 1989 , Terrace publicly announced their intentions to acquire an NHL franchise and revive the Senators name . The name choice provoked threats of legal action , though Firestone obtained permission from original @-@ era / 1950s era Senators club owner Tommy Gorman 's descendants to use the old Senators name and settled with the Ottawa Jr . Senators ' owners . 
 To kick off the " Bring Back the Senators " campaign , Terrace held a press conference with special guests Frank Finnigan , representing the old Senators ' players , and Joe Gorman , representing the Gorman family . Finnigan , the last surviving member of the Senators ' last Stanley Cup championship ( in 1927 ) , was presented with a new number 8 jersey and the promise to have him drop the first puck at the first game if they emerged victorious . Terrace unveiled drawings of the $ 55 million , 22 @,@ 500 seat arena , now named the Palladium , designed by Rossetti Associates , architects of The Palace of Auburn Hills arena . Also unveiled was a logo for the team using a stylized Peace Tower and Canadian flag , designed by David O 'Malley of Ottawa . The theme song for the franchise drive was Tom Petty 's " I Won 't Back Down . " 
 The Senators ' bid was considered something of a longshot . Jim Durrell , the mayor of Ottawa at the time , but later part of the Senators ' front office , said , " It 's not that the area isn 't a big enough market to support a professional hockey team , it 's just that we 're not going to get it . " National Hockey League Players ' Association ( NHLPA ) head Alan Eagleson was quoted as saying , " Local fans are being led through the petunia patch if Bruce Firestone thinks he can land an NHL expansion franchise for Ottawa this century , well into the next or ever . " Despite the naysayers , 11 @,@ 000 fans sent in $ 25 non @-@ refundable pledges toward season @-@ tickets by November 1990 . 
 In December 1990 , the NHL held a meeting in Palm Beach , Florida , to consider expansion applications . The NHL executives were reportedly impressed by the Ottawa presentation , including Finnigan 's participation , the several hundred fans and the marching band who traveled to Palm Beach , but apparently were more impressed at the fact that the group was one of the few applicants willing to pay the $ 50 million franchise fee without reservations . On December 6 , 1990 , the Terrace group was approved to purchase one of the two franchises ( along with the Tampa Bay Lightning ) to start play in the 1992 – 93 season .

 Since the location for the new arena was on land designated for agriculture , the arena and development had to be approved by the Ontario Government . The Ontario New Democratic Party government of Bob Rae was not sympathetic to the conversion of farmland and would not lend any assistance to the project . As the rezoning hearings dragged on , Firestone was offered $ 20 million to relocate to Anaheim , which had an arena , but no team . Firestone turned it down , claiming , " I didn ’ t bring back the Ottawa Senators to play in Anaheim . " Eventually , the rezoning was approved with conditions . The Palladium 's size was reduced to 18 @,@ 500 , and Terrace had to pay for a necessary highway interchange . Terrace had to suspend its plans for the rest of the " West Terrace " development , which limited the site 's value . Only the lands to the south of the 417 were allowed to be developed , and the lands on the north side of the 417 were to remain farmland . According to Firestone , Terrace 's investment lost $ 80 million in value to secure the zoning . Eventually , the strain to complete the payment on the franchise to the NHL and to build the arena led to Firestone 's resignation on August 17 , 1993 , after Terrace missed mortgage and development payments . He was replaced as club president by Bryden , who would lead the franchise for the next ten years . 
 Financing of the arena project was difficult . Terrace had four financing deals fail . As it became clear that the Senators could not finance a needed highway interchange without government backing , the provincial government was persuaded successfully to provide a $ 27 million loan for the highway interchange construction . In the end , the firm of Ogden Entertainment , a New York City facilities management firm , backed the project with a $ 20 million loan in exchange for a 30 @-@ year contract to manage the facility . In addition , American banks loaned $ 110 million , the federal government gave the Senators $ 6 million , $ 10 million from Terrace and $ 15 million from a Canadian pension fund . 
 The Senators played the first game at the Palladium ( today called Canadian Tire Centre ) on January 17 , 1996 . One month after opening , Corel Corporation bought the naming rights and the arena was renamed the Corel Centre ' .

 The debt payments weighed heavily on the Senators . For several years , Bryden tried to reschedule the debt on the arena . There were various attempts at filing tax losses to write off the debt , all rejected by the federal government . In 2002 , Ogden went bankrupt . It had re @-@ invented itself as Covanta Energy and failed not long after the Enron scandal . This led to the Senators filing for bankruptcy on January 9 , 2003 , when it could not arrange financing to pay all it owed to Covanta , becoming due because of Covanta 's bankruptcy . 
 On August 26 , 2003 the team and arena was purchased by <unk> chief executive officer ( CEO ) and Toronto St. Michael 's Majors owner Eugene Melnyk , who had shown interest for several years in the team . The limited partnership between Terrace and the limited partners was dissolved and Covanta 's creditors received the proceeds of the sale towards the money it was owed for the NHL franchise fee and the Palladium .

 The team would name Mel Bridgman as their first general manager ( GM ) in 1991 after being turned down by Scotty Bowman and John Muckler . The decision was criticized by the press due to Bridgman 's lack of GM experience . In the coaching department , the club would pick Rick Bowness , formerly the Boston Bruins ' head coach , as their first head coach , assisted by Alain Vigneault , E. J. Maguire and Chico Resch . John Ferguson , Sr. , would be named director of player personnel . 
 The Expansion draft day on June 18 , 1992 , was memorable . The team 's laptop computer failed and the club was unprepared with a backup plan , picking several ineligible players . Not much talent was available as other teams protected young prospects . The players the Senators did select were " journeymen NHLers or players who had good years in minor leagues but no longer were considered prospects . " While side @-@ deals during the Draft were not allowed , the team would select players in concert with the other teams and in return , other teams gave the Senators Neil Brady , Jody Hull , Brad Marsh and Steve Weeks during the summer , all who would ultimately make the team . In the Entry Draft , the Senators would name Alexei Yashin their first @-@ ever pick , though he would not join the team until 1993 . 
 = = = 1992 – 93 = = = 
 The new Senators played their first game on October 8 , 1992 , at the Ottawa Civic Centre against the Montreal Canadiens . There was much pre @-@ game spectacle — the skating of Brian Orser , the raising of banners commemorating the original Senators ' eight Stanley Cup wins , retirement of Frank Finnigan 's jersey number and the singing of the anthem by Alanis Morissette . 
 NHL President Gil Stein took part , presenting Bruce Firestone with a " certificate of reinstatement " to commemorate Ottawa 's return to the NHL after 58 years . The ceremonial face @-@ off between Laurie Boschman and Denis Savard was done by Frank Finnigan , Jr . , ( his father having died on December 25 , 1991 ) , Firestone , Stein and original Senator Ray Kinsella . The Senators would play in the 10 @,@ 000 seat Civic Centre until January 1996 . 
 The Senators would defeat the eventual Stanley Cup champion Canadiens 5 – 3 that night , but it would turn out to be their only highlight of the season for the Senators . The club would tie with the San Jose Sharks for the worst record in the League that year , winning just ten games with 70 losses and four ties ( 24 points ) in the 1992 – 93 season . The Senators still hold the NHL record for least road wins for their record that season , with one . Their points total for the season was one point better than the NHL record for least points in a season ever . The Senators had aimed low . Firestone had set beating the old record the Senators ' goal for the season , as the team planned to finish low in the standings for its first few years in order to receive high draft picks . 
 Daigle Cup 
 Among the disappointments during the early years of the resurrected Senators was Alexandre Daigle , the number one overall pick in the 1993 NHL Entry Draft . During the 1992 – 93 season , it had become clear that Daigle would be the number one pick . The Quebec Nordiques publicly announced that they would trade several players for him , as they wished to build a new arena and needed a marquee francophone player . As the season progressed , both the Senators and the San Jose Sharks were neck @-@ and @-@ neck in last place , and at that time , NHL rules meant the worst team would receive the first overall pick . This " competition " was variously dubbed the " Daigle Cup " and the " <unk> <unk> . " 
 Near the end of the season , the Senators would call other teams to ask for their opponent 's best players to be playing them in upcoming matches , making plans to field a weaker squad if their opponent did so also . The club made no trades to improve its position , not wanting to lose the number one pick . After the season , Bruce Firestone would make comments to the press about how the team deliberately lost games , expecting that comments would be " off the record . " Instead , his comments were reported , the NHL investigated , and the team was fined $ 100 @,@ 000 for his comments . The NHL changed its rules as of the 1995 Draft so that a lottery would be held for the top draft picks . 
 In 1993 , the Senators would sign Daigle to a $ 12 @.@ 25 million contract , the largest rookie salary in League history , which would lead to a cap on rookie contracts a few years later . The club would promote Daigle over Alexei Yashin , nominating Daigle for rookie of the year over Yashin . His play did not justify full @-@ time status and in 1995 , coaches Rick Bowness and Alain Vigneault demoted Daigle to part @-@ time status . The move led to Bowness and Vigneault being fired . In the end , Daigle did not come close to the career the Senators hoped for . After scoring only 74 goals in just over four seasons , he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers , and is widely regarded as one of the biggest draft busts in sports history . 
 = = = 1993 – 95 = = = 
 After the 1992 – 93 season , Bridgman was fired and replaced by Senators Vice @-@ President Randy Sexton . In the 1993 – 94 season , the club added prospects Daigle and Yashin . Yashin would have an outstanding rookie season and become a finalist for the Calder Memorial Trophy . Yashin led the team in points with 30 goals and 79 points , while Daigle had 51 points . The Senators would make some progress , improving their record to 14 wins and 37 points , but would again finish last in the League . The Senators would select Radek Bonk with their pick , third overall , in the 1994 Draft . 
 During this period , the club may have been more focused on building the Palladium , for which construction began in July 1994 . In the lockout @-@ shortened 1994 – 95 season , Yashin and Daigle led the club in points again , although their point totals declined . The 1994 – 95 Senators team record declined also from the previous season , finishing with nine wins and 23 points ( this was over only 48 games ) , to finish last in the League again . 
 = = 1995 – 98 : Ottawa 's turnaround = = 
 One month before the Senators were to open the new Palladium , after three @-@ straight last place finishes , and poor attendance at the Civic Centre , the Senators organization was in turmoil . Star player Alexei Yashin , angered that management favoured Daigle over him despite posting higher numbers , was a contract hold @-@ out . First @-@ round draft choice Bryan Berard , who had left the Senators training camp unsigned to a contract , had publicly stated that he would never report to the Senators . After Head Coach Rick Bowness demoted Daigle had been demoted to the fourth line , General Manager Randy Sexton fired Bowness and Assistant Coach Alain Vigneault on November 20 , 1995 . He replaced the coaches with Prince Edward Island Senators coach Dave Allison and gave the assistant coaching job to former Hartford Whalers Head Coach Pierre McGuire , who was working at the time as a scout for the Senators . Daigle was returned to full @-@ time duty , but Sexton 's changes did not improve the team 's play . 
 The situation was a large concern for the Senators ownership and especially for Ogden , which had much invested in the soon @-@ to @-@ open Palladium and which did not want to open the Palladium to poor attendance . Ogden brought in Roy <unk> to assist in sorting out the turmoil ; he would eventually become team president and CEO . 
 The turnaround process started with the firing of Sexton on December 11 , 1995 , and the hiring of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim Assistant General Manager Pierre Gauthier as GM , Ottawa 's first with previous NHL executive experience . Before the end of January , Gauthier had signed Yashin to a three @-@ year contract , traded Berard to the New York Islanders for Wade Redden , and hired Jacques Martin as head coach . 
 In the midst of the upheaval , the new Palladium had opened . The Senators , still coached by Allison , lost their opening game in the arena 3 – 0 to Montreal on January 17 , 1996 . The event was much more subdued than their franchise 's first game . The Cup banners were raised , but the winches jammed , blocking the view of many fans . There were no entertainment big names , and only Firestone and Bryden participated in the ceremonial face @-@ off . The club would lose its first four games at the Palladium , winning none for Allison , who was later fired on January 24 after the team lost 22 of 25 games . While Ottawa finished last in the League for the fourth year in a row , the 1995 – 96 season ended with renewed optimism , partly from the debut of new star Daniel Alfredsson , who won the Calder Trophy , the NHL rookie of the year award , the first Senator to do so . Alfredsson , selected 133rd overall in 1994 , was also selected to play in the 1996 NHL All @-@ Star Game . 
 The 1996 – 97 season would see the Senators qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time , in dramatic fashion . They clinched the seventh seed on the last game of the regular season thanks to a late goal from Steve Duchesne against the Buffalo Sabres ' Dominik Hasek , giving the Senators a 1 – 0 win and the first playoff appearance for an Ottawa @-@ based team in 67 years . The Senators then faced Buffalo in the first round of the playoffs and were eliminated in the full seven games . Despite holding a lead in Game 7 , Alexei Yashin put the puck in his own net , allowing Buffalo to tie the game and eventually win the game and the series on a goal by Derek Plante in overtime . 
 The next season , 1997 – 98 , saw the Senators improve further . They improved their regular season record , finishing with their first winning record in franchise history ( one game over .500 ) . In the first play @-@ off round , they upset the top @-@ seeded and the heavily @-@ favoured New Jersey Devils in six games to win their first playoff series . The Senators next faced the eventual Eastern Conference champion Washington Capitals and lost in five games . It was in this season that the team unveiled its " third jersey " in red with the Centurion head logo " rotated " to face forward . The jersey and logo would be used until the end of the 2006 – 07 season . 
 After the season , Rick Dudley would become general manager after Pierre Gauthier returned to Anaheim to become the Ducks ' general manager . Dudley would be the Ottawa GM for only a year , however , leaving to join Tampa Bay ( for which the Senators received Rob <unk> as compensation ) , and was replaced by Marshall Johnston . 
 = = 1998 – 2004 : Emergence as Stanley Cup contenders = = 
 The Senators met with limited success in the playoffs , only winning five series in their first nine trips to the post @-@ season . 
 In 1998 – 99 , the Senators jumped from 14th in the previous season to third , with 103 points — the first 100 @-@ point season in club history . The team , however , took an embarrassing pratfall in the playoffs , being swept by Buffalo after scoring just three goals in the entire series . 
 Ottawa was locked in a contract dispute with then @-@ captain Alexei Yashin during the 1999 – 2000 season . Yashin held out for the entire season , hoping either to play elsewhere or claim his contract was for 1999 – 2000 , not a year of service . The team responded by suspending him for the entire season and granting the captaincy to Daniel Alfredsson . Yashin tried to sign on with a team in Switzerland , but the International Ice Hockey Federation ( IIHF ) banned him from playing internationally until the dispute with the Senators was resolved . An NHL arbitrator rejected Yashin 's request to make him a free agent , instead ruling that he owed the Senators one more season if he ever returned to the NHL . The Senators even took legal action to recover damages suffered as a result of the dispute . 
 Despite the distraction , the Senators ' regular season was successful as they finished with 93 points to qualify for the playoffs in sixth place in the Eastern Conference . Like the previous year , they had a quick playoff exit , losing in six games in the first round to the Toronto Maple Leafs . 
 Yashin returned for the 2000 – 01 season , though no longer the captain of the team . Despite being booed at home and in most arenas , being cursed as " Alexei Cashin " or " Cashin Yashin " by the fans , he played well for the Senators . The Senators had another successful season , finishing with 109 points , winning the Division and placing second in the East . For the third @-@ straight season , however , the Senators could not win a playoff round , losing again to Toronto in the first round , this time in a 4 – 0 sweep . After the season , on the day of the 2001 NHL Entry Draft , Yashin would be dealt to the New York Islanders in exchange for Zdeno Chara , Bill Muckalt and the Islanders ' first @-@ round draft pick ( second overall ) , which the Senators used to select Jason Spezza . Yashin would sign a $ 87 @.@ 5 million ten @-@ year contract with the Islanders . 
 In 2001 – 02 , the Senators regular season points total dropped to 94 points , third in the Division , but the team did qualify for the playoffs . Jacques Martin stepped aside as head coach for the final two games to allow Assistant Coach Roger Neilson to have 1 @,@ 000 games as head coach in the NHL . In the first round , they upset the Philadelphia Flyers in five games , limiting the Flyers ' high @-@ powered offence to just two goals for the franchise 's second playoff series win . This led to a second round series with Toronto , the third @-@ straight year the Senators had met the Maple Leafs in the " Battle of Ontario . " The Maple Leafs won the series in a tense seven @-@ game affair , despite the Senators leading the series 3 – 2 after five games . 
 After the disappointing end to the season , there was speculation that front @-@ office changes were coming . In the end , GM Marshall Johnston retired , but Martin and <unk> were re @-@ signed . John Muckler was hired on June 12 , 2002 , the Senators ' sixth GM , and the first with previous experience as a general manager ( with Buffalo ) . He had been interested in the Ottawa job in 1991 , but he chose not to wait for the Senators to make him an offer , and he joined the Sabres organization . 
 In 2002 – 03 , off @-@ ice problems dominated the headlines . The Senators filed for bankruptcy on January 9 , 2003 , after a long history of debt . They continued regular season play after getting some emergency financing from the NHL . Despite the off @-@ ice problems , Ottawa won the Presidents ' Trophy , finishing with a franchise @-@ record 113 points , making them the first Canadian team to win it since the Calgary Flames in 1989 . This was also the highest finish by an Ottawa team in 77 years ( since the original Senators finished first overall in 1926 ) . In the 2003 playoffs , they defeated Yashin and his New York Islanders and the Philadelphia Flyers before coming within one game of making it into the Finals , falling to the eventual Stanley Cup champions , the New Jersey Devils . 
 = = = 2003 – 04 : End of the Jacques Martin era = = = 
 In the off @-@ season , Eugene Melnyk would purchase the club to bring financial stability and the team entered the 2003 – 04 season with high expectations . Head Coach Jacques Martin would guide the team to another good regular season , finishing with 102 points . This was good for only third in the tightly contested Northeast Division , as Boston would have 104 and Toronto 103 . 
 The seedings meant that the Senators would play the Maple Leafs in the first round of the 2004 playoffs for the fourth @-@ straight time . By now , Ottawa had developed a strong rivalry with their Ontario rivals , and there was a great deal of pressure on the team to finally defeat the Leafs . Despite missing their captain Mats Sundin and other veterans , the Maple Leafs would win the series on the back of goaltender Ed Belfour , who had two shutouts in the series , defeating the Senators in seven games . In Game 7 , Senators goaltender Patrick Lalime would surrender three goals before the first period was done and would be replaced by backup Martin <unk> . The Senators were not able to come back from the 3 – 0 deficit , losing 4 – 1 . It was Lalime 's last appearance in a Senators ' uniform , and Martin 's last game as coach — two days after the loss , Martin was <unk> and Lalime was later traded to the St. Louis Blues for a fourth @-@ round pick in the 2005 NHL Draft . 
 After losing eight of 12 playoff series , including all four series in five years against Toronto , team management felt that a new coach was required for playoff success . Muckler even suggested that the new coach would have " to fix the dressing room " , implying the team was not responding to Martin . On June 8 , 2004 , Bryan Murray became the team 's fifth head coach , leaving the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim , where he had been general manager . He would not actually coach until 2005 due to the 2004 – 05 NHL lockout , instead spending time on scouting .

 2004 – 05 
 Lockout time 
 The Senators , like the other NHL teams , did not play during the lockout . Most players chose to play in Europe , although some , including Jason Spezza , played for the Senators ' farm team , the Binghamton Senators . Prior to the lockout , the Senators had acquired free agent goaltender Dominik Hasek . He did not play for any teams during the season , instead practicing with Binghamton . Daniel Alfredsson had a very good season in Sweden with Frölunda HC , winning the Swedish championship . 
 = = = 2005 – 06 : High expectations unfulfilled = = = 
 The media predicted the Senators to be Stanley Cup contenders , as they had a strong core back after the lockout , played in an up @-@ tempo style fitting the new rule changes and Hasek was expected to provide top @-@ notch goaltending . The team rushed out of the gate , winning 19 of the first 22 games , in the end winning 52 games and 113 points , placing first in the East , and second overall in the League . 
 Prior to the season , the Senators had acquired Dany Heatley in a blockbuster trade with the Atlanta Thrashers for Marian Hossa and Greg DeVries . Heatley , Alfredsson and Spezza immediately formed one of the League 's top offensive lines , dubbed the " CASH line " by fans in a contest held by the Ottawa Citizen . ( The name is made from the initials of Captain Alfredsson , Spezza , and Heatley . Another nickname the line has picked up is the " Pizza Line " , and is the nickname used by the Citizen 's rival paper , the Ottawa Sun . ) The line made a dramatic debut in the first game , with Alfredsson scoring a goal to force overtime and Alfredsson and Heatley scoring goals in the League 's first @-@ ever shootout round . Heatley became the first player in franchise history to reach 100 points and the first to reach the 50 @-@ goal mark . The line is notable as a top offensive line , the top line of all time for the Senators , and is widely regarded as one of the top lines in the NHL earning such quotes as " best trio in the NHL , " " most dangerous line in hockey , " " high @-@ flying trio , " " League 's highest scoring line " and " potent first line " in the sports media and hockey fans , both of the Senators and other teams . 
 Despite the regular season success , the team entered the playoffs under a cloud . In February , Hasek had suffered an adductor muscle injury while playing for the Czech Republic men 's national ice hockey team during the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin . He had played only one game for the Czechs and returned to Ottawa to heal , but would never play for the Senators again . Rookie goaltender Ray Emery had to take over the starting goaltender duties , leading the media to predict an early playoff exit due to Hasek 's absence . Hopes were raised in the first round , however , when Emery would become the first rookie goaltender since Philadelphia 's Brian Boucher in 2000 to win a playoff series when the Senators defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning four games to one . However , the Senators then lost to the Buffalo Sabres in the second round , a series in which all games were decided by one goal . 
 This was the last hurrah for several Senators , as Zdeno Chara , Dominik Hasek , Martin Havlat , Bryan Smolinski and Brian Pothier all left the team after the season ; Chara , Hasek and Pothier departed via free agency , while Havlat and Smolinski were both dealt to the Chicago Blackhawks . 
 = = = 2006 – 07 : Trip to the Stanley Cup Finals = = = 
 The Senators ' season went off to a poor start , and was marked by a struggle to reach a .500 win @-@ loss ratio . Until December , the team had a 21 – 18 – 1 record , though they had much more success in the remaining half of the season , eventually finishing second in the Division after the Presidents ' Trophy @-@ winning Sabres and earning the fourth seed in the East . They ultimately finished with 105 points , their fourth @-@ straight 100 @-@ point season and sixth in their last eight . 
 In the playoffs , Ottawa 's fourth placing in the Conference meant that the first @-@ round playoff series was against the fifth @-@ seeded Pittsburgh Penguins . Some media were expecting the Penguins to win the series for three reasons — the Penguins had won the season series , the Senators ' past playoff troubles and the strong young talent of the Penguins , particularly young star Sidney Crosby . The Senators , however , won easily by a score of four games to one , including a 3 – 0 shutout win in Game 5 . This was the only series where the Senators were the higher @-@ seeded team . 
 The second @-@ round series was against the Atlantic Division @-@ leading New Jersey Devils in a rematch of the 2003 Eastern Conference Finals . The Senators again won by a score of four games to one . 
 Next , the Senators faced off against Buffalo in the Conference Final , looking to get even for losing to the Sabres in the 2006 playoffs . The Senators took the series , again by a score of four games to one , earning the Prince of Wales Trophy as the Eastern Conference champions and advancing to the Stanley Cup Finals to face the Western Conference @-@ winning Anaheim Ducks . Daniel Alfredsson scored the series @-@ winning goal , ( see video ) in overtime , redemption for being beaten a year before on the goal that eliminated Ottawa from the playoffs . It was also the first series win by the Senators against the Sabres . 
 First Stanley Cup finals in the capital in 80 years 
 The 2006 – 07 Senators thus became the first Ottawa team to be in the Stanley Cup Finals since the 1927 Stanley Cup Finals . Despite the 80 @-@ year gap , one fan attended games both the 1927 and the 2007 Finals — the third game of the series and first home game for Ottawa on June 2 was attended by 99 @-@ year @-@ old Russell Williams as a guest of the Senators . He had attended the last Finals game in Ottawa on April 13 , 1927 , played in the old Ottawa Auditorium . Both the 1927 and 2007 games were won by the Senators . 
 The city was swept up in the excitement of being in the Finals . Businesses along all the main streets posted large hand @-@ drawn " Go Sens Go " signs , residents put up large displays in front of their homes or decorated their cars . A large Senators flag was draped on the City Hall , along with a large video screen showing the games . A six @-@ story likeness of Daniel Alfredsson was hung on the Corel building and the Senators organization held rallies at City Hall , and car rallies of decorated cars paraded from Lynx stadium , through downtown to Scotiabank Place . 
 The series marked the first time that an NHL team with a captain from Europe had made the Finals , as Senators captain Alfredsson hails from Sweden . ( Previously , only Americans or Canadians had captained teams in the Finals . ) Alfredsson would be one of the bright lights for the Senators in the series , as he had been in all the playoff series . But he would be one of the few bright lights as Anaheim won the series in five games bolstered by strong defensive play and opportunistic scoring . 
 The first two games were in Anaheim , both won by the Ducks by one @-@ goal margins . Game 3 went to the Senators , but Game 4 in Ottawa was won by the Ducks , for an insurmountable three games to one lead . The Ducks would finish the series in Game 5 at home . The Ducks had been favoured to win the Cup since before the season started . The Senators were the third consecutive Canadian franchise to reach the Final and they suffered the same fate as the Calgary Flames of 2004 and the Edmonton Oilers of 2006 . 
 = = = 2007 – 08 : Stanley Cup hangover = = = 
 The Senators made major changes in their hockey staff during the off @-@ season . On June 17 , 2007 , General Manager John Muckler was fired ; he had been in the last year of his contract . Head Coach Bryan Murray was subsequently promoted to GM . On July 5 , 2007 , he hired his nephew Tim Murray as assistant GM , followed by the promotion of Assistant Coach John Paddock to head coach on July 6 , 2007 . On August 15 , Goaltending Coach Ron Low was named as assistant coach while Eli Wilson was named goaltending coach . Assistant Coach Greg Carvel retained his duties . 
 On November 5 , 2007 , the Senators set a franchise record eighth @-@ straight win with their victory over the Maple Leafs . On November 6 , six Senators were named to the All @-@ Star Game ballot : Daniel Alfredsson , Ray Emery , Dany Heatley , Chris Phillips , Wade Redden and Jason Spezza , the most from any one team in the NHL . The " CASH line " was named to the All @-@ Star roster in its entirety , Alfredsson to the starting lineup and Dany Heatley and Jason Spezza as reserves . On January 24 , 2008 , Alfredsson recorded a franchise @-@ record seven points ( three goals and four assists ) against the Tampa Bay Lightning , taking over the NHL scoring lead momentarily . 
 After the hot start , a prolonged slump through January and February occurred during which the Senators won only seven of 21 games , and Murray fired Head Coach Paddock and Assistant Coach Ron Low on February 27 , 2008 , taking over the coaching duties himself . After the coaching switch , team performance improved but did not match the performance of the beginning of the season . A playoff spot was in doubt until the Senators ' last game of the season , a loss to Boston , but the team qualified due to the Carolina Hurricanes losing . After all other games were played , the team ended up as the seventh seed and faced the Pittsburgh Penguins in the opening round , a repeat of the 2007 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals . The Senators lost the series four games to none , the third time they were swept in a first @-@ round series . The result , after going to the Finals the previous season , led to speculation by the media that the team would make a large change in personnel before next season , including the buy @-@ out of Ray Emery and the Senators not re @-@ signing their free agents . 
 = = = 2008 – 09 : Season of turnover = = = 
 After a disappointing 2007 – 08 season , Senators ' management promised change , and in the off @-@ season fulfilled that promise with changes both in coaching and on @-@ ice personnel . On June 13 , 2008 , the Senators named Craig Hartsburg , who had been head coach of the OHL 's Sault Ste . Marie Greyhounds , as the new head coach , signing him to a three @-@ year contract . The Senators also named Curtis Hunt , formerly of the Regina Pats , as assistant coach . On the player side , the first change was the buy @-@ out of troubled goaltender Ray Emery 's contract following a difficult season . Long @-@ time Senator Wade Redden left via free @-@ agency , and 2007 – 08 trade acquisitions Mike Commodore , Cory Stillman and Martin Lapointe were not re @-@ signed . Brian McGrattan and Andrej Meszaros were traded , Meszaros following a contract dispute . From the free agent market , the Senators signed goaltender Alex Auld , defenceman Jason Smith , and agitating forward Jarkko Ruutu . In exchange for Meszaros , defencemen Filip Kuba , Alexandre Picard and a 2009 first @-@ round draft pick ( later dealt for defenceman Chris Campoli ) were acquired from the Tampa Bay Lightning . 
 To start the 2008 – 09 season , the Senators played their first @-@ ever games in Europe , starting in Gothenburg , Sweden , playing Daniel Alfredsson 's former team , Frölunda HC . The Senators then began the regular season with two games in Stockholm against the Pittsburgh Penguins , splitting the results in a 4 – 3 overtime loss and a 3 – 1 win . The Senators struggled throughout the first half of the season , having the lowest number of goals scored in the League . Following a disappointing 17 – 24 – 7 start , the Senators fired Hartsburg on February 1 , 2009 , after a 7 – 4 loss to the Washington Capitals . He was replaced by Cory Clouston , the head coach of their farm team in Binghamton . The team showed almost immediate improvement under Clouston , playing above .500 for the remainder of the season . Though much improved , the team was unable to make up for its poor start , and was officially eliminated from playoff contention on March 31 . The team continued to play well , winning nine games in a row at home . On April 8 , Clouston was rewarded with a two @-@ year deal to continue coaching the Senators . 
 = = = 2009 – 10 : Return to the playoffs = = = 
 After the season had concluded , word was leaked that star forward Heatley had demanded a trade , placing GM Murray in a precarious position . On June 30 , a deal to Edmonton was finalized , but Heatley rejected it by refusing to waive his no @-@ trade clause . On September 12 , 2009 , Heatley was traded , along with a fifth @-@ round pick in 2010 NHL Entry Draft , to the San Jose Sharks in exchange for forwards Milan Michalek and Jonathan Cheechoo , as well as a second @-@ round pick in the 2010 NHL Draft . Michalek would play well for the Senators , but Cheechoo struggled and was demoted to the Binghamton Senators before having his contract bought out in the off @-@ season . 
 On January 13 , 2010 , Bryan Murray relieved Goaltending Coach Eli Wilson of his duties . Immediately afterward , the team went on a team @-@ record 11 @-@ game winning streak . The streak propelled the team to the top of the Northeast Division standings and a top @-@ three placing for the playoffs . The team was unable to hold off the Sabres for the division lead , but qualified for the playoffs in the fifth position . For the third season in four , the Senators played off against the Penguins in the first round . A highlight for the Senators was winning a triple @-@ overtime fifth game in Pittsburgh , but the team was unable to win a playoff game on home ice , losing the series in six games . 
 = = = 2010 – 11 : Rebuilding = = = 
 The Senators had a much poorer than expected 2010 – 11 campaign , resulting in constant rumours of a shakeup right through until December . The rumours were heightened in January after the team went on a lengthy losing streak . January was a dismal month for the Senators , winning only one game all month . Media speculated on the imminent firing of Clouston , Murray or both . Owner <unk> cleared the air in an article in the January 22 , 2011 edition of the Ottawa Sun . Melnyk stated that he would not fire either Clouston or Murray , but that he had given up on this season and was in the process of developing a plan for the future . On Monday , January 24 , the Toronto Globe and Mail reported that the plan included hiring a new general manager before the June entry draft and that Murray would be retained as an advisor to the team . A decision on whether to retain Clouston would be made by the new general manager . The article by Roy MacGregor , a long @-@ time reporter of the Ottawa Senators , stated that former Assistant Coach Pierre McGuire had already been interviewed . Murray , in a press conference that day stated that he wished to stay on as the team 's general manager . He also stated that Melnyk was allowing him to continue as general manager without restraint . Murray said that the players were now to be judged by their play until the February 28 trade deadline . Murray would attempt to move " a couple , at least " of the players for draft picks or prospects at that time if the Senators remained out of playoff contention . At the time of Murray 's comments the team was eight games under .500 and 14 points out of a playoff position after 49 games . 
 Murray started with the trading of Mike Fisher to the Nashville Predators in exchange for a first @-@ round pick in the 2011 draft . Fisher already had a home in Nashville with new wife Carrie Underwood . The trading of Fisher , a fan favorite in Ottawa , lead to a small anti @-@ Underwood backlash in the city with the banning of her songs from the play lists of some local radio stations . Murray next traded Chris Kelly , another veteran , to the Boston Bruins for a second @-@ round pick in the 2011 draft . A few days later , pending unrestricted free agent Jarkko Ruutu was sent to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for a sixth @-@ round pick in 2011 . A swap of goaltenders was made with the Colorado Avalanche which brought Craig Anderson to Ottawa in exchange for Brian Elliott . Both goalies were having sub @-@ par seasons prior to the trade . Under @-@ achieving forward Alex Kovalev was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins for a seventh @-@ round draft pick . On trade deadline day , Ottawa picked up goaltender Curtis McElhinney on waivers , and traded Chris Campoli with a seventh @-@ round pick to the Chicago Blackhawks for a second @-@ round pick and Ryan Potulny . Goaltender Anderson played very well down the stretch for Ottawa , and the team quickly signed the soon @-@ to @-@ be unrestricted free agent to a four @-@ year contract . After media speculation on the future of Murray within the organization , Murray was re @-@ signed as general manager on April 8 , to a three @-@ year extension . On April 9 , Head Coach Cory Clouston and assistants Greg Carvel and Brad Lauer were dismissed from their positions . Murray said that the decision was made based on the fact that the team entered the season believing it was a contender , but finished with a 32 – 40 – 10 record . Former Detroit Red Wings Assistant Coach Paul MacLean was hired as Clouston 's replacement on June 14 , 2011 .

 As the 2011 – 12 season began , many hockey writers and commentators were convinced that the Senators would finish at or near the bottom of the NHL standings . In the midst of rebuilding , the Ottawa lineup contained many rookies and inexperienced players . The team struggled out of the gate , losing five of their first six games before a reversal of fortunes saw them win six games in a row . In December 2011 , the team acquired forward Kyle Turris from the Phoenix Coyotes in exchange for David <unk> and a draft pick . The team improved its play afterwards and moved into a playoff position before the All @-@ Star Game . For the first time in Senators ' history , the All @-@ Star Game was held in Ottawa , and it was considered a great success . Five Senators were voted in or named to the event , including Daniel Alfredsson , who was named captain of one team . The team continued its playoff push after the break . After starting goalie Craig Anderson injured his hand in a kitchen accident at home , the Senators called up Robin Lehner from Binghamton and acquired highly regarded goaltender Ben Bishop from the St. Louis Blues . While Anderson recovered , the team continued its solid play . On April 1 , 2012 , the Senators defeated the New York Islanders 5 – 1 , officially ensuring a playoff position . The team finished as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference , drawing a first round playoff matchup against the Conference champion New York Rangers . Ultimately , Ottawa lost the series in seven games . 
 = = = 2012 – 13 : Renewing success = = = 
 The next season , Ottawa would be challenged to repeat the success they had in 2011 – 12 , due to long @-@ term injuries to key players such as Erik Karlsson , Jason Spezza , Milan Michalek and Craig Anderson . Despite these injuries , the Senators would finish seventh in the Eastern Conference and head coach Paul MacLean would go on to win the Jack Adams Award as the NHL 's coach of the year . Ottawa would play the second @-@ seeded Montreal Canadiens in the first round of the playoffs , eventually winning in five games , blowing out Montreal 6 – 1 in games three and five . The Senators would advance to play the top @-@ seeded Pittsburgh Penguins in the second round , this time losing in five games . During the off @-@ season , the Senators traded veteran defenceman Sergei Gonchar to the Dallas Stars in exchange for a sixth @-@ round draft pick in 2013 . July 5 , 2013 would be a day of mixed emotions for the city and fans , as long @-@ time captain Daniel Alfredsson signed a one @-@ year contract with the Detroit Red Wings , leaving Ottawa after 17 seasons with the Senators and 14 as captain . The signing shocked numerous fans across the city and many within the Senators organization . The day finished optimistically however , as Murray acquired star forward Bobby Ryan from the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for forwards Jakob Silfverberg , Stefan <unk> and a first @-@ round draft pick in 2014 . Murray would also sign free agent forward Clarke MacArthur to a two @-@ year contract that same day and would sign free agent defenceman Joe Corvo to a one @-@ year contract three days later on July 8 . 
 = = = 2013 – 14 : A season of change and disappointment = = = 
 For the 2013 – 14 season , the League re @-@ aligned and Ottawa was moved to the new Atlantic Division along with the rest of the old Northeast Division and the Columbus Blue Jackets and Detroit Red Wings from the Western Conference . The re @-@ alignment increased the competition to qualify for the playoffs , as there was now 16 teams in the East fighting for eight playoff spots . There were changes on the club as well . Ottawa entered the season with Jason Spezza as the team 's new captain as long @-@ time captain Daniel Alfredsson left to join the Detroit Red Wings after a contract dispute with the club . The same day that Alfredsson signed , the club swung a deal for Anaheim Ducks ' scorer Bobby Ryan . There were numerous other changes to the lineup as well . The club signed free agents Clarke MacArthur and Joe Corvo , while not re @-@ signing veteran defencemen Sergei Gonchar and Andre Benoit . While MacArthur had a career season , Ryan played well until he was injured , and Corvo lost his place in the lineup . The club struggled on defence , with shots and goals against increasing from the previous season . The club was a sub-.500 team much of the season , or only a few games above and never was in a playoff position all season . At the NHL trade deadline , Murray traded for flashy right winger Ales Hemsky from Edmonton and he played well , establishing chemistry on a line alongside Jason Spezza and Milan Michalek , though the club was eliminated from playoff contention in the last week of the season . 
 = = Logo and jersey design = = 
 The team colours are red , black and white , like the original era Senators , and like other Ottawa sports teams ( such as the Ottawa Renegades , Rough Riders and <unk> ) , with added trim of gold . The colours are attributed to the colours of the defunct Ottawa Amateur Athletic Association , the Ottawa Hockey Club being a member club . 
 The club logo is officially the head of a Roman general , a member of the Senate of the Roman Empire , projecting from a gold circle . There have been several versions of the team logo . The original , unveiled on May 23 , 1991 , described the general as a " centurion figure , strong and prominent " according to its designer , Tony Milchard . Milchard intended the logo to be similar to that of the Chicago Blackhawks head logo . Leaked before its unveiling , the logo design was unpopular with fans , being compared unfavourably to the American Express card , the USC Trojans and the Trojan condom . The original had the words " Ottawa Senators " within the circle . This logo was slightly revised in 1996 to remove the team name from the gold circle and replace it with laurels . 
 The original home jersey was white with black and red stripes . The original ' away ' jersey was black , with white and red trim . Shoulder patches used a winged ' S ' ' established <unk> ' ( 1894 ) logo . The League changed its policies on coloured and white jerseys and the white jersey became the away jersey . The club would use the white jersey with the original logo until the end of the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals . 
 In 1998 , the Senators unveiled a new logo , taking the head , which had been in profile , and rotating it so that it was face @-@ first . The new logo was unveiled with a new red ' third ' jersey , prominently using ' curved ' or ' <unk> ' stripes . On the shoulder , the original logo was used as a shoulder patch . The original dark jersey , ( then the ' away ' jersey ) which was mostly black , was retired after the season . The red jersey became the home jersey and it remained in use until the end of the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals . 
 Starting in July 2000 , the Senators reused the alternate logo on another third jersey , designed by Ottawa firm <unk> Brunet , this one black with red and gold sleeves and a gold stripe with laurel leaves along the bottom of the jersey . On the shoulders , was a modified version of the original Peace Tower logo of the expansion campaign , which the management liked . Like the original logo , this design was leaked onto the Internet . This jersey was in use until the end of the 2006 – 07 season . 
 = = = 2007 update = = = 
 On August 22 , 2007 , the Senators unveiled a set of new jerseys , which have a more refined , streamlined look to them , . The team retired all three previous jerseys and did not have a third jersey for the 2007 – 08 season . The updated look came in conjunction with the launch of the new Rbk EDGE jerseys by Reebok , adopted League @-@ wide for the 2007 – 08 season . 
 At the same time , the team updated its logos , designed by local firm <unk> Communications . The new primary logo is an update of the old secondary logo , which according to team owner Eugene Melnyk , " represents strength and determination . " The logo was modified in several ways , updating the facial features , removing facial colouring , reducing size of the gold semicircle and updating the cape of the warrior . The new secondary logo is an update of the old primary logo . Only the primary logo will appear on the jerseys , as the secondary logo will be on Sens ' merchandise . The new shoulder patch ' O ' logo replaces the winged ' S ' shoulder patch with the jersey logo of the original Ottawa Senators club . 
 = = = 2008 and 2011 third jerseys = = = 
 On November 22 , 2008 , the Senators unveiled a new third jersey in a game versus the New York Rangers . Marketed with the slogan ' Back in Black ' in reference to the black " away " jerseys the team wore during its first several seasons , the jersey is primarily black , while the team 's other traditional colors of white and red are also integrated . The Senators ' primary " centurion figure " logo moves to the shoulders . The front features the word ' <unk> ' in white with red and gold trim , as a new primary logo . The ' <unk> ' third jersey was retired in 2011 . 
 On January 20 , 2011 , the Ottawa Sun reported that the Senators organization was studying designs for a new third jersey to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the current franchise . The Senators announced to season ticket holders on March 2 , 2011 , that the new third jersey will be a ' heritage design ' based on the early @-@ era Senators jersey . The new third jersey was to be unveiled officially on October 1 , 2011 , however was mistakenly leaked after being discovered in a souvenir store at First Niagara Center . The jersey will be a ' barber @-@ pole ' design with a large ' O ' on the front , and shield @-@ shaped badges on each shoulder . One shoulder badge has the words " Ottawa Senators " , the other has the words " <unk> d <unk> " . 
 Mostly black , the third jersey incorporates horizontal striping intended to be reminiscent of the original Senators ' ' barber @-@ pole ' designs , and the large letter O used in Ottawa jersey designs going back to the 1890s . The new jersey , while an entirely new creation , most resembles the look of the 1926 – 27 Senators , when the franchise won its last Stanley Cup . Shield @-@ type patches were added to the shoulders . The design of the shield @-@ type patches was intended to be similar to the shield patches that the original Senators added to their jerseys after each Stanley Cup championship win . The patches spell the team name , one in English , and one in French . Jacob <unk> , a local Gatineau , Quebec fan had posted a similar design on the internet since 2009 . The Senators worked with <unk> to develop the jersey design in time for the 20th anniversary season .

 A special edition jersey was used for the 2014 Heritage Classic against the Vancouver Canucks on March 2 , 2014 . The jersey shares virtually the same characteristics as their current third jersey , albeit reversed so that cream is the primary color . 
 = Eutharic = 
 Eutharic <unk> ( Latin : Flavius <unk> <unk> ) was an Ostrogothic prince from Iberia ( modern @-@ day Spain ) who , during the early 6th century , served as Roman Consul and " son in arms " ( filius per arma ) alongside the Byzantine emperor Justin I. He was the son @-@ in @-@ law and presumptive heir of the Ostrogoth king Theoderic the Great but died in AD 522 at the age of 42 before he could inherit Theoderic 's title . Theoderic claimed that Eutharic was a descendant of the Gothic royal house of Amali and it was intended that his marriage to Theoderic 's daughter Amalasuintha would unite the Gothic kingdoms , establish Theoderic 's dynasty and further strengthen the Gothic hold over Italy . 
 During his year of consulship in 519 relations with the East Roman Empire flourished and the Acacian schism between the Eastern and Western Christian churches was ended . Whilst Eutharic was nominally a statesman , politician and soldier of the Roman Empire , he was also an Arian , whose views clashed with the Catholic majority ; as consul enforcing Theoderic 's tolerant policy towards the Jewish people , he incurred resentment from the local Catholics , whose traditions were less than tolerant . Following disturbances in Ravenna , where Catholics burnt down a number of synagogues , Eutharic 's siding with the Jewish people of Ravenna was reported with resentment in a fragmentary contemporary chronicle . 
 Some time after the death of Eutharic , his son Athalaric briefly held the Ostrogothic throne but died at the age of 18 . After Athalaric 's death , Eutharic 's widow moved to Constantinople where further attempts at establishing a dynasty failed . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Eutharic was born around AD 480 to a noble <unk> family of the Amali line . Eutharic 's ancestry has been traced back through his father <unk> , son of <unk> , son of <unk> , son of <unk> , son of <unk> , son of <unk> . Eutharic grew up in Iberia ( modern @-@ day Spain ) where he had a reputation for being " a young man strong in wisdom and valor and health of body " . He was later to become the " son in arms " ( filius per arma ) to the Byzantine emperor Justin I , a role which indicated a part of his early life may have been spent as a soldier . 
 Eutharic 's status in both the Gothic and Roman world was elevated by the attentions of Theoderic the Great who he was related to distantly through their mutual connection with Hermanric . Hermanric was an Ostrogoth chief who ruled much of the territory north of the Black Sea . Eutharic was descended through five generations from Hermanric , whilst Theoderic was a descendant of Hermanric 's older brother <unk> . 
 By the late 5th century Theoderic was king of the Ostrogoths , ruling from Ravenna in Italy and a close ally of the Roman Emperor Zeno . Following the death of a rival , Theodoric Strabo , Theoderic the Great received the titles of patricius and magister militum from Zeno and in 484 he was appointed consul . Though there was tension between Theoderic and Zeno 's successor Anastasius I , the emperor who followed Anastasius , Justin I , sought reconciliation with Theoderic whose influence in the Gothic world would make him a powerful ally . Having worked throughout his life to establish a kingdom and strengthen relations with both the church and Rome , Theoderic was keen to establish a dynasty . His marriage to <unk> however had produced only a daughter , Amalasuintha . Therefore , to achieve his ambitions Theoderic would have to ensure he chose a son @-@ in @-@ law with an ancestry equal in strength to his own . His investigations into the Gothic royal lines , which were by this time widely distributed across Europe , led him to Iberia . Here he discovered Eutharic , the last heir of a related branch of the Amali , who had recently assumed the regency of Spain . 
 More recent studies however suggest that Eutharic 's Amali ancestry may have been a deliberate invention on the part of Theoderic to aid his ambitions of establishing dynastic credibility . According to Gesta <unk> Eutharic belonged to the Gothic house of Alan rather than the house of Amal . Whilst Jordanes , in his history of the Goths , does make reference to Eutharic 's <unk> et virtus , or pride and valour , this too may have been a fabrication on the part of Theoderic . Those qualities were recognised as requirements of Gothic ethnographic ideology , expressed in their code of <unk> . It would have been highly beneficial for Theoderic 's chosen son @-@ in @-@ law to possess them . 
 = = At the court of Theoderic = = 
 In AD 515 Eutharic answered a summons by Theoderic the Great and moved to the Ostrogothic court at Ravenna in Italy . Here he was given in marriage Amalasuintha , the daughter of the king . It was Theoderic 's intention that this union would create a long @-@ lasting dynastic connection between the previously sundered Ostrogoths and Visigoths . Theoderic also named Eutharic his presumptive heir . 
 Whilst in Italy , Eutharic played an important political role within Theoderic 's kingdom . With a court background he had the ability to serve in government and he was respected by the Romans , who admired his liberality and magnificence . Catholic writers of the time however indicate that , whilst his father @-@ in @-@ law was renowned for policies of toleration , Eutharic acted more like a " bigoted Arian " . 
 = = Consulship = = 
 In 498 , as the Empire 's nominal vice @-@ regent in Italy , Theoderic had been granted the right to nominate the Western candidate for each year 's consular pair . He was however bounded by a restriction : to select only a Roman citizen for the position . To advance Eutharic 's standing in the world Theoderic wished him to be made consul for the year 519 . To get around the restriction imposed on his nominations , and as a favour to Theoderic , Justin himself nominated Eutharic . 
 The nomination was successful , and in January 519 Eutharic took up the position of Western Consul . By granting him Roman citizenship , accepting him as co @-@ consul and calling him a " son in arms " , Emperor Justin I sought to restore ties with Theoderic , strained during the reign of Anastasius I <unk> . He showed further favour to Eutharic by conceding the senior consulship to him . It is reported that at the celebrations to mark the assumption there were , " magnificent shows of wild beasts procured from Africa " and that a visiting diplomat , the patricius Symmachus , sent by the eastern Imperial court to Italy was , " amazed at the riches given to the Goths and the Romans " . 
 During this period Eutharic was eulogised by Cassiodorus in the Senate . In it he compared Eutharic to great consuls of the past . The short Chronicle , which Cassiodorus wrote to congratulate Eutharic on his consulship , is noted for focusing on Eutharic 's accession to a position of high civilian honour , rather than any military victories , as had been more common for past Gothic nobility . Eutharic 's time as consul is portrayed largely as a time of prosperity for the western Roman empire with the code of <unk> being promoted . In March 519 , the Acacian schism which had separated the Eastern and Western Christian churches for the previous 35 years was ended and the churches reconciled . In addition to the prosperity felt by the peoples of the Roman empire , Eutharic 's year of consulship has also been described as seeming like " [ a year ] of bright promise for the Ostrogothic kingdom " . 
 The contemporary Catholic chronicle of the Anonymus Valesianus portrays Eutharic in a negative light , connecting him with taking the Jews ' side in anti @-@ Jewish disturbances in Ravenna over the Jewish congregation 's rights to their synagogue ; the disagreement prompted a conflict between the Arians and Catholics as the Arian Eutharic chose to side with the Jewish people . It is thought that the outrage expressed by the Catholics at this action was in proportion to Eutharic 's being a symbol of the recent reconciliation between the Eastern and Western Churches brought about under the direction of Theoderic . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 Eutharic died in 522 at the age of 42 , less than three years after his consulship . His death caused problems for Theoderic who never succeeded in his desire to establish a strong Gothic dynasty . Though Eutharic and Amalasuintha had a son , Athalaric born in 516 , and a daughter , Matasuntha , the dynasty was never established convincingly . Theoderic named Athalaric as his heir in 526 , and Athalaric 's mother Amalasuintha acted as regent for her son following Theoderic 's death that year . Athalaric died in October 534 at the age of 18 . To maintain her power , Amalasuintha brought her cousin , and a nephew of Theoderic , named Theodahad to the throne . Though he was made to swear fealty to Amalasuintha , Theodahad felt insecure and in December 534 had her imprisoned on an island in Lake <unk> where she was eventually murdered on 30 April 535 . 
 = Lisa Simpson = 
 Lisa Marie Simpson is a fictional character in the animated television series The Simpsons . She is the middle child and most intelligent of the Simpson family . Voiced by Yeardley Smith , Lisa first appeared on television in The Tracey Ullman Show short " Good Night " on April 19 , 1987 . Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed her while waiting to meet James L. Brooks . Groening had been invited to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic Life in Hell , but instead decided to create a new set of characters . He named the elder Simpson daughter after his younger sister Lisa Groening . After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for three years , the Simpson family were moved to their own series on Fox , which debuted on December 17 , 1989 . 
 Intelligent , passionate , and the moral centre of the family , Lisa Simpson , at eight years old , is the second child of Homer and Marge , younger sister of Bart , and older sister of Maggie . Lisa 's high intellect and liberal political stance creates a barrier between her and other children her age , therefore she is a bit of a loner and social outcast . Lisa is a vegetarian , a strong environmentalist , a feminist , and a Buddhist . Lisa enjoys many hobbies , including reading and playing the baritone saxophone . Lisa 's character develops many times over the course of the show , she becomes a vegetarian in season 7 and converts to Buddhism in season 13 . Lisa advocates for a variety of political causes and is a strong liberal and stands with the Tibetan independence movement . She has appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons – including video games , The Simpsons Movie , The Simpsons Ride , commercials and comic books – and inspired a line of merchandise . 
 Yeardley Smith originally tried out for the role of Bart , while Nancy Cartwright ( who was later cast as the voice for Bart ) tried out for Lisa . Producers considered Smith 's voice too high for a boy , so she was given the role of Lisa . In the Tracey Ullman Show shorts , Lisa was something of a " female Bart " who mirrored her brother 's mischief , but as the series progressed she became a more sophisticated and intellectual character . Because of her unusual pointed hair style , many animators consider Lisa the most difficult Simpsons character to draw . 
 Lisa is one of the most enduring characters on the series . TV Guide ranked her 11th ( tied with Bart ) on their list of the " Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time " . Her environmentalism has been especially well received ; several episodes featuring her have won Genesis and Environmental Media Awards , including a special " Board of Directors Ongoing Commitment Award " in 2001 . People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals included Lisa on their list of the " Most Animal @-@ Friendly TV Characters of All Time " . Yeardley Smith won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice @-@ Over Performance in 1992 , and in 2000 , Lisa and her family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame . 
 = = Role in The Simpsons = = 
 The Simpsons uses a floating timeline in which the characters do not physically age ; as such , Lisa is always depicted as 7 – 8 years old . The show itself is perpetually set in the year of broadcast ( except for occasional flashbacks and flashforwards ) . In several episodes , events have been linked to specific time periods , although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes . Lisa 's year of birth is given in " Lisa 's First Word " ( season 4 , 1992 ) as 1984 , during the Summer Olympics . The episode " That ' 90s Show " ( season 19 , 2008 ) , however , contradicts much of the established backstory ; for example , it presents Homer and Marge as being childless in the late 1990s . Lisa is a lover of music , especially jazz . She enjoys playing the saxophone and became friends with jazz musician Bleeding Gums Murphy , whom she regards as an idol . Murphy helps pull Lisa out of her depression in " Moaning Lisa " ( season 1 , 1990 ) . She is later deeply saddened by Murphy 's death in " ' Round Springfield " ( season 6 , 1995 ) . 
 Lisa has been friendly with several boys , including Ralph Wiggum in " I Love Lisa " ( season 4 , 1993 ) , Nelson Muntz in " Lisa 's Date with Density " ( season 8 , 1996 ) and Colin in The Simpsons Movie ( 2007 ) . Bart 's best friend Milhouse Van Houten has a crush on her , but despite dropping unsubtle hints about his feelings , he has been unsuccessful in winning her affection . 
 Lisa is the second most intellectual member of the Simpson family ( IQ 156 ) , and many episodes of the series focus on her fighting for various causes . Lisa is often the focus of episodes with " a real moral or philosophical point " , which according to former writer David S. Cohen is because " you really buy her as caring about it . " Lisa 's political convictions are generally liberal and she often contests other 's views . She is a vegetarian , feminist , environmentalist and a supporter of gay rights , and the Free Tibet movement . In a special Christmas message for the UK in 2004 Lisa showed her support for Cornish nationalism , even speaking the Cornish language to get her message across . While supportive of the general ideals of the Christian church in which she was raised , Lisa became a practicing Buddhist in the episode " She of Little Faith " ( season 13 , 2001 ) after she learned about the Noble Eightfold Path .

 Matt Groening first conceived Lisa and the rest of the Simpson family in 1986 in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks 's office . Groening had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show and had intended to present an adaptation of his Life in Hell comic strip . When he realized that animating Life in Hell would require him to rescind publication rights , Groening went in another direction , hurriedly sketching his version of a dysfunctional family , named after members of his own family . Lisa was named after Groening 's younger sister , but little else was based on her . In The Tracey Ullman Show shorts , Lisa displayed little of the intelligence for which she later became known . She was more of a " female Bart " and was originally described as simply the " middle child " , without much personality . 
 Lisa made her debut with the rest of the Simpson family on April 19 , 1987 in The Tracey Ullman Show short " Good Night " . In 1989 , the shorts were adapted into The Simpsons , a half @-@ hour series on the Fox Broadcasting Company . Lisa and the Simpson family remained the main characters on this new show . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 The entire Simpson family was designed to be easily recognized in silhouette . The family was crudely drawn , because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators , assuming they would clean them up ; instead , they just traced over his drawings . Lisa 's physical features are generally unique . In some early episodes , minor background characters occasionally had a similar hairline . However , in the later seasons , no character other than Maggie shares her hairline . While designing Lisa , Groening " couldn 't be bothered to even think about girls ' hair styles " . At the time , Groening was primarily drawing in black and white ; when designing Lisa and Maggie , he " just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style , not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color " . 
 To draw Lisa 's head and hair , most of the show 's animators use what they call the " three @-@ three @-@ two arrangement " . It begins with a circle , with two curving lines ( one vertical , one horizontal ) intersecting in the middle to indicate her eyeline . The vertical line continues outside of the circle to create one hair point , with two more added towards the back of her head . Three more points are then added in front ( in the direction Lisa is facing ) , with two more behind it . Several Simpsons animators , including Pete Michels and David Silverman , consider Lisa the most difficult Simpsons character to draw . Silverman explains that " her head is so abstract " due to her hairstyle . 
 = = = Voice = = = 
 While the roles of Homer and Marge were given to Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner because they were already a part of the Tracey Ullman Show cast , the producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa . Nancy Cartwright intended to audition for the role of Lisa , but disliked the character 's bland description — Lisa was described simply as the " middle child " — and read for the role of Bart instead . Casting director Bonita Pietila brought Yeardley Smith in for an audition after seeing her performing in the play Living on Salvation Street . Smith was hesitant to audition for an animated series , but her agent had persuaded her to give it a try . Smith originally auditioned for the role of Bart but Pietila believed her voice was too high . Smith later recalled : " I always sounded too much like a girl , I read two lines as Bart and they said , ' Thanks for coming ! ' " Pietila offered Smith the role of Lisa instead . 
 Smith and the show 's writers worked to give Lisa a more defined personality , and she has developed greatly during the series . In her 2000 memoir My Life as a 10 @-@ Year @-@ Old Boy , Cartwright wrote : " with the brilliant wit of the writers and the wry , in @-@ your @-@ eye , honest @-@ to @-@ a @-@ fault interpretation , Yeardley Smith has made Lisa a bright light of leadership , full of compassion and competence beyond her years . Lisa Simpson is the kind of child we not only want our children to be , but also the kind of child we want all children to be . But , at the time , on The Tracey Ullman Show , she was just an animated eight @-@ year @-@ old kid who had no personality . " 
 Lisa is the only regular character voiced by Smith , who raises the pitch of her voice slightly for the role . In some earlier episodes she provided some of Maggie 's squeaks and occasional speaking parts , and has voiced other characters on very rare occasions . Usually they are derivative of Lisa , such as Lisa Bella in " Last Tap Dance in Springfield " ( season 11 , 2000 ) and Lisa , Jr. in " Missionary : Impossible " . ( season 11 , 2000 ) 
 Despite the fame of Lisa Simpson , Smith is rarely recognized in public , as it is Lisa who appears on screen . However , Smith does not mind . She said , " it 's wonderful to be in the midst of all this hype about the show , and people enjoying the show so much , and to be totally a fly on the wall ; people never recognise me solely from my voice . " In a 2009 interview with The Guardian she commented that " It 's the best job ever . I have nothing but gratitude for the amount of freedom The Simpsons has bought me in my life . " Although Smith received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice @-@ Over Performance in 1992 , she considers it unimportant , saying " there 's part of me that feels it wasn 't even a real Emmy . " The award is a Creative Arts prize not awarded during the primetime telecast and , at the time , a juried award without nominations . Still , Smith considers her work on the show a success . " If I had to be associated with one character in fiction , " she said , " I will always be thrilled that it was Lisa Simpson . " Matt Groening has described Smith as being very similar to Lisa : " Yeardley has strong moral views about her character . There are lines that are written for Lisa that Yeardley reads and says , ' No , I wouldn 't say that . ' " Former Simpsons writer Jay Kogen praised her performance on the show , particularly in the episode " Lisa 's Substitute " , as able " to move past comedy to something really strong and serious and dramatic . "

 In The Tracey Ullman Show shorts , Lisa was something of a " female Bart " : equally mischievous but lacking unique traits . As the series progressed , Lisa began to develop into a more intelligent and more emotional character . She demonstrates her intellect in the 1990 episode " Krusty Gets Busted " ( season one ) , by helping Bart reveal Sideshow Bob 's plot to frame Krusty the Clown for armed robbery . Many episodes focusing on Lisa have an emotional nature , such as " Moaning Lisa " ( season one , 1990 ) . The idea for the episode was pitched by James L. Brooks , who wanted to do an emotional episode involving Lisa 's sadness , to complement the many " jokey episodes " in the first season . 
 In the seventh @-@ season episode " Lisa the Vegetarian " ( 1995 ) , Lisa permanently becomes a vegetarian , distinguishing her as one of the first primetime television characters to make such a choice . The episode was written by David S. Cohen ( in his first solo writing credit ) who jotted down the idea one day while eating lunch . Then @-@ executive producer David Mirkin , who had recently become a vegetarian , quickly approved the idea . Several of Lisa 's experiences in the episode are based on Mirkin 's own experiences . The episode guest stars musician Paul McCartney , a committed vegetarian and animal rights activist . McCartney 's condition for appearing was that Lisa would remain a vegetarian for the rest of the series and would not revert the next week ( as is common on situation comedies ) . The trait stayed and is one of the few permanent character changes made in the show . In the season 13 episode " She of Little Faith " ( 2001 ) , Lisa underwent another permanent character change when she converted to Buddhism . 
 Lisa plays the baritone saxophone , and some episodes use that as a plot device . According to Matt Groening , the baritone saxophone was chosen because he found the thought of an eight @-@ year @-@ old girl playing it amusing . He added , " But she doesn 't always play a baritone sax because the animators don 't know what it looks like , so it changes shape and color from show to show . " One of the hallmarks of the show 's opening sequence is a brief solo Lisa plays on her saxophone after being thrown out of music class . The Simpsons composer Alf Clausen said that the session musicians who perform her solos do not try to play at the second grade level and instead " think of Lisa as a really good player . " 
 = = = Personality = = = 
 Lisa is extremely intelligent and sees herself as a misfit within the Simpson family and other children due to her knowledge . She shows characteristics rarely seen in Springfield , including spirituality and commitment to peaceful ways . Lisa 's knowledge covers a wide range of subjects , including physics , history , algebra , calculus , art , linguistics , geography , political science , economics and even sports . She is notably more concerned with world affairs than her life in Springfield , with her rebellion against social norms usually depicted as constructive and heroic , yet Lisa can be self @-@ righteous at times . In " Lisa the Vegetarian " , an increasing sense of moral righteousness leads her to disrupt her father 's roast @-@ pig barbecue , an act for which she later apologizes . Episodes often take shots at Lisa 's idealism . In " Bart Star " , ( season nine , 1997 ) Lisa , departs from her typically more genuine nature and apparently looking for a new cause to crusade over , defiantly declares that she , a girl , would like to join the football team . In the 1990s , it was considered unthinkable to allow a girl to play football . However , when coach Ned Flanders reveals that several girls already play for the team , she hesitates and claims football is " not really [ her ] thing " . She then expresses distaste about a ball made of pig 's skin , but one of the girls informs her that their footballs are synthetic and that proceeds are donated to Amnesty International . Visibly upset , Lisa runs off . 
 Lisa is said to have an IQ of 159 , and in " They Saved Lisa 's Brain " ( season ten , 1999 ) she becomes a member of the Springfield chapter of Mensa . When unable to attend school due to a teachers ' strike in " The PTA Disbands " , ( season six , 1995 ) she suffers withdrawal symptoms because of the sudden lack of praise . She even demands that her mother grade her for no obvious reason . In Planet Simpson , Chris Turner writes that these traits make Lisa more realistic because " No character can aspire to realism without a few all @-@ too @-@ human flaws . " 
 Although she is gifted , Lisa experiences typical childhood issues , sometimes requiring adult intervention . For example , in " Lost Our Lisa " ( season nine , 1998 ) , she tricks Homer into allowing her to ride the bus alone , only to become hopelessly lost and in need of aid from her father . Chris Turner writes in Planet Simpson that incidents like this illustrate that " Even when Lisa 's lecturing like a college professor or mounting yet another protest , she never becomes a full @-@ grown adult trapped in a kid 's body . " In The Simpsons and Philosophy : The D 'oh ! of Homer , Aeon J. Skoble states that although Lisa is an intellectual , she is still portrayed as a character who enjoys normal childhood and girl activities , plays with Malibu Stacy dolls , loves ponies , obsesses over teenage heartthrobs such as Corey , and watches The Itchy and Scratchy Show along with Bart. He writes , " One might argue that this is typical childhood behavior , but since in so many cases Lisa is presented not simply as a prodigy but as preternaturally wise , the fondness for Itchy and Scratchy and Corey seem to be highlighted , taking on greater significance . Lisa is portrayed as the avatar of logic and wisdom , but then she also worships Corey so she 's ' no better [ than the rest of us ] ' . " 
 Lisa occasionally worries that her family 's dull habits will rub off on her , such as in " Lisa the Simpson " ( season nine , 1998 ) she worries that the " Simpson gene " will make her a <unk> later finding out the gene only goes through the male side . She is often embarrassed and disapproving of her eccentric family : of her father 's poor parenting skills and buffoonish personality ; her mother 's stereotypical image and social ineptitude ; and her brother 's delinquent and low @-@ brow nature . She is also concerned that Maggie may grow up to be like the rest of the family and tries to teach her complex ideas . Chris Turner writes in Planet Simpson that " Lisa embarks on quests to find solace for her yearning spirit [ ... ] but the most reliable source of truth she finds is the one she always believed in : her family . It is from the other Simpsons that Lisa draws stability , meaning , contentment . " Her loyalty to her family is most clearly seen in the flashforward " Lisa 's Wedding " ( season six , 1995 ) , in which she must reconcile her love for them with the distaste of her cultured fiancé . In the episode " Mother Simpson " ( season seven , 1995 ) she meets her paternal grandmother Mona Simpson for the first time . Mona is also well @-@ read and articulate , and the writers used the character as a way to explain the origins of Lisa 's intelligence . 
 Lisa has been romantically linked to a number of other characters on the show , including Nelson Muntz , which voice actor Yeardley Smith says would make a good match for Lisa .

 Lisa has been a popular character since the show 's inception . She was listed at number 11 ( tied with Bart ) in TV Guide 's " Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time . " She appeared in Comcast 's list of TV 's Most Intriguing Characters and was also included in AfterEllen.com 's Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters . On a less positive note , she was ranked third in AskMen 's top 10 of the most irritating ' 90s cartoon characters . Yeardley Smith has won several awards for voicing Lisa , including a Primetime Emmy Award for " Outstanding Voice @-@ Over Performance " in 1992 for " Lisa the Greek " . Various episodes in which Lisa stars have won Emmy Awards for Outstanding Animated Program , including " Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment " in 1991 , " Lisa 's Wedding " in 1995 and " HOMR " in 2001 . In 2000 , Lisa and the rest of the Simpson family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard . 
 Lisa 's environmentalism has been especially well received . In 2001 , Lisa received a special " Board of Directors Ongoing Commitment Award " at the Environmental Media Awards . " Lisa the Vegetarian " won both an Environmental Media Award for " Best Television Episodic Comedy " and a Genesis Award for " Best Television Comedy Series , Ongoing Commitment " . Several other episodes that feature Lisa speaking out in favor of animal rights have won Genesis Awards , including " Whacking Day " in 1994 , " Bart Gets an Elephant " in 1995 , " Million Dollar Abie " in 2007 and " Apocalypse Cow " in 2009 .

 Jonathan Gray , author of the book Watching The Simpsons , feels that Lisa " is probably the best and certainly longest @-@ running feminist character that television has had . She 's the heart of the show and she quite often questions the gender politics . " Christopher Borrelli of The Toledo Blade wrote , " Has there ever been a female TV character as complex , intelligent , and , ahem , as emotionally well @-@ drawn as Lisa Simpson ? Meet her once and she comes off priggish and one @-@ note – a know @-@ it @-@ all . Get to know her and Lisa is as well @-@ rounded as anyone you may ever meet in the real world . " 
 According to PETA , Lisa was one of the first vegetarian characters on primetime television . In 2004 the organization included Lisa on its list of the " Most Animal @-@ Friendly TV Characters of All Time " . In 2008 , environmentalist website The Daily Green honored Lisa 's role in The Simpsons Movie with one of its inaugural " Heart of Green " awards , which " recognize those who have helped green go mainstream . " They wrote " young Lisa Simpson has inspired a generation to wear their hearts on their sleeves and get educated , and involved , about global issues , from justice to feminism and the environment . " Japanese broadcasters reversed viewer dislike of the series by focusing marketing of the show on Lisa . Lisa 's well @-@ intended but ill @-@ fated struggles to be a voice of reason and a force of good in her family and community struck a chord with Japanese audiences . Mario D 'Amato , a specialist in Buddhist studies at Rollins College in Florida , described Lisa as " open @-@ minded , reflective , ethical , and interested in improving herself in various ways , while still preserving a childlike sense of innocence . These are all excellent qualities , ones which are espoused by many Buddhist traditions . " 
 Lisa and the rest of the Simpsons have had a significant influence on English @-@ language idioms . The dismissive term " Meh " , used by Lisa and popularized by the show , entered the Collins English Dictionary in 2008 . In 1996 , The New York Times published an article saying that Lisa was inspiring children , especially young girls , to learn to play the saxophone .

Lisa has appeared in commercials for Burger King , C.C. Lemon , Church 's Chicken , Domino 's Pizza , Kentucky Fried Chicken , Ramada Inn , Ritz Crackers , Subway and Butterfinger . 
 On April 9 , 2009 , the United States Postal Service unveiled a series of five 44 cent stamps featuring Lisa and the four other members of the nuclear Simpson family . They are the first characters from a television series to receive this recognition while still in production . The stamps , designed by Matt Groening , went on sale in May 2009 . 
 Lisa has also appeared in other media relating to The Simpsons . She has appeared in each Simpsons video game , including The Simpsons Game , released in 2007 . In addition to the television series , Lisa regularly appears in issues of Simpsons Comics , first published on November 29 , 1993 and published monthly . The comics focus on the sweeter , more naive incarnation from the early seasons . Lisa also plays a role in The Simpsons Ride , launched in 2008 at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood . 
 = Almost There ( album ) = 
 Almost There is the first major @-@ label studio album by American Christian rock band MercyMe . Produced by Pete Kipley , the album was released on August 14 , 2001 by INO Records . After releasing six independent records , the band decided to pursue a record contract due to the difficulty of selling , booking , and managing for themselves . The band signed with the newly formed INO Records , and were assigned to work with Kipley , who had not produced a major project before . Four of the songs on the album had previously appeared on the band 's independent records ; the rest were newly recorded songs . The album is a worship and pop rock album , and adopts a more radio @-@ friendly sound than the band 's independent albums . 
 Almost There received critical acclaim from music critics , who praised the album 's songwriting ; " I Can Only Imagine " received particular complements . Critics were more divided on the album 's sound . Some felt the album was " innovative " or " fresh " , while others felt it was middle – of – the – road or derivative . " Bless Me Indeed ( Jabez 's Song ) " was released as the album 's lead single ; however , it underperformed on the charts . The album 's second single , " I Can Only Imagine " , proved to be successful , peaking at number one on the Radio & Records Christian AC chart in 2002 . Its success contributed to the album reaching the top of the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart . After the song crossed over to mainstream radio in 2003 , the album peaked at number 39 on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Billboard Christian Albums chart . Almost There has been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and has sold over 2 @.@ 2 million copies in the United States . Billboard ranked it as the fourth best @-@ selling Christian album of the 2000s in the United States , and it was listed by CCM Magazine in its 25th anniversary edition as one of ' 100 Albums You Need to Own ' .

 MercyMe was formed in 1994 by vocalist Bart Millard , guitarist Mike Scheuchzer , and keyboardist Jim Bryson . The band later brought on drummer Robby Shaffer and bassist Nathan Cochran . In October 1999 , the band released their fifth independent album , The Worship Project . The album proved successful , selling over 60 @,@ 000 copies within a year , but the difficulty of selling albums directly , in addition to having to book and manage for themselves , led the band to pursue a contract with a record label . Millard was directed by a friend to contact Jeff Moseley , who had connections in the Christian music industry , for advice . After being contacted by Millard , Moseley expressed interest in the band , and within a week MercyMe was officially signed to INO Records , a new record label Moseley was helming . Moseley introduced the band to Pete Kipley , who would produce the album . Although Kipley had been involved on some minor projects , Almost There was his first major project . 
 Four of the songs on Almost There ( " Call to Worship " , " Cannot Say Enough " , " I Can Only Imagine " , and " In You " ) had previously appeared on the band 's independent records . All of the other songs on the album were new songs which had not been recorded before . All of the songs of the album were written by Millard or the band except " I Worship You " , which was written by Kipley and Reggie Hamm . The band included the song after Kipley brought it to them ; although the band wanted to write their own material , they liked the song so much that they put it as the first song on the album . " Bless Me Indeed ( Jabez 's Song ) " was written at the request of the label , who wanted to capitalize off of the success of the popular Bruce Wilkinson book The Prayer of Jabez . The band did not want to record the song , but eventually acquiesced . MercyMe pushed the label to include " House of God " , an upbeat rock song , since they felt that they had been pushed a little too far towards the adult contemporary genre . 
 Almost There was recorded at Ivy Park , The Indigo Room , Paradise Sound , and IBC Studios . Kipley produced and programmed the record , while Skye McCaskey and Julian Kindred engineered the album . Salvo mixed all the songs on the album at Cool Springs Studio with the exception of " In You " , which was mixed by Shane Wilson . Strings were recorded by the Paltrow Performance Group .

 Almost There has been described by critics as being a worship and pop rock album . The album was noted as being stylistically similar to contemporary Christian bands like FFH . In contrast to the band 's independent records , which had an " organic " feel , Almost There adopts a more radio @-@ friendly musical style , although the rock style of the band 's independent albums does occasionally resurface . Similarities were noted between the " guitar nuances " of Scheuchzer and U2 's guitarist The Edge . 
 The album 's first song , " I Worship You " was described as " falling somewhere between adult contemporary and rock " , and utilizes acoustic guitars and synthesizers . " Here Am I " relates the story of people who are not being reached by Christians , and " challenges the listener to go out into the world and stand up for their King " . " On My Way to You " is a worship song , requesting " wisdom , purity , and humility in our pursuit of holiness " . " How Great is Your Love " incorporates both string and electronic instruments ; Millard 's vocals in the song utilize " effect – laden delays " . " I Can Only Imagine " is a ballad , opening with just piano before building to include drums and guitar . Lyrically , it asks what it will be like in Heaven , standing before God . 
 " Bless Me Indeed ( Jabez 's Song ) " is one of the fastest songs on the album . Lyrically , the song parallels the prayer of the Biblical character Jabez in 1 Chronicles 4 : 10 , asking God for blessing and protection from evil . " Cannot Say Enough " was described as " ambient " and compared to Third Day 's " Your Love Oh Lord " . " House of God " was noted as being one of the album 's more rock – oriented songs . The song utilizes " driving " guitars and a " nasty " guitar riff , and invites the listener to enter the house of god . " Call to Worship " is a mid – tempo song led by guitar ; the song was compared to the work of The Cure . The final two songs on the album , " All Fall Down " and " In You " , are slower – paced songs , with the latter being led by piano and strings .

 Almost There was released in the United States on August 14 , 2001 . " Bless Me Indeed ( Jabez 's Song ) " was released as the album 's lead single . The label aimed to give the band a wider appeal by capitalizing on the success of the popular book The Prayer of Jabez . The song debuted on the Radio & Records Christian AC chart on August 31 , 2001 at number 29 , and spent four weeks on the chart , peaking at number 27 . The poor chart performance of the song led to album sales that were lower than anticipated . The album debuted at number 12 on the Billboard Christian Albums chart on September 1 , 2001 , and a week later entered the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart , which ranks the top albums from artists who have not had an album enter the top 100 on the Billboard 200 chart , at number 39 . 
 " I Can Only Imagine " was released as the album 's second single . The song debuted on the Christian AC chart on November 2 , 2001 ; it reached the number one position on February 22 , 2002 and spent two weeks at the top spot .

 Almost There received critical acclaim from music critics . Critics praised the album 's lyrical content , with particular complaint being given to " I Can Only Imagine " . Steve Losey of Allmusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars , praising it as " a disc that holds power " and being an " exception " rather than a " norm " in comparison to most other praise and worship releases . Losey also noted the " guitar nuances " of Scheuchzer as being similar to U2 's The Edge , and praised Bryson as " [ placing ] intense but subtle keyboard traces within the context of each tune " . Adam Woodroof of CCM Magazine gave it 3 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars . While Woodroof felt the album did not deliver an innovative sound , he complemented it as offering " a breath of fresh air — and a sincerity sure to hold other artists wishing to dive into the genre accountable In a review for Charisma , Margaret <unk> praised the album for incorporating songs from their previous independent records . <unk> said that " MercyMe was stripped of much of its wonderful , organic , out – of – the box sound but given new life for radio airplay " , and that " Overall , MercyMe is a band that deserves to be heard " . Kevin McNeese of New Release Today gave the album five out of five stars , calling it " another defining album " in praise and worship music . McNeese particularly praised " I Can Only Imagine " , calling it the album 's highlight , but noted the other songs on the album were " penned with the same passion " . 
 The J Man of Crosswalk.com gave Almost There a B , and said that " In the ever – growing genre of modern worship , MercyMe steps up to the plate and drives a home run over the fence " . He praised the album as having a " fresh sound " , but described much of the album was " somewhat low – key " . Kevin Chamberlain of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album 4 out of 5 stars . Chamberlain praised the album as being " lyrically one of the best albums out there " and said that " Every song is based on some sort of Scripture or Spiritual truth seldom found in some Christian music " . However , Chamberlain felt the album 's sound was average , saying it sounds like " FFH or any typical Contemporary Christian artist " . 
 Other critics gave the album a more mixed response . Megumi Nakamura of Cross Rhythms gave the album 7 out of 10 stars . Nakamura praised " I Can Only Imagine " , but said that " little else on the album that matches the huge impact of that one song " . In a later review for the album 's " Platinum Edition " re – release , Allan Clare gave it an 8 out of 10 , saying the rest of the album aside from " I Can Only Imagine " was " bland " . Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today felt the album was " something of a mixed bag " and described the band 's sound was " a little too mellow to be rock , and a little too heavy to be pop ... their particular style doesn 't stray from a middle of the road sound " . Breimier described the album was not particularly good or bad , and offered a weak recommendation to fans of worship bands like By the Tree and Delirious ? . 
 In its 25th anniversary edition , CCM Magazine listed Almost There as one of ' 100 Albums You Need to Own ' . In the following year , the previous magazine , ranked " I Can Only Imagine " as the fourth @-@ greatest song in Christian music .

 = Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long = 
 " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " is a song by English musician George Harrison , released on his 1973 album Living in the Material World . It was scheduled to be issued as a single in September that year , as the follow @-@ up to " Give Me Love ( Give Me Peace on Earth ) " , but the release never took place . Music critics have traditionally viewed " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " as a highlight of the bestselling Material World album , praising its pop qualities and production , with some considering the song worthy of hit status . 
 Harrison wrote and recorded " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " during a period marked by his heightened devotion to Hindu spirituality , which coincided with marital problems with his first wife , Pattie Boyd , and the financial complications affecting his Bangladesh aid project . An upbeat love song in the tradition of early 1960s Brill Building songwriters , the composition has invited debate among commentators as to whether the lyrics are addressed to a lover such as Boyd or , like the majority of Harrison 's lyrics on Material World , to God . 
 Although produced by Harrison alone , the recording employs aspects of the Wall of Sound production synonymous with his former collaborator Phil Spector – through the use of reverb , two drummers and multiple acoustic rhythm guitar parts . Aside from Harrison , the musicians on the track are Gary Wright , Nicky Hopkins , Ringo Starr , Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner . In November 1976 , during filming for their joint appearance on Saturday Night Live , Harrison performed " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " with singer Paul Simon , but the song did not appear in the broadcast .

 As with all the new songs on his Living in the Material World album ( 1973 ) , George Harrison wrote " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " in 1971 – 72 , a period of heightened devotion to Hindu spirituality on his part . " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " is a love song , and in light of problems in Harrison 's marriage to Pattie Boyd at the time , Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley remarks : " it 's interesting to speculate as to who it was written about ... " Author Jeff Walker suggests that the song 's apparently non @-@ devotional subject matter may have resulted from Harrison and Boyd 's marital difficulties . 
 Against Harrison 's wishes , Boyd had resumed her modelling career in May 1971 , having long felt isolated by her husband 's association with the Hare Krishna movement . His Concert for Bangladesh aid project had then united the couple , according to their friend Chris O 'Dell , who recalls Harrison as " attentive and affectionate " towards Boyd while planning the concerts that summer . The project 's subsequent business and legal issues became a source of frustration for Harrison , as he spent much of 1972 negotiating with government departments for the release of the funds raised for the refugees . In February 1972 , Harrison and Boyd were injured in an automobile accident in England , after which , author Alan Clayson writes , " her recovery was impaired by George 's pounding on a drum @-@ kit that he 'd set up in the next room . " 
 In August that year , Harrison set off for a driving holiday around Europe without Boyd , a trip that Huntley describes as " the first publicly visible signs " of problems in the Harrisons ' marriage . While in Portugal , Harrison stayed with his musician friend Gary Wright , who , Huntley suggests , " play [ ed ] the diplomat " by telling the press : " He 's writing lots of new things and he seems to be having a good time ... Sometimes he takes Pattie with him , but I feel he just felt like a holiday and wanted to get away . " 
 = = Composition = = 
 In his book The Words and Music of George Harrison , Ian Inglis writes that " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " incorporates many of the elements of pop composition pioneered during the early 1960s at New York 's Brill Building , where songwriters such as Barry Mann , Carole King and Gerry Goffin began their careers . Inglis lists these " stock motifs " as " a repetitive and attractive melody " , " a stereotypical choice of language " , " the familiar topic of lost , or unrequited , love " and " the conventional form of address from a man to a woman , in the persistent use of ' baby ' " . These elements appear in the song 's chorus , where Harrison sings : " How I love you / Baby , so don 't let me wait too long . " 
 Harrison biographer Simon Leng views " pop @-@ soul music " as " the obvious root " of " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " and cites musical tension as one facet of the pop @-@ soul style that Harrison adopts . This tension is evident in the " <unk> [ d ] dissonance " during the verses , Leng adds , when Harrison moves from an F major chord to D @-@ flat major . In reference to a lyric in the verses , Clayson suggests : " Although ' Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long ' betrayed that George 's sublimation of lust [ in favour of an ascetic path ] was by no means total , its consummation was , nonetheless , ' like it came from above ' . " 
 Inglis writes that the message of " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " is " in the title " . The theme of waiting is also central to a track that Harrison wrote in 1967 while in the Beatles , " Blue Jay Way " , and a similar sentiment appears in his 1970 – 71 solo hit " My Sweet Lord " , through the line " I really want to see you , Lord , but it takes so long " . In the latter lyric , Harrison expresses his impatience to see and know God , and Harrison biographer Geoffrey Giuliano interprets " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " as a further reflection of the singer 's spiritual concerns . 
 Whereas Huntley , Inglis and Walker consider that Harrison is addressing a lover in " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " , other commentators , like Giuliano , view the lyrics as being consistent with the predominant theme of Living in the Material World – namely , Harrison 's spiritual search amid the temptations of the physical world . Of these commentators , Nicholas Schaffner and Bob Woffinden highlight " Sue Me , Sue You Blues " as the album 's only song with a non @-@ religious subject matter . 
 A Christian theologian , Dale Allison has identified a number of Harrison compositions where he finds it " impossible " to discern whether Harrison is proffering love for a woman or his deity , yet he views " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " as a secular love song . Author Chris Ingham similarly writes that , along with the Material World tracks " Who Can See It " and " That Is All " , Harrison 's expression of love in this song " seems directed as much to an earthly relationship as to any God " .

 The sessions for most of the basic tracks for Living in the Material World took place over October and November 1972 , with engineer Phil McDonald , but without Harrison 's intended co @-@ producer from All Things Must Pass ( 1970 ) and The Concert for Bangladesh ( 1971 ) , Phil Spector . According to the album credits , the location for the recording was the Beatles ' Apple Studio in London , although bassist Klaus Voormann has stated that the true venue was Harrison 's new home studio , FPSHOT , in Oxfordshire . 
 Aside from Harrison on acoustic guitars , the musicians on the basic track for " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " were Nicky Hopkins ( piano ) , Wright ( keyboards ) , Voormann ( bass ) , and Ringo Starr and Jim Keltner ( both on drums ) . The Starr – Keltner combination followed their pairing at the Concert for Bangladesh shows ; this song was one of three tracks on Material World to which Starr contributed , in between his film work on That 'll Be the Day ( 1973 ) and Son of Dracula ( 1974 ) . In addition , Pete Ham and Tom Evans of Apple group Badfinger attended some of the sessions in October , playing acoustic rhythm guitar as they had on much of All Things Must Pass . As with Ham 's playing on the 1971 @-@ recorded " Try Some , Buy Some " , however , any contribution they might have made to " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " went uncredited on the official release . 
 Following the completion of the main recording sessions , Harrison carried out overdubbing on the basic tracks through to the end of February 1973 . On " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " , the overdubs included his vocals and slide guitar part . Of the last of these , Walker comments that Harrison 's playing prior to the refrain further develops the melodic tension evident in the composition .

 Despite Spector 's absence , the song 's production incorporates aspects of his signature Wall of Sound , through the use of reverberation , multiple drummers and layers of rhythm instruments such as acoustic guitars and keyboards . Part of a sound commonly associated with Harrison during the early 1970s , these characteristics were also elements of his 1971 production of Badfinger 's " Day After Day " and Lon & Derrek Van Eaton 's " Sweet Music " . 
 Author Robert Rodriguez describes the recording as " Spector @-@ esque ( in a girl group sense ) " , Harrison having long been an admirer of Spector 's work with the Ronettes and the Crystals during the 1960s . Leng writes of " over @-@ the @-@ top tympani " as another Spector influence on " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " ' s " Motown ' orchestration ' " , while labelling the musical arrangement " English pop " . Among other later examples , Harrison would revive his version of Spector 's Wall of Sound for his 1974 single " Ding Dong , Ding Dong " and the song " If You Believe " , from his 1979 album George Harrison .

 Apple Records released Living in the Material World on 30 May 1973 in America , with " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " appearing on side one of the LP , between the ballads " The Light That Has Lighted the World " and " Who Can See It " . The album continued Harrison 's run of commercial success following the Beatles ' break @-@ up in 1970 , topping Billboard 's albums chart in the US and peaking at number 2 in Britain , behind the soundtrack to That 'll Be the Day . Amid this success , Rodriguez writes , Harrison and Boyd 's relationship " finally reached breaking point " in summer 1973 , the start of a period through to 1975 that Harrison would describe as his " naughty " years .

 " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " was scheduled to be the A @-@ side of a second single from the album , as a follow @-@ up to Harrison 's US number 1 hit " Give Me Love ( Give Me Peace on Earth ) " . The intended release date was 24 September 1973 ; an acetate of the single was created , and a US catalogue number assigned ( Apple 1866 ) . The release was cancelled at the last minute , however , for undisclosed reasons . 
 Noting the song 's " hit potential " , Leng views the cancellation as " [ o ] ne of the more anomalous features " of Harrison 's musical career . Leng has speculated that the single was withdrawn because of the similarity between " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " and " Give Me Love " . Author Andrew Grant Jackson suggests that the reason for the cancellation was due to " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " having a similar sound to " When I 'm Dead and Gone " , a 1970 hit song by McGuinness Flint . Although Harrison would not enjoy success with " Don 't Let Me Wait Too Long " as a single , Leng and Inglis observe that the song anticipated a number of radio @-@ friendly singles by ELO during the 1970s , particularly their 1976 hit " Livin ' Thing " .

In his 1977 book The Beatles Forever , Nicholas Schaffner wrote that Harrison and former bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney had " evolved into surprisingly tasteful and meticulous producers " after their long association with Beatles producer George Martin , and added of Harrison : " Surely Phil Spector never had a more attentive pupil .
