 Wurtsmith 's remains were recovered from Cold Mountain and were interred in Arlington National Cemetery on 17 September 1946 . In February 1953 , the United States Air Force named Wurtsmith Air Force Base in Oscoda , Michigan , in his honor . Special guests at the dedication ceremony included his mother Ella , his widow Irene , his nephews Paul D. Wurtsmith and Fred Wurtsmith , and George Kenney . General Thomas D. White told the crowd that the base was being named after a man who was " probably the best fighter pilot and fighter tactician in all of World War II " . In 1954 , Ella Wurtsmith was named Michigan Mother of the Year . Among the letters recommending her for the honor was one from General MacArthur .

 Edward James Zosky ( born February 10 , 1968 ) is a former professional baseball shortstop . He played all or part of five seasons in Major League Baseball , between 1991 and 2000 , for the Toronto Blue Jays , Florida Marlins , Milwaukee Brewers and Houston Astros . He also played in the Baltimore Orioles , San Francisco Giants and Pittsburgh Pirates minor league systems . 
 Zosky was a collegiate star prior to playing professionally , becoming a member of Fresno State University 's athletic Hall of Fame . He developed into a promising shortstop prospect for the Toronto Blue Jays in the early 1990s , being named their starting shortstop of the future multiple times , though injury problems and a lack of offense ended his hopes of stardom . 
 Zosky began his professional career in 1989 at the age of 21 and played for 12 seasons until the age of 32 in 2000 . He spent most of his professional career in the minor leagues , spending parts of two seasons at the rookie level , part of one season at the Single @-@ A level , two full seasons at the Double @-@ A level , parts of three seasons at the Triple @-@ A level and seven full seasons at the Triple @-@ A level . In total , he played in 1 @,@ 056 minor league games , hitting .257 with 59 home runs and 407 RBI in 3 @,@ 670 at @-@ bats . Defensively , he spent 752 games at shortstop , 147 games at third base , 139 games at second base , two games at pitcher and one game in the outfield . As a pitcher , he threw 11 ⁄ 3 innings , striking out two batters and allowing one earned run , posting a 6 @.@ 75 ERA . 
 He spent parts of five seasons at the Major League level – 1991 , 1992 , 1995 , 1999 and 2000 . He played in 44 big league games , collecting eight hits in 50 at @-@ bats for a .160 batting average . Though he never hit a home run , he did collect two triples and a double , while driving three runs in . Defensively , he played 30 games at shortstop ( starting eight of them ) , four games at third base and three games at second base . He committed two errors for a .967 fielding percentage , while turning eight double plays .

 After his graduation from high school , he attended Fresno State University , where he mostly played shortstop . He hit .292 in his first season with Fresno State University , earning second @-@ team all @-@ league honors . In May 1988 , he suffered from mononucleosis and an ankle sprain , slightly shortening his sophomore season . In addition , Zosky was selected to try out for the United States Olympic baseball team in June of his sophomore season , along with teammates Tom Goodwin and John Salles . Though he was considered the front @-@ runner for the shortstop position on the Olympic squad , he did not make the team . During his junior and final season at Fresno State University , Zosky was named Sporting News and Baseball America All @-@ Americans after posting a .370 batting average . In addition , he was named first @-@ team All Big West , along with teammates Bobby Jones , Tom Goodwin and Rich Crane .

 Zosky was drafted by Major League Baseball teams twice . Originally , he was drafted out of St. Paul High School by the New York Mets in the fifth round of the 1986 amateur draft , 128th overall . He did not sign , choosing to attend college instead . 
 He was next drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays 19th overall in the first round of the 1989 draft , out of Fresno State University . He was one of three Fresno State University alum drafted in the first round that year , the others being Steve Hosey ( 14th overall ) and Tom Goodwin ( 22nd overall ) . It was the first time since the 1979 draft that one school had three different players selected in the first round . The last school to do it was the University of Michigan . The Toronto Blue Jays gave Zosky a $ 185 @,@ 000 ( $ 353 @,@ 000 today ) signing bonus .

 The initial plan was to have Zosky begin his professional career with the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Single @-@ A Florida State League . However , citing poor performances by his current shortstops , Double @-@ A manager Barry Foote had Zosky start with the Southern League Knoxville Blue Jays . He made his professional debut on July 4 , collecting a hit and driving in the Knoxville Blue Jays lone run in his first professional game . He played 56 games at shortstop for the Knoxville Blue Jays , batting .221 with a .303 slugging percentage . 
 In 1990 , Zosky was ranked the third best prospect in the Southern League . Though he attended Major League spring training , he spent the entire season in the minor leagues , playing for the Double @-@ A Knoxville Blue Jays and hitting .271 in 115 games – tying William <unk> for the team lead in triples with seven . 
 Prior to the 1991 season , Baseball America named Zosky the 22nd best prospect in professional baseball , ahead of Jeff Bagwell ( 32nd ) , Chipper Jones ( 49th ) and Jim Thome ( 93rd ) . That season , he attended his second Major League spring training , and was in competition with Manuel Lee and Rene Gonzales for the starting shortstop position . However , after making six errors during the spring , he was deemed unready for Major League action and sent to minor league camp on April 1 . 
 He spent most of the season with the Triple @-@ A International League Syracuse Chiefs , hitting .264 with six home runs , 39 RBI and 69 runs . He led the team in both plate appearances and at bats , and , despite committing 24 errors in the field , he led league shortstops with 221 putouts , 371 assists and 88 double plays . His performance landed him a spot on the 1991 International League All @-@ Star Team , as well as a September 1 promotion to the Major Leagues . 
 = = = Major League debut = = = 
 Though Zosky spent the majority of the 1991 season with the Syracuse Chiefs , he made his Major League Baseball debut that season as well . He appeared in his first big league game on September 2 , against the Baltimore Orioles replacing shortstop Manuel Lee , who had been feeling dizzy and suffering from a stiff neck , in the top of the fourth inning . In the fifth inning , facing pitcher Dave Johnson in his first at @-@ bat , Zosky singled to left field . Later in the game , he was replaced by Rance <unk> . 
 So anticipated was Zosky 's debut that Toronto Star writer Dave Perkins compared Zosky 's debut to Lou Gehrig in 1925 , asking " Did Manuel Lee just become Manuel Pipp ? " ( in reference to Gehrig usurping Wally Pipp 's first base position that season ) . The next day , September 3 , he made his first Major League start , again against the Baltimore Orioles . Batting ninth in the starting lineup , he collected zero hits in three at @-@ bats , striking out twice against pitchers Ben McDonald and Mike Flanagan . 
 He spent 18 games in total with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1991 , batting .148 with two runs and two RBI in 27 at @-@ bats . Though he did not hit a home run , two of his four hits were for extra bases — the first was a triple off of Bob Welch and the second was a double off of Denny Neagle . He also drove in his first career RBIs against Welch , scoring John Olerud and Candy Maldonado on the same play . 
 = = = 1992 – 1994 : Zosky 's Blue Jays career = = = 
 Prior to the 1992 minor league baseball season , Baseball America ranked Zosky as the 82nd best prospect in professional baseball . Though he was expected to unseat Manuel Lee as the starting shortstop for the 1992 Major League season , he began the year with the Triple @-@ A Syracuse Chiefs after posting a batting average of <unk> and committing five errors during spring training . Rather than giving Zosky the backup job , the Blue Jays gave it to non @-@ roster invitee Alfredo Griffin , who had been signed previously . 
 He struggled early during the season with batting averages of .150 and .160 in April and May , respectively , and though he batted .350 in June , his season batting average was only .231 . Following the conclusion of the 1992 minor league season in September , Zosky was promoted to the Toronto Blue Jays , with whom he appeared in eight games . He batted .286 in seven at @-@ bats , with one of his two hits being a triple ( which he hit off of José Mesa on September 14 — exactly one year after his first career extra @-@ base hit , which was also a triple ) . Following the 1992 regular season , Zosky played for the Tucson Javelinas in the newly formed Arizona Fall League , hitting .326 . 
 As early as January 1993 , Zosky was expected to be the Toronto Blue Jays ' starting shortstop for the 1993 regular season . However , later that month Zosky was shut down due to a muscle problem in his throwing elbow . To provide insurance in case Zosky floundered , the Toronto Blue Jays signed veteran free agent Dick Schofield , who had played for the California Angels and New York Mets the previous season . They also re @-@ signed Alfredo Griffin and traded Kelly Gruber and cash to the California Angels for Luis Sojo , who would provide even further insurance in case Zosky failed . Though Zosky was expected to be the starting shortstop earlier in the year , by February Schofield was the leading contender for the position . Due to his struggles in 1992 – not only did he hit .231 , he also committed 27 errors – and his injuries , the Blue Jays began looking beyond Zosky as the future starting shortstop for the team , paying more attention to their other prospect Alex Gonzalez . 
 After undergoing a surgery on his bad elbow to remove a bone spur on March 16 , Zosky 's starting prospects dimmed even further – he was placed on the 15 @-@ day disabled list on March 26 , 1993 , later spending some time in extended spring training . He returned to the playing field in late July , and played in 33 minor league games – five in a rehabilitation stint with the Hagerstown Suns , for whom he hit .100 in 20 at @-@ bats and 28 for the Syracuse Chiefs , for whom he hit .215 in 103 at @-@ bats . Overall , he batted .195 with zero home runs and nine RBI , while committing five errors in the field . He did not play in the Major Leagues in 1993 . Instead , Dick Schofield was the Opening Day starter , though Tony Fernandez seized the starting job after his June 11 trade to the Blue Jays from the New York Mets . Following the 1993 season , he played for the Scottsdale Scorpions in the Arizona Fall League . 
 By 1994 , Alex Gonzalez had all but replaced Zosky as the Blue Jays ' shortstop of the future . Though he had some bright moments during that season 's spring training , including a game @-@ winning three @-@ run home run in an exhibition game on March 23 , Zosky had become relegated to back @-@ up status as Dick Schofield was set to make another Opening Day start – this time as a placeholder for Gonzalez , rather than Zosky . As it turned out , Gonzalez won the starting shortstop job and was the Opening Day performer at that position . By April 28 , however , Gonzalez was struggling , Schofield had retaken the starting shortstop position , and – because he was performing well with the Syracuse Chiefs – Zosky was back in the mix as a potential suitor for the position himself . Schofield retained a hold on the job , however , and Zosky spent the entire year in Triple @-@ A with the Chiefs , batting .264 with seven home runs and 34 RBI in 85 games , rattling off a 16 @-@ game hitting streak at one point . Though he played a shortened season due to injury , he tied Robert Montalvo for the team lead in sacrifice hits with six . Despite hitting .264 , his on @-@ base percentage was only .287 as he walked only nine times in 284 at @-@ bats . Though a shortstop by trade , he played more games at second base ( 41 ) than shortstop ( 34 ) that season .

 On November 18 , 1994 , Zosky 's Blue Jays career came to an end when he was traded to the Florida Marlins by for a player to be named later , who ended up being minor league pitcher Scott Pace . That was the first trade ever made by new Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash , who replaced Pat Gillick following the 1994 season . Zosky made the Marlins Opening Day roster for the 1995 season and on April 29 , he played in his first Major League game since October 4 , 1992 . Facing Trevor Wilson of the San Francisco Giants , Zosky singled in his first big league at @-@ bat in over two seasons . He played the whole game , going 1 @-@ for @-@ 3 at the plate . Appearing in only six games at the Major League level in 1995 ( with the single in his first at @-@ bat his only big league hit ) , Zosky spent most of the year with the Triple @-@ A International League 's Charlotte Knights , to whom he was optioned after the Marlins cut their roster from 28 to 25 players on May 15 .

He was cut from the big league squad on March 17 and was assigned to minor league camp the following day . He then spent the entire 1997 season in Triple @-@ A , playing for the Pacific Coast League 's Phoenix Firebirds . He began the season with a bang , hitting a grand slam on April 6 against the Colorado Springs Sky Sox . In total , he played in 86 games that season , hitting .278 with nine home runs and 45 RBI .

 On December 17 , 1997 , the Milwaukee Brewers signed Zosky as a free agent , inviting him to spring training . By the second week of the 1998 season 's spring training , it looked as though Zosky would earn a spot on the Brewers ' 25 @-@ man roster – he would eventually be cut after the Brewers purchased outfielder Eric Owens from the Florida Marlins , however , and spend the entire season with the Triple @-@ A Louisville Redbirds . That season , he hit .245 with eight home runs and 35 RBI in 90 games . He pitched for the first time in his career that season as well , appearing as a reliever in one game , allowing one hit and striking out the second batter he faced . He was granted free agency by the Brewers on October 15 , but was re @-@ signed on December 18 and given an invite to spring training . 
 Like in previous years , Zosky began the 1999 season in Triple @-@ A , playing for the Louisville <unk> . He remained with the <unk> through late July , though after catcher Bobby Hughes went on the 15 @-@ day disabled list , the Brewers purchased Zosky 's contract and brought him up to the Major League team . He made his first Major League appearance since May 14 , 1995 , when , on August 1 , 1999 , he pinch hit for Brewers pitcher Reggie Harris in the sixth inning and remained in the game , replacing Ronnie Belliard at second base .

Just a few days later , on August 5 , he was assigned back to Louisville . He earned yet another promotion to the Major Leagues on September 5 with starting shortstop Mark Loretta injured and pitcher Chad Fox placed on the 60 @-@ day disabled list . In total , he played in eight games for the Brewers that season , collecting one hit in seven at @-@ bats for a <unk> batting average . He had perhaps the best minor league season of his career in 1999 , as he hit .294 with 12 home runs and 47 RBI ( all career @-@ highs ) .

 = Borjomi ( water ) = 
 Borjomi ( Georgian : <unk> ) is a brand of naturally carbonated mineral water from springs in the Borjomi Gorge of central Georgia . The artesian springs in the valley are fed by water that filters from glaciers covering the peaks of the Bakuriani mountains at altitudes of up to 2 @,@ 300 m ( 7 @,@ 500 ft ) . The water rises to the surface without pumping and is transported by pipes to two bottling plants in the town of Borjomi . 
 The Borjomi springs were discovered by the Imperial Russian military in the 1820s . They were made famous throughout the Russian Empire , making Borjomi a popular tourist destination . The history of the brand is closely associated with the Russian imperial dynasty of Romanov . By the 1890s , Borjomi was bottled in the Georgian estates of Grand Duke Mikhail of Russia . After the Russian Revolution of 1917 and subsequent Soviet takeover of Georgia , the Borjomi enterprise was nationalized and the water was made into a top Soviet export . 
 Borjomi is exported to over 40 countries . Since 1995 , Borjomi has been trademarked and produced by the Georgian Glass and Mineral Water Company ( GG & MW ) , belonging to the Russian Alfa Group Consortium . The use of Borjomi water has been suggested by the Georgian and Russian researchers for complex treatment of several digestive diseases and diabetes mellitus . 
 = = History = = 
 The mineral springs of the Borjomi valley were discovered over one thousand years ago . Seven large rock tubs discovered by archeologists dating back to the beginning of the 7th century attest to the availability and use of the spring waters , most likely for bathing purposes . The springs were abandoned before being rediscovered in the early 19th century . By that time , as a result of the incessant warfare , Borjomi and its environs had been depopulated and covered with impassable forests . 
 In 1829 , when the Imperial Russian Army Kherson Grenadier Regiment was deployed in Borjomi for operations against the Ottoman Empire , Russian soldiers found mineral springs on the right bank of Borjomi river . Intrigued by the find , Colonel Pavel Popov , the commander of the regiment , ordered that the springs be cleaned and that the water be bottled and transported to the military base . Popov , who suffered from stomach disease tried the water first . Seeing positive results , he ordered the construction of rock walls around the spring and he had a bath house built nearby , along with a small cottage house for himself . In 1837 , when the Kherson regiment was replaced by the Georgian grenadiers regiment , its medical doctor <unk> examined the water components and their effects , sending the first results of analysis to Saint Petersburg and Moscow . By 1841 , the healing effects of Borjomi water were so famous that the viceroy of the Russian Tsar in the Caucasus Yevgeni Golovin brought his sick daughter to the springs for treatment . In light of the quick results of the treatment , he called the first spring <unk> ( Russian : <unk> ) after his daughter Yekaterina and the second <unk> ( <unk> ) after himself . 
 Golovin also expedited the official transfer of the waters from the military to civil authorities . In 1850 , a mineral water park was opened in Borjomi and in 1854 , the authorities commissioned construction of the first bottling plant . Borjomi water gained popularity for its curing effects all over the Russian Empire and the government began building palaces , parks , public gardens and hotels to accommodate incoming tourists and patients . The commute from Tiflis to Borjomi usually took 8 – 9 hours by <unk> , however the new <unk> @-@ Borjomi railroad built in 1894 significantly reduced the length of the journey . Renowned figures such as Anton Chekhov , Pyotr Tchaikovsky as well as members of the royal Russian family were among the common visitors of the springs . By that time , Borjomi was a rival of similar European spas , such as Vichy , frequented by Russian tourists , the fact that earned for Borjomi the reputation of " the Russian Vichy " and " the pearl of the Caucasus " . 
 In 1894 , Grand Duke Mikhail Romanov built a bottling plant in the Borjomi park which continued to operate until the 1950s . The income from the Borjomi waters enterprise contributed to the wealth of Mikhail 's son and successor Nikolay , who was the richest of all Russian grand dukes by <unk> 1890 was built the first bottling plant of Borjomi . Demand on the glass bottles were high and A glass factory was built in 1896 . According to archives , in 1854 only 1350 bottles of water were produced , in 1905 the number reached 320 @,@ 000 and by 1913 over 9 million bottles were sold . After the establishment of Soviet rule in Georgia , Borjomi was widely sold around the Soviet Union and was favored by Soviet leaders such as Joseph Stalin . Exploration of the Borjomi Gorge was conducted in 1927 . Between then and 1982 , 57 exploration wells ( depths ranging from 18 @.@ 4 m ( 60 ft ) to 1 @,@ 502 m ( 4 @,@ 928 ft ) ) were drilled . In 1961 , 423 @,@ 000 bottles of Borjomi was exported to 15 countries including the United States , France and Austria . During the existence of the Soviet Union , Borjomi was recognized as the third best known brand of the USSR after the Volga car and Aeroflot airlines . In the 1980s , annual production of Borjomi water reached 400 million bottles . The production slowed down with the collapse of the Soviet Union and economic stagnation in the independent Republic of Georgia . In 1995 , bottling of Borjomi was restarted by the Georgian Glass and Mineral Waters Company ( GG & MW ) , which increased the production forty @-@ fold . According to the company , 80 % of Borjomi produced that year was exported abroad — more than half of this amount to Russia . Despite counterfeit drinks being produced under the Borjomi label as a result of rising piracy during the 1990s , Borjomi water was able to reclaim its reputation by 2000 in a distinctive packaging campaign . The piracy also slowed down due to the 1998 Russian financial crisis . 
 In May 2006 , Russia banned imports of the Georgian mineral waters , declaring them unsafe . The ban got lifted after 7 years in 2013 . Georgia viewed this as an attempt to restrict access to the Russian market and making Borjomi a pawn in post @-@ Soviet political power play . As a result of the ban , GG & MW lost <unk> 25 million in 2006 , but the company declared the crisis to have been overcome by 2008 , with sales volumes reaching pre @-@ 2006 level . The sales and export of Borjomi mineral water dropped again by 30 @-@ 40 % starting from October 2008 due to the global financial crisis . But already in 2010 the company declared that sales figures of Borjomi were the same as the company had before the ban . In 2011 sales company sold 15 % more Borjomi than they were selling before the ban . Today Borjomi is sold in 40 countries worldwide . Today , Borjomi in post @-@ soviet countries is a number one brand in imported mineral water brand segment .

 Borjomi is a water of volcanic origin which is over 1 @,@ 500 years old . It is pushed up to the surface from <unk> below ground by natural carbon dioxide pressure . Borjomi does not cool down before it reaches the surface and comes out at a temperature of 38 – 41 ° C ( 100 – 106 ° F ) . The Borjomi springs are located in the central part of the <unk> @-@ Imereti mountain range of Greater Caucasus at an altitude of 760 – 920 m ( 2 @,@ 490 – 3 @,@ 020 ft ) above sea level . The average depth of each of the nine spring wells is 1 @,@ 200 – 1 @,@ 500 m ( 3 @,@ 900 – 4 @,@ 900 ft ) . 
 In order to preserve the mineral composition of the springs , in 2006 the Georgian Ministry of Environment Protection and Natural Resources approved a production plan for 2006 – 2031 estimating 561 @,@ 000 litres per day which allows bottling of over 1 million bottles a day using 10 wells in Borjomi Gorge . The wells are located in 3 exploitation lots : Central ( in the vicinity of Borjomi town ) , Likani ( in Likani village ) and <unk> @-@ <unk> ( in villages <unk> and <unk> ) . The water received from the wells travels by a 25 km ( 16 mi ) stainless steel pipeline to two bottling plants where it is cooled and bottled . The first plant specializes in glass bottling , the second in PET bottling . 
 The production of mineral water and the associated tourist economy in Borjomi and the nearby Borjomi @-@ <unk> National Park make up 10 percent of Georgia 's export trade . Construction of the Baku @-@ Tbilisi @-@ Ceyhan oil pipeline near the Borjomi has been controversial because of potential negative environmental and economic impacts on the region .

 The next day , many survivors in the island 's camp are stressed , including Sullivan ( Scott Paulin ) , who is diagnosed with hives by Jack Shephard ( Matthew Fox ) . John Locke ( Terry O 'Quinn ) and his new hunting companion , Ethan Rom ( William Mapother ) , give some newly found luggage to Hurley ; he looks through it and finds golf clubs . The next morning , Hurley builds a golf course to improve morale amongst the survivors . 
 Rousseau asks Sayid about Nadia , and he says that she is dead because of him . Rousseau shows Sayid a broken music box given to her as a gift , and he tells her he can fix it . Rousseau reveals that she was part of a science team , and they were shipwrecked on the island about three days after leaving Tahiti . She identifies the " Others " as the carriers of a sickness that her companions caught , and says that the Others whisper in the jungle , although she has never seen them . Sayid does not believe her , but continues to fix the music box . After finishing the repairs , much to Rousseau 's joy , he asks her to let him go . The duo hear a growl outside , and Rousseau pursues it , leaving Sayid alone . 
 Sayid escapes from Rousseau 's bunker while she is gone , grabbing a rifle , maps and notes she has made about the island . Rousseau finds him and they have a standoff ; he tries to fire the rifle , but no bullet discharges . Rousseau says she removed the firing pin , and Robert , her former lover , made the same mistake before she killed him . She reveals that it was she who killed her team , aiming to stop the disease from reaching the outside world . Sayid talks Rousseau into letting him go , but , before leaving , asks about Alex . Rousseau says that Alex was her child . While trying to find his way back to camp , Sayid hears the whispering of which Rousseau had spoken . 
 = = Production = = 
 The episode was written by David Fury and directed by Greg Yaitanes . According to series co @-@ creator Damon Lindelof , discussion of both " Solitary " and the following episode , " Raised by Another " , began in September 2004 , when Lost debuted on television . The production team had fallen behind schedule , so Fury worked on " Solitary " while others went to a separate room to discuss " Raised by Another " , with co @-@ creator Carlton Cuse " bouncing between the two universes " . Although production codes generally go in ascending order , " Solitary " had production code 107 , while " Raised by Another " had production code 106 . This was because , despite the broadcast dates , " Raised by Another " was written before " Solitary " . The episodes were edited so that Sayid would return at the end of " Raised by Another " . " Solitary " and " Raised by Another " were the first to orient the series in a " weird and mythological " direction , according to Lindelof . In " Solitary " , the series solved its first mystery by revealing the origin of the French voice heard earlier . This reveal occurred despite the network encouraging the producers to wait until the finale to show Rousseau . 
 The episode was the first to feature flashbacks with Sayid , an Arab character . The producers knew they had to tread carefully with the character due to possible prejudices against Arabs . The actor , Naveen Andrews , said , " we were all pretty nervous , in the sense that we all felt we owed a real obligation , not just to Iraqis but the entire Arab world about how this character would be played . " In an early draft of " Solitary " , Rousseau told Sayid that she and her research team were studying time . When ABC saw this draft , they asked the producers to remove this line , explaining that they did not want the show to venture into science fiction during the first season . The character of Sullivan , to whose medical woes Jack tended , was created to make the rest of the survivors think that Rousseau 's team was killed by an illness . The idea for Hurley 's golf course came from script coordinator Brent Fletcher ; it was based on a miniature golf course he created in the offices for the television show Angel . 
 = = Reception = = 
 " Solitary " first aired in the United States on November 17 , 2004 . An estimated 17 @.@ 64 million American viewers watched the episode on ABC , a decrease from 18 @.@ 44 million viewers in the previous episode , " Confidence Man " . In a review of the episode , Chris Carabott of IGN commented that Rousseau appeared to be more emotionally fragile than in later seasons , and was like a " loose cannon " . Carabott found that as the series progressed and the mystery around the character was lessened , Rousseau was unable to deliver the same impact she made in her first appearance . Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club commended Mira Furlan 's performance , writing , " [ Rousseau is ] an unreliable historian of the island in the best way . Rousseau has been on this island for over sixteen years , and it shows in her ramshackle bunker , her unkempt appearance , and the fact she tortures Sayid for information before even asking him a cursory question about his identity . " 
 In a ranking of every episode of Lost ( excluding the finale ) for the Los Angeles Times , Todd VanDerWerff ranked " Solitary " as the show 's 45th best episode , and called it underrated . In a similar list , IGN staff ranked the episode as Lost 's 51st best , and observed that " despite [ Sayid 's ] dark past , it was hard not to love the character even more after this episode . " MTV ranked the episode the 32nd best of the series . Writing for Zap2it in 2008 , Ryan McGee said he particularly enjoyed the episode and deemed it one of his top ten favorite episodes that had aired up to that point . McGee explained that " Solitary " contains " a lot of enclosed encounters between two people , set against a gorgeously shot B story that warms the heart . " 
 = Music of Final Fantasy VIII = 
 The music of the video game Final Fantasy VIII was composed by regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu . The Final Fantasy VIII Original Soundtrack , a compilation of all music in the game , was released on four Compact Discs by DigiCube in Japan , and by Square EA in North America . A special orchestral arrangement of selected tracks from the game — arranged by Shirō Hamaguchi — was released under the title Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec Final Fantasy VIII , and a collection of piano arrangements — performed by Shinko Ogata — was released under the title Piano Collections Final Fantasy VIII . 
 The game 's soundtrack is best known for two tracks : " Liberi Fatali " , a Latin choral piece that is played during the introduction to the game , and " Eyes on Me " , a pop song serving as the game 's theme , performed by Chinese singer Faye Wong . Reviewers were generally pleased with the music , although several cited issues while comparing the score to previous games or looking at individual tracks . 
 = = Creation and influence = = 
 Nobuo Uematsu 's usual influences include Emerson , Lake & Palmer , Simon and Garfunkel , and Elton John . In regard to Final Fantasy VIII , Uematsu did not prefer to use multiple sources to find MIDI instruments — " I could be coming up with a great melody in the very moment " — instead using a Roland <unk> synthesizer for the entire score . Uematsu wrote notes based on character designs and screenplays , creating a general picture of the pieces ' moods . He could not express a character 's emotions solely with plot , instead using images of appearance and attire — " It 's important to know when their emotions are at their height , but it usually takes until a month before release for them to finish the ending dialog ... ! " In response to a question by IGN music stating that the music of Final Fantasy VIII was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game , Uematsu stated " the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line , of course , but it 's also my intention to put various types of music into one game " . 
 Uematsu enjoys writing lyrical pieces , but tries not to be genre @-@ specific . He asserts that expressing the emotions he desires is more important than improving skills : " I think it will be a shame if we won 't be able to cry as we play our own game " . The absence of character themes was due to him finding those of Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy VII ineffective . Uematsu considers it reasonable to have character themes if each character has a " highlight " in the game , but he found Final Fantasy VIII only focused on Squall Leonhart and Rinoa Heartilly as a couple , resulting in the " Eyes on Me " theme . The soundtrack features a Latin choral track " Liberi Fatali " , which translates to " Fated Children " ; its melody forms a musical theme heard in several other pieces in the soundtrack , such as " SeeD " and " The Landing " , while the name of " Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec " is the recurring lyrics in " Liberi Fatali " . 
 Near the end of the production of Final Fantasy VII , the developers suggested to use a singer , but abandoned the idea due to a lack of reasoning based on the game 's theme and storyline . However , Nobuo Uematsu thought a ballad would closely relate to the theme and characters of Final Fantasy VIII . This resulted in the game 's developers sharing " countless " artists , eventually deciding on Faye Wong , a Chinese vocalist . Uematsu claims " her voice and mood seem to match my image of the song exactly " , and that her ethnicity " fits the international image of Final Fantasy " . After negotiations were made , " Eyes on Me " was recorded in Hong Kong with an orchestra .

IGN later named the Final Fantasy VIII soundtrack as fourth best in its Final Fantasy Soundtrack Countdown feature . GameSpot considered the game 's sound its weakest point , but still commended it , claiming it has " more ' quality ' songs than Final Fantasy VII " . Lastly , Game Revolution stated that " there are only a few tracks that really stand out " , including " Eyes on Me " , which it deemed a " cliched , but beautiful love song " .

Adam Corn of SoundtrackCentral.com claimed the album shows similarities to previous Final Fantasy games , but asserted he was " not overly impressed with this one " . A reviewer from Square Enix Music Online claimed the soundtrack is " unique and very special " due to its contrasts — " When signs of age of the Final Fantasy franchise are shown " , Uematsu counterbalances this by creating something " weird and wonderful [ ... ] when the soundtrack becomes too serious , a light @-@ hearted number is inserted to liven up the mood " . Ben Schweitzer of RPGFan said in his review of the album that " the main flavor of Uematsu 's compositions , his melodic style , remains consistent , and more importantly , consistently good " . He criticized , however , the more minimalist pieces , which in his opinion were bland .

 = Flag of China = 
 The flag of the People 's Republic of China ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : Zhōnghuá <unk> <unk> <unk> ) is a red field charged in the canton ( upper corner nearest the flagpole ) with five golden stars . The design features one large star , with four smaller stars in a semicircle set off towards the fly ( the side farthest from the flag pole ) . The red represents the communist revolution ; the five stars and their relationship represent the unity of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China ( CPC ) . Sometimes , the flag is referred to as the " Five @-@ star Red Flag " ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : wǔ <unk> hóng <unk> ) . 
 The flag was designed by Zeng <unk> , a citizen from Wenzhou , Zhejiang . He designed it in response to a circular distributed by the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> <unk> huìyì <unk> <unk> ) in July 1949 , shortly after they came to power following the Chinese Civil War . The design competition received 2 @,@ 992 ( or 3 @,@ 012 , see below ) entries , and Zeng 's design was put into a pool of 38 finalists . After several meetings and slight modifications , Zeng 's design was chosen as the national flag . The first flag was hoisted by the People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) on a pole overlooking Beijing 's Tiananmen Square on October 1 , 1949 , at a ceremony announcing the founding of the People 's Republic . 
 Other flags used in the People 's Republic of China use a red background to symbolize the revolution in conjunction with other symbols . The flag of the People 's Liberation Army uses the gold star with the Chinese characters 8 @-@ 1 ( for August 1 , the date of the PLA 's founding ) . The flag of the Communist Party of China replaces all of the stars with the party emblem . Due to government regulations , cities and provinces of China cannot have their own flags ; the only sub @-@ national flags that exist are those of the Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions . Despite this , at least two cities have adopted flags after the law was passed . The cities of Kaifeng and <unk> adopted their flags in March 2006 and March 2009 respectively . This implies that the law is either repealed or not enforced . 
 = = History of the design = = 
 On July 4 , 1949 , the sixth working group of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference ( <unk> , <unk> ) created a notice to submit designs for the national flag . After a few changes , the notice was published in the papers People 's Daily , Beiping Liberation News , Xinmin News , <unk> Daily , Guangming Daily , <unk> Daily and Tianjin Daily during a period between July 15 – 26 . The list requirements for the national flag were also posted in the notice : 
 Chinese characteristics ( Geography , nationality , history , culture , etc . ) 
 Power characteristics ( A people 's democratic government , led by the working class and based on the worker @-@ peasant alliance . ) 
 The shape should be rectangular and the length @-@ breadth ratio should be 3 : 2 
 The colour should mainly be bright red ( an early draft of the notice had the colour at dark red , but was changed to bright red by Zhou Enlai ) . 
 Zeng <unk> was working in Shanghai at the time the announcement came out ; he wanted to create a flag design to express his patriotic enthusiasm for the new country . In the middle of July , he sat down in his attic for multiple nights to come up with designs . His inspiration for the current design comes from the stars shining in the night sky . He thought of a Chinese proverb " longing for the stars , longing for the moon , " ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) which shows yearning . Later , he realized that the CPC was the great savior ( <unk> , dà <unk> ) of the Chinese people , being represented by a larger star . The idea of four small stars came from On the People 's Democratic Dictatorship a speech by Mao Zedong , which defined the Chinese people as consisting of four social classes . Yellow also implies that China belongs to the Chinese people , a " yellow race " . After working out the details of the placement of the stars and their sizes ( he had tried to put all of the stars in the center , but believed it would be too heavy and dull ) , he sent his " Five Stars on a Field of Red " ( <unk> , hóng <unk> <unk> <unk> ) design to the committee in the middle of August . 
 As of August 20 , a total of 2 @,@ 992 ( or 3 @,@ 012 ) designs were sent to the flag committee , which included input from committee members themselves , such as Guo Moruo and Tan Kah Kee . From August 16 to 20 , the designs were viewed at the Beijing Hotel and culled down to a list of 38 . These designs are collected into a book named A Reference of National Flag Designs ( <unk> ) . This book was then submitted to the newly established Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference ( CPPCC ) for further discussion . However , Zeng 's design wasn 't included until Tian Han nominated it again . 
 In the morning of September 23 , the representatives of the CPPCC discussed the national flags , but came to no conclusion . Some didn 't like the symbolism which Zeng attached to the four smaller stars , and said it shouldn 't include the bourgeoisie . The design Mao and others liked had a giant golden star in the corner on a red flag that was charged with a golden horizontal bar . But this design was strongly opposed by Zhang <unk> due to the golden bar symbolizing the tearing apart of the revolution and the country . In the night , Peng <unk> ( <unk> ) recommended Zeng 's design to Zhou Enlai , Zhou was satisfied with it and asked for a larger copy of the design to be made . Tan Kah Kee also gave his advice to Mao and Zhou that the power characteristics are more important than Chinese geography characteristics , so there 's no need to insist on the golden bar which stands for the Yellow River . Two days later , Mao had a meeting in his office about the flag . He persuaded everyone to adopt Zeng 's design , with some slight modifications . According to earlier discussions at the Beijing Hotel , the hammer and sickle from Zeng 's original design was removed since it was similar to the Flag of the Soviet Union . On September 27 , 1949 , Zeng 's modified design was selected unanimously by the First Plenary Session of CPPCC , which changed the flag 's name to " Five @-@ star Red Flag " . 
 On September 29 , the new flag was published in the People 's Daily , so the design could be copied by other local authorities . The flag was officially unveiled in Beijing ’ s Tiananmen Square on October 1 , 1949 , the formal announcement of the founding of the People ’ s Republic of China . The first flag flown over Tiananmen Square was sewn together by Zhao <unk> ( <unk> ) , a seamstress who finished the task around 1 PM on September 30 . Zeng had a hard time believing that his design was picked , due to the missing hammer and sickle from the giant star . However , he was officially congratulated by the General Office of the People 's Government as the designer of the flag and received 5 million yuan for his work . 
 Rejected alternate designs of the Five @-@ star Red Flag 
 Other rejected proposed designs 
 = = Symbolism = = 
 According to the current government interpretation of the flag , the red background symbolizes the revolution and the golden colours were used to " radiate " on the red background . The five stars and their relationship represents the unity of Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China . The orientation of the stars shows that the unity should go around a center . In the original description of the flag by Zeng , the larger star symbolizes the Communist Party of China , and the four smaller stars that surround the big star symbolize the four social classes ( the working class , the peasantry , the urban petite bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie ) of Chinese people mentioned in Mao 's " On the People 's Democratic Dictatorship " . The five stars that formed an ellipse represent the territory of China ( including Outer Mongolia ) which is shaped like a <unk> leaf . It is sometimes stated that the five stars of the flag represent the five largest ethnic groups . This is generally regarded as an erroneous conflation with the " Five Races Under One Union " flag , used 1912 – 28 by the Beiyang Government of Republic of China , whose different @-@ coloured stripes represented the Han , Manchus , Mongols , Hui , and Tibetans . 
 = = Construction details , sizes and colours = = 
 The construction sheet for the national flag was published on September 28 , 1949 by an order from the Presidium of the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference . The flag is split into four sections , with the top hoist part of the flag being a grid of 10 by 15 units . The center of the biggest star is placed at five units from the hoist and five units from the top of the flag . The diameter of the biggest star 's circumscribed circle is six units . Of the four smaller stars , the first one is centered two units from the top of the flag , 10 units from the hoist ; the second one is centered four units from the top of the flag and 12 units from the hoist ; the third one is centered seven units from the top of the flag and 12 units from the hoist ; the fourth one is centered nine units from the top of the flag and 10 units from the hoist . The diameter of each small star 's circumscribed circle is two units . Each of the top points of the four smaller stars are rotated such that they point towards the center point of the larger star . The information can also be found in the document " GB <unk> @-@ 2004 : National flag " that was released by the Standardization Administration of China . The Law on the National Flag mentions five possible sizes that could be made for the national flag : According to Article four of the Law On the National Flag , people 's governments of provinces , autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government are directed to authorize companies to make any copy of the national flag .

 The current law about the national flag was passed by 14th Meeting of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People 's Congress on June 28 , 1990 and was enforced starting October 1 , 1990 .

The law also stresses that the national flag is " the symbol and hallmark of the People 's Republic of China " and that everyone " shall respect and care for the National Flag . "

 Due to an order passed by the CPC Central Committee General Office and General Office of the State Council , cities and provinces are no longer allowed to adopt their own symbols . However , both of the Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Regions of China have their own special flags . The precise use of the SAR flags are regulated by laws passed by the National People 's Congress . 
 The Regional Flag of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region features a stylized , white , five @-@ petal Bauhinia blakeana flower in the center of a red field . On each petal is a red star ; the stars demonstrate that Hong Kong residents love their motherland while the overall flag design signifies the link re @-@ established between post @-@ colonial Hong Kong and China while demonstrating the " One country , two systems " political principle applied to the region . The flag of Hong Kong was adopted on 16 February 1990 . On 10 August 1996 , it received formal approval from the Preparatory Committee , a group which advised the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) on Hong Kong 's transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to the PRC in 1997 . The flag was first officially hoisted on 1 July 1997 , in the handover ceremony marking the transfer of sovereignty . 
 The Regional flag of the Macau Special Administrative Region is " Macau green " with a lotus flower above a stylized image of the Governor Nobre de Carvalho Bridge and water in white , beneath an arc of five gold , five @-@ pointed stars : one large star in the center of the arc and four smaller ones . The lotus was chosen as the floral emblem of Macau . The Governor Nobre de Carvalho Bridge is a bridge linking the Macau Peninsula and the island of <unk> . The bridge is one of the most recognizable landmarks of the territory . The water beneath the lotus and the bridge symbolize Macau 's position as a port and its role played in the territory . The five five @-@ pointed stars echo the design of the national flag , symbolizing the relationship Macau has with its mother country . The design was chosen on January 15 , 1993 by a committee that was drafting the Basic Law for the Macau SAR and was formally adopted by the Macau SAR Preparatory Committee on January 16 , 1999 . The flag was first officially hoisted on 20 December 1999 , in the handover ceremony marking the transfer of sovereignty .

 There are four flags that are used by the People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) . The main feature of these flags is a golden star at the top left corner and two Chinese characters " <unk> " to the right of the star , all placed on a red background . The characters " <unk> " ( literally " eight one " ) pay homage to the events on August 1 , 1927 ( 8th month , 1st day ) ; this was when the PLA was created by the Communist Party to start their rebellion against the Kuomintang Government in Nanchang . The main flag of the PLA was created on June 15 , 1949 by a decree issued from Mao . The flag has a ratio of 4 by 5 , which has a white sleeve measuring 1 ⁄ 16 of the flag 's length . For ceremonies , a PLA flag with golden fringe is placed on a pole with gold and red spiral stripes and topped with a golden finial and red tassel . Each branch of the PLA , the Ground Forces , Navy and Air Force , also have their own flags to use . In a 1992 order , the flags of the three branches were defined . The top 5 ⁄ 8 of the flags is the same as the PLA flag ; the bottom 3 ⁄ 8 are occupied by the colours of the branches . The flag of the Ground Forces has a forest green bar at the bottom , the naval ensign has stripes of blue and white at the bottom , the Air Force uses a sky blue bar and the Rocket Force uses a yellow bar at the bottom . The forest green represents the earth , the blue and white stripes represent the seas , the sky blue represents the air and the yellow represents the flare of missile launching .

 After the Communist Party of China was founded in 1920 , various sections of the party made flags based on what the Bolsheviks used , producing various designs and patterns . The current flag of the CPC was not created until April 28 , 1942 . On that date , the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau issued a decree announcing the flag and the pattern it should follow . The design was further defined in the CPC Constitution in 1996 . The flag has a red background that is charged with the emblem of the CPC in gold at the top left corner . The flag ratio is defined as two by three ( 24 × 36 units ) ; the size of the emblem is eight units square , placed four units away from the hoist and three units away from the top of the flag . 
 The flag of the Communist Youth League of China was adopted on May 4 , 1950 . The design of the flag consists of the group emblem , a gold star surrounded by a ring of gold , charged on a red field . The construction of the flag consists of making the top hoist portion of the flag into twelve by eighteen units , placing the emblem in the middle of that rectangle . The radius of the emblem is four units . 
 There are two flags used by the Young Pioneers of China . The first flag that is used is for large detachments . The length of the flag is 90 centimeters and the width is 120 centimeters . A golden badge of the Young Pioneers is placed in the center of the flag . For a medium detachment , a modified flag is used . The flag has a length of 60 centimeters and a width of 80 centimeters . A 20 @-@ centimeter triangle is cut out of the fly edge of the flag and the golden emblem is shifted closer towards the hoist . 
 = Exsudoporus frostii = 
 Exsudoporus frostii ( formerly Boletus frostii ) , commonly known as Frost 's bolete or the apple bolete , is a bolete fungus first described scientifically in 1874 . A member of the family Boletaceae , the mushrooms produced by the fungus have tubes and pores instead of gills on the underside of their caps . Exsudoporus frostii is distributed in the eastern United States from Maine to Georgia and Arizona , and south to Mexico and Costa Rica . A mycorrhizal species , its fruit bodies are typically found growing near hardwood trees , especially oak . 
 Exsudoporus frostii mushrooms can be recognized by their dark red sticky caps , the red pores , the network @-@ like pattern of the stem , and the bluing reaction to tissue injury . Another characteristic of young , moist fruit bodies is the amber @-@ colored drops exuded on the pore surface . Although the mushrooms are considered edible , they are generally not recommended for consumption because of the risk of confusion with other poisonous red @-@ pored , blue @-@ bruising boletes . E. frostii may be distinguished from other superficially similar red @-@ capped boletes by differences in distribution , associated tree species , bluing reaction , or morphology . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was named by the Unitarian minister John Lewis Russell of Salem , Massachusetts , based on specimens found in Brattleboro , Vermont . He named the fungus after his friend , another amateur American mycologist , Charles Christopher Frost , who published a description of the species in his 1874 survey of the boletes of New England . When the name of a species is contributed by an individual , but the name is formally published by another , the contributor 's name can be cited , separated from the publishing author as apud ; for this reason , the name and authority are written Boletus <unk> Russell apud Frost in some older literature . Bernard Ogilvie Dodge made reference to B. frostii in 1950 during an address to the Mycological Society of America , in which he spoke about the role of the amateur in discovering new species : " They would have informed us all about the man Russell , who named a fine new bolete for his friend Frost , and about the man Frost , who named a fine new bolete for his friend Russell . Boletus <unk> and Boletus <unk> are mushrooms with character , even though they were described by amateurs . " However , in attempting to establish a lectotype specimen , mycologist Roy Halling examined both Russell 's original material and his accompanying notes ; he concluded that it was Frost who made the original species determinations , further suggesting " there is no evidence to show that Russell ever collected B. frostii or wrote a description of it . " 
 William Murrill in 1909 placed the species in the genus Suillellus , while Sanshi Imai transferred it to Tubiporus in 1968 . Tubiporus has since been synonymized with Boletus . In 1945 , Rolf Singer described a bolete he found in Florida ; although he originally described it as a subspecies of B. frostii , he later considered the differences between the taxa significant enough to warrant publishing Boletus floridanus as a unique species . Following recent molecular studies that outlined a new phylogenetic framework for the Boletaceae , the bolete was transferred to the newly circumscribed genus Exsudoporus . 
 Exsudoporus frostii is commonly known as " Frost 's bolete " or the " apple bolete " . In Mexico , its vernacular name is <unk> <unk> , which translates to " sour belly " .

 The shape of the cap of the young fruit body ranges from a half sphere to convex , later becoming broadly convex to flat or shallowly depressed , with a diameter of 5 – 15 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 – 5 @.@ 9 in ) . The edge of the cap is curved inward , although as it ages it can <unk> and turn upward . In moist conditions , the cap surface is sticky as a result of its cuticle , which is made of gelatinized hyphae . If the fruit body has dried out after a rain , the cap is especially shiny , sometimes appearing finely areolate ( having a pattern of block @-@ like areas similar to cracked , dried mud ) . Young mushrooms have a whitish bloom on the cap surface . 
 The color is bright red initially , but fades with age . The flesh is up to 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 0 in ) thick , and ranges in color from pallid to pale yellow to lemon yellow . The flesh has a variable staining reaction in response to bruising , so some specimens may turn deep blue almost immediately , while others turn blue weakly and slowly . 
 The tubes comprising the pore surface ( the hymenium ) are 9 – 15 mm deep , yellow to olivaceous yellow ( mustard yellow ) , turning dingy blue when bruised . The pores are small ( 2 to 3 per mm ) , circular , and until old age a deep red color that eventually becomes paler . The pore surface is often beaded with yellowish droplets when young ( a distinguishing characteristic ) , and readily stains blue when bruised . The stem is 4 to 12 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 to 4 @.@ 7 in ) long , and 1 to 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 0 in ) thick at its apex . It is roughly equal in thickness throughout its length , though it may taper somewhat toward the top ; some specimens may appear ventricose ( swollen in the middle ) . The stem surface is mostly red , or yellowish near the base ; it is reticulate — characterized by ridges arranged in the form of a net @-@ like pattern . Mycelia , visible at the base of the stem , are yellowish white to light yellow . 
 The spore print of B. frostii is olive brown . The spores are thick walled , smooth , and spindle shaped , with dimensions of 11 – 15 by 4 – 5 µm . Longer spores up to 18 µm long may also be present . The cap cuticle , or pileipellis , is made of a tangled layer of gelatinized hyphae that are 3 – 6 µm wide . The spore @-@ bearing cells , the basidia , are four spored and measure 26 – 35 by 10 @.@ 5 – 11 @.@ 5 µm . Cystidia are non @-@ fertile cells interspersed among the basidia , and they are prevalent in the hymenial tissue of E. frostii . These hyaline ( translucent ) cells measure 30 – 53 long by 7 @.@ 5 – 14 µm wide , and range in shape from somewhat like a spindle ( tapering at each end , but with one end typically rounded ) to <unk> — shaped somewhat like a swollen bottle .

 In 1910 , Murrill wrote of this mushroom 's edibility : " Usually viewed with suspicion because of its red hymenium , but its properties are not accurately known . " Since then , several authors have advised against consuming the species , due to its resemblance to other toxic red @-@ capped boletes . In his 100 Edible Mushrooms ( 2007 ) , Michael Kuo notes that although the mushroom is apparently edible for some , it " affects others negatively " . Despite these warnings , Exsudoporus frostii is edible , and David Arora mentions that it is commonly sold in rural markets in Mexico ; a 1997 study suggests that it is only consumed in rural areas in Querétaro state . Its taste and odor have been described as " pleasant " or " sweet " and somewhat like citrus , although the cuticle of the cap may taste acidic . 
 Chemical analysis of fresh fruit bodies collected in Mexico showed them to have the following composition : moisture 94 @.@ 53 % ; ash 3 @.@ 23 milligrams per gram of mushroom ( mg / g ) ; dietary fiber 30 @.@ 24 mg / g ; fat 3 @.@ 68 mg / g ; and protein 15 @.@ 81 mg / g . The free fatty acid content of dried fruit bodies was 45 mg / g , slightly more than the common button mushroom ( Agaricus bisporus ) , which had 35 mg / g . The majority of this total was oleic acid ( 19 @.@ 5 mg / g ) , followed by linoleic acid ( 16 @.@ 8 mg / g ) and palmitic acid ( 16 @.@ 9 mg / g ) . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Other red @-@ capped boletes include the poisonous B. flammans and B. rubroflammeus ; the former grows most commonly under conifers , the latter in association with hardwoods in eastern North America and southern Arizona . Often confused with B. frostii are E. <unk> and B. <unk> , but the latter two species are known only from Europe and always grow in association with oaks . The fruit bodies of young specimens of B. <unk> , newly described from Japan in 2011 , are similar in appearance to B. frostii . In addition to its distribution , B. <unk> can be distinguished from B. frostii by having flesh that does not bruise blue and a stem in which the reticulum is not as deep and coarse . B. <unk> , found in Belize , produces smaller caps that are 1 @.@ 7 to 2 @.@ 0 cm ( 0 @.@ 7 to 0 @.@ 8 in ) in diameter . Boletus <unk> , found in eastern North America , has a red to reddish @-@ brown cap and reticulate stem , but its pore surface is yellow , and the fruit body does not bruise blue . 
 Exsudoporus floridanus differs from E. frostii in having a lighter cap color and in the texture of the cap surface : it is tomentose ( covered with dense , short , soft , matted hairs ) or <unk> ( like velvet ) , compared to the relatively smooth surface of E. frostii . Singer notes that although the physical characteristics between the two taxa may be blurred and are hard to define , the area of origin can reliably distinguish them : E. floridanus is found on shaded lawns and scrubland in open oak stands in non @-@ tropical regions of Florida , typically on grassy or sandy soil , where it fruits between May and October . 
 = = Ecology , habitat , and distribution = = 
 Exsudoporus frostii is a mycorrhizal species , meaning that the fungus forms associations with the roots of various species of trees . These associations are mutualistic , because the fungus absorbs mineral nutrients from the soil and channels these into the plant , while the plant provides the fungus with sugars , a product of photosynthesis . The characteristic feature of the mycorrhiza is the presence of a sheath of fungal tissue that encases the terminal , nutrient @-@ absorbing rootlets of the host plant . The fungus forms an extensive underground network of hyphae that radiate outward from the surface of the root sheath , effectively increasing the surface area for nutrient absorption . The hyphae also invade between the root cortical cells to form a Hartig net . Using pure culture techniques , Exsudoporus frostii has been shown to form mycorrhizae with Virginia pine ( Pinus virginiana ) , while a field study confirms a similar association with the oak Quercus <unk> . 
 The fruit bodies grow solitarily , scattered , or in groups on the ground under hardwood trees ; the fungus fruits in summer to early autumn . William Murrill noted its preference for growing in " thin oak woods , where the light is sufficient to enable grass to grow " , and Alexander H. Smith mentioned its preference for growing in " thin , sandy soil under scrub oak . " In the United States , it is distributed from Maine south to Georgia , extending west to Tennessee , Michigan , and southern Arizona . In Mexico , it is often found under <unk> . It has also been collected in Costa Rica , where it associates with the oak species Quercus <unk> , Q. costaricensis , Q. <unk> , and Q. <unk> . A 1980 publication tentatively suggested that the fungus was also present in Italy , but the author later determined that the putative E. frostii was actually Boletus <unk> . 
 Fruit bodies can be parasitized by the mold @-@ like fungus Sepedonium ampullosporum . Infection results in necrosis of the mushroom tissue , and a yellow color caused by the formation of large amounts of pigmented aleurioconidia ( single @-@ celled conidia produced by extrusion from the conidiophores ) .

 In mid @-@ 2010 , there was a sudden surge in suicide rates amongst gay teenagers in the United States . In September 2010 , at least six adolescents took their lives due to factors related to gay bullying . After reading about the surge of gay teen suicides , Kesha was inspired to write " We R Who We R " , along with Dr. Luke , Benny Blanco , Ammo , and Jacob Kasher Hindlin . Production of the song was completed by Luke alongside Blanco and Ammo . After being nominated for the 2011 Billboard Music Awards , Kesha elaborated on the song 's initial inspiration . She stated that she was concerned with today 's society , criticizing the fact that people have to hide themselves and pretend to be someone other than who they are . Regarding her music she said that it was not for everyone , claiming that she is a misfit in society and not everyone understands her or what she stands for . 
 Kesha explained that she wanted the song to become a pride anthem ; " I wanted to inspire people ... to be themselves . It 's a celebration of any sort of quirks or eccentricities . " She elaborated , " I was really affected by the suicides that have been happening , having been subject to very public hatred [ myself ] . I have absolutely no idea how these kids felt . What I 'm going through is nothing compared to what they had to go through . Just know things do get better and you need to celebrate who you are . Every weird thing about you is beautiful and makes life interesting . Hopefully the song really captures that emotion of celebrating who you are ... I just felt like people hate because they don 't understand or they 're jealous , It 's all coming from a very negative place and I really feel like people don 't need to pay attention to that . "

He wrote , " we 've never disputed that she carries it all off in a fashion that 's frank , fearless and unashamedly fun . " The song 's chorus was highlighted in the review , with Copsey calling it " her <unk> effort to date " that contained " bouncy Dr Luke beats and her usual bubblegum melodies " . 
 Jocelyn Vena from MTV News gave the song a positive review , writing " [ Kesha ] has found a chart @-@ topping formula , combin [ ing ] killer beats with lyrics about super @-@ fun parties and hot pants . " Vena commented that , although the song was not groundbreaking and did not stray too far away from previous singles " Tik Tok " or " Take It Off " , that hardly matters as " it 's another uber @-@ fun tune about how awesome it is to dance the night away " with an " inspired [ message about ] the recent rash of suicides among gay youth . " Jason Lipshutz from Billboard gave the song a positive review ; he praised Dr. Luke 's production and the song 's chorus . Lipshutz commented on the song 's similarity to " Tik Tok " , writing , " Instead of straying from the ' TiK ToK ' formula , ' We R Who We R , ' ... smartly maximizes [ Kesha 's ] most appealing qualities . " The review concluded that the song " demonstrates that [ Kesha ] still has mileage left in her electro @-@ pop sound as she gears up for her next album .

" Newman referred to herself as one of the singer 's biggest detractors , but wrote " I like one of her <unk> at least begrudgingly admire its crass charms . " In an album review of Cannibal , Newman referred to the song as a " great self @-@ acceptance <unk> 
 Alex Hawgood from The New York Times wrote that at first listen the song came across as another generic dance hit . Hawgood however praised the song for its hidden subtext intended to be a response to gay suicides . Hawgood compared the song to the likes of Taylor Swift , Pink , Katy Perry and Lady Gaga , all of which " represent a new wave of young ( and mostly straight ) women who are providing the soundtrack for a generation of gay fans coming to terms with their identity in a time of turbulent and confusing cultural messages . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the track " infectious " and praised her honesty and sincerity on the track . Allmusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine chose " We R Who We R " as a highlight on Cannibal . The Phoenix ' Daniel Brockman felt that the song had a " lifting anthemic heft " while Spin 's Barry Walters said that with the song , " she sends out pride vibes to bullied gays . " Rolling Stone 's Will Hermes called the song " awesome . " Steven Hyden from The A.V. Club , in the album review of Cannibal , wrote that her " let ’ s get fucking fucked @-@ up " attitude on the track was a positive calling her " a complete and utter genius . " Hyden reviewed the song alongside fellow editor Genevieve Koski in a separate publication , giving the song a B and a D + , respectively . Hyden reiterated his comments from the album review in his review of the song , but added that the song was sonically similar to her previous singles " Tik Tok " and " Take It Off " , adding that on the song she " seems a little more self @-@ aware , imploring each and every one of us to start ' dancing like we ’ re dumb . ' " . On the opposite end up the spectrum , Koski was critical of the song , criticizing her vocals with his consensus being that " I want to give every Kesha song an ' F ' on principle , but objectively speaking , I know there are far worse songs out there , so let ’ s average out a subjective F and an objective C + to a D + . " 
 In a separate publishing from The New York Times , David Browne criticized the song 's overuse of processed vocals , writing that : " As heard on her current single ' We R Who We R ' from her new mini @-@ album , ' Cannibal , ' Kesha has a thin , often computer @-@ manipulated voice that recalls ’ 80s new @-@ wave pop acts . It ’ s often hard to tell when her singing voice ends and the Vocoder processing kicks in . " Rolling Stone gave the song two and a half stars out of five , referring to the combination of Kesha 's style and the song 's themes as an " awkward fit " . However , Rolling Stone later placed the song at number 50 in its Best 50 Singles of 2010 list .

Kesha explained the idea behind the video as well as the experience during an interview with MTV News ; she said that the video was different from her other videos , noting that it was going to show a sexier side of herself . 
 The music video for " We R Who We R " is presented as an underground party . The video starts off with futuristic flashing lights . Kesha , seen in a ponytail wearing gray and black makeup , chains , ripped stockings , and a sparkly one @-@ piece leotard made of shards of broken glass , walks through the 2nd Street Tunnel with fellow partygoers . The scene features drag races and explosions in the background . Close @-@ up shots of Kesha show her wearing studs in her eyebrows and her glittery eye makeup .

As the song 's hook kicks in , Kesha is seen standing on the edge of a building ; the music stops and Kesha stage jumps backwards off of the building 's rooftop . She is caught by the partygoers beneath her and the music resumes . The final scenes show Kesha dancing among fellow partygoers on a rooftop and smiling while singing " We R Who We R " . 
 Jocelyn Vena from MTV News noted that the video makes a departure from Kesha 's previous music videos , in which humor is usually present ; she wrote the video shows a " darker and sexier " side of the songstress . Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly was positive in his review of the video . Stransky commented on the song 's lyrical inspiration , noting the video does not follow the same message , saying " it doesn 't so much inspire self esteem as much as it inspires just a plain ol ' , trashy , [ Kesha ] -ed out good time . Code word : party ! " . The video was uploaded to her VEVO account on December 1 , 2010 .

 " We R Who We R " was performed for the first time on the second season of The X Factor Australia on November 14 , 2010 . Prior to the performance a minor controversy was sparked when Kesha 's male background dancers were seen wearing red armbands that had been supplied locally . Kesha was concerned they could be mistaken for a swastika symbol , so the armbands were removed . " We R Who We R " was performed live for the first time in North America on November 21 , 2010 , at the 2010 American Music Awards . The performance started off with Kesha opening with her previous single , " Take It Off " , while playing on the keyboard ; she soon transitioned into " We R Who We R " . For the performance she wore a mirrored body suit and a black leather jacket . Male background dancers surrounded the stage throughout the performance . Confetti fell from the ceiling during the song 's synth @-@ filled finale and as the performance ended , Kesha played riffs on a guitar . She then turned the guitar around , revealing the word " hate " in black writing with a slash through it . She then smashed the guitar into pieces , ending the performance . In 2011 , Kesha embarked on her first headlining tour , the Get Sleazy Tour , where she performed " We R Who We R " alongside a cover of Beastie Boys track " ( You Gotta ) Fight for Your Right ( To Party ! ) " , as a part of the concert 's encore . At the 2013 Kids ' Choice Awards , Kesha performed a segment of " We R Who We R " and " C 'Mon " .

 In 2010 , " We R Who We R " gained widespread support from the gay community . Dan Savage , the original creator of the " It Gets Better " campaign , which Kesha participated in , stated that she and other music artists that wrote songs addressed to the gay community were vital in helping fans come to terms with their sexualities and identities . " These songs are countering a hateful message that a peer , family member , politician or a bully might be saying , I get frustrated with gay politicos who discount or undermine the importance of pop stars , They ’ re a huge part of this fight . " Singers Josh Erdman and Ben Klute began posting cover versions of various songs on YouTube , later adding a logo to their videos originally titled " Legalize Gay " . They later stumbled upon Kesha 's song and upon doing so they changed their logo to " Legalize Gay ’ Cause We Are Who We Are " . The duo changed the logo to represent the song stating , " The lyrics obviously spoke to us , What these artists are doing means the world to the gay community . " In October 2011 , Kesha teamed up with the Human Rights Campaign and designed a unisex T @-@ shirt embroidered with purple zebra print – intended to represent " spirit " in the LGBT 's pride flag . The shirt 's design was titled with the writing " We R Who We R " and was made for that year 's National Coming Out Day .

The Mongols had looted and ravaged the Bulgarian population for decades , especially in the region of <unk> . The weakness of the state institutions was a result of the accelerating process of feudalisation of the Bulgarian Empire . 
 The peasants ' leader Ivaylo , said to had been a swineherd by the contemporary Byzantine chroniclers , proved to be a successful general and charismatic leader . In the first months of the rebellion , he defeated the Mongols and the Tsar 's armies , personally slaying Constantine Tikh in battle . Later , he made a triumphant entry in the capital Tarnovo , married Maria , the widow of the late emperor , and forced the nobility to recognize him as Emperor of Bulgaria . 
 The Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos tried to exploit this situation to his favour and intervened in Bulgaria . He sent Ivan Asen III , son of the former Emperor Mitso Asen , to claim the Bulgarian throne at the head of a large Byzantine army . Simultaneously , Michael VIII incited the Mongols to attack from the north , forcing Ivaylo to fight on two fronts . Ivaylo was defeated by the Mongols and besieged in important fortress of Drastar . In his absence the nobility in Tarnovo opened the gates to Ivan Asen III . However , Ivaylo managed to break the siege and Ivan Asen III fled back to the Byzantine Empire . Michael VIII sent two large armies in an attempt to turn the fortunes of the war , but they were both defeated by the Bulgarian rebels in the Balkan mountains . 
 In the meantime , the nobility in the capital had proclaimed as emperor one of their own , the magnate George Terter I. Surrounded by enemies and with diminishing support due to the constant warfare , Ivaylo fled to the court of the Mongol warlord Nogai Khan to seek aid , but was eventually murdered . The legacy of the rebellion endured both in Bulgaria and in Byzantium . Years after the demise of the peasant emperor , two " Pseudo @-@ <unk> " appeared in the Byzantine Empire and enjoyed wide support by the populace .

 = = = Political situation of Bulgaria = = = 
 Following the demise of Ivan Asen II ( r . 1218 – 1241 ) , the large Bulgarian Empire began to decline as a result of a succession of infant emperors and internal struggles among the nobility . To the north the country faced constant Mongol invasions after the 1240s . Although Ivan Asen II defeated the Mongols shortly before his death , the regency of Kaliman I Asen ( r . 1241 – 1246 ) agreed to pay an annual tribute to the Mongols to avoid devastation . The Mongol invasion led to the collapse of the loosely held Cuman confederation in the western part of the Eurasian Steppe and the foundation of the Mongol Golden Horde . This had long – term political and strategic consequences for Bulgaria — the Cumans were Bulgarian allies and often supplied the Bulgarian army with auxiliary cavalry while the Golden Horde proved to be a hostile entity . To the south , Bulgaria lost large portions of Thrace and Macedonia to the Nicaean Empire , which had escaped the initial Mongol attacks . The lands to the north @-@ west , including Belgrade , Braničevo and Severin Banat , were conquered by the Kingdom of Hungary . 
 In 1256 Bulgaria descended into a civil war between Mitso Asen ( r . 1256 – 1257 ) , a relative of Ivan Asen II , who established himself in south @-@ eastern Bulgaria , and the <unk> of Skopje Constantine Tikh ( r . 1257 – 1277 ) , who was proclaimed emperor by the nobility in Tarnovo . Simultaneously , the Hungarian noble of Rus ' princely origin Rostislav Mikhailovich established himself in Vidin as another claimant of the title Emperor of Bulgaria and was recognized as such by the Kingdom of Hungary . By 1261 Constantine Tikh had emerged as victor , but his 20 – year @-@ long reign did not bring stability to Bulgaria : Vidin remained separated from the central authorities in Tarnovo , the Mongols regularly campaigned in north @-@ eastern Bulgaria , looting the countryside and paralysing the economy . That same year Michael VIII Palaiologos ( r . 1259 – 1282 ) seized Constantinople and restored the Byzantine Empire as a major adversary of Bulgaria to the south . In the 1260s Constantine Tikh broke his leg in a hunting incident and was paralysed from the waist down . This disability weakened his control over the government and he fell under the influence of his second wife Irene Doukaina Laskarina , who was constantly involved in intrigues with her relatives in the Byzantine court . Later , he left the state affairs to his third wife , Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene — a scandalous intriguer whose actions to secure the succession of her son alienated the nobility . 
 = = = Internal situation and rise of Ivaylo = = = 
 The internal political development and feudalisation of Bulgaria in the 13th century resulted in a rising number of serfs , as well as an increase in the power of the landed nobility . This , in turn , led to aspirations for more self @-@ rule among the most influential nobles . Many of them established semi @-@ independent fiefdoms that nominally recognized the emperor in Tarnovo and greatly reduced the capacity of the central authorities to deal with external threats . In the second half of the 13th century , the peasantry was losing personal privileges to the benefit of the secular and religious feudal lords , which in turn reduced the peasants ' income and opportunities , worsening their lives . In parallel , the inability of Constantine Tikh to terminate the constant Mongol incursions in the north @-@ east of the country shattered the pillars of the state institutions in <unk> and contributed to the outbreak of the uprising and its swift success . The Mongol raids were carried out by the semi @-@ independent chief Nogai Khan , who was more powerful than the legitimate ruler of the Golden Horde , <unk> @-@ Timur ( r . 1266 – 1280 ) , and ruled over the steppes of modern Moldova and Ukraine . 
 In this situation one Ivaylo , a native of north @-@ eastern Bulgaria , most likely the area near Provadia , began to incite the population to revolt . He was called by the contemporary Byzantine chroniclers by the name <unk> ( lettuce ) or <unk> ( vegetable ) and his real name is known only from a note , attached to the <unk> gospel . The Byzantine historian George Pachymeres stated that he was a swineherd who took care of pigs for money . However , the historian John Fine notes that pigs were a major livestock product at the time and the possessor of a large herd could have been part of the elite of the local community . Ivaylo claimed that he had visions from God to lead the people and that he was in contact with heaven and the saints . In fact , his mysticism was deliberately used to swiftly gain support and followers among the religious villagers . He came to be seen by many Bulgarians as a God @-@ given saviour . 
 = = Course of the rebellion = = 
 = = = Initial victories = = = 
 The rebellion broke out in the spring or summer of 1277 in north @-@ eastern Bulgaria where the Mongol devastation was strongest . In the summer of 1277 Ivaylo confronted and defeated a plundering Mongol unit . Another victory followed soon and by autumn all Mongols were driven out of Bulgarian territory . Having achieved what had eluded the Bulgarian arms for decades , his popularity and reputation rose quickly . Among his followers were an increasing number of nobles who were discontent with the intrigues of Empress Maria . Ivaylo was hailed as Emperor by the people and many regions came under his control . 
 In the end of 1277 Constantine Tikh finally took measures to confront the rebels . He gathered a small army and advanced slowly as he had to travel in a chariot because of his injury . Ivaylo attacked and defeated this force , killing many of the emperor 's close associates , while the rest of the army joined the rebels . Ivaylo personally slew Constantine Tikh , claiming that the emperor did nothing to keep his honour in the battle . After his triumph , Ivaylo began to seize the country 's fortified cities , which surrendered and recognized him as emperor one by one . By the spring of 1278 only the capital Tarnovo remained under the control of Empress Maria . 
 = = = Byzantine intervention and recognition of Ivaylo = = = 
 Meanwhile , the Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos left Constantinople for Adrianople , situated close to the Byzantine – Bulgarian border , in order to monitor the events and to exploit the situation in Bulgaria in his favour . The demise of Constantine Tikh came as a shock for the Byzantines . Initially , Michael VIII considered marring his daughter to Ivaylo , but eventually decided that it would be more favourable to install a protégé of his own . His candidate was Ivan , son of former Emperor Mitso Asen , who had sought asylum in Byzantium and possessed estates in Asia Minor . Ivan promptly married Michael VIII 's daughter Irene , pledged allegiance to Michael VIII and was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria as Ivan Asen III . The Byzantines sent gifts to the Bulgarian nobles to incite them to support Ivan Asen III and envoys were dispatched to Tarnovo to arrange for his recognition and the surrender of Empress Maria . In the meantime , Ivan Asen III marched north at the head of a Byzantine army while Ivaylo was besieging Tarnovo . 
 Faced with two adversaries , Maria initially tried to negotiate with Michael VIII the succession of her son Michael Asen but the Byzantine emperor insisted on an unconditional surrender . Much to the surprise of the Byzantines , Maria then entered in negotiations with Ivaylo and offered him her hand and the Bulgarian crown on the condition that he would guarantee the rights of Michael Asen as his sole successor . Contemporary chronicler George Pachymeres accuses Maria of " ignoring the moral duty to her late husband " but in fact her decision was driven by her hatred towards her uncle Michael VIII , whom she considered a heretic , as well as by her desire to hang on to power . At first , Ivaylo was reluctant to accept the proposal claiming that Maria was offering what he was about to take by force but eventually conceded " because of the peace and to avoid bloodshed in a civil war " . However , Ivaylo made it clear that he was the one giving clemency , not the one receiving it . 
 In the spring of 1278 Ivaylo entered Tarnovo in triumph , married Maria and was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria . However , since he was inexperienced in state affairs , Ivaylo failed to consolidate his authority over the nobility in the capital , who were concerned for their own influence , and often quarrelled with Maria . He still had to deal with overwhelming challenges — the Byzantines dispatched many troops under the command of Michael Glabas in support of Ivan Asen III and incited the Mongols to attack from the north to open war on two fronts . Yet Ivaylo vigorously prepared his forces to counter the adversaries and managed to gain support among many nobles . 
 = = = Campaigns against Byzantines and Mongols = = = 
 Ivaylo left Tarnovo in the summer of 1278 , marched northwards and defeated the Mongols , pushing them across the Danube river . The situation to the south was more dangerous . The Byzantines launched an attack on a wide front along the Balkan Mountains from the Shipka Pass to the Black Sea . They failed to cross the mountains as the defenders held on until the Mongols were defeated and reinforcement could be sent . Despite the huge efforts and numerical superiority the Byzantines made few gains at very high cost . For instance , the fortress of <unk> was seized after many assaults , the castles of Kran and <unk> fell with heavy casualties for the invaders . The Bulgarian commander Stan fell valiantly during the defence of <unk> and many other of Ivaylo 's associates distinguished themselves in the war — Momchil , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . All battles led personally by Ivaylo were successful — he fought at Studena and <unk> — and by the autumn of 1278 the Bulgarians gained the upper hand forcing the Byzantines to abandon the campaign . The Byzantine morale was very low because Ivaylo gave no quarter . George Pachymeres wrote that " to fall in the hands of <unk> [ Ivaylo ] was equivalent to death " . 
 With the situation to the south under control , Ivaylo had to confront a second Mongol attack to the north . This time the Bulgarians faced the elite forces of Nogai Khan . The Mongols prevailed and Ivaylo was besieged in the important city of Drastar on the southern bank of Danube , where he withstood a three @-@ month siege . While bulk of the rebel army was engaged to the north , Michael VIII started negotiations with the nobility of Tarnovo and convinced the local dignitaries to recognize the claim of Ivan Asen III . In the beginning of 1279 , a Byzantine army under Michael Glabas disembarked near Varna and set off to the capital , supported by a Mongol unit commanded by Kasim beg . The elite of Tarnovo spread rumours that Ivaylo had perished fighting the Mongols and opened the gates to the Byzantines and their protégé . Ivan Asen III was proclaimed emperor and Maria , who at the time bore Ivaylo 's child , was exiled to Constantinople . To consolidate the support of the nobility , the new monarch married his sister Kira Maria to George Terter , one of Bulgaria 's most powerful and influential feudal lords , whose estates were centred at <unk> . Kasim beg , who had been awarded the high court title protostrator , felt that the rise of George Terter was at his expense , deserted Ivan Asen III and joined the cause of Ivaylo . 
 In the meantime fighting between the rebels and the Byzantines continued . Although the Bulgarian forces were cut in two following the Byzantine landing at Varna , heavy clashes erupted in the eastern Balkan mountains with new vigour , especially around the Kotel Pass and the <unk> Pass . The Bulgarian positions there were surrounded both from the north and the south . The Byzantines had to besiege and take the fortresses one by one which cost time and casualties . Many strongholds remained unconquered and permanently engaged large Byzantine forces . 
 In the spring of 1279 , Ivaylo managed to break through the Mongol blockade at Drastar and besieged Tarnovo . This advance took Ivan Asen III and his supporters by surprise . Michael VIII took measures to protect his protégé and in the summer of 1279 sent a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ strong army under the command of the protovestiarios Murin . Ivaylo did not linger in Tarnovo and engaged the invading host on 17 June 1279 in the Kotel Pass . Despite being outnumbered , in the ensuing battle near the fortress of Devina the Bulgarians achieved a complete victory . Part of the Byzantines perished in the battle along with their commander , the rest were captured and killed by orders of Ivaylo . A month later , the Byzantines sent another army of 5 @,@ 000 troops led by the protovestiarios <unk> . Ivaylo engaged them in the eastern Balkan Mountains on 15 August 1279 and after a long combat defeated the Byzantines , personally killing <unk> in the process . Ivaylo was said to had " fought with fury , achieving many feats " in both battles . 
 = = = End of the rebellion and demise of Ivaylo = = = 
 With the Byzantines defeated , the authority of Ivan Asen III was shaken . He and his wife Irene secretly fled Tarnovo taking the Byzantine imperial insignia , kept in the treasury since the Bulgarian victory in the battle of <unk> in 1190 . Michael VIII was infuriated with the <unk> of the couple and refused to grant them an audience for days . In Tarnovo , the nobility refused to open the gates to Ivaylo and instead elected for emperor George Terter , which had devastating effect on the rebels . Despite the military successes , neither was the Mongol threat dealt with , nor was Ivaylo capable to secure the support of the Bulgarian nobility and unify the country against the overwhelming forces of the Mongols and the Byzantines . As a result , Ivaylo 's followers , disillusioned with the endless wars without prospects for peace , began to abandon his cause . With diminished support , in 1280 Ivaylo crossed the Danube with a few loyal associates , including Kasim beg , to seek aid from Nogai Khan . 
 Initially , Ivaylo was received well by Nogai Khan . When news of his whereabouts reached Constantinople , Michael VIII sent Ivan Asen III with rich gifts to the Mongol court to ask assistance . Nogai Khan expressed interest in the issue and for several months kept promising help to both pretenders . Eventually the Byzantine influence prevailed because the Mongol leader was married to the illegitimate daughter of Michael VIII , Euphrosyne Palaiologina . During a feast , in which Ivaylo and Ivan Asen III seated on both sides of Nogai Khan , he pointed at Ivaylo with the words " He is an enemy of my father , the Emperor [ Michael VIII ] , and does not deserve to live " and ordered his execution . Ivaylo , along with Kasim beg , were duly murdered on the spot . Ivan Asen III was fortunate to avoid similar fate due to the advocacy of Euphrosyne and eventually returned to his estates in Asia Minor , where he died in 1303 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Ivaylo 's legacy enjoyed huge popularity beyond the borders of Bulgaria years after his death . At least two " Pseudo @-@ <unk> " appeared in the Byzantine Empire . In 1284 a Bulgarian who claimed to had been Ivaylo , arrived in Constantinople and offered his services to Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos to fight against the Turks . Andronikos II asked the ex @-@ empress Maria to verify if the man was her husband and she exposed him as an imposter . Pseudo @-@ Ivaylo was detained but the populace demanded his release since the Turks " feared the barbarian [ Ivaylo ] " . The Byzantine emperor calculated that there was nothing to lose and allowed him to march against the Turks . " Ivaylo " gathered a huge army of peasants , much to the concern of the Byzantine nobility who feared a revolt or coup . The emperor then summoned Pseudo @-@ Ivaylo under some pretext and had him imprisoned . A few years later another Bulgarian ( whose real name was Ivan ) appeared in the Byzantine Empire claiming he was Ivaylo . He was given an army to combat the Turks but after a few victories he was captured and killed . 
 In Bulgaria , the two decades following the end of the rebellion marked the lowest point of decline of the Second Empire . The reigns of George Terter I ( r . 1280 – 1292 ) and his successor Smilets ( r . 1292 – 1298 ) were characterised with constant Mongol interference in the state 's domestic affairs and progressive disintegration of Imperial authority in favour of the feudal magnates . Bulgaria had lost almost all lands to the south of the Balkan mountains to the Byzantines and was in no position to regain these regions . The fortunes of the country changed for the better under George Terter I 's son , <unk> Svetoslav ( r . 1300 – 1321 ) , when Bulgaria acquired Bessarabia from the Mongols and reconquered Northern Thrace from the Byzantines , bringing stability and prosperity . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The rebellion failed because the rebels had to fight against overwhelming odds — not only the Byzantines and the Mongols , but also much of the Bulgarian nobility . Although ultimately unsuccessful , the uprising of Ivaylo had achieved a recognition of its leader as emperor , an aim in which all other popular revolts in medieval Europe failed . In Socialist Bulgaria the rebellion was portrayed as a social movement against the iniquity of the feudal system and the foreign invaders . In modern Bulgaria Ivaylo is still revered as a fighter for freedom and social justice . However , there is no evidence that Ivaylo and his followers ever intended to conduct social reforms . The fact that the rebellion was supported by some nobles and that Ivaylo married the hated Empress Maria also indicates that the main factor was the incompetent rule of Emperor Constantine Tikh . The Bulgarian historians praise the heroism of the rebels and evaluate the uprising as a bright patriotic achievement of the Bulgarian people because Ivaylo was able to gather wide support from all social classes of Bulgaria to defend the then @-@ troubled country against the external enemies . Ivaylo is remembered as a heroic ruler and a tragic figure who represented the ideal of the " Good Tsar " . 
 The rebellion of Ivaylo is among the most popular and recognizable Bulgarian historical events with numerous pieces of art dedicated to it . The 1959 opera " Ivaylo " by the composer Marin <unk> , based on the overture of the same name by <unk> <unk> , was inspired by the " revolutionary pathos and tragedy of the epoch " . Dedicated to the uprising are also the 1964 colour feature film " Ivaylo " by the director Nikola <unk> , based on the novel " The <unk> Ember " by Evgeni Konstantinov , and the 1921 drama " The Throne " by the prominent Bulgarian poet and writer Ivan Vazov . The town of <unk> in modern southern Bulgaria and the village of Ivaylo near the city of Pazardzhik are named after the rebel leader . There are statues in several cities dedicated to him , as well as a monument commemorating the victory over the Byzantines in the battle of Devina , situated at 5 km to the south @-@ east of the town of Kotel . That memorial , named " The Stone Guard " , was listed in the top ten emblematic monuments on the history of Bulgaria .

 The second season was made available in its entirety on February 14 , 2014 ( Valentine 's Day ) at 12 : 01 a.m. PT . Prior to the release of season 1 , three reviewers , Hank Stuever of The Washington Post , Nancy deWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal , and Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times , commented on possible binge viewing by Netflix customers . Stanley notes that the show " is probably seen best one episode at a time . It 's a delicious immorality play with an excellent cast , but the tempo is slow and oddly ponderous — a romp slowed down to a dirge " . Smith also notes that due to its " relentless theme " , " House of Cards might go down better in smaller portions and thus be enjoyably prolonged " , deriding potential binge watchers as people who liken a delicacy to a " bag of M & M 's " . However , Stuever disagreed about season 1 saying " So , on the iffy chance that House of Cards draws you in and you simply cannot stop watching , then , yes , you may power @-@ binge your way through all 13 hours at once " .

 In interviews during the writing and filming of season 2 showrunner Beau Willimon said he had drawn inspiration for the series from a variety of sources including Robert Caro 's The Years of Lyndon Johnson and Jeremy Larner 's Nobody Knows . Lyndon B. Johnson was a repeated source for themes and issues . Willimon also commented on the fictional world of politics that the show represented : " It 's a rough @-@ and @-@ tumble game whenever power is involved — people 's ambitions , their desires , their competitive spirit will often push them to play outside the rules . " Willimon noted that " I don 't think about topping things ... The evolution of character is not a game of one @-@ upmanship . It is about change . Souls are vast and so the opportunity to explore ways in which characters contradict themselves and evolve is also vast " and that season 2 provided the opportunity " to expand the world and more deeply explore the characters " . 
 Spacey viewed continuing to portray Underwood for a second season as a continuing learning process . " There is so much I don 't know about Francis , so much that I 'm learning ... I 've always thought that the profession closest to that of an actor is being a detective ... We are given clues by writers , sometimes clues they 're aware of and sometimes not . Then you lay them all out and try to make them come alive as a character who 's complex and surprising , maybe even to yourself " . Gerald McRaney spoke about his expanded role by saying that whereas in season 1 the challenge to playing his character , Raymond Tusk , was in " having to learn Mandarin " , in season 2 his character has become " somebody who you don 't know which color hat he 's wearing " . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Netflix had ordered two seasons of 13 episodes when it made its original commitment to the series in 2011 . According to Governor of Maryland Martin O 'Malley , production of the first season brought $ 140 million in the form of 2 @,@ 200 jobs and transactions with 1 @,@ 800 vendors to the Baltimore metropolitan area economy and the Maryland General Assembly expanded its Film Production Tax Credit so that season two could have similar impact over the course of 150 days of filming . Like the first season , the second season was largely filmed in the Baltimore area . Although production was publicized as being in Baltimore , Season 1 had based production in Harford County , Maryland , and season 2 also had its production office in Edgewood and a Joppa sound stage . The April 27 , 2013 White House Correspondents Dinner spoofed House of Cards from the Maryland set prior to the beginning of the filming of season 2 . Filming began on Monday April 29 , 2013 , which was just a few weeks later in the year than season 1 had started . On May 14 , O 'Malley visited the set to publicize the success of the tax incentives . 
 During spring and summer 2013 , the show hosted several large casting calls some of which had over 1000 hopefuls . On June 13 , crews began preparing the State House for filming on June 17 and 18 . The Maryland State House is not available for rent so the producers made donations to various organizations . The show filmed in Annapolis at the Maryland House of Delegates and the wife of House Speaker Michael E. Busch , Cynthia , was cast as an extra . She played a United States Senator as the set depicted the United States Senate chamber . The scenes were used as part of " Chapter 16 " ( season 2 , episode 3 ) . On July 24 , the show announced that it would film at the Baltimore County Circuit <unk> in Towson , Maryland on July 31 . The filming occurred at this location on August 7 . 
 On August 3 , House of Cards was going to film a presidential motorcade at the National Mall in Washington , D.C. at 3 PM . However , Chief of police Cathy L. Lanier of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia ( MPD ) revoked the permits that morning . An MPD spokesperson explained " The Metropolitan Police Department is not the lead agency on presidential motorcades and we did not want to portray ourselves as such " . As a result , the production crews did a last minute filming of the desired scenes back in Baltimore . The next day , Mayor of the District of Columbia Vincent Gray stated that there was confusion on what role the MPD would play in the filming . A spokesperson from his office stated that " " MPD is not going to rent itself out as extras for film ... That 's what MPD 's decision was focused on . We 're not going to be actors . " On October 2 , all issues were resolved and the motorcade was filmed as originally planned without any MPD personnel " actively participate in the filming " . 
 In August , several areas in Harford County were used for filming season 2 , including areas in Bel Air and Edgewood . Havre de Grace had been used in season 1 to depict Underwood 's home district in South Carolina . The Liriodendron mansion was the scene of filming on August 12 and 13 . Bel Air police were paid $ 1550 for August 13 duties at another filming location . 
 Although there were reports that the filming was largely completed by October 1 , Willimon tweeted on that date that he had just finished writing the season finale . Willimon and others tweeted that filming was completed on November 8 . The following week , House of Cards workers got involved in the Typhoon Haiyan relief efforts . 
 According to an October 10 story in The Huffington Post , executive producer Rick Cleveland stated that he believed that season 2 would be the final season because both Spacey and Wright prefer to act in movies than in television . However , Willimon remained optimistic that the show will continue . The Baltimore Sun reporter , David Zurawik contested the journalistic process of The Huffington Post report because he says Modi <unk> , CEO of Media Rights Capital , the company that produces House of Cards , told him " I would basically be shocked if there wasn 't [ a season 3 , 4 and 5 ] " . A few weeks later , Netflix 's Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos confirmed that Netflix had an earnest interest in continuing House of Cards beyond its second season .

I didn 't want to paint ourselves into a corner in the second season . " On February 4 , 2014 , Netflix announced it had renewed the web series for a season 3 of undisclosed length . In May 2014 , the season became one of the first Netflix streaming offerings available in 4K video format .

 The season was generally well received . The review aggregator Metacritic gave the season a score of 80 out of 100 , based on 25 critics . Another review aggregator , Rotten Tomatoes gave the season a rating of 85 % , based on 34 reviews , with an average rating of 8 @.@ 2 / 10 . The site 's critical consensus reads , " House of Cards proves just as <unk> in its second season , with more of the strong performances , writing , and visual design that made the first season so addictive . " 
 James Poniewozik of Time says " It is the same show you saw last season , the same weaknesses and strengths intact , but , as it makes clear before the first hour is over , every bit as brutal and sanguinary . " According to Sara Smith of The Kansas City Star , " The shock and delight of the showy storytelling ... has faded a bit " . Smith says that Barnes , Skorsky , and Goodwin 's " investigation sucks them down a rabbit hole into a surreal underworld no sane reporter would explore " . Regarding Frank , Smith says " A show can successfully revolve around one man , but a flawless winning streak gets monotonous " and that " it 's time for someone to take Frank down a notch " . 
 Willmore says that since characters have been introduced , " season two of House of Cards begins in a fashion that 's far more free and quick @-@ paced " than season 1 . Willmore also notes that , " If season one slowly grew blacker in tone as it went from serious games of power and manipulation to life @-@ and @-@ death ones , season two starts off there and looks to only get darker in content . " However , she stated that season 2 appeared to be lighter than season 1 : " delivered with more of a wink by Frank than before . It may be darker , but it 's also less heavy " . 
 Stanley praises the series saying " It 's not clear exactly why this bleak series is so exhilarating and binge @-@ worthy . It could be that just as victims of tragedy find it hard to accept that their suffering is random and purposeless , voters find it intolerable that so many of the petty , shortsighted moves by elected officials have no greater meaning than small @-@ time expediency . " She also notes that the series " is more cynical than The Americans on FX and more pessimistic about human nature than The Walking Dead on AMC " . However , The Americans " is more complex and inventive " according to Stanley who concurs that season 2 is darker but notes it is more compelling than season 1 . Stuever compares the show unfavorably to both Veep for its " bumbling chaos and ego implosions " over House of Cards " prohibitively sinister " execution and The Good Wife for its superior delivery of " nastiness and self @-@ interest in power plays " . 
 Many critics criticized the lack of reasonable challenge for the Underwoods . James Poniewozik notes that " Francis needs a stronger nemesis , if not for the sake of justice then for the sake of excitement . And House of Cards would be a greater show if it had characters who were people more than game pieces . Still , on its limited terms , it 's absorbing to watch " . According to Entertainment Weekly 's Karen Valby , the show 's fundamental problem is that " The Underwoods have no worthy opponents . " According to Variety 's Brian Lowry , as conniving as Underwood is , it is unfathomable that " nobody else in a town built on power seems particularly adept at recognizing this or combating him " . Valby notes that neither Tusk nor Goodwin is an effective foe , leaving the audience longing for a comeuppance in the first four episodes that served as a preview for critics and his hopeful that Sharp provides a good foil as the season progresses . He also wrote that House of Cards overplays its depiction of the edginess of " Washington being venal and corrupt " . He describes the show as a " mixed bag " . 
 Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter describes the preview of the season by saying " It 's entertaining and cruises along with a strong pulse . There 's a core mystery and American politics is mocked , appropriately , for being a two @-@ party hustle of recrimination and separatism . " Goodman notes that writer Beau Willimon has Frank " pontificate to the point of spouting cliches from time to time " and Frank 's " conniving wins too often " . Goodman sums things up by saying " There 's a heavier hand than is necessary at times " and " House of Cards needs to stay more focused to be successful . " 
 Chuck Barney of the San Jose Mercury News had a more mixed response , noting that the preview episodes show that the series is as " handsomely crafted and marvelously acted as ever " but the episodes don 't " provoke the same kind of adrenaline rush as last season " . Barney was also impressed with newcomer Parker : " She 's an agile actress who can deliver a sense of soft @-@ spoken warmth but also a steely fierceness that comes with an underlying message : ' <unk> me at your own peril . ' " 
 The addition of Parker was well received among critics . Stanley notes that as Underwood 's " protégée and , like everyone else in his poisoned orbit , soon discovers that Underwood expects his people to cast aside principle and pursue his grand plan . " Valby describes her performance as one " played with throbbing edge " . Goodman notes she serves to somewhat counterbalance Frank . 
 Verne Gay of Newsday notes that " Spacey 's Underwood is even more sinuous , more complex , more treacherous and so — as a result — is the deeply pleasurable show that surrounds him . "

 U.S. President Barack Obama quipped about his interest in an advance copy of the second series : " I wish things were that ruthlessly efficient ... It 's true . I was looking at Kevin Spacey thinking , ' this guy 's getting a lot of stuff done ' . " The evening before the season was posted , someone responsible for the @ <unk> Twitter account ( which is run by Organizing for Action ) tweeted a request that no spoilers be posted online . Since the season debuted on Valentine 's Day , The New York Observer created themed cards in honor of the series with quotes such as " A great man once said everything is about sex . Except sex . Sex is about power " ( an Oscar Wilde quote Underwood had stated during season 1 ) . 
 Whereas less than 2 % of Netflix subscribers streamed season 1 during the first weekend last year , over 15 % streamed at least one hour during the business day on February 14 .

 = Dacre Castle = 
 Dacre Castle is a moated tower house in the village of Dacre , 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) south @-@ west of Penrith , Cumbria . It was constructed in the mid @-@ 14th century , probably by Margaret Multon , against the background of the threat of Scottish invasion and raids , and was held in the Dacre family until the 17th century . The tower house is 66 feet ( 20 m ) tall , built out of local sandstone , topped by crenellations , with four turrets protruding from a central block , and includes an ornate <unk> in the main hall . Renovated during the 1670s and 1960s after periods of disrepair , the castle is now used as a private home . 
 = = History = = 
 Dacre Castle was probably built by Margaret Multon , the wife of Ralph Dacre , in the middle of the 14th century . The Dacre family had risen in prominence in Cumbria during the 12th and early 13th centuries , and William Dacre , Ralph 's father , had acquired a licence to crenellate the property of <unk> in 1307 , quite close to the future site of Dacre Castle . Ralph married Margaret in 1317 , becoming extremely wealth as a result , and received permission to found <unk> Castle in 1335 . Margaret built Dacre Castle at some point between Ralph 's death in 1339 and 1354 , with the intention of creating a fortified home . Many tower houses were built across the region during the period in response to the threat of Scottish raids and invasions . There may have been an older building already on the site , possibly moated , but this is uncertain . 
 After Margaret 's death , the castle continued to be owned by the Dacre family until the death of Randal Dacre in 1634 , when it passed briefly to the Crown . By 1675 the castle had become derelict and was restored by the then Lord Dacre , Thomas Lennard . A new entrance to the castle was constructed and square , 17th @-@ century windows installed . After Thomas 's death in 1715 the castle was sold to Edward Hassell . The condition of the castle deteriorated again in the 18th century , becoming overgrown and dilapidated , and by the 19th century the Hassell family were using it as a farmhouse . 
 In 1961 , the castle was leased for 22 years by Anthony and Bunty Kinsman , at a cost of £ 1 @,@ 000 . The property required extensive structural repairs and renovations in order to be made habitable , which the <unk> undertook over the next two years . The construction work cost £ 8 @,@ 596 , and some financial support was provided by the Ministry of Works in exchange for the castle being opened to the public for the next fifteen years . The new oak doors in the castle were fitted with iron hinges that had originally been used in nearby Lowther Castle . In 1967 , the castle was visited by Princess Sharada Shah , the daughter of the King Mahendra of Nepal , as part of an official trip to the UK . 
 In the 21st century the castle is owned by the Hassell @-@ McCosh family and is rented out as a private home . It is protected under UK law as a grade I listed building . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Dacre Castle lies in a valley , overlooking a stream and fields . It comprises a tower house surrounded by a three @-@ sided moat , creating an enclosed courtyard to the east 73 metres ( 240 ft ) by 55 metres ( 180 ft ) across . The moat is between 9 metres ( 30 ft ) to 15 metres ( 49 ft ) wide and up to 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 15 ft ) deep , with a protective bank on the south and west sides ; originally a wall would have surrounded the outside of the courtyard . The courtyard originally held various buildings , possibly stables and offices , but the tower house was designed to operate independently , without the need for attached facilities . Architecturally , the design of Dacre resembles Harewood and Langley Castles . 
 The tower house is in the north @-@ east corner of the enclosure and takes the form of a square , central block , with two large turrets on one side and two smaller turrets resembling angular buttresses on the other . It is made of large blocks of local sandstone and the roof is crenellated . The central block is 36 feet ( 11 m ) by 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) inside , and is 66 feet ( 20 m ) tall , with 8 @.@ 5 feet ( 2 @.@ 6 m ) thick walls . The building was originally entered through the south @-@ west turret on the ground @-@ floor , but since the 17th century the entrance way has been directly into the central block up an exterior staircase . 
 The ground floor of the central block contains two vaulted chambers and the first @-@ floor forms a hall containing an ornate <unk> , with smaller chambers in the turrets . The second floor similarly forms a single large chamber , 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) high , with rooms in each of the adjacent turrets , and is traditionally called the " Room of the Three Kings " , after the legend described by William of Malmesbury . In the 14th century , these large chambers would have been subdivided into smaller rooms . The renovations in the 1960s uncovered a possible priest hole behind the fireplace in the Room of the Three Kings , 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) by 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) ; this chamber was re @-@ sealed to avoid the cost of restoring it . 
 = Nabulsi soap = 
 Nabulsi soap ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) is a type of <unk> soap produced only in Nablus in the West Bank , Palestine . Its chief ingredients are virgin olive oil ( the main agricultural product of the region ) , water , and an alkaline sodium compound . The finished product is ivory @-@ colored and has almost no scent . Traditionally made by women for household use , it had become a significant industry for Nablus by the 14th century . In 1907 the city 's 30 Nabulsi soap factories were supplying half the soap in Palestine . The industry declined during the mid @-@ 20th century following destruction caused by the 1927 earthquake and later disruption from the Israeli military occupation . As of 2008 , only two soap factories survive in Nablus . The old Arafat soap factory has been turned into a Cultural Heritage Enrichment Center . 
 = = History = = 
 Nabulsi soap was traditionally made by women for household use even before the 10th century when small soap @-@ making factories had appeared . Trade with Bedouins was indispensable for soap @-@ making , both in Nablus and Hebron , since they alone could furnish the <unk> soda ( qilw ) required by the process . By the 14th century a significant soap @-@ making industry had developed in Nablus and the soap , reputedly prized by Queen Elizabeth I of England , was exported throughout the Middle East and to Europe . 
 The 19th century saw a major expansion of soap manufacturing in Nablus , which became the center of soap production throughout the Fertile Crescent . By 1907 , the city 's 30 factories were producing nearly 5 @,@ 000 tons of Nabulsi soap annually , over half of all soap production in Palestine . John Bowring wrote of Nabulsi soap in the 1830s that it is , " highly esteemed in the Levant , " and Muhammad Kurd Ali , a Syrian historian , wrote in the 1930s that " Nablus soap is the best and most famous soap today for it has , it seems , a quality not found in others and the secret is that it is unadulterated and well produced . " 
 The soap industry in Nablus began to decline in the mid @-@ 20th century , caused in part by natural disasters , especially a 1927 earthquake which destroyed much of the Old City of Nablus , and in part by Israeli military occupation . Israeli military raids during the Second Intifada destroyed several soap factories in the historic quarter of Nablus . Only two soap factories survive in Nablus , and they face continuing problems both in terms of the soap 's manufacture and its export . The General Manager of the factory owned by the <unk> family commented in 2008 : 
 " Before 2000 , our factory used to produce 600 tons of soap annually . Due to the physical and economic obstacles we face now because of the Israeli occupation – and especially the checkpoints – we produce barely half that amount today . " 
 According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs , the checkpoints and road blocks set up throughout the West Bank have created problems in the transportation of supplies and material to and from the factories as well as making it difficult for workers to get from their homes to the factories . However , Nabulsi soap is still widely sold in Nablus and the West Bank . It is also exported to Jordan , Kuwait , and Arab @-@ Israeli cities such as Nazareth . 
 Considered an important aspect of Nablus 's cultural heritage , the preservation of the Nabulsi soap @-@ making industry has been the focus of several local projects , including the restoration and conversion of the old Arafat soap factory into a Cultural Heritage Enrichment Center . The center has research and exhibition facilities and includes a small model soap factory which makes Nabulsi soap using traditional methods . Project Hope and other local non @-@ governmental organizations market the soap in the West to raise funds for their other community projects . 
 = = Production process = = 
 Like Castile soap , the chief ingredients of Nabulsi soap are virgin olive oil , water , and an alkaline sodium compound . The compound is made by mixing the powdered ashes of the barilla plant ( qilw ) which grows along the banks of the River Jordan with locally supplied lime ( <unk> ) . The sodium compound is then is heated with water and the olive oil in large copper vats over fermentation pits . The solution of water and the sodium compound becomes increasingly concentrated in a series of 40 cycles repeated over eight days . During that time , an oar @-@ shaped wooden tool known as a <unk> is used to stir the liquid soap continuously . The liquid soap is then spread in wooden frames to set . After setting , it is cut into the classic cube shape of Nabulsi soap and stamped with the company 's trademark seal . The soap cubes then undergo a drying process which can last from three months to a year and involves stacking them in ceiling @-@ high structures resembling cones with hollow centers which allow the air to circulate around the cubes . 
 The finished product is ivory @-@ colored and has almost no scent . ( Perfumes are never used in Nabulsi soap . ) Before leaving the factory , the individual cubes which are to be sold locally are wrapped by hand in paper which is waxed on one side . Cubes which are destined for export are left unwrapped and usually dispatched in stiff sacks to protect them from damage .

Runnels formed a tag team with Shawn Spears in mid @-@ August 2006 and they quickly became embroiled in a feud with The Untouchables over the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship . They first captured the championship from The Untouchables on October 18 . In November 2006 , Runnels and Spears defeated The Untouchables in a tag team match , and won the services of Cherry , The Untouchables ' manager . Cherry accompanied Spears and Runnels to ringside , and soon Spears began to fall in love with her , which began interfering with their matches . On November 29 , the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship was vacated after a match between The Untouchables and Runnels and Spears ended in a draw . The following week , a rematch between the two teams was held for the vacant championship . During this match Cherry turned on Spears and Runnels , rejoining The Untouchables and helping them regain the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship . Two weeks later , on December 20 , Runnels and Spears defeated Deuce ' n Domino in a Street Fight to win the championship for the second time . Shortly afterwards , Runnels and Spears became involved in a scripted rivalry with each other , after Spears became jealous of Runnels ' success as a singles wrestler . This rift started when Runnels won the OVW Heavyweight Championship from Paul Burchill at a house show on February 17 , 2007 , only to lose it to Burchill the next day . Spears went on to win the OVW Television Championship in response . On April 11 , the duo lost the Southern Tag Team Championship to the team of Justin LaRouche and Charles Evans . Runnels went on to defeat his now heated rival on July 6 , to become the new OVW Television Champion . Exactly one week later , however , Runnels lost the championship to Spears .

 On the July 2 , 2007 edition of Raw , Runnels made his television debut , using the ring name Cody Rhodes , in a backstage segment with his father Dusty Rhodes and Randy Orton , where Orton introduced himself to Rhodes and then slapped Dusty as a sign of disrespect . On July 9 , Rhodes slapped Orton in return , and the following week , Rhodes faced Orton in his debut WWE match , but lost . Rhodes appeared at The Great American Bash to prevent Orton from further attacking his father . The next night on Raw , Rhodes challenged Orton to a rematch from the previous week , only to lose again . Orton followed this up by kicking Rhodes ' father in the head , similar to how he had in storyline nearly ended the careers of both Shawn Michaels and Rob Van Dam . Rhodes ' next storyline was a rivalry with Daivari , after he pinned him on the July 30 , 2007 edition of Raw , to keep his job . In the midst of this rivalry , he also feuded with The World 's Greatest Tag Team , defeating both members , Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin in singles matches . The two feuds combined , when Rhodes , along with Paul London and Brian Kendrick , beat The World 's Greatest Tag Team and Daivari in a six @-@ man tag team match . The following week , Rhodes teamed up with Mickie James to defeat Daivari and Jillian Hall , ending their scripted rivalry . Three weeks later , he began a feud with Hardcore Holly and lost three consecutive matches to him . Rhodes eventually earned Holly 's respect , impressing Holly during their matches with his persistence and several near @-@ falls , and the two formed a tag team . They earned a shot at the World Tag Team Title by defeating Paul London and Brian Kendrick and The Highlanders in a WWE.com exclusive match after an Alabama Slam . They fought against the Tag Team Champions Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch at Survivor Series , in what was Rhodes ' first on @-@ screen title shot and pay @-@ per @-@ view match , but were unsuccessful . On the November 19 Raw , Rhodes faced Holly for a fourth time , and beat him for the first time , although they were both attacked by Randy Orton afterwards . On the Raw 15th Anniversary special episode that aired on December 10 , 2007 , Rhodes , along with Hardcore Holly , defeated Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch for the World Tag Team Championship , marking Rhodes ' first championship in WWE . The following week , Rhodes and Holly retained their title , in their first title defense , against Cade and Murdoch . They also successfully defended the championships against the teams of Santino Marella and Carlito and Paul London and Brian Kendrick . In May 2008 , Ted DiBiase began feuding with the duo , threatening to take their titles in his first match as part of the Raw brand . At the pay @-@ per @-@ view event , Night of Champions on June 29 , Rhodes turned on Holly by revealing himself as Ted DiBiase 's partner to help DiBiase win the match , becoming a villain for the first time in his career and also a two @-@ time World Tag Team Champion .

Rhodes and DiBiase were joined by Manu , the son of Afa , in September , forming a stable of multi @-@ generational superstars . On the October 27 , 2008 edition of Raw , Rhodes and DiBiase lost the World Tag Team Championship once again , this time to Kofi Kingston and CM Punk . On the November 3 , 2008 edition of Raw , Rhodes , DiBiase and Manu entered a storyline with Orton where Orton constantly criticized and insulted them and attacked DiBiase . At Survivor Series , Rhodes , along with Orton , was a sole survivor , for Orton 's team , in the annual Elimination match . Rhodes and Manu accepted Orton 's offer for an alliance in the following weeks and the trio dubbed themselves the " Legacy " ; debuting in a two @-@ on @-@ three handicap match against Batista and Triple H. Orton began scheduling tests for the Legacy members , so they could prove themselves and over two weeks , both Manu and Sim Snuka were kicked out . 
 On the January 12 , 2009 edition of Raw , Snuka and Manu gave Rhodes the chance to align with them to attack Orton , along with the returning DiBiase , but Rhodes refused . As they ambushed Orton , DiBiase instead joined with Orton and Rhodes to attack Snuka and Manu and became a member of the Legacy . As part of the Legacy , Rhodes entered the Royal Rumble match in order to help Orton win , and lasted until the final three , before being eliminated by Triple H. Rhodes and DiBiase became involved in Orton 's scripted rivalry with the McMahon family , helping him to attack Shane and Stephanie McMahon , and Stephanie 's real @-@ life husband , Triple H. Rhodes was also elevated to main event status as a result of joining the Legacy , competing in handicap and six @-@ man tag team matches against Orton 's opponents and rivals . On April 26 , at Backlash , Rhodes , DiBiase , and Orton defeated Triple H , Batista , and Shane McMahon in a six @-@ man tag team match , which , per the pre @-@ match stipulation , resulted in Orton winning the WWE Championship . Rhodes suffered a minor neck injury in June , but did not need any time off to recover . Throughout mid @-@ 2009 , Rhodes and DiBiase continued to compete against and attack Orton 's rivals , especially Triple H. This led to Triple H reforming D @-@ Generation X ( DX ) with Shawn Michaels , and DX defeated Rhodes and DiBiase at SummerSlam .

 Tension within the Legacy became apparent at the 2010 Royal Rumble , when Rhodes attempted to interfere in Orton 's match for the WWE Championship . Rhodes was caught by the referee , resulting in a disqualification for Orton , who attacked Rhodes and DiBiase , who had tried to help Rhodes , after the match . On the February 15 Raw , Orton took on Sheamus in a non @-@ title rematch , but was again disqualified after Rhodes and DiBiase interfered . During the WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match pay @-@ per @-@ view , Rhodes interfered , passing a lead pipe through the cage to DiBiase . DiBiase hit Orton with the pipe and eliminated him from the match . The next night on Raw , Orton attacked Rhodes and DiBiase during a six @-@ man tag team match , and they attacked Orton the following week in retaliation .

This storyline was put in place to give Runnels time off for his marriage and honeymoon to Brandi Reed , more well known as Eden , who now is a ring announcer on WWE Main Event and Smackdown .

 They lost momentum and went through a losing streak . After losing to Curtis Axel and Ryback , Cody , told Goldust to find a better tag team partner and left his brother . Following Payback , Rhodes tried to find a new partner for his brother , getting Sin Cara , R @-@ Truth , and Kofi Kingston to replace him in the team , both times losing to Axel and Ryback .

 Worst Gimmick – Stardust ( 2015 ) 
 = Hurricane Lili = 
 Hurricane Lili was the second deadliest and second costliest hurricane of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season , being surpassed by Hurricane Isidore , which affected the same areas around a week before Lili . Lili was the twelfth named storm , fourth hurricane , and second major hurricane of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season . The storm developed from a tropical disturbance in the open Atlantic on September 21 . It continued westward , affecting the Lesser Antilles as a tropical storm , then entered the Caribbean . As it moved west , the storm dissipated while being affected by wind shear south of Cuba , and regenerated when the vertical wind shear weakened . It turned to the northwest and strengthened up to category 2 strength on October 1 . Lili made two landfalls in western Cuba later that day , and then entered the Gulf of Mexico . The hurricane rapidly strengthened on October 2 , reaching Category 4 strength that afternoon . It weakened rapidly thereafter , and hit Louisiana as a Category 1 hurricane on October 3 . It moved inland and dissipated on October 6 . 
 Lili caused extensive damage through the Caribbean , particularly to crops and poorly built homes . Mudslides were common on the more mountainous islands , particularly Haiti and Jamaica . In the United States , the storm cut off the production of oil within the Gulf of Mexico , and caused severe damage in parts of Louisiana . Lili was also responsible for severe damage to the barrier islands and marshes in the southern portion of the state . Total damage amounted to $ 925 million ( 2002 USD ) , and the storm killed 15 people during its existence . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa on September 16 . A low level center of circulation developed from a tropical disturbance spawned by this tropical wave midway between the African coast and the Caribbean on September 20 . The next day , the system gained sufficient organization to become a tropical depression . The depression moved westward in excess of 20 mph ( 32 km / h ) , and reached tropical storm strength @-@ becoming Tropical Storm Lili as it passed through the Windward Islands . The cyclone continued to intensify as it moved west through the Caribbean Sea , reaching a peak strength of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) on the morning of September 24 . This was immediately followed by an abrupt weakening , and the storm 's maximum sustained winds dropped to 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) later that day . The sudden weakening was attributed to strong southerly vertical shear . The system degenerated into an open tropical wave the next morning , and remained in that state for nearly two days . 
 Lili regenerated near Jamaica on the evening of September 26 and gradually turned more to the west @-@ northwest while strengthening . The system became a hurricane on September 30 , just after passing through the Cayman Islands . The storm continued on its course while continuing to intensify , and made landfall twice the next day , on the Isle of Youth and near Pinar del Río as a Category 2 hurricane . Lili emerged over the Gulf of Mexico later that day , having lost little strength during its overland passage . 
 The system turned to the northwest and sped up , becoming a major hurricane on October 2 while 365 miles ( 587 km ) south @-@ southeast of New Orleans . This intensification continued , aided by warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico and good outflow . The system reached its peak strength of category 4 intensity , with winds of 145 mph ( 233 km / h ) , during that afternoon . 
 This strength was not maintained for long . The storm began to quickly weaken in the early morning hours of October 3 , and this rapid weakening continued until the hurricane 's final landfall near Intracoastal City , Louisiana due to a combination of vertical wind shear , cool waters just offshore Louisiana , and slowly encroaching dry air within its southwest quadrant . By the time of landfall , maximum sustained winds had dropped to 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) . The weakening was accompanied by a collapse of the inner eyewall before landfall . The system continued inland , curving to the north @-@ northeast , and dissipated when absorbed by an extratropical low near the Arkansas / Tennessee border on October 6 . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Tropical storm watches were issued in parts of the Lesser Antilles on September 22 . These were upgraded to warnings the next afternoon , and all advisories were dropped late on September 23 once the storm had passed . Over the next week , the islands of Hispaniola , Jamaica , Cuba , the Caymans , and the Yucatán Peninsula were all under advisories of some kind at different times . Hurricane and tropical storm watches were issued for the Gulf Coast on October 1 , and were upgraded to warnings the next morning . They were discontinued after the storm moved past the following day . 
 Because the cyclone affected the islands as a weak tropical storm , preparations were minimal . Two hundred people evacuated their homes in advance of the storm on the islands of St. Vincent and <unk> . In Jamaica , all schools and universities were closed in advance of the storm , and 17 public shelters were opened on the island . 
 Preparations were extensive in Cuba . Military officials at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba prepared for the possibility of evacuating their Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners . A total of 130 @,@ 000 Cuban citizens , mainly in western portions of the island , evacuated their homes prior to the storm . 
 Significant action was taken along the Gulf Coast as the threat the storm posed , predicted to come ashore at Category Four strength , became more urgent . Over a half million people evacuated their homes in Texas and Louisiana , including everyone in Iberia Parish . A total of 200 @,@ 000 people evacuated in Louisiana . At least 2 @,@ 000 volunteers staffed 115 Red Cross shelters in Louisiana , Texas , Mississippi , and Alabama . More than 20 @,@ 000 people stayed in those shelters . The Red Cross also sent over 160 @,@ 000 meals to the area . A total of 3 @,@ 000 prison inmates in Texas were evacuated to safer inland locations . The launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis was delayed for five days when the Kennedy Space Center was threatened by the storm , the first time a launch in Florida had been delayed because of weather in Houston . Stores across the warning area were very busy in advance of the storm . In New Iberia , Louisiana , hardware stores ran out of stock , and businesses in Lafayette , Louisiana reported similar shortages . 
 Collegiate activities were also affected by the storm . Southern University canceled four days of classes because of Lili , and 20 Texas A & M University Galveston , Texas students evacuated to the school 's College Station location . The University of South Alabama canceled two athletic events in advance of the storm . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Hurricane Lili was both the second deadliest and the second most devastating hurricane of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season ( Isidore killed 22 people and damaged $ 1 @.@ 3 billion worth of property ) . A total of 13 people died in the Caribbean Islands , and 2 more were killed in the United States . Severe damage to crops and livestock occurred through the Lesser Antilles , and damage to buildings and other infrastructure was reported in other Caribbean nations and the United States . 
 = = = Lesser Antilles = = = 
 Lili affected the islands as a tropical storm . Winds in the area were generally below hurricane force , although some gusts exceeded 74 mph ( 119 km / h ) . Rainfall of up to 4 inches ( 100 mm ) caused deadly mudslides . The winds , combined with poor construction , tore the roofs off numerous homes and businesses . The majority of the damage was dealt to primarily to the banana crop . 
 St. Lucia lost at least 75 percent of its banana crop , and hundreds of homes were damaged by the strong winds . Near total loss of electricity , water , and telephone services occurred , and utility systems were heavily damaged . Four people were killed on the island , and total damage was estimated at $ 20 million ( 2002 USD , $ 23 @.@ 5 million 2007 USD ) 
 Over 400 homes were damaged in Barbados , and nearly 50 trees were downed by the high gusts . Similar to in St. Lucia , there was significant damage to the nation 's banana crop . Extensive loss of electricity and telephone service also occurred . Damage totaled at nearly $ 200 @,@ 000 ( 2002 USD , $ 235 @,@ 000 2007 USD ) 
 Grenada also experienced moderate damage . A total of 14 homes ' roofs were damaged , and one was completely destroyed . The island Medical Centre 's roof was also damaged , and 12 landslides were reported . There was also mild damage to infrastructure , particularly in St. Patrick 's Parish ; three bridges were damaged or destroyed , along with seven utility poles and a water main . The entire island was without power at some point , but it was quickly restored in the southern part of the island where damage to the poles themselves was less significant . 
 St. Vincent and the Grenadines were heavily damaged , especially compared to other islands in the area . Several hundred homes and two schools were damaged , and the Rose Hall Police Station 's roof was lost . Still , the majority of damage was dealt to the agricultural industry . In all , damage to the islands totaled $ 40 million ( 2002 USD , $ 47 million 2007 USD ) . 
 = = = Haiti = = = 
 Lili passed offshore of Haiti as a dissipating tropical storm . The storm 's major impact was extremely heavy rainfall , in excess of 16 inches ( 410 mm ) near the settlement of Camp @-@ Perrin , Haiti . This caused the Ravine du Sud River to overflow , and submerge buildings in the town . Two people died in the mudslides these rains triggered , and two more drowned in the flooding around Camp @-@ Perrin . The floods also seriously damaged crops and infrastructure ; over 1700 homes were damaged and 240 were destroyed . Hatia was effected dramatically and many towns and villages submerged into rivers exceeding their <unk> discharge

 Lili affected Jamaica as a strengthening tropical storm . Wind gusts in excess of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) and rainfall over 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) resulted in damage to homes , crops , and utility systems . 
 Extremely heavy rainfall inundated the island . Cedar Valley recorded the most rainfall , with 23 @.@ 1 inches ( 590 mm ) measured . This led to prolific flooding that triggered mudslides across the island and killed four people . These floods decimated the island 's sugar cane crop , one of the island 's principal exports . The resultant flooding caused widespread problems with the infrastructure of the island . All of the island 's hospitals had flood damage , and three were also dealt structural damage by the strong winds . The flooding caused latrines and other sewage sources to overflow into the intake sources for the water supply , leading to fear of disease . 
 = = = Cuba = = = 
 Lili made landfall as a category two hurricane twice in Cuba , on the Isle of Youth and in the Pinar del Río Province , on October 1 . Wind gusts up to 112 mph ( 180 km / h ) and rainfall amounts reaching 6 inches ( 150 mm ) in some places caused damage to homes , businesses and crops . One person was killed . 
 Damage to buildings and other infrastructure was significant . The most severely affected provinces were Pinar del Río and La Habana . A total of 48 @,@ 000 homes were damaged , 16 @,@ 000 of them lost their roofs . The province Sancti Spiritus was not affected as severely , as only 945 homes were damaged , with 500 losing their roofs . The provinces in Eastern Cuba , including Guantanamo , suffered similar damage . Electricity outages for whole towns lasted weeks in parts of the western provinces . This led to loss of running water due to unpowered pumps , and deliveries of fresh water had to be made to remote villages . The tobacco and rice crops were badly depleted , but it was difficult to differentiate how much damage was caused by Lili , since Isidore had struck the region just a week earlier .

 Lili made landfall on the morning of October 3 near Intracoastal City , as a weakening category one hurricane . Wind gusts reaching 120 mph ( 190 km / h ) , coupled with over 6 inches ( 150 mm ) of rainfall and a storm surge of 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) caused over $ 790 million ( 2002 USD ; $ 1 billion 2007 USD ) in damage to Louisiana . A total of 237 @,@ 000 people lost power , and oil rigs offshore were shut down for up to a week . Crops were badly affected , particularly the sugar cane , damage totaled nearly $ 175 million ( 2002 USD ; $ 205 million 2007 USD ) . No direct deaths were reported as early warnings and the compact nature of the storm circumvented major loss of life . 
 Vermillion Parish , the point of landfall , was hardest hit . Wind gusts in excess of 120 mph ( 190 km / h ) , along with a storm surge of 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) dealt major damage to nearly 4000 homes . The worst storm surge flooding occurred in Intracoastal City , destroying 20 buildings owned by a helicopter company . One person died after the storm , and 20 were hospitalized for carbon monoxide poisoning . 
 Acadia Parish was also hard hit , recording wind gusts exceeding 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) , and 5 tornadoes touched down in the parish . Thousands of homes were damaged with over 2 @,@ 500 suffering severe damage . Power across the parish was knocked out , 2 people were injured and one was killed after the storm . Schools in the parish also sustained $ 1 @.@ 6 million ( 2002 USD ; $ 1 @.@ 9 million 2007 USD ) in damage .

 Lili 's outer rainbands dumped large amounts of rain and brought tropical storm force wind gusts to Mississippi . Pascagoula , Mississippi recorded wind gusts of 41 mph ( 66 km / h ) , and Picayune , Mississippi received 4 @.@ 14 inches ( 105 mm ) of rainfall . Minor power outages occurred , mainly in southern Mississippi , and combined with the flooding of roads and buildings caused $ 30 million ( 2002 USD ; $ 35 million 2007 USD ) in damage . No deaths occurred in Mississippi .

 President Bush declared Louisiana a federal disaster area after the storm , making it eligible for assistance . FEMA set up three locations to apply in Mississippi and Louisiana . Applications began pouring in , 153 @,@ 000 by the time of the deadline . Over $ 311 million in aid was granted to Louisiana . A total of $ 50 million of that money was in the form of low interest loans , and not actual grants . 
 Over 1 @,@ 000 power workers from eight different states went to the worst hit areas to help restore power . Seven states sent tree trimmers to help clear debris from power lines and roads to speed the recovery process . In addition , FEMA gave <unk> , the state 's power company , an $ 8 @.@ 6 million grant , which paid for 75 % of the damage to the electrical grid there . It took up to four weeks to restore power to all customers . 
 Hurricane Lili caused great environmental damage to the marshes and barrier islands in Louisiana . Huge fish kills were observed in marshes near the landfall point , and in the Atchafalaya Swamp . The barrier islands to the east of the landfall point , those subjected to the highest surge , were severely eroded . Sand was also deposited behind them into the brackish marshes , burying vegetation . The freshwater marshes were severely damaged by the wind and surge , some of them completely destroyed . The severe erosion created new waterways connecting inland bodies of water with the Gulf of Mexico , which eventually led to further erosion of inland lagoons .

 The name Lili was retired in the spring of 2003 because of its destruction and deadly Caribbean track , and will never be used again in the Atlantic basin . It was replaced with Laura for the 2008 season . The names Lucy and Lisette were also suggested as possible replacement names for Lili . 
 = Interstate 676 = 
 Interstate 676 ( abbreviated I @-@ 676 ) is an Interstate Highway that serves as a major thoroughfare through Center City Philadelphia , where it is known as the Vine Street Expressway , and Camden , New Jersey , where it is known as the northern segment of the North – South Freeway , as well as the Martin Luther King Jr . Memorial Highway . Its western terminus is at I @-@ 76 in Philadelphia near the Philadelphia Museum of Art and Fairmount Park . From there it heads east and is then routed on surface streets near Franklin Square and Independence Mall , home of the Liberty Bell , before crossing the Ben Franklin Bridge . On the New Jersey side of the bridge , the highway heads south to its southern terminus at I @-@ 76 in Gloucester City near the Walt Whitman Bridge . Between the western terminus and downtown Camden , I @-@ 676 is concurrent with U.S. Route 30 ( US 30 ) . 
 After World War II , freeway approaches were planned for both sides of the Ben Franklin Bridge , which was completed in 1926 and served as a part of US 30 . In Pennsylvania , the Vine Street Expressway was planned to run along the northern edge of Center City Philadelphia to the Schuylkill River , while in New Jersey , the North @-@ South Freeway was to head south along the Route 42 corridor . When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s , this stretch of highway was a part of I @-@ 80S , with Interstate 680 continuing on the Schuylkill Expressway to the Walt Whitman Bridge . In 1964 , the designations became I @-@ 76 and I @-@ 676 , respectively , and in 1972 the two routes were switched onto their current alignments . I @-@ 676 in New Jersey was completed between I @-@ 76 and Morgan Boulevard by 1960 and north of there to downtown Camden by the 1980s . The Vine Street Expressway was opened from the Schuylkill Expressway to 18th Street by 1960 and east of there to I @-@ 95 on January 10 , 1991 after several obstacles to construction . However , there are grade @-@ level intersections in the connections between the Vine Street Expressway and the Ben Franklin Bridge .

 I @-@ 676 begins at an interchange with the Schuylkill Expressway ( I @-@ 76 and US 30 ) in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , heading to the east on the six @-@ lane Vine Street Expressway concurrent with US 30 . It immediately crosses the Schuylkill River on the Vine Street Expressway Bridge and comes to an interchange with 23rd Street and 22nd Street and the Ben Franklin Parkway that has access to the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Franklin Institute . From this point , the Vine Street Expressway enters a depressed road cut and passes under several streets , running along the northern edge of Center City Philadelphia . Vine Street serves as a frontage road to the freeway at street level . Within this alignment , there is an exit for PA 611 ( Broad Street ) . After passing under 10th Street in Chinatown , the last street the depressed alignment passes under , the highway rises up and reaches a split between the Vine Street Expressway , which continues to I @-@ 95 , and I @-@ 676 / US 30 . At this split , there is also an eastbound exit and westbound entrance for 8th Street . After exiting the Vine Street Expressway , eastbound I @-@ 676 / US 30 has a brief at @-@ grade portion along southbound 6th Street to the Ben Franklin Bridge approach , an example of a non – limited access section of Interstate Highway . Westbound I @-@ 676 / US 30 has a ramp from the bridge to the Vine Street Expressway that intersects 7th Street and 8th Street at @-@ grade . From this point , I @-@ 676 / US 30 crosses over the Delaware River on the seven @-@ lane Ben Franklin Bridge , which also carries pedestrians and the PATCO Speedline . This bridge and its approaches are maintained by the Delaware River Port Authority . 
 = = = New Jersey = = = 
 After crossing the bridge , the freeway enters the downtown area of Camden in Camden County , New Jersey and passes to the north of Campbell 's Field . Upon entering New Jersey , I @-@ 676 becomes signed as a north @-@ south road . There is a southbound ramp to 6th Street in Camden , which is near the toll booths for northbound traffic . After the toll plaza , US 30 splits from I @-@ 676 at an interchange , at which point I @-@ 676 turns south as a six @-@ lane freeway called the Martin Luther King Memorial Highway or the North @-@ South Freeway . Immediately after the US 30 split , there is an interchange with CR 537 ( Market Street / Federal Street ) and Martin Luther King Boulevard that provides access to downtown Camden . From this point , I @-@ 676 continues south through urban areas of the city , passing over several streets and running immediately to the west of a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line . The road heads southwest on a viaduct over neighborhoods before the interchange with CR 607 ( <unk> Avenue ) and Atlantic Avenue . I @-@ 676 turns south at this junction and comes to the exit for Morgan Boulevard . Past Morgan Boulevard , the freeway crosses the North Branch of Newton Creek . Here , I @-@ 676 ends at an interchange east of the Walt Whitman Bridge with I @-@ 76 , CR 630 , and Route 76C , the latter being an access road to US 130 and Route 168 . The North @-@ South Freeway becomes a part of I @-@ 76 past this interchange and continues into Gloucester City .

 The Ben Franklin Bridge was opened on July 1 , 1926 and was designated to carry US 30 across the Delaware River . A parkway called the Camden @-@ Atlantic City Parkway was planned in 1932 to connect the Ben Franklin Bridge southeast to Atlantic City ; this was never built . After World War II , freeway connections were planned on both sides of the Ben Franklin Bridge . In Philadelphia , the Vine Street Expressway was planned to run along the Vine Street corridor to the present @-@ day Schuylkill Expressway in 1945 . The North @-@ South Freeway was proposed in New Jersey as a connection from the bridge south along the Route 42 corridor . In 1950 , the city of Philadelphia began planning the construction of the Vine Street Expressway , which would run along a depressed alignment through the city . 
 When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s , the Vine Street Expressway , Ben Franklin Bridge , and part of the North @-@ South Freeway were to become a part of it . In New Jersey , this Interstate was initially designated as FAI Corridor 109 . In 1958 , this freeway was initially planned as I @-@ 895 and I @-@ 380 before the American Association of State Highway Officials designated it as a part of I @-@ 80S . Meanwhile , I @-@ 680 was designated along the present @-@ day Schuylkill Expressway between the Vine Street Expressway and the Walt Whitman Bridge . By 1960 , the Vine Street Expressway had been completed between the Schuylkill Expressway and 18th Street . The portion of I @-@ 80S in New Jersey on the North @-@ South Freeway had opened south of Morgan Boulevard by this time . On April 16 , 1963 , Pennsylvania wanted to renumber its Interstate numbers . Part of this was the renumbering from I @-@ 80S into I @-@ 76 , and all of its auxiliary routes into I @-@ <unk> . The Federal Highway Administration approved the request on February 26 , 1964 . As a result , I @-@ 80S became I @-@ 76 and I @-@ 680 became I @-@ 676 . In 1972 , the I @-@ 76 and the I @-@ 676 designations were switched onto their current routes . The remainder of the New Jersey portion of I @-@ 676 between Morgan Boulevard and US 30 was completed by the 1980s . 
 There were several challenges in building the Vine Street Expressway between 18th Street and the Ben Franklin Bridge . The road was to run through developed areas of Philadelphia , intersecting several streets and railroad lines . In addition , the route was to run through Franklin Square , a historically sensitive site , to connect to the Ben Franklin Bridge . As a result , the routing was modified in 1966 to avoid many of these obstacles . The route was to avoid running through Franklin Square , leading to the eastbound direction using surface streets to access the Ben Franklin Bridge , and a planned connector to Market Street was removed . In the 1970s , the proposed freeway ’ s environmental impact statement had to be evaluated again per new guidelines ; when the new environmental impact statement was issued in 1977 , it was found that more improvements were needed for mass transit in the area of the planned freeway . To comply with this , provisions were made concerning the proposed underground Center City Commuter Connection for SEPTA Regional Rail , in which the railroad tracks would pass under I @-@ 676 and residences would be built over the railroad tunnel in Chinatown . Construction was approved in 1986 on the Vine Street Expressway from 18th Street to the Ben Franklin Bridge , with no provisions for elevated connections between the Ben Franklin Bridge and the Vine Street Expressway to avoid disturbing Franklin Square . This portion of the Vine Street Expressway opened to traffic on January 10 , 1991 , completing I @-@ 676 . 
 On April 14 , 2015 , PennDOT began work to rebuild seven existing overpasses on the Vine Street Expressway portion of I @-@ 676 . The project , which will cost $ 64 @.@ 8 million , is to be completed in fall 2019 .

 = Crucibulum = 
 Crucibulum is a genus in the Nidulariaceae , a family of fungi whose fruiting bodies resemble tiny egg @-@ filled bird 's nests . Often called " splash cups " , the fruiting bodies are adapted for spore dispersal by using the kinetic energy of falling drops of rain . The " eggs " inside the bird 's nests ( technically known as peridioles ) are hard waxy shells containing spores , and tend to stick to whatever nearby herbage they land on , thus increasing the odds of being consumed and dispersed by herbivorous animals . Members of this genus are saprobic , obtaining nutrients from dead organic matter , and are typically found growing on decayed wood and wood debris . The three known Crucibulum species ( C. laeve , C. parvulum , and C. cyathiforme ) are distinguished from other genera of the Nidulariaceae by their relatively simple funiculus – a cord of hyphae that connects the peridiole ( the " eggs " ) to the exterior of the bird 's nest . 
 = = History = = 
 Bird 's nest fungi were first mentioned by Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius in Rariorum plantarum historia ( 1601 ) . Over the next couple of centuries , these fungi were the subject of some controversy regarding whether the peridioles were seeds , and the mechanism by which they were dispersed in nature . For example , the French botanist Jean @-@ Jacques Paulet , in his work Traité des champignons ( 1790 – 3 ) , erroneously suggested that peridioles were ejected from the fruiting bodies by some sort of spring mechanism . 
 The structure and biology of the genus Crucibulum was better known by the mid @-@ 19th century , when the brothers Louis René and Charles Tulasne published a monograph on the bird 's nest fungi . Subsequently , monographs were written in 1902 by Violet S. White ( American species ) , Curtis Gates Lloyd in 1906 , Gordon Herriot Cunningham in 1924 ( New Zealand species ) , and Harold J. Brodie in 1975 . 
 The type species for the genus Crucibulum described by the Tulasne brothers was Crucibulum vulgare , an older synonym of the species known today as C. laeve . However , this naming choice was later deemed invalid by rules of fungal nomenclature ; the first name validly applied to the species was C. laeve , use by De Candolle , who had based his species upon <unk> laevis as it appeared in Bulliard 's Histoire des <unk> de la France ( Paris , 1791 ) . <unk> and Lee published the first taxonomically valid description of the genus in 1936 . In their 1844 monograph on the Nidulariaceae , the brothers Louis René and Charles Tulasne used the name Crucibulum vulgare , and the species was known by this name until the International Commission on the Taxonomy of Fungi ( <unk> ) changed the starting @-@ point date for the naming of fungi , and C. vulgare was deemed invalid . The etymology of the specific epithet is derived from the Latin laeve , meaning " smooth " . 
 = = Description = = 
 Crucibulum species have light tan to cinnamon @-@ colored fruiting bodies , known as a peridium , that are cup- or crucible @-@ shaped . Depending on the species , the size of the peridium may range from 2 – 4 tall by 1 @.@ 5 – 3 mm wide at the mouth ( for C. parvulum ) to 5 – 10 mm tall by 5 – 8 mm wide ( for C. laeve ) . Viewed microscopically , the wall of the peridium is made of a single layer of tissue , in contrast to the three @-@ layered peridium wall in Cyathus species . The outer surface of the peridium has hyphae that agglutinate so as to form a texture with visible filaments , a condition known as fibrillose ; this outer layers of hairs typically wears off with age to leave a relatively smooth surface . 
 Young specimens have a thin layer of tissue called an epiphragm that covers the top of the peridium ; it wears off at maturity to expose the peridioles within . There are usually 4 – 6 peridioles ( up to 15 have been noted for C. laeve ) that are disc @-@ shaped , whitish in color , and attached to the endoperidium by a strand called a funicular cord . Made of mycelia , The funicular cord tends to wither away and disappear as the fruiting body ages . Spores from Crucibulum species typically have an elliptical or roughly spherical shape , and are thick @-@ walled , <unk> ( hyaline ) or light yellow @-@ brown in color , with dimensions of 5 – 15 by 5 – 8 <unk> the spores of C. cyathiforme are notably slightly or strongly curved . 
 Because the basic fruiting body structure in all genera of the Nidulariaceae family is essentially similar , Crucibulum may be readily confused with species of Nidula or Cyathus , especially older , weathered specimens of Cyathus that may have the hairy ectoperidium worn off . It distinguished from Nidula by the presence of a funiculus , a cord of hyphae attaching the peridiole to the endoperidium . Cyathus differs from genus Crucibulum by having a distinct three @-@ layered wall and a more intricate funiculus . 
 = = = Peridiole structure = = = 
 Derived from the Greek word <unk> , meaning " small leather pouch " , the peridiole is the " egg " of the bird 's nest . It is a mass of basidiospores and glebal tissue enclosed by a hard and waxy outer shell . In Crucibulum , the disc @-@ shaped peridioles are light buff or white ; the is due to a persistent layer of tissue surrounding the peridioles , called a tunica . Inside the peridiole is a spore @-@ bearing tissue ( the hymenium ) that is made of spore @-@ bearing cells ( basidia ) , sterile ( non @-@ reproductive ) structures , and spores . 
 Peridioles are attached to the fruiting body by a funiculus , a structure of hyphae that may be differentiated into three regions : the basal piece , which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium , the middle piece , and an upper sheath , called the purse , connected to the lower surface of the peridiole . In the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord , attached at one end to the peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron . In Crucibulum species the peridioles is covered by a whitish tunica . The funiculus of Crucibulum species is markedly different from those of Cyathus species : in Crucibulum , the purse is a rounded knob 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 5 mm wide , attached to the underside of the peridiole . Attaching the purse directly to the wall of the peridium is a stout yellow @-@ grey cord 0 @.@ 1 mm wide and about 2 @.@ 5 mm long . 
 = = Spore dispersal = = 
 Spores are dispersed when a peridiole is dislodged by raindrops or water dripping off an over @-@ hanging leaf . The smooth inner walls of the fruiting body consistently form an angle of 70 – 75 ° with the horizontal ; it has been demonstrated experimentally that the combined effect of the crucible shape and internal wall angle produce a good splash action . The force of the falling water splashes out the peridiole , uncoiling and snapping the funiculus , the cord that connects it to the fruiting body . As the peridiole continues its flight , the funiculus extends to its full length . The sticky end of the funiculus may adhere to a leaf or a twig some distance away , and the peridiole may end up being wrapped around or hanging down the object to which the funiculus is stuck . The spores can germinate when the thick outer wall of the peridiole wears away , or the peridiole may be eaten by a herbivorous animal , and ultimately passed through its digestive system . This method of spore dispersal , first suggested by John Ray in the late 17th century , was tested experimentally by Martin ( 1927 ) , and more thoroughly by Buller and Brodie in the 1940s . 
 = = Life cycle = = 
 The life cycle of Crucibulum , which contains both haploid and diploid stages , is typical of the species of Basidiomycota that can reproduce both asexually ( via vegetative spores ) , or sexually ( with meiosis ) . Like other wood @-@ decay fungi , this life cycle may be considered as two functionally different phases : the vegetative stage for the spread of mycelia , and the reproductive stage for the establishment of spore @-@ producing structures , the fruiting bodies . 
 The vegetative stage encompasses those phases of the life cycle involved with the germination , spread , and survival of the mycelium . Spores germinate under suitable conditions of moisture and temperature , and grow into branching filaments called hyphae , pushing out like roots into the rotting wood . These hyphae are homokaryotic , containing a single nucleus in each compartment ; they increase in length by adding cell @-@ wall material to a growing tip . As these tips expand and spread to produce new growing points , a network called the mycelium develops . Mycelial growth occurs by mitosis and the synthesis of hyphal biomass . When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another , they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called plasmogamy . <unk> for mycelial survival and colonization a substrate ( like rotting wood ) include suitable humidity and nutrient <unk> laeve is saprobic , so mycelial growth in rotting wood is made possible by the secretion of enzymes that break down complex polysaccharides ( such as cellulose and lignin ) into simple sugars that can be used as nutrients . 
 After a period of time and under the appropriate environmental conditions , the dikaryotic mycelia may enter the reproductive stage of the life cycle . Fruiting body formation is influenced by external factors such as season ( which affects temperature and air humidity ) , nutrients and light . As fruiting bodies develop they produce peridioles containing the basidia upon which new basidiospores are made . Young basidia contain a pair of haploid sexually compatible nuclei which fuse , and the resulting diploid fusion nucleus undergoes meiosis to produce basidiospores , each containing a single haploid nucleus . The dikaryotic mycelia from which the fruiting bodies are produced is long lasting , and will continue to produce successive generations of fruiting bodies as long as the environmental conditions are favorable . 
 = = Development = = 
 The initial studies on the development of the fruiting bodies in Crucibulum were performed by the brothers Tulasne ( 1844 ) , Sachs ( 1855 ) , <unk> ( 1866 ) , <unk> ( 1877 ) , and Walker ( 1920 ) . Collectively , these early researchers determined that basidiospores are produced on club @-@ shaped basidia which line the internal cavity of the peridiole . Basidia typically have 4 spores , attached by a short projection ( a sterigma ) ; after being detached from the basidia the spores migrate towards the center of the peridiole concurrently with the collapse and gelatinization of the underlying tissues . 
 = = Bioactive compounds = = 
 Grown in liquid culture , Crucibulum laeve produces bioactive chemicals called <unk> that are structurally related to <unk> and <unk> , molecules that contain cyclic amide or lactone five @-@ membered ring structures ; these compounds are unique to this species . <unk> B11 was first identified in 1995 , while later research confirmed the presence of additional <unk> @-@ type metabolites . These compounds are inhibitors of <unk> reductase , an enzyme that has been implicated in the formation of cataracts in advanced stages of diabetes mellitus . The <unk> compounds may have therapeutic use in the treatment of this disorder . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Like other bird 's nest fungi , Crucibulum species are saprobic and derive their nutrients from decomposing organic matter . They are typically found growing on wood and woody debris such as stems , twigs , wood chips , old nut shells , and old matting ; they are sometimes found on " dried manure cakes " . Brodie notes ( of C. laeve ) they are " never " found on soil or large logs . C. parvulum has been found on the roots and stems of old or dead dry land plants such as Juniperus <unk> and Artemisia species . 
 C. laeve , the most well @-@ known species of Crucibulum , is a temperate @-@ zone species with a circumpolar distribution . It has been collected in most European countries and the Canary Islands ; in North America it has been found from Alaska to Mexico , while South American locations include Chile and Tierra del Fuego . It has also been found in Australia , Iceland , Japan , and New Zealand . C. parvulum has a primarily North American distribution , having been found in Alaska , southern Alberta Badlands , the Canadian Rocky Mountains and in semi @-@ deserts of Idaho ; in 2004 it was collected in China . C. cyathiforme is only known from Colombia — where it was discovered growing at an elevation of nearly 7000 feet ( <unk> metres ) — and Armenia . 
 = = Edibility = = 
 Species in the Nidulariaceae family , including Crucibulum , are considered inedible , as they are " not sufficiently large , fleshy , or odorous to be of interest to humans as food " . However , there have not been reports of poisonous alkaloids or other substances considered toxic to humans . 
 = = Species = = 
 Until the 1970s Crucibulum was thought to be monotypic , containing the single species C. laeve ( formerly C. vulgaris ) . This was in part due to the stance that Curtis Gates Lloyd and other mycologists had taken in the early 20th century , believing that the designation of new species was not justifiable due to the existence of intermediate forms in similar habitats and close proximity . In 1970 – 71 , Brodie discovered and reported two variants that differed from C. laeve sufficiently to justify naming them as new species .

The peridioles are 1 – 2 mm broad , tan to white in color , disc @-@ shaped , and wrinkled when dry . This species grows on material like twigs , lignin @-@ rich vegetable debris , wood chips , old matting , or manure . 
 The immature fruiting body of Crucibulum laeve ( technically , the peridium ) , is roughly spherical in shape , but in maturity the base is narrowed slightly relative to the top , so that it appears like a cup , or crucible . The fruiting bodies are usually 5 – 8 mm tall and almost as wide at the mouth . When young , the mouth is enclosed by a thin membrane called an epiphragm , which is covered with surface hairs . As the fruiting body matures and the fruiting body expands , the epiphragm ruptures , exposing the internal contents . The wall of the fruiting body is made of a single uniform layer of closely interwoven hyphae ( the threadlike filaments that form the mycelium ) roughly 0 @.@ 25 – 0 @.@ 5 mm thick ; this wall structure is in contrast to species from the bird 's nest fungus genus Cyathus , which have a distinctly three @-@ layered wall . Young species have a yellowish velvety cover of fine hairs , but this external surface becomes sloughed off and becomes smooth as the fruiting body matures ; the color changes to brown , although some old weathered specimens may be bleached grey or dirty white . The inner surface of the fruiting body is smooth and shiny . The cups contain tiny pale ochraceous or white " eggs , " technically termed peridioles , usually 1 – 2 mm in diameter . In each peridiole is a spore @-@ producing layer of tissue , the hymenium . This layer is largely composed of basidia ( spore @-@ producing cells ) mixed with paraphyses ( non @-@ spore producing elements interspersed between basidia ) . Peridioles are covered by a thin membrane of loosely woven hyphae known as a tunica ; separated from the light @-@ colored tunica , the peridioles are black . The peridioles are attached to the inner wall of the peridium by a thin , elastic cord of mycelium , a funiculus , which can be extended at length when moist . 
 Crucibulum laeve has spores that are elliptical , hyaline ( translucent ) , and smooth , with dimensions of 7 – 10 by 4 – 6 µm . 
 = = = C. parvulum = = = 
 This species is characterized by its very small peridia ( dimensions 1 @.@ 5 – 3 mm wide at the mouth x 2 – 4 mm tall ) with a color that may range from white to grey to pale buff , but never yellow – helping distinguish it from C. laeve . The peridia are obconic , thin @-@ walled ( 150 – 180 µm at the lip , approximately 300 µm thick at the edge of the lip ) , tomentose on the outer side and smooth on the inner side , and taper to a narrow base . The peridioles range in width between 0 @.@ 5 – 1 @.@ 25 mm broad . Basidiospores have dimensions of 4 – 5 by 7 – 8 µm . 
 = Sarcoscypha dudleyi = 
 Sarcoscypha dudleyi , commonly known as the crimson cup or the scarlet cup , is a species of fungus in the Sarcoscyphaceae family of the Pezizales order . In addition to its main distribution in the central to eastern United States , the fungus has also been recorded once in Bulgaria . It has been frequently confused with Sarcoscypha coccinea , but can be distinguished from this and other related species in Sarcoscypha by differences in microscopic characteristics , such as the presence and number of oil droplets in the spores . The species Molliardiomyces dudleyi is an imperfect form of the fungus that lacks a sexually reproductive stage in its life cycle . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The species was first collected by the botanist William Russell Dudley in October 1888 , in Tompkins County , New York . American mycologist Charles Horton Peck , who described it in the 1894 Annual Report of the New York State Botanist , named it Peziza <unk> after its discoverer . Peck noted a physical resemblance to P. aurantia ( now known as Aleuria aurantia ) and P. <unk> , and said that it could be distinguished from those species by its yellow hymenium and larger spores . Several mycologists have considered the species to be synonymous with S. coccinea . However , as was later pointed out by Harrington ( 1990 ) , " the importance of fresh material for species diagnosis , especially for noting <unk> <unk> , cannot be overstated . Although I had examined material ( dried herbarium specimens ) from western North America I was not prepared to recognize that group as a species distinct from the two , large eastern North American species until I saw fresh ( living ) material . " As is the case with many fungi , microscopic differences between similar species can only be accurately determined by examining fresh material . Harrington analyzed herbarium specimens and fresh material of North American specimens of " S. coccinea " , and found that both S. dudleyi and S. austriaca were commonly misidentified . These results echoed a similar 1984 analysis of European specimens , performed by Hans @-@ Otto <unk> . 
 The phylogenetic relationships in the genus Sarcoscypha were analyzed by Francis Harrington in the late 1990s . The cladistic analysis combined comparison of sequences from the internal transcribed spacer in the non @-@ functional RNA with fifteen traditional morphological characters , such as spore features , fruit body shape , and degree of hair curliness . Based on this analysis , S. dudleyi is part of a clade of evolutionarily related taxa that includes the species S. occidentalis , S. emarginata , S. <unk> , S. <unk> and S. mesocyatha . All of these species contain large oil droplets in their spores , in contrast to the other major clade of Sarcoscypha ( containing the type species S. coccinea ) , characterized by having smaller , more numerous droplets . 
 Sarcoscypha dudleyi is commonly known as the " crimson cup " or the " scarlet cup " , although it shares this latter name with S. coccinea . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit body is 2 – 6 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 2 @.@ 4 in ) broad and shallowly to deeply cup @-@ shaped . The exterior surface of the fruit body is covered with whitish , matted " hairs " , while the interior fertile surface of the cup ( the hymenium ) is <unk> to orange @-@ red . The edge of the cup ( or margin ) is curved inwards in young fruit bodies . The stem , if present at all , is short . 
 The asci are 400 – 500 by 12 – 14 µm , cylindrical , and operculate . The ascospores are elliptical to cylindrical with rounded ends , <unk> , hyaline , and measure 26 – 40 by 10 – 12 µm . They contain two large oil drops at either end ; the oil drops are useful taxonomic characters that may be used to help distinguish S. dudleyi from some other Sarcoscypha species . The spores are covered with a sheath of mucilage , which typically causes the eight spores of the ascus to be ejected together . The paraphyses ( sterile filamentous hyphal end cells in the hymenium ) are slender , slightly enlarged above , and contain numerous red granules . The granules contain carotenoid pigments such as <unk> or beta carotene , and give the fruit body its color . 
 = = = Anamorph form = = = 
 Anamorphic or imperfect fungi are those that seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle , and typically reproduce by the process of mitosis in structures called conidia . In some cases , the sexual stage — or teleomorph stage — is later identified , and a teleomorph @-@ anamorph relationship is established between the species . The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permits the recognition of two ( or more ) names for one and the same organisms , one based on the teleomorph , the other ( s ) restricted to the anamorph . The anamorphic state of S. coccinea is Molliardiomyces dudleyi . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Sarcoscypha dudleyi is a saprobic species , and derives nutrients by breaking down the complex insoluble polysaccharides found in woody material , such as cellulose and lignin . Fruit bodies are found growing singly or in very small groups , and are attached to buried or partially buried sticks in forests . Basswood has been noted to be a preferred wood type for the species . Fruit bodies typically appear during early spring , but may occasionally also in late fall . Although the distribution appears to be largely restricted to the eastern United States , it was once reported in Bulgaria in 1994 , representing the first European collection . 
 = Ramaria botrytis = 
 Ramaria botrytis , commonly known as the clustered coral , the pink @-@ tipped coral mushroom , or the cauliflower coral , is an edible species of coral fungus in the family Gomphaceae . Its robust fruit body can grow up to 15 cm ( 6 in ) in diameter and 20 cm ( 8 in ) tall , and resembles some marine coral . Its dense branches , which originate from a stout , massive base , are swollen at the tips and divided into several small branchlets . The branches are initially whitish but age to buff or tan , with tips that are pink to reddish . The flesh is thick and white . The spores , yellowish in deposit , are ellipsoid , feature longitudinal striations , and measure about 13 @.@ 8 by 4 @.@ 7 micrometers . 
 The type species of the genus Ramaria , R. botrytis was first described scientifically in 1797 by mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon . A widely distributed species , it is found in North America , North Africa , central and eastern Europe , Australia , and Asia . The fungus is mycorrhizal with broadleaf trees , and fruits on the ground in wooded areas . There are several species of coral fungi that are superficially similar in appearance to R. botrytis , and although comparison of habitat or characteristics like color or branching morphology is often sufficient for identification , sometimes microscopy is required to definitively distinguish between them . Fruit bodies of Ramaria botrytis are edible , and young specimens have a mild , fruity taste . Some authors warn of laxative effects in susceptible individuals . The fungus contains several chemical compounds with in vitro biological activity , and fruit bodies have antimicrobial activity against several species and strains of drug @-@ resistant bacteria that cause disease in humans . 
 = = Taxonomy and classification = = 
 The species was first named as Clavaria botrytis in 1797 by Christian Hendrik Persoon . In 1821 , Elias Magnus Fries sanctioned the genus name Clavaria , and treated Ramaria as a section of Clavaria . It was given its current name in 1918 by Adalbert Ricken . Obsolete historical synonyms include Gotthold Hahn 's 1883 <unk> botrytis and A. A. Pearson 's variety Clavaria botrytis var. alba , which is no longer recognized as an independent taxon . Currie Marr and Daniel Stuntz described the variety R. botrytis var. aurantiiramosa in their 1973 monograph of western Washington Ramaria ; Edwin Schild and G. Ricci described variety compactospora from Italy in 1998 . In 1950 , E.J.H. Corner published George F. Atkinson 's 1908 Clavaria holorubella as R. botrytis var. holorubella , but this taxon is now known as the independent species Ramaria holorubella . 
 The specific epithet botrytis is derived from the Greek word <unk> ( <unk> ) meaning " bunch of grapes " . The species is commonly known as the " cauliflower coral " , the " pink @-@ tipped coral mushroom " , or the " <unk> coral " . In the <unk> de Perote region of Veracruz , Mexico , R. botrytis is known by the local names <unk> , meaning " little broom " , or <unk> , meaning " breast meat of chicken " . 
 Ramaria botrytis was designated the type species of Ramaria in 1933 by Marinus Anton Donk . Modern molecular analysis indicates that Ramaria is a polyphyletic assemblage of species with clavarioid fruit bodies . According to the infrageneric classification scheme proposed by Marr and Stuntz , R. botrytis is included in the subgenus Ramaria , which includes species that have grooved spores , clamps present in the hyphae , and fruit bodies with a large , profusely branched cauliflower @-@ like appearance . Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA suggests that R. botrytis is closely related to R. <unk> and R. <unk> , and that these species form a clade that is sister ( sharing a recent common ancestor ) to the false truffle genus <unk> , the most derived group within the studied taxa . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit bodies produced by the fungus are 7 to 15 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 to 5 @.@ 9 in ) wide and 6 to 20 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 to 7 @.@ 9 in ) tall . They are fleshy cauliflower @-@ like masses with a stout central stem that splits into a few lower primary branches before branching densely above . The stem is short and thick — between 1 @.@ 5 and 6 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 and 2 @.@ 4 in ) in diameter — and tapers downward . Initially white , in age both the stem and branches turn pale yellow to buff to tan . Old fruit bodies can fade to become almost white , or may be ochre due to fallen spores . The branching pattern is irregular , with the primary branches few and thick — typically 2 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 2 in ) — and the final branches slender ( 2 – 3 mm ) , and usually terminated with five to seven branchlets . The branchlet tips are pink to purplish @-@ red . The flesh is solid and white , and has an odor described variously as indistinct or pleasant . A drop of Melzer 's reagent applied to the stem tissue reveals a weak amyloid staining reaction that often requires more than 30 minutes to develop . This reaction can be used to help distinguish R. botrytis from other similar fungi . 
 Spores are produced by basidia on the outer surface of the branches . Viewed in deposit , the spores are pale yellow . Microscopically , they have fine longitudinal or oblique striations that often fuse together in a vein @-@ like network . They range in shape from roughly cylindrical to sigmoid ( curved like the letter " S " ) , and their dimensions are 12 – 16 by 4 – 5 µm . Basidia are four @-@ spored ( occasionally two @-@ spored ) , and measure 59 – 82 by 8 – 11 µm . The sterigmata ( slender projections of the basidia that attach to the spores ) are 4 – 8 µm long . The hymenium and subhymenium ( the tissue layer immediately under the hymenium ) combined are about 80 µm thick . Hyphae comprising the subhymenium are interwoven , 2 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 5 µm in diameter , thin @-@ walled , and clamped . 
 The variety R. botrytis var. aurantiiramosa is distinguished from the more common variety by the orange color of the upper branches . Variety compactospora tends to show a more pronounced wine @-@ red , purple , or reddish color in the branch tips , and has smaller spores measuring 9 @.@ 2 – 12 @.@ 8 by 4 – 5 @.@ 4 µm . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Distinctive features of Ramaria botrytis include its large size , the orange , reddish , or purplish branchlets , striate spores with dimensions averaging 13 @.@ 8 by 4 @.@ 7 µm , and a weak amyloid staining reaction of the stem tissue . R. <unk> has reddish terminal branches , a stout form , and striate spores , but may be distinguished from R. botrytis by its much shorter spores . Other species with which R. botrytis may be confused include : R. formosa , which has branches that are pinker than R. botrytis , and yellow @-@ tipped ; R. <unk> , found in the Great Lakes region of the United States , whose branch tips darken with age ; R. <unk> , which has yellow to brown branch tips ; R. <unk> , which has branches in which the pink color fades after picking or in mature fruit bodies ; and R. <unk> , which is most reliably distinguished from R. botrytis by its smooth spores . The European species R. <unk> , often confused with R. botrytis and sometimes considered synonymous , can be distinguished by microscopic characteristics : R. <unk> lacks the clamped hyphae of R. botrytis , its spores are longer and wider , and they have warts instead of striations . The North American species R. <unk> , though superficially similar to R. botrytis , has several distinguishing characteristics : it grows under hemlock ; it has reddish to magenta branches with orange to yellowish tips ; it lacks any discernible odor ; it has warted , somewhat cylindrical spores averaging 9 @.@ 9 by 3 @.@ 7 µm ; and it has non @-@ amyloid stem tissue . <unk> colored bright pink to reddish , R. <unk> has spores measuring 7 – 9 by 3 – 3 @.@ 5 µm .

 An ectomycorrhizal species , Ramaria botrytis forms mutualistic associations with broadleaf trees , particularly beech . In a study to determine the effectiveness of several edible ectomycorrhizal fungi in promoting growth and nutrient accumulation of large @-@ fruited red mahogany ( Eucalyptus <unk> ) , R. botrytis was the best at improving root colonization and macronutrient uptake . Records of associations with conifers probably represent similar species . Fruit bodies grow on the ground singly , scattered , or in small groups among leaves in woods . They can also grow in fairy rings . Ramaria botrytis is a " snowbank fungus " , meaning it commonly fruits near the edges of melting snowbanks in the spring . In Korea , it is prevalent at sites that also produce the choice edible species Tricholoma <unk> . 
 Ramaria botrytis is found in Africa ( Tunisia ) , Australia , Asia ( including the eastern Himalayas of India , Nepal , Japan , Korea , Pakistan , China , the Far East of Russia , and Turkey ) and Europe ( including the Netherlands , France , Portugal , Italy , Bulgaria , and Spain ) . It is also present in Mexico and in Guatemala . Widely distributed in North America , it is most common in the southeast and along the Pacific Coast . The variety R. botrytis var. aurantiiramosa , limited in distribution to Lewis County , Washington , associates with Douglas fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii ) and western hemlock ( Tsuga heterophylla ) . Variety compactospora is known from Sardinia , Italy , where it has been found growing in sandy soil in forests comprising strawberry tree ( Arbutus <unk> ) , tree heath ( Erica arborea ) , and holm oak ( Quercus ilex ) . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Ramaria botrytis is an edible species , and some rate it as choice . Its taste is " slight " , or " fruity " , and has been likened to sauerkraut , green peanuts ( fresh harvested peanuts that have not been dehydrated ) , or pea pods . Older fruit bodies develop an acidic flavor . It is sold in food markets in Japan as <unk> @-@ take , and harvested from the wild in Korea and Nepal . The thick base and main branches require longer cooking than the smaller branchlets . In the <unk> region of central Italy , the mushroom is stewed , or pickled in oil . Fruit bodies can be preserved by slicing thinly and drying . One field guide rates the edibility as " questionable " , warning of the possible danger of confusing specimens with the poisonous Ramaria formosa . Other authors warn that some individuals may experience laxative effects from consuming the mushroom . Caution is advised when collecting fruit bodies near polluted areas , as the species is known to bioaccumulate toxic arsenic . 
 Chemical analysis shows R. botrytis to have a food energy value of 154 kilojoules per 100 grams of fresh fruit bodies , which is comparable to the 120 – 150 kJ range reported for commercially grown edible mushrooms . As a percentage of dry matter , the fruit bodies contain 39 @.@ 0 % crude protein , 1 @.@ 4 % lipids , 50 @.@ 8 % carbohydrates , and 8 @.@ 8 % ash . The majority of the lipid content comprises oleic ( 43 @.@ 9 % ) , linoleic ( 38 @.@ 3 % ) , and palmitic ( 9 @.@ 9 % ) fatty acids .

 In a 2009 study of 16 Portuguese edible wild mushroom species , R. botrytis was shown to have the highest concentration of phenolic acids ( 356 @.@ 7 mg per kg of fresh fruit body ) , made up largely of <unk> acid ; it also had the highest antioxidant capacity . Phenolic compounds — common in fruits and vegetables — are being scientifically investigated for their potential health benefits associated with reduced risk of chronic and degenerative diseases .

 = Poena cullei = 
 Poena cullei ( from Latin ' punishment of the sack ' ) under Roman law was a type of death penalty imposed on a subject who had been found guilty of parricide . The punishment consisted of being sewn up in a leather sack , sometimes with an assortment of live animals , and then being thrown into water . The punishment may have varied widely in its frequency and precise form during the Roman period . For example , the earliest fully documented case is from ca . <unk> , although scholars think the punishment may have developed about a century earlier ( earlier than that , murderers , including parricides , would be handed over to the aggrieved family for punishment , rather than punishment being enacted by Roman state officials ) . Inclusion of live animals in the sack is only documented from Early Imperial times , and at the beginning , only snakes are mentioned . At the time of Emperor Hadrian ( 2nd century CE ) , the most well known form of the punishment was documented , where a cock , a dog , a monkey and a viper were inserted in the sack . However , at the time of Hadrian poena cullei was made into an optional form of punishment for parricides ( the alternate being thrown to the beasts in the arena ) . During the 3rd century CE up to the accession of Emperor Constantine , poena cullei fell out of use ; Constantine revived it , now with only serpents to be added in the sack . Well over 200 years later , Emperor Justinian reinstituted the punishment with the four animals , and poena cullei remained the statutory penalty for parricides within Byzantine law for the next 400 years , when it was replaced with the punishment for parricides to be burnt alive instead . 
 Poena cullei gained a revival of sorts in late medieval and early modern Germany , with late cases of being drowned in a sack along with live animals being documented from Saxony in the first half of the 18th century . 
 = = Execution ritual = = 
 The 19th @-@ century historian Theodor Mommsen compiled and described in detail the various elements that at one time or another have been asserted as elements within the ritualistic execution of a parricide during the Roman Era . The following paragraph is based on that description , it is not to be regarded as a static ritual that always was observed , but as a descriptive enumeration of elements gleaned from several sources written over a period of several centuries . Mommsen , for example , notes that the monkey hardly can have been an ancient element in the execution ritual . 
 The person was first whipped , or beaten , with <unk> sanguinis ( " blood @-@ colored rods " , probably ) , and his head was clad / covered in a bag made of a wolf 's hide . On his feet were placed clogs , or wooden shoes , and he was then put into the poena cullei , a sack made of ox @-@ leather . Placed along with him into the sack was also an assortment of live animals , arguably the most famous combination being that of a serpent , a cock , a monkey and a dog . The sack was put on a cart , and the cart driven by black oxen to a running stream or to the sea . Then , the sack with its inhabitants was thrown into the water . 
 Other variations occur , and some of the Latin phrases have been interpreted differently . For example , in his early work De <unk> , Cicero says the criminal 's mouth was covered by a <unk> bag , rather than a wolf 's hide . He also says the person was held in prison until the large sack was made ready , whereas at least one modern author believes the sack , culleus , involved , would have been one of the large , very common sacks Romans transported wine in , so that such a sack would have been readily available . According to the same author , such a wine sack had a volume of 144 @.@ 5 US gallons ( 547 l ) . 
 Another point of contention concerns precisely how , and by what means , the individual was beaten . In his 1920 essay " The Lex Pompeia and the Poena <unk> " , Max Radin observes that , as expiation , convicts were typically flogged until they bled ( so some commentators translates the phrase to " beaten with rods till he bleeds " ) , but that it might very well be that the rods themselves were painted red . Radin also points to a third option , namely that the " rods " actually were some type of shrub , since it documented from other sources that whipping with some kinds of shrub was thought to be purifying in nature . 
 = = <unk> Malleolus = = 
 The picture gained of the ritual above is compiled from sources ranging in their generally agreed upon dates of composition from the first century BCE , to the sixth century CE , that is , over a period of six to seven hundred years . Different elements are mentioned in the various sources , so that the actual execution ritual at any one particular time may have been substantially distinct from that ritual performed at other times . For example , the <unk> ad Herennium , a treatise by an unknown author from about 90 BCE details the execution of a <unk> Malleolus , found guilty of murdering his own mother , along with citing the relevant law as follows : 
 Another law says : " He who has been convicted of murdering his parent shall be completely wrapped and bound in a leather sack and thrown in a running stream " ... Malleolus was convicted of matricide . Immediately after he had received sentence , his head was wrapped in a bag of wolf 's hide , the " wooden shoes " were put upon his feet and he was led away to prison . His defenders bring tablets into the jail , write his will in his presence , witnesses duly attending . The penalty is exacted of him 
 As can be seen from the above , in this early reference , no mention is made of live animals as co @-@ inhabitants within the sack , nor is the mention of any initial whipping contained , nor that Malleolus , contained within the sack , was transported to the river in a cart driven by black oxen . 
 The Roman historian Livy places the execution of Malleolus to just about 10 years earlier than the composition of <unk> ad Herennium ( i.e. , roughly 100 BCE ) and claims , furthermore , that Malleolus was the first in Roman history who was convicted to be sewn into a sack and thrown into the water , on account of parricide .
