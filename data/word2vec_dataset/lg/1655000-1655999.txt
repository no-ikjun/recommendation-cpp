 I was to keep the fish before me in a tin tray , and occasionally moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar ... In ten minutes I had seen all that could be seen in that fish , and started in search of the Professor – who had , however , left the Museum ; and when I returned , after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment , my specimen was dry all over . I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast from a fainting fit , and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance . This little excitement over , nothing was done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion . 
 Scudder provides the additional detail that " instruments of all kinds were interdicted " , including any magnifying glass . After several hours Agassiz asks for a report and Scudder describes " the fringed gill @-@ arches and moveable operculum ; the pores of the head , fleshy lips and lidless eyes ; the lateral line , the spinous fins and forked tail ; the compressed and arched body . " Disappointed , Agassiz informs his student that he has failed to observe " the most conspicuous features of the animal " and commands him to " look again , look again ! " The mortified Scudder is eventually asked to consider overnight what he has seen , and is able to report to Agassiz the following morning that " the fish has symmetrical sides with paired organs , " which was the observation Agassiz was looking for . However , when Scudder then asked what he should do next , Agassiz replied , " Oh , look at your fish ! " which Scudder did for another two full days .

 In 1917 , English professor Lane Cooper from Cornell University published a collection of reminiscences of Agassiz . The book included notes from several notable contributors , including Scudder and Cooper , William James , Professor Addison Emery Verrill ( " [ Agassiz 's ] plan was to make young students depend on natural objects rather than on statements in books " ) , and Professor Edward S. Morse , who wrote that Agassiz 's method was " simply to let the student study intimately one object at a time . " Cooper prefigures Pound 's interest by remarking on the " close , though not obvious , relation between investigation in biology or zoology and the observation and comparison of these organic forms which we call form of literature and works of art " , concluding that " We study a poem , the work of man 's art , in the same way that Agassiz made Shaler study a fish . " Critic Robert Scholes concludes that Pound had access to this book and used the material within it as the source for the parable that opens ABC of Reading .

 Science historian Mary P. Winsor provides extensive commentary on Agassiz 's initial assignments for his students . The solution to the " riddle " , as she calls it , lies in a similar anecdote given by Agassiz in his Essay on Classification : 
 Suppose that the innumerable articulated animals , which are counted by tens of thousands , nay , perhaps by hundreds of thousands , had never made their appearance upon the surface of the globe , with one single exception : that , for instance , our Lobster ( Homarus americanus ) were the only representative of that extraordinarily diversified type , — how should we introduce that species of animals in our systems ? 
 Agassiz provides several potential solutions : the species of lobster could have a single genus " by the side of all the other classes with their orders , families , etc . " , or a family with one genus and one species , or a class with one order and one genus , etc . Agassiz concludes a single species is sufficient to derive the entirety of the hierarchy : at the time , this would have been " a distinct genus , a distinct family , a distinct class , a distinct branch . " The point of the sunfish is not observing characteristics that distinguish individuals , species and genus , but rather characteristics that are held in common higher up the taxonomic hierarchy . Scudder 's observation that finally satisfies Agassiz is that the sunfish has bilateral , paired organs ; a characteristic that Winsor notes is common to all vertebrates . 
 = = = Pound = = = 
 Pound , echoing Cooper , opens ABC of Reading by stating that the correct method for the study of poetry is " the method of contemporary biologists " and that " No man is equipped for modern thinking until he has understood the anecdote of Agassiz and the fish . " Commentators have summarized Pound 's position with the term empiricism , but have divided over whether the parable endorses or indicts the idea . 
 The simplest interpretations in scientific writing , history of science , and literary criticism take the parable at face value , accepting empiricism and observation as legitimate techniques . For example , when writing about stellar atmospheres , Dimitri <unk> states that " it is specimens , not facts , that are the ultimate empirical currency that we must use if we wish to purchase a valid theory " before beginning a discussion of Pound 's sunfish . 
 Moving from acceptance of empiricism to an understanding of its limitations , Christopher Tilley emphasizes in his comments on " scientific archeology " that Pound 's student " was not simply learning about ' reality ' , the sunfish , but a way of approaching that reality – a discourse bound up in a particular thought tradition ( empiricism ) " . Robert Scholes reaches a similar conclusion , noting that the student " seems to be reporting about a real and solid world in a perfectly transparent language , but actually he is learning how to produce a specific kind of discourse , controlled by a particular scientific paradigm " . 
 Author Bob Perelman takes the suspicion of empiricism one step further in his 1994 The Trouble With Genius : Reading Pound , Joyce , Stein , and <unk> . Perelman discusses the parable as one of two anecdotes in ABC of Reading that frame Pound 's discussion of Chinese ideograms . The former describes attendance at two hypothetical concerts : one of Debussy and another of Ravel . Pound states that a person who attended both concerts knows more about the composers than someone who has only read " ALL of the criticisms that have ever been written of both " . Perelman considers the contradiction between " everyone " and " knowledge " to be the key to Pound 's thinking : only a gifted or lucky few are able to apprehend the truth ( whether by attending the concert or observing the specimen ) ; the rest can only make do with " a fog of clichés , received ideas , second @-@ hand and second @-@ rate opinions , written darkness . " With regard to the parable , Perelman observes the lack of " scientific institutions , pedagogic procedures , or communicable terminologies " where any mediating written descriptions ( " sunfish " , " <unk> " ) only serve to obscure knowledge . Knowledge ultimately resides within Agassiz rather than the world , and " [ w ] hat looks initially like a commitment to empiricism has led instead to an authoritarian idealism . " 
 Two critics have also commented on the parable 's implications in describing the nature of knowledge in terms of the decay of Pound 's fish . Celeste Goodridge notes that Marianne Moore 's 1934 review of Pound 's Cantos uses a detailed metaphor of a grasshopper wing to describe the conversations therein . In Goodridge 's opinion , Moore 's " microscopic examination " both undercuts the work as well as " pays homage , in its precision , to Pound 's reverence for ' the applicability of scientific method to literary criticism . ' " Goodridge then reproduces the parable in full and comments , " Agassiz teaches Pound that all knowledge is necessarily fragmented and does not constitute a whole . " Knowledge of the fish cannot begin until decay has commenced , reducing the specimen to its constituent parts . 
 Peter Nicholas Baker reaches a fundamentally different conclusion . He begins the discussion of the parable by first quoting Pound on the topic of genius : 
 The genius can pay in nugget and in lump gold ; it is not necessary that he bring up his knowledge into the mint of consciousness , stamp it either into the coin of conscientiously analyzed form @-@ detail knowledge or into the paper money of words before he transmit it . 
 Baker finds the most striking feature of the parable to be the absence of description of the fish . Baker asks : " Do readers of this anecdote learn about the fish , or rather about a certain kind of authoritarian teaching practice ? " Baker claims that Pound 's images of coining metal are just as unrealistic as his ideas regarding science and the scientific method . The reader , following Pound 's student , reaches knowledge through intuition alone ; the decomposing fish , so far as epistemology is concerned , has become " transparent " . 
 = Rheinmetall 120 mm gun = 
 The Rheinmetall 120 mm gun is a smoothbore tank gun designed and produced by the West German Rheinmetall @-@ <unk> AG company , developed in response to Soviet advances in armor technology and development of new armored threats . Production began in 1974 , with the first version of the gun , known as the L / 44 as it was 44 calibers long , used on the German Leopard 2 tank and soon produced under license for the American M1A1 Abrams and other tanks . The American version , the M256 , uses a coil spring recoil system instead of a hydraulic system . The 120 @-@ millimetre ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) gun has a length of 5 @.@ 28 metres ( 17 @.@ 3 ft ) , and the gun system weighs approximately 3 @,@ 317 kilograms ( 7 @,@ 313 lb ) . 
 By 1990 , the L / 44 was not considered powerful enough to deal with the future Soviet armour , which stimulated an effort by Rheinmetall to develop a better main armament . This first revolved around a 140 @-@ millimetre ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) tank gun named Neue <unk> 140 ( " new tank gun 140 " ) , but later turned into a compromise which led to the development of an advanced 120 mm gun , the L / 55 , based on the same internal geometry as the L / 44 and installed in the same breech and mount . The L / 55 is 1 @.@ 3 metres ( 4 @.@ 3 ft ) longer , giving an increased muzzle velocity to ammunition fired through it . As the L / 55 retains the same barrel geometry , it can fire the same ammunition as the L / 44 . 
 This gun was retrofitted into German and Dutch Leopard 2s , and chosen as the main gun of the Spanish Leopard 2E and the Greek Leopard <unk> . It was tested on the British Challenger 2 as a potential replacement for its current weapon , the rifled <unk> 120 mm cannon . 
 A variety of ammunition has been developed for use by tanks with guns based on Rheinmetall 's original L / 44 design . This includes a series of kinetic energy penetrators , such as the American M829 series , and chemical energy anti @-@ tank warheads . Recent ammunition includes a wide range of new anti @-@ personnel rounds and demolition munitions , giving tanks armed with the L / 44 and its derivatives greater versatility on the modern battlefield . The LAHAT , developed in Israel , is a gun @-@ launched missile which has received interest from Germany and other Leopard 2 users , and is designed to defeat both land armour and combat helicopters . The Israelis also introduced a new anti @-@ personnel munition which limits collateral damage by controlling the fragmentation of the projectile . 
 = = Background = = 
 Because of concerns about the inability of the 105 @-@ millimetre ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) L7 tank gun then in use across NATO forces to penetrate new Soviet armor , as proved in German tests on four T @-@ 62 Soviet tanks captured by Israel following the June 1967 Six Day War , Rheinmetall was paid for the development of a new tank gun , a project started in 1965 , as the Bundeswehr felt a more powerful gun was needed for its new tanks . The first instance of a larger Soviet tank gun was witnessed on the chassis of a modified T @-@ 55 in 1961 . In 1965 , the Soviet Union 's T @-@ 62 made its first public appearance , armed with a 115 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 5 in ) smoothbore tank gun . The Soviet decision to increase the power of its tank 's main armament had come when , in the early 1960s , an Iranian tank commander defected over the Soviet border in a brand @-@ new M60 Patton tank , which was armed with the British Royal Ordnance L7 . Despite the introduction of the T @-@ 62 , in 1969 their T @-@ 64 tank was rearmed with a new 125 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 9 in ) tank gun , while in 1972 Nizhny <unk> began production of the T @-@ 72 tank , also armed with the 125 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 9 in ) gun . For example , at the fighting at Sultan <unk> , during the 1982 Lebanon War , the Israeli government claimed to have destroyed nine Syrian T @-@ 72s with the Merkava main battle tank , armed with an Israeli production version of the American M68 105 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) tank gun ( which in turn was based on the British L7 ) . Whether or not true , the Soviets test @-@ fired a number of Israeli <unk> Hetz armor @-@ piercing discarding sabot rounds at Kubinka , finding the 105 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) round was able to perforate the T @-@ 72 's sloped front section plate but not its turret armor . In response , the Soviets developed the T @-@ <unk> . This led Israel to opt for a 120 mm tank gun during the development process of the Merkava III main battle tank . This case is similar to the American decision to replace the M68 105 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) tank gun with Rheinmetall 's 120 mm gun in 1976 ; the introduction of the T @-@ 64A had raised the question within the armor community whether the new ammunition for the existing gun caliber could effectively deal with the new Soviet tank . 
 In 1963 , Germany and the United States had already embarked on a joint tank program , known as the MBT @-@ 70 . The new tank carried a three @-@ man crew , with the driver in the turret , an automatic loader for the main gun , a 20 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) autocannon as secondary armament , an active hydropneumatic suspension and spaced armour on the glacis plate and the front turret . The new tank concept also had improved armament , a 152 @-@ millimeter ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) missile @-@ launching main gun , designed to fire the MGM @-@ 51 Shillelagh anti @-@ tank missile . However , the German Army was interested in a tank gun which could fire conventional ammunition . Although there were attempts to modify the 152 @-@ millimeter ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) tank gun to do so , the process proved extremely difficult , and the Germans began development of the future Rheinmetall 120 mm gun instead . 
 In 1967 , the German Ministry of Defense decided to re @-@ open a Leopard 1 improvement program , known as the <unk> Leopard ( " Gilded Leopard " ) , later renamed the <unk> ( " Wild Boar " ) . Krauss @-@ Maffei was chosen as the contractor , and two prototypes were developed in 1969 and 1970 . This program grew into the Leopard 2 ; the first prototype of the new tank was delivered in 1972 , equipped with a 105 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) smoothbore main gun . Between 1972 and 1975 , a total of 17 prototypes were developed . The new 120 mm gun 's ten @-@ year development effort , which had begun in 1964 , ended in 1974 . Ten of the 17 turrets built were equipped with the 105 mm smoothbore gun , and the other seven were equipped with the larger 120 mm gun . Another program aimed to mount the 152 @-@ millimeter ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) missile @-@ gun was also developed in an attempt to save components from the MBT @-@ 70 , but in 1971 the program was ended for economic reasons . Instead , the Germans opted for Rheinmetall 's 120 mm L / 44 smoothbore tank gun .

 Rheinmetall 's L / 44 tank gun has a caliber of 120 mm , and a length of 44 calibers ( 5 @.@ 28 meters ( 17 @.@ 3 ft ) ) .

 Production of the German Leopard 2 and the new 120 mm tank gun began in 1979 , fulfilling an order for the German Army . Although the American M1 Abrams was originally armed with the <unk> 105 mm gun ( a version of the L7 ) , the United States Army had planned to fit the tank with a larger main gun at a later date , and the tank 's turret had been designed to accommodate a larger 120 mm gun . The larger gun was integrated into the M1A1 Abrams , with the first vehicle coming off the production line in 1985 The gun , known as the M256 , was based on the L / 44 tank gun , although manufactured at Watervliet Arsenal and modified to increase the resistance of the barrels to fracture and fatigue . Tanks armed with versions of Rheinmetall 's gun produced under licence include Japan 's Type 90 and South Korea 's <unk> . The gun had made a huge turn in technological history .

 The appearance of new Soviet tanks such as the T @-@ 80B during the late 1970s and early 1980s demanded the development of new technologies and weapons to counter the threat posed to Western armor . The T @-@ 80B had increased firepower and a new composite ceramic armor . The T @-@ 72 also went through a modernization program in an attempt to bring it up to the standards of the T @-@ 80B . In 1985 the new T @-@ <unk> version entered production , with a new laminate armor protection system ; its turret armor , designed primarily to defeat anti @-@ tank missiles , surpassed the T @-@ 80B 's in protection . 
 The German government began the development of the Leopard 3 , although this was canceled after the fall of the Soviet Union . On 29 October 1991 , the governments of Switzerland , the Netherlands and Germany agreed to cooperate in the development of a modernization program for the Leopard 2 . Part of this program included the introduction of a longer 120 mm tank gun , a cheaper alternative to a brand new tank gun , increasing the maximum range of the gun by an estimated 1 @,@ 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 yd ) . Although the gun is longer , allowing for a higher peak pressure from the propellant , the geometry remains the same , allowing the gun to fire the same ammunition as that fired from the shorter version . The longer barrel allows ammunition to attain higher velocities ; for example , with new kinetic energy penetrators ammunition can reach velocities of around 1 @,@ 800 m / s ( 5 @,@ 900 ft / s ) . The new barrel weighs 1 @,@ 347 kg ( 2 @,@ 970 lb ) . 
 The longer tank gun has been retrofitted into the Leopard 2 , creating a model known as the Leopard 2A6 . Both the Spanish Leopard 2E and the Greek Leopard <unk> , as derivatives of the Leopard 2A6 , use the 55 caliber @-@ long tank gun . 
 = = Ammunition = = 
 A variety of rounds have been developed for Rheinmetall 's tank gun . For example , a long line of armor @-@ piercing discarding sabot ( <unk> ) rounds was developed by Rheinmetall . Originally , the Leopard 2 was outfitted with the <unk> kinetic energy penetrator , based on the Israeli <unk> Hetz . The <unk> was eventually replaced by the <unk> , which was also adopted by Japan , Italy , Netherlands and Switzerland . The <unk> has a three @-@ part aluminum sabot and a two @-@ part tungsten penetrator , and is said to be able to penetrate 560 millimetres ( 22 in ) of steel armor at a range of 2 @,@ 000 meters ( 2 @,@ 200 yd ) . The <unk> is a further development of this round , co @-@ developed between Germany and France . The introduction of the longer barrel came hand in hand with the introduction of a new kinetic energy penetrator , the <unk> . With the projectile including sabot weighing in at 8 @.@ 35 kilograms with a 38 : 1 length to diameter ratio and with a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 750 meters per second ( 5 @,@ 700 ft / s ) , the <unk> has an effective engagement range of up to 4 @,@ 000 meters ( 4 @,@ 400 yd ) . A further development , called the DM63 , improved upon the round by introducing a new temperature @-@ independent propellant , which allows the propellant to have a constant pattern of expansion between ambient temperatures inside the gun barrel from − 47 ° C ( − 53 ° F ) to + 71 ° C ( 160 ° F ) . The new propellant powders , known as surface @-@ coated double @-@ base ( <unk> ) propellants , allow the DM63 to be used in many climates with consistent results . The new ammunition has been accepted into service with the Dutch and Swiss , as well as German , armies . 
 The United States developed its own kinetic energy penetrator ( KEP ) tank round in the form of an Armor @-@ Piercing Fin @-@ Stabilized Discarding @-@ <unk> ( APFSDS ) round , using a depleted uranium ( DU ) alloy long @-@ rod penetrator ( LRP ) , designated as the M829 , followed by improved versions . An immediate improvement , known as the <unk> , was called the " Silver Bullet " after its good combat performance during the Gulf War against Iraqi T @-@ 55s , T @-@ 62s and T @-@ 72 tanks . The M829 series centers around the depleted uranium penetrator , designed to penetrate enemy armor through kinetic energy and to shatter inside the turret , doing much damage within the tank . In 1998 , the United States military introduced the <unk> , which has an improved depleted uranium penetrator and composite sabot petals . In 2002 , production began of the ( $ 10 @,@ 000 per round ) <unk> using a more efficient propellant ( RPD @-@ 380 stick ) , a lighter injection @-@ molded sabot , and a longer ( <unk> ) and heavier ( 10 kg / 22 lb ) DU penetrator , which is said to be able to defeat the latest versions of Russian Kontakt @-@ 5 explosive reactive armor ( ERA ) . This variant is unofficially referred to by Abrams tank crews as the " super sabot " . In response to the <unk> , the Russian army designed <unk> , the most modern Russian ERA , which is claimed to be twice as effective as Kontakt @-@ 5 . A further improved <unk> round with a segmented penetrator to defeat <unk> has been under development since 2011 and was to be fielded as the <unk> in 2015 . 
 Both Germany and the United States have developed several other rounds . These include the German <unk> multi @-@ purpose anti @-@ tank projectile ( MPAT ) , based on the technology in a high explosive anti @-@ tank ( HEAT ) warhead . However , it has been found that the <unk> 's armor @-@ killing abilities are limited by the lack of blast and fragmentation effects , and that the round is less valuable against lightly armored targets . The United States also has a MPAT type projectile , known as the <unk> . This was later developed into the <unk> , which allows the M1 Abrams to use the round against helicopters . The M1 Abrams can use the <unk> canister round , which is an anti @-@ personnel / anti @-@ helicopter munition , packed with over 1 @,@ 000 tungsten balls . The United States Armed Forces accepted a new demolition round , called the <unk> Obstacle Defeating Round , based on the <unk> MPAT , but with the proximity fuse replaced by a hardened nose cap . The cap allows the round to impact and embed itself in concrete , then exploding inside the target and causing more damage . 
 The Israeli Army introduced a new round known as the Laser Homing Anti @-@ Tank ( LAHAT ) projectile . Using a semi @-@ active laser homing guidance method , the LAHAT can be guided by the tank 's crew or by teams on the ground , while the missile 's trajectory can be selected to either attack from the top ( to defeat enemy armor ) or direct attack ( to engage enemy helicopters ) . Furthermore , the missile can be fired by both 105 @-@ millimeter ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) and 120 mm tank guns . The LAHAT has been offered as an option for the Leopard 2 , and has been marketed by both Israel Military Industries and Rheinmetall to Leopard 2 users . Israeli <unk> make use of a round known as the <unk> , which is an anti @-@ personnel munition designed to release fragmentation at controlled intervals to limit the extent of damage . Fragments are shaped to have enough kinetic energy to penetrate body armor . 
 Poland has introduced a series of projectiles for Rheinmetall 's tank gun , including an armor @-@ piercing penetrator target practice round ( APFSDS @-@ T @-@ TP ) , a high @-@ explosive round , and a high @-@ explosive target practice ( HE @-@ TP ) projectile . The ammunition is manufactured by Zakłady <unk> <unk> Sp. z o.o.

 Due to tank sales , Rheinmetall 's L / 44 tank gun has been manufactured for other nations . For example , the Leopard 2 armed with the 44 caliber long gun , has been sold to the Netherlands , Switzerland , Sweden , Spain , Austria , Denmark , Finland , and other countries . Egypt had manufactured 700 – 800 M1A1 Abrams by 2005 , and in 2008 requested permission to build another 125 tanks ; their M256 main guns ( the US version of the L / 44 ) were manufactured by Watervliet Arsenal . The M1A1 has also been exported to Australia , while the M1A2 Abrams has been exported to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait . The American license @-@ built M256 has also been offered by General Dynamics Land Systems as part of the M60 @-@ 2000 Main Battle Tank which would upgrade older M60 Patton tanks to have capabilities of their M1A1 Abrams at a reduced cost , though the company has not yet found a buyer . 
 The Leopard 2A6 and its longer L / 55 main gun have been exported for use by the Canadian Army , and the Netherlands upgraded part of its original fleet of Leopard 2s with the more powerful armament . The British Army has tested Rheinmetall 's longer gun , possibly looking to replace the current <unk> 120 mm L / 55 rifled main gun on the Challenger 2 . Two Challenger 2s were modified to undergo firing trials . World Industries Ace Corporation ( <unk> ) , a Korea @-@ based powertrain company affiliated with Hyundai Kia Motors Group , is also producing the L / 55 under license for the new K2 Black Panther , a fourth generation South Korean main battle tank . 
 = Tyntesfield = 
 Tyntesfield is a Victorian Gothic Revival house and estate near Wraxall , North Somerset , England . The house is a Grade I listed building named after the Tynte baronets , who had owned estates in the area since about 1500 . The location was formerly that of a 16th @-@ century hunting lodge , which was used as a farmhouse until the early 19th century . In the 1830s a Georgian mansion was built on the site , which was bought by English businessman William Gibbs , whose huge fortune came from guano used as fertilizer . In the 1860s Gibbs had the house significantly expanded and remodelled ; a chapel was added in the 1870s . The Gibbs family owned the house until the death of Richard Gibbs in 2001 . 
 Tyntesfield was purchased by the National Trust in June 2002 , after a fundraising campaign to prevent it being sold to private interests and ensure it would be open to the public . The house was opened to visitors for the first time just 10 weeks after the acquisition , and as more rooms are restored they are added to the tour . 
 The mansion was visited by 216 @,@ 759 people in 2014 , a rise of 1 per cent on the previous year .

 The land on which the house and its estate were developed was originally part of the Tynte family estate . The family had lived in the area since the 1500s , but their primary residence was Halswell House in Goathurst , near Bridgwater . 
 By the late 1700s , John Tynte owned what is now the Tyntesfield estate ; at that time the house was approached by an avenue of elm trees , planted after they were bequeathed in the 1678 will of Sir Charles Harbord to the people of Wraxall in memory of two boys he had apprenticed from the village . The Tynte 's had originally lived on the estate , but by the early 1800s , John had made <unk> Court in Brockley his principal residence . Tynte 's Place was downgraded to a farmhouse and leased to John <unk> . In 1813 , George Penrose Seymour of the adjoining Belmont estate purchased the property and gave it to his son , the Rev. George Turner Seymour . He in turn built a new Georgian mansion on the site of the former Saddler 's Tenement , and demolished the old farmhouse . Further remodelling was undertaken by Robert Newton of Nailsea . 
 = = = Purchase by the Gibbs family = = = 
 In 1843 , the property was bought by businessman William Gibbs , who made his fortune in the family business , Antony Gibbs & Sons . From 1847 the firm had an effective monopoly in the import and marketing to Europe and North America of guano from Peru as a fertilizer . This was mined by indentured Chinese labour on the Chincha Islands in conditions which the Peruvian government acknowledged in 1856 had degenerated " into a kind of Negro slave trade " . The firm 's profits from this trade were such that William Gibbs became the richest non @-@ noble man in England . 
 Throughout his life , William Gibbs and his wife Matilda Blanche Crawley @-@ Boevey ( known as Blanche ) , principally lived in London , for the greater part of his marriage at 16 Hyde Park Gardens , which the family owned until Blanche 's death . But as he travelled regularly on business to the Port of Bristol he required a residence in the area ; thus it was , in 1843 , he came to buy <unk> Place , which he subsequently renamed Tyntesfield . Within a few years of making his purchase , Gibbs began a major program of rebuilding and enlarging of the mansion . 
 The architectural style selected for the rebuilding was a loose Gothic combining many forms and reinventions of the medieval style . The choice of Gothic was influenced by William and Blanche Gibb 's Anglo @-@ Catholic beliefs as a followers of the Oxford Movement . This wing of the Anglican Church advocated the view set out in the architect Augustus Pugin 's 1836 book Contrasts , which argued for the revival of the medieval Gothic style , and " a return to the faith and the social structures of the Middle Ages " . The Oxford Movement , of which both Pugin and Gibbs were disciples , later took this philosophy a step further and claimed that the Gothic style was the only architecture suitable for Christian worship . Thus it became a symbolic display of Christian beliefs and lifestyle , and was embraced by devout Victorians such as Gibbs . The completion of the mansion 's chapel further accentuated the building 's medieval <unk> air so beloved by the Oxford Movement 's devotees . When completed , the ecclesiastical design was reinforced by a dominating square tower with a steeply pitched roof adorned by four <unk> , which was demolished in 1935 . 
 = = = Redevelopment = = = 
 In 1854 William Gibbs commissioned John Gregory Crace , an architect he was already using elsewhere , to redesign and decorate the principal rooms at Tyntesfield . These new designs included gilded panelling , woodwork , moulding and chimneypieces all in the Gothic style . 
 Rebuilding work did not begin in earnest until 1863 , when William Gibbs had the property substantially remodelled in a Gothic Revival style . William Cubitt & Co. were the builders and John Norton was the architect . Norton 's design enveloped the original house . He added an extra floor , two new wings and towers . Norton emphasised the importance of architectural continuity in restoration and rebuilding relating to several historical periods . As a result , while some walls remained plain , others were adorned with Gothic and naturalistic carvings to fit in with the previous architectural styles .

 The house is built of two types of Bath Stone , and is highly picturesque , bristling with turrets and possessing an elaborate roof . The combined effect of the architecture and chosen materials has been described by journalist Sir Simon Jenkins as " severe " . During restoration , stonemasons either conserved or , on occasion , copy @-@ carving new sections , carving new mouldings to replace standard architectural elements that formed the weathering , as well repointing most of the miles of lime pointing . All stone was accurately matched to the original , with <unk> quarry near Tetbury providing Cotswold oolitic limestone . The house , which includes the servants ' wing and the chapel , was made a Grade II * listed building in 1973 , and has since been upgraded to Grade I. 
 The front ( facing east over the gardens towards Backwell Hill ) and north ( entrance courtyard ) are faced in one shade of <unk> Bath Stone , while the south ( rear ) , which is mainly allocated to the service area and servants quarters , is faced in cheaper red @-@ tinged Draycott marble rubble , and has some plastered finishes . All facades have many Gothic main windows , Tudor oriel windows , chimneys and attic dormers . Norton topped the design with an irregular roof , its various pitches and gables emphasising the building 's asymmetrical architecture . The final external addition was a huge ironwork conservatory by Hart , Son , Peard and Co. to the rear . The end result was described by novelist Charlotte Mary Yonge , a cousin of Blanche Gibbs , as " like a church in spirit " . 
 The interiors were also in the Gothic style . Crace was again engaged to remodel the interiors , in some places extending or adapting his initial works , in others providing new schemes . Other notable features of the house are glass by Powell and Wooldridge , ironwork by Hart , Son , Peard and Co. and mosaics by Salviati . George Plucknett was Cubitt 's foreman , who was related to James Plunkett of Collier and Plucknett , furniture makers of Warwick . The result was that Gibbs ordered a number of specially commissioned pieces from the firm , including a fully fitted bathroom for his wife . All of these fine pieces of craftsmanship were added to by Gibb 's expanding collection of artworks . 
 While the reconstruction on the house was being undertaken , William Gibbs had rented <unk> Park in Devon . The total cost of redevelopment to create a house with 23 main bedrooms and 47 in total including servants ' accommodation came to £ 70 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to £ 6 @,@ 040 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) . The sum was equivalent to 18 months gross profit from all of Gibbs 's business interests . After completion of the main building works , Gibbs created more cash by selling shares in Antony Gibbs & Sons to his nephew Henry Hucks Gibbs ( later Lord Aldenham ) , which enabled him to purchase two adjoining properties – including Belmont to the east from his nephew George Lewis Monck Gibbs – to create a farming estate , founded on dairy production and forestry management . Added to further by later land purchases , at its peak the Tyntesfield estate spanned over 6 @,@ 000 acres ( 2 @,@ 400 ha ) , encompassing 1 @,@ 000 acres ( 400 ha ) of forestry , from Portishead in the north to south of the valley in which the main house lay . The house and estate employed more than 500 workers . 
 = = = Chapel = = = 
 Gibbs ' final addition to Tyntesfield was added between 1872 and 1877 , when he commissioned Arthur Blomfield to add a Gothic chapel to the north side of the house . Modelled on Sainte @-@ Chapelle in Paris , it housed an organ by William Hill & Sons , and below a vault in which Gibbs intended to be buried . However , combined opposition from both the vicar of the local All Saints Church , Wraxall and the church 's patron , a member of the Gorges family , led to the Bishop of Bath and Wells decreeing that he would not sanction the consecration of Tyntesfield 's chapel , through fears that it would take power away from the local population fully into Gibb 's hands . Despite this , the chapel formed a central part of life at Tyntesfield , and prayers were said twice @-@ daily by the family and their guests . Throughout their period of residence , the family would also open the chapel to local people on an annual basis , often during Rogation days and at Christmas . In praise of the resultant final building , Yonge described the chapel as the final completion of the Tyntesfield project , providing " a character to the household almost resembling that of Little Gidding " . Little Gidding in Huntingdonshire was the home of Nicholas Ferrar during the reign of Charles I who was much idealized by 19th @-@ century Anglo @-@ Catholics .

 Seven children were born to William and Matilda . All were devout Anglicans , with William and his wife being supporters of the Oxford Movement . He was a major benefactor of Keble College , Oxford , and dedicated the later part of his life to philanthropic works . Also being teetotal , he added to the estate 's holding by buying the local Failand Inn , which enabled him to control any riotous behaviour ( it was sold to Courage Brewery in 1962 by the second Lord Wraxall ) . William Gibbs died in the house on 3 April 1875 . After a service at the estate chapel on 9 April , 30 estate workers carried his coffin to All Saints Church , Wraxall . He is buried within the family plot in the church grounds . 
 = = = Antony Gibbs : 1875 – 1907 = = = 
 The estate then passed to William 's eldest son Antony . After graduating with a Master of Arts degree from Exeter College , Oxford , he joined the North Somerset Yeomanry where he attained the rank of Major . He married Janet Louisa Merivale on 22 June 1872 , and returned to Tyntesfield to manage the family estate . Antony held various positions of authority , including Justice of the Peace and later Deputy Lieutenant of Somerset . The couple had 10 children . 
 During the 1880s , Antony had Henry <unk> redesign the hallway staircase . This allowed more light to permeate the lower floors from the glazed lantern roof , and hence turn the hallway into a reception room . <unk> also extended the Dining Room by taking in part of the original housekeeper 's room . Crace 's original wallpaper – a British imitation of Japanese paper , that itself imitated Spanish tooled leather – was lightened by a 14 @-@ year @-@ old apprentice who hand @-@ painted in a cream background . The sideboard , which had been commissioned from Collier and Plucknett , was further extended . New items were also ordered from Collier and Plucknett . Simultaneously , Antony had electricity installed , an early UK example of houses being lit in this way . Antony spent the first night after turning on the electrical system watching the main entrance light , to ensure that it did not create a fire and was hence safe for his family . At some point between 1868 and 1884 a water hydraulic lift was installed by <unk> and Co . , the remains of which were discovered in 2008 . A wooden lift car was discovered on the ground floor and a 55 @-@ inch ( 1 @,@ 400 mm ) spanning sheave in the roof space . 
 = = = George Abraham Gibbs , 1st Baron Wraxall : 1907 – 31 = = = 
 George Abraham Gibbs , 1st Baron Wraxall served as a colonel in the North Somerset Yeomanry and served heroically in the Boer War campaign . On his return to England he married the Hon. Victoria Florence de Burgh Long ; the couple moved to <unk> St George in Devon . Between 1918 and 1928 , he served as MP for Bristol West and was elevated to the peerage as Baron Wraxall in 1928 , for which his appointment as Treasurer of the Household had been instrumental . 
 Under his ownership , the Drawing Room was redecorated in a Renaissance Venetian style , In the process , Crace 's stencilling was over painted and then covered by <unk> silk , the Norton fireplace was removed , the furniture replaced with Edwardian pieces , and the carpet dyed by <unk> . In 1917 , to assist the war effort , the ironwork conservatory was razed , and its ironwork melted down for ammunition . 
 Survived by a daughter , Albina , George 's first wife died at Tyntesfield from influenza in 1920 . In 1927 , George married Ursula Mary Lawley , a daughter of Sir Arthur Lawley ( later the 6th and last Baron Wenlock ) . The couple had two sons , George ( known as Richard ) and Eustace . George died at Tyntesfield on 28 October 1931 , aged 58 . 
 = = = Ursula , Lady Wraxall : 1931 – 79 = = = 
 Lord Wraxall 's widow , Ursula , Lady Wraxall , was left with two children under two years of age , little income , and a large estate . Noted for her efficiency and practicality , when the clock tower , the focal point of the house , needed substantial repairs in 1935 to overcome dry and wet rot , she simply had it disassembled , stored the metal parts for possible later usage and realigned the roof as if the clock tower had never existed . 
 During the Second World War , Clifton High School was relocated to the property , and in 1941 the U.S. Army Medical Corps established a facility for wounded soldiers , known as the 74th General Hospital , in the estate grounds . The construction of this temporary tented village resulted in the US Army Engineers breaching what was then England 's longest holly hedge . With many tents later replaced by prefabricated buildings and some nissen huts , at one point in the war following D @-@ Day it became the largest US Army hospital in Europe . During the hostilities , management of the estate 's farmland was assumed by the Ministry of Agriculture ( MoA ) , leaving Lady Wraxall only the Home Farm . 
 Bombs often landed on the estate during the blitz of Bristol . In September 1940 , during a raid on the Bristol Aeroplane Company factory at Filton , bombs cut off the estate 's water supply , and during a later raid , one bomb badly damaged the lantern roof light over the hallway . In 1946 , after the end of the war , Lady Wraxall applied to the Ministry of Defence for a repair grant , but was turned down . As a result damp , and latterly birds , entered the house through the roof light , until the house came into the ownership of the National Trust and was repaired .

 George Richard Lawley Gibbs , known as Richard , was born on 16 May 1928 , and was educated at Eton College and Sandhurst . He spent eight years with the Coldstream Guards . He never married and was succeeded by his brother , Sir Eustace Gibbs , a diplomat , who became the third Baron Wraxall . 
 Richard died unmarried in 2001 from complications arising from an asthma attack , having reduced his usage of the substantial accommodation within Tyntesfield to just three rooms . 
 = = National Trust purchase = = 
 Concerned with the demolition and desecration of various historic country houses since the end of the Second World War – 450 great houses were completely demolished in England between 1945 and 1955 – in the 1970s the National Trust commissioned architect Mark Girouard to catalogue and assess the remaining Victorian country houses across the United Kingdom for significance and structural integrity . He published his findings in a report , and later in the book The Victorian Country House , which in the revised second edition of 1976 included Tyntesfield as allowing access . With the Trust as a result placing Tyntesfield second on its list of priorities for preservation , Girouard said of the property : 
 There is no other Victorian country house which so richly represents its age as Tyntesfield . 
 In his later life , Richard Gibbs recognised that the diverse interests of the large family , and the need to invest heavily in even basic refurbishment of the house to make it weather @-@ secured and habitable , would require the family to sell Tyntesfield . Recognising also that substantial death duties would become payable on his death , Richard drew up a will based around a trust that would allow his fortune to pass to the surviving children of his brother and half sister , a total of 19 beneficiaries . 
 When Richard died , the trust he had set up stated that , should the trustees agree by majority that the estate should be sold , such a sale should be completed within 12 months , and to the highest bidder . The house and estate of 1 @,@ 000 acres ( 400 ha ) of farmland , 650 acres ( 260 ha ) of woodlands , plus 30 houses and cottages , were listed for sale by <unk> in three main lots ( total estimated at £ 15 million ) ; with Christie 's contracted to secure the sale of the house and estate contents via a separate auction ( total estimated at a further £ 15 million ) . 
 Having not bought a county house since the 1991 purchase of Chastleton House , which took seven years to open to the public , and competing with no special status amongst the bidders , the rumoured competitors to the Trust were listed by the media to have included composer Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber , and pop stars Madonna and Kylie Minogue . However , the new Director @-@ General of the National Trust , Fiona Reynolds , launched a £ 35 million appeal in May 2002 via the " Save Tyntesfield " campaign , with support from designer Laurence Llewelyn @-@ Bowen , newsreader Jon Snow and several top architects and historians . The Trust 's appeal collected £ 8 @.@ 2 million in just 100 days , with : £ 3 million + from the public ; and two substantial anonymous donations of £ 1 million and £ 4 million . The Trust also received funding from the National Heritage Memorial Fund , totaling £ 17 @.@ 4 million after negotiations with its chair , Liz Forgan , its largest single grant ever which caused some controversy . The National Lottery has earmarked a further £ 25 million for the major conservation work that is needed . 
 As a result of the auction , the former " Tyntesfield Estate " no longer exists . The National Trust purchased only the main central part of the Estate which comprises the house , the kitchen garden , and the park . The trust also sold off additional lands . The resultant preserved house and surrounding gardens sat on a total of 150 acres ( 61 ha ) of land are now simply known as Tyntesfield . Charlton Farm , is now home to Children 's Hospice South West , which provides palliative care to children with terminal illnesses . Charlton House was sold into private hands , having been since 1927 the home of the Downs School . 
 = = = Initial conservation = = = 
 After taking ownership in 2002 , National Trust staff secured the house and gardens , preserving them and the contents , and then catalogued the contents of the house which had been collected by the four generations of the family . Starting out with a staff of 30 volunteers , by 2013 the total of employed and volunteer staff exceeded 600 , more than the number engaged by any other National Trust property . 
 The initial conservation work focused around weatherproofing the house . The repair of the roof , which is 20 times the size of the average British families home , was made possible by the erection of an extensive free @-@ standing scaffold roof structure . At the height of the restoration works , 28 miles ( 45 km ) of scaffolding tubes covered the building 's entire exterior . This allowed over 18 months repairs and restoration to take place , including the final restoration of the original bold red and black tiled geometric diaper pattern . The entire property was rewired with special cabling , copper sheathed ( fire and rodent proofed ) . Much of the original lead piping was replaced and a fireproofing scheme , mainly through the design of a suitable <unk> system was designed and implemented . Interior scaffolding was installed in the 43 feet ( 13 m ) high hallway to repair the lantern <unk> , and to provide access to other high points of the interior . These initial works cost more than £ 10 million , much of which was raised through donations via the " Save Tyntesfield " campaign and the sale of lottery tickets to visitors . 
 The Trust had been reluctant to allow visitors to the house while work was underway , especially taking into account the costs of Health and Safety requirements and the delays these could cause to the essential preservation works . But the need for cash dictated the answer , and the Trust learnt that , through giving the public close access to the preservation works , they actually gave more additional donations as a result of seeing where their money was going and how they were making a difference .

 Principal rooms include the Library , Drawing Room , Billiard Room , Dining Room and Chapel . During restoration , the National Trust , for the first time , allowed visitors to become involved in the restoration process and " witness the challenge of bringing Tyntesfield back to life . " 
 The Library is regarded as the most important gentleman 's library in the possession of the Trust . The carpet and some of the furnishings in the Library were designed by Crace , whilst the book collection is the most extensive Victorian library collection owned by the Trust . 
 The centre of the house is occupied by the hallway and staircase , which show the greatest number of changes since the original design . 
 Once the Trust took ownership , scaffolding was placed in the hallway to repair the roof lantern . While this was in place the architectural paint analyst Lisa <unk> was able to examine the decorative scheme that had been used in the spaces and room frequented by the public . Three principal phases were identified : 1860s original ; 1870s updates and adaptions ; 1887 – 90 redecoration , which returned the main spaces to the original green colours and motifs created by Crace . Once lantern repairs were complete , the Trust replaced the elderly <unk> carpet destroyed by contractors working for Christie 's with a new Wilton carpet with a replica design by Linney Cooper , bought with £ 45 @,@ 000 from public lottery donations .

 Many of the family 's extensive collection of paintings , most sourced from Spain by William , were donated to the Trust . In part this was due to their poor condition , which involved not just water but also ironically guano damage . The most important painting in the collection is the 17th @-@ century work by Zambrano of St Lawrence , which hangs in the middle of one of the walls of the hall . It was cleaned and repaired by local art conservators Bush and Berry , who are based in a chapel William Gibbs built in the village of Flax Bourton . In 2011 the Trust bought the painting The Mater Dolorosa ( Mother of Sorrows ) by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo at Christie 's auction in New York , which had hung at Tyntesfield since William purchased it until some time after 1910 . 
 = = = Home Farm Visitor Centre = = = 
 The Home Farm buildings were built in the 1880s , split over two levels . To the south is a two @-@ storey covered yard with a timber roof structure , used for the rearing of farm animals . On the upper level is the main yard , where to the east and west are two wings , one side of which housed the former piggery . The farm offices make up the north wing , to fully enclose the square but gently south @-@ sloping yard . 
 The Grade II * listed buildings needed full renovation , which took a secondary priority in the Trust 's plans after the house . The Trust have converted the buildings into an integrated and self @-@ contained visitor centre , which opened in mid @-@ 2011 with : 
 Upper yard : 
 Ticket and information office 
 Demonstration area : country crafts from visiting crafts people 
 Plant centre : excess plants raised by the gardeners are sold to raise funds 
 Farm @-@ themed play area 
 Secondhand books stall : proceeds from which raise funds for the Trust 
 Restaurant : the former two @-@ story covered yard has been fully renovated and converted into a cafe / restaurant ; it also houses the gift shop . A new @-@ build staircase , lift and bridge walkway all in steel provide access from the upper yard 
 A separate building to the east provides power and heat to the visitor centre , using a combination of solar thermal panels , photovoltaic cells and a biomass boiler .

 = = = Kitchen garden = = = 
 The kitchen garden includes glasshouses and frames , the large classical Orangery and quarters for the gardeners . 
 = = = Orangery = = = 
 The Grade II * listed Orangery was once the architectural focal point of the kitchen garden complex . But when the Trust bought the property , the Orangery was in such a precarious state of deterioration that it was on English Heritage 's Heritage at Risk Register in the highest priority category , A. 
 Built in 1897 , it is a rare surviving example of a late Victorian orangery in the Classical style , constructed from ashlar and red brick . It has a seven @-@ bay east / west plan with central entrances and three bays north / south , topped by a fully glazed ironwork hipped @-@ roof . An entablature with protruding horizontal <unk> sits above Ionic half @-@ column supports and corner pilasters . The centre entrance bay on the west front towards the kitchen garden breaks forward as a portico , with pairs of giant engaged columns and broken pediment with a small oculus . Between each pair of columns are large round @-@ headed windows with Gibbs surrounds and keystones . 
 To preserve and restore the Orangery , the Trust teamed @-@ up with City of Bath College and Nimbus Conservation Ltd in an innovative partnership , whereby 12 trainee stonemasons worked alongside professional craftsmen to hone their skills and carry out the specialist stonework needed . The Trust also introduced workshops for other restoration professionals , academics and eventually opened them to interested members of the public , where all were educated in a hands @-@ on environment in the skills required to repair the building . For this crafts @-@ based training initiative , in 2011 the Trust won a Daily Telegraph sponsored English Heritage Angel Award . 
 The budget for the works was £ 420 @,@ 000 , with initial work focused on stabilising the foundations and lower masonry . Much of this was achieved through the injection of stabilising materials into the foundations , which needed time to cure and solidify . Works then progressed to the walls and roof , and finally the decorative embellishments . Today , while part of the Orangery is a dedicated café , the rest is an international education centre of excellence for the Trust , training new craftsmen and restoration specialists . 
 = = = Aviary = = = 
 The aviary at Tyntesfield is situated to the west of the house , adjacent to the footings of the old conservatory . It was built in 1880 to house exotic birds , but was converted into a playhouse for Doreen , the first Lord Wraxall 's daughter . The aviary is considered one of the most distinctive features of the estate , and is Grade II listed . 
 = = = Sawmill = = = 
 Located on a site originally occupied by a foreman 's office when the land was used for quarrying , the new sawmill building was completed in 1899 , providing electricity via two enclosed steam engines and pneumatic power across the estate . The engines were housed in what is now called the Engine Room , while the Lantern Room held multiple lead acid batteries . After opening , the decision was made to relocate the estate 's entire sawmill to the building , to enable better access to electrical power . The steam engines were replaced by diesel generators , and electricity was provided from the national grid post @-@ WW2 . In the 1960s , the sawmill was decommissioned and all wood sold to third party contractors to be converted into sawn wood products . 
 Under the Trust 's ownership the sawmill has been renovated and converted into a combined learning , educational and rentable function space for businesses and members of the public . It is most often used by National Trust staff and volunteers to educate visiting school groups . The building now houses the biomass boiler for the main house , which saves 141 tonnes of CO2 a year over the old oil @-@ fired boiler . Another section of the former wood shed was used as a new roost site for bat species , creating a " bat palace " . The centre was opened in May 2009 by Dame Jenny <unk> , Chair of the Heritage Lottery Fund , who partially funded the works .

 Ten of the seventeen species of UK bat are found on the property , eight within the structure of the house alone .

 Visitor access is via the main entrance on the <unk> road , which can be accessed from the M5 motorway following the signs from either junction 19 or 20 . Free parking is available 50 metres ( 160 ft ) from the Home Farm Visitor Centre and ticket office . The nearest train station is Nailsea and Backwell , which is just over 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) away . A frequent bus service runs from Bristol Bus Station . 
 The Home Farm Visitor Centre is the first point of access , and provides various services including a cafe , restaurant , shop , toilets and the ticket office . Charges for entry are made either to the estate and gardens , or the house and estate gardens . Entry to the house is via timed ticket in 30 @-@ minute entry blocks . There is a 400 @-@ metre ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) walkway from the visitor centre to the house through the gardens and some woods , or a bio @-@ diesel bus can be taken along a route via the house to the Orangery . 
 Attractions vary by season , but include six geocaching trails . Various walks focusing on wildlife and habitats are all located on public rights of way , enabling them to be access without charge throughout the year . 
 = Cat = 
 The domestic cat ( Latin : Felis catus ) or the feral cat ( Latin : Felis silvestris catus ) is a small , typically furry , carnivorous mammal . They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines . Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin . There are more than 70 cat breeds ; different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards . 
 Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids , with a strong , flexible body , quick reflexes , sharp retractable claws , and teeth adapted to killing small prey . Cat senses fit a crepuscular and predatory ecological niche . Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears , such as those made by mice and other small animals . They can see in near darkness . Like most other mammals , cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans . Cats , despite being solitary hunters , are a social species and cat communication includes the use of a variety of vocalizations ( mewing , purring , trilling , hissing , growling , and grunting ) , as well as cat pheromones and types of cat @-@ specific body language . 
 Cats have a high breeding rate . Under controlled breeding , they can be bred and shown as registered pedigree pets , a hobby known as cat fancy . Failure to control the breeding of pet cats by neutering and the abandonment of former household pets has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide , requiring population control . This has contributed , along with habitat destruction and other factors , to the extinction of many bird species . Cats have been known to extirpate a bird species within specific regions and may have contributed to the extinction of isolated island populations . Cats are thought to be primarily , though not solely , responsible for the extinction of 33 species of birds , and the presence of feral and free ranging cats makes some locations unsuitable for attempted species reintroduction in otherwise suitable locations . 
 Since cats were venerated in ancient Egypt , they were commonly believed to have been domesticated there , but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic from around 9 @,@ 500 years ago ( 7 @,@ 500 BC ) . A genetic study in 2007 concluded that domestic cats are descended from Near Eastern wildcats , having diverged around 8 @,@ 000 BC in West Asia . A 2016 study found that leopard cats were undergoing domestication independently in China around 5 @,@ 500 BC , though this line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domesticated populations of today . 
 As of a 2007 study , cats are the second most popular pet in the United States by number of pets owned , behind the first , which is freshwater fish . 
 = = Taxonomy and evolution = = 
 The felids are a rapidly evolving family of mammals that share a common ancestor only 10 – 15 million years ago and include lions , tigers , cougars and many others . Within this family , domestic cats ( Felis catus ) are part of the genus Felis , which is a group of small cats containing about seven species ( depending upon classification scheme ) . Members of the genus are found worldwide and include the jungle cat ( Felis chaus ) of southeast Asia , European wildcat ( F. silvestris silvestris ) , African wildcat ( F. s. lybica ) , the Chinese mountain cat ( F. <unk> ) , and the Arabian sand cat ( F. margarita ) , among others . 
 The domestic cat was first classified as Felis catus by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae published in 1758 . Because of modern phylogenetics , domestic cats are usually regarded as another subspecies of the wildcat , F. silvestris . This has resulted in mixed usage of the terms , as the domestic cat can be called by its subspecies name , Felis silvestris catus . Wildcats have also been referred to as various subspecies of F. catus , but in 2003 , the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature fixed the name for wildcats as F. silvestris . The most common name in use for the domestic cat remains F. catus , following a convention for domesticated animals of using the earliest ( the senior ) synonym proposed . Sometimes , the domestic cat has been called Felis domesticus or Felis domestica , as proposed by German naturalist J. C. P. Erxleben in 1777 but these are not valid taxonomic names and have been used only rarely in scientific literature , because Linnaeus 's binomial takes precedence . A population of Transcaucasian black feral cats was once classified as Felis daemon ( <unk> 1904 ) but now this population is considered to be a part of domestic cat . 
 All the cats in this genus share a common ancestor that probably lived around 6 – 7 million years ago in Asia . The exact relationships within the Felidae are close but still uncertain , e.g. the Chinese mountain cat is sometimes classified ( under the name Felis silvestris <unk> ) as a subspecies of the wildcat , like the North African variety F. s. lybica . 
 In comparison to dogs , cats have not undergone major changes during the domestication process , as the form and behavior of the domestic cat is not radically different from those of wildcats and domestic cats are perfectly capable of surviving in the wild . Fully domesticated house cats often interbreed with feral F. catus populations . This limited evolution during domestication means that hybridisation can occur with many other felids , notably the Asian leopard cat . Several natural behaviors and characteristics of wildcats may have predisposed them for domestication as pets . These traits include their small size , social nature , obvious body language , love of play and relatively high intelligence . Several small felid species may have an inborn tendency towards tameness . 
 Cats have either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with humans . Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated . In one , people deliberately tamed cats in a process of artificial selection as they were useful predators of vermin . This has been criticized as implausible , because the reward for such an effort may have been too little ; cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents , other species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests . The alternative idea is that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection , as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages . 
 = = Nomenclature and etymology = = 
 The English word ' cat ' ( Old English <unk> ) is in origin a loanword , introduced to many languages of Europe from Latin <unk> and Byzantine Greek <unk> , including Portuguese and Spanish <unk> , French chat , German <unk> , Lithuanian <unk> , and Old Church Slavonic <unk> , among others . The ultimate source of the word is Afroasiatic , presumably from Late Egyptian <unk> , the feminine of <unk> " wildcat " . An alternative word with cognates in many languages is English ' puss ' ( ' pussycat ' ) . Attested only from the 16th century , it may have been introduced from Dutch <unk> or from Low German <unk> , related to Swedish <unk> , or Norwegian pus , <unk> . Similar forms exist in Lithuanian <unk> and Irish <unk> . The etymology of this word is unknown , but it may have simply arisen from a sound used to attract a cat . 
 A group of cats is referred to as a " <unk> " or a " glaring " , a male cat is called a " tom " or " <unk> " ( or a " gib " , if neutered ) , an unaltered female is called a " queen " , and a juvenile cat is referred to as a " kitten " . The male progenitor of a cat , especially a pedigreed cat , is its " sire " , and its female progenitor is its " dam " . In Early Modern English , the word ' kitten ' was interchangeable with the now @-@ obsolete word ' <unk> ' . 
 A pedigreed cat is one whose ancestry is recorded by a cat fancier organization . A purebred cat is one whose ancestry contains only individuals of the same breed . Many pedigreed and especially purebred cats are exhibited as show cats . Cats of unrecorded , mixed ancestry are referred to as domestic short @-@ haired or domestic long @-@ haired cats , by coat type , or commonly as random @-@ bred , <unk> ( chiefly British ) , or ( using terms borrowed from dog breeding ) mongrels or mutt @-@ cats . 
 While the African wildcat is the ancestral subspecies from which domestic cats are descended , and wildcats and domestic cats can completely interbreed ( Being subspecies of the same species ) , several intermediate stages occur between domestic pet and pedigree cats on one hand and those entirely wild animals on the other . The <unk> cat , a mostly outdoor cat , is not owned by any one individual , but is generally friendly to people and may be fed by several households . Feral cats are associated with human habitation areas and may be fed by people or forage for food , but are typically wary of human interaction .

 Domestic cats are similar in size to the other members of the genus Felis , typically weighing between 4 and 5 kg ( 9 and 10 lb ) . Some breeds , however , such as the Maine Coon , can occasionally exceed 11 kg ( 24 lb ) . Conversely , very small cats , less than 2 kg ( 4 lb ) , have been reported . The world record for the largest cat is 21 kg ( 50 lb ) . The smallest adult cat ever officially recorded weighed around 1 kg ( 2 lb ) . Feral cats tend to be lighter as they have more limited access to food than house cats . In the Boston area , the average feral adult male will weigh 4 kg ( 9 lb ) and average feral female 3 kg ( 7 lb ) . Cats average about 23 – 25 cm ( 9 – 10 in ) in height and 46 cm ( 18 in ) in head / body length ( males being larger than females ) , with tails averaging 30 cm ( 12 in ) in length . 
 Cats have seven cervical vertebrae , as do almost all mammals ; 13 thoracic vertebrae ( humans have 12 ) ; seven lumbar vertebrae ( humans have five ) ; three sacral vertebrae like most mammals ( humans have five ) ; and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail ( humans retain three to five caudal vertebrae , fused into an internal coccyx ) . The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat 's spinal mobility and flexibility . Attached to the spine are 13 ribs , the shoulder , and the pelvis . Unlike human arms , cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free @-@ floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their head . 
 The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful and specialized jaw . Within the jaw , cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat . When it overpowers its prey , a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth , inserting them between two of the prey 's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord , causing irreversible paralysis and death . Compared to other felines , domestic cats have narrowly spaced canine teeth , which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents , which have small vertebrae . The premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair on each side of the mouth , which efficiently shears meat into small pieces , like a pair of scissors . These are vital in feeding , since cats ' small molars cannot chew food effectively , and cats are largely incapable of mastication . Though cats tend to have better teeth than most humans , with decay generally less likely because of a thicker protective layer of enamel , a less damaging saliva , less retention of food particles between teeth , and a diet mostly devoid of sugar , they are nonetheless subject to occasional tooth loss and infection . 
 Cats , like dogs , are <unk> . They walk directly on their toes , with the bones of their feet making up the lower part of the visible leg . Cats are capable of walking very precisely , because like all felines , they directly register ; that is , they place each hind paw ( almost ) directly in the print of the corresponding fore paw , minimizing noise and visible tracks . This also provides sure footing for their hind paws when they navigate rough terrain . Unlike most mammals , when cats walk , they use a " pacing " gait ; that is , they move the two legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side . This trait is shared with camels and giraffes . As a walk speeds up into a trot , a cat 's gait changes to be a " diagonal " gait , similar to that of most other mammals ( and many other land animals , such as lizards ) : the diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously . 
 Like almost all members of the Felidae , cats have <unk> and retractable claws . In their normal , relaxed position , the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw 's toe pads . This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey . The claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet . Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws . They may extend their claws in hunting or self @-@ defense , climbing , kneading , or for extra traction on soft surfaces . Most cats have five claws on their front paws , and four on their rear paws . The fifth front claw ( the dewclaw ) is proximal to the other claws . More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth " finger " . This special feature of the front paws , on the inside of the wrists , is the carpal pad , also found on the paws of big cats and dogs . It has no function in normal walking , but is thought to be an <unk> device used while jumping . Some breeds of cats are prone to polydactyly ( extra toes and claws ) . These are particularly common along the northeast coast of North America . 
 = = = Physiology = = = 
 Cats are familiar and easily kept animals , and their physiology has been particularly well studied ; it generally resembles those of other carnivorous mammals , but displays several unusual features probably attributable to cats ' descent from desert @-@ dwelling species . For instance , cats are able to tolerate quite high temperatures : Humans generally start to feel uncomfortable when their skin temperature passes about 38 ° C ( 100 ° F ) , but cats show no discomfort until their skin reaches around 52 ° C ( 126 ° F ) , and can tolerate temperatures of up to 56 ° C ( 133 ° F ) if they have access to water . 
 Cats conserve heat by reducing the flow of blood to their skin and lose heat by evaporation through their mouths . Cats have minimal ability to sweat , with glands located primarily in their paw pads , and pant for heat relief only at very high temperatures ( but may also pant when stressed ) . A cat 's body temperature does not vary throughout the day ; this is part of cats ' general lack of circadian rhythms and may reflect their tendency to be active both during the day and at night . Cats ' feces are comparatively dry and their urine is highly concentrated , both of which are adaptations to allow cats to retain as much water as possible . Their kidneys are so efficient , they can survive on a diet consisting only of meat , with no additional water , and can even rehydrate by drinking seawater . 
 Cats are obligate carnivores : their physiology has evolved to efficiently process meat , and they have difficulty digesting plant matter . In contrast to omnivores such as rats , which only require about 4 % protein in their diet , about 20 % of a cat 's diet must be protein . Cats are unusually dependent on a constant supply of the amino acid arginine , and a diet lacking arginine causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal . Another unusual feature is that the cat cannot produce taurine , with taurine deficiency causing macular degeneration , wherein the cat 's retina slowly degenerates , causing irreversible blindness . 
 A cat 's gastrointestinal tract is adapted to meat eating , being much shorter than that of omnivores and having low levels of several of the digestive enzymes needed to digest carbohydrates . These traits severely limit the cat 's ability to digest and use plant @-@ derived nutrients , as well as certain fatty acids . Despite the cat 's meat @-@ oriented physiology , several vegetarian or vegan cat foods have been marketed that are supplemented with chemically synthesized taurine and other nutrients , in attempts to produce a complete diet . However , some of these products still fail to provide all the nutrients cats require , and diets containing no animal products pose the risk of causing severe nutritional deficiencies . 
 Cats do eat grass occasionally . A proposed explanation is that cats use grass as a source of folic acid . Another proposed explanation is that it is used to supply dietary fiber . 
 = = = Senses = = = 
 Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one @-@ sixth the light level required for human vision . This is partly the result of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum , which reflects any light that passes through the retina back into the eye , thereby increasing the eye 's sensitivity to dim light . Another adaptation to dim light is the large pupils of cats ' eyes . Unlike some big cats , such as tigers , domestic cats have slit pupils . These slit pupils can focus bright light without chromatic aberration , and are needed since the domestic cat 's pupils are much larger , relative to their eyes , than the pupils of the big cats . At low light levels a cat 's pupils will expand to cover most of the exposed surface of its eyes . However , domestic cats have rather poor color vision and ( like most <unk> mammals ) have only two types of cones , optimized for sensitivity to blue and yellowish green ; they have limited ability to distinguish between red and green . A 1993 paper reported a response to middle wavelengths from a system other than the rods which might be due to a third type of cone . However , this appears to be an adaptation to low light levels rather than representing true trichromatic vision . 
 Cats have excellent hearing and can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies . They can hear higher @-@ pitched sounds than either dogs or humans , detecting frequencies from 55 Hz to 79 @,@ 000 Hz , a range of 10 @.@ 5 octaves , while humans and dogs both have ranges of about 9 octaves . Cats can hear ultrasound , which is important in hunting because many species of rodents make ultrasonic calls . However , they do not communicate using ultrasound like rodents do . Cats ' hearing is also sensitive and among the best of any mammal , being most acute in the range of 500 Hz to 32 kHz . This sensitivity is further enhanced by the cat 's large movable outer ears ( their pinnae ) , which both amplify sounds and help detect the direction of a noise . 
 Cats have an acute sense of smell , due in part to their well @-@ developed olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory mucosa , about 5 @.@ 8 cm2 ( 0 @.@ 90 in2 ) in area , which is about twice that of humans . Cats are sensitive to pheromones such as 3 @-@ <unk> @-@ 3 @-@ <unk> @-@ 1 @-@ ol , which they use to communicate through urine spraying and marking with scent glands . Many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain <unk> , especially catnip , as they can detect that substance at less than one part per billion . About 70 — 80 % of cats are affected by <unk> . This response is also produced by other plants , such as silver vine ( <unk> <unk> ) and the herb valerian ; it may be caused by the smell of these plants mimicking a pheromone and stimulating cats ' social or sexual behaviors . 
 Cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans ( 470 or so versus more than 9 @,@ 000 on the human tongue ) . Domestic and wild cats share a gene mutation that keeps their sweet taste buds from binding to sugary molecules , leaving them with no ability to taste sweetness . Their taste buds instead respond to amino acids , bitter tastes , and acids . Cats and many other animals have a Jacobson 's organ located in their mouths that allows them to taste @-@ smell certain aromas in a way which humans have no experience of . Cats also have a distinct temperature preference for their food , preferring food with a temperature around 100 ° F ( 38 ° C ) which is similar to that of a fresh kill and routinely rejecting food presented cold or refrigerated ( which would signal to the cat that the " prey " item is long dead and therefore possibly toxic or decomposing ) . 
 To aid with navigation and sensation , cats have dozens of movable whiskers ( vibrissae ) over their body , especially their faces . These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location of objects in the dark , both by touching objects directly and by sensing air currents ; they also trigger protective blink reflexes to protect the eyes from damage . 
 Most breeds of cat have a noted fondness for settling in high places , or perching . In the wild , a higher place may serve as a concealed site from which to hunt ; domestic cats may strike prey by pouncing from a perch such as a tree branch , as does a leopard . Another possible explanation is that height gives the cat a better observation point , allowing it to survey its territory . During a fall from a high place , a cat can reflexively twist its body and right itself using its acute sense of balance and flexibility . This is known as the cat righting reflex . An individual cat always rights itself in the same way , provided it has the time to do so , during a fall . The height required for this to occur is around 90 cm ( 3 @.@ 0 ft ) . Cats without a tail ( e.g. Manx cats ) also have this ability , since a cat mostly moves its hind legs and relies on conservation of angular momentum to set up for landing , and the tail is little used for this feat . 
 = = = Health = = = 
 The average lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent years . In the early 1980s it was about seven years , rising to 9 @.@ 4 years in 1995 and 12 – 15 years in 2014 . However , cats have been reported as surviving into their 30s , with the oldest known cat , Creme Puff , dying at a verified age of 38 . 
 <unk> or neutering increases life expectancy : one study found neutered male cats live twice as long as intact males , while spayed female cats live 62 % longer than intact females . Having a cat neutered confers health benefits , because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer , spayed females cannot develop uterine or ovarian cancer , and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancer . 
 Despite widespread concern about the welfare of free @-@ roaming cats , the lifespans of neutered feral cats in managed colonies compare favorably with those of pet cats . <unk> cats in managed colonies can also live long lives . 
 = = = = Diseases = = = = 
 Cats can suffer from a wide range of health problems , including infectious diseases , parasites , injuries , and chronic disease . Vaccinations are available for many of these diseases , and domestic cats are regularly given treatments to eliminate parasites such as worms and fleas . 
 = = = = Poisoning = = = = 
 In addition to obvious dangers such as rodenticides , insecticides , and herbicides , cats may be poisoned by many chemicals usually considered safe by their human guardians , because their livers are less effective at some forms of detoxification than those of many other animals , including humans and dogs . Some of the most common causes of poisoning in cats are antifreeze and rodent baits . Cats may be particularly sensitive to environmental pollutants . When a cat has a sudden or prolonged serious illness without any obvious cause , it has possibly been exposed to a toxin . 
 Many human medicines should never be given to cats . For example , the painkiller paracetamol ( or acetaminophen , sold as Tylenol and Panadol ) is extremely toxic to cats : even very small doses need immediate treatment and can be fatal . Even aspirin , which is sometimes used to treat arthritis in cats , is much more toxic to them than to humans and must be administered cautiously . Similarly , application of <unk> ( <unk> ) to the skin of cats , either accidentally or by well @-@ meaning guardians attempting to counter loss of fur , has sometimes been fatal . Essential oils can be toxic to cats and cases have been reported of serious illnesses caused by tea tree oil , including flea treatments and shampoos containing it . 
 Other common household substances that should be used with caution around cats include mothballs and other naphthalene products . Phenol @-@ based products ( e.g. Pine @-@ Sol , Dettol / <unk> or <unk> ) are often used for cleaning and disinfecting near cats ' feeding areas or litter boxes , but these can sometimes be fatal . Ethylene glycol , often used as an automotive antifreeze , is particularly appealing to cats , and as little as a <unk> can be fatal . Some human foods are toxic to cats ; for example chocolate can cause <unk> poisoning , although ( unlike dogs ) few cats will eat chocolate . Large amounts of onions or garlic are also poisonous to cats . Many houseplants are also dangerous , such as <unk> species and the leaves of the Easter lily ( Lilium longiflorum ) , which can cause permanent and life @-@ threatening kidney damage . 
 = = = Genetics = = = 
 The domesticated cat and its closest wild ancestor are both diploid organisms that possess 38 chromosomes and roughly 20 @,@ 000 genes . About 250 heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats , many similar to human inborn errors . The high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans , as well as the use of cats as animal models in the study of the human diseases . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 Outdoor cats are active both day and night , although they tend to be slightly more active at night . The timing of cats ' activity is quite flexible and varied , which means house cats may be more active in the morning and evening , as a response to greater human activity at these times . Although they spend the majority of their time in the vicinity of their home , housecats can range many hundreds of meters from this central point , and are known to establish territories that vary considerably in size , in one study ranging from 7 to 28 hectares ( 17 – 69 acres ) . 
 Cats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals , especially as they grow older . The daily duration of sleep varies , usually between 12 and 16 hours , with 13 and 14 being the average . Some cats can sleep as much as 20 hours . The term " cat nap " for a short rest refers to the cat 's tendency to fall asleep ( lightly ) for a brief period . While asleep , cats experience short periods of rapid eye movement sleep often accompanied by muscle twitches , which suggests they are dreaming . 
 = = = Sociability = = = 
 Although wildcats are solitary , the social behavior of domestic cats is much more variable and ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies that form around a food source , based on groups of co @-@ operating females . Within such groups , one cat is usually dominant over the others . Each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory , with sexually active males having the largest territories , which are about 10 times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females ' territories . These territories are marked by urine spraying , by rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands , and by defecation . Between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts . Outside these neutral areas , territory holders usually chase away stranger cats , at first by staring , hissing , and growling , and if that does not work , by short but noisy and violent attacks . Despite some cats cohabiting in colonies , they do not have a social survival strategy , or a pack mentality , and always hunt alone . 
 However , some pet cats are poorly socialized . In particular , older cats may show aggressiveness towards newly arrived kittens , which may include biting and scratching ; this type of behavior is known as feline asocial aggression . 
 Though cats and dogs are believed to be natural enemies , they can live together if correctly socialized . 
 Life in proximity to humans and other domestic animals has led to a symbiotic social adaptation in cats , and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals . <unk> , the human keeper of a cat may function as a sort of surrogate for the cat 's mother , and adult housecats live their lives in a kind of extended <unk> , a form of behavioral neoteny . The high @-@ pitched sounds housecats make to solicit food may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant , making them particularly hard for humans to ignore . 
 = = = Communication = = = 
 Domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication , including purring , trilling , hissing , growling / snarling , grunting , and several different forms of meowing . By contrast , feral cats are generally silent . Their types of body language , including position of ears and tail , relaxation of the whole body , and kneading of the paws , are all indicators of mood . The tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats ; for example , a raised tail acts as a friendly greeting , and flattened ears indicates hostility . Tail @-@ raising also indicates the cat 's position in the group 's social hierarchy , with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate animals . Nose @-@ to @-@ nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming , which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its head . 
 <unk> may have developed as an evolutionary advantage as a signalling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and nursing kittens . Post @-@ nursing cats often purr as a sign of contentment : when being petted , becoming relaxed , or eating . The mechanism by which cats purr is elusive . The cat has no unique anatomical feature that is clearly responsible for the sound . It was , until recent times , believed that only the cats of the Felis genus could purr . However , felids of the Panthera genus ( tiger , lion , jaguar , and leopard ) also produce sounds similar to purring , but only when exhaling . 
 = = = Grooming = = = 
 Cats are known for spending considerable amounts of time licking their coat to keep it clean . The cat 's tongue has backwards @-@ facing spines about 500 μm long , which are called papillae . These contain keratin which makes them rigid so the papillae act like a hairbrush . Some cats , particularly longhaired cats , occasionally regurgitate hairballs of fur that have collected in their stomachs from grooming . These clumps of fur are usually sausage @-@ shaped and about 2 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 2 in ) long . <unk> can be prevented with remedies that ease elimination of the hair through the gut , as well as regular grooming of the coat with a comb or stiff brush . Some cats can develop a compulsive behavior known as psychogenic alopecia , or excessive grooming . 
 = = = Fighting = = = 
 Among domestic cats , males are more likely to fight than females . Among feral cats , the most common reason for cat fighting is competition between two males to mate with a female . In such cases , most fights are won by the heavier male . Another common reason for fighting in domestic cats is the difficulty of establishing territories within a small home . Female cats also fight over territory or to defend their kittens . Neutering will decrease or eliminate this behavior in many cases , suggesting that the behavior is linked to sex hormones . 
 When cats become aggressive , they try to make themselves appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur , arching their backs , turning sideways and hissing or spitting . Often , the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward . They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent . Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites . Cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent 's belly with their powerful hind legs . 
 Serious damage is rare , as the fights are usually short in duration , with the loser running away with little more than a few scratches to the face and ears . However , fights for mating rights are typically more severe and injuries may include deep puncture wounds and lacerations . Normally , serious injuries from fighting are limited to infections of scratches and bites , though these can occasionally kill cats if untreated . In addition , bites are probably the main route of transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus . Sexually active males are usually involved in many fights during their lives , and often have decidedly battered faces with obvious scars and cuts to their ears and nose . 
 = = = Hunting and feeding = = = 
 Cats hunt small prey , primarily birds and rodents , and are often used as a form of pest control . Domestic cats are a major predator of wildlife in the United States , killing an estimated 1 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 7 billion birds and 6 @.@ 9 – 20 @.@ 7 billion mammals annually . The bulk of predation in the United States is done by 80 million feral and stray cats . Effective measures to reduce this population are elusive , meeting opposition from cat enthusiasts . In the case of free @-@ ranging pets , equipping cats with bells and not letting them out at night will reduce wildlife predation . 
 Free @-@ fed feral cats and house cats tend to consume many small meals in a single day , although the frequency and size of meals varies between individuals . Cats use two hunting strategies , either stalking prey actively , or waiting in ambush until an animal comes close enough to be captured . Although it is not certain , the strategy used may depend on the prey species in the area , with cats waiting in ambush outside burrows , but tending to actively stalk birds . 
 Perhaps the best known element of cats ' hunting behavior , which is commonly misunderstood and often appalls cat owners because it looks like torture , is that cats often appear to " play " with prey by releasing it after capture . This behavior is due to an instinctive imperative to ensure that the prey is weak enough to be killed without endangering the cat . This behavior is referred to in the idiom " cat @-@ and @-@ mouse game " or simply " cat and mouse " . 
 Another poorly understood element of cat hunting behavior is the presentation of prey to human guardians . Ethologist Paul <unk> proposed that cats adopt humans into their social group and share excess kill with others in the group according to the dominance hierarchy , in which humans are reacted to as if they are at , or near , the top . Anthropologist and zoologist Desmond Morris , in his 1986 book <unk> , suggests , when cats bring home mice or birds , they are attempting to teach their human to hunt , or trying to help their human as if feeding " an elderly cat , or an inept kitten " . Morris 's hypothesis is inconsistent with the fact that male cats also bring home prey , despite males having no involvement with raising kittens . 
 Domestic cats select food based on its temperature , smell and texture ; they dislike chilled foods and respond most strongly to moist foods rich in amino acids , which are similar to meat . Cats may reject novel flavors ( a response termed neophobia ) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past . They may also avoid sugary foods and milk . Most adult cats are lactose intolerant ; the sugars in milk are not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea . They can also develop odd eating habits . Some cats like to eat or chew on other things , most commonly wool , but also plastic , cables , paper , string , aluminum foil , or even coal . This condition , pica , can threaten their health , depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten . 
 Though cats usually prey on animals less than half their size , a feral cat in Australia has been photographed killing an adult <unk> weighing around the cat 's size at 4 kg ( 8 @.@ 8 lb ) . 
 Since cats cannot fully close their lips around something to create suction , they use a lapping method with the tongue to draw liquid upwards into their mouths . <unk> at a rate of four times a second , the cat touches the smooth tip of its tongue to the surface of the water , and quickly retracts it , drawing water upwards . 
 = = = Play = = = 
 Domestic cats , especially young kittens , are known for their love of play . This behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk , capture , and kill prey . Cats also engage in play fighting , with each other and with humans . This behavior may be a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat , and might also reduce any fear they associate with launching attacks on other animals . 
 Owing to the close similarity between play and hunting , cats prefer to play with objects that resemble prey , such as small furry toys that move rapidly , but rapidly lose interest ( they become habituated ) in a toy they have played with before . Cats also tend to play with toys more when they are hungry . String is often used as a toy , but if it is eaten , it can become caught at the base of the cat 's tongue and then move into the intestines , a medical emergency which can cause serious illness , even death . Owing to the risks posed by cats eating string , it is sometimes replaced with a laser pointer 's dot , which cats may chase . There are several important issues related to using a laser with a cat ; first most , lasers can cause blindness in cats , even lasers which are sold as " eye safe " can actually be of much higher power of that proclaimed and can cause damages to the eyes . In addition , the cat thinks of the laser point as prey , but gets frustrated as he is unable to catch it . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Female cats are seasonally polyestrous , which means they may have many periods of heat over the course of a year , the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn . Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 days . Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat . The males will fight over her , and the victor wins the right to mate . At first , the female rejects the male , but eventually the female allows the male to mate . The female utters a loud <unk> as the male pulls out of her because a male cat 's penis has a band of about 120 – 150 backwards @-@ pointing penile spines , which are about 1 mm long ; upon withdrawal of the penis , the spines rake the walls of the female 's vagina , which is a trigger for ovulation . This act also occurs to clear the vagina of other sperm in the context of a second ( or more ) mating , thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception . 
 After mating , the female washes her vulva thoroughly . If a male attempts to mate with her at this point , the female will attack him . After about 20 to 30 minutes , once the female is finished grooming , the cycle will repeat . 
 Because ovulation is not always triggered by a single mating , females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate . Furthermore , cats are <unk> ; that is , a female may mate with more than one male when she is in heat , with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different fathers . 
 At 124 hours after conception , the <unk> forms . At 148 hours , early <unk> form . At 10 – 12 days , implantation occurs . 
 The gestation period for cats is between 64 and 67 days , with an average of 66 days . The size of a litter usually is three to five kittens , with the first litter usually smaller than subsequent litters . Kittens are weaned between six and seven weeks old , and cats normally reach sexual maturity at 5 – 10 months ( females ) and to 5 – 7 months ( males ) , although this can vary depending on breed . Females can have two to three litters per year , so may produce up to 150 kittens in their breeding span of around ten years . 
 Cats are ready to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age , when they are ready to leave their mother . They can be surgically sterilized ( spayed or castrated ) as early as 7 weeks to limit unwanted reproduction . This surgery also prevents undesirable sex @-@ related behavior , such as aggression , territory marking ( spraying urine ) in males and yowling ( calling ) in females . Traditionally , this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age , but it is increasingly being performed prior to puberty , at about three to six months . In the US , about 80 % of household cats are neutered . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Habitats = = = 
 Cats are a cosmopolitan species and are found across much of the world . Geneticist Stephen James O 'Brien , of the National Cancer Institute in Frederick , Maryland , remarked on how successful cats have been in evolutionary terms : " Cats are one of evolution 's most charismatic creatures . They can live on the highest mountains and in the hottest deserts . " They are extremely adaptable and are now present on all continents except Antarctica , and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islands — even on isolated islands such as the Kerguelen Islands . 
 Feral cats can live in forests , grasslands , tundra , coastal areas , agricultural land , scrublands , urban areas , and wetlands . Their habitats even include small oceanic islands with no human inhabitants . Further , the close relatives of domestic cats , the African wildcat ( Felis silvestris lybica ) and the Arabian sand cat ( Felis margarita ) both inhabit desert environments , and domestic cats still show similar adaptations and behaviors . The cat 's ability to thrive in almost any terrestrial habitat has led to its designation as one of the world 's worst invasive species . 
 As domestic cats are little altered from wildcats , they can readily interbreed . This hybridization poses a danger to the genetic distinctiveness of some wildcat populations , particularly in Scotland and Hungary and possibly also the Iberian Peninsula . 
 = = = Feral cats = = = 
 Feral cats are domestic cats that were born in or have reverted to a wild state . They are unfamiliar with and wary of humans and roam freely in urban and rural areas . The numbers of feral cats is not known , but estimates of the US feral population range from 25 to 60 million . Feral cats may live alone , but most are found in large colonies , which occupy a specific territory and are usually associated with a source of food . Famous feral cat colonies are found in Rome around the Colosseum and Forum Romanum , with cats at some of these sites being fed and given medical attention by volunteers . 
 Public attitudes towards feral cats vary widely , ranging from seeing them as free @-@ ranging pets , to regarding them as vermin . One common approach to reducing the feral cat population is termed ' trap @-@ neuter @-@ return ' , where the cats are trapped , neutered , immunized against rabies and the feline leukemia virus , and then released . Before releasing them back into their feral colonies , the attending veterinarian often nips the tip off one ear to mark it as neutered and inoculated , since these cats may be trapped again . Volunteers continue to feed and give care to these cats throughout their lives . Given this support , their lifespans are increased , and behavior and nuisance problems caused by competition for food are reduced . 
 = = = Impact on prey species = = = 
 To date , little scientific data is available to assess the impact of cat predation on prey populations . Even well @-@ fed domestic cats may hunt and kill , mainly catching small mammals , but also birds , amphibians , reptiles , fish , and invertebrates . Hunting by domestic cats may be contributing to the decline in the numbers of birds in urban areas , although the importance of this effect remains controversial . In the wild , the introduction of feral cats during human settlement can threaten native species with extinction . In many cases , controlling or eliminating the populations of non @-@ native cats can produce a rapid recovery in native animals . However , the ecological role of introduced cats can be more complicated . For example , cats can control the numbers of rats , which also prey on birds ' eggs and young , so a cat population can protect an endangered bird species by suppressing <unk> . 
 In isolated landmasses , such as Australasia , there are often no other native , medium @-@ sized quadrupedal predators ( including other feline species ) ; this tends to exacerbate the impact of feral cats on small native animals . Native species such as the New Zealand kakapo and the Australian bettong , for example , tend to be more ecologically vulnerable and behaviorally " naive " , when faced with predation by cats . Feral cats have had a major impact on these native species and have played a leading role in the endangerment and extinction of many animals . 
 Even in places with ancient and numerous cat populations , such as Western Europe , cats appear to be growing in number and independently of their environments ' carrying capacity ( such as the numbers of prey available ) . This may be explained , at least in part , by an abundance of food , from sources including feeding by pet owners and scavenging . For instance , research in Britain suggests that a high proportion of cats hunt only " recreationally " . And in South Sweden , where research in 1982 found that the population density of cats was as high as 2 @,@ 000 per square kilometre ( 5 @,@ 200 / sq mi ) . 
 = = = Impact on birds = = = 
 The domestic cat is a significant predator of birds . UK assessments indicate they may be accountable for an estimated 64 @.@ 8 million bird deaths each year . Certain species appear more susceptible than others ; for example , 30 % of house sparrow mortality is linked to the domestic cat . In the recovery of ringed robins ( Erithacus rubecula ) and <unk> ( Prunella <unk> ) , 31 % of deaths were a result of cat predation . The presence of larger carnivores such as coyotes which prey on cats and other small predators reduces the effect of predation by cats and other small predators such as opossums and raccoons on bird numbers and variety . The proposal that cat populations will increase when the numbers of these top predators decline is called the <unk> release hypothesis . However , a new study suggests cats are a much greater menace than previously thought and feral cats kill several billion birds each year in the United States . 
 On islands , birds can contribute as much as 60 % of a cat 's diet . In nearly all cases , however , the cat cannot be identified as the sole cause for reducing the numbers of island birds , and in some instances , eradication of cats has caused a ' <unk> release ' effect ; where the suppression of top carnivores creates an abundance of smaller predators that cause a severe decline in their shared prey . Domestic cats are , however , known to be a contributing factor to the decline of many species , a factor that has ultimately led , in some cases , to extinction . The South Island piopio , Chatham Islands rail , the Auckland Islands merganser , and the common diving petrel are a few from a long list , with the most extreme case being the flightless Stephens Island wren , which was driven to extinction only a few years after its discovery . 
 Some of the same factors that have promoted adaptive radiation of island avifauna over evolutionary time appear to promote vulnerability to non @-@ native species in modern time . The susceptibility of many island birds is undoubtedly due to evolution in the absence of mainland predators , competitors , diseases , and parasites , in addition to lower reproductive rates and extended incubation periods . The loss of flight , or reduced flying ability is also characteristic of many island endemics . These biological aspects have increased vulnerability to extinction in the presence of introduced species , such as the domestic cat . Equally , behavioral traits exhibited by island species , such as " predatory naivety " and ground @-@ nesting , have also contributed to their susceptibility . 
 = = Interaction with humans = = 
 Cats are common pets in Europe and North America , and their worldwide population exceeds 500 million . Although cat guardianship has commonly been associated with women , a 2007 Gallup poll reported that men and women in the United States of America were equally likely to own a cat . 
 As well as being kept as pets , cats are also used in the international fur and leather industries for making coats , hats , blankets and stuffed toys ; and shoes , gloves and musical instruments respectively ( about 24 cats are needed to make a cat fur coat ) . This use has now been outlawed in the United States , Australia , and the European Union . Cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practise of witchcraft , and are still made into blankets in Switzerland as folk remedies believed to help rheumatism . In the Western intellectual tradition , the idea of cats as everyday objects have served to illustrate problems of quantum mechanics in the Schrödinger 's cat thought experiment . 
 A few attempts to build a cat census have been made over the years , both through associations or national and international organizations ( such as the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies 's one ) and over the net , but such a task does not seem simple to achieve . General estimates for the global population of domestic cats range widely from anywhere between 200 million to 600 million . 
 = = = History and mythology = = = 
 Traditionally , historians tended to think ancient Egypt was the site of cat domestication , owing to the clear depictions of house cats in Egyptian paintings about 3 @,@ 600 years old . However , in 2004 , a Neolithic grave excavated in <unk> , Cyprus , contained the skeletons , laid close to one another , of both a human and a cat . The grave is estimated to be 9 @,@ 500 years old , pushing back the earliest known feline – human association significantly . The cat specimen is large and closely resembles the African wildcat , rather than present @-@ day domestic cats . This discovery , combined with genetic studies , suggests cats were probably domesticated in the Middle East , in the Fertile Crescent around the time of the development of agriculture and then they were brought to Cyprus and Egypt . 
 Direct evidence for the domestication of cats 5 @,@ 300 years ago in <unk> , China has been published by archaeologists and paleontologists from the University of Washington and Chinese Academy of Sciences . The cats are believed to have been attracted to the village by rodents , which in turn were attracted by grain cultivated and stored by humans . 
 In ancient Egypt , cats were sacred animals , with the goddess Bastet often depicted in cat form , sometimes taking on the war @-@ like aspect of a lioness . The Romans are often credited with introducing the domestic cat from Egypt to Europe ; in Roman Aquitaine , a first- or second @-@ century engraving of a young girl holding a cat is one of two earliest depictions of the Roman domesticated cat . However , cats possibly were already kept in Europe prior to the Roman Empire , as they may have been present in Britain in the late Iron Age . Domestic cats were spread throughout much of the rest of the world during the Age of Discovery , as they were carried on sailing ships to control shipboard rodents and as good @-@ luck charms ( see Ship 's cat ) . 
 Several ancient religions believed cats are exalted souls , companions or guides for humans , that are all @-@ knowing but mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humans . In Japan , the <unk> <unk> cat is a symbol of good fortune . 
 Although no species are sacred in Islam , cats are revered by Muslims . Some Western writers have stated Muhammad had a favorite cat , <unk> . He is reported to have loved cats so much , " he would do without his cloak rather than disturb one that was sleeping on it " . The story has no origin in early Muslim writers , and seems to confuse a story of a later Sufi saint , Ahmed ar @-@ Rifa 'i , centuries after Muhammad . 
 Freyja , the goddess of love , beauty , and fertility in Norse mythology , is depicted as riding a chariot drawn by cats . 
 Many cultures have negative superstitions about cats . An example would be the belief that a black cat " crossing one 's path " leads to bad luck , or that cats are witches ' familiars used to augment a witch 's powers and skills . The killing of cats in Medieval Ypres , Belgium , is commemorated in the innocuous present @-@ day <unk> ( cat parade ) . 
 According to a myth in many cultures , cats have multiple lives . In many countries , they are believed to have nine lives , but in Italy , Germany , Greece , Brazil and some Spanish @-@ speaking regions , they are said to have seven lives , while in Turkish and Arabic traditions , the number of lives is six . The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life @-@ threatening situations . Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet , using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around . Nonetheless , cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall .

 = German destroyer Z4 Richard Beitzen = 
 The German destroyer Z4 Richard Beitzen was a Type 1934 destroyer built for the Kriegsmarine during the 1930s . At the beginning of World War II in September 1939 , the ship was initially deployed to blockade the Polish coast , but she was soon transferred to the Kattegat where she inspected neutral shipping for contraband goods . In late 1939 and early 1940 , the ship laid two offensive minefields off the English coast that claimed 17 merchant ships . Richard Beitzen was in reserve during the Norwegian Campaign of early 1940 and was transferred to France later that year where she made several attacks on British shipping . 
 The ship returned to Germany in early 1941 for a refit and was transferred to Norway in June 1941 as part of the preparations for Operation Barbarossa , the German invasion of the Soviet Union . Richard Beitzen spent some time at the beginning of the campaign conducting anti @-@ shipping patrols in Soviet waters , but these were generally fruitless . She escorted a number of German convoys in the Arctic later in the year . The ship escorted several German heavy cruisers at the beginning and end of their anti @-@ shipping raids in 1942 . She participated in the Battle of the Barents Sea when Convoy JW 51B was attacked on 31 December 1942 near the North Cape , Norway . 
 Richard Beitzen spent much of 1943 escorting ships to and from Norway until November when she ran aground in November . Badly damaged , repairs lasted until August 1944 when she returned to Norway and resumed her former duties . The ship had another grounding incident in November and was under repair until February 1945 . While escorting a convoy in April , she was badly damaged by aircraft and was still under repair when the war ended on 9 May . Richard Beitzen was eventually allocated to the British when the surviving warships were divided between the Allies after the war . They made no use of the ship before scrapping her in 1949 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Richard Beitzen had an overall length of 119 meters ( 390 ft 5 in ) and was 114 meters ( 374 ft 0 in ) long at the waterline . The ship had a beam of 11 @.@ 30 meters ( 37 ft 1 in ) , and a maximum draft of 4 @.@ 23 meters ( 13 ft 11 in ) . She displaced 2 @,@ 223 long tons ( 2 @,@ 259 t ) at standard load and 3 @,@ 156 long tons ( 3 @,@ 207 t ) at deep load . The two Wagner geared steam turbine sets , each driving one propeller shaft , were designed to produce 70 @,@ 000 PS ( 51 @,@ 000 kW ; 69 @,@ 000 shp ) using steam provided by six high @-@ pressure Wagner boilers . The ship had a designed speed of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) , but her maximum speed was 38 @.@ 7 knots ( 71 @.@ 7 km / h ; 44 @.@ 5 mph ) . Richard Beitzen carried a maximum of 752 metric tons ( 740 long tons ) of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of 4 @,@ 400 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 100 km ; 5 @,@ 100 mi ) at a speed of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) , but the ship proved top @-@ heavy in service and 30 % of the fuel had to be retained as ballast low in the ship . The effective range proved to be only 1 @,@ 530 nmi ( 2 @,@ 830 km ; 1 @,@ 760 mi ) at 19 knots . The crew numbered 10 officers and 315 enlisted men , plus an additional four officers and 19 enlisted men if serving as a flotilla flagship . 
 The ship carried five 12 @.@ 7 cm SK C / 34 guns in single mounts with gun shields , two each superimposed , fore and aft . The fifth gun was carried on top of the aft superstructure . Her anti @-@ aircraft armament consisted of four 3 @.@ 7 cm SK C / 30 guns in two twin mounts abreast the rear funnel and six 2 cm C / 30 guns in single mounts . Richard Beitzen carried eight above @-@ water 53 @.@ 3 @-@ centimeter ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes in two power @-@ operated mounts . A pair of reload torpedoes were provided for each mount . Four depth charge throwers were mounted on the sides of the rear deckhouse and they were supplemented by six racks for individual depth charges on the sides of the stern . Enough depth charges were carried for either two or four patterns of 16 charges each . Mine rails could be fitted on the rear deck that had a maximum capacity of 60 mines . A system of passive hydrophones designated as ' GHG ' ( Gruppenhorchgerät ) was fitted to detect submarines . 
 An active sonar system was scheduled to be installed in June 1940 , but it is uncertain when it was actually done . During the war , the ship 's light anti @-@ aircraft armament was augmented several times . Improved 2 cm C / 38 guns replaced the original C / 30 guns and three additional guns were added sometime in 1941 . The two guns on the aft shelter deck were replaced by a single 2 cm quadruple Flakvierling mount , probably during her late 1941 refit . Richard Beitzen appears not have any additional AA guns added after this time .

 Richard Beitzen , named after Lieutenant ( Kapitänleutnant ) Richard Beitzen who commanded the 14th Torpedo Boat Flotilla in World War I and was killed in action in March 1918 , was ordered on 7 July 1934 and laid down at Deutsche Werke , Kiel , on 7 January 1935 as yard number <unk> . The ship was launched on 30 November 1935 and completed on 13 May 1937 . Her first captain was Lieutenant Commander ( Fregattenkapitän ) Hans @-@ Joachim Gadow . She made a port visit to Ulvik , Norway in April 1938 , together with her sisters Z2 Georg Thiele and Z3 Max Schultz . Upon her return she was taken in hand by Deutsche Werke to have her bow rebuilt to reduce the amount of water that came over the bow in head seas . This increased her length by .3 meters ( 1 ft 0 in ) . The ship participated in the August Fleet Review and the following fleet exercise . On 26 October , she was assigned to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla ( 1 . Zerstörer @-@ Flottille ) . In December , Richard Beitzen , together with her sisters Z1 Leberecht Maass , Georg Thiele , and Max Schultz , sailed to the area of Iceland to evaluate their seaworthiness in a North Atlantic winter with their new bows . On 23 – 24 March 1939 , the ship was one of the destroyers that escorted Adolf Hitler aboard the pocket battleship Deutschland to occupy Memel . She participated in the fleet exercise the next month in the western Mediterranean and made several visits to Spanish and Moroccan ports in April and May . Upon her return , Richard Beitzen was accidentally rammed in the stern by the escort ship F9 . 
 When World War II began in September 1939 , Richard Beitzen was initially deployed in the western Baltic to enforce a blockade of Poland , but she was soon transferred to the Kattegat where she inspected neutral shipping for contraband goods beginning in mid @-@ September as one turbine was not operational . On the night of 12 / 13 December , German destroyers sortied to lay minefields off the British coast . Under the command of Commodore ( Kommodore ) Friedrich Bonte in his flagship <unk> Hermann Künne , Richard Beitzen , Z8 Bruno Heinemann , Z14 Friedrich Ihn , and Z15 Erich Steinbrinck laid 240 mines off the mouth of the River Tyne , where the navigation lights were still lit . The British were unaware of the minefield 's existence and lost eleven ships totaling 18 @,@ 979 gross register tons ( GRT ) . En route home the destroyers were ordered to escort the crippled light cruisers Leipzig and Nürnberg which had been torpedoed by the submarine HMS Salmon while covering the destroyers ' withdrawal . Despite their escort , the submarine HMS Ursula managed to sneak inside the anti @-@ submarine screen and fired a salvo of six torpedoes at Leipzig in the Elbe estuary the following day . Two of the torpedoes struck F9 which sank three minutes later with heavy loss of life , but the other torpedoes missed . 
 Bonte led a destroyer minelaying sortie to the Newcastle area on the night of 10 / 11 January with Ihn , Heidkamp , Eckoldt , Z22 Anton Schmitt , Richard Beitzen , and Z20 Karl Galster . Ihn had problems with her boilers that reduced her maximum speed to 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) and she had to be escorted back to Germany by Beitzen . This minefield only claimed one fishing trawler of 251 tons . Max Schultz , Richard Beitzen and Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt laid 110 magnetic mines in the Shipwash area , off Harwich , on 9 / 10 February 1940 that sank six ships of 28 @,@ 496 GRT and damaged another . 
 On 22 February 1940 , Richard Beitzen and five other destroyers , Z3 Max Schultz , Z1 Leberecht Maass , Z6 Theodor Riedel , Z13 Erich Koellner and Eckoldt , sailed for the Dogger Bank to intercept British fishing vessels in " Operation Wikinger " . En route , the flotilla was erroneously attacked by a Heinkel He 111 bomber from Bomber Wing 26 ( Kampfgeschwader 26 ) . Leberecht Maass was hit by at least one bomb , lost steering , and broke in half , sinking with the loss of 280 of her crew . During the rescue effort , Max Schultz hit a mine and sank with the loss of her entire crew of 308 . Hitler ordered a Court of Inquiry to be convened to investigate the cause of the losses and it concluded that both ships that been sunk by bombs from the He 111 . The Kriegsmarine had failed to notify its destroyers that the Luftwaffe was making anti @-@ shipping patrols at that time and had also failed to inform the Luftwaffe that its destroyers would be at sea . Postwar evidence revealed that one or both ships struck a British minefield laid by the destroyers Ivanhoe and Intrepid . 
 Richard Beitzen was held in reserve for the German invasion of Norway on 9 April . Two days later , she escorted the light cruiser Köln home to Wilhelmshaven . The ship helped to lay a minefield in the Kattegat from 28 April to 20 May and then began a refit that lasted until September . She was transferred to Brest , France , in October . On the night of 24 – 25 November , Richard Beitzen , Z10 Hans Lody and Z20 Karl Galster sortied from Brest , bound for the Land 's End area . En route they encountered some fishing ships south @-@ west of Wolf Rock and engaged them with gunfire with little effect . The German ships then spotted a small convoy and sank one of the three merchantmen and damaged another . The flash from the guns alerted the five destroyers of the British 5th Destroyer Flotilla , but they could not intercept the German destroyers before dawn . Three nights later the German ship sortied again for the same area . They encountered two tugboats and a barge , but only sank one of the former and the barge , totaling 424 GRT . This time the 5th Destroyer Flotilla was able to intercept around 06 : 30 on 29 November . The Germans opened fire first , each destroyer firing four torpedoes , of which only two from Z10 Hans Lody hit their target , HMS Javelin . The torpedoes hit at each end of the ship and blew off her bow and stern , but the British were able to tow her home . Sometime in 1939 – 41 the ship was fitted with a FuMO 21 or FuMO 24 radar set above the bridge . 
 During January 1941 , the ship laid a minefield off the coast of south @-@ east England . The following month , she escorted the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper on leaving and returning to Brest . Richard Beitzen departed for Kiel briefly on 16 March to begin a refit . She was then sent to Kirkenes , Norway in July 1941 . Now a part of the 6th Destroyer Flotilla ( 6 . Zerstörer @-@ Flottille ) , she participated in a sortie on 12 – 13 July that sank two small Soviet ships at the cost of expending 80 % of their ammunition . Another sortie on 22 July saw Richard Beitzen sink a Soviet flying boat on the water . She was damaged by shock from near @-@ misses during another sortie on 9 August during which the Germans sank a converted fishing trawler and departed for Germany for repairs five days later . 
 She escorted the battleship Tirpitz for several days in mid @-@ January 1942 as the battleship sailed from the Baltic to Trondheim , Norway . Richard Beitzen , together with the rest of the 5th Zerstörer Flotille , sailed from Kiel on 24 January for France as part of the preparations for the Channel Dash . On the evening of 25 January , Z8 Bruno Heinemann struck two mines laid by HMS Plover off the Belgian coast and sank . Richard Beitzen rescued 200 of the survivors and proceeded to Le Havre to put them ashore before reaching Brest on the 26th . The German ships departed Brest on 11 February , totally surprising the British . Richard Beitzen helped to repel an attack by five British destroyers and was damaged by a near @-@ miss from a Bristol Blenheim bomber that she shot down with her newly installed 20 cm Flakvierling . Shortly afterwards , the ship joined four other destroyers in escorting Prinz Eugen and the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer to Trondheim . Heavy weather forced Richard Beitzen and two other destroyers to return to port before reaching Trondheim and Prinz Eugen was badly damaged by a British submarine after their separation . After her return , the ship needed her machinery overhauled and began a refit at Bremen on 14 March . After it was completed she screened the heavy cruiser Lützow to Bogen Bay , Norway and laid a minefield in the Skaggerak en route . 
 Richard Beitzen took part in the preliminaries of Operation Rösselsprung , an attempt to intercept Arctic convoy PQ @-@ 17 in July . Admiral Scheer and Lützow formed one group while Tirpitz and Admiral Hipper composed another . While en route to the rendezvous point at the Altafjord , Lützow and three destroyers ran aground , forcing the entire group to abandon the operation . Richard Beitzen , in the meantime escorted two oil tankers to the Altafjord on 2 – 3 July . During Operation Wunderland in August , Richard Beitzen , Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt and Z15 Erich Steinbrinck escorted Admiral Scheer at the beginning and end of its mission to attack Soviet shipping in the Kara Sea . They also escorted the minelayer Ulm as it departed to lay a minefield off Cape Zhelaniya in mid @-@ August . On 13 – 15 October , Beitzen , Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt , and the destroyers Z27 and Z30 laid a minefield off the Kanin Peninsula at the mouth of the White Sea that sank the Soviet icebreaker Mikoyan . Three weeks later , the same four destroyers escorted Admiral Hipper as she attempted to intercept Allied merchant ships proceeding independently to Soviet ports in early November . 
 = = = Battle of the Barents Sea = = = 
 During Operation Regenbogen , the attempt to intercept Convoy JW 51B sailing from the UK to the Soviet Union in late December , Richard Beitzen , Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt , and Z29 escorted Admiral Hipper as she attempted to occupy the attention of the convoy 's escort while Lützow and three other destroyers attacked the convoy . The three destroyers separated from Hipper to search for the convoy and were successful on the morning of 31 December . The destroyer HMS Obdurate spotted them in turn and closed to investigate when the German ships opened fire at a range of 8 @,@ 000 meters ( 8 @,@ 700 yd ) . Obdurate turned away to rejoin the convoy without sustaining any damage and the German ships did not pursue as they had been ordered to rejoin Hipper . The Germans found the minesweeper HMS Bramble , which had been detached earlier from the convoy to search for stragglers , as they maneuvered to close with the convoy and the destroyers were ordered to sink her while Hipper engaged the convoy 's escorting destroyers . This took some time in the poor visibility and Hipper was surprised in the meantime by the British covering force of the light cruisers Sheffield and Jamaica . After sinking Bramble , the German destroyers attempted to rejoin Hipper , but had no idea that British cruisers were in the area . They confused Sheffield with Hipper when they spotted each other at 4 @,@ 000 meters ( 4 @,@ 400 yd ) range and were totally surprised when Sheffield opened fire on Z16 Friedrich Eckoldt with every gun she possessed , sinking her with the loss of all hands . Richard Beitzen was not engaged before she escaped into the darkness . 
 Commander ( Fregattenkapitän ) Hans Dominik assumed command in January 1943 and the ship escorted the damaged Admiral Hipper and Köln down to Kristiansand at the end of the month . She began escorting convoys between that port and Aarhus , Denmark before she escorted the battleship Scharnhorst to Altafjord in early March . The following month she screened Nürnberg during the latter 's return to the Baltic and began a refit at <unk> that lasted until October . Returning to the Arctic , she ran aground in the <unk> on 27 October that extensively damaged her . Richard Beitzen was refloated on 5 November and towed to Haugesund for emergency repairs . She reached Bergen on 26 November for temporary repairs that took until 18 December to effect . The ship arrived at Stettin five days later , but repairs , which included fitting a new bow , did not begin until 17 January as the dry dock was already occupied . The repairs were completed in June , but machinery problems meant that she was not operational again until 5 August when she reached Horten , Norway . 
 Richard Beitzen resumed escort work and laid mines in the Skagerrak until she ran aground again in November . Repairs were slow and she was not fully operational until 15 February 1945 . The ship was badly damaged by radar @-@ equipped bombers while screening a convoy on the morning of 24 April and put into Oslo , Norway for repairs that were not completed before the end of the war the next month . Richard Beitzen was captured by the British on 14 May and temporarily turned over to the Royal Norwegian Navy on 15 July while the Allies decided on the disposition of the captured ships . She was allocated to Britain at the end of 1945 and was then towed to Rosyth in February 1946 . Richard Beitzen was ordered to be used as a target in September , but a heavy leak three months later caused her to be beached lest she sink . Temporary repairs were made and she was allocated for disposal in January 1947 . Richard Beitzen was allocated to C. W. <unk> for breaking up the following year and she was towed to their facility in Gateshead on 10 January 1949 . 
 = Maximian = 
 Maximian ( Latin : Marcus Aurelius Valerius <unk> Herculius Augustus ; c . 250 – c . July 310 ) was Roman Emperor from 286 to 305 . He was Caesar from 285 to 286 , then Augustus from 286 to 305 . He shared the latter title with his co @-@ emperor and superior , Diocletian , whose political brain complemented Maximian 's military brawn . Maximian established his residence at Trier but spent most of his time on campaign . In the late summer of 285 , he suppressed rebels in Gaul known as the Bagaudae . From 285 to 288 , he fought against Germanic tribes along the Rhine frontier . Together with Diocletian , he launched a scorched earth campaign deep into <unk> territory in 288 , temporarily relieving the Rhine provinces from the threat of Germanic invasion . 
 The man he appointed to police the Channel shores , Carausius , rebelled in 286 , causing the secession of Britain and northwestern Gaul . Maximian failed to oust Carausius , and his invasion fleet was destroyed by storms in 289 or 290 . Maximian 's subordinate , Constantius , campaigned against Carausius ' successor , Allectus , while Maximian held the Rhine frontier . The rebel leader was ousted in 296 , and Maximian moved south to combat piracy near Hispania and Berber incursions in Mauretania . When these campaigns concluded in 298 , he departed for Italy , where he lived in comfort until 305 . At Diocletian 's behest , Maximian abdicated on May 1 , 305 , gave the Augustan office to Constantius , and retired to southern Italy . 
 In late 306 , Maximian took the title of Augustus again and aided his son Maxentius ' rebellion in Italy . In April 307 , he attempted to depose his son , but failed and fled to the court of Constantius ' successor , Constantine ( who was both Maximian 's step @-@ grandson and also his son @-@ in @-@ law ) , in Trier . At the Council of Carnuntum in November 308 , Diocletian and his successor , Galerius , forced Maximian to renounce his imperial claim again . In early 310 , Maximian attempted to seize Constantine 's title while the emperor was on campaign on the Rhine . Few supported him , and he was captured by Constantine in Marseille . Maximian committed suicide in the summer of 310 on Constantine 's orders . During Constantine 's war with Maxentius , Maximian 's image was purged from all public places . However , after Constantine ousted and killed Maxentius , Maximian 's image was rehabilitated , and he was deified . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Maximian was born near Sirmium ( modern Sremska Mitrovica , Serbia ) in the province of Pannonia , around 250 into a family of shopkeepers . Beyond that , the ancient sources contain vague allusions to Illyricum as his homeland , to his Pannonian virtues , and to his harsh upbringing along the war @-@ torn Danube frontier . Maximian joined the army , serving with Diocletian under the emperors Aurelian ( r . 270 – 275 ) and Probus ( r . 276 – 282 ) . He probably participated in the Mesopotamian campaign of Carus in 283 and attended Diocletian 's election as emperor on November 20 , 284 at Nicomedia . Maximian 's swift appointment by Diocletian as Caesar is taken by the writer Stephen Williams and historian Timothy Barnes to mean that the two men were longterm allies , that their respective roles were pre @-@ agreed and that Maximian had probably supported Diocletian during his campaign against Carinus ( r . 283 – 285 ) but there is no direct evidence for this . 
 With his great energy , firm aggressive character and disinclination to rebel , Maximian was an appealing candidate for imperial office . The fourth @-@ century historian Aurelius Victor described Maximian as " a colleague trustworthy in friendship , if somewhat boorish , and of great military talents " . Despite his other qualities , Maximian was uneducated and preferred action to thought . The panegyric of 289 , after comparing his actions to Scipio Africanus ' victories over Hannibal during the Second Punic War , suggested that Maximian had never heard of them . His ambitions were purely military ; he left politics to Diocletian . The Christian rhetor Lactantius suggested that Maximian shared Diocletian 's basic attitudes but was less puritanical in his tastes , and took advantage of the sensual opportunities his position as emperor offered . Lactantius charged that Maximian defiled senators ' daughters and traveled with young virgins to satisfy his unending lust , though Lactantius ' credibility is undermined by his general hostility towards pagans . 
 Maximian had two children with his Syrian wife , Eutropia : Maxentius and Fausta . There is no direct evidence in the ancient sources for their birthdates . Modern estimates of Maxentius ' birth year have varied from c . 277 to 287 , and most date Fausta 's birth to c . 289 or 290 . Theodora , the wife of Constantius Chlorus , is often called Maximian 's stepdaughter by ancient sources , leading to claims by Otto Seeck and Ernest Stein that she was born from an earlier marriage between Eutropia and Afranius Hannibalianus . Barnes challenges this view , saying that all " stepdaughter " sources derive their information from the partially unreliable work of history <unk> , while other , more reliable sources , refer to her as Maximian 's natural daughter . Barnes concludes that Theodora was born no later than c . 275 to an unnamed earlier wife of Maximian , possibly one of Hannibalianus ' daughters . 
 = = Appointment as Caesar = = 
 At Mediolanum ( Milan , Italy ) in July 285 , Diocletian proclaimed Maximian as his co @-@ ruler , or Caesar . The reasons for this decision are complex . With conflict in every province of the Empire , from Gaul to Syria , from Egypt to the lower Danube , Diocletian needed a lieutenant to manage his heavy workload . Historian Stephen Williams suggests that Diocletian considered himself a mediocre general and needed a man like Maximian to do most of his fighting . 
 Next , Diocletian was vulnerable in that he had no sons , just a daughter , Valeria , who could never succeed him . He was forced therefore to seek a co @-@ ruler from outside his family and that co @-@ ruler had to be someone he trusted . ( The historian William <unk> has argued that Diocletian , like heirless emperors before him , adopted Maximian as his filius Augusti ( " Augustan son " ) upon his appointment to the office . Some agree , but the historian Frank Kolb has stated that arguments for the adoption are based on <unk> of the <unk> evidence . Maximian did take Diocletian 's nomen ( family name ) Valerius , however . ) 
 Finally , Diocletian knew that single rule was dangerous and that precedent existed for dual rulership . Despite their military prowess , both sole @-@ emperors Aurelian and Probus had been easily removed from power . In contrast , just a few years earlier , the emperor Carus and his sons had ruled jointly , albeit not for long . Even the first emperor , Augustus , ( r . 27 BC – AD 19 ) , had shared power with his colleagues and more formal offices of co @-@ emperor had existed from Marcus Aurelius ( r . 161 – 180 ) on . 
 The dual system evidently worked well . About 287 , the two rulers ' relationship was re @-@ defined in religious terms , with Diocletian assuming the title <unk> and Maximian Herculius . The titles were pregnant with symbolism : Diocletian @-@ Jove had the dominant role of planning and commanding ; Maximian @-@ Hercules the heroic role of completing assigned tasks . Yet despite the symbolism , the emperors were not " gods " in the Imperial cult ( although they may have been hailed as such in Imperial panegyrics ) . Instead , they were the gods ' instruments , imposing the gods ' will on earth . Once the rituals were over , Maximian assumed control of the government of the West and was dispatched to Gaul to fight the rebels known as Bagaudae while Diocletian returned to the East . 
 = = Early campaigns in Gaul and Germany = = 
 The Bagaudae of Gaul are obscure figures , appearing fleetingly in the ancient sources , with their 285 uprising being their first appearance . The fourth @-@ century historian Eutropius described them as rural people under the leadership of Amandus and Aelianus , while Aurelius Victor called them bandits . The historian David S. Potter suggests that they were more than peasants , seeking either Gallic political autonomy or reinstatement of the recently deposed Carus ( a native of Gallia Narbonensis , in what would become southern France ) : in this case , they would be defecting imperial troops , not brigands . Although poorly equipped , led and trained – and therefore a poor match for Roman legions – Diocletian certainly considered the Bagaudae sufficient threat to merit an emperor to counter them . 
 Maximian traveled to Gaul , engaging the Bagaudae late in the summer of 285 . Details of the campaign are sparse and provide no tactical detail : the historical sources dwell only on Maximian 's virtues and victories . The panegyric to Maximian in 289 records that the rebels were defeated with a blend of harshness and leniency . As the campaign was against the Empire 's own citizens , and therefore distasteful , it went unrecorded in titles and official triumphs . Indeed , Maximian 's panegyrist declares : " I pass quickly over this episode , for I see in your magnanimity you would rather forget this victory than celebrate it . " By the end of the year , the revolt had significantly abated , and Maximian moved the bulk of his forces to the Rhine frontier , heralding a period of stability . 
 Maximian did not put down the Bagaudae swiftly enough to avoid a Germanic reaction . In the autumn of 285 , two barbarian armies – one of Burgundians and Alamanni , the other of <unk> and Heruli – forded the Rhine and entered Gaul . The first army was left to die of disease and hunger , while Maximian intercepted and defeated the second . He then established a Rhine headquarters in preparation for future campaigns , either at Moguntiacum ( Mainz , Germany ) , Augusta Treverorum ( Trier , Germany ) , or Colonia Agrippina ( Cologne , Germany ) . 
 = = Carausius = = 
 Although most of Gaul was pacified , regions bordering the English Channel still suffered from Frankish and Saxon piracy . The emperors Probus and Carinus had begun to fortify the Saxon Shore , but much remained to be done . For example , there is no archaeological evidence of naval bases at Dover and Boulogne during 270 – 285 . In response to the pirate problem , Maximian appointed <unk> Carausius , a <unk> from Germania Inferior ( southern and western Netherlands ) to command the Channel and to clear it of raiders . Carausius fared well , and by the end of 285 he was capturing pirate ships in great numbers . 
 Maximian soon heard that Carausius was waiting until the pirates had finished plundering before attacking and keeping their booty himself instead of returning it to the population at large or into the imperial treasury . Maximian ordered Carausius ' arrest and execution , prompting him to flee to Britain . Carausius ' support among the British was strong , and at least two British legions ( II Augusta and XX Valeria Victrix ) defected to him , as did some or all of a legion near Boulogne ( probably XXX Ulpia Victrix ) . Carausius quickly eliminated the few remaining loyalists in his army and declared himself Augustus . 
 Maximian could do little about the revolt . He had no fleet – he had given it to Carausius – and was busy quelling the Heruli and the Franks . Meanwhile , Carausius strengthened his position by enlarging his fleet , enlisting Frankish mercenaries , and paying his troops well . By the autumn of 286 , Britain , much of northwestern Gaul , and the entire Channel coast , was under his control . Carausius declared himself head of an independent British state , an Imperium <unk> and issued coin of a markedly higher purity than that of Maximian and Diocletian , earning the support of British and Gallic merchants . Even Maximian 's troops were vulnerable to Carausius ' influence and wealth . 
 = = Maximian appointed Augustus = = 
 Spurred by the crisis with Carausius , on April 1 , 286 , Maximian took the title of Augustus . This gave him the same status as Carausius – so the clash was between two Augusti , rather than between an Augustus and a Caesar – and , in Imperial propaganda , Maximian was proclaimed Diocletian 's brother , his equal in authority and prestige . Diocletian could not have been present at Maximian 's appointment , causing Seeck to suggest that Maximian usurped the title and was only later recognized by Diocletian in hopes of avoiding civil war . This suggestion has not won much support , and the historian William Leadbetter has recently refuted it . Despite the physical distance between the emperors , Diocletian trusted Maximian enough to invest him with imperial powers , and Maximian still respected Diocletian enough to act in accordance with his will . 
 In theory , the Roman Empire was not divided by the dual imperium . Though divisions did take place – each emperor had his own court , army , and official residences – these were matters of practicality , not substance . Imperial propaganda from 287 on insists on a singular and indivisible Rome , a <unk> <unk> . As the panegyrist of 289 declares to Maximian : " So it is that this great empire is a communal possession for both of you , without any discord , nor would we endure there to be any dispute between you , but plainly you hold the state in equal measure as once those two Heracleidae , the Spartan Kings , had done . " Legal rulings were given and imperial celebrations took place in both emperors ' names , and the same coins were issued in both parts of the empire . Diocletian sometimes issued commands to Maximian 's province of Africa ; Maximian could presumably have done the same for Diocletian 's territory . 
 = = Campaigns against Rhenish tribes = = 
 = = = Campaigns in 286 and 287 = = = 
 Maximian realized that he could not immediately suppress Carausius and campaigned instead against Rhenish tribes . These tribes were probably greater threats to Gallic peace anyway and included many supporters of Carausius . Although Maximian had many enemies along the river , they were more often in dispute with each other than in combat with the Empire . Few clear dates survive for Maximian 's campaigns on the Rhine beyond a general range of 285 to 288 . While receiving the consular fasces on January 1 , 287 , Maximian was interrupted by news of a barbarian raid . <unk> his toga and donning his armor , he marched against the barbarians and , although they were not entirely dispersed , he celebrated a victory in Gaul later that year . 
 Maximian believed the Burgundian and Alemanni tribes of the Moselle @-@ Vosges region to be the greatest threat , so he targeted them first . He campaigned using scorched earth tactics , laying waste to their land and reducing their numbers through famine and disease . After the Burgundians and Alemanni , Maximian moved against the weaker Heruli and <unk> . He cornered and defeated them in a single battle . He fought in person , riding along the battle line until the Germanic forces broke . Roman forces pursued the fleeing tribal armies and routed them . With his enemies weakened from starvation , Maximian launched a great invasion across the Rhine . He moved deep into Germanic territory , bringing destruction to his enemies ' homelands and demonstrating the superiority of Roman arms . By the winter of 287 , he had the advantage and the Rhenish lands were free of Germanic tribesmen . Maximian 's panegyrist declared : " All that I see beyond the Rhine is Roman . " 
 = = = Joint campaign against the Alamanni = = = 
 The following spring , as Maximian made preparations for dealing with Carausius , Diocletian returned from the East . The emperors met that year , but neither date nor place is known with certainty . They probably agreed on a joint campaign against the Alamanni and a naval expedition against Carausius . 
 Later in the year , Maximian led a surprise invasion of the Agri <unk> – a region between the upper Rhine and upper Danube deep within Alamanni territory – while Diocletian invaded Germany via Raetia . Both emperors burned crops and food supplies as they went , destroying the Germans ' means of sustenance . They added large swathes of territory to the Empire and allowed Maximian 's build @-@ up to proceed without further disturbance . In the aftermath of the war , towns along the Rhine were rebuilt , bridgeheads created on the eastern banks at such places as Mainz and Cologne , and a military frontier was established , comprising forts , roads , and fortified towns . A military highway through <unk> ( Tournai , Belgium ) , <unk> ( Bavay , France ) , <unk> <unk> ( Tongeren , Belgium ) , <unk> <unk> ( Maastricht , Netherlands ) , and Cologne connected points along the frontier . 
 = = = Constantius , Gennobaudes , and resettlement = = = 
 In early 288 , Maximian appointed his praetorian prefect Constantius Chlorus , husband of Maximian 's daughter Theodora , to lead a campaign against Carausius ' Frankish allies . These Franks controlled the Rhine estuaries , thwarting sea @-@ attacks against Carausius . Constantius moved north through their territory , wreaking havoc , and reaching the North Sea . The Franks sued for peace and in the subsequent settlement Maximian reinstated the deposed Frankish king Gennobaudes . Gennobaudes became Maximian 's vassal and , with lesser Frankish chiefs in turn swearing loyalty to Gennobaudes , Roman regional dominance was assured . 
 Maximian allowed a settlement of Frisii , Salian Franks , <unk> and other tribes along a strip of Roman territory , either between the Rhine and Waal rivers from <unk> ( Nijmegen , Netherlands ) to <unk> , ( Utrecht , Netherlands ) or near Trier . These tribes were allowed to settle on the condition that they acknowledged Roman dominance . Their presence provided a ready pool of manpower and prevented the settlement of other Frankish tribes , giving Maximian a buffer along the northern Rhine and reducing his need to garrison the region . 
 = = Later campaigns in Britain and Gaul = = 
 = = = Failed expedition against Carausius = = = 
 By 289 , Maximian was prepared to invade Carausius ' Britain , but for some reason the plan failed . Maximian 's panegyrist of 289 was optimistic about the campaign 's prospects , but the panegyrist of 291 made no mention of it . Constantius ' panegyrist suggested that his fleet was lost to a storm , but this might simply have been to diminish the embarrassment of defeat . Diocletian curtailed his Eastern province tour soon after , perhaps on learning of Maximian 's failure . Diocletian returned in haste to the West , reaching Emesa by May 10 , 290 , and Sirmium on the Danube by July 1 , 290 . 
 Diocletian met Maximian in Milan either in late December 290 or January 291 . Crowds gathered to witness the event , and the emperors devoted much time to public pageantry . Potter , among others , has surmised that the ceremonies were arranged to demonstrate Diocletian 's continuing support for his faltering colleague . The rulers discussed matters of politics and war in secret , and they may have considered the idea of expanding the imperial college to include four emperors ( the Tetrarchy ) . Meanwhile , a deputation from the Roman Senate met with the rulers and renewed its infrequent contact with the imperial office . The emperors would not meet again until 303 . 
 Following Maximian 's failure to invade in 289 , an uneasy truce with Carausius began . Maximian tolerated Carausius ' rule in Britain and on the continent but refused to grant the secessionist state formal legitimacy . For his part , Carausius was content with his territories beyond the Continental coast of Gaul . Diocletian , however , would not tolerate this affront to his rule . Faced with Carausius ' secession and further challenges on the Egyptian , Syrian , and Danubian borders , he realized that two emperors were insufficient to manage the Empire . On March 1 , 293 at Milan , Maximian appointed Constantius to the office of Caesar . On either the same day or a month later , Diocletian did the same for Galerius , thus establishing the " Tetrarchy " , or " rule of four " . Constantius was made to understand that he must succeed where Maximian had failed and defeat Carausius . 
 = = = Campaign against Allectus = = = 
 Constantius met expectations quickly and efficiently and by 293 had expelled <unk> forces from northern Gaul . In the same year , Carausius was assassinated and replaced by his treasurer , Allectus . Constantius marched up the coast to the Rhine and Scheldt estuaries where he was victorious over Carausius ' Frankish allies , taking the title Germanicus maximus . His sights now set on Britain , Constantius spent the following years building an invasion fleet . Maximian , still in Italy after the appointment of Constantius , was apprised of the invasion plans and , in the summer of 296 , returned to Gaul . There , he held the Rhenish frontiers against Carausius ' Frankish allies while Constantius launched his invasion of Britain . Allectus was killed on the North Downs in battle with Constantius ' praetorian prefect , Asclepiodotus . Constantius himself had landed near <unk> ( Dover ) and marched on Londinium ( London ) , whose citizens greeted him as a liberator . 
 = = Campaigns in North Africa = = 
 With Constantius ' victorious return , Maximian was able to focus on the conflict in Mauretania ( Northwest Africa ) . As Roman authority weakened during the third century , nomadic Berber tribes harassed settlements in the region with increasingly severe consequences . In 289 , the governor of Mauretania Caesariensis ( roughly modern Algeria ) gained a temporary respite by pitting a small army against the <unk> and <unk> , but the raiders soon returned . In 296 , Maximian raised an army , from Praetorian cohorts , <unk> , Egyptian , and Danubian legionaries , Gallic and German auxiliaries , and Thracian recruits , advancing through Spain that autumn . He may have defended the region against raiding Moors before crossing the Strait of Gibraltar into Mauretania Tingitana ( roughly modern Morocco ) to protect the area from Frankish pirates . 
 By March 297 , Maximian had begun a bloody offensive against the Berbers . The campaign was lengthy , and Maximian spent the winter of 297 – 298 resting in Carthage before returning to the field . Not content to drive them back into their homelands in the Atlas Mountains – from which they could continue to wage war – Maximian ventured deep into Berber territory . The terrain was unfavorable , and the Berbers were skilled at guerrilla warfare , but Maximian pressed on . Apparently wishing to inflict as much punishment as possible on the tribes , he devastated previously secure land , killed as many as he could , and drove the remainder back into the Sahara . His campaign was concluded by the spring of 298 and , on March 10 , he made a triumphal entry into Carthage . Inscriptions there record the people 's gratitude to Maximian , hailing him – as Constantius had been on his entry to London – as <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " restorer of the eternal light " ) . Maximian returned to Italy in 299 to celebrate another triumph in Rome in the spring . 
 = = Leisure and retirement = = 
 After his Mauretanian campaign , Maximian returned to the north of Italy , living a life of leisure in palaces in Milan and <unk> , and leaving warfare to his subordinate Constantius . Maximian was more aggressive in his relationship with the Senate than Constantius , and Lactantius contends that he terrorized senators , to the point of falsely charging and subsequently executing several , including the prefect of Rome in 301 / 2 . In contrast , Constantius kept up good relations with the senatorial aristocracy and spent his time in active defense of the empire . He took up arms against the Franks in 300 or 301 and in 302 – while Maximian was resting in Italy – continued to campaign against Germanic tribes on the Upper Rhine . 
 Maximian was only disturbed from his rest in 303 by Diocletian 's <unk> , the 20 @-@ year anniversary of his reign , in Rome . Some evidence suggests that it was then that Diocletian exacted a promise from Maximian to retire together , passing their titles as Augusti to the Caesars Constantius and Galerius . Presumably Maximian 's son Maxentius and Constantius ' son Constantine – children raised in Nicomedia together – would then become the new Caesars . While Maximian might not have wished to retire , Diocletian was still in control and there was little resistance . Before retirement , Maximian would receive one final moment of glory by officiating at the Secular Games in 304 . 
 On May 1 , 305 , in separate ceremonies in Milan and Nicomedia , Diocletian and Maximian retired simultaneously . The succession did not go entirely to Maximian 's liking : perhaps because of Galerius ' influence , Severus and Maximinus were appointed Caesar , thus excluding Maxentius . Both the newly appointed Caesars had had long military careers and were close to Galerius : Maximinus was his nephew and Severus a former army comrade . Maximian quickly soured to the new tetrarchy , which saw Galerius assume the dominant position Diocletian once held . Although Maximian led the ceremony that proclaimed Severus as Caesar , within two years he was sufficiently dissatisfied to support his son 's rebellion against the new regime . Diocletian retired to the expansive palace he had built in his homeland , Dalmatia near Salona on the Adriatic . Maximian retired to villas in Campania or Lucania , where he lived a life of ease and luxury . Although far from the political centers of the Empire , Diocletian and Maximian remained close enough to stay in regular contact . 
 = = Maxentius ' rebellion = = 
 After the death of Constantius on July 25 , 306 , Constantine assumed the title of Augustus . This displeased Galerius , who instead offered Constantine the title of Caesar , which Constantine accepted . The title of Augustus then went to Severus . Maxentius was jealous of Constantine 's power , and on October 28 , 306 , he persuaded a cohort of imperial guardsmen to declare him as Augustus . Uncomfortable with sole leadership , Maxentius sent a set of imperial robes to Maximian and saluted him as " Augustus for the second time " , offering him theoretic equal rule but less actual power and a lower rank . 
 Galerius refused to recognize Maxentius and sent Severus with an army to Rome to depose him . As many of Severus ' soldiers had served under Maximian , and had taken Maxentius ' bribes , most of the army defected to Maxentius . Severus fled to Ravenna , which Maximian besieged . The city was strongly fortified so Maximian offered terms , which Severus accepted . Maximian then seized Severus and took him under guard to a public villa in southern Rome , where he was kept as a hostage . In the autumn of 307 , Galerius led a second force against Maxentius but he again failed to take Rome , and retreated north with his army mostly intact . 
 While Maxentius built up Rome 's defenses , Maximian made his way to Gaul to negotiate with Constantine . A deal was struck in which Constantine would marry Maximian 's younger daughter Fausta and be elevated to Augustan rank in Maxentius ' secessionist regime . In return , Constantine would reaffirm the old family alliance between Maximian and Constantius , and support Maxentius ' cause in Italy but would remain neutral in the war with Galerius . The deal was sealed with a double ceremony in Trier in the late summer of 307 , at which Constantine married Fausta and was declared Augustus by Maximian . 
 Maximian returned to Rome in the winter of 307 – 8 but soon fell out with his son and in the spring of 308 challenged his right to rule before an assembly of Roman soldiers . He spoke of Rome 's sickly government , disparaged Maxentius for having weakened it , and ripped the imperial toga from Maxentius ' shoulders . He expected the soldiers to recognize him but they sided with Maxentius , and Maximian was forced to leave Italy in disgrace . 
 On November 11 , 308 , to resolve the political instability , Galerius called Diocletian ( out of retirement ) and Maximian to a general council meeting at the military city of Carnuntum on the upper Danube . There , Maximian was forced to abdicate again and Constantine was again demoted to Caesar , with Maximinus the Caesar in the east . Licinius , a loyal military companion to Galerius , was appointed Augustus of the West In early 309 Maximian returned to the court of Constantine in Gaul , the only court that would still accept him . After Constantine and Maximinus refused to be placated with the titles of Sons of the Augusti , they were promoted in early 310 , with the result that there were now four Augusti . 
 = = Rebellion against Constantine = = 
 In 310 , Maximian rebelled against Constantine while the Emperor was on campaign against the Franks . Maximian had been sent south to Arles with part of Constantine 's army to defend against attacks by Maxentius in southern Gaul . In Arles , Maximian announced that Constantine was dead and took up the imperial purple . Although Maximian offered bribes to all who would support him , most of Constantine 's army remained loyal , and Maximian was compelled to leave the city . Constantine soon heard of the rebellion , abandoned his campaign against the Franks , and moved quickly to southern Gaul , where he confronted the fleeing Maximian at Massilia ( Marseille ) . The town was better able to withstand a long siege than Arles , but it made little difference as loyal citizens opened the rear gates to Constantine . Maximian was captured , reproved for his crimes , and stripped of his title for the third and last time . Constantine granted Maximian some clemency but strongly encouraged his suicide . In July 310 , Maximian hanged himself . 
 Despite the earlier rupture in relations , after Maximian 's suicide Maxentius presented himself as his father 's devoted son . He minted coins bearing his father 's deified image and proclaimed his desire to avenge his death . 
 Constantine initially presented the suicide as an unfortunate family tragedy . By 311 , however , he was spreading another version . According to this , after Constantine had pardoned him , Maximian planned to murder Constantine in his sleep . Fausta learned of the plot and warned Constantine , who put a eunuch in his own place in bed . Maximian was apprehended when he killed the eunuch and was offered suicide , which he accepted . In addition to the propaganda , Constantine instituted a damnatio memoriae on Maximian , destroying all inscriptions referring to him and eliminating any public work bearing his image . 
 Constantine defeated Maxentius at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge on October 28 , 312 . Maxentius died , and Italy came under Constantine 's rule . Eutropia swore on oath that Maxentius was not Maximian 's son , and Maximian 's memory was rehabilitated . His apotheosis under Maxentius was declared null and void , and he was re @-@ consecrated as a god , probably in 317 . He began appearing on Constantine 's coinage as <unk> , or divine , by 318 , together with the deified Constantius and Claudius Gothicus . The three were hailed as Constantine 's forbears . They were called " the best of emperors " . Through his daughters Fausta and Flavia , Maximian was grandfather or great @-@ grandfather to every reigning emperor from 337 to 363 .

Traveling northeast , the highway traverses a hill and cliff , passing Browns Lake , and turns west . The direction of the roadway becomes north through a narrow valley and SR 231 arrives in <unk> as Oregon Street . The roadway briefly turns east as Main Street before crossing a BNSF Railway line and continuing northeast alongside the tracks . After turning north into the plains , the highway parallels Crab Creek to intersect US 2 west of Reardan . 
 Becoming concurrent with US 2 , the road becomes Broadway Street and enters Reardan . SR 231 turns north at Aspen Street and crosses the Eastern Washington Gateway Railroad and a marsh via a causeway . As Spring Creek Road , the highway travels northwest parallel to Spring Creek into Spring Creek Canyon . After the canyon , the roadway crosses the Spokane River on the Spokane River Bridge at Long Lake Dam , the border between Lincoln and Stevens counties , west of Little Falls Dam and Long Lake . Nearly a mile north of the bridge , SR 231 intersects SR 291 , a connector to Spokane . After the intersection , the highway travels north through the community of Ford and continues through a valley into Springdale .

 = = History = = 
 SR 231 was established in 1964 , but sections of the current route have been in the state highway system as early as 1909 , when State Road 7 was established and included a section near Reardan . In 1913 , the Inland Empire Highway was established and connected Loon Lake to Springdale and Chewelah . A county @-@ maintained road connected Sprague to Browns Lake by 1919 and in 1923 , State Road 7 became State Road 2 and the Inland Empire Highway became State Road 3 . The U.S. route system was formed in 1926 and two highways , numbered U.S. Route 10 ( US 10 ) and U.S. Route 395 ( US 395 ) , were co @-@ signed with State Roads 2 and 3 , respectively . State Road 2 became Primary State Highway 2 ( PSH 2 ) in 1937 and a secondary route , Secondary State Highway 2G ( SSH 2G ) was created , extending from Sprague to Reardan , in 1937 . State Road 3 became PSH 3 during the same year and a secondary route , SSH 3J , was also established to span from the Little Falls Dam at Long Lake to Springdale . 
 US 10 was replaced by the western extension of US 2 in 1946 . Three years later , in 1949 , the Spokane River Bridge at Long Lake Dam was constructed and spanned from the southern terminus of SSH 3J to Lincoln County . In 1957 , PSH 3 and US 395 were moved to an eastern route bypassing Springdale , while SSH 3J was extended north towards Chewelah and a branch of the highway was added to Loon Lake , both along the former route of PSH 3 . SSH 3J was extended south to PSH 2 and US 2 in Reardan , east of the northern terminus of SSH 2G , in 1963 . During the 1964 highway renumbering , SR 231 was created from SSH 2G and SSH 3J and became concurrent with US 2 ; US 2 replaced PSH 2 and US 395 replaced PSH 3 , while the branch of SSH 3J to Loon Lake became SR 292 . The Spokane River Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 2 , 1995 along with the rest of the bridges on the Spokane River northwest of Spokane , and the bridge was repaired in late 2008 .

 = Suillus collinitus = 
 Suillus collinitus is a pored mushroom of the genus Suillus in the family Suillaceae . It is an edible mushroom found in European pine forests . The mushroom has a reddish to chestnut @-@ brown cap that reaches up to 11 cm ( 4 @.@ 3 in ) in diameter , and a yellow stem measuring up to 7 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) tall by 1 to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 to 0 @.@ 8 in ) thick . On the underside of the cap are small angular pores , initially bright yellow before turning greenish @-@ brown with age . A characteristic feature that helps to distinguish it from similar Suillus species , such as S. granulatus , is the pinkish mycelia at the base of the stem . 
 Molecular analysis has shown the species to be related to other typical Mediterranean Suillus species such as S. bellinii , S. luteus , and S. mediterraneensis . S. collinitus is a mycorrhizal species , and forms associations with several species of pine , most notably the Aleppo pine . This tree species is commonly used in reforestation schemes and soil conservation against erosion in the Mediterranean region , and S. collinitus is often used as a beneficial <unk> to help the young trees better survive in typically harsh soil conditions . 
 = = Taxonomy , phylogeny , and naming = = 
 The species was first described as Boletus collinitus by Elias Magnus Fries in 1838 . Otto Kuntze transferred it to the genus Suillus in his 1898 Revisio Generum Plantarum . In 1969 Dutch mycologist <unk> <unk> described the variety S. collinitus var. aureus ( as S. <unk> var. aureus ; S. <unk> is a synonym of S. collinitus ) based on a collection from Switzerland . The variety <unk> was described in 1998 by Giampaolo Simonini and colleagues from Italian collections . 
 A 1996 molecular analysis of 38 different Suillus species used the sequences of their internal transcribed spacers to infer phylogenetic relationships and clarify the taxonomy of the genus . The results indicated that S. collinitus is most closely related to a specimen of S. <unk> collected from Nepal . According to the authors , this Nepalese isolate probably represents a species distinct from North American and European isolates , based on morphology and host tree association . In 2006 , a phylogenetic analysis of Suillus isolates collected from Spain showed that S. collinitus was closely related to other species " typical of the Mediterranean area " , namely S. bellinii , S. luteus , and S. mediterraneensis . 
 The specific epithet collinitus is derived from Latin , and means " smeared " or " greased " . The British botanist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke called the mushroom the " ringless yellow boletus " in an 1873 publication . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit body of Suillus collinitus is a medium to large , fleshy bolete . The cap is initially rounded , becoming convex and finally flat , reaching up to 11 cm ( 4 @.@ 3 in ) in diameter . The cap is covered with a brown cuticle of variable shade that is decorated with minuscule radial striations , which become more obvious in fully expanded specimens and especially in dry weather . The cap is often shaped irregularly and becomes viscid ( sticky ) when damp . The tubes are short and their stem attachment is usually slightly decurrent to adnate . The small and angular pores are yellow but darken with age . Young , fresh specimens sometimes bear droplets of a clear fluid that collect on the pore surface . 
 The cylindrical stem is often short and stubby , typically 4 – 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 8 in ) tall by 1 – 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 0 @.@ 8 in ) thick , coloured yellowish and ornamented with sparse reddish @-@ brown granules . There is no ring . The base of the stem bears pink overtones and is attached to distinctively pink mycelial threads , which are visible when the fruit body is uprooted . The flesh is yellowish , thick and soft . In a colour reaction test with ammonia solution , the flesh turns reddish . 
 The spores are seen ochre @-@ brown in mass , but pale yellow when viewed with a light microscope . They are fusiform ( tapered at each end ) , sized 8 – 10 @.@ 5 by 3 – 4 @.@ 5 μm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells of the hymenium ) are four @-@ spored . 
 Especially characteristic for S. collinitus are the cap striations and pink mycelium . The fungus in many aspects resembles S. granulatus – a common species in European pine forests . S. granulatus , however , has a homogenous brown cap without striations , and its mycelium is characteristically white . 
 = = = Varieties = = = 
 Two varieties of S. collinitus have been described . S. collinitus var. aureus has a golden @-@ yellow cap . S. collinitus var. <unk> , originally found in Italy growing in poor acidic soil in association with Aleppo pine ( Pinus halepensis ) , is distinguished by a glutinous brown veil at the base of the stem , and a slender white felting at the cap margin . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Suillus collinitus is often found in the same habitat with other thermophilic species , including S. mediterraneensis and S. bellinii , especially in the Mediterranean basin . Some common species which occur throughout much of Europe and also associate with two @-@ needled pines include S. luteus and S. granulatus . 
 = = = Edibility = = = 
 Various authors regard Suillus collinitus as edible with a sour odor and nondescript taste . It is advisable , as for all species of Suillus , to pick only young specimens and to peel the cuticle before preparation . The mushroom contains several tocopherols , a class of chemical compounds collectively known as vitamin E , and which confer antioxidant activity . They also contain several organic acids , most predominantly the pairs malic and <unk> acids , and citric and <unk> acid , which respectively make up 42 % and 30 % of total organic acids . The composition and concentration of organic acids in mushrooms are major factors in influencing their flavour ; some organic acids contribute to antioxidant activity . 
 = = Distribution , habitat , and ecology = = 
 Suillus collinitus is found throughout Europe . It is an ectomycorrhizal fungus , forming mutually beneficial symbiotic relationships with several species of pine ( Pinus ) . These include several two @-@ needled European species of pine : Aleppo pine ( P. halepensis ) European black pine ( P. nigra ) , stone pine ( P. pinea ) , and Scots pine ( P. sylvestris ) . The fungus favours limestone soils . S. collinitus is thermophilic , commonly occurring in southern Europe . It is rarely seen in more northern regions , such as the British Isles and Poland . It is red @-@ listed in Denmark as near @-@ threatened , and in Estonia as endangered . It has also been collected in Iran . 
 Suillus collinitus is the most frequent fungus associating with Aleppo pine – a hardy tree utilised for reforestation schemes and soil conservation against erosion in the Mediterranean region . A study performed in the south of France discovered that S. collinitus and S. mediterraneensis are multi @-@ stage ectomycorrhizal fungi , associating with both young and mature stands of Aleppo pine . These two species may play a key role in the survival and adaptation of this species of pine on disturbed calcareous sites . Roots mycorrhizal with S. collinitus were found capable of surviving successive disturbances by fire or ploughing . Moreover , the fungus retained its viability to propagate via its mycelial network which helped the recolonisation effort of newly introduced trees . The fungus has also been shown to improve the growth of Mediterranean pines grown in greenhouses and nurseries . Unlike other Suillus species that grow in wet climates , such as S. <unk> and S. spraguei , S. collinitus does not typically produce fruit bodies in young plantations . This fruiting behaviour may be attributed to the typically nutrient @-@ poor xeric Mediterranean environment in combination with a lack of tree canopy . The absence of above @-@ ground indicators of fungal presence makes analysis of underground populations difficult ; molecular markers have been developed to assist in monitoring fungal growth and ectomycorrhizal formation and persistence in young plantations . 
 The <unk> formed between several Suillus species and Aleppo pine has been studied under in vitro conditions in the laboratory . Tree shoots inoculated with either S. collinitus , S. bellinii , and S. mediterraneensis tended to grow better and showed superior mycorrhizal development than other tested Suillus species , suggesting that the three have a " physiological specificity " for the tree . A 2010 publication reported that the fungal hyphae are covered in crystals of oxalic acid , which , in addition to reducing soil pH , reduces grazing by the soil <unk> <unk> candida . 
 = McDonnell Douglas F @-@ 4 Phantom II = 
 The McDonnell Douglas F @-@ 4 Phantom II is a tandem two @-@ seat , twin @-@ engine , all @-@ weather , long @-@ range supersonic jet interceptor aircraft / fighter @-@ bomber originally developed for the United States Navy by McDonnell Aircraft . It first entered service in 1960 with the U.S. Navy . Proving highly adaptable , it was also adopted by the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Air Force , and by the mid @-@ 1960s had become a major part of their respective air wings . 
 The Phantom is a large fighter with a top speed of over Mach 2 @.@ 2 . It can carry more than 18 @,@ 000 pounds ( 8 @,@ 400 kg ) of weapons on nine external hardpoints , including air @-@ to @-@ air missiles , air @-@ to @-@ ground missiles , and various bombs . The F @-@ 4 , like other interceptors of its time , was designed without an internal cannon . Later models incorporated an M61 Vulcan rotary cannon . Beginning in 1959 , it set 15 world records for in @-@ flight performance , including an absolute speed record , and an absolute altitude record . 
 During the Vietnam War , the F @-@ 4 was used extensively ; it served as the principal air superiority fighter for both the Navy and Air Force , and became important in the ground @-@ attack and aerial reconnaissance roles late in the war . The Phantom has the distinction of being the last U.S. fighter flown to attain ace status in the 20th century . During the Vietnam War , the U.S. Air Force had one pilot and two weapon systems officers ( <unk> ) , and the US Navy had one pilot and one radar intercept officer ( RIO ) become aces by achieving five aerial kills against enemy fighter aircraft . The F @-@ 4 continued to form a major part of U.S. military air power throughout the 1970s and 1980s , being gradually replaced by more modern aircraft such as the F @-@ 15 Eagle and F @-@ 16 in the U.S. Air Force , the Grumman F @-@ 14 Tomcat in the U.S. Navy , and the F / A @-@ 18 Hornet in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps . 
 The F @-@ 4 Phantom II remained in use by the U.S. in the reconnaissance and Wild Weasel ( Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses ) roles in the 1991 Gulf War , finally leaving service in 1996 . It was also the only aircraft used by both U.S. flight demonstration teams : the USAF Thunderbirds ( F @-@ 4E ) and the US Navy Blue Angels ( F @-@ 4J ) . The F @-@ 4 was also operated by the armed forces of 11 other nations . Israeli Phantoms saw extensive combat in several Arab – Israeli conflicts , while Iran used its large fleet of Phantoms in the Iran – Iraq War . Phantoms remain in front line service with seven countries , and in use as a target drone in the U.S. Air Force . Phantom production ran from 1958 to 1981 , with a total of 5 @,@ 195 built , making it the most numerous American supersonic military aircraft . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 In 1952 , McDonnell 's Chief of Aerodynamics , Dave Lewis , was appointed by CEO Jim McDonnell to be the company 's preliminary design manager . With no new aircraft competitions on the horizon , internal studies concluded the Navy had the greatest need for a new and different aircraft type : an attack fighter . 
 In 1953 , McDonnell Aircraft began work on revising its F3H Demon naval fighter , seeking expanded capabilities and better performance . The company developed several projects including a variant powered by a Wright <unk> engine , and variants powered by two Wright J65 engines , or two General Electric J79 engines . The J79 @-@ powered version promised a top speed of Mach 1 @.@ 97 . On 19 September 1953 , McDonnell approached the United States Navy with a proposal for the " Super Demon " . Uniquely , the aircraft was to be modular — it could be fitted with one- or two @-@ seat noses for different missions , with different nose cones to accommodate radar , photo cameras , four 20 mm ( .79 in ) cannon , or 56 <unk> unguided rockets in addition to the nine hardpoints under the wings and the fuselage . The Navy was sufficiently interested to order a full @-@ scale mock @-@ up of the F3H @-@ G / H , but felt that the upcoming Grumman <unk> @-@ 9 and Vought <unk> @-@ 1 already satisfied the need for a supersonic fighter . 
 The McDonnell design was therefore reworked into an all @-@ weather fighter @-@ bomber with 11 external hardpoints for weapons and on 18 October 1954 , the company received a letter of intent for two YAH @-@ 1 prototypes . On 26 May 1955 , four Navy officers arrived at the McDonnell offices and , within an hour , presented the company with an entirely new set of requirements . Because the Navy already had the Douglas A @-@ 4 Skyhawk for ground attack and F @-@ 8 Crusader for dogfighting , the project now had to fulfill the need for an all @-@ weather fleet defense interceptor . A second crewman was added to operate the powerful radar . 
 = = = XF4H @-@ 1 prototype = = = 
 The XF4H @-@ 1 was designed to carry four semi @-@ recessed AAM @-@ N @-@ 6 Sparrow III radar @-@ guided missiles , and to be powered by two J79 @-@ GE @-@ 8 engines . As in the McDonnell F @-@ 101 Voodoo , the engines sat low in the fuselage to maximize internal fuel capacity and ingested air through fixed geometry intakes . The thin @-@ section wing had a leading edge sweep of 45 ° and was equipped with blown flaps for better low @-@ speed handling . 
 Wind tunnel testing had revealed lateral instability requiring the addition of 5 ° dihedral to the wings . To avoid redesigning the titanium central section of the aircraft , McDonnell engineers angled up only the outer portions of the wings by 12 ° , which averaged to the required 5 ° over the entire wingspan . The wings also received the distinctive " dogtooth " for improved control at high angles of attack . The all @-@ moving tailplane was given 23 ° of anhedral to improve control at high angles of attack while still keeping the tailplane clear of the engine exhaust . In addition , air intakes were equipped with variable geometry ramps to regulate airflow to the engines at supersonic speeds . All @-@ weather intercept capability was achieved thanks to the AN / APQ @-@ 50 radar . To accommodate carrier operations , the landing gear was designed to withstand landings with a sink rate of 23 ft / s ( 7 m / s ) , while the nose strut could extend by some 20 in ( 51 cm ) to increase angle of attack at takeoff . 
 On 25 July 1955 , the Navy ordered two XF4H @-@ 1 test aircraft and five <unk> @-@ 1 pre @-@ production examples . The Phantom made its maiden flight on 27 May 1958 with Robert C. Little at the controls . A hydraulic problem precluded retraction of the landing gear but subsequent flights went more smoothly . Early testing resulted in redesign of the air intakes , including the distinctive addition of 12 @,@ 500 holes to " bleed off " the slow @-@ moving boundary layer air from the surface of each intake ramp . Series production aircraft also featured splitter plates to divert the boundary layer away from the engine intakes . The aircraft soon squared off against the <unk> @-@ 3 Crusader III . Due to operator workload , the Navy wanted a two @-@ seat aircraft and on 17 December 1958 the F4H was declared a winner . Delays with the J79 @-@ GE @-@ 8 engines meant that the first production aircraft were fitted with J79 @-@ GE @-@ 2 and − 2A engines , each having 16 @,@ 100 lbf ( 71 @.@ 8 kN ) of afterburning thrust . In 1959 , the Phantom began carrier suitability trials with the first complete launch @-@ recovery cycle performed on 15 February 1960 from Independence . 
 There were proposals to name the F4H " Satan " and " Mithras " . In the end , the aircraft was given the less controversial name " Phantom II " , the first " Phantom " being another McDonnell jet fighter , the FH @-@ 1 Phantom . The Phantom II was briefly given the designation F @-@ 110A and the name " Spectre " by the USAF , but neither name was officially used . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 Early in production , the radar was upgraded to the Westinghouse AN / APQ @-@ 72 , and AN @-@ APG @-@ 50 with a larger radar antenna , necessitating the bulbous nose , and the canopy was reworked to improve visibility and make the rear cockpit less claustrophobic . During its career the Phantom underwent many changes in the form of numerous variants developed . 
 The USAF received Phantoms as the result of Defense Secretary Robert McNamara 's push to create a unified fighter for all branches of the military . After an F @-@ 4B won the " Operation <unk> " fly @-@ off against the Convair F @-@ 106 Delta Dart , the USAF borrowed two Naval F @-@ 4Bs , temporarily designating them F @-@ 110A " Spectre " in January 1962 , and developed requirements for their own version . Unlike the navy 's focus on interception , the USAF emphasized a fighter @-@ bomber role . With McNamara 's unification of designations on 18 September 1962 , the Phantom became the F @-@ 4 with the naval version designated F @-@ 4B and USAF F @-@ 4C . The first air force Phantom flew on 27 May 1963 , exceeding Mach 2 on its maiden flight . 
 The USN operated the F4H @-@ 1 ( re @-@ designated F @-@ 4A in 1962 ) with J79 @-@ GE @-@ 2 and <unk> engines of 16 @,@ 100 lbf ( 71 @.@ 62 kN ) thrust and later builds receiving -8 engines . A total of 45 F @-@ 4As were built and none saw combat and most ended up as test or training aircraft . The USN and USMC received the first definitive Phantom , the F @-@ 4B which was equipped with the Westinghouse APQ @-@ 72 radar ( pulse only ) , a Texas Instruments AAA @-@ 4 Infra @-@ red search and track pod under the nose , an AN / AJB @-@ 3 bombing system and powered by J79 @-@ GE @-@ 8 , <unk> and <unk> engines of 10 @,@ 900 lbf ( 48 @.@ 5 kN ) dry and 16 @,@ 950 lbf ( 75 @.@ 4 kN ) afterburner ( reheat ) with the first flight on 25 March 1961 . 649 F @-@ 4Bs were built with deliveries beginning in 1961 and VF @-@ 121 Pacemakers receiving the first examples at NAS Miramar . 
 The F @-@ 4J had improved air @-@ to @-@ air and ground @-@ attack capability ; deliveries begun in 1966 and ended in 1972 with 522 built . It was equipped with J79 @-@ GE @-@ 10 engines with 17 @,@ 844 lbf ( 79 @.@ 374 kN ) thrust , the Westinghouse AN / AWG @-@ 10 Fire Control System ( making the F @-@ 4J the first fighter in the world with operational look @-@ down / shoot @-@ down capability ) , a new integrated missile control system and the AN / AJB @-@ 7 bombing system for expanded ground attack capability . 
 The F @-@ 4N ( updated F @-@ 4Bs ) with smokeless engines and F @-@ 4J aerodynamic improvements started in 1972 under a U.S. Navy @-@ initiated refurbishment program called " Project Bee Line " with 228 converted by 1978 . The F @-@ 4S model resulted from the refurbishment of 265 F @-@ 4Js with J79 @-@ GE @-@ 17 smokeless engines of 17 @,@ 900 lbf ( 79 @.@ 379 kN ) , AWG @-@ 10B radar with digitized circuitry for improved performance and reliability , Honeywell AN / AVG @-@ 8 Visual Target Acquisition Set or <unk> ( world 's first operational Helmet Sighting System ) , classified avionics improvements , airframe reinforcement and leading edge slats for enhanced maneuvering . The USMC also operated the RF @-@ 4B with reconnaissance cameras with 46 built . 
 Phantom II production ended in the United States in 1979 after 5 @,@ 195 had been built ( 5 @,@ 057 by McDonnell Douglas and 138 in Japan by Mitsubishi ) . Of these , 2 @,@ 874 went to the USAF , 1 @,@ 264 to the Navy and Marine Corps , and the rest to foreign customers . The last U.S.-built F @-@ 4 went to South Korea , while the last F @-@ 4 built was an F @-@ 4EJ built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan and delivered on 20 May 1981 . As of 2008 , 631 Phantoms were in service worldwide , while the Phantom also remains in use as a target drone operated by the U.S. military . 
 = = = World records = = = 
 To show off their new fighter , the Navy led a series of record @-@ breaking flights early in Phantom development : All in all , the Phantom set 16 world records . Except for <unk> , all records were achieved in unmodified production aircraft . Five of the speed records remained unbeaten until the F @-@ 15 Eagle appeared in 1975 . 
 Operation Top Flight : On 6 December 1959 , the second XF4H @-@ 1 performed a zoom climb to a world record 98 @,@ 557 ft ( 30 @,@ 040 m ) . Commander Lawrence E. Flint , Jr . , USN accelerated his aircraft to Mach 2 @.@ 5 ( 1 @,@ 650 mph ; 2 @,@ 660 km / h ) at 47 @,@ 000 ft ( 14 @,@ 330 m ) and climbed to 90 @,@ 000 ft ( 27 @,@ 430 m ) at a 45 ° angle . He then shut down the engines and glided to the peak altitude . As the aircraft fell through 70 @,@ 000 ft ( 21 @,@ 300 m ) , Flint restarted the engines and resumed normal flight . 
 On 5 September 1960 , an F4H @-@ 1 averaged 1 @,@ 216 @.@ 78 mph ( 1 @,@ 958 @.@ 16 km / h ) over a 500 km ( 311 mi ) closed @-@ circuit course .

 Operation <unk> : To celebrate the 50th anniversary of Naval aviation ( L is the Roman numeral for 50 and ANA stood for Anniversary of Naval Aviation ) on 24 May 1961 , Phantoms flew across the continental United States in under three hours and included several tanker refuelings . The fastest of the aircraft averaged 869 @.@ 74 mph ( 1 @,@ 400 @.@ 28 km / h ) and completed the trip in 2 hours 47 minutes , earning the pilot ( and future NASA Astronaut ) , Lieutenant Richard Gordon , USN and RIO , Lieutenant Bobbie Young , USN , the 1961 Bendix trophy .

 = = = Overview = = = 
 The F @-@ 4 Phantom is a tandem @-@ seat fighter @-@ bomber designed as a carrier @-@ based interceptor to fill the U.S. Navy 's fleet defense fighter role . Innovations in the F @-@ 4 included an advanced pulse @-@ Doppler radar and extensive use of titanium in its airframe . 
 Despite imposing dimensions and a maximum takeoff weight of over 60 @,@ 000 lb ( 27 @,@ 000 kg ) , the F @-@ 4 has a top speed of Mach 2 @.@ 23 and an initial climb rate of over 41 @,@ 000 ft / min ( 210 m / s ) . The F @-@ 4 's nine external hardpoints have a capability of up to 18 @,@ 650 pounds ( 8 @,@ 480 kg ) of weapons , including air @-@ to @-@ air and air @-@ to @-@ surface missiles , and unguided , guided , and thermonuclear weapons . Like other interceptors of its day , the F @-@ 4 was designed without an internal cannon . 
 The baseline performance of a Mach 2 @-@ class fighter with long range and a bomber @-@ sized payload would be the template for the next generation of large and light / middle @-@ weight fighters optimized for daylight air combat . 
 = = = Flight characteristics = = = 
 In air combat , the Phantom 's greatest advantage was its thrust , which permitted a skilled pilot to engage and disengage from the fight at will . The massive aircraft , designed to fire radar @-@ guided missiles from beyond visual range , lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents and was subject to adverse yaw during hard maneuvering . Although thus subject to irrecoverable spins during aileron rolls , pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy to fly on the edge of its performance envelope . In 1972 , the F @-@ 4E model was upgraded with leading edge slats on the wing , greatly improving high angle of attack maneuverability at the expense of top speed . 
 The J79 engines produced noticeable amounts of black smoke ( at mid @-@ throttle / cruise settings ) , a severe disadvantage in that the enemy could spot the aircraft . This was solved on the F @-@ 4S fitted with the − 10A engine variant which used a smokeless combustor . 
 The F @-@ 4 's biggest weakness , as it was initially designed , was its lack of an internal cannon . For a brief period , doctrine held that turning combat would be impossible at supersonic speeds and little effort was made to teach pilots air combat maneuvering . In reality , engagements quickly became subsonic , as pilots would slow down in an effort to get behind their adversaries . Furthermore , the relatively new heat @-@ seeking and radar @-@ guided missiles at the time were frequently reported as unreliable and pilots had to use multiple shots ( also known as ripple @-@ firing ) , just to hit one enemy fighter . To compound the problem , rules of engagement in Vietnam precluded long @-@ range missile attacks in most instances , as visual identification was normally required . Many pilots found themselves on the tail of an enemy aircraft but too close to fire short @-@ range Falcons or Sidewinders . Although by 1965 USAF F @-@ 4Cs began carrying SUU @-@ 16 external <unk> containing a 20 mm ( .79 in ) M61A1 Vulcan Gatling cannon , USAF cockpits were not equipped with lead @-@ computing gunsights until the introduction of the SUU @-@ 23 , virtually assuring a miss in a maneuvering fight . Some Marine Corps aircraft carried two pods for strafing . In addition to the loss of performance due to drag , combat showed the externally mounted cannon to be inaccurate unless frequently <unk> , yet far more cost @-@ effective than missiles . The lack of a cannon was finally addressed by adding an internally mounted 20 mm ( .79 in ) M61A1 Vulcan on the F @-@ 4E .

 On 30 December 1960 , the VF @-@ 121 " Pacemakers " at NAS Miramar became the first Phantom operator with its F4H @-@ <unk> ( F @-@ 4As ) . The VF @-@ 74 " Be @-@ <unk> " at NAS Oceana became the first deployable Phantom squadron when it received its F4H @-@ 1s ( F @-@ 4Bs ) on 8 July 1961 . The squadron completed carrier qualifications in October 1961 and Phantom 's first full carrier deployment between August 1962 and March 1963 aboard Forrestal . The second deployable U.S. Atlantic Fleet squadron to receive F @-@ 4Bs was the VF @-@ 102 " Diamondbacks " , who promptly took their new aircraft on the shakedown cruise of Enterprise . The first deployable U.S. Pacific Fleet squadron to receive the F @-@ 4B was the VF @-@ 114 " <unk> " , which participated in the September 1962 cruise aboard USS Kitty Hawk . 
 By the time of the Tonkin Gulf incident , 13 of 31 deployable navy squadrons were armed with the type . F @-@ 4Bs from Constellation made the first Phantom combat sortie of the Vietnam War on 5 August 1964 , flying bomber escort in Operation Pierce Arrow . The first Phantom air @-@ to @-@ air victory of the war took place on 9 April 1965 when an F @-@ 4B from VF @-@ 96 " Fighting Falcons " piloted by Lieutenant ( junior grade ) Terence M. Murphy and his RIO , Ensign Ronald Fegan , shot down a Chinese MiG @-@ 17 " Fresco " . The Phantom was then shot down , probably by an AIM @-@ 7 Sparrow from one of its wingmen . There continues to be controversy over whether the Phantom was shot down by MiG guns or , as enemy reports later indicated , an AIM @-@ 7 Sparrow III from one of Murphy 's and Fegan 's wingmen . On 17 June 1965 , an F @-@ 4B from VF @-@ 21 " Freelancers " piloted by Commander Louis Page and Lieutenant John C. Smith shot down the first North Vietnamese MiG of the war . 
 On 10 May 1972 , Lieutenant Randy " Duke " Cunningham and Lieutenant ( junior grade ) William P. Driscoll flying an F @-@ 4J , call sign " Showtime 100 " , shot down three MiG @-@ 17s to become the first American flying aces of the war . Their fifth victory was believed at the time to be over a mysterious North Vietnamese ace , Colonel Nguyen Toon , now considered mythical . On the return flight , the Phantom was damaged by an enemy surface @-@ to @-@ air missile . To avoid being captured , Cunningham and Driscoll flew their burning aircraft using only the rudder and afterburner ( the damage to the aircraft rendered conventional control nearly impossible ) , until they could eject over water . 
 During the war , U.S. Navy F @-@ 4 Phantom squadrons participated in 84 combat tours with F @-@ 4Bs , F @-@ 4Js , and F @-@ <unk> . The navy claimed 40 air @-@ to @-@ air victories at a cost of 73 Phantoms lost in combat ( seven to enemy aircraft , 13 to SAMs , and 53 to AAA ) . An additional 54 Phantoms were lost in mishaps . 
 In 1984 , the F @-@ <unk> had been retired , and by 1987 the last F @-@ <unk> were retired in the US Navy deployable squadrons . On 25 March 1986 , an F @-@ 4S belonging to the VF @-@ 151 " Vigilantes , " became the last active duty U.S. Navy Phantom to launch from an aircraft carrier , in this case , Midway . On 18 October 1986 , an F @-@ 4S from the VF @-@ 202 " <unk> " , a Naval Reserve fighter squadron , made the last @-@ ever Phantom carrier landing while operating aboard America . In 1987 , the last of the Naval Reserve @-@ operated F @-@ 4S aircraft were replaced by F @-@ <unk> . The last Phantoms in service with the Navy were QF @-@ 4 target drones operated by the Naval Air Warfare Center at NAS Point Mugu , California . These airframes were subsequently retired in 2004 .

 The Marine Corps received its first F @-@ 4Bs in June 1962 , with the " Black Knights " of VMFA @-@ 314 at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro , California becoming the first operational squadron . Marine Phantoms from VMFA @-@ 531 ' Gray Ghosts ' were assigned to Da Nang airbase on South Vietnam 's northeast coast on 10 May 1965 and were initially assigned to provide air defense for the USMC . They soon began close air support missions ( CAS ) and VMFA @-@ 314 ' Black Knights ' , VMFA @-@ 323 ' Death Rattlers ' , and VMFA @-@ 542 ' Bengals ' soon arrived at the primitive airfield . Marine F @-@ 4 pilots claimed three enemy MiGs ( two while on exchange duty with the USAF ) at the cost of 75 aircraft lost in combat , mostly to ground fire , and four in accidents . VMCJ @-@ 1 Golden Hawks ( now VMAQ @-@ 1 and VMAQ @-@ 4 which has the old RM <unk> ) flew the first RF @-@ 4B photo recon mission on 3 November 1966 from Da Nang and remained there until 1970 with no RF @-@ 4B losses and one damaged by AAA .

The F @-@ 4 continued to equip fighter @-@ attack squadrons in both Marine Corps active and reserve units throughout the 1960s , 1970s and 1980s and into the early 1990s . In the early 1980s , these squadrons began to transition to the F / A @-@ 18 Hornet , starting with the same squadron that introduced the F @-@ 4 to the Marine Corps , VMFA @-@ 314 at MCAS El Toro , California . On 18 January 1992 , the last Marine Corps Phantom , an F @-@ 4S in the Marine Corps Reserve , was retired by the " Cowboys " of VMFA @-@ 112 , after which the squadron was re @-@ equipped with F / A @-@ 18 Hornets . 
 = = = United States Air Force = = = 
 In USAF service , the F @-@ 4 was initially designated the F @-@ 110 Spectre prior to the introduction of the 1962 United States Tri @-@ Service aircraft designation system . The USAF quickly embraced the design and became the largest Phantom user . The first USAF Phantoms in Vietnam were F @-@ 4Cs from the 555th Tactical Fighter Squadron " Triple Nickel " , which arrived in December 1964 . 
 Unlike the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps , which flew the Phantom with a Naval Aviator ( pilot ) in the front seat and a Naval Flight Officer as a radar intercept officer ( RIO ) in the back seat , the USAF initially flew its Phantoms with a rated Air Force Pilot in front and back seats . While the rear pilot ( <unk> , or " guy in back " ) could fly and ostensibly land the aircraft , he had fewer flight instruments and a very restricted forward view . The Air Force later assigned a rated Air Force Navigator qualified as a weapon / targeting systems officer ( later designated as weapon systems officer or WSO ) in the rear seat instead of another pilot . However , all USAF Phantoms retained dual flight controls throughout their service life . 
 On 10 July 1965 , F @-@ 4Cs of the 45th Tactical Fighter Squadron , 15th TFW , on temporary assignment in Ubon , Thailand , scored the USAF 's first victories against North Vietnamese MiG @-@ 17s using AIM @-@ 9 Sidewinder air @-@ to @-@ air missiles . On 26 April 1966 , an F @-@ 4C from the 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron scored the first aerial victory by a U.S. aircrew over a North Vietnamese MiG @-@ 21 " <unk> " . On 24 July 1965 , another Phantom from the 45th Tactical Fighter Squadron became the first American aircraft to be downed by an enemy SAM , and on 5 October 1966 an 8th Tactical Fighter Wing F @-@ 4C became the first U.S. jet lost to an air @-@ to @-@ air missile , fired by a MiG @-@ 21 . 
 Early aircraft suffered from leaks in wing fuel tanks that required re @-@ sealing after each flight and 85 aircraft were found to have cracks in outer wing ribs and stringers . There were also problems with aileron control cylinders , electrical connectors , and engine compartment fires . Reconnaissance RF @-@ 4Cs made their debut in Vietnam on 30 October 1965 , flying the hazardous post @-@ strike reconnaissance missions . The USAF Thunderbirds used the F @-@ 4E from the 1969 season until 1974 . 
 Although the F @-@ 4C was essentially identical to the Navy / Marine Corps F @-@ 4B in flight performance and carried the AIM @-@ 9 Sidewinder missiles , USAF @-@ tailored F @-@ 4Ds initially arrived in June 1967 equipped with AIM @-@ 4 Falcons . However , the Falcon , like its predecessors , was designed to shoot down heavy bombers flying straight and level . Its reliability proved no better than others and its complex firing sequence and limited seeker @-@ head cooling time made it virtually useless in combat against agile fighters . The F @-@ 4Ds reverted to using Sidewinders under the " Rivet Haste " program in early 1968 , and by 1972 the AIM @-@ <unk> @-@ 2 " Dogfight Sparrow " had become the preferred missile for USAF pilots . Like other Vietnam War Phantoms , the F @-@ 4Ds were urgently fitted with radar homing and warning ( <unk> ) antennas to detect the Soviet @-@ built S @-@ 75 Dvina SAMs . 
 From the initial deployment of the F @-@ 4C to Southeast Asia , USAF Phantoms performed both air superiority and ground attack roles , supporting not only ground troops in South Vietnam but also conducting bombing sorties in Laos and North Vietnam . As the F @-@ 105 force underwent severe attrition between 1965 and 1968 , the bombing role of the F @-@ 4 proportionately increased until after November 1970 ( when the last F @-@ 105D was withdrawn from combat ) it became the primary USAF tactical ordnance delivery system . In October 1972 the first squadron of EF @-@ 4C Wild Weasel aircraft deployed to Thailand on temporary duty . The " E " prefix was later dropped and the aircraft was simply known as the F @-@ 4C Wild Weasel . 
 Sixteen squadrons of Phantoms were permanently deployed between 1965 and 1973 , and 17 others deployed on temporary combat assignments . Peak numbers of combat F @-@ 4s occurred in 1972 , when 353 were based in Thailand . A total of 445 Air Force Phantom fighter @-@ bombers were lost , 370 in combat and 193 of those over North Vietnam ( 33 to MiGs , 30 to SAMs , and 307 to AAA ) . 
 The RF @-@ 4C was operated by four squadrons , and of the 83 losses , 72 were in combat including 38 over North Vietnam ( seven to SAMs and 65 to AAA ) . By war 's end , the U.S. Air Force had lost a total of 528 F @-@ 4 and RF @-@ 4C Phantoms . When combined with U.S. Navy and Marine Corps losses of 233 Phantoms , 761 F @-@ 4 / RF @-@ 4 Phantoms were lost in the Vietnam War . 
 On 28 August 1972 , Captain Steve Ritchie became the first USAF ace of the war . On 9 September 1972 , WSO Capt Charles B. <unk> became the highest @-@ scoring American ace of the war with six <unk> and WSO Capt Jeffrey Feinstein became the last USAF ace of the war on 13 October 1972 . Upon return to the United States , <unk> and Feinstein were assigned to undergraduate pilot training ( Feinstein was given a vision waiver ) and <unk> as USAF pilots in the F @-@ 4 . USAF F @-@ 4C / D / E crews scored 107 ½ MiG kills in Southeast Asia ( 50 by Sparrow , 31 by Sidewinder , five by Falcon , 15 @.@ 5 by gun , and six by other means ) . 
 On 31 January 1972 , the 170th Tactical Fighter Squadron / <unk> Tactical Fighter Group of the Illinois Air National Guard became the first Air National Guard unit to transition to Phantoms from Republic F @-@ 84F <unk> which were found to have corrosion problems . Phantoms would eventually equip numerous tactical fighter and tactical reconnaissance units in the USAF active , National Guard , and reserve . 
 On 2 June 1972 , a Phantom flying at supersonic speed shot down a MiG @-@ 19 over Thud Ridge in Vietnam for the first supersonic gun kill . At a recorded speed of Mach 1 @.@ 2 , Major Phil Handley 's shoot down was the first and only recorded gun kill while flying at supersonic speeds . 
 On 15 August 1990 , 24 F @-@ 4G Wild Weasel Vs and six RF @-@ 4Cs were deployed to Shaikh Isa AB , Bahrain , for Operation Desert Storm . The F @-@ 4G was the only aircraft in the USAF inventory equipped for the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses ( SEAD ) role , and was needed to protect coalition aircraft from Iraq 's extensive air defense system . The RF @-@ 4C was the only aircraft equipped with the ultra @-@ long @-@ range KS @-@ 127 <unk> ( long @-@ range oblique photography ) camera , and was used for a variety of reconnaissance missions . In spite of flying almost daily missions , only one RF @-@ 4C was lost in a fatal accident before the start of hostilities . One F @-@ 4G was lost when enemy fire damaged the fuel tanks and the aircraft ran out of fuel near a friendly airbase . The last USAF Phantoms , F @-@ 4G Wild Weasel Vs from <unk> Fighter Squadron , were retired on 26 March 1996 . The last operational flight of the F @-@ 4G Wild Weasel was from the 190th Fighter Squadron , Idaho Air National Guard , in April 1996 . The last operational USAF / ANG F @-@ 4 to land was flown by Maj Mike Webb and Maj Gary Leeder of the Idaho ANG . 
 Like the Navy , the Air Force has operated QF @-@ 4 target drones , serving with the 82d Aerial Targets Squadron at Tyndall Air Force Base , Florida , and Holloman Air Force Base , New Mexico . It was expected that the F @-@ 4 would remain in the target role with the 82d <unk> until at least 2015 , when they would be replaced by early versions of the F @-@ 16 Fighting Falcon converted to a QF @-@ 16 configuration . Several QF @-@ 4s also retain capability as manned aircraft and are maintained in historical color schemes , being displayed as part of Air Combat Command 's Heritage Flight at air shows , base open houses , and other events while serving as non @-@ expendable target aircraft during the week . On 19 November 2013 , BAE Systems delivered the last QF @-@ 4 aerial target to the Air Force . The example had been in storage for over 20 years before being converted . Over 16 years , BAE had converted 314 F @-@ 4 and RF @-@ 4 Phantom IIs into QF @-@ 4s and QRF @-@ 4s , with each aircraft taking six months to adapt . As of December 2013 , QF @-@ 4 and QRF @-@ 4 aircraft had flown over 16 @,@ 000 manned and 600 unmanned training sorties , with 250 unmanned aircraft being shot down in firing exercises . The remaining QF @-@ 4s and QRF @-@ 4s held their training role until the first of 126 QF @-@ 16s were delivered by Boeing . The final flight of an Air Force QF @-@ 4 from Tyndall AFB took place on 27 May 2015 to Holloman AFB . After Tyndall AFB ceased operations , the 53d Weapons Evaluation Group at Holloman became the fleet of 22 QF @-@ 4s ' last remaining operator . The base will continue using them to fly manned test and unmanned live fire test support and Foreign Military Sales testing until January 2017 , when the remaining airframes will be demilitarized .

 The German Air Force ( Luftwaffe ) initially ordered the reconnaissance RF @-@ 4E in 1969 , receiving a total of 88 aircraft from January 1971 . In 1982 , the initially unarmed RF @-@ 4Es were given a secondary ground attack capability ; these aircraft were later retired in 1994 . 
 In 1973 , under the " Peace Rhine " program , the Luftwaffe purchased the lightened and simplified F @-@ 4F which was upgraded in the mid @-@ 1980s . 24 German F @-@ 4F Phantom IIs were operated by the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing of the USAF at Holloman AFB to train Luftwaffe crews until December 2004 . In 1975 , Germany also received 10 F @-@ 4Es for training in the U.S. In the late 1990s , these were withdrawn from service after being replaced by F @-@ 4Fs . Germany also initiated the Improved Combat Efficiency ( ICE ) program in 1983 . The 110 ICE @-@ upgraded F @-@ 4Fs entered service in 1992 , and were expected to remain in service until 2012 . All the remaining Luftwaffe Phantoms were based at <unk> with Jagdgeschwader 71 ( fighter wing 71 ) in Northern Germany and <unk> at Manching . The German Air Force retired its last F @-@ 4Fs on 29 June 2013 . German F @-@ 4Fs flew 279 @,@ 000 hours from entering service on 31 August 1973 until retirement .

 In the 1960s and 1970s when the U.S. and Iran were on friendly terms , the U.S. sold 225 F @-@ 4D , F @-@ 4E , and RF @-@ 4E Phantoms to Iran . The Imperial Iranian Air Force saw at least one engagement , resulting in a loss , after an RF @-@ 4C was rammed by a Soviet MiG @-@ 21 during Project Dark Gene , an ELINT operation during the Cold War . 
 The Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force Phantoms saw heavy action in the Iran – Iraq War in the 1980s and are kept operational by overhaul and servicing from Iran 's aerospace industry . Notable operations of Iranian F @-@ 4s during the war included Operation Scorch Sword , an attack by two F @-@ 4s against the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor site near Baghdad on 30 September 1980 , and the attack on H3 , a 4 April 1981 strike by eight Iranian F @-@ 4s against the H @-@ 3 complex of air bases in the far west of Iraq , which resulted in many Iraqi aircraft being destroyed or damaged for no Iranian losses . Iranian F @-@ 4s were in use as of late 2014 ; the aircraft reportedly conducted air strikes on ISIS targets in the eastern Iraqi province of <unk> .

 The Israeli Air Force was the largest foreign operator of the Phantom , flying both newly built and ex @-@ USAF aircraft , as well as several one @-@ off special reconnaissance variants . The first F @-@ 4Es , nicknamed " Kurnass " ( Sledgehammer ) , and RF @-@ 4Es , nicknamed " <unk> " ( Raven ) , were delivered in 1969 under the " Peace Echo I " program . Additional Phantoms arrived during the 1970s under " Peace Echo II " through " Peace Echo V " and " Nickel Grass " programs . Israeli Phantoms saw extensive combat during Arab – Israeli conflicts , first seeing action during the War of Attrition . In the 1980s , Israel began the " Kurnass 2000 " modernization program which significantly updated avionics . The last Israeli F @-@ 4s were retired in 2004 .

 The Turkish Air Force ( TAF ) received 40 F @-@ 4Es in 1974 , with a further 32 F @-@ 4Es and 8 RF @-@ 4Es in 1977 – 78 under the " Peace Diamond III " program , followed by 40 ex @-@ USAF aircraft in " Peace Diamond IV " in 1987 , and a further 40 ex @-@ U.S. Air National Guard Aircraft in 1991 . A further 32 RF @-@ 4Es were transferred to Turkey after being retired by the Luftwaffe between 1992 and 1994 . In 1995 , Israel Aerospace Industries ( IAI ) implemented an upgrade similar to Kurnass 2000 on 54 Turkish F @-@ 4Es which were dubbed the F @-@ 4E 2020 Terminator . Turkish F @-@ 4s , and more modern F @-@ 16s have been used to strike Kurdish PKK bases in ongoing military operations in Northern Iraq . On 22 June 2012 , a Turkish RF @-@ 4E was shot down by Syrian air defenses while flying a reconnaissance flight near the Turkish @-@ Syrian border . Turkey has stated the reconnaissance aircraft was in international airspace when it was shot down , while Syrian authorities stated it was inside Syrian airspace . Turkish F @-@ 4s remained in use as of 2015 . 
 On 24 February 2015 , two RF @-@ 4Es crashed in the Malatya region in the southeast of Turkey , under yet unknown circumstances , killing both crew of two each . On 5 March 2015 , an F @-@ 4E @-@ 2020 crashed in central Anatolia killing both crew . After the recent accidents , the TAF withdrew RF @-@ 4Es from active service . Turkey was reported to have used F @-@ 4 jets to attack PKK separatists and the ISIS capital on 19 September 2015 . The Turkish Air Force has reportedly used the F @-@ 4E 2020s against the more recent Third Phase of the PKK conflict on heavy bombardment missions into Iraq on 15 November 2015 , 12 January 2016 , and 12 March 2016 . 
 = = = = United Kingdom = = = = 
 The United Kingdom bought versions based on the U.S. Navy 's F @-@ 4J for use with the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy 's Fleet Air Arm . The main differences were the use of the British Rolls @-@ Royce Spey engines and of British @-@ made avionics . The RN and RAF versions were given the designation F @-@ 4K and F @-@ 4M respectively , and entered service with the British military aircraft designations Phantom FG.1 ( fighter / ground attack ) and Phantom FGR.2 ( fighter / ground attack / reconnaissance ) . Initially , the FGR.2 was used in the ground attack and reconnaissance role , primarily with RAF Germany , while 43 Squadron was formed in the air defence role using the FG.1s that had been intended for the Fleet Air Arm for use aboard HMS Eagle . The superiority of the Phantom over the English Electric Lightning in terms of both range and weapon load , combined with the successful introduction of the SEPECAT Jaguar , meant that , during the mid @-@ 1970s , most of the ground attack Phantoms in Germany were redeployed to the UK to replace air defence Lightning squadrons . A second RAF squadron , 111 Squadron , was formed on the FG.1 in 1979 after the disbandment of 892 NAS . 
 In 1982 , during the Falklands War , three Phantom <unk> of No. 29 Squadron were on active Quick Reaction Alert duty on Ascension Island to protect the base from air attack . After the Falklands War , 15 upgraded ex @-@ USN F @-@ 4Js , known as the F @-@ 4J ( UK ) entered RAF service to compensate for one interceptor squadron redeployed to the Falklands . 
 Around 15 RAF squadrons received various marks of Phantom , many of them based in Germany . The first to be equipped was No. 6 Squadron at RAF Leuchars in July 1969 . One noteworthy deployment was to No. 43 Squadron where Phantom <unk> remained the squadron equipment for 20 years , arriving in September 1969 and departing in July 1989 . During this period the squadron was based at Leuchars . 
 The interceptor Phantoms were replaced by the Panavia Tornado F3 from the late 1980s onwards , and the last British Phantoms were retired in October 1992 when No. 74 Squadron was disbanded .

 The Phantom gathered a number of nicknames during its career . Some of these names included " Snoopy " , " Rhino " , " Double Ugly " , " Old Smokey " , the " Flying Anvil " , " Flying <unk> " , " Flying Brick " , " Lead Sled " , the " Big Iron Sled " and the " St. Louis Slugger " . In recognition of its record of downing large numbers of Soviet @-@ built MiGs , it was called the " World 's Leading Distributor of MiG Parts " . As a reflection of excellent performance in spite of its bulk , the F @-@ 4 was dubbed " the triumph of thrust over aerodynamics . " German Luftwaffe crews called their F @-@ 4s the <unk> ( " Iron Pig " ) , <unk> <unk> ( " Flying Brick " ) and <unk> ( " Air Defense Diesel " ) . 
 Imitating the spelling of the aircraft 's name , McDonnell issued a series of patches . Pilots became " Phantom <unk> " , <unk> became " Phantom <unk> " , fans of the F @-@ 4 " Phantom <unk> " , and call it the " <unk> Phantom " . Ground crewmen who worked on the aircraft are known as " Phantom <unk> " .

 The aircraft 's emblem is a whimsical cartoon ghost called " The Spook " , which was created by McDonnell Douglas technical artist , Anthony " Tony " Wong , for shoulder patches . The name " Spook " was coined by the crews of either the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing or the 4453rd Combat Crew Training Wing at MacDill AFB . The figure is ubiquitous , appearing on many items associated with the F @-@ 4 . The Spook has followed the Phantom around the world adopting local fashions ; for example , the British adaptation of the U.S. " Phantom Man " is a Spook that sometimes wears a bowler hat and smokes a pipe .

 SpongeBob wakes up on a normal day as usual and attempts to hang out with Patrick , Squidward and Sandy , however he ends up angering them each , causing them to call him " Idiot Boy " . SpongeBob heads to the Krusty Krab but ends up creating a mishap that results in getting two dollars fried and reduced to bits , with a furious Mr. Krabs kicking him out of the restaurant and like the others did , Mr. Krabs calls SpongeBob " Idiot Boy " . SpongeBob decides to leave Bikini Bottom and tells Gary that he has a year 's supply of snail food to eat since SpongeBob will not be there to feed him . After leaving Bikini Bottom , he is frightened by bizarre people and as he runs in fear , SpongeBob falls off a cliff and bumps his head , knocking himself unconscious . Back in Bikini Bottom , Patrick and Sandy enter SpongeBob 's house and Sandy finds that Gary 's food bowl has a note from SpongeBob , saying he has left so that he will not bother anyone ever again . After Sandy reads it , she and Patrick show remorse . 
 Meanwhile , SpongeBob wakes up with amnesia . He sees two fishes who have found his clothes and express interest in using them ; SpongeBob mentions that he cannot remember anything except hitting his head , so the fish tell him that his name is " <unk> <unk> " . However , they run away when they find out SpongeBob has a bottle of bubble soap . He wonders what the problem was and spots New Kelp City . Sandy and Patrick arrive at the Krusty Krab where customers have gathered , angered about not getting their orders , Sandy then shows the note from SpongeBob to Mr. Krabs . After he reads it , they all become upset about making him leave ( except for Squidward who is happy about SpongeBob being gone ) . Mr. Krabs has the customers leave the restaurant , so that he and the other can decide on how to find SpongeBob . 
 SpongeBob wanders around New Kelp City and upon getting accused of pickpocketing by a civilian and noticing his hunger , decides he needs to get a job . Each time he gets a job however , he uses bubble blowing , resulting in him getting fired . Back in Bikini Bottom , after Squidward ( who is <unk> to not see SpongeBob again ) destroys a device that Sandy made to find SpongeBob , Mr. Krabs orders him to look for SpongeBob . Squidward refuses at first but changes his mind when Mr. Krabs prompts him with his retirement gift : a Fabergé egg . 
 SpongeBob 's activity with blowing bubbles , brings up a confrontation with " the Bubble Poppin ' Boys " , a greaser @-@ like gang who have scared the city into never blowing bubbles because they keep being blinded by the bubbles whenever they pop . After they attack , SpongeBob uses his bubble blowing to trap the gang in a giant bubble that flies them out of town . He is rewarded by getting the position of mayor of New Kelp City while the previous mayor resigns . 
 Sandy , Patrick , and Squidward arrive at a gas station and from reading a newspaper article , discover SpongeBob 's appointment as mayor of New Kelp City . But when they go to New Kelp City to retrieve him , SpongeBob cannot remember who they are . Squidward hi @-@ jinks SpongeBob 's limousine and gets away from the city with SpongeBob , Patrick and Sandy in tow and they return to the Krusty Krab . SpongeBob still does not recall the eatery and wants to return to New Kelp City to resume his job as mayor . Delighted that SpongeBob is leaving again , Squidward requests for his jewel encrusted egg but slips and accidentally throws the egg onto SpongeBob 's head , which causes his memory to come back . But even so , SpongeBob still wants to return to New Kelp City . He changes his mind after a breaking news report comes on , saying that the bubbles in New Kelp City are blinding the citizens , and a thug threatens to do something to SpongeBob if he ever comes back . SpongeBob starts cooking Krabby Patties again , much to his friends ' delight . With a sigh of happiness , SpongeBob says that it looks like he will be back in Bikini Bottom .

 " What Ever Happened to SpongeBob ? " , also known as " WhoBob WhatPants ? " , was a special episode written by Casey Alexander , Zeus Cervas , and Steven Banks . It was directed by Alan Smart . Alexander and Cervas also functioned as storyboard directors . The episode was first announced by Nickelodeon on September 24 , 2008 on a press release . According to the network , SpongeBob " wanders the ocean , a stranger in his own pants , " and finds himself in a rough part of New Kelp City , where he faces off against the Boys ' <unk> , Liotta 's character . 
 The episode originally aired in the United States on October 13 , 2008 . From October 3 , 2008 , TurboNick featured a special playlist of content dedicated to the episode , including a sneak @-@ peek of the special , themed episodes , short @-@ form content , song clips , and an instant replay of the special following the television premiere . Nick.com , in 2008 , presented a new game called " SpongeBob SquarePants : WhoBob WhatPants ? " to celebrate the episode 's television airing . The episode also features SpongeBob 's signature sea <unk> altered to " WhoBob WhatPants ? " during the chorus answers in the title sequence . 
 In addition to the regular cast , American Emmy Award Winning actor Ray Liotta guest starred in the episode as the voice of Trevor , the leader of New Kelp City 's Bubble Poppin ' Boys gang , and the main villain in the episode . 
 On October 14 , 2008 , " What Ever Happened to SpongeBob ?

 = Iron ( III ) chloride = 
 Iron ( III ) chloride , also called ferric chloride , is an industrial scale commodity chemical compound , with the formula FeCl3 and with iron in the + 3 oxidation state . The colour of iron ( III ) chloride crystals depends on the viewing angle : by reflected light the crystals appear dark green , but by transmitted light they appear purple @-@ red . Anhydrous iron ( III ) chloride is deliquescent , forming hydrated hydrogen chloride mists in moist air . It is rarely observed in its natural form , mineral <unk> , known mainly from some fumaroles . 
 When dissolved in water , iron ( III ) chloride undergoes hydrolysis and gives off heat in an exothermic reaction . The resulting brown , acidic , and corrosive solution is used as a flocculant in sewage treatment and drinking water production , and as an <unk> for copper @-@ based metals in printed circuit boards . Anhydrous iron ( III ) chloride is a fairly strong Lewis acid , and it is used as a catalyst in organic synthesis . 
 = = Nomenclature = = 
 The descriptor hydrated or anhydrous is used when referring to iron ( III ) chloride , to distinguish between the two common forms . The hexahydrate is usually given as the simplified empirical formula FeCl3 ⋅ 6H2O . It may also be given as <unk> [ Fe ( H2O ) <unk> ] Cl ⋅ 2H2O and the systematic name <unk> ( III ) chloride dihydrate , which more clearly represents its structure . 
 = = Structure and properties = = 
 Anhydrous iron ( III ) chloride adopts the <unk> structure , which features octahedral Fe ( III ) centres interconnected by two @-@ coordinate chloride ligands . Iron ( III ) chloride hexahydrate consists of <unk> [ Fe ( H2O ) <unk> ] + cationic complexes and chloride anions , with the remaining two H2O molecules embedded within the monoclinic crystal structure . 
 Iron ( III ) chloride has a relatively low melting point and boils at around 315 ° C. The vapour consists of the dimer <unk> ( c.f. aluminium chloride ) which increasingly dissociates into the monomeric FeCl3 ( <unk> point group molecular symmetry ) at higher temperature , in competition with its reversible decomposition to give iron ( II ) chloride and chlorine gas . 
 = = Preparation = = 
 Anhydrous iron ( III ) chloride may be prepared by union of the elements : 
 2 Fe ( s ) + 3 Cl2 ( g ) → 2 FeCl3 ( s ) 
 Solutions of iron ( III ) chloride are produced industrially both from iron and from ore , in a closed @-@ loop process . 
 Dissolving iron ore in hydrochloric acid 
 Fe3O4 ( s ) + 8 HCl ( aq ) → FeCl2 ( aq ) + 2 FeCl3 ( aq ) + 4 H2O 
 Oxidation of iron ( II ) chloride with chlorine 
 2 FeCl2 ( aq ) + Cl2 ( g ) → 2 FeCl3 ( aq ) 
 Oxidation of iron ( II ) chloride with oxygen 
 <unk> ( aq ) + O2 + <unk> → <unk> ( aq ) + 2H2O 
 Reacting Iron with hydrochloric acid , then with hydrogen peroxide . The hydrogen peroxide is the oxidant in turning ferrous chloride into ferric chloride 
 Like many other hydrated metal chlorides , hydrated iron ( III ) chloride can be converted to the anhydrous salt by <unk> with thionyl chloride . Conversion of the hydrate to anhydrous iron ( III ) chloride is not accomplished by heating , as HCl and iron <unk> are produced . 
 = = Reactions = = 
 Iron ( III ) chloride undergoes hydrolysis to give an acidic solution . When heated with iron ( III ) oxide at 350 ° C , iron ( III ) chloride gives iron oxychloride , a layered solid and intercalation host . 
 FeCl3 + Fe2O3 → 3 <unk> 
 It is a moderately strong Lewis acid , forming adducts with Lewis bases such as triphenylphosphine oxide , e.g. FeCl3 ( <unk> ) 2 where Ph = phenyl . It also reacts with other chloride salts to give the yellow tetrahedral <unk> − ion . Salts of <unk> − in hydrochloric acid can be extracted into diethyl ether . 
 Alkali metal alkoxides react to give the metal <unk> complexes of varying complexity . The compounds can be dimeric or trimeric . In the solid phase a variety of <unk> complexes have been described for the nominal stoichiometric reaction between FeCl3 and sodium <unk> : 
 FeCl3 + 3 [ <unk> ] − Na + → Fe ( <unk> ) 3 + 3 NaCl 
 <unk> react rapidly with aqueous iron ( III ) chloride to give [ Fe ( C2O4 ) 3 ] 3 − . Other carboxylate salts form complexes , e.g. citrate and tartrate . 
 = = = Oxidation = = = 
 Iron ( III ) chloride is a mild oxidising agent , for example , it is capable of oxidising copper ( I ) chloride to copper ( II ) chloride . 
 FeCl3 + CuCl → FeCl2 + CuCl2 
 It also reacts with iron to form iron ( II ) chloride : 
 2 FeCl3 + Fe → 3 FeCl2 
 Reducing agents such as hydrazine convert iron ( III ) chloride to complexes of iron ( II ) . 
 = = Uses = = 
 = = = Industrial = = = 
 In industrial application , iron ( III ) chloride is used in sewage treatment and drinking water production . In this application , FeCl3 in slightly basic water reacts with the hydroxide ion to form a <unk> of iron ( III ) hydroxide , or more precisely formulated as FeO ( OH ) − , that can remove suspended materials . 
 [ Fe ( H2O ) 6 ] 3 + + 4 HO − → [ Fe ( H2O ) 2 ( HO ) 4 ] − + 4 H2O → [ Fe ( H2O ) O ( HO ) 2 ] − + 6 H2O 
 It is also used as a leaching agent in chloride hydrometallurgy , for example in the production of Si from <unk> . ( <unk> process ) 
 Another important application of iron ( III ) chloride is etching copper in two @-@ step redox reaction to copper ( I ) chloride and then to copper ( II ) chloride in the production of printed circuit boards . 
 FeCl3 + Cu → FeCl2 + CuCl 
 FeCl3 + CuCl → FeCl2 + CuCl2 
 Iron ( III ) chloride is used as catalyst for the reaction of ethylene with chlorine , forming ethylene dichloride ( 1 @,@ 2 @-@ dichloroethane ) , an important commodity chemical , which is mainly used for the industrial production of vinyl chloride , the monomer for making PVC . 
 <unk> = CH2 + Cl2 → <unk> 
 = = = Laboratory use = = = 
 In the laboratory iron ( III ) chloride is commonly employed as a Lewis acid for catalysing reactions such as chlorination of aromatic compounds and Friedel @-@ Crafts reaction of aromatics . It is less powerful than aluminium chloride , but in some cases this mildness leads to higher yields , for example in the alkylation of benzene : 
 The ferric chloride test is a traditional colorimetric test for phenols , which uses a 1 % iron ( III ) chloride solution that has been neutralised with sodium hydroxide until a slight precipitate of FeO ( OH ) is formed . The mixture is filtered before use . The organic substance is dissolved in water , methanol or ethanol , then the neutralised iron ( III ) chloride solution is added — a transient or permanent coloration ( usually purple , green or blue ) indicates the presence of a phenol or enol . 
 This reaction is exploited in the Trinder spot test , which is used to indicate the presence of salicylates , particularly salicylic acid , which contains a phenolic OH group . 
 This test can be used to detect the presence of gamma @-@ <unk> acid and gamma @-@ <unk> , which cause it to turn red @-@ brown .

 Historically it was used to make direct positive blueprints ; U.S. patent 241 @,@ 713 , May 17 1881 
 = = Safety = = 
 Iron ( III ) chloride is toxic , highly corrosive and acidic . The anhydrous material is a powerful dehydrating agent . 
 Although reports of poisoning in humans are rare , ingestion of ferric chloride can result in serious morbidity and mortality . Inappropriate labeling and storage lead to accidental swallowing or misdiagnosis . Early diagnosis is important , especially in seriously poisoned patients . 
 = Edward Drinker Cope = 
 Edward Drinker Cope ( July 28 , 1840 – April 12 , 1897 ) was an American paleontologist and comparative anatomist , as well as a noted herpetologist and ichthyologist . He was a founder of the Neo @-@ Lamarckism school of thought . Born to a wealthy Quaker family , Cope distinguished himself as a child prodigy interested in science ; he published his first scientific paper at the age of 19 . Though his father tried to raise Cope as a gentleman farmer , he eventually acquiesced to his son 's scientific aspirations . Cope married his cousin and had one child ; the family moved from Philadelphia to Haddonfield , New Jersey , although Cope would maintain a residence and museum in Philadelphia in his later years . 
 Cope had little formal scientific training , and he eschewed a teaching position for field work . He made regular trips to the American West , prospecting in the 1870s and 1880s , often as a member of United States Geological Survey teams . A personal feud between Cope and paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh led to a period of intense fossil @-@ finding competition now known as the Bone Wars . Cope 's financial fortunes soured after failed mining ventures in the 1880s , forcing him to sell off much of his fossil collection . He experienced a resurgence in his career toward the end of his life before dying on April 12 , 1897 . 
 Though Cope 's scientific pursuits nearly bankrupted him , his contributions helped to define the field of American paleontology . He was a prodigious writer , with 1 @,@ 400 papers published over his lifetime , although his rivals debated the accuracy of his rapidly published works . He discovered , described , and named more than 1 @,@ 000 vertebrate species , including hundreds of fishes and dozens of dinosaurs . His proposal for the origin of mammalian molars is notable among his theoretical contributions . " Cope 's rule " , however , the hypothesis that mammalian lineages gradually grow larger over geologic time , while named after him , is " neither explicit nor implicit " in his work . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Edward Drinker Cope was born on July 28 , 1840 , the eldest son of Alfred and Hanna Cope . The death of his mother when he was three years old seemed to have had little effect on young Edward , as he mentioned in his letters that he had no recollection of her . His stepmother , Rebecca Biddle , filled the maternal role ; Cope referred to her warmly , as well as his younger stepbrother , James Biddle Cope . Alfred , an orthodox member of the Religious Society of Friends or Quakers , operated a lucrative shipping business started by his father , Thomas P. Cope , in 1821 . He was a philanthropist who gave money to the Society of Friends , the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens , and the Institute for Colored Youth . 
 Edward was born and raised in a large stone house called " Fairfield " , whose location is now within the boundaries of Philadelphia . The 8 acres ( 3 @.@ 2 ha ) of pristine and exotic gardens of the house offered a landscape that Edward was able to explore . The Copes began teaching their children to read and write at a very young age , and took Edward on trips across New England and to museums , zoos , and gardens . Cope 's interest in animals became apparent at a young age , as did his natural artistic ability . 
 Alfred intended to give his son the same education he himself had received . At age nine , Edward was sent to a day school in Philadelphia and in 1853 at the age of 12 , Edward was sent to the Friends ' Boarding School at Westtown , near West Chester , Pennsylvania . The school was founded in 1799 with fundraising by members of the Society of Friends ( Quakers ) , and provided much of the Cope family 's education . The prestigious school was expensive , costing Alfred $ 500 in tuition each year , and in his first year , Edward studied algebra , chemistry , scripture , physiology , grammar , astronomy , and Latin . Edward 's letters home requesting a larger allowance show he was able to manipulate his father , and he was , according to author and Cope biographer Jane Davidson , " a bit of a spoiled brat " . His letters suggest he was lonely at the school — it was the first time he had been away from his home for an extended period . Otherwise , Edward 's studies progressed much like a typical boy — he consistently had " less than perfect " or " not quite satisfactory " marks for conduct from his teachers , and did not work hard on his penmanship lessons , which may have contributed to his often illegible handwriting as an adult . 
 Edward returned to Westtown in 1855 , accompanied by two of his sisters . Biology began to interest him more that year , and he studied natural history texts in his spare time . While at the school , he frequently visited the Academy of Natural Sciences . Edward often obtained bad marks due to quarreling and bad conduct . His letters to his father show he chafed at farm work and betrayed flashes of the temper for which he would later become well known . After sending Edward back to the farm for summer break in 1854 and 1855 , Alfred did not return Edward to school after spring 1856 . Instead , Alfred attempted to turn his son into a gentleman farmer , which he considered a wholesome profession that would yield enough profit to lead a comfortable life , and improve the undersized Edward 's health . Until 1863 , Cope 's letters to his father continually expressed his yearning for a more professional scientific career than that of a farmer , which he called " dreadfully boring " . 
 While working on farms , Edward continued his education on his own . In 1858 , he began working part @-@ time at the Academy of Natural Sciences , reclassifying and cataloguing specimens , and published his first series of research results in January 1859 . Cope began taking French and German classes with a former Westtown teacher . Though Alfred resisted his son 's pursuit of a science career , he paid for his son 's private studies . Instead of working the farm his father bought for him , Edward rented out the land and used the income to further his scientific endeavors . 
 Alfred finally gave in to Edward 's wishes and paid for university classes . Cope attended the University of Pennsylvania in the 1861 and / or 1862 academic years , studying comparative anatomy under Joseph Leidy , one of the most influential anatomists and paleontologists at the time . Cope asked his father to pay for a tutor in both German and French , " not so much for their own sake , " wrote Edward , " but as for their value in enabling me to read their books of a literary or scientific character . " During this period , he had a job <unk> the herpetological collection at the Academy of Natural Sciences , where he became a member at Leidy 's urging . Cope 's job lasted two years and he visited the Smithsonian Institution on occasion , where he became acquainted with Spencer Baird , who was an expert in the fields of ornithology and ichthyology . In 1861 , he published his first paper on Salamandridae classification ; over the next five years he published primarily on reptiles and amphibians . Cope 's membership in the Academy of Natural Sciences and American Philosophical Society gave him outlets to publish and announce his work ; many of his early paleontological works were published by the Philosophical Society . 
 = = = European travels = = = 
 In 1863 – 1864 during the American Civil War , Edward traveled through Europe , taking the opportunity to visit the most esteemed museums and societies of the time . Initially , he seemed interested in helping out at a field hospital , but in letters to his father later on in the war , this aspiration seemed to disappear ; instead Edward considered working in the American South to assist freed African Americans . Davidson suggests Edward 's correspondence with Leidy and Ferdinand Hayden , who worked as field surgeons during the war , might have informed Edward of the horrors of the occupation . Edward was involved in a love affair ; his father did not approve . Whether Edward or the unnamed woman ( whom he at one point intended to marry ) broke off the relationship is unknown , but he took the breakup poorly . Biographer and paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn attributed Edward 's sudden departure for Europe as a method of keeping him from being drafted into the Civil War . Cope did write to his father from London on February 11 , 1864 , " I shall get home in time to catch and be caught by the new draft . I shall not be sorry for this , as I know certain persons who would be mean enough to say that I have gone to Europe to avoid the war . " Eventually , Cope took the pragmatic approach and waited out the conflict . He may have suffered from mild depression during this period , and often complained of boredom . 
 Despite his torpor , Edward proceeded with his tour of Europe , and met with some of the most highly esteemed scientists of the world during his travels through France , Germany , Great Britain , Ireland , Austria , Italy , and Eastern Europe , most likely with introductory letters from Leidy and Spencer Baird . In the winter of 1863 , Edward met Othniel Charles Marsh while in Berlin . Marsh , age 32 , was attending the University of Berlin . He held two university degrees in comparison to Edward 's lack of formal schooling past 16 , but Edward had written 37 scientific papers in comparison to Marsh 's two published works . While they would later become rivals , on meeting , the two men appeared to take a liking to each other . Marsh led Edward on a tour of the city , and they stayed together for days . After Edward left Berlin , the two maintained correspondence , exchanging manuscripts , fossils , and photographs . Edward burned many of his journals and letters from Europe upon his return to the United States . Friends intervened and stopped Cope from destroying some of his drawings and notes , in what author <unk> Lanham deemed a " partial suicide " . 
 = = = Family and early career = = = 
 Upon returning to Philadelphia in 1864 , the Cope family made every effort to secure Edward a teaching post as the Professor of Zoology at Haverford College , a small Quaker school where the family had philanthropic ties . The college awarded him an honorary master 's degree so he could have the position . Cope even began to think about marriage and consulted his father in the matter , telling him of the girl he would like to marry : " an amiable woman , not over sensitive , with considerable energy , and especially one inclined to be serious and not inclined to frivolity and display — the more truly Christian of course the better — seems to be the most practically the most suitable for me , though intellect and accomplishments have more charm . " Cope thought of Annie Pim , a member of the Society of Friends , as less a lover than companion , declaring , " her amiability and domestic qualities generally , her capability of taking care of a house , etc . , as well as her steady seriousness weigh far more with me than any of the traits which form the theme of poets ! " Cope 's family approved of his choice , and the marriage took place in July 1865 at Pim 's farmhouse in Chester County , Pennsylvania . The two had a single daughter , Julia Biddle Cope , born June 10 , 1866 . Cope 's return to the United States also marked an expansion of his scientific studies ; in 1864 , he described several fishes , a whale , and the amphibian <unk> <unk> ( his first paleontological contribution . ) 
 During the period between 1866 and 1867 , Cope went on trips to western parts of the country . He related to his father his scientific experiences ; to his daughter he sent descriptions of animal life as part of her education . Cope found educating his students at Haverford " a pleasure " , but wrote to his father that he " could not get any work done . " He resigned from his position at Haverford and moved his family to Haddonfield , in part to be closer to the fossil beds of western New Jersey . Due to the time @-@ consuming nature of his Haverford position , Cope had not had time to attend to his farm and had let it out to others , but eventually found he was in need of more money to fuel his scientific habits . Pleading with his father for money to pursue his career , he finally sold the farm in 1869 . Alfred apparently did not press his son to continue farming , and Edward focused on his scientific career . He continued his continental travels , including trips to Virginia , Tennessee , and North Carolina . He visited caves across the region . He stopped these cave explorations after an 1871 trip to the Wyandotte Caves in Indiana , but remained interested in the subject . Cope had visited Haddonfield many times in the 1860s , paying periodic visits to the marl pits . The fossils he found in these pits became the focus of several papers , including a description in 1868 of Elasmosaurus <unk> and Laelaps . Marsh accompanied him on one of these excursions . Cope 's proximity to the beds after moving to Haddonfield made more frequent trips possible . The Copes lived comfortably in a frame house backed by an apple orchard . Two maids tended the estate , which entertained a number of guests . Cope 's only concern was for more money to spend on his scientific work . 
 The 1870s were the golden years of Cope 's career , marked by his most prominent discoveries and rapid flow of publications . Among his descriptions were the therapsid Lystrosaurus ( 1870 ) , the <unk> Champsosaurus ( 1876 ) , and the sauropod Amphicoelias ( 1878 ) , possibly the largest dinosaur ever discovered . In the period of one year , from 1879 to 1880 , Cope published 76 papers based on his travels through New Mexico and Colorado , and on the findings of his collectors in Texas , Kansas , Oregon , Colorado , Wyoming , and Utah . During the peak years , Cope published around 25 reports and preliminary observations each year . The hurried publications led to errors in interpretation and naming — many of his scientific names were later canceled or withdrawn . In comparison , Marsh wrote and published less frequently and more succinctly — his works appearance in the widespread American Journal of Science led to faster reception abroad , and subsequently Marsh 's reputation grew more rapidly than Cope 's . 
 In autumn 1871 , Cope began prospecting farther west to the fossil fields of Kansas . Leidy and Marsh had been to the region earlier , and Cope employed one of Marsh 's guides , Benjamin Mudge , who was in want of a job . Cope 's companion Charles Sternberg described the lack of water and good food available to Cope and his helpers on these expeditions . Cope would suffer from a " severe attack of nightmare " in which " every animal of which we had found trace during the day played with him at night ... sometimes he would lose half the night in this exhausting slumber . " Nevertheless , Cope continued to lead the party from sunrise to sunset , sending letters to his wife and child describing his finds . The severe desert conditions and Cope 's habit of overworking himself till he was bedridden caught up with him , and in 1872 , he broke down from exhaustion . Cope maintained a regular pattern of summers spent prospecting and winters writing up his findings from 1871 to 1879 . 
 Throughout the decade , Cope traveled across the West , exploring rocks of the Eocene in 1872 and the <unk> Beds of Colorado in 1873 . In 1874 , Cope was employed with the Wheeler survey , a group of surveys led by George Montague Wheeler that mapped parts of the United States west of the 100th meridian . The survey traveled through New Mexico , whose Puerco formations , he wrote to his father , provided " the most important find in geology I have ever made " . The New Mexico bluffs contained millions of years of formation and subsequent deformation , and were in an area which had not been visited by Leidy or Marsh . Being part of the survey had other advantages ; Cope was able to draw on fort <unk> and defray publishing costs . While there was no salary , his findings would be published in the annual reports the surveys printed . Cope brought Annie and Julia along on one such survey , and rented a house for them at Fort Bridger , but he spent more of his own money on these survey trips than he would have liked . 
 Alfred died December 4 , 1875 , and left Edward with an inheritance of nearly a quarter of a million dollars . Alfred 's death was a blow to Cope ; his father was a constant confidant . The same year marked a suspension of much of Cope 's field work and a new emphasis on writing up discoveries of the previous years . His chief publication of the time , The Vertebrata of the Cretaceous Formations of the West , was a collection of 303 pages and 54 illustration plates . The memoir summarized his experiences prospecting in New Jersey and Kansas . Cope now had the finances to hire multiple teams to search for fossils for him year @-@ round and he advised the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition on their fossil displays . Cope 's studies of marine reptiles of Kansas closed in 1876 , opening a new focus on terrestrial reptiles . The same year , Cope moved from Haddonfield to 2100 and <unk> Pine Street in Philadelphia . He converted one of the two houses into a museum where he stored his growing collection of fossils . Cope 's expeditions took him across Kansas , Colorado , New Mexico , Wyoming , and Montana . His initial journey into the Clarendon beds of Upper Miocene and Lower Pliocene of Texas led to an affiliation with the Geological Survey of Texas . Cope 's papers on the region constitute some of his most important paleontological contributions . In 1877 , he purchased half the rights to the American Naturalist to publish the papers he produced at a rate so high , Marsh questioned their dating . 
 Cope returned to Europe in August 1878 in response to an invitation to join the British Association for the Advancement of Science 's Dublin meeting . He was warmly welcomed in England and France , and met with the distinguished paleontologists and archeologists of the period . Marsh 's attempts to sully Cope 's reputation had made little impact on anyone save paleontologist Thomas Henry Huxley , who according to Osborn , " alone treated [ Cope ] with coolness " . Following the Dublin meeting , Cope spent two days with the French Association for the Advancement of Science . At each gathering , Cope exhibited dinosaur restorations by Philadelphia colleague John A. Ryder and various charts and plates from geological surveys of the 1870s led by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden . He returned to London on October 12 , meeting with anatomist Richard Owen , ichthyologist Albert Günther , and paleontologist H. G. Seeley . While in Europe , Cope purchased a great collection of fossils from Argentina . Cope never found time to describe the collection and many of the boxes remained unopened until his death .

 Cope 's relations with Marsh turned into a competition for fossils between the two , known today as the Bone Wars . The conflict 's seeds began upon the men 's return to the United States in the 1860s . Cope introduced his colleague to the marl pit owner Albert Vorhees when the two visited the site . Marsh went behind Cope 's back and made a private agreement with Vorhees : any fossils that Vorhees 's men found were sent back to Marsh at New Haven . When Marsh was at Haddonfield examining one of Cope 's fossil finds — a complete skeleton of a large aquatic plesiosaur , Elasmosaurus , that had four flippers and a long neck — he commented that the fossil 's head was on the wrong end , evidently stating that Cope had put the skull at the end of the vertebrae of the tail . Cope was outraged and the two argued for some time until they agreed to have Leidy examine the bones and determine who was right . Leidy came , picked up the head of the fossil and put it on the other end . Cope was horrified since he had already published a paper on the fossil with the error at the American Philosophical Society . He immediately tried to buy back the copies , but some remained with their buyers ( Marsh and Leidy kept theirs ) . The whole ordeal might have passed easily enough had Leidy not exposed the cover @-@ up at the next society meeting , not to alienate Cope , but only in response to Cope 's brief statement where he never admitted he was wrong . Cope and Marsh would never talk to each other amicably again , and by 1873 , open hostility had broken out between them . 
 The rivalry between the two increased towards the latter half of the 1870s . In 1877 , Marsh received a letter from Arthur Lakes , a schoolteacher in Golden , Colorado . Lakes had been hiking in the mountains near the town of Morrison with his friend , H. C. Beckwith , looking for fossilized leaves in the Dakota sandstone . Instead , the pair found large bones embedded in the rock . Lakes wrote that the bones were " apparently a vertebra and a humerus bone of some gigantic saurian . " While Lakes sent Marsh some 1 @,@ 500 pounds of bone , he also sent Cope some of the specimens . Marsh published his finds first , and having been paid $ 100 for the finds Lakes wrote to Cope that the samples should be forwarded to Marsh . Cope was offended by the slight . Meanwhile , Cope received bones from school superintendent O.W. Lucas in March 1877 from Canon City ; the remains were of a dinosaur even bigger than Lakes ' that Marsh had described .
