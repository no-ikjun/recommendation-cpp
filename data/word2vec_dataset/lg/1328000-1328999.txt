After passing by a developed area east of Chapel Hill , the route turns east and becomes the Nelson @-@ Chapel Hill Highway , a divided highway connecting Fordham Boulevard and I @-@ 40 . The route crosses I @-@ 40 at a partial cloverleaf interchange . After an intersection with Leigh Farm Road the road narrows to a 2 lane road and continues east toward Durham . As NC 54 approaches NC 751 ( Hope Valley Road ) , it widens again to a four lane road with a turning lane . Once reaching Hope Valley Road , a group of stores are found congregated around the intersection . The road has another immediate intersection with Garrett Road and then begins a slow turn toward the southeast before turning back into a two lane road and completing it 's southeasterly turn . After passing <unk> Drive the road again widens up to a four lane road . Several shopping centers appear as the road nears an intersection with Fayetteville Road .

However after passing McCrimmon Parkway , the area shifts to more industrial @-@ style commerce including several warehouses . The road intersects Airport Boulevard which provides access to Raleigh @-@ Durham International Airport . The road runs directly through the middle of Morrisville at intersections with Aviation Parkway / Morrisville Carpenter Road . As Chapel Hill Road bears further to the east , the highway splits from the railroad track that it had been previously running alongside of . Entering into Cary , the road serves as access to the Park West Village Shopping Center and the surrounding apartment complexes . Briefly after intersecting North West Cary Parkway , the road narrows back down from a four lane road to a two lane road . Continuing further the road meets back up with the railroad that it had previously broken away from and roughly begins to parallel it again . Chapel Hill Road makes a turn towards the east to meet up with Maynard Road . At the intersection , NC 54 turns left to follow along Maynard Road to the east . The four lane road passes by West Cary Middle School and Robert Godbold Park before entering into a mixed residential / commercial section north of the center of Cary .

 = = History = = 
 The routing for the original NC 54 was included on the 1916 map of the planned state highway system in North Carolina . However NC 54 was not officially marked on any state highway maps until 1924 ; it was routed from NC 75 in Pittsboro southeast to NC 50 in Moncure , connecting the town to US 1 . By 1929 the first NC 54 was decommissioned and was redesignated as a secondary road . 
 At the same time , NC 54 was signed along a new routing beginning at US 70 / NC 10 in Graham and running along its current routing to US 70 / NC 10 in Nelson . In 1930 the route was extended north to Virginia . NC 54 was placed onto a concurrency with NC 100 to Burlington , where it then followed a new routing through Ossipee to NC 703 near Thompsonville . The road followed along a brief concurrency with NC 703 to the west into Thompsonville where it then was extended back onto a new routing north to <unk> . It then replaced NC 709 north to the Virginia border . By 1940 the routing of NC 54 north of Graham was replaced by NC 87 . The route was then extended along a section of NC 93 to connect with US 70 on the western side of Burlington . NC 54 was extended along US 70A between 1952 and 1953 , and then placed onto Chapel Hill Road to Cary where it ended at US 1 . By 1955 , NC 54 was placed from its routing through downtown Chapel Hill along its current bypass around Carrboro and Chapel Hill . The previous routing was signed as NC 54A and by 1959 became NC 54 Business before being decommissioned in 1985 . The route was extended along <unk> Street by 1963 to the US 1 Freeway which later became Interstate 440 . Between 2000 and 2002 , NC 54 was routed onto the northern loop of Maynard Street around Cary . 
 = = Future = = 
 Currently the town of Morrisville is building an extension to McCrimmon Parkway along the eastern side of NC 54 and the center of town . The road , which is scheduled to be completed between 2018 and 2021 , would serve as a bypass NC 54 , which is mostly two lanes through the town . However there has been no official word from the North Carolina Department of Transportation ( NCDOT ) if the highway will be routed onto McCrimmon Parkway . 
 In October 2015 the towns of Cary and Morrisville held a joint meeting over the future of NC 54 between the towns . NC 54 currently has around 16 @,@ 000 – 20 @,@ 000 vehicles using the road each day . By 2040 the towns projects that nearly 45 @,@ 000 vehicles will be using the road daily . NCDOT , the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization , and the Town of Morrisville teamed up on the study of the six @-@ mile ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) corridor from NC 540 to Maynard Road . Ideally the road would become a four- to six @-@ lane superstreet from the Durham County line southeast into Cary . Besides the study the NCDOT has yet to allocate money to make improvements to NC 54 .

 North Carolina Highway 54 Alternate ( NC 54A ) was a renumbering of NC 54 through Carrboro ( via Main Street ) and Chapel Hill ( via Franklin Street , Columbia Street , South Road and Raleigh Road ) . The route was commissioned in 1955 after NC 54 was shifted from its downtown Chapel Hill routing to the new Carrboro and Chapel Hill bypass . NC 54A served as a connection into Chapel Hill and to the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill . The route was redesignated NC 54 Business ( NC 54 Bus . ) in 1959 . In 1985 the route was decommissioned and became only secondary streets .

 = = Gameplay = = 
 Steins ; Gate 's gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent on reading the text that appears on the screen which represents either the dialogue between the various characters or the thoughts of the protagonist . Like many other visual novels , there are specific points in Steins ; Gate where the user is given a choice to affect the direction of the game . 
 For these decision points , Steins ; Gate presents the user with the " phone trigger " ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) system which is similar to the " delusional trigger " system that was introduced in Chaos ; Head . When the player receives a phone call from somebody , the player can choose to answer or ignore the call . Incoming text messages will have specific words underlined and highlighted in blue , much like a hyperlink on a browser , where the player can select one to reply to the text message . Most phone calls or text messages do not have to be responded to though there are certain points in the game where the player is required to take action . Depending on the player 's choices on how to respond to these phone calls and text messages , the plot will progress in a specific direction . 
 = = Plot = = 
 = = = Setting and themes = = = 
 Steins ; Gate is set in the summer of 2010 , approximately one year after the events that took place in Chaos ; Head , in Akihabara . Physical locales of Akihabara like the Radio Kaikan building can be spotted in the game . According to Chiyomaru Shikura , who headed the planning of Steins ; Gate , Akihabara was chosen because it is an easy place for acquiring hardware parts , which makes it the ideal place for people interested in inventing and tinkering with things . The notion of time and time traveling are the main themes of the game . The concept of cause and effect is featured prominently in the game as the protagonist travels back in time numerous times to perform different actions in an attempt to alter what has happened in the future .

 = = = = True End route = = = = 
 The following summary is based upon the True End route . 
 Steins ; Gate takes place in the Akihabara district of Tokyo . On July 28 , 2010 , Rintarō Okabe and his friend Mayuri Shiina head towards the Radio Kaikan building for a conference , where Rintarō finds a girl named Kurisu Makise lying in a pool of blood . As Rintarō sends a text message about the incident to his friend , Itaru " Daru " Hashida , he experiences a strange phenomenon and the people around him disappear , with no @-@ one else noticing anything had changed . After later running into Kurisu , who is strangely alive and well , and discovering the message he had sent to Itaru had arrived a week before he sent it , Rintarō soon deduces that the ' Mobile Microwave ' he and his friends had been developing is , in fact , a time machine capable of sending text messages to the past . He and his friends soon learn that SERN , an organization that has been researching time travel for some time , has actually succeeded in sending humans into the past although they seem to have all resulted in the test subjects ' deaths . Rintarō begins experimenting with " D @-@ <unk> " ( <unk> , D <unk> , short for DeLorean mail ) , which begin to cause major differences in the timeline . Kurisu also manages to create a device to send a person 's memories through the microwave , allowing that person to effectively leap into the past . 
 However , SERN learns of the time machine and sends a group to retrieve it , killing Mayuri in the process . Using Kurisu 's time leap machine , Rintarō travels back in time numerous times to try to save Mayuri , but to no avail . As Rintarō reaches wit 's end , he is approached by Suzuha Amane , a girl from a future ruled by SERN due to their possession of a time machine , who tells him that he needs to return to a Beta world line in which Mayuri won 't die . By undoing the effects of the D @-@ <unk> that caused shifts in the time line , Rintarō regains possession of an IBN 5100 PC that they lost earlier , allowing them to crack into SERN 's systems and delete the evidence of Rintarō 's original D @-@ Mail . However , Rintarō realizes that by doing so , he would have to return to a world line in which Kurisu is dead . After realizing their feelings for each other , Kurisu tells Rintarō to save Mayuri . Reluctantly , Rintarō agrees and deletes the evidence of his D @-@ Mail from SERN 's database , returning him to the Beta world line . 
 Some time later , Suzuha appears before Rintarō , having arrived in a time machine from the future . She tells Rintarō that the only way to prevent World War III in the future is to prevent Kurisu 's death at the hands of her father , Dr. Nakabachi , who stole her time travel theory to publish it under his own name . However , this operation ends in a disaster as Rintarō ends up killing Kurisu himself by mistake . After this failure , Rintarō receives a message from his future self , telling him that the way to save Kurisu without altering the events that led to him developing a time machine is to fool his past self into believing Kurisu had been killed and thus achieving the final divergence value of 1 @.@ <unk> % , which he dubs the ' Steins Gate ' . Returning to the past again , Rintarō puts his own life in danger in order to save Kurisu 's life , prevent Nakabachi from successfully escaping with the time travel theory , and fool his past self , setting him on his journey through time . Returning to the Steins Gate world line , safe from the threat of a third world war , Rintarō and Kurisu manage to reunite by chance ( or by fate ) in the streets of Akihabara . 
 = = = = Alternate endings = = = = 
 The player 's choices throughout the game may result in alternate endings . 
 In the Suzuha Amane Ending , Okabe decides to not send the D @-@ Mail that would prevent him from pursuing Suzuha . In order to prevent Mayuri 's death , he re @-@ lives the final two days before her murder through constant time @-@ leaping . After countless leaps , Okabe loses all emotion and personality due to re @-@ living the same two days for all eternity . Eventually , Suzuha notices Okabe 's behavior . She tells him that he will slowly " die " on the inside , and the world 's set divergence will continue as planned . Both of them decide to travel to the past together and vow to stop SERN 's dystopian future , despite the possibility of both losing their memories on arrival . 
 In the Faris Nyannyan Ending , Okabe decides to not send the D @-@ Mail that results in the death of Faris ' father to try to stop the loss of the IBN 5100 computer . He instead sends a different D @-@ Mail in an attempt to convince Faris ' father to not part with the IBN computer . Beyond 1 % divergence is achieved , but the divergence meter gives a strange output and none of Okabe 's friends have any memories of him . In this <unk> , Okabe and Faris are a couple and live together , participating in <unk> Access Battlers card game tournaments . Although disappointed that none of his friends remember him , Okabe is still satisfied that he was able to prevent Mayuri 's death . He decides to build a new life with Faris at his side . 
 In the Luka Urushibara Ending , Okabe decides to not send the D @-@ Mail that reverts Luka back to a guy . He fully accepts Mayuri 's expected death and makes no more attempts to save her . Okabe and Luka decide to spend the rest of their lives together , both of them sharing a guilt and sadness that only they would understand . 
 In the Mayuri Shiina Ending , Okabe must choose between saving Mayuri or Kurisu . Realizing that he harbors romantic feelings for Mayuri , Okabe and Kurisu decide to return to the Beta <unk> in which Kurisu 's murder continues as planned . After hacking into SERN 's database with the IBN computer , 1 % divergence is achieved . Okabe vows to remember his memories of Kurisu , and spends his time with Mayuri as lovers . 
 The Kurisu Makise Ending follows a similar route to the True End . To achieve this ending , one must have had several conversations with Kurisu throughout the game . Doing so allows Okabe and Kurisu to realize their inner feelings for each other . Unlike the True End , Kurisu 's death is not prevented after the credits .

 Steins ; Gate is the second collaborative work between 5pb. and Nitroplus after Chaos ; Head . The game was created with the concept of " 99 % science ( reality ) and 1 % fantasy " in mind . The planning for Steins ; Gate was headed by Chiyomaru Shikura of 5pb . The characters were designed by <unk> <unk> , also known as ' Huke ' ( known as one of the illustrators of Metal Gear series , and the creator of Black Rock Shooter franchise ) whereas the gadgets were designed by Sh @ rp . Naotaka Hayashi of 5pb. wrote the scenario with assistance from Vio <unk> of Nitroplus . Tatsuya Matsuhara from 5pb. was the producer and <unk> <unk> from Nitroplus was the art director . The music was composed by Takeshi Abo of 5pb. and Toshimichi <unk> of Zizz Studio . Shikura , Hayashi , Matsuhara , Abo , and <unk> had all previously worked on Chaos ; Head . The title " Steins ; Gate " had no specific meaning , being coined from the German word " Stein " meaning stone , and tying in with famous physicist Albert Einstein . 
 Prior to the game 's announcement , a teaser site was featured on 5pb . ' s website that simply referred to the game as Project S ; G and stating that it was going to be a collaboration between 5pb. and Nitroplus . Nitroplus 's website had also hinted at this on its 10th anniversary website . Matsuhara , who was also the producer for Chaos ; Head , had previously stated that the game would be centred on Akihabara and that the project with Nitroplus would be the second part in a series around the theme " Science Novels ( <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) " . On June 12 , 2009 , the countdown expired and the name Steins ; Gate was revealed . 
 Matsuhara , who came up with the concept of the phone trigger system , stated that he initially wanted to incorporate the player 's own mobile phone into the system . However , the idea was abandoned due to concerns that it might clash with Japan 's privacy laws . When asked if the phone trigger system would be used in a possible sequel to the game , Hayashi stated that he hoped this would not be the case and recalled saying " who thought of this system ! " while writing the contents of the text messages . While Shitakura did not directly contribute to the script itself , Hayashi stated that Shitakura helped with the overall plot and provided assistance with the second half of the story . In particular , Shitakura helped a lot on the time traveling aspects of the story . Hayashi stated that while he did not want the script to repeat the same text over and over again , it was ultimately unavoidable due to the player having to travel back in time so he tried to place emphasis on the overall tempo of the plot 's development and how the plot unfolded . With regards to the theme of time traveling , Hayashi had felt that it seemed like a topic that was overdone and expressed concern over it when he first heard the idea from Shikura . 
 Kana Hanazawa stated that she was happy to have been selected to be in Steins ; Gate as she felt that it was not common to be able to play a part in a serious game . She also thought that the game gives the player more of a thrilling sensation rather than a frightening one and it entices the player to continue reading .

 = Kinzua Bridge = 
 The Kinzua Bridge or the Kinzua Viaduct ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / ) was a railroad trestle that spanned Kinzua Creek in McKean County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania . Before its collapse in 2003 , the bridge was 301 feet ( 92 m ) tall and 2 @,@ 052 feet ( 625 m ) long . 
 The bridge was originally built from iron in 1882 and was billed as the " Eighth Wonder of the World " , holding the record as the tallest railroad bridge in the world for two years . In 1900 , the bridge was dismantled and simultaneously rebuilt out of steel to allow it to accommodate heavier trains . It stayed in commercial service until 1959 and was sold to the Government of Pennsylvania in 1963 , becoming the centerpiece of a state park . Restoration of the bridge began in 2002 , but before it was finished , a tornado struck the bridge in 2003 , causing a large portion of the bridge to collapse . <unk> anchor bolts holding the bridge to its foundations failed , contributing to the collapse . 
 Before its collapse , the Kinzua Bridge was ranked as the fourth @-@ tallest railway bridge in the United States . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 and as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1982 . The ruins of the Kinzua Bridge are in Kinzua Bridge State Park off U.S. Route 6 near the borough of Mount Jewett , Pennsylvania .

 In 1882 , Thomas L. Kane , president of the New York , Lake Erie and Western Railway ( <unk> & W ) , was faced with the challenge of building a branch line off the main line in Pennsylvania , from Bradford south to the coal fields in Elk County . The fastest way to do so was to build a bridge to cross the Kinzua Valley . The only other alternative to building a bridge would have been to lay an additional 8 miles ( 13 km ) of track over rough terrain . When built , the bridge was larger than any that had been attempted , and over twice as large as the largest similar structure at the time : the Portage Bridge over the Genesee River in western New York . 
 The first Kinzua Bridge was built by a crew of 40 from 1 @,@ 552 short tons ( 1 @,@ 408 t ) of wrought iron in just 94 working days , between May 10 and August 29 , 1882 . The reason for the short construction time was that scaffolding was not used in the bridge 's construction ; instead a gin pole was used to build the first tower , then a traveling crane was built atop it and used in building the second tower . The process was then repeated across all 20 towers . 
 The bridge was designed by the engineer Octave Chanute and was built by the Phoenix Iron Works , which specialized in producing patented , hollow iron tubes called " Phoenix columns " . Because of the design of these columns , it was often mistakenly believed that the bridge had been built out of wooden poles . The bridge 's 110 sandstone masonry piers were quarried from the hillside used for the foundation of the bridge . The tallest tower had a base that was 193 feet ( 59 m ) wide . The bridge was designed to support a load of 266 short tons ( 241 t ) , and was estimated to cost between $ 167 @,@ 000 and $ 275 @,@ 000 . 
 On completion , the bridge was the tallest and longest railroad bridge in the world and was advertised as the " Eighth Wonder of the World " . Six of the bridge 's 20 towers were taller than the Brooklyn Bridge . Excursion trains from as far away as Buffalo , New York , and Pittsburgh would come just to cross the Kinzua Bridge , which held the height record until the <unk> viaduct , 401 feet ( 122 m ) tall , was completed in France in 1884 . Trains crossing the bridge were restricted to a speed of 5 miles per hour ( 8 @.@ 0 km / h ) because the locomotive , and sometimes the wind , caused the bridge to vibrate . People sometimes visited the bridge in hopes of finding the loot of a bank robber , who supposedly hid $ 40 @,@ 000 in gold and currency under or near it . 
 = = Second construction and service = = 
 By 1893 , the <unk> & W had gone bankrupt and was merged with the Erie Railroad , which became the owner of the bridge . By the start of the 20th century , locomotives were almost 85 percent heavier , and the iron bridge could no longer safely carry trains . The last traffic crossed the old bridge on May 14 , 1900 , and removal of the old iron began on May 24 . 
 The new bridge was designed by C.R. Grimm and was built by the Elmira Bridge Company out of 3 @,@ 358 short tons ( 3 @,@ 046 t ) of steel , at a cost of $ 275 @,@ 000 . Construction began on May 26 , starting from both ends of the old bridge . A crew of between 100 and 150 worked 10 @-@ hour days for almost four months to complete the new steel frame . Two Howe Truss " timber travelers " , each 180 feet ( 50 m ) long and 16 feet ( 5 m ) deep , were used to build the towers . Each " traveler " was supported by a pair of the original wrought @-@ iron towers , separated by the one that was to be replaced . After the middle tower was demolished and a new steel one built in its place , the traveler was moved down the line by one tower and the process was repeated . Construction of each new tower and the spans adjoining it took one week to complete . The bolts used to hold the towers to the anchor blocks were reused from the first bridge , which would eventually play a major role in the bridge 's demise . Grimm , the designer of the bridge , later admitted that the bolts should have been replaced . 
 The Kinzua Viaduct reopened to traffic on September 25 , 1900 . The new bridge was able to safely accommodate one of the largest steam locomotives in the world , the 511 @-@ short @-@ ton ( 464 t ) Big Boy . The Erie Railroad maintained a station at the Kinzua Viaduct . Constructed between 1911 and 1916 , the station was not manned by an agent . The station was closed sometime between 1923 and 1927 . 
 Train crews would sometimes play a trick on a brakeman on his first journey on the line . When the train was a short distance from the bridge , the crew would send the brakeman over the rooftops of the cars to check on a small supposed problem . As the train crossed the bridge , the rookie " suddenly found himself terrified , staring down three hundred feet [ 91 m ] from the roof of a rocking boxcar " . Even after being reconstructed the bridge still had a speed limit of 5 miles per hour ( 8 km / h ) . As the bridge aged , heavy trains pulled by two steam locomotives had to stop so the engines could cross the bridge one at a time . Diesel locomotives were lighter and did not face this limit ; the bridge was last used by a steam locomotive on October 5 , 1950 . 
 The Erie Railroad obtained trackage rights on the nearby Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ( B & O ) line in the late 1950s , which allowed it to bypass the aging Kinzua Bridge . Regular commercial service ended on June 21 , 1959 , and the Erie sold the bridge to the Kovalchick Salvage Company of Indiana , Pennsylvania , for $ 76 @,@ 000 . The bridge was reopened for one day in October 1959 when a wreck on the B & O line forced trains to be rerouted across the bridge . According to the American Society of Civil Engineers , the Kinzua Bridge " was a critical structure in facilitating the transport of coal from Northwestern Pennsylvania to the Eastern Great Lakes region , and is credited with causing an increase in coal mining that led to significant economic growth . " 
 = = State park = = 
 Nick Kovalchick , head of the Kovalchick Salvage Company , which then owned the bridge , was reluctant to dismantle it . On seeing it for the first time he is supposed to have said " There will never be another bridge like this . " Kovalchick worked with local groups who wanted to save the structure , and Pennsylvania Governor William Scranton signed a bill into law on August 12 , 1963 , to purchase the bridge and nearby land for $ 50 @,@ 000 and create Kinzua Bridge State Park . The deed for the park 's 316 acres ( 128 ha ) was recorded on January 20 , 1965 , and the park was opened to the public in 1970 . 
 An access road to the park was built in 1974 , and new facilities there included a parking lot , drinking water and toilets , and installation of a fence on the bridge deck . There was an official ribbon cutting ceremony on July 5 , 1975 , for the park , which " was and is unique in the park system " since " its centerpiece is a man @-@ made structure " . The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 29 , 1977 , and was named to the National Register of Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks on June 26 , 1982 . 
 The Knox and Kane Railroad ( <unk> ) operated sightseeing trips from Kane through the Allegheny National Forest and over the Kinzua Bridge from 1987 until the bridge was closed in 2002 . In 1988 it operated the longest steam train excursion in the United States , a 97 @-@ mile ( 156 km ) round trip to the bridge from the village of <unk> in Forest County , with a stop in Kane . The New York Times described being on the bridge as " more akin to ballooning than railroading " and noted " You stare straight out with nothing between you and an immense sea of verdure a hundred yards [ 91 m ] below . " The railroad still operated excursions through the forest and stopped at the bridge 's western approach until October 2004 . 
 As of 2009 , Kinzua Bridge State Park is a 329 @-@ acre ( 133 ha ) Pennsylvania state park surrounding the bridge and the Kinzua Valley . The park is located off of U.S. Route 6 north of Mount Jewett in Hamlin and Keating Townships . A scenic overlook within the park allows views of the fallen bridge and of the valley , and is also a prime location to view the fall foliage during in mid @-@ October . The park has a shaded picnic area with a centrally located modern restroom . Before the bridge 's collapse , visitors were allowed on or under the bridge and hiking was allowed in the valley around the bridge . In September 2002 the bridge was closed even to pedestrian traffic . About 100 acres ( 40 ha ) of Kinzua Bridge State Park are open to hunting . Common game species are turkey , bear and deer .

 On July 21 , 2003 , a tornado struck the Kinzua Bridge , snapping and uprooting nearby trees , as well as causing 11 of the 20 bridge towers to collapse . There were no human deaths or injuries . The tornado was produced by a mesoscale convective system ( MCS ) , a complex of strong thunderstorms , that had formed over an area that included eastern Ohio , western Pennsylvania , western New York , and southern Ontario . The MCS traveled east at around 40 miles per hour ( 60 km / h ) . As the MCS crossed northwestern Pennsylvania , it formed into a distinctive comma shape . The northern portion of the MCS contained a long @-@ lived mesocyclone , a thunderstorm with a rotating updraft that is often conducive to tornados . 
 At approximately 15 : 20 EDT ( 19 : 20 UTC ) , the tornado touched down in Kinzua Bridge State Park , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from the Kinzua Bridge . The tornado , classified as F1 on the Fujita scale , passed by the bridge and continued another 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ) before it lifted . It touched down again 2 miles ( 3 km ) from Smethport and traveled another 3 miles ( 5 km ) before finally dissipating . It was estimated to have been 1 ⁄ 3 @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 5 km ) wide and it left a path 3 @.@ 5 miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) long . The same storm also spawned an F3 tornado in nearby Potter County . 
 Since 2002 , the Kinzua Bridge had been closed to all " recreational pedestrian and railroad usage " after it was determined that the structure was at risk to high winds . Engineers had determined that during high winds , the bridge 's center of gravity could shift , putting weight onto only one side of the bridge and causing it to fail . An Ohio @-@ based bridge construction and repair company had already started work on restoring the Kinzua Bridge in February 2003 . Construction workers had already packed up and were starting to leave for the day when the storm came . 
 When the tornado touched down , the winds had increased to at least 94 miles per hour ( 151 km / h ) and were coming from the east , perpendicular to the bridge , which ran north – south . An investigation determined that Towers 10 and 11 had collapsed first , in a westerly direction . Meanwhile , Towers 12 through 14 had actually been picked up off of their foundations , moved slightly to the northwest and set back down intact and upright , held together by only the railroad tracks on the bridge . Next towers four through nine collapsed to the west , twisting clockwise , as the tornado started to move northward . As it moved north , inflow winds came in from the south and caused Towers 12 , 13 , and 14 to finally collapse towards the north , twisting counterclockwise . 
 The failures were caused by the badly rusted base bolts holding the bases of the towers to concrete anchor blocks embedded into the ground . An investigation determined that the tornado had a wind speed of at least 94 miles per hour ( 151 km / h ) , which applied an estimated 90 short tons @-@ force ( 800 kN ) of lateral force against the bridge . The investigation also hypothesized that the whole structure oscillated laterally four to five times before fatigue started to cause the base bolts to fail . The towers fell intact in sections and suffered damage upon impact with the ground . The century @-@ old bridge was destroyed in less than 30 seconds . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The state decided not to rebuild the Kinzua Bridge , which would have cost an estimated $ 45 million . Instead , it was proposed that the ruins be used as a visitor attraction to show the forces of nature at work . Kinzua Bridge State Park had attracted 215 @,@ 000 visitors annually before the bridge collapsed , and was chosen by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Parks for its list of " Twenty Must @-@ See Pennsylvania State Parks " . The viaduct and its collapse were featured in the History Channel 's Life After People as an example of how corrosion and high winds would eventually lead to the collapse of any steel structure . The bridge was removed from the National Register of Historic Places on July 21 , 2004 . 
 The Knox and Kane Railroad was forced to suspend operations in October 2004 after a 75 percent decline in the number of passengers , possibly brought about by the collapse of the Kinzua Bridge . The Kovalchick Corporation bought the Knox and Kane 's tracks and all other property owned by the railroad , including the locomotives and rolling stock . The Kovalchick Corporation also owns the East Broad Top Railroad and was the company that owned the Kinzua Bridge before selling it to the state in 1963 . The company disclosed plans in 2008 to remove the tracks and sell them for scrap . The right @-@ of @-@ way would then be used to establish a rail trail . 
 Pennsylvania released $ 700 @,@ 000 to design repairs on the remaining towers and plan development of the new park facilities in June 2005 . In late 2005 , the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources ( DCNR ) put forward an $ 8 million proposal for a new observation deck and visitors ' center , with plans to allow access to the bridge and a hiking trail giving views of the fallen towers . The Kinzua Sky Walk was opened on September 15 , 2011 in a ribbon @-@ cutting ceremony . The Sky Walk consists of a pedestrian walkway to an observation deck with a glass floor at the end of the bridge that allows views of the bridge and the valley directly below . The walkway cost $ 4 @.@ 3 million to construct , but is estimated to bring in $ 11 @.@ 5 million in tourism revenue for the region . 
 = James MacLachlan = 
 Squadron Leader James Archibald Findlay MacLachlan DSO , DFC & Two Bars ( 1 April 1919 – 31 July 1943 ) was a Royal Air Force ( RAF ) fighter pilot and flying ace of the Second World War . MacLachlan was credited with 16 German and Italian aircraft shot down in approximately 250 missions — 7 were at night of which two were achieved over Malta in 1941 and 5 over France in 1942 . 
 Born in Cheshire in 1919 , MacLachlan joined the RAF aged 17 in March 1937 . He progressed quickly through flight training and was granted a commission as acting pilot officer on 3 May 1937 . He completed his flight training in early 1939 and had considerable time to gain experience in operational types upon the outbreak of the Second World War . When the Battle of France began in May 1940 he was serving with No. 88 Squadron RAF flying the Fairey Battle light bomber he was credited with two enemy aircraft damaged and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross ( DFC ) . 
 Surviving the battle he transferred to fighter pilot school in the summer 1940 . During the Battle of Britain he served with No. 73 Squadron RAF and No. 145 Squadron RAF . He achieved a probable victory during the battle . In late 1940 he transferred to Malta in the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations and joined No. 261 Squadron RAF . By February 1941 he had achieved eight victories ( two at night ) . He was awarded a bar to his DFC on 11 February 1941 . MacLachlan was wounded in action on 16 February 1941 . His arm was so severely damaged it was amputated but he returned to operations in November 1941 with an artificial limb . 
 MacLachlan joined No. 1 Squadron RAF as squadron leader and led night fighter operations in defence of Britain . In May 1942 he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order ( DSO ) after claiming five more victories flying with Karel Kuttelwascher . Coupled with the two over Malta it qualified him as a night fighter ace . By July 1942 MacLachlan 's tally stood at 13 enemy aircraft shot down including 7 at night . MacLachlan left the squadron for a position at the Air Fighting Development Unit ( ADFU ) . In October 1942 MacLachlan departed to conduct lecturing tours to the United States . He returned to Britain with the ADFU in mid @-@ 1943 . In June he joined No. 132 Squadron RAF on cross @-@ Channel patrols over Europe . MacLachlan achieved his last 3 victories during these operations — all in one mission — to bring his final tally to 16 . 
 On 18 July 1943 the P @-@ 51 Mustang in which he was flying was hit by German flak or suffered engine failure and crashed over France . The Germans reported him as a prisoner of war but he died in a military hospital from his injuries . MacLachlan was awarded a second Bar to his DFC on 30 July 1943 in absentia . During the course of his combat career he flew the Fairey Battle , Hawker Hurricane , Supermarine Spitfire and P @-@ 51 Mustang .

 James MacLachlan was born on 1 April 1919 at Styal in Cheshire , the second of six children of Hugh MacLachlan and his wife Helen ( née Orr @-@ Ewing ) . The <unk> lived in the family home in Styal , where Hugh was employed as an oil and chemical manufacturer until his premature death in 1928 from peritonitis . Following their father 's death the family moved to Southampton to be close to Helen 's parents . Her father Archibald Orr @-@ Ewing was connected with the Plymouth Brethren , China Inland Mission and the missionary field . His influence resulted in James enrolling at King Edward 's evangelical school for two years . After completing his preliminary education James boarded at the Anglican Monkton Combe School in September 1931 aged 12 . James ' brothers , Hugh Jnr , Gordon and Archie would follow him through the institution . 
 MacLachlan was not academically talented although he did excel at poetry and attracted trouble from his school masters by forming libellous rhymes about his contemporaries and members of staff . He played rugby and enjoyed rowing but was not generally a sporty child . He enjoyed wildlife and animals . It encouraged in him a fascination with biology , and he regularly supplied rabbits and other specimens to the laboratory . He was never appointed a prefect and did not rise to a notable rank in the School Officer Training Corps . James preferred to engage in carpentry and metal work . He and his friends built and manufactured a .22 pistol in the workshops which they test fired . 
 Keen to acquire a real firearm , he obtained a service revolver but shot himself in the hand . Eager for adventure , MacLachlan contemplated his future . At 17 he travelled to Scotland in May 1936 for a holiday near <unk> and Crieff . While there he went for a five @-@ shilling flight at the RAF Leuchars open day which , according to his mother , made up his mind to become a pilot . He gained his School Leaving Certificate and gained entry into the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) on a short service commission one month short of his 18th birthday in March 1937 . 
 = = Early RAF career = = 
 On 1 March 1937 he arrived at the No. 10 Elementary Training School and Reserve Flying Training Centre at RAF <unk> in Wiltshire . It was run by the British Aeroplane Company . He was assigned to B Flight . MacLachlan was uncomfortable with the military banter and the use of religious profanities . He also complained about the bills applicants were forced to pay . Mess bills were reportedly £ 2 10s per week and laundry 5s . Most of his salary was expended on these necessities . 
 MacLachlan was not given time to settle in . His first flight was in a Tiger Moth on 2 March 1937 in which he gained a 45 @-@ minute experience in an open @-@ cockpit . He flew solo for the first time on 9 March after rapidly coming to grips with his trainer . He wrote , " You will be glad to hear I went solo today ... Mr Sharp did a slow roll . It was pretty grim when we were upside down with nothing but 6 @,@ 000 feet of air between us and the ground ..... I simply love flying . " MacLachlan was the youngest trainee of the group and after 23 solo and 28 hours dual flight he passed as an average grade pilot on the 27 April . He had come second overall in his examinations . He travelled to RAF Uxbridge the following month . There , he was commissioned acting pilot officer service number 39639 on 18 May 1937 . He was posted to No. 3 Flying Training School at Grantham in Lincolnshire . He flew the Hawker Hart and the Hawker Audax for the first time on 20 May 1938 . He enjoyed the speed of the aircraft immensely and indulged in his passion for motor cars by buying an Austin 7 from a Nottingham dealership with his first pay cheque for £ 14 7s . 
 Despite getting lost in navigational exercises he passed as an " above average " pilot and his probation was passed . MacLachlan made his choice as to the type of squadron he wanted to fly with . He chose from a list of medium bomber or light bomber squadrons and proceeded to the No. 3 Advanced Flying Training School in Gloucestershire . At the school he practised dive @-@ bombing and level bombing attacks and exercised in close air support operations and rounded off his training at RAF Penrose near , Pwllheli North Wales at the No. 5 Armament Training Camp . On 26 November 1937 MacLachlan once again passed as an " above average " pilot . He was promptly posted to No. 88 Squadron RAF at RAF Boscombe Down . <unk> logbook read 92 hours flying to his credit . 
 MacLachlan did not like the bomber training . In a letter to his mother he described his grievances , " We have started bombing today . It 's awful ! You have to lie on your belly and look through the trapdoor in the bottom of the plane [ Hawker Hart ] . All the hot oily air from the radiator blows straight into your face . It makes me feel quite sick ! " . He was enthusiastic about describing the mathematical problems associated with aerial bombing and the use of cameras to judge accuracy rather than using live @-@ munitions , but MacLachlan was more enamoured with air @-@ to @-@ air gunnery . He wrote of his training , " I have been doing air @-@ to @-@ air gunnery with the front guns today . It is super ! " Live ammunition was used at the end of the training . MacLachlan was permitted to train using 16 bombs , which cost £ 1 1s each . 
 Number 88 Squadron was a new unit and part of the expansion schemes of the late 1930s designed to increase the number of aircraft in response to the threat of the German Luftwaffe . He joined the squadron on 6 December 1937 and it was re @-@ equipped with the Fairey Battle . He flew the aircraft for the first time on 30 December . On 1 March 1938 his commission as pilot officer was confirmed and in May 1938 he joined the No. 7 Armament Training Station in Northumberland to engage in formation flying , aerial gunnery and bombing practice . It also practiced mock attacks on the British Army 2nd Infantry Division . By the time war broke out in September 1939 , MacLachlan had two years of experience of flying the machine . 
 = = Second World War = = 
 On 1 September 1939 , Germany invaded Poland . MacLachlan 's squadron moved to France on 2 September , and Britain and her allies declared war the following day . 88 Squadron formed part of the RAF Advanced Air Striking Force ( AASF ) commanded by Air Vice @-@ Marshal Patrick Playfair . On 12 September 1939 88 Squadron was based southeast of Rheims . At this time the Luftwaffe was heavily engaged in Poland and only a few small @-@ scale skirmishes were fought with a thin German fighter screen left to guard western Germany against a French attack . On 20 September elements of the squadron were intercepted by Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters from Jagdgeschwader 26 ( Fighter Wing 26 ) over the border . Four Fairey Battle aircraft were shot down . On 30 September 150 Squadron lost five Battles on unescorted missions into German airspace . It quickly became clear to the crews that the Battle was too slow and too poorly armed to defend itself and operations were shut down . The squadron took measures to increase its defensive power by adding a third machine gun in the back of the cockpit for the observer to use . 
 On 26 October MacLachlan was promoted to flying officer , and undertook an attack mission . During the course of the flight his wingtip made contact with the ground but he was able to return to base . The squadron settled down into winter quarters until March when they were reassigned to the French border region with Spain . On 1 April he celebrated his 21st birthday and took the opportunity of driving from Perpignan across the frontier into the Pyrenees to celebrate it . On 9 April the squadron was put on alert when the Germans invaded Denmark and Norway and the squadron were soon relocated to northern France at <unk> . On 10 May the Phoney War came to a close with the German invasion of Western Europe . 
 = = = Battle of France = = = 
 The Squadron did not see action in the Battle of France on the first day of the campaign — 10 May — but many other Battle squadrons did and suffered high losses attacking German ground forces . The squadron 's airfield came under air attack from the first day . Junkers Ju 88s destroyed hangars and two aircraft in a night attack . On 11 May it was bombed again and three of four aircraft were lost attacking German Army columns in daylight hours . On 14 May McLachlan flew his first sortie over the Sedan bridgeheads . The German thrust at Sedan threatened to outflank the Maginot Line in the south and the Allied Armies in the north by breaking through in the centre and advancing to the English Channel . On 12 May Sedan fell . Heinz Guderian 's XIX Panzer Corps and Georg @-@ Hans Reinhardt 's XXXXI Panzer Corps were breaking through onto the west bank on the 14 May . Desperate to halt the attacks , General Marcel Têtu , commander of the Allied Tactical Air Forces in consultation with Air Vice @-@ Marshal Playfair , commander of the AASF , ordered all available units to attack . No. 88 Squadron was committed to the air offensive . Six aircraft attacked armoured column positions , four attacked bridges . One aircraft was lost . Despite heavy anti @-@ aircraft fire and German fighter opposition MacLachlan attacked and got away at low altitude . Allied units suffered 50 percent losses that day . On 15 May the airfield was hit twice again and the squadron moved back near Troyes . 
 On 19 May the squadron flew night operations owing to German air superiority . MacLachlan flew a raid against Givet , on the French @-@ Belgian border ; his only action in support of Allied forces in the Battle of Belgium . He was ordered to fly daylight missions on 21 May near the Somme where German Panzer units were seen to be moving . The squadron claimed one German tank destroyed . His low @-@ level flying did not impress his observer , Sergeant Hardy , who said to a member of the squadron : " I don 't want to be killed by that f * * * * * g MacLachlan – he does not care for his crew . I 'm going to the <unk> and ask to be <unk> " — the commanding officer approved his request . On his next mission Hardy was shot down and killed in action with his new pilot . MacLachaln then took a new gunner , Les Davies who later flew night fighters . 
 MacLachlan flew missions against rail targets in Germany on 23 May , attacking Bingen am Rhein . On 25 May he flew against targets near Sedan and his Battle was damaged by flak . The unit relocated to <unk> and he flew missions in support of French Army forces around Abbeville . On 10 June near Fleury , his cockpit hood was shot away by accurate ground fire but MacLachlan was unhurt . On 13 June he flew a daylight mission against German spearheads and while returning to base flew under a formation of Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers . The escorting Bf 109s gave chase and shot one Battle down . MacLachlan claimed to have managed to fire on two Bf 109s and damaged them — these claims cannot be confirmed . 
 One last raid was carried out on the 14 June — the day Paris fell — and the squadron abandoned France as Allied resistance crumbled . They landed at Houssay airfield . They then took off for RAF Driffield in Yorkshire . As they crossed over England MacLachlan took a detour to do a low fly @-@ past over his old school at Monkton Combe near Bath . The stunt was witnessed by his brother who was attending the institution at the time . 88 Squadron relocated to Belfast , Northern Ireland on 23 June for rest and refitting . Following intensive operations during the Battle of France MacLachlan was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross ( DFC ) ( gazetted 16 July 1940 ) . 
 = = = Battle of Britain to Malta = = = 
 MacLachlan did not take to his new posting and was eager to get back to the action . MacLachlan volunteered for service with RAF Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain which had begun in July 1940 . He learned on the 18 August that he had been one of five pilots chosen from 88 Squadron to retrain as fighter pilots . He was posted to RAF Drem for training with No. 145 Squadron . He flew a Hawker Hurricane fighter for the first time days later on 22 August . Within nine days he had logged 18 hours in the type . On 3 September he was given official leave to travel to London . There he received his DFC at Buckingham Palace . He returned to No. 145 shortly afterwards and was based at RAF Tangmere , Croydon and Westhampnett . No. 11 Group RAF was in the thick of the fighting and suffered many casualties . MacLachlan and his group were to replace the many pilots killed or wounded . MacLachlan practiced operational take @-@ offs , fighter tactics , radio control , break @-@ aways and dogfights — the essence of air @-@ to @-@ air combat . He was sent on patrols on 30 August , but only over Scotland , to guard against attacks from Luftflotte 5 ( Air Fleet 5 ) based in Norway . No interceptions were made as air combat was rare in the north . On 21 September MacLachlan survived a force @-@ landing at Dyce , caused by an oil leak . On 27 September 1940 MacLachlan was posted to the south at Debden , arriving two days later . He was then assigned to No. 73 Squadron RAF at RAF Castle Camps . 
 On 30 September MacLachlan flew in defence of London as a large raid sought to attack the city . The RAF fighters performed well but 73 Squadron did not encounter the enemy . As September ended the Luftwaffe began sending fighter @-@ bombers ( <unk> ) — bomb carrying Bf 109s — over England . The following day MacLachlan was promoted to flight lieutenant in view of his experience . On 7 October he intercepted one such raid and engaged in air @-@ to @-@ air combat for the first time as a fighter pilot . At 09 : 50 the unit was scrambled to defend Chelmsford . Flying with No. 257 Squadron they overflew the Thames Estuary . No contact was made . At 12 : 30 they were scrambled again . This time MacLachlan spotted two Bf 109s at 20 @,@ 000 feet . Six more attacked the squadron and MacLachlan managed to fire a burst which hit one and it dove away emitting smoke and gained a probable victory . On 12 October 1940 MacLachlan pursued a Heinkel He 111 over Castle Camps but could not catch the enemy machine which was too far away at high altitude . It proved to be his last encounter with the enemy during the Battle of Britain . 
 Two weeks later MacLachlan learned he was to be relocated to Malta . Twelve pilots and 207 men boarded HMS Argus in the River Clyde just off Greenock on 7 November 1940 and set sail for the Mediterranean Theatre of Operations . The convoy sent to Malta constituted a part of Operation Collar . The operation was to supply aircraft for the Island 's defence . In June 1940 Italy had declared war on France when the country was on the verge of collapse at the hands of the German Wehrmacht . The Italians hoped they could take advantage of the weakened Allies by joining the Axis Powers . It was the Italian intent to launch a series of air , naval and land offensives throughout the Mediterranean and in particularly in North Africa . Malta lay across Italian sea communications between Sicily and Italian @-@ held Libya . The island had the potential to be a useful base from which the British could disrupt Axis supplies to and from North Africa and the ensuing North African Campaign . The Regia Aeronautica ( Italian Air Force ) resolved to eliminate the island by bombing shipping bringing in supplies and attacking the island directly . With air power crucial to both sides , the island was reinforced . 
 MacLachlan found himself at the heart of the battle for the island before the squadron arrived . On 27 November the convoy came under attack from the Italian Navy in the Battle of Cape Spartivento . MacLachlan saw the Italian fleet at a distance and witnessed enemy shells splashing around the ship . He also witnessed an attack by Italian Savoia @-@ Marchetti SM.79 bombers but they failed to damage the ships . Most of the Hurricanes that took off from the Argus fell into the water out of fuel . The pilots had not run the Hurricanes at economic speeds for fuel consumption . 
 Serving on Malta with No. 261 Squadron at RAF Ta ' Qali , MacLachlan soon got bored , with little to do and no aircraft to fly . He was granted a trip to Tangiers in Spanish Morocco for Christmas and New Year 's leave . While there he was arrested by the authorities for taking pictures near a Spanish Navy facility and released a short time later . He travelled to Gibraltar where he <unk> trips on flying boats from No. 202 Squadron RAF which was monitoring German and Vichy French shipping sailing between eastern Spanish ports and Italy . MacLachlan returned to Malta on a Short Sunderland on 5 January 1941 . 
 = = = Over Malta = = = 
 A new convoy , codenamed Operation Excess was on its way through Malta with ammunition supplies . Excess coincided with the arrival of the Luftwaffe Fliegerkorps X ( 10th Air Corps ) in Sicily to support the faltering Italians in the theatre , after the failed invasion of Egypt . On 9 January the Regia Aeronautica flew a fighter sweep over the Grand Harbour . Eighteen Macchi <unk> from 6 ° Gruppo were engaged in aerial combat . MacLachlan climbed to 22 @,@ 000 feet and spotted the enemy fighters 10 @,@ 000 below . He attacked a group of six and shot one down into the sea where it left a large plume of water . MacLachlan circled the sea and noticed the Italian pilot had escaped his aircraft and survived . Capitano Luigi Armanino was taken aboard a rescue craft to a prisoner of war camp in Malta , wounded in the thigh and arm . MacLachlan claimed a second Macchi shot down minutes later . The following day he attacked an Italian Fiat CR.42 over the Excess convoy as the Italians attacked the ships once more . Four others appeared and they climbed over him and dropped onto his tail . Not risking a five to one encounter , MacLachlan flew over the Excess convoy hoping the ship 's fire would protect him The British vessels fired at him in error but his aircraft was not hit . 
 By the 10 January HMS Illustrious had docked in Malta . The Luftwaffe attacked the ship again and scored six damaging hits . MacLachlan 's squadron failed to intercept the Ju 87 dive bombers that morning . On 16 January he witnessed several formations of Ju 87s and Junkers Ju 88s attack the ship . Unable to stand the sight , he raced with a fellow pilot to a dispersal strip and asked to take @-@ off only to be refused permission . Three days later , MacLachlan was in action against two German units : Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 ( StG 2 — Dive Bomber Wing 2 ) and Sturzkampfgeschwader 1 ( StG 1 — Dive Bomber Wing 1 ) . He attacked one Ju 87 killing the gunner before dispatching it into the sea . Returning to base he spotted a Ju 87 that had double @-@ backed , hoping to slip past the defences to attack the aircraft carrier . MacLachlan destroyed the aircraft ( 3 – 4 victories ) and then had to take evasive action when attacked by an Italian <unk> He shot the Italian fighter down : <unk> Maggiore <unk> from <unk> Squadriglia bailed out was taken prisoner . He passed single CR.42s and Ju 87s flying low and unaware of his presence but his ammunition was exhausted . During the course of the mission his fifth victory made him a fighter ace . RAF fighters claimed six Ju 87s shot down during the air battle and three can be confirmed . Oberfeldwebel Kurt <unk> and his gunner was killed as was Unteroffizier Rudolf Vater — both served in I. / StG 1 . <unk> Hans <unk> of II . / StG 2 was also killed . A further I. / StG 1 Ju 87 returned badly damaged with a dead gunner . 
 Frustrated at exhausting his ammunition he landed . After the Hurricanes had been refuelled he was scrambled again to intercept an enemy formation . MacLachlan stumbled across a Cant <unk> @-@ B bomber of 612 Squadriglia during the sortie which he destroyed . The pilot , <unk> Ignazio Rossi was killed in action . After landing , yet another raid came in . MacLachlan climbed and singled out a Junkers Ju 88 of 8 . / Lehrgeschwader 1 ( LG 1 — Learning Wing 1 ) . The Ju 88 saw him coming and swung around to a head @-@ on position . After a brief turning duel MacLachlan hit the port engine and it crashed into the bay near <unk> Point . For his actions he was awarded a bar to his DFC on 24 January . 
 On 9 February he claimed a night victory — a Ju 88 which vanished . MacLachlan claimed it destroyed . The Malta Y Service was combing the air waves and picked up the German crew 's desperate distress calls . The aircraft was actually a He 111 from 5 . / Kampfgeschwader 26 ( KG 26 — Bomber Wing 26 ) . All the crew survived though one was wounded . Within half an hour he was in the air again . He engaged a Ju 88 from II . / LG 1 and claimed it shot down . In fact the Ju 88 managed to reach Catania , Sicily where it was written off in a crash @-@ landing . 
 Over the next few days morale began to sink when Bf 109s from 7 . / JG 26 , led by Oberleutnant Joachim Müncheberg appeared over Malta and immediately took a toll of Hurricanes . The British fighter could not match the performance of the Bf 109 . MacLachlan took a flight of them by surprise on the 11 February but the German pilots spotted them in time , climbed and dived . According to MacLachlan they " left us standing " — in his diary he noted the poor morale of the squadron owing to the success of the Bf 109s and he recorded the desperation of pilots eager to shoot one down . On 16 February 1941 MacLachlan 's Hurricane Mk . Ia ( <unk> ) was again in battle with the Luftwaffe . In the morning his squadron engaged Bf 109s over Malta . After careful manoeuvring he managed to get onto the tail of a Bf 109 but neglected to check his own six o 'clock position . He was hit by cannon fire which shattered his engine and cockpit . His left arm began bleeding profusely and ceased to function . He managed to remove his helmet and radio equipment and slide back the canopy and jump out . MacLachlan gave up trying to reach for his ripcord , assuming it must have been shot off . Later , MacLachlan said he had almost given up altogether when the thought of his mother reading the telegram informing her he had been killed in action spurred him on to try once again . He struggled and found the ripcord and deployed his parachute . Exhausted , he landed in a garden and lay there before being recovered . 
 MacLachlan probably was hit by a Bf 109 flown by Müncheberg himself — the German fighter leader had reported his 26th victory as a Hurricane with the pilot bailing out . He was the only British pilot to bail out in the battle . The Hurricane crashed near Addolorata Cemetery near Paola . MacLachlan remained in hospital with a severely wounded left arm . He was pumped with saline solution to prevent blood clotting but his arm was too badly damaged and it was amputated below the elbow . His determination and reputation was as such , the nurses and squadron were already taking bets on whether or not he would return to action within a fortnight on the day of the operation . While in hospital he began speaking with Luigi Armanino , the pilot he had shot down days earlier . Among the topics of discussion were strengths of the Italian aircraft and Armanino 's exploits piloting CR.42s during the Spanish Civil War . 
 MacLachlan stayed on Malta and took a flight in a transport aircraft on 6 March , winning the shilling bet . He embarked in HMS Defender on 22 March to return to Britain . He toured Egypt and then took a detour to Athens , Greece . The Axis had invaded Greece and Yugoslavia on 6 April and the Battle of Greece was on the verge of an out come within two weeks and MacLachlan was evacuated back to Egypt . He flew down the Nile River into Sudan and Kenya in a captured German Junkers Ju 52 and piloted the aircraft himself on 24 April . Stopping at various airfields he flew when he could . On one such occasion he flew a North American T @-@ 6 Texan in an aerobatic sortie . He reached South Africa on 10 May . He flew home on a Boeing 314 Clipper via Lagos , Bathurst in Gambia , Lisbon , Portugal , Dublin , Ireland arriving in Bristol on 7 August .

 MacLachlan reported to No. 1 Depot , RAF Uxbridge and two days later attended No. 2 Central Medical Board on 13 August . He was certified fit to fly and flew Supermarine Spitfire on 21 August . He moved to Bournemouth to see his brother Gordon who was now a pilot officer in No. 501 Squadron RAF . At Queen Mary 's Hospital he was fitted with a new arm . MacLachlan explained to the doctors that he required an arm that would allow him to fly a Hurricane . They designed a limb that allowed him to operate the throttle while taking the control column and firing button with his right hand . They spent hours studying the cockpit layout . The medical staff produced an arm with four spring @-@ loaded pins , like fingers , which enabled him to use the controls on the port side of the cockpit . They secured his left arm to the levers of the throttle quadrant : throttle , propeller pitch control , supercharger and mixture control . The landing gear controls were located on the right side . The artificial arm had to interact with the control column while the gear was being retracted or lowered . His new arm proved sufficient and in September 1941 he flew as many hours in Hurricanes as possible , though not without incident . On 7 September 1941 he force @-@ landed in darkness during a searchlight co @-@ operation exercise . On 28 September 1941 he nearly collided with a Bristol Blenheim in low @-@ cloud . Nevertheless , he was cleared for operational flying on 15 October . 
 On 3 November 1941 MacLachlan was promoted to squadron leader , and was given command of No. 1 Squadron at Redhill Aerodrome , equipped with the Hawker Hurricane Mk . IIc for night intruder operations over western Europe . MacLachlan was assigned his personal aircraft , Hurricane <unk> / <unk> @-@ Q. He painted an emblem showing a left arm with a cannon shell passing through it and the fingers giving the V sign . The squadron spent the winter , 1941 – 2 in intensive night fighter training with searchlight and ground control station . In February 1942 he attended the Searchlight School at Shrivenham . In his absence he missed the Channel Dash and subsequent air battle during which the squadron lost two pilots . The squadron scored its first success on 1 April — his 23rd birthday — when Karel Kuttelwascher — with whom he often flew — destroyed two Ju 88s . MacLachlan found locating German aircraft in the dark difficult , though he himself claimed a locomotive damaged on the night and left two of its wagons destroyed . 
 In 1942 the Baedeker Raids were in operation against British cities in retaliation for RAF Bomber Commands attacks on Germany . The Luftwaffe was stepping up its campaign although it was fully engaged on the Eastern Front . On 18 April Do 217s raided Portsmouth in retaliation for an attack on Lübeck on 28 / 29 March . An attack on Rostock resulted in retaliation with raids on Bath , Exeter , Canterbury , Norwich and York . On the night of 26 – 27 April 1942 the Luftwaffe attacked Bath . MacLachlan took off in the evening of the 26 April and headed for airfields around Evreux and Dreux . He claimed a I. / Kampfgeschwader 2 ( KG 2 — Bomber Wing 2 ) Dornier Do 217 destroyed which came down near Evreux severely damaged . A second was damaged but his port cannon jammed preventing its destruction . Air Vice Marshal Trafford Leigh @-@ Mallory sent his congratulations and his exploits were printed in The Times newspaper . On 30 April MacLachlan and Kuttelwascher set out again with a 25 @-@ minute interval between both . Kuttelwascher claimed a Do 217 and He 111 , but MacLachlan settled for the destruction of two locomotives between Le Havre and Rouen . He also damaged a tug boat on the Seine and destroyed another locomotive near <unk> . These successes were achieved in two missions on the same night . 
 On 4 / 5 May the Luftwaffe hit Exeter severely . That night MacLachlan claimed destroyed two He 111s of <unk> 506 . He trailed the German bombers back to France and attacked them where they believed they were safe . In fact both of his victims were Ju 88s which crashed near Dinard . From Feldwebel Robert <unk> 's Wrk Nr. 1528 , only the gunner was able to bail out , while observer Leutnant zur See ( naval rank ) Roman Wallner and <unk> Johan <unk> were killed . There was only one survivor from Unteroffizier Josef Palmer 's Ju 88D @-@ 4 Wrk Nr. 1154 ; Unteroffizier Karl Schorn managed to bail out but Leutnant zur See Ernst Tramp and Richard Staub were killed . 
 On 16 May MacLachlan was informed that he would be decorated with the Distinguished Service Order ( DSO ) . On 29 May the award was announced . His tally stood at 11 air victories and he was becoming a recognised night flyer and ground @-@ attack ace . On 18 May 1942 the BBC interviewed him for the 9 pm news . During the interview he gave his views on the dangers and thrills of night fighter operations . 
 On 3 / 4 June 1942 MacLachlan infiltrated a group of Do 217s from KG 2 as they orbited in preparation for landing at Saint @-@ André @-@ sur @-@ Orne . Within 14 seconds he had shot down two bombers and damaged two more ( victories 12 – 13 ) before German defences were alerted and began returning fire . Flying with Kuttelwascher , they trailed a formation of 15 German bombers that had raided Poole . Sighting them over their own airfield he destroyed one and then was detected by searchlights . Taking evasive action he latched onto another and shot it down . A third and fourth were damaged . Kuttelwascher arrived and as MacLachlan left and claimed another He 111 and Do 217 . MacLachlan saw two flashes on the ground denoting a crashed aircraft after he attacked . German records show two Do 217s shot down one crash @-@ landed and one severely damaged . MacLachlan 's first victim appears to have been Unteroffizier Gerhard Wagner 's Wrk Nr. <unk> Do 217 from 3 . / KG 2 . Wagner , Feldwebel Wilhelm <unk> , Unteroffizier Josef Maier and <unk> Anton Lamm were killed . Another II . / KG 2 Do 217 crashed there while another was severely damaged . Another Do 217 fell 40 miles south of Cherbourg but this machine — Wrk nr . 5331 piloted by Feldwebel Hans Koch of 7 . / KG 2 — was likely a victim of Kuttelwascher . All of the crew were killed in action . It was MacLachlan 's last victory with the squadron . He flew five more intruder sorties during which he returned via Antwerp and Ostend at near @-@ zero feet after his map had blown out the side @-@ canopy window on 26 June and chased a Ju 88 45 miles south of Selsey Bill without result on 2 July . 
 The Daily Express hailed their success with two articles , " The Killers Who Stalk By Night " . Needing a rest , the squadron was withdrawn to Yorkshire . On 31 July MacLachlan was posted to 59 Operational Training Unit ( OTU ) as an instructor . While there he and Kuttelwascher were decorated with the Czechoslovak War Cross by the exiled President of Czechoslovakia Edvard Beneš on 11 August 1942 . Before he left , MacLachlan had the opportunity to fly the Hawker Typhoon which was to replace 1 Squadron 's ageing Hurricanes . 
 = = = American tour = = = 
 While based at Crosby @-@ on @-@ Eden with 59 OTU MacLachlan spent time flying other types of aircraft including the Bristol Beaufighter . On 20 August 1942 he was posted to the Air Fighting Development Unit at RAF Duxford for a short time . MacLachlan flew as often as he could regardless of the activity . He flew as a co @-@ pilot in a Short Stirling heavy bomber and practiced fighter evasion techniques and then proceeded to fly 15 types of aircraft in 11 days . MacLachaln also flew Supermarine Spitfires , acting as an attacking fighter as well as the American @-@ made Bell P @-@ 39 Airacobra . MacLachlan also flew with the No. 1426 Flight RAF which operated captured German aircraft . He flew a Ju 88 , M2 + MK formerly of <unk> Flieger Gruppe 106 which force @-@ landed at RAF <unk> in November 1941 . Hew flew in a passenger on Heinkel He 111 ( <unk> ) 1H + EN of 5 . / KG 26 which force @-@ landed in Scotland in February 1940 . At this time he provided escort to the resident Messerschmitt Bf 110 at the unit as it moved around airfields , although it is unknown if he flew it . By 4 October 1942 he had received notice that he had been selected as an RAF representative to tour the United States lecturing British and American trainee 's in United States Army Air Force facilities . MacLachlan left 59 OTU with immediate effect . 
 MacLachlan departed Liverpool for Canada aboard the RMS Queen Elizabeth in a heavily guarded convoy and arrived in Halifax , Nova Scotia on 17 October 1942 . He travelled to Montreal on 24 October where he was met by reporters and photographers to publicise the event before moving to New York City that night . From New York he went to Washington D.C on 28 October where he received orders from the RAF delegation . MacLachlan was to teach British officer cadets in American flying schools RAF General Service Regulations to prepare them for when they entered an OTU in Britain . Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery , Alabama was designated as his headquarters but MacLachlan was based at Eglin Air Force Base initially . His post necessitated trips to the Craig Air Force Base near Selma , Alabama . 
 MacLachlan travelled to flight schools across America . In November he flew to Orlando , Florida and across to Galveston , Texas near Palm Beach . The lecturing tour took him to Los Angeles California at the end of 1942 . By January 1943 he had also visited Arizona and Texas . His flight log had expanded throughout this period to include a variety of types . Using his privileged position he flew the Curtiss P @-@ 40 Warhawk , Lockheed P @-@ 38 Lightning and Republic P @-@ 47 Thunderbolt . Through flying MacLachlan felt the urge to participate in combat operations again but he enjoyed American hospitality immensely . In February he flew at an aerobatic show in Mesa , Arizona . On 18 February 1943 MacLachlan had a close call . While flying from Fort Stockton to El Paso , he force @-@ landed in the desert when he ran out of fuel . According to a legend , MacLachaln used a local pipeline to fill the tanks . While in America he undertook several public relations tours and met movie stars such as Orson Wells and Joan Fontaine when he visited Hollywood for autographed photo @-@ shoots . 
 On 6 March 1943 MacLachlan began the journey back to Britain . He flew to Canada in a Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar where he spent eight days with the RAF Ferry Command in Montreal flying B @-@ 25 Mitchells . MacLachlan flew one of these aircraft under the railway bridge in Quebec . From Canada he flew to <unk> West , Greenland then to Reykjavik , Iceland . MacLachlan reached Prestwick on 3 April 1943 . MacLachlan visited his comrades in 1 Squadron based nearby at <unk> before moving on to Hunsdon to see night fighter officer John Cunningham . MacLachlan may have wanted another squadron command but on 15 April 1943 MacLachlan was sent back to the Air Fighting Development Unit at RAF Wittering . 
 MacLachlan 's stay was unhappy . On 19 April 1943 he received news that his brother Gordon MacLachlan had been shot down over Brest , France while escorting B @-@ 24 bombers . They were intercepted by Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 190s belonging to 1 . / Jagdgeschwader 2 . Unteroffizier Erich Henning and Hauptmann Jürgen Heppe each claimed a Spitfire . 616 Squadron lost Gordon and Squadron leader Pip Lefevre . Lefevre survived and evaded capture , returning to Britain via Gibraltar . Gordon was killed and the Germans recovered the body and buried him at <unk> . MacLachlan was bitter at the loss of his brother and was keen to get back into action against the enemy . 
 = = Channel front and death = = 
 MacLachlan rejoined the <unk> at Wittering on 15 April 1943 . On 19 April he began trials in the P @-@ 51 Mustang ( termed Mustang IA by the RAF ) . He selected <unk> which became his personal mount . The P @-@ 51 , was at that time , powered by a Allison V @-@ 1710 and armed with two 20 mm cannon in each wing . MacLachlan also flew Mustangs powered by the Rolls @-@ Royce Merlin engine which proved so successful in later variants which flew and fought in the USAAF . MacLachlan visited his old school at Monkton on 29 May 1943 which had pledged £ 1 @,@ 000 for the five needed to buy a Spitfire as part of a local Wings for Victory campaign . 
 MacLachlan was not content in his position and pestered his superiors for an operational posting after weeks of practicing air combat with RAF Army Cooperation Command . Reluctantly , AOC Fighter Command Trafford Leigh @-@ Mallory gave him permission to carry out Ranger operations over occupied France . Since his return MacLachlan had been devising tactics for long @-@ range penetrations into enemy airspace , where Allied fighter aircraft had not operated before in daylight . He proposed to get through the Luftwaffe defence belt at low @-@ altitude and consequently trained in low @-@ level navigation by spending hours flying around England at tree @-@ top height . With this in mind , he flew a sortie on the 8 June 1943 . The poor weather combined with the sighting of two Fw 190s near Le <unk> forced him to turn for home . The rear @-@ ward vision of the P @-@ 51B ( or IA as the British referred to it ) , was limited . Flying alone where enemy aircraft could approach unseen was courting disaster and MacLachlan decided he needed assistance . 
 Flight Lieutenant Geoffrey Page had just arrived at the ADFU . He had been a fighter pilot but was shot down and badly burned on 12 August 1940 during the Battle of Britain . Page was also keen on vengeance and approached MacLachlan in the Mess and proposed a two @-@ fighter patrol . He said that he wanted one German fighter for each of the 15 operations he had endured since 1940 . The two pilots began to practice together in two Mustangs . The operation required little wind , so it would not interfere with navigation and a low cloud base to allow the two to spot enemy aircraft silhouette against it at even great distances . Hawker Typhoons from <unk> 's former 1 Squadron to carry out diversion attacks against shipping off Boulogne . The operation was flown on 29 June 1943 . At 08 : 55 they took off from RAF Lympne . Page later recalled , " Fine bloody pair we are , going off to tackle the enemy with only one good hand between us ! " 
 As the two P @-@ 51s crossed over the Seine and reached Rambouillet , they sighted a formation of enemy aircraft . Brief bursts of machine gun fire dispatched four Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 56 trainers — two falling to MacLachlan . Their victims were from JG 105 . Gefreiter Walter Seigler was killed in Wrk . Nr. 1868 and Kurt Prager died in Wrk Nr. <unk> . Gefreiter Alois <unk> was wounded and the aircraft written off and the fourth was able to force @-@ land safely , damaged . Gefreiter <unk> @-@ Gerd Kuhn was unhurt . They continued their hunt and flying near <unk> spotted two Ju 88 night fighters or bombers coming into land . MacLachlan destroyed the first and shared the second with Page . Both aircraft belonged to IV . / Kampfgeschwader 6 ( KG 6 — Bomber Wing 6 ) . The pilots — Gefreiter Gerhard Zimmermann and Unteroffizier Karl Brocks — were killed . The Mustangs retreated when the airfield defences retaliated with gunfire . MacLachlan and Page returned at 1 @,@ 000 feet and crossed the coast south @-@ west of Dieppe and crossed between Brighton and Newhaven upon their return . MacLachlan was awarded a second Bar to his DFC while Page received the DFC . 
 Page and MacLachlan flew to No. 96 Squadron RAF which was then flying de Havilland Mosquito night fighters . He requested his old gunner , Les Davies , who now piloted Mosquitos to join them . Davies accepted but MacLachlan was killed before he could take up the offer . MacLachlan and Page flew to Tangmere on 15 July . On his next mission on 18 July 1943 MacLachlan 's Mustang <unk> was probably hit by ground fire when crossing the French coast near Dieppe . Page noticed MacLachlan 's Mustang suddenly pull up sharply from their tree @-@ top height by about 1 @,@ 000 feet . He saw MacLachlan pull back the canopy but apparently changed his mind about bailing out as the aircraft leveled out and descended . The Mustang then headed towards a small field . MacLachaln touched down three @-@ quarters the way across and the Mustang ploughed into an orchard at the field 's edge which ripped off the wings . Page orbited the crash site several times and considered landing to rescue him but the space was too confined . Page dived at the wreck and took gun @-@ camera footage but could see no signs of life and then headed home . The Operations Record was unable to determine the cause of the crash . MacLachlan made no radio broadcast . It was possibly the result of enemy small @-@ arms fire or mechanical failure . On 30 July MacLachlan was awarded a second Bar to his DFC . 
 MacLachlan was critically injured . The Germans took him prisoner , and treated him for a fractured skull at Field Hospital 711 at Pont @-@ l 'Évêque . MacLachlan lingered for 13 days before succumbing to the wounds on 31 July 1943 . He was buried at Pont @-@ l 'Évêque Communal Cemetery in Grave 4 , Zone 7 . French civilian Monsieur Huet and his son attended the funeral that was administered by a German priest . They took a photograph of the grave which was covered in flowers by French civilians . A wooden plaque was placed there with the words " He died so France might live " — German authorities quickly had it removed . Page learned years later that McLachlan survived the crash and died weeks afterwards . MacLachlan 's wartime score was 16 aircraft claimed destroyed , one shared with three aircraft claimed damaged .

The episode was written by Eric Kaplan and directed by Rich Moore . Guest stars in this episode include the Beastie Boys as themselves and Dan Castellaneta voicing the Robot Devil . The episode is one of the first to focus heavily on Bender . In the episode , he develops an addiction to electricity . When this addiction becomes problematic , Bender joins the Temple of Robotology , but after Fry and Leela tempt Bender with alcohol and prostitutes , he quits the Temple of Robotology and is visited by the Robot Devil for sinning , and Bender is sent to Robot Hell . Finally Fry and Leela come to rescue him , and the three escape . 
 The episode introduces the Robot Devil , Reverend Lionel Preacherbot and the religion of the Temple of Robotology , a spoof on the Church of Scientology . The episode received positive reviews , and was one of four featured on the DVD boxed set of Matt Groening 's favorite episodes : " Monster Robot Maniac Fun Collection " .

 After a Beastie Boys concert , Bender attends a party with his old friend , Fender , a giant guitar amp . At the party Bender and the other robots abuse electricity by " jacking on , " and Bender develops an addiction . After receiving a near @-@ lethal dose from an electrical storm , Bender realizes he has a problem and searches for help . He joins the Temple of Robotology , accepting the doctrine of eternal damnation in Robot Hell should he sin . After baptizing him in oil , the Reverend Lionel Preacherbot welds the symbol of Robotology to Bender 's case . As Bender begins to annoy his co @-@ workers with his new religion , Fry and Leela decide they want the " old Bender " back . They fake a delivery to Atlantic City , New Jersey and tempt Bender with alcohol , prostitutes and easy targets for theft . 
 He eventually succumbs , rips off the Robotology symbol and throws it away , causing it to beep ominously . While seducing three female robots , Bender is interrupted by a knock at his hotel room door . He opens the door and is knocked unconscious . He awakens to see the Robot Devil and finds himself in Robot Hell . The Robot Devil reminds Bender that he agreed to be punished for sinning when he joined Robotology . After discovering Bender is missing , Fry and Leela track him down using Nibbler 's sense of smell . They eventually find the entrance to Robot Hell in an abandoned amusement park that Fry remembers from the 20th @-@ century ( he claims the place shut down after a bunch of people got salmonella from the flume ride ) . A musical number starts as the Robot Devil begins detailing Bender 's punishment . As the song ends , Fry and Leela arrive and try to reason with the Robot Devil on Bender 's behalf . 
 The Robot Devil tells them that the only way to win back Bender 's soul is to beat him in a fiddle @-@ playing contest , as required under the " Fairness in Hell Act of <unk> " . He begins the contest by playing a bit of Antonio <unk> 's " La Ronde des <unk> " . Leela responds , having experience in playing the drums , but after a few notes it is clear Leela 's fiddle playing is pathetic , so she assaults the Robot Devil with the fiddle instead . As Fry , Leela , and Bender flee the Robot Devil 's clutches , Bender steals the wings off a flying torture robot , attaches them to his back , and airlifts Fry and Leela to safety . Leela drops the heavy golden fiddle onto the Robot Devil 's head , making them light enough to escape . Bender promises to never be too good or too evil but to remain as he was before joining the Temple of Robotology .

 David X. Cohen and Ken Keeler traveled to New York to work with the Beastie Boys for their role . They waited three days for the Beastie Boys to call and say they were willing to record but eventually gave up and returned to the studios in Los Angeles . The audio tracks were recorded later . Adam " MCA " Yauch was unavailable at the time of the recording so only Adam " King <unk> " Horovitz and Michael " Mike D " Diamond voice themselves in the episode , with Horovitz also voicing Yauch . The Beastie Boys perform their 1998 hit single " Intergalactic " and " Super Disco Breakin " , the first track from their album , Hello Nasty . It was initially requested that they perform " Fight for Your Right " but they declined . The episode also contains Futurama 's first original musical number . The lyrics to " Robot Hell " were written by Eric Kaplan and Ken Keeler and the music was written by Keeler and Christopher <unk> . When praised for his performance in the audio commentary , John DiMaggio , the voice of Bender , noted that the most difficult part of the performance was singing in a lower octave rather than keeping up with the song 's fast pace . 
 The episode lampoons drug addiction and religious conversion . In the DVD commentary for the episode , David X. Cohen , Matt Groening and Eric Kaplan all agreed that they felt comfortable enough with each of the Futurama characters to begin to take them in new and strange directions . Cohen noted that Bender 's addiction is a perfect example of something they could do with a robot character which they could not get away with had it been a human character . One person at the studio refused to work on this episode because they did not agree with the portrayal of some of the religious content . Cohen also noted that the writing team had begun to loosen up during this episode , which gave it a feel similar to the series ' later episodes . Kaplan claimed that before editing , there was enough material to make a three @-@ part episode .

 This episode is one of very few that focuses on the religious aspects of the Futurama universe . In most episodes , it is indicated that the Planet Express crew , along with most beings in the year 3000 , are " remarkably <unk> " . It introduces two of the religious figures of Futurama , The Robot Devil and Reverend Lionel Preacherbot , both of whom make appearances in later episodes . Preacherbot , who speaks in a manner typical of inner @-@ city African @-@ American pastor stereotypes , converts Bender to the religion Robotology . This leads to a series of events that are similar in many ways to the experiences of real world religious converts . Mark Pinsky states that the episode has a " double @-@ edged portrayal of religion " as it portrays both an improvement in Bender 's character but also some of the " less pleasant characteristics of the newly pious " . The Robot Devil is introduced after Bender 's fall back into sin . Pinsky writes in The Gospel According to The Simpsons , that while explaining to Bender his claim on his soul , the Robot Devil uses logic similar to that used by many Southern Baptists : " Bender tried to plead his case , without success . ' You agreed to this when you joined our religion , ' the devil replies , in logic any Southern Baptist would recognize . ' You sin , you go to robot hell — for all eternity . " By the end of the episode , Bender has returned to his old ways and states that he will no longer try to be either too good or too bad , a parody and contradiction of the Book of Revelation statement that one should not be lukewarm in his faith . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 This episode contains a large amount of religious parody , with references to many religiously themed works of fiction . The episode 's title is itself a parody of the famous line " Hell is other people " from Jean @-@ Paul Sartre 's one act play No Exit , though the episode has no other resemblance to the play . The punishments in Robot Hell are similar to the levels and rationale which are portrayed in Dante 's The Divine Comedy , specifically the Inferno . The " Fairness in Hell Act " , where the damned may engage in a fiddle battle to save his soul and win a solid gold fiddle , is taken directly from The Charlie Daniels Band song " The Devil Went Down to Georgia " . Jokes poking fun at New Jersey are included because writer David X. Cohen and actor John DiMaggio both grew up there . 
 The Temple of Robotology is a spoof of the Church of Scientology , and according to series creator Matt Groening he received a call from the Church of Scientology concerned about the use of a similar name . Groening 's The Simpsons had previously parodied elements of Scientology in the Season 9 episode " The Joy of Sect " . In a review of the episode , TV Squad later posed the question : " Is the Temple of Robotology a poke at the Church of Scientology ? " When TV Squad asked actor Billy West about this , he jokingly sidestepped the issue .

 " Hell Is Other Robots " is one of four episodes featured in the DVD boxed set Monster Robot Maniac Fun Collection , Matt Groening 's favorite episodes from the first four seasons . The DVD includes audio commentary from Groening and John DiMaggio , the voice of Bender , as well as a full @-@ length animatic of the episode . In an article on the DVD release , Winston @-@ Salem Journal described " Hell Is Other Robots " as one of Futurama 's best episodes . Dan Castellaneta 's performance as the Robot Devil in this episode and " The Devil 's Hands are Idle Playthings " was described as a " bravura appearance " . In a review of Futurama 's first @-@ season DVD release , the South Wales Echo highlighted the episode along with " Fear of a Bot Planet " as " crazy episodes " of the series . Brian <unk> of The Age gave the episode a rating of three stars out of four . 
 Writing in The Observer after Futurama 's debut in the United States but before it aired in the United Kingdom , Andrew Collins wrote favorably of the series and highlighted " Hell Is Other Robots " and " Love 's Labors Lost in Space " . He noted that the jokes " come thick and fast " . John G. Nettles of PopMatters wrote : " ' Hell is Other Robots ' is a terrific introduction to Bender and Futurama 's irreverent humor , sly social satire , and damn catchy musical numbers . " TV Squad wrote that the series ' funnier material appears in " Robot Hell — after Bender is ' born again ' in the Temple of Robotology . " David Johnson of DVD Verdict described " Hell Is Other Robots " as " Not one of my favorites " , criticizing the episode for focusing a large amount on the character of Bender .

 " Blood Oath " is the 19th episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , and originally aired on March 27 , 1994 in broadcast syndication . The story was created by Peter Allan Fields and the episode was directed by Winrich Kolbe . The choreography of the ending fight scene was created by Dan Curry and Dennis Madalone , while the score was created by Dennis McCarthy . 
 Set in the 24th century , the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine , a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy . In this episode , three legendary Klingon warriors come to the station to meet with Jadzia Dax ( Terry Farrell ) before going off on a crusade of vengeance . 
 The episode featured the return of John Colicos , William Campbell and Michael Ansara to the Klingon roles of Kor , Koloth and Kang , respectively . Each of those actors had previously portrayed the roles in episodes of Star Trek : The Original Series . The story was based on the films Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven , and scenes were filmed on location in Pasadena , California as well as on sound stages at Paramount Studios . The episode was watched by 8 @.@ 4 million viewers , and the opinions of critics were mixed . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Security Chief Odo ( René Auberjonois ) is having a succession of problems with Klingons . First , Quark ( Armin Shimerman ) complains about an elderly drunken Klingon monopolizing a holosuite . Odo removes the man , Kor ( John Colicos ) , and takes him to a holding cell . A short time later , another Klingon , Koloth ( William Campbell ) , comes to release him , but changes his mind when he sees he is still quite drunk . Jadzia Dax ( Terry Farrell ) overhears their names and realizes why they have come , which is confirmed when they are joined by a third Klingon , Kang ( Michael Ansara ) . Eighty @-@ one years ago , the three Klingons destroyed the power base of a pirate leader known as " The Albino " ( Bill <unk> ) . The pirate retaliated by infecting each of their firstborn sons with a deadly virus . Curzon Dax , a close friend of the three Klingons , was godfather to Kang 's murdered son , and the four of them swore a Klingon " blood oath " to find and kill the Albino . Now , eighty @-@ one years later , Kang says he has finally found him . 
 Jadzia confides in Major Kira Nerys ( Nana Visitor ) that she feels obligated to pursue Curzon 's oath , but Kira warns her about what killing someone will do to her . Kang , likewise , tells Jadzia that she is not bound by Curzon 's oath , but she insists on joining their quest . Kor , as buoyant as ever , is delighted to have her along . Koloth is dismissive , until she shows him her skills with a Klingon bat 'leth . Kang refuses to accept her , until she shames him with his own devotion to Klingon honor , and insists that she have the chance to avenge her godson . Before Jadzia can request a leave of absence , Commander Benjamin Sisko ( Avery Brooks ) confronts her in her quarters , refusing her request before she can make it . Jadzia tells him that she is going and begs him not to make her disobey a direct order . He does not give her permission to go but does not stop her either .

 " Blood Oath " featured the return of Colicos , Campbell and Ansara in the Klingon roles that they had previously portrayed in Star Trek : The Original Series . The story by Peter Allan Fields originally featured new Klingon characters , but Robert Hewitt Wolfe suggested the use of the characters from The Original Series . There were concerns that the three actors were no longer working , but the casting team on Deep Space Nine tracked down John Colicos and Michael Ansara but couldn 't find William Campbell . They subsequently discovered he was doing Star Trek conventions on cruise ships and signed up to appear once he was approached . Each of the previous appearances of those Klingon characters had been before the Klingon forehead ridge make @-@ up was in use , and so " Blood Oath " was the first time that each of these characters had been seen with the ridges applied . There was a consideration by the producers about whether or not to use the make @-@ up style as seen in The Original Series , but ultimately decided not to mention the change on screen . 
 The story was originally entitled " The Beast " and was intended to be a play on both the 1954 Akira Kurosawa film Seven Samurai and the 1960 remake , The Magnificent Seven . Fields had concerns that this didn 't come across in the final script , but intended for Koloth to represent Britt from The Magnificent Seven , whilst Kang was intended to be Yul Brynner 's character , Chris . Kor instead was based on Falstaff , who appeared in three plays by William Shakespeare . Colicos appeared as Kor , who had previously appeared as the first Klingon in the Star Trek franchise in The Original Series first season episode " Errand of Mercy " . Jordan Hoffman at the official Star Trek website described Kor as a " bumbling old uncle " and Koloth simply as a " <unk> " . He said that only Kang seemed similar to his original persona . Colicos would return a further two times as Kor on Deep Space Nine , in the episodes " The Sword of Kahless " and " Once More Unto the Breach " . The episode is one of several which follows up on the actions of Curzon Dax , the previous host of the Dax symbiont . A member of the Trill species is typically composed of a host and symbiont , with the symbiont passing to a new host upon the death of the previous one . Curzon was the host immediately prior to Jadzia . 
 Campbell had appeared as Koloth in " The Trouble with Tribbles " , although he had also portrayed Trelane in " The Squire of Gothos " . It had been an intention to feature Koloth as a recurring character within The Original Series but he was unavailable for the following appearance and so it was rewritten to feature another character . The character of Koloth returned in the Star Trek : The Animated Series episode " More Tribbles , More Troubles " but was voiced by another actor , James Doohan . Ansara returned as Kang , who had previously appeared in The Original Series third season episode " Day of the Dove " . Ansara returned as Kang once more in the Star Trek : Voyager episode " Flashback " which also guest starred George Takei and Grace Lee Whitney from The Original Series as well as several actors from Star Trek VI : The Undiscovered Country . He also returned to Deep Space Nine in the episode " The Muse " , to play <unk> , the husband of Lwaxana Troi , who in turn was played by Majel Barrett who not only did the voice for the computer in TNG , <unk> , & DS9 , and was married to Gene Roddenberry , but had also played Number One and Christine Chapel in The Original Series . Terry Farrell was interviewed during the third season of the show and described " Blood Oath " as one of the best episodes so far . 
 The Millard House in Pasadena , California was used to represent the outside of the fortress of the Albino , while the interior was filmed on Stage 18 in the Paramount lot . The fight scenes were jointly choreographed by Dan Curry and Dennis Madalone , with the scenes filmed over the course of two days . Direct Winrich Kolbe left the choreography completely in Curry and Madalone 's hands , but gave them instructions not to go overboard . Whilst filming the scenes , Kolbe had Richard Wagner 's opera Götterdämmerung played on a loop throughout . This operatic theme was taken forward by composer Dennis McCarthy in his score for the episode , who said that he abandoned all subtlety , and told the orchestra to " play the battles as battles " .

 Star Trek frequently shows death , in that crew members are killed in the line of duty . However , " Blood Oath " addresses the topic of pre @-@ meditated murder for revenge purposes . In order to gain perspective on her moral dilemma about whether or not to join the three Klingons in revenge , Dax discusses it with Kira , a former Bajoran terrorist . Her response is not clear cut , but recalls how murder left an impact on her that could not be fixed . Despite not dissuading Dax , she tells Sisko , who commands Dax not to go . After Dax returns , having helped the Klingons kill the Albino , both Sisko and Kira stand silent in disapproval of her actions .

 " Blood Oath " was first broadcast on March 27 , 1994 in broadcast syndication . It received Nielsen ratings of 8 @.@ 4 million . This placed it in sixth place in the timeslot . This was a decrease from the episode aired the previous week , as " Profit and Loss " gained a rating of 8 @.@ 8 million . It was higher than the episodes aired on the following three weeks , which were all repeats . 
 Several reviewers re @-@ watched the episode after the end of the series . Michelle Erica Green reviewed the episode in January 2004 for TrekNation . She didn 't like the changes to The Original Series era Klingons , and was disappointed that plot threads that the characters faced in their previous appearances such as the fate of the tribbles in " The Trouble with Tribbles " weren 't resolved . She thought that the episode was one of the better ones to place Dax in a central position and ignored any inconsistencies because she was a fan of cross @-@ generational episodes . Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website " Jammer 's Reviews " thought that " characterizations are flawless " and that the fight scene at the end of the episode was impressive . He gave the episode a score of three and a half out of four . Zack Handlen watched the episode for The A.V. Club in June 2012 . He thought that the episode worked , but wasn 't as powerful as it could have been and said " it ’ s too formal and too solemn to really rouse up the blood , and the most intriguing aspects of the plot are put to the side in favor of keeping things as straightforward as possible . " 
 The first home media release of " Blood Oath " in the United States and Canada was on VHS on October 6 , 1998 . It was later released on DVD as part of the season two box set on April 1 , 2003 .

He tells her to take Phoebe and Jenna Maroney ( Jane Krakowski ) on a girls ' day out . As their day progresses Liz senses Phoebe is not who she claims to be . Liz 's suspicions are confirmed when she covertly follows Phoebe to a restaurant and spies her holding hands with an older gentleman . This is alarming for two reasons : first , Phoebe is already engaged to Jack , and secondly , she has previously claimed to be afflicted by " Avian Bone Syndrome , " a result of which is that her purportedly brittle bones would not be able to stand such intense physical contact . Even though Liz tries to remain inconspicuous at the restaurant , Phoebe notices her . Knowing that Liz is on to her deceptions , Phoebe confronts Liz , who is not interested in Phoebe 's excuses and tells her that she has a choice : tell Jack about her cheating or Liz will do so herself . Phoebe becomes angry and then shocks Liz when she drops her British accent . Liz tries to tell Jack about her suspicions , but he is immediately offended by her seemingly unfounded and slanderous comments about his fiancée , which puts a heavy strain on their working relationship . 
 Finally , Tracy has somehow become entangled in a character assassination plot . When Frank Rossitano ( Judah Friedlander ) tells Tracy that he read in a magazine that Bill Cosby hates him , Tracy realizes that The Black Crusaders , a cabal of powerful African Americans ( a reference to the 2006 conspiracy theory hoax regarding a similar group called the Dark Crusaders driving Dave Chappelle off his Comedy Central show ) , are out to destroy his career .

 = Merry Christmas ( Mariah Carey album ) = 
 Merry Christmas is the first Christmas album , and the fourth studio album , by American singer and songwriter Mariah Carey . Released by Columbia Records on November 1 , 1994 , the album features cover versions of popular Christmas tunes and original material . Carey worked with Walter Afanasieff , with whom she wrote all of the original tracks , as well as producing Carey 's interpretations of the covered material . The album contains a contemporary holiday theme , and featured " authentic , gospel flavored background vocals " . The album received generally positive reviews and became a worldwide success . Critics praised Carey 's uplifting and flavored vocals , as well as her skilled songwriting alongside Afanasieff . Three singles were released from the album , of which All I Want for Christmas Is You went on to become one of the best @-@ selling singles of all time . 
 Merry Christmas was released at the peak of the initial stretch of Carey 's career , between Music Box ( 1993 ) and Daydream ( 1995 ) . The album produced the worldwide classic single , " All I Want for Christmas Is You " , which became the best @-@ selling holiday ringtone in the US .

 Carey has expressed her belief in God and her connection between music and spirituality , and felt the album was finally a way to portray her mysticism into music . After the success of Carey 's previous effort , Music Box , there was speculation of a new project in the works ; however it was not until October 1994 , only one month before the album 's release , that Billboard announced Carey would be releasing a holiday album for the Christmas season . Initially , critics were shocked ; they did not know how Carey would fare as an entertainer , as she had previously only been viewed as a pop star . Nevertheless , Carey , unaffected by the speculation , continued working on , and promoting the album in high spirits , confident in her work . The idea proved to be wise , earning Carey recognition in various markets including Christian radio and contemporary R & B stations , as well as extended her fame in Japan , where the album experienced much of its success . 
 = = Writing and development = = 
 Throughout the album 's development , Carey worked extensively with Walter Afanasieff , with whom she collaborated extensively on Emotions ( 1991 ) and Music Box ( 1993 ) . Together , they wrote all three of the album 's original songs , as well as producing most of the traditional tracks . " All I Want for Christmas Is You " , the album 's debut single , was written by Carey and Afanasieff , which was sent to top @-@ forty and adult contemporary stations , with the video having been filmed the year before . Another track they wrote , " Miss You Most ( At Christmas Time ) " , was sent to R & B stations , with " Jesus Born on This Day " , another original song , being sent to Christian and gospel radio stations around the world . 
 Additionally , Carey recorded a cover of " Christmas ( Baby Please Come Home ) " by Darlene Love , as well as classics such as " Silent Night " , " O Holy Night " and " Joy to the World " . The latter song , which was used as a promotional single , was remixed several times and sent to various clubs ; adding to the album 's range of listeners . Record producer and composer , Loris Holland , co @-@ produced some of the albums gospel flavored tracks , including " Silent Night " , where he arranged the backing vocals and synthesizers . Carey 's rendition of " Santa Claus Is Coming to Town " , was deemed as " one of the more playful tracks on the album " , alongside " Christmas ( Baby Please Come Home ) " . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Merry Christmas boasted a variety of musical arrangements , sounds and genres . Carey 's goal was to provide an album that would have a " Christmas feel " , providing a mixture of soulful tracks , as well as fun and joyous holiday treats . The song " Jesus , Oh What a Wonderful Child " , was described as an original track that " really took flight " . The song was recorded in a church , with many live back @-@ up singers and children playing tambourines and other melodious instruments . The goal was to produce a " real church flavored song " , in which Afanasieff played the keyboards and allowed Carey 's voice to " cut loose " . According to Chris Nickson , Carey 's love of gospel music came through on the track , writing , " [ she ] led the band without pushing herself forward , letting the song develop and work out , trading lines with the chorus until , after the crescendo , the musicians moved into a fast double time to the end . " 
 The album 's lead track , " All I Want for Christmas Is You " , was described as an " up @-@ tempo love song , one that could have easily been written for Tommy Mottola . " Another one of the album 's original tracks was , " Miss You Most ( At Christmas Time ) " , which was very different from its whimsical predecessor . The song was described as a " sad ballad " , in line with many of Carey 's previous hit singles . The song featured a synthesized orchestra , including keyboard notes courtesy of Afanasieff , during which Carey would sing to her " long @-@ gone lover , crystallizing the way that Christmas brought memories of the past into focus . " According to Nickson , it was " Jesus Born on This Day " , that was the most impressive original track on the album . It was described as a " full @-@ blown production number " , which again featured synthesized orchestra , as well as a live children 's choir . The song 's tune was described as " solemn and hymn @-@ like , but the arrangement , oddly , made it less religious and rather more glitzy , behind the lyrics that overtly praised Jesus . " 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 The album garnered generally positive reviews from music critics . Barry Schwartz , editor of Stylus Magazine , gave the album a very positive review , praising Carey 's vocals , the album 's authenticity and songwriting . Aside from the album , Schwartz lauded " All I Want for Christmas Is You " : " To say this song is an instant classic somehow doesn 't capture its <unk> ; it 's a modern standard : joyous , exhilarating , and loud , with even a hint of longing ( ooh longing ! ) . She sings , ' I don 't want a lot for Christmas / I won 't even wish for snow , ' such a beautiful phrase delivered with full sincerity over rolling pianos , spine @-@ squashing <unk> , philharmonic strings , and a quasi @-@ wall of sound — and Mariah 's gorgeous voice bursts through it all . Rats , why haven 't I been celebrating Christmas ? ! " J.D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun said that the album " may look like just another attempt to cash in on Christmas cheer , but is actually the work of someone who genuinely loves this music . Granted , Carey 's gospel inclinations come through a lot stronger than might be expected on traditional tunes like ' Silent Night ' , but that hardly diminishes the effect of her performance ; in fact , her soulful ornamentation adds oomph to the reading of ' O Holy Night ' . But the album 's real strength is the conviction she brings to otherwise corny fare like ' Santa Claus Is Comin ' to Town ' , while the way she augments ' Joy to the World ' with a bit of the Three Dog Night hit is pure genius . " 
 The album received a less enthusiastic review from Roch Parisien of AllMusic , who praised " All I Want for Christmas Is You " , writing , " On the positive side , her co @-@ penned ( one of three ) ' All I Want for Christmas Is You ' is a well @-@ crafted Phil Spector tribute , with Beach Boys @-@ style harmonies , jangling bells , and a sleigh @-@ ride pace , injecting one of the few bits of exuberant fun in this otherwise vanilla set . " However , he was more critical of Carey 's take on " O Holy Night " and " Joy to the World " , writing , " <unk> to high opera on ' O Holy Night ' and a horrid dance club take on ' Joy to the World ' . " Steve Morse from The Boston Globe commented " Her early albums were often polished to a fault , but she cuts loose with unbridled soul on the new Christmas disc . Oddly enough , it may be her best album . She blends original songs ( such as ' All I Want for Christmas Is You ' , which debuted in video form on MTV [ at the time ] ) with traditional carols ( ' Silent Night ' and ' Joy to the World ' ) and even Phil Spector 's Yuletide classic , ' Christmas ( Baby Please Come Home ) ' . " Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote " There are gospelly versions of familiar carols like ' Silent Night ' , dramatic ballads like her own ' Miss You Most ( At Christmas Time ) ' , and uptempo imitations , with chimes , of Phil Spector 's 1963 Christmas album , like ' Santa Claus Is Comin ' to Town ' . Regardless of backup , Ms. Carey <unk> , <unk> songs with her vocal tics — like sliding down from the note above the melody note — and turning expressions of devotion into narcissistic displays . "

 Carey is currently developing a musical film based on Merry Christmas . The plot revolves around a small town — perhaps not unlike Carey 's hometown of Huntington , New York — where a ruthless developer wants to turn the land into a large shopping plaza . " Mariah doesn 't want to let that happen , " says her producing partner Benny Medina . " Her character uses song and love to keep the Christmas spirit alive . " 
 According to Carey , the script will be written by High School Musical writer Peter <unk> , but is still in its early stages of production . However , Carey gave Daily News a few more details regarding the project , saying , " Since I recorded the Christmas album , I 've always wanted to make a movie to go with it , something that people could watch and hear and enjoy every year . I 'm into it . I 'm all about the holiday season . "

 " Shapes of Things " is a song by the English rock group the Yardbirds . With its Eastern @-@ sounding , feedback @-@ laden guitar solo and anti @-@ war / pro @-@ environmental lyrics , it " can justifiably be classified as the first psychedelic rock classic " , according to music critic Richie Unterberger . The song was built on musical elements contributed by several group members in three different recording studios in the US . When it was released as a single on 25 February 1966 , it was their first composition to become a record chart hit . The song reached the pop Top 40 in several countries , but , aside from compilations , was not included on a Yardbirds ' album . 
 The song features Jeff Beck 's musical use of feedback , which he learned to control by finding the guitar 's resonant points and bending the strings . Music writers have called his work groundbreaking and cited its influence on Paul McCartney and Jimi Hendrix . Several live Yardbirds recordings with Beck and later with Jimmy Page have been released . In 1968 , Beck reworked it for the lead track on his debut album Truth . The new arrangement , along with other album tracks , has been described as a precursor of heavy metal . " Shapes of Things " is included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 's permanent exhibit of the " Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll " and several artists have recorded renditions of the song . 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 By the end of 1965 , the Yardbirds had released three albums and several singles . However , except for a few B @-@ sides , their material was adapted from older blues and rhythm and blues songs or composed by songwriters not associated with the group . " I 'm a Man " , a reworking of the 1955 Bo Diddley song , was their latest Top 40 radio hit . Giorgio Gomelsky , the group 's producer and manager , arranged for the recording at Chess Records studio in Chicago during their first American tour in September 1965 . One week after the start of the group 's second US tour in December 1965 , they were again at Chess . According to drummer Jim McCarty , the Yardbirds were experimenting with their sound , but had yet been unable to translate it into a hit song : 
 We were really coming from not trying to create a sort of a 3 @-@ minute piece of music , it was just something that seemed natural to us . We started with the rhythm , we used a bass riff that came from a jazz record , got a groove going with that and then added a few other bits from elsewhere , other ideas that we 'd had . And I think it was a great success for us , it was a good hit record that wasn 't really selling out . And it was original . 
 Beck confirmed McCarty 's account and added , " Somebody 'd say , ' Let 's do something modern and exciting ; we know we can get a good blues sound , so let 's spread it out a little bit . ' It was all spur of the moment , man " . Over two days at Chess , a backing track was completed and the Yardbirds continued their American concert tour . Shortly after arriving in Hollywood , the group resumed recording at Columbia studios on 7 January and at RCA studios on 10 January 1966 . Singer Keith Relf contributed lyrics and a melody for the song . 
 Although Beck had been impressed with the Chess studio 's history and sound , he had been unable to complete a guitar solo to his satisfaction . " I kept changing guitar sounds all the way through . So we did two or three takes of my guitars and blended them all together . But the solo on " Shapes of Things " was pretty honest up until that feedback note that comes in over it " , he recalled . During the recording , " there was mass hysteria in the studio when I did that solo . They weren 't expecting it and it was just some weird mist coming from the East out of an amp . Giorgio was freaking out and dancing about like some tribal witch doctor " . Beck played the solo on one string ( G ) , using a 1954 Fender Esquire guitar he had purchased before the tour . Relf also benefitted from multi @-@ tracking — two vocal tracks were recorded , allowing him to harmonise the vocal line . 
 = = Lyrics and composition = = 
 Yardbirds ' biographer Gregg Russo describes the song " a quantum leap in their development ... [ it ] proved at once progressive and commercial — the perfect marriage of socially conscious lyrics and a driving rhythm " . Unterberger also saw the group moving into the area of social commentary that had begun with an earlier song , " You 're a Better Man Than I " . Beck biographer Martin Power describes the lyrics as pro @-@ environmental or anti @-@ war , while McCarty feels that it reflected the opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War . The actual lyrics are subject to interpretation : 
 Now the trees are almost green , but will they still be seen , when time and tide have been 
 Fall into your passing hands , please don 't destroy these lands , don 't make them desert sands 
 " Shapes of Things " is credited to bassist Paul Samwell @-@ Smith , Relf , and McCarty . Samwell @-@ Smith , who is also listed as the song 's musical director , believed that Beck should have also received a composer 's credit for his contributions to the song 's development . 
 According to music writer Keith Shadwick , their arrangement follows a " simple and economical form that allowed its message to unfold naturally , inviting the sound enhancement at which Beck and bassist Paul Samwell @-@ Smith were quickly becoming expert " . McCarty recalled that Samwell @-@ Smith got an idea for a bass line from a song by jazz pianist and composer Dave Brubeck ( identified as " Pick Up Sticks " from the 1959 Time Out album ) to which he added a marching @-@ style drum beat . As they started to develop the rhythm , chords were added – " G and F , and then resolving it in D , each verse . " For the middle section guitar solo , the beat shifts into double @-@ time and the instrumentation heightens the tension . This rhythmic device , originally used in jazz improvisation , was the Yardbirds ' signature arrangement . Dubbed a " rave @-@ up " , it was a feature of several of their songs . 
 A key feature of the song is Beck 's innovative guitar playing . Shadwick comments it " suited Beck 's taste for shaping and sculpting guitar sounds through the control and manipulation of sustain and , on occasion , feedback " . Beck recalled he began incorporating feedback into his guitar solos after he realised that he could control it , adding " I started finding the resonant points on the neck where it came in best . I loved it because it was a most peculiar sound that contrasted wildly with a plucked string , this round trombone @-@ like noise coming from nowhere . In addition to feedback , Beck 's uses a musical scale and bent notes variously described as Eastern , Indian , or raga sounding . Critics and biographers have called the solo " monumental [ ly ] fuzz @-@ drenched " , " explosively warped " , and " climaxed with a solitary , gigantic burst of feedback " . For many , the song represents the Yardbirds ' creative peak , including Beck . He commented , " ' Shapes of Things ' was the pinnacle of the Yardbirds " and added " if I did nothing else , that was the best single " .

 The first mention of the single was in February 1966 , when The Beat gave it a favourable preview and mentioned that Relf had written the song in Los Angeles while the Yardbirds were there for an extended engagement at the Hullabaloo Club in Hollywood . It was released simultaneously in the UK ( Columbia DB – <unk> ) and the US ( Epic 5 – <unk> ) on 25 February . In the UK , the B @-@ side was " You 're a Better Man Than I " . In the US , the B @-@ side was initially " I 'm Not Talking " , but was replaced on 25 March with " New York City Blues " ( Epic 5 – 10006 ) . The song appeared on the UK charts on 3 March and reached the peak position of number three . In the US , it entered Billboard magazine 's Hot 100 singles chart on 26 March at number 52 and peaked at number 11 on 14 May . For Billboard 's year @-@ end chart for the Top 100 singles of 1966 , " Shapes of Things " was ranked at number 93 . 
 The song 's first appearance on an album was in September 1966 on the UK Columbia Records various artists compilation Go , Vol . 1 . In the US , it was included as the opening track of The Yardbirds Greatest Hits , their highest charting American album . In 1971 , a version with Relf 's single vocal track was mistakenly issued in the UK on the Remember Yardbirds ' compilation . Subsequently , " Shapes of Things " has appeared on numerous Yardbirds compilations , including the comprehensive box set Train Kept A @-@ Rollin ' : The Complete Giorgio Gomelsky Productions ( re @-@ released as The Yardbirds Story ) and Rhino Records ' 2001 Ultimate ! 
 In 1971 , a live version recorded on 30 March 1968 in New York City with Page on guitar was included on Live Yardbirds : Featuring Jimmy Page . Relf announced the song saying " Most people thought that we could never , ever recreate the solo part on stage ; well we have a very good try at least — Jimmy ' Magic Fingers , Grand Sorcerer of the Magic Guitar ' " . Live versions have appeared on various semi @-@ official and bootleg albums over the years . Seven are included on the 2010 rarities collection Glimpses 1963 – 1968 , including one recorded a week after Page joined to play bass . A studio recording by the reconstituted Yardbirds in 2003 , with guitar by Steve Vai , is included on Birdland . 
 = = Jeff Beck Group version = = 
 In May 1968 , Jeff Beck re @-@ recorded " Shapes of Things " with his new band , the Jeff Beck Group , for their debut album Truth . According to Beck , vocalist Rod Stewart suggested that they record the song and Beck added , " let 's slow it down and make it dirty and evil " . Music critic Bruce Eder calls the reworking of the Yardbirds ' tune " strikingly bold ... deliberately rebuilding the song from the ground up so it sounds closer to Howlin ' Wolf " . Despite the new arrangement , the album liner notes only list the writer as Samwell @-@ Smith and on the 1991 <unk> boxed set , Chris Dreja is included along with Relf , McCarty , and Samwell @-@ Smith . 
 Beck continued to explore new guitar sounds and used a recently purchased Sho @-@ Bud steel guitar to create the slide fills for the song . Martin Power describes the songs ' instrumental break as " its ' pistols at dawn ' mid @-@ section , which found Jeff and [ drummer ] Micky Waller chasing each other through a maze of drum rolls , crashing cymbals , slashing chords , and creamy arpeggios " . 
 " Shapes of Things " was the first song on Truth and , with its aggressive , heavily @-@ amplified sound , set the tone for the album . Most of the album was recorded with Beck 's 1959 Gibson Les Paul guitar , occasionally routed through a Tone Bender fuzzbox effects pedal . Truth has been cited as the " prototype of heavy metal " ; according to Beck : " I suppose they [ the songs on Truth ] pointed towards that road , but not the heavy metal you recognise today " . Bolstered by a well @-@ received concert tour , Truth was very successful in the US , peaking at number 15 in the Billboard 200 album chart one month after its July 1968 release . In October 1968 , it was issued in the UK , but did not reach the album charts . After a concert on 11 October 1968 in Chicago , a promotional film was made of " Shapes of Things " , which is one of the few 1968 group performances caught on film . 
 = = Recognition and influence = = 
 " Shapes of Things " is included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame list of " 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll " <unk> magazine placed the song at number 61 in its March 2005 list of the " 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks Ever ! " Beatles ' historian Ian MacDonald , writing in Revolution in the Head , described Beck 's solo as " groundbreaking " , while Unterberger commented that " Shapes of Things " " can justifiably be classified as the first psychedelic rock classic " . MacDonald also identified it as the likely inspiration for Paul McCartney 's guitar solo in " Taxman " . Beck biographer Annette Carson goes further by adding that it was " widely held to have inspired " McCartney . Guitarist Mike Bloomfield claimed that Beck 's use of controlled feedback in Yardbirds ' songs influenced Jimi Hendrix 's approach . Shadwick adds that Hendrix closely studied Beck 's sonic approach on " Shapes of Things " . 
 Several artists have recorded " Shapes of Things " over the years , some following the original and others using the Jeff Beck Group arrangement . Led Zeppelin occasionally included a portion of the song in medleys during early concert performances . During his 1999 concert appearances with the Black Crowes , Page played it following Beck 's Truth arrangement . Their rendition appears on Live at the Greek as " Shapes of Things to Come " . Other recordings have been made by the Allman Joys , Black Stone Cherry , David Bowie , Dixie Dregs , FM , Jeff Healey Band , Richie <unk> , Gary Moore , Nazareth , Rush , Scorpions , and Michael Schenker . 
 = Yaropolk <unk> = 
 Yaropolk <unk> ( died 1087 ) was a Knyaz ( prince ) during the eleventh @-@ century in the Kievan Rus ' kingdom and was the King of Rus ( 1076 – 1078 ) . The son of Grand Prince Izyaslav Yaroslavich by a Polish princess named Gertruda , he is visible in papal sources by the early 1070s but largely absent in contemporary Rus sources until his father 's death in 1078 . During his father 's exile in the 1070s , Yaropolk can be found acting on his father 's behalf in an attempt to gain the favor of the German emperors and the papal court of Pope Gregory VII . His father returned to Kiev in 1077 and Yaropolk followed . 
 After his father 's death Yaropolk was appointed Prince of Volhynia and Prince of Turov in 1078 by the new Grand Prince , his uncle Vsevolod . By 1085 Yaropolk had fallen into a state of enmity with the Grand Prince , and by extension the Grand Prince 's son Vladimir Monomakh , forcing him to flee to Poland , his mother 's homeland . He returned in 1086 and made peace with Monomakh but was murdered the same year on a journey to <unk> . He was remembered in Rus sources as extremely pious and generous to the church and is recognized as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church . 
 = = Family background = = 
 Yaropolk was the son of Izyaslav Yaroslavich ( died 1078 ) , over @-@ king of the Rus ' , and Gertruda , daughter of the Polish Duke @-@ King Mieszko II Lambert ( died 1034 ) . Since the Kievan succession war of 1015 – 1019 , the Polish ruler Boleslaw had taken an interest in Ruthenia ( Kievan Rus ) , hoping to gain control of the land of Red Ruthenia ( <unk> <unk> ) , seized by Vladimir the Great . 
 Despite some initial success , the expedition of Boleslaw to Kiev in 1018 failed to establish Svyatopolk Vladimirovich ( Boleslaw 's son @-@ in @-@ law ) , Prince of Turov , on the Kievan throne . The Polish ruler did at least gain the Red Ruthenia ( <unk> <unk> ) very briefly , though that was recovered for the Ruthenians by Grand Prince Yaroslav and Mstislav Vladimirovich , Prince of Chernigov , in 1031 . 
 In 1042 Grand Prince Yaroslav forced Duke Casimir of Poland to settle for a peaceful deal . Casimir recognised Ruthenian control of Red Ruthenia and returned 800 Ruthenian prisoners who had been in Polish custody since being captured two decades before by Boleslaw . Peace was secured by two marriages . Casimir was married to Yaroslav 's sister , while Casimir gave his own sister Gertruda to Yaroslav 's son , Izyaslav . 
 = = Political turmoil = = 
 In 1054 , Yaropolk became the son of the Grand Prince , as in that year Izyaslav ascended the throne of Kiev . Izyaslav 's rule and thus Yaropolk 's security were however quickly challenged by Izyaslav 's brother Svyatoslav and by his cousin Vseslav <unk> . At this time among the Rurikids , there were two senior branches that could claim the Grand <unk> through descent from Vladimir the Great ; namely , the descendents of Yaroslav Vladimirovich and the descendants of Izyaslav Vladimirovich . 
 In 1067 , Vseslav rebelled in an attempt to overthrow Izyaslav and become Grand Prince himself , claiming the right as a great @-@ grandson of Vladimir the Great through Izyaslav Vladimirovich . Vseslav 's attempt was unsuccessful , and ended in his imprisonment . Troubles for Izyaslav were to continue though . In 1068 , Izyaslav 's alleged negligence to the advances and incursions of the Cuman people ( Polovtsy ) after the defeat at the Battle of the Alta River led the citizens of Kiev to revolt ; Vseslav was released , and took the Kievan throne while Izyaslav fled to Boleslaw in Poland . With Polish assistance Izyaslav returned in May 1069 , expelled Vseslav and retook the throne . This victory for Izyaslav secured the Kievan throne for the descendants of Yaroslav Vladimirovich , and thereafter the descendants of Izyaslav Vladimirovich confined themselves to Polotsk where they reigned with semi @-@ independent status . 
 = = Svyatoslav and exile to the west = = 
 Despite the successful exclusion of the Polotsk Rurikids , in 1073 Izyaslav was expelled from the Kievan throne by his brothers , Svyatoslav , Prince of Chernigov , and Vsevolod , Prince of Pereyaslavl . King Boleslaw was not as willing or able to assist Izyaslav this time around , and probably for this reason Izyaslav traveled further West ; at Mainz in early 1075 , Izyaslav sought the aid of King Henry IV of Germany , but to no avail . 
 Izyaslav sent Yaropolk to Rome to request aid from Pope Gregory VII . It is likely that while there Yaropolk made complaints about Boleslaw and about the money the latter had formerly seized from Izyaslav , as the pope subsequently issued a request that Boleslaw return it . Pope Gregory addressed a letter to Izyaslav , called " Demetrius " , " King of the Russians " , and to his " queen " Gertruda . The letter noted that Yaropolk , called " Peter " , had given his own as well as his father 's fidelity to the pope , and that it had been requested that the " kingdom of the Russians " be held of St Peter . Two papal legates were sent to Izyaslav , and Izyaslav was urged to give them his full co @-@ operation . 
 It was only after Svyatoslav 's death in late 1076 that Izyaslav was able to recover the status of Grand Prince . Vsevolod , who had previously fought against him , was appointed Prince of Chernigov and thus heir to the Kievan throne , explaining perhaps Vsevolod 's lack of opposition . The Poles were persuaded by the papacy to give Izyaslav assistance recovering his kingdom , and on July 15 , 1077 , Izyaslav re @-@ entered Kiev . 
 = = Prince Yaropolk = = 
 Yaropolk is found aiding his father and his uncle Vsevolod in 1078 , when Oleg Svyatoslavich ( and his brother Boris ) attempted to gain the throne of Chernigov from Vsevolod . Oleg had been allied to the Polovtsy , and with their help defeated Vsevolod in battle . Grand Prince Izyaslav and Yaropolk , as well as Vsevolod 's son Vladimir Monomakh , were able to reverse this result , and Oleg was forced to retreat to <unk> . Grand Prince Izyaslav , Yaropolk 's father , died as a result of the battle . 
 The Primary Chronicle records that in 1078 before the death of Izyaslav , Yaropolk was " ruling in Vyshhorod " , a city north of Kiev , while his brother Svyatopolk ruled as Prince of Novgorod , and Vladimir Monomakh ruled as Prince of Smolensk . After his uncle Vsevolod had become Grand Prince , Yaropolk was given Vladimir @-@ in @-@ Volhynia and Turov , while Monomakh received Chernigov . 
 Little is known for the following eight years , but by 1085 Vsevolod and Yaropolk are reported to have become entrenched against each other . The laconic account of these developments in the Primary Chronicle makes the course of events far from transparent . Vasilko and Vladimir Rostislavich , two <unk> @-@ based princes unhappy with territorial settlement under Vsevolod , were said to have attempted to expel Yaropolk in 1084 , but Grand Prince Vsevolod 's son Vladimir Monomakh drove these <unk> away . 
 Following this , a gift made by the Grand Prince to <unk> Igorevich , which included land in Volhynia and control of trade with the Byzantine Empire , is said to have made Yaropolk hostile to the Grand Prince . By 1085 Vsevolod and Yaropolk are reported to have become entrenched against each other , and Vsevolod ordered his son , Vladimir Monomakh to march against Yaropolk . Lacking confidence in his own resources , Yaropolk fled Volhynia to Poland , leaving his followers ( and mother ) at Lutsk . Vladimir captured Lutsk and Yaropolk 's family , attendants and treasure , and assigned his whole principality to <unk> Igorevich . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 In the following year Yaropolk returned and reportedly came to an agreement with Vladimir Monomakh , but nothing specific is known of the terms other than Yaropolk being reinstated . In 1087 , Yaropolk was murdered . The circumstances of his murder are not clear , but the Primary Chronicle suggested the complicity of Riurik Rostislavich , Prince of Peremyshl , and his brother Vasilko Rostislavich , Prince of <unk> . His murderer was a man called <unk> , who put a sword through Yaropolk before fleeing to hide with Riurik in Peremyshl ; the date given is November 22 , 1087 . His body was taken to Kiev and buried in the church of St Peter , the church which Yaropolk himself had endowed . 
 Yaropolk is said to have married to the German noble @-@ woman , Kunigunde , daughter of Otto , Margrave of Meissen . Whether by Kunigunde or not , Yaropolk had several children whose names have come into the record . A daughter Anastasia married her far relative Gleb <unk> , Prince of Minsk who was a member of the Polotsk branch of the Riurik 's family . The <unk> Saxo records another daughter , and that she married Günther , Count of Schwarzburg , though it does not mention her name . Three sons are known , namely , Yaroslav ( died 1102 ) , Viacheslav ( died 1104 ) and Vasilko . The fate of his descendants is as mysterious as his and only has some scarce records left . 
 Embedded in the Primary Chronicle is a eulogy to Prince Yaropolk , and among the honors assigned to him , is that he was in the habit of assigning a " tenth part of his wealth to the Mother of God " . Probably due to his personal devotion to the papacy and to St Peter , Yaropolk established a new church of St Peter at the monastery of St Demetrios in the city of Kiev . He was said to have left all his wealth to the Monastery of the Caves in Kiev . The Primary Chronicle 's eulogy is the first indication of saintly regard , and indeed today he is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church , with his feast day falling on the reported day of his death , November 22 .

 " Clown in the Dumps " is the season premiere of the twenty @-@ sixth season of the animated television series The Simpsons , and the <unk> episode of the series overall . It aired in the United States on Fox on September 28 , 2014 , with " The Simpsons Guy " , a crossover episode of Family Guy with The Simpsons , airing afterwards . This episode was dedicated in memory of Louis Castellaneta , the father of The Simpsons voice actor Dan Castellaneta . It was written by Joel H. Cohen and directed by Steven Dean Moore , with Don Hertzfeldt directing a sequence in the opening titles . Jeff Ross , Sarah Silverman and David Hyde Pierce guest starred as themselves , with Jackie Mason and Kelsey Grammer reprising their respective roles as Rabbi Krustofski and Sideshow Bob , while Maurice LaMarche voiced several minor characters . 
 In the episode , Krusty the Clown is offended by a comedy roast and asks his father , Rabbi Krustofski , if he believes that he is funny . His father disagrees and then dies , leaving Krusty upset that his father did not admire his work . After an alcohol @-@ induced coma , Krusty vows to do good in the world , and eventually with the help of Bart discovers that his father did enjoy his work . Meanwhile , due to the death of Krusty 's father , Lisa obsesses over the health and safety of her father Homer . 
 In October 2013 , during the promotion of the previous season of the show , executive producer Al Jean revealed that a character would die in this episode . In July 2014 , on the announcement of the title of the episode , several media outlets incorrectly presumed that Krusty would die . The choice of character to die was deemed by some critics as anti @-@ climactic due to Rabbi Krustofski 's minor role in the show , although other reviewers praised its conclusion to the relationship between Krusty and his father . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Krusty the Clown appears on a comedy roast by Jeff Ross and Sarah Silverman , and is offended by them . He seeks the advice of his father , Rabbi Krustofski , on whether he is funny ; the Rabbi says he always thought he was " eh ... " and dies suddenly , right before he 's about to tell Krusty what he really thinks of his comedy . As his father 's last words seemed to be dismissive , and believing that nobody finds him funny anymore , Krusty quits his show . 
 Bart attempts to <unk> Krusty by showing him old episodes of the show , but he picks up on the repetitive nature of his own jokes , and binge drinks in anger . He passes out and has a vision of himself in Jewish Heaven , where he meets Rodney Dangerfield . Rabbi Krustofski then appears and tells Krusty that Jews do not believe in Heaven , and thus he should do more to help others . An act of kindness does not seem to make him happier , but Bart takes Krusty to the synagogue , where Rabbi Krustofski 's favorite Rabbi recites Krusty 's jokes on religion . Krusty therefore deduces that his father did find him funny , and sees him again in Jewish Heaven , where Jesus turns Dangerfield 's water into a Bloody Mary . 
 Triggered by the death of Krusty 's father , Lisa becomes obsessed with protecting her own father , Homer , from getting hurt . She wraps him in bubble wrap , which ends up saving his life when Otto 's school bus plows into the garden . Eventually Marge and Bart talk some sense into Lisa , that while it is nice of her to be concerned for her father , she should not force Homer to take it easy on himself and just let him live his life . 
 = = Production = = 
 In October 2013 , in a conference to promote the 25th season of the show , producer Al Jean revealed that a major character would die in this episode . The character would have appeared more than twice in the show , and be voiced by an Emmy Award @-@ winning voice actor who won an Emmy for the role as the character . Later that month , following the death of Marcia Wallace , it was confirmed that it would not be her character , Edna Krabappel . Voice actor Hank Azaria , whose roles include Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and Moe Szyslak , stated that it would not be one of his characters . It was shown at the 2014 Comic @-@ Con that it would not be Homer , although there is a scene that features Lisa worrying about Homer 's health as he struggles with a CPAP mask . 
 In July 2014 , when Jean announced the title of the episode at the Television Critics Association summer tour , several news outlets suspected that Krusty the Clown would be killed off . Jean later told of his surprise at this theory , saying " I was like , ' What ? In the dumps doesn 't mean you 're dead . It means you 're sad . ' I thought it was so obvious . I would be nuts to kill Krusty . Everybody loves that character " . He said of the episode , " It turned out bigger than we thought it was going to be . It 's not going to be this blood bath where they all get murdered . " 
 Jean confirmed that the possibility was open for Jackie Mason to reprise his role as Rabbi Krustofski in dreams or flashbacks , and that Krusty would become a more generous character in the knowledge that his father admired his work . After the episode " Simpsorama " later on in the season , which implied that Ralph Wiggum would die in 2017 , Jean told Entertainment Weekly that he had " learned [ his ] lesson " from the death of Rabbi Krustofski , therefore there would be no more deaths in the series , apart from Jean 's announcement that Sideshow Bob would kill Bart in a " Treehouse of Horror XXVI " segment in 2015 . 
 In addition to Mason , the episode guest starred Jeff Ross and Sarah Silverman as themselves roasting Krusty . Maurice LaMarche voiced a television critic and the late Jewish comedian Rodney Dangerfield , who played Larry Burns in " Burns , Baby Burns " . Kelsey Grammer reprised his role as Sideshow Bob in a scene showing him arguing with his replacement on Krusty 's show , Sideshow Mel . David Hyde Pierce , who had previously appeared as Bob 's brother Cecil , had a cameo as himself acting in the role of Felix in The Odd Couple . 
 The episode 's couch gag was the work of Academy Award @-@ nominated surrealist animator Don Hertzfeldt , who was recommended to the show by Mike B. Anderson . It depicts Homer using a time @-@ traveling remote control to regress to his original 1987 character model , then accidentally going into a distant future incarnation of the show called The <unk> where he and his family have evolved into grotesque , mindless , catchphrase @-@ spouting mutants . Jean deemed it " crazier than we thought " and " the most insane one we 've ever done " .

 The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 28 , 2014 , as the premiere of the twenty @-@ sixth season of The Simpsons . It was watched by approximately 8 @.@ 53 million people during this broadcast . It received a 3 @.@ 9 Nielsen rating in the demographic for adults aged 18 – 49 ( up thirty @-@ four percent from the last season 's premiere ) , and an eleven percent share . The Simpsons became the second highest @-@ rated program in the 18 – 49 demographic on Fox that night , finishing with a higher rating than Brooklyn Nine @-@ Nine but a lower rating than the Family Guy episode " The Simpsons Guy " , a special hour @-@ long crossover episode with The Simpsons . The Simpsons was , however , the most @-@ watched show in the lineup in terms of total viewers . 
 The episode polarized critical opinions . Carey <unk> of CNN wrote that 
 Instead of dropping the mic and resting on its collective laurels , [ The Simpsons ] kicked off season 26 with a staggering , Don Hertzfeldt directed intro sequence and then went on to prove that , in a world where shows can flame out after just a few episodes , ' The Simpsons ' , which premiered in 1989 still has plenty of jokes left in their comedic arsenal . 
 Time wrote " If ' Clown in the Dumps ' is not a classic on the level of season three 's ' Like Father , Like Clown ' , it was still a fitting , sweet conclusion to the story of Hyman and Herschel " . TV Fanatic gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars , writing " Simpsons Season 26 starts off with a bang , with plenty of laughs and even a few sentimental moments " . Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 4 stars out of 5 , commenting 
 <unk> in the Dumps ' may not be considered a classic episode now , but after a few years when we watch it again on syndication , probably next year on FXX , it will grow in stature . It is a heartfelt episode that does bring on the laughs . The sadness of the episode to me was Jackie Mason 's voice , which sounds very tired . 
 Paste gave the episode a rating of 7 @.@ 1 , concluding 
 These days , The Simpsons can be hit or miss , and there was nothing to guarantee success from ' Clown in the Dumps ' . However , even if the character death was perfunctory , and Rabbi Krustofski has made only a handful of appearances in over 550 episodes , it was still a funny , solid half hour of television . Nothing special — really , it was just another Krusty episode , and not the best Krusty episode . Nevertheless , the 26th season of The Simpsons has started out on somewhat of a high note . The good times keep on rolling for Matt Groening 's deathless creation . 
 The A.V. Club gave the episode a C , commenting " Fresh off a summer of <unk> , thanks to the phenomenally successful FXX marathon of every episode ever , The Simpsons returns for its 26th season with a nondescript , anti @-@ climactic premiere whose overstuffed cameos and would @-@ be big character death amount to little more than a <unk> confirmation that its best days are , indeed , long gone . " IGN rated the episode 5 @.@ 8 , concluding " Between an anticlimactic death and a redundant conflict , The Simpsons didn 't start Season 26 off on the right foot " . 
 Executive producer Al Jean responded that the episode had been over @-@ hyped , and that a quote attributed to him he never made : he said that he was quoted as saying that an " iconic " character would die , when in actuality , he said a " beloved " character would die .

 Chicago Options Associates is a finance company incorporated in Chicago , Illinois which specializes in trading options and futures contracts . It was founded in 1987 by Michael E.

The company originally had offices in Chicago and Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .

 = = = Dowling v Chicago Options Associates , Inc = = = 
 In 2007 , the company was the subject of a decision in a lawsuit before the Illinois Supreme Court when a creditor argued that it was owed monies from the defendants after judgments were obtained against them . The court ruled against the creditor and in favor of the law firm , stating that the retainer owed to the firm took precedence . In Dowling v Chicago Options Associates , Inc , the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that preemptive retainers used by attorneys were acceptable arrangements with clients . 
 The original case was between plaintiff Brian Dowling and defendants Chicago Options Associates and Michael E. Davis , in which Dowling won a judgement of $ 817 @,@ 830 @.@ 45 from the defendants . After the court entered its judgement against him , Davis then tried to shield his assets from the plaintiff using his attorney @-@ client relationship with the law firm of DLA Piper to assist him in buying a home in Florida . As part of this arrangement , Davis transferred funds into a trust account controlled by DLA Piper . At that time , as stated in the contract between DLA Piper and Davis , the law firm was allocated $ 100 @,@ 000 of those funds as its retainer ; the funds were used to pay day @-@ to @-@ day company expenses . 
 When Dowling 's attorneys learned about the retainer to DLA Piper they asked the court to order the return of the retainer to the plaintiff , and the circuit court ruled in favor of Dowling . On appeal , the decision was upheld . The Illinois Supreme Court reversed the circuit @-@ court decision , ruling that the retainer was the property of DLA Piper and not Dowling . 
 Both the Illinois State Bar Association and Chicago Bar Association filed amicus curiae briefs in the case favoring the law firm 's position . The case dealt with the concept of an advance payment retainer , a fee given to an attorney for later services to a client . An advance payment retainer became part of an attorney 's assets as soon as it was paid , regardless of subsequent events . More common types of retainer defined by the court included the classic retainer ( also known as a true retainer ) and the security retainer . A classic retainer was described by the court as one used in an attorney @-@ client relationship for a set length of time or a particular purpose . A security retainer referred to a deposit kept in a trust account by the attorney , distinct from their own assets . The case was the first recognition of advance payment retainers in Illinois . 
 The case became a parameter for defining retainers in Illinois . The Illinois Bar Journal observed in 2009 , " The starting point for any discussion of getting paid for work in the private practice of law is retainer fees . In Dowling v Chicago Options Associates , Inc ... the supreme court identified three types of lawyer retainer fees that are permissible in this state ... " and referred to the legal descriptions as " Dowling fee classifications " . 
 On July 1 , 2009 , the Illinois Supreme Court codified the definitions set forth in the case as a rule applicable to the practice of law in the state ; known as Rule 1 @.@ 15 ( c ) , it came into practice on January 1 , 2010 . The Illinois Bar Journal noted , " Paragraph ( c ) of the rule reflects the recent supreme court decision in Dowling v Chicago Options Associates , Inc ( 4 ) and describes in detail the so @-@ called advance payment retainer recognized in Dowling .

 DE 71 was built as a state highway during the 1920s and 1930s . By 1938 , the route was designated to run from US 13 south of Townsend to US 13 in Tybouts Corner roughly along its present @-@ day alignment . In the 1950s , DE 71 was rerouted to head to the Maryland border southwest of Middletown to connect to Maryland Route 71 ( MD 71 ) , with the former route south of Middletown becoming an extended DE 896 . Between the 1950s and 1980s , DE 71 was signed with various alignments of US 301 and US 301S . In the 1980s , DE 71 was truncated to DE 896 in Summit Bridge before being extended back along its 1930s alignment to US 13 by the 1990s .

 DE 71 heads to the northwest from US 13 on two @-@ lane undivided Summit Bridge Road , passing through wooded areas with some homes . The road passes to the east of Townsend and <unk> Pine Tree Road / Main Street . Past Townsend , the route continues northwest into farmland , making a turn to the north . DE 71 enters residential areas as it heads into the town of Middletown , where it becomes Broad Street . The road heads north through the town and intersects DE 299 ( Main Street ) in the downtown area . From this point , the route passes more homes before running near businesses . DE 71 crosses Norfolk Southern 's Delmarva Secondary at @-@ grade and intersects US 301 immediately after . 
 DE 71 heads north concurrent with US 301 on Summit Bridge Road , leaving Middletown . The road runs a short distance to the west of the Norfolk Southern rail line as it continues through farmland with some scattered residential and commercial development . In Mount Pleasant , DE 896 joins US 301 / DE 71 from the east and the road widens from a two @-@ lane undivided road to a four @-@ lane , divided highway . The road heads between the Summit Airport to the west and housing developments to the east . US 301 / DE 71 / DE 896 heads to the northwest through farm fields before turning to the west and passing a residential subdivision to the south . In the unincorporated community of Summit Bridge , the road intersects the northern terminus of DE 15 . Past this intersection , US 301 / DE 71 / DE 896 turns north and crosses over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal on the Summit Bridge . 
 Past the Summit Bridge , the road runs through woods and passes under Chesapeake City Road near the Delaware Veterans Memorial Cemetery . DE 71 splits from US 301 / DE 896 by heading to the southeast on two @-@ lane undivided Red Lion Road . The road passes a mix of woods and homes as it becomes the southern boundary of Lums Pond State Park and turns east . The route turns northeast and continues into a mix of farmland and homes . DE 71 passes through the community of Kirkwood and crosses the Norfolk Southern Delmarva Secondary again , continuing past suburban residential development and crossing DE 72 . The route continues northeast , crossing Norfolk Southern 's Reybold Running Track . From here , the road runs to the community of Red Lion , where it crosses DE 7 . The final stretch of DE 71 heads northeast toward its northern terminus at US 13 in Tybouts Corner . This intersection is within an interchange between US 13 and DE 1 , where DE 1 merges off US 13 . Direct access is provided from southbound DE 1 to DE 71 just before the intersection with US 13 . 
 The portion of the route between Main Street in Townsend and <unk> Road south of Middletown is part of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad Byway , a Delaware Byway . DE 71 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 24 @,@ 445 vehicles at the DE 896 intersection in Mount Pleasant to a low of 4 @,@ 351 vehicles at the DE 7 intersection . The portion of DE 71 concurrent with US 301 is part of the National Highway System . 
 = = History = = 
 What is now DE 71 originally existed as a county road by 1920 , with the portion south of Townsend proposed as a state highway at this time . By 1924 , the entire length of the present route was paved , with the portion from the Summit Bridge to Kirkwood proposed as a state highway and the portion from Kirkwood to Tybouts Corner improved to a state highway . A year later , the state highway had been completed south of Townsend and between Mt . Pleasant and Kirkwood . In 1930 , the state highway between Middletown and Mt . Pleasant was finished . By 1931 , the remainder became a state highway . When Delaware started numbering state highways by 1936 , this road remained unnumbered . By 1938 , DE 71 was designated to run from US 13 south of Townsend north to US 13 in Tybouts Corner , following roughly the same alignment it does today . 
 By 1957 , DE 71 was rerouted to follow DE 299 southwest from Middletown before splitting from that route and reaching the Maryland border , where it connected to MD 71 . Also , DE 896 was extended south from Summit Bridge to follow DE 71 to Middletown and then continue along the former DE 71 through Townsend to US 13 . By 1959 , US 301 was designated along DE 71 / DE 299 between the Maryland border and Middletown and US 301S was designated along DE 71 from Middletown to Tybouts Corner . The route was realigned to a new Summit Bridge a short distance to the west in 1960 , following new roads that led to the bridge . As a result of this , US 301S / DE 71 was designated onto a former piece of DE 896 between the new alignment and Red Lion Road to the east , with the rest of the former alignment becoming a dead end road south to the canal and the former alignment south of the canal becoming a local road serving the community of Summit . 
 In 1971 , US 301 was shifted to follow what had been US 301S between Middletown and Summit Bridge , with US 301S remaining along DE 71 between Summit Bridge and Tybouts Corner . By 1984 , DE 896 was rerouted to run from Mount Pleasant to Boyds Corner , with the route being removed from DE 71 from Mt . Pleasant to Middletown and the segment from Middletown to south of Townsend , which was the original routing of DE 71 , becoming unnumbered . A year later , US 301 was rerouted onto the newly aligned DE 896 and US 13 between Mt . Pleasant and Tybouts Corner and removed from DE 71 / DE 896 from Summit Bridge to Mt . Pleasant . DE 71 was truncated to Summit Bridge by 1987 . By 1990 , DE 71 was extended back south along its original alignment to again end at US 13 south of Townsend . US 301 was realigned to follow the route between Mt . Pleasant and Summit Bridge in 1992 .

 = La Couchette = 
 " La Couchette " is the first episode of the second series of British dark comedy anthology Inside No. 9 . Written by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith and directed by Guillem Morales , the episode is set in a sleeper carriage on a French train . English doctor Maxwell , who is traveling to an important job interview , climbs into bed . He is disturbed first by drunk , flatulent German Jorg , and then by English couple Kath and Les . Later , while the others sleep , Australian backpacker Shona brings posh English backpacker Hugo back to the cabin , but the pair make a surprising discovery . The episode stars Pemberton , Shearsmith , Julie Hesmondhalgh , Mark Benton , Jessica Gunning , Jack Whitehall and George Glaves . 
 The story was inspired by the intimacy of sleeper carriages , in which people aim to sleep in close proximity to strangers . " La Couchette " draws upon the literary tropes associated with stories , such as Murder on the Orient Express and Strangers on a Train , following characters unknown to one another while traveling . The various characters — played by actors somewhat typecast — correspond to British comedy archetypes , and much of the episode 's story and humour derives from the characters ' <unk> . Critics responded positively to " La Couchette " , commending the cast and script , but noted that Inside No. 9 is something of an acquired taste . On its first showing , the episode was watched by 1 @.@ 1 million viewers ( 6 @.@ 1 % of the audience ) . 
 = = Production and development = = 
 The second series of Inside No. 9 was written in 2014 , and then filmed from the end of 2014 into early 2015 . As each episode features new characters , the writers were able to attract actors who might have been unwilling to commit to an entire series . Jack Whitehall , who was a fan of the show , says that he " may or may not have nagged Reece and Steve to find a Jack Whitehall @-@ shaped hole in the second series " , and was " very thankful " when they did . In addition to Pemberton , Shearsmith and Whitehall , " La Couchette " stars Julie Hesmondhalgh , Mark Benton , Jessica Gunning and George Glaves . Hesmondhalgh commended the cast , saying that , for her , it was a " no brainer " to appear in the episode . For Whitehall , working with Hesmondhalgh was " very exciting , but also quite weird " , given the recent suicide of Hesmondhalgh 's Coronation Street character , Hayley Cropper . Whitehall called Benton and Hesmondhalgh " an amazing little double act " . The pair had previously played a husband and wife on the radio . 
 " La Couchette " follows six characters on a sleeper carriage travelling from Paris to Bourg St. Maurice . Shearsmith said that the writers aimed to exploit the intimacy of the setting ; the unusual situation which is created by trying to sleep in what is potentially a room full of strangers . This was , for Shearsmith , an " odd frisson " to play with . Discussing the filming , Whitehall said that the set was " definitely the most intimate location I have ever been on ... It 's all on springs so it moves around like a train carriage – and I suffer from very bad motion sickness so on the first day I threw up . I had to literally run off the set half way through a scene and throw up in the loo . So it was quite an auspicious start . " Hesmondhalgh also commented on the intimacy of the filming , saying that it was the tightest location used for Inside No. 9 since " Sardines " , the first episode of the first series . Nonetheless , she had " such a fun week " filming the episode , noting that , despite the limited space on @-@ set , it is " amazing how quickly you become institutionalised " . Similarly , Pemberton noted that the filming resulted in " a tough week " , but that it was " really fun , because it 's a very fun episode " . 
 Prior to filming , director Guillem Morales worked hard on a story board . For Shearsmith , the small space added to the need to meticulously plan the production process ; he explained that every shot was worked out in advance . The set , which was situated in Twickenham Studios for the filming , was shaken manually by an assistant director to create the effect of motion ; something which surprised Hesmondhalgh . The production crew filmed the episode by removing walls from the " carriage " one at a time , and shooting from the various angles , meaning that they had to effectively dismantle and reassemble the set five times . Benton noted that the tight space created a challenge for the camera crews , but , for the actors , it was " great " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 English doctor Maxwell ( Shearsmith ) settles into bunk 9E while traveling from Paris to Bourg @-@ Saint @-@ Maurice . Maxwell is disturbed first by Jorg ( Pemberton ) , a drunk , flatulent German who climbs into bunk 9D , then by Kath ( Hesmondhalgh ) and Les ( Benton ) , a couple traveling to their daughter 's wedding . Jorg is in Les 's bed , but the couple climb into 9A . Australian backpacker Shona ( Gunning ) enters ; she places her bag on bunk 9C then leaves , and Maxwell closes the door . Kath and Les , laughing at Maxwell , begin to undress on the bed . Les wakes Jorg , but understanding is limited until Maxwell translates . Jorg switches to <unk> and Les climbs into 9D . 
 Hours later , Shona re @-@ enters the room with English <unk> Hugo ( Whitehall ) . The pair sit on 9C and share a can of Carling while swapping travel stories . Hugo says he would rather stay in this carriage than in first class , and the pair begin foreplay . A face appears from 9B , and a man ( Glaves ) falls to the floor . The carriage 's inhabitants wake ; Maxwell confirms that the man is dead , then leaves to look for a guard . Jorg finds a family photo in the man 's pocket . Maxwell returns alone , and Jorg suggests they use the emergency stop button ; Les prepares to smash the glass . Hugo stops him , confessing he is ticketless , Maxwell says he has an interview with the WHO in the morning , and Les , to Kath 's annoyance , confesses that he does not want to risk missing the wedding . Maxwell explains the situation to Jorg , Les and Kath argue , and Shona refuses to let Hugo back into her bunk . Maxwell gives Jorg some tablets for his constipation , after which Shona offers a eulogy . The body is placed into 9B , and Hugo climbs into the same bunk . The passengers settle , but Kath lies sleepless . 
 After dawn , Les accidentally wakes Maxwell , but sees that Kath is absent . The train brakes , waking everyone , and Hugo and the corpse fall to the floor . Maxwell guesses that Kath has stopped the train as Jorg stands , dropping his trousers . Maxwell next guesses that Kath has jumped in front of the train , and Les repeatedly hits him with a pillow as Jorg defecates into Kath 's shoebox , which is held by Hugo . Shona sees that the train has hit a deer , and Kath re @-@ enters . 
 Later , Maxwell is dressed , and Hugo enters , wearing one of Shona 's T @-@ shirts . He says that Jorg is cleaning himself . Kath and Les talk ; the former feels remorse , and insists they attend the dead man 's funeral . Shona and Hugo leave the carriage ; they intend to go " exploring " . Maxwell says his goodbyes to Kath and Les , then , alone , receives a call from his driver , who is waiting for him and Dr. Meier . Maxwell turns to the body and says he is " terribly sorry " , but there can only be " one candidate " . As he says Meier 's name , Jorg , now smartly dressed , answers . Jorg explains that he is Dr. Meier , and that he is traveling to an interview . As Jorg leaves the carriage , Maxwell looks at the corpse in silence .

 " La Couchette " , like " Sardines " — the first episode of the previous series — introduces characters gradually , and explores " man 's capacity to behave idiotically within a confined space to creepy and comic effect " . The sleeper carriage setting is , like the wardrobe of " Sardines " , a claustrophobic environment into which the various characters are forced . For comedy critic Bruce Dessau , though the setup was similar , " La Couchette " was " maybe more comic , less sinister , but the denouement is no less nightmare @-@ inducing " . 
 The sleeper carriage setting gave Shearsmith and Pemberton a number of " traumatic " elements to exploit , such as claustrophobia , proximity to strangers , motion , and the various elements associated with settling down to sleep , such as flatulence and getting undressed . These characteristics led to elements typical of Pemberton and Shearsmith 's work — characteristics of what The Guardian critic Sam Wollaston calls " Shearsmith <unk> " — including " macabre horror , stiff @-@ handling , cadaver <unk> " and multiple twists . Commentators stressed how the characters are generally not particularly likable people , and one critic observed that the actors are somewhat typecast ; " Hesmondhalgh was frumpy but compassionate , while Whitehall played yet another clueless , posh student " . The characters are mostly archetypes of British comedy — such as " the rude German traveller " and " the British snob " — and the norms of these archetypes are used for both humour and to advance the plot . The archetypes are gradually <unk> ; for instance , the apparently well @-@ meaning Les is revealed as somewhat xenophobic . The discovery of the body reveals the humanity of the various characters . For instance , Jorg is revealed to be more ill than vulgar , and Hugo is shown to be poor . Maxwell 's character , by contrast , is not subverted . 
 Maxwell , as a character , " controls the action " . He is the protagonist , and traps the viewer into the coach in the opening seconds of the episode by closing the curtains . This is a reversal of the way that , in the theatre , the opening of curtains brings the viewer into the story . As the translator , he acts as the only link between Jorg and the other characters ; furthermore , as the episode does not have subtitles , he acts as the link between Jorg and Anglophone viewers . Revelations about the character are seeded in a different way to other characters . His profession and supply of medication bring to mind " upper @-@ class gentleman serial killers " or " cut @-@ glass accented British actors brought in to play cold killers in Hollywood cinema " . The revelation that Maxwell is a murderer is " a satisfying payoff for those who 've figured it out " , but in the final twist — Jorg 's identity — control is taken from Maxwell and , therefore , the audience . 
 Euan Ferguson identified Roald Dahl and Hitchcock as clear influences , and Ellen E Jones , writing in The Independent , saw a Hitchcockian element in addition to Inside No. 9 's usual gothic horror influences . Wollaston described the episode as a mix of Dahl 's Tales of the Unexpected , Agatha Christie 's Murder on the Orient Express and Chris Donald 's Viz . Dessau compared the episode 's scenario to " one of those old Peter Cushing portmanteau horror yarns " . Phoebe Jane @-@ Boyd , writing for entertainment website Den of Geek , identified Murder on the Orient Express , Hitchcock 's Strangers on a Train and John Hughes 's Planes , Trains and Automobiles as plot influences . The writers , she claimed , were able to utilise and subvert viewer expectations of the " strangers on a train " plot tropes , including bad manners , suspense and potential murder . 
 Christopher Stevens , who reviewed " La Couchette " alongside Cameron & Miliband : The Battle for Number 10 in the Daily Mail , speculated that there may have been a degree of political satire in episode . He noted that Inside No. 9 storylines " were never meant to be topical satires , but we 're so steeped in electioneering that everything is starting to look like political comment now " . He compared the character of Hugo , a " public school chancer ... with a breezy nonchalance and an answer for everything " , to David Cameron , and the character of Maxwell , " the uptight little man with the funny voice ... who had committed murder to win his comfy berth and was now beginning to wonder if he ’ d made a mistake " , to Ed Miliband . Stevens claimed that Inside No. 9 " is bizarre enough for any interpretation " . 
 = = Reception = = 
 " La Couchette " was well received by television critics , and was awarded four out of five stars by Gabriel Tate ( The Daily Telegraph ) , Andrew Billen ( The Times ) and Christopher Stevens ( Daily Mail ) . It was described as " beautifully , beautifully dark , and guiltily funny " by Euan Ferguson , writing in The Guardian , as " a delight " by Billen and as " a tightly worked farce " by Gerard Gilbert of The Independent . For Paddy Shennan of the Liverpool Echo , the episode was " typically inventive and inspired " . Boyd felt that the episode was " a really clever opening to the series , and a solid start to another run of surprises from Inside No. 9 " . 
 Jonathan Wright , writing in The Guardian , commended the script of " La Couchette " , calling it " a delight , with one line delivered by Jack Whitehall quite possibly the most gloriously tasteless you 'll hear on television all year " . Ferguson offered a similar view , saying that Whitehall delivered " seriously <unk> lines with entirely believable gusto " . Tate said that though he found the revelation at the end of the episode fairly predictable , the " writing and performances were so engaging that it hardly mattered " . The episode was , for him , " inventive " and " deliciously wicked " . Similarly , though Billen considered the setting fairly unoriginal and the characters stereotypical , he said that the writers " scored a laugh every few seconds and then a home run with a savage resolution " . Patrick Mulkern , writing for Radio Times , described " La Couchette " as " hilarious " and " sharply observed " . He commended the cast , saying that Pemberton and Shearsmith " give a mini @-@ masterclass " in their performances . Jones called the episode " toilet humour with a twist " , saying that " It was Jorg 's grunting and squatting that produced the episode 's impressively grotesque climax , but it was Whitehall as Hugo who followed up with the instantly quotable line : ' We 're going to need a bigger box ! ' " Billen commended the cast , and Christine Brandel , writing for entertainment website PopMatters , described Gunning as one of the stand @-@ out guest stars of the second series . 
 In the course of his review of " La Couchette " , Stevens suggested that Inside No. 9 is something of an acquired taste . He noted , though , that " even if they don ’ t make you laugh , you have to concede this duo are the most <unk> inventive writers on TV . " Wollaston , who reviewed the episode for The Guardian , observed that humour generally is extremely personal , and said that he " never really got Shearsmith and Pemberton 's stuff " . He said he could appreciate the narrative and artistry of " La Couchette " , and could understand why others found it funny , but that he does not love Inside No. 9 , and that , when watching , he is " just not laughing " . A viewer unimpressed with the episode wrote to The Times . Disagreeing with Billen 's review , the reader claimed that the episode 's " puerile humour [ was as ] flatulent as its one @-@ dimensional figures " . 
 " La Couchette " was watched by 1 @.@ 1 million viewers , which was 6 @.@ 1 % of the audience . This was slightly higher than " Sardines " , the first episode of the first series , which was watched by 1 @.@ 05 million ( 5 @.@ 7 % of the audience ) .

 " The Abducted " is the seventh episode of the third season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe . The third season spent much of its time alternating between the prime and parallel universes , and " The Abducted " was set in the latter . The episode followed the Fringe team 's investigation of " the Candyman " , a man who kidnaps children to harvest their youth @-@ giving hormones . 
 The episode first aired on November 18 , 2010 in the United States to an estimated 4 @.@ 85 million viewers . Reviews of the episode were mixed ; multiple critics lauded the final five minutes of the episode , while another praised lead actress Anna Torv and actor Lance Reddick 's performances . Due to the holiday of Thanksgiving , " The Abducted " began a two @-@ week break that did not end until the broadcast of a December 2 episode . 
 = = Plot = = 
 " The Abducted " takes place in the parallel universe ; Olivia ( Anna Torv ) , having broken her conditioning that made her believe she was her doppelgänger Fauxlivia ( Torv ) from that universe , maintains the pretense that she is still conditioned . She meets with Henry ( Andre Royo ) , the taxi driver who helped her out before , and asks him to help her return to Liberty Island to use the sensory deprivation tank to return herself to her universe . 
 A child , Max ( Michael <unk> ) , is kidnapped from his home . The Fringe team investigates and Broyles ( Lance Reddick ) immediately recognizes this as the work of " The Candyman " ; though only appearing once every two years , the Candyman abducts a child and returns him some days later , but whatever the Candyman has done leaves the child physically deprived . Broyles ' own son , Christopher ( Curtis Harris ) , was one of the most recent victims , having become blind as a result of the ordeal . Christopher tells Olivia that he believes there were two people involved with his abduction , one old and one young . Combined with other information , Olivia suspects that the Candyman is draining the children of hormones from the pituitary gland , helping the Candyman stay young . 
 The interview leads Olivia and Broyles to Reverend Marcus ( David Nykl ) , who gave up a career as a physician in order to establish a local church . Working through the congregation list , Olivia talks to one member , Wyatt <unk> ( Will <unk> ) , a <unk> . When Olivia spots a child 's toy within his apartment , Wyatt realizes he is caught and attempts to escape , but Olivia captures him . She soon finds Max in a hidden room with a not @-@ yet @-@ activated device on the back of his head near the pituitary gland . She frees the boy , accidentally telling him she is an FBI agent . 
 Believing the case completed , Olivia goes to meet with Henry , where he has gotten use of his cousin 's boat . As he talks about having been trained to use it , Olivia contemplates how Wyatt knew about the chemistry to make the serum , and realizes he had a teacher as well - their true culprit , and immediately suspects Reverend Marcus . Broyles and Olivia hurry to his house to protect Christopher from Marcus ; Broyles kills Marcus . Olivia accompanies Broyles and his family to the same hospital that Max is being treated . There , Max thanks Olivia personally and asks her about what the " FBI " is . Broyles , having listened to Olivia 's conversation , knows that she has broken her conditioning , as the FBI had ceased to exist years earlier in the parallel universe . Because of her efforts to save Christopher , he lets her go . 
 Olivia rejoins Henry and then leaves him to swim the rest of the way in and make her way to the isolation tank . After injecting herself with the same drugs Walternate ( John Noble ) had used on her , she enters the tank and soon finds herself back in her own universe . She encounters a cleaning lady , and as Olivia feels herself being dragged back to the parallel universe , she gives the cleaning lady a message to pass along to Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) . Back in the isolation tank , Walternate has had Olivia extracted from the tank and directs his agents to lock her up and sedate her . 
 Back in the prime universe , Peter and Fauxlivia are in bed together when Peter receives a call from the cleaning lady , who relays the message : that Olivia is trapped in the parallel universe . Peter realizes that he has been sleeping with Olivia 's doppelgänger .

 " The Abducted " was written by co @-@ executive producer David Wilcox and executive story editor Graham Roland , and directed by filmmaker Chuck Russell . The episode featured guest appearances by Curtis Harris , David Nykl , John Hainsworth , Karen Holness , Andre Royo , Will <unk> , <unk> Leffler , and Michael <unk> . Holness and Royo had previously guest starred on Fringe before as the characters Diane Broyles and Henry Higgins , respectively . 
 Alluding to the normally " no @-@ nonsense " personality of his character Phillip Broyles , actor Lance Reddick noted that for once " you get to see [ Broyles ] smile and have fun . Not for very long , but you see it . You get to meet his ex @-@ wife ( Karen Holness ) and find out why his marriage ended . You understand more about his relationship to his work and his job and the Fringe Division – how he feels about it and why he does what he does . " 
 Reddick drew inspiration for the episode from undercover FBI agent Joe Pistone , whom he met while filming the TV series Falcone . Pistone recommended his autobiography Donnie Brasco : My Undercover Life in the Mafia , and Reddick found many parallels to it and the episode . " In the book , [ Pistone ] talked about how while being undercover in the Mafia , he had to separate his personal feelings from his professional and moral sense of responsibility . There were certain guys he really couldn ’ t stand , but there were some people he genuinely liked , even though ultimately he had to bring them down . I think Col. Broyles feels the same way about Olivia . On various occasions , she has performed heroically to earn his respect , and in tonight ’ s episode , that appreciation — and the angst that goes with it — reaches a new level " . 
 As with other Fringe episodes , Fox released a science lesson plan in collaboration with Science Olympiad for grade school children , focusing on the science seen in " The Abducted " , with the intention of having " students learn about vaccination and the spread of communicable diseases . "

SFScope 's Sarah Stegall believed that the episode antagonist 's name of <unk> was a reference to popular villain Eugene Victor Tooms in the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files .

 Los Angeles Times columnist Andrew Hanson thought the whole episode was " disturbing , even for Fringe " , and was pleased that the killers were shot rather than arrested due to the <unk> of their crimes . SFScope contributor Sarah Stegall believed the episode contained some of the cast 's best performances , especially praising Lance Reddick 's portrayal of a " very human , caring hero who has been damaged but not crippled by the tragedy that struck his family " and Anna Torv 's ability to subtly play both Olivias . IGN 's Phil <unk> believed " the Broyles Factor padded a cool premise with a solid ( if unremarkable ) execution that lead to a great final five minutes . " In January 2013 , IGN ranked it the eighth best episode of the entire series , explaining that " this one holds a special place for having so many elements of what makes Fringe great ... There 's only one word for the way this episode handled two awesome storylines and intertwined them seamlessly : brilliant . "

 All Hands on the Bad One is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Sleater @-@ Kinney , released on May 2 , 2000 by Kill Rock Stars . The album was produced by John Goodmanson and recorded from December 1999 to January 2000 at Jackpot ! Studio in Portland , Oregon and John & Stu 's Place in Seattle , Washington . The music on the record ranges from soft melodies to fast punk rock guitar work , while the lyrics address multiple media issues , such as the image of women in rock , music journalism , and violence as entertainment , among others . 
 Upon release , All Hands on the Bad One reached number 177 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart and number 12 on the Heatseekers Albums chart . One song from the album , " You 're No Rock n ' Roll Fun " , was released as a single . The album received positive reviews from critics , with an aggregate review score of 86 out of 100 at Metacritic . Critics generally praised the album 's consistency and Corin Tucker 's vocals . All Hands on the Bad One appeared in several end @-@ of @-@ year lists and received a nomination for Outstanding Music Album at the 12th Annual Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation Awards .

 All Hands on the Bad One is the follow @-@ up to Sleater @-@ Kinney 's highly acclaimed fourth album The Hot Rock , released in 1999 . The Hot Rock marked a considerable change in the band 's sound , veering into a more relaxed and gloomy direction than the raucous punk rock style of its predecessors . It was also the first Sleater @-@ Kinney album that entered the US Billboard Top 200 chart , peaking at number 181 . Some fans , however , dismissed the album , claiming that the band had sold out and that it was a commercial album . This criticism was something that singer and guitarist Corin Tucker strongly disagreed with , claiming that The Hot Rock was their least commercial album due to its longer and intricate pieces . According to Tucker , " we wanted to be doing difficult work . We wanted to be expanding as musicians and people didn 't want that from us . They wanted us to jump around and yell . " 
 After expanding their musical boundaries with The Hot Rock , the band decided not to worry about what their next album was going to sound like . Tucker explained , " It was so spontaneous [ ... ] The songs just kept popping up one after another . We didn 't really talk about anything . It just kind of happened . " She also said that they wanted to write songs that were " really straightforward but also a bit more mature in their structure and delivery than [ their ] earlier songs . " All Hands on the Bad One is also the first Sleater @-@ Kinney album where drummer Janet Weiss provides backing vocals on some tracks . Tucker remarked that they initially wanted her to sing on The Hot Rock , but the idea was ultimately rejected due to the album 's complex melodies . All Hands on the Bad One was produced by John Goodmanson , who previously produced the band 's third studio album , Dig Me Out . The band decided to work with him again because , according to Weiss , Goodmanson " has the incredible ability of capturing our live sound and heightening it , so we sound better " . The album was recorded from December 1999 to January 2000 at Jackpot ! Studio in Portland , Oregon and John & Stu 's Place in Seattle , Washington . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 Similar to other Sleater @-@ Kinney albums , the lyrics of All hands on the Bad One feature personal , political , and social themes . The first song , " The Ballad of the Ladyman " , is a deliberate attempt to mock those who misunderstand the band . Tucker said that the song is " almost making fun of how people see us , how people see what you 're supposed to be when you 're a woman in rock . " The song was inspired when the band was invited to the <unk> Weekender music festival in England in 1999 . Tucker explained , " We were all staying in little chalets or whatever and we had our own cabin and we were cabin 216 . Someone wrote this message to us that was like , ' Cabin 216 <unk> . ' And we were like , ' What ? ' It was meant to be a funny thing , but in this other way , it was really this naming of us . It was a subtle way of saying , ' Oh , you 're different because you 're a woman band and because you 're in some ways political . ' It 's still seen as threatening to people . It 's not like we had this weekend where we just relaxed with everyone and just hung out . " Kat <unk> , writing for PopMatters , stated that the song " sports sweet harmonies , a slow anger and soft , low bitterness , and driving steady guitars and drums . " 
 The song " Male Model " targets the male role models for female rock bands , while " Pompeii " explores soul @-@ searching themes such as one 's losses and anxieties . " Youth Decay " was described by PopMatters as a song that " grapples with adult disbelief of the problems of youth and the manifestations of it in terms of eating disorders and silence . " It features fast punk rock guitar work . The lyrics to " # 1 Must @-@ Have " reference images of the riot grrrl scene in the mainstream media . It was written when Tucker was preparing for an interview about the subject , held by the EMP Museum in Olympia , Washington . The song also alludes to the misogyny that took place at the Woodstock music festival in 1999 , where several women were raped . Similarly , the song " Was It a Lie ? " is a protest against how violence is used as entertainment in the media . " The Professional " aims at music journalism and contains heavy drum work , while " Ironclad " features " fuzzed @-@ out riffs and pounding fills " . Other songs such as " Leave You Behind " and " The Swimmer " feature soft melodies and harmonies . " You 're No Rock n ' Roll Fun " was described as " easy moving , beach punk rock music " . " Milkshake n ' Honey " was considered to be the band 's funkiest song . Pitchfork Media commented that the song " spits wit at expatriates in Paris as Corin rolls her eyes at the type of denizens in The Sun Also Rises . " 
 The song " All Hands on the Bad One " features guitar riffs that are reminiscent of the band 's second album , Call the Doctor . It was chosen as the title track because , according to guitarist Carrie Brownstein , it is the song that best represents the sentiment of the album . Brownstein explained that the song deals with " your relationship to evil and your relationship to the hypocrisy of forcing a morality on someone else when you yourself are no better . " She added , " ' Ballad of the Ladyman ' , for instance — who is ' the <unk> ' ? Is the person that wants to be on the radio , ' the bad one , ' or is it the fans assuming that they [ the artist ] want to be on the radio — are they ' the bad one ' ? Or is ' The Professional , ' the ominous professional figure , ' the bad one ' ? I think all these songs can go into that machine of ' the bad one ' and that mentality and then be spit out in a bunch of different scenarios . So that 's why I think it works as the title . "

 All Hands on the Bad One was released on May 2 , 2000 by the independent record label Kill Rock Stars , which also released the band 's previous two albums . The album cover features a photo of Brownstein being hauled off a dance floor . According to Weiss , " She worked herself into a frenzy and passed out . People are laughing in the background because she 's wearing a bunny suit . " All Hands on the Bad One reached number 177 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart , # 12 on the Heatseekers Albums chart , and # 5 on the KEXP Top 90 @.@ 3 Album Chart for 2000 .

 All Hands on the Bad One received very positive reviews from critics .

 Further praise was given to Tucker 's voice . Pitchfork opined that " Corin reveals greater character depth than ever before " while NME commented that she " is Siouxsie on ' Youth Decay ' , a sassy Francophile lover on ' Milkshake n ' Honey ' and all West Coast beach babe on the immensely pretty ' Leave You Behind ' . " Steve Huey , writing for AllMusic , gave high marks to Tucker and Brownstein 's guitar interplay as well as Weiss ' backing vocals , stating that the band " makes full use of that extra instrument , packing the tracks with lilting three @-@ part harmonies . " The Southland Times notably praised the album 's maturity and assertiveness , commenting that the band " has also created a more melodic sound and tunes are catchier and more accomplished with Tucker 's vocals sounding more confident and tuneful than ever .

" 
 In a mixed review , Arion Berger of Rolling Stone magazine noted that Sleater @-@ Kinney " have remade rock aggression as thinking @-@ women 's work and handled punk with finesse " , but also criticized the writing of some tracks for being " awfully self @-@ conscious for a fifth album . " The Village Voice reviewer Howard Hampton compared the album 's music favorably to The Go @-@ Go 's ' Beauty and the Beat , even though he remarked that instead of " [ settling ] for The Go @-@ Go 's demure ministrations " , All Hands on the Bad One " means to work the whole loving fist all the way up your tight little mind .

 In order to shoot the film , Gaston Méliès moved his production and distribution unit , the Star Film Company from its location in New York to San Antonio in January 1910 . Méliès promised to produce a historically " correct " depiction of the Battle of the Alamo . The film was directed by William F. Haddock . The film was shot in San Antonio , Texas and on location at the Alamo . One hundred cadets from the Peacock Military Academy portrayed the Mexican Army . Wilbert Melville " conceived the idea , designed the plot and formulated the scenario ... " for the film . The film was produced with the permission of the mayor . The film was released on May 25 , 1911 . One estimate of the cast claimed some five hundred people were present in the picture , but this is not supported by other details of the production . 
 An advertisement for the film highlighted the Alamo being bombarded with real cannon , the ride of Lieutenant Dickenson with the dispatch to General Sam Houston , the arrival of Dave Crockett , the death of Bowie , the escape of Rose and the surrender of Santa Anna .

 Richard R. Flores analyzed the lost film and notes that Méliès ' production was claimed to have been 10 minutes in length and that it could not make a significant depiction of the battle . The historical accuracy of the film was compromised to carry out the plot of the " pretty girl , shy hero , and a villain " . While Lieutenant <unk> Dickenson was a real person and his wife was present at the mission , her name was Suzanna . Suzanna Dickenson and her infant daughter survived the battle , but there is no evidence of a Mexican spy or a marriage attempt . Instead , Santa Anna sent Suzanna north to inform the victory of the Mexican forces to General Sam Houston . Flores cites Rony 's labeling of Méliès ' productions as a " hybrid documentary and fantasy " and notes that it was an early attempt at a historical documentary based on its attempt at a faithful setting . The uses the Mexicans ' as a form of savages in Méliès cinematic motifs . Frank Thompson 's analysis of the production notes states that William F. Haddock was delving into the archives to produce an accurate depiction of the Alamo at the studio because the Alamo itself was altered from the time of the battle . Thompson noted that despite the battle being within living memory the " exact reproduction " used a painted canvas backdrop and focused on an entirely fictional plot .

 Motography included a brief review of the film which states , " This is indeed a well presented historical subject . The action has breadth and historical perspective , with stirring scenes and large groupings , and at the same time there is a human plot threading its way through the historical background and giving the action a specific interest . The last scene , showing Santa Anna 's surrender " as a common soldier , " is rather obscure . One wonders why he did it . In all other scenes the action is clear and effective . It would be a stolid audience indeed that failed to respond to the thrilling scene inside the Alamo . " The Moving Picture World 's review stated that " [ it ] is a very thrilling and altogether satisfactory reproduction of an important historical episode . The company deserves the highest commendation for the picture and the way it is produced . " 
 A negative review in the column " <unk> <unk> " by C. H. Claudy in The Moving Picture World found great faults with the production . Claudy wrote . " One hardly conceives of a commander , informed of the approach of a column of the enemy , so far away they are only visible through field glasses , getting sufficiently panic stricken to send immediately for help saying he is besieged by a thousand Mexicans . One imagines he would at least go look and see for himself ! And one resents a scene labelled " The Attack , " which is so short one can 't even look at all of it , said attack being motionless men in a thin line pointing guns at the Alamo ! The interior of the Alamo was well done — yet do people stop a desperate defense to go through heroics about a line and fighting to the death ? Or do they fight to the death without talking about it ? Perhaps the original fighters did go through that line , drawn on the floor , stunt , and agree among themselves to fight till they died , but such desperate fighters didn 't all stop fighting at once to discuss the matter . Miss Storey , with a small part , made the most of it , as usual , and gave a convincing presentation of a woman in utter despair , but she deserved a better and less crude setting than she received — and so did her subject .

" Proud Mary " is staged entirely in wheelchairs , and was described by series choreographer Zach Woodlee as the " scariest " number produced to date . 
 " Wheels " was watched by 7 @.@ 35 million US viewers , and saw Barclay nominated for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing of a Comedy Series . It prompted criticism from a committee of performers with disabilities , who felt that it was inappropriate to cast an able @-@ bodied actor in a disabled role .

Will is suspicious of her motives , increasingly so when Sue donates money to the school to fund three new handicap ramps for students with disabilities . Sue is later seen visiting her older sister , Jean ( Robin Trocki ) , who also has Down syndrome , and lives in a residential home for people with disabilities . In the end , the glee club performs " Proud Mary " , staging the entire routine in wheelchairs in support of Artie .

 Kevin McHale deemed " Wheels " the " most serious " episode of Glee so far . He enjoyed Artie 's character development in the episode , explaining that when he was cast in the role , he did not know Artie 's background and thus made up his own backstory for him . He believed that Artie became paralysed later in life , rather than being born that way , which was proven correct in " Wheels " . Of the burgeoning romance between Artie and Tina , McHale opined : " I think Tina and Artie will be together . I think they will be a couple for a long time . " He explained that from the beginning of the show 's production , creator Ryan Murphy expressed the belief that Artie and Tina should be together , and so he and Jenna Ushkowitz deliberately sat close to one another during filming , assuming that it would eventually happen . McHale was shocked by Artie 's reaction to Tina 's faked stutter , and was initially unsure " why he was being so dramatic " . He concluded however : " I really think Artie fell for Tina because they were set apart by their disabilities . They 're already kind of outcasts being in glee , but within that group they shared a connection . So he based their whole relationship on that and when it went away , Artie didn 't know what to do . " McHale and Ushkowitz hope that their characters will ultimately become a couple , as they are best friends in real life . 
 Murphy called " Wheels " " the turning point for the show " . He elaborated : " Certainly , after this , it remains a comedy , and it 's fun . But writing this made me feel the responsibility of showing the truth of the pain that outcasts go through . It 's not all razzle @-@ dazzle show business . It 's tough , and it 's painful , and it was for me growing up , and it is for most people . " Murphy commented that the episode caused him to realize that , as well as highlighting the " fun and glamour " of glee clubs , it is also occasionally " really great [ ... ] to show the underbelly of what people who are different feel . " 
 Recurring characters who appear in the episode are Kurt 's father Burt Hummel ( O 'Malley ) , glee club members Brittany ( Heather Morris ) , Santana Lopez ( Naya Rivera ) , Mike Chang ( Harry Shum , Jr . ) and Matt Rutherford ( Dijon Talton ) , school reporter Jacob Ben Israel ( Josh Sussman ) , Principal Figgins ( Theba ) and former glee club director Sandy Ryerson ( Stephen Tobolowsky ) . " Wheels " guest stars Cheryl Francis Harrington and Jeff Lewis as a nurse and manager at a local residential facility , and also introduces two characters with Down syndrome , Robin Trocki as Sue 's sister Jean Sylvester , and Lauren Potter as Becky Jackson , a sophomore at William McKinley High School . Potter is a member of the Down 's Syndrome Association of Los Angeles , and was contacted about auditioning through the association 's in @-@ house talent agency , Hearts and Hands . Fourteen actresses auditioned for the role , which Potter deemed " a great experience " to perform .

 The episode features cover versions of Nouvelle Vague rendition of " Dancing with Myself " , " Defying Gravity " from Wicked and the Ike & Tina Turner rendition of " Proud Mary " . Glee cast versions of the songs , including both Michele and Colfer 's solo performances of " Defying Gravity " , were all released as singles available for digital download . While " Proud Mary " and " Dancing With Myself " did not chart , " Defying Gravity " reached number 58 in Australia , 38 in Canada and 31 in America . A duet version of " Defying Gravity " appeared on the soundtrack album " Glee : The Music , Volume 1 " . 
 Murphy selected " Defying Gravity " for the episode after Colfer relayed a story from his own high school days , whereby his drama teacher refused to let him sing the song because of his sex . Murphy explained : " I found a way to write it into the show because that 's in a nutshell what this show is about : someone being told that they can 't do something because of what the perception of them is as opposed to what their real ability is . " Colfer stated that the opportunity to finally sing the song " really meant the world " to him , and that : " It 's absolutely terrifying to watch yourself do something you 've dreamed about for such a long time . I know I 'm definitely not the best singer , but I think the message , the story behind the song about defying limits and borders placed by others , hopefully all that gets across with the performance . Although I do some very ' <unk> ' things in the song , it 's probably one of the most honest and close @-@ to @-@ heart scenes I 've ever filmed or performed for that matter . " 
 " Dancing With Myself " is McHale 's first solo performance on the show . Murphy commented that the performance is Artie 's chance to " break away from being misunderstood by everyone " and express himself , explaining that although Artie is usually " a very secure guy " who does not care about others ' opinions of him , " Wheels " sees his friends take his disability for granted : " So this performance is all about him saying , ' Look , this is who I am , and this is who I want to be . ' " McHale has stated that performing as Artie has made him more aware of the challenges that people with disabilities face : " It 's a completely different side of life . More than ever , I realize how grateful I am to be able to get up between each take and walk around . I 'm glad that I can represent that kind of life on television so millions of people see it every week . And the whole point of it is to show that Artie can still do everything everyone else can that matters . " 
 Glee choreographer Zach Woodlee described " Proud Mary " as the " scariest " number produced to date , citing concerns with choreographing an entire routine in wheelchairs and problems building the correct staging . Woodlee explained the stage ramps were initially built too steeply , preventing the actors from ascending them in wheelchairs , and that the actors experienced problems learning to distribute their weight correctly , flipping the wheelchairs over backwards : " It was like roller derby . All of the actors would fall backwards and hit their heads — particularly Lea Michele . You lose your balance really quick when you try to go up a ramp in a wheelchair . Amber Riley caught an edge going down a ramp and fell off completely . There were pile @-@ ups ; there were crashes . Basically , everything that could go wrong , did . " Murphy specified to Woodlee that cast members should not be able to leave their wheelchairs during the number , as : " Artie doesn 't get to get up ever , so I didn 't want anyone to get up . " Woodlee agreed : " If it looked too fun and easy , it wouldn 't read right . Ryan really wanted people to understand what Artie deals with . "

 The episode attracted criticism from a committee of performers with disabilities , who felt that casting an able @-@ bodied actor to play a disabled student was inappropriate . CSI star Robert David Hall commented : " I think there 's a fear of litigation , that a person with disabilities might slow a production down , fear that viewers might be uncomfortable . " Glee 's executive producer Brad Falchuk responded that while he understood the concern and frustration of disability advocates , McHale had the singing and acting ability and charisma required for the role and : " it 's hard to say no to someone that talented " . McHale has stated that he is pleased to represent a character in a wheelchair , and that : " I think what 's great about it is just because he 's in a wheelchair , he can still do what everyone else does . " Kristin Dos Santos of E ! Online refuted criticism of the episode , opining that : " ' Wheels ' is all about empowering people with disabilities and sends out an uplifting message to the disabled community . " Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times expressed a similar sentiment , stating : " Here we have an episode bluntly addressing the complexities of disability and doing so with so much respect and dignity , and there are complaints about Artie not being wheelchair @-@ bound in real life ? <unk> on , guys . " 
 Tim Stack for Entertainment Weekly called " Wheels " a " great , great episode " , stating that it made him cry several times . MTV 's Aly Semigran also commented that the episode brought her to tears , suggesting that Lynch 's performance was Emmy @-@ worthy and deeming " Wheels " " a truly standout hour of TV " . Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal reviewed the episode positively , calling Artie 's rendition of " Dancing With Myself " " catchy " and " upbeat " and praising Rachel 's " Defying Gravity " audition , which he wrote : " leaves us wanting for more . " Kennedy described the episode as " sheer perfection " , and James Poniewozik of Time made the pun : " Glee 's always been a pleasure , but if it raises its storytelling ambitions this way , it can really defy gravity . " 
 Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger wrote that while he generally finds Glee to be " a show with a serious identity crisis " , he did not dislike " Wheels " as much as previous episodes . Sepinwall wrote that while Glee can be " broad and in @-@ your @-@ face and self @-@ congratulatory " , this episode was " much more human @-@ scaled [ and ] much more interesting . " Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune similarly commented that while other episodes of Glee lack " coherence and narrative drive " , " Wheels " did not have this problem , describing it as " a case study of what Glee does right " and deeming Artie and Kurt 's storylines " provocative and thoughtfully handled . " 
 Mike Hale of The New York Times felt that the episode was problematic . He thought that having Kurt sabotage his own audition sent out a " mixed message " , and believed that actress Lauren Potter was " used as a prop in the continuing humanization of Sue Sylvester . " Hale wrote that the storyline felt " smarmy and artificial " , though praised Lynch for making the scene with Sue 's sister " warm and real " . Entertainment Weekly 's Dan Snierson felt that the revelation about Sue 's sister was " a little manipulative " , though wrote that he " didn 't care in that glorious moment . " He hoped that Glee 's writers would not humanize Sue too often , however , fearing that she would lose her " dictatorial swagger " . Eric Goldman for IGN rated the episode 7 @.@ 5 / 10 , commenting : " I really hope that episode was about getting a lot of ' issue ' storylines out of the way all at once , because that was a lot of overkill . " He felt that , although the episode contained " the usual strong humor , warm character moments and catchy musical performances " , overall it felt " very afterschool special " . 
 = Strensham services = 
 Strensham services is a motorway service station on the M5 in Worcestershire , England . In August 2011 , it was rated as 4 stars ( southbound ) and 3 stars ( northbound ) by quality assessors at Visit England . 
 Unusually for a motorway service station , the two sites are about half a mile apart due to the proximity of junction 8 ( for the M50 motorway ) . The services opened with the motorway in 1962 and have undergone many developments over time , largely due to the evolution of the motorway , which at the time of its opening ran from Birmingham to Strensham but now runs to Exeter some 100 miles southwards . It was the first service station on the M5 . 
 = = History = = 
 The original service station opened with the M5 and M50 motorways in November 1962 , though none of the original buildings survive in use . The M5 , which was built with dual two @-@ lane carriageways , was extended southwards , from junction 8 in 1969 , with dual three @-@ lane carriageways . It was widened between junctions 3 and 8 to dual three @-@ lane carriageways in the early 1990s including a remodelling of junction 8 ( M50 ) . The proximity of the northbound area to the remodelled junction would have caused issues with traffic trying to join and leave the motorway and so it was relocated half a mile to the north on a new larger site in 1991 . The exit from the southbound services has been altered to feed directly into the M50 junction . The former northbound area is now in use as a maintenance area , though due to the motorway widening this can now only be accessed from the local road network . 
 Wychavon District Council refused to renew the gambling machine permit for the service area in 1994 , under its policy not to allow gambling machines in areas where food was sold to the public . The Kenning Motor Group , who operated the service area at the time went to the High Court to overturn the decision . 
 In 1994 the service area was subject to a management buyout , led by Nick Turner , who had been running the site for the previous three years . It was announced the services would trade under the new name , Take a Break . At the time RoadChef unsuccessfully showed interest in purchasing the site , it wasn 't until 2001 , by purchasing Take A Break that RoadChef started operating at the Strensham site . 
 Strensham was one of two test sites chosen by RoadChef for a new loyalty card scheme in 2005 . The cards themselves used new technology to physically display the points total on the card . The loyalty scheme is no longer in use today . 
 In July 2008 RoadChef started a trial at the southbound site by replacing the Wimpy fast food franchise with a McDonalds outlet , previously only four UK motorway service areas had McDonalds franchises . If this trial was deemed to be successful , RoadChef plan to replace more Wimpy franchises . As part of this trial signs for the southbound area were changed to show the operator name as " McDonalds Costa " , although the RoadChef brand is still used at the services itself . The refurbishment created around 80 jobs in the local area . 
 Since the Southbound refurbishment , all Wimpy outlets have closed to be replaced by own brand The Burger Company . It is thought that this is just a ' holding ' brand prior to a full @-@ scale refurbishment . Due to the success of the trial Roadchef have refurbished more sites ( including Strensham Northbound ) to include The Hot Food Company ( Restaurant ) and McDonald 's .

 As a consequence of heavy rainfall in Worcestershire in July 2007 the M5 motorway was blocked , leaving many stranded cars on the road . The operations manager of the service station , Quintin Speers provided a key role in helping those stranded , opening up areas of the main building to be used by those stuck on the motorway . Quintin Speers also helped drivers by pushing cars to safety and distributing blankets to those in need . 
 = = Air ambulance = = 
 The Worcestershire County Air Ambulance , which has been operating since 1991 , moved to the Strensham site in 1998 under a sponsorship deal with Take a Break , who were operating the service area at the time . Access to the air ambulance site can be made from the service station itself or from the local road network via the staff entrance to the services . An open day is held at the site each year to raise money for the operation of the air ambulance . In May 2008 the operational hours of the service was increased from 12 to 14 hours each day , as a result of this , landing lights needed to be installed at the base to enable night time use .

 The southbound site is in its original location , though none of the original buildings survive . The main building is a large glass @-@ fronted structure with the main car park situated in front of the building , with the lorry and coach parking behind .

 Situated half a mile to the north of the southbound services , the northbound services are set back from the motorway . The main building is an unusual design based on curves and circles . Unlike the southbound site , the cash machines are located outside and both the car and lorry parking is to the front of the building . 
 Access to an air ambulance base is at the rear of the site . The site also has a budget @-@ chain hotel located within the service area . In May 2005 it was reported that the southbound services had overnight parking facilities for 100 lorries . This was a chargeable service .

 The following facilities are available at Strensham :

 Strensham services are located slightly to the north of M5 junction 8 , the exit slip road from the southbound area merges into the slip road from the M5 to junction 8 , so traffic must negotiate junction 8 to rejoin the M5 . Northbound the service area is about a mile north of the junction . 
 The services are located about 12 miles ( 19 km ) south of Worcester , and about 16 miles ( 26 km ) north of Gloucester . They are also about 100 miles ( 160 km ) to the north west of London . 
 = Illecillewaet Glacier = 
 The Illecillewaet Glacier / <unk> / is a glacier in British Columbia , Canada . It is located inside Glacier National Park in the Selkirk Mountains , a sub @-@ range of the Columbia Mountains . After the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway ( CPR ) near the glacier ’ s terminus , and the building of a hotel nearby , the glacier became a prominent tourist destination in the Canadian west . Easily accessible by road and railway , it is one of the most @-@ studied glaciers in North America . Its retreat over the last one hundred years has been extensively documented . 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 The glacier is located south of Mount Sir Donald in the Selkirk Mountains , west of Rogers Pass in British Columbia . The outflow of the glacier forms the headwaters of the Illecillewaet River . The Illecillewaet <unk> feeds three other glaciers : the Asulkan , Geikie and Deville . As of 2002 , the accumulation area of the glacier is 4 @.@ 92 square kilometres ( 1 @.@ 90 sq mi ) while its ablation area is 3 @.@ 91 square kilometres ( 1 @.@ 51 sq mi ) , for a total size of 8 @.@ 83 square kilometres ( 3 @.@ 41 sq mi ) . Its estimated mean depth is 100 metres ( 330 ft ) , and its highest point is measured at 2 @,@ 800 metres ( 9 @,@ 200 ft ) . The exposed bedrock downslope of the glacier 's terminus shows the effects of glacial plucking .

 Although First Nations people were present in valleys to the east and west , evidence of aboriginal settlement in the Illecillewaet area has not been found . The first European to visit the glacier was Major A.B. Rogers , a railway surveyor , who examined the area in 1882 and 1883 in search of a viable pass . With the completion of the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway ( CPR ) through nearby Rogers Pass in 1885 , the glacier and its surrounding area became one of western Canada 's first tourist destinations . Glacier National Park was established in 1886 , and Glacier House , a small hotel , was built near the north end of the glacier in the same year . The hotel was expanded in 1892 and 1904 , and by 1907 the glacier was described as the " most visited glacier in the Americas " . 
 At this point , the glacier was called the " Great Glacier " by CPR promoters . The name " Illecillewaet " is an Okanagan First Nations word for " big water " , and referred to the river before being applied to the glacier . It gradually replaced " Great " and was adopted by Parks Canada in the 1960s . 
 The new influx of visitors to the glacier brought with it both mountaineers and glaciologists . The first recorded ascent of the glacier was by A. O. Wheeler with Edward <unk> and Charles Clarke in 1901 , although it had most likely been climbed earlier . Wheeler and the Alpine Club of Canada built a hut near Glacier House for mountaineering use . <unk> was one of several Swiss guides hired by the CPR to accompany visitors to the glacier and up nearby peaks . 
 = = = Vaux family = = = 
 The Vaux family were well @-@ off Quakers from Pennsylvania . The family first visited Glacier House and Illecillewaet Glacier in 1887 . On a subsequent trip , they noticed a visible retreat of the glacier 's terminus . The Vaux children , William , George , Jr . , and Mary ( later Mary Vaux Walcott ) were amateur photographers and began a study of the glacier using pictures taken from fixed points . William and George , Jr. presented their findings to the National Academy of Sciences in the U.S. Their study and methods were considered a " breakthrough " in the new field of glaciology . Mary Vaux would continue to visit the area every summer until her death in 1940 . 
 On a more anecdotal level , the Vaux family carefully photographed the glacier and surrounding area , first using glass plates which were transported up and down the mountain and sent back to Philadelphia ; and later more modern Mamiya medium format cameras . There is continuing photographic evidence to support their more scientific measurements . George Vaux , Jr . ’ s grandson Henry Vaux , Jr . , ( also an alpine photographer ) noted the static nature of the glacier 's alpine area , related to its short growing seasons . The only two major differences between contemporary times and the early 1900s are the retreat of the glacier and the presence of the Trans @-@ Canada Highway . Thus , he saw trees that were observed by his grandfather from the same perspective , and there is little difference " except for the glaciers , most of which are back at least two kilometres , and of man @-@ made things . ” 
 = = = Trans Canada Highway = = = 
 In 1916 , the CPR constructed the Connaught Tunnel , which bypassed the Glacier House site . The numbers of visitors declined , and , in 1925 , the hotel was closed . It was demolished in 1929 . For a thirty @-@ year period , the previously popular glacier was mostly unvisited . In 1962 , the new Trans Canada Highway was completed and its route closely followed that of the original CPR line . Once again , Illecillewaet was joined with a major transportation route . Parks Canada began to improve facilities at the glacier ; the Illecillewaet campground was opened and new trails were constructed giving access to the glacier , now located significantly farther away . The latter half of the century saw more <unk> studies as the glacier 's retreat became more pronounced . 
 = = = <unk> studies = = = 
 Although sparse compared with studies of European glaciers , studies of the Illecillewaet are detailed by North American standards . The first scientific study of the glacier was performed by the Vaux family from 1887 to 1912 . George , William , and Mary Vaux with others , including A.O. Wheeler and C.E. Webb measured the glacial retreat mostly with annual photos from fixed points . The period of World War I and the Great Depression saw fewer observations ; the closing of Glacier House in 1925 drastically reduced the number of visitors to the area . The federal Dominion Water and Power Bureau started assessing the glacier in 1945 using baseline measurements . The Bureau conducted yearly studies from 1945 to 1950 , and every two years from 1950 to 1960 . There were no measurements taken from 1960 to 1972 , when Parks Canada began surveying . A study which examines rock lichen in order to determine glacial retreat was begun in 1996 . Satellite imagery has also been used to measure the glacier 's size . 
 = = = Retreat = = = 
 Since scientific research began in the late 1800s , Illecillewaet Glacier has been retreating and shrinking , with shorter periods of small advances . Between 1887 and 1962 the terminus of the glacier retreated almost 1 @.@ 5 km ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) . Parks Canada research indicates that there was a period of advancement from 1972 to 1986 , with the terminus advancing 100 m ( 330 ft ) . In total , there was a net retreat of 1 @,@ 433 m ( 4 @,@ 701 ft ) in the period of 1887 to 1984 . The glacier lost about 28 % of its mass by 1951 ; it regained maybe 1 % by 1986 .

 = Battle of Antietam = 
 The Battle of Antietam / <unk> / , also known as the Battle of Sharpsburg , particularly in the South , fought on September 17 , 1862 , near Sharpsburg , Maryland and Antietam Creek as part of the Maryland Campaign , was the first major battle in the American Civil War to take place on Union soil . It is the bloodiest single @-@ day battle in American history , with a combined tally of 22 @,@ 717 dead , wounded , or missing . 
 After pursuing Confederate General Robert E. Lee into Maryland , Union Army Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan launched attacks against Lee 's army , in defensive positions behind Antietam Creek . At dawn on September 17 , Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker 's corps mounted a powerful assault on Lee 's left flank . Attacks and counterattacks swept across Miller 's Cornfield , and fighting swirled around the Dunker Church . Union assaults against the Sunken Road eventually pierced the Confederate center , but the Federal advantage was not followed up . In the afternoon , Union Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside 's corps entered the action , capturing a stone bridge over Antietam Creek and advancing against the Confederate right . At a crucial moment , Confederate Maj. Gen. A. P. Hill 's division arrived from Harpers Ferry and launched a surprise counterattack , driving back Burnside and ending the battle . Although outnumbered two @-@ to @-@ one , Lee committed his entire force , while McClellan sent in less than three @-@ quarters of his army , enabling Lee to fight the Federals to a standstill . During the night , both armies consolidated their lines . In spite of crippling casualties , Lee continued to skirmish with McClellan throughout September 18 , while removing his battered army south of the Potomac River . 
 Despite having superiority of numbers , McClellan 's attacks failed to achieve force concentration , which allowed Lee to counter by shifting forces and moving interior lines to meet each challenge . Therefore , despite ample reserve forces that could have been deployed to exploit localized successes , McClellan failed to destroy Lee 's army . 
 McClellan had halted Lee 's invasion of Maryland , but Lee was able to withdraw his army back to Virginia without interference from the cautious McClellan . McClellan 's refusal to pursue Lee 's army led to his removal from command by President Abraham Lincoln in November . Although the battle was tactically inconclusive , the Confederate troops had withdrawn first from the battlefield , making it , in military terms , a Union victory . It was a sufficiently significant victory to give Lincoln the confidence to announce his Emancipation Proclamation , which discouraged the British and French governments from pursuing any potential plans to recognize the Confederacy .

 Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia — about 55 @,@ 000 men — entered the state of Maryland on September 3 , 1862 , following their victory at Second Bull Run on August 30 . Emboldened by success , the Confederate leadership intended to take the war into enemy territory . Lee 's invasion of Maryland was intended to run simultaneously with an invasion of Kentucky by the armies of Braxton Bragg and Kirby Smith . It was also necessary for logistical reasons , as northern Virginia 's farms had been stripped bare of food . Based on events such as the Baltimore riots in the spring of 1861 and the fact that President Lincoln had to pass through the city in disguise en route to his inauguration , Confederate leaders assumed that Maryland would welcome the Confederate forces warmly . They sang the tune " Maryland , My Maryland ! " as they marched , but by the fall of 1862 pro @-@ Union sentiment was winning out , especially in the western parts of the state . Civilians generally hid inside their houses as Lee 's army passed through their towns , or watched in cold silence , while the Army of the Potomac was cheered and encouraged . Some Confederate politicians , including President Jefferson Davis , believed that the prospect of foreign recognition would increase if the Confederacy won a military victory on Union soil ; such a victory might gain recognition and financial support from the United Kingdom and France , although there is no evidence that Lee thought the Confederacy should base its military plans on this possibility .

 While McClellan 's 87 @,@ 000 @-@ man Army of the Potomac was moving to intercept Lee , two Union soldiers ( Corporal Barton W. Mitchell and First Sergeant John M. Bloss of the 27th Indiana Volunteer Infantry ) discovered a mislaid copy of Lee 's detailed battle plans — Special Order 191 — wrapped around three cigars . The order indicated that Lee had divided his army and dispersed portions geographically ( to Harpers Ferry , West Virginia , and Hagerstown , Maryland ) , thus making each subject to isolation and defeat if McClellan could move quickly enough . McClellan waited about 18 hours before deciding to take advantage of this intelligence and reposition his forces , thus squandering an opportunity to defeat Lee decisively .

 There were two significant engagements in the Maryland campaign prior to the major battle of Antietam : Maj. Gen. Thomas J. " Stonewall " Jackson 's capture of Harpers Ferry and McClellan 's assault through the Blue Ridge Mountains in the Battle of South Mountain . The former was significant because a large portion of Lee 's army was absent from the start of the battle of Antietam , attending to the surrender of the Union garrison ; the latter because stout Confederate defenses at two passes through the mountains delayed McClellan 's advance enough for Lee to concentrate the remainder of his army at Sharpsburg .
