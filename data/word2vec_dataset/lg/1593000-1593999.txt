 = = = Possible theological implications = = = 
 Intelligent design proponents often insist that their claims do not require a religious component . However , various philosophical and theological issues are naturally raised by the claims of intelligent design . 
 Intelligent design proponents attempt to demonstrate scientifically that features such as irreducible complexity and specified complexity could not arise through natural processes , and therefore required repeated direct miraculous interventions by a Designer ( often a Christian concept of God ) . They reject the possibility of a Designer who works merely through setting natural laws in motion at the outset , in contrast to theistic evolution ( to which even Charles Darwin was open ) . Intelligent design is distinct because it asserts repeated miraculous interventions in addition to designed laws . This contrasts with other major religious traditions of a created world in which God 's interactions and influences do not work in the same way as physical causes . The Roman Catholic tradition makes a careful distinction between ultimate metaphysical explanations and secondary , natural causes . 
 The concept of direct miraculous intervention raises other potential theological implications . If such a Designer does not intervene to alleviate suffering even though capable of intervening for other reasons , some imply the designer is not omnibenevolent ( see problem of evil and related theodicy ) . 
 Further , repeated interventions imply that the original design was not perfect and final , and thus pose a problem for any who believe that the Creator 's work had been both perfect and final . Intelligent design proponents seek to explain the problem of poor design in nature by insisting that we have simply failed to understand the perfection of the design ( for example , proposing that vestigial organs have unknown purposes ) , or by proposing that designers do not necessarily produce the best design they can , and may have unknowable motives for their actions . 
 = = = God of the gaps = = = 
 Intelligent design has also been characterized as a God @-@ of @-@ the @-@ gaps argument , which has the following form : 
 There is a gap in scientific knowledge . 
 The gap is filled with acts of God ( or intelligent designer ) and therefore proves the existence of God ( or intelligent designer ) . 
 A God @-@ of @-@ the @-@ gaps argument is the theological version of an argument from ignorance . A key feature of this type of argument is that it merely answers outstanding questions with explanations ( often supernatural ) that are unverifiable and ultimately themselves subject to unanswerable questions . Historians of science observe that the astronomy of the earliest civilizations , although astonishing and incorporating mathematical constructions far in excess of any practical value , proved to be misdirected and of little importance to the development of science because they failed to inquire more carefully into the mechanisms that drove the heavenly bodies across the sky . It was the Greek civilization that first practiced science , although not yet as a formally defined experimental science , but nevertheless an attempt to rationalize the world of natural experience without recourse to divine intervention . In this historically motivated definition of science any appeal to an intelligent creator is explicitly excluded for the paralysing effect it may have on scientific progress . 
 = = Kitzmiller trial = = 
 Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District was the first direct challenge brought in the United States federal courts against a public school district that required the presentation of intelligent design as an alternative to evolution . The plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism , and that the school board policy thus violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution . 
 Eleven parents of students in Dover , Pennsylvania , sued the Dover Area School District over a statement that the school board required be read aloud in ninth @-@ grade science classes when evolution was taught . The plaintiffs were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , Americans United for Separation of Church and State ( AU ) and Pepper Hamilton LLP . The National Center for Science Education acted as consultants for the plaintiffs . The defendants were represented by the Thomas More Law Center . The suit was tried in a bench trial from September 26 to November 4 , 2005 , before Judge John E. Jones III . Kenneth R. Miller , Kevin Padian , Brian Alters , Robert T. Pennock , Barbara Forrest and John F. Haught served as expert witnesses for the plaintiffs . Michael Behe , Steve Fuller and Scott Minnich served as expert witnesses for the defense . 
 On December 20 , 2005 , Judge Jones issued his 139 @-@ page findings of fact and decision , ruling that the Dover mandate was unconstitutional , and barring intelligent design from being taught in Pennsylvania 's Middle District public school science classrooms . The eight Dover school board members who voted for the intelligent design requirement were all defeated in a November 8 , 2005 , election by challengers who opposed the teaching of intelligent design in a science class , and the current school board president stated that the board does not intend to appeal the ruling . 
 In his finding of facts , Judge Jones made the following condemnation of the " Teach the Controversy " strategy : 
 Moreover , ID 's backers have sought to avoid the scientific scrutiny which we have now determined that it cannot withstand by advocating that the controversy , but not ID itself , should be taught in science class . This tactic is at best disingenuous , and at worst a canard . The goal of the IDM is not to encourage critical thought , but to foment a revolution which would supplant evolutionary theory with ID . 
 = = = Reaction = = = 
 Judge Jones himself anticipated that his ruling would be criticized , saying in his decision that : 
 Those who disagree with our holding will likely mark it as the product of an activist judge . If so , they will have erred as this is manifestly not an activist Court . 
 Rather , this case came to us as the result of the activism of an ill @-@ informed faction on a school board , aided by a national public interest law firm eager to find a constitutional test case on ID , who in combination drove the Board to adopt an imprudent and ultimately unconstitutional policy . The breathtaking inanity of the Board 's decision is evident when considered against the factual backdrop which has now been fully revealed through this trial . The students , parents , and teachers of the Dover Area School District deserved better than to be dragged into this legal maelstrom , with its resulting utter waste of monetary and personal resources . 
 As Jones had predicted , John G. West , Associate Director of the Center for Science and Culture , said : 
 The Dover decision is an attempt by an activist federal judge to stop the spread of a scientific idea and even to prevent criticism of Darwinian evolution through government @-@ imposed censorship rather than open debate , and it won 't work . He has conflated Discovery Institute 's position with that of the Dover school board , and he totally misrepresents intelligent design and the motivations of the scientists who research it . 
 Newspapers have noted with interest that the judge is " a Republican and a churchgoer . " 
 Subsequently , the decision has been examined in a search for flaws and conclusions , partly by intelligent design supporters aiming to avoid future defeats in court . In the Winter of 2007 , the Montana Law Review published three articles . In the first , David K. DeWolf , John G. West and Casey Luskin , all of the Discovery Institute , argued that intelligent design is a valid scientific theory , the Jones court should not have addressed the question of whether it was a scientific theory , and that the Kitzmiller decision will have no effect at all on the development and adoption of intelligent design as an alternative to standard evolutionary theory . In the second Peter H. Irons responded , arguing that the decision was extremely well reasoned and spells the death knell for the intelligent design efforts to introduce creationism in public schools , while in the third , DeWolf , et al . , answer the points made by Irons . However , fear of a similar lawsuit has resulted in other school boards abandoning intelligent design " teach the controversy " proposals . 
 In April 2010 , the American Academy of Religion issued Guidelines for Teaching About Religion in K ‐ 12 Public Schools in the United States , which included guidance that creation science or intelligent design should not be taught in science classes , as " Creation science and intelligent design represent worldviews that fall outside of the realm of science that is defined as ( and limited to ) a method of inquiry based on gathering observable and measurable evidence subject to specific principles of reasoning . " However , these worldviews as well as others " that focus on speculation regarding the origins of life represent another important and relevant form of human inquiry that is appropriately studied in literature or social sciences courses . Such study , however , must include a diversity of worldviews representing a variety of religious and philosophical perspectives and must avoid privileging one view as more legitimate than others . "

 In June 2007 , the Council of Europe 's Committee on Culture , Science and Education issued a report , The dangers of creationism in education , which states " Creationism in any of its forms , such as ' intelligent design ' , is not based on facts , does not use any scientific reasoning and its contents are pathetically inadequate for science classes . " In describing the dangers posed to education by teaching creationism , it described intelligent design as " anti @-@ science " and involving " blatant scientific fraud " and " intellectual deception " that " blurs the nature , objectives and limits of science " and links it and other forms of creationism to denialism . On October 4 , 2007 , the Council of Europe 's Parliamentary Assembly approved a resolution stating that schools should " resist presentation of creationist ideas in any discipline other than religion , " including " intelligent design , " which it described as " the latest , more refined version of creationism , " " presented in a more subtle way . " The resolution emphasises that the aim of the report is not to question or to fight a belief , but to " warn against certain tendencies to pass off a belief as science . " 
 In the United Kingdom , public education includes religious education as a compulsory subject , and there are many faith schools that teach the ethos of particular denominations . When it was revealed that a group called Truth in Science had distributed DVDs produced by <unk> Media featuring Discovery Institute fellows making the case for design in nature , and claimed they were being used by 59 schools , the Department for Education and Skills ( DfES ) stated that " Neither creationism nor intelligent design are taught as a subject in schools , and are not specified in the science curriculum " ( part of the National Curriculum , which does not apply to independent schools or to education in Scotland ) . The DfES subsequently stated that " Intelligent design is not a recognised scientific theory ; therefore , it is not included in the science curriculum , " but left the way open for it to be explored in religious education in relation to different beliefs , as part of a syllabus set by a local Standing Advisory Council on Religious Education . In 2006 , the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority produced a " Religious Education " model unit in which pupils can learn about religious and nonreligious views about creationism , intelligent design and evolution by natural selection . 
 On June 25 , 2007 , the UK Government responded to an e @-@ petition by saying that creationism and intelligent design should not be taught as science , though teachers would be expected to answer pupils ' questions within the standard framework of established scientific theories . Detailed government " Creationism teaching guidance " for schools in England was published on September 18 , 2007 . It states that " Intelligent design lies wholly outside of science , " has no underpinning scientific principles , or explanations , and is not accepted by the science community as a whole . Though it should not be taught as science , " Any questions about creationism and intelligent design which arise in science lessons , for example as a result of media coverage , could provide the opportunity to explain or explore why they are not considered to be scientific theories and , in the right context , why evolution is considered to be a scientific theory . " However , " Teachers of subjects such as RE , history or citizenship may deal with creationism and intelligent design in their lessons . " 
 The British Centre for Science Education lobbying group has the goal of " countering creationism within the UK " and has been involved in government lobbying in the UK in this regard . Northern Ireland 's Department for Education says that the curriculum provides an opportunity for alternative theories to be taught . The Democratic Unionist Party ( DUP ) — which has links to fundamentalist Christianity — has been campaigning to have intelligent design taught in science classes . A DUP former Member of Parliament , David Simpson , has sought assurances from the education minister that pupils will not lose marks if they give creationist or intelligent design answers to science questions . In 2007 , Lisburn city council voted in favor of a DUP recommendation to write to post @-@ primary schools asking what their plans are to develop teaching material in relation to " creation , intelligent design and other theories of origin . " 
 Plans by Dutch Education Minister Maria van der <unk> to " stimulate an academic debate " on the subject in 2005 caused a severe public backlash . After the 2006 elections , she was succeeded by Ronald <unk> , described as a " molecular geneticist , staunch atheist and opponent of intelligent design . " As a reaction on this situation in the Netherlands , the Director General of the Flemish Secretariat of Catholic Education ( <unk> ) in Belgium , Mieke Van Hecke , declared that : " Catholic scientists already accepted the theory of evolution for a long time and that intelligent design and creationism doesn 't belong in Flemish Catholic schools . It 's not the tasks of the politics to introduce new ideas , that 's task and goal of science . "

 Muzaffar Iqbal , a notable Pakistani @-@ Canadian Muslim , signed the A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism petition of the Discovery Institute .

 The status of intelligent design in Australia is somewhat similar to that in the UK ( see Education in Australia ) . In 2005 , the Australian Minister for Education , Science and Training , Brendan Nelson , raised the notion of intelligent design being taught in science classes . The public outcry caused the minister to quickly concede that the correct forum for intelligent design , if it were to be taught , is in religion or philosophy classes . The Australian chapter of Campus Crusade for Christ distributed a DVD of the Discovery Institute 's documentary Unlocking the Mystery of Life ( 2002 ) to Australian secondary schools . The head of one of Australia 's leading private schools supported use of the DVD in the classroom at the discretion of teachers and principals .

 Montreal ( / <unk> / ; pronounced : [ mɔ ̃ <unk> ] ; French : Montréal ) is the most populous city in Quebec and the second most populous municipality in Canada . Originally called Ville @-@ Marie , or " City of Mary , " it is named after Mount Royal , the triple @-@ peaked hill in the heart of the city . The city is on the Island of Montreal , which took its name from the same source as the city , and a few much smaller peripheral islands , the largest of which is Île <unk> . It has a distinct four @-@ season continental climate with warm to hot summers and cold snowy winters . 
 In 2011 the city had a population of 1 @,@ 649 @,@ 519 . Montreal 's metropolitan area had a population of 3 @,@ 824 @,@ 221 and a population of 1 @,@ 886 @,@ 481 in the urban agglomeration , with all of the municipalities on the Island of Montreal included . The 2014 estimate of the population of the metropolitan area of Montreal is 4 @.@ 1 million . French is the city 's official language and is the language spoken at home by 56 @.@ 9 % of the population of the city , followed by English at 18 @.@ 6 % and 19 @.@ 8 % other languages ( in the 2006 census ) . In the larger Montreal Census Metropolitan Area , 67 @.@ 9 % of the population speaks French at home , compared to 16 @.@ 5 % who speak English . Montreal is one of the most bilingual cities in Quebec and Canada with 56 % of the population able to speak both English and French . Montreal is the second largest primarily French @-@ speaking city in the world , after Paris . 
 Historically the commercial capital of Canada , it was surpassed in population and economic strength by Toronto in the 1970s . It remains an important centre of commerce , aerospace , finance , pharmaceuticals , technology , design , education , culture , tourism , gaming , film and world affairs . Being the location of the headquarters of the International Civil Aviation Organization , Montreal is one of three North American cities home to organizations of the United Nations ( along with Washington , D.C. and New York ) and also has the second @-@ highest number of consulates in the continent . Montreal was also named a UNESCO City of Design . In 2009 , Montreal was named North America 's leading host city for international association events , according to the 2009 preliminary rankings of the International Congress and Convention Association ( ICCA ) . The 2016 edition of QS Best Student Cities ranked Montreal the 7th @-@ best city in the world to be a university student . According to the 2015 Global <unk> Ranking by the Economist Intelligence Unit , Montreal ranked 14th out of 140 cities . 
 Montreal has hosted multiple international conferences and events throughout its history , including the 1967 International and Universal Exposition and the 1976 Summer Olympic Games . It is the only Canadian city to have held the Summer Olympics . Currently , the city hosts the Canadian Grand Prix of Formula One , the Montreal International Jazz Festival and the Just for Laughs festival . In 2012 , Montreal was ranked as a Beta + world city .

 Though the city was first named by European settlers Ville Marie , or " City of Mary , " its current name comes from Mount Royal , the triple @-@ peaked hill in the heart of the city . According to one theory , the name derives from mont Réal , ( Mont Royal in modern French ) , but Cartier 's 1535 diary entry , naming the mountain , refers to " le mont Royal " . Another possibility mentioned by the Government of Canada on its web site concerning Canadian place names , is that the name was adopted as it is written nowadays because an early map of 1556 used the Italian name of the mountain , " Monte Real " .

 Archaeological evidence demonstrates that First Nations native people occupied the island of Montreal as early as 4 @,@ 000 years ago . By the year AD 1000 , they had started to cultivate maize . Within a few hundred years , they had built fortified villages . The Saint Lawrence Iroquoians , an ethnicity distinct from the Iroquois nations of the Haudenosaunee then based in present @-@ day New York , established the village of Hochelaga at the foot of Mount Royal two centuries before the French arrived . Archeologists have found evidence of their habitation there and at other locations in the valley since at least the 14th century . The French explorer Jacques Cartier visited Hochelaga on October 2 , 1535 , and estimated the population of the native people at Hochelaga to be " over a thousand people " .

 Seventy years later , the French explorer Samuel de Champlain reported that the St Lawrence Iroquoians and their settlements had disappeared altogether from the St Lawrence valley . This is believed to be due to <unk> , epidemics of European diseases , or intertribal wars . In 1611 Champlain established a fur trading post on the Island of Montreal , on a site initially named La Place Royale . At the confluence of Petite Riviere and St. Lawrence River , it is where present @-@ day Pointe @-@ à @-@ Callière stands . On his 1616 map , Samuel de Champlain named the island Lille de <unk> , in honour of the sieur de <unk> , a French dignitary who was seeking the viceroyship of New France . In 1639 Jérôme Le Royer de La <unk> obtained the <unk> title to the Island of Montreal in the name of the Notre Dame Society of Montreal to establish a Roman Catholic mission to evangelize natives .

 <unk> hired Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve , then 30 , to lead a group of colonists to build a mission on his new <unk> . The colonists left France in 1641 for Quebec , and arrived on the island the following year . On May 17 , 1642 , Ville @-@ Marie was founded on the southern shore of Montreal island , with Maisonneuve as its first governor . The settlement included a chapel and a hospital , under the command of Jeanne Mance . By 1643 , Ville @-@ Marie had already been attacked by Iroquois raids . In the spring of 1651 , the Iroquois attacks became so frequent and so violent that Ville Marie thought its end had come . Maisonneuve made all the settlers take refuge in the fort . By 1652 , the colony at Montreal had been so reduced that he was forced to return to France to raise 100 volunteers to go with him to the colony the following year . If the effort had failed , Montreal was to be abandoned and the survivors re @-@ located downriver to Quebec City . Before these 100 arrived in the fall of 1653 , the population of Montreal was barely 50 people . 
 By 1685 , Ville Marie was home to some 600 colonists , most of them living in modest wooden houses . Ville Marie became a centre for the fur trade and a base for further exploration . In 1689 , the English @-@ allied Iroquois attacked Lachine on the Island of Montreal , committing the worst massacre in the history of New France . By the early 18th century , the Sulpician Order was established there . To encourage French settlement , they wanted the Mohawk to move away from the fur trading post at Ville Marie . They had a mission village , known as <unk> , south of the St Lawrence River . The fathers persuaded some Mohawk to make a new settlement at their former hunting grounds north of the Ottawa River . This became <unk> . In 1745 several Mohawk families moved upriver to create another settlement , known as Akwesasne . All three are now Mohawk reserves in Canada . The Canadian territory was ruled as a French colony until 1760 , when it was surrendered to Great Britain after the Seven Years ' War . 
 Ville Marie was the name for the settlement that appeared in all official documents until 1705 , when Montreal appeared for the first time , although people referred to the " Island of Montreal " long before then . 
 = = = Modern history = = = 
 Montreal was incorporated as a city in 1832 . The opening of the Lachine Canal permitted ships to bypass the unnavigable Lachine Rapids , while the construction of the Victoria Bridge established Montreal as a major railway hub . The leaders of Montreal 's business community had started to build their homes in the Golden Square Mile ( ~ 2 @.@ 6 km2 ) from about 1850 . By 1860 , it was the largest municipality in British North America and the undisputed economic and cultural centre of Canada . 
 In the 19th century maintaining Montreal ’ s drinking water became increasingly difficult with the rapid increase in population . A majority of the drinking water was still coming from the city 's harbor , which was busy and heavily trafficked leading to the deterioration of the water within . In the mid 1840s the City of Montreal installed a water system that would pump water from the St. Lawrence and into cisterns . The cisterns would then be transported to the desired location . This was not the first water system of its type in Montreal as there had been one in private ownership since 1801 . In the middle of the 19th century water distribution was carried out by “ <unk> . ” The <unk> would open and close water valves outside of buildings , as directed , all over the city . As they lacked modern plumbing systems it was impossible to connect all buildings at once and it also acted as a conservation method . The population was not finished rising yet however , from 58 @,@ 000 in 1852 it rose to 267 @,@ 000 by 1901 . 
 Montreal was the capital of the Province of Canada from 1844 to 1849 , but lost its status when a Tory mob burnt down the Parliament building to protest the passage of the Rebellion Losses Bill . For strategic reasons , Queen Victoria herself established Ottawa as the capital . The reasons were twofold ; as it was located more in the interior of the nation , it was less susceptible to US attack . Perhaps more importantly , as it lay on the border between French and English Canada , the then small town of Ottawa was seen as a compromise between Montreal , Toronto , Kingston and Quebec City , who were all vying to become the young nation 's official capital . 
 An internment camp was set up at Immigration Hall in Montreal from August 1914 to November 1918 . 
 After World War I , the prohibition movement in the United States led to Montreal becoming a destination for Americans looking for alcohol . Unemployment remained high in the city , and was exacerbated by the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression . 
 During World War II , Mayor <unk> Houde protested against conscription and urged <unk> to disobey the federal government 's registry of all men and women . The Government , part of the Allied forces , was furious over Houde 's stand and held him at a prison camp until 1944 . That year the government decided to institute conscription to expand the armed forces and fight the Nazis . ( See Conscription Crisis of 1944 . ) 
 Montreal was the official residence of the Luxembourg royal family in exile during World War II . 
 By 1951 , Montreal 's population had surpassed one million . However , Toronto 's growth had begun challenging Montreal 's status as the economic capital of Canada . Indeed , the volume of stocks traded at the Toronto Stock Exchange had already surpassed that traded at the Montreal Stock Exchange in the 1940s . The Saint Lawrence Seaway opened in 1959 , allowing vessels to bypass Montreal . In time this development led to the end of the city 's economic dominance as businesses moved to other areas . During the 1960s there was continued growth , including the World 's Fair known as Expo 67 , and the construction of Canada 's tallest skyscrapers , new expressways and the subway system known as the Montreal Metro . 
 The 1970s ushered in a period of wide @-@ ranging social and political changes , stemming largely from the concerns of the French speaking majority about the conservation of their culture and language , given the traditional predominance of the English Canadian minority in the business arena . The October Crisis and the 1976 election of the Parti Québécois , supporting sovereign status for Quebec , resulted in the departure of many businesses and people from the city . In 1976 , Montreal was the host of the Olympics . During the 1980s and early 1990s , Montreal experienced a slower rate of economic growth than many other major Canadian cities . 
 Montreal was merged with the 27 surrounding municipalities on the Island of Montreal on January 1 , 2002 , creating a unified city covering the entire island . There was great resistance from the suburbs to the merger , with the perception being that it was forced on the mostly English suburbs by the Parti Québécois . As expected , this move proved unpopular and several mergers were later rescinded . Several former municipalities , totalling 13 % of the population of the island , voted to leave the unified city in separate referendums in June 2004 . The demerger took place on January 1 , 2006 , leaving 15 municipalities on the island , including Montreal . De @-@ merged municipalities remain affiliated with the city through an agglomeration council that collects taxes from them to pay for numerous shared services . The 2002 mergers were not the first in the city 's history . Montreal annexed 27 other cities , towns , and villages beginning with Hochelaga in 1883 with the last prior to 2002 being Pointe @-@ aux @-@ Trembles in 1982 . 
 The 21st century has brought with it a revival of the city 's economic and cultural landscape . The construction of new residential skyscrapers , two super @-@ hospitals ( the Centre <unk> de l 'Université de Montreal and McGill University Health Centre ) , the creation of the Quartier des Spectacles , reconstruction of the <unk> Interchange , reconfiguration of the <unk> and Dorval interchanges , construction of the new Réseau <unk> <unk> , gentrification of <unk> , subway line extensions and the purchase of new subway cars , the complete revitalization and expansion of Trudeau International Airport , the completion of Quebec Autoroute 30 , the reconstruction of the Champlain Bridge , and the construction of a new toll bridge to Laval are helping Montreal continue to grow . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Montreal is in the southwest of the province of Quebec . The city covers most of the Island of Montreal at the confluence of the Saint Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers . The port of Montreal lies at one end of the Saint Lawrence Seaway , the river gateway that stretches from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic . Montreal is defined by its location between the Saint Lawrence river to its south and the Rivière des Prairies to its north . The city is named after the most prominent geographical feature on the island , a three @-@ head hill called Mount Royal , topped at 232 m above sea level . 
 Montreal is at the centre of the Montreal Metropolitan Community , and is bordered by the city of Laval to the north ; Longueuil , Saint @-@ Lambert , Brossard , and other municipalities to the south ; <unk> to the east and the West Island municipalities to the west . The anglophone enclaves of Westmount , Montreal West , Hampstead , Côte Saint @-@ Luc , the Town of Mount Royal and the francophone enclave Montreal East are all surrounded by Montreal . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Montreal is classified as a humid continental climate ( Köppen climate classification : Dfb ) . 
 Summers are , on the whole , warm and humid with a daily maximum average of 26 to 27 ° C ( 79 to 81 ° F ) in July ; temperatures in excess of 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) are common . Conversely , cold fronts can bring crisp , drier and windy weather in the early and later parts of summer . 
 Winter brings cold , snowy , windy , and , at times , icy weather , with a daily average ranging from − 9 to − 10 @.@ 5 ° C ( 16 to 13 ° F ) in January . However , some winter days rise above freezing , allowing for rain on an average of 4 days in January and February each . Usually , snow covering some or all bare ground lasts on average from the first or second week of December until the last week of March . While the air temperature does not fall below − 30 ° C ( − 22 ° F ) every year , the wind chill often makes the temperature feel this low to exposed skin . 
 Spring and fall are pleasantly mild but prone to drastic temperature changes ; spring even more so than fall . Late season heat waves as well as " Indian summers " are possible . Early and late season snow storms can occur in November and March , and more rarely in April . Montreal is generally snow free from April 15 to November 15 . 
 The lowest temperature in Environment Canada 's books was − 37 @.@ 8 ° C ( − 36 ° F ) on January 15 , 1957 , and the highest temperature was 37 @.@ 6 ° C ( 100 ° F ) on August 1 , 1975 , both at Dorval International Airport . 
 Before modern weather record keeping ( which dates back to 1871 for McGill ) , a minimum temperature almost 5 degrees lower was recorded at 7 a.m. on January 10 , 1859 , where it registered at − 42 ° C ( − 44 ° F ) . 
 Annual precipitation is around 1 @,@ 000 mm ( 39 in ) , including an average of about 210 cm ( 83 in ) of snowfall , which occurs from November through March . Thunderstorms are common in the period beginning in late spring through summer to early fall ; additionally , tropical storms or their remnants can cause heavy rains and gales . Montreal averages 2 @,@ 050 hours of sunshine annually , with summer being the sunniest season , though slightly wetter than the others in terms of total precipitation — mostly from thunderstorms . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 For over a century and a half , Montreal was the industrial and financial centre of Canada . This legacy has left a variety of buildings including factories , elevators , warehouses , mills , and refineries , that today provide an invaluable insight into the city 's history , especially in the downtown area and the Old Port area . There are 50 National Historic Sites of Canada , more than any other city . 
 Some of the city 's earliest still @-@ standing buildings date back to the late 16th and early 17th centuries . Although most are clustered around the Old Montreal area , such as the Sulpician Seminary adjacent to Notre Dame Basilica that dates back to 1687 , and Chateau Ramezay , which was built in 1705 , you can find important examples of early colonial architecture dotted throughout the city . Situated in Lachine , the Le Ber @-@ Le Moyne House is the oldest complete building in the city . In Point St. Charles visitors can see the Maison Saint @-@ Gabriel , which can trace its history back to 1698 . There are many historic buildings in Old Montreal in their original form : Notre Dame of Montreal Basilica , Bonsecours Market , and the impressive 19th ‑ century headquarters of all major Canadian banks on St. James Street ( French : Rue Saint Jacques ) . Montreal 's earliest buildings are characterized by their uniquely French influence and grey stone construction . 
 Saint Joseph 's Oratory , completed in 1967 , Ernest Cormier 's Art Deco Université de Montréal main building , the landmark Place Ville Marie office tower , the controversial Olympic Stadium and surrounding structures , are but a few notable examples of the city 's 20th @-@ century architecture . Pavilions designed for the 1967 International and Universal Exposition , popularly known as Expo 67 , featured a wide range of architectural designs . Though most pavilions were temporary structures , several have become landmarks , including Buckminster Fuller 's geodesic dome U.S. Pavilion , now the Montreal Biosphere , and Moshe Safdie 's striking Habitat 67 apartment complex . 
 The Montreal Metro has public artwork by some of the biggest names in Quebec culture . 
 In 2006 Montreal was named a UNESCO City of Design , only one of three design capitals of the world ( the others being Berlin and Buenos Aires ) .

The borough also comprises most of Mount Royal Park , Saint Helen 's Island , and Notre @-@ Dame Island . 
 The Plateau Mount Royal borough was a working class francophone area . The largest neighbourhood is the Plateau ( not to be confused with the whole borough ) , which is undergoing considerable gentrification , and a 2001 study deemed it as Canada 's most creative neighbourhood because artists comprise 8 % of its labour force . The neighbourhood of Mile End in the northwestern part of the borough , has been a very multicultural area of the city , and features two of Montreal 's well @-@ known bagel establishments , St @-@ <unk> Bagel and Fairmount Bagel . The McGill Ghetto is in the extreme southwestern portion of the borough , its name being derived from the fact that it is home to thousands of McGill University students and faculty members .

 The first cross on the mountain was placed there in 1643 by Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve , the founder of the city , in fulfilment of a vow he made to the Virgin Mary when praying to her to stop a disastrous flood . Today , the mountain is crowned by a 31 @.@ 4 m @-@ high ( 103 ft ) illuminated cross , installed in 1924 by the John the Baptist Society and now owned by the city . It was converted to fibre optic light in 1992 . The new system can turn the lights red , blue , or purple , the last of which is used as a sign of mourning between the death of the Pope and the election of the next .

 = = Transportation = = 
 Like many major cities , Montreal has a problem with vehicular traffic congestion . Commuting traffic from the cities and towns in the West Island ( such as Dollard @-@ des @-@ <unk> and Pointe @-@ Claire ) is compounded by commuters entering the city that use twenty @-@ four road crossings from numerous off @-@ island suburbs on the North and South Shores . The width of the Saint Lawrence River has made the construction of fixed links to the south shore expensive and difficult .

The Metro system has long had a station on the South Shore in Longueuil , and in 2007 was extended to the city of Laval , north of Montreal , with three new stations . 
 The commuter rail system is managed and operated by the Agence <unk> de transport , and reaches the outlying areas of Greater Montreal with six lines . It carried an average of 79 @,@ 000 daily passengers in 2014 , making it the sixth busiest in North America following New York , Chicago , Boston , Philadelphia , and Toronto . 
 On April 22 , 2016 , a new planned automated rapid transit system , the Réseau <unk> <unk> , was unveiled . The 67 @-@ kilometre @-@ long ( 42 mi ) network , consisting of four branches and 24 stations , is planned to be completed by late 2020 and will be the third largest automated rapid transit network , after the Dubai Metro and the Vancouver Skytrain . Most of it will be financed by pension fund manager Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec .

 Montreal has two international airports , one for passengers only , the other for cargo . Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport ( also known as Dorval Airport ) in the City of Dorval serves all commercial passenger traffic and is the headquarters of Air Canada and Air Transat . To the north of the city is Montreal Mirabel International Airport in Mirabel , which was envisioned as Montreal 's primary airport but which now serves cargo flights along with <unk> and general aviation and some passenger services . In 2015 , Trudeau was the third busiest airport in Canada by passenger traffic and fourth by aircraft movements , handling 15 @.@ 5 million passengers , and 232 @,@ 648 aircraft movements . With 60 @.@ 8 % of its passengers being on non domestic flights it has the largest percentage of international flights of any Canadian airport . Trudeau airport is served by 40 carriers to over 100 destinations worldwide . 
 Airlines serving Trudeau offer flights to Europe , the United States , Western Asia , the Middle East , Central America , the Caribbean , Africa , Mexico and other destinations within Canada and it contains the largest duty @-@ free shop in North America .

 Montreal @-@ based VIA Rail provides rail service to other cities in Canada , particularly to Quebec City and Toronto along the Quebec City – Windsor Corridor . Amtrak , the U.S. national passenger rail system , operates its Adirondack daily to New York . All intercity trains and most commuter trains operate out of Central Station . 
 Canadian Pacific Railway ( CPR ) , headquartered in Calgary , Alberta , was founded here in 1881 . Its corporate headquarters occupied Windsor Station at 910 Peel Street until 1995 . With the Port of Montreal kept open year round by icebreakers , lines to Eastern Canada became surplus , and now Montreal is the railway 's eastern and intermodal freight terminus . CPR connects at Montreal with the Port of Montreal , the Delaware and Hudson Railway to New York , the Quebec Gatineau Railway to Quebec City and Buckingham , the Montreal , Maine and Atlantic Railway to Halifax , and CN Rail . The CPR 's flagship train , The Canadian , ran daily from Windsor Station to Vancouver , but all passenger services have since been transferred to VIA Rail Canada and the Canadian terminates in Toronto . 
 Montreal @-@ based Canadian National Railways ( CN ) was formed during in 1919 by the Canadian government following a series of country @-@ wide rail bankruptcies . It was formed from the Grand Trunk , Midland and Canadian Northern Railways , and has risen to become CPR 's chief rival in freight carriage in Canada . Like the CPR , CN has divested itself of passenger services in favour of Via Rail Canada . CN 's flagship train , the Super Continental , ran daily from Central Station to Vancouver , but after it was transferred to Via it was eliminated in 1990 .

 = The Rage Against God = 
 The Rage Against God ( subtitle in US editions : How Atheism Led Me to Faith ) is the fifth book by Peter Hitchens , first published in 2010 . The book describes Hitchens 's journey from atheism , far left politics , and bohemianism , to Christianity and conservatism , detailing the influences on him that led to his conversion . The book is partly intended as a response to God Is Not Great , a book written by his brother Christopher Hitchens in 2007 . 
 Peter Hitchens , with particular reference to events which occurred in the Soviet Union , argues that his brother 's verdict on religion is misguided , and that faith in God is both a safeguard against the collapse of civilisation into moral chaos and the best antidote to what he views as the dangerous idea of earthly perfection through utopianism . The Rage Against God received a mostly favourable reception in the media . Hitchens was praised for making a forceful and intelligent case , in particular with respect to questions concerning morality and God . Some critics contended that the author was misguided in claiming that state atheism would lead to totalitarianism . 
 = = Background = = 
 In May 2009 The Rage Against God was anticipated by Michael Gove , who wrote in The Times : 
 I long to see [ Peter Hitchens ] take the next stage in his writer 's journey and examine , with his unsparing honesty , the rich human reality of the division he believes is now more important than the split between Left and Right — the deeper gulf between the restless progressive and the Christian pessimist . This division , the difference between Prometheus and St Paul , the chasm that divides Shelley from T. S. Eliot , Lloyd George from Lord Salisbury , is nowhere better encapsulated than in the contrast between Hitchens major and minor . 
 Hitchens first referred to The Rage Against God in August 2009 , in one of his weekly columns : " Above all , I seek to counter the assertion , central to my brother 's case ... that the Soviet regime was in fact religious in character . This profound misunderstanding of the nature of the USSR is the key to finding another significant flaw in what is in general his circular argument " . Then , a week before the book 's publication , Hitchens wrote : " ... it is obvious much of what I say [ in The Rage Against God ] arises out of my attempt to debate religion with him [ Christopher Hitchens ] , it would be absurd to pretend that much of what I say here is not intended to counter or undermine arguments he presented in his book , God Is Not Great ... " . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 = = = Part One : A Personal Journey Through Atheism = = = 
 In Chapter 1 Hitchens describes abandoning religion in his youth , and promoting " cruel revolutionary rubbish " as a Trotskyist activist . He claims his generation had become intellectually aloof from religion , rebellious and disillusioned and in Chapter 2 explores further reasons for this disillusion , including the Suez Crisis and the Profumo Affair . In Chapter 3 , Hitchens recounts how he embraced scientific inquiry and adopted liberal positions on issues such as marriage , abortion , homosexuality , and patriotism . Chapter 4 is a lament for the " noble austerity " of his childhood in Britain . Chapter 5 explores what Hitchens views as the pseudo @-@ religion surrounding Churchill and World War II heroes – a " great cult of noble , patriotic death " whose only equivalent , he claims , was in the Soviet Union . Hitchens then asserts that , " The Christian Church has been powerfully damaged by letting itself be confused with love of country and the making of great wars " . In Chapter 6 Hitchens recalls being a foreign correspondent in the Soviet Union and a trip to Mogadishu , and how these experiences convinced him that , " his own civilisation was infinitely precious and utterly vulnerable " . In Chapter 7 Hitchens charts his return to Christianity , and makes particular reference to the experience of seeing the Rogier van der Weyden painting The Last Judgement : " I gaped , my mouth actually hanging open . These people did not appear remote or from the ancient past ; they were my own generation ... I had absolutely no doubt I was among the damned " . In Chapter 8 Hitchens examines the diminishing of Christianity in Britain and its potential causes . 
 = = = Part Two : Addressing Atheism : Three Failed Arguments = = = 
 In Chapter 9 , Hitchens contends that the claim that religion is a source of conflict is a " cruel factual misunderstanding " , and that a number of conflicts , including The Troubles and the Arab – Israeli conflict , were not motivated by religion but tribal in nature and disputes over territory . Chapter 10 discusses whether morality can be determined without the concept of God . Hitchens asserts that atheists " have a fundamental inability to concede that to be effectively absolute , a moral code needs to be beyond human power to alter " . He also describes as flawed his brother 's assertion in God is Not Great that " the order to love thy neighbour ' as thyself ' is too extreme and too strenuous to be obeyed " . Hitchens ends the chapter by stating , " in all my experience in life , I have seldom seen a more powerful argument for the fallen nature of man , and his inability to achieve perfection , than those countries in which man sets himself up to replace God with the State " . Hitchens begins Chapter 11 by asserting , " those who reject God 's absolute authority , preferring their own , are far more ready to persecute than Christians have been ... Each revolutionary generation reliably repeats the savagery " . He cites as examples the French revolutionary terror ; the Bolshevik revolution ; the Holodomor and the Soviet famine of 1932 – 33 ; the barbarity surrounding Joseph Stalin 's five @-@ year plans , repeated in the Great Leap Forward in China ; atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge ; and human rights abuses in Cuba under Fidel Castro . Hitchens then quotes a number of prominent communist thinkers ' pronouncements on morality , including George Lukacs stating , " Communist ethics make it the highest duty to accept the necessity of acting wickedly . This is the greatest sacrifice the revolution asks from us " , and Leon Trotsky 's claiming that " morality , more than any other form of ideology , has a class character " . 
 = = = Part Three : The League of the Militant Godless = = = 
 Hitchens writes " the biggest fake miracle staged in human history was the claim that the Soviet Union was a new civilisation of equality , peace , love , truth , science and progress . Everyone knows that it was a prison , a slum , a return to primitive barbarism , a kingdom of lies where scientists and doctors feared offending the secret police , and that its elite were corrupt and lived in secret luxury " . He then cites Walter Duranty 's denying the existence of the great Ukrainian famine , and Sidney and Beatrice Webb 's acceptance that the 1937 Moscow show trials were " genuine criminal prosecutions " . Hitchens then examines Lenin 's suppression of religion in the Soviet Union , which included making the teaching of religion to children punishable by the death penalty and the creation of an antireligious organisation of Soviet workers . Hitchens begins Chapter 13 by quoting William Henry Chamberlin : " In Russia , the world is witnessing the first effort to destroy completely any belief in supernatural interpretation of life " , and then examines some consequences of this , including intolerance of religion , terror , and the persecution of priests and bishops at the <unk> concentration camp . Hitchens asserts that in the Soviet Union " the regime 's institutional loathing for the teaching of religion , and its desire to eradicate it , survived every doctrinal detour and swerve " . In the final chapter , Hitchens analyses a number of his brother 's arguments , and contends that " the coincidence in instinct , taste , and thought between my brother and the Bolsheviks and their sympathisers is striking and undeniable " . He then records how his brother nominated the " apostle of revolutionary terror " Leon Trotsky for an edition of the BBC radio series Great Lives ; praised Trotsky for his " moral courage " ; and declared that one of Lenin 's great achievements was " to create a secular Russia " . Hitchens speculates that his brother remained sympathetic towards Bolshevism and is still hostile towards the things it extirpated , including monarchy , tradition , and faith . He ends the chapter by claiming a form of militant secularism is becoming established in Britain , and that " The Rage Against God is loose " . 
 = = = Epilogue = = = 
 In the epilogue , Hitchens describes how after a 2008 debate with Christopher Hitchens " the longest quarrel of my life seemed to be unexpectedly over " and that he held no hope of converting his brother , who had " bricked himself up high in his atheist tower , with slits instead of windows from which to shoot arrows at the faithful " . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 After its UK publication in March 2010 the book received a number of mostly favourable reviews in British newspapers . 
 In The Daily Telegraph Christopher Howse concentrated on the moral arguments in the book , and agreed with Hitchens that " to determine what is right and what is wrong without God , is difficult " . Also in The Daily Telegraph , Charles Moore wrote that the book " tries to do two things at once . One is to bash up modern militant atheism with all the author 's polemical skill . The other is to give an autobiographical account of how , in our time , an intelligent man 's faith may recover " . In a positive review in Standpoint magazine , Michael Nazir Ali wrote , " One of the abiding canards nailed by Peter Hitchens is that religion causes conflict . He does this by showing that so @-@ called " religious " wars had many other elements to them , such as greed for territory , political ambition and nationalism . His repeated references to Soviet brutality reveal that secular ideologies have caused more suffering in recent times than any conflict associated with religion . " In a more critical review in the New Statesman Sholto Byrnes wrote , " Hitchens makes his case forcefully , passionately and intelligently " , but " makes too much connection between the ill deeds of atheists and their atheism " . Byrnes also reviewed the book in The Independent , where he questioned the validity of a number of Hitchens 's conclusions , including that " atheists ' actively wish for disorder and meaninglessness ' " . In a sympathetic review in The Guardian , Rupert Shortt wrote , " Hitchens does not seek to mount a comprehensive defence of Christianity . He is wise to avoid deeper philosophical and theological waters , because his strengths lie elsewhere . His more manageable aim is to expose what he holds to be three major fallacies underlying God Is Not Great : that conflict fought in the name of religion is really always about faith ; that " it is ultimately possible to know with confidence what is right and what is wrong without acknowledging the existence of God " ; and that " atheist states are not actually atheist " . In The Spectator , Quentin Letts reviewed the book very positively , describing it as " a magnificent , sustained cry against the aggressive secularism taking control of our weakened culture " . 
 Reviews of the book in North American publications subsequent to its stateside release were more mixed . 
 In The New York Times , Mark Oppenheimer commented , " American readers will notice a lack of enthusiasm in Peter 's Christian apologetics . He proceeds largely from historical , rather than personal , evidence : here are the fruits of Christianity , and here is what one finds in its absence " . In a negative review in the Winnipeg Free Press , Ted St. Godard wrote , " What Hitchens can 't seem to appreciate is that , even if ' Soviet Communism is organically linked to atheism , something his brother and others argue against ( if somewhat feebly ) , and even if one accepts that Soviet tyranny was horrible , this says little about the existence of God " . In a The Washington Times review entitled " Cain and Abel : The sequel ? " , Jeremy Lott wrote , " Hitchens refuses to make a full @-@ throated case for faith . He explains that ' those who choose to argue in prose ... are unlikely to be receptive to a case that is most effectively couched in poetry ' ... Peter does hope that Christopher might one day arrive at some sort of acceptance that belief in God is not necessarily a character fault — and that religion does not poison everything " . 
 One mix of the two audiences is the British writer , Theodore Dalrymple , reviewing The Rage Against God and Christopher Hitchens ' Hitch @-@ 22 for the American journal , First Things . Dalrymple writes , Peter Hitchens " has discovered that it is he , and not just the world , that was and is imperfect and that therefore humility is a virtue , even if one does not always live up to it . The first sentence of his first chapter reads , “ I set fire to my Bible on the playing fields of my Cambridge boarding school one bright , windy spring afternoon in 1967 . ” One senses the deep — and , in my view , healthy — feeling of self @-@ disgust with which he wrote this , for indeed it describes an act of wickedness . Peter ’ s memoir ... is more personally searching . "

 = So Far , So Good ... So What ! = 
 So Far , So Good ... So What ! is the third studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth . It was released on January 19 , 1988 through Capitol Records ; a remixed and remastered edition including several bonus tracks was reissued in August 2004 . It is the band 's only album recorded with drummer Chuck Behler and guitarist Jeff Young , both of whom were fired immediately after the subsequent tour . So Far , So Good ... So What ! features music performed at very fast tempos with technical ability ; lyrically , frontman and guitarist Dave Mustaine addresses a variety of topics , including nuclear holocaust and freedom of speech . 
 The record was well received among contemporary music critics , although retrospective analysis has been less favorable . It managed to enter the top 30 on the Billboard 200 with no commercial radio play ; it charted in several other countries as well . The album was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and indicated Megadeth 's forthcoming emergence from the underground scene . 
 = = Background and production = = 
 Guitarist Chris Poland and drummer Gar Samuelson had been expelled from the band following the conclusion of the Peace Sells tour for disruptive behavior , including Poland 's habit of pawning band equipment to pay for drugs . Samuelson was immediately replaced by his drum technician , Chuck Behler . However , a new guitarist would take longer to emerge . At first , the band hired guitarist Jay Reynolds from the band Malice , but Reynolds was not up to the task of recording , and was subsequently replaced by his guitar teacher , Jeff Young . Dave Mustaine has since stated his regret for the way he handled Reynolds 's firing . 
 Work on the album started while Reynolds was in the band , but continued after the induction of Young . To mix the album , the label turned to Paul Lani , who previously had remixed the band 's previous album , Peace Sells ... but Who 's Buying ? . Mustaine was initially skeptical , but later became very irate with Lani 's " eccentricities " and his way of handling things . To mix the album , Lani relocated himself and Mustaine to Bearsville Studios , near Woodstock , New York , ostensibly for the purpose of inspiration . Mustaine decided he had had enough when he , having just awakened and made coffee , noticed Lani outside in his underwear feeding an apple to a deer . Mustaine flew back to Los Angeles later that day and fired Lani , who was replaced by Michael Wagener . Mustaine has since criticized Wagener 's " pedestrian " mixing efforts , citing the album 's " muddy feel " , in particular . Mustaine was able to recruit Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones to perform guitar parts on " Anarchy in the UK " . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 According to music critic J. D. Considine of Spin , So Far , So Good ... So What ! displays music performed at " volumes approaching the threshold of pain " . The album features fast guitar solos , multiple tempo changes and technical dexterity . Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic observed that the album offers the classic " take no prisoners " style which is commonly associated with Megadeth ; however , he noted that the sound does not differ much from the other underground metal bands from that period . Jim Farber of Rolling Stone called Mustaine 's vocals " bloodthirsty " and praised the musicianship for keeping rhythmic pace even at the " most anarchic moments " . Los Angeles Times journalist Dennis Hunt noted that the music was filled with extensive and " torrid " instrumentals and described Mustaine 's singing as a combination of extreme shrieking and screaming . Despite the positive overview , " Anarchy in the U.K. " received some negative criticism , partially because it was perceived to lack the rebelliousness of the original version . 
 The lyrical themes on the album explore a variety of subjects , from nuclear holocaust ( " Set the World Afire " ) to revisionism and censorship ( " Hook in Mouth " ) . Still , the majority of the songs are accompanied by the same sentiment of disillusion and nihilism as their previous two albums . Unlike traditional topics related to heavy metal music , the song " In My Darkest Hour " contains emotional lyrics which deal with loneliness and isolation . Dave Mustaine revealed that he tried to write about subject matters that were in touch with reality , including social issues and taboo topics . The lyrics on Megadeth 's cover of " Anarchy in the U.K. " were slightly mistaken because Mustaine claimed he had heard them incorrectly . 
 = = Songs = = 
 The album 's first track , " Into the Lungs of Hell " , is an instrumental composition which features synthesized horns , winds and percussion . " Set the World Afire " is the first song Dave Mustaine wrote for Megadeth after being fired from Metallica . He was a member of Metallica from 1982 – 83 , and was dismissed just before Metallica recorded its debut album Kill ' Em All . He later said that he wrote the lyrics during his journey home from the departure . Inspiration for the song came from a newspaper he read while on the bus back to California . Originally intended to be titled " <unk> " , Mustaine later decided to use the name , minus the " a " in " death , " for the band instead . " Anarchy in the U.K. " is a Sex Pistols cover , which quickly became a staple of the band 's live set . Over the years , the song was dropped from the set list because of its anti @-@ Christian viewpoint . " Mary Jane " tells a story about a young witch buried alive by her father near the Loon Lake cemetery in Minnesota . According to the legend , anyone who dared to disturb her grave was doomed to a prompt death . The song features descending guitar lines and begins with Mustaine summoning her spirit during the introduction . 
 " 502 " is about driving fast cars . " In My Darkest Hour " was written by Mustaine shortly after the death of Metallica bassist Cliff Burton . Mustaine had found out through word of mouth , as his former band mates never contacted him about the tragic event that occurred in Europe . He later recalled that he was extremely unhappy that day and wrote the song in one sitting . " Liar " is a rant directed at past member Chris Poland . " Hook in Mouth " declaims censorship and the Parents Music Resource Center ( PMRC ) . Mustaine elaborated that the lyrics were aimed at those who were " f * * * ing around with our constitutional rights and trying to take away our freedom of speech " .

 The album received positive feedback from music critics at the time of its release . In a contemporary review , Holger Stratmann from Rock Hard hailed the album as " the new masterpiece of Megadeth " and asserted that the band had created a great follow @-@ up to their highly acclaimed Peace Sells ... but Who 's Buying ? Jim Farber of Rolling Stone also gave the album a favorable review , saying it propelled the group " right at the top of the thrash @-@ rock heap " . He concluded his review by saying , " amid today 's narcoleptic pop scene , albums like So Far , So Good ... So What ! offer a disruptive noise that 's welcome indeed " . Writing for Spin , J. D. Considine felt that the record showed a " genuine maturity " for the band . Robert Christgau reacted enthusiastically towards the album and wrote that Megadeth garnered " its modest portions of profit and respect " with their latest studio release . He gave special praise to " Anarchy in the U.K. " , commenting that Mustaine covers the Sex Pistols " like a champ " . 
 Retrospective reviews , however , tend to be more critical of the album . AllMusic 's Steve Huey criticized the album for lacking " the conceptual unity and musical bite " of its predecessor . According to him , the album " wants to sound threatening but mostly comes off as forced and somewhat juvenile " , citing the cover track as an example . Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic opined that the record is " a fairly decent album , but not a great one " . He felt that apart from " Set the World Afire " and " Mary Jane " , the rest of the album " feels somewhat uninspired " . Conversely , Adrien Begrand from MSN Music opined that the record was " somehow ignored " in the band 's discography . 
 = = Touring = = 
 The tour that followed the album 's release was the first to feature new band members Chuck Behler and Jeff Young . Bassist David Ellefson said that previous members Gar Samuelson and Chris Poland were tired of constantly being on the road and their departure was inevitable . He further revealed that drummer Behler was appointed shortly before because the band feared that Samuelson would not be able to continue touring . However , some problems occurred during the Australian leg of the tour . The band was forced to cancel some of these shows because of drug issues . Mustaine claimed that the group returned home because guitarist Young " ran out of heroin " , which Young denied , stating that it was Mustaine who wanted to go back to Los Angeles and seek rehabilitation . Both Young and Behler were fired immediately after the end of the tour , in August 1988 . 
 Megadeth started performing the album 's songs live before the record was released . During 1987 they toured with other thrash metal bands such as Kreator and Overkill at a number of European venues . The following year Megadeth appeared with more established heavy metal acts such as Ronnie James Dio for some shows in North America . Later in 1988 the group made an appearance at the Monsters of Rock festival , but were dropped from the line @-@ up after one show . Dave Mustaine explained that the band toured quite often because they were not receiving much media exposure : " We do a lot of shows and sell records by word @-@ of @-@ mouth " . Los Angeles Times reported that So Far , So Good ... So What ! sold 400 @,@ 000 copies one month after its release , becoming Megadeth 's fastest selling album at that point . The record eventually went platinum and indicated Megadeth 's forthcoming emergence from the underground scene .

 = Barnstokkr = 
 In Norse mythology , Barnstokkr ( Old Norse , literally " child @-@ trunk " ) is a tree that stands in the center of King Völsung 's hall . Barnstokkr is attested in chapters 2 and 3 of the Völsunga saga , written in the 13th century from earlier tradition , partially based on events from the 5th century and the 6th century , where , during a banquet , a one @-@ eyed stranger appears and thrusts a sword into the tree which only Sigmund is able to pull free . Scholarly theories have been put forth about the implications of Barnstokkr and its relation to other trees in Germanic paganism . 
 = = Völsunga saga = = 
 Barnstokkr is introduced in chapter 2 of Völsunga saga where King Völsung is described as having " had an excellent palace built in this fashion : a huge tree stood with its trunk in the hall and its branches , with fair blossoms , stretched out through the roof . They called the tree <unk> [ r ] " . 
 In chapter 3 , King Völsung is holding a marriage feast for his daughter Signy and King Siggeir at King Völsung 's hall . At the hall , large fires are kindled in long hearths running the length of the hall , while in the middle of the hall stands the great tree Barnstokkr . That evening , while those attending the feast are sitting by the flaming hearths , they are visited by a one @-@ eyed , very tall man whom they do not recognize . The stranger is wearing a hooded , mottled cape , linen breeches tied around his legs , and is barefooted . Sword in hand , the man walks towards Barnstokkr and his hood hangs low over his head , gray with age . The man brandishes the sword and thrusts it into the trunk of the tree , and the blade sinks to its hilt . Words of welcome fail the crowd . 
 The tall stranger says that he who draws the sword from the trunk shall receive it as a gift , and he who is able to pull free the sword shall never carry a better sword than it . The old man leaves the hall , and nobody knows who he was , or where he went . Everyone stands , trying their hand at pulling free the sword from the trunk of Barnstokkr . The noblest attempt to pull free the sword first followed by those ranked after them . Sigmund , son of King Völsung , takes his turn , and — as if the sword had lay loose for him — he draws it from the trunk . The saga then continues . 
 = = Theories = = 
 Hilda Ellis Davidson draws links to the sword placed in Barnstokkr to marriage oaths performed with a sword in pre @-@ Christian Germanic societies , noting a potential connection between the carrying of the sword by a young man before the bride at a wedding as a phallic symbol , indicating an association with fertility . Davidson cites records of wedding ceremonies and games in rural districts in Sweden involving trees or " stocks " as late as the 17th century , and cites a custom in Norway " surviving into recent times " for " the bridegroom to plunge his sword into the roof beam , to test the ' luck ' of the marriage by the depth of the scar he made " . 
 Davidson points out a potential connection between the descriptor <unk> ( Old Norse " apple tree " ) and the birth of King Völsung , which is described earlier in the Völsunga saga as having occurred after Völsung 's father Rerir sits atop a burial mound and prays for a son , after which the goddess Frigg has an apple sent to Rerir . Rerir shares the apple with his wife , resulting in his wife 's long pregnancy . Davidson states that this mound is presumably the family burial mound , and proposes a link between the tree , fruit , mound , and the birth of a child . 
 Davidson opines that Siggeir 's anger at his inability to gain the sword that Odin has plunged into Barnstokkr at first sight appears excessive , and states that there may be an underlying reason for Siggeir 's passionate desire for the sword . Davidson notes that the gift of the sword was made at a wedding feast , and states that Barnstokkr likely represents the ' guardian tree ' , " such as those that used to stand beside many a house in Sweden and Denmark , and which was associated with the ' luck ' of the family " , and that the ' guardian tree ' also had a connection with the birth of children . Davidson cites Jan de Vries in that the name <unk> " used in this story was the name given to the trunk of such a tree because it used to be invoked and even clasped by the women of the family at the time of childbirth . " 
 Providing examples of historical structures built around trees , or with ' guardian trees ' around or in the structure in Germanic areas , Davidson states that the " ' luck ' of a family must largely depend on the successful bearing and rearing of sons , and there is a general belief that when a guardian tree is destroyed , the family will die out . " In connection with this , Davidson theorizes that at the bridal feast , it should have been Siggeir , the bridegroom , who drew the sword from the tree , " and that its possession would symbolize the ' luck ' which would come to him with his bride , and the successful continuation of his own line in the sons to be born of the marriage " . The sword having been refused to him , Davidson theorizes that this may well have been intended as a deadly insult , and that this lends a tragic air to the scene in the hall . 
 Jesse Byock ( 1990 ) states that the name Barnstokkr may not conceivably be the original name of the tree , and instead that it is possible that it may have originally been bran ( d ) <unk> , the first part of the compound potentially having been <unk> , ( meaning brand or firebrand ) , a word sometimes synonymous with " hearth " , and pointing to a potential connection to the fire burning within the hall . Byock notes that the tree is called an <unk> ( Old Norse " oak " ) , which has an unclear meaning as the Icelanders often employed the word as a general word for " tree " , and the tree is also referred to as <unk> , which is also a general term used to refer to trees . Byock theorizes that the latter reference to an apple tree may imply a further symbolic meaning pointing to the apple tree of the goddess Iðunn , and that the Barnstokkr may be further identified with the world tree Yggdrasil . 
 Andy Orchard ( 1997 ) states that the role and placement of Barnstokkr as a " mighty tree , supporting and sprouting through the roof of Völsung 's hall " has clear parallels in Norse mythology with the world tree Yggdrasil , particularly in relation to Yggdrasil 's position to the hall of Valhalla . Orchard further points out parallels between Sigurd 's ability to solely remove the sword from the trunk and King Arthur 's drawing of the sword Excalibur . 
 = = Modern influence = = 
 In Richard Wagner 's Der Ring des Nibelungen opera cycle , the tree appears as <unk> , when the hero Siegmund , with a great tug , pulls from it a sword that he names <unk> . The tree however is in the house of Hunding , who takes the place of Siggeir as husband of <unk> and enemy of Siegmund . Barnstokkr has been theorized as English author and philologist J. R. R. Tolkien 's immediate source for a scene in his 1954 work The Lord of the Rings depicting the fictional character of Frodo Baggins and his acceptance of the weapon Sting after it has been thrust " deep into a wooden beam " . Some of the structures described in Tolkien 's Lord of the Rings have been described as " recalling " the position and placement of Barnstokkr in Völsunga saga , which Tolkien was well familiar with .

On August 13 , 2006 , Highway 405 was dedicated the General Brock Parkway . The entire length of Highway 405 is patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police ( OPP ) . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Highway 405 serves to connect the northern end of I @-@ 190 in New York at the Lewiston – Queenston Bridge with the QEW , and as such it follows a somewhat direct path between the two . Throughout its length , the highway gently climbs the Niagara Escarpment , reaching the top east of Stanley Avenue before crossing the Niagara Gorge . The highway is surrounded by forest to either side for most of its length , and the only settlement near it is the village of Queenston . 
 Highway 405 begins by diverging from the QEW at St. Catharines . It continues north @-@ east for 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) , then gently curves south @-@ easterly . The opposing lanes , initially separated by a wide gap , converge towards each other to form a 15 @-@ metre ( 49 ft ) grass median . The highway dips into a shallow gully , widens to five lanes ( three eastbound , two westbound ) , and then curves northeast to pass north of a hydroelectric reservoir . The opposing lanes converge , with an Ontario Tall Wall separating them , and pass beneath Niagara Regional Road 102 ( Stanley Avenue ) . The freeway 's lone interchange is with Stanley Avenue , and traffic continuing east must cross the Lewiston – Queenston Bridge into the United States . The additional eastbound lane provided along this section is for the queueing of trucks . After passing the reservoir , the highway reaches the Canadian border plaza . It then passes over the Niagara Parkway and heads onto the Lewiston – Queenston Bridge over the Niagara River . The Highway 405 designation ends at the border with the United States , where it continues as I @-@ 190 towards Buffalo , New York . As Highway 405 entirely lies within the Province of Ontario and is not subject to federal administration , its entire length is patrolled by the OPP . 
 = = History = = 
 Highway 405 was part of a network of divided highways envisioned by Thomas McQuesten in the mid @-@ 1930s to connect New York with Ontario . Though the Queen Elizabeth Way would cross the Niagara River by 1942 in Niagara Falls , Highway 405 and the Lewiston – Queenston Bridge would form the first direct freeway link between the neighbouring countries . Planning for both was underway by 1958 , and construction began in 1960 . The bridge was built at the same time as the freeway , though it opened several months earlier on November 1 , 1962 . Highway 405 was completed in August 1963 and officially opened to the public on September 11 , 1963 . 
 In 1969 , an interchange with Stanley Avenue was built and opened to traffic . In 2004 , the eastern end of the freeway was modified to permit the queueing of trucks at the border . This included the addition of one lane to the eastbound carriageway beginning at Stanley Avenue , as well as the gradual removal of the interchange with the Niagara Parkway ; the westbound on @-@ ramp from the Parkway remained open to traffic until December 4 , 2006 . The highway was named the General Brock Parkway on October 13 , 2006 in honour of the War of 1812 hero , Major General Sir Isaac Brock , who died at the Battle of Queenston Heights .

 = Operation Backstop = 
 Operation Backstop was a United Nations Protection Force ( UNPROFOR ) military plan designed to guard a portion of the United Nations Protected Areas ( UNPAs ) against attack by the Croatian Army ( Hrvatska vojska – HV ) during the Croatian War of Independence . The operation , developed by the UNPROFOR staff in charge of the UNPA Western Slavonia ( Sector West ) in 1992 , was scheduled to be implemented by two mechanised companies of the Princess Patricia 's Canadian Light Infantry ( PPCLI ) battalion deployed in the area . 
 Although no HV attack occurred in the area during the UNPROFOR mandate , elements of the plan were used by the 3rd Battalion of the PPCLI as the HV clashed with the Army of the Republic of Serb Krajina ( ARSK ) in the January 1993 Operation Maslenica . The 2nd Battalion of the PPCLI implemented the plan in March 1993 to demonstrate UNPROFOR resolve . The UNPROFOR Sector West deputy commander considered the plan impractical except for deterrence , due to security concerns . 
 = = Background = = 
 In November 1991 Croatia , Serbia and the Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) agreed upon the Vance plan , designed to halt combat operations in the Croatian War of Independence and allow the negotiation of a political settlement . In addition to the ceasefire , the plan protected civilians in specific areas — designated as United Nations Protected Areas ( UNPAs ) — and UN peacekeepers in Croatia . The ceasefire went into effect on 3 January 1992 . Shortly after the Vance plan was accepted the European Community announced its decision to grant diplomatic recognition to Croatia on 15 January 1992 , and the <unk> and JNA @-@ held areas of Croatia were organised as the Republic of Serbian Krajina ( RSK ) . 
 Despite the Vance plan 's requirement for the immediate withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia , the JNA stayed behind for seven to eight months . When its troops eventually pulled out , the JNA transferred their equipment to the RSK . Because of organisational problems and breaches of the ceasefire , the UNPROFOR did not begin to deploy until 8 March and took two months to fully assemble in the UNPAs . The UNPROFOR was tasked with demilitarising the UNPAs , maintaining the ceasefire , monitoring local police and creating conditions for the return of internally displaced persons and refugees . These comprised more than 300 @,@ 000 Croats who were exiled from RSK @-@ controlled territory and 20 @,@ 000 Serbs who fled areas of western Slavonia captured by the Croatian Army ( Hrvatska vojska – HV ) in Operations Swath @-@ 10 , Papuk @-@ 91 and Hurricane @-@ 91 in late 1991 . 
 A portion of western Slavonia , encompassing an area approximately 90 by 45 kilometres ( 56 by 28 miles ) , was designated as the UNPA Western Slavonia ( or Sector West ) by the peace plan . Although unlike other UNPAs , the RSK controlled only about one @-@ third of the area — in the south , centred on the town of Okučani — the RSK @-@ held area included a section of the Zagreb – Belgrade motorway . Sector West was divided into four areas of responsibility ( AORs ) . The western portion of the motorway section and its surroundings were assigned to a Jordanian battalion of the UNPROFOR ( JORDBAT ) , and the area to the east ( containing the rest of the motorway within the UNPA and the town of Okučani ) was the AOR of a Nepalese battalion ( NEPBAT ) . To the north of the JORDBAT and NEPBAT AORs , a Canadian battalion ( CANBAT 1 ) AOR was established . The northernmost portion of Sector West became the AOR of an Argentine battalion ( <unk> ) . Unlike the Canadians , who had at their disposal 83 armoured personnel carriers , the Jordanian and Nepalese troops were equipped with small arms only . Sector West was commanded by Argentine Brigadier General Carlos Maria Zabala , and most of the staff work was assigned to the Canadians . The UNPROFOR established two storage depots for Army of the RSK ( ARSK ) heavy weapons , near Pakrac and in Stara Gradiška , and the HV moved its heavy weapons 30 kilometres ( 19 miles ) away from Sector West . Although the storage facilities were guarded by the UNPROFOR , the RSK was allowed access to maintain the weapons . 
 = = = Canadian order of battle = = = 
 CANBAT 1 initially included elements from the 1st Battalion of the Royal 22nd Regiment , the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Canadian Regiment ( RCR ) and the 8th Canadian Hussars under Lieutenant Colonel Michel Jones . Although lead elements of the unit reached Croatia on 8 April , it took two weeks for all the CANBAT 1 troops to arrive . In September 1992 , the CANBAT 1 troops were replaced by the 3rd Battalion of the Princess Patricia 's Canadian Light Infantry ( PPCLI ) . CANBAT 1 was headquartered in <unk> Barracks , between the towns of Pakrac and Daruvar . 
 = = Plan = = 
 The UNPROFOR operations staff in Sector West developed several defensive plans , assigning top priority to the plan codenamed Operation Backstop . It envisaged an active defence against the HV , assuming that the attack 's main axis would be the Zagreb – Belgrade motorway . CANBAT 1 ( supported by General Zabala ) thought the HV would attack Sector West to control the Zagreb – Belgrade motorway , and the UN would not object to such a move . Any Croatian attack in the area was likely to employ substantially larger forces than those earmarked for Operation Backstop . 
 CANBAT 1 was expected to deploy one mechanised company each to the JORDBAT and the NEPBAT AORs to position themselves defensively . The forces would attempt to deter the HV from advancing , demonstrate its resolve to defend Sector West , engage the HV with antitank weapons and mortars , protect the Jordanian and Nepalese withdrawal and withdraw under the protection of CANBAT 1 . The two companies required eight hours notice of the HV advance to reach their designated positions in time . Presumably , the ARSK would retrieve its heavy weapons from the UNPROFOR storage by force and resist the HV . 
 = = = Reaction to Operation Maslenica = = = 
 In January 1993 , when the HV launched Operation Maslenica ( which aimed to capture the Maslenica Bridge ) , Canadian troops acted in accordance with part of Operation Backstop . They dug in their positions , reinforcing the Nepalese troops for 72 hours and expecting an HV attack in Sector West . No reinforcements were deployed to the JORDBAT AOR , and the UNPROFOR prepared to blow up the only bridge across the Sava River ( linking Sector West and Bosnian Serb @-@ held territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina ) to prevent the Army of Republika Srpska from advancing into the area . 
 In response to Operation Maslenica , RSK president Goran Hadžić ordered the ARSK to retrieve its tanks from UN storage in Sector West and attack Nova Gradiška and Novska . When local RSK authorities ( led by Veljko Džakula in Sector West ) demanded an explanation of the order from Hadžić , he said that the Croatian forces were about to attack Okučani . On 26 January Zabala met with Džakula in Okučani and reassured him that the UNPROFOR would protect Sector West from a Croatian attack , agreeing to provide the RSK with a written guarantee to that effect . Although Hadžić accepted the assurance and cancelled the attack , the orders were reinstated and cancelled three more times over the next two days . On 7 February , Canadian troops drilled the deck of the bridge spanning the Strug Channel ( north of Stara Gradiška ) to place demolition charges . The move was protested by RSK authorities , who saw the route ( the only link between Okučani and Serb @-@ controlled territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina ) as crucial to an evacuation in the event of an anticipated Croatian attack . The situation calmed down by mid @-@ February , and the HV did not attack Sector West . 
 = = = Exercise = = = 
 The 2nd Battalion of the PPCLI replaced the 3rd Battalion in April as CANBAT 1 . The commander of the 2nd Battalion , Lieutenant Colonel Jim Calvin , instructed his troops to approach their tasks differently than the 3rd Battalion had . Calvin ( unlike his predecessor ) did not want the RSK forces or the HV to be aware of CANBAT 1 operations , ordering the battalion to observe radio silence . According to Canadian journalist Carol Off , Calvin was eager to fight and instructed his troops to return fire if necessary . The situation in Sector West deteriorated when Jordanian General Shabshough replaced Zabala in March . A major contribution to the deterioration was Shabshough 's minimal involvement with local authorities , in contrast to Zabala 's cooperative approach . 
 To reassure the Sector West Croatian Serb population , CANBAT 1 performed an Operation Backstop exercise and the tasks needed to evacuate NEPBAT in March or April 1993 . Afterwards , Canadian Sector West deputy commander Colonel K. C. Hague recommended that the plan be redesigned primarily as a means of deterrence . Hague felt that if Operation Backstop triggered an armed clash with the HV the UNPROFOR would be forced to withdraw through Croatia , exposing the peacekeepers to grave danger . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 According to Croatian political scientist Vladimir Filipović , it is unclear whether the limited resources earmarked for the operation and the unclear motivation of CANBAT 1 troops would stop several HV brigades ; according to Hague , the plan did not indicate how CANBAT 1 or the other elements of the UNPROFOR would retreat through Croatia after such a clash . Hague questioned the feasibility of Operation Backstop , because the advance @-@ warning requirement was considered impossible to meet . The UNPROFOR had no reliable military intelligence on HV movements outside the UNPAs , or beyond 30 @-@ kilometre ( 19 mi ) -wide zones around the UNPAs ( where only United Nations Military Observers were present ) . However , Hague considered Operation Backstop a deterrent . 
 Although Operation Backstop was within the UNPROFOR mandate ( since the peacekeepers were authorised to use force to prevent armed incursions into the UNPAs ) , Croatian authorities resented the operation . Croatia considered the UNPROFOR overzealous in defending the UNPAs and protecting the Serbs while failing to ensure the fulfilment of other aspects of the Vance plan , such as the return of refugees to their homes . 
 By September 1993 , CANBAT 1 was relocated from Sector West to Sector South ( northern Dalmatia and Lika ) . The <unk> mandate in Croatia expired on 31 March 1995 , and the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 981 establishing the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia ( UNCRO ) instead . Sector West was captured by the HV in Operation Flash in early May 1995 , with no resistance from UN peacekeepers . The main axis of the first day 's HV advance was the Zagreb – Belgrade motorway , as anticipated by the planners of Operation Backstop . 
 = Hurricane Marty ( 2003 ) = 
 Hurricane Marty was the deadliest tropical cyclone of the 2003 Pacific hurricane season . Forming on September 18 , it became the 13th tropical storm and fourth hurricane of the year . The storm moved generally northwestward and steadily intensified despite only a marginally favorable environment for development , and became a Category 2 hurricane before making two landfalls on the Baja California peninsula and mainland Mexico . 
 The hurricane was responsible for significant flooding and storm surges that caused $ 100 million ( 2003 USD ) in damage mostly on the peninsula of Baja California , and resulted in the deaths of 12 people . Marty affected many of the same areas that had been affected by Hurricane Ignacio a month earlier . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave moved into the Pacific Ocean from Central America on September 10 . Convection along the wave became better organized as it moved westward , and a tropical depression developed on September 18 . The depression moved generally west @-@ northwestward before strengthening into Tropical Storm Marty on September 19 . The storm entrained dry air into its circulation as it curved toward the northwest , disrupting the storm 's convective structure and inhibiting further intensification for the next two days . Eventually , Marty fought off the dry air and intensified , reaching hurricane strength on September 21 . 
 Marty began moving north @-@ northwestward in response to a high pressure ridge to the west , and continued to strengthen , reaching a peak intensity of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) early on September 22 . Marty then moved northward at an increased speed before making landfall 10 mi ( 15 km ) northeast of Cabo San Lucas in Baja California Sur later that day . After making landfall , Marty turned back to the north @-@ northwest , moving parallel to the eastern coast of the peninsula , and weakening to a tropical storm on September 23 . Marty then stalled over the Gulf of California after encountering a high pressure system over the U.S. state of Nevada , and further weakened to a tropical depression before making a second landfall near Puerto Peñasco , Sonora , on September 24 . Marty became a remnant low pressure area on September 25 , and moved erratically over the northern Gulf of California for the next two days before drifting southwestward and dissipating over the northern Baja California Peninsula on September 26 .

 Fearing a repeat of the damage left by Hurricane Ignacio a month earlier , many residents stocked up on supplies , secured their homes and evacuated to emergency shelters . The government of Mexico issued hurricane warnings for areas of the eastern coast of the Baja California Peninsula and the west coast of the mainland on September 21 . Tropical storm warnings were issued for the Mexican coastline to the Colorado River on September 23 , but were discontinued later that day . Forecasters also predicted that the hurricane might cause 4 – 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 8 m ) of storm surge , 8 inches ( 20 @.@ 3 cm ) of rain , serious flash flooding , and mudslides . Many schools and tourist destinations were used as emergency shelters and most seaports and airports were closed down . Across the Gulf of California , in the state of Sonora , authorities of the municipality of Empalme monitored the status of the Punta de Agua dam , located 20 mi ( 30 km ) upstream of the municipal seat , which threatened to overtop and flood the city . As a result , 300 residents were evacuated to shelters on higher ground .

Two more people died when a tree fell on a car in Sinaloa . Heavy rainfall caused moderate to severe flash flooding in Sonora and Sinaloa , although damage was not as severe or as extensive as on the Baja California peninsula . Los Mochis , Sinaloa , reported sustained winds of 45 mph ( 70 km / h ) on September 22 .

 The E3 Harelbeke starts and finishes in the city of Harelbeke in West Flanders . The principal difficulty in the race comes from the climbs – many of them cobbled – that appear in the 205 @-@ kilometre ( 127 mi ) route ; many of these climbs also appear in the Tour of Flanders , including the Oude Kwaremont and Paterberg . In 2016 , there were several changes to the route from previous years , with a shorter distance and fewer climbs ; Cycling Weekly suggested that these could make the race slightly easier than previous editions . 
 The route left Harelbeke to the southeast , crossing the Scheldt river at <unk> and proceeding through the outskirts of Oudenaarde . The first climb was the Katteberg after 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) ; there was then a flat section of cobbled road – the Paddestraat – before the roads turned to the east . The route passed to the north @-@ east of <unk> , then further east as far as <unk> with 65 kilometres ( 40 mi ) completed . Here the roads turned back to the west into the Flemish Ardennes . The second climb of the day was La Houppe , which came after 115 kilometres ( 71 mi ) ; the riders then continued into Ronse , the half @-@ way point of the race , for the cobbled climb of the Oude Kruisberg . There were then seven climbs in the following 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) : the <unk> , the <unk> , the Kortekeer , the Taaienberg ( cobbled ) , the Boigneberg , the Eikenberg ( cobbled ) and the <unk> ( cobbled ) . At this point there were 57 kilometres ( 35 mi ) and five classified climbs remaining . 
 The next climb , the <unk> came 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) later and was immediately followed by the Paterberg , the steepest climb of the day with 700 metres ( 770 yd ) of cobbled road at an average gradient of 12 % and sections of 20 % . This was then followed after 4 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) by the partially cobbled , 2 @.@ 2 @-@ kilometre ( 1 @.@ 4 mi ) climb of the Oude Kwaremont . The penultimate climb of the day was the Karnemelkbeekstraat , 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) from the finish . At this point , the route crossed back over the Scheldt and returned north @-@ west towards Harelbeke . The final climb , the Tiegemberg , came with 18 kilometres ( 11 mi ) remaining . The last part of the race was flat , with the final 3 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) a final loop through Harelbeke to the finish line .

 There were 25 teams selected to start the race . All 18 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited ; the race organisers also gave wildcard invitations to seven UCI Professional Continental teams . These included two Belgian teams ( Wanty – Groupe Gobert and Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) , two French teams ( Fortuneo – Vital Concept and Direct Énergie ) , an Italian team ( Wilier Triestina – Southeast ) , a Dutch team ( Roompot – Oranje Peloton ) and a German team ( Bora – Argon 18 ) .

 The 2015 champion , Team Sky 's Geraint Thomas , was not present to defend his title ; he was riding the 2016 Volta a Catalunya instead . Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff ) , who won the 2014 race , did start , as did Fabian Cancellara ( Trek – Segafredo ) , who had won the race on three occasions in the past , and Tom Boonen ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) , who held the record for the most victories with five . Cancellara was riding the race for the final time , having announced that the 2016 season would be his last as a professional , and was in strong form with victories in the Strade Bianche and a time @-@ trial stage of the 2016 Tirreno – Adriatico . Sagan , the reigning world champion , had also been performing strongly , but did not have any victories so far in 2016 . Boonen had not demonstrated any strong form . 
 Although Boonen had not shown strong form , he came to the race with a strong team . His teammates included Niki Terpstra , Zdeněk Štybar , Stijn Vandenbergh and Matteo Trentin , all of whom were possible winners of the race . Despite Thomas 's absence , Sky also brought a strong team : they had Ian Stannard , Luke Rowe and the former world champion Michał Kwiatkowski . Other possible victors included Sep Vanmarcke ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) , Alexander Kristoff ( Team Katusha ) , Edvald Boasson Hagen ( Dimension Data ) , Jürgen Roelandts ( Lotto – Soudal ) and Lars Boom ( Astana ) . Greg Van Avermaet would also have been among the favourites , but he was ruled out of the race due to illness .

 After 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) of racing , an eight @-@ man breakaway formed . The riders involved were Bert De Backer ( Giant – Alpecin ) , Antoine Demoitié ( Wanty – Groupe Gobert ) , Nico Denz ( AG2R La Mondiale ) , Tony Hurel ( Direct Energie ) , Sjoerd van Ginneken ( Roompot – Oranje Peloton ) , <unk> <unk> ( IAM Cycling ) , Jay Thomson ( Dimension Data ) , and Wouter Wippert ( Cannondale – Drapac ) . They extended their lead to five minutes with 55 kilometres ( 34 mi ) completed , but their advantage was reduced to less than four minutes by the efforts of Etixx – Quick @-@ Step in the peloton . It was reduced to less than two minutes by the time the riders reached the Taaienberg with 73 kilometres ( 45 mi ) remaining , as Trek put an effort into bringing the lead group back . 
 On the Taaienberg , Tiesj Benoot ( Lotto – Soudal ) led the peloton , with Boonen right behind him . A ten @-@ rider group broke away from the peloton over the climb , with Benoot and Boonen joined by Roelandts , Cancellara , Boom , Vanmarcke , Daniel Oss ( BMC ) and three other Etixx – Quick @-@ Step riders ( Terpstra , Štybar and Trentin ) . On the next climb , the Boigneberg , Cancellara 's rear derailleur failed and it took more than a minute for his team to bring him a replacement bike , putting him a long way behind the other favourites . Shortly afterwards , the breakaway was caught by the chasing group ; the combined group was then caught by another group that contained Sagan and Kwiatkowski to create a 20 @-@ man lead group , although Štybar soon suffered a puncture and fell out of the group . Cancellara , meanwhile , was in a group led by his teammates Yaroslav Popovych and Markel Irizar around two minutes behind . 
 By the time the race reached the Paterberg , the gap was around half a minute . On the climb , Cancellara attacked from the chasing group , with Štybar on his wheel ; meanwhile , a ten @-@ man group broke away from the leaders . After the Paterberg and the subsequent Oude Kwaremont , Cancellara and Štybar eventually reached this group . On the next hill , the Karnemelkbeekstraat , Sagan and Kwiatkowski attacked ; over the next 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) they extended their lead to over 20 seconds . This extended to 30 seconds on the Tiegemberg and reached 36 seconds on the final stretch to Harelbeke . The Etixx – Quick @-@ Step riders were forced to do all the work in the chasing group , as none of the other riders in the group would collaborate with them . 
 After a long effort from Terpstra , Boonen took up the effort on the front of the chasing group and the gap to Sagan and Kwiatkowski began to reduce . The gap fell to under 11 seconds with 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) remaining , but the leading pair were not caught . After going under the flamme rouge , Kwiatkowski manoeuvred Sagan to the front and surprised him by opening up his sprint with 300 metres ( 330 yd ) remaining . Sagan was unable to respond and Kwiatkowski took the race victory , with Sagan four seconds behind . The chasing group finished 11 seconds behind , with Stannard beating Cancellara in the sprint for third place .

 Kwiatkowski 's victory was his first since joining Team Sky at the beginning of 2016 . He said after the race that his main target was still the Ardennes classics rather than the remainder of the cobbled classics season , but that there was no reason why he could not succeed in both . He pointed out that he was glad to have escaped with Sagan as they worked well together – they had arrived at the finish of the 2014 Strade Bianche in a similar situation , with Kwiatkowski the winner there as well . He said that he thought he had surprised Sagan by sprinting first , rather than waiting for Sagan 's sprint . He also acknowledged that he knew from his own experience a year before that it was " very difficult " to race with the pressure of the world champion 's rainbow jersey . 
 Sagan revealed that he had been told on the radio that he had to ride hard to stay away from the chasing group , but that he had no power left in the final part of the race as he had done the majority of the work in the breakaway . Nevertheless , he said that he was happy with the race . Cancellara , meanwhile , said that , although he was disappointed with the result in itself , he had pride in the way he had performed in coming back from his mechanical failure . After his long pursuit , with the help of several teammates in different groups , he had barely been able to follow the other riders in the group on the Tiegemberg .

Seventeen other series were printed between August 1993 and January 1998 , including 1994 's Venom : Separation Anxiety ( which continued the story of Venom 's offspring and spawned the 1995 " Planet of the Symbiotes " cross @-@ series story arc ) , 1996 's Along Came a Spider ( which introduced symbiote anti @-@ hero Hybrid ) and 1997 's Venom : On Trial ( which saw Eddie Brock tried for his crimes as Venom ) . Larry Hama wrote the most individual series ( eight in total ) , including the 1997 final installment ( Venom : The Finale , which saw the symbiote apparently killed ) . According to editor Tom Brevoort , the series was cancelled because " The return on the book had declined to the point where any immediate financial reward was overshadowed by [ then editor @-@ in @-@ chief Bob <unk> 's ] discomfort with the character starring in his own title . " The limited @-@ series run consisted of 60 issues . 
 A new Venom series began in June 2003 , written by Daniel Way . This series followed a new character , Patricia Robertson , and a clone of the Venom symbiote . Eighteen issues were produced by Way through November 2004 , comprising the story arcs " Shiver " ( # 1 @-@ 5 ) , " Run " ( # 6 @-@ 10 ) , " Patterns " ( # 11 @-@ 13 ) , and " Twist " ( # 14 @-@ 18 ) . 
 In 2011 , an ongoing Venom series began under writer Rick Remender with Spider @-@ Man supporting character Flash Thompson in a leading role . The character regained the use of his legs while using the symbiote following their loss during his service in the Iraq War ( as shown in The Amazing Spider @-@ Man # 574 ) . The first issue introduced new versions of the villains Crime Master and Jack O 'Lantern , who became recurring antagonists for Thompson . Issue # 18 featured the return of Brock , who killed Hybrid and Scream in his crusade against the symbiotes and eventually bonded to the Toxin symbiote . The series was born after Thompson was first unveiled as the new Venom by writer Dan Slott in The Amazing Spider @-@ Man # 654 . Remender was unsure how to develop the Thompson narrative until he realized that he was a tragic hero : a violent man , haunted by a drinking problem and physical abuse suffered at the hands of his father . 
 Slott suggested that the new Crime Master 's secret identity would be Bennett Brant , the thought @-@ dead brother of Thompson 's then @-@ girlfriend Betty . Remender and his co @-@ writer Cullen Bunn developed the new character , with Bunn developing the idea of multiple Crime Masters existing throughout history . Thompson found an arch @-@ rival in the new Jack O 'Lantern , developed by Remender and artist Tony Moore . Remender decided that making him a parallel of Thompson would create a stronger nemesis ; therefore , Jack was also given a traumatic childhood in which he was exploited by Crime Master . Venom # 13 saw the first mini @-@ event of the series : a crossover with the Red Hulk , X @-@ 23 and the new Ghost Rider . The event was initially conceived as a reunion of New Fantastic Four members Hulk , Wolverine , Ghost Rider and Spider @-@ Man as part of a Venom @-@ Wolverine crossover . As the idea developed with writer Jason Aaron , it was decided to incorporate those characters ' legacy characters into the Red Hulk , X @-@ 23 , the new female Ghost Rider and Thompson 's Venom . Following the event , Thompson joined another Remender @-@ written book ( Secret Avengers ) . 
 Remender stopped writing Venom in August 2012 ( after issue # 22 ) to work on Captain America and the launch of Uncanny Avengers . He was replaced by Cullen Bunn , who had periodically worked as co @-@ writer during Remender 's term . The Venom character remained a member of the Secret Avengers , a series still written by Remender . In September 2012 , Bunn said that Thompson would be moved from New York to Philadelphia from Venom # 28 . This relocation would allow the introduction of a new love interest , the superhero Valkyrie . Editor Tom Brennan explained " His superhero career almost cost him everything ... this is a good man with a troubled past who needed a fresh start ... to take his next steps in becoming the hero he was born to be . " Marvel editor Stephen Wacker said the location change reflected Marvel 's desire to expand the Marvel universe beyond New York City . Bunn 's run introduced the new character Mania , one of Thompson 's students who is empowered by part of the Venom symbiote . In August 2013 , Marvel announced that Venom would end with issue # 42 in October 2013 . Bunn was informed of the decision while writing Venom # <unk> # 38 , which he stated gave him time to bring some plot threads to a conclusion , but having originally outlined thirty issues worth of stories , there would be some ideas left to be told .

 Following Remender 's departure from the series , co @-@ writer Cullen Bunn took over beginning with issue # 23 .

The mark gives Venom control over demons ; after a demon tries to possess him it becomes trapped in Thompson 's body , unable to leave or control him .

Venom # 23 ( November 2012 ) introduced a new supporting character in journalist Kate Kiernan . The 2012 story " Minimum Carnage " saw the series cross with Scarlet Spider to feature Venom and Scarlet Spider against an escaped Carnage in the <unk> . The story concludes with Carnage defeated and lobotomized by Scarlet Spider , leaving the Carnage symbiote in control of his body and Venom able to sense Carnage 's presence . The events of " Monsters of Evil " , " Minimum Carnage " and his fear of the symbiote controlling him prompt Thompson to move to Philadelphia in Venom # 27 @.@ 1 . Thompson is possessed by the demon inside him while he sleeps , and terrorizes people as Venom . 
 In Philadelphia , Thompson gains employment as a high school gym coach , while as Venom he comes into conflict with the U @-@ Foes , who kidnap and experiment on victims with alien technology . When the U @-@ Foes knock Venom , the demon takes control of his body and uses the alien technology to teleport the villains to their apparent death in space . Kiernan and Thompson 's lover Valkyrie later return home , leaving Venom alone . Brock returns as Toxin in Venom # 30 , to pursue Thompson while he himself is hunting the result of one of the U @-@ Foes experiments : an alien @-@ lifeform infested human turned into a cannibal . Thompson and Brock 's fight liberates the aliens who begin infecting and transforming other humans to target their new enemies : Venom and Toxin . Together , Thompson and Brock defeat the aliens , and afterwards Brock calls a truce with Thompson , promising that the Venom symbiote will inevitably take over Thompson , and that he will return to kill him when that happens . Venom # 39 sees the return of Jack , and the introduction of the new symbiote character Mania — Thompson 's teenage student Andi who bonds with a spawn of the Venom symbiote when Thompson uses it to protect her from Jack . Jack kills Mania 's father , and is revealed to be merely a man who was brainwashed by some of Jack 's technology into believing he is the real Jack . According to Bunn , when he envisioned a new symbiote character Andi was not intended to be the host , but as the series progressed his plans changed . It is revealed that Mania 's symbiote is the cloned symbiote from Way 's 2003 Venom series . The symbiote expelled the clone , and the demonic brand along with it , passing it to Mania . When a team led by Crossbones starts killing the brand bearers and taking the brands for themselves , Venom and Mania manage to fight them off with assistance from Mephisto . Mephisto then departs after telling Thompson that the deal he made in exchange for the brand was with the symbiote , not Thompson .

 " Billy Boys " , also titled " The Billy Boys " , is a loyalist song from Glasgow , sung to the tune of " Marching Through Georgia . " It originated in the 1930s as the signature song of one of the Glasgow razor gangs led by Billy Fullerton and later became viewed to reflect the long running sectarian divide in the city . It is associated in particular with Rangers F.C .. 
 = = Origins = = 
 Billy Boys originated in the 1920s as the signature tune of the Brigton Boys , also called The Billy Boys of Brigton Cross , who were a Protestant street gang in Glasgow led by Billy Fullerton . The gang often clashed with Catholic gangs such as the Norman Conks . Fullerton was a former member of the British Fascists who was awarded a medal for strike @-@ breaking during the 1926 General Strike and formed a Glasgow branch of the British Union of Fascists with the onset of World War II . The song 's geographic roots relate to Bridgeton Cross in Bridgeton , an area of Glasgow historically associated with the city 's Protestant population , and with Scottish unionism . Brigton is the Scots form of Bridgeton . The Billy Boys song was often sung loudly when the gang performed it . They regularly sang it when they marched through primarily Catholic areas of Glasgow on Catholic holy days . This often led to the Brigton Boys being attacked by members of the Norman Conks as a result . Despite being primarily based in Glasgow , in the 1930s the Brigton Boys were invited to march in Belfast and sang Billy Boys while they were there as part of The Twelfth celebrations . 
 The Brigton Boys and their youth wing , the Derry Boys , started to attend association football matches in the late 1920s and early 1930s . During this time , they attended Rangers matches and Rangers fans started to sing the Billy Boys song as part of a perceived affiliation with the Brigton Boys . 
 Despite Percy Sillitoe , the Chief Constable of Glasgow , eradicating the razor gangs in Glasgow and most young Protestants joining the Orange Order instead of the remaining gangs , Rangers fans continued to sing the Billy Boys in tribute to Fullerton as he still retained a prominent position among Glasgow Protestants even after the gangs had disbanded . The Orange Order then adopted the " Billy Boys " song and changed the lyrics to be played on Orange walks , with the references to Billy being altered to refer to King William III of England , Scotland and Ireland .

 Even after Fullerton 's death , Rangers fans continued to sing " Billy Boys " to commemorate Fullerton and the Brigton Boys . In later years , attempts were made to portray the song as being against Irish republicanism rather than Catholics . In 1999 , the Scotland national football team manager Craig Brown was filmed singing " Billy Boys " and faced calls to step down from his position in charge of the Scotland national football team . However the Scottish Football Association ( SFA ) gave him their backing . 
 The song was at the centre of a controversy surrounding " ninety @-@ minute bigots " , an expression allegedly coined by former Rangers chairman Sir David Murray : " Ninety @-@ minute <unk> do not hold beliefs but nonetheless sing songs at football matches which are sectarian , simply to join in with the rest of the crowd . " Rangers have adopted several measures to tackle this behaviour including attempts to bring older Rangers songs back into popular use , with Murray speaking out against the singing of the " Billy Boys " on many occasions . In 2006 , Rangers were charged by UEFA for discriminatory chanting over the singing of " Billy Boys " during a UEFA Champions League game against Villarreal . Rangers were found not guilty due to " Billy Boys " having been sung for years without the SFA or the Scottish government intervening against it and ruled that it was tolerated as a social and historic song . However after an appeal where they were warned , Rangers were ordered by UEFA to make a public announcement at all home games , prohibiting the singing of the song despite UEFA admitting they were unable to do anything about it because it was a Scottish social issue . In 2011 , " Billy Boys " was included in a list of chants that had been banned from Scottish football grounds as part of new legislation from the Scottish government . It was specifically banned because of its " Up to our knees in Fenian blood " line . It was banned because it was decided by the Scottish government that " Fenian " in the context of the song meant Roman Catholics and was thus sectarian despite Rangers fans stating that it meant Irish republicans or fans of their Old Firm rivals , Celtic . 
 Despite the ban , " Billy Boys " has still been sung at Rangers matches , including their match against Queen 's Park at Hampden Park . It is sometimes sung without the " Fenian " line but has also been sung in its original form . Other Scottish football clubs , among them Heart of Midlothian and Kilmarnock , use versions of " Billy Boys " adapted to support their own clubs . 
 = = = Northern Ireland = = = 
 The Billy Boys song has also been used in Northern Ireland , which may have arisen as a result of the Brigton Boys ' march in Belfast . It is often used by supporters of Belfast club Linfield due to historic links with Rangers as " Blues Brothers " . 
 The song was sung in 2013 by supporters of the Northern Ireland national football team during their match against Luxembourg at Stade <unk> Barthel in protest against the Northern Ireland team anthem , God Save the Queen , not being played at the Irish Cup final . In April 2014 , the Irish Football Association ( IFA ) introduced punishments for " any ... song or chant that is undeniably sectarian or offensive " . Linfield advised their supporters that this included all variations of Billy Boys , including the Marching Through Georgia tune . The IFA based their decision on the precedent from the UEFA decision regarding Billy Boys and Rangers in 2006 . There was doubt expressed by fans as to how the IFA would enforce the ban on the Marching Through Georgia tune if it was used in a song other than Billy Boys .

 = Washington State Route 4 = 
 State Route 4 ( SR 4 ) is a 62 @.@ 27 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 100 @.@ 21 km ) state highway , serving the southwestern region of the U.S. state of Washington . The highway , officially known as the Ocean Beach Highway , travels east along the Columbia River from U.S. Route 101 ( US 101 ) at Johnston 's Landing through Pacific , Wahkiakum and Cowlitz counties to an interchange with Interstate 5 ( I @-@ 5 ) in Kelso . SR 4 is designated as part of the Lewis and Clark Trail Scenic Byway , a state scenic byway , as well as part of the National Highway System . The highway , along with I @-@ 5 and SR 14 , forms the former route of US 830 , which ran along the Columbia River from Johnston 's Landing to Maryhill from the creation of the United States Numbered Highways in 1926 until 1968 . US 830 was co @-@ signed with Primary State Highway 12 ( PSH 12 ) from Johnston 's Landing to Kelso and was created in 1937 as the successor to various unsigned state highways . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 4 begins at an intersection with US 101 at Johnston 's Landing , located on the Naselle River in rural Pacific County . The highway , designated as the Lewis and Clark Trail Scenic Byway , travels southeast along the Naselle River and serves as the northern terminus of SR 401 in the census @-@ designated place of Naselle before leaving the Naselle River . SR 4 continues east along Salmon Creek and the Deep River into Wahkiakum County before it intersects the former route of SR 403 in <unk> . The highway travels upstream along the Grays River and turns southeast towards Skamokawa , passing east of the Julia Butler Hansen Refuge for the Columbian White @-@ Tailed Deer on the shores of the Columbia River . SR 4 continues east through the county seat of Cathlamet and intersects the former terminus of SR 407 and the northern terminus of SR 409 . The highway travels into Cowlitz County and intersects the western terminus of SR 432 , which serves the Port of Longview , in West Longview . SR 4 continues through the northern part of Longview and passes the campus of the Lower Columbia College before traveling onto Cowlitz Way . Cowlitz Way intersects the former spur route of SR 411 and crosses over SR 411 and the Cowlitz River into Kelso before SR 4 splits into a one @-@ way pair traveling south through downtown Kelso . SR 4 turns east onto Allen Street and continues to its eastern terminus , a diamond interchange with I @-@ 5 north of the Three Rivers Mall . 
 Every year , the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2011 , WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 4 was the intersection with Catlin Street in Kelso west of the Cowlitz Way Bridge , serving 34 @,@ 000 vehicles , while the least busy section was between <unk> and Cathlamet in rural Wahkiakum County , serving 1 @,@ 000 vehicles . The entire route of SR 4 is designated as part of the National Highway System , a highway system that includes roadways important to the national economy , defense , and mobility ; and as a Highway of Statewide Significance by WSDOT from US 101 at Johnston 's Landing to SR 432 in West Longview , which includes highways that connect major communities in the state of Washington . 
 = = History = = 
 The present route of SR 4 was codified into the state highway system in 1915 as State Road 19 , connecting Naselle , Cathlamet , Longview , and Kelso along the Columbia River . The highway was built by Pacific County in the Naselle area and Cowlitz County between Stella and Kelso , while the Department of Highways built a road connecting Cathlamet to Skamokawa by 1915 . State Road 19 was officially designated as the Ocean Beach Highway in 1919 and renumbered to State Road 12 in 1923 . The highway was incorporated into US 830 during the creation of the United States Numbered Highways in 1926 , traveling east along the Columbia River from US 101 at Johnston 's Landing to US 97 in Maryhill . The highway was paved with the macadam method between Johnston 's Landing and Grays River and between Skamokawa and Kelso by 1931 . The remaining gap was constructed of gravel by 1933 and the entire highway was paved by 1939 . State Road 12 was replaced by PSH 12 in 1937 , traveling west from PSH 1 and US 99 in Chehalis to PSH 13 in Raymond , south on US 101 to Johnston 's Landing , and east on US 830 to PSH 1 and US 99 in Kelso . During the 1964 highway renumbering , US 830 replaced PSH 12 between Johnston 's Landing and Kelso and was designated as part of the Lewis and Clark Trail Scenic Byway during the creation of the state scenic highway system in 1967 . US 830 was decommissioned in 1968 and was replaced with SR 4 ; however , the highway was proposed as a route for US 12 before it was extended west via White Pass to Aberdeen .

Boyd made his debut for Forest in a 1 – 0 victory over Swansea City , playing the whole match . He struggled for first @-@ team appearances during his loan spell at Forest , and although it was expected that Boyd 's move to Forest was to be made permanent in the summer , new Peterborough United manager Gary Johnson suggested " there 's every chance " that Boyd could return to his parent club . Boyd made Forest 's starting eleven for the first time in almost a month on the last day of the club 's regular season ; playing in a 2 – 2 draw away at Scunthorpe United and scoring Forest 's second goal .

He returned to first @-@ team action on 16 November 2010 , playing in the club 's 4 – 1 FA Cup win over Stockport County . Boyd had to wait four months for his next goal , scoring twice against Sheffield Wednesday on 1 February 2011 . He went on to score five goals in five games throughout February and March , scoring once against Colchester United . This goal was followed by braces against Exeter City and Carlisle United respectively , although Boyd missed the chance to complete his hat @-@ trick in the latter game when he missed a 90th @-@ minute penalty . Three days later , on 15 March 2011 , Boyd scored twice against Sheffield Wednesday in a 4 – 1 victory at Hillsborough . He made it eight goals in eight games when he scored in Peterborough 's 2 – 2 away draw at Bristol Rovers . He took his goal tally to 17 for the season when he scored Peterborough 's third goal in a 5 – 0 home win against Dagenham & Redbridge on 7 May 2011 . Boyd played in all three of Peterborough 's play @-@ off fixtures , playing the whole game in the 2011 League One play @-@ off Final at Old Trafford as Peterborough beat Huddersfield Town 3 – 0 to earn promotion back to the Championship . During the club 's successful 2010 – 11 campaign , Boyd scored 17 goals in 51 appearances . 
 In the summer of 2011 , Peterborough rejected two bids for Boyd from Burnley . He played in the club 's first game of the 2011 – 12 season , playing the whole match as Peterborough secured a 2 – 1 victory over Crystal Palace on their return to the second tier of English football . Boyd scored his first goal of the new season just three days later , on 9 August 2011 , netting a curling free @-@ kick in extra @-@ time in an eventual 4 – 3 League Cup victory against his former club , Stevenage .

He went on to score two further goals during the campaign , taking his end goal tally for the season to eight , making 48 appearances in all competitions as Peterborough consolidated their place in the Championship . 
 In April 2012 , Boyd rejected a contract extension at Peterborough with only a year to go on his current deal . Consequently , manager Darren Ferguson placed Boyd on the transfer list as part of the club 's new policy . Boyd remained transfer @-@ listed for the remainder of his time at Peterborough . Despite this , he continued to play regularly , opening the 2012 – 13 season by scoring two goals in his first three appearances . In October 2012 , Boyd scored his fourth and fifth goals of the season in a 3 – 1 home win over Huddersfield Town . His second goal during the match was a dipping volley from just inside the Huddersfield half , a goal that was described as " world @-@ class " . 
 In January 2013 , Peterborough rejected a bid from Nottingham Forest for Boyd , an offer that club chairman Darragh MacAnthony described as " derisory " . MacAnthony also stated that Premier League club Reading , as well as Championship rivals Crystal Palace and Millwall had " made enquiries " . He later stated that eight clubs had enquired about the player . Towards the end of the 2013 January transfer window , on 29 January , it was announced that Peterborough had accepted an offer for Boyd from fellow Championship side Crystal Palace . A day later , several other Championship sides had improved bids accepted for the player , including Nottingham Forest , who had already had bids rejected for the player earlier in the month and eventually met Peterborough 's £ 500 @,@ 000 valuation . Boyd opted to speak to Forest and agreed terms with them on 31 January , only for Forest to pull out of the deal two hours before the transfer deadline , saying that Boyd had failed a medical due to an " inconclusive eye test " . 
 Peterborough 's Director of football Barry Fry criticised Nottingham Forest 's owners for pulling out of the deal to sign Boyd , and chairman MacAnthony said , " I 'm devastated for George . I got a phone call off him in bits ... He said that he passed the medical then they made him do an eye test . He 's played 300 games and scored from the halfway line the other month , but Forest say he has an eyesight problem . The whole thing stinks . Alex McLeish wanted to sign him . It 's the most ridiculous thing that 's happened to me . " Peterborough subsequently said that with Boyd 's contract expiring in the summer , they would be prepared to offer him a new contract or let him leave on loan when the emergency loan window opened , with at least one club having signalled their interest in doing so .

 In February 2013 , Boyd joined Championship side Hull City on loan until the end of the 2012 – 13 season , with a view to a permanent move . He made his debut two days after signing , on 23 February , coming on as a second @-@ half substitute for Robert Koren in a 4 – 1 away defeat to Bolton Wanderers . Boyd 's full debut came at home in the following match a week later , as he scored twice in a 5 – 2 victory over Birmingham City . After the performance , Hull manager Steve Bruce stated — " It was a wonder show . His work @-@ rate and intelligence – he looked the real deal . I 've always been a big admirer , but I didn 't know he was that good . If he can keep performing like that then we 've got some player on our hands " . He scored in Hull 's next match at the KC Stadium later that month , in a 2 – 1 loss to Nottingham Forest , who he failed a medical at in January , netting just before half @-@ time when he flicked the ball over his shoulder with his back to goal . Boyd 's fourth goal in six games came on 30 March , scoring the only goal of the game as Hull secured a 1 – 0 away victory over Huddersfield Town , an inch perfect ball played through by Jay Simpson found Boyd on the edge of the box , who clinically fired a first time strike into the keepers ' top left corner . He played regularly for the remainder of the campaign , including in Hull 's 2 – 2 home draw with Cardiff City on the last day of the season , the game that ultimately secured the club 's promotion back to the Premier League .

 = = = Scotland = = = 
 In April 2009 , Boyd was called up for the Scotland B side , after obtaining documentary proof that his maternal grandfather was born in Glasgow . Boyd started and subsequently scored in a 3 – 0 victory against a Northern Ireland B side , scoring the second goal of the game , giving a performance described as containing " flair and commitment " . 
 Boyd received his first call @-@ up to the senior side in March 2013 , when he was named in manager Gordon Strachan 's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Wales and Serbia . Although he did not make the substitutes ' bench in Scotland 's 2 – 1 home loss to Wales , he earned his first senior cap just four days later in a 2 – 0 away defeat to Serbia on 26 March 2013 . Boyd started the match , playing the whole match at the Karađorđe Stadium in Novi Sad . 
 = = Style of play = = 
 Boyd is generally deployed as a winger , and has been used on the left @-@ wing throughout the majority of his career . He has described himself as a winger , but has stated that he prefers to play " in the hole " because the position allows him to get more time on the ball . He has expressed his willingness to " play anywhere " to help the team , believing his versatility across the midfield and attacking areas to be one of his main strong @-@ points . He said " I have played on both sides of the park and will always try my best to do a good job regardless of where the manager plays me " . Under former Peterborough United manager , Jim Gannon , Boyd was given a " free @-@ role " , essentially playing across the midfield and behind the strikers . Gannon said " if we can get him free in attacking areas he can be a great creative force " . Gannon believes that Boyd is at his best when he " is saved from doing defensive work that wingers may have to do " , and as a result , during Gannon 's short spell at Peterborough , was deployed just behind the strikers as part of a 3 – 4 – 1 – 2 formation . Boyd has also been used as a striker by manager Mark Stimson during the first @-@ half of Stevenage 's 2006 – 07 campaign . He is predominantly left @-@ footed , and scores the majority of his goals with his left @-@ foot , but is also comfortable using his right . Kieran <unk> , Boyd 's team @-@ mate at Burnley , said of Boyd : " He 's great to play with , with a good left foot and a great engine " . 
 During his time at Stevenage , Boyd earned the nickname " The White Pelé " – this was down to his use of tricks , as well as the amount of flair Boyd brought to the team at such a young age . Stevenage manager Graham Westley , who gave Boyd his first run of games in the first @-@ team , described Boyd as a " special talent " following his two goals away at Woking in August 2005 . Westley proceeded to call Boyd " gifted " , and a player with " fantastic technical ability " . He has been labelled a creative and flamboyant midfielder , and described as " a player who will create goalscoring opportunities all game long " . Boyd has stated that he considers assisting goals a " big part of his game " , and says " I try to create chances for other players and that gives me just as much pleasure as scoring " . Boyd 's creative nature is emphasised by the fact that he has assisted over 50 goals for Peterborough during his time at London Road . Peterborough United manager Darren Ferguson has said that Boyd " has the tendency , and ability , to score goals from long distance " , talking after Boyd 's 35 @-@ yard volley against Boston United . This was further highlighted when Boyd scored from just inside the opposition 's half in a win against Huddersfield Town in October 2012 . Boyd collected a Saido Berahino knock @-@ down , before hitting a dipping volley from the edge of the centre circle . Manager Darren Ferguson stated — " If Lionel Messi had done it you 'd be seeing it over again . For vision and execution it was one of the best I have seen " . Boyd also scored several long range goals during his time at Stevenage , scoring from outside the area on seven different occasions ; most notably on the half @-@ volley from 30 yards in a game against Cambridge United in January 2006 . 
 Boyd believes that he needs to work on his turn of pace and also improve his heading ability , and considers these as his main weaknesses . Former manager Darren Ferguson said " there might be those who say he lacks a little bit of pace but what he does not have in his legs he has in his head " . In his career , Boyd has only ever scored three headed goals , and says that he is much more comfortable with the ball at his feet . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Boyd grew up in Kent , and was " first interested in becoming a footballer when he used to play football with his Dad at the local park " . After being rejected by Charlton Athletic at the age of 15 , Boyd moved to Stevenage , combining a course at North Hertfordshire College with playing football at the Hertfordshire club . During this time , Boyd worked in a sweet shop at Hitchin railway station to earn the money for his train fare to training . Boyd supports Crystal Palace , who he used to watch regularly , and states that former Palace striker Chris Armstrong was a player he aspired to play like . Boyd has a daughter , Ava , whom his partner gave birth to in March 2011 .

 = Hair ( Lady Gaga song ) = 
 " Hair " is a song recorded by American singer Lady Gaga for her second studio album , Born This Way ( 2011 ) . Written and produced by Gaga and RedOne , " Hair " was released worldwide digitally on May 16 , 2011 , as a promotional single from the album , as part of the iTunes Store 's " Countdown to Born This Way " release . This was after the previous promotional release , " The Edge of Glory " , was made the third single from the album . Nevertheless , Gaga explained that " Hair " was not planned to be a single , but may be released as one if it sells well at the iTunes Store , like " The Edge of Glory " . 
 According to Lady Gaga , the melody of " Hair " resembles the work of metal bands Kiss and Iron Maiden , and is also influenced by Bruce Springsteen . The song is an uptempo club record inspired by Gaga 's experience as a teenager , when her parents forced her to dress in a certain way . Gaga found that the only way to express herself was through her hair , and she described it as a song about liberation and her ability to change her ways . The lyrics talk about embracing one 's hairstyle as their ultimate expression of freedom . " Hair " was recorded while Gaga was on tour with The Monster Ball throughout Europe . The song features a saxophone solo performed by saxophonist Clarence Clemons , a prominent member of The E Street Band . She personally wanted Clemons to play saxophone on the song , which he did by recording his part at a Manhattan studio at midnight , after he had just flown there from his home in Florida . 
 " Hair " has been critically appreciated for its message of self @-@ liberation , individualism and empowerment , though some felt that the usage of the term hair to express these messages was not particularly new . " Hair " charted in most musical markets , reaching the top @-@ ten in New Zealand and Scotland , while in other nations , it charted within the top @-@ twenty , including the Billboard Hot 100 of the United States . Gaga performed the song on Good Morning America as part of their " Summer Concert Series " , on Paul O 'Grady Live in the United Kingdom , and on The Howard Stern Show . Later the song was added to the set list of Gaga 's second worldwide tour Born This Way Ball . 
 = = Background and release = = 
 " Hair " was written and produced by Gaga and RedOne , and the name of the song was revealed through an interview with Vogue magazine in February 2011 . On The Graham Norton Show , Gaga explained the origin of the song , which involves the analogy of her hair with freedom , and how that is the only part of her body she can change without anyone judging her . According to a press listening in February , " Hair " draws inspiration from Pat Benatar 's ' 80s classic " We Belong " , while thematically focusing on empowering lyrics similar to those of " Born This Way " . Gaga elaborated on the song 's inspiration further with a video posted on her Twitter account : " When I was a kid , I used to always come down the stairs of my parents ' house , and they would say , ' Go back upstairs and brush your hair , change your clothes , you can 't go out wearing that ' , and I felt like it was stifling my identity ... My hair was my glory . It was the only thing that I could change about myself . " 
 Initially " Hair " was supposed to be released as the second promotional single from Born This Way , following " The Edge of Glory " , on May 16 , 2011 . However , after its release to the digital stores , " The Edge of Glory " started selling considerable amount of digital downloads , prompting Gaga to make it the third single from Born This Way . Hence , " Hair " became the first promotional release from the album . Gaga noted that although " Hair " was not planned to be an official single , it could be released as such , if it was to sell well at the digital outlets like " The Edge of Glory " . Gaga also revealed her artwork for " Hair " on May 13 , 2011 , on her Twitter account . The black and white cover features a pink @-@ haired Gaga lying upside down on the floor in a sharp @-@ edged leather outfit , which consists of protruding nipple spikes . It was photographed by her longtime collaborator and friend Nick Knight . Later on in the same day , Gaga tweeted the line : " The Born This Way <unk> Countdown will release my song <unk> 2moro 1pm PST . " She also tweeted the line " I 'll dye living just as free as my Hair ! " , then adding that the correct word in the line should be " die " , instead of " dye " . 
 = = Recording and composition = = 
 During an interview with Ryan Seacrest on his radio program On Air With Ryan Seacrest , Gaga described " Hair " as an up @-@ tempo club record , with Bruce Springsteen overtones to it . She also revealed the involvement of Clarence Clemons playing sax on the record . Other influences included metal bands like Kiss and Iron Maiden on the melody . She revealed some of the lines of the song on Seacrest 's show , " This is my prayer , that I 'll die living just as free as my hair " , adding that the composition of " Hair " was interesting since it was juxtaposing saxophone with a dance record . In an interview with radio station Z @-@ 100 she added , " Some of those themes are explored more on this album . To put my money where my mouth is . " Gaga 's references for the saxophone solo was the music of E Street Band and Bruce Springsteen ; to her they represented a different genre of music , at the same time encompassing all the different elements of it . She ultimately decided to ask Clemons from E Street Band to play the instrument . 
 With Rolling Stone , Clemons described how he recorded the saxophone solo with Gaga . In January 2011 , Clemons was putting together an exercise machine in his Florida house when his wife told him that Gaga 's representatives were on the phone , and they wanted him to play on her upcoming album . Since the call was on a Friday , Clemons replied that he would be able to record it on the coming week , but Gaga was adamant to have him at the New York recording studio on that day itself . After accepting her request , Clemons went to New York and reached the recording studio in Manhattan at midnight . Gaga wanted him to play saxophone on multiple tracks , one of them being " Hair " . Before Clemons started work on the song , she explained the lyrics to him . " It made so much sense , " he said . " It 's a story about growing up . " She gave him few instructions about how to play on the song , saying " ' We 'll put the tape on and you just play . Play from your heart . Play what you feel . ' " . The recording was finished by 3 : 00 am , after a few takes . Clemons added that he was surprised for " getting paid for this . I would have done it for free . I can never believe something that feels so good earns me money . " According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony / ATV Music Publishing , the song is written in the time signature of common time . It is composed in the key of F major , with a tempo of 135 beats per minute . Gaga 's vocals span from F3 to F5 , and the song follows a basic sequence of F – C – Dm – B ♭ as its chord progression . 
 " Hair " was recorded mostly while Gaga was on tour in Europe , but the mixing was done by Gene Grimaldi at Oasis Mastering in Burbank , California . It is a Hi @-@ NRG song and begins with Gaga singing the line " Whenever I dress cool , my parents put up a fight / And if I 'm a hot shot , Mom will cut my hair at night / And in the morning I 'm short of my identity / I scream , ' Mom and Dad , why can 't I be who I want to be ? " As the music grows louder , Gaga sings the sing along chorus of the song , gradually moving towards the breakdown — which is inspired by retro music — talking about the different hairstyles she has had . Jocelyn Vena from MTV described the track as a " fist @-@ pumping , defiant disco track all about having a good time . " Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone called it a mixture of yearning romantic melodrama of " We Belong " with the hard industrial metal edge of Broken @-@ era Nine Inch Nails . Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune felt that Gaga 's vocals are Auto @-@ Tuned throughout the song . The lyrics of " Hair " talk about embracing one 's hairstyle as the ultimate expression of their identity , hence it ends with Gaga triumphantly declaring " I am my hair ! " at the end of the final chorus . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 " Hair " has received mostly positive reviews . An hour before starting the final leg of The Monster Ball Tour , Gaga sent four tracks to Rolling Stone , including " Scheiße " , " You and I " , and " The Edge of Glory " , for a preview . Matthew Perpetua wrote a positive review of " Hair " , describing it as another inspirational song in the mold of " Born This Way " , but felt that it was a bit weirder . Perpetua concluded the review by jokingly adding that the song will become " [ a ] n anthem for salons everywhere . " Jody Rosen from the same publication felt that " although Gaga is not the first singer to create a connection between self @-@ esteem and liberation to free @-@ flowing <unk> , she seems to be the most committed to the idea . " Dan Martin from NME classified " Hair " as an empowerment anthem , using the " simple image of the wind blowing through a person ’ s hair to illuminate the album ’ s Love @-@ Yourself @-@ And @-@ Let @-@ It @-@ All @-@ Hang @-@ Out message way more effectively than the title track . It trumps it once again by being quite the gayest thing you will ever hear for a long time . " Tim Jonze from The Guardian felt that the message of " Hair " was not particularly a new one , since the 60 's musical Hair also preached the same message . Although he described some of the lyrics as " trite " , Jonze opined that " these weaknesses can also be strengths , and there 's something admirable about the way the [ track ] address confused teenagers in search of their identity . " Writing for The Vancouver Sun , Leah Collins described the song as " a pumping anthem designed to pump up your follicles with pride . " She added that the overall feel of the song was that of retro dance music . 
 Natalie Finn from E ! Online was disappointed with the track , feeling that although the releases from Born This Way were not that " catchy " , all of them were about the same subject of " the importance of being ourselves . Oh well , maybe we 're just waiting for the next ' Bad Romance ' to sweep us off our feet . Or the next ' Speechless ' to make us cry . Or even the next ' Just Dance ' to really make us want to dance . " Jason Lipshultz from Billboard felt that the track was another anthem for individualism , with Gaga 's hair used as a metaphor for her wild personality . Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave a mixed review stating that the song is a " derivative but perfectly serviceable club track about highlights that 's turned into a dumping ground for every bad idea Gaga 's had in the last 12 months : schmaltzy piano @-@ woman melodies , overwrought choruses , inexplicable sax solos . " Rick Fulton , while writing in the Daily Record , called " Hair " a " great tune " and an " Europop high @-@ energy epic " , while giving it four out of five points . Ian Hope from BBC Online described " Hair " as an " empowering freeway rocker about self expression . " The Independent writer Andy Gill compared the song to those by guitarist David Crosby , and described it as a statement of rebellious individuality . According to Los Angeles Times ' Randall Roberts , Gaga " celebrates her follicles " in the song .

 " Hair " charted in most musical markets and its debut became its peak position ; the song was present for a maximum of two weeks . In the United Kingdom , " Hair " debuted at number 13 on the UK Singles Chart . Along with the song , Gaga 's other singles — " The Edge of Glory " , " Judas " and " Born This Way " — were all within the top twenty on the chart , making Gaga the first female artist since Ruby Murray in 1955 , to have four songs simultaneously within the top twenty . In Australia , " Hair " debuted at number 20 on the ARIA Singles Chart and was present for two weeks in the top @-@ fifty . In the Netherlands , " Hair " debuted at number 15 on the Single Top 100 chart , and at number 14 on the Irish Singles Chart . 
 In the United States , " Hair " debuted at number five on the Hot Digital Songs chart with first @-@ week sales of 147 @,@ 000 copies .

 On May 27 , 2011 , Gaga performed the song on Good Morning America as a part of their " Summer Concert Series " . She was dressed in purple horns and a black and blond ponytail , and was placed atop a black staircase , with her leg perched on top of a black unicorn shaped piano . Dedicating the song to her mother , Gaga sang an acoustic version of " Hair " , which Sheila <unk> from ABC News reviewed positively , saying that it " really brought the house down . " Christian Blauvelt from Entertainment Weekly was also impressed with the acoustic version , saying that " at a keyboard , Gaga 's never better at injecting enough passion and commitment to sell even the corniest lyrics about follicular empowerment . " 
 Gaga performed " Hair " on The Paul O 'Grady Show on June 17 , 2011 . The song was the first of the four performances planned , and Gaga opened the show with her sitting on the piano . She appeared bald but wore a teal colored fringed dress , and sang an acoustic version of " Hair " , while staring at a teal colored wig placed in front of her . The piano on which she sang was covered with brown , curly hair and she was surrounded by flames . Halfway through the performance , Gaga took the wig and placed it on her head . Ryan Love of Digital Spy had a preview of the recording of the show , and commented that when " it 's just GaGa [ sic ] on the piano , you can 't help but be impressed . " Cynthia Robinson from The Huffington Post theorized that Gaga pretending to be bald was not a " fashion statement " , instead she was " saying something about shedding that skin , that costume , that barrier that she created with all of her vaunted costumes — at least so that people know what she is inside before putting it back on . " 
 At French television show Taratata Gaga appeared while hanging out of the window of her limousine . She later went on the show to perform " Hair " , but changed her outfit once more . The recorded performance was released to her YouTube channel by Gaga . Air Productions , which produces the program Taratata , detected the posting of the video and notified YouTube of supposed copyright infringement on Gaga 's part . YouTube was forced to close Gaga 's official channel with the statement : " YouTube <unk> account was closed , because we have received , several instances , third @-@ party notifications informing us that many people , including the following , filed a claim for infringement of copyright : Air Productions . " Later , Air Productions issued a statement that the notification was sent in error , and they had asked Google and YouTube to rectify this ; Gaga 's account was re @-@ opened , and Taratata apologized to the singer : " Really sorry for the problem with YouTube . Everything works again ! " During her promotional performances of the songs from Born This Way in Taiwan , Gaga sang " Hair " and played the piano in a black bra , against the backdrop of many red lanterns and a red arch , a set created specially for the Taiwan show . She later explained in a press conference the inspiration behind the performance : " Like the gentleman [ the host ] just mentioned , that lantern means prosperity and it 's about the future . I 'm always thinking about the future of my generation and the voice of my generation when I write music . " 
 At the iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas on September 24 , 2011 , Gaga dedicated a performance of " Hair " to deceased teenager Jamey <unk> , who had committed suicide after being constantly bullied by his peers at school for being gay . An image of <unk> was shown on the backdrop as Gaga announced : " We lost a Little Monster this week . I wrote this record about how your identity is really all you 've got when you 're in school ... so tonight , Jamey , I know you 're up there looking at us , and you 're not a victim ... you 're a lesson to all of us . I know it 's a bit of a downer , but sometimes the right thing is more important than the music " , after which she sang a piano version of " Hair " . 
 The song is also included in the set list of her the 2012 Born This Way Ball Tour . To <unk> Je @-@ yup of The Korea Times was positive about the performance of the song during the tour saying that , " The highlight of the night was her first slow jam ' Hair , ' which she introduced as her favorite track on the ' Born This Way ' album ... Playing the guitar @-@ shaped keyboard , she <unk> her line once and admitted it right away — ' I 'm getting too excited ( that ) I forgot my lines , ' she said — but the moment made the experience personal . " On the second night of Gaga 's show in the Philippines , she addressed the controversy directly before a slow @-@ tempo version of " Hair " . While playing the piano she stated that she is aware of the issues around her image and music , she emphasized that she respects all kinds of religion , people and culture – including Filipino culture . She also said that she respects that everyone is entitled to their own opinion , but stressed " What I don ’ t respect is homophobia and hatred … I reject intolerance to the gay community . " This drew cheers from the audience . She went on to say that she is aware some are using her name to spread hatred but intended to counter this by continuing to spread " positivity " in her own way .

 = CD @-@ i games from The Legend of Zelda series = 
 Link : The Faces of Evil , Zelda : The Wand of Gamelon and Zelda 's Adventure are three action @-@ adventure games produced by Philips for the CD @-@ i as part of Nintendo 's The Legend of Zelda video game series . Not designed for Nintendo platforms , the games owe their existence to negotiations related to Nintendo 's decision not to have Philips create a CD add @-@ on to the Super NES . During these negotiations , Philips secured the rights to use Nintendo characters in CD @-@ i third @-@ party developer games . The Faces of Evil and The Wand of Gamelon were developed by Animation Magic and were both released in North America on October 10 , 1993 , and Zelda 's Adventure was developed by <unk> and was released in North America on June 5 , 1994 . The games were given little funding or time for completion , and Nintendo provided only cursory input . 
 The Philips CD @-@ i did not sell well and the games saw relatively small sales figures . Critical reception for all three Zelda CD @-@ i titles is unusual in that while largely positive at the time of the games ' release , they have seen nearly universal negative criticism since the mid @-@ 2000s . This is attributable to the reaction of many gamers to the obscure games ' full motion video cutscenes when they first became widely available through video @-@ sharing websites like YouTube . The cutscenes are perceived to be of poor quality . Because the aging early 1990s visual effects of the titles failed to live up to the graphic effects of the 2000s , and because for many fans this was their first experience of the games , the CD @-@ i Zelda titles have developed a critical reputation as particularly poor games in the Zelda franchise based largely on animation quality and to an extent on awkward controls . In the eyes of devout hardcore gamers , according to Edge magazine , these games are now considered " tantamount to blasphemy " . 
 Faces of Evil and Wand of Gamelon are played using the side @-@ scrolling view introduced in Zelda II : The Adventure of Link , while Zelda 's Adventure has a top @-@ down view reminiscent of the original The Legend of Zelda . All the CD @-@ i Zelda games begin with animated FMVs to illustrate the capabilities of the CD @-@ ROM format , save Zelda 's Adventure , which begins with live @-@ action video . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1989 , Nintendo signed a deal with Sony to begin development of a CD @-@ ROM @-@ based system known as the SNES @-@ CD ( also known as the " Nintendo PlayStation " ) to be an add @-@ on to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System that would allow for FMV and larger games . However , Nintendo broke the agreement and instead signed with Philips to make the add @-@ on , which caused Sony to spin off their add @-@ on into its own console called the PlayStation . Witnessing the poor reception of the Sega Mega @-@ CD , Nintendo scrapped the idea of making an add @-@ on entirely . As part of dissolving the agreement with Philips , Nintendo gave them the license to use five of their characters , including Link , Princess Zelda , and Ganon , for games on Philips 's console called the CD @-@ i , after the partnership 's dissolution . 
 Contracting out to independent studios , Philips subsequently used the characters to create three games for the CD @-@ i , with Nintendo taking no part in their development except to give input on the look of the characters based on the artwork from Nintendo 's original two titles and that of their respective instruction booklets . Philips insisted that the development studios utilize all aspects of the CD @-@ i 's capabilities including FMV , high @-@ resolution graphics , and CD @-@ quality music . Because the system had not been designed as a dedicated video game console , there were several technical limitations , such as <unk> controls ( especially for the standard infrared controller ) , and numerous problems in streaming @-@ audio , memory , disc access , and graphics . 
 The first two games were showcased at the 1993 CES and surprised audiences with their degree of animation .

 = = = Link : The Faces of Evil = = = 
 Paired with Zelda : Wand of Gamelon in a simultaneous release , Link : The Faces of Evil represents the first of the Zelda games to be released by Philips for the CD @-@ i . Following the traditional Link @-@ saves @-@ Zelda plotline , Faces of Evil was patterned most closely upon Nintendo 's previous side @-@ scroller , Zelda II : The Adventure of Link . The game broke new ground in the video game industry by using outsourced Russian animation to create all cutscenes , and the game received largely positive contemporary reception . Modern criticism is almost universal in its harsh negativity toward the game and the animated cutscenes have become particular targets of derision .

 Reversing the traditional Link @-@ saves @-@ Zelda plotline , Wand of Gamelon stars Zelda as she adventures to rescue Link and her father the king who have not returned from their quest . As with Faces of Evil , the game was patterned most closely upon Nintendo 's previous side @-@ scroller , Zelda II : The Adventure of Link , and again features outsourced Russian animation for all cutscenes . Despite the game 's similarly positive contemporary reception along with Faces of Evil , modern critics have almost unanimously derided and ridiculed the game for its inability to live up to modern expectations with the animated cutscenes again having become a particular target of negative reception . 
 = = = Zelda 's Adventure = = = 
 Released nearly 8 months after the first two Zelda CD @-@ i games , Zelda 's Adventure was created by a different third @-@ party developer , <unk> . The game again follows a nontraditional Zelda @-@ saves @-@ Link plotline , but it uses a different game engine than Faces of Evil and Wand of Gamelon . Whereas the first two CD @-@ i games were patterned on the side @-@ scrolling Zelda II : The Adventure of Link , Zelda 's Adventure took the top @-@ down The Legend of Zelda as its model . Zelda 's Adventure featured FMV cutscenes , but rather than using drawn animation , the game used live @-@ action scenes . Reception for the game was poor , and whereas some modern critics have given more nuanced reviews of the first two games , modern criticism for Zelda 's Adventure is unanimously negative . 
 = Flem D. Sampson = 
 <unk> Davis " Flem " Sampson ( January 23 , 1875 – May 25 , 1967 ) was the 42nd Governor of Kentucky , serving from 1927 to 1931 . He graduated from Valparaiso University in 1894 , and opened a law practice in Barbourville , Kentucky . He formed a political alliance with future congressmen Caleb Powers and John Robsion , both prominent Republicans in the eastern part of the state . By 1916 , he was serving on the Kentucky Court of Appeals — the state 's highest court — having previously served as a county judge and circuit court judge . In 1923 , he was elevated to chief justice of the Court of Appeals . He served until 1927 , when he became the Republican gubernatorial nominee . 
 The Democrats nominated former governor and senator J. C. W. Beckham to challenge Sampson . The primary issue in the campaign was whether to outlaw parimutuel betting at the state 's racetracks . Beckham favored the ban , while Sampson opposed it . A political machine known as the Jockey Club backed Sampson , and several key Democrats bolted the party after Beckham 's nomination . Sampson won the governorship by over 32 @,@ 000 votes , but every other Republican on the ticket lost by small majorities . The results suggested that some carefully coordinated vote swapping had occurred to ensure Beckham 's defeat , but none was ever proven . 
 Sampson 's term in office was a tumultuous one . The 1928 legislature was dominated by Democrats and was not particularly responsive to Sampson 's proposals . After the session , Sampson was indicted for accepting gifts from textbook companies , but the charges were later dropped . In 1929 , Sampson removed Democratic political boss Ben Johnson from his post as highway commissioner . When legislators reconvened in 1930 , they retaliated by stripping Sampson of many of his appointment powers and reinstalling Johnson to his post . Later in the session , Sampson proposed to allow Samuel Insull to dam the Cumberland Falls to generate hydroelectric power . The General Assembly instead voted to accept an offer from T. Coleman du Pont to purchase the falls and turn them into a state park . The Assembly voted to further restrict Sampson 's powers in 1930 . The end of Sampson 's term was complicated by the economic realities of the Great Depression . He called out the Kentucky National Guard to quell a violent mine strike in Harlan County known as the Battle of Evarts . Following his term , Sampson returned to Barbourville and was re @-@ elected as a circuit court judge . He died May 25 , 1967 and was buried in Barbourville Cemetery .

He was educated in the county 's public schools and the John T. Hays school . The family moved to Barbourville , Kentucky when Sampson was thirteen . 
 By age sixteen , Sampson was teaching at Indian Creek School in Laurel County . He attended Union College in Barbourville , then enrolled at Valparaiso University . He was class president for three years , and earned an A.B. in 1894 . Per university policy , he was also awarded and an LL.B. because , prior to graduation , he had studied for at least one year in a law office . He returned to Kentucky and was admitted to the bar in June 1895 . 
 Sampson established his legal practice in Barbourville , where he became the city attorney . Caleb Powers , who had been Sampson 's college roommate , now joined him as a partner in his law firm . Powers would later be accused of complicity to the assassination of Governor William Goebel . Because Powers was convicted by a partisan jury , he became a political martyr to many Republicans , and Sampson 's connection to him became a boon in heavily Republican eastern Kentucky . 
 Sampson later served as president of Barbourville 's First National Bank ; he was the youngest person ever to hold the position . He also served as president of the Barbourville Water @-@ works Company . On September 20 , 1897 , [ b ] he married Susie Steele ; the couple had three daughters — Pauline , <unk> , and Helen Katherine .

 Sampson 's political career began in 1906 when he was elected county judge of Knox County , Kentucky , a position he held for four years . In 1911 , he was elected to the circuit court of the 34th Judicial District . He was re @-@ elected to this post in 1916 , but later that year , he was elected to the Kentucky Court of Appeals , then the court of last resort in Kentucky . He represented Kentucky 's Seventh Appellate District , and was elevated to chief justice on January 1 , 1923 . He was re @-@ elected to the court in 1924 .

 Sampson and Congressman John M. Robsion organized a formidable Republican faction in the eastern part of Kentucky . In 1927 , Sampson was a candidate for the Republican gubernatorial nomination . His opponent was Robert H. Lucas , a tax collector for the Internal Revenue Service . Lucas secured the support of Kentucky senators Frederic M. Sackett and Richard P. Ernst , while Sampson was backed by longtime supporter John M. Robsion and the Jockey Club , a coalition of leaders who supported parimutuel betting on horse races . Sampson won the primary by a margin of 39 @,@ 375 . 
 The Democratic party was badly divided over the parimutuel betting issue as well as prohibition , and a severance tax on coal . The prohibitionist and anti @-@ gambling faction of the Democratic Party — with the help of Louisville Courier @-@ Journal editor Robert Worth Bingham — united to make former governor and senator J. C. W. Beckham the party 's gubernatorial nominee . Following Beckham 's nomination , many pro @-@ gambling and anti @-@ prohibition Democrats hurried to the support of Sampson . Sitting Democratic governor William J. Fields , who had been elected with help from the Jockey Club , was very passive in the campaign and refused to support Beckham . 
 The campaign was particularly contentious . Sampson contrasted his humble roots with Beckham 's aristocratic ones , declaring " I 'm just plain old Flem . When I 'm elected governor of Kentucky , come into my office and sit down and say ' Howdy Flem ' . " He also trumpeted his own moral purity , claiming he " never smoked , chewed , drank , gambled – not even bet on an election . " He promised , however , to protect horse racing in the Commonwealth . In response , Sampson 's opponents dubbed him " Flem @-@ Flam Flem " . 
 Sampson won the election by a majority of over 32 @,@ 000 votes , although every other Republican candidate lost by small margins . In the lieutenant governor 's race , Democrat James Breathitt , Jr. defeated Sampson 's running mate , E. E. Nelson , by 159 votes out of more than 700 @,@ 000 cast . It was estimated that the Jockey Club spent half a million dollars to defeat Beckham and the large majority for Sampson versus the close defeat of all other Republican candidates suggested some type of fraud , although none was ever proven . 
 During the 1928 legislative session , it became clear that the bipartisan support shown for Sampson had been one of political convenience rather than true conviction . Among the minor accomplishments of the session were the creation of the Kentucky Progress Commission ( the forerunner of the State Department of Commerce ) and the adoption of " My Old Kentucky Home " as the state song . The Democratic General Assembly sanctioned Sampson 's plan for free textbooks , but did not fund it . Proposals to ban parimutuel betting and the teaching of evolution in the state 's schools were both defeated . Kentucky historian James C. Klotter called the 1928 legislative session " almost a ' do @-@ nothing ' session " . Following the session , a grand jury indicted Sampson for accepting gifts from the textbook companies , but the indictment was eventually dismissed . 
 The first major controversy of Sampson 's administration was over the selection of the state 's highway commissioner . The Highway Department employed over ten thousand people and spent nearly 45 % of the state 's budget . Legislators ' votes could often be bought with promises of new road construction in their districts . Thus , the department became a primary vehicle for dispensing patronage to political supporters . Sampson 's predecessor , Governor Fields , had chosen retired congressman and Democratic political boss Ben Johnson to head the department , and Sampson had agreed to retain him in exchange for his support against Beckham . However , Sampson felt that such a powerful position could not be left in the hands of a Democrat , and he removed Johnson from office in December 1929 . 
 Democrats in the General Assembly were outraged . When the 1930 legislative session convened , they immediately passed a bill that stripped Sampson of his power to appoint a highway commissioner , giving it to a three @-@ person commission composed of the governor , lieutenant governor , and attorney general . The Republican Sampson would be outnumbered and outvoted in this group . Confident that the Democrats would not lose another gubernatorial election , Democratic legislators stipulated in the bill that the appointment power would return to the governor in 1931 , the end of Sampson 's term . The law passed the House by a vote of 53 — 42 and the Senate by a vote of 22 — 15 . Sampson vetoed the bill , but the veto was overridden , and Johnson was returned to his former position . 
 Sampson also made enemies when he backed Samuel Insull 's plan to dam the Cumberland Falls to generate hydroelectric power . An ally of the traditional southern power groups — the utility companies and textbook manufacturers — Sampson cited the jobs to be gained from the plan . The plan was opposed conservationists in the state and by most of the state 's newspapers . An alternate plan was proposed by Louisville @-@ born millionaire and Delaware senator T. Coleman du Pont , who offered to purchase the falls for $ 230 @,@ 000 and turn it into a state park . The General Assembly passed legislation giving the state park commission the right of eminent domain over the falls , then voted to accept the du Pont 's offer . Sampson vetoed the Assembly 's action , but his veto was overridden . 
 Sampson 's agenda for the 1930 session was lost in the fights over Ben Johnson and Cumberland Falls . His calls for funding the free textbook program , compulsory sterilization of the mentally ill , and restrictions on chain stores were ignored . Instead , the legislature continued eroding his gubernatorial powers , including the power to appoint members of the textbook commission . With nearly all of the governor 's powers stripped away and given to a three @-@ person commission , Lieutenant Governor James Breathitt , Jr. became the de facto governor for the remainder of Sampson 's term . The General Assembly pursued its own agenda , passing a mandatory driver 's license law , a revised election law , and a sales tax on retail stores . They also allocated funding for the purchase of what would become Mammoth Cave National Park . Sampson vetoed 12 bills during the 1930 session , but the legislature overrode 11 of them . 
 With the onset of the Great Depression , Sampson worked to control government costs , but endorsed highway progression . A severe drought in 1930 left 86 of Kentucky 's counties applying for federal aid . As unemployment in the eastern coal fields climbed to 40 percent , the United Mine Workers made their first inroads in the region . In 1931 , mine owners began firing workers who joined the union . Many of these workers gathered in Evarts , Kentucky . The local sheriff added 26 deputies to his staff , helping enforce the blacklisting of these miners and discourage further organization . Union leaders petitioned Sampson to remove the sheriff and the county judge from office . Violent squabbles between striking union miners and local authorities began as early as mid @-@ April 1931 . On May 5 , 1931 , three guards and a miner were killed in a shootout that became known as the Battle of Evarts . Two days later , Sampson called in the National Guard to disarm both the mine guards and the union miners . All of the union 's leaders were arrested , and the strike ultimately failed .

 Following his term as governor , Sampson returned to his legal practice in Barbourville , and was elected as a circuit court judge . In 1940 , he once again sought election to the Kentucky Court of Appeals , but was defeated in the Republican primary by Eugene Siler . In 1957 , he was appointed to the Citizens ' Advisory Highway Committee , and was awarded the Governor 's Medallion for distinguished public service in 1959 . 
 At the age of ninety @-@ one , Sampson served on the State Constitutional Revision Committee . He died in <unk> Valley , Kentucky on May 25 , 1967 , and was buried at the Barbourville Cemetery . 
 = Mark Hatfield = 
 Mark Odom Hatfield ( July 12 , 1922 – August 7 , 2011 ) was an American politician and educator from the state of Oregon . A Republican , he served for 30 years as a United States Senator from Oregon , and also as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee . A native Oregonian , he served in the United States Navy in the Pacific Theater during World War II after graduating from Willamette University . After the war he earned a graduate degree from Stanford University before returning to Oregon and Willamette as a professor . 
 While still teaching , Hatfield served in both houses of the Oregon Legislative Assembly . He won election to the Oregon Secretary of State 's office at the age of 34 and two years later was elected as the 29th Governor of Oregon . He was the youngest person to ever serve in either of those offices , and served two terms as governor before election to the United States Senate . In the Senate he served for 30 years , and now holds the record for longest tenure of any Senator from Oregon . At the time of his retirement , he was 7th most senior Senator as well as second most senior Republican . In 1968 , he was considered a candidate to be Richard Nixon 's running mate for the Republican Party presidential ticket . 
 Hatfield served as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations on two different occasions . With this role , he was able to direct funding to Oregon and research @-@ related projects . Several Oregon institutions , buildings and facilities are named in his honor , including the Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse in Portland , the Mark O. Hatfield Library at Willamette University ( his alma mater ) , the Hatfield Government Center light @-@ rail station in Hillsboro , the Mark O. Hatfield School of Government in the College of Urban and Public Affairs at Portland State University , and the Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport . Outside of Oregon , a research center at the National Institutes of Health is also named in his honor for his support of medical research while in the Senate . Hatfield died in Portland on August 7 , 2011 , after a long illness .

 Hatfield was born in Dallas , Oregon , on July 12 , 1922 , the only son of Dovie E. ( Odom ) Hatfield , a schoolteacher , and Charles <unk> Hatfield , a blacksmith for the Southern Pacific Railroad . Mark 's father was from California and his mother from Tennessee . When Mark was five years old , his maternal grandmother took over the household while his mother , Dovie attended Oregon State College ( now Oregon State University ) and graduated with a teaching degree after four years . Dovie taught school in Dallas for two years before the family moved to Salem , where she taught junior high school . 
 Encouraged by his mother , Hatfield 's first experience with politics came at the age of 10 , when he campaigned in his neighborhood for President Herbert Hoover 's 1932 re @-@ election campaign . In the late 1930s Hatfield worked as a tour guide at the new Oregon State Capitol Building in Salem , using his key to enter the governor 's office , where he sat in the governor 's chair . 
 On June 10 , 1940 , the 17 @-@ year @-@ old Hatfield , driving his mother 's car , struck and killed a pedestrian , Alice Marie Lane , as she crossed the street . Hatfield was not held criminally liable for the crash , but was found civilly liable to the family . The case made its way to the Oregon Supreme Court in 1943 , with the court affirming the trial court 's decision . 
 Hatfield graduated from Salem High School ( now North Salem High School ) in 1940 and then enrolled at Willamette University , also in Salem . While attending Willamette , Hatfield became a brother of Alpha Phi Omega and Kappa Gamma Rho , which he later helped become a chapter of Beta Theta Pi . In college he also worked part @-@ time for then Oregon Secretary of State Earl Snell , where he learned how to build a political base by sending out messages to potential voters after reading about life changes posted in newspapers , such as deaths and graduations . He also sketched out a political career path beginning with the state legislature and culminating in a spot in the United States Senate , with a blank for any position beyond the Senate . Hatfield graduated from Willamette in 1943 with a Bachelor of Arts degree after three years at the school . While at the school he lost his only election , for student body president . 
 Hatfield joined the U.S. Navy after graduation , taking part in the World War II battles at Iwo Jima and Okinawa as a landing craft officer where he witnessed the carnage of the war . A lieutenant , he also witnessed the effects of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima , as one of the first Americans to see the ruins of the city ( later , as Senator , Hatfield opposed arms proliferation and the Vietnam War ) . After Japan , he served in French Indochina , where he witnessed firsthand the wealth divide between the peasant Vietnamese and the colonial French bourgeoisie . After his discharge , he spent one year at Willamette ’ s law school , but decided politics or teaching better suited him . 
 Hatfield then enrolled at Stanford University , where he obtained a master 's degree in political science in 1948 . He returned to Salem and Willamette after Stanford and began working as an assistant professor in political science . During his tenure as professor , he built a political base by sending out messages and speaking at any public forum where he could get an invitation .

 Mark Hatfield 's career in public office spanned five decades as he held office in both the legislative and executive branches of Oregon 's state government , including two terms as governor . On the national stage he became the longest serving U.S. Senator from Oregon and a candidate for the Republican Vice Presidential nomination in 1968 . In the U.S. Senate he would twice serve as chairman of the Appropriations Committee , and twice be investigated for possible ethics violations . 
 = = = Oregon = = = 
 In 1950 while teaching political science and serving as dean of students at Willamette , Hatfield began his political career by winning election to the Oregon House of Representatives as a Republican . He defeated six others for the seat at a time when state assembly elections were still determined by county @-@ wide votes . He served for two terms representing Marion County and Salem in the lower chamber of the Oregon Legislative Assembly . At the time he was the youngest legislator in Oregon and still lived at his parents ' home . Hatfield would teach early @-@ morning classes and then walk across the street to the Capitol to legislate . 
 In 1952 he won re @-@ election to his seat in the Oregon House . He also received national attention for his early support for coaxing Dwight D. Eisenhower to run for President of the United States as a Republican . This earned him a spot as a delegate at the Republican National Convention that year . 
 While in college he saw firsthand the discrimination against African Americans in Salem when he was tasked by his fraternity after a dinner with driving their guest , Black artist Paul Robeson back to Portland , as African Americans were prohibited from staying in hotels in Salem . In 1953 , he introduced and passed legislation in the House that prohibited discrimination based on race in public accommodations before federal legislation and court decisions did so on a national level . In 1954 , Hatfield ran and won a seat in the Oregon State Senate representing Marion County . While in the legislature , he continued to apply the grassroots strategy he learned from Earl Snell , but expanded it to cover the entire state to increase his political base . 
 After serving in the state senate , he became the youngest secretary of state in Oregon history after winning election in 1956 at age 34 . Hatfield defeated fellow state senator Monroe Sweetland for the office , receiving 51 @.@ 3 % of the vote in the November general election . He took office on January 7 , 1957 , and remained until he resigned on January 12 , 1959 . 
 For his first run for Governor of Oregon in 1958 , the Republican Party opposed his candidacy going into the primary election . The large political base he had cultivated allowed him to win the party 's primary despite the party 's opposition . In the primary he defeated Oregon State Treasurer Sig <unk> for the Republican nomination . In July 1958 , after the primary election , Hatfield married Antoinette <unk> , a counselor at Portland State College ( now Portland State University ) . The marriage during the campaign drew some attention as the Catholic <unk> converted to Hatfield 's Baptist religion . The couple would have four children : Elizabeth , Mark Jr . , Theresa and Vincent ( " <unk> " ) . He continued his campaign for the governor 's office after the wedding , but avoided most public appearances with fellow Republican candidates for office and did not mention them during his campaign , despite requests by other Republicans for joint appearances . 
 In the November general election Hatfield faced Democratic incumbent Robert D. Holmes . In the final days of the campaign U.S. Senator Wayne Morse , a Democrat , implied Hatfield lied in his trial regarding the deadly car accident when he was 17 . This tactic backfired as the press denounced the comments , as did Holmes and other Democrats . Hatfield defeated Holmes , winning 55 @.@ 3 % of the vote in the election . That same election saw the Democratic Party gain a majority in both chambers of the state legislature for the first time since 1878 . Holmes ' defeat was attributed in part to the image and charisma portrayed by Hatfield and in part due to the campaign issues such as the declining economy , increased taxation , capital punishment , labor , and education . After the election , Holmes attempted to appoint David O 'Hara as Secretary of State to replace Hatfield , who would have to resign to become governor . Hatfield appointed Howell Appling , Jr. to the office , and O 'Hara challenged the appointment in state court . The Oregon Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hatfield on the constitutional issue , with the appointment of Appling confirmed . He was the youngest governor in the history of Oregon at that point in time at the age of 36 . 
 In 1962 Hatfield had been considered a possible candidate to run against Morse for his Senate seat , but Hatfield instead ran for re @-@ election . He faced Oregon Attorney General Robert Y. Thornton in the general election , winning with 345 @,@ 497 votes to Thorton 's 265 @,@ 359 . He became the state 's first two @-@ term governor in the 20th century when he was re @-@ elected in 1962 , and later became only the second governor up to that point in the state 's history to serve two full @-@ terms . 
 Hatfield gave the keynote speech at the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco that nominated Barry Goldwater and served as temporary chairman of the party during the convention . He advocated a moderate approach for the party and opposed the extreme conservatism associated with Goldwater and his supporters . He also was the only governor to vote against a resolution by the National Governors ' Conference supporting the Johnson Administration 's policy on the Vietnam War , as Hatfield opposed the war , but pledged " unqualified and complete support " for the troops . He preferred the use of economic sanctions to end the war . 
 Hatfield was a popular Governor who supported Oregon 's traditional industries of timber and agriculture , but felt that in the postwar era expansion of industry and funding for transportation and education needed to be priorities . While governor he worked to begin the diversification of the state 's economy , such as recruiting industrial development and holding trade missions . As part of the initiative , he helped to found the Oregon Graduate Center in what is now the Silicon Forest in Washington County in 1963 . A graduate level school in the Portland area ( Portland State was still a college with no graduate programs at this time ) was seen by business leaders as essential to attracting new industries and by Tektronix as needed to retain highly skilled workers . In lieu of the standard portrait for former governors , Hatfield is represented by a marble bust at the Oregon State Capitol .
