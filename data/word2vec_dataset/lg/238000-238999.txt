 Coal balls often preserve a remarkable record of the microscopic tissue structure of Carboniferous swamp and mire plants , which would otherwise have been completely destroyed . Their unique preservation of Carboniferous plants makes them valuable to scientists , who cut and peel the coal balls to research the geological past . 
 In 1855 , two English scientists , Joseph Dalton Hooker and Edward William Binney , made the first scientific description of coal balls in England , and the initial research on coal balls was carried out in Europe . North American coal balls were discovered and identified in 1922 . Coal balls have since been found in other countries , leading to the discovery of hundreds of species and genera . 
 Coal balls may be found in coal seams across North America and Eurasia . North American coal balls are more widespread , both stratigraphically and geologically , than those in Europe . The oldest known coal balls date from the <unk> stage of the Carboniferous ; they were found in Germany and on the territory of former Czechoslovakia . 
 = = Introduction to the scientific world , and formation = = 
 The first scientific description of coal balls was made in 1855 by Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker and Edward William Binney , who reported on examples in the coal seams of Yorkshire and Lancashire , England . European scientists did much of the early research . 
 Coal balls in North America were first found in Iowa coal seams in 1894 , although the connection to European coal balls was not made until Adolf Carl Noé ( whose coal ball was found by Gilbert Cady ) drew the parallel in 1922 . Noé 's work renewed interest in coal balls , and by the 1930s had drawn <unk> from Europe to the Illinois Basin in search of them . 
 There are two theories – the autochthonous ( in situ ) theory and the allochthonous ( drift ) theory – that attempt to explain the formation of coal balls , although the subject is mostly speculation . 
 Supporters of the in situ theory believe that close to its present location organic matter accumulated near a peat bog and , shortly after burial , underwent permineralisation – minerals seeped into the organic matter and formed an internal cast . Water with a high dissolved mineral content was buried with the plant matter in a peat bog . As the dissolved ions crystallised , the mineral matter precipitated out . This caused concretions containing plant material to form and preserve as rounded lumps of stone . <unk> was thus prevented , and the peat was preserved and eventually became a coal ball . The majority of coal balls are found in bituminous and anthracite coal seams , in locations where the peat was not compressed sufficiently to render the material into coal . 
 Marie Stopes and David Watson analysed coal ball samples and decided that coal balls formed in situ . They stressed the importance of interaction with seawater , believing that it was necessary for the formation of coal balls . Some supporters of the in situ theory believe that Stopes ' and Watson 's discovery of a plant stem extending through multiple coal balls shows that coal balls formed in situ , stating that the drift theory fails to explain Stopes ' and Watson 's observation . They also cite fragile pieces of organic material projecting outside some coal balls , contending that if the drift theory was correct , the projections would have been destroyed , and some large coal balls are large enough that they could never have been able to be transported in the first place . 
 The drift theory holds that the organic material did not form in or near its present location . Rather , it asserts that the material that would become a coal ball was transported from another location by means of a flood or a storm . 
 Some supporters of the drift theory , such as Sergius <unk> and Ellis <unk> , believed that the presence of marine animals in coal balls proved material was transported from a marine to a non @-@ marine environment . Edward C. Jeffrey , stating that the in situ theory had " no good evidence " , believed that the formation of coal balls from transported material was likely because coal balls often included material formed by transport and sedimentation in open water . 
 = = = Contents = = = 
 Coal balls are not made of coal ; they are non @-@ flammable and useless for fuel . Coal balls are calcium @-@ rich <unk> life forms , mostly containing calcium and magnesium carbonates , pyrite , and quartz . Other minerals , including gypsum , illite , kaolinite , and <unk> also appear in coal balls , albeit in lesser quantities . Although coal balls are usually about the size of a man 's fist , their sizes vary greatly , ranging from that of a walnut up to 3 feet ( 1 m ) in diameter . Coal balls have been found that were smaller than a thimble . 
 Coal balls commonly contain dolomites , aragonite , and masses of organic matter at various stages of decomposition . Hooker and Binney analysed a coal ball and found " a lack of coniferous wood ... and fronds of ferns " and noted that the discovered plant matter " appear [ ed ] to [ have been arranged ] just as they fell from the plants that produced them " . Coal balls usually do not preserve the leaves of plants . 
 In 1962 , Sergius <unk> and Ellis <unk> analysed North American coal balls . Their discovery of marine organisms led to classification of coal balls were sorted into three types : normal ( sometimes known as floral ) , containing only plant matter ; faunal , containing animal fossils only ; and mixed , containing both plant and animal material . Mixed coal balls are further divided into heterogeneous , where the plant and animal material was distinctly separated ; and homogeneous , lacking that separation . 
 = = Preservation = = 
 The quality of preservation in coal balls varies from no preservation to the point of being able to analyse the cellular structures . Some coal balls contain preserved root hairs , pollen , and spores , and are described as being " more or less perfectly preserved " , containing " not what used to be the plant " , but rather , the plant itself . Others have been found to be " botanically worthless " , with the organic matter having deteriorated before becoming a coal ball . Coal balls with well @-@ preserved contents are useful to <unk> . They have been used to analyse the geographical distribution of vegetation : for example , providing evidence that Ukrainian and Oklahoman plants of the tropical belt were once the same . Research on coal balls has also led to the discovery of more than 130 genera and 350 species . 
 Three main factors determine the quality of preserved material in a coal ball : the mineral constituents , the speed of the burial process , and the degree of compression before undergoing permineralisation . Generally , coal balls resulting from remains that have a quick burial with little decay and pressure are better preserved , although plant remains in most coal balls almost always show differing signs of decay and collapse . Coal balls containing quantities of iron sulfide have far lower preservation than coal balls <unk> by magnesium or calcium carbonate , which has earned iron sulfide the title " chief curse of the coal ball hunter " . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Coal balls were first found in England , and later in other parts of the world , including Australia , Belgium , the Netherlands , the former Czechoslovakia , Germany , Ukraine , China , and Spain . They were also encountered in North America , where they are geographically widespread compared to Europe ; in the United States , coal balls have been found from Kansas to the Illinois Basin to the Appalachian region . 
 The oldest coal balls were from the early end of the <unk> stage ( 326 to 313 mya ) and discovered in Germany and former Czechoslovakia , but their ages generally range from the Permian ( 299 to 251 mya ) to the Upper Carboniferous . Some coal balls from the US vary in age from the later end of the Westphalian ( roughly 313 to 304 mya ) to the later <unk> ( roughly 304 to 299 mya ) . European coal balls are generally from the early end of the Westphalian Stage . 
 In coal seams , coal balls are completely surrounded by coal . They are often found randomly scattered throughout the seam in isolated groups , usually in the upper half of the seam . Their occurrence in coal seams can be either extremely sporadic or regular ; many coal seams have been found to contain no coal balls , while others have been found to contain so many coal balls that miners avoid the area entirely . 
 = = Analytical methods = = 
 Thin sectioning was an early procedure used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls . The process required cutting a coal ball with a diamond saw , then flattening and polishing the thin section with an abrasive . It would be glued to a slide and placed under a petrographic microscope for examination . Although the process could be done with a machine , the large amount of time needed and the poor quality of samples produced by thin sectioning gave way to a more convenient method . 
 The thin section technique was superseded by the now @-@ common liquid @-@ peel technique in 1928 . In this technique , peels are obtained by cutting the surface of a coal ball with a diamond saw , grinding the cut surface on a glass plate with silicon carbide to a smooth finish , and etching the cut and the surface with hydrochloric acid . The acid dissolves the mineral matter from the coal ball , leaving a projecting layer of plant cells . After applying acetone , a piece of cellulose acetate is placed on the coal ball . This embeds the cells preserved in the coal ball into the cellulose acetate . Upon drying , the cellulose acetate can be removed from the coal ball with a razor and the obtained peel can be stained with a low @-@ acidity stain and observed under a microscope . Up to 50 peels can be extracted from 2 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 079 in ) of coal ball with this method . 
 However , the peels will degrade over time if they contain any iron sulfide ( pyrite or marcasite ) . <unk> <unk> addressed this problem by revising the liquid @-@ peel technique to separate the organic material preserved by the coal ball from the inorganic minerals , including iron sulfide . This allows the peel to retain its quality for a longer time . <unk> 's revisions begin after grinding the surface of the coal ball to a smooth finish . Her process essentially entails heating and then making multiple applications of solutions of paraffin in xylene to the coal ball . Each subsequent application has a greater concentration of paraffin in xylene to allow the wax to completely pervade the coal ball . Nitric acid , and then acetone , are applied to the coal ball . Following that , the process merges back into the liquid peel technique . 
 X @-@ ray powder diffraction has also been used to analyse coal balls . The X @-@ rays of a predetermined wavelength are sent through a sample to examine its structure . This reveals information about the crystallographic structure , chemical composition , and physical properties of the examined material . The scattered intensity of the X @-@ ray pattern is observed and analysed , with the measurements consisting of incident and scattered angle , polarisation , and wavelength or energy . 
 = M @-@ 84 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 84 is a state trunkline highway in the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan . The highway starts on the west side of Saginaw at an intersection with M @-@ 58 and runs north through residential and commercial areas . There are two colleges or universities near the trunkline as it connects Saginaw with Bay City , providing an alternate to the freeway that carries Interstate 75 / US Highway 23 ( I @-@ 75 / US 23 ) . The northern terminus is at a pair of intersections with M @-@ 25 on the east side of the Saginaw River in Bay City . 
 There have been two other highways to bear the M @-@ 84 moniker . The first was one in the Upper Peninsula and the second was in The Thumb area . The current highway was originally part of M @-@ 47 until that road was relocated onto what was formerly US 10 in the Tri @-@ Cities area . Since the 1960s reuse of the number , M @-@ 84 has been extended in the 1970s to replace part of Business Loop I @-@ 75 ( BL I @-@ 75 , now Business Spur I @-@ 75 , BS I @-@ 75 ) in Bay City . Other projects have reconstructed and widened the roadway through the Bay City area in the early 21st century . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 84 begins at M @-@ 58 in a residential area on the west side of Saginaw heading due north on Bay Street . At this point , it is five lanes , with two lanes in each direction and a center turn lane . The highway enters Saginaw Township as Bay Road and serves as a major artery in the area , passing the Fashion Square Mall and several other shopping centers and major retail stores near Tittabawassee Road . The main entrance to Saginaw Valley State University is located on M @-@ 84 at Pierce Road just south of the Saginaw – Bay county line . 
 North of the line , the highway follows West Side Saginaw Road through fields in a less urbanized area . West of University Center and the campus of Delta College , M @-@ 84 crosses over I @-@ 75 / US 23 at exit 160 and proceeds through several curves into Bay City . At the intersection with Euclid Avenue on the city line , M @-@ 13 merges in from the north and the two highways run concurrently along Salzburg Avenue . Since this segment of highway is both northbound M @-@ 84 and southbound M @-@ 13 along eastbound Salzburg Avenue , the two trunklines form a wrong @-@ way concurrency . 
 M @-@ 13 / M @-@ 84 crosses the west channel of the Saginaw River near the Ted Putz Nature Area to Middle Ground island . The highway continues over the east channel on the Lafayette Avenue Bridge , a drawbridge , to Lafayette Avenue on the eastern bank of the river . At the intersection with Broadway Street , M @-@ 13 turns southward , and M @-@ 84 continues eastward two more blocks . Turning north on Garfield Street , the highway runs parallel to the river through a residential area . North of the 14th Street intersection , Garfield Street curves northeasterly into Washington Avenue , passing to the east of an industrial complex on the river . At the intersection with McKinley Street , a one @-@ way street , M @-@ 84 meets the eastbound direction of M @-@ 25 and BS I @-@ 75 . One block north , M @-@ 84 terminates at the intersection with 7th Street , which carries westbound M @-@ 25 and BS I @-@ 75 ; both intersections also mark BS I @-@ 75 's terminus immediately east of the Veterans Memorial Bridge . 
 The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) maintains M @-@ 84 like other state highways in Michigan . As a part of these maintenance responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction . These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic , which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway . MDOT 's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic level along M @-@ 84 was 26 @,@ 408 vehicles daily in Saginaw ; the lowest count was 8 @,@ 405 vehicles per day on Washington Street in Bay City . Two sections of M @-@ 84 have been listed on the National Highway System ; the section from the southern terminus north to Tittabawassee Road in the Saginaw area , and from the I @-@ 75 / US 23 interchange north to M @-@ 25 in the Bay City area . The system is a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . 
 = = History = = 
 The first M @-@ 84 in Michigan was in the Upper Peninsula starting in 1919 ; the highway ran from Garnet to <unk> Corner , southeast of Newberry , following the current <unk> Road in Mackinac County and County Road 393 in Luce County . The highway was replaced by an extension of M @-@ 48 in 1926 . The M @-@ 84 designation was then immediately reused for a section of the former M @-@ 31 in The Thumb ; it ran from M @-@ 81 near Reese running through Fairgrove and Akron to M @-@ 29 at Unionville . This iteration was replaced by M @-@ 83 in 1930 . 
 The I @-@ 75 / US 10 / US 23 freeway was completed between Saginaw and Bay City in late 1960 or early 1961 ; M @-@ 47 was relocated to the former US 10 between Saginaw and Midland , and M @-@ 84 was redesignated along the former M @-@ 47 between M @-@ 81 at Saginaw and the freeway in Bay City . A new BL I @-@ 75 was created at the same time along the former M @-@ 47 in Bay City . This business loop would be split in half in 1971 resulting in a new business spur ; M @-@ 84 was extended over the southern section between M @-@ 25 and I @-@ 75 / US 10 / US 23 . 
 A reconstruction project in 2004 – 05 resulted in the roadway being widened to four lanes between Pierce Road in <unk> Township of Saginaw County and Delta Road in <unk> Township in Bay County . The 2009 reconstruction resulted in new bridges over I @-@ 75 and widening of the road from Delta Road to 2 Mile Road . Additional construction scheduled for 2011 resulted in the widening of the road from 2 Mile to Euclid .

 Peace negotiations with the Taliban were announced by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after his election , although previous attempts to engage TTP in dialogue had failed . The first session of talks , between committees appointed by the Pakistani Government and the Taliban , was held on 26 March 2014 at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad . The Taliban did not name representatives from their ranks , instead nominating pro @-@ Taliban religious figures to present their views . The terrorists called for the implementation of Sharia in Pakistan ; the Government of Pakistan demanded the cessation of hostilities , insisting that talks be held within the framework of the Pakistani constitution . A month @-@ long ceasefire was reached on 1 March 2014 . 
 Besides the meetings at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House , negotiations also involved helicopter travel by government representatives to the areas under militant control near the Pakistan @-@ Afghanistan border . The government had indicated that stronger military action would be implemented if the talks failed . 
 = = = = Failure = = = = 
 Negotiations collapsed after the execution of 23 Pakistani Frontier Corps soldiers by the Taliban on 17 February 2014 . The soldiers had been held by the insurgents since 2010 , and on 17 April 2014 the TTP formally ended the ceasefire . Taliban infighting since March 2014 killed more than 90 militants . The strife , triggered by differences between the Mehsud group ( led by <unk> Mehsud ) and another TTP faction ( led by Khan Said <unk> ) , impeded the negotiations . The negotiations were irreversibly damaged by a terrorist attack on Karachi Airport for which the Taliban claimed responsibility and which killed 28 people ( including security personnel ) . A Pakistani military official was quoted to have said , " The army is ready for an operation . It now all depends on the government to make a decision . "

 The operation began one week after a terrorist attack on Pakistan 's busiest airport . On 8 June 2014 , 10 militants from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and TTP attacked Jinnah International Airport , Karachi , killing 28 people including security personnel and wounding at least 18 . 
 In retaliation , the Pakistani military launched a series of air @-@ strikes targeting terrorist hideouts in the areas bordering Afghanistan . At least 25 militants were killed on 10 June . The figure also included foreign militants killed . Two drone attacks on 12 June killed Uzbek , Afghan and local militants . On 15 June the Pakistani military intensified air @-@ strikes and bombed eight foreign militant hideouts , killing as many as 140 militants ( most Uzbek , including persons linked to the airport attack and airport attack commander and mastermind Abu Abdur Rehman <unk> ) in North Waziristan .

 The Pakistani military had prepared for the operation long before , and the government prepared for a three @-@ front operation : isolating targeted militant groups , obtaining support from the political parties and saving civilians from the backlash of the operation . 
 Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that the nation stood by its military : " The decision was taken after the strategy of dialogue failed . The operation will continue until it reaches its logical conclusion . Any group that challenges Pakistan 's constitution , attacks civilians , soldiers , and government installations and uses Pakistani territory to plan terrorist attacks will be targeted " . Asif added that internally displaced persons would be assisted by the federal and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments : " We will try to ensure that the displaced do not have to stay away from their homes for too long . " 
 The combat troops encircled militant bases in the towns of Mirali and Miranshah . Pakistani officials said that the Afghan 's National Security Forces ( ANSF ) were requested to seal the border on their side so that militants do not escape . The operation involved the Air Force , Navy artillery , tanks and ground troops . According to a military statement , " On the directions of the government , armed forces of Pakistan have launched a comprehensive operation against foreign and local terrorists who are hiding in sanctuaries in North Waziristan . " An official with the military said that between 14 @,@ 000 and 20 @,@ 000 soldiers were normally stationed in North Waziristan before the operation , and he expected the offensive to require no more than a total of 30 @,@ 000 troops .

 United States – The US supported military operations against Taliban militants , a spokesman from the US Embassy in Pakistan said on 16 June , and the US supported every Pakistani step taken for the establishment of peace . The United States had pressured Pakistan for a military operation in North Waziristan for years , and the US Congress linked military assistance to Pakistan for the next fiscal year with military operations in North Waziristan in June 2014 . Rear Adm. John Kirby , the Pentagon press secretary , said that the Pentagon was unaware of Pakistan 's decision to launch a new offensive in North Waziristan : " The Pakistan military and the government understand the threat , and they continue to go after that threat . " On 5 November 2014 , Lt. Gen.

In weeks , a number of high @-@ value detainees convicted on a terrorism charges were hanged . 
 Since December 2014 , Pakistan 's intelligence community , law enforcement agencies , <unk> forces , and inter @-@ provincial police have been engaged in deadly police encounters in all over the country . News media have been televising the live actions on tracking down the militants and targeting the TTP operatives in series of police encounters . In the afternoon of 20 December , the KP Police and the special agents of the FIA raided a safe house in <unk> , a town located in 30 km ( 19 mi ) north of Peshawar . In an exchange of fire at the safe house , the KPK police and the other law enforcement agencies gunned down the six TTP fighters , including their commander and two other high @-@ value targets who assisted in the attack . At the night of 20 December , the team of Pakistan Rangers personnel raided a safe house in <unk> area of Karachi and killed five members of the TTP in a deadly shoot out . 
 On 22 December 2014 , Karachi Police and the CID teams chased down and killed the TTP leader , Abid <unk> , along with his three associates in a police encounter . The same night , another action in took place in Karachi when the CID teams , in a high @-@ speed chase in Hawke 's Bay Beach , chased and apprehended five members of al @-@ Qaeda 's South Asian chapter who are suspected of planning an attack on a naval dockyard in Karachi in September . 
 Acting on a MI information , the navy 's SSGN teams were inserted in secret hideout in Khyber Agency and stalked the six terrorists led by Saddam Jan — the mastermind of the Army Public School attack — at the midnight of 26 December 2014 . In a late night operations , the SSGN combat teams reportedly hunted and killed Jan along with his six militants , while trying to seek sanctuary . An unnamed senior Pakistan government official confirmed the report . 
 On 9 January 2015 , the CID teams gunned down the four al @-@ Qaeda operatives after another high speed chase took place in <unk> in Karachi .

 = Toxotes chatareus = 
 Toxotes chatareus , sometimes known by the common names seven @-@ spot archerfish or largescale archerfish , is a species of perciform fish in the archerfish genus Toxotes . 
 They are usually no larger than 20 centimetres ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) but may grow up to 40 centimetres ( 16 in ) . Unlike most archerfish , T. chatareus are sooty rather than silvery in colour . They are omnivorous , feeding on insects , fish , and vegetative matter at the surface of the water . Breeding occurs in the wet season , and 20 @,@ 000 to 150 @,@ 000 eggs may be laid at one time . 
 T. chatareus are distributed throughout southeast Asia and the Indo @-@ Pacific and Australia . They may live in brackish or fresh water , inhabiting mangrove swamps and estuaries as well as further upstream in slow @-@ moving rivers . While occasionally caught and eaten , T. chatareus are more commonly kept in the aquarium . They may be sold with other <unk> under the collective label " archerfish " . Caring for T. chatareus in aquaria is somewhat difficult as they need live food given at the surface , rather than flake food . 
 = = Description = = 
 Toxotes chatareus are of moderate size , usually between 15 and 20 centimetres ( 5 @.@ 9 and 7 @.@ 9 in ) . Rarely , they may reach up to 40 centimetres ( 16 in ) in length . T. chatareus weigh up to 700 grams ( 25 oz ) . T. chatareus are believed to have a lifespan of three to five years . 
 T. chatareus have five or six dorsal spines , the fourth of which is the longest , and twelve or thirteen dorsal soft rays . The dorsal spines are generally shorter in specimens collected from freshwater than those from brackish water . T. chatareus also have three anal spines and fifteen to seventeen anal soft rays . T. chatareus have 33 or 34 lateral line scales . The caudal ( tail ) fin in almost square . The anal fin is undivided and the third anal spine is longest . 
 Overall , the body is sooty but sometimes silvery or gold . The dorsal side is " greenish brown " . The pectoral fins are clear or " dusky " in colour . Pelvic fins may be darker and heavily pigmented . T. chatareus are white and usually has six or seven dark blotches , alternating long and short , along the dorsal side . A dark blotch is also found at the base of the caudal fin . The colour of these blotches may become darker or lighter due to time of day , environment , and stress . The blotches of young fish are darker than those of older fish . Startled or stressed fish are darker than unstressed fish ; fish found in cloudy water may be completely white . It is unknown whether sexual dimorphism occurs . 
 = = = Comparison to other archerfish = = = 
 T. chatareus can be distinguished by their sooty colour , as opposed to the typical silver of most other archerfish . They have five dorsal spines , whereas T. jaculatrix have four . The markings on their flanks are also alternating long and short spots rather than bands . T. chatareus also have six or seven markings on its sides , whilst banded archerfish have four to five . T. chatareus has 29 – 30 lateral line scales , compared to 33 – 35 in T. jaculatrix . T. chatareus are also less common upstream than T. microlepis . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Diet and feeding = = = 
 Like other archerfish , Toxotes chatareus are able to spit streams of water to knock prey into the water . Despite lacking a neocortex , T. chatareus has well @-@ developed visual cognition and pattern @-@ recognition abilities which allow it to hit prey at distances of up to 150 centimetres ( 59 in ) against complex backgrounds . Behaviour studies on the visual processing of T. chatareus have found that this species is able to recognize and distinguish between different human faces . They feed during the day , consuming plant matter and insects . They are omnivorous ; their diet comprises crustaceans and other fishes , as well as zooplankton , rotifers , <unk> , and insects ( terrestrial and aquatic ) . T. chatareus has been called a " specialised insectivore " because it does not prey upon certain insects , particularly those that feed upon C4 plants . Diet appears to be ontogenetic ( varying with age ) ; small fish do not consume any vegetative matter , whilst it comprises one @-@ fourth of the diet of larger fish . Diet also varies with location ; when upstream , T. chatareus feed on insects , but when in the estuary , they feed on crustaceans . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Toxotes chatareus reproduce by spawning . Spawning in T. chatareus are <unk> ( females only spawn once per season ) and iteroparous ( spawning occurs more than once in a fish 's lifespan ) . Breeding in Toxotes chatareus occurs in the wet season . T. chatareus breed both in brackish and in fresh water . Spawning occurs in shallow , muddy lagoons . Females lay about 20 @,@ 000 to 150 @,@ 000 buoyant eggs , each 0 @.@ 4 millimetres in diameter . Females become mature at about 19 centimetres ( 7 @.@ 5 in ) , and males become mature at about 18 centimetres ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) . T. chatareus become reproductively active at 24 months . When they first hatch , larvae may be less than 4 mm in length ; when they first feed , they are 5 mm and their mouthparts have become well @-@ developed . There is no parental care in this species . Breeding in this species does not involve travelling downstream ; nonetheless , populations may be affected by the construction of obstacles along rivers they inhabit . T. chatareus has not been bred in captivity . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 Toxotes chatareus are found in India , Burma , Indonesia and New Guinea , and northern Australia . They are generally found in temperature ranges of 25 to 30 ° C ( 77 to 86 ° F ) , though they have been recorded at temperatures as high as 36 ° C ( 97 ° F ) in the Alligator Rivers region and as low as 20 @.@ 5 ° C ( 68 @.@ 9 ° F ) in the Burdekin river region ; these are believed to be the upper and lower limits of their tolerance , respectively . Brackish mangrove swamps form its main habitat , but T. chatareus are also found in freshwater rivers and streams . It occurs in rivers of the Kimberley region of Western Australia , the Kakadu area of the Northern Territory and Arnhem Land in Australia . On the Mekong river , it may be found as far north as Thailand and Laos . They are also found in the upper parts of the Burdekin river , somehow having overcome the Burdekin Falls . T. chatareus are distributed more " patchily " in eastern Australia , and are less abundant . 
 T. chatareus are known to occur in shaded areas with vegetation overhead , usually at the top layer of the water column . They are found only where there is an intact riparian area , as this is a major source of their food . T. chatareus are usually not found in fast @-@ flowing streams . 
 = = Relationship to humans = = 
 Toxotes chatareus have a minor part in fisheries . They are sometimes caught by anglers and are described as " reasonable eating " . T. chatareus are caught and sold in markets , where they are often grouped with the banded archerfish and simply sold as " archerfish " . 
 T. chatareus are sometimes kept in the aquarium . In aquaria , they can reach about 20 centimetres ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) in length , compared to 40 centimetres ( 16 in ) in the wild . They are one of only three archerfish species to be commonly traded ( the others being T. jaculatrix and T. microlepis ) . They are placed in an aquarium in a minimum size of 100 centimetres ( 39 in ) deep with a volume of 170 to 209 litres ( 37 to 46 imp gal ; 45 to 55 US gal ) . T. chatareus prefer brackish water and need a tall aquarium . T. chatareus have the ability to " jump " out of the water , which in the wild is used to capture prey on low @-@ hanging branches ; they are capable of jumping out of an aquarium that is too short or uncovered . They are compatible with others of their species of similar size , but larger individuals may harass smaller individuals . T. chatareus is fed live food at the surface , though it does occasionally take flake food ; because of this , caring for them is not done by beginners in most home aquaria . 
 T. chatareus are fairly common and not considered endangered . However , the destruction of their mangrove swamp habitat and increased fishing pressure may pose a risk in the future . The construction of weirs and tidal barrages within its habitat may affect populations in rivers . The growing population in Southeast Asia is also causing pollution to its habitat . 
 A study found increased ( greater than 0 @.@ 5 μg / g ) levels of mercury in four out of ten specimens sampled at Lake Murray in Papua New Guinea . This may have contributed to increased mercury levels in locals who consumed several species of fish from the lake , T. chatareus included . Compared to the other fishes tested , T. chatareus displayed a high level of mercury . Sediments from the nearby <unk> gold and silver mine are the source of this mercury ; the cause of the high level at which the mercury was accumulated in T. chatareus is not known . 
 = USS West Lianga ( ID @-@ 2758 ) = 
 USS West Lianga ( ID @-@ 2758 ) was a cargo ship for the United States Navy during World War I. She was later known as SS Helen Whittier and SS Kalani in civilian service under American registry , as SS Empire Cheetah under British registry , and as SS Hobbema under Dutch registry . 
 West Lianga was launched for the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) in May 1918 as a part of the West boats , a series of steel @-@ hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States for the World War I war effort . West Lianga briefly had the distinction of being the fastest @-@ launched and fastest @-@ completed ocean @-@ going ship in the world . Pressed into cargo service for the US Navy , USS West Lianga was commissioned into the Naval Overseas Transportation Service ( NOTS ) and completed four round @-@ trip voyages to France for the Navy . After decommissioning in mid 1919 , she was briefly in cargo service out of Seattle before being laid up in late 1921 . 
 West Lianga was sold to the Los Angeles Steamship Company ( LASSCO ) in early 1929 , refurbished , and renamed Helen Whittier for intercoastal cargo service . When Matson Navigation Company purchased LASSCO in 1931 , Helen Whittier frequently sailed on Matson 's Hawaiian sugar routes . She was renamed Kalani in 1938 and continued in Hawaiian service until 1940 when she was sold to British interests to help fill the United Kingdom 's urgent need for merchant ships . 
 After sailing to the UK as Kalani , the ship was renamed Empire Cheetah and sailed in transatlantic convoys , making three round trips between February 1941 and May 1942 . At that time , Empire Cheetah was transferred to Dutch interests and renamed Hobbema . She successfully completed one transatlantic roundtrip under Dutch registry and was on the homeward leg of her second in Convoy SC 107 , when that convoy was attacked by a wolf pack of German submarines . Shortly after midnight on 4 November 1942 , Hobbema was struck in the engine room by a single torpedo fired by German submarine U @-@ 132 . Of Hobbema 's complement of 44 men and British gunners aboard , only 16 survived the attack . Hobbema was one of 19 Allied ships in the convoy sunk by German submarines . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 The West ships were cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States for the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) for emergency use during World War I. All were given names that began with the word West , like West Lianga , one of some 24 West ships built by Skinner & Eddy of Seattle , Washington . West Lianga ( Skinner & Eddy No. 21 ; USSB No. 1176 ) was laid down on 14 February 1918 . When she was launched on 20 April with an elapsed time of 55 working days — 65 calendar days — from keel laying to launch , it was in world @-@ record time , beating the launch of Columbia River Shipbuilding 's West Grove , launched after 61 working days in March . 
 When West Lianga was completed on 4 May , 67 working days after her keel laying , it was another world record , shaving 18 days off of Columbia River Shipbuilding 's previous record . By 1920 , West Lianga had fallen to third @-@ fastest when Edward N. Hurley , the wartime chairman of the USSB , compiled a list of the ten fastest @-@ constructed ocean @-@ going vessels for his 1920 book The New Merchant Marine . Skinner & Eddy received a $ 71 @,@ 600 bonus for completing the ship early . 
 West Lianga was 5 @,@ 673 gross register tons ( GRT ) , and was 409 feet 5 inches ( 124 @.@ 79 m ) long ( between perpendiculars ) and 54 feet 2 inches ( 16 @.@ 51 m ) abeam . West Lianga had a steel hull and a deadweight tonnage of 8 @,@ 800 DWT . The ship had a single steam turbine that drove her single screw propeller which moved the ship at an 11 @.@ 5 @-@ knot ( 21 @.@ 3 km / h ) pace . 
 = = World War I = = 
 West Lianga 's activities after her 4 May delivery to the USSB are not entirely clear . Many West ships , to avoid sailing empty to the East Coast , loaded grain products intended for the United Kingdom , France , and Italy and sailed to Europe without unloading or transferring their cargo , but it is not known whether West Lianga did so or not . Whatever her early activities , West Lianga was handed over to the United States Navy at Brooklyn in August 1918 and assigned the identification number 2758 . USS West Lianga was commissioned into the Naval Overseas Transportation Service ( NOTS ) on 19 August with Lieutenant Commander Louis <unk> , USNRF , in command . 
 At New York , West Lianga took on a load of 6 @,@ 882 tons of materiel for the United States Army and a deck @-@ load of 32 trucks and departed for France in a convoy . After unloading her cargo at Bordeaux , she returned to New York on 16 October . After voyage repairs , she loaded another 6 @,@ 685 tons of cargo for the Quartermaster Corps and departed for Europe on 3 November . West Lianga was en route to France when the Armistice that ended fighting was signed on 11 November . West Lianga delivered her cargo to Saint @-@ Nazaire and took on a load of 1 @,@ 700 tons for delivery to the United States . After departing from France on 21 December , West Lianga arrived at New York on 4 January 1919 . 
 After shifting to New Orleans and taking on a load of cargo there , West Lianga began her third voyage to France . After making her delivery at Brest , the cargo ship took on a load of steel rails and sand as ballast and sailed for Newport News , Virginia , where she arrived on 21 March . She loaded railroad supplies for the Quartermaster Corps and sailed on 4 April on what would be her final NOTS trip to France . After delivery at La Pallice , West Lianga returned to New York on 10 June . Two weeks later , she was decommissioned , struck from the Navy list , and returned to the USSB .

 After her return to the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) in June 1919 , West Lianga returned to Seattle and was based out of there for several years of operation . The United States Official Number <unk> was allocated . On 7 September 1921 , the ship was laid up in the reserve fleet at Norfolk . On 19 February 1929 , the USSB sold West Lianga to the Los Angeles Steamship Company ( LASSCO ) for $ 100 @,@ 000 on the basis of unrestricted operation . LASSCO , which announced plans for a $ 50 @,@ 000 overhaul and reconditioning of the ship for operation on its Arrow Line intercoastal cargo service , paid ten percent in cash and signed a note for the balance to be paid over the next ten years . 
 On 12 March , LASSCO changed West Lianga 's port of registry from Seattle to Los Angeles , and on 26 March , announced that the ship had been renamed Helen Whittier after the daughter of California oil pioneer Max Whittier . The Code Letters <unk> were allocated . LASSCO also announced that Helen Whittier , to be operated by Sudden and Christenson Steamship Company for LASSCO , was scheduled to sail from Baltimore on 25 April to begin her intercoastal service . 
 Helen Whittier 's activities over the next two years were not recorded in contemporary newspaper accounts , but she was affected by the absorption of LASSCO into its former competitor , Matson Navigation Company , on 1 January 1931 . In late August 1931 , Helen Whittier was added to Matson 's Hawaiian sugar service to Gulf Coast and North Atlantic ports . 
 Helen Whittier had returned to intercoastal service by early 1934 when The New York Times reported that she had sailed from San Francisco on 23 March and arrived at New York on 25 April . In June that same year , Helen Whittier was one of the Matson ships added to carry food cargo to Hawaii . Shipments of food from the mainland — which accounted for up to 90 % of Hawaii 's needs — had been curtailed as a coastwise strike had affected all ports except Los Angeles . Helen Whittier sailed on her first food delivery on 23 June with 2 @,@ 500 tons of food from Los Angeles to Honolulu . 
 <unk> 1935 , her Code Letters were change to <unk> . In February 1935 , Helen Whittier was returned to the Hawaiian sugar service full @-@ time . During her time on this service , Helen Whittier often called at New York . One typical voyage , as tracked in The New York Times , began when she departed New York on 23 November for Honolulu , passed through the Panama Canal on 4 December , and arrived at Honolulu . Helen Whittier departed there on 11 January 1936 and arrived at New York again on 16 February . Occasionally , Helen Whittier would make side trips to Baltimore for voyage repairs between her arrival at New York and her next departure for Hawaii . The cargo ship continued her Honolulu – New York service through September 1936 . 
 In 1938 , Matson renamed the ship Kalani , and continued using her in Hawaiian service through 1940 . On 15 July 1940 , Matson received the permission of the United States Maritime Commission , a successor to the USSB , to sell Kalani to Sir R. <unk> & Co . , Ltd . , of West Hartlepool . Six days after the approval , Kalani , now under British registry , departed from Los Angeles for New York .

 Kalani , acquired to fill the United Kingdom 's urgent need for merchant vessels , was operated by <unk> under the authority of the Ministry of War Transport . After departing Panama on 4 August , Kalani arrived at New York on 13 August . Kalani shuttled between New York , Albany , and Boston , ending up at Baltimore on 25 August . Sailing from there on 15 September with a load of pig iron , she arrived at Halifax five days later . She departed from Halifax for Liverpool as a part of convoy HX 78 on 4 October but had to turn back and put in at Sydney , Nova Scotia . Kalani set out again on 15 October as a part of Convoy SC 8 , a Sydney – Liverpool convoy . Kalani departed the convoy and arrived at Clyde on 31 October .

 Kalani was renamed Empire Cheetah on 12 November , two weeks into a three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ month stay at Clyde . Her port of registry was London . The United Kingdom Official Number <unk> and Code Letters <unk> were allocated . Empire Cheetah departed on her first transatlantic voyage under her new name when she sailed with convoy OB 288 on 18 February 1941 . After the convoy came under attack by German bombers and the convoy escorts departed , the convoy dispersed . Although nine convoy ships were sunk by six German and two Italian submarines on 23 – 24 February , Empire Cheetah safely reached her destination of Philadelphia on 10 March . 
 After taking on a load of steel , Empire Cheetah sailed for Halifax , and then on to Newport , Monmouthshire as a part of convoy HX 122 , arriving on 9 May . She sailed for Swansea on 27 May , and on to Milford Haven on 9 June . On 26 June , she sailed as a part of convoy OB 339 but put back into Milford Haven with defects . Empire Cheetah tried again as a part of convoy OB 343 on 6 July but had to return once again , putting in at Clyde on 9 July . 
 After a month at Clyde , Empire Cheetah set out a third time for North America in convoy ON 7 which , although dispersed mid @-@ ocean , lost no ships to submarines . Empire Cheetah successfully reached her destination of Boston on 3 September . From there she made her way to Philadelphia on 3 October , and on to Sydney on 23 October . There she joined convoy SC 51 sailing for Holyhead and Manchester the same day with a cargo of grain , steel , and cotton . She arrived at Holyhead on 8 November , but departed for Liverpool three days later . After returning to Holyhead later in the month , Empire Cheetah sailed in convoy BB 106 to Barry , where she arrived on 1 December . 
 Empire Cheetah spent two and a half months at Barry before sailing to Swansea on 14 February 1942 . Heading to Milford Haven on 23 February , she sailed the next day as a part of convoy ON 70 headed to Portland , Maine , where she safely arrived on 20 March after an intermediate stop at Halifax from 15 – 18 March . Four days later , Empire Cheetah sailed for Boston . She departed Boston on 12 April for Halifax and departed from there in convoy SC 80 five days later for Hull with a general cargo . Empire Cheetah arrived at Loch Ewe on 2 May and sailed the next day for Methil . After arriving at Methil on 6 May , she headed to her destination of Hull on 7 May .

Hobbema was placed under the management of the British & Continental Shipping Agency Ltd . 
 Hobbema departed Hull on 23 May and called at Methil and Loch Ewe before sailing for New York as a part of convoy ON 100 on 2 June . After an intermediate stop at Halifax , Hobbema arrived at the Cape Cod Canal on 19 June and proceeded on to New York where she arrived the next day . After making two trips to Philadelphia and back , she departed for Cape Cod Bay to form up with convoy BX 28 for Halifax , where she arrived on 11 July . Hobbema sailed from Halifax to Sydney , Nova Scotia , in convoy HS 28 , and from there sailed on 17 July for Liverpool with convoy SC 92 . After her arrival on 31 July , she spent nearly a month at Liverpool before joining convoy ON 126 for New York , arriving at that destination on 19 September . 
 Hobbema sailed the next day for Newport News and took on 7 @,@ 000 long tons ( 7 @,@ 100 t ) of general cargo and ammunition and returned to New York on 15 October . She sailed nine days later as a part of convoy SC 107 headed for Liverpool .

After getting into position and dodging convoy escorts over the next two days , the wolf pack attacked the convoy on the night of 1 – 2 November and sank seven ships . Another ship was sunk during the day on 2 November . On the night of 2 – 3 November the convoy sailed through thick fog that concealed its location and kept the U @-@ boats at bay . At dawn the fog had lifted and another ship was sunk . 
 After dark , the wolf pack struck again . At 00 : 10 on 4 November U @-@ 132 closed in and torpedoed Hobbema , Empire Lynx and Hatimura . At 00 : 15 , a single torpedo from U @-@ 132 hit Hobbema on the starboard side in the engine room , immediately knocking out power to the ship , and caused her to begin rapidly sinking . The lifeboats and several life rafts from the port side were launched with 16 men on board . The ship 's master and 20 crewmen along with 7 British gunners died in the attack and sinking . US Navy tugs Uncas and <unk> rescued Hobbema 's survivors . 
 At 00 : 40 the entire convoy and nearby U @-@ boats were jolted by a very heavy explosion thought to have been one of the largest prior to atomic bomb testing . The explosion stopped the engine of the tug Uncas rescuing survivors six miles astern of the convoy . SS Titus was rescuing survivors from Empire Lynx when the explosion lifted her bow so violently the crew believed Titus had been torpedoed . The crew abandoned ship before the master realized Titus was undamaged and reboarded to sail to England with a skeleton crew including some Empire Lynx and Hatimura survivors . Titus was drydocked upon arrival in England , but the only damage found was a small dent in her port side . U @-@ 132 is believed to have been destroyed by the explosion . The cause of the explosion is unknown , but it is assumed to have resulted from detonation of the ammunition cargo aboard either Hobbema or Hatimura . In all , 19 Allied ships were sunk from convoy SC 107 .

 Super Mario 3D Land ( <unk> , Sūpā Mario Surī Dī Rando ) is a platform game in the Super Mario series developed by Nintendo EAD Tokyo , with development assistance from Brownie Brown , for the Nintendo 3DS . The game was the first in the series to be released for the system , and was released worldwide in November 2011 . It was revealed at Nintendo 's Keynote Conference during the 2011 Game Developers Conference held in San Francisco . A sequel , titled Super Mario 3D World , was released for the Wii U in 2013 . 
 Super Mario 3D Land is unique from other games in the Mario series , as it combines elements from both traditional 2D Mario side @-@ scrolling games and modern free @-@ roaming 3D Mario games . It also introduces new elements into the series , including new power @-@ ups and gameplay mechanics . The main story is similar to previous Super Mario titles , centering on Mario 's efforts to rescue Princess Peach , who has been kidnapped by Bowser , utilizing the aid of the Tanooki Suit amongst other power @-@ ups . The game consists of 96 distinct levels allotted among the 16 worlds . 
 The game was released to critical acclaim , with gaming critics praising the amount of creativity and technical design presented within the game , though the utilization of 3D into the gameplay was met with a more polarizing reception . The game was a commercial success , and has sold 10 @.@ 73 million copies worldwide as of March 31 , 2016 , making it the fourth best @-@ selling game for the 3DS . It was also the first 3DS game to sell over 5 million copies . 
 Nintendo re @-@ released the game as a downloadable title via Nintendo eShop . The downloadable version was released in the PAL region on October 4 , 2012 , October 18 , 2012 in North America , and November 1 , 2012 in Japan .

 Super Mario 3D Land is a platform game that has been described by game designer Shigeru Miyamoto as a " 3D Mario that plays as a 2D Mario game " . As such , Super Mario 3D Land combines the elements of traditional side @-@ scrolling video game titles , such as linear @-@ based levels , with those of the modern open world titles , such as moving Mario in three dimensions and performing a variety of actions . Similar to the older side @-@ scrolling Mario games , the health system revolves around Mario shrinking upon taking damage from enemies or hazards , having a dedicated " Dash " button as opposed to using analog input to determine travel speed , and damage while as " Small Mario " results in losing a life . Mario has also learned two new moves : a barrel roll and a roll jump , the former of which can be used to break blocks in a similar manner to jumping at blocks from below or ground pounding , and the latter allowing Mario to cover much horizontal ground in one jump . Super Mario 3D Land utilizes a similar level objective to those games , in which the point of each level is to reach and grab the " Goal Pole " located at the end of the course before the time limit expires . 
 The game offers a number of traditional Mario items , such as the Super Mushroom , Fire Flower , and Starman , along with new power @-@ ups that bestow special suits onto Mario and grant him new abilities . Returning from Super Mario Bros. 3 is the Super Leaf power @-@ up , which gives Mario the Tanooki suit , allowing him to float in the air and attack with his tail , with a later variant also allowing him to transform into a statue upon performing a ground pound . The player is able to reserve an extra power @-@ up , which can be retrieved by tapping the item visible on the touchscreen . 
 Other items include the Boomerang Flower , which allows Mario to throw boomerangs that can collect out @-@ of @-@ reach items as well as attack enemies ; the Propeller Box , which allows Mario to reach high places ; and the rare Prize Box , which gives Mario extra Coins while walking around in it . The <unk> Leaf , which appears after the player dies five times in a level , gives Mario invincibility and Tanooki Suit abilities ; while the P @-@ Wing , which appears after the player dies ten times in a level , sends the player right to the end of the level , near the Goal Pole . ( The invincibility leaf and the P @-@ wing are only available in regular worlds . ) Each course contains three hidden Star Medals that are required to unlock certain levels . The map screen also contains Toad Houses where players can visit Toad and receive additional items , and Mystery Boxes where more Star Medals can be earned . After clearing the game once , a set of " Special " levels are unlocked , some of which contain additional challenges , such as a 30 @-@ second time limit . Clearing the S1 castle unlocks Luigi as a playable character , who has slightly different handling to Mario . 
 Super Mario 3D Land utilizes the Nintendo 3DS 's autostereoscopic technology , allowing players to perceive depth when viewing the game screen . While the game is designed to not require the 3D effect , some obstacles or points of interest are deliberately more noticeable or easier when the 3D is switched on . Super Mario 3D Land also utilizes optional use of the 3DS gyroscope , which can be used to control cannons and binoculars . The game also features StreetPass functionality , allowing players to exchange Mystery Boxes containing bonus items . StreetPass also gives players another Toad house so they can get items .

 During a heavy thunderstorm , a tail @-@ like branched tree called the " Tail Tree " , which stands on Princess Peach 's castle grounds , is stripped of all its leaves . The leaves , which turn out to be Super Leaves , were in reality taken by Bowser who is using them to bestow Tanooki Tails on his minions gifting them with new abilities . Unaware of this situation at first , when Mario and the Toads go to inspect the tree the next day they discover a letter from Bowser , learning that he has kidnapped the princess . Mario sets off in pursuit to locate and rescue the princess , learning in the process of Bowser 's intentions for using the aforementioned stolen Super Leaves . After rescuing her , the Toads and Mario return to the Mushroom Kingdom with Tanooki Suits while Mario carries the princess . Mario 's actions lead to the restoration of the Tail Tree . However , a photo falls to the ground revealing Luigi behind bars with a Koopa Troopa and <unk> , beginning Mario 's quest into the eight Special Worlds .

 = = Development = = 
 Super Mario 3D Land was developed by Nintendo EAD Tokyo , which had previously developed Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 , with assistance from Brownie Brown , another subsidiary of Nintendo . Super Mario Galaxy 2 game director Koichi Hayashida directed the game , and the game music was composed by Takeshi Hama , Mahito Yokota and Asuka <unk> ( formally known as Asuka Ohta ) . Super Mario 3D Land took two years to develop , starting from a development team of two people and ending with a team of 30 . The game was first announced by Shigeru Miyamoto in November 2010 , stating that both the 3D Mario game as well as a 2D Mario title were in the works for the Nintendo 3DS . Miyamoto described the 3D game as " completely original " and a cross between Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario 64 . 
 Super Mario 3D Land was designed to bridge the gap between 2D Mario games and 3D Mario games , and influenced by Miyamoto 's philosophy of keeping the games fun in nature and making sure the player had the utmost opportunity to enjoy the experience of the game . A main concern during development was making a game that would appeal to fans of the 2D Super Mario games as well as the 3D games ; levels were designed so that the player would not get lost , moving Mario in one general direction towards each level 's goal . 
 One of the inspirations behind the creation of the game was technological advances that made it possible to implement certain elements that could not be done in previous Mario games . Satoru Iwata explained that " since 1996 , when Mario appeared in 3D in Super Mario 64 , it 's always been hard for players to judge how to jump and hit a block floating in a 3D space , " musing that the Nintendo 3DS <unk> allowed for this issue to be fixed . The development team , which only had experience developing on consoles rather than handhelds , first tried playing Super Mario Galaxy 2 on a small television monitor . When it was found that Mario was too small to see and thus difficult to control , 3D Land 's camera system and level terrain needed to be designed for viewing on the small Nintendo 3DS screen , making it easier for players to keep track of Mario . Certain aspects of gameplay were inspired by Nintendo 's The Legend of Zelda franchise , including the way that the camera functioned during certain moments . Ideas that were ultimately not incorporated into 3D Land included a pro skater suit for Mario , the ability to change Mario 's size to the extreme , and a feature that replaces Princess Peach 's face with a photographed face . The game 's title was chosen as an homage to the Super Mario Land games released on the Game Boy . 
 Super Mario 3D Land development was heavily affected by the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami that occurred on March 11 , 2011 . The disaster caused public transportation to shut down , preventing Nintendo staff from being able to commute to work , and the Tokyo office remained closed for about a week . Hayashida was inspired by the disaster to encourage his team to communicate more , setting up the office such that staff members could easily see and discuss each other 's work . The team also started holding group meetings to play @-@ test 3D Land 's levels . Hayashida later mentioned that the team expressed hope that the game would inspire joy in spite of the tragedy . 
 Satoru Iwata revealed the game at the 2011 Game Developer 's Conference and pointed out that the game 's tentative logo sported a tail , stating that its purpose would be revealed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011 . Miyamoto later stated that " it 's what you think it is " , alluding to the Tanooki Suit , a power @-@ up originally from Super Mario Bros. 3 . While no exact release date was announced , Miyamoto stated that he hoped to release the game during 2011 . The game was showcased at Nintendo 's press conference at E3 2011 , where a 2011 release date was confirmed , along with the appearance of the Tanooki Suit . While the power @-@ up allows Mario to float down gently , unlike Super Mario Bros. 3 he cannot fly . 
 Super Mario 3D Land was first released in Japan on November 3 , 2011 . It was then released in North America on November 13 , Europe on November 18 , and in Australia on November 24 .

 Super Mario 3D Land has received critical acclaim . It received an aggregated score of 90 @.@ 09 % on GameRankings and 90 / 100 on Metacritic . The game sold over 343 @,@ 000 copies in its first week in Japan , helping to move over 145 @,@ 000 Nintendo 3DS units . Famitsu awarded Super Mario 3D Land a score of 38 / 40 , praising level design , accessibility for beginners and the use of 3D . IGN gave the game a score of 9 @.@ 5 and an Editor 's Choice award , calling it " brilliant and addictive " and stating that " 3D gaming has never been fully realized before this " . GamesRadar gave the game a score of 9 / 10 , praising its wealth of content , although criticising the inclusion of a run button and some easy difficulty . Game Informer gave 3D Land a 9 @.@ 5 / 10 , saying " it lives up to the level of quality set by previous entries and is easily the best reason to own a 3DS " . They also complimented the use of both a run button and the 3D effects while criticising the " lack of variety in boss battles " . 
 1UP.com 's Jeremy Parish gave the game a less favorable review , noting that certain aspects of the game were too easy in nature , musing a " moderately skilled player is never in danger of running out of lives in Super Mario 3D Land " . He however noted that the game was creative in its presentation , and offered " clever new twists on the familiar to the knuckle @-@ biting intensity of the final stages . " Justin Haywald of GamePro gave the game 5 / 5 , writing that Nintendo successfully captured the nostalgic aesthetic of the series , while still maintaining technical innovation . He reported , " for every familiar bit of music or a level background that reminds you of Mario games past , you have new abilities to use and deviously designed platforming sections that feel completely unique " , while stating that the inclusion of 3D was mostly a gimmick . 
 GameSpot stated that the game lacked some of the more creative aspects of the best of the series , stating that the 3D was mostly optional , though praised the gameplay as entertaining and fast @-@ paced . X @-@ Play 's Russ Frushtick felt that Super Mario 3D Land was the best game yet released for the 3DS , praising the content as surprisingly vast in nature and claiming that the game was twice as long as initially gauged .

 = History of the Swiss Air Force = 
 The history of the Swiss Air Force began in 1914 with the establishment of an ad hoc force consisting of a handful of men in outdated and largely civilian aircraft . It was only in the 1930s that an effective air force was established at great cost , capable of inflicting several embarrassing defeats on the Nazi Luftwaffe in the course of an initially vigorous defence of neutral Swiss airspace . The Swiss Air Force as an autonomous military service was created in October 1936 . After World War II it was renamed the Swiss Air Force and Anti @-@ Aircraft Command ( Schweizerische <unk> Kommando der Flieger und <unk> ) and in 1996 became a separate service independent from the Army , under its present name Schweizer Luftwaffe . 
 The mission of the Swiss Air Force historically has been to support ground troops ( <unk> ) in repelling invasions of neutral Swiss territory , with a secondary mission of defending the sovereignty of Swiss airspace . During World War II this doctrine was severely tested when Switzerland was literally caught in the middle of an air war and subjected to both attacks and intrusions by aircraft of all combatants . Its inability to prevent such violations of its neutrality led for a period to a complete cessation of air intercepts , followed by a practice of coercing small numbers of intruders to submit to internment . 
 At the end of the 1950s , reflecting both the threat of possible invasion by the Soviet Union and the realities of nuclear warfare , Swiss military doctrine changed to that of a dynamic ( mobile ) defense that included missions for the Swiss Air Force outside of its territory , in order to defeat standoff attacks and nuclear threats , including the possibility of defensive employment of air @-@ delivered nuclear weapons . However the inability to field an air force of sufficient capability to carry out such missions led to a return of traditional doctrine . 
 In 1995 the Swiss abandoned traditional doctrine and implemented a defensive plan that made control of Swiss airspace its highest and main priority . Modernization of the Swiss Air Force to achieve this mission was subject to popular referenda challenging its cost and practice . 
 = = Swiss balloon forces = = 
 Swiss military aviation began in 1900 with the creation of an observation balloon force . Swiss balloonists were first engaged in combat on 7 October 1918 , near the end of World War I , when a German airplane accidentally attacked a Swiss observation balloon stationed close to the German border and killed the observer , Lieutenant Werner <unk> . The balloon force was eventually disestablished in 1938 when developments in aviation made it obsolete . 
 = = Heavier @-@ than @-@ air aviation in World War I = = 
 Military trials with civilian airplanes were first conducted in 1911 , resulting in many crashes that failed to persuade Swiss authorities of the military utility of the airplane . From September 4 to 6 , 1911 , <unk> participated as pilot ( his friend Gustave <unk> as observer ) to an exercise with the 1st Swiss Army Corps and demonstrated the military possibilities of aircraft with his <unk> 5 ; the beginning of the military aviation in Switzerland . Only after the Swiss Officers ' Society collected approximately 1 @,@ 723 @,@ 000 Swiss francs in 1912 – a very large sum for the time – in a national fund drive to the create an air force , did the Swiss Federal Council order the establishment of a <unk> on 3 August 1914 . The government also decreed that only bachelors could become military pilots , to avoid the payment of expensive widow 's pensions in the event of casualties . 
 The outbreak of World War I , in which neutral Switzerland did not take part , and an indifference to air power of the part of the Swiss military establishment prevented the purchase of modern airplanes required to build an effective air force . By the end of 1914 , the force consisted of only eight men flying privately owned airplanes , and by July 1916 , four pilots had been killed in crashes . Swiss aircraft were armed only with carbines and flechettes , ineffective pointed iron spikes that were to be dropped on ground targets . The nominal commander of the Swiss air arm , cavalry captain Theodor Real , resigned his post in November 1916 when the army refrained from using its rudimentary air force to defend Swiss airspace against frequent German intrusions , even after Porrentruy was accidentally bombed by German aircraft on 11 October 1916 . 
 The first purpose @-@ built military aircraft in the Swiss air force was a Fokker <unk> seized after a German pilot made a forced landing in foul weather near <unk> on 13 October 1916 . In June 1917 , five Nieuport 23 C.1 fighter planes were acquired from France . Swiss industry manufactured more than 100 Häfeli DH @-@ 3 observation aircraft , but efforts to build a Swiss fighter ( the Häfeli DH @-@ 4 ) were halted in 1918 because of the prototypes ' poor performance . By the end of the war , the Swiss air force had only 62 pilots and 68 aircraft of nine different makes , almost all of which were suitable only for observation missions . Its wartime budget of CHF 15 million amounted to just 1 @.@ 25 % of Swiss military expenditures . 
 = = Interwar years = = 
 With continuing budgetary restraints , the air force remained in an overall state of neglect during the 1920s . 27 Twenty @-@ seven Fokker D.VII , 16 Hanriot <unk> , and 15 Nieuport 28 <unk> war surplus airplanes were acquired in 1920 ( as were 20 Zeppelin LZ <unk> reconnaissance biplanes obtained on the postwar black market ) but were soon obsolete , and further efforts to develop indigenous aircraft ( MA @-@ 6 , MA @-@ 7 , and MA @-@ 8 ) were unsuccessful . Seven pilots were killed in 1925 and 1926 before all Swiss military aircraft were equipped with parachutes . By 1929 , only 17 of its 213 airplanes were considered fit for service . The air force consisted of 18 aviation companies ( Flieger @-@ <unk> ) , three aerial photography platoons and one airfield company . In the decade following World War I , 162 pilots and 165 observers were trained , and the full complement of the air force was 196 officers , 499 NCOs and 2241 enlisted men . The only aircraft purchased in any quantity were the Potez XXV , and the Swiss @-@ built Häfeli DH @-@ 5 . 
 The difficulty of maintaining an air force with little funding during a time of rapid technological development was compounded by the Swiss militia system : all but a handful of military personnel were citizen soldiers who served only a few weeks each year following their initial recruitment phase . Military pilot candidates underwent the same recruit training , NCO school and officer candidate school as other Swiss army officers , followed by a pilot school of 173 days , then re @-@ entered civilian life . During his first two years of service , a pilot 's training continued with ten logged flight hours per month , and thereafter he was required to fly fifty hours per year at his convenience . 
 However , in 1930 the military and civilian leadership decided to establish an effective air force . On 13 December 1929 , in what was in retrospect referred to as the " bill to create an air force " , the Federal Council asked the Swiss Federal Assembly to approve the spending of 20 million francs for the purchase of 65 French Dewoitine <unk> fighters and the manufacture of 40 Dutch ( Fokker C.V @-@ E ) reconnaissance planes under licence . Although the opposition Social Democratic Party collected 42 @,@ 000 signatures in a petition opposing the bill , Parliament passed it handily and declined to allow a referendum on the issue , optional at that time for spending bills . 
 This was the start of a massive armament programme that would consume more than a billion francs over the next ten years , but after Hitler 's rise to power in Nazi Germany , the Social Democrats added their support to the efforts . They also supported Gottlieb <unk> 's 1938 popular initiative calling for the purchase of a thousand aircraft and the training of three thousand pilots . After 92 @,@ 000 citizens signed in support , nearly twice the number necessary for a national popular vote , the federal government offered a referendum proposal in 1939 that was nearly as extensive , which was accepted by a 69 percent majority . 
 In large part , the money was used to acquire modern aircraft , most notably , 90 state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art Messerschmitt Bf <unk> and E fighters from Germany in 1938 for 36 @.@ 6 million francs , the last of which were delivered in April 1940 , eight months after the outbreak of World War II . However , the need to expand the size of the pilot corps resulted in the acquisition of 146 trainers from Germany , the Bücker Bü 131 basic and Bücker Bü 133 advanced trainers . 
 In addition , Swiss factories licence @-@ built 82 Morane @-@ Saulnier D @-@ 3800 and 207 D @-@ <unk> fighters between 1939 and 1945 , and manufactured 152 domestically designed C @-@ 36 fighter @-@ bombers between 1942 and 1948 . Both of these types remained in service well into the 1950s as trainers . 
 On 19 October 1936 , the air arm was reorganised , and renamed the Schweizerische <unk> ( Department of Aviation and Anti @-@ Aircraft Defense ) , becoming an autonomous service under the Swiss Federal Military Department , analogous to the organizational autonomy of the United States Army Air Forces within the U.S. Army . The Bambini @-@ Code was developed from the need to communicate via radio links in bad quality in noisy environments , of the aircraft who were used from the Swiss Air Force before the start of the second world war .

 See also Messerschmitt Bf 109 : Combat Service with Switzerland 
 The Swiss Air Force mobilized on 28 August 1939 , three days before Germany attacked Poland and initiated World War II , with 96 fighter and 121 observation aircraft ; by some accounts the country possessed only eight antiaircraft searchlights . Of the 21 units of the Swiss Air Force , only three were judged combat @-@ ready and five were not yet equipped with aircraft . The Air Force relied on 40 single @-@ seat interceptors for first @-@ line air defense . 
 This deficiency was addressed by procuring further German Bf 109 , Italian Macchi <unk> , and French Morane D @-@ 3800 fighters . In 1942 , the Swiss @-@ built F + W C @-@ 36 multipurpose aircraft was introduced into service , and in 1943 , Switzerland opened its own aircraft factory , <unk> Emmen . Caverns were built in which to shelter aircraft and maintenance personnel from air attack , for example in <unk> , Meiringen and Turtmann . In 1942 @-@ 43 , an air gunnery range at <unk> @-@ <unk> was opened for training . The Surveillance Squadron ( <unk> ) was formed in 1941 and made combat @-@ ready in 1943 . A night fighter squadron was formed for evaluation purposes in 1944 and disbanded in 1950 . 
 The role of the Swiss Air Force during World War II went through four distinct phases : 
 September 1939 to May 1940 : Air patrol , in an attempt to enforce a comprehensive no @-@ fly ban issued by the Swiss government to the combatants , made largely ineffective by a 5 – kilometer buffer along the border which Swiss fighters were forbidden to enter . 
 May to June 1940 : Air combat between Switzerland and Germany in which the Luftwaffe pilots tested Swiss air defenses , and were defeated . 
 July 1940 to October 1943 : A total ban on air operations , and a release of interned German aircraft and pilots , resulting from the encirclement of Swiss territory by the Axis , the implementation of the <unk> strategy , and recognition that the Air Force would be overwhelmed by the Germans in a sustained campaign . 
 October 1943 to May 1945 : Resumption of air patrols , a largely passive response , measured by the numbers of intercepts versus the numbers of violations . 
 = = = Defense of Swiss airspace = = = 
 During the first months of the war , airmen and anti @-@ aircraft soldiers saw only sporadic combat ; it was on 10 May 1940 , when Germany commenced the drive into the west , that the Swiss army as a whole was mobilized a second time . At the onset of the campaign , German military aircraft first violated Swiss airspace . 
 The first serious combat involving the Swiss Air Force began in June 1940 . In six days of aerial battles , eleven German aircraft were downed , with a loss of two Swiss aircraft and three airmen killed . Following these incidents , on 6 June , the chief of the Luftwaffe , Hermann Göring , protested the attacks , claiming that most of the German planes had been in French airspace and that the Luftwaffe had entered Swiss airspace only by mistake . Germany demanded financial compensation and an apology by the Swiss government . In a second , more pointed demand on 19 June , Germany stated that they viewed the air battles as a flagrant act of aggression , and if these interceptions continued , Switzerland would face sanctions and retaliation . The next day , General Henri Guisan ordered all Swiss units to stop engaging foreign aircraft , and on 1 July 1940 , the Federal Council apologized for possible border violations by Swiss pilots , without admitting any had occurred . On 16 July , the German government declared that the events were settled . Engaging aircraft of the combatant nations was prohibited until October 1943 , when strategic bombing of Bavaria and Austria by the Allies became an increasing likelihood . 
 In September 1944 , the last Swiss airman died in combat , shot down by an American P @-@ 51 Mustang while escorting a crippled U.S. B @-@ 17 Flying Fortress to the Dübendorf airfield . During the entire war , 6 @,@ 501 Allied and Axis aircraft violated Swiss airspace , 198 of which aircraft landed on Swiss soil and were interned , and 56 of which crashed . 
 Swiss aircraft also intercepted U.S. aircraft who were off @-@ course , or whose crews preferred asylum in Swiss internment camps over German or Italian POW camps ; they were then forced to land on Swiss airstrips . When the bombers did not cooperate or even fired at the Swiss ( who were using Axis @-@ type interceptors ) , they were shot down . 
 = = = Night fighter incident = = = 
 In 1944 a Luftwaffe Bf 110G @-@ 4 night fighter pursued a British Lancaster heavy bomber into Swiss airspace on the night of April 28 – 29 . Engine trouble forced the German pilot , Wilhelm <unk> , to land at Dübendorf airfield where the pilot was interned . By international law , the Swiss had a right to put the fighter into service , and the Germans were concerned that Allied intelligence would examine its FuG 220 Lichtenstein radar and " Schräge Musik " gun installation . 
 The Nazi government quickly negotiated a deal in which the Swiss burned the Bf 110 under the supervision of German observers in return for a sale to the Swiss of 12 new Bf 109G @-@ 6 Gustav to replace combat losses . The new fighters were delivered in batches of six on 20 and 22 May . The new planes had serious manufacturing defects from the poor workmanship and production disruptions caused by Allied bombings , and after complaints the Germans refunded half of the six million Swiss franc purchase price . 
 = = = Attacks on Swiss cities = = = 
 Swiss cities and railway lines were repeatedly bombed by Allied aircraft during the war , beginning with minor attacks by the Royal Air Force on Geneva , Basel , and Zürich in 1940 . Possibly the most egregious occurred 1 April 1944 when 50 B @-@ 24 Liberators of the U.S. 14th Combat Bomb Wing bombed Schaffhausen , killing and injuring more than 100 , and damaging a large portion of the city . In reaction to comments by Swiss Foreign Minister Marcel <unk> @-@ <unk> that the incident " apparently was a deliberate attack " , American apologies were undermined by ill @-@ advised statements made by Air Force commanders in London which blamed weather and minimized the size and accuracy of the attack . Although an in @-@ depth investigation showed that weather in France , particularly winds that nearly doubled the ground speed of the U.S. bombers , did in fact cause the wing to mistake Schaffhausen for its target at Ludwigshafen am Rhein , the Swiss were not mollified . Incidents escalated , resulting in 13 separate attacks on Swiss territory on 22 February 1945 — the day President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's special assistant , Lauchlin Currie , went to Schaffhausen to lay a wreath on the graves of those killed a year earlier — and simultaneous attacks 4 March that dropped 29 tons of high explosives and 17 tons of incendiaries on Basel and Zürich . 
 Swiss air defenses were incapable of counteracting large formations of aircraft , but did intercept and , on occasion attack , small groups . Since these were often aircraft crippled by battle damage and seeking asylum , resentment among Allied aircrew was considerable . The causes of the misdirected bombing attacks were bad weather , faulty equipment , incompetence , or excess pilot zeal , rather than malice or purposeful planning , but the lack of intent did not allay the sufferings and suspicions of the Swiss , and the embarrassment to the United States was considerable . A pattern of violation , diplomatic apology , reparation , and new violation ensued through much of the war , and grew in scope as Allied tactical forces neared Germany . It is still a matter of debate if these bombings occurred by accident , since U.S. strategic air forces had a standing order requiring visual identification before bombing any target within 50 miles ( 80 km ) of the Swiss frontier , or if some members of the Allies wanted to punish Switzerland for their economic and industrial cooperation with Nazi Germany . In particular , Switzerland permitted train transportation through its territory carrying matériel between Germany and Italy , which was readily visible from the air by Allied pilots . 
 The incidents drew to a close only after a USAAF delegation appointed by U.S. Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall met with the Swiss in Geneva on 9 March 1945 . The Swiss enumerated every violation since Schaffhausen and demanded full indemnity . The Americans advised that the area requiring positive target identification was henceforth expanded to 150 miles ( 240 km ) from Swiss borders , that no targets within 50 miles ( 80 km ) would be attacked even in clear weather except by personal authorization from American commander General Carl Spaatz , and then only by hand @-@ picked crews , and that tactical air was forbidden to attack any target within ten miles ( 16 km ) of the Swiss border . Even though these restrictions provided the Germans significant protection from air attack over a large part of southern Germany for the final two months of the war , they were effective in ending the violations and did not seriously hamper Allied prosecution of the war .

 During World War II , Switzerland struggled with buying and building modern combat aircraft . The fourteen Bf 109G <unk> acquired from the Germans ( including two interned ) proved increasingly difficult to maintain , and were removed from service in 1947 , although the " Emil " variants purchased earlier continued on until 1949 . The Swiss also acquired nearly 200 aircraft interned after violating its sovereignty , but most were unsuitable for Swiss operations . 
 However , in 1948 the Swiss were able to purchase 130 surplus P @-@ 51 Mustangs from the United States . Several other aircraft types followed , including the 220 de Havilland Vampires purchased in 1949 and 1953 , 250 de Havilland Venoms acquired 1954 @-@ 56 , and 100 Hawker Hunters from 1958 . The P @-@ 51s replaced the Messerschmitt Bf 109s and remained operational for a decade . Both the Venoms and Vampires showed remarkable longevity , with the Venoms in service until 1983 and the Vampires until 1990 , more than 40 years . Remarkably the Swiss Air Force after these acquisitions was the first air force in the world to operate only jet aircraft in their front @-@ line squadrons . 
 = = = N @-@ 20 and P @-@ 16 = = = 
 The Swiss government experimented in development and production of its own jet fighters , the FFA P @-@ 16 and the N @-@ 20 Aiguillon , but was not satisfied with them , desiring relatively simple aircraft that did not require extensive training and thus could be flown by militia pilots . These aircraft were developed in accordance with the doctrine of the Swiss Air Force that close air support of ground operations was its main task . The National Defense Commission ( <unk> ) , however , based on the experiences of World War II , also desired an aircraft capable of both " neutrality protection and raid @-@ type operations " , and the result was projects with inherent self @-@ contradictions . 
 Hoping that competition would lead to the development of effective but simple ground @-@ attack aircraft , the government asked the <unk> Altenrhein ( FFA , or " Aircraft Factory Altenrhein " ) and the Federal Aircraft Factory Emmen to develop jet @-@ propelled fighters . Although the Federal Institute of Technology had a world @-@ renowned aerodynamics laboratory , both projects ended in fiasco , as a result of which the Hunter was purchased instead and introduced into service in 1958 . 
 Both models were plagued from the onset by inefficient engines , but were capable of the short @-@ distance takeoffs required by the Swiss ( 330 meters for the P – 16 , 232 meters for the N @-@ 20 ) . After wind tunnel and engine tests , but before the N – 20 could make its maiden flight , Federal Councillor Karl Kobelt cancelled the N @-@ 20 project in 1953 , leading to much resentment of the government by Emmen engineers when the FFA project was continued . Eventually , neither of the aircraft came into production , although the wings of the P @-@ 16 were later used in the development of the successful Learjet . 
 The Eidgenössische Flugzeugwerke Emmen N @-@ 20 was a semi @-@ tailless swept wing jet similar to the U.S. Navy 's Vought <unk> Cutlass with four engines mounted internally in the wings , fold @-@ out canards to improve its aerodynamics at slow speeds , and a maximum designed airspeed of 1200 km / h , a remarkable velocity for an aircraft of the early 1950s . The FFA P @-@ 16 was a single @-@ engine straight @-@ wing aircraft for which a contract for production of 100 aircraft was awarded in 1958 , but after the second crash of a pre @-@ production model , the order was canceled . The aircraft had met all Swiss Air Force requirements for an STOL attack fighter capable of carrying heavy loads , and the crash was widely considered a pretext for the Swiss parliament to reverse itself . In addition , by the middle of 1958 , influenced by NATO concepts , the <unk> had redefined the Swiss doctrine of air power from close air support to counter @-@ air operations . Further , the strategic concepts governing Swiss defense doctrine had shifted to a dynamic ( mobile ) defense that included execution of air missions beyond the Swiss border and the possibility of carrying nuclear weapons , for neither of which the P – 16 was suitable . In this time , the Swiss Air Force also tested a few from the Swiss industry @-@ developed Ground to Air Defence Systems but didn 't introduce any of them into service ( see : 35 mm anti aircraft tank <unk> , RSD 58 and <unk> Kriens ( Missile ) ) . Also a Mobile Ground to Air Defence System based on the Swiss wheeled APC <unk> Shark equipped with the French <unk> ( missile ) was not bought for the Swiss Air Force . 
 = = = Mirage affair = = = 
 The acquisition of the Hunter had solved part of the Swiss dilemma of needing to support both its ground forces and to deploy an air @-@ to @-@ air capability , but while the Hunter could provide some counter @-@ air defense over a battlefield and escort ground @-@ support fighters it was not supersonic nor was it capable of defending Swiss airspace . In 1961 , the Swiss Parliament voted to procure 100 French Dassault Mirage <unk> for this purpose and 67 BL @-@ 64 Bloodhound surface @-@ to @-@ air missiles from the British . 
 The Swiss acquired a single Mirage for testing , as a preface to production under license of 100 Dassault Mirage IIIS interceptors , with strengthened wings , airframe , and undercarriage . Avionics would differ as well , with the Thomson @-@ CSF Cyrano II radar replaced by the Hughes Electronics <unk> @-@ 18 system , to provide the Mirage IIIS compatibility with the AIM @-@ 4 Falcon air @-@ to @-@ air missile . The Mirage IIIS was intended to be operated as an interceptor , ground attack , and reconnaissance aircraft , using wing pods for the photographic mission . 
 Production of the Mirage IIIS developed into a scandal . Although the Air Force staff wanted to acquire the best available aircraft on the market , neither it nor the Federal Council had issued performance specifications . The concept of mobile defense had replaced static defense , such as the <unk> strategy of World War II , as the doctrine of the Swiss Armed Forces . The new doctrine required greater numbers of long @-@ range aircraft and tanks in order to combat Soviet troops before they arrived near the Swiss border . The committee on aircraft procurement , which consisted of two military officers and an engineer who was employed by the army , originally proposed " at least 100 Mirages " to be employed in a multi @-@ role capacity . 
 The parliament first authorized approximately 871 million Swiss francs to build 100 Mirage IIIS under license . But this procurement was soon crushed under massive budget overruns and the government asked for an additional CHF 576 million . The cost overruns were the result of fitting U.S. electronics to the French platform , installing hardpoints for moving the aircraft inside of the caverns by cranes , structural reinforcements for jet @-@ assisted takeoffs , and other extras to improve the off @-@ the @-@ shelf Mirage IIIC . The wish to procure the Mirage IIIS was also boosted by the possibility that the Swiss could acquire aircraft @-@ delivered nuclear weapons , either from France or by producing them themselves . 
 However , another major reason for rising costs was the need to develop a separate variant for the photo @-@ reconnaissance mission when the underwing pods caused too great a performance penalty . The differences between the IIIS and the IIIRS ( as the reconnaissance version was designated ) resulted in only 36 Mirage IIIS fighters and 18 IIIRS reconnaissance aircraft actually built by the Federal Aircraft Factory at Emmen . Twelve were allocated to a reconnaissance squadron , three to a training group and the rest to two fighter squadrons . It was found that such a small number was insufficient to provide the multi @-@ role capacity deemed essential for the new doctrine . The Mirage IIIS went into service in 1967 , and the IIIRS in 1969 . 
 The lack of financial oversight and the apparent ease with which Federal Councillor Paul <unk> and Chief of the General Staff Jakob <unk> chose the Mirage ( at the time , the world 's fastest jet fighter ) led , for the first time in Swiss history , to the formation of a parliamentary fact @-@ finding commission . As a result , parliamentary oversight on military procurements was improved and the military was given the organizational and professional structures to avoid such budget overruns . One Air Force officer had to retire , and <unk> himself retired voluntarily in the end of 1964 , followed by <unk> who stepped down in 1966 . 
 = = Later Cold War history = = 
 In 1972 , with the option of nuclear weapons discarded and the likelihood of operations beyond the Swiss border severely restricted , the Federal Military Department ( EMD ) decided that the next generation of aircraft acquired by the Swiss Air Force would be for close air support . While resurrection of the P @-@ 16 was discussed in the Swiss press ( FFA had continued theoretical development the aircraft at its own expense , with its final variant , the AR @-@ 7 , to be equipped with a Rolls @-@ Royce <unk> @-@ 25 engine ) , the choice narrowed to the Milan ( a joint Swiss @-@ French prototype variant of the Mirage III ) and the American A @-@ 7G Corsair II , each of which had strong advocates within the Swiss Air Force . 
 Still reeling from the " Mirage affair " , when the Milan project failed from lack of orders and the recommendation for purchase of the A @-@ 7 was cancelled , the Air Force instead purchased 30 additional , surplus Hawker Hunters in 1973 to improve its ground attack capability ( the small number of Mirages were reserved for reconnaissance and interceptor roles ) . At this time the Swiss aviation industry and the ETH Zurich made a last attempt for a Swiss made fighter jet , the ALR Piranha but they had no success . And it remained an unfinished project . 
 The end of the 1970s saw the introduction of the Northrop F @-@ 5 Tiger <unk> F @-@ 5 won the competition against the F @-@ 4 Phantom II , Dassault Mirage F1 and Saab 37 Viggen , after the Hawker Siddeley Harrier , the Fiat <unk> and the A @-@ 4N Skyhawk passed out the contest before the flight evaluation . In 1976 the Federal Council ordered 72 aircraft , all of which were delivered by 1979 . A follow @-@ up order for 38 in 1981 brought the totals to 98 single @-@ seat F @-@ 5E and 12 two @-@ seat F @-@ 5F , which were deployed in five squadrons headquartered at Dübendorf . Initially the Tigers were responsible for air sovereignty below 30 @,@ 000 feet ( 9 @,@ 100 m ) , but some also took on a ground attack mission as the Hawker Hunters were phased out . 
 In 1985 the Mirage IIIS fleet , nearing 20 years of operational service , began a major upgrade program to improve the capabilities of the aircraft . The interceptors were retro @-@ fitted with canards manufactured by Israeli Aircraft Industries on the air intakes to improve maneuverability and stability at landing speeds , new avionics and countermeasures , and redesignated the Mirage IIIS <unk> 
 Meanwhile , the lengthy nature of the Swiss aircraft procurement process , reinforced by the embarrassments of the Mirage Affair , resulted in the simultaneous acquisition of a new fighter to eventually replace the Mirage . The Swiss considered the Dassault Rafale , Dassault Mirage 2000 , the IAI Lavi , the Northrop F @-@ 20 Tigershark , and the BAE Systems / Saab JAS @-@ 39 Gripen fighters before choosing the McDonnell Douglas F / A @-@ 18 Hornet and General Dynamics F @-@ 16 Fighting Falcon for a fly @-@ off evaluation held in May 1988 . From that competition , the Federal Council chose the Hornet in October 1988 . The Hornets were to be virtually " off @-@ the @-@ shelf " models , nearly identical to those operated by the U.S. Navy but with stronger titanium alloy frames for an anticipated 30 @-@ year service life . 
 However the competition was reopened in 1990 to allow for a reconsideration of a European fighter , the Mirage 2000 @-@ 5 . In June 1991 the choice of the Hornet was reconfirmed , and the political struggle to have its purchase approved by referendum began . In the meantime , the Soviet Union was dissolved , and with its dissolution the Cold War ended . 
 = = = Overseas training = = = 
 A small contingent of Hawker Hunters deployed to Sweden in 1965 for training in air @-@ to @-@ ground delivery of ordnance , and intermittently thereafter , but annual training abroad for the Swiss Air Force did not begin until 1985 . The use of Swiss air space for combat training became increasingly impractical as the performance of supersonic jets increased and created environmental restrictions . The Swiss modified their traditional stance of neutrality to seek other facilities , particularly among NATO European members , to meet their training needs . 
 The first annual training exercise was <unk> SAKA ( <unk> <unk> ) , first begun 3 January 1985 . It was conducted at the Air Weapons Training Installation ( <unk> ) at <unk> Air Base on Sardinia , at the time the only such facility outside of the United States . Up to 18 Swiss Mirages and Tigers per year conducted air combat maneuvering training on its instrumentation range . Following its fifth SAKA exercise in 1989 , however , demands by NATO air forces for the facility resulted in permission for Swiss Air Force usage to be withdrawn . 
 When its SAKA exercise set for June 1990 had to be cancelled , the Swiss Air Force began a new training program at RAF Waddington in the United Kingdom , which it called NORKA ( <unk> <unk> ) . A newly built Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation ( ACMI ) range operated by British Aerospace provided it with a facility with which to conduct realistic combat training against other aircraft , and it began the first of twelve annual exercises on 16 November 1990 .

 = = = Changes in doctrine = = = 
 With the end of the Cold War , the probability of a ground invasion of Switzerland ended , substantially changing Swiss military doctrine and resulting in reduction of both the budget and the size of the Swiss Armed Forces . In Armed Forces Reform 95 , and its supporting program Defense Guidelines 95 , the Air Force retained its basic structure and organization , but became a totally independent service , now called the Swiss Air Force , on 1 January 1996 . For the first time since its inception , subordination of the counter @-@ air role to the ground support mission ended , and defense of domestic airspace was made its highest priority and primary task . 
 In addition , the Air Force was tasked with gathering intelligence , air reconnaissance , and air transport . Support of ground troops , both doctrinally and as a practical matter , became marginal . These missions were strongly influenced by a shrinking capability , since its combat aircraft could operate by daylight only , its anti @-@ aircraft artillery was obsolete , and the <unk> radar system had reached the limits of operational effectiveness . The retirement of the Hawker Hunters in 1994 ended its ground support capability , and a cut of one @-@ third from the defence budget meant that plans for a second purchase of F / A @-@ 18s and supporting air @-@ to @-@ ground weapons ( the reason the multi @-@ capable Hornet was selected ) had to be canceled , leaving both it and the F @-@ 5s in a strictly air @-@ to @-@ air role . 
 Almost immediately the Air Force was reduced from 290 to 190 fixed @-@ wing aircraft and had five of its twelve bases closed . In 2002 , the Armée XXI reforms continued the pattern of reduction , with bases at Mollis , Turtmann , and Interlaken closed , jets relocated out of Dübendorf ( later planned for closing ) , and the helicopter base at <unk> placed on the closure list . These closures left <unk> , Sion , and Meiringen as the only combat bases , Emmen as the main helicopter base , and Locarno as a training base . <unk> was maintained for war @-@ time reactivation , and the theoretical plan for using highways near <unk> , Sion , and <unk> as emergency runways was retained , although no pilots have been trained in their use since the mid @-@ 1980s . 
 = = = New jets and political struggles = = = 
 In 1993 , a popular initiative that sought to stop the procurement of the 34 F / A @-@ 18 Hornets ( chosen by the Federal Council in 1988 ) to replace the Mirages was defeated by a majority of 57 % . Two versions , a twin @-@ seat D @-@ model and a single @-@ seat C , were built in the United States and flight @-@ tested in 1996 , delivered in December 1996 and 1998 respectively . Thirty @-@ two production kits were shipped to Switzerland for assembly , with the first in service in January 1997 and the final aircraft delivered in December 1999 . One crashed during <unk> , leaving 28 C 's and 5 Ds assigned to three squadrons . Seven instructor pilots were trained at NAS Cecil Field , Florida , and the United States Navy also provided two instructors on exchange to train Hornet pilots . 
 In 1990 , the Swiss Air Force acquired 20 British Aerospace Hawk <unk> to provide an interim solution to its jet training requirements , but these were retired in 2003 and sold to Finland . The Mirages ended their service in the second half of the 1990s , with the last Mirage fighter retired in 1999 and the final Mirage reconnaissance jet in December 2003 . 
 When the Hunters were retired in 1994 , the air force made an effort to provide some F @-@ 5 Tigers with an air @-@ to @-@ ground capability but this proved prohibitively expensive , and plans to replace the fleet after 2010 with a fourth @-@ generation jet fighter were begun . A dozen F @-@ 5s were leased in 2004 to Austria for four years ( while it awaited the delivery of new <unk> ) , and the Swiss maintenance of its fleet was such that they were considered " low @-@ hours " by the U.S. Navy , which purchased 36 in 2006 – 2008 to replace its aging Aggressor aircraft . This effectively reduced the F @-@ 5 inventory by half , and proposals to replace the Tigers with JAS @-@ 39 Gripens , Rafales , EADS Eurofighter Typhoons , or the advanced Super Hornet variant of the FA @-@ 18 came under consideration . In the end the JAS @-@ 39 Gripen was chosen because it was the cheapest candidate . In the evaluation the JAS @-@ 39 C & JAS @-@ 30D were tested but the choice in the end was to buy 22 JAS @-@ 39E . Because SAAB don 't build the 2 <unk> Gripen F of the Gripen E Switzerland will first rent a few <unk> C and 2 @-@ seater Gripen D. Due to financing struggles in the MoD and the possibility of a popular initiative it is uncertain whether the JAS @-@ 39E can be really acquired . 
 Overseas training continued with the annual NORKA exercises through 2001 , when NORKA was discontinued in favor of NOMAD ( North Sea Operations for Mutual Air Defence ) , a multi @-@ nation ACMI training exercise held annually at RAF Waddington , which Swiss contingents began attending in 2000 . Training in night operations , called <unk> , began in 1998 at Ørland MAS , Norway , and continued annually except for 1999 and 2005 . Training abroad with NATO nations reflected the changing realities of neutrality , also reflected in 1997 by the official discontinuation within the Swiss Air Force of the " Bambini Code " in favor of the NATO Brevity Code . The Bambini Code , invented in 1941 , was an amalgam of terms in French , German , and Italian for accurate voice communications during high @-@ stress flight operations while the NATO terms are entirely in English and largely developed by the United States Air Force . 
 Since 1993 the Swiss Air Force has faced continuing challenges from left @-@ wing and environmental lobbies regarding its existence , policy , and operations . On 24 February 2008 , an initiative to ban the training flights of jet aircraft over " tourist areas " of Switzerland ( virtually the entire nation ) to reduce the impact of " noise pollution " , which had been publicly debated since the delivery of the F / A @-@ 18 ( which referendum initiator Franz Weber termed " oversized , ineffective , and ruinous " ) , was defeated by a vote of 68 @.@ 1 % .

 = James Innes ( North Carolina ) = 
 James Innes ( <unk> – September 5 , 1759 ) was a military commander and political figure in the Province of North Carolina who led troops both at home and abroad in the service of the Kingdom of Great Britain . Innes was given command of a company of North Carolina 's provincial soldiers during the War of Jenkins ' Ear , and served as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of all colonial soldiers in the Ohio River Valley in 1754 during the French and Indian War . After resigning his commission in 1756 , Innes retired to his home on the Cape Fear River . A bequest made by Innes upon his death lead to the establishment of Innes Academy in Wilmington , North Carolina .

 Innes was born around 1700 in the Scottish Highlands . In 1732 , Innes purchased 320 acres ( 130 ha ; 0 @.@ 50 sq mi ) on the Cape Fear River in what is now Bladen County , North Carolina . In or about 1733 , he received an additional grant of 640 acres ( 260 ha ; 1 @.@ 00 sq mi ) . Shortly after Innes ' arrival in North Carolina , Governor Gabriel Johnston appointed him as a justice for New Hanover County , and tried unsuccessfully to appoint Innes to his council .

 In 1739 , war broke out between Spain and Great Britain over the respective powers ' colonial possessions and spheres of influence . At the outset of that conflict , the British requested that their colonies supply troops for an expedition to South America . Innes was selected by Governor Johnston to lead a company of 100 men from the Cape Fear region to Cartagena in the Spanish Viceroyalty of New Granada , a city which is located in the modern @-@ day country of Colombia . The Cape Fear company was to be joined by three other companies raised in the Albemarle Sound region . Innes was granted a provincial commission as Captain in the British Army on June 7 , 1740 . 
 Upon arriving in South America , Innes and his men , as well as North Carolina 's three Albemarle companies , were placed under the direct command of Colonel William Gooch , a baronet and the Governor of Virginia . The <unk> and disease @-@ ridden campaign , which culminated in the Battle of Cartagena de Indias in the Spring of 1741 , was disastrous for the British . At Cartagena , delays by the British fleet in landing troops to assault a key Spanish fortification , combined with the fact that the ladders used by British scaling parties were shorter than the walls they were intended for , caused the militia and regular soldiers to suffer a 50 percent casualty rate prior to the assault being called off . The Cartagena campaign left only 25 survivors under Innes ' command . The North Carolina contingent returned home in January of 1743 . 
 Innes was placed in command of the New Hanover militia after his return . In 1748 , after the war between the British and Spanish had expanded into a wider war against the French known in the colonies as King George 's War , a Spanish fleet attacked Brunswick Town , North Carolina , and Innes assisted the local militia under Captain William Dry in repulsing the raiding force .

 Between the War of Jenkins ' Ear and the French and Indian War , Innes served as a commissioner for John Carteret , 2nd Earl Granville , charged with the sale of that proprietor 's lands in the Granville District . Active in the colonial government , Innes was a baron of the Court of Exchequer in Wilmington . There he was associated with Francis Corbin and the Salisbury Land Office ( as a land grant agent ) . After 1750 , Innes served on the Governor 's Council under both Gabriel Johnston and Arthur Dobbs until his death in 1759 . 
 = = = French and Indian War = = = 
 After the conclusion of King George 's War in 1748 , tension increased on the frontier between the French @-@ held North American territory and the British colonies on the coast . With the possibility of the outbreak of war in 1754 , Innes , as an experienced soldier , was nominated as the commander of North Carolina militia , which was to be sent to aid Virginia at the request of Governor Robert Dinwiddie . The government of Virginia in particular feared French incursions , as it claimed much of the territory in the Ohio River Valley . Dinwiddie , a fellow Scot , had become friends with Innes , and considered naming him as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the provincial forces , but instead chose to name Virginian Joshua Fry . Fry 's death on May 15 , 1754 left the position vacant , and Innes was appointed on June 4 , 1754 , although George Washington had been Fry 's second @-@ in @-@ command . 
 Washington was given command of the Virginia Regiment upon Fry 's death , and he led that unit into the Ohio River Valley on Dinwiddie 's orders before Innes was appointed his superior . On May 28 , 1754 , Washington 's unit , along with native Mingo allies , surprised a French unit , killing Joseph Coulon de Jumonville , the unit 's commander . A large force of French soldiers then advanced to trap Washington , and on July 3 , 1754 , assaulted him at Fort Necessity near what is now Farmington , Pennsylvania , and forced the Virginian 's surrender . Dinwiddie blamed Matthew Rowan , the acting Governor of North Carolina , for the defeat , stating that had Innes ' men been assembled in a timely fashion , they could have accompanied Washington to the frontier . Nevertheless , this engagement signaled the beginning of colonial combat between the French and English , which by 1755 had erupted into open war . 
 Innes ' tenure as commander @-@ in @-@ chief had scarcely begun at the onset of the French and Indian War . Innes was directed to go to Wills Creek in Maryland , and to reinforce a fort there , which was to become Fort Cumberland . The North Carolina soldiers that came to Virginia were unruly and difficult to manage , eventually deserting after being informed that their pay was to be reduced , or returning home after Innes himself disbanded the unit due to its instability . To make matters worse , Virginians under Innes ' command were ill @-@ disposed towards him , particularly because he was not a Virginian himself . 
 Within five months of Innes ' appointment , Horatio Sharpe relieved him of his command , and Innes stayed on at Fort Cumberland as its " <unk> general " . When General Edward Braddock arrived with a force of British regulars in 1755 , Innes was named Governor of Fort Cumberland . Braddock tasked Innes with commanding a reserve force of troops at the fort during the disastrous Braddock expedition , in which Braddock led an army into the Ohio valley where it was ambushed and routed , leaving the general mortally wounded . During that operation , Fort Cumberland was used as a holding area for wounded and sick soldiers . Innes was among the first to hear of Braddock 's defeat , and one of the first to inform Dinwiddie , by way of Lord Fairfax , of the catastrophe . By the mid @-@ 1756 , Innes was permitted to resign his commission and return to North Carolina .

 Innes lived out the remainder of his life as a planter at " Point Pleasant " , his plantation in North Carolina .

 = Eurasian crag martin = 
 The Eurasian crag martin or just crag martin ( Ptyonoprogne rupestris ) is a small passerine bird in the swallow family . It is about 14 cm ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) long with ash @-@ brown upperparts and paler underparts , and a short , square tail that has distinctive white patches on most of its feathers . It breeds in the mountains of southern Europe , northwestern Africa and southern Asia . It can be confused with the three other species in its genus , but is larger than both , with brighter tail spots and different plumage tone . Many European birds are resident , but some northern populations and most Asian breeders are migratory , wintering in northern Africa , the Middle East or India . 
 The Eurasian crag martin builds a nest adherent to the rock under a cliff overhang or increasingly onto a man @-@ made structure . It makes a neat half @-@ cup mud nest with an inner soft lining of feathers and dry grass . Nests are often solitary , although a few pairs may breed relatively close together at good locations . Two to five brown @-@ blotched white eggs are incubated mainly by the female , and both parents feed the chicks . This species does not form large breeding colonies , but is gregarious outside the breeding season . It feeds on a wide variety of insects that are caught in its beak as the martin flies near to cliff faces or over streams and alpine meadows . Adults and young may be hunted and eaten by birds of prey or corvids , and this species is a host of blood @-@ sucking mites . With its very large and expanding range and large population there are no significant conservation concerns . 
 This bird is closely related to the other three crag martins which share its genus , and has sometimes been considered to be the same species as one or both , although it appears that there are areas where two species ' ranges overlap without hybridisation occurring . All three Ptyonoprogne crag martins are quite similar in behaviour to other Old World swallows that build mud nests , and are sometimes subsumed into the larger genus Hirundo , but this approach leads to inconsistencies in classifying other genera , particularly the house martins . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Eurasian crag martin was formally described as Hirundo rupestris by Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1769 and was moved to the new genus Ptyonoprogne by German ornithologist Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach in 1850 . Its nearest relatives are the three other members of the genus , the pale crag martin , P. obsoleta , the rock martin , P. fuligula , and the dusky crag martin , P. concolor . The genus name is derived from the Greek ptuon ( φτυον ) , " a fan " , referring to the shape of the opened tail , and Procne ( Πρόκνη ) , a mythological girl who was turned into a swallow . The specific rupestris means " of rocks " , from the Latin rupes " rock " . There are no generally recognised subspecies . Two races , Central Asian P. r. <unk> and P. r. <unk> in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco , have been proposed , but the slight differences in size and colour show no consistent geographical pattern . Fossils of this species have been found in Late Pleistocene deposits in Bulgaria , and in central France in layers dated at 242 @,@ 000 to 301 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 The four Ptyonoprogne species are members of the swallow family of birds , and are placed in the Hirundininae subfamily , which comprises all swallows and martins except the very distinctive river martins . DNA studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae , broadly correlating with the type of nest built . The groups are the " core martins " including burrowing species like the sand martin , the " nest @-@ adopters " , which are birds like the tree swallow that utilise natural cavities , and the " mud nest builders " . The Ptyonoprogne species construct an open mud nest and therefore belong to the last group ; Hirundo species also build open nests , Delichon house martins have a closed nest , and the Cecropis and Petrochelidon swallows have retort @-@ like closed nests with an entrance tunnel . 
 Ptyonoprogne is closely related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo into which it is often subsumed , but a DNA analysis showed that an enlarged Hirundo genus should logically contain all the mud @-@ builder genera , including the Delichon house martins , a practice which few authorities follow . Although the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag martins resembles those of typical Hirundo species like the barn swallow , the research showed that if Delichon , Cecropis and Petrochelidon are split from Hirundo , Ptyonoprogne should also be treated as a separate genus .

The tail is short and square , with white patches near the tips of all but the central and outermost pairs of feathers . The underwing and undertail coverts are blackish , the eyes are brown , the small bill is mainly black , and the legs are brownish @-@ pink . The sexes are alike , but juveniles have buff @-@ brown tips to the plumage of the head , upperparts and wing coverts . This species can be distinguished from the sand martin by its larger size , the white patches on the tail , and its lack of a brown breast band . Where the range overlaps with that of another Ptyonoprogne species , the Eurasian crag martin is darker , browner and 15 % larger than the rock martin , and larger and paler , particularly on its underparts than the dusky crag martin . The white tail spots of the Eurasian crag martin are significantly larger than those of both its relatives . 
 The crag martin 's flight appears relatively slow for a swallow . Rapid wing beats are interspersed with flat @-@ winged glides , and its long flexible primaries give it the agility to manoeuvre near cliff faces . The average migration flight speed has been measured at 9 @.@ 9 m / s ( 32 @.@ 5 ft / s ) , less than the roughly 11 m / s ( 36 ft / s ) typical for hirundines , but the data is limited . The bird often flies high , and shows the white spots as it spreads its tail . The vocalisations include short high <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> calls resembling those of the linnet and the house martin respectively . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Eurasian crag martin breeds in mountains from Iberia and northwesternmost Africa through southern Europe , the Persian Gulf and the Himalayas to southwestern and northeastern China . Northern populations are migratory , with European birds wintering in north Africa , Senegal , Ethiopia and the Nile Valley , and Asian breeders going to southern China , the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East . Some European birds stay north of the Mediterranean , and , like martins in warmer areas such as India , Turkey and Cyprus , just move to lower ground after breeding . The breeding range is bounded by the 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) July isotherm , and wintering areas need a temperature of about 15 ° C ( 59 ° F ) for enough insect food to be available . This is a rare species any distance north of its breeding areas . For example , there are only eight records from the UK , none from Ireland , and the first record for Sweden was reported as recently as 1996 . South of its normal wintering range , it has occurred as a vagrant in The Gambia . 
 Crag martins breed on dry , warm and sheltered cliffs in mountainous areas with crags and gorges . The typical altitude is 2 @,@ 000 – 2 @,@ 700 m ( 6 @,@ 600 – 8 @,@ 900 ft ) but breeding occurs up to 5 @,@ 000 m ( 16 @,@ 000 ft ) in Central Asia . The Eurasian crag martin 's choice of nest sites is very similar to that of Savi 's pipistrelle , Hypsugo <unk> ; the bird and the bat often breed in the same locations and have almost identical ranges in Europe . In South Asia , migrant Eurasian birds sometimes join with flocks of the dusky crag martin and roost communally on ledges of cliffs or buildings . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Crag martin pairs nest alone or in small colonies , usually containing fewer than ten nests . Nests are on average 30 m ( 98 ft ) apart and each pair aggressively defends its breeding territory against other crag martin and most other bird species . Nesting takes place from May to August , and usually two broods are raised . The nest , built by both adults , is an open half cup made of mud and lined with soft material such as feathers or dry grass . It is constructed under an overhang on a rock cliff face , in a crevice or cave , or on a man @-@ made structure . It takes one to three weeks to build and is re @-@ used for the second brood and in subsequent years . The clutch is two to five eggs with an average of three . The eggs are white with brownish blotches particularly at the wide end , and average 20 @.@ 2 mm × 14 @.@ 0 mm ( 0 @.@ 80 in × 0 @.@ 55 in ) with a weight of 2 @.@ 08 g ( 0 @.@ 073 oz ) . The eggs are incubated mainly by the female for 13 – 17 days to hatching , and the chicks take another 24 – 27 days to fledge . Both parents feed the chicks bringing food every two to five minutes , and the young are fed for 14 – 21 days after fledging . With such frequent feeding rates the adults mainly forage in the best hunting zones in the immediate vicinity of the nest , since the further they fly to forage the longer it would take to bring food to the chicks in the nest . In an Italian study , the hatching rate was 80 @.@ 2 percent , and the average number of fledged young was 3 @.@ 1 . 
 The crag martin has over the last few decades increasingly used houses and other man @-@ made sites to nest . This greater availability of breeding sites has enabled the species to expand its range , but it is possible that this will lead to competition with other hirundines , such as the barn swallow and common house martin , which also use artificial nest sites . 
 An Italian study showed that , as with other aerial feeders , the start of breeding was delayed by cold or wet weather , but this had no influence on the clutch size nor on the number of fledged young . Unexpectedly , it was found that once the eggs had hatched there was a negative relationship between temperature and the number of fledged young . The authors suggested that hot weather dried up the small rivers where the parents found food . Colony size did not influence the laying date , the clutch size or the number of successfully fledged young , but this species does not form large colonies anyway . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 The Eurasian crag martin feeds mainly on insects caught in its beak in flight , although it will occasionally take prey items off rocks , the ground , or a water surface . When breeding , birds often fly back and forth near to a rock face hunting for insects , feeding both inside and outside the nesting territory . At other times , they may hunt flying above streams or alpine meadows . The insects taken depend on what is locally available and may include flies , ants , aerial spiders , and beetles . Aquatic species such as stoneflies , caddisflies and pond skaters appear to be important in at least Spain and Italy . Unlike other hirundines , these birds feed close to their breeding sites , and may be locally vulnerable to fluctuations in insect availability . This martin is gregarious outside the breeding season , and may form sizeable flocks where food is abundant . Cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas . The crag martin exploits the area close to the cliff when it hunts , relying on its high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns . 
 = = Predators and parasites = = 
 This species is occasionally hunted by the peregrine falcon , which shares its mountain habitat , and during its migration over the Himalayas , it is reported to be subject to predation by crows . Common kestrels , Eurasian sparrowhawks , Eurasian jays and common ravens are also treated as predators and attacked by repeated dives if they approach nesting cliffs . Despite the general aggressiveness of the martin , it tolerates sympatric common house martins , perhaps because the large numbers of that highly colonial species provide an early warning of predators . 
 The crag martin is a host of blood @-@ sucking mites of the genus Dermanyssus , including D. <unk> , and of the nasal mite Ptilonyssus <unk> . Two new species of parasites were first discovered on this martin , the fly Ornithomya rupes in Gibraltar and the flea Ceratophyllus <unk> from China .

 The European population of the Eurasian crag martin is estimated to be 360 @,@ 000 – 1 @,@ 110 @,@ 000 individuals , including 120 @,@ 000 – 370 @,@ 000 breeding pairs . A rough estimate of the worldwide population is 500 @,@ 000 – 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 individuals , with Europe hosting between one @-@ quarter and one @-@ half of the total . The population is estimated to be increasing following a northward expansion , which may be partly due to increased use of man @-@ made structures as nest sites . Expansions of the range have been reported in Austria ( where motorway bridges are used as nest sites ) , Switzerland , the former Yugoslavia , Romania , and Bulgaria . With its very large range and high numbers , the Eurasian crag martin is not considered to be threatened , and it is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List . 
 = Indian River Inlet Bridge = 
 The Indian River Inlet Bridge ( officially the Charles W. Cullen Bridge ) is a cable @-@ stayed bridge located in Sussex County , Delaware in the United States . It carries four lanes of Delaware Route 1 ( DE 1 ) over the Indian River Inlet between the Indian River Bay and the Atlantic Ocean . The bridge is within Delaware Seashore State Park between Rehoboth Beach and Bethany Beach . The Indian River Inlet Bridge is maintained by the Delaware Department of Transportation ( DelDOT ) . The bridge is 2 @,@ 600 feet ( 790 m ) long and 107 @.@ 66 feet ( 32 @.@ 81 m ) wide , with a span of 950 feet ( 290 m ) and overhead clearance of 45 feet ( 14 m ) . 
 Prior to the current bridge , four other bridges have spanned the Indian River Inlet , opened in 1934 , 1940 , 1952 , and 1965 , the latter widened by an additional span added in 1976 . All were known informally as the Indian River Inlet Bridge , and all but the first officially were named the Charles W. Cullen Bridge . The 1965 bridge , a steel girder bridge , was subject to scouring from the inlet , leading to the need to replace it . Initial plans for a tied @-@ arch bridge over the inlet in 2004 were over budget , and 2006 plans for a 1 @,@ 400 @-@ foot ( 427 @-@ meter ) cable @-@ stayed bridge were cancelled because of early construction and legal problems . Construction of the current , 2 @,@ 600 @-@ foot ( 792 @-@ meter ) bridge began in 2008 as part of a design @-@ build project , with Skanska awarded the contract to build the bridge . The current Indian River Inlet Bridge opened partially in January 2012 and completely in May 2012 at a cost of $ 150 million . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Indian River Inlet Bridge crosses the Indian River Inlet connecting the Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Indian River Bay to the west . The bridge is located within Delaware Seashore State Park and carries DE 1 between Rehoboth Beach to the north and Bethany Beach to the south . It carries four 12 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 7 @-@ meter ) lanes of traffic ( two northbound and two southbound ) , a 4 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 2 @-@ meter ) interior and 10 @-@ foot ( 3 @-@ meter ) exterior shoulder in each direction , and a 12 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 7 @-@ meter ) -wide sidewalk on the east side of the bridge for pedestrians and bicycles . 
 The Indian River Inlet Bridge is a cable @-@ stayed bridge , consisting of four pylon towers with 152 stays supporting the bridge . The pylons are located on land in order to avoid erosion from the inlet . The bridge has a total length of 2 @,@ 600 feet ( 790 m ) and a total width of 107 @.@ 66 feet ( 32 @.@ 81 m ) . The span of the bridge is 950 feet ( 290 m ) with an overhead clearance of 45 feet ( 14 m ) . The height of the pylon towers is 247 @.@ 5 feet ( 75 @.@ 4 m ) above sea level . The bridge has a fiber @-@ optic system that monitors it for issues that could affect its structural integrity . The bridge is designed to last 100 years . 
 Officially named the Charles W. Cullen Bridge , the bridge is the fourth one at the Indian River Inlet to be named in honor of Charles W. Cullen ( July 8 , 1865 – July 10 , 1948 ) , a lawyer and judge from Georgetown . He served on the Delaware State Highway Commission from 1930 to 1940 and as its chairman from 1938 to 1939 , during which time he oversaw construction of the second bridge to span the Indian River Inlet , replacing a 1934 timber bridge . This bridge was dedicated in May 1940 as the Charles W. Cullen Bridge , but became popularly known as the Indian River Inlet Bridge . The 2012 bridge 's dedication plaque , located at the pedestrian entrance at the south end of the bridge , reads as follows : 
 " This bridge is named in honor and remembrance of Charles West Cullen ( 1865 – 1948 ) , a man who dedicated his life to public service and to the citizens of Delaware . Between 1930 and 1940 , he served on the State Highway Commission , eventually being elevated to Chairman of the Commission from 1938 @-@ 1939 . While he was Chairman , work was started on a new bridge to span the Indian River Inlet . In recognition for his service on the Commission , the bridge was dedicated on May 28 , 1940 , in his name for his advocacy for the proper opening of the inlet and the internal development of the Indian River . Two additional bridges bearing his name have spanned the inlet since that time . This , the fifth bridge to span the inlet waterway , is also being dedicated in his name . As this bridge serves the public , let us not forget the lifetime of service that he gave . " 
 = = History = = 
 The increase in private automobile ownership and growing popularity of Delaware 's beach resort towns during the first half of the 20th century led Delaware to construct the Ocean Highway ( present @-@ day DE 1 and now known as Coastal Highway ) between Rehoboth Beach and Bethany Beach . Completed in 1933 , the Ocean Highway lacked a link to carry it across the Indian River Inlet . 
 Until 1928 , the Indian River Inlet was a natural waterway that shifted up and down a two @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) stretch of the coast . Dredging kept the inlet open in its current location between 1928 and 1937 , and in 1938 the United States Army Corps of Engineers built jetties that hold it in place . With the inlet in a fixed place , it became possible after 1928 to build a bridge to span it , and the completion of the Ocean Highway in 1933 prompted Delaware to build a span to connect the northern and southern segments of the highway . 
 = = = Earlier bridges = = = 
 Five bridges have been constructed across the Indian River Inlet . The first was a creosote timber trestle bridge built in 1934 ; its timbers deteriorated quickly in the maritime environment prevailing at the inlet . It was replaced by a concrete @-@ and @-@ steel swing bridge , the first to be named for Cullen , construction of which began in 1938 . This swing bridge , which included a 4 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 2 @-@ meter ) pedestrian walkway and cost $ 165 @,@ 900 , opened with a dedication ceremony on May 28 , 1940 , but collapsed on February 10 , 1948 , succumbing to a combination of a very high tide combined with an easterly wind and ice flows deeply scouring the inlet bottom under its piers ; a pickup truck on the bridge at the time of the collapse fell into the inlet , killing three men who drowned inside the truck . Another concrete @-@ and @-@ steel swing bridge completed in 1952 , the second to be named for Cullen , also became structurally unsound due to ice flow and was closed in 1962 due to storm damage . 
 The next bridge to be constructed at the site was an 860 @-@ foot ( 262 @-@ meter ) steel girder bridge , the third to be named for Cullen . Its first span opened in 1965 , and it was widened by the addition in 1976 of a second span slightly to the west of the first one , the newer span carrying southbound traffic while the older span became one @-@ way northbound . When the first span opened in 1965 , the inlet was 23 feet ( 7 meters ) deep , but inlet currents led to scouring of the piers of the bridge , first noticed in the 1980s . By the late 1980s , scouring was severe enough to allow U.S. Army Corps of Engineers divers to swim beneath one of the span 's concrete footings . The Corps installed protective riprap around the bridge piers in 1989 , but this was only a temporary solution ; realizing that the bridge could be compromised by damage from just one severe storm , Delaware officials listed it as structurally deficient and requiring replacement . Scouring had increased the inlet 's depth to over 100 feet ( 30 meters ) by 1999 , leading the Corps of Engineers and Delaware officials to question the stability of the pilings and their protective riprap . By 2005 , various reports gave the bridge an expected lifespan of three to five years and estimated that it would have to be closed sometime between 2008 and 2011 and would collapse sometime between 2008 and 2013 . By 2007 , the bridge carried 14 @,@ 000 cars on an average day and an average of 28 @,@ 000 cars per day during the summer months , and the disruption to traffic if the bridge had to be closed before a replacement could open was of increasing concern .

 On August 20 , 2003 , Delaware officials unveiled plans at a public workshop for a new bridge to replace the 1965 bridge and its 1976 addition . A tied @-@ arch design spanning the inlet slightly west of the 1976 addition to the 1965 bridge , the new bridge would have had the longest arched span in the world , with a length of 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 305 meters ) . With an estimated cost of $ 65 million , the new bridge would have had no piers in the water , avoiding the scouring problems that had plagued the earlier spans . Delaware officials hoped that work could begin in the autumn of 2004 and be completed two years later . However , the tied @-@ arch design deterred all but one bidder on the construction contract , and that bid came in much higher than expected and was more than DelDOT could afford at the time . By the autumn of 2005 , a $ 200 million shortfall in the state transportation budget had delayed construction projects all over Delaware and forced the state to put plans for the new bridge on hold , and in the meantime rising labor and materials costs drove the cost of the bridge up to $ 200 million , $ 50 million above the budget . 
 DelDOT scrapped plans for the tied @-@ arch bridge and put bids out in 2006 for a design – build project for a new bridge of a cable @-@ stayed design , 1 @,@ 400 feet ( 427 meters ) long and without piers in the water . Construction of earthen approach ramps for the new bridge began on either side of the inlet in February 2006 ; the ramp on the north side of the inlet was completed in December 2006 and that on the south side was finished in February 2007 . However , concerns over instability of these ramps arose in the autumn of 2006 , and by March 2007 it had become clear that movement of the ramps was greater than expected . Legal problems also began to affect progress , when an unsuccessful bidder on the new construction contract questioned the process by which it had been awarded to another company that had made a bid of $ 124 @.@ 9 million – $ 800 @,@ 000 more than the lowest bid – but had nonetheless won the contract based on ambiguous pricing and technical criteria . Labor union leaders also complained that the winning bidder had not promised to use Delaware union labor , unlike the lower bidder . Faced with the possibility of a lawsuit , DelDOT in October 2007 decided to cancel construction of the bridge under the existing contract , have the unstable approach ramps removed , and rebid the contract for a longer , 2 @,@ 600 @-@ foot ( 792 @-@ meter ) cable @-@ stayed bridge – again without piers in the water – of a new design that did not require the flawed approach ramps . During 2008 , the approach ramps were removed , and the Delaware legislature <unk> a new bond bill making it easier for state officials to award a bid under clearer pricing and technical criteria .

 In August 2008 , Skanska was awarded the $ 150 @-@ million design – build contract to build the new bridge . Skanska started driving test pilings into the ground in the later part of 2008 . In May 2009 , public voting for the aesthetic design features of the bridge decided that the cables would be blue , the pylon tops would be slanted with railings , and the lighting fixtures for the walkway would have a nautical theme . The test pilings for the bridge were completed in June 2009 . Construction of the pylons began in July 2009 with the pouring of concrete into the first pylon . By December 2009 , construction had begun on the approach foundations and the edge girders , with work continuing on the pylon towers and the side abutments . The completion of the design phase of the project and the beginning of the concrete pour for the bridge deck took place in April 2010 . In May 2010 , the bridge received $ 1 @.@ 79 million in federal funding for the pedestrian and bike paths . By this time , the new Indian River Inlet Bridge was about halfway complete . 
 On January 28 , 2011 , DelDOT filed a lawsuit against bridge design firm Figg Bridge Engineers and <unk> <unk> Engineering and Consulting for geotechnical errors . In February 2011 , DelDOT awarded George & Lynch an $ 11 @.@ 6 million contract to build the approach roads to the new Indian River Inlet Bridge as well as to demolish the old bridge . A minor fire occurred on the north side of the bridge construction site ; no damage was reported to the bridge structure . The north side of the bridge was finished in August 2011 when the form travelers were removed . Over 250 people were employed in the construction of the bridge . 
 The new Indian River Inlet Bridge opened to southbound traffic on January 20 , 2012 . Delaware Governor Jack Markell , U.S. Senator Tom Carper , and DelDOT Secretary Shailen Bhatt rode in the first car across the bridge . On January 30 , 2012 , one northbound lane of the new bridge opened . On May 6 , 2012 , the Indian River Inlet Bridge was officially dedicated in a public ceremony in which visitors were able to walk across the bridge . All remaining lanes of the four @-@ lane bridge as well as its pedestrian and bicycle walkway opened that day . 
 Demolition of the 1965 bridge and its 1976 addition began in the spring of 2012 and was completed in the spring of 2013 . 
 = New Zealand = 
 New Zealand / <unk> / ( Māori : Aotearoa [ <unk> ] ) is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean . The country geographically comprises two main landmasses – that of the North Island , or Te Ika @-@ a @-@ Māui , and the South Island , or Te Waipounamu – and numerous smaller islands . New Zealand is situated some 1 @,@ 500 kilometres ( 900 mi ) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly 1 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 600 mi ) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia , Fiji , and Tonga . Because of its remoteness , it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans . During its long period of isolation , New Zealand developed a distinctive biodiversity of animal , fungal and plant life . The country 's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks , such as the Southern Alps , owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions . New Zealand 's capital city is Wellington , while its most populous city is Auckland . 
 Sometime between 1250 and 1300 CE , Polynesians settled in the islands that would later become New Zealand , and developed a distinctive Māori culture . In 1642 , Abel Tasman , a Dutch explorer , became the first European to sight New Zealand . In 1840 , representatives of the British Crown and Māori Chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi , making New Zealand a British colony . Today , the majority of New Zealand 's population of 4 @.@ 7 million is of European descent ; the indigenous Māori are the largest minority , followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders . Reflecting this , New Zealand 's culture is mainly derived from Māori and early British settlers , with recent broadening arising from increased immigration . The official languages are English , Māori and New Zealand Sign Language , with English predominant . 
 New Zealand is a developed country with a market economy . New Zealand is a World Bank high @-@ income economy and ranks highly in international comparisons of national performance , such as health , education , economic freedom and quality of life . Nationally , legislative authority is vested in an elected , unicameral Parliament , while executive political power is exercised by the Cabinet , led by the Prime Minister , who is currently John Key . Queen Elizabeth II is the country 's head of state and is represented by a Governor @-@ General . In addition , New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government purposes . The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau ( a dependent territory ) ; the Cook Islands and Niue ( self @-@ governing states in free association with New Zealand ) ; and the Ross Dependency , which is New Zealand 's territorial claim in Antarctica . New Zealand is a member of the United Nations , Commonwealth of Nations , ANZUS , Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development , Pacific Islands Forum , and Asia @-@ Pacific Economic Cooperation . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Dutch explorer Abel Tasman sighted New Zealand in 1642 and called it Staten Landt , supposing it was connected to a landmass of the same name at the southern tip of South America . In 1645 , Dutch cartographers renamed the land Nova Zeelandia after the Dutch province of Zeeland . British explorer James Cook subsequently anglicised the name to New Zealand . 
 Aotearoa ( often translated as " land of the long white cloud " ) is the current Māori name for New Zealand . It is unknown whether Māori had a name for the whole country before the arrival of Europeans , with Aotearoa originally referring to just the North Island . Māori had several traditional names for the two main islands , including Te Ika @-@ a @-@ Māui ( the fish of Māui ) for the North Island and Te Waipounamu ( the waters of greenstone ) or Te Waka o Aoraki ( the canoe of Aoraki ) for the South Island . Early European maps labelled the islands North ( North Island ) , Middle ( South Island ) and South ( Stewart Island / Rakiura ) . In 1830 , maps began to use North and South to distinguish the two largest islands and by 1907 , this was the accepted norm . The New Zealand Geographic Board discovered in 2009 that the names of the North Island and South Island had never been formalised , and names and alternative names were formalised in 2013 . This set the names as North Island or Te Ika @-@ a @-@ Māui , and South Island or Te Waipounamu . Note that for each island , either its English or Māori name can be used , or both can be used together . 
 = = History = = 
 New Zealand was one of the last major landmasses settled by humans . Radiocarbon dating , evidence of deforestation and mitochondrial DNA variability within Māori populations suggest New Zealand was first settled by Eastern Polynesians between 1250 and 1300 , concluding a long series of voyages through the southern Pacific islands . Over the centuries that followed , these settlers developed a distinct culture now known as Māori . The population was divided into iwi ( tribes ) and <unk> ( subtribes ) who would sometimes cooperate , sometimes compete and sometimes fight against each other . At some point , a group of Māori migrated to the Chatham Islands ( which they named Rēkohu ) where they developed their distinct Moriori culture . The Moriori population was all but wiped out between 1835 and 1862 , largely because of Taranaki Māori invasion and enslavement in the 1830s , although European diseases also contributed . In 1862 , only 101 survived and the last known full @-@ blooded Moriori died in 1933 . 
 The first Europeans known to have reached New Zealand were Dutch explorer Abel Tasman and his crew in 1642 . In a hostile encounter , four crew members were killed and at least one Māori was hit by canister shot . Europeans did not revisit New Zealand until 1769 when British explorer James Cook mapped almost the entire coastline . Following Cook , New Zealand was visited by numerous European and North American whaling , sealing and trading ships . They traded European food , metal tools , weapons and other goods for timber , Māori food , artifacts and water . The introduction of the potato and the musket transformed Māori agriculture and warfare . Potatoes provided a reliable food surplus , which enabled longer and more sustained military campaigns . The resulting intertribal Musket Wars encompassed over 600 battles between 1801 and 1840 , killing 30 @,@ 000 – 40 @,@ 000 Māori . From the early 19th century , Christian missionaries began to settle New Zealand , eventually converting most of the Māori population . The Māori population declined to around 40 percent of its pre @-@ contact level during the 19th century ; introduced diseases were the major factor . 
 In 1788 Captain Arthur Phillip assumed the position of Governor of the new British colony of New South Wales which according to his commission included New Zealand . The British Government appointed James Busby as British Resident to New Zealand in 1832 following a petition from northern Māori . In 1835 , following an announcement of impending French settlement by Charles de Thierry , the nebulous United Tribes of New Zealand sent a Declaration of the Independence to King William IV of the United Kingdom asking for protection . Ongoing unrest , the proposed settlement of New Zealand by the New Zealand Company ( which had already sent its first ship of surveyors to buy land from Māori ) and the dubious legal standing of the Declaration of Independence prompted the Colonial Office to send Captain William Hobson to claim sovereignty for Great Britain and negotiate a treaty with the Māori . The Treaty of Waitangi was first signed in the Bay of Islands on 6 February 1840 . In response to the New Zealand Company 's attempts to establish an independent settlement in Wellington and French settlers purchasing land in Akaroa , Hobson declared British sovereignty over all of New Zealand on 21 May 1840 , even though copies of the Treaty were still circulating throughout the country for Māori to sign . With the signing of the Treaty and declaration of sovereignty the number of immigrants , particularly from the United Kingdom , began to increase . 
 New Zealand , still part of the colony of New South Wales , became a separate Colony of New Zealand on 1 July 1841 . The colony gained a representative government in 1852 and the first Parliament met in 1854 . In 1856 the colony effectively became self @-@ governing , gaining responsibility over all domestic matters other than native policy . ( Control over native policy was granted in the mid @-@ 1860s . ) Following concerns that the South Island might form a separate colony , premier Alfred Domett moved a resolution to transfer the capital from Auckland to a locality near the Cook Strait . Wellington was chosen for its harbour and central location , with parliament officially sitting there for the first time in 1865 . As immigrant numbers increased , conflicts over land led to the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s and 1870s , resulting in the loss and confiscation of much Māori land . 
 In 1891 the Liberal Party led by John <unk> came to power as the first organised political party . The Liberal Government , later led by Richard Seddon , passed many important social and economic measures . In 1893 New Zealand was the first nation in the world to grant all women the right to vote and in 1894 pioneered the adoption of compulsory arbitration between employers and unions . In 1898 Seddon 's government passed the Old @-@ age Pensions Act of 1898 , the first general pensions scheme in the British Empire . 
 In 1907 , at the request of the New Zealand Parliament , King Edward VII proclaimed New Zealand a dominion within the British Empire , reflecting its self @-@ governing status . Accordingly , the title " Dominion of New Zealand " dates from 1907 . 
 In 1947 the country adopted the Statute of Westminster , confirming that the British parliament could no longer legislate for New Zealand without the consent of New Zealand . New Zealand was involved in world affairs , fighting , as part of the British Empire , in the First and Second World Wars and suffering through the Great Depression . The depression led to the election of the first Labour government and the establishment of a comprehensive welfare state and a protectionist economy . New Zealand experienced increasing prosperity following World War II and Māori began to leave their traditional rural life and move to the cities in search of work . A Māori protest movement developed , which criticised Eurocentrism and worked for greater recognition of Māori culture and the Treaty of Waitangi . In 1975 , a Waitangi Tribunal was set up to investigate alleged breaches of the Treaty , and it was enabled to investigate historic grievances in 1985 . The government has negotiated settlements of these grievances with many iwi , although Māori claims to the foreshore and seabed have proved controversial in the 2000s .

 New Zealand is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy , although its constitution is not codified . Elizabeth II is the Queen of New Zealand and the head of state . The Queen is represented by the Governor @-@ General , whom she appoints on the advice of the Prime Minister . The Governor @-@ General can exercise the Crown 's prerogative powers , such as reviewing cases of injustice and making appointments of ministers , ambassadors and other key public officials , and in rare situations , the reserve powers ( e.g. the power to dissolve Parliament or refuse the Royal Assent of a bill into law ) . The powers of the Queen and the Governor @-@ General are limited by constitutional constraints and they cannot normally be exercised without the advice of Cabinet . 
 The New Zealand Parliament holds legislative power and consists of the Queen and the House of Representatives . It also included an upper house , the Legislative Council , until this was abolished in 1950 . The supremacy of Parliament , over the Crown and other government institutions , was established in England by the Bill of Rights 1689 and has been ratified as law in New Zealand . The House of Representatives is democratically elected and a Government is formed from the party or coalition with the majority of seats . If no majority is formed a minority government can be formed if support from other parties during confidence and supply votes is assured . The Governor @-@ General appoints ministers under advice from the Prime Minister , who is by convention the Parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition . Cabinet , formed by ministers and led by the Prime Minister , is the highest policy @-@ making body in government and responsible for deciding significant government actions . By convention , members of cabinet are bound by collective responsibility to decisions made by cabinet . 
 Almost all parliamentary general elections between 1853 and 1993 were held under the first @-@ past @-@ the @-@ post voting system . The elections since 1930 have been dominated by two political parties , National and Labour . Since the 1996 election , a form of proportional representation called Mixed Member Proportional ( MMP ) has been used . Under the MMP system each person has two votes ; one is for electoral seats ( including some reserved for Māori ) , and the other is for a party . Since the 2014 election , there have been 71 electorate seats ( which includes 7 Māori electorates ) , and the remaining 49 seats are assigned so that representation in parliament reflects the party vote , although a party has to win one electoral seat or 5 percent of the total party vote before it is eligible for these seats . Between March 2005 and August 2006 New Zealand became the only country in the world in which all the highest offices in the land ( Head of State , Governor @-@ General , Prime Minister , Speaker and Chief Justice ) were occupied simultaneously by women . 
 Judges and judicial officers are appointed non @-@ politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain constitutional independence from the government . This theoretically allows the judiciary to interpret the law based solely on the legislation enacted by Parliament without other influences on their decisions . The Privy Council in London was the country 's final court of appeal until 2004 , when it was replaced with the newly established Supreme Court of New Zealand . The judiciary , headed by the Chief Justice , includes the Court of Appeal , the High Court , and subordinate courts . 
 New Zealand is identified as one of the world 's most stable and well @-@ governed nations . As of 2011 , the country was ranked fifth in the strength of its democratic institutions and first in government transparency and lack of corruption . New Zealand has a high level of civic participation , with 79 % voter turnout during the most recent elections , compared to an OECD average of 72 % . Furthermore , 67 % of New Zealanders say they trust their political institutions , far higher than the OECD average of 56 % . 
 = = = Foreign relations and the military = = = 
 Early colonial New Zealand allowed the British Government to determine external trade and be responsible for foreign policy . The 1923 and 1926 Imperial Conferences decided that New Zealand should be allowed to negotiate their own political treaties and the first commercial treaty was ratified in 1928 with Japan . On 3 September 1939 New Zealand allied itself with Britain and declared war on Germany with Prime Minister Michael Savage proclaiming , " Where she goes , we go ; where she stands , we stand . " 
 In 1951 the United Kingdom became increasingly focused on its European interests , while New Zealand joined Australia and the United States in the ANZUS security treaty . The influence of the United States on New Zealand weakened following protests over the Vietnam War , the refusal of the United States to admonish France after the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior , disagreements over environmental and agricultural trade issues and New Zealand 's nuclear @-@ free policy . Despite the US 's suspension of ANZUS obligations the treaty remained in effect between New Zealand and Australia , whose foreign policy has followed a similar historical trend . Close political contact is maintained between the two countries , with free trade agreements and travel arrangements that allow citizens to visit , live and work in both countries without restrictions . In 2013 , there are about 650 @,@ 000 New Zealand citizens living in Australia , which is about 15 percent of the population of New Zealand . 65 @,@ 000 Australians live in New Zealand . 
 New Zealand has a strong presence among the Pacific Island countries . A large proportion of New Zealand 's aid goes to these countries and many Pacific people migrate to New Zealand for employment . Permanent migration is regulated under the 1970 Samoan Quota Scheme and the 2002 Pacific Access Category , which allow up to 1 @,@ 100 Samoan nationals and up to 750 other Pacific Islanders respectively to become permanent New Zealand residents each year . A seasonal workers scheme for temporary migration was introduced in 2007 and in 2009 about 8 @,@ 000 Pacific Islanders were employed under it . New Zealand is involved in the Pacific Islands Forum , Asia @-@ Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum ( including the East Asia Summit ) . New Zealand is also a member of the United Nations , the Commonwealth of Nations , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development and the Five Power Defence Arrangements . 
 The New Zealand Defence Force has three branches : the Royal New Zealand Navy , the New Zealand Army and the Royal New Zealand Air Force . New Zealand 's national defence needs are modest because of the unlikelihood of direct attack , although it does have a global presence . The country fought in both world wars , with notable campaigns in Gallipoli , Crete , El Alamein and Cassino . The Gallipoli campaign played an important part in fostering New Zealand 's national identity and strengthened the ANZAC tradition it shares with Australia . According to Mary Edmond @-@ Paul , " World War I had left scars on New Zealand society , with nearly 18 @,@ 500 in total dying as a result of the war , more than 41 @,@ 000 wounded , and others affected emotionally , out of an overseas fighting force of about 103 @,@ 000 and a population of just over a million . " New Zealand also played key parts in the naval Battle of the River Plate and the Battle of Britain air campaign . During World War II , the United States had more than 400 @,@ 000 American military personnel stationed in New Zealand . 
 In addition to Vietnam and the two world wars , New Zealand fought in the Korean War , the Second Boer War , the Malayan Emergency , the Gulf War and the Afghanistan War . It has contributed forces to several regional and global peacekeeping missions , such as those in Cyprus , Somalia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , the Sinai , Angola , Cambodia , the Iran – Iraq border , Bougainville , East Timor , and the Solomon Islands . New Zealand also sent a unit of army engineers to help rebuild Iraqi infrastructure for one year during the Iraq War . 
 New Zealand ranks 8th in the Center for Global Development 's 2012 Commitment to Development Index , which ranks the world 's most developed countries on their dedication to policies that benefit poorer nations . New Zealand is considered the fourth most peaceful country in the world according to the 2014 Global Peace Index . 
 = = = Local government and external territories = = = 
 Officially , New Zealand is divided into 16 regions . 
 The early European settlers divided New Zealand into provinces , which had a degree of autonomy . Because of financial pressures and the desire to consolidate railways , education , land sales and other policies , government was centralised and the provinces were abolished in 1876 . As a result , New Zealand now has no separately represented subnational entities . The provinces are remembered in regional public holidays and sporting rivalries . 
 Since 1876 , various councils have administered local areas under legislation determined by the central government . In 1989 , the government reorganised local government into the current two @-@ tier structure of regional councils and territorial authorities . The 249 municipalities that existed in 1975 have now been consolidated into 67 territorial authorities and 11 regional councils . The regional councils ' role is to regulate " the natural environment with particular emphasis on resource management " , while territorial authorities are responsible for sewage , water , local roads , building consents and other local matters . Five of the territorial councils are unitary authorities and also act as regional councils . The territorial authorities consist of 13 city councils , 53 district councils , and the Chatham Islands Council . While officially the Chatham Islands Council is not a unitary authority , it undertakes many functions of a regional council . 
 New Zealand is one of 16 realms within the Commonwealth . The Realm of New Zealand is the territory over which the Queen of New Zealand is sovereign and comprises New Zealand , Tokelau , the Ross Dependency , the Cook Islands and Niue . The Cook Islands and Niue are self @-@ governing states in free association with New Zealand . The New Zealand Parliament cannot pass legislation for these countries , but with their consent can act on behalf of them in foreign affairs and defence . Tokelau is a non @-@ self @-@ governing territory that uses the New Zealand flag and anthem , but is administered by a council of three elders ( one from each <unk> atoll ) . The Ross Dependency is New Zealand 's territorial claim in Antarctica , where it operates the Scott Base research facility . New Zealand citizenship law treats all parts of the realm equally , so most people born in New Zealand , the Cook Islands , Niue , Tokelau and the Ross Dependency before 2006 are New Zealand citizens . Further conditions apply for those born from 2006 onwards .

 New Zealand is located near the centre of the water hemisphere and is made up of two main islands and a number of smaller islands . The two main islands ( the North Island , or Te Ika @-@ a @-@ Māui , and the South Island , or Te Waipounamu ) are separated by the Cook Strait , 22 kilometres ( 14 mi ) wide at its narrowest point . Besides the North and South Islands , the five largest inhabited islands are Stewart Island , the Chatham Islands , Great Barrier Island ( in the Hauraki Gulf ) , d 'Urville Island ( in the Marlborough Sounds ) and Waiheke Island ( about 22 km ( 14 mi ) from central Auckland ) . The country 's islands lie between latitudes 29 ° and 53 ° S , and longitudes 165 ° and 179 ° E. 
 New Zealand is long and narrow ( over 1 @,@ 600 kilometres ( 990 mi ) along its north @-@ north @-@ east axis with a maximum width of 400 kilometres ( 250 mi ) ) , with about 15 @,@ 000 km ( 9 @,@ 300 mi ) of coastline and a total land area of 268 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 103 @,@ 500 sq mi ) . Because of its far @-@ flung outlying islands and long coastline , the country has extensive marine resources . Its Exclusive Economic Zone is one of the largest in the world , covering more than 15 times its land area . 
 The South Island is the largest landmass of New Zealand , and is divided along its length by the Southern Alps . There are 18 peaks over 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) , the highest of which is Aoraki / Mount Cook at 3 @,@ 754 metres ( 12 @,@ 316 ft ) . Fiordland 's steep mountains and deep <unk> record the extensive ice age glaciation of this south @-@ western corner of the South Island . The North Island is less mountainous but is marked by volcanism . The highly active Taupo Volcanic Zone has formed a large volcanic plateau , punctuated by the North Island 's highest mountain , Mount Ruapehu ( 2 @,@ 797 metres ( 9 @,@ 177 ft ) ) . The plateau also hosts the country 's largest lake , Lake Taupo , nestled in the caldera of one of the world 's most active <unk> . 
 The country owes its varied topography , and perhaps even its emergence above the waves , to the dynamic boundary it straddles between the Pacific and Indo @-@ Australian Plates . New Zealand is part of Zealandia , a microcontinent nearly half the size of Australia that gradually submerged after breaking away from the Gondwanan supercontinent . About 25 million years ago , a shift in plate tectonic movements began to contort and crumple the region . This is now most evident in the Southern Alps , formed by compression of the crust beside the Alpine Fault . Elsewhere the plate boundary involves the subduction of one plate under the other , producing the <unk> Trench to the south , the <unk> Trench east of the North Island , and the Kermadec and Tonga Trenches further north . 
 New Zealand and Australia are both part of the wider regions known as Australasia and Oceania . The term Oceania is often used to denote the region encompassing the Australian continent , New Zealand and various islands in the Pacific Ocean that are not included in the seven @-@ continent model . 
 Landscapes of New Zealand 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 New Zealand has a mild and temperate maritime climate ( Köppen : Cfb ) with mean annual temperatures ranging from 10 ° C ( 50 ° F ) in the south to 16 ° C ( 61 ° F ) in the north . Historical maxima and minima are 42 @.@ 4 ° C ( 108 @.@ 32 ° F ) in Rangiora , Canterbury and − 25 @.@ 6 ° C ( − 14 @.@ 08 ° F ) in Ranfurly , Otago . Conditions vary sharply across regions from extremely wet on the West Coast of the South Island to almost semi @-@ arid in Central Otago and the Mackenzie Basin of inland Canterbury and subtropical in Northland . Of the seven largest cities , Christchurch is the driest , receiving on average only 640 millimetres ( 25 in ) of rain per year and Wellington the wettest , receiving almost twice that amount . Auckland , Wellington and Christchurch all receive a yearly average of more than 2 @,@ 000 hours of sunshine . The southern and south @-@ western parts of the South Island have a cooler and cloudier climate , with around 1 @,@ 400 – 1 @,@ 600 hours ; the northern and north @-@ eastern parts of the South Island are the sunniest areas of the country and receive about 2 @,@ 400 – 2 @,@ 500 hours . The general snow season is about early June until early October in the South Island . Snowfall is less common on the North Island , although it does occur . 
 Climates of New Zealand 
 The table below lists climate normals for the warmest and coldest month in the six largest cities of New Zealand . The North Island cities are generally slightly warmer in February , but the South Island cities are warmest in January . 
 = = = Biodiversity = = = 
 New Zealand 's geographic isolation for 80 million years and island biogeography has influenced evolution of the country 's species of animals , fungi and plants . Physical isolation has not caused biological isolation , and this has resulted in a dynamic evolutionary ecology with examples of very distinctive plants and animals as well as populations of widespread species . About 82 percent of New Zealand 's indigenous vascular plants are endemic , covering 1 @,@ 944 species across 65 genera and includes a single endemic family . The number of fungi recorded from New Zealand , including lichen @-@ forming species , is not known , nor is the proportion of those fungi which are endemic , but one estimate suggests there are about 2 @,@ 300 species of lichen @-@ forming fungi in New Zealand and 40 percent of these are endemic . The two main types of forest are those dominated by broadleaf trees with emergent podocarps , or by southern beech in cooler climates . The remaining vegetation types consist of grasslands , the majority of which are tussock . 
 Before the arrival of humans an estimated 80 percent of the land was covered in forest , with only high alpine , wet , infertile and volcanic areas without trees . Massive deforestation occurred after humans arrived , with around half the forest cover lost to fire after Polynesian settlement . Much of the remaining forest fell after European settlement , being logged or cleared to make room for pastoral farming , leaving forest occupying only 23 percent of the land . 
 The forests were dominated by birds , and the lack of mammalian predators led to some like the kiwi , kakapo , weka and <unk> evolving flightlessness . The arrival of humans , associated changes to habitat , and the introduction of rats , ferrets and other mammals led to the extinction of many bird species , including large birds like the moa and Haast 's eagle . 
 Other indigenous animals are represented by reptiles ( tuataras , skinks and geckos ) , frogs , spiders ( katipo ) , insects ( weta ) and snails . Some , such as the wrens and tuatara , are so unique that they have been called living fossils . Three species of bats ( one since extinct ) were the only sign of native land mammals in New Zealand until the 2006 discovery of bones from a unique , mouse @-@ sized land mammal at least 16 million years old . Marine mammals however are abundant , with almost half the world 's cetaceans ( whales , dolphins , and porpoises ) and large numbers of fur seals reported in New Zealand waters . Many seabirds breed in New Zealand , a third of them unique to the country . More penguin species are found in New Zealand than in any other country . 
 Since human arrival almost half of the country 's vertebrate species have become extinct , including at least fifty @-@ one birds , three frogs , three lizards , one freshwater fish , and one bat . Others are endangered or have had their range severely reduced . However , New Zealand conservationists have pioneered several methods to help threatened wildlife recover , including island sanctuaries , pest control , wildlife translocation , fostering , and ecological restoration of islands and other selected areas . According to the 2012 Environmental Performance Index , New Zealand is considered a " strong performer " in environmental protection , ranking 14th out of 132 assessed countries . 
 = = Economy = = 
 New Zealand has a modern , prosperous and developed market economy with an estimated gross domestic product ( GDP ) at purchasing power parity ( PPP ) per capita of roughly NZ $ 47 @,@ 784 . The currency is the New Zealand dollar , informally known as the " Kiwi dollar " ; it also circulates in the Cook Islands ( see Cook Islands dollar ) , Niue , Tokelau , and the Pitcairn Islands . New Zealand was ranked sixth in the 2013 Human Development Index , fourth in The Heritage Foundation 's 2012 Index of Economic Freedom , and 13th in INSEAD 's 2012 Global Innovation Index . 
 Historically , extractive industries have contributed strongly to New Zealand 's economy , focussing at different times on sealing , whaling , flax , gold , kauri gum , and native timber . With the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat and dairy products were exported to Britain , a trade which provided the basis for strong economic growth in New Zealand . High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s . In 1973 , New Zealand 's export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Community and other compounding factors , such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crisis , led to a severe economic depression . Living standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe , and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per @-@ capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank . Since 1984 , successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring ( known first as <unk> and then <unk> ) , rapidly transforming New Zealand from a highly protectionist economy to a liberalised free @-@ trade economy . 
 Unemployment peaked above 10 percent in 1991 and 1992 , following the 1987 share market crash , but eventually fell to a record low of 3 @.@ 4 percent in 2007 ( ranking fifth from twenty @-@ seven comparable OECD nations ) . However , the global financial crisis that followed had a major impact on New Zealand , with the GDP shrinking for five consecutive quarters , the longest recession in over thirty years , and unemployment rising back to 7 percent in late 2009 . At May 2012 , the general unemployment rate was around 6 @.@ 7 percent , while the unemployment rate for youth aged 15 to 21 was 13 @.@ 6 percent . In the September 2014 quarter , unemployment was 5 @.@ 4 % . New Zealand has experienced a series of " brain drains " since the 1970s that still continue today . Nearly one quarter of highly skilled workers live overseas , mostly in Australia and Britain , which is the largest proportion from any developed nation . In recent years , however , a " brain gain " has brought in educated professionals from Europe and less developed countries . 
 = = = Trade = = = 
 New Zealand is heavily dependent on international trade , particularly in agricultural products . Exports account for 24 percent of its output , making New Zealand vulnerable to international commodity prices and global economic slowdowns . Food products made up 55 % of the value of all the country 's exports in 2014 ; wood was the second largest earner ( 7 % ) . Its major export partners are Australia , United States , Japan , China , and the United Kingdom . On 7 April 2008 , New Zealand and China signed the New Zealand – China Free Trade Agreement , the first such agreement China has signed with a developed country . The service sector is the largest sector in the economy , followed by manufacturing and construction and then farming and raw material extraction . Tourism plays a significant role in New Zealand 's economy , contributing $ 15 @.@ 0 billion to New Zealand ’ s total GDP and supporting 9 @.@ 6 percent of the total workforce in 2010 . International visitors to New Zealand increased by 3 @.@ 1 percent in the year to October 2010 and are expected to increase at a rate of 2 @.@ 5 percent annually up to 2015 . 
 In 1984 New Zealand eliminated agricultural subsidies . 
 Wool was New Zealand ’ s major agricultural export during the late 19th century . Even as late as the 1960s it made up over a third of all export revenues , but since then its price has steadily dropped relative to other commodities and wool is no longer profitable for many farmers . In contrast dairy farming increased , with the number of dairy cows doubling between 1990 and 2007 , to become New Zealand 's largest export earner . In the year to June 2009 , dairy products accounted for 21 percent ( $ 9 @.@ 1 billion ) of total merchandise exports , and the country 's largest company , <unk> , controls almost one @-@ third of the international dairy trade . Other agricultural exports in 2009 were meat 13 @.@ 2 percent , wool 6 @.@ 3 percent , fruit 3 @.@ 5 percent and fishing 3 @.@ 3 percent . New Zealand 's wine industry has followed a similar trend to dairy , the number of vineyards doubling over the same period , overtaking wool exports for the first time in 2007 . 
 = = = Infrastructure = = = 
 In 2014 , renewable energy generated 39 @.@ 5 percent of New Zealand 's gross energy supply , primarily hydroelectric power and geothermal power . 
 New Zealand 's transport network comprises 93 @,@ 805 kilometres ( 58 @,@ 288 mi ) of roads , including 199 kilometres ( 124 mi ) of motorways , and 4 @,@ 128 kilometres ( 2 @,@ 565 mi ) of railway lines . Most major cities and towns are linked by bus services , although the private car is the predominant mode of transport . The railways were privatised in 1993 , but were re @-@ nationalised by the government in stages between 2004 and 2008 . The state @-@ owned enterprise <unk> now operates the railways , with the exception of Auckland commuter services which are operated by Transdev . Railways run the length of the country , although most lines now carry freight rather than passengers . Most international visitors arrive via air and New Zealand has six international airports , but currently only the Auckland and Christchurch airports connect directly with countries other than Australia or Fiji . 
 The New Zealand Post Office had a monopoly over telecommunications until 1987 when Telecom New Zealand was formed , initially as a state @-@ owned enterprise and then privatised in 1990 . Telecom was rebranded as Spark New Zealand in 2014 . Chorus , which was split from Telecom in 2011 , still owns the majority of the telecommunications infrastructure , but competition from other providers has increased . The United Nations International Telecommunication Union ranks New Zealand 12th in the development of information and communications infrastructure , having moved up four places between 2008 and 2010 . 
 = = = = Water supply and sanitation = = = = 
 Water supply and sanitation in New Zealand is universal and of good quality in urban areas . It is provided by local government called Territorial Authorities in New Zealand . Territorial Authorities consist of 14 city councils in urban areas and 53 district councils in rural areas . The legal framework includes the Health Act 1956 amended in 2007 , the Local Government Act 2002 and the Resource Management Act 1991 . 
 = = Demography = = 
 As of June 2015 , the population of New Zealand is estimated at 4 @.@ 597 million . New Zealand is a predominantly urban country , with 72 percent of the population living in 16 main urban areas and 53 percent living in the four largest cities of Auckland , Christchurch , Wellington , and Hamilton . New Zealand cities generally rank highly on international livability measures . For instance , in 2010 Auckland was ranked the world 's 4th most liveable city and Wellington the 12th by the Mercer Quality of Life Survey . 
 Life expectancy for New Zealanders in 2012 was 84 years for females , and 80 @.@ 2 years for males . Life expectancy at birth is forecast to increase from 80 years to 85 years in 2050 and infant mortality is expected to decline . New Zealand 's fertility rate of 2 @.@ 1 is relatively high for a developed country , and natural births account for a significant proportion of population growth . Consequently , the country has a young population compared to most industrialized nations , with 20 percent of New Zealanders being 14 years old or younger . By 2050 the population is forecast to reach 5 @.@ 3 million , the median age to rise from 36 years to 43 years and the percentage of people 60 years of age and older to rise from 18 percent to 29 percent . Despite the high life expectancy , mortality from heart disease is higher in New Zealand than it is in various other developed Western countries such as Australia , the United Kingdom and Canada . 
 = = = Ethnicity and immigration = = = 
 In the 2013 census , 74 @.@ 0 % of New Zealand residents identified ethnically as European , and 14 @.@ 9 % as Māori . Other major ethnic groups include Asian ( 11 @.@ 8 % ) and Pacific peoples ( 7 @.@ 4 % ) , of which two @-@ thirds live in the Auckland region . The population has become more diverse in recent decades : in 1961 , the census reported that the population of New Zealand was 92 percent European and 7 percent Māori , with Asian and Pacific minorities sharing the remaining 1 percent . 
 While the demonym for a New Zealand citizen is New Zealander , the informal " Kiwi " is commonly used both internationally and by locals . The Māori loanword Pākehā has been used to refer to New Zealanders of European descent , although others reject this appellation . The word Pākehā today is increasingly used to refer to all non @-@ Polynesian New Zealanders . 
 The Māori were the first people to reach New Zealand , followed by the early European settlers . Following colonisation , immigrants were predominantly from Britain , Ireland and Australia because of restrictive policies similar to the white Australian policies . There was also significant Dutch , Dalmatian , Italian , and German immigration , together with indirect European immigration through Australia , North America , South America and South Africa . Following the Great Depression policies were relaxed and migrant diversity increased . In 2009 – 10 , an annual target of 45 @,@ 000 – 50 @,@ 000 permanent residence approvals was set by the New Zealand Immigration Service — more than one new migrant for every 100 New Zealand residents . Just over 25 % of New Zealand 's population was born overseas , with the majority ( 52 % ) living in the Auckland region . The United Kingdom remains the largest source of New Zealand 's overseas population , with a quarter of all overseas @-@ born New Zealanders born there ; other major sources of New Zealand 's overseas @-@ born population are China , India , Australia , South Africa , Fiji and Samoa . The number of fee @-@ paying international students increased sharply in the late 1990s , with more than 20 @,@ 000 studying in public tertiary institutions in 2002 . 
 = = = Language = = = 
 English is the predominant language in New Zealand , spoken by 98 percent of the population . New Zealand English is similar to Australian English and many speakers from the Northern Hemisphere are unable to tell the accents apart . The most prominent differences between the New Zealand English dialect and other English dialects are the shifts in the short front vowels : the short- " i " sound ( as in " kit " ) has centralised towards the schwa sound ( the " a " in " comma " and " about " ) ; the short- " e " sound ( as in " dress " ) has moved towards the short- " i " sound ; and the short- " a " sound ( as in " trap " ) has moved to the short- " e " sound . Hence , the New Zealand pronunciation of words such as " bad " , " dead " , " fish " and " chips " sound like " bed " , " did " , " <unk> " and " chups " to non @-@ New Zealanders . 
 After the Second World War , Māori were discouraged from speaking their own language ( te reo Māori ) in schools and workplaces and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas . It has recently undergone a process of revitalisation , being declared one of New Zealand 's official languages in 1987 , and is spoken by 4 @.@ 1 percent of the population . There are now Māori language immersion schools and two Māori Television channels , the only nationwide television channels to have the majority of their prime @-@ time content delivered in Māori . Many places have both their Māori and English names officially recognised . Samoan is the most widely spoken non @-@ official language in New Zealand ( 2 @.@ 3 percent ) , followed by Hindi , Mandarin Chinese , French , and Yue Chinese ( Cantonese ) . New Zealand Sign Language is used by about 28 @,@ 000 people . It was declared one of New Zealand 's official languages in 2006 . 
 = = = Education = = = 
 Primary and secondary schooling is compulsory for children aged 6 to 16 , with the majority attending from the age of 5 . There are 13 school years and attending state ( public ) schools is free to New Zealand citizens and permanent residents from a person 's 5th birthday to the end of the calendar year following their 19th birthday . New Zealand has an adult literacy rate of 99 percent , and over half of the population aged 15 to 29 hold a tertiary qualification . There are five types of government @-@ owned tertiary institutions : universities , colleges of education , polytechnics , specialist colleges , and <unk> , in addition to private training establishments . In the adult population 14 @.@ 2 percent have a bachelor 's degree or higher , 30 @.@ 4 percent have some form of secondary qualification as their highest qualification and 22 @.@ 4 percent have no formal qualification . The OECD 's Programme for International Student Assessment ranks New Zealand 's education system as the 7th best in the world , with students performing exceptionally well in reading , mathematics and science . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 Christianity is the predominant religion in New Zealand , although its society is among the most secular in the world . In the 2013 Census , 55 @.@ 0 percent of the population identified with one or more religions , including 49 @.@ 0 percent identifying as Christians . Another 41 @.@ 9 percent indicated that they had no religion . The main Christian denominations are Roman Catholicism ( 12 @.@ 6 percent ) , Anglicanism ( 11 @.@ 8 percent ) , Presbyterianism ( 8 @.@ 5 percent ) and " Christian not further defined " ( i.e. people identifying as Christian but not stating the denomination , 5 @.@ 5 percent ) . The Māori @-@ based <unk> and <unk> religions ( 1 @.@ 4 percent ) are also Christian . Other significant minority religions include Hinduism ( 2 @.@ 3 percent ) , Buddhism ( 1 @.@ 5 percent ) and Islam ( 1 @.@ 2 percent ) .

 Early Māori adapted the <unk> based east Polynesian culture in line with the challenges associated with a larger and more diverse environment , eventually developing their own distinctive culture . Social organisation was largely communal with families ( <unk> ) , sub @-@ tribes ( <unk> ) and tribes ( iwi ) ruled by a chief ( rangatira ) whose position was subject to the community 's approval . The British and Irish immigrants brought aspects of their own culture to New Zealand and also influenced Māori culture , particularly with the introduction of Christianity . However , Māori still regard their allegiance to tribal groups as a vital part of their identity , and Māori kinship roles resemble those of other Polynesian peoples . More recently American , Australian , Asian and other European cultures have exerted influence on New Zealand . Non @-@ Māori Polynesian cultures are also apparent , with <unk> , the world 's largest Polynesian festival , now an annual event in Auckland . 
 The largely rural life in early New Zealand led to the image of New Zealanders being rugged , industrious problem solvers . Modesty was expected and enforced through the " tall poppy syndrome " , where high achievers received harsh criticism . At the time New Zealand was not known as an intellectual country . From the early 20th century until the late 1960s Māori culture was suppressed by the attempted assimilation of Māori into British New Zealanders . In the 1960s , as higher education became more available and cities expanded urban culture began to dominate . Even though the majority of the population now lives in cities , much of New Zealand 's art , literature , film and humour has rural themes . From around the middle of the 20th century , many cultural icons called <unk> , started to emerge that now help to define what it means to be a New Zealander ; such as the silver fern and the paua shell .

 As part of the resurgence of Māori culture , the traditional crafts of carving and weaving are now more widely practised and Māori artists are increasing in number and influence . Most Māori carvings feature human figures , generally with three fingers and either a natural @-@ looking , detailed head or a grotesque head . Surface patterns consisting of spirals , ridges , notches and fish scales decorate most carvings . The pre @-@ eminent Māori architecture consisted of carved meeting houses ( <unk> ) decorated with symbolic carvings and illustrations . These buildings were originally designed to be constantly rebuilt , changing and adapting to different whims or needs . 
 Māori decorated the white wood of buildings , canoes and cenotaphs using red ( a mixture of red ochre and shark fat ) and black ( made from soot ) paint and painted pictures of birds , reptiles and other designs on cave walls . Māori tattoos ( moko ) consisting of coloured soot mixed with gum were cut into the flesh with a bone chisel . Since European arrival paintings and photographs have been dominated by landscapes , originally not as works of art but as factual portrayals of New Zealand . Portraits of Māori were also common , with early painters often portraying them as " noble savages " , exotic beauties or friendly natives . The country 's isolation delayed the influence of European artistic trends allowing local artists to developed their own distinctive style of regionalism . During the 1960s and 70s many artists combined traditional Māori and Western techniques , creating unique art forms . New Zealand art and craft has gradually achieved an international audience , with exhibitions in the Venice Biennale in 2001 and the " Paradise Now " exhibition in New York in 2004 . 
 Māori cloaks are made of fine flax fibre and patterned with black , red and white triangles , diamonds and other geometric shapes . <unk> was fashioned into earrings and necklaces , with the most well @-@ known design being the hei @-@ tiki , a distorted human figure sitting cross @-@ legged with its head tilted to the side . Europeans brought English fashion etiquette to New Zealand , and until the 1950s most people dressed up for social occasions . Standards have since relaxed and New Zealand fashion has received a reputation for being casual , practical and lacklustre . However , the local fashion industry has grown significantly since 2000 , doubling exports and increasing from a handful to about 50 established labels , with some labels gaining international recognition . 
 = = = Literature = = = 
 Māori quickly adopted writing as a means of sharing ideas , and many of their oral stories and poems were converted to the written form . Most early English literature was obtained from Britain and it was not until the 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that New Zealand literature started to become widely known . Although still largely influenced by global trends ( modernism ) and events ( the Great Depression ) , writers in the 1930s began to develop stories increasingly focused on their experiences in New Zealand . During this period literature changed from a journalistic activity to a more academic pursuit . Participation in the world wars gave some New Zealand writers a new perspective on New Zealand culture and with the post @-@ war expansion of universities local literature flourished . Dunedin is a UNESCO City of Literature .

 New Zealand music has been influenced by blues , jazz , country , rock and roll and hip hop , with many of these genres given a unique New Zealand interpretation . Māori developed traditional chants and songs from their ancient South @-@ East Asian origins , and after centuries of isolation created a unique " monotonous " and " doleful " sound . Flutes and trumpets were used as musical instruments or as signalling devices during war or special occasions . Early settlers brought over their ethnic music , with brass bands and choral music being popular , and musicians began touring New Zealand in the 1860s . Pipe bands became widespread during the early 20th century . The New Zealand recording industry began to develop from 1940 onwards and many New Zealand musicians have obtained success in Britain and the United States . Some artists release Māori language songs and the Māori tradition @-@ based art of <unk> haka ( song and dance ) has made a resurgence . The New Zealand Music Awards are held annually by Recorded Music NZ ; the awards were first held in 1965 by Reckitt & Colman as the <unk> Golden Disc awards . Recorded Music NZ also publishes the country 's official weekly record charts . 
 Radio first arrived in New Zealand in 1922 and television in 1960 . The number of New Zealand films significantly increased during the 1970s . In 1978 the New Zealand Film Commission started assisting local film @-@ makers and many films attained a world audience , some receiving international acknowledgement . The highest grossing New Zealand movies include : Hunt for the <unk> , Boy , The World 's Fastest Indian , Once Were Warriors , and Whale Rider . Deregulation in the 1980s saw a sudden increase in the numbers of radio and television stations . New Zealand television primarily broadcasts American and British programming , along with a large number of Australian and local shows . The country 's diverse scenery and compact size , plus government incentives , have encouraged some producers to film big budget movies in New Zealand , including Avatar , The Lord of the Rings , The Hobbit , The Chronicles of Narnia , King Kong and The Last Samurai . The New Zealand media industry is dominated by a small number of companies , most of which are foreign @-@ owned , although the state retains ownership of some television and radio stations . Between 2003 and 2008 , Reporters Without Borders consistently ranked New Zealand 's press freedom in the top twenty . As of 2011 , New Zealand was ranked 13th worldwide in press freedom by Freedom House , with the 2nd freest media in the Asia @-@ Pacific region after Palau .
