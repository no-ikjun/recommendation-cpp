 In Ardis , Maryland , a high @-@ speed police chase unfolds at a waterfront . The driver of the car , Dr. William Secare , is cornered by officers but fights them off with surprising ease . Secare is shot as he runs up a gangplank and leaps off a ship into the water . The police fail to locate him but discover that his blood is green . 
 Soon afterwards , Deep Throat ( Jerry Hardin ) approaches Fox Mulder with Secare 's case , saying he is of major importance to revealing the truth . When investigating the case , Mulder and Dana Scully visit Dr. Terrance Berube ( Ken Kramer ) , a scientist working in Gaithersburg , Maryland , whose car was being driven by Secare . That night , Deep Throat meets a second time with Mulder and insists he continue , despite Mulder 's uncertainty on what he should be looking for . That night , Berube is confronted by the " Crew Cut Man " ( Lindsey Ginter ) , who kills him and makes the death look like a suicide . 
 While investigating the crime scene , Mulder finds an Erlenmeyer flask labeled " Purity Control . " Scully takes the flask to Georgetown University , where Dr. Anne Carpenter ( Anne De Salvo ) helps her analyze its contents . Meanwhile , Mulder heads to Berube 's home and finds keys for a storage facility . Secare calls Berube 's home office and Mulder answers , pretending to be Berube . Secare tells who he believes to be Berube that he 's been in the water for three days , and is hurt . Meanwhile , the Crew Cut Man eavesdrops on the conversation . Secare collapses due to blood loss before he can tell Mulder where he is . While he is driven away in an ambulance , a poisonous gas emits from Secare 's body when the paramedics perform a needle decompression . Secare recovers and flees from the ambulance . 
 Mulder arrives at the storage facility and finds five men suspended in tanks , as well as a sixth empty tank . Mulder is pursued when he leaves the facility but escapes . Carpenter reveals that the " Purity Control " flask contains a sample of bacteria that doesn 't exist anywhere in nature and can only be described as extraterrestrial . Upon revisiting the storage facility the next day with Scully , Mulder discovers the room to be completely empty . Deep Throat arrives , revealing that Berube was experimenting on humans with extraterrestrial viruses . Six terminally ill volunteers were experimented on , and all had begun recovering . When it was ordered that they be destroyed , Berube helped Secare escape . 
 Scully learns that Carpenter and her entire family have been killed in an automobile accident . Mulder returns to Berube 's home and finds Secare , who is killed by the Crew Cut Man . Mulder passes out from exposure to the gas escaping from Secare 's wound and is captured . Deep Throat meets Scully outside of Mulder 's apartment and says that he may be able to make a deal with Mulder 's captors . He gives Scully the credentials necessary to enter the High Containment Facility at Fort Marlene , where Scully finds an alien fetus contained within liquid nitrogen . At an exchange on a freeway overpass , Deep Throat presents the fetus to the Crew Cut Man , who shoots him seconds later . Mulder is thrown out of the Crew Cut Man 's van as he drives off . Scully tends to Deep Throat , whose last words before dying are , " Trust no one " . 
 Several weeks later , a despondent Mulder calls Scully to inform her that the X @-@ Files have been shut down . Meanwhile , in a scene mirroring the conclusion to the pilot , the Smoking Man stores the alien fetus in the massive evidence room within the Pentagon .

 Chris Carter wrote the teleplay for the episode , which he described as " the result of an year @-@ long learning experience " . Carter tried to firmly establish the mythology of the series , " where we explored the different avenues of government conspiracy , and turning it into more than just flying saucers " , and having what the writer called a " defining moment " for Scully , where the agent would hear from a fellow scientist that she was dealing with truly extraterrestrial material . The scene where poisonous fumes were emitted by Dr. Secare was inspired by the case of Gloria Ramirez , which occurred in California in February 1994 ; Carter remembered this when writing the script , and it became an established aspect of the mythology in subsequent seasons . 
 The writers killed off the recurring character " Deep Throat " to give audiences the impression that anyone outside of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully were expendable . The decision to shut down the X @-@ Files was done to separate Mulder and Scully , allowing the producers to work around Gillian Anderson 's pregnancy ( which contributed to an important plot development in the second season and affected the rest of the series ) . Fox initially opposed the idea , fearing that closing down the X @-@ Files would lead viewers to believe that the show had been cancelled . 
 The ending of this episode mirrors that of the " Pilot " , including Mulder calling Scully at 11 : 21 pm and the " Cigarette Smoking Man " storing evidence in The Pentagon . The tagline for this episode is " Trust No One " , replacing the usual phrase " The Truth is Out There " and referencing " Deep Throat " ' s last words . Executive producer R. W. Goodwin decided to make his directorial debut with the episode , as he considered it " the best script by far " , offering " a combination of elation and stark terror " . 
 = = = Filming and effects = = = 
 The opening car chase was shot by crew member J.P. Finn , who was the lone producer and directed much of the second unit . It was shot at an abandoned shipyard in North Vancouver known as <unk> Shipyard . Goodwin went so far as saying that the location " was perfect " for them to shoot in ; it would be reused in the third season episode " 2Shy . " The scene with Fox Mulder and Dana Scully visiting Doctor Berube ( Ken Kramer ) was a " big challenge " due to the use of monkeys ; Goodwin wanted the monkeys to all act " crazy " at the same time on cue when filming . When looking back , he said they did a " pretty good job " . The location used for the warehouse where Mulder finds the tanks had the address " 1616 Pandora " , which the producers decided to incorporate into the episode itself as a symbol of Mulder " opening Pandora 's box " . 
 The scene where Mulder has entered in the warehouse and searched for the room number utilizes an in @-@ camera dolly zoom effect . 
 The shot of Dr. Secare resurfacing out of the water was created by the visual effects unit . Actor Simon Webb was raised up on a crane under the water , which had been levered so that he could " actually " be raised out of the bay . According to Goodwin , the timing was not quite right , but that failed shot " worked " on a different level and proved to be a " fascinating shot " . The scene had to be re @-@ shot later , however . When filming the episode the production crew did not know that Webb had a phobia towards water . The first test shot of Scully removing the alien fetus doll from liquid nitrogen went right , but under the hot studio lights the model started falling apart , leading the following take to flash the lighting in another direction . 
 = = Reception = = 
 This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 8 @.@ 8 , with a 16 share . It was viewed by 8 @.@ 3 million households , making it the most viewed episode of the first season . The Mystery Writers of America nominated " The Erlenmeyer Flask " for an Edgar Award in the Best Episode in a TV Series category ; the eventual recipient of the award was " Simone Says " of NYPD Blue . John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode 9 out of 10 , saying it was " the perfect ending to the first season " and a good introduction to The X @-@ Files mythology . Manuel <unk> from The Dallas Morning News said the episode was able to blend " absolutely chilling " moments with " completely silly " moments " at the same time " . Entertainment Weekly writer Bruce Fretts concluded that the death of " Deep Throat " made the character " very real " . 
 Crew members have also reacted positively towards the episode . Carter said of the episode : " The Erlenmeyer Flask brings back nothing but good memories . It just has terrific images in it ; it really brought the series in its first year full circle . It was successful in doing what we wanted to do , which was to close down the X @-@ Files . It shocked a lot of people " . Goodwin commented : " Everything about that episode is absolutely first class . The acting , the art direction , the camera work . There 's nothing in it that isn 't the best you can get , and that 's really a credit to a lot of very talented people " . The episode introduced many concepts and themes that would appear in the mythology episodes for the show throughout the years including genetic experiments , alien @-@ human hybrids , toxic alien blood , government conspiracies , alien fetuses and deadly assassins . 
 = Warfarin = 
 Warfarin , also known by the brand names Coumadin among others , is an anticoagulant normally used in the prevention of thrombosis and thromboembolism , the formation of blood clots in the blood vessels and their migration elsewhere in the body , respectively . It was initially introduced in 1948 as a pesticide against rats and mice , and is still used for this purpose , although more potent poisons such as brodifacoum have since been developed . In the early 1950s , warfarin was found to be effective and relatively safe for preventing thrombosis and thromboembolism in many disorders . It was approved for use as a medication in 1954 , and has remained popular ever since . Warfarin is the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant drug in North America . 
 Despite its effectiveness , treatment with warfarin has several shortcomings . Many commonly used medications interact with warfarin , as do some foods ( particularly leaf vegetable foods or " greens , " since these typically contain large amounts of vitamin K1 ) and its activity has to be monitored by blood testing for the international normalized ratio ( INR ) to ensure an adequate yet safe dose is taken . A high INR predisposes patients to an increased risk of bleeding , while an INR below the therapeutic target indicates the dose of warfarin is insufficient to protect against <unk> events . 
 Warfarin and related 4 @-@ hydroxycoumarin @-@ containing molecules decrease blood coagulation by inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase , an enzyme that recycles oxidized vitamin K1 to its reduced form after it has participated in the carboxylation of several blood coagulation proteins , mainly prothrombin and factor VII . Despite being labeled a vitamin K antagonist , warfarin does not antagonize the action of vitamin K1 , but rather antagonizes vitamin K1 recycling , depleting active vitamin K1 . Thus , the pharmacologic action may always be reversed by fresh vitamin K1 . When administered , these drugs do not <unk> blood immediately . Instead , onset of their effect requires about two to three days before remaining active clotting factors have had time to naturally disappear in metabolism , and the duration of action of a single dose of warfarin is 2 to 5 days . Reversal of warfarin 's effect by discontinuing its use , or by administering vitamin K1 , requires a similar period of time . 
 Warfarin is a synthetic derivative of dicoumarol , a 4 @-@ hydroxycoumarin @-@ derived mycotoxin anticoagulant originally discovered in spoiled sweet clover @-@ based animal feeds . <unk> , in turn , is derived from coumarin , a sweet @-@ smelling but coagulation @-@ inactive chemical found naturally in " sweet " clover ( to which it gives its odor and name ) , tonka beans ( also known as " <unk> " from which coumarin 's name derives ) , and many other plants . The name ' warfarin ' stems from its discovery at the University of Wisconsin , incorporating the acronym for the organization that funded the key research , " <unk> " for the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the ending " <unk> " , indicating its link with coumarin . 
 = = Medical uses = = 
 Warfarin is used to decrease the tendency for thrombosis or as secondary prophylaxis ( prevention of further episodes ) in those individuals who have already formed a blood clot ( thrombus ) . Warfarin treatment can help prevent formation of future blood clots and help reduce the risk of embolism ( migration of a thrombus to a spot where it blocks blood supply to a vital organ ) . 
 Warfarin is best suited for anticoagulation ( clot formation inhibition ) in areas of slowly running blood ( such as in veins and the pooled blood behind artificial and natural valves ) and in blood pooled in dysfunctional cardiac atria . Thus , common clinical indications for warfarin use are atrial fibrillation , the presence of artificial heart valves , deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolism ( where the <unk> clots first form in veins ) . Warfarin is also used in antiphospholipid syndrome . It has been used occasionally after heart attacks ( myocardial <unk> ) , but is far less effective at preventing new <unk> in coronary arteries . Prevention of clotting in arteries is usually undertaken with antiplatelet drugs , which act by a different mechanism from warfarin ( which normally has no effect on platelet function ) . 
 = = = Alternative anticoagulants = = = 
 In some countries , other coumarins are used instead of warfarin , such as <unk> and phenprocoumon . These have a shorter ( <unk> ) or longer ( phenprocoumon ) half @-@ life , and are not completely interchangeable with warfarin . Several types of anticoagulant drugs offering the efficacy of warfarin without a need for monitoring , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , have been approved in a number of countries for classical warfarin uses like the more common types of atrial fibrillation , and others in the same drug classes are under development . However , reversal agents for these alternative anticoagulants are currently not available . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 <unk> of warfarin is complicated because it is known to interact with many commonly used medications and certain foods . These interactions may enhance or reduce warfarin 's anticoagulation effect . To optimize the therapeutic effect without risking dangerous side effects such as bleeding , close monitoring of the degree of anticoagulation is required by a blood test measuring an INR . During the initial stage of treatment , INR is checked daily ; intervals between tests can be lengthened if the patient manages stable therapeutic INR levels on an unchanged warfarin dose . Newer point @-@ of @-@ care testing is available and has increased the ease of INR testing in the outpatient setting . Instead of a blood draw , the point of care test involves a simple finger prick . 
 When initiating warfarin therapy ( " <unk> " ) , the doctor will decide how strong the anticoagulant therapy needs to be . The target INR level varies from case to case depending on the clinical indicators , but tends to be 2 – 3 in most conditions . In particular , target INR may be 2 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 5 ( or even 3 @.@ 0 – 4 @.@ 5 ) in patients with one or more mechanical heart valves . 
 In addition , for the first three days of " <unk> " , the levels of protein C and protein S ( anticoagulation factors ) drop faster than <unk> proteins such as factor II , VII , IX , and X. Therefore , bridging anticoagulant therapies ( usually heparin ) are often used to reverse this temporary hypercoagulable state . 
 = = = = Maintenance dose = = = = 
 Recommendations by many national bodies , including the American College of Chest Physicians , have been distilled to help manage dose adjustments . 
 The maintenance dose of warfarin can fluctuate significantly depending on the amount of vitamin K1 in the diet . Keeping vitamin K1 intake at a stable level can prevent these fluctuations . Leafy green vegetables tend to contain higher amounts of vitamin K1 . Green parts of members of the family Apiaceae , such as parsley , cilantro , and dill , are extremely rich sources of vitamin K ; cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and broccoli , as well as the darker varieties of lettuces and other leafy greens , are also relatively high in vitamin K1 . Green vegetables such a peas and green beans do not have such high amounts of vitamin K1 as leafy greens . Certain vegetable oils have high amounts of vitamin K1 . Foods low in vitamin K1 include roots , bulbs , tubers , and most fruits and fruit juices . Cereals , grains and other milled products are also low in vitamin K1 . 
 = = = = Self @-@ testing = = = = 
 Patients are making increasing use of self @-@ testing and home monitoring of oral anticoagulation . International guidelines on home testing were published in 2005 . The guidelines stated : " The consensus agrees that patient self @-@ testing and patient self @-@ management are effective methods of monitoring oral anticoagulation therapy , providing outcomes at least as good as , and possibly better than , those achieved with an anticoagulation clinic . All patients must be appropriately selected and trained . Currently available self @-@ testing / self @-@ management devices give INR results that are comparable with those obtained in laboratory testing . " A 2006 systematic review and meta @-@ analysis of 14 randomized trials showed home testing led to a reduced incidence of complications ( thrombosis and major bleeding ) and improved the time in the therapeutic range . 
 = = Contraindications = = 
 Warfarin is contraindicated in pregnancy , as it passes through the placental barrier and may cause bleeding in the fetus ; warfarin use during pregnancy is commonly associated with spontaneous abortion , stillbirth , neonatal death , and preterm birth . <unk> ( such as warfarin ) are also teratogens , that is , they cause birth defects ; the incidence of birth defects in infants exposed to warfarin in utero appears to be around 5 % , although higher figures ( up to 30 % ) have been reported in some studies . Depending on when exposure occurs during pregnancy , two distinct combinations of congenital abnormalities can arise . 
 = = = First trimester of pregnancy = = = 
 Usually , warfarin is avoided in the first trimester , and a low molecular weight heparin such as enoxaparin is substituted . With heparin , risk of maternal haemorrhage and other complications are still increased , but <unk> do not cross the placental barrier , so do not cause birth defects . Various solutions exist for the time around delivery . 
 When warfarin ( or another 4 @-@ hydroxycoumarin derivative ) is given during the first trimester — particularly between the sixth and ninth weeks of pregnancy — a constellation of birth defects known variously as fetal warfarin syndrome ( FWS ) , warfarin <unk> , or coumarin <unk> can occur . FWS is characterized mainly by skeletal abnormalities , which include nasal hypoplasia , a depressed or narrowed nasal bridge , scoliosis , and calcifications in the vertebral column , femur , and heel bone , which show a peculiar stippled appearance on X @-@ rays . Limb abnormalities , such as brachydactyly ( unusually short fingers and toes ) or underdeveloped extremities , can also occur . Common <unk> features of FWS include low birth weight and developmental disabilities . 
 = = = Second trimester and later = = = 
 Warfarin administration in the second and third trimesters is much less commonly associated with birth defects , and when they do occur , are considerably different from fetal warfarin syndrome . The most common congenital abnormalities associated with warfarin use in late pregnancy are central nervous system disorders , including spasticity and seizures , and eye defects . Because of such later pregnancy birth defects , anticoagulation with warfarin poses a problem in pregnant women requiring warfarin for vital indications , such as stroke prevention in those with artificial heart valves . 
 According to the American College of Chest Physicians ( ACCP ) , warfarin may be used in lactating women who wish to breast @-@ feed their infants . Available data does not suggest that warfarin crosses into the breast milk . Similarly , INR levels should be checked to avoid adverse effects . 
 = = Adverse effects = = 
 = = = Hemorrhage = = = 
 The only common side effect of warfarin is hemorrhage ( bleeding ) . The risk of severe bleeding is small but definite ( a median annual rate of 1 @-@ 3 % has been reported ) and any benefit needs to outweigh this risk when warfarin is considered as a therapeutic measure . All types of bleeding occur more commonly , but the most catastrophic ones are those involving the brain ( intracerebral hemorrhage / hemorrhagic stroke ) and the spinal cord . Risk of bleeding is increased if the INR is out of range ( due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions ) . This risk increases greatly once the INR exceeds 4 @.@ 5 . 
 A number of risk scores exists to predict bleeding in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants . A commonly used score ( HAS @-@ <unk> ) includes known predictors of warfarin @-@ related bleeding : uncontrolled high blood pressure ( H ) , abnormal kidney function ( A ) , previous stroke ( S ) , known previous bleeding condition ( B ) , previous labile INR when on anticoagulation ( L ) , elderly as defined by age over 65 ( E ) , and drugs associated with bleeding ( e.g. aspirin ) or alcohol misuse ( D ) . While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines , they are only moderately effective in predicting bleeding risk and do not perform well in predicting hemorrhagic stroke . Bleeding risk may be increased in patients on hemodialysis . Another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation , specifically Warfarin or Coumadin , is the <unk> score , which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification . 
 The risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel , aspirin , or nonsteroidal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs . 
 = = = Warfarin necrosis = = = 
 A rare but serious complication resulting from treatment with warfarin is warfarin necrosis , which occurs more frequently shortly after commencing treatment in patients with a deficiency of protein C. Protein C is an innate anticoagulant that , like the procoagulant factors that warfarin inhibits , requires vitamin K @-@ dependent carboxylation for its activity . Since warfarin initially decreases protein C levels faster than the coagulation factors , it can paradoxically increase the blood 's tendency to coagulate when treatment is first begun ( many patients when starting on warfarin are given heparin in parallel to combat this ) , leading to massive thrombosis with skin necrosis and gangrene of limbs . Its natural counterpart , purpura fulminans , occurs in children who are homozygous for certain protein C mutations . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 After initial reports that warfarin could reduce bone mineral density , several studies have demonstrated a link between warfarin use and osteoporosis @-@ related fracture . A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep venous thrombosis , risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased ; other fracture types did not occur more commonly . A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1523 patients with <unk> fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls , and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture . 
 A 2006 retrospective study of 14 @,@ 564 Medicare recipients showed that warfarin use for more than one year was linked with a 60 % increased risk of osteoporosis @-@ related fracture in men ; there was no association in women . The mechanism was thought to be a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K , which is necessary for bone health , and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K @-@ mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins , rendering them nonfunctional . 
 = = = Purple toe syndrome = = = 
 Another rare complication that may occur early during warfarin treatment ( usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement ) is purple toe syndrome . This condition is thought to result from small deposits of cholesterol breaking loose and causing embolisms in blood vessels in the skin of the feet , which causes a blueish purple colour and may be painful . 
 It is typically thought to affect the big toe , but it affects other parts of the feet as well , including the bottom of the foot ( plantar surface ) . The occurrence of purple toe syndrome may require discontinuation of warfarin . 
 = = = <unk> of valves and arteries = = = 
 Several studies have also implicated warfarin use in valvular and vascular calcification . No specific treatment is available , but some modalities are under investigation . 
 = = Overdose = = 
 The major side effect of warfarin use is bleeding . Risk of bleeding is increased if the INR is out of range ( due to accidental or deliberate overdose or due to interactions ) . Many drug interactions can increase the effect of warfarin , also causing an overdose . 
 For people who need rapid reversal of warfarin and have serious bleeding or who are having emergency surgery , the effects of warfarin can be reversed with vitamin K with prothrombin complex concentrate or fresh frozen plasma in addition to intravenous vitamin K. Blood products should not be routinely used to reverse warfarin when vitamin K could work alone . 
 Details on reversing warfarin are provided in clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians . For patients with an international normalized ratio ( INR ) between 4 @.@ 5 and 10 @.@ 0 , a small dose ( about 1000 mcg = one milligram ) of oral vitamin K is sufficient . When warfarin is being given and INR is in therapeutic range , simple discontinuation of the drug for five days is usually enough to reverse the effect and cause INR to drop below 1 @.@ 5 . 
 = = Interactions = = 
 Warfarin interacts with many commonly used drugs , and the metabolism of warfarin varies greatly between patients . Some foods have also been reported to interact with warfarin . Apart from the metabolic interactions , highly protein bound drugs can displace warfarin from serum albumin and cause an increase in the INR . This makes finding the correct dosage difficult , and accentuates the need of monitoring ; when initiating a medication that is known to interact with warfarin ( e.g. simvastatin ) , INR checks are increased or dosages adjusted until a new ideal dosage is found . 
 When taken with NSAIDS ( non @-@ steroidal anti @-@ inflammatory medications ) , warfarin increases the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding . This increased risk is due to the anti @-@ platelet effect of NSAIDS as well as the possible damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa . 
 Many commonly used antibiotics , such as metronidazole or the macrolides , will greatly increase the effect of warfarin by reducing the metabolism of warfarin in the body . Other broad @-@ spectrum antibiotics can reduce the amount of the normal bacterial flora in the bowel , which make significant quantities of vitamin K1 , thus <unk> the effect of warfarin . In addition , food that contains large quantities of vitamin K1 will reduce the warfarin effect . Thyroid activity also appears to influence warfarin dosing requirements ; hypothyroidism ( decreased thyroid function ) makes people less responsive to warfarin treatment , while hyperthyroidism ( overactive thyroid ) boosts the anticoagulant effect . Several mechanisms have been proposed for this effect , including changes in the rate of breakdown of clotting factors and changes in the metabolism of warfarin . 
 Excessive use of alcohol is also known to affect the metabolism of warfarin and can elevate the INR and thus increase the risk of bleeding . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) product insert on warfarin states that alcohol should be avoided . 
 Warfarin also interacts with many herbs and spices , some used in food ( such as ginger and garlic ) and others used purely for medicinal purposes ( such as ginseng and Ginkgo biloba ) . All may increase bleeding and bruising in people taking warfarin ; similar effects have been reported with <unk> ( <unk> ) oil or fish oils . St. John 's Wort , sometimes recommended to help with mild to moderate depression , reduces the effectiveness of a given dose of warfarin ; it induces the enzymes that break down warfarin in the body , causing a reduced anticoagulant effect . 
 Between 2003 and 2004 , the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines received several reports of increased INR and risk of haemorrhage in people taking warfarin and cranberry juice . Data establishing a causal relationship is still lacking , and a 2006 review found no cases of this interaction reported to the FDA ; nevertheless , several authors have recommended that both doctors and patients be made aware of its possibility . The mechanism behind the interaction is still unclear . 
 = = Chemistry = = 
 X @-@ ray crystallographic studies of warfarin show that it exists in <unk> form , as the cyclic <unk> , which is formed from the 4 @-@ hydroxycoumarin and the ketone in the 3 @-@ position substituent . However , the existence of many 4 @-@ <unk> anticoagulants ( for example phenprocoumon ) that possess no ketone group in the 3 @-@ substituent to form such a structure , suggests that the <unk> must <unk> to the 4 @-@ hydroxy form in order for warfarin to be active . 
 = = Pharmacology = = 
 = = = Pharmacokinetics = = = 
 Warfarin consists of a racemic mixture of two active enantiomers — <unk> and S- forms — each of which is cleared by different pathways . S @-@ warfarin is 2 @-@ 5 times more potent than the R @-@ isomer in producing an anticoagulant response . Both the enantiomers of warfarin undergo CYP @-@ mediated metabolism by many different <unk> to form 3 ' , 4 ' , 6 @,@ 7 @,@ 8 and 10 @-@ hydroxy warfarin metabolites , major being 7 @-@ OH warfarin formed from S @-@ warfarin by CYP2C9 and 10 @-@ OH warfarin from R @-@ warfarin by CYP3A4 . 
 Warfarin is more slowly acting than the common anticoagulant heparin , though it has a number of advantages . Heparin must be given by injection , whereas warfarin is available orally . Warfarin has a long half @-@ life and need only be given once a day . Heparin can also cause a prothrombotic condition , heparin @-@ induced thrombocytopenia ( an antibody @-@ mediated decrease in platelet levels ) , which increases the risk for thrombosis . It takes several days for warfarin to reach the therapeutic effect since the circulating coagulation factors are not affected by the drug ( thrombin has a half @-@ life time of days ) . Warfarin 's long half @-@ life means that it remains effective for several days after it was stopped . Furthermore , if given initially without additional anticoagulant cover , it can increase thrombosis risk ( see below ) . For these main reasons , hospitalised patients are usually given heparin with warfarin initially , the heparin covering the 3 – 5 day lag period and being withdrawn after a few days . 
 = = = Mechanism of action = = = 
 While warfarin is one of several drugs popularly referred to as a " blood thinner ; " this is a misnomer since it does not affect the viscosity of blood . 
 Warfarin inhibits the vitamin K @-@ dependent synthesis of biologically active forms of the calcium @-@ dependent clotting factors II , VII , IX and X , as well as the regulatory factors protein C , protein S , and protein Z. Other proteins not involved in blood clotting , such as <unk> , or matrix Gla protein , may also be affected . 
 The precursors of these factors require gamma carboxylation of their glutamic acid residues to allow the coagulation factors to bind to phospholipid surfaces inside blood vessels , on the vascular endothelium . The enzyme that carries out the carboxylation of glutamic acid is gamma @-@ glutamyl carboxylase . The carboxylation reaction will proceed only if the carboxylase enzyme is able to convert a reduced form of vitamin K ( vitamin K hydroquinone ) to vitamin K epoxide at the same time . The vitamin K epoxide is in turn recycled back to vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone by another enzyme , the vitamin K epoxide reductase ( <unk> ) . Warfarin inhibits epoxide reductase ( specifically the VKORC1 subunit ) , thereby diminishing available vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in the tissues , which inhibits the carboxylation activity of the glutamyl carboxylase . When this occurs , the coagulation factors are no longer <unk> at certain glutamic acid residues , and are incapable of binding to the endothelial surface of blood vessels , and are thus biologically inactive . As the body 's stores of previously produced active factors degrade ( over several days ) and are replaced by inactive factors , the anticoagulation effect becomes apparent . The coagulation factors are produced , but have decreased functionality due to <unk> ; they are collectively referred to as <unk> ( proteins induced [ by ] vitamin K absence / antagonism ) , and individual coagulation factors as <unk> @-@ number ( <unk> @-@ II ) . The end result of warfarin use , therefore , is to diminish blood clotting in the patient . 
 When warfarin is newly started , it may promote clot formation temporarily . This is because the level of protein C and protein S are also dependent on vitamin K activity . Warfarin causes decline in protein C levels in first 36 hours . In addition , reduced levels of protein S lead to a reduction in activity of protein C ( for which it is the co @-@ factor ) and therefore reduced degradation of factor Va and factor VIIIa . Although loading doses of warfarin over 5 mg also produce a precipitous decline in factor VII , resulting in an initial prolongation of the INR , full <unk> effect does not take place until significant reduction in factor II occurs days later . The <unk> system becomes temporarily biased towards thrombus formation , leading to a prothrombotic state . Thus , when warfarin is loaded rapidly at greater than 5 mg per day , it is beneficial to co @-@ administer heparin , an anticoagulant that acts upon antithrombin and helps reduce the risk of thrombosis , with warfarin therapy for four to five days , in order to have the benefit of anticoagulation from heparin until the full effect of warfarin has been achieved . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Warfarin activity is determined partially by genetic factors . Polymorphisms in two genes ( VKORC1 and CYP2C9 ) play a particularly large role in response to warfarin . 
 VKORC1 polymorphisms explain 30 % of the dose variation between patients : particular mutations make VKORC1 less susceptible to suppression by warfarin . There are two main haplotypes that explain 25 % of variation : low @-@ dose haplotype group ( A ) and a high @-@ dose haplotype group ( B ) . VKORC1 polymorphisms explain why African Americans are on average relatively resistant to warfarin ( higher proportion of group B haplotypes ) , while Asian Americans are generally more sensitive ( higher proportion of group A haplotypes ) . Group A VKORC1 polymorphisms lead to a more rapid achievement of a therapeutic INR , but also a shorter time to reach an INR over 4 , which is associated with bleeding . 
 CYP2C9 polymorphisms explain 10 % of the dose variation between patients , mainly among Caucasian patients as these variants are rare in African American and most Asian populations . These CYP2C9 polymorphisms do not influence time to effective INR as opposed <unk> , but does shorten the time to INR > 4 . 
 Despite the promise of <unk> testing in warfarin dosing , its use in clinical practice is controversial . In August 2009 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services concluded that " the available evidence does not demonstrate that <unk> testing of CYP2C9 or VKORC1 alleles to predict warfarin responsiveness improves health outcomes in Medicare beneficiaries . " A 2014 meta @-@ analysis showed that using genotype @-@ based dosing did not confer benefit in terms of time within therapeutic range , excessive anticoagulation ( as defined by INR greater than 4 ) , or a reduction in either major bleeding or <unk> events . 
 = = History = = 
 In the early 1920s , there was an outbreak of a previously unrecognized cattle disease in the northern United States and Canada . Cattle were haemorrhaging after minor procedures , and on some occasions , spontaneously . For example , 21 out of 22 cows died after <unk> , and 12 out of 25 bulls died after castration . All of these animals had bled to death . 
 In 1921 , Frank Schofield , a Canadian veterinary pathologist , determined that the cattle were ingesting moldy silage made from sweet clover , and that this was functioning as a potent anticoagulant . Only spoiled hay made from sweet clover ( grown in northern states of the USA and in Canada since the turn of the century ) produced the disease . Schofield separated good clover stalks and damaged clover stalks from the same hay mow , and fed each to a different rabbit . The rabbit that had ingested the good stalks remained well , but the rabbit that had ingested the damaged stalks died from a haemorrhagic illness . A duplicate experiment with a different sample of clover hay produced the same result . In 1929 , North Dakota veterinarian Dr L.M. Roderick demonstrated that the condition was due to a lack of functioning prothrombin . 
 The identity of the anticoagulant substance in spoiled sweet clover remained a mystery until 1940 . In 1933 Karl Paul Link and his lab of chemists working at the University of Wisconsin set out to isolate and characterize the haemorrhagic agent from the spoiled hay . It took five years for Link 's student Harold A. Campbell to recover 6 mg of crystalline anticoagulant . Next , Link 's student Mark A. <unk> took over the project and initiated a large @-@ scale extraction , isolating 1 @.@ 8 g of recrystallized anticoagulant in about 4 months . This was enough material for <unk> and Charles F. Huebner to check their results against Campbell 's and to thoroughly characterize the compound . Through degradation experiments they established that the anticoagulant was 3 @,@ 3 ' <unk> ( 4 @-@ hydroxycoumarin ) , which they later named dicoumarol . They confirmed their results by synthesizing dicoumarol and proving in 1940 that it was identical to the naturally occurring agent . 
 <unk> was a product of the plant molecule coumarin ( not to be confused with Coumadin , a later tradename for warfarin ) . <unk> is now known to be present in many plants , and produces the notably sweet smell of freshly cut grass or hay and plants like sweet grass ; in fact , the plant 's high content of coumarin is responsible for the original common name of " sweet clover " , which is named for its sweet smell , not its bitter taste . They are present notably in <unk> ( Galium odoratum , Rubiaceae ) , and at lower levels in licorice , lavender , and various other species . However , coumarins themselves do not influence clotting or warfarin @-@ like action , but must first be metabolized by various fungi into compounds such as 4 @-@ hydroxycoumarin , then further ( in the presence of naturally occurring formaldehyde ) into dicoumarol , in order to have any anticoagulant properties . Fungal attack of the damaged and dying clover stalks explained the presence of the anticoagulant only in spoiled clover <unk> ; dicoumarol is considered to be a fermentation product and mycotoxin . 
 Over the next few years , numerous similar chemicals ( specifically 4 @-@ <unk> with a large aromatic <unk> at the 3 position ) were found to have the same anticoagulant properties . The first drug in the class to be widely commercialized was dicoumarol itself , patented in 1941 and later used as a pharmaceutical . Karl Link continued working on developing more potent coumarin @-@ based anticoagulants for use as rodent poisons , resulting in warfarin in 1948 . The name " warfarin " stems from the acronym <unk> , for Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation + the ending <unk> indicating its link with coumarin . Warfarin was first registered for use as a rodenticide in the US in 1948 , and was immediately popular . Although warfarin was developed by Link , the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation financially supported the research and was assigned the patent . 
 After an incident in 1951 , where a US Army inductee unsuccessfully attempted suicide with multiple doses of warfarin in rodenticide and recovered fully after presenting to a hospital , and being treated with vitamin K ( by then known as a specific antidote ) , studies began in the use of warfarin as a therapeutic anticoagulant . It was found to be generally superior to dicoumarol , and in 1954 was approved for medical use in humans . An early recipient of warfarin was US president Dwight Eisenhower , who was prescribed the drug after having a heart attack in 1955 . 
 The exact mechanism of action remained unknown until it was demonstrated , in 1978 , that warfarin inhibits the enzyme epoxide reductase and hence interferes with vitamin K metabolism . 
 It has been posited that Lavrenty Beria , Nikita Khrushchev and others conspired to use warfarin to poison Soviet leader Joseph Stalin . Warfarin is tasteless and colourless , and produces symptoms similar to those that Stalin exhibited . 
 = = Use as a rodenticide = = 
 <unk> ( 4 @-@ hydroxycoumarin derivatives ) are used as rodenticides for controlling rats and mice in residential , industrial , and agricultural areas . Warfarin is both odorless and tasteless , and is effective when mixed with food bait , because the rodents will return to the bait and continue to feed over a period of days until a lethal dose is accumulated ( considered to be 1 mg / kg / day over about six days ) . It may also be mixed with talc and used as a tracking powder , which accumulates on the animal 's skin and fur , and is subsequently consumed during grooming . The LD50 is 50 – 500 mg / kg . The IDLH value is 100 mg / m3 ( warfarin ; various species ) . 
 The use of warfarin itself as a rat poison is now declining , because many rat populations have developed resistance to it , and poisons of considerably greater potency are now available . Other 4 @-@ <unk> used as rodenticides include <unk> and brodifacoum , which is sometimes referred to as " super @-@ warfarin " , because it is more potent , longer @-@ acting , and effective even in rat and mouse populations that are resistant to warfarin . Unlike warfarin , which is readily excreted , newer anticoagulant poisons also accumulate in the liver and kidneys after ingestion . However , such rodenticides may also accumulate in birds of prey and other animals that eat the poisoned rodents or baits .

 = Action of 23 August 1967 = 
 The Action of 23 August 1967 was a major air battle which involved elements of the Vietnam People 's Air Force ( VPAF ) and the United States Air Force ( USAF ) . The air battle took place over the skies of North Vietnam as part of Operation Rolling Thunder , during the Vietnam War . 
 On 2 January 1967 , the United States Air Force launched Operation Bolo with the aim of luring North Vietnamese MiG fighters into an air battle , where they could be destroyed in an ambush . The operation , led by Colonel Robin Olds , turned out to be a major success after five North Vietnamese MiG @-@ 21 fighters of the VPAF 921st Fighter Regiment were shot down . 
 Stung by that devastating defeat , the North Vietnamese Air Force grounded their fighter force several times between June and August 1967 , in order to work on their training and tactics . On 23 August 1967 , the North Vietnamese Air Force employed their newly devised tactic against a U.S. strike formation , while it was conducting raids against a rail yard . The air battle concluded with the USAF losing three F @-@ 4D fighters . 
 = = Background = = 
 On 2 March 1965 , the United States Government launched Operation Rolling Thunder , a major bombing campaign , with several objectives . Firstly , the operation was supposed to retaliate against North Vietnam for their military activities inside South Vietnam , thereby raising the morale of the South Vietnamese people , especially the Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) . Secondly , it aimed to impede North Vietnam ’ s ability to wage war by reducing , if not stopping , the flow of men and material into South Vietnam . Thirdly , the overall objective was to persuade the North Vietnamese Government to find a compromise through negotiations . Originally the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff submitted a list of 94 targets to be hit over a period of 16 days , but U.S. President Lyndon Johnson decided to include military targets in order to gradually apply pressure on the North Vietnamese Government , so the list of targets grew to 427 by the end of the campaign . In the first phase of the operation , which lasted from spring to summer of 1965 , American airpower mainly targeted the North Vietnamese capital of Hanoi and its limited industrial base . 
 However , by the end of the year , the United States had failed to achieve the objectives of Rolling Thunder , because North Vietnam continued to send its troops and military supplies down the Ho Chi Minh Trail , which demonstrated that the North Vietnamese Government was not ready to quit the war . In response to domestic political pressure to do more , President Johnson shifted priority of the campaign to interdiction . From summer 1965 to the winter period of 1966 – 67 , the campaign was aimed at degrading North Vietnam ’ s capability to infiltrate and send men into South Vietnam . Again , America ’ s shift towards interdiction also failed , and the Johnson administration was forced to change the priority of the bombing campaign . For the third phase of Rolling Thunder , which occurred from spring 1967 to early 1968 , bombing operations were focused on industrial and transportation targets in and around Hanoi , Hai Phong and the buffer zone near the Chinese border . 
 The third phase of the campaign was heavily favored by U.S. commanders , because it allowed them to destroy rather than just threaten Hanoi ’ s nascent industrial infrastructures . Furthermore , the new targets approved by the Johnson administration enabled U.S. airpower to be used against the primary war @-@ making capabilities of North Vietnam , by striking at military targets that were previously denied to the fighter @-@ bombers of the U.S. Navy and Air Force . Thus , in 1967 the United States also introduced more aircraft into the operation equipped with new technology , which gave American air units the assets to make a significant difference . However , as American bombers moved closer to Hanoi and Hai Phong , they were aggressively challenged by North Vietnamese MiG fighters . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 The year of 1967 started badly for the Vietnam People 's Air Force ( VPAF ) . During the early years of the war , the rules of engagement prevented U.S. fighter @-@ bombers from hitting North Vietnamese air bases , and that allowed North Vietnamese fighter pilots to attack American bomber formations as they were approaching their targets , thereby forcing U.S. pilots to jettison their bomb loads before they even reached their target . Then , instead of dueling with U.S. strike aircraft , North Vietnamese pilots would normally retreat to the safety of their bases . To preempt further attacks on U.S. bomber formations by the North Vietnamese Air Force , the United States Air Force became interested in luring North Vietnamese MiG fighters up against a decoy target , and shoot them down in the air using missile @-@ armed fighter aircraft . By 1967 , the North Vietnamese Air Force had become more aggressive towards U.S. strike formations , and it indicated to U.S. commanders that it was the right time to launch a decoy operation . 
 In what became known as Operation Bolo , the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing ( 8th TFW ) — under the command of Colonel Robin Olds — based at Ubon in Thailand , was entrusted with the task of leading an operation which aimed to lure the North Vietnamese Air Force into an ambush . Accordingly , the F @-@ 4 Phantoms of the 8th TFW would fly in the same profile as an F @-@ 105 strike formation , by flying at the same time , altitudes , speed and routes . For the first time , the F @-@ 4 Phantoms would be equipped with the QRC @-@ 160 jamming pods so they would appear on North Vietnamese radars as F @-@ 105 bombers . To prepare for the operation , U.S. aircrews spent several days studying weapons envelopes , pod operation , and all aspects of air @-@ to @-@ air tactics . On 2 January 1967 , a total of 56 F @-@ 4C Phantom II from the 8th and 366th Tactical Fighter Wings flew in a formation which resembled an F @-@ 105 strike force , towards the VPAF ’ s Phuc Yen Air Base . There were four flights of F @-@ 104 fighters flying in escort , to simulate the F @-@ 4s . 
 When the U.S. fighter formations were detected by North Vietnamese radar , MiG @-@ 21 fighters of the VPAF 921st Fighter Regiment based at Phúc Yên Air Base and Kép Air Base were immediately placed on category one red alert , which was the highest state of alert . However , unknown to the U.S. pilots at the time , the VPAF High Command forbade their pilots from taking off until U.S. fighters were 40 kilometers ( 25 mi ) away from Noi Bai . Apart from the late reaction of the VPAF High Command , weather conditions over North Vietnam also favored U.S. aircrews ; North Vietnamese bases at Noi Bai and Kep were covered by 10 / 10th cloud , which started at a height of 1 @,@ 500 meters ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) and cleared at 3 @,@ 000 meters ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) . By the time the first wave of North Vietnamese MiG fighters had taken off , two additional flights of F @-@ 4C fighters from the 8th TFW had already flown into the area undetected . Due to their lack of radar equipment , North Vietnamese MiG @-@ 17 fighters were restricted to flying at cloud base , so they failed to detect the presence of U.S. fighters that were flying at a higher altitude . 
 From above 10 @,@ 000 meters ( 33 @,@ 000 ft ) U.S. F @-@ 4 fighters had a greater energy level over North Vietnamese MiG @-@ 17 and MiG @-@ 21 fighters , and U.S. pilots had no trouble seeing or identifying North Vietnamese fighters flying up from below . Furthermore , weather conditions on the day allowed radar and missile systems on the F @-@ 4 fighters to perform at their maximum level , an advantage which U.S. pilots fully exploited as North Vietnamese MiG fighters flew up to engage them . Just after 3 : 00 pm North Vietnamese MiG @-@ 21 fighters appeared through the clouds and began attacking U.S. fighters circling above . One by one the MiG @-@ 21 fighters were picked off by AIM @-@ 7 and AIM @-@ 9 missiles launched by U.S. pilots . The USAF suffered no losses and they claimed to have shot down seven MiG @-@ 21 fighters , but only five were confirmed by the North Vietnamese . All North Vietnamese pilots who were hit ejected safely , while the survivors managed to return to the safety of their home bases . 
 = = Engagement = = 
 On 8 January 1967 , the VPAF High Command convened a meeting to examine what had gone wrong . The actions of 2 January had exposed the flawed tactics employed by MiG @-@ 21 pilots ; they broke through the clouds too quickly , and they did not join up with each other before they attacked the U.S. fighters waiting above them . The VPAF High Command then devised a new tactic which required the deployment of between two or four aircraft for each attack , with a maximum of ten aircraft for each mission to perform guerrilla @-@ style attacks on U.S. bomber formations . Furthermore , after they had examined U.S. air tactics , North Vietnamese commanders decided that MiG @-@ 17 pilots should attack U.S. formations from either side , while MiG @-@ 21 pilots would strike from above . Before the North Vietnamese Air Force could implement their new tactics , however , the VPAF 921st Fighter Regiment was withdrawn from combat for several months to recover from the bloody defeat it had suffered as a result of Operation Bolo . 
 In April , North Vietnamese MiG fighters were back in the air to challenge U.S. Navy and Air Force fighter @-@ bombers again , but they only experienced mixed results with heavy losses . As a result , between late June and early August 1967 , North Vietnamese Air Force fighters were grounded several times , so their pilots could work on their training and new tactics . While the North Vietnamese pilots were undergoing training , American airpower was concentrated on striking at Hanoi ’ s line of communications , especially the rail lines running north @-@ east and north @-@ west into China , and the transportation network which linked North Vietnam ’ s capital with Hai Phong . To minimize the effects of U.S. strikes , North Vietnamese authorities constructed several alternate rail yards on the north @-@ eastern train line , including the Yen Vien rail yard which located 58 kilometers ( 36 mi ) north of Hanoi and ran through Thai Nguyen , and linked up with the main line at Kep close to China . 
 In response , the Seventh Air Force launched repeated strikes on the Yen Vien rail yard and other infrastructures which linked Hanoi with the China buffer zone . On 21 August 1967 , a formation of twenty F @-@ 105 Thunderchiefs and eight F @-@ 4 Phantoms raided Yen Vien , which contained about 150 boxcars . The Americans claimed to have damaged more than half of the boxcars and trapped the remainder in the rail yard , so they returned two days later to destroy the rest . On the afternoon of 23 August 1967 , a flight of sixteen F @-@ 4s from the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing escorted a formation of thirty @-@ six F @-@ 105 strike aircraft from the 355th and 388th Tactical Fighter Wings based in Thailand , for the second attack on Yen Vien . The 555th Tactical Fighter Squadron provided two flights of F @-@ 4 Phantoms , ‘ Ford ’ flight and ‘ Falcon ’ flight . The mission was led by Colonel Nicholas J. Donelson with Olds , who spearheaded Operation Bolo back in January , as the leader of the escort formation . At 1 : 45 pm on 23 August , North Vietnamese radars detected a flight of 40 U.S aircraft approaching Hanoi from Sam Neua , in neighboring Laos . 
 The VPAF High Command immediately scrambled two flights of four MiG @-@ 17 fighters from the VPAF <unk> Fighter Regiment , followed by two MiG @-@ 21 fighters from the VPAF 921st Fighter Regiment at 2 : 51 pm . The MiG @-@ 21 force was led by Nguyen Nhat Chieu with Nguyen Van Coc , who had participated in the VPAF 's disastrous mission during Operation Bolo , as the wingman . The first and second MiG @-@ 17 flights were commanded by Cao Thanh Tinh and Nguyen Van Tho respectively . Once airborne , North Vietnamese pilots maneuvered their aircraft into positions to deploy their new tactic which required the MiG @-@ 17 fighters to act as bait , while the MiG @-@ 21 fighters attacked from the rear . After Chieu and Coc had departed from Phuc Yen Air Base , they flew at low level and stayed in the ground clutter to avoid detection by airborne radars employed by U.S aircraft . However , the MiG @-@ 21 ’ s transponders were detected by an orbiting EC @-@ 121 airborne early warning radar surveillance aircraft , and their positions were relayed to the F @-@ 4 fighters that were escorting the strike formation , but they did not respond . 
 Initially the first MiG @-@ 17 flight fell behind the U.S. strike formation , so Tinh and his formation climbed with full afterburner and they immediately played their part in the attack , by attacking the F @-@ 105 formation with their cannons . Meanwhile , as North Vietnamese ground controllers saw their fighter aircraft abeam the strike flight and outside the radar range of the F @-@ 4 formation , they ordered the MiG @-@ 21 fighters to climb up to 8 @,@ 500 meters ( 27 @,@ 900 ft ) . Chieu and Coc then dived out from an overcast and swept down on ‘ Ford ’ flight and the strike formation ; Chieu fired a missile at an F @-@ 105 and Coc fired an R @-@ 3S Atoll missile which successfully destroyed ‘ Ford 4 ’ ( 66 @-@ 0238 , 8th TFW ) , piloted by Major Charles R. Tyler . Shortly afterwards , Chieu turned his aircraft around and fired a missile at another F @-@ 4 , but it missed . Coc also tried to score another kill , but he strayed into Chieu ’ s line of fire as the latter was diving down from above firing his 20mm cannon . 
 As a result , Coc ’ s MiG @-@ 21 was damaged but the controls were still working properly , so he requested to carry on with the mission . However , ground controllers ordered him to return to base , and the MiG @-@ 21 could only fly at a speed of 600 kilometers per hour ( 370 mph ) due to the damage . After the U.S. strike formation had fallen into the ambush , MiG @-@ 17 pilots radioed their control center and requested to continue with their air patrol . Over the skies of Yen Vien , ‘ Ford 1 ’ piloted by Captain Larry E. Carrigan ( 66 @-@ <unk> , 8th TFW ) was shot down by a MiG @-@ 17 fighter from Tho ’ s formation . Meanwhile , ‘ Falcon 3 ’ ( 65 @-@ <unk> , 8th TFW ) piloted by Major Robert R. <unk> was shot down by anti @-@ aircraft artillery . Against those losses , F @-@ 105 pilot First Lieutenant David B. Waldrop , ‘ Crossbow 3 ’ , claimed that he had destroyed one MiG @-@ 17 in the air battle . On the return trip , ‘ Ford 3 ’ piloted by Major C.B. <unk> ( 66 @-@ <unk> ) ran out of fuel as the aircraft tried to reach a tanker ; the pilot and his Weapons Systems Officer were forced to eject from the aircraft as it malfunctioned over Thailand . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The battle concluded as the worst day for the United States Air Force in Vietnam since 2 December 1966 , when they had lost five aircraft over the skies of North Vietnam in a single day . Consequently , the actions of 23 August became known as ‘ Black Wednesday ’ amongst U.S. pilots who participated in air operations over Hanoi on that particular day . The USAF officially confirmed the loss of three F @-@ 4D fighters during the raid against the Yen Vien rail yard , which resulted in the deaths of Weapon Systems Officers Captain Ronald N. <unk> ( 66 @-@ 0238 , 8th TFW ) and First Lieutenant Charles Lane ( 66 @-@ <unk> , 8th TFW ) . Major Charles R. Tyler , Captain Larry E. Carrigan , Major Robert R. <unk> and First Lieutenant Gerald L. <unk> ejected safely from their aircraft , but they were captured alive and became prisoners of war . Major C.B. <unk> and his Weapons System Officer , First Lieutenant J.M. Piet were rescued shortly after they ejected from their malfunctioned aircraft over Thai airspace . 
 In contrast to the misery suffered by their opponents , the action of 23 August gave the North Vietnamese Air Force their first major victory since Operation Bolo . The USAF ’ s confirmation of the loss of ‘ Ford 4 ’ to a MiG aircraft gave Nguyen Van Coc his second air @-@ to @-@ air victory , and he eventually became the leading ace pilot of the war with nine kills . Earlier in the engagement , flight leader Nguyen Nhat Chieu claimed to have destroyed an F @-@ 105 with a missile , but the USAF have not confirmed that claim . Nonetheless , Chieu also became a ranking ace pilot with six kills attributed to his name . The USAF also claimed one victory against a MiG @-@ 17 fighter , attributed to First Lieutenant David B. Waldrop , but the claim was not confirmed by the North Vietnamese because all their MiG fighters returned to base safely . 
 Following their defeat at the hands of the North Vietnamese Air Force , Colonel Robin Olds learned that Seventh Air Force intelligence had watched North Vietnamese MiG fighters practicing their new tactics for ten days prior to the battle of 23 August , but had not passed that information on to the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing and other units . Thus , it soon became clear to U.S commanders that the reason the North Vietnamese repeatedly stood down their fighter force was because they were working on their new tactic . In the first half of 1967 , the North Vietnamese had realized they could not directly confront U.S. fighters in air @-@ to @-@ air combat , so they changed their procedures for the deployment of their numerically inferior MiG units . To take advantage of the MiG @-@ 21 ’ s speed and small size , pilots flying the type were instructed to intercept targets only at high speed behind or above U.S. strike formations . 
 Then , as they approached their target , the MiG @-@ 21 pilots would make a supersonic diving pass against trailing or isolated flights , so they could position themselves for a missile kill . The action of 23 August demonstrated that the North Vietnamese Air Force had successfully executed their new procedure , which was helped by more skilful ground controllers who directed the MiG fighter towards their targets . Indeed , the new procedure gave North Vietnamese MiG pilots the ingredient they needed to achieve a kill over their U.S. opponents ; between August 1967 and February 1968 , the North Vietnamese Air Force achieved a kill ratio of 1 @.@ 1 : 1 against the USAF , with the loss of 20 aircraft for 22 victories . In the same period of time , Operation Rolling Thunder had cost the United States approximately $ 900 million ( $ 5 @,@ 640 million at 2010 prices ) with the loss of more than 700 aircraft . The bombing campaign continued until 31 October 1968 , when it was abandoned by the U.S. Government . 
 = Mise of Amiens = 
 The Mise of Amiens was a settlement given by King Louis IX of France on 23 January 1264 in the conflict between King Henry III of England and his rebellious barons , led by Simon de Montfort . Louis ' one @-@ sided decision for King Henry led directly to the hostilities of the Barons ' War . 
 The conflict between king and magnates was caused by dissatisfaction with the influence of foreigners at court , and Henry 's high level of taxation . In 1258 Henry was forced to accept the Provisions of Oxford , that essentially left royal government in the hands of a council of magnates , but this document went through a long series of revocations and reinstatements . In 1263 , as the country was on the brink of civil war , the two parties agreed to submit the matter to arbitration by the French king . Louis was a firm believer in the royal prerogative , and decided clearly in favour of Henry . 
 The outcome was unacceptable for the rebellious barons , and war between the two parties broke out almost immediately after the announcement of the settlement . After a victory at the Battle of Lewes in May 1264 , Montfort took over control of government , but the success was short @-@ lived . Henry 's oldest son Edward – the later King Edward I – started a military campaign that ended in the Battle of Evesham in August 1265 , where Montfort was defeated and killed . Parts of the baronial resistance still held out , but by the end of 1266 the final garrison at Kenilworth Castle surrendered . The rebels were given pardons according to terms set out in the Dictum of Kenilworth . 
 = = Background = = 
 By 1264 , the reign of Henry III was deeply troubled by disputes between the king and his nobility . The conflict was caused by several factors . One source of discontent was the influence two groups of royal favourites enjoyed at court : the Savoyards , relatives of Queen Eleanor of Provence , and the king 's half @-@ brothers , known as Poitevins or Lusignans . The native nobility were offended by the great political influence held by these foreigners . Secondly , the king had in 1254 accepted Pope Innocent IV 's offer of the crown of Sicily for his younger son Edmund . The offer involved repelling the current Hohenstaufen rulers of the island , and proved to be very expensive . Lastly , there was a personal dispute between King Henry and one of his subjects , Simon de Montfort , Earl of Leicester . Montfort , a foreigner himself , was initially on good terms with Henry , and had in 1238 married the king 's sister Eleanor . The two fell out , however , and Montfort became the leader of the opposition , together with Richard de Clare , Earl of Gloucester . In 1258 , Henry was forced to accept the so @-@ called Provisions of Oxford , whereby he effectively surrendered control of royal government to a council of magnates . In 1259 the baronial program of reform was further elaborated upon in the Provisions of Westminster . 
 The provisions remained in effect for three years ; at one point Henry 's oldest son Edward – the later King Edward I – even joined forces with Montfort . It was not until 1261 that Henry was able to move against the opposition . Receiving a papal annulment of the provisions , he reassumed control of government . Over the next two years , however , Henry 's governing deteriorated the situation once more . He failed to reconcile with Montfort , and alienated Gloucester 's son and heir Gilbert . In April 1263 Montfort returned to England after a long stay in France , and reignited the reform movement . On 16 July Henry was surrounded by rebel forces in the Tower of London , and once more forced to accept the conditions of the provisions . Prince Edward , now firmly on the side of his father against Montfort , now took control of the situation . In October Edward took Windsor Castle , and the baronial alliance started to break up . Cornered , Montfort had to accept a truce and agree to submit the issue to arbitration by the French king Louis IX . 
 = = Arguments and settlement = = 
 On 28 December 1263 Henry left for France to present his case to King Louis . Montfort was prevented from attending by an accident , and he was represented by Peter de Montfort and others . Henry had already tried once before , in September , to appeal to the French king . That time Louis had been sympathetic to Henry 's cause , but decided in favour of maintaining the provisions . At Amiens Henry argued that his right to appoint his own ministers and officials had been denied him , in violation of the royal prerogative . He also accused his opponents of destroying royal castles and laying waste to royal lands . For his injuries he demanded a compensation of the barons of £ 300 @,@ 000 and 200 @,@ 000 marks . Referring to the papal writ of annulment , Henry asked the French king to free him from observing the provisions forced upon him by the barons . 
 Two documents survive of the barons ' complaints . In the first of these , the barons reiterated the background of the conflict , and stressed the fact that the king himself had accepted the conditions of the provisions . Henry had in fact , in an effort to gain public support , pledged to uphold the provisions , a fact that was now made the most of . The document further goes on to explain the reform instituted by the baronial council . In order to restore law and peacekeeping to the country , the council had installed a new Chief Justiciar and Chancellor . They had also appointed new sheriffs in the counties , who were to be directly accountable to the government and be replaced annually . The king had violated these conditions , it was argued , when he had appointed his own chancellor and a number of sheriffs . He had also taken over custody of Winchester Castle , which had been given over to Montfort by the provisions . Furthermore , there were accusation made against individual royal adherents , such as Roger Mortimer for his military raids in the Welsh Marches . The second document goes into more detail on the king 's alleged transgressions . By extortionate taxation , it was claimed , Henry had impoverished the land . He had also infringed the liberties of the Church , violated Magna Carta , and corrupted justice . 
 When Louis IX made his decision on 23 January 1264 , it was entirely in favour of Henry III . The settlement starts out by reiterating the declarations of the two parties , where they place the decision fully in the hands of the French king . Louis invoked the difficulties England had suffered over the previous years , and stressed the importance of a resolution . Since the pope had already invalidated the provisions , Louis decided to " ... quash and invalidate all these provisions , ordinances , and obligations , or whatever else they may be called ... " , and absolved the king from any adherence to them . Castles that were handed over to the barons as part of the agreement were to be given back to the king , and Henry should be free to appoint his own ministers . The only concession made to the barons was a general pardon extended to those involved in the conflict . The financial demands of King Henry were not mentioned . Louis was a firm believer in the royal prerogative , and was never likely to embrace the precedents set by the barons ' infringement of Henry 's authority . There was also the papal annulment to take into account , which the deeply pious Louis was not going to ignore . At the same time , Henry 's wife Eleanor of Provence – who was Louis ' sister @-@ in @-@ law – had worked hard to procure a favourable decision for her husband . It was clear from the start though , that the French king had gone too far in his partisan decision , and that the settlement was little more than a dead letter . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The settlement did not present a solution to the conflict , but rather a recipe for further problems . The one @-@ sided decision for the king and against the barons left Montfort with little choice but armed rebellion . Hostilities started already in February , when Montfort 's sons , Henry and another Simon , attacked the possessions of Roger Mortimer in the Marches . Henry summoned the feudal army , and the royal forces won an important victory at Northampton , where the younger Simon was captured . Montfort was still in control of London , as Henry regained control over Kent and Sussex . Montfort marched out of London to negotiate , but the terms – involving maintaining the provisions – were rejected by the king . The only option remaining was to fight , and the two forces met at Lewes on 14 May 1264 . In spite of inferior numbers , the baronial forces led by Simon de Montfort won the battle . Edward , commanding the right wing , quickly defeated the London forces . When he set out in pursuit of the fleeing soldiers , however , he left the rest of the royal army open to attack by the baronial forces , who soon won the day . By the settlement called the Mise of Lewes , the provisions were reinstated and Edward was given over as hostage . 
 The government led by Montfort soon ran into problems . He negotiated a treaty with Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , the Prince of Wales , an act that made him unpopular with the English Marcher lords . In May Edward escaped captivity , with the help of Gilbert de Clare , Earl of Gloucester , who had now come over to the royal side . Edward started on a campaign of re @-@ conquest , while Montfort was forced to suppress a rebellion in the Marches . He succeeded only by making large concessions to Llewelyn , and then moved east to join forces with his son Simon . Edward , however , routed the younger Simon at Kenilworth Castle , and on 4 August 1265 Montfort found himself trapped at Evesham , forced to give battle with a much smaller army than the royals . The battle soon turned into a massacre ; Montfort himself was killed and mutilated on the field . Even with Montfort dead resistance remained , particularly at the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle . In October 1266 the Dictum of Kenilworth set down terms by which the rebels could obtain pardons , and by the end of the year the garrison surrendered . 
 = Prenton Park = 
 Prenton Park is an association football stadium in Birkenhead , England . It is the home ground of the non @-@ league Tranmere Rovers F.C. and Liverpool F.C. Reserves . The club moved to the current Prenton Park in 1912 . The ground has had several rebuilds , with the most recent occurring in 1995 in response to the requirement of the Taylor Report to become all @-@ seater . Today 's stadium holds 16 @,@ 567 in four stands : the Kop , the Johnny King Stand , the Main Stand and the Cowshed ( for away supporters ) . 
 Attendances at the ground have fluctuated over its hundred @-@ year history . Its largest @-@ ever crowd was 24 @,@ 424 for a 1972 FA Cup match between Tranmere and Stoke City . In 2010 , an average of 5 @,@ 000 fans attended each home game . 
 = = History = = 
 Tranmere Rovers F.C. were formed in 1884 ; they played their first matches at Steeles Field in Birkenhead but , in 1887 , they bought a new site from Tranmere Rugby Club . The ground was variously referred to as the " Borough Road Enclosure " , " Ravenshaw 's Field " and " South Road " . The name " Prenton Park " was adopted in 1895 as a result of a suggestion in the letters page of the Football Echo . Not strictly within Prenton , it is likely that the name was chosen as the area was regarded as more upmarket than nearby Tranmere . 
 Because the land was required for housing and a school , Tranmere were forced to move and the name went with them . The present Prenton Park was opened by the Mayor of Birkenhead , Councillor George Proudman , on 9 March 1912 . Their first match was played against Lancaster Town in the Lancashire Combination . There were stands ( also known as bleachers ) on both sides of the pitch , a paddock and three open terraces , the general format which remained until 1994 . 
 Floodlights were installed in the ground in September 1958 . The supporters ' association raised the £ 15 @,@ 000 cost of the new lights . When manager Dave Russell joined the club in 1961 , one of his many influential changes was to take advantage of the lights , playing regular home games on Friday nights rather than the usual Saturday afternoon . This allowed supporters to watch Tranmere on Fridays and First Division sides Everton or Liverpool on Saturdays . The idea was successful and continued until the 1990s . 
 Over the years , various upgrades and repairs have been made to the stadium . By 1968 , the old wooden Main Stand was in poor condition and in need of replacement . At a cost of £ 80 @,@ 000 , today 's Main Stand was erected and opened by Minister for Sport and former referee Denis Howell . In 1979 , the terracing on the Cowshed and Paddock was concreted . The Tranmere suite was added to the Main Stand in 1988 , with further bars and executive suites added soon after . 
 Many improvements to the ground were driven by changes in legislation . In 1985 , the Safety of Sports Grounds Act led to a reduction in capacity from 18 @,@ 000 to 8 @,@ 000 . The Kop End was closed , and the Main Stand capacity was reduced by 3 @,@ 000 , because there were insufficient access points . £ 50 @,@ 000 was spent on safety work to maintain a capacity of 8 @,@ 000 , and the club were unable to afford any further refurbishment . But the biggest change of all took place during 1994 and 1995 . The Taylor Report suggested that all stadia in the top two divisions of English football should no longer permit standing . The club 's response was to redevelop three sides of the ground with entirely new all @-@ seater stands created – the Borough Road Stand , the Cowshed and the new Kop . Capacity in the ground thus increased from 14 @,@ 200 to the 16 @,@ 567 of today . On 11 March 1995 , the new ground was officially opened at a cost of £ 3 @.@ 1 million . 
 In 2009 , Liverpool F.C. Reserves moved from the Racecourse Ground to Prenton Park . This ground continued to be their home for the 2011 – 12 season .

 = = = Main Stand = = = 
 The Main Stand is the oldest in Prenton Park , having been opened in December 1968 . It is also the largest , with a capacity of 5 @,@ 957 . A two tier stand , it is generally divided into three main sections . The lower tier consists of the Bebington End paddock ( capacity 1 @,@ 150 ) and the Town End paddock ( capacity 1 @,@ 209 ) , either side of the halfway line . The upper tier is simply referred to as the Main Stand ( capacity 3 @,@ 598 ) . 
 The Main Stand houses the VIP area , directors box and various suites . The Tranmere suite was added to the Main Stand in 1988 , with the Dixie Dean suite , Bunny Bell bar and Dave Russell restaurant added soon after . The 40 @-@ year @-@ old structure is becoming increasingly expensive to repair . 
 = = = Kop = = = 
 The Bebington Kop , simply referred to as the Kop , is a large single @-@ tier , all @-@ seater stand with a capacity of 5 @,@ 696 . Completed in 1995 , it replaced the earlier open terrace ( also called the Kop ) which had stood behind the goal at the Bebington End . The Bebington Kop is also the biggest Kop stand in Non league football . Originally the Kop housed both home and away fans , split down the middle , and occasionally was handed entirely to the away fans . However , following the 2000 League Cup semi @-@ final against Bolton , when the Kop was given entirely to the home fans , a campaign was begun to claim the Kop as a home end . From the 2000 @-@ 01 season this became the case , with away fans housed in the Cowshed . 
 = = = Johnny King Stand = = = 
 Built in 1995 and formerly known as the Borough Road Stand , it was renamed in 2002 to recognise former Rovers manager John King . The stand runs along the Borough Road side of the pitch , and is a low @-@ rise seated stand with a capacity of 2 @,@ 414 . 
 = = = Cowshed = = = 
 The Cowshed houses away fans at Prenton Park , and has a capacity of 2 @,@ 500 . It has a slanted seating arrangement , caused by the main road running behind it . It historically housed the more vocal home fans , but was switched to away supporters around the start of the 21st century . Since the change , a bar and TV screens have been added to the stand . 
 = = Attendances = = 
 Prenton Park has seen the number of supporters rise and fall considerably over its hundred @-@ year history . Around 8 @,@ 000 visitors watched the first game at the stadium on 11 March 1912 , as Tranmere beat Lancaster Town 8 – 0 . Early attendances varied from 5 @,@ 000 to 8 @,@ 000 , though , on Boxing Day 1921 , 11 @,@ 137 supporters came to see Tranmere take on Bolton Wanderers Reserves . Tranmere entered The Football League the next season , and 7 @,@ 011 watched their first game against Crewe Alexandra F.C .. There was an average of 6 @,@ 000 in attendance at home games , before the Football League was suspended as a result of the Second World War . 
 After the war , the number of supporters rose , and by the early 1960s this number had increased to highs of 12 @,@ 000 . Attendances began to fall towards the end of the 1960s ; this trend continued through the 1970s , though the decade did give Tranmere its largest @-@ ever crowd : 24 @,@ 424 on 5 February 1972 , for a fourth @-@ round FA Cup match against Stoke City . With today 's capacity of under 17 @,@ 000 , it is unlikely that this record attendance will ever be broken . 
 The 1980s saw the number of supporters falling to some of the ground 's lowest levels . The lowest ever attendance at Prenton Park was on 20 February 1984 , when only 937 supporters watched a 2 – 0 victory over Halifax Town . However , the decade also saw a high number of supporters in the ground for other reasons . In the Hillsborough disaster , 96 Liverpool F.C. fans lost their lives and , on 15 April 1989 , 12 @,@ 000 people attended a memorial service at Prenton Park . 
 Tranmere 's success in the 1990s led to improved attendances , rising to around 9 @,@ 000 per game . By 2010 , this had fallen to around 5 @,@ 000 per game ; however , 12 @,@ 249 supporters took advantage of an offer of free admission to watch a replayed match against Notts County F.C. , on 19 April 2011 . In the season 2011 – 2012 , there were two £ 5 administration offers available ; one of them was on a Bank Holiday and the other was for a celebration of 100 years of Prenton Park 1912 – 2012 with an attendance of 6 @,@ 824 , with many events on before and after the game and at half time .

 On Boxing Day 1935 , Tranmere faced Oldham Athletic at Prenton Park in the Third Division North . Oldham had beaten Tranmere 4 – 1 the previous day , but Tranmere won 13 – 4 in the return fixture , including nine goals by Bunny Bell . At the time Bell 's feat was an individual record , but it stood for only four months before Joe Payne netted ten for Luton Town , on his debut against Bristol Rovers .

 The only UEFA European Fixture to take place at Prenton Park was a UEFA Cup first qualifying round tie between Irish team Shelbourne and Scottish team Rangers , on 22 July 1998 .

The match finished 3 – 5 in favour of Rangers after Shelbourne ( at the time an amateur side ) had earlier taken a 3 – 0 lead . As a result of this game , Rangers were fined 25 @,@ 000 Swiss Francs and warned by UEFA for their fans ' behaviour at the game . 
 = HMS Bulldog ( H91 ) = 
 HMS Bulldog ( H91 ) was a B @-@ class destroyer built for the Royal Navy ( RN ) from 1929 to 1931 . Initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet , she was transferred to the Home Fleet in 1936 . During the Spanish Civil War of 1936 – 1939 , the ship spent considerable time in Spanish waters , enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides of the conflict . Bulldog saw service throughout World War II on convoy escort duty during the Battle of the Atlantic and in the Arctic . Her most notable actions were the capture of a complete Enigma machine and codebooks from the German submarine U @-@ 110 in 1941 , and sinking another German submarine in 1944 . The surrender of the German garrisons of the Channel Islands was signed on 9 May 1945 aboard Bulldog . Redundant after the war , she was broken up for scrap in 1946 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Bulldog displaced 1 @,@ 360 long tons ( 1 @,@ 380 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 790 long tons ( 1 @,@ 820 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of 323 feet ( 98 @.@ 5 m ) , a beam of 32 feet 3 inches ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 3 inches ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 34 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 25 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 35 knots ( 65 km / h ; 40 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3 @-@ drum boilers . Bulldog carried a maximum of 390 long tons ( 400 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 4 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 900 km ; 5 @,@ 500 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 134 officers and enlisted men , which increased to 142 during wartime . 
 Bulldog mounted four 45 @-@ calibre quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch Mk IX guns in single mounts , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' X ' , and ' Y ' from front to rear . She was briefly fitted with a C XIII mount capable of 60 @-@ degree elevation for testing purposes . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , Bulldog had two 40 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) QF 2 @-@ pounder Mk II AA guns mounted on a platform between her funnels . She was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedoes . One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began . The ship was fitted with a Type 119 ASDIC set to detect submarines through sound waves beamed into the water that would reflect off the submarine . 
 By April 1941 , the ship 's AA armament had been increased when the rear set of torpedo tubes was replaced by a 3 @-@ inch ( 76 @.@ 2 mm ) ( 12 @-@ pounder ) AA gun . In late 1941 , the ship was converted to an escort destroyer with the replacement of her ' A ' gun by a Hedgehog anti @-@ submarine spigot mortar . By April 1943 , the ' Y ' gun had been removed to compensate for the increase to 70 depth charges . Additional depth charge stowage later replaced the 12 @-@ pounder high @-@ angle gun . The 2 @-@ pounder mounts were replaced by 20 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) Oerlikon autocannon and two additional Oerlikon guns were also added in the forward superstructure . To combat German E @-@ boats , a QF 6 @-@ pounder gun was mounted at the very tip of the bow in 1944 . 
 = = Construction and service = = 
 The ship was ordered on 22 March 1929 from Swan Hunter at Wallsend , under the 1928 Naval Programme . She was laid down on 10 August 1929 , and launched on 6 December 1930 , as the sixth RN ship to carry this name . Bulldog was completed on 8 April 1931 at a cost of £ 221 @,@ 408 , excluding items supplied by the Admiralty such as guns , ammunition and communications equipment . After her commissioning , she was assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla with the Mediterranean Fleet until September 1936 , when it was transferred to the Home Fleet . Bulldog aided survivors of the 1932 <unk> earthquake and patrolled southern Spanish waters during the first month of the Spanish Civil War . During her time in the Mediterranean , the ship was refitted at Gibraltar in 1932 and 1935 and in Malta in 1936 . Once she returned to Britain , Bulldog was almost continuously under repair or refitting at Chatham Dockyard until 9 January 1937 . She remained with the 4th Flotilla until January 1939 , and made multiple deployments off the coast of Spain enforcing the embargo until 31 March 1938 , when she was refitted , this time at Sheerness Dockyard . The ship escorted the battleship Resolution to Scapa Flow in September during the Munich Crisis . Bulldog was briefly assigned to the Gibraltar Local Flotilla in January 1939 , until she became plane guard for the aircraft carrier Glorious in the Mediterranean in March . 
 In October she was deployed with Glorious , the battleship Malaya and the destroyer Daring as part of a Hunting Group in the Indian Ocean , based at Socotra . She sailed to Malta with Glorious in January 1940 to refit , returning to plane guard duty in March , this time for Ark Royal . In April Bulldog had repairs made to her feed water heater at Devonport , that lasted until 3 May . Bulldog joined the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow and sailed on 9 May , with a force consisting of the cruiser Birmingham and thirteen destroyers , to search off the mouth of the Skagerrak for German minelayers . The British force was spotted by German E @-@ boats and the minelayers returned to base before they could be intercepted . One of the E @-@ boats torpedoed the destroyer Kelly the next day and seriously damaged her . Bulldog towed Kelly to Hebburn for repairs , sustaining damage to her stern structure during the tow , which was repaired by Swan Hunter from 13 to 21 May . 
 The ship damaged her propellers on 27 May and was under repairs at Chatham Dockyard until 4 June , when she was transferred to the 1st Destroyer Flotilla . She sailed for Le Havre , France on 9 June , to assist in the evacuation of British troops before advancing German troops ( Operation Cycle ) . The next afternoon , she was severely damaged by three hits from German aircraft that knocked out her steering gear . Bulldog 's crew was able to temporarily repair the steering gear and the ship reached Portsmouth Dockyard early the following morning . Whilst under repair , she was further damaged by splinters during an air raid on 24 August . Bulldog rejoined the flotilla after her repairs were completed on 2 September . 
 She was refitted at Cammell Laird from 2 January to 18 February 1941 , and was assigned to the 3rd Escort Group for convoy escort duties to and from Iceland . Commander Joe Baker @-@ Cresswell was the ship 's captain as well as the commander of the group . Together with the destroyer Amazon and the sloop Rochester , she damaged U @-@ 94 on 7 May , while escorting Convoy OB 318 off Iceland . Two days later , the corvette <unk> depth @-@ charged U @-@ 110 , forcing her to the surface . Bulldog and the destroyer Broadway fired on , and then closed on the U @-@ boat , whose crew were abandoning the boat . Sub @-@ Lieutenant David Balme of Bulldog led a boarding party that removed the Enigma coding machine and various codebooks . This was of immense help to the Government Code and Cypher School in breaking German naval codes . She took the submarine in tow , but it sank the following morning . Bulldog remained on Atlantic convoy duties until October , when she sailed to <unk> in Govan , Glasgow , for conversion into an escort destroyer , a process that lasted until February 1942 . As part of the conversion , a Type 271 target indication radar was installed above the bridge , that replaced her director @-@ control tower and rangefinder . By 1944 a Type 290 short @-@ range surface search radar was also fitted . 
 Bulldog was an unattached ship assigned to Western Approaches Command from 10 February 1942 , and aided the destroyer Richmond after she had collided with the American merchant ship SS Francis Scott Key on 31 March whilst escorting Convoy PQ 14 from Eban , Scotland to Reykjavík , Iceland . On 12 April , she rejoined the convoy en route to Murmansk , where they arrived a week later . Beginning on 28 April , she escorted the returning Convoy QP 11 with the same ships . Two days later the light cruiser Edinburgh joined the convoy . Whilst taking position ahead of the convoy later that day , Edinburgh was hit by two torpedoes fired by U @-@ 456 . The cruiser , heavily damaged and with her steering gear wrecked , was taken in tow for the voyage back to Murmansk . On 1 May the convoy was attacked by the German destroyers Z7 Hermann Schoemann , Z24 , and Z25 which had been searching for Edinburgh . Commander Maxwell Richmond , Bulldog 's captain and commander of the escorts , interposed his four destroyers between the Germans and the merchantmen and drove off the Germans in a three @-@ hour battle during which Bulldog was lightly damaged by shell splinters . She was repaired from 2 June to 14 August , after which she was assigned to the Greenock Special Escort Division . In November she escorted British ships participating in the Allied landings in North Africa ( Operation Torch ) , before returning to Greenock for repairs from 23 November to 14 December . 
 Bulldog was assigned to the escort for Convoy JW 51B on 20 December , but had to return home for weather repairs on 28 December . After repairs were completed on 16 January 1943 , she escorted convoys between Iceland and the UK for the next two months . The ship was under repair at Greenock from 29 March to 22 April , after which she sailed to Freetown for escort duties between Lagos , Nigeria , Freetown and Gibraltar . Bulldog returned home in October for a lengthy refit at Portsmouth Dockyard that lasted from 8 November to 24 May 1944 . In June she began escort duties between the River Clyde and the Faeroe Islands , and sank U @-@ 719 on 26 June . 
 On 20 August , her hull was badly damaged after a collision with the frigate Loch Dunvegan in Gourock Bay . After repairs at Ardrossan that lasted until 4 September , she resumed local convoy duties between the Faeroes , the Clyde and Scapa Flow until she required major machinery repairs in November . Upon their completion on 30 January 1945 , Bulldog escorted convoys between Plymouth and various ports in the Irish Sea for the rest of the war . On 9 May 1945 she sailed to Guernsey and the German forces in the Channel Islands formally surrendered to British representatives aboard the ship . The ship was placed in Category ' B ' reserve on 27 May at Dartmouth . She was transferred to Rosyth on 27 November and was reduced to Category ' C ' reserve on 13 December . Bulldog was approved for scrapping on 22 December and turned over to Metal Industries , Limited on 17 January 1946 .

 Continuing from the previous episode , Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) and Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) hold each other at gunpoint . Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) , the person lingering outside his apartment , bursts in and forces Skinner to put his gun down . He also demands that Skinner surrender the digital tape . Skinner insists on keeping the tape , saying it is their only leverage in exposing the conspiracy . 
 The agents visit The Lone Gunmen , showing them an old photo featuring Bill Mulder , The Smoking Man , Deep Throat , and other members of the Syndicate . The Lone Gunmen also recognize Victor Klemper , a notorious Nazi scientist who was brought to the United States under Operation Paperclip . Melvin Frohike informs Scully of her sister Melissa 's condition . Mulder persuades Scully not to visit Melissa at the hospital , since she could be targeted there . 
 Furious that the wrong person was murdered , the Syndicate demands that the Smoking Man produce the tape . The Smoking Man promises to do so the following day . Meanwhile , Mulder and Scully visit Klemper , who says that the photo was taken at a former mining facility in West Virginia . After the agents leave , Klemper calls the Well @-@ Manicured Man and informs him that Mulder is alive . The news causes the Syndicate to further mistrust the Smoking Man . Meanwhile , at the hospital , Albert Hosteen visits Melissa while a suited man <unk> nearby . 
 Mulder and Scully arrive at the mining facility and , using the code for Napier 's constant given to them by Klemper , unlock one of the reinforced doors inside . The agents discover a large complex of filing cabinets containing smallpox vaccination records and tissue samples . Mulder finds his sister 's file and finds that it was originally meant for him . Meanwhile , Skinner tells the Smoking Man that he may have found the digital tape . The Smoking Man is agitated at this , insisting that he will not make a deal with Skinner and tacitly threatening his life .

 Jan Delasara , in the book ' " PopLit , PopCult and The X @-@ Files " argues that episodes like " Paper Clip " , or the later episodes like " Nisei " and " 731 " , show the public 's trust in science " eroding " , Delasara proposes that " arrogated " scientists who are " rework [ ing ] the fabric of life " are causing the public 's faith in science to fade drastically , " a concern " , she notes , " that is directly addressed by X @-@ Files episodes " . 
 Moreover , she notes that almost all of the scientists portrayed in The X @-@ Files are depicted with a " connection to ancient evil " , with the lone exception being Agent Scully . In " Paper Clip " one of the main scientists is an ex @-@ Nazi . As the episode proceeds , his scientific pursuits soon begin to paint him as the archetypical scientist who " goes too far " , a serious factor Delasara argues " ' alienates ' [ the public ] further from science and its practitioners " .

 The aliens in this episode who run past Scully in the mining facility were portrayed by children aged eight and nine . The spacecraft spotted by Mulder was achieved by using a crane to lift lights over the building Mulder was outside . Napier 's constant is used as a code to access the mining facility in the episode , though the code used is in error . Scully and Mulder use the code " <unk> " to unlock the door when in fact the first five digits of Napier 's Constant are <unk> . The mining facility is named for Dr. Hubertus Strughold , a real @-@ life German scientist who was employed by the United States after World War II . The fictional Victor Klemper is based on Strughold , who was accused of conducting similar experiments on humans . Interestingly , the name is almost identical to a Victor Klemperer who was a German Jew that escaped persecution during World War II by fleeing to American @-@ controlled territory . The Strughold Mining Facility was filmed at the B.C. Museum of Mining , in Britannia Beach , British Columbia , Canada . This episode was dedicated in memoriam to Mario Mark Kennedy , an internet fan of the show who had died in a car accident in 1995 . 
 Story editor Frank Spotnitz said of the episode , " I love ' Paper Clip ' . I was thrilled with the plot . I know it moved very fast for some people , but I actually think that for some of these shows you don 't need to understand everything . I think it is more exciting to go at rocket speed . Everybody was on the mark in that one ; David and Gillian 's performances , Rob Bowman 's direction , Chris Carter 's writing - everything was just terrific in that show " . Bowman said " When I finished ' Paper Clip ' , I thought , ' I don 't know what else I am going to do this year to top this ' " In 1996 Mitch Pileggi called the episode one of the show 's finest , particularly enjoying the line where he tells The Smoking Man to " pucker up and kiss my ass " . Pileggi claims that is one of his favorite lines . The scene was used frequently to introduce him at X @-@ Files conventions . 
 The creators likened themes of the episode to the Star Wars trilogy , referring to the revelations about Fox Mulder 's father , and Sophie 's Choice , referring to how the Mulders were forced to choose Fox or Samantha to be taken . Carter included the motif of the white buffalo after reading a news story about the birth of a white buffalo calf , feeling that the image was so potent he did not mind that it did not entirely fit with the Navajo beliefs used elsewhere in the episode .

 Cummings joined the Los Angeles Athletic Club ( <unk> ) in 1934 and received her first financial support in 1935 , helping her attend that year 's Far Western Championships . She captured the American national 200 @-@ meter breaststroke championship in 1936 , which led to her participation in that year 's Olympic trials and her selection as a member of the United States delegation to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin . She was required , however , to raise her own funds for travel to the Games and spent much of her time leading up to the tournament collecting money rather than training . In the women 's 200 @-@ meter breaststroke , she placed fourth in her heat in the opening round and was eliminated . Despite this , she remained as national champion in the event through 1939 , although she left the <unk> in 1937 . She placed second at the 1939 National Championships and retired from active competition shortly after , deciding that the 1940 Summer Olympics were unlikely to occur .

 = Nirmala ( novel ) = 
 Nirmala ( Hindi : <unk> ् <unk> ( virtuous or pure ) or The Second Wife ) is a Hindi fiction novel written in Hindi and Urdu writer Munshi Premchand . The melodramatic novel is centered on Nirmala , a young girl who was forced to marry a widower of her father 's age . The plot unfolds to reveal her husband ’ s suspicion of a relationship between her and his eldest son , a suspicion that leads to the son ’ s death . 
 A poignant novel first published in 1927 , Nirmala 's reformist agenda is transparent in its theme which deals with the question of dowry , and consequently mismatched marriages and related issues . The story uses fiction to highlight an era of much needed social reform in 1920s Indian society . Nirmala was serialized in 1928 in Chand , a women ’ s magazine in which the novel ’ s feminist character was represented . Nirmala is somewhat like <unk> ( published in 1936 ) in that it deals with the exploitation of the village poor , and was translated by multiple scholarly translators . It was first translated in 1988 as The Second Wife by David Rubin , and in 1999 as Nirmala by Alok Rai , Premchand 's grandson . 
 = = Plot = = 
 <unk> Lal , a lawyer by profession , arranged to marry off his 15 @-@ years @-@ old daughter Nirmala to Bhuvanmohan Sinha , son of <unk> Sinha . Lal was later murdered by his rival <unk> , who was once tried in court by Lal and sentenced to jail . The death of Lal caused Bhuvanmohan and <unk> to withdraw from the arranged marriage since there was no longer a large dowry as anticipated prior to Lal 's death . Financial hardship forced Nirmala 's mother , Kalyani , to marry her off to Totaram , a lawyer 20 years her senior . Totaram tried his best to seduce his beautiful young wife but to no avail . She had no feelings for him other than respect and a sense of duty , which fell short of the love he expected to receive from his wife . 
 Totaram had 3 sons from his first marriage . His eldest son Mansaram was only a year older than Nirmala . It wasn 't long before Totaram grew suspicious of Nirmala and her relationship with his son Mansaram . Jealousy and suspicion caused him to send Mansaram away to live in a hostel , a decision they all soon came to regret . Mansaram 's health soon deteriorated in the hostel environment . It was Bhuvanmohan who treated Mansaram at the hospital . When Bhuvanmohan learned about Nirmala , he arranged for his brother to marry Nirmala 's sister , Krishna , as penance . Bhuvanmohan was haunted by his thoughts of Nirmala and her distress . Mansaram eventually died of tuberculosis . Totaram was heartbroken and guilt ridden over his role in his son 's death . It wasn 't long thereafter when his second son <unk> absconded with Nirmala 's jewels and fled from Totaram 's house . He later committed suicide . Totaram 's third son Siyaram also fled , having been lured away by a false saint . Depressed over the loss of his sons , Totaram set off on a mission to find his only living son , Siyaram . 
 Meanwhile , Bhuvanmohan was back in Nirmala 's life as the husband of her friend , Sudha . He tried to seduce Nirmala , but his wife learned of it and criticized him harshly . Bhuvanmohan became emotionally distressed , and out of sorrow and his love for her , he committed suicide . Depressed by the sad turn of events and her own failing health , Nirmala gave her daughter Asha to <unk> , Totaram 's widowed sister , and died .

 = = Background = = 
 Set against a background of pre @-@ independent India , Nirmala depicts a realistic and picturesque portrait of the 1920s , the language and milieu of the era . It characterizes the evils of the dowry system , and in doing so reflects the author 's desire to bring about social reform and raise the status of women in society . The author 's words illustrate his country 's poor , and paints a picture of rural India consisting largely of a static society , the clashes of castes , its poverty and exploitation , and the rich character of its people . The novel covers a time span of about six years during which time Nirmala transitions from student to wife and thereafter , a mother . It was an era when self @-@ respect and public image were of fundamental importance in the society . Eating meals was observed with an extreme ritualistic importance . In traditional homes , women did not eat with the men , and waited for them to finish before they were permitted to eat . There was also a fear of hospitals [ and also of blood transfusion ] which explains the hesitation of the character Totaram and his guilt over sending his son to a hospital . The generations that have passed since the novel was first written have seen dramatic changes in " attitude , sensibility and aspiration . " Nirmala is a reflection of a time in Indian society when a young girl 's " greatest sin was to require a husband who would accept her without a dowry . " 
 = = Publication = = 
 Nirmala was one of Premchand 's most popular novels of its time in India , a time of oppression for women in Indian society that drew increasing attention from writers and poets . Prior to being published in its entirety , Nirmala was serialised in the magazine Chand over the course of a year , beginning in November 1925 . It was during the time when Premchand first embarked on writing fiction based on contemporary social issues . Unlike his other works , Nirmala has a darker tone and ending , and its characters are less idealised . It was translated into English for the first time in 1988 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Francesca Orsini called it a prime example of Premchand ’ s combination of social realism and drama . Gulzar believed the novel was a little outstretched , and had a tendency to repeat many emotions , but also had its diversions and contradictions . He further explained that Premchand specialised in subjects that revolved around a young girl under 18 years old who suddenly becomes a woman after marrying a man who is much older . 
 Many films based on the story 's theme were also produced , such as <unk> Munshi Premchand Ki directed by Gulzar and shown in Doordarshan . Nirmala 's role was played by the Marathi actress <unk> Subhash who received many accolades .

 Gladstone is a city located in Clackamas County , Oregon , United States . The population was 11 @,@ 497 at the 2010 census . Gladstone is an approximately 4 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 10 km2 ) suburban community , 12 miles ( 19 km ) south of Portland , the largest city in Oregon , and located at the confluence of the Clackamas and Willamette rivers . 
 Gladstone has held several important cultural and social events , hosting both the inaugural Clackamas County Fair and the Oregon State Fair , before both were moved to more spacious locations . Both Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan and presidential candidate Theodore Roosevelt have given public speeches in the city . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Clackamas Indians = = = 
 Prior to European settlement , there were several Native American groups living in the area that was to become Gladstone . 
 In 1804 , President Thomas Jefferson commissioned the Lewis and Clark expedition to explore the Louisiana Territory and beyond . Although the expedition passed only near the Gladstone – Oregon City locality on their way to and from the Pacific Ocean , via the Columbia River , natives such as the Kalapuya and the Clackamas people told them about the area . 
 In the subsequent years , successive waves of explorers and traders would introduce epidemics of cholera and smallpox , which would take a heavy toll on the native peoples and contributed to a substantial reduction in population . 
 As Oregon City was founded and European settlers began moving to the area , they petitioned their governments to remove the local natives from the land , so that the settlers could use it for farming and housing . The government allocated a reservation for the natives and re @-@ appropriated Gladstone for redevelopment . 
 As of 2014 , the only extant remnant of the bygone natives is a large maple tree called the " Pow Wow Tree " , which is listed as an Oregon Heritage Tree . The tree still stands at Clackamas Boulevard , and is said to have marked the place where the different native tribes , mainly Clackamas and Multnomahs , met to make trading agreements , settle community affairs , and conduct wedding ceremonies . In 1860 , the Pow @-@ Wow Tree was the location set for the first Clackamas County Fair . The following year , it was used as a parade ring for the first Oregon State Fair and marked the entrance . In 1937 , the tree itself was celebrated with the Gladstone Pow @-@ Wow Festival .

 The earliest homesteads in the area were recipients of the Donation Land Claim Act . The Cason and the <unk> families were the first settlers to receive their donation land claims in Gladstone . Peter M. <unk> and his family owned the land between Jennings Lodge and the Clackamas River , and between the Willamette River and Portland Avenue . <unk> Cason , who came to Oregon in 1843 and would go on to serve on in the Oregon Territorial Legislature , owned an area of equal in size east of Portland Avenue . 
 = = = Unsuccessful early townships = = = 
 Before Gladstone was formally founded , several small settlements were established in its vicinity . However , due to various natural disasters , such as fires and floods , few survived to become incorporated cities of today . 
 One such community was Linn City ( originally named Robin ’ s Nest ) . Settled in 1843 by Robert Moore , Robert himself built four flour and lumber mills along the banks of the Willamette . Warehouses , homes , and mills were steadily added until 1861 , when a fire destroyed several of the buildings . Efforts at rebuilding the small town entirely ceased when the Great Flood of 1862 struck , wiping out the remaining buildings . 
 Another such ill @-@ fated settlement was <unk> , located near the Willamette Falls . <unk> prospered until 1861 , when the same great flood swept most of the town over the falls . Even after reconstruction , much of the town 's importance to river commerce ended in 1873 with completion of the Willamette Falls Locks . Ships no longer needed to dock and unload goods and passengers for portage around the falls . The remaining town officially survived until 1929 , when it was annexed to Oregon City .

 Gladstone was founded by Judge Harvey Cross in 1889 , and formally incorporated on January 10 , 1911 . It was named after the British statesman William Ewart Gladstone . Judge Cross laid out the city 's first streets . Cross ' home was built in the late 1840s by <unk> Cason , and Cross purchased it in 1862 . The Cason @-@ Cross House later became Cochran Mortuary . Currently , Mr. Rooter , a plumbing service , occupies the space . There is also a small park named after Cross , located at the same place one of the Indian tribes made its camp . 
 = = = Chautauqua movement = = = 
 In 1894 , the Chautauqua movement made its way to Gladstone . Judge Cross established a fifty @-@ year lease of Gladstone Park for this event after he was convinced by Oregon City author Eva Emery Dye that doing so would be a boon to the city and its people . Beginning on July 24 – 26 , 1894 , the newly formed Willamette Valley Chautauqua Association held an annual summer assembly that offered performances , lectures , and concerts . This event would reoccur annually , until Gladstone 's Chautauqua Park grew to be the third @-@ largest permanent Chautauqua assembly park in the United States . 
 In 1896 , William Jennings Bryan drew a crowd of 6 @,@ 000 to Gladstone ’ s then 78 @-@ acre Chautauqua park to hear him give his popular lecture , “ The Prince of Peace ” , which stressed that Christian theology , through both individual and group morality , was a solid foundation for peace and equality . 
 With the advent of radio , improved transportation and the appearance of traveling vaudeville acts in Portland , attendance at the Chautauqua began to dwindle . In 1927 , the Willamette Valley Chautauqua Association went bankrupt . Judge Cross died on August 7 , 1927 , and shortly thereafter , Gladstone Park , including its buildings and Chautauqua Lake , were sold to the Western Oregon Conference of Seventh @-@ day Adventists .

However , during a war with the bordering <unk> dynasty , Kuchlug initiated a coup d 'état against <unk> . After Kuchlug took power , he allowed <unk> to rule the Qara Khitai in name only . When the <unk> died in 1213 , Kuchlug took direct control of the khanate . Originally a Nestorian , once among the Khitai Kuchlug converted to Buddhism and began persecuting the Muslim majority , forcing them to convert to either Buddhism or Christianity , a move which alienated Kuchlug from most of the population . When Kuchlug besieged the Karluk city of Almaliq , the Karluks , vassals of the Mongol Empire , requested aid from Genghis Khan .

There , Jebe defeated an army of 30 @,@ 000 troops and Kuchlug fled to Kashgar . Taking advantage of the unrest fomenting under Kuchlug 's rule , Jebe gained support from the Muslim populace by announcing that Kuchlug 's policy of religious persecution had ended .

Lorde wrote the lyrics , while Little composed the melodies and played all the instruments , including drums , guitars and synthesisers . In total , the pair took three weeks to finish The Love Club EP . 
 = = Composition = = 
 The Love Club EP consists of five songs , written by Lorde ( credited to her birth @-@ name Ella Yelich @-@ O 'Connor ) and Little . The Nelson Mail 's Nick Ward described the EP as " indie @-@ flavoured electronica " and detailed Lorde 's voice as " smoky " . Meanwhile , Chris Schulz from The New Zealand Herald said Lorde 's voice " seems to come from someone twice her age " . Critics compared the EP 's musical style to works by Sky Ferreira , Florence and the Machine and Lana Del Rey . Editor Jim Pinckney from New Zealand Listener opined that Lorde 's songs are structured like short stories . 
 The Love Club EP opens with the chamber pop song " Bravado " . Inspired by Kanye West 's song " Dark Fantasy " , it talks about Lorde 's feigned confidence as she prepared to enter the music industry . " Royals " and " Million Dollar Bills " are two tracks that criticise the glamorous lifestyle of the rich ; the former combines subgenres of pop , including art pop and electropop , and also incorporates R & B , while the latter is a hybrid of pop and alternative rock with hip hop influences . The title track of the EP , " The Love Club " , discusses the befriending of " a bad crowd " . The Love Club EP concludes with the trip hop @-@ influenced drum and bass number " Biting Down " , featuring " futuristic war drum thump " . For the US iTunes Store September 2013 edition of The Love Club EP , " Royals " was replaced by " Swingin Party " , a cover version of The Replacements ' song .

 = Azati Prime = 
 " Azati Prime " is the seventieth episode of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Enterprise , the eighteenth of season three . The episode was written by Manny Coto from a story developed by Coto , Rick Berman and Brannon Braga . It was directed by Allan Kroeker , his second of the season . The episode featured several guest actors , including those playing members of the Xindi Council , as well as Matt Winston who reprised his role of Temporal Agent Daniels for the second time this season . 
 Set in the 22nd century , the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship Enterprise , registration NX @-@ 01 . Season three of Enterprise features an ongoing story following an attack on Earth by previously unknown aliens called the Xindi . In this episode , the crew track a Xindi superweapon down to a planet and Captain Jonathan Archer ( Scott Bakula ) seeks to destroy the weapon in a suicide attack . He is captured , and the Enterprise is seriously damaged after an attack by four Xindi vessels . 
 The USS Enterprise @-@ J appeared in this episode , based on designs by Doug Drexler . The ship was from 400 years in the future from the timeframe that the series is set in , and the bridge set was created mostly using green screen . John Eaves also created several designs of aquatic Xindi vessels for this episode . " Azati Prime " received Nielsen ratings of 2 @.@ 6 / 4 percent . Critical reaction was mostly positive , with praise directed at the pacing of the episode and the plotting of the overall arc . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Enterprise approaches Azati Prime where the Xindi are constructing their superweapon . Captain Archer sends Commander Tucker and Ensign Mayweather on board a Xindi shuttle they had just captured to investigate the planet . Working their way past security , they approach the weapon , which is being built underwater . Meanwhile , Archer orders Enterprise to destroy a Xindi detection facility on the planet 's moon to prevent it from signalling the ship 's presence . The shuttle returns with scans of the weapon , and Archer designates himself to pilot a suicide mission to destroy it . The crew try to talk him out of it but he is resolute . 
 Archer then suddenly finds himself 400 years in the future on board the USS Enterprise @-@ J , alongside Temporal Agent Daniels . They are at the battle where the Sphere Builders ( the alien species first seen in episode " Harbinger " ) are defeated , and Daniels gives Archer an initiation medal from a Xindi who had joined Starfleet as temporal evidence . Back on his Enterprise , Archer rejects the notion of a Human @-@ Xindi détente , and leaves on the shuttle . He arrives at the superweapon construction site but finds it gone , and is rapidly captured by the Xindi Commander Dolim . 
 The Reptilians begin to interrogate Archer , who then asks to speak to Degra , the Primate scientist from episode Stratagem . Using Daniels ' medal , Archer tries to convince Degra that the Reptilians cannot be trusted , but Dolim arrives with armed colleagues and takes the Primates away . Meanwhile , Sub @-@ Commander T 'Pol , now in command of Enterprise , displays signs of an emotional breakdown . She also decides to go on a mission , to negotiate a peace , and reacts angrily when Tucker tries to stop her . An attack from four Xindi ships follows , and as the episode concludes , Enterprise is left severely damaged . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Azati Prime " was the first episode of Enterprise to be filmed in 2004 , starting on January 5 . Filming took eight days , concluding on January 14 . The eighth day overlapped with the production of the following episode , " Damage " . The story was developed by Manny Coto alongside Rick Berman and Brannon Braga . Coto developed it into a script , his third of the series . The director of the episode was Allan Kroeker , who also directed " The Xindi " earlier in the season as well as the final episodes of both Star Trek : Deep Space Nine and Star Trek : Voyager . The episode featured a number of guest stars , including Smallwood , Oglesby , MacDonald and Worthy who appeared in their recurring roles on the Xindi council . Winston appeared as Daniels for the second time during season three , having made his debut in season one 's " Cold Front " . 
 The Xindi shuttle set had been constructed for " Hatchery " , while a new set was constructed for the bridge of the Enterprise @-@ J which consisted mostly of a green screen . The future Enterprise was designed by Doug Drexler , who drew the first design only two days prior to the production meeting for the episode . The computer generated model was created in a few hours , and Drexler later said that they would have finished it differently . He imagined that the vessel was so large that there would be universities and entire parks on board , with the <unk> replaced by short range transporters . More than one design was created , with the final version created with elements from different designs . One of the elements incorporated into the version seen on screen was a reduction in the size of the warp nacelle supports as Drexler said that he didn 't like that they had increased in size . John Eaves also created a number of designs for aquatic Xindi vessels for use in the episode , as well as a rejected design for the superweapon . 
 = = Reception and home media release = = 
 " Azati Prime " was first aired in the United States on UPN on March 3 , 2004 . It received a 2 @.@ 6 / 4 percent share among adults . This means that it was seen by 2 @.@ 6 percent of all households , and 4 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast . Enterprise was the sixth most watched program in the timeslot , behind Smallville on The WB . It was estimated that " Azati Prime " was watched by 4 @.@ 02 million viewers , which was less than recent episodes had received . 
 Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation compared elements of the episode to the Star Wars franchise , such as the Xindi superweapon standing in for the Death Star . She found the pacing made the episode " engrossing " and thought that the action sequences would qualify it for technical Emmy Awards . She said that the one flaw in the episode was the characterisation of Archer and T 'Pol , as she felt that some of their actions were implausible . Jamahl Epsicokhan on his website " Jammer 's Reviews " , gave " Azati Prime " a rating of three and a half out of four . He thought it was compelling and was impressed with how elements of earlier episodes were brought together , also saying that it was " possibly the most entertaining episode of Enterprise yet this season " . Film and television critic Jordan Hoffman gave the episode four out of five , saying that the Xindi storyline was reaching a peak . 
 The only home media release of " Azati Prime " has been as part of the season three DVD box set , released in the United States on September 27 , 2005 . The Blu @-@ ray release of Enterprise was announced in early 2013 and season three is expected to be released in January 2014 . 
 = Persoonia lanceolata = 
 Persoonia lanceolata , commonly known as lance @-@ leaf geebung , is a shrub native to New South Wales in eastern Australia . It reaches 3 m ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) in height and has smooth grey bark and bright green foliage . Its small yellow flowers grow on racemes and appear in the austral summer and autumn ( January to April ) , followed by green fleshy fruits ( known as drupes ) which ripen the following spring ( September to October ) . Within the genus Persoonia , P. lanceolata belongs to the lanceolata group of 58 closely related species . It interbreeds with several other species found in its range . 
 The species is usually found in dry sclerophyll forest on sandstone @-@ based nutrient @-@ deficient soil . It has adapted to a fire @-@ prone environment ; plants lost in bushfires can regenerate through a ground @-@ stored seed bank . Seedlings mostly germinate within two years of fires . Several species of native bee of the genus Leioproctus pollinate the flowers . Swamp wallabies are a main consumer of its fruit , and the seeds are spread in wallaby faeces . Its lifespan ranges from 25 to 60 years , though difficulties in propagation have seen low cultivation rates . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Persoonia lanceolata was officially described in 1799 by Henry Charles Andrews from a plant grown from seeds by L. Wilson in Islington . Andrews also described some plants which he had grown from seed in a nursery in Hammersmith as P. latifolia , which turned out to be the same species . The specific epithet is the Latin word lanceolata , meaning " spear @-@ shaped " , and refers to the shape of the leaves . Lance @-@ leaf geebung is the common name . The term geebung is derived from the Dharug language word geebung . German botanist Otto Kuntze coined the binomial name Linkia lanceolata in 1891 , from Cavanilles ' original description of the genus description Linkia , but the name was eventually rejected in favour of Persoonia . The horticulturist Joseph Knight described this species as the privet @-@ like <unk> ( Persoonia <unk> ) in his controversial 1809 work On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae , but the binomial name was declared an illegitimate name as it postdated Andrews ' description and name . Robert Brown used Andrews ' name in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen . 
 In 1870 , George Bentham published the first infrageneric arrangement of Persoonia in Volume 5 of his landmark Flora Australiensis . He divided the genus into three sections , placing P. lanceolata in P. sect . Amblyanthera . The genus was reviewed by Peter Weston for the Flora of Australia treatment in 1995 , and P. lanceolata gave its name to the lanceolata group , a group of 58 closely related species with similar flowers but very different foliage . These species often interbreed with each other where two members of the group occur , and hybrids of P. lanceolata with P. <unk> , P. levis , P. linearis , P. <unk> and P. virgata have been recorded . The glaucous @-@ leaved P. glaucescens was formerly considered a subspecies of P. lanceolata , but no intermediate forms have been recorded from where the two taxa grow together near Hill Top in the Southern Highlands . P. lanceolata has seven chromosomes , as do most other members of the genus , and they are large compared to those of other proteaceae . 
 = = Description = = 
 Persoonia lanceolata is a shrub which ranges from 0 @.@ 5 – 3 m ( 1 @.@ 6 – 9 @.@ 8 ft ) high . The grey bark is smooth , and the new growth is hairy . Arranged alternately on the stems , the thick leathery leaves are oblanceolate or obovate in shape , and measure 3 – 10 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) in length , and around 0 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 16 – 1 @.@ 3 in ) wide . Hairy when young , they are smooth and featureless . Bright green in colour with a yellowish tint at times , the leaves are concolorous , that is both leaf surfaces are the same colour . The finely hairy yellow flowers appear mainly from January to April , but may be encountered at any time of year . They are arranged in leafy racemes , and each stem may bear 4 to 54 flowers . P. lanceolata is described as auxotelic , which means each stalk bears an individual flower that is subtended by a leaf at its junction with the stem . On 0 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 in ) stalks , the flowers may reach 1 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) in dimensions , and are typical for the genus . 
 Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth which splits into four segments or tepals , and contains both male and female parts . Within this , the central style is surrounded by the anther , which splits into four segments ; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above . They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma , which is located at the tip of the style . The smooth fleshy drupes are green and more or less round , measuring 1 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 in ) by 0 @.@ 8 cm ( 0 @.@ 3 in ) in diameter . Containing two seeds , they weigh around 1 @.@ 3 g ( 0 @.@ 05 oz ) and become partly red as they ripen and fall to the ground the following spring ( September to October ) . Once fallen to the ground , the drupes soften and become a dark red over two to three weeks before <unk> and blackening . The drupes are edible and were eaten by the local aboriginal people . 
 The firm bark and lanceolate leaves of P. lanceolata distinguish it from P. levis , with which it can be confused ; the latter species has flaky bark and asymmetrical leaves . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Persoonia lanceolata is found along coastal and near @-@ coastal areas of New South Wales east of the Great Dividing Range , from Trial Bay on the Mid North Coast to Sassafras Morton National Park in the south . Its habitat extends to dry sclerophyll forest and heathland on sandstone @-@ based soils low in nutrients , particularly on the tops of ridges and slopes . Examples in more sheltered areas are often taller than those in more exposed areas . P. lanceolata is found from sea level to an altitude of 700 m ( 2 @,@ 300 ft ) , and the annual rainfall of the area it occurs in the Sydney Basin is 900 – 1 @,@ 400 mm ( 35 – 55 in ) . The species is considered adequately protected in the Sydney region and is found in <unk> , Brisbane Water , <unk> , Ku @-@ ring @-@ gai Chase , Lane Cove , Sydney Harbour and Botany Bay National Parks . In heathland habitats , P. lanceolata grows with such species as Banksia ericifolia , B. oblongifolia and <unk> fascicularis . In more forested areas it is an understory shrub alongside Lambertia formosa , Leptospermum trinervium , <unk> corymbosa , Banksia serrata and B. ericifolia under such trees as Eucalyptus sclerophylla , E. piperita , E. sieberi , E. sparsifolia , E. punctata and Corymbia gummifera . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 The swamp wallaby ( <unk> bicolor ) feeds on the fallen fruit of P. lanceolata and disperses the seed through its scat ( dung ) . A field study in Ku @-@ ring @-@ gai Chase National Park found that 88 % of seeds in the scat were still viable although dormant . The red @-@ necked wallaby ( Macropus <unk> ) feeds on drupes and is a likely seed dispersal agent . Animals can convey seed for one or two kilometres from where they have fed . Rodents such as the bush rat ( Rattus fuscipes ) and black rat ( Rattus rattus ) eat the drupes but chew the seed so that only fragments leave their digestive system . Foxes have been reported to eat the fruit , and kangaroos and large birds such as currawongs are thought to as well . 
 Colletid bees of the genus Leioproctus , subgenus Cladocerapis , forage exclusively on and pollinate flowers of many species of Persoonia . Bees of the subgenus Filiglossa in the same genus also feed only on Persoonia flowers but do not appear to be effective pollinators . Recorded species include the longtongue bees Leioproctus ( Cladocerapis ) carinatifrons , L. <unk> , and L. <unk> , as well as Leioproctus <unk> and <unk> species . The European honeybee ( Apis mellifera ) is a common visitor to flowers , although its effectiveness as a pollinator is unclear . Persoonia lanceolata is an obligate <unk> , that is , flowers need to be pollinated by pollen from other plants , and honeybees tend to forage more on different flowers of the same plant than between plants , as native bees do . Their abundance might be impacting the pollination success of native bees in this and other Persoonia species . 
 Infection by the fungal species <unk> persooniae and <unk> persooniae results in leaf spot disease . 
 P. lanceolata shrubs destroyed by bushfire regenerate through seedlings surviving through seedbank in the soil . The Ku @-@ ring @-@ gai Chase study found that seedlings germinated within two years of a 1994 bushfire , although some appeared up to six years afterwards , while germination was not related to any particular season . Plants take six years to reach maturity . Thus , more frequent bushfires prevent recruitment and hence endanger populations . However , plants in Lane Cove National Park were recorded maturing three years after an especially intense bushfire . What triggers germination is unknown , and seedlings have also arisen from areas disturbed by sand mining , sometimes growing in higher concentrations than before the disturbance . The natural lifespan of a plant appears to range from 25 to 60 years . 
 = = Cultivation and uses = = 
 Persoonia lanceolata is rarely seen in cultivation , mainly due to difficulties in propagation ; seed germination is unpredictable , and cuttings have proven difficult to strike . Nevertheless , its bright green hue is considered an attractive horticultural feature . Well drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for this plant in a garden setting . Once established , it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells , and grows fairly readily in suitable conditions . Plantsmen in England were able to germinate seed there in 1791 . 
 <unk> were eaten by indigenous people on the Beecroft Peninsula , and were preferred over those of P. <unk> .

 Chicado V started only six times because knee problems cut short her racing career . However , she won her first two starts while breaking or equaling track records , and was given the title of co @-@ Champion Quarter Running Two @-@ Year @-@ Old Filly by the American Quarter Horse Association ( AQHA ) in 1952 . The next year she ran her last four races , winning once and setting one more speed record . After her last race , in December 1953 , she was retired from the track to become a broodmare , and had nine foals . Two of her offspring were named Champion Quarter Running Horses , and all her foals had a total of seven stakes race wins . One of her daughters , Table Tennis , went on to become a noted broodmare herself , as did Table Tennis ' daughter Rapid Volley and granddaughter Perks . However , three of Chicado V 's sons — Triple Chick , Three Chicks , and The Ole Man — were her best known offspring ; all three became leading sires and are the main cause of her fame .

 When mature , Chicado V stood 15 @.@ 0 hands ( 60 inches , 152 cm ) tall . She was a brown mare , with a connected star , stripe , and snip on her face as her only markings , or identifying marks . Earl Holmes , a longtime trainer who started his racing career as a groom for Vessels , had the care of Chicado V after she was born , and said of her that she " was gentle , real gentle — in everything . She was born broke [ n ] . " When she stood in a starting gate for a race , Holmes said she looked like a rabbit , because " she had big ears and that 's all you could see , she was so little " . She also had a body defect , or conformation fault , in that she had calf @-@ knees . 
 = = Racing career = = 
 Chicado V was sent out for race training as a two @-@ year @-@ old , at first to her owner 's trainer , Farrell Jones , who liked neither her calf @-@ knees nor her habit of running poorly in training . She consistently hung behind the other horses in group training runs , and Jones sent her back to Vessels , who then sent her to trainer Eddie Moreno . Moreno finished her training and sent her to the track for her first race , a 350 @-@ yard ( 320 m ) contest that she won while setting a new track record for a two @-@ year @-@ old of 18 @.@ 1 seconds . Her performance persuaded Jones to relent , and he took her back to his training barn . Her knees would not allow her to be raced often , and she only started once more as a two @-@ year @-@ old , a 220 @-@ yard ( 200 m ) race at Bay Meadows Racetrack that she won while equaling the track record of 17 @.@ 2 seconds for the distance . 
 After an 11 @-@ month break , Chicado V returned to the track as a three @-@ year @-@ old , but her legs continued to create problems . She started four times during her three @-@ year @-@ old year , winning once , with one second and one third place . In her win at Pomona , the site of her first win , she lowered the track record for the 350 @-@ yard ( 320 m ) distance from 18 @.@ 1 to 17 @.@ 9 seconds . Her knees continued to be a problem , and although she never broke down , or became unable to run , she was retired in December 1953 . 
 As a racehorse , Chicado V ran up a record of three wins , one second , and one third , in six starts over two years . She earned a Race Register of Merit in 1952 from the AQHA , the lowest level racing award given by the AQHA , as well as the highest possible speed rating of AAAT , a measure of how fast she was able to run . She was a stakes race winner , or winner of a race run by the higher quality horses , and was given the title of co @-@ Champion Quarter Running Two @-@ Year @-@ Old Filly by the AQHA in 1952 . Her race earnings were $ 5 @,@ 215 ( approximately $ 46 @,@ 100 as of 2016 ) , although the official race record from the AQHA does not list any stakes wins . Many of the early racing records did not make it into the AQHA 's computers , so the lack of stakes wins on the record does not mean that other records recording them are incorrect . 
 = = Broodmare career = = 
 As a broodmare , Chicado V gave birth to nine foals , or babies , between 1955 and 1968 , seven stallions and two mares . Seven earned their Race Register of Merit with the AQHA . Four of her foals — Triple Chick , Three Chicks , The Ole Man , and Chicado Chick — were sired by Three Bars ( TB ) , a member of the AQHA Hall of Fame . Her other five foals were sired by five different stallions , respectively War Bam , Spotted Bull , Anchor Watch , Double Bid , and fellow Hall of Famer Go Man Go . In a 1959 interview , Vessels felt that Chicado V was the best broodmare he owned . Vessels further stated that he " wouldn 't part with her " and that he " would be crazy to sell her " . 
 Chicado V 's first foal was Triple Chick , who was fathered by Three Bars , a 1955 brown stallion . Triple Chick was unraced , but he remains number 48 on the AQHA 's All Time Leading <unk> Sire List By Winners , a listing of maternal grandsires of race horses arranged by the number of wins their <unk> , or grandchildren , have won as of the end of 2007 . Her next foal was War Chic , a 1956 sorrel stallion , who was rated AAAT on the racetrack . He was also a stakes winner , and won 12 out of 21 starts with earnings of $ 35 @,@ 453 ( approximately $ 280 @,@ 700 as of 2016 ) . War Chic was named Champion Two @-@ Year Old Colt in 1958 . Chicado V 's next foal was a mare , named Table Tennis , who won two stakes races , as well as eight other races , out of 35 starts , with an AAAT rating and $ 35 @,@ 197 ( approximately $ 278 @,@ 700 as of 2016 ) . She was named Champion Three Year Old Filly in 1960 . Chicado V 's fourth foal was Three Chicks , a 1959 brown stallion , and a full sibling to Triple Chick . Three Chicks won two stakes races , along with one other race in ten starts . He was rated AAAT on the track as well as earning an AQHA Champion award in the show ring after his racing career was over . His total race earnings were $ 22 @,@ 625 ( approximately $ 174 @,@ 900 as of 2016 ) . Three Chicks remains number 42 on the AQHA 's All Time Leading Broodmare Sires By Winners . 
 In 1960 , Chicado V foaled Chicado Chick , a bay stallion , another full sibling to Three Chicks and Triple Chick . Chicado Chick started 11 times on the track , winning twice for $ 1 @,@ 752 ( approximately $ 13 @,@ 200 as of 2016 ) in race earnings along with an AAA speed rating , the second highest speed rating possible at the time . He also earned a Performance Register of Merit and an AQHA Championship from the AQHA as a show horse after his racing career was over . The 1961 foal was Anchor Chic , a bay stallion . Anchor Chic started 16 times , with three wins for total earnings of $ 2 @,@ 126 ( approximately $ 16 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) and an AAAT speed rating . Chicado V had no foal in 1962 , but in 1963 , she foaled The Ole Man , a sorrel stallion and another full sibling to Triple Chick , Three Chicks and Chicado Chick . The Ole Man won two stakes races as well as 6 other races in 33 starts . He earned an AAAT speed rating and $ 20 @,@ 657 ( approximately $ 150 @,@ 700 as of 2016 ) total race winnings . The Ole Man remains number 55 on the All Time Leading Broodmare Sires By Winners . Chicado V 's penultimate foal was Successor , a bay stallion who started seven times , but never won a race ; he was rated AA on the track . Chicado V 's last foal , <unk> , was a 1968 bay mare who never raced . 
 Chicado V 's foals won seven stakes races for a total prize money of $ 118 @,@ 107 ( approximately $ 803 @,@ 700 as of 2016 ) , and two earned AQHA Championships . Table Tennis went on to become an outstanding broodmare herself , foaling Rapid Volley by Three Bars ( TB ) , among others . Rapid Volley produced Perks by Easy Jet . Perks was another outstanding broodmare who continued the maternal family success , but it was as a dam of stallions that Chicado V is best known ; three of her sons — Triple Chick , Three Chicks , and The Ole Man — became leading race sires . Triple Chick not only sired race horses , but show horses as well , including Boston Mac and Triple 's Image . Three Chicks sired the All American Futurity winner Three Oh 's and the racehorse stallion Azure Three . The Ole Man sired 1 @,@ 876 foals , including 15 stakes winners and 10 AQHA Champions .

 = Adam Eckfeldt = 
 John Adam Eckfeldt ( June 15 , 1769 – February 6 , 1852 ; usually Adam Eckfeldt ) was a worker and official in the early days of the United States Mint . A lifelong Philadelphian , Eckfeldt served as the second chief coiner of the Mint , from 1814 until 1839 . 
 Eckfeldt 's father owned a large smithy and involved himself in early attempts at American coinage . Adam Eckfeldt built early presses for the Mint , engraved some of its early dies , and was responsible for the designs of early American copper coinage , as well as the 1792 half disme which some authorities consider the first United States coin . He was appointed assistant coiner of the Mint in 1796 , and became chief coiner on his predecessor 's death in 1814 . 
 Eckfeldt served a quarter century as chief coiner , during which time the Philadelphia Mint moved to new premises . As he set aside unusual coins brought in as bullion , he started the Mint 's coin cabinet , which evolved into the National Numismatic Collection . Even after his 1839 retirement , Eckfeldt continued to perform the duties of chief coiner ; his death in 1852 caused his replacement , Franklin Peale , to seek an assistant . 
 = = Early life = = 
 John Adam Eckfeldt was born in Philadelphia on June 15 , 1769 , the son of John Jacob Eckfeldt , a large @-@ scale manufacturer of edge @-@ tools and implements . At the time , it was common for those of German descent to bear the name " John " but be referred to by middle name . The elder Eckfeldt and his wife Maria Magdalena had immigrated from Nuremberg , Bavaria , around 1764 . John Jacob Eckfeldt , in his large smithy , made dies for the 1783 coinage under the Articles of Confederation authorized by Philadelphia financier Robert Morris . Adam was his father 's apprentice , and was skilled in iron work and machinery . 
 = = Coin designer and Mint official = = 
 During Eckfeldt 's childhood , the thirteen British colonies along the Atlantic coast of what is now the United States revolted , and so the United States of America secured its independence . After the United States Constitution was ratified , Congress and many government offices came to be housed in Philadelphia , including the newborn Mint of the United States . Adam Eckfeldt built the first screw press for the new facility in 1792 , the same year that the Mint Act of 1792 was passed by Congress authorizing a mint , and cut the obverse die for the experimental Birch cent of that year . He also built other machinery for the Mint , and helped superintend the early coining . 
 In 1792 , the Mint acquired three balances from Eckfeldt , who also lent the Mint his lathe ( used for turning dies ) . Eckfeldt is believed to have made the die from which the 1792 half disme , considered by some the first official U.S. coin , was struck — in 1829 , a visitor to the Mint met Eckfeldt and later described him as " an artist [ who ] made the first die used in it " . Other later accounts document Eckfeldt 's role in this striking : an 1863 auction sold a half disme supposedly given by Eckfeldt to demonstrate his work . Eckfeldt is given as the source for the tradition that the half dismes were struck at the request of President George Washington to be used as presents . Eckfeldt operated his screw press to strike these roughly 1 @,@ 500 pieces on July 13 , 1792 . Since the first Philadelphia Mint was still under construction at the time , these coins were produced in the cellar of John Harper , saw maker , at Sixth and Cherry Streets in Philadelphia . In his annual message to Congress late that year , Washington noted the ongoing construction of a mint building and stated : " There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of half dismes , the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention to them . " 
 Eckfeldt also produced a pattern disme , of which only a few were struck . When the Mint 's first cents ( produced in 1793 ) were found to be excessively crude and attracted public ridicule , Eckfeldt was called upon to design replacements . He placed a wreath on the back of the cent instead of the original chain , and placed a trefoil under Liberty 's head on the obverse . He also engraved the first half cent dies later the same year . 
 Eckfeldt continued to work intermittently for the Philadelphia Mint ; in 1793 , he built a device for automatically feeding planchets into the die collar and ejecting the struck coins , and the mint 's records reveal that he did piecework there in July 1795 . By October 1795 he was on the mint 's payroll , as a die forger and turner , at a salary of $ 500 per year . On January 1 , 1796 , Mint Director Elias Boudinot appointed him as assistant coiner , with the consent of President Washington . His duties in that capacity were broad . 
 In 1805 , at Boudinot 's request , Eckfeldt eliminated a security problem for the Mint by renting two houses adjacent to its operations , allowing it to shut an internal alley to public access . The following year , new Mint Director Robert Patterson requested a pay increase of $ 200 for Eckfeldt , writing to President Thomas Jefferson that Eckfeldt had " the management of the whole coining department " . When the dies used proved too brittle and cracked easily , Eckfeldt came up with the idea of spraying water on the face of the die so the steel would temper evenly . 
 As a boy , inventor George <unk> Sellers knew Eckfeldt ; as Sellers 's father was partner in a firm which sold machinery to the Mint Bureau , Eckfeldt often dined at his house . In the final years both of the 19th century and of Sellers 's life , he published his memoirs , including memories of the first Philadelphia Mint . He recalled in 1812 peering through a window to see cents coined , and Eckfeldt coming into the room to stop the work at the end of the day . Seeing the young Sellers , he had the boy come in , had him place a cent planchet on the press , and struck it for him . Sellers nearly dropped it because it was so hot , and Eckfeldt reminded him it had been cold when placed in the press . Eckfeldt bade him keep the coin until he learned why the cent had become hot , and then he could spend it on candy . 
 = = Chief coiner = = 
 On the death of the first chief coiner , Henry Voigt , in early 1814 , Eckfeldt was appointed by President James Madison as successor . He served in that capacity for a quarter century . During his tenure , he continued to improve the machinery at the Philadelphia Mint . 
 Eckfeldt set aside " master coins " — coins struck with extra care using new dies and polished planchets . He also put aside interesting foreign coins sent to the mint as bullion . These pieces became the Mint 's Cabinet , or coin collection . To fill gaps in this collection , he used old dies to strike postdated coins . Specialists have discovered that some dies he chose for this purpose had not been used together to strike coins for commerce , thus creating unique specimens . Among the pieces acquired for the Mint was a Brasher doubloon , of which only six are known today . Eckfeldt often spent from his own funds to acquire the coins for the Mint . The collection eventually evolved into the Smithsonian Institution 's National Numismatic Collection . 
 In 1828 , Eckfeldt again became involved in the real estate transactions to expand operations at the Philadelphia Mint . For $ 1 @,@ 000 , he purchased one of the lots he had rented in 1805 . After the mint moved to new premises in the 1830s , Eckfeldt discovered that the lot he had purchased had a cloud , or irregularity , on its title ; he was able to clear it and sold it in 1837 for the same sum for which he had bought it . The new mint building was at Juniper and Chestnut Streets , only six blocks from Eckfeldt 's home at Juniper and Vine . 
 Sellers , in his memoirs , described Eckfeldt as " a man of staunch integrity , a cautious , careful , orderly and painstaking man ; he was not one of the dashing , pushing , inventive mechanics , though under his care many apparently slight improvements were gradually adopted that in the aggregate amounted to a great deal in the economy of working . He was by no means deficient in inventive ability . " Nevertheless , as Eckfeldt aged in the service of the Mint in the late 1820s and into the 1830s , he was reluctant to adopt the innovations being proposed by his fellow Mint officer , Melter and Refiner Franklin Peale . Peale , like Eckfeldt of a mechanical bent , had many suggestions for improvements to the coinage machinery , some of which Eckfeldt adopted . Eckfeldt stated to Sellers , " If Mr. Peale had full swing he would turn everything upside down " . According to Sellers , " the giving up of almost life @-@ long pets that had been Mr. Eckfeldt 's constant care would naturally go hard , and still harder coming from another department , but as improvements gradually crept in and proved their efficiency Mr. Eckfeldt gave full credit where it belonged , and I remember him becoming quite enthusiastic over the labor saving [ in the use of the Contamin portrait lathe ] in duplicating working dies " . 
 In 1833 , Peale was sent on a tour of European mints and came home with ideas for new machines and innovations , including the introduction of steam power , used at Britain 's Royal Mint since 1810 on equipment purchased from the firm of Boulton & Watt . Although Eckfeldt would have preferred to apply steam to the existing coin presses , a new one was built for steam power , and commemorative medals were the first pieces struck by steam at the Philadelphia Mint , in early 1836 . 
 In 1839 , Eckfeldt retired after 25 years as chief coiner and over forty as a Mint employee . His fellow officers at the Mint presented him with a gold medal , with silver and bronze duplicates also struck . The obverse was designed by Philadelphia engraver Moritz Fuerst , who sometimes did work for the Mint ; the reverse may be by Fuerst or by Peale . Eckfeldt recommended Peale as his successor , and Peale was appointed . Nevertheless , Eckfeldt continued to perform the functions of chief coiner without pay until a few days before his death on February 6 , 1852 . After Eckfeldt 's death , Peale , wrote what Taxay terms a " frantic letter " to Mint Director George N. Eckert , seeking the appointment of an assistant . Peale had spent the freed @-@ up time designing and selling medals for private gain . 
 = = Private and family life = = 
 Eckfeldt married twice . No children were born of his brief first marriage in 1792 to Maria Hahn , which ended with her death ; his second marriage to Margaretta Bausch produced six children . Among them were his daughter Susanna , who married William Ewing DuBois , first curator of the Mint 's coin collection . Jacob Reese Eckfeldt , one of Adam 's sons , was for forty years ( 1832 – 1872 ) Assayer of the United States Mint . Jacob 's son Jacob Branch Eckfeldt exceeded both forebears in time of service , working at the Mint for 64 years , from 1865 to 1929 . 
 Adam Eckfeldt had a taste for horticulture and owned rural property in Upper Darby , Pennsylvania , which was inherited by his two sons after his death . He was the first president of the Good Will Fire Company , holding that office for nearly all of his adult life , and designed a system of levers for use in fire engines . A member of Concordia Lodge No. 67 of the Masonic Order from 1795 to 1806 , he served as lodge master in 1803 ; a Chinese export porcelain punch bowl with his name and Masonic symbols survives in the Philadelphia Museum of Art . A biographical sketch of Eckfeldt , published in 1897 , describes him : 
 He was a man of large information on many subjects , possessed an inventive genius , and was enabled to introduce some excellent improvements in minting processes . He was singularly industrious and energetic , and for his social qualities and uprightness was universally respected , and , indeed , beloved by the officers associated with him and the extended circle of his acquaintance . 
 = John Brooks ( governor ) = 
 John Brooks ( baptized May 4 , 1752 – March 1 , 1825 ) was a doctor , military officer , and politician from Massachusetts . He served as the 11th Governor of Massachusetts from 1816 to 1823 , and was one of the last Federalist officials elected in the United States . 
 Trained as a doctor , Brooks was an officer of the Reading , Massachusetts militia when the American Revolutionary War broke out , and led his troops in the Battles of Lexington and Concord . He served under George Washington in the New York and New Jersey campaign of 1776 , although he missed the Battle of Trenton due to illness . In 1777 he was part of the relief force for the Siege of Fort Stanwix , and led a successful assault against British positions in the key Second Battle of Saratoga . He played a significant role in the 1783 Newburgh Conspiracy , in which he helped quash ideas of mutiny in the Continental Army . 
 After the war he returned to medical practice , but continued to be active in the state militia , helping to put down Shays ' Rebellion in 1787 . He served in the militia during the War of 1812 , after which he was elected governor . Brooks was popular and politically moderate , and came to personify the " Era of Good Feelings " that followed the war . He retired in 1823 , and died two years later . 
 = = Early years = = 
 John Brooks was born in Medford , Massachusetts , the son of Caleb and Ruth <unk> Brooks , who were local farmers , and was baptized on May 4 , 1752 . After education in the local schools , Brooks studied medicine with Dr. Simon Tufts alongside Benjamin Thompson . In his free time he engage in military drills with other local boys and carefully watched the maneuvers of British Army troops stationed in nearby Boston . When his apprenticeship with Dr. Tufts ended Brooks established a medical practice in Reading , where he was active in the local militia . 
 = = Revolutionary War service = = 
 When Paul Revere gave the alarm that sparked the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19 , 1775 , Brooks , then 22 and a major in the Reading militia , marched with his unit in response . His troops were among the first to reach Concord as the British took the road back to Boston , and are credited with beginning the running battle that took place . Brooks later described that day as the most difficult of his life . He then joined the Continental Army in May 1775 as a major in Bridge 's Regiment , and was among the troops sent to fortify Breed 's Hill on the night of June 16 – 17 . He missed the next day 's Battle of Bunker Hill , because he was sent by Colonel William Prescott to request reinforcements . He continued to serve in the Siege of Boston , transferring to the 19th Continental Regiment on January 1 , 1776 . One of Brooks ' subordinates in this unit was William Hull , with whom he formed a fast friendship . After the British withdrawal from Boston , Brooks ' regiment next saw action in the October 1776 Battle of White Plains , and was in General George Washington 's retreat across New Jersey afterward . Brooks was ill in camp when the army engaged in the Battle of Trenton on December 26 . On November 1 , 1776 he transferred to the 8th Massachusetts Regiment , where he was promoted to lieutenant colonel . 
 The 8th Massachusetts was among the forces Benedict Arnold led in relief of the Siege of Fort Stanwix in upstate New York , and was present at the Battles of Saratoga . In the second battle on October 7 , 1777 , Brooks gained a reputation for fearlessness in the assault and capture of Hessian fortifications on the British right . In the winter of 1777 – 78 Brooks was at Valley Forge , where he served as a leading drill master under Baron von Steuben . Brooks was temporarily named adjutant to General Charles Lee when the army followed the British across New Jersey in 1778 , engaging them in the Battle of Monmouth . He was transferred to the 7th Massachusetts in November 1778 , and was its lieutenant @-@ colonel commandant until June 12 , 1783 when he resigned . His regiment was involved in garrison duty in New England and the New York City area until the end of his service . 
 Brooks was a Freemason and in 1781 was elected master of Washington Lodge under the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts . Washington Lodge was a " Travelling Lodge " which travelled with the Continental Army . 
 In 1783 Brooks played a prominent role in events concerning army pay arrears and pensions that became known as the Newburgh Conspiracy . He was one of three officers who delivered to the Continental Congress a letter drafted by discontented officers , and participated in hearings in which the army delegation outlined serious issues among the officers at Newburgh , New York . He then carried letters back to the army headquarters , and took part in actions orchestrated by Washington supporters to put down any ideas of mutiny . He was accused , apparently falsely , of informing Washington of the conspiracy ( Washington was tipped off by Alexander Hamilton to anticipate unrest . ) Historian Richard Kohn writes that details are lacking of Brooks ' actions and motivations in the critical days of the conspiracy in February and March 1783 , but describes his role in the affair as " crucial " . 
 In 1783 Brooks became an Original Member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati and served as its first secretary from 1783 to 1786 . In 1810 he became president of the Massachusetts society and in 1811 he became vice president of the national society . He served both offices until his death in 1825 . 
 = = Post @-@ Revolution and War of 1812 = = 
 After the war Brooks returned to medical practice , taking over the office of Dr. Tufts in Medford . He was the first member elected to the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company when it was revived after the Revolution in 1786 . 
 In the militia he rose to the position of major general in command of the Middlesex Division . He commanded the division under Major General Benjamin Lincoln when the Massachusetts Militia put down Shays ' Rebellion in 1787 . That same year , he was elected to a one @-@ year term as captain of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company . He was elected to the state convention that ratified the United States Constitution in 1788 . 
 In 1792 Secretary at War Henry Knox offered Brooks a position as brigadier general in the Legion of the United States , a reorganization of the United States Army headed by General Anthony Wayne . Brooks refused the appointment , which went instead to his friend William Hull . He was elected to a second one @-@ year term as captain of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company in 1794 . 
 He was offered a position as brigadier general in the United States Army by George Washington when war was threatened with France in 1797 , but refused . During the War of 1812 Brooks was the state militia 's adjutant general with the rank of major general . 
 = = Governor of Massachusetts = = 
 Brooks , politically a Federalist , served in the state legislature for a number of years . In 1816 Governor Caleb Strong announced his retirement . The Federalist caucus first chose Harrison Gray Otis as its candidate , but he categorically refused the nomination . The nomination was next offered to Lieutenant Governor William Phillips , Jr . , but he also turned the nomination down because he was not the first choice . The caucus then cast about for other candidates ; Brooks was proposed by House Speaker Timothy Bigelow . He also initially refused the nomination , but was convinced by a committee from the caucus to accept , and won the election . He won reelection annually until 1823 , when he retired from public service . 
 The politics of the state was dominated by Federalists , despite their general decline elsewhere in the nation , in part because Brooks adopted moderate positions that denied the opposition Democratic @-@ Republicans opportunities for vigorous opposition . He included Republicans in patronage appointments , courted Republican politicians on the national level , including President James Monroe , and minimized his association with the Federalist leadership in Massachusetts . Historian Ronald <unk> writes that Brooks " came to personify the non @-@ partisan Era of Good Feelings in Massachusetts . " 
 The Panic of 1819 and the granting of statehood to Maine ( which was until 1820 part of Massachusetts ) introduced fractures in the strong Federalist party system in the state . Dissident Federalists such as Josiah Quincy III joined Republicans in calls for a constitutional convention , citing the state constitution 's requirement that Maine be allocated representation in the legislature as a reason . Brooks lobbied against the idea , arguing that the legislature could draft proposed amendments , but a convention was held despite his efforts . Nine amendments produced by the convention were eventually approved , but Federalist leaders managed to block most of the substantive reforms that had been sought . One of the consequences of the panic was the rise , particularly in Boston , of a political faction known as the " <unk> Interest " . This group was composed of primarily working class men who were unhappy with the state party 's elitist leadership . Led by Josiah Quincy , the split would eventually lead to the final collapse of Federalism in the state . 
 Brooks announced in 1822 that he would not seek reelection in 1823 . The 1823 election saw the victory of Republican William Eustis over Federalist party leader Harrison Gray Otis . Otis almost did not carry Boston , and lost other Federalist strongholds in the state . 
 Brooks was a leading member of the Massachusetts Medical Society for many years , serving as its president after his retirement from politics , and was also president of the Bible Society of Massachusetts . He was also president of the Society of the Cincinnati for many years , and was involved in the Washington Monument Association and the Bunker Hill Monument Association . 
 Governor Brooks died in Medford on March 1 , 1825 , and was buried in Medford 's Salem Street Burying Ground , where the family grave is marked by a large obelisk erected in his honor . 
 = = Family and legacy = = 
 In 1774 Brooks married Lucy Smith , with whom he had five children ; two of them died young . His two sons were both active in the United States military . One his sons , Marine Corps First Lieutenant John Brooks , Jr . , was killed in action at the Battle of Lake Erie in 1813 . His other son , Alexander Scammel Brooks , was a lieutenant colonel in the Army and was killed in steamboat explosion in Florida in 1836 . 
 The Maine towns of Brooks , established in 1816 , and Brooksville , founded in 1817 , were named for him .

 The A215 is an A road in South London , from Elephant and Castle to Shirley . It runs through the London Boroughs of Lambeth , Southwark and Croydon . 
 Beginning as Walworth Road , the A215 becomes Camberwell Road — much of which is a conservation area — after entering the former Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell . Crossing the A202 , the A215 becomes Denmark Hill , originally known as Dulwich Hill , but renamed in 1683 to commemorate the marriage of Princess Anne ( later Queen Anne ) to Prince George of Denmark . After passing Herne Hill railway station the road becomes Norwood Road , Knights Hill , and then Beulah Hill at its crossroads with the A214 . Beulah Hill was the site of Britain 's first independent television transmitter , built by the Independent Television Authority in 1955 . Descending towards South Norwood the A215 becomes South Norwood Hill and then Portland Road , just after crossing the A213 . A short section starting at the junction with Woodside Green is known as Spring Lane , leading to Shirley Road , the final section into Shirley , Croydon .

 At its northernmost point at Elephant & Castle in Newington , the A215 begins as Walworth Road , which runs between Elephant and Castle and Camberwell Road . It runs through Walworth and is the major shopping street of the area . East Street Market is especially busy on Fridays , Saturdays and Sundays . Other attractions include the Cuming Museum , Newington Reference Library and John Smith House , a former Labour Party headquarters which is now used by the local education authority . 
 Charles Babbage , the Victorian mathematician and computer pioneer , was probably born at 44 Crosby Row , now Larcom Street , Walworth Road on 26 December 1791 . A commemorative blue plaque is displayed on the Sexual Health Clinic at the junction of Larcom Street and Walworth Road . 
 Just off the Walworth Road was Walworth Road railway station on the London , Chatham and Dover Railway that was opened in 1863 and shut in 1916 due to wartime constraints .

 Walworth Road transitions into Camberwell Road where the A215 enters the former Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell . The road runs adjacent to the railway between Elephant & Castle tube station and Loughborough Junction railway station . Much of Camberwell Road is a conservation area , due to its well preserved large houses from the early 19th century . 
 By the time of the Domesday Book , Camberwell was already a significant settlement . The town remained a popular resort for Londoners due to its believed medicinal wells . In 1685 , John Evelyn 's Diary mentions a Roman urn filled with bones which was uncovered intact during repairs to the road and exhibited at the Royal Society . 
 Camberwell Green , at the junction of Camberwell Road and Camberwell Church Street , was the traditional site of Camberwell Fair , an annual fair held every August . Following complaints about the noise and high crime levels generated by the fair , a group of residents bought the fairground in 1855 , converting it into the park which remains today . 
 In Victorian times Camberwell Road was a focal point of South London 's Music hall scene , with a number of music halls opening from the 1850s onwards . Following the advent of the cinema and later of television , the music halls fell into decline , with the last closing in 1956 . Nearby Orpheus Street marks the site of the Metropole Music Hall . 
 Since the New Works Programme of the 1930s , London Transport and its successors have planned to extend the Bakerloo line south to a station on Camberwell Road . The original plans were abandoned due to the war before much construction had been completed . Construction again began in the 1950s and 1970s , but was abandoned each time . Transport for London still intend to build this extension but no date has been set for this . 
 = = Denmark Hill = = 
 After the A215 crosses the A202 it becomes Denmark Hill . This road was originally known as Dulwich Hill , and was renamed in 1683 to commemorate the marriage of Princess Anne ( later Queen Anne ) to Prince George of Denmark . The road runs between Kings College Hospital and The Maudsley Hospital before going alongside Ruskin Park . Further south the road passes the Denmark Hill Estate . 
 The Victorian art critic , author and social critic John Ruskin lived at 163 Denmark Hill from 1842 to 1871 . The house no longer stands and is now the site of a block of council flats . Ruskin Park , immediately south of the twin hospitals , is named in his honour . 
 Denmark Hill is home to two of London 's largest hospitals , the general King 's College Hospital ( part of King 's College London ) which moved to the site from its original central London location in 1913 , and the Maudsley psychiatric hospital . 
 It is believed by historians that 168 , 170 and 172 Denmark Hill were designed by noted architect and prison designer William Blackburn due their similarity in architectural style to his other buildings . However , as the original documentation relating to the construction of these houses has been lost or destroyed , it has proved impossible to confirm this . 
 Immediately south of the Maudsley Hospital is Denmark Hill railway station , built in 1866 and rebuilt following fire in 1980 , on the South London Line . This station forms part of the East London Line westward extension to Clapham Junction as part of the London Overground network . 
 = = Herne Hill = = 
 The road continues southwest into Herne Hill , a short stretch of road running through the area of the same name . The origin of the name is disputed but possibly derives from herons nesting on the ( now buried ) River Effra . The earliest known usage of the name " Herne Hill " dates from 1798 . 
 St Paul 's church was rebuilt in dramatic style by the gothic architect George Edmund Street in 1858 . 
 Herne Hill railway station is at the southern end of Herne Hill , on a busy six @-@ road junction . It opened in 1862 and was initially the southern terminus of the London , Chatham and Dover Railway 
 = = Norwood Road = = 
 Norwood Road begins after Herne Hill railway station . It runs alongside Brockwell Park and then south to Tulse Hill . A manor house known as " <unk> " or " <unk> " ( the origin of the name " Brockwell " ) was built on Norwood Road , on what is now a part of Brockwell Park , in the mid @-@ 15th century . In 1809 the building was bought by wealthy merchant and Sheriff of London John Blades . Blades demolished the building , and built Brockwell Hall as a replacement at the top of the hill in the park ; this building still stands today . 
 Tulse Hill railway station is on this road . After passing the station , Norwood Road continues south past West Norwood Cemetery ( home of 65 Listed Monuments ) to West Norwood and the Norwood Triangle . Norwood Road is home to St Luke 's Church , a Grade II listed building designed by Francis Octavius Bedford in 1823 – 5 and rebuilt by GE Street in 1870 . 
 The Regal Cinema opened on Norwood Road in January 1930 ; it was unusual in that it also staged live stage shows to accompany films ( including performances by animals from circuses visiting the nearby park ) . It was home to the Regal Redheads , a troupe of dancing girls who performed in the interval . 
 = = Knights Hill and Norwood High Street = = 
 Knights Hill starts in the north at West Norwood in the Norwood Triangle one @-@ way system , and runs through a council ward also named as Knight 's Hill . It ends in the south at a junction with the A214 at Crown Lane and Crown Dale . Knights Hill becomes Beulah Hill here at Crown Point . To the north , south of Knight 's Hill is the part of the Crystal Palace area with no name home to a large parade of competing large super markets along the A215 Norwood Road including Tesco , Cooperative , Iceland and ( by Summer 2009 ) Sainsbury ( ex Woolworth 's site ) . West Norwood railway station is on this road . Knights Hill contains the Knights Hill Nature Reserve , one of the last remaining vestiges of the Great North Wood which once covered the area . 
 The 1647 Parliamentary Survey described Knights Hill as " a small common wood containing 40 <unk> oaks and two elms " . 
 = = Beulah Hill = = 
 Beulah Hill ( originally " Gravel Pit Road " ) begins at a crossroads where the A215 crosses the A214 and Knights Hill becomes Beulah Hill . The road makes a sharp turn to the east where it continues through the neighbourhoods of Upper Norwood . On the sharp bend is the ornamental Beulah Hill Pond . Formerly " Big Pond " , it was intended as a watering stop for horses and cattle using the road , and still contains a railing to prevent animals straying into deep water . The " Conquering Hero " pub was built next to the pond for the use of people stopping to allow livestock to use the pond , and remains today . 
 Nearby is St Joseph 's College founded in 1855 , one of the first Catholic educational institutions to be opened in England following the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy . Beulah Hill was the site of Britain 's first independent television transmitter , built by the Independent Television Authority in 1955 . Beulah Hill ends at a junction with the A212 ( Church Road ) . From this junction , the A215 is called South Norwood Hill . 
 = = South Norwood Hill = = 
 South Norwood Hill descends sharply towards South Norwood . It becomes Portland Road at the crossroads with the A213 road . No longer hidden from view by the Esso petrol station , which was demolished in 2009 , is the famous Spurgeon 's College , a theological college which since 1923 has been located in a mansion built in 1890 and known as Falkland Park . The former porter 's lodge of the Falkland Park estate still stands along South Norwood Hill as no . 217 , " Falkland Lodge " . Otherwise this section is mainly residential . 
 = = Portland Road = = 
 Portland Road begins at a crossroads where the A215 crosses the A213 on South Norwood High Street and South Norwood Hill becomes Portland Road . The road then travels down a hill with many shops ( mainly takeaways , newsagents ) . It passes South Norwood Leisure Centre , a new leisure centre which includes a creche , cafe , gym , swimming pool etc . Portland Road ends with a left turn to stay on the A215 at Spring Lane or straight on to change onto the <unk> , Woodside Green . From June 2010 , the road will be the site of a station on the new London Overground network . 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 The northern section of the road was historically known as " <unk> " or " The Goat House " . The Minister 's of Bailiffs Account of the <unk> of St Nicholas show that an annual rent of 33 shillings and four pence was paid on the land between 1442 – 1483 ; this is the earliest recorded reference to the area . The road at the time ran through an ancient woodland known as the North Wood ( the origin of the modern place name Norwood ) . The area was cleared for farmland in the 16th and 17th centuries . Industrial development began in the early 19th century following construction of the Grand Surrey Canal , linking the area to Surrey Commercial Docks and the River Thames in 1809 . This section of the canal was closed in 1836 , with the London and Croydon Railway built along the canal bed ; modern housing development began in the mid @-@ 19th century following the opening of the railway . 
 = = = Jolly @-@ sailor station and the London & Croydon Railway = = = 
 In 1839 the London and Croydon Railway opened Jolly @-@ sailor station ( sic ) — listed as " Jolly @-@ sailor near Beulah Spa " on fares lists and timetables — at the north end of the street . The station was renamed Norwood in 1846 . The station was immediately adjacent to a level crossing over Portland Road . 
 In 1844 , the London and Croydon Railway was given parliamentary authority to test an experimental pneumatic propulsion system on the railway ( referred to at the time as the atmospheric @-@ propulsion system ) . A pumping station was built on Portland Road ; this created a vacuum in a pipe paralleling the railway tracks . A piston extended downwards from the trains into a slit in the pipe , meaning that trains were literally sucked towards the pumping station or blown away from it . The pumping station was built in a Gothic style , with a very tall ornate tower which served both as a chimney and as an exhaust vent for air pumped from the propulsion pipe . 
 As part of the construction works for the atmospheric @-@ propulsion system , the world 's first railway flyover was constructed at the north end of Portland Road , to carry the new atmospheric line over the conventional steam line below . In 1847 , the atmospheric propulsion experiment was abandoned . 
 Following construction of new lines , the station closed on 1 June 1859 and was replaced by a new station on the south side of the road , Norwood Junction , which is still in use , now part of the newly @-@ extended East London Line of the London Overground which was opened on 23 May 2010 . 
 = = = Places of interest = = = 
 One of the earliest cinemas in South London , the Electric Picture Palace , opened on Portland Road in 1910 . The cinema was renamed the Central Cinema shortly afterwards , and closed in 1956 , and no trace of it now remains . 
 Portland Road is also home to the " Gold Coast " , the only Ghanaian public house in London ; this is a focal point for London 's Ghanaian community and serves Ghanaian beer , wine and food . 
 Roots , Routes , Roots ( also known as the " Portland Road Mosaic " ) , an 11 @-@ metre ( 36 ft ) long mosaic depicting the history of the Norwood area , is under the railway bridge . The mosaic was designed by artists Gary <unk> and Rob Turner , and built by children from a number of local schools . 
 = = Spring Lane = = 
 Spring Lane is a short road that starts at the junction with Woodside Green . It lies entirely within Woodside . St Luke 's Church , Ashburton Park , Ashburton Primary School and Woodside tram stop are on this road . 
 Spring Lane was notable for many years in having one of the few Ancient lights notices in London outside central London , on a private house immediately opposite the station . The sign was taken down in 2005 . 
 = = = Woodside tram stop = = = 
 Woodside railway station was built in 1871 to serve Croydon Racecourse ( see below ) . The station was unusual in being designed for horses , with access ramps instead of steps and with unusually high entrances designed to accommodate a horse and rider . In 1997 the railway was replaced by Tramlink ; the station is now Woodside tram stop . 
 = = Shirley Road = = 
 Shirley Road is the final road on the A215 . It is home to Ashburton Community School and Trinity School of John Whitgift . It ends in Shirley , Croydon . Shirley Road skirts the nearby suburb of Addiscombe . The town is named after the historic manor of <unk> ( " Edge of the valley " ) , the country seat of the Heron family , which was situated on Shirley Road . The building no longer exists . 
 = = = Ashburton Playing Fields = = = 
 Ashburton Playing Fields are just off Shirley Road , behind the school . The fields were first dedicated as a public horse racing course by James I in the early 17th century . Following the opening of the nearby Woodside railway station in 1871 large numbers of Londoners began travelling to the racecourse . Following pressure from the Mayor of Croydon , concerned about the large crowds , the racecourse was closed in 1890 and replaced with a golf course ; this was bought by the council in 1942 and given to public use as playing fields . 
 = Clint Eastwood = 
 Clinton " Clint " Eastwood Jr . ( born May 31 , 1930 ) is an American actor , film director , producer , musician , and political figure . He rose to international fame with his role as the Man with No Name in Sergio Leone 's Dollars trilogy of spaghetti Westerns during the 1960s , and as antihero cop Harry Callahan in the five Dirty Harry films throughout the 1970s and 1980s . These roles , among others , have made Eastwood an enduring cultural icon of masculinity . 
 For his work in the Western film Unforgiven ( 1992 ) and the sports drama Million Dollar Baby ( 2004 ) , Eastwood won Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture , as well as receiving nominations for Best Actor . Eastwood 's greatest commercial successes have been the adventure comedy Every Which Way But Loose ( 1978 ) and its sequel , the action comedy Any Which Way You Can ( 1980 ) , after adjustment for inflation . Other popular films include the Western Hang ' Em High ( 1968 ) , the psychological thriller Play Misty for Me ( 1971 ) , the crime film Thunderbolt and Lightfoot ( 1974 ) , the Western The Outlaw Josey Wales ( 1976 ) , the prison film Escape from Alcatraz ( 1979 ) , the action film Firefox ( 1982 ) , the suspense thriller Tightrope ( 1984 ) , the Western Pale Rider ( 1985 ) , the war film Heartbreak Ridge ( 1986 ) , the action thriller In the Line of Fire ( 1993 ) , the romantic drama The Bridges of Madison County ( 1995 ) , and the drama Gran Torino ( 2008 ) . 
 In addition to directing many of his own star vehicles , Eastwood has also directed films in which he did not appear , such as the mystery drama Mystic River ( 2003 ) and the war film Letters from Iwo Jima ( 2006 ) , for which he received Academy Award nominations , and the drama Changeling ( 2008 ) . The war drama biopic American Sniper ( 2014 ) set box office records for the largest January release ever and was also the largest opening ever for an Eastwood film . 
 Eastwood received considerable critical praise in France for several films , including some that were not well received in the United States . Eastwood has been awarded two of France 's highest honors : in 1994 he became a recipient of the Commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres , and in 2007 he was awarded the Légion d 'honneur medal . In 2000 , Eastwood was awarded the Italian Venice Film Festival Golden Lion for lifetime achievement . 
 Since 1967 , Eastwood has run his own production company , Malpaso , which has produced all except four of his American films . From 1986 – 88 , Eastwood served as Mayor of Carmel @-@ by @-@ the @-@ Sea , California , a non @-@ partisan office . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Eastwood was born in San Francisco , California , the son of Clinton Eastwood Sr. ( 1906 – 1970 ) and his wife , Margaret Ruth ( née Runner ) Eastwood ( 1909 – 2006 ) . He was nicknamed " Samson " by the hospital nurses because he weighed 11 pounds 6 ounces ( 5 @.@ 2 kg ) at birth . He has a younger sister , Jeanne ( born 1934 ) . Eastwood 's widowed mother later married a retired lumber executive , John Belden Wood ( 1913 – 2004 ) , who became stepfather to Clint and Jeanne . 
 Eastwood is of English , Irish , Scottish , and Dutch ancestry and was raised in a working class environment . Eastwood is descended from Mayflower passenger William Bradford and through this line is the 12th generation of his family born in North America and the 13th generation to live in North America . 
 His family moved often as his father worked at jobs along the West Coast . They finally settled in Piedmont , California , where Eastwood attended Piedmont Junior High School . Shortly before he was to enter Piedmont High School , he rode his bike on the school 's sports field and tore up the wet turf ; this resulted in his being asked not to enroll . Instead , he attended Oakland Technical High School , where the drama teachers encouraged him to take part in school plays . However , Eastwood was not interested . He worked at a number of jobs , including lifeguard , paper carrier , grocery clerk , forest firefighter , and golf caddy . 
 In 1951 , Eastwood enrolled at Seattle University but was then drafted into the United States Army and assigned to Fort Ord in California , where he was appointed as a lifeguard and swimming instructor . While returning from a weekend visit to his parents in Seattle , Washington , he was a passenger on a Douglas AD bomber that ran out of fuel and crashed into the ocean near Point Reyes . Escaping from the sinking aircraft , he and the pilot swam 3 miles ( 5 km ) to safety .

 = = = 1950s : Early career struggles = = = 
 According to the CBS press release for Rawhide , the Universal ( known then as Universal @-@ International ) film company was shooting in Fort Ord when an enterprising assistant spotted Eastwood and invited him to meet the director . According to Eastwood 's official biography , the key figure was a man named Chuck Hill , who was stationed in Fort Ord and had contacts in Hollywood . While in Los Angeles , Hill became reacquainted with Eastwood and managed to sneak Eastwood into a Universal studio , where he showed him to cameraman Irving <unk> . <unk> arranged for an audition under Arthur Lubin , who , although very impressed with Clint 's appearance and stature at 6 ' 4 " ( 193 cm ) , disapproved initially of his acting skills , remarking , " He was quite amateurish . He didn 't know which way to turn or which way to go or do anything " . Lubin suggested that he attend drama classes and arranged for Eastwood 's initial contract in April 1954 , at $ 100 per week . After signing , Eastwood was initially criticized for his stiff manner and delivering his lines through his teeth , a lifelong trademark . 
 In May 1954 , Eastwood made his first real audition for Six Bridges to Cross but was rejected by Joseph Pevney . After many unsuccessful auditions , he was eventually given a minor role by director Jack Arnold in Revenge of the Creature , a sequel to the recently released The Creature from the Black Lagoon . In September 1954 , Eastwood worked for three weeks on Arthur Lubin 's Lady Godiva of Coventry , won a role in February 1955 , playing " Jonesy " , a sailor in Francis in the Navy and appeared uncredited in another Jack Arnold film , Tarantula , where he played a squadron pilot . In May 1955 , Eastwood put four hours ' work into the film Never Say Goodbye and had a minor uncredited role as a ranch hand ( his first western film ) in August 1955 with Law Man , also known as Stars in the Dust . Universal presented him with his first television role on July 2 , 1955 , on NBC 's Allen in Movieland , which starred Tony Curtis and Benny Goodman . Although he continued to develop as an actor , Universal terminated his contract on October 23 , 1955 . 
 Eastwood joined the Marsh Agency , and although Lubin landed him his biggest role to date in The First Traveling <unk> ( 1956 ) and later hired him for Escapade in Japan , without a formal contract Eastwood was struggling . Upon the advice of Irving Leonard , his financial advisor , he changed talent agencies to the <unk> @-@ <unk> Agency in 1956 and Mitchell Gertz in 1957 . He landed several small roles in 1956 as a temperamental army officer for a segment of ABC 's Reader 's Digest series , and as a motorcycle gang member on a Highway Patrol episode . In 1957 , Eastwood played a cadet in West Point series , played a suicidal gold prospector in Death Valley Days . In 1958 , he played a Navy lieutenant in a segment of Navy Log and in early 1959 made a notable guest appearance on Maverick opposite James Garner as a cowardly villain intent on marrying a rich girl for money . Eastwood had a small part as an aviator in the French picture Lafayette Escadrille and played a major role as an ex @-@ renegade of the Confederacy in Ambush at Cimarron Pass , a film which Eastwood viewed disastrously and professes to be the lowest point of his career . 
 In 1958 , Eastwood was cast as Rowdy Yates for the CBS hour @-@ long western series Rawhide , the breakthrough in his career he had long been searching for . However , Eastwood was not especially happy with his character ; Eastwood was almost 30 , and Rowdy was too young and too <unk> for Clint to feel comfortable with the part . Filming began in Arizona in the summer of 1958 . It took just three weeks for Rawhide to reach the top 20 in TV ratings and although it never won an Emmy , it was a major success for several years , and reached its peak at number six in the ratings between October 1960 and April 1961 . The Rawhide years ( 1959 – 65 ) were some of the most grueling of Eastwood 's career , often filming six days a week for an average of twelve hours a day , yet he still received criticism by some directors for not working hard enough . By late 1963 Rawhide was beginning to decline in popularity and lacked freshness in the script ; it was canceled in the middle of the 1965 – 66 television season . Eastwood made his first attempt at directing when he filmed several trailers for the show , although he was unable to convince producers to let him direct an episode . In the show 's first season Eastwood earned $ 750 an episode . At the time of Rawhide 's cancellation , he received $ 119 @,@ 000 an episode as severance pay . 
 = = = 1960s = = = 
 In late 1963 , Eastwood 's co @-@ star on Rawhide , Eric Fleming , rejected an offer to star in an Italian @-@ made western called A Fistful of Dollars , to be directed in a remote region of Spain by the then relatively unknown Sergio Leone . Richard Harrison suggested Eastwood to Leone because Harrison knew Eastwood could play a cowboy convincingly . Eastwood thought the film would be an opportunity to escape from his Rawhide image . Eastwood signed a contract for $ 15 @,@ 000 in wages for eleven weeks ' work , with a bonus of a Mercedes automobile upon completion . Eastwood later spoke of the transition from a television western to A Fistful of Dollars : " In Rawhide I did get awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat . The hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody . I decided it was time to be an anti @-@ hero . " Eastwood was instrumental in creating the Man with No Name character 's distinctive visual style and , although a non @-@ smoker , Leone insisted Eastwood smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the " mask " he was attempting to create for the loner character . 
 A Fistful of Dollars proved a landmark in the development of spaghetti Westerns , with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns , and challenging American stereotypes of a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero . The film 's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy and he was re @-@ hired to star in For a Few Dollars More ( 1965 ) , the second of the trilogy . Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano <unk> , the rights to For a Few Dollars More and the final film of the trilogy ( The Good , the Bad and the Ugly ) were sold to United Artists for about $ 900 @,@ 000 . 
 In January 1966 , Eastwood met producer Dino De Laurentiis in New York City and agreed to star in a non @-@ Western five @-@ part anthology production named Le <unk> ( " The Witches " ) opposite De Laurentiis ' wife , actress Silvana Mangano . Eastwood 's nineteen @-@ minute installment took only a few days to shoot , but his performance did not please the critics , one writing that " no other performance of his is quite so ' un @-@ <unk> ' . " Two months later Eastwood began work on the third Dollars film , The Good , the Bad and the Ugly , again playing the mysterious Man with No Name . Lee Van Cleef returned as a ruthless fortune seeker , with Eli Wallach portraying the cunning Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez . The storyline involved the search for a cache of Confederate gold buried in a cemetery . During the filming of a scene in which a bridge was blown up , Eastwood urged Wallach to retreat to a hilltop . " I know about these things , " he said . " Stay as far away from special effects and explosives as you can . " Minutes later confusion among the crew over the word " Vaya ! " resulted in a premature explosion that could have killed Wallach . 
 I wanted to play it with an economy of words and create this whole feeling through attitude and movement . It was just the kind of character I had envisioned for a long time , keep to the mystery and allude to what happened in the past . It came about after the frustration of doing Rawhide for so long . I felt the less he said , the stronger he became and the more he grew in the imagination of the audience . 
 The Dollars trilogy was not released in the United States until 1967 , when A Fistful of Dollars opened in January , followed by For a Few Dollars More in May , and The Good , the Bad and the Ugly on December 29 , 1967 . All the films were commercially successful , particularly The Good , the Bad and the Ugly , which eventually earned $ 8 million in rental earnings and turned Eastwood into a major film star . All three films received bad reviews , and marked the beginning of a battle for Eastwood to win American film critics ' respect . Judith Crist described A Fistful of Dollars as " <unk> , " while Newsweek considered For a Few Dollars More as " excruciatingly dopey . " Renata Adler of The New York Times said The Good , the Bad and the Ugly was " ... the most expensive , pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre . " Time magazine drew attention to the film 's wooden acting , especially on the part of Eastwood , though a few critics such as Vincent Canby and Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised Eastwood 's coolness in playing the tall , lone stranger . Leone 's cinematography was widely acclaimed , even by critics who disparaged the acting in the film . 
 Stardom brought more roles for Eastwood . He signed to star in the American revisionist western Hang ' Em High ( 1968 ) , featured alongside Inger Stevens , Pat Hingle , Dennis Hopper , Ed Begley , Alan Hale , Ben Johnson , Bruce Dern , and James MacArthur , playing a man who takes up a Marshal 's badge and seeks revenge as a lawman after being lynched by vigilantes and left for dead . The film earned Eastwood a fee of $ 400 @,@ 000 and 25 percent of its net box @-@ office takings . Using money earned from the Dollars trilogy , accountant and Eastwood advisor Irving Leonard helped establish Eastwood 's own production company , Malpaso Productions , named after Malpaso Creek on Eastwood 's property in Monterey County , California . Leonard arranged for Hang ' Em High to be a joint production with United Artists ; when it opened in July 1968 , it had the largest opening weekend in United Artists ' history . Hang ' Em High was widely praised by critics , including Archer Winsten of the New York Post , who described it as , " a western of quality , courage , danger and excitement . " 
 Before the release of Hang ' Em High , Eastwood had already begun working on Coogan 's Bluff , about an Arizona deputy sheriff tracking a wanted psychopathic criminal ( Don Stroud ) through the streets of New York City . He was reunited with Universal Studios for it after receiving an offer of $ 1 million — more than double his previous salary . Jennings Lang arranged for Eastwood to meet Don Siegel , a Universal contract director who later became Eastwood 's close friend , forming a partnership that would last more than ten years and produce five films . Shooting began in November 1967 , before the script had been finalized . The film was controversial for its portrayal of violence . Coogan 's Bluff also became the first collaboration with Argentine composer Lalo Schifrin , who would later compose the jazzy score to several Eastwood films in the 1970s and 1980s , including the Dirty Harry films . 
 Eastwood was paid $ 750 @,@ 000 in 1968 for the war epic Where Eagles Dare , about a World War II squad parachuting into a Gestapo stronghold in the alpine mountains . Richard Burton played the squad 's commander , with Eastwood as his right @-@ hand man . Eastwood was also cast as Two @-@ Face in the Batman television show , but the series was canceled before filming began . 
 Eastwood then branched out to star in the only musical of his career , Paint Your Wagon ( 1969 ) . Eastwood and Lee Marvin play gold miners who buy a Mormon settler 's less favored wife ( Jean Seberg ) at an auction . Bad weather and delays plagued the production , while the film 's budget eventually exceeded $ 20 million , which was extremely expensive for the time . The film was not a critical or commercial success , although it was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy . 
 = = = 1970s = = = 
 In 1970 , Eastwood starred with Shirley MacLaine in the western Two Mules for Sister Sara , directed by Don Siegel . The film follows an American mercenary , who gets mixed up with a prostitute disguised as a nun , and ends up helping a group of <unk> rebels during the reign of Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico . Eastwood once again played a mysterious stranger — unshaven , wearing a <unk> @-@ like vest , and smoking a cigar . Although it received moderate reviews , the film is listed in The New York Times Guide to the Best 1 @,@ 000 Movies Ever Made . Later the same year , Eastwood starred as one of a group of Americans who steal a fortune in gold from the Nazis , in the World War II film Kelly 's Heroes , with Donald Sutherland and Telly Savalas . Kelly 's Heroes was the last film Eastwood appeared in that was not produced by his own Malpaso Productions . Filming commenced in July 1969 on location in Yugoslavia and in London . The film received mostly a positive reception and its anti @-@ war sentiments were recognized . In the winter of 1969 – 70 , Eastwood and Siegel began planning his next film , The Beguiled , a tale of a wounded Union soldier , held captive by the sexually repressed matron ( played by Geraldine Page ) of a Southern girl 's school . Upon release the film received major recognition in France and is considered one of Eastwood 's finest works by the French . However , it grossed less than $ 1 million and , according to Eastwood and Lang , flopped due to poor publicity and the " emasculated " role of Eastwood . 
 Eastwood 's career reached a turning point in 1971 . Before Irving Leonard died , he and Eastwood had discussed the idea of Malpaso producing Play Misty for Me , a film that was to give Eastwood the artistic control he desired , and his debut as a director . The script was about a jazz disc jockey named Dave ( Eastwood ) , who has a casual affair with Evelyn ( Jessica Walter ) , a listener who had been calling the radio station repeatedly at night , asking him to play her favorite song – Erroll Garner 's Misty . When Dave ends their relationship , the unhinged Evelyn becomes a murderous stalker . Filming commenced in Monterey in September 1970 and included footage of that year 's Monterey Jazz Festival . The film was highly acclaimed with critics , such as Jay Cocks in Time magazine , Andrew Sarris in the Village Voice , and Archer Winsten in the New York Post all praising the film , as well as Eastwood 's directorial skills and performance . Walter was nominated for a Golden Globe Best Actress Award ( Drama ) , for her performance in the film . 
 I know what you 're thinking – " Did he fire six shots or only five ? " Well , to tell you the truth , in all this excitement , I 've kinda lost track myself . But , being as this is a .44 Magnum , the most powerful handgun in the world and would blow your head clean off , you 've got to ask yourself one question : " Do I feel lucky ? " Well , do you , punk ? 
 Dirty Harry ( 1971 ) , written by Harry and Rita Fink , centers on a hard @-@ edged New York City ( later changed to San Francisco ) police inspector named Harry Callahan who is determined to stop a psychotic killer by any means . Dirty Harry has been described as being arguably Eastwood 's most memorable character , and the film has been credited with inventing the " loose @-@ cannon cop " genre . Author Eric <unk> argues that Eastwood 's role as Dirty Harry established the " first true archetype " of the action film genre . His lines ( quoted right ) are regarded by firearms historians , such as Garry James and Richard Venola , as the force that catapulted the ownership of .44 Magnum revolvers to new heights in the United States ; specifically the Smith & Wesson Model 29 carried by Harry Callahan . Dirty Harry achieved huge success after its release in December 1971 , earning $ 22 million in the United States and Canada alone . It was Siegel 's highest @-@ grossing film and the start of a series of films featuring the character Harry Callahan . Although a number of critics praised Eastwood 's performance as Dirty Harry , such as Jay Cocks of Time magazine who described him as " ... giving his best performance so far , tense , tough , full of implicit identification with his character , " the film was also widely criticized as being fascistic . 
 Following Sean Connery 's announcement that he would not play James Bond again , Eastwood was offered the role but turned it down because he believed the character should be played by an English actor . He next starred in the loner Western Joe Kidd ( 1972 ) , based on a character inspired by <unk> Lopez <unk> , who stormed a courthouse in Tierra Amarilla , New Mexico in June 1967 . During filming , Eastwood suffered symptoms of a bronchial infection and several panic attacks . Joe Kidd received a mixed reception , with Roger Greenspun of The New York Times writing that it was unremarkable , with foolish symbolism and sloppy editing , although he praised Eastwood 's performance . 
 In 1973 , Eastwood directed his first western , High Plains Drifter , in which he also starred . The film had a moral and supernatural theme , later emulated in Pale Rider . The plot follows a mysterious stranger ( Eastwood ) who arrives in a brooding Western town where the people hire him to protect them against three soon @-@ to @-@ be @-@ released felons . There remains confusion during the film as to whether the stranger is the brother of the deputy , whom the felons lynched and murdered , or his ghost . Holes in the plot were filled with black humor and allegory , influenced by Leone . The revisionist film received a mixed reception , but was a major box office success . A number of critics thought Eastwood 's directing was " as derivative as it was expressive , " with Arthur Knight of the Saturday Review remarking that Eastwood had " ... absorbed the approaches of Siegel and Leone and fused them with his own paranoid vision of society . " John Wayne , who had declined a role in the film , sent a letter to Eastwood soon after the film 's release in which he complained that , " The townspeople did not represent the true spirit of the American pioneer , the spirit that made America great . " 
 Eastwood next turned his attention towards Breezy ( 1973 ) , a film about love blossoming between a middle @-@ aged man and a teenage girl . During casting for the film Eastwood met Sondra Locke for the first time , an actress who would play major roles in six of his films over the next ten years and would become an important figure in his life . Kay Lenz got the part of Breezy because Locke , at age 29 , was considered too old . The film , shot very quickly and efficiently by Eastwood and Frank Stanley , came in $ 1 million under budget and was finished three days ahead of schedule . Breezy was not a major critical or commercial success and it was only made available on video in 1998 . 
 Once filming of Breezy had finished , Warners announced that Eastwood had agreed to reprise his role as Callahan in Magnum Force ( 1973 ) , a sequel to Dirty Harry , about a group of rogue young officers ( among them David Soul , Robert Urich and Tim Matheson ) in the San Francisco Police Department who systematically exterminate the city 's worst criminals . Although the film was a major success after release , grossing $ 58 @.@ 1 million in the United States ( a record for Eastwood ) , it was not a critical success . The New York Times critic Nora Sayre panned the often contradictory moral themes of the film , while the paper 's Frank Rich called it " the same old stuff " . 
 In 1974 , Eastwood teamed up with Jeff Bridges and George Kennedy in the buddy action caper Thunderbolt and Lightfoot , a road movie about a veteran bank robber Thunderbolt ( Eastwood ) and a young con man drifter , Lightfoot ( Bridges ) . On its release , in spring 1974 , the film was praised for its offbeat comedy mixed with high suspense and tragedy but was only a modest success at the box office , earning $ 32 @.@ 4 million . Eastwood 's acting was noted by critics , but was overshadowed by Bridges who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor . Eastwood reportedly fumed at the lack of Academy Award recognition for him and swore that he would never work for United Artists again . 
 Eastwood 's next film The Eiger Sanction ( 1975 ) was based on <unk> 's critically acclaimed spy novel of the same name . Eastwood plays Jonathan Hemlock in a role originally intended for Paul Newman , an assassin turned college art professor who decides to return to his former profession for one last " sanction " in return for a rare Pissarro painting . In the process he must climb the north face of the Eiger in Switzerland under perilous conditions . Mike Hoover taught Eastwood how to climb during several weeks of preparation at Yosemite in the summer of 1974 before filming commenced in Grindelwald , Switzerland on August 12 , 1974 . Despite prior warnings about the perils of the Eiger the film crew suffered a number of accidents , including one fatality . Despite the danger , Eastwood insisted on doing all his own climbing and stunts . Upon release in May 1975 The Eiger Sanction was a commercial failure , receiving only $ 23 @.@ 8 million at the box office , and was poorly received by most critics . Joy Gould <unk> of the Wall Street Journal dismissed the film as " brutal fantasy " . Eastwood blamed Universal Studios for the film 's poor promotion and turned his back on them to make an agreement with Warner Brothers , through Frank Wells , that has lasted to the present day . 
 The Outlaw Josey Wales ( 1976 ) , a western inspired by Asa Carter 's 1972 novel of the same name , has lead character Josey Wales ( Eastwood ) as a pro @-@ Confederate guerilla who refuses to surrender his arms after the American Civil War and is chased across the old southwest by a group of enforcers . Eastwood 's costars were Locke ( for the first time ) and Chief Dan George . Director Philip Kaufman was fired by producer Bob Daley under Eastwood 's command , resulting in a fine reported to be around $ 60 @,@ 000 from the Directors Guild of America — who subsequently passed new legislation reserving the right to impose a major fine on a producer for discharging and replacing a director . The film was pre @-@ screened at the Sun Valley Center for the Arts and Humanities in Idaho during a six @-@ day conference entitled Western Movies : Myths and Images . Invited to the screening were a number of esteemed film critics , including Jay Cocks and Arthur Knight ; directors such as King Vidor , William Wyler , and Howard Hawks ; and a number of academics . Upon release in the summer of 1976 The Outlaw Josey Wales was widely acclaimed , with many critics and viewers seeing Eastwood 's role as an iconic one that related to America 's ancestral past and the destiny of the nation after the American Civil War . Roger Ebert compared the nature and vulnerability of Eastwood 's portrayal of Josey Wales with his Man with No Name character in the Dollars westerns and praised the film 's atmosphere . The film would later appear in Time 's " Top 10 Films of the Year " . 
 Eastwood was then offered the role of Benjamin L. Willard in Francis Coppola 's Apocalypse Now , but declined as he did not want to spend weeks on location in the Philippines . He also refused the part of a platoon leader in Ted Post 's Vietnam War film , Go Tell the Spartans and instead decided to make a third Dirty Harry film , The Enforcer . The film had Callahan partnered with a new female officer ( Tyne Daly ) to face a San Francisco Bay area group resembling the Symbionese Liberation Army . The film , culminating in a shootout on Alcatraz island , was considerably shorter than the previous Dirty Harry films at 95 minutes , but was a major commercial success grossing $ 100 million worldwide to become Eastwood 's highest @-@ grossing film to date . 
 In 1977 , he directed and starred in The Gauntlet opposite Locke , Pat Hingle , William Prince , Bill McKinney , and Mara Corday . Eastwood portrays a down @-@ and @-@ out cop assigned to escort a prostitute from Las Vegas to Phoenix to testify against the mafia . Although a moderate hit with the viewing public , critics had mixed feelings about the film , with many believing it was overly violent . Ebert , in contrast , gave the film three stars and called it " ... classic Clint Eastwood : fast , furious , and funny . " The following year , he starred in Every Which Way But Loose in an uncharacteristic offbeat comedy role . He played Philo Beddoe , a trucker and brawler who roams the American West searching for a lost love ( Locke ) accompanied by his brother ( played by Geoffrey Lewis ) and an orangutan called Clyde . The film proved surprisingly successful upon its release and became Eastwood 's most commercially successful film up to that time . Panned by critics , it ranked high among the box office successes of his career and was the second @-@ highest @-@ grossing film of 1978 . 
 Eastwood starred in Escape from Alcatraz in 1979 , the last of his films directed by Siegel . It was based on the true story of Frank Lee Morris who , along with John and Clarence Anglin , escaped from the notorious Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary in 1962 . The film was a major success ; Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic praised it as " crystalline cinema " and Frank Rich of Time described it as " cool , cinematic grace " .

 In 1980 , Eastwood directed and played the title role in Bronco Billy alongside Locke , Scatman Crothers , and Sam Bottoms . Eastwood has cited Bronco Billy as being one of the most relaxed shoots of his career and biographer Richard Schickel has argued that Bronco Billy is Eastwood 's most self @-@ referential character . The film was a rare commercial disappointment in Eastwood 's career , but was liked by critics . Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that film was " ... the best and funniest Clint Eastwood movie in quite a while " , and praised Eastwood 's directing , intricately juxtaposing the old West and the new West . Later that year , Eastwood starred in Any Which Way You Can , the sequel to Every Which Way But Loose . The film received a number of bad reviews from critics , although Maslin described it as " funnier and even better than its predecessor " . Released over the Christmas season of 1980 , Any Which Way You Can was a major box office success and ranked among the top five highest @-@ grossing films of the year . 
 In 1982 , Eastwood directed and starred in <unk> Man , based on the eponymous Clancy Carlile 's depression @-@ era novel . Eastwood portrays a struggling western singer Red Stovall who suffers from tuberculosis , but has finally been given an opportunity to make it big at the Grand Ole Opry . He is accompanied by his young nephew ( played by real @-@ life son Kyle ) to Nashville , Tennessee , where he is supposed to record a song . Only Time gave the film a good review in the United States , with most reviewers criticizing its blend of muted humor and tragedy . Nevertheless , the film received critical acclaim in France , where it was compared to John Ford 's The Grapes of Wrath , and it has since acquired the very high rating of 93 percent on Rotten Tomatoes . In the same year Eastwood directed , produced , and starred in the Cold War @-@ themed Firefox . Based on a 1977 novel with the same name written by Craig Thomas , the film was shot before but released after <unk> Man . Russian filming locations were not possible due to the Cold War , and the film had to be shot in Vienna and other locations in Austria to simulate many of the Eurasian story locations . With a production cost of $ 20 million , it was Eastwood 's highest budget film to date . People magazine likened Eastwood 's performance to " Luke Skywalker trapped in Dirty Harry 's Soul " . 
 Eastwood directed and starred in the fourth Dirty Harry film , Sudden Impact , which was shot in the spring and summer of 1983 and is considered the darkest and most violent of the series . By this time Eastwood received 60 percent of all profits from films he starred in and directed , with the rest going to the studio . Sudden Impact was his final on @-@ screen collaboration with Locke . She plays an artist who , along with her sister , was gang @-@ raped a decade before the story takes place and seeks revenge for her sister 's now @-@ vegetative state by systematically murdering the rapists . The line " Go ahead , make my day " ( uttered by Eastwood during an early scene in a coffee shop ) has been cited as one of cinema 's immortal lines . It was quoted by President Ronald Reagan in a speech to Congress , and used during the 1984 presidential elections . The film was the second most commercially successful of the Dirty Harry films , after The Enforcer , earning $ 70 million . It received very positive reviews , with many critics praising the feminist aspects of the film through its explorations of the physical and psychological consequences of rape . 
 Tightrope ( 1984 ) had Eastwood starring opposite Geneviève Bujold in a provocative thriller , inspired by newspaper articles about an elusive Bay Area rapist . Set in New Orleans to avoid confusion with the Dirty Harry films , Eastwood played a divorced cop drawn into his target 's tortured psychology and fascination for sadomasochism . Tightrope was a critical and commercial hit and became the fourth highest @-@ grossing R @-@ rated film of 1984 . Eastwood next starred in the crime comedy City Heat ( 1984 ) alongside Burt Reynolds , a film about a private eye and his partner who get mixed up with gangsters in the prohibition era of the 1930s . The film grossed around $ 50 million domestically , but was overshadowed by Eddie Murphy 's Beverly Hills Cop . 
 Westerns . A period gone by , the pioneer , the loner operating by himself , without benefit of society . It usually has something to do with some sort of vengeance ; he takes care of the vengeance himself , doesn 't call the police . Like Robin Hood . It 's the last masculine frontier . Romantic myth , I guess , though it 's hard to think about anything romantic today . In a Western you can think , Jesus , there was a time when man was alone , on horseback , out there where man hasn 't spoiled the land yet . 
 Eastwood made his only foray into TV direction with the 1985 Amazing Stories episode Vanessa in the Garden , which starred Harvey Keitel and Locke . This was his first collaboration with Steven Spielberg , who later co @-@ produced Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima . He would revisit the Western genre when he directed and starred in Pale Rider ( 1985 ) , a film based on the classic 1953 western Shane and follows a preacher descending from the mists of the Sierras to side with the miners during the California Gold Rush of 1850 . The title is a reference to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse , as the rider of the pale horse is Death , and shows similarities to Eastwood 's 1973 western High Plains Drifter in its themes of morality and justice as well as its exploration of the supernatural . Pale Rider became one of Eastwood 's most successful films to date . It was hailed as one of the best films of 1985 and the best western to appear for a considerable period , with Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune remarking , " This year ( 1985 ) will go down in film history as the moment Clint Eastwood finally earned respect as an artist " . 
 In 1986 , Eastwood co @-@ starred with Marsha Mason in the military drama Heartbreak Ridge , about the 1983 United States invasion of Grenada . He portrays an aging United States Marine Gunnery Sergeant and Korean War veteran . Production and filming were marred by internal disagreements between Eastwood and long @-@ time friend and producer Fritz Manes , as well as between Eastwood and the United States Department of Defense who expressed contempt for the film . At the time , the film was a commercial rather than a critical success , and has only come to be viewed more favorably in recent times . The film grossed $ 70 million domestically . 
 Eastwood starred in The Dead Pool ( 1988 ) , the fifth and final film in the Dirty Harry series . It co @-@ starred Patricia Clarkson , Liam Neeson , and a young Jim Carrey who plays Johnny Squares , a drug @-@ addled rock star and the first of the victims on a list of celebrities drawn up by horror film director Peter Swan ( Neeson ) who are deemed most likely to die , the so @-@ called " Dead Pool " . The list is stolen by an obsessed fan who , in mimicking his favorite director , makes his way through the list killing off celebrities , of which Dirty Harry is also included . The Dead Pool grossed nearly $ 38 million , relatively low receipts for a Dirty Harry film . It is generally viewed as the weakest film of the series , though Roger Ebert thought it was as good as the original . 
 Eastwood began working on smaller , more personal projects and experienced a lull in his career between 1988 and 1992 . Always interested in jazz , he directed Bird ( 1988 ) , a biopic starring Forest Whitaker as jazz musician Charlie " Bird " Parker . Alto saxophonist Jackie McLean and Spike Lee , son of jazz bassist Bill Lee and a long time critic of Eastwood , criticized the characterization of Charlie Parker remarking that it did not capture his true essence and sense of humor . Eastwood received two Golden Globes for the film , the Cecil B. DeMille Award for his lifelong contribution , and the Best Director award . However , Bird was a commercial failure , earning just $ 11 million , which Eastwood attributed to the declining interest in jazz among black people . Carrey would appear with Eastwood again in the poorly received comedy Pink Cadillac ( 1989 ) . The film is about a bounty hunter and a group of white supremacists chasing an innocent woman ( Bernadette Peters ) who tries to outrun everyone in her husband 's prized pink Cadillac . The film failed both critically and commercially , earning barely more than Bird and marking a low point in Eastwood 's career .

 Eastwood directed and starred in White Hunter Black Heart ( 1990 ) , an adaptation of Peter Viertel 's roman à clef , about John Huston and the making of the classic film The African Queen . Shot on location in Zimbabwe in the summer of 1989 , the film received some critical attention but with only a limited release earned just $ 8 @.@ 4 million . Later in 1990 , Eastwood directed and co @-@ starred with Charlie Sheen in The Rookie , a buddy cop action film . Critics found the film 's plot and characterization unconvincing , but praised its action sequences . An ongoing lawsuit , in response to Eastwood allegedly ramming a woman 's car , resulted in no Eastwood films being shown in cinemas in 1991 . Eastwood won the suit and agreed to pay the complainant 's legal fees if she did not appeal . 
 ... if possible , he looks even taller , leaner and more mysteriously possessed than he did in Sergio Leone 's seminal Fistful of Dollars a quarter of a century ago . The years haven 't softened him . They have given him the presence of some fierce force of nature , which may be why the landscapes of the mythic , late 19th @-@ century West become him , never more so than in his new Unforgiven . ... This is his richest , most satisfying performance since the underrated , politically lunatic Heartbreak Ridge . There 's no one like him . 
 In 1992 , Eastwood revisited the western genre in his film Unforgiven , which he directed and in which he starred as an aging ex @-@ gunfighter long past his prime . Scripts existed for the film as early as 1976 under titles such as The Cut @-@ Whore Killings and The William Munny Killings but Eastwood delayed the project because he wanted to wait until he was old enough to play his character and to savor it as the last of his western films . Unforgiven was a major commercial and critical success ; Jack <unk> of the Los Angeles Times described it as " the finest classical western to come along since perhaps John Ford 's 1956 The Searchers . The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards , ( including Best Actor for Eastwood and Best Original Screenplay for David Webb Peoples ) and won four , including Best Picture and Best Director for Eastwood . In June 2008 Unforgiven was ranked as the fourth @-@ best American western , behind Shane , High Noon , and The Searchers , in the American Film Institute 's " AFI 's 10 Top 10 " list . 
 Eastwood played Frank <unk> in the Secret Service thriller In the Line of Fire ( 1993 ) , directed by Wolfgang Petersen and co @-@ starring John Malkovich and Rene Russo . <unk> is a guilt @-@ ridden Secret Service agent haunted by his failure to save John F. Kennedy 's life . The film was among the top 10 box office performers in that year , earning $ 102 million in the United States alone . Later in 1993 , he directed and co @-@ starred alongside Kevin Costner in A Perfect World . Set in the 1960s , Eastwood plays a Texas Ranger in pursuit of an escaped convict ( Costner ) who hits the road with a young boy ( T.J. Lowther ) . Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the film marked the highest point of Eastwood 's directing career , and the film has since been cited as one of his most underrated directorial achievements . 
 At the May 1994 Cannes Film Festival Eastwood received France 's Ordre des Arts et des Lettres medal , and on March 27 , 1995 , he was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award at the 67th Academy Awards . His next film appearance was in a cameo role as himself in the 1995 children 's film Casper . Later that same year he expanded his repertoire by playing opposite Meryl Streep in The Bridges of Madison County . Based on the novel by Robert James Waller , the film relates the story of Robert Kincaid ( Eastwood ) , a photographer working for National Geographic , who has an affair with a middle @-@ aged Italian farm wife , Francesca ( Streep ) . Despite the novel receiving unfavorable reviews and a subject deemed potentially unsuitable for film , The Bridges of Madison County was a commercial and critical success . Roger Ebert wrote , " Streep and Eastwood weave a spell , and it is based on that particular knowledge of love and self that comes with middle age . " The film was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Picture and won a César Award in France for Best Foreign Film . Streep was also nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe . 
 In 1997 , Eastwood directed and starred in the political thriller Absolute Power , alongside Gene Hackman ( with whom he had appeared in Unforgiven ) .

 The roles that Eastwood has played , and the films that he has directed , cannot be disentangled from the nature of the American culture of the last quarter century , its fantasies and its realities . 
 Eastwood directed and starred in True Crime ( 1999 ) . He plays Steve Everett , a journalist and recovering alcoholic , who has to cover the execution of murderer Frank <unk> ( played by Isaiah Washington ) . True Crime received a mixed reception , with Janet Maslin of The New York Times writing , " his direction is galvanized by a sense of second chances and tragic misunderstandings , and by contrasting a larger sense of justice with the peculiar minutiae of crime . Perhaps he goes a shade too far in the latter direction , though . " The film was a box office failure , earning less than half its $ 55 million budget and was Eastwood 's worst @-@ performing film of the 1990s aside from White Hunter Black Heart , which had a limited release .

 Beginning with the thriller Play Misty for Me , Eastwood has directed over 30 films , including Westerns , action films , and dramas . He is one of few top Hollywood actors to have also become a critically and commercially successful director . The New Yorker wrote that , unlike Eastwood , 
 John Ford appeared in just a few silent films ; Howard Hawks never acted in movies . Clark Gable , Gary Cooper , Spencer Tracy , James Stewart , Cary Grant , Humphrey Bogart , William Holden , Steve McQueen , and Sean Connery never directed a feature . John Wayne directed only twice , and badly ; ditto Burt Lancaster . Paul Newman , Jack Nicholson , Warren Beatty , Robert Redford , Robert De Niro , and Sean Penn have directed a few movies each , with mixed commercial and artistic success . 
 From the very early days of his career Eastwood was frustrated by directors ' insistence that scenes be re @-@ shot multiple times and perfected , and when he began directing in 1970 , he made a conscious attempt to avoid any aspects of directing he had been indifferent to as an actor . As a result , Eastwood is renowned for his efficient film directing and ability to reduce filming time and control budgets . He usually avoids actors ' rehearsing and prefers to complete most scenes on the first take . Eastwood 's rapid filmmaking practices have been compared to those of Woody Allen , Ingmar Bergman , Jean @-@ Luc Godard , and the Coen brothers . When acting in others ' films he sometimes takes over directing , such as for The Outlaw Josey Wales , if he believes production is too slow . In preparation for filming Eastwood rarely uses storyboards for developing the layout of a shooting schedule . He also attempts to reduce script background details on characters to allow the audience to become more involved in the film , considering their imagination a requirement for a film that connects with viewers . Eastwood has indicated that he lays out a film 's plot to provide the audience with necessary details , but not " so much that it insults their intelligence . " 
 According to Life magazine , " Eastwood 's style is to shoot first and act afterward . He etches his characters virtually without words . He has developed the art of underplaying to the point that anyone around him who so much as flinches looks <unk> histrionic . " <unk> Richard Thompson and Tim Hunter note that Eastwood 's films are " superbly paced : unhurried ; cool ; and [ give ] a strong sense of real time , regardless of the speed of the narrative " while Ric Gentry considers Eastwood 's pacing " unrushed and relaxed . " Eastwood is fond of low @-@ key lighting and back @-@ lighting to give his movies a " noir @-@ ish " feel . 
 Eastwood 's frequent exploration of ethical values has drawn the attention of scholars , who have explored Eastwood 's work from ethical and theological perspectives , including his portrayal of justice , mercy , suicide and the angel of death .

 Eastwood married Margaret Neville " Maggie " Johnson ( then working for an auto parts suppliers company ) on December 19 , 1953 in Pasadena . They had met six months earlier on a blind date in Los Angeles , although Eastwood subsequently had a serious relationship with a young woman in Seattle that summer , before Johnson announced her engagement to him in October . The marriage would not prove altogether smooth , Eastwood telling biographer Richard Schickel in the only authorized book ever written about him that he was " too young , not well enough established . " A decade later , an ongoing affair Eastwood was involved in ( said to have lasted 14 years ) with dancer and Rawhide stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis ( who was also married yet separated ) produced his earliest confirmed child , daughter Kimber Eastwood ( born Kimber Tunis ; June 17 , 1964 ) , whose existence was kept secret from the public until July 1989 , when the National Enquirer revealed her identity . Biographer Marc Eliot wrote of Johnson , " It is difficult to say for sure that she actually knew about the baby , although it would have been nearly impossible for her not to . Everyone on the set knew ... and it is simply too difficult to keep a secret like that when the mother and the illegitimate child live in the same small town , especially when that small town is Hollywood . " Actress Barbara Eden , a onetime Rawhide guest star and witness to the affair with Tunis , said of Eastwood 's relationship with Johnson : " They conducted a somewhat open marriage . " 
 According to biographer Patrick McGilligan , Eastwood had many other affairs , including with co @-@ stars Inger Stevens ( Hang ' Em High ) , Jean Seberg ( Paint Your Wagon ) and Jo Ann Harris ( The Beguiled ) , as well as actresses Jill Banner , Catherine Deneuve , and Susan St. James , columnist Bridget Byrne , competitive swimmer Anita <unk> , and singer Keely Smith during his marriage to Johnson , who , after a trial separation and lingering bout of hepatitis in the mid @-@ 1960s , expressed her desire to reconcile and start a family . They had two children together : Kyle Eastwood ( born May 19 , 1968 ) and Alison Eastwood ( born May 22 , 1972 ) . At some point in 1972 , Eastwood met married actress ( later director ) Sondra Locke . The two began living together while filming The Outlaw Josey Wales in the autumn of 1975 , by which time , according to Locke , " He had told me that there was no real relationship left between him and Maggie . " Locke wrote in her autobiography , " Clint seemed astonished at his need for me , even admitting that he 'd never been faithful to one woman — because he 'd " never been in love before , " he confided . He even made up a song about it : " She made me monogamous . " That flattered and delighted me . I would never doubt his faithfulness and his love for me . " Locke moved into the Sherman Oaks house Eastwood had once shared with Johnson ( who by then lived full @-@ time in Pebble Beach ) , but felt uncomfortable there because " psychologically , it would always be Maggie 's . " " Finally I told Clint that I couldn 't live there any longer , " writes Locke . The couple moved to Bel @-@ Air in a fixer @-@ upper Locke spent three years renovating . She underwent two abortions and a tubal ligation in the late 1970s and was most reluctant about the second abortion , noting " I couldn 't help but think that that baby , with both Clint 's and my best qualities , would be extraordinary . " Johnson made no secret of her dislike for Locke , even though the two women never met . " Maggie placed severe rules on my relationship with the kids . Apparently , she never forgave me ... After she learned that Clint had taken me onto her property to show me a baby deer that had just been born there , she laid down a rule that I was never to be allowed there again . I was not even allowed to phone the Pebble Beach house . " In 1978 Johnson filed for legal separation from Eastwood , but did not officially divorce him until May 1984 , receiving a reported cash settlement of $ 25 million . Locke never divorced her legal husband , homosexual sculptor Gordon Anderson , who resided with his male companion in a West Hollywood home purchased by Eastwood . 
 Eastwood and Locke went on to star in The Gauntlet , Every Which Way But Loose , Bronco Billy , Any Which Way You Can and Sudden Impact . According to former longtime associate Fritz Manes , as quoted by author McGilligan , Eastwood was devoted to her between 1976 and 1980 at the least , but discreetly kept up several " maintenance relationships " ( such as with Tunis ) during that period . McGilligan claims Eastwood returned to his " habitual womanizing " in the early 1980s , becoming involved with story analyst Megan Rose , actress Jamie Rose ( who played a bit part in Tightrope ) , animal rights activist Jane Brolin ( who had intermittent liaisons with Eastwood between the early 1960s and late 1980s ) and <unk> Reeves , a stewardess he met at the Hog 's Breath Inn , among others . He was still living with Locke when he conceived two children with Reeves : a son Scott Eastwood ( born Scott Reeves ; March 21 , 1986 ) and daughter Kathryn Eastwood ( born Kathryn Reeves ; February 2 , 1988 ) , whose birth certificates both said " Father declined . " The affair with Reeves was not reported anywhere until an exposé article was published in the Star tabloid in 1990 , though the children still went unmentioned by mainstream news sources for more than a decade thereafter . Eastwood 's relationship with Locke ( at the time unaware of his infidelities ) ended acrimoniously in April 1989 , and the post @-@ breakup litigation dragged on for years . Locke filed a <unk> lawsuit against him after he changed the locks on their home and moved her possessions into storage when she was away filming her second directorial effort Impulse . In court , Eastwood downplayed the intensity of their relationship . He described Locke as a " roommate " before quickly <unk> her as a " part @-@ time roommate . " Locke 's estranged brother told The Tennessean that Eastwood still truly loved her , but could no longer take her " addiction " to husband Gordon Anderson . Anticipating that Eastwood was going to misrepresent the marriage , Locke asked Anderson to surrender all claims on any of her assets that as her legal spouse he was entitled to . " In an extraordinary gesture of love and faith in me , Gordon signed away everything without hesitation . " During the trial , an investigative journalist contacted Locke and informed her of Eastwood 's other family . " I spoke with the nurse in the delivery room , and she confirmed that they are Clint 's children . I 'll send copies of the birth certificates to you and a photo of <unk> , if you want them , " Locke quotes the informant . " My mind was still searching to get all his actions lined up . For at least the last four years of our relationship , Clint had been living this double life , going between me and this other woman , and having children with her . Two babies had been born during the last three years of our relationship , and they weren 't mine . " Locke dropped the suit in 1990 in exchange for a directing deal at Warner Bros. , but sued Eastwood again for fraud in 1994 when she became convinced the deal was a sham , finally settling out of court in September 1996 . Since then , Locke has made discrediting comments about Eastwood . 
 In 1990 , actress Frances Fisher , whom Eastwood had met on the set of Pink Cadillac in late 1988 , moved in with him . Fisher said of dating Eastwood , " I simply felt that this was it , the big one . I had no idea that every woman he meets probably feels as I did . " They co @-@ starred in Unforgiven , and had a daughter , Francesca Eastwood ( born Francesca Fisher @-@ Eastwood ; August 7 , 1993 ) . The birth of Francesca marked the first time Eastwood was present for one of his children being born . Eastwood and Fisher ended their relationship in early 1995 , after which Fisher said it took two years to complete what she called the grieving process for her shattered dreams . Before she had moved out of Eastwood 's home , he was said to already be dating Dina Ruiz , a television news anchor 35 years his junior whom he had first met when she interviewed him in 1993 . They married on March 31 , 1996 , when Eastwood surprised her with a private ceremony at a home on the Shadow Creek Golf Course in Las Vegas . The marriage was noted for the fact that it was only Eastwood 's second legal union in spite of his many long @-@ term romances over the decades . Eastwood said of his bride , " I 'm proud to make this lady my wife . She 's the one I 've been waiting for . " Ruiz commented , " The fact that I 'm only the second woman he has married really touches me . " The couple has one daughter , Morgan Eastwood ( born December 12 , 1996 ) . Ruiz made cameos in two of Eastwood 's films , Blood Work and True Crime ( in which Fisher even appeared ) . In the summer of 2012 , Dina , Morgan and Francesca starred with the band <unk> in a reality show for the E ! network titled Mrs. Eastwood & Company , on which Eastwood appeared only occasionally . 
 In August 2013 , Dina Eastwood announced that she and her husband had been living separately for an undisclosed length of time . On October 23 , 2013 , Dina filed for divorce after she withdrew her request for legal separation , citing irreconcilable differences . She asked for full custody of their 16 @-@ year @-@ old daughter , Morgan , as well as spousal support . The divorce was finalized in December 2014 . Eastwood has since been publicly linked with photographer Erica Tomlinson @-@ Fisher ( no relation to Frances ) , 41 years his junior , and restaurant hostess Christina Sandera , 33 years his junior . He and Sandera went public with their relationship at the 87th Academy Awards in February 2015 .

 = = Politics = = 
 Eastwood registered as a Republican to vote for Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and endorsed Richard Nixon 's 1968 and 1972 presidential campaigns . However , during the subsequent Watergate scandal , Eastwood criticized Nixon 's morality and later his handling of the Vietnam War , calling it " immoral " . 
 Eastwood has disapproved of America 's wars in Korea ( 1950 – 1953 ) , Vietnam ( 1964 – 1975 ) , Afghanistan ( 2001 – present ) , and Iraq ( 2003 – 2011 ) , believing that the United States should not be overly militaristic or play the role of global policeman . He has referred to himself as " ... too individualistic to be either right @-@ wing or left @-@ wing , " describing himself in 1974 as " a political nothing " and " a moderate " and in 1997 as a libertarian . " I don 't see myself as conservative , " Eastwood has stated , while noting in the same breath that he isn 't " ultra @-@ leftist , " either . At times , he has supported Democrats in California , including Senator Dianne Feinstein in 1994 , liberal United States House of Representatives member Sam Farr in 2002 , and Governor Gray Davis , whom he voted for in 1998 and 2002 and hosted pricey fundraisers for in 2002 and 2003 . 
 A self @-@ professed " liberal on civil rights , " Eastwood has stated that he is pro @-@ choice on abortion . He has endorsed same @-@ sex marriage and contributed to groups supporting the Equal Rights Amendment for women , which failed to receive ratification in 1982 . 
 In 1992 , Eastwood acknowledged to writer David <unk> that his political views represented a fusion of Milton Friedman and Noam Chomsky and suggested that they would make for a worthwhile presidential ticket . In 1999 , Eastwood stated , " I guess I was a social liberal and fiscal conservative before it became fashionable . " Ten years later , in 2009 , Eastwood said that he was now a registered Libertarian . 
 Despite being heavily associated with firearms in his Westerns and cop movies , Eastwood has publicly endorsed gun control since at least 1973 . In the April 24 , 1973 , edition of The Washington Post , the star said " I 'm for gun legislation myself . I don 't hunt . " Two years later , in 1975 , Eastwood told People magazine that he favors " gun control to some degree " . About a year later , Eastwood remarked that " All guns should be registered . I don 't think legitimate gun owners would mind that kind of legislation . Right now the furor against a gun law is by gun owners who are overreacting . They 're worried that all guns are going to be recalled . It 's impossible to take guns out of circulation , and that 's why firearms should be registered and mail @-@ order delivery of guns halted . " In 1993 , he noted that he " ... was always a backer " of the Brady Bill , with its federally mandated waiting period . In 1995 , Eastwood questioned the purpose of assault weapons . Larry King , the television host and newspaper columnist , wrote in the May 22 , 1995 , edition of USA Today that " My interview with Eastwood will air on ' Larry King Weekend ' ... I asked him his thoughts on the NRA and gun control and he said that while people think of him as pro @-@ gun , he has always been in favor of controls . ' Why would anyone need or want an assault weapon ? ' he said . " 
 As a politician , Eastwood has made successful forays into both local and state government . In April 1986 , he won election as mayor ( a nonpartisan position ) of his adopted hometown , Carmel @-@ by @-@ the @-@ Sea , California – a small , wealthy village and artists ' community on the Monterey Peninsula . During his two @-@ year term , Eastwood supported small business interests while advocating environmental protection and constructing a library annex , along with public restrooms , beach walkways , and a tourists ' parking lot . In 2001 Eastwood was appointed to the California State Park and Recreation Commission by Governor Davis , then reappointed in 2004 by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger . As the vice chairman of the commission , in 2005 along with chairman Bobby Shriver , he led the movement opposed to a six @-@ lane 16 @-@ mile ( 26 km ) extension of California State Route 241 , a toll road that would cut through San Onofre State Beach . Eastwood and Shriver supported a 2006 lawsuit to block the toll road and urged the California Coastal Commission to reject the project , which it did in February 2008 . In March 2008 Eastwood and Shriver 's non @-@ reappointment to the commission on the expiry of their terms prompted the Natural Resources Defense Council ( NRDC ) to request a legislative investigation into the decision . Governor Schwarzenegger appointed Eastwood to the California Film Commission in April 2004 . He was a spokesman for Take Pride in America , an agency of the United States Department of the Interior which advocates taking responsibility for natural , cultural , and historic resources . 
 During the 2008 United States presidential election , Eastwood stated that he would be voting for John McCain , citing the fact that he had known McCain since he returned to the US in 1973 as a recently released POW . Eastwood said of McCain : " I met him years ago when he first came back from Vietnam . This was back when ( Ronald ) Reagan was the governor of California and he had a big function for all of the prisoners of war who were released . I thought he was a terrific guy , a real American hero . " Nevertheless , Eastwood wished Barack Obama well upon his subsequent victory saying , " Obama is my president now and I am going to be wishing him the very best because it is what is best for all of us . " Eastwood stated in 2010 of President Obama : " I think he 's a nice fella and I enjoyed watching him come along and I enjoyed watching him campaign and win the job . But I 'm not a fan of what he 's doing at the moment . ... I just don 't think he 's governing . I don 't think he 's surrounded himself with the people he could have surrounded himself with . " 
 In August 2010 , Eastwood wrote to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer , George Osborne , to protest the decision to close the UK Film Council , warning the closure could result in fewer foreign production companies choosing to work in Great Britain . 
 In January 2011 , Eastwood told the UK 's Daily Mail that " I loved the fact that Obama is multi @-@ racial . I thought that was terrific , as my wife is the same racial make @-@ up . But I felt he was a <unk> , and it turned out he didn 't have experience in decision @-@ making . " As for McCain , Eastwood reflected , " I voted for McCain , not because he was a Republican , but because he had been through war ( in Vietnam ) and I thought he might understand the war in Iraq better than somebody who hadn 't . I didn 't agree with him on a lot of stuff . " On August 3 , 2012 , he attended a fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney , suggesting that Romney would boost the country and " restore a decent tax system ... so that there 's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as [ to ] who 's paying taxes and who isn 't . " During a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention , Eastwood talked to an empty chair as if President Barack Obama were sitting in it . The speech was met with a huge response by the media with both praise and criticism . Eastwood , who said he came up with the speech 5 seconds before he gave it , said that if he could do it again he would say something different . " My only message was [ that ] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there . Just look at the work , look at the background , and then make a judgment on that . I was just trying to say that , and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took a lot more time , I suppose , than they would have liked . I 'd probably say something else but I 'd try to get the same message across so that people don 't have to kiss up to politicians . No matter what party they 're in , you should evaluate their work and make your judgments accordingly . That 's the way to do it in life and every other subject , but sometimes in America we get gaga , we look at the wrong values . " 
 Based on his appearance and comments at the 2012 Republican National Convention , some see him as a right @-@ wing poster boy . However , Eastwood said he has always opposed war , and is a pragmatic Libertarian rather than a red @-@ meat Republican . Eastwood further explained his anti @-@ war stance by saying " I was a child growing up during World War II . That was supposed to be the one to end all wars . And four years later , I was standing at the draft board being drafted during the Korean conflict , and then after that there was Vietnam , and it goes on and on forever … I just wonder … does this ever stop ? And no , it doesn 't . So each time we get in these conflicts , it deserves a lot of thought before we go wading in or wading out . Going in or coming out . It needs a better thought process , I think . " Furthermore , Eastwood 's 2014 movie American Sniper was met with strong critical praise , especially from many Republicans who called it a Pro @-@ War on Terror , Pro @-@ Republican and a patriotic film ; Eastwood responded by saying it was a " stupid analysis " and that the movie had nothing to do with political parties . Eastwood responded to critics of American Sniper by saying his film was " the biggest anti @-@ war statement any film can make " and that " the fact of what [ war ] does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did " and " what it ( war ) does to the people left behind . "
