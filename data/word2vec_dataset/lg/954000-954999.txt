 In April 2011 , Paul filed to run for re @-@ election to his Senate seat in 2016 . Had he become the Republican presidential ( or vice @-@ presidential ) nominee , state law would prohibit him from simultaneously running for re @-@ election . In March 2014 , the Republican @-@ controlled Kentucky Senate passed a bill that would allow Paul to run for both offices , but the Democratic @-@ controlled Kentucky House of Representatives declined to take it up . Paul spent his own campaign money in the 2014 legislative elections , helping Republican candidates for the State House in the hopes of flipping the chamber , thus allowing the legislature to pass the bill ( Democratic Governor Steve Beshear 's veto can be overridden with a simple majority ) . However , the Democrats retained their 54 – 46 majority in the State House . Paul has since given his support to the idea that the Kentucky Republican Party could decide to hold a caucus rather than a primary , potentially giving Paul more time to decide whether he should run for U.S. Senator or continue a potential bid for President .

 Paul announced the suspension of his presidential campaign on February 3 , 2016 , shortly after the Iowa caucus . 
 = = Political positions = = 
 A supporter of the Tea Party movement , Paul has described himself as a " constitutional conservative " . He is generally described as a libertarian , a term he both embraced and rejected during his first Senate campaign . He supports term limits , a balanced budget amendment , and the Read the Bills Act , in addition to the widespread reduction of federal spending and taxation . He favors a flat tax rate of 14 @.@ 5 % for individuals and business , while eliminating the FICA payroll taxes , as well as taxes on inheritance , gifts , capital gains , dividends , and interest . 
 On social issues , Paul describes himself as " 100 % pro life " , believing that legal personhood begins at fertilization . In 2009 , his position was to ban abortion under all circumstances . Since 2010 , he has said he would allow for a doctor 's discretion in life @-@ threatening cases such as ectopic pregnancies . Concerning same @-@ sex marriage , Paul has made a distinction between his personal beliefs and how he feels the government should handle it . He has stated that he personally feels same @-@ sex marriage " offends [ himself ] and a lot of people " , and said there is a " crisis that allows people to think there would be some other sorts of marriage . " However , he believes the issue should be left to the states to decide , and would not support a federal ban . 
 Concerning drugs , Paul has criticized mandatory minimums that he believes have led to unreasonably harsh sentences for repeat offenders . He has highlighted the case of Timothy L. Tyler as particularly unfair . Paul does not believe in legalizing the recreational use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine , but does not support jailing marijuana users . He supports state laws to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes . Paul was one of three U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce a bipartisan bill , <unk> , that would legalize medical marijuana under federal law . 
 Paul opposes all forms of gun control as a violation of Second Amendment rights , including provisions of the Patriot Act . His advocacy of personal property rights includes introducing House Bill S. 890 , the Defense of Environment and Property Act of 2012 . Provisions of the bill include restricting the ability of the Environmental Protection Agency and other Federal agencies to " impinge upon states ' power over land and water use . " The bill holds requires Federal agencies to reimburse private property owners double the amount of any economic losses arising from new Federal regulations " that relate to the definition of navigable waters or waters of the United States " , and holds the enforcement of any such regulation in abeyance until such payments are complete . 
 Unlike his more stridently " non @-@ interventionist " father , Paul concedes a role for American armed forces abroad , including permanent foreign military bases . He has said that he blames supporters of the Iraq War and not President Obama for the growth in violence that occurred in 2014 , and that the Iraq War " emboldened " Iran . Dick Cheney , John McCain and Rick Perry have responded by calling Paul an isolationist , but Paul has pointed to opinion polls of likely GOP primary voters as support for his position . Paul also stated : " I personally believe that this group [ ‍ ISIS ‍ ] would not be in Iraq and would not be as powerful had we not been supplying their allies in the war [ against Syrian Bashar al @-@ Assad 's government ] . " Paul then supported airstrikes against ISIS , but questioned the constitutionality of Obama 's unilateral actions without a clear congressional mandate . Paul has stated concerns about arms sent to Syrian rebels that wind up in unfriendly hands . In 2015 , Paul called for a defense budget of $ 697 billion in 2016 . In 2011 , shortly after being elected , he proposed a budget which specified $ 542 billion in defense spending . 
 On February 2 , 2015 , Paul generated controversy by suggesting that states should not require parents to vaccinate their children because parents should have the freedom to make that decision for their children . In an interview with CNBC on February 2 , Paul clarified this statement , commenting " I 'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea . I think they are a good thing . But I think the parent should have some input . The state doesn 't own your children . Parents own the children , and it is an issue of freedom . " On February 3 , he posted a photograph to Twitter of himself being vaccinated .

 The HTC Dream ( also known as the T @-@ Mobile G1 in the United States and parts of Europe , and as the Era G1 in Poland ) is a smartphone developed by HTC . First released in October 2008 , the Dream was the first commercially released device to use the Linux @-@ based Android operating system , which was purchased and further developed by Google and the Open <unk> Alliance to create an open competitor to other major smartphone platforms of the time , such as Symbian operating system , BlackBerry OS , and iOS . The operating system offers a customizable graphical user interface , integration with Google services such as Gmail , a notification system that shows a list of recent messages pushed from apps , and Android Market for downloading additional apps . 
 The Dream was released to mixed , but mostly positive reception . While the Dream was praised for its solid and robust hardware design , the introduction of the Android operating system was met with criticism for its lack of certain functionality and third @-@ party software in comparison to more established platforms , but was still considered to be innovative due to its open nature , notifications system , and heavy integration with Google 's services .

 = = = Development = = = 
 In July 2005 , Google acquired Android Inc . , a company led by Andy Rubin which was working on unspecified software for mobile devices . Under the leadership of Google , the team was in the process of developing a standardized , Linux @-@ based operating system for mobile phones to compete against the likes of Symbian and Windows Mobile , which would be offered for use by individual original equipment manufacturers . Initial development of what would become Android was targeted towards a prototype device codenamed " Sooner " ; the device was a messaging phone in the style of BlackBerry , with a small , non @-@ touch screen , navigation keys , and a physical QWERTY keyboard . The January 2007 unveiling of the iPhone , Apple 's first smartphone , and its pioneering design aspects , caught Rubin off @-@ guard and led to a change in course for the project . The operating system 's design was quickly reworked , and attention shifted to a new prototype device codenamed " Dream " — a touchscreen device with a sliding , physical keyboard . The inclusion of a physical keyboard was intentional , as Android developers recognized users did not like the idea of a virtual keyboard as they lacked the physical feedback that makes hardware keyboards useful . 
 The Android operating system was officially unveiled in November 2007 along with the founding of the Open <unk> Alliance ( OHA ) ; a consortium of hardware , software , and telecommunication companies devoted to advancing open standards for mobile devices . These companies included Google , along with HTC , a company who was at the time , one of the largest manufacturers of phones . While Google indicated in 2008 that several <unk> devices were being tested in preparation for the official public launch of Android , only one was to be released in the United States that year — the HTC Dream . Plans called for the Dream to be released on T @-@ Mobile USA by the end of the year ( with some reports suggesting October 2008 ) , targeting the holiday shopping season . Sprint had worked with the OHA , but had not yet unveiled any plans to release an Android phone of its own , while Verizon Wireless and AT & T did not have any plans for Android devices yet at all . 
 = = = Release = = = 
 HTC officially announced the Dream on 23 September 2008 . It would first be released by T @-@ Mobile as the T @-@ Mobile G1 , starting in the United States. on 20 October 2008 in its 3G @-@ enabled markets only ( it became available in all markets on 24 January 2009 ) , followed by a British release in November 2008 , and a release in other European territories in early 2009 . On 10 March 2009 , it became available in Poland as the Era G1 on Era . On 2 June 2009 , both the Dream and its successor ( the HTC Magic ) were released by Rogers Wireless in Canada . 
 The Dream was discontinued by T @-@ Mobile on 27 July 2010 . The G1 was spiritually succeeded in October 2010 by the T @-@ Mobile G2 , a new HTC device which also featured stock Android and a sliding keyboard , and was T @-@ Mobile USA 's first " 4G " smartphone . In Canada , Rogers suspended sales of the Dream on 15 January 2010 due to a bug affecting the proper use of emergency calls .

 The Dream 's exterior uses a soft , matte plastic shell , and was made available in white , black , and bronze colors . The Dream 's design features a distinctive " chin " on the bottom , which houses 5 navigation buttons ( " Call " , " Home " , " Menu " , " Back " , and " End Call " ) and a clickable trackball in the center which can be used for scrolling and selecting . The device uses a 3 @.@ 2 inches ( 8 @.@ 1 cm ) capacitive touchscreen LCD at a resolution of 320 × 480 ; the screen can be slid along a curved hinge to expose a five @-@ row QWERTY keyboard — as the first releases of Android did not include a virtual keyboard , the keyboard was originally the only method of text input on the device . While supporting multitouch at the hardware level , the Linux kernel in the Dream 's Android distribution was patched to remove multitouch support from its touchscreen drivers for undisclosed reasons . The Dream does not include a traditional headphone jack , requiring an adapter for HTC 's proprietary ( but Mini @-@ USB compatible ) " <unk> " port located on the bottom of the device . The rear of the device houses a 3 @.@ 15 @-@ megapixel rear camera with auto @-@ focus . 
 The Dream uses a 528 MHz Qualcomm <unk> system on a chip with 192 MB of RAM , and comes with 256 MB of internal storage , which can be expanded by up to 16 GB using a Micro SD card slot . For network connectivity , the Dream supports Quad @-@ band GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 MHz and GPRS / EDGE , plus Dual band UMTS Bands I and IV ( 1700 & 2100 MHz ) and HSDPA / <unk> ( in US / Europe ) at 7 @.@ 2 / 2 Mbit / s . The device also supports standalone GPS and A @-@ GPS .

 The HTC Dream was the first ever smartphone to ship with the Android operating system . The operating system heavily integrates with , and provides apps for various Google services , such as Gmail ( with push email support ) , Maps , Search , Talk , and YouTube , while the contacts and calendar apps can sync with the online Google Contacts and Google Calendar services respectively . The device also ships with an email app supporting other POP3 and <unk> @-@ based mail services , an instant messaging app with support for multiple services , and a WebKit @-@ based web browser . A notification system displays icons for certain events ( such as e @-@ mails and text messages ) on the left side of the status bar across the top of the screen ; dragging down from the top of the screen exposes a tray with more detailed information for each notification . The Android Market can be used to download additional apps for the device . The G1 as sold by T @-@ Mobile also shipped with an Amazon MP3 app , allowing users to purchase DRM @-@ free music online , and download them straight to the device via Wi @-@ Fi . 
 The Dream could also be upgraded to newer versions of Android , which added new features and enhancements to the platform . The latest version of Android officially made available for the Dream , 1 @.@ 6 " Donut " , was released for T @-@ Mobile USA 's G1 in October 2009 . The 1 @.@ 6 update was not released on the Rogers HTC Dream in Canada ( which stayed on 1 @.@ 5 " Cupcake " ) ; Rogers claimed that the update was only being made available for " ' Google ' -branded " models of the device . 
 = = Development and modding = = 
 Due to the open source nature of the Android platform , the Dream became a popular target for modding . Shortly after the release of the Dream , developers discovered a software exploit which would allow a user to gain superuser access to the phone — a process which would be referred to as " rooting " . As a parallel to " jailbreaking " on iOS devices , root access would enable users to perform tweaks and other changes at the system level that cannot be performed under normal circumstances ( such as adding auto @-@ rotation , and installing a custom kernel that restored the aforementioned multitouch support ) . 
 After the Dream 's bootloader was dumped , work began on modifying it so that it could install third @-@ party firmware , and on converting official Android update files into a format that could be installed using the modified bootloader . Around the same time , Google made the Android Dev Phone 1 available for registered Android developers ; the Dev Phone 1 was a <unk> and hardware @-@ unlocked version of the HTC Dream that came pre @-@ configured for superuser access to the internal files of the phone , allowing users to completely replace the bootloader and operating system . 
 As a result of these developments , a dedicated community , centered on forums such as <unk> Developers , emerged surrounding the creation of custom firmware ( " ROMs " ) built from the Android source code . Projects such as <unk> continued to produce ports of newer versions of Android for the Dream and later Android devices , while adding their own features and enhancements to the operating system as well . 
 On later Android devices , where a number of factors ( including carrier practices , and custom software provided by device manufacturers that sit atop Android , such as HTC Sense and Samsung TouchWiz ) led to fragmentation regarding the availability of newer versions of the OS for certain devices , the development and use of custom ROMs ( which are usually based off the " stock " version of Android ) have ultimately become an important , yet controversial aspect of the Android ecosystem . In August 2012 , a group of users released an unofficial port of a later version of Android , 4 @.@ 1 " Jelly Bean " , for the Dream as a proof of concept . However , the port lacked key functionality , and had severe performance issues due to the phone 's relatively weak hardware in comparison to the modern devices that 4 @.@ 1 was designed for .

 The Dream was released to mixed reviews . The design of the Dream was considered to be solid and robust ; Joshua Topolsky of Engadget considered its hardware design a contrast to that of the iPhone , due to its numerous navigation buttons ( in comparison to just a home button ) and its " charming , retro @-@ future look ; like a gadget in a 1970 's sci @-@ fi movie set in the year 2038 . " The Dream 's keyboard , as the only method of text input prior to Android 1 @.@ 5 's introduction of a virtual keyboard , was considered to be sufficient , although some felt that its keys were too small . Its display was considered sufficient for a phone of its class , but John Brandon of TechRadar felt that it was not good enough for watching videos due to its poor contrast and small size in comparison to the iPhone . Android itself was considered to still be in its infancy ( primarily due to its bare @-@ bones functionality in certain areas , limited application catalog , lack of multitouch gestures , or syncing with certain enterprise platforms ) , but showed promise through its customizable interface , increased flexibility over iOS , its notification system , ability to display security permissions when downloading apps , and its heavy integration with Google services . 
 Brandon gave the Dream a 4 @.@ 5 / 5 , despite stating that it was " no Apple iPhone killer " , given its lower quality of its application selection and multimedia features in comparison . In conclusion , the Dream was considered to be a " stellar " phone that " points to a future when a phone is as flexible and useful as the PC on your desk . " Engadget felt that the Dream " isn 't going to blow anyone 's mind right out of the gate " due to its hardware , but that the Android platform as a whole held its own against its competitors , and that early adopters of Android through the G1 were " buying into one of the most exciting developments in the mobile world in recent memory . " <unk> noted that the Dream would have been " another average smart QWERTY messenger " had it not been for its introduction of Android ; in conclusion , the Dream was considered " far from the perfect package " , but still believed that " it gets the things that matter done and gets them done right . "

Principal photography took place at the Convent of the Sacred Heart in New York City . 
 It features guest appearances from Katie Couric , Art Smith , and Tony Bennett . Gaga performed stripped down , acoustic versions of four songs from her second studio album , Born This Way , along with two Christmas songs and a duet with Bennett . The special received critical acclaim and gave ABC its best ratings in four years for its respective time slot on Thanksgiving Day . At the 2012 Dorian Awards , the special was nominated in the category of Best TV Musical Program of the Year , but did not win the award .

 A Very Gaga Thanksgiving was conceived and directed by Gaga herself , while it was produced by Steven Johnson , Rudy <unk> , and David Saltz . Principal photography took place at the Convent of the Sacred Heart in New York City . Gaga told Women 's Wear Daily : " My dad will be so excited . I actually directed it . It 's the first of two things I directed . I directed this as well as the video for ' Marry The Night , ' my new single ... So we 'll be watching that and eating turkey and doing what all New Yorkers do , which is getting ready for every window to be filled with Christmas cheer the next day . " 
 Gaga received dresses designed by Giorgio Armani , Stéphane Rolland , Azzedine Alaïa , and Martin Grant . A promotional photo of Gaga was released that shows her " going full ice princess " , which Erin Strecker of Entertainment Weekly presumed will be her primary apparel . In a press statement early in November 2011 , Couric commented that the special 's story will amaze viewers and show a different side of Gaga : 
 This is a chance to see more of who she is beneath the wild costumes and staged musical numbers ... Lady Gaga as a high school student still bruised by being excluded from the party , Lady Gaga as a devoted daughter and caring sister , Lady Gaga as a 25 @-@ year @-@ old woman embracing fame and fortune that seemed to come overnight . She will impress you , delight you and surprise you . 
 Smith commented , " It 's important for people to see that this amazing woman [ Gaga ] has a family that supports her . " A 30 @-@ second preview of the special premiered on November 20 , 2011 on Lady Gaga 's YouTube channel . It revealed the appearances of Bennett , Couric and Smith . After watching the preview , a staff member of Idolator commented that it " reminds us of our own family Turkey Day get @-@ togethers : there are people running around in ridiculous attire , someone ’ s crying and the hostess is a ( Mother ) Monster of sorts . " In a three @-@ minute teaser trailer , Gaga makes crafts and shares holiday food with third @-@ grade children . The full TV special premiered on November 24 , 2011 , at 9 : 30 pm ET .

 It was met with general acclaim from television critics . Calling it engaging , Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly opined that A Very Gaga Thanksgiving was " disarmingly direct , sincere , and unpretentious . " Tucker praised Lady Gaga 's performances in the television special , expressing that they were a " warm , low @-@ key collection of solid performances of her hits and pop standards . " Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times deemed the television special as a " dream or a hallucination . " The Guardian journalist Hadley Freeman wrote , " It was all inoffensive , silly and knowing , and laid down the groundwork for what looks likely to be the singer 's next career : as America 's in @-@ house eccentric , fearless enough to satirize the country 's traditions but canny enough to know that while you can deface as many Irving Berlin songs as you like , the turkey is non @-@ negotiable . " In contrast , A Very Gaga Thanksgiving was critically panned by Jen Carlson of <unk> , who felt that it was a " very transparent marketing ploy for the new Gaga holiday release . " 
 The Washington Post 's Sarah Anne Hughes stated that she was shocked at how traditional Gaga was in the television special . Cavan <unk> of International Business Times asserted that A Very Gaga Thanksgiving was a " charming throwback to holiday specials of times past . " <unk> praised the outfits , and drew comparisons to those of Elizabeth Taylor and Ava Gardner . In concurrence , Joe Drake of Ology wrote : " This special was [ fabulous ] . I have nothing bad to say about it . Lady Gaga proves , yet again , that she is the artist of our generation . Her talent , beauty , personality and spirit make her such an incredible person to look up to and respect . " At the 2012 Dorian Awards , the special was nominated in the category of Best TV Musical Program of the Year , but lost to Glee and Gaga 's own concert special , Lady Gaga Presents the Monster Ball Tour : At Madison Square Garden .

 = Sesame Workshop = 
 Sesame Workshop ( SW , or " the Workshop " ) , formerly known as the Children 's Television Workshop ( CTW ) , is an American non @-@ profit organization behind the production of several educational children 's programs — including its first and best @-@ known , Sesame Street — that have run on public broadcasting around the world . Television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and foundation executive Lloyd Morrisett came up with the idea to form an organization to oversee the production of Sesame Street , a television show which would help children , especially those from low @-@ income families , prepare for school . They spent two years , from 1966 to 1968 , researching , developing , and raising money for the new show . Cooney was named as the Workshop 's first executive director , which was called " one of the most important television developments of the decade " . 
 Sesame Street premiered on PBS in the United States in November 1969 , and the Workshop was formally incorporated shortly after , in 1970 . Gerald S. Lesser and Edward L. Palmer were hired to conduct research for the show ; they were responsible for developing a system of planning , production , and evaluation , and the interaction between television producers and educators , later called the " CTW model " . They also hired a staff of producers and writers . After the initial success of Sesame Street , they began to plan for its continued survival , which included procuring additional sources of funding and creating other TV shows . The early 1980s were a challenging period for the Workshop ; difficulty in finding audiences for their other productions and a series of bad investments hurt the organization until licensing agreements stabilized its revenues by 1985 . 
 After Sesame Street 's initial success , the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show , since their funding sources were made up of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects , not sustain them . Government funding ended by 1981 , so the CTW expanded into other areas , including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs , the publications of books and music , international co @-@ productions , interactive media and new technologies , licensing arrangements , and outreach programs to preschools . By 2005 , income from the CTW 's international co @-@ productions of the show was $ 96 million . By 2008 , the Sesame Street Muppets accounted for $ 15 – 17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees . Cooney stepped down as CEO in 1990 ; David Britt was named as her replacement . In June 2000 , the CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop , to better reflect its work beyond television and into interactive media , and Gary Knell became CEO . H. Melvin Ming replaced Knell in 2011 . In 2014 , Ming was succeeded by Jeffrey D. Dunn .

 = = = Background = = = 
 In the late 1960s , 97 % of all American households owned a television set , and preschool children watched an average of 27 hours of television per week . Early childhood educational research at the time had shown that when children were prepared to succeed in school , they earned higher grades and learned more effectively . Children from low @-@ income families , however , had fewer resources than children from higher @-@ income families to prepare them for school . Research had shown that children from low @-@ income , minority backgrounds tested " substantially lower " than middle @-@ class children in school @-@ related skills , and that they continued to have educational deficits throughout school . The field of developmental psychology had grown during this period , and scientists were beginning to understand that changes in early childhood education could increase children 's cognitive growth . 
 In the winter of 1966 , Joan Ganz Cooney hosted what she called " a little dinner party " at her apartment near Gramercy Park . In attendance was her husband Tim Cooney , her boss Lewis Freedman , and Lloyd and Mary Morrisett , whom the Cooneys knew socially . Cooney was a producer of documentary films at New York public broadcasting station Channel 13 , and won an Emmy for a documentary about poverty in America . Lloyd Morrisett was a vice @-@ president at Carnegie Corporation , and was responsible for funding educational research , but had been frustrated in his efforts because they were unable to reach the large numbers of children in need of early education and intervention . Cooney was committed to using television to change society , and Morrisett was interested in using television to " reach greater numbers of needy kids " . The conversation during the party , which according to writer Michael Davis was the start of a five @-@ decade long professional relationship between Cooney and Morrisett , turned to the possibilities of using television to educate young children . A week later , Cooney and Freedman met with Morrisett at the offices of Carnegie Corporation to discuss doing a feasibility study on creating an educational television program for preschoolers . Cooney was chosen to conduct the study . 
 In the summer of 1967 , Cooney took a leave of absence from Channel 13 , and funded by Carnegie Corporation , traveled the U.S. and Canada interviewing experts in child development , education , and television . She reported her findings in a fifty @-@ five @-@ page document entitled " The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool Education " . The report described what the new show , which became Sesame Street , would look like and proposed the creation of a company that oversaw its production , which eventually became known as the Children 's Television Workshop ( CTW ) . 
 = = = Founding = = = 
 For the next two years , Cooney and Morrisett worked on researching and developing the new show , raising $ 8 million for Sesame Street , and establishing the CTW . Due to her professional experience , Cooney always assumed the show 's natural home would be PBS . Morrisett was open to airing it on commercial stations , but all three networks rejected the idea . Davis , considering Sesame Street 's stream of licensing income in the decades to come , called their decision " a billion @-@ dollar blunder " . Morrisett was responsible for fund @-@ raising , and was so successful at it that writer Lee D. Mitgang later said that it " defied conventional media wisdom " . Cooney was responsible for the show 's creative development , and for hiring the production and research staff for the CTW . The Carnegie Corporation provided their initial $ 1 million grant , and Morrisett , using his contacts , procured additional multimillion @-@ dollar grants from the U.S. federal government , the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations , the Corporation for Public Broadcasting , and the Ford Foundation . Morrisett 's friend Harold Howe , who was the commissioner for the U.S. Department of Education , promised $ 4 million , half of the new organization 's budget . The Carnegie Corporation donated an additional $ 1 million . Mitgang stated , " Had Morrisett been any less effective in lining up financial support , Cooney 's report likely would have become just another long @-@ forgotten foundation idea " . Funds gained from a combination of government agencies and private foundations protected them from the economic pressures experienced by commercial networks , but caused challenges in procuring future funding . 
 Cooney 's proposal included using in @-@ house formative research that would inform and improve production , and independent summative evaluations to test the show 's impact on its young viewers ' learning . In 1967 , Morrisett recruited Harvard professor Gerald S. Lesser , whom he had met while they were both psychology students at Yale , to help develop and lead the Workshop 's research department . In 1972 , the Markle Foundation donated $ 72 @,@ 000 to Harvard to form the Center for Research in Children 's Television , which served as a research arm for the CTW . Harvard produced about 20 major research studies about Sesame Street and its effect on young children . Lesser also served as the first chairman of the Workshop 's advisory board , a position he held until his retirement in 1997 . According to Lesser , the CTW 's advisory board was unusual because instead of rubber @-@ stamping the Workshop 's decisions like most boards for other children 's TV shows , it contributed significantly to the show 's design and implementation . Lesser reported in Children and Television : Lessons from Sesame Street , his 1974 book about the beginnings of Sesame Street and the Children 's Television Workshop , that roughly 8 — 10 % of the Workshop 's initial budget was spent on research . 
 CTW 's summative research was done by the Workshop 's first research director , Edward L. Palmer , whom they met at the curriculum seminars Lesser conducted in Boston in the summer of 1967 . In the summer of 1968 , Palmer began to create educational goals , define the Workshop 's research activities , and hire his research team . Lesser and Palmer were the only scientists in the U.S. studying children and television at the time . They were responsible for developing a system of planning , production , and evaluation , and the interaction between television producers and educators , later called the " CTW model " . Cooney observed of the CTW model : " From the beginning , we — the planners of the project — designed the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers , researchers , and television producers collaborating as equal partners " . She described the collaboration as an " arranged marriage " . 
 The CTW devoted 8 % of its initial budget to outreach and publicity . In what television historian Robert W. Morrow called " an extensive campaign " that Lesser stated " would demand at least as much ingenuity as production and research " , the Workshop promoted the show with educators , the broadcast industry , and the show 's target audience , which consisted of inner @-@ city children and their families . They hired Evelyn Davis from the Urban League , whom Michael Davis called " remarkable , unsinkable , and indispensable " , as the Workshop 's first Vice President of Community Relations and head of the Workshop 's Community Educational Services ( CES ) division . Bob Hatch was hired to publicize their new show , both before its premiere and to take advantage of the media attention that surrounded Sesame Street in its first year of production . 
 According to Davis , despite her leadership in the project 's initial research and development , Cooney 's installment as CTW 's executive director was put in doubt due to her lack of high @-@ level managerial experience and leadership , untested financial management skills , and lack of experience in children 's television and education . Davis also speculated that sexism was involved , stating , " Doubters also questioned whether a woman could gain the full confidence of a quorum of men from the federal government and two elite philanthropies , institutions whose wealth exceeded the gross national product of entire countries " . At first , Cooney did not fight for the position . However she had the support of her husband and Morrisett , and the project 's investors soon realized they could not go forward without her . She was eventually named to the post in February 1968 . As one of the first female executives in American television , her appointment was called " one of the most important television developments of the decade " . The formation of the Children Television Workshop was announced at a press conference at the Waldorf @-@ Astoria Hotel in New York City on 20 May 1968 . 
 After her appointment , Cooney hired Bob Davidson as her assistant ; he was responsible for making agreements with approximately 180 public television stations to air the new show . She assembled a team of producers : Jon Stone was responsible for writing , casting , and format ; David Connell took over animation and volume production ; and Samuel Gibbon served as the show 's chief liaison between the production staff and the research team . Stone , Connell , and Gibbon had worked on another children 's show , Captain Kangaroo , together . Cooney later said about Sesame Street 's original team of producers , " collectively , we were a genius " . CTW 's first children 's show , Sesame Street , premiered on 10 November 1969 . The CTW was not incorporated until 1970 because its creators wanted to see if the show was a success before they hired lawyers and accountants . Morrisett served as the first chair of CTW 's board of trustees , a position he held for 28 years . 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 During the second season of Sesame Street , to capitalize on the momentum the Workshop was enjoying and the attention it received from the press , the Workshop created its second show , The Electric Company , in 1971 . Morrisett used the same fund @-@ raising techniques as he had used for Sesame Street . The Electric Company stopped production in 1977 , but continued in re @-@ runs until 1985 ; it eventually became one of the most widely used TV shows in American classrooms and was revived in 2009 . Starting in the early 1970s , the Workshop ventured into adult programming , but found that it was difficult to make their programs accessible to all socio @-@ economic groups . In 1971 , it produced a medical program for adults called Feelin ' Good , hosted by Dick Cavett , which ran until 1974 . According to writer Cary O 'Dell , the show " lacked a clear direction and never found a large audience " . In 1977 , the Workshop aired an adult drama called Best of Families , which was set in New York City around the turn of the 20th century . However , it lasted for six or seven episodes and helped the Workshop decide to focus on children 's programs only . 
 Throughout the 1970s , the CTW 's outreach efforts turned from promotion to the development of educational materials used in preschool settings . Early outreach efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the inner cities , in Appalachia , in Native American communities , and in migrant worker camps . In the early 1980s , the CTW created the Preschool Education Program ( PEP ) , whose goal was to assist preschools , by combining television viewing , books , hands @-@ on activities , and other media , in using the show as an educational resource . The Workshop also provided materials to non @-@ English speaking children and adults . Starting in 2006 , the Workshop expanded its outreach by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs focusing on how military deployment affects the families of soldiers . The Workshop 's outreach efforts also focused on families of prisoners , health and wellness , and safety . 
 According to Cooney and O 'Dell , the 1980s were a challenging period for the Workshop . Other than Sesame Street , many of its productions struggled finding an audience . 3 @-@ 2 @-@ 1 Contact premiered in 1980 , and ran in various forms until 1988 . The CTW found that finding funding for this show and other science @-@ oriented shows like Square One TV , which ran from 1987 to 1994 , was easy because the National Science Foundation and other foundations were interested in funding science education . A series of poor investments in video games , motion picture production , theme parks , and other business ventures hurt the organization financially . Cooney brought in Bill Whaley in the late 1970s to work on their licensing agreements , but he was unable to make up for the CTW 's losses until 1986 , when licensing revenues stabilized and its portfolio investments increased . 
 = = = Later years = = = 
 Cooney stepped down as chairman and chief executive officer of the CTW in 1990 , when she was replaced by David Britt , who was her " chief lieutenant in the executive ranks through the mid @-@ 1990s " and whom Cooney called her " right @-@ hand for many years " . Britt had worked for her at the CTW since 1975 and had served as its president and chief operating officer since 1988 . At that time , Cooney became chairman of the Workshop 's executive board , which oversaw its businesses and licensing , and became more involved in the organization 's creative side . 
 The Workshop went through a reorganization in 1995 , and laid off about 12 percent of its staff . In 1998 , for the first time in the show 's history , they accepted funds from corporations to support Sesame Street and its other programs , a move criticized by consumer advocate Ralph Nader . The Workshop defended the move to corporate sponsorship , stating that it made up for a decrease in government subsidies and financial support by PBS . Also in 1998 , the Workshop invested $ 25 million in the cable channel Noggin , launched in 1999 by the Workshop and Viacom 's Nickelodeon . In 2000 , the profit the CTW earned from the deal , along with its 1998 spike in revenue caused in part by the " Tickle Me Elmo " craze , enabled the CTW to purchase The Jim Henson Company 's rights to the Sesame Street Muppets from the German media company <unk> , which had acquired Henson earlier that year . The transaction , valued at $ 180 million , also included a small interest Henson held in the Noggin cable channel . Gary Knell stated , " Everyone , most especially the puppeteers , were thrilled that we were able to bring them home . It protected Sesame Street and allowed our international expansion to continue . Owning these characters has allowed us to maximize their potential . We are now in control of our own destiny " . 
 The CTW changed its name to the Sesame Workshop ( SW ) in June 2000 to better reflect its entry into non @-@ television and interactive media . Also in 2000 , Gary Knell succeeded Britt as president and CEO of the Workshop ; according to Davis , he " presided over an especially fertile period in the nonprofit 's history " . Knell was instrumental in the creation of the cable channel Sprout in 2005 . Sprout ( launched as PBS Kids Sprout ) was founded as a partnership between the Workshop , Comcast , PBS , and HIT Entertainment , all of whom contributed programming to the new network . After seven years as a partner , the Workshop divested its stake in Sprout in December 2012 . 
 In 2007 , the Sesame Workshop founded The Joan Ganz Cooney Center , an independent , non @-@ profit organization that studies how to improve children 's literacy by using and developing digital technologies " grounded in detailed educational curriculum " , just as was done during the development of Sesame Street . In 2009 , the SW launched a website with a library of free video clips and free podcasts from throughout the show 's history . 
 The 2008 – 2009 recession , which led to budget cuts for many nonprofit arts organizations , severely affected the SW ; in 2009 , it had to lay off 20 % of its staff . Despite earning about $ 100 million from licensing revenue , royalties , and foundation and government support in 2012 , the Workshop 's total revenue was down 15 % and its operating loss doubled to $ 24 @.@ 3 million . In 2013 , it responded by laying off 10 % of its staff , saying that it was necessary to " strategically focus " their resources because of " today 's rapidly changing digital environment " . In 2011 , Knell left the SW to become the chief executive at NPR ; H. Melvin Ming was named as his replacement . Ming had been chief financial officer since 1999 and its chief operating officer since 2002 . 
 In 2014 , H. Melvin Ming retired and was succeeded by former HIT Entertainment and Nickelodeon executive Jeffery D. Dunn . Dunn 's appointment marked the first time someone outside of the SW became its leader , although he had close ties with the organization previously . As of December 2014 , the senior management at the SW consisted of : Dr. Lewis Bernstein , Executive Vice President and head of Education Research and Outreach ; Terry Fitzpatrick , who was Executive Vice President and responsible for content distribution ; Myung Kang @-@ <unk> , Executive Vice President and General Counsel and Secretary ; Daryl Mintz , Chief Financial Officer ; Sherrie Westin , Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer ; and Michael H. Levine , Executive Director of the Joan Ganz Cooney Center . The organization 's board of trustees included , among others : its chair , Vincent A. Mai , who was also chairman of AEA Investors , Inc . ; Cooney , Morrisett , and Dunn . 
 = = Funding sources = = 
 After Sesame Street 's initial success , the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show , since its funding sources were made up of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects , not sustain them . Although the organization was what Cooney called " the darling of the federal government for a brief period of two or three years " , its first ten years of existence was marked by conflicts between the two ; in 1978 , the US Department of Education refused to deliver a $ 2 million check until the last day of the CTW 's fiscal year . According to Davis , the federal government was opposed to funding public television , but the Workshop used Cooney 's prestige and fame , and the fact that there would be " great public outcry " if the show was de @-@ funded , to withstand the government 's attacks on PBS . Eventually , the CTW got its own line item in the federal budget , but by 1981 , government funding for Sesame Street had been terminated . 
 For the first time , a public broadcasting show had the potential to earn a great deal of money . Immediately after its premiere , Sesame Street gained attention from marketers , so the Workshop explored sources such as licensing arrangements , publishing , and international sales , and became , as Cooney envisioned , a " multiple media institution " . Licensing became the foundation of , as writer Louise Gikow put it , the Sesame Workshop endowment , which had the potential to support the organization and fund future productions and projects . Muppet creator Jim Henson owned the trademarks to the Muppet characters : he was reluctant to market them at first , but agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys , books , and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW . The producers demanded complete control over all products and product decisions throughout its history ; any product line associated with the show had to be educational , inexpensive , and not advertised during airings of Sesame Street . As Davis reported , " Cooney stressed restraint , prudence , and caution " in their marketing and licensing efforts . In the early 1970s , the CTW approached Random House to establish and manage a non @-@ broadcast materials division . Random House and the CTW named Christopher Cerf to assist the CTW in publishing books and other materials that emphasized the show 's curriculum . 
 Shortly after the premiere of Sesame Street , the CTW was approached by producers , educators , and officials in other nations , requesting that a version of the show be aired in their countries . Former CBS executive Mike Dann left commercial television to become vice @-@ president of the CTW and Cooney 's assistant , and began what Charlotte Cole , vice president for the CTW 's International Research department in 2001 , called the " globalization " of Sesame Street by arranging what came to be called co @-@ productions , or independent programs with their own sets , characters , and curriculum goals . By 2009 , Sesame Street had expanded into 140 countries ; The New York Times reported in 2005 that income from the CTW 's international co @-@ productions of the show was $ 96 million . By 2008 , the Sesame Street Muppets accounted for between $ 15 million and $ 17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees , split between the Workshop and Henson Associates . 
 = = = Publishing = = = 
 In 1970 , the CTW established a department overseeing the development of " <unk> " materials based upon Sesame Street . The Workshop decided that all materials its licensing program created would " underscore and amplify " the show 's curriculum . Coloring books , for example , were prohibited because the Workshop felt they would restrict children 's imaginations . The CTW published Sesame Street Magazine in 1970 , which incorporated the show 's curriculum goals in a magazine format . As with the show , research was conducted for the magazine , initially by CTW 's research department for a year and a half , and then by the Magazine Research Group in 1975 . 
 Working with Random House editor Jason Epstein , the CTW hired Christopher Cerf to run Sesame Street 's book publishing program . In the division 's first year , Cerf earned $ 900 @,@ 000 for the CTW . He left to become more involved with writing and composing music for the show , and was eventually replaced by Bill Whaley . Ann Kearns , vice president of licensing for the CTW in 2009 , stated that Whaley was responsible for expanding the licensing to other products , and for creating a licensing model followed by other children 's shows . As of 2001 , there were over 600 books available in the Sesame Street library , and as researcher Renee <unk> @-@ O 'Leary stated , " the print materials produced by CTW have been an enduring part of the legacy of Sesame Street " . In one of these books , for example , the death of the Sesame Street character Mr. Hooper was dealt with in a book entitled I 'll Miss You , Mr. Hooper , published shortly after the show dealt with it in 1983 . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 According to director Jon Stone , the music of Sesame Street was unlike any other children 's program on television . For the first time , the show 's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and supported its curriculum . Cooney observed in her initial report that children had an " affinity for commercial jingles " , so many of the show 's songs were constructed like television ads . 
 To attract the best composers and lyricists , and to encourage them to compose more music for the show , the CTW allowed songwriters to retain the rights to the songs they wrote . For the first time in children 's television , the writers earned lucrative profits , which as Davis reported , " helped the show sustain the level of public interest in the show " . Scriptwriters often wrote their own lyrics to accompany their scripts . Songwriters of note were Joe Raposo , Jeff Moss , Christopher Cerf , Tony Geiss , and Norman Stiles . Many of the songs written for Sesame Street have become what writer David Borgenicht called " timeless classics " . These songs included the " Sesame Street Theme " ( also known as " Sunny Day " ) , " I Love Trash " , " Rubber Duckie " , " Bein ' Green " , and " Sing " . Many Sesame Street songs were recorded by well @-@ known artists such as Barbra Streisand , Lena Horne , Dizzy Gillespie , Paul Simon , and Jose Feliciano . 
 The show 's first album , Sesame Street Book & Record , recorded in 1970 , went gold and won a Grammy . Entertainment Weekly reported that by 1991 , Sesame Street had received eight Grammys . According to Gikow , Raposo won three Emmys and four Grammys for his work on the show .

 Shortly after Sesame Street debuted in the US , the CTW was approached independently by producers from several countries to produce versions of the show in their countries . Cooney remarked , " To be frank , I was really surprised , because we thought we were creating the quintessential American show . We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American , and it turns out they 're the most international characters ever created " . She hired former CBS executive Mike Dann , who left commercial television to become her assistant , as a CTW vice @-@ president . One of Dann 's tasks was to field offers to produce versions of Sesame Street in other countries . In response to Dann 's appointment , television critic Marvin Kitman said , " After [ Dann ] sells [ Sesame Street ] in Russia and Czechoslovakia , he might try Mississippi , where it is considered too controversial for educational TV " . This was a reference to the May 1970 Mississippi state commission decision to ban the show . By summer 1970 , Dann had made the first international agreements for what the CTW came to call " co @-@ productions " . 
 The earliest international versions were what CTW vice @-@ president Charlotte Cole and her colleagues called " fairly simple " , consisting of dubbed versions of the show with local language voice @-@ overs and instructional cutaways . Dubbed versions of the show continued to be produced if the country 's needs and resources warranted it . Eventually , a variant of the CTW model was used to create and produce independently produced preschool television shows in other countries . By 2006 , there were twenty co @-@ productions . In 2001 , there were over 120 million viewers of all international versions of Sesame Street , and by the show 's 40th anniversary in 2009 , they were seen in more than 140 countries . In 2005 , Doreen Carvajal of The New York Times reported that income from the co @-@ productions and international licensing accounted for $ 96 million . As Cole and her colleagues reported in 2001 , " Children 's Television Workshop ( CTW ) can be regarded as the single largest informal educator of young children in the world " .

 Ten years after the premiere of Sesame Street , the CTW began experimenting with new technologies . In 1979 , it began to plan the development of a theme park , Sesame Place , which opened in 1980 in Langhorne , Pennsylvania . Three international parks , Parque Plaza <unk> in Monterrey , Mexico since 1995 , Universal Studios Japan , and Vila <unk> Kids ' Land in Brazil were later built . One of the park 's features was a computer gallery , which was developed by a small in @-@ house team and included 55 computer programs . The team evolved into the Children 's Computer Workshop ( CCW ) in 1982 , which was disbanded and became the Interactive Technologies division of the CTW in the late 1980s . As Sesame Street researcher Shalom M. Fisch pointed out , no television show could be as interactive as computer games , even " participatory " shows like Blue 's Clues or the Sesame Street segment " Elmo 's World " . The CTW has chosen to take advantage of the contingent feedback inherent in interactive computer games by developing and creating educational software based upon the television show 's content and curriculum . 
 In 2008 , a new " research @-@ driven " website was created ; it reached 18 million downloads in one month . Also in 2008 , the Sesame Workshop began to offer clips and full @-@ length episodes on Hulu , YouTube , and iTunes , where " Word on the Street " segments became the most popular webcast . In 2010 , the Workshop began offering eBooks through the show 's website , including a free rotating selection of five titles . Their selection of eBooks came in a variety of formats , some of which were interactive , and covered nineteen subject areas , including letters , numbers , counting , colors , and cultural appreciation .

 = Castlevania : Portrait of Ruin = 
 Castlevania : Portrait of Ruin , known in Japan as Akumajō Dracula : Gallery of Labyrinth ( <unk> <unk> ・ オブ ・ <unk> , translated Devil 's Castle Dracula : Gallery of Labyrinth ) , is a platform @-@ adventure game developed and published by Konami . The game was released on November 16 , 2006 in Japan , and in the US on December 5 , 2006 for the Nintendo DS handheld game console . Portrait of Ruin is the first Castlevania to feature a cooperative multiplayer gameplay mode and the first handheld Castlevania to have English voice @-@ overs , outside of its original Japanese release . 
 Portrait of Ruin is set in 1944 Europe during World War II , and is a continuation of the story from Castlevania : Bloodlines . The game introduces new protagonists and antagonists to the Castlevania series as well as expand on the two character gameplay found in the previous Nintendo DS Castlevania title , Castlevania : Dawn of Sorrow . Portrait of Ruin has met with an overall positive critical response and has received high ratings from reviews , along with several awards . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Portrait of Ruin features a 2D side @-@ scrolling style of gameplay . One of the main features to the gameplay is that players can switch freely between two characters , Jonathan and Charlotte , similar to the " Julius mode " from Castlevania : Dawn of Sorrow . Jonathan and Charlotte can combine their powers to perform a powerful attack together known as " Dual Crush " , and their combined abilities are needed in certain parts of the castle for them to solve puzzles and progress through the story . For example , the player must have both characters board two " motorcycles " and alternate between them to dodge obstacles to have both motorcycles intact to crash through a wall . 
 Aside from Dracula 's castle , Jonathan and Charlotte explore other environments such as Egyptian @-@ like deserts and London @-@ like towns via paintings dispersed throughout the castle . During the adventure , the heroes encounter 155 different enemies , which are kept track in a bestiary . Many enemies from previous Castlevania titles make appearances either as standard monsters or bosses for the sections of the castle and paintings . As they progress , the duo learn new skills and acquire equipment and items which allow further exploration in the game . 
 Like previous Castlevania games , this game features alternate endings . Portrait of Ruin has two different endings . Both involve Jonathan and Charlotte preventing Dracula from being resurrected , but only one involves the defeat of Brauner , another vampire enemy , and the Actual defeat of Dracula . At one point in the game , the player 's actions determine which ending will be obtained . The first ending is normally referred to as the " bad " ending because the main objectives of the game 's story are not completed ; to indicate this , the game will display a " Game over " screen instead of the credits . The second ending completes those objectives and allows the player to explore more of Dracula 's castle and gain access to more paintings . This ending is considered the canonical ending to the game . 
 = = = Alternate modes = = = 
 Portrait of Ruin features alternate modes of gameplay ; four single player modes for the main story and a " Boss Rush " mode that can be played with either one or two players . Aside from Health and Magic Power enhancements , items cannot be obtained nor used in any of the extra modes of the main game . Initially , only one story mode is available and features the main protagonists , Jonathan and Charlotte . After obtaining the better of the two endings with Jonathan and Charlotte , the player will unlock a prologue to the main story , " Sisters Mode " , and additional stages in the Boss Rush Mode . Completing the game also gives the player the option to increase the difficulty , add level caps on new games , and start a game with all previously obtained items and skills . If the player meets certain requirements in the game , two other versions of the main story mode are made available ; " Richter Mode " and " Old Axe Armor Mode " . 
 In " Sisters Mode " , the player controls Loretta and Stella Lecarde . This mode serves as a prologue to the storyline in Jonathan 's Mode . They have different controls compared to the normal gameplay in that attacks are controlled completely with the stylus . Loretta is able to use an ice spell which is aimed with the player 's stylus , and Stella is able to damage enemies and objects that the player passes the stylus over . Instead of reaching Dracula , the game ends when Brauner is reached . <unk> mode allows the player to control Richter Belmont and Maria Renard , the latter in the first time as a playable character in an American or European release . There are a few minor differences in the control scheme , and they begin with all of their mobility upgrades , which allows the player to explore the castle freely from the beginning . ' Richter ' is also misspelled as <unk> within dialogue boxes in the main game . In Old Axe Armor mode , the player controls the Old Axe Armor enemy . Because there is only one character , the player is unable to switch characters as in the other modes . The character also lacks any magic spells and has only two sub @-@ weapons . 
 Boss Rush Mode is separate from the main game ; essentially , it is a time attack mode . There are three separate stages to choose from , though initially only one is available . The other two become available after obtaining the true ending of the game . Each stage is a series of rooms that the player traverses from left to right . Within each room is a boss or collection of monsters from the game . Depending on how quickly a player completes each stage , they will be rewarded with special items which can be added to the inventory of the normal game . This mode also features a wireless , cooperative two player option .

 Portrait of Ruin is the first game in the Castlevania franchise with cooperative multiplayer . However , this is the second multiplayer Castlevania game ; Dawn of Sorrow , also for the DS , was the first to have a multiplayer mode . Players can interact through either the Co @-@ op mode or a Shop mode . Both modes can connect by local wireless or Nintendo Wi @-@ Fi . The online cooperative mode allows two players to complete Boss Rushes together . The character used in this mode can be chosen at the beginning and is selected from a list of characters that is unlocked through the standard gameplay . The Co @-@ op mode is initially limited to one boss @-@ run challenge , but after a file is beaten , two more challenges become available . The online Shop mode allows players to sell their items to other player . When another player buys the item , the selling player gains the money , but doesn 't lose the item . 
 = = Plot and setting = = 
 Portrait of Ruin takes place in the fictional universe of the Castlevania series . The series ' premise is the conflict between the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan and the immortal vampire Dracula . The story occurs in Dracula 's castle and is set in 1944 Europe during World War II . In addition to the castle , the main characters explore various different paintings that have been constructed by Brauner , a villain . The paintings act as portals to new areas and feature a distinct look that is different from the main castle . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 Portrait of Ruin introduces new characters to the Castlevania series . The main protagonists are Jonathan Morris and Charlotte <unk> . Jonathan is the current wielder of the legendary whip , " Vampire Killer " , which was passed down to him by his father , John Morris from Castlevania : Bloodlines . As he is not a direct descendant of the Belmont clan , he is unable to unlock the Vampire Killer 's full power without the assistance of a member of the Lecarde family . Charlotte is a mage and distant descendant of the Belnades clan . The game features the same antagonists as previous Castlevania titles and introduces three new ones . The main villain is Dracula and serves as the game 's final boss . Despite his previous incarnations in the timeline , such as Symphony of the Night , Dracula has short , black hair and no facial hair . 
 The new antagonists are three vampires that have taken control of Dracula 's castle . Leading them is Brauner , an elderly vampire based on the real life artist Victor Brauner from the same time period . Brauner recreated Dracula 's castle using the souls of the dead from World War II in order to draw power from the castle . He plans to use that power to destroy humanity . He disdains humanity , because his two real daughters had been killed 30 years prior during World War I. Brauner is able to construct paintings that contain pocket dimensions in order to harness the castle 's power for his own purposes . He is joined by vampire sisters , Stella and Loretta . Although the two are vampires , they are actually Eric Lecarde 's daughters . After being turned into vampires by Brauner , the sisters believe Brauner is their father . In the bad ending Brauner gives up and escapes from the castle in order to save the life of their two adopted daughters . 
 Assisting the two main characters are a priest named Vincent Dorin and a ghost that introduces himself as " Wind " . Vincent acts as a merchant to the two characters and sells weapons , potions and skills . Wind provides Jonathan and Charlotte new skills and equipment that once belonged to him if they perform certain tasks called " quests " . Wind 's identity is eventually revealed to be Eric Lecarde , who once fought alongside Jonathan 's father to slay Dracula in Bloodlines , and that Eric is Stella and Loretta 's true father . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 Prior to the start of the game , the two sisters , Stella and Loretta travel to Dracula 's castle in search of their father , Eric Lecarde . After traversing through the castle , the two arrive at Brauner 's lair where they find their father defeated . Seeing the two sisters , Brauner grabs them and turns them into vampires . At the beginning of the game , Jonathan and Charlotte encounter Vincent at the gates of the castle , who serves as a merchant . Upon entering the castle , Jonathan and Charlotte encounter an enigmatic blue figure that they first identify as hostile . After the figure transforms into a humanoid male , he explains that he was killed a short time ago and had cast a magical barrier to keep himself conscious while still within the confines of the castle . He introduces himself as " Wind " . 
 Shortly after meeting Wind , Jonathan and Charlotte find one of Brauner 's magical portraits . Unable to destroy it from outside , the two travel into the world within . Soon , they find Brauner 's channeler , a <unk> . Shortly after its defeat , one of the vampire sisters appears and disdains their efforts , saying their control is lessened in only a minor degree . Later , when entering the second portrait , they find Brauner and the two twins ; Brauner laughs at the notion of reviving Dracula , as he has failed too many times to control humanity , but concedes his power is too great to ignore . Both sisters desire to kill the two humans , but Brauner sees Dracula 's servant Death as a greater threat , as he could wrest control from him far more easily than them . While exploring the castle , Charlotte and Jonathan encounter Death , who acts as if Dracula were already revived . When informed Dracula is still dead , and that another vampire is controlling the castle , he scoffs at the idea of a hand other than Dracula 's to rule Castlevania . Yet , he is gravely disturbed when he sees the statements are true , and promptly leaves to seek a way to destroy Brauner and revive Dracula . 
 Jonathan and Charlotte encounter Stella at the base of the Tower of Death , and after being promptly defeated , she loses her locket as she flees with her sister . Opening the locket , Charlotte finds a photo of the twins with Wind , and both decide to question him . Wind confesses his true name , Eric Lecarde , and that the twins are his children . Later , Jonathan and Charlotte confront Death , who wants to disassociate himself from Brauner and has no desire to fight . Nevertheless , he engages them but is defeated and flees . When Jonathan and Charlotte reach the towering spire of the Master 's Keep , they find the Dracula 's throne room sealed off , and conclude that Brauner is delaying Dracula 's revival to siphon his power . 
 After searching the castle , Jonathan and Charlotte obtain the Sanctuary spell , a magical attack that dispels curses and allows the dead to rest in peace . During the battle with the twins , the sisters are cured of their vampirism by Charlotte 's spell . This allows them to regain their sanity , and they subsequently offer to perform a ritual that allows Jonathan to utilize the Vampire Killer whip 's full power . After Jonathan passes the test and defeats the Memory of the Whip , an entity bearing the likeness of Richter Belmont , he is warned against overusing it , as the Vampire Killer drains life force of a non @-@ Belmont wielding the full power , eventually killing the user as it did Jonathan 's father . After the twins are defeated , they open a passage leading to a massive storeroom that contains a portrait leading to Brauner 's studio . The two confront Brauner and defeat him . When confronted about his acts , he admits justice wasn 't on his side , but refuses to acknowledge it was on the heroes ' . Death suddenly hovers from above , and kills Brauner with one swing of his scythe . This act destroys the painting sealing the Throne Room , and Jonathan and Charlotte then go to battle with Dracula . 
 Before they can engage Dracula , Death enters the room and sides with his master , and together they attack the heroes . During the course of the battle , Death and Dracula merge into a more powerful form , but they are eventually defeated by Jonathan and Charlotte . When destroyed , everyone flees the castle , and sees from the distance as the walls collapse . Later , the twins , Jonathan and Charlotte are visited in the fields outside the castle by Eric 's ghost , who gives some advice to the twins and thanks Charlotte and Jonathan for destroying the curse before his spirit finally fades from existence . As the four of them leave , they end up forgetting about Vincent , who is comically trying to get their attention as he chases after them .

 <unk> first announced a new Castlevania for the DS on October 5 , 2005 . Details of the game were not released until April 21 , 2006 , when Konami revealed the game 's title and its World War II setting . On May 9 , 2006 , the official trailer was shown at Konami 's official press conference . The trailer showcased the smooth player switching and combinations of Jonathan and <unk> 's abilities . In an interview with producer Koji Igarashi in June 2006 , it was revealed the game would try to utilize the touch screen better than Dawn of Sorrow . He also mentioned he was thinking of incorporating cooperative game play in an unlockable stage via WiFi . More information concerning online game play were released a month later at Comic @-@ Con 2006 , but details on how it would be implemented were still unconfirmed . At the 2006 Tokyo Game Show , Igarashi confirmed details about the WiFi modes and stated Portrait of Ruin would have a cooperative time attack and an online shop mode . 
 Because of Nintendo 's solid infrastructure for the DS , Igarashi wanted to try the online components , and test for possible online game play , in future Castlevania titles . Igarashi commented the two player game play was homage to Castlevania III : Dracula 's Curse , his favorite Castlevania game . The anime style of artwork was retained from Dawn of Sorrow , which Igarashi had switched to in the previous title to appeal more to the younger demographics of the Nintendo handheld systems . Portrait of Ruin 's development cycle took roughly the same amount of time as Dawn of Sorrow did . Koji Igarashi stated that the schedule became tight due to Nintendo Wi @-@ Fi difficulties , considering it was their first online enabled game . 
 = = = Audio = = = 
 Portrait of Ruin featured English voice @-@ overs for portions of the game . The original Japanese dialog was also included as an easter egg . Michiru Yamane returned to compose the music , with additional songs by Yuzo Koshiro . IGN noted that the style of the music tracks ranged from " hauntingly morose to almost jovially up @-@ tempo " . The audio tracks are also accessible via a " Sound Mode " that is unlocked by defeating Dracula . The player can also collect records of certain tracks that can be used to replace the game 's default background music . The songs " <unk> " and " In Search of the Secret Spell " that play in the Forgotten City level are originally from Konami 's own King 's Valley 2 released on the MSX2 computer .

 There were several pieces of Castlevania : Portrait of Ruin merchandise released along with the game . Strategy guides were released , both in Japan and North America . In Japan , Konami released an official strategy guide . In North America , the official strategy guide was released by BradyGames and featured a complete walkthrough , maps , and item lists . The most notable merchandise was the " 20th Anniversary Pre @-@ order Bundle " . In celebration of their 20th anniversary of the series , anyone that pre @-@ ordered Portrait of Ruin at any popular game outlet , received a free bundle , along with the game . The bundle includes a variety of Castlevania products contained in cardboard sleeve with a plastic Seal of the Castlevania logo . The products include : a soundtrack CD containing songs from the Castlevania series , a timeline poster covering many of the significant characters and events of Castlevania history , a 48 @-@ page art book containing artwork from the entire series , a clear / white game case designed to hold both Castlevania : Dawn of Sorrow and Castlevania : Portrait of Ruin , and an extendable stylus .

 Portrait of Ruin has met with overall positive reviews and received various awards . Game Informer awarded it " Handheld Game of the Month " for January 2007 , and listed it as one of the " Top 50 Games of 2006 " . Portrait of Ruin also won " Best Original Score " and was runner @-@ up for " Best Adventure Game " in IGN 's Best of 2006 . Dracula was listed as the third top villain of 2006 by Game Informer , citing the final boss fight in Portrait of Ruin as the reason . 1UP.com listed it as the " Best DS Game " in their " Best of E3 2006 " feature . The audio was well received . GameSpot called the music " excellent " and rated the sound a 9 out of 10 . Yahoo ! Games rated the sound a 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 . Game Informer called the audio a high point of the game , though complained about Charlotte always shouting the name of her attack . Game Informer also praised the cooperative element and felt that more games should be designed like it . IGN stated that " the dramatic score is enough to send a chill up your spine " , though mentioned that amount of vocals was sparse . GameZone ranked it as the ninth best Castlevania game . Robert Workman ( an editor for GameZone ) complimented it for its changes to the series that came without a sacrifice to quality . 
 The game play received mixed reviews , though most were overall positive . GamePro complimented the multiplayer components and noted that the game " not only reaffirms the series ' greatness , but is easily one of the best handheld games released this year . " They also rated the game a 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 in all categories . Eurogamer commented that the two character game play was complicated and sometimes awkward . They also compared it to its predecessor , stating that Portrait of Ruin deviated away from Dawn of Sorrow in terms of game play . Game Informer called it " one of the best experiences in gaming " and complimented the story , setting , and game play . Yahoo ! Games called the game play " addictive " and praised the two character game play . They also complimented the online multiplayer , the setting , and the freedom to play the game with or without the DS 's special functions , but criticized some of the dialog . IGN stated that the game was not " the mind @-@ blowing revelation that Dawn of Sorrow was " , but still complemented the " solid " game play and called it an enjoyable experience . GameSpot called it a great game because it " stays true to the familiar Castlevania design and delivers a fun , lengthy adventure . " Game Informer mentioned the two character play was " done before , but Portrait of Ruin 's system is particularly smooth in execution . " 
 = Linear probing = 
 Linear probing is a scheme in computer programming for resolving collisions in hash tables , data structures for maintaining a collection of key – value pairs and looking up the value associated with a given key . It was invented in 1954 by Gene Amdahl , Elaine M. McGraw , and Arthur Samuel and first analyzed in 1963 by Donald Knuth . 
 Along with quadratic probing and double hashing , linear probing is a form of open addressing . In these schemes , each cell of a hash table stores a single key – value pair . When the hash function causes a collision by mapping a new key to a cell of the hash table that is already occupied by another key , linear probing searches the table for the closest following free location and inserts the new key there . <unk> are performed in the same way , by searching the table sequentially starting at the position given by the hash function , until finding a cell with a matching key or an empty cell . 
 As Thorup & Zhang ( 2012 ) write , " Hash tables are the most commonly used nontrivial data structures , and the most popular implementation on standard hardware uses linear probing , which is both fast and simple . " Linear probing can provide high performance because of its good locality of reference , but is more sensitive to the quality of its hash function than some other collision resolution schemes . It takes constant expected time per search , insertion , or deletion when implemented using a random hash function , a 5 @-@ independent hash function , or tabulation hashing . 
 = = Operations = = 
 Linear probing is a component of open addressing schemes for using a hash table to solve the dictionary problem . In the dictionary problem , a data structure should maintain a collection of key – value pairs subject to operations that insert or delete pairs from the collection or that search for the value associated with a given key . In open addressing solutions to this problem , the data structure is an array T ( the hash table ) whose cells T [ i ] ( when nonempty ) each store a single key – value pair . A hash function is used to map each key into the cell of T where that key should be stored , typically scrambling the keys so that keys with similar values are not placed near each other in the table . A hash collision occurs when the hash function maps a key into a cell that is already occupied by a different key . Linear probing is a strategy for resolving collisions , by placing the new key into the closest following empty cell . 
 = = = Search = = = 
 To search for a given key x , the cells of T are examined , beginning with the cell at index h ( x ) ( where h is the hash function ) and continuing to the adjacent cells h ( x ) + 1 , h ( x ) + 2 , ... , until finding either an empty cell or a cell whose stored key is x . If a cell containing the key is found , the search returns the value from that cell . Otherwise , if an empty cell is found , the key cannot be in the table , because it would have been placed in that cell in preference to any later cell that has not yet been searched . In this case , the search returns as its result that the key is not present in the dictionary . 
 = = = Insertion = = = 
 To insert a key – value pair ( x , v ) into the table ( possibly replacing any existing pair with the same key ) , the insertion algorithm follows the same sequence of cells that would be followed for a search , until finding either an empty cell or a cell whose stored key is x . The new key – value pair is then placed into that cell . 
 If the insertion would cause the load factor of the table ( its fraction of occupied cells ) to grow above some preset threshold , the whole table may be replaced by a new table , larger by a constant factor , with a new hash function , as in a dynamic array . Setting this threshold close to zero and using a high growth rate for the table size leads to faster hash table operations but greater memory usage than threshold values close to one and low growth rates . A common choice would be to double the table size when the load factor would exceed 1 / 2 , causing the load factor to stay between 1 / 4 and 1 / 2 . 
 = = = Deletion = = = 
 It is also possible to remove a key – value pair from the dictionary . However , it is not sufficient to do so by simply emptying its cell . This would affect searches for other keys that have a hash value earlier than the emptied cell , but that are stored in a position later than the emptied cell . The emptied cell would cause those searches to incorrectly report that the key is not present . 
 Instead , when a cell i is emptied , it is necessary to search forward through the following cells of the table until finding either another empty cell or a key that can be moved to cell i ( that is , a key whose hash value is equal to or earlier than i ) . When an empty cell is found , then emptying cell i is safe and the deletion process terminates . But , when the search finds a key that can be moved to cell i , it performs this move . This has the effect of speeding up later searches for the moved key , but it also empties out another cell , later in the same block of occupied cells . The search for a movable key continues for the new emptied cell , in the same way , until it terminates by reaching a cell that was already empty . In this process of moving keys to earlier cells , each key is examined only once . Therefore , the time to complete the whole process is proportional to the length of the block of occupied cells containing the deleted key , matching the running time of the other hash table operations . 
 Alternatively , it is possible to use a lazy deletion strategy in which a key – value pair is removed by replacing the value by a special flag value indicating a deleted key . However , these flag values will contribute to the load factor of the hash table . With this strategy , it may become necessary to clean the flag values out of the array and rehash all the remaining key – value pairs once too large a fraction of the array becomes occupied by deleted keys . 
 = = Properties = = 
 Linear probing provides good locality of reference , which causes it to require few uncached memory accesses per operation . Because of this , for low to moderate load factors , it can provide very high performance . However , compared to some other open addressing strategies , its performance degrades more quickly at high load factors because of primary clustering , a tendency for one collision to cause more nearby collisions . Additionally , achieving good performance with this method requires a higher @-@ quality hash function than for some other collision resolution schemes . When used with low @-@ quality hash functions that fail to eliminate <unk> in the input distribution , linear probing can be slower than other open @-@ addressing strategies such as double hashing , which probes a sequence of cells whose separation is determined by a second hash function , or quadratic probing , where the size of each step varies depending on its position within the probe sequence . 
 = = Analysis = = 
 Using linear probing , dictionary operations can be implemented in constant expected time . In other words , insert , remove and search operations can be implemented in O ( 1 ) , as long as the load factor of the hash table is a constant strictly less than one . 
 In more detail , the time for any particular operation ( a search , insertion , or deletion ) is proportional to the length of the contiguous block of occupied cells at which the operation starts . If all starting cells are equally likely , in a hash table with N cells , then a maximal block of k occupied cells will have probability k / N of containing the starting location of a search , and will take time O ( k ) whenever it is the starting location . Therefore , the expected time for an operation can be calculated as the product of these two terms , O ( k2 / N ) , summed over all of the maximal blocks of contiguous cells in the table . A similar sum of squared block lengths gives the expected time bound for a random hash function ( rather than for a random starting location into a specific state of the hash table ) , by summing over all the blocks that could exist ( rather than the ones that actually exist in a given state of the table ) , and multiplying the term for each potential block by the probability that the block is actually occupied . That is , defining Block ( i , k ) to be the event that there is a maximal contiguous block of occupied cells of length k beginning at index i , the expected time per operation is 
 <formula> 
 This formula can be <unk> by replacing Block ( i , k ) by a simpler necessary condition Full ( k ) , the event that at least k elements have hash values that lie within a block of cells of length k . After this replacement , the value within the sum no longer depends on i , and the 1 / N factor cancels the N terms of the outer summation . These simplifications lead to the bound 
 <formula> 
 But by the multiplicative form of the Chernoff bound , when the load factor is bounded away from one , the probability that a block of length k contains at least k hashed values is exponentially small as a function of k , causing this sum to be bounded by a constant independent of n . It is also possible to perform the same analysis using Stirling 's approximation instead of the Chernoff bound to estimate the probability that a block contains exactly k hashed values . 
 In terms of the load factor α , the expected time for a successful search is O ( 1 + 1 / ( 1 − α ) ) , and the expected time for an unsuccessful search ( or the insertion of a new key ) is O ( 1 + 1 / ( 1 − α ) 2 ) . For constant load factors , with high probability , the longest probe sequence ( among the probe sequences for all keys stored in the table ) has logarithmic length . 
 = = Choice of hash function = = 
 Because linear probing is especially sensitive to unevenly distributed hash values , it is important to combine it with a high @-@ quality hash function that does not produce such irregularities . 
 The analysis above assumes that each key 's hash is a random number independent of the hashes of all the other keys . This assumption is unrealistic for most applications of hashing . However , random or pseudorandom hash values may be used when hashing objects by their identity rather than by their value . For instance , this is done using linear probing by the <unk> class of the Java collections framework . The hash value that this class associates with each object , its <unk> , is guaranteed to remain fixed for the lifetime of an object but is otherwise arbitrary . Because the <unk> is constructed only once per object , and is not required to be related to the object 's address or value , its construction may involve slower computations such as the call to a random or pseudorandom number generator . For instance , Java 8 uses an <unk> pseudorandom number generator to construct these values . 
 For most applications of hashing , it is necessary to compute the hash function for each value every time that it is hashed , rather than once when its object is created . In such applications , random or pseudorandom numbers cannot be used as hash values , because then different objects with the same value would have different hashes . And cryptographic hash functions ( which are designed to be computationally indistinguishable from truly random functions ) are usually too slow to be used in hash tables . Instead , other methods for constructing hash functions have been devised . These methods compute the hash function quickly , and can be proven to work well with linear probing . In particular , linear probing has been analyzed from the framework of k @-@ independent hashing , a class of hash functions that are initialized from a small random seed and that are equally likely to map any k @-@ tuple of distinct keys to any k @-@ tuple of indexes . The parameter k can be thought of as a measure of hash function quality : the larger k is , the more time it will take to compute the hash function but it will behave more similarly to completely random functions . For linear probing , 5 @-@ independence is enough to guarantee constant expected time per operation , while some 4 @-@ independent hash functions perform badly , taking up to logarithmic time per operation . 
 Another method of constructing hash functions with both high quality and practical speed is tabulation hashing . In this method , the hash value for a key is computed by using each byte of the key as an index into a table of random numbers ( with a different table for each byte position ) . The numbers from those table cells are then combined by a bitwise exclusive or operation . Hash functions constructed this way are only 3 @-@ independent . Nevertheless , linear probing using these hash functions takes constant expected time per operation . Both tabulation hashing and standard methods for generating 5 @-@ independent hash functions are limited to keys that have a fixed number of bits . To handle strings or other types of variable @-@ length keys , it is possible to compose a simpler universal hashing technique that maps the keys to intermediate values and a higher quality ( 5 @-@ independent or tabulation ) hash function that maps the intermediate values to hash table indices . 
 = = History = = 
 The idea of an associative array that allows data to be accessed by its value rather than by its address dates back to the mid @-@ 1940s in the work of Konrad Zuse and Vannevar Bush , but hash tables were not described until 1953 , in an IBM memorandum by Hans Peter <unk> . <unk> used a different collision resolution method , chaining , rather than linear probing . 
 Knuth ( 1963 ) summarizes the early history of linear probing . It was the first open addressing method , and was originally synonymous with open addressing . According to Knuth , it was first used by Gene Amdahl , Elaine M. McGraw ( née <unk> ) , and Arthur Samuel in 1954 , in an assembler program for the IBM 701 computer . The first published description of linear probing is by Peterson ( 1957 ) , who also credits Samuel , Amdahl , and <unk> but adds that " the system is so natural , that it very likely may have been conceived independently by others either before or since that time " . Another early publication of this method was by Soviet researcher Andrey <unk> , in 1958 . 
 The first theoretical analysis of linear probing , showing that it takes constant expected time per operation with random hash functions , was given by Knuth . Sedgewick calls Knuth 's work " a landmark in the analysis of algorithms " . Significant later developments include a more detailed analysis of the probability distribution of the running time , and the proof that linear probing runs in constant time per operation with practically usable hash functions rather than with the idealized random functions assumed by earlier analysis . 
 = Eastern Air Lines Flight 663 = 
 Eastern Air Lines Flight 663 was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Boston , Massachusetts , to Atlanta , Georgia , with scheduled stopovers at John F. Kennedy International Airport , New York ; Richmond , Virginia ; Charlotte , North Carolina ; and Greenville , South Carolina . On the night of February 8 , 1965 , the aircraft serving the flight , a Douglas DC @-@ 7 , crashed near Jones Beach State Park , New York , just after taking off from JFK Airport . All 79 passengers and five crew aboard perished . 
 National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) and Civil Aeronautics Board ( CAB ) investigations determined that evasive maneuvers undertaken by Flight 663 to avoid an oncoming Pan Am Boeing 707 caused the pilot to suffer spatial disorientation and lose control of the aircraft . The accident is the third @-@ worst accident involving a DC @-@ 7 . 
 = = Flight history = = 
 The Douglas DC @-@ 7 serving Flight 663 made its first flight in 1958 , and had subsequently accumulated a total of 18 @,@ 500 hours of flight time . It was piloted by Captain Frederick R. Carson , 41 , who had been employed by Eastern Air Lines for 19 years and who had accumulated 12 @,@ 607 hours of flight time . His copilot , First Officer Edward R. Dunn , 41 , a nine @-@ year veteran of Eastern Airlines , had 8 @,@ 550 hours of flight time . The flight engineer was Douglas C. Mitchell , 24 , with two years ' employment and 407 pilot hours and 141 hours flight engineer time . All had passed proficiency checks with the DC @-@ 7B aircraft . The two flight attendants aboard were Linda Lord and Judith Durkin . 
 The flight from Logan International Airport in Boston , Massachusetts , to John F. Kennedy International Airport , in New York , proceeded normally . Flight 663 departed JFK at 6 : 20 p.m. EDT on an instrument flight rules ( IFR ) clearance to Byrd Field ( now Richmond International Airport ) , in Richmond , Virginia . Take @-@ off proceeded normally , and the airport control @-@ tower prepared to hand over control to the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center ( ARTCC ) on Long Island , noting that Flight 663 was executing a Dutch seven departure , a routine takeoff procedure that required a series of turns over the Atlantic Ocean in order to avoid flying over New York City . The New York ARTCC responded with the information that Pan American Airways Flight 212 , a Boeing 707 , was descending to 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) in the same airspace . 
 Though the control tower responded that Flight 663 was at a higher altitude than Flight 212 , it was , in fact , lower . Subsequently , the control tower radioed the Pan Am flight that there was traffic in his airspace at 11 o 'clock , six miles away travelling southeast of Pam Am 's position , climbing above 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 m ) . Pan Am 212 acknowledged . Air traffic control then radioed Flight 663 a similar advisory : at 2 o 'clock , five miles away travelling , below Flight 663 's position . In reality , the traffic , Pan Am 212 , was above Flight 663 , descending from 5 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) . Captain Carson acknowledged that he saw the traffic , that he was beginning to turn into the Dutch seven departure , and signed off , saying , good night . 
 Flight 663 's radioed good night at 6 : 25 p.m. was the last transmission received from the flight . 
 = = Crash = = 
 The night of February 8 was dark , with no visible moon or stars , and no visible horizon . As the two airliners approached similar positions , their pilots had no points of reference with which to determine actual separation distance or position . Flight 663 's departure turn , and Pan Am 's subsequent turn left to its assigned heading , had placed the two aircraft on an apparent collision course . The Boeing rolled right and initiated a descent in an attempt to avoid a collision . In response , Eastern 663 initiated an extreme right turn in order to pass safely . The captain of Pan Am 212 later estimated that the two aircraft had passed between 200 and 500 feet ( 60 and 150 m ) of each other , while the first officer estimated that the distance was only 200 to 300 feet ( 60 to 90 m ) . 
 Flight 663 was unable to recover from its unusually steep bank and plunged into the icy water of the Atlantic Ocean , where it exploded with bright orange flames . The Pan American 707 was the first to relay news of the crash , as it was receiving permission to land . Air Canada Flight 627 , which had departed a few minutes prior to Flight 663 , also radioed news of an explosion in the water . 
 After the initial explosion , the wrecked aircraft sank to the bottom of 75 feet ( 23 m ) of water . Numerous air crews , including Pan Am 212 , Air Canada 627 , and Braniff Airlines Flight 5 , radioed ATC controllers in the area with news of an explosion . The aircraft broke up upon impact , and was destroyed . All five crewmembers and 79 passengers died on impact . 
 = = Aftermath and investigation = = 
 Fifteen ships , accompanied by eleven helicopters and numerous rescue divers converged on the scene of the crash in hopes of rendering aid to survivors . Two hours after impact , debris began floating up to the surface . By sunrise , seven bodies had been recovered ; three more were discovered in the course of the following three days . In locating the wreckage , the United States Navy provided underwater sonar to assist with the operation . Thirteen Coast Guard vessels helped searching the shores of Long Island and provided salvage efforts . Rescue workers and volunteers scoured 40 miles ( 64 km ) of beaches , collecting debris that washed ashore . 
 The Civil Aeronautics Board ( CAB ) investigated the accident . The DC @-@ 7 was not required to be equipped with a flight recorder , which would have automatically recorded the pilots ' every control input . Thus , the CAB was forced to rely on witness testimony , radio recordings , and a best guess based on experience . Nevertheless , the CAB determined that the evasive maneuvers taken by the pilot of Flight 663 in order to avoid the oncoming Pan Am jet caused spatial disorientation . The disorientation , coupled with the extreme maneuver , made it impossible for the pilot to recover from the roll in the few seconds remaining before the DC @-@ 7 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean . The CAB also determined that Captain Carson had neither the time nor adequate information to assess Flight 663 's position relative to Pan Am 212 and , given the illusion of a collision course , he had acted appropriately in initiating evasive maneuvers . The CAB made no recommendations in the final accident report . Although early news reports reported the near miss of Flights 663 and 212 , the FAA denied that there was ever any danger of a collision . 
 At that time , the crash of Flight 663 was the fifth worst aviation accident to have occurred in the United States . It was and remains the third deadliest crash of a DC @-@ 7 ( after Caledonian Airways Flight 153 and Northwest Airlines Flight 293 ) , and is the 25th deadliest single @-@ plane accident to have occurred in the United States . 
 = 2008 Tanana Valley flood = 
 The 2008 Tanana Valley flood or the 2008 Fairbanks flood was a flood in late July and early August 2008 that affected several rivers in the central portion of the American state of Alaska . The city of Fairbanks , Alaska saw high water levels , while the towns of Nenana , Salcha , and Old Minto received heavy damage . The Salcha River and Tanana River reached their second @-@ highest levels since record @-@ keeping began ( the highest was during the 1967 Tanana Valley Flood ) , while the Chena River , which bisects Fairbanks , was kept below flood stage by the use of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project . 
 Several hundred homes were inundated by the flood in Fairbanks , Salcha , unincorporated Fairbanks North Star Borough , Nenana , and smaller villages , but due to early warnings from the National Weather Service , volunteer fire departments , and the borough 's emergency contact system , no one was injured . The area affected by the flood was declared a state disaster area , making residents whose homes were flooded eligible for state aid . The long @-@ term effects of the flood , including its effect on the salmon spawning season , are as yet unknown . 
 = = Background = = 
 The summer of 2008 was an unusually wet one for central Alaska . In June , the National Weather Service recorded 2 @.@ 1 inches ( 53 mm ) of precipitation at the Fairbanks International Airport — the most in that month since June 1994 , and 0 @.@ 68 inches ( 17 mm ) above average . By July 27 , 1 @.@ 47 inches of rain had fallen in July . This was slightly below the average for the month at that time ( 1 @.@ 49 inches ) , but the year @-@ to @-@ date rainfall total was still one and two @-@ thirds inches above normal . The next day , July 28 , 1 @.@ 14 inches of rain fell in Fairbanks , setting a single @-@ day Fairbanks rainfall total for that date , with heavier amounts measured east of the town . Scattered locations between Salcha and Delta Junction received up to four inches of precipitation . On the 29th , another 0 @.@ 77 inches of rain fell in Fairbanks — another record for the date — and again , locations outside of the town received greater amounts . Just 0 @.@ 14 inches of rain fell on the 30th , but on the 31st , 0 @.@ 6 inches fell . This amount was not a record for the date , but it brought the overall rainfall total in Fairbanks for the month of July to 4 @.@ 12 inches — more than double the normal average of 1 @.@ 73 inches ( 44 mm ) of rain . At Eielson Air Force Base , which lies to the southwest of Fairbanks , 7 @.@ 30 inches of rain were recorded as having fallen in July , making it the rainiest July ever recorded and the second @-@ rainiest month ever recorded at the base . Though more rain fell on August 1 and afterward , the Tanana , Salcha , and Chena rivers had already crested . 
 = = Flood = = 
 = = = Salcha = = = 
 By the evening of July 28 , the record @-@ breaking rainfall that had fallen to that point caused the National Weather Service to issue a flood warning for the tributaries of the Tanana River east of Fairbanks . On the 29th , the continued rain forced the expansion of the flood warning to cover the entire Tanana and Salcha River basins between Salcha and Nenana , a stretch of land 320 miles ( 510 km ) long . The rising Salcha River forced home evacuations on the 29th and caused the Old Richardson Highway to be closed in several locations as the Salcha overflowed its banks and covered the road near the town of Salcha . An emergency shelter was set up to handle refugees from the Salcha River 's flooding , and forecasters predicted the river would continue to rise . 
 On the 30th , the Salcha River crested at 16 @.@ 8 feet — almost three feet above flood stage — where it crosses the Richardson Highway . This was the sixth @-@ highest crest since measurements began in the first half of the 20th century . The last time the river reached that height was October 15 , 2000 , when the river crested at 16 @.@ 91 feet ( 5 @.@ 15 m ) . More than 100 homes were at least partially underwater , and nearly two dozen Salcha town residents took advantage of the emergency shelter that had been set up at Salcha Elementary School the day before . 
 High water remained in Salcha through the 31st , though the crest of the flooding had passed . Water continued to cover roads in and around Salcha , and water @-@ borne debris accumulated under several local bridges , causing impromptu dams . By August 1 , the Salcha River had begun to recede to a noticeable extent . Though some roads remained underwater and falling trees knocked out power to areas of the town , residents began to pump out basements and begin recovery efforts . By early afternoon on the first , the Old Richardson Highway had been cleared of water and the National Weather Service canceled its flood warning for the Salcha area . 
 = = = Fairbanks = = = 
 The first effects of the flood began to be felt in Fairbanks late on the 29th , as the Tanana River overflowed its banks and covered low @-@ lying areas of South Fairbanks . Thought was given on that date to closing the floodgates of the Moose Creek Dam , located on the Chena River as part of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project , but the Chena 's rise was not as rapid as that of the Tanana , which lies to the south of the town , and no action was taken on the 29th . Engineers also considered lowering the gates on the 30th , but the flow of the Chena River had not reached a level where computer models mandated the closing of the gates to protect Fairbanks . 
 The Tanana River , which is not controlled by the flood project , meanwhile reached a crest of 26 @.@ 60 feet at Fairbanks on the 30th . This amount was more than two feet above flood stage and was the highest level seen since August 1967 , when the river crested at 27 @.@ 80 feet ( 8 @.@ 47 m ) during the great 1967 Fairbanks flood . The height of the water caused flooding in the Rosie Creek and Chena Pump neighborhoods west of Fairbanks , and caused some residents to evacuate . Residents who remained were placed under a boil @-@ water order for fear that floodwater had contaminated the public drinking water system . In response to the continuing spread of the flood , Fairbanks and Fairbanks North Star Borough authorities opened an emergency operations center to handle the response to the flood and answer residents ' questions . Residents of the Rosie Creek neighborhood were awakened in the early morning hours of the 31st by borough warnings and volunteer firefighters , who instructed them to evacuate . High water had surrounded the residents ' homes , causing many to flee to a shelter set up at a nearby elementary school . No residents were injured in the evacuation , something many of them credited to prompt and efficient warnings . The continued high water of the Tanana River caused overflow to flood into the nearby Chena , normally a tributary of the Tanana . Despite that unusual flow , engineers at the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project decided not to close the project 's floodgates , forecasting that the Chena would not rise above flood stage , even with the increased flow . 
 By the morning of August 1 , the Tanana River had begun to fall in Fairbanks , just as the Salcha River had begun to recede in Salcha . Though isolated roads continued to wash out from heavy water flow and residents were not allowed to return to their homes , the water level of the river continued to fall . Due to this fact , the opening of Fairbanks ' Tanana Valley Fair — scheduled for August 1 — was not delayed . Despite the falling water level in the Tanana , the Chena River continued to rise due to the differing water levels in the two rivers . This fact caused the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to close the floodgates of the Chena River Lakes Flood Control Project at 3 : 30 a.m. on August 1 . They remained closed throughout the day before being reopened at 5 : 30 a.m. on August 2 . 
 = = = Nenana = = = 
 Though Nenana also received heavy rain from the storm system that began the flood , its position further downstream on the Tanana River meant that it did not receive the first effects of the flood until the 30th , when Alaska Railroad officials suspended operations south of Nenana due to track damage caused by rising water . 
 On July 31 , the Tanana River began to overflow its banks in Nenana . Water flooded the rails of the Alaska Railroad in town , caused an evacuation of the town 's clinic , and flooded low @-@ lying areas throughout the town . By August 1 , the entire town was at least partially flooded , with most basements and other low @-@ lying areas being completely filled by floodwater . The flooding of the Alaska Railroad track in town forced a halt to all passenger and freight operations between Anchorage and Fairbanks , effectively cutting off Fairbanks from rail traffic . 
 On August 2 , the Tanana River at Nenana crested at 14 @.@ 64 feet . This total was more than four feet above flood stage and was the third @-@ highest water level ever recorded , falling short of a 15 @.@ 9 @-@ foot mark in 1948 and the record 18 @.@ 9 @-@ foot mark recorded during the flood of 1967 . The town shipyard was submerged under three feet of water , and the town 's clinic was moved from its interim location in the fire station to the town airport after floodwater threatened the station . Town leaders encouraged residents to evacuate to higher ground until the flood receded . Nenana High School was saved from flooding by just eight inches of elevation . Water lapped around the school 's base , but did not enter the school itself due to that small margin . High water lingered in the town until August 3 , when a National Weather Service forecaster felt confident enough to say , " The worst is over . " 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On the morning of August 1 , the mayor of the Fairbanks North Star Borough , Jim Whitaker , issued a disaster declaration for the drainage area of the Tanana River . In the declaration , he appealed for help from state and federal governments in the recovery process , saying , " substantial damage is occurring due to high water and river current on the Tanana River , the Salcha River and the Chena River , resulting in damage to over 500 private residences with an estimated 1 @,@ 000 inhabitants and to the road networks " maintained by the borough and the state . The next day , the Alaska commissioner of military and veterans affairs and the state director of homeland security and emergency management toured the flooded areas by helicopter . On August 4 , Alaska governor Sarah Palin visited Fairbanks to officially sign the disaster declaration and tour the flooded area . By the middle of August , the total damage from the flooding was estimated to be more than $ 10 million . In late September , President Bush approved a federal disaster declaration for the affected area , allowing federal aid to be spent on reconstruction efforts for damaged homes and buildings . 
 Some Alaska subsistence fishermen feared the floods could exacerbate an already poor salmon fishing season by disrupting the spawning season for king salmon . 
 = 2014 GoDaddy Bowl = 
 The 2014 GoDaddy Bowl was an American college football bowl game that was played on January 5 , 2014 at the Ladd Peebles Stadium in Mobile , Alabama . The fifteenth edition of the GoDaddy Bowl ( originally known as the Mobile Alabama Bowl ) , it featured the Ball State Cardinals from the Mid @-@ American Conference and the Arkansas State Red Wolves , co @-@ champions of the Sun Belt Conference . It was one of the 2013 – 14 bowl games that concluded the 2013 FBS football season . The game began at 8 : 00 p.m. CST and aired on ESPN . It was sponsored by web hosting service company Go Daddy . Arkansas State defeated Ball State by a score of 23 – 20 . 
 The Cardinals , who earned a 10 – 2 record during the season , made their second appearance in the bowl , while the Red Wolves , who earned a 7 – 5 record during the season , made their third consecutive appearance in the bowl . The pregame buildup focused on the teams ' respective strong offenses . For Ball State , the passing game centered on quarterback Keith Wenning connecting with wide receiver Willie Snead . In tandem with the rushing attack fueled by a strong offensive line , one writer asserted that they would enjoy " easy pickings " against a mediocre Arkansas State defense . Unlike the Ball State offense , Arkansas State 's offense focused predominantly on the rushing attack , to which both dual @-@ threat quarterback Adam Kennedy and running back Michael Gordon contributed . Ball State 's defense was average in terms of points allowed , but poor in terms of yards allowed . Ball State was a 9 @.@ 5 point favorite to win the game , and was the predicted winner among most sportswriters . 
 Ball State jumped out to an early lead via a Wenning to Snead touchdown , and led at the end of the first quarter 7 – 0 . After the first quarter , due to Kennedy 's ineffectiveness , Fredi Knighten took over at quarterback for Arkansas State , and in the second quarter , helped the team score 10 points while Ball State scored only 3 – at half time , the teams were tied at 10 . Arkansas State made two field goals in the third quarter , thus entering the fourth with a six @-@ point lead . However , Ball State scored via a field goal early in the quarter , and a touchdown with less than two minutes to play to retake the lead . Arkansas State promptly responded via a touchdown pass . Although Ball State was able to move the ball into field goal range as time waned , their field goal try was blocked , and ultimately Arkansas State held onto win the game , 23 – 20 .

After that , they won seven consecutive games before losing in their only game against a ranked opponent , Northern Illinois on November 13 . They won their final game , at which point bowl director Jerry Silverstein extended an invitation to play in the game .

This was the Red Wolves ' third consecutive GoDaddy Bowl , making them the team with the most appearances in the game 's history . The Red Wolves had previously lost the 2012 game to the Northern Illinois Huskies by a score of 38 @-@ 20 , and then won the 2013 game over the 25th ranked Kent State Golden Flashes by a score of 17 @-@ 13 . The Red Wolves began their season defeating Arkansas – Pine Bluff in a rout before being demoralized by Auburn . After winning a close game the following week against Troy in their conference opener , they lost two consecutive non @-@ conference games . They split their next two games , but subsequently won four consecutive games before falling to Western Kentucky and being invited to the bowl . 
 Shortly after the end of the regular season , Red Wolves head coach Bryan <unk> left to take the head coaching position at Boise State , a program where he had served as an assistant from 2001 to 2010 . Red Wolves defensive coordinator John Thompson was named as interim head coach for the bowl game . This is his second consecutive GoDaddy Bowl as interim head coach , as he served in that capacity for the 2013 game after Gus <unk> left to become head coach at Auburn .

 The passing attack was predicted to have " easy pickings " , particularly with the Keith Wenning to Willie Snead connection that had eclipsed 100 yards in all but three games , against Arkansas State 's secondary , which struggled against the pass .

 Coordinated by Rick <unk> , who was in his third year , Ball State 's offense ranked ninth in the country by averaging 333 passing yards per game , 78th in the country with 153 @.@ 3 rushing yards per game , and 14th in the country with 40 @.@ 1 points per game . " Stellar senior quarterback " Keith Wenning led the Cardinals ' offense , and passed for a total of 3 @,@ 933 yards for 34 touchdowns and just 6 interceptions , predominantly to two 1 @,@ 000 yard receivers – junior Willie Snead , who caught 97 passes for 1 @,@ 429 yards and 14 touchdowns , and sophomore Jordan Williams , who caught 68 passes for 1 @,@ 016 yards and 10 touchdowns .

 The Red Wolves ' defense was led by defensive coordinator / linebackers coach John Thompson , who was in his second year with the program . They finished in the middle of the pack in both the NCAA and the conference in defensive statistical categories relating to yardage and points allowed . Anchored by nose tackle Ryan <unk> , an NFL Draft prospect whose tackle totals moved him even higher up the radar ( he was second on the team with 87 as well as four sacks and eight tackles for a loss ( TFL ) ) , the Arkansas State defensive line also featured redshirt sophomore defensive end Chris Stone , who led the defense with 9 @.@ 5 TFL and added three sacks , and fifth @-@ year senior Amos Draper . The linebacking corps was not a focal point of the defense – only two of the defense 's top 15 tacklers were linebackers – the leader was undersized junior <unk> Lee ( 5 feet 11 inches ( 1 @.@ 80 m ) 225 pounds ( 102 kg ) ) , who led the defense with 119 tackles and added 6 TFL , and also contributing was freshman Xavier <unk> , who recorded 22 total tackles . Making up for the lack of linebackers were a plethora of defensive backs who played key roles on the unit , including three of the top six tacklers – junior Sterling Young ( 70 tackles , 2 interceptions , 3 fumble recoveries ) , and sophomores Chris Humes ( 50 tackles , 3 @.@ 5 TFL ) , and Rocky Hayes ( 42 tackles , team @-@ leading 3 interceptions , 10 pass breakups , 2 TFL ) .

 A key to this matchup was for Ball State to force Arkansas State quarterback Adam Kennedy to be one @-@ dimensional , limiting his ability to run the football , and thus forcing him to pass , attacking the Cardinals ' defensive strong point , their secondary . For Arkansas State , establishing a rushing attack early and utilizing it often was paramount , as Ball State did not defend against the run particularly well during the regular season , however at the same time , Arkansas State needed to limit turnovers as they had all season ( 13 lost all season – seventh nationally ) ; creating them was a strength for Ball State ( 30 created all season ( including 10 in previous 4 games ) – seventh nationally ) . 
 = = = = Arkansas State offense = = = = 
 Led by co @-@ coordinators <unk> <unk> ( who predominantly focused on running backs ) and Bush Hamdan ( who predominantly focused on quarterbacks ) , Arkansas State 's offense excelled in the running game , and averaged 206 rushing yards per game , which was second in the Sun Belt , but struggled in the passing game , averaging just 208 yards per game , which was sixth in the conference ; the aggregate mediocrity of their offense manifested itself by averaging 29 @.@ 7 points per game , fourth in the conference . Their offense was led by dual @-@ threat quarterback Adam Kennedy , a transfer from Utah State who was in his first year as a Red Wolf . The senior totaled 2 @,@ 349 passing yards , and added 514 rushing yards , second among Sun Belt quarterbacks and tied for ninth overall in the conference ; he scored 15 total touchdowns ( 11 passing , 4 rushing ) . Leading Arkansas State 's rushing attack , however , was sophomore Michael Gordon , a small back with a 5 feet 9 inches ( 1 @.@ 75 m ) 190 pounds ( 86 kg ) stature , who amassed 717 yards ( fifth in the conference ) and ten touchdowns ( tied for fourth in the conference ) . Also leading the running game were seniors David Oku ( a transfer from Tennessee ) and <unk> Thornton , who contributed 511 and 340 yards respectively . Augmenting the aforementioned were sophomores backup quarterback Fredi Knighten , who rushed for 247 yards , and wide receiver J.D. <unk> , who rushed 118 yards . 
 Leading the receiving game were senior big @-@ play threat Julian Jones , who caught 51 passes for 630 yards and 4 touchdowns , and possession safety valve <unk> , who caught 73 receptions for 590 yards and 4 touchdowns . Augmenting the aforementioned duo were 6 feet 4 inches ( 1 @.@ 93 m ) senior Allen Muse , third on the team in receiving yards , and sophomore tight end <unk> Griswold , fourth on the team in receiving . Gordon , Oku , and senior receiver R.J. Fleming also contributed in the receiving game . Senior Brian Davis handled the kicking game , and went 44 / 45 on extra points , and 12 / 14 kicking field goals ( with a long of 50 yards ) for a total of 80 points . The Wolves ' offensive line struggled to protect the quarterback despite returning the majority of the unit from the 2012 season , but did manage to open holes for the running game . Starters on the offensive line included sophomore center Bryce Giddens , a preseason all @-@ conference honoree , senior tackle Aaron Williams and freshman tackle Colton Jackson , as well as upperclassmen guards Alan Wright and Steve <unk> .

 Defensive coordinator Jay Bateman led the Cardinals ' defense , which was in the middle of the pack in the FBS in terms of points allowed ( 24 @.@ 8 per game ) , in the bottom half in terms of yards allowed ( 420 @.@ 8 per game ) , particularly struggling against the running game , allowing 194 @.@ 8 rushing yards per game , which was in the bottom third nationally . Ball State 's defensive line was led by fifth @-@ year senior defensive end Jonathan Newsome , who achieved first team All @-@ MAC honors , and totaled 57 tackles , 11 @.@ 5 TFL , and 8 sacks . Senior Nathan Ollie was also a leader of the line , earning second team All @-@ MAC accolades , and totaling 67 tackles , 9 TFL , and 3 sacks on the season . Like Ollie ( Newsome did not start the second game of the season ) , senior Joel Cox and junior Nick Miles started every game of the season , at nose tackle and defensive end respectively . Junior Ben Ingle started 11 of the 12 games at weak side linebacker , and led the defense with 105 tackles , including 3 @.@ 5 TFL , redshirt freshman Zack Ryan , who started every game at middle linebacker , was third on the defense with 80 tackles , with 8 TFL and 2 @.@ 5 sacks , and senior Kenneth Lee played strong side linebacker , and recorded 42 tackles , 4 @.@ 5 TFL , and 2 @.@ 5 sacks . Aside from junior Brian Jones , who started all 12 games and finished the season second on the defense with 90 tackles and led the defense with 4 fumble recoveries , continuity was lacking in the Cardinals ' secondary – three different players started at the " BC " cornerback spot , two different players started at the " FC " cornerback spot , and two different players started at the free safety spot . Injuries also took their toll , with two defensive backs out for the bowl game .

 After receiving the opening kickoff , Ball State 's first drive stalled , and it ultimately went three @-@ and @-@ out . Their punter , Kyle Schmidt , managed only 24 yards on the punt , and gave Arkansas State the ball at Ball State 's 36 @-@ yard line . Arkansas State failed to capitalize on the good field position , however , missing a 34 @-@ yard field goal attempt . Subsequently , the teams exchanged punts . After being pinned at their own 11 @-@ yard line , the Cardinals embarked on a 14 @-@ play , 89 @-@ yard drive that featured six rushes by <unk> Edwards for a total of 44 yards , including one 22 @-@ yard rush . Also on the drive , Keith Wenning completed four of five passes , three of which were to Willie Snead , including a 9 @-@ yard touchdown pass that was the first score of the game . At the end of the quarter , the Red Wolves had just concluded a drive , that had crossed into Ball State 's territory before a punt that was downed inside the 5 @-@ yard line . On that drive , Fredi Knighten replaced Adam Kennedy at quarterback . 
 = = = Second quarter = = = 
 The victim of poor field position , Ball State executed only three plays , the last of which was a sack that pinned them at their own 1 @-@ yard line . Nevertheless , Schmidt was able to punt the ball 52 yards , but a 10 @-@ yard return still gave Arkansas State the ball in Ball State 's territory . They got on the score board on that drive via a 41 @-@ yard field goal kick by Brian Davis , making the score 7 – 3 Ball State . On their ensuing drive , Ball State executed another extended drive , this one lasting 13 plays and totaling 67 yards ( highlighted by another 20 + yard rush by Edwards ) ; it failed to reach the end zone , but all was not lost , as Scott Secor made a 26 @-@ yard field goal to put the Cardinals up by seven points . The drive encompassed 6 : 09 . Arkansas State responded , embarking on a 9 @-@ play , 63 @-@ yard drive that was highlighted by a 27 @-@ yard rush by R.J. Fleming , and climaxed when <unk> Thornton rushed for a 1 @-@ yard touchdown , tying the game in the waning seconds of the first half . The half time score was 10 – 10 . 
 = = = Third quarter = = = 
 Arkansas State got the ball to start the second half , and promptly drove down the field relying predominantly on Knighten , who threw six passes and attempted three rushes ; ultimately , their drive stalled at the 2 @-@ yard line , and Davis kicked an 18 @-@ yard field goal to put the Red Wolves atop 13 – 10 . Ball State subsequently faced a fourth down and one ( 4th and 1 ) situation , on which they attempted a fake punt – Schmidt was tackled by Brock Barnhill on the play and lost three yards on the rush , and the Cardinals had to relinquish the ball in their own territory . Arkansas State took advantage of the field position , converting another field goal attempt , this one from 29 yards , to give them a 6 @-@ point lead . Once again , Ball State turned the ball over on downs on their ensuing possession , this time doing so at the Arkansas State 32 @-@ yard line . This time , Arkansas State failed to take advantage , punting after achieving only one first down . At the end of the quarter , Ball State was in the midst of a possession around their 25 @-@ yard line . 
 = = = Fourth quarter = = = 
 Ball State took advantage of a pass interference penalty on Arkansas State on their drive – Secor kicked a 37 @-@ yard field goal to pull the Cardinals within three points . The Red Wolves then went three @-@ and @-@ out . After that , each team 's quarterback ( Wenning and Knighten respectively ) threw interceptions ; after the interceptions , Ball State had the ball at their own 4 @-@ yard line ( Wenning 's interception was returned to the 8 @-@ yard line ) . They scored after executing a demoralizing 16 @-@ play , 80 @-@ yard drive that encapsulated 6 : 51 – it culminated when Edwards rushed for a 1 @-@ yard touchdown . Arkansas State efficiently responded , scoring on a 13 @-@ yard pass from Knighten to Allen Muse , a 6 feet 4 inches ( 1 @.@ 93 m ) , 225 pounds ( 102 kg ) senior wide receiver . The touchdown gave Arkansas State a 23 – 20 lead that they would not relinquish – Secor attempted a 38 @-@ yard field goal as time expired to try to tie the game , however the kick was blocked , and the Red Wolves held on to win .

 = HMS Anson ( 79 ) = 
 HMS Anson was a King George V @-@ class battleship of the Royal Navy , named after Admiral George Anson . She was built by Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Shipyard and launched on 24 February 1940 , being completed on 22 June 1942 . Her completion was delayed to allow the fitting of fire @-@ control radar and additional anti @-@ aircraft weapons . She was originally to have been named Jellicoe , but was renamed Anson in February 1940 . 
 Anson saw service in the Second World War , escorting nine Russian convoys in the Arctic by December 1943 . She took part in diversionary moves to draw attention away from Operation Husky in July 1943 . In February 1944 she provided cover for Operation Tungsten , the successful air strike against the German battleship Tirpitz . She accepted the surrender of Japanese forces occupying Hong Kong on 15 August 1945 and after the end of the war she became the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron of the British Pacific Fleet . 
 Anson arrived back in British waters on 29 July 1946 , spending the next three years in active service with the post @-@ war navy . She was finally placed in reserve and " mothballed " in 1949 , spending eight years in this condition . On 17 December 1957 she was purchased for scrap by Shipbreaking Industries , Faslane . 
 = = Construction = = 
 In the aftermath of the First World War , the Washington Naval Treaty was drawn up in 1922 in an effort to stop an arms race developing between Britain , Japan , France , Italy and the United States . This treaty limited the number of ships each nation was allowed to build and capped the displacement of all capital ships at 35 @,@ 000 long tons . These restrictions were extended in 1930 through the London Naval Treaty , however , in 1935 Japan and Italy would not agree to the Second London Naval Treaty for further armament control . Concerned by a lack of modern battleships within their navy , the Admiralty ordered the construction of a new battleship class : the King George V class . The calibre limitation clause introduced in the Second Treaty meant that the main armament of the King George V was limited to 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) and the unusual arrangement of the guns in the three turrets was an attempt to maximise firepower . Due to the pressing need for the ships , the British unlike the US could not delay to take advantage of an escalator clause that would allow 16 @-@ inch guns . The ships were the only ones to be built at the time to adhere to the treaty and even though it soon became apparent to the British that the other signatories to the treaty were ignoring its requirements , it was too late to change the design of the class before they were laid down in 1937 . 
 The keel of the fourth ship of the class was laid at the Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Shipyard on 20 July 1937 . She was originally to have been named Jellicoe , after Admiral Sir John Jellicoe , the commander of the Grand Fleet at the Battle of Jutland in 1916 , but she was renamed Anson in February 1940 . Anson was launched on 24 February 1940 and was completed on 22 June 1942 . Completion was delayed largely because of the inclusion of fire @-@ control radar , and additional anti @-@ aircraft weapons . 
 = = Description = = 
 Anson displaced 42 @,@ 600 long tons ( 43 @,@ 300 t ) on trials in 1942 and 45 @,@ 360 long tons ( 46 @,@ 090 t ) fully loaded in 1945 . The ship had an overall length of 745 feet ( 227 @.@ 1 m ) , a beam of 103 feet ( 31 @.@ 4 m ) and a draught of 31 feet 3 inches ( 9 @.@ 5 m ) . Her designed metacentric height was 6 feet 1 inch ( 1 @.@ 85 m ) at normal load and 8 feet 1 inch ( 2 @.@ 46 m ) at deep load . 
 She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines driving four propeller shafts . Steam was provided by eight Admiralty 3 @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers which normally delivered 100 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 75 @,@ 000 kW ) , but could deliver 110 @,@ 000 shp ( 82 @,@ 000 kW ) at emergency overload . This gave Anson a top speed of 27 @.@ 62 knots ( 51 @.@ 15 km / h ; 31 @.@ 78 mph ) . The ship carried 4 @,@ 210 long tons ( 4 @,@ 300 t ) of fuel oil . At full speed Anson had a range of 3 @,@ 150 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 830 km ; 3 @,@ 620 mi ) at 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) while burning 36 long tons ( 37 t ) of fuel per hour . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Anson 's main armament was ten BL 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) Mk VII guns . The 14 @-@ inch guns were mounted in three turrets ; one Mark III quadruple turret forward and one aft , and one Mark II twin turret forward firing over the quadruple turret . The guns could be elevated 40 degrees and depressed 3 degrees . A full gun broadside weighed 15 @,@ 950 pounds ( 7 @.@ 23 t ) , and a salvo could be fired every 40 seconds . Her secondary armament consisted of 16 QF 5 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( 133 mm ) Mk I guns which were mounted in eight twin mounts . The maximum range of the Mk I guns was 24 @,@ 070 yards ( 22 @,@ 009 @.@ 6 m ) at a 45 @-@ degree elevation , the anti @-@ aircraft ceiling was 49 @,@ 000 feet ( 14 @,@ 935 @.@ 2 m ) . The guns could be elevated to 70 degrees and depressed to 5 degrees . The normal rate of fire was ten to twelve rounds per minute , but in practice the guns could only fire seven to eight rounds per minute . Along with her main and secondary batteries Anson carried six 8 @-@ barrelled QF 2 @-@ pounder Mk . VIII ( 40 mm ) " pom @-@ pom " anti @-@ aircraft guns . These were supplemented by eighteen 20 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) Oerlikon light AA guns . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 After her commissioning in 1942 , Anson was sent to the Arctic Sea with most of the Home Fleet as an escort ship for multiple Russian convoys . On 12 September 1942 Anson was part of the distant covering force for Convoy QP 14 , along with her sister ship HMS Duke of York , the light cruiser HMS Jamaica and the destroyers HMS Keppel , Mackay , Montrose and Bramham . On 29 December Anson provided distant cover for Convoy JW 51B along with the cruiser HMS Cumberland and the destroyers HMS Forester , Icarus and Impulsive . On 23 and 24 January 1943 Anson provided distant cover for Convoy JW 52 along with the cruiser HMS Sheffield and the destroyers HMS Echo , Eclipse , Faulknor , Inglefield , Montrose , Queenborough , Raider and the Polish destroyer Orkan . On 29 January , Convoy RA 52 departed from the Kola inlet , with distant cover provided by Anson , the cruiser Sheffield and the destroyers Inglefield , Oribi , Obedient and the Polish destroyer Orkan from 30 January . 
 In June 1942 , the pre @-@ First World War battleship HMS Centurion was disguised as Anson in the Mediterranean Sea , acting as a decoy during Operation Vigorous . 
 In July 1943 Anson took part in the diversionary moves designed to draw attention away from the preparations for Operation Husky , and in October that year , with Duke of York and the US cruiser Tuscaloosa , provided cover for Operation Leader , in which the US aircraft carrier Ranger mounted air strikes against German shipping off Norway . In February 1944 , in company with the French battleship Richelieu and a force of cruisers and destroyers , Anson stood by in the same capacity while aircraft from the aircraft carrier HMS Furious carried out air strikes against German targets in Norway during Operation <unk> , and on 3 April she provided cover for Operation Tungsten , a successful air strike against the German battleship Tirpitz , during which she served as flagship for Vice Admiral Sir Henry Moore . 
 Anson was decommissioned for a refit in June 1944 and did not return to the fleet until March 1945 , when she sailed with Duke of York to join the British Pacific Fleet . By the time she arrived in the theatre , hostilities were all but over . She left Sydney on 15 August for Hong Kong with Duke of York , and along with a task force of other ships from Britain and the Commonwealth , accepted the surrender of the Japanese forces occupying Hong Kong . She was also present in Tokyo Bay during the official Japanese surrender aboard the USS Missouri . 
 = = = Post war era = = = 
 Following the war Anson was the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron of the British Pacific Fleet and helped to liberate Hong Kong . After a brief refit , Anson sailed from Sydney to Hobart in February 1946 to collect the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and return them to Sydney . 
 Anson arrived back in British waters on 29 July 1946 and after a short refit was returned to peacetime duties . In November 1949 , Anson was placed in reserve and in 1951 she was towed to Gare Loch . On 17 December 1957 she was purchased for scrap by Shipbreaking Industries , Faslane .

 Lead Balloon is a British television series produced by Open Mike Productions for BBC Four . The series was created and is co @-@ written by comedian Jack Dee and Pete Sinclair . It stars Dee as Rick Spleen ( Formally Rick Shaw ) , a cynical and misanthropic comedian whose life is plagued by petty annoyances , disappointments and embarrassments . Raquel Cassidy , Sean Power and Tony Gardner also star . The first series of six episodes was broadcast on BBC Four in 2006 , with the first episode achieving the highest ratings for a comedy on the channel . Repeats of the series were run on BBC Two and BBC HD , bringing it to a larger audience . The second series of eight episodes aired on BBC Two from November 2007 ; the third series aired from November 2008 ; and the final series aired from 31 May 2011 until 5 July . 
 Comparisons were made by critics to the successful American comedy Curb Your Enthusiasm , and positive comments were made about Lead Balloon 's characters , particularly Magda , the Eastern European housekeeper . The first series was released on DVD in November 2007 . The show 's theme tune is a cover version of " One Way Road " , written by Noel Gallagher and performed by Paul Weller .

 The genesis of the series came towards the end of recording the 2005 series of Jack Dee Live at the Apollo , when Dee speculated as to whether his experiences of " witless " interviews could be turned into a television programme . Following a meeting with his agent , in which he turned down the lead role in a series , Dee began writing the character that would become Rick Spleen . He focused the writing on Spleen 's domestic life , rather than his professional , but did highlight the clash between the two . A pilot , commissioned by BBC Four and recorded in December 2005 , received positive feedback and led to a full series of six 30 @-@ minute episodes being ordered in January 2006 for broadcast later in the year . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Dee 's frequent collaborator Pete Sinclair joined him to write the pilot script . The two worked for two weeks developing the characters and forming storylines from them , which prepared them for writing the series proper when it was commissioned . The two were strongly influenced in their writing by the " paradigm shift " of The Office that made " natural conversation " funny without a studio audience being present . Dee cites the early films of Woody Allen , Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm as other " cultural influences " that helped set the tone of the series . Controller of BBC Four Janice Hadlow stated the series was in the " same ballpark " as Curb , though it is not quite as autobiographical . The name Lead Balloon comes from the expression " To go down like a lead balloon " , meaning to be received badly by an audience . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The never @-@ broadcast pilot features a scene with Omid Djalili as a dry cleaner , which was reused in the fifth episode , " <unk> " . Location filming for the first two series , particularly Rick and Mel 's house , was done in Willesden . Michael 's cafe used <unk> Cafe in Kensal Green for the first two series , and Hugo 's restaurant in Lonsdale Road , Queen 's Park , London for the third . Most moped shots in the third series were filmed in Ladbroke Grove . Scenes are separated by the insertion of a person writing ideas for comedy material on a writing pad . 
 = = Characters = = 
 Dee 's character Rick Spleen ( born Richard Shaw ) is a stand @-@ up comedian living in London who struggles to get decent gigs and makes ends meet by hosting corporate events such as the Frozen Goods Awards Evening . Dee and Sinclair based the character on the " comedians who hated being comedians " who performed alongside Dee in his early years of stand @-@ up . Rick is a habitual and incompetent liar who often attempts practical tasks himself in an attempt to avoid paying professionals . 
 His partner Mel ( Raquel Cassidy ) is a talent agent whose clientele of everyday people getting their 15 minutes of fame serves to highlight Rick 's failing career . Her calm , perceptive and considerate personality contrasts strongly with Rick 's . 
 Rick 's American co @-@ writer , Marty ( Sean Power ) , writes the majority of Rick 's material , often working with him at Rick 's home or Michael 's café . Though he tries to moderate Rick 's desperate behaviour , he is quietly frustrated with him , and conspires against Rick 's interests . 
 Michael ( Tony Gardner ) owns and runs the café that Rick and Marty frequently visit to escape the chaos of Rick 's home . He is socially awkward , possibly to the extent of having a mental disorder , although he was actually a high @-@ flying city banker who suffered from burn @-@ out . His father turns out to be gay in later series , to which Michael reacts negatively . 
 Rick 's daughter Sam ( Antonia Campbell @-@ Hughes ) attends sixth form college and regularly extracts money from her father , often by expressing sympathy at his misfortunes . This money is always around forty pounds , and is possibly being used for the purchase of recreational drugs . 
 Sam 's slacker boyfriend Ben ( Rasmus Hardiker ) goes through numerous jobs and interests in the first series , such as taking a circus skills course , and a short @-@ lived shelf @-@ stacking job , however these apparent jobs require a recurring amount of forty pounds ( which is gained from Rick through Sam 's pleas ) , which may in fact be used to purchase recreational drugs , meaning the jobs and interests may not exist at all . 
 Magda ( Anna Crilly ) is the <unk> ' morose Eastern European housekeeper , who is often puzzled by British attitudes , language and , in her view , softness . She is a willing worker and generally suffers Rick 's selfish eccentricities in sullen silence . 
 Neighbour Clive ( John Biggins ) had a part in a single scene in the first series , but had a larger part in an episode of the second series ; by the third series he had become a prominent character , concerned about the well @-@ being of his elderly mother who is very delicate and has had problems with losing her cat and having teenagers throwing rubbish over her wall .

 Immediately following the commission of the series , reviewers compared it to Curb Your Enthusiasm ; a story in The Independent ran with the headline " Dee writes BBC 's answer to Curb Your Enthusiasm " . The Stage 's Mark Wright called it " a curious oddity " and called comparisons to Curb " inevitable " . Ian Johns of The Times " obsessed " over the similarities to Curb , though singled out Crilly and Gardner for their performances , and described Dee 's characterisation of Rick as " turning childish pettiness into something almost endearing " . 
 A. A. Gill , in The Sunday Times , wryly praised the style of humour and the reaction it provoked in viewers . Hermione Eyre of The Independent on Sunday called it " a delectable comedy of everyday embarrassment " , but " unfortunately , Lead Balloon shows awkward joints where Curb Your Enthusiasm has invisible seams " ; the reviewer cited Larry David as being a good man driven to obnoxious behaviour , whereas Spleen is just obnoxious . Thomas Sutcliffe of The Independent named the series the best new comedy of 2006 . 
 When appearing on a panel of comedy judges at the 2007 Edinburgh International Television Festival , Frank Skinner , in response to The Vicar of Dibley and The Catherine Tate Show being voted the best comedies in a public poll , called it " the best sitcom that anyone from the comedy circuit has done [ ... ] Obviously I was hoping it would be shit " ( Skinner starred in his own failed sitcom , Shane in 2004 ) . 
 The first episode broke BBC Four 's audience record for a comedy series , with 383 @,@ 000 viewers . Despite dropping to 199 @,@ 000 by the third episode , it still won a multi @-@ channel slot . " Rubbish " ' s BBC Two repeat received 2 @.@ 1 million viewers , with 122 @,@ 000 seeing " Allergic " afterwards on BBC Four . The final episode of the first series , " Fatty " , received 2 @.@ 3 million for its BBC Two repeat . 
 The first series was nominated for a British Comedy Award in 2007 , with Dee also nominated for best comedy actor .

 Yip Pin Xiu ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : Yè <unk> ) , born 10 January 1992 ) is a Singaporean backstroke swimmer . She has muscular dystrophy and competes in the S3 category for the physically impaired . Since 2005 , she has won medals in international competitions such as the World Wheelchair and Amputee Games , Japan Paralympic Swimming Championships and International German Paralympic Swimming Championships . At the 2008 Summer Paralympics , she won a gold medal in the 50 metres backstroke and a silver medal in the 50 metres freestyle , setting world records in both events . In honour of her feats at the Paralympic Garmes , she was conferred the Pingat Jasa Gemilang ( Meritorious Service Medal ) during the National Day Awards ceremony and named " Young Woman Achiever of the Year " by local magazine Her World . Her achievements contributed to public debate about the treatment and recognition of disabled athletes in Singapore . 
 = = Early years and personal life = = 
 Yip was born with muscular dystrophy , a genetic disorder that slowly breaks down the muscles , and a nerve condition that affects eyesight . When she was five , she started swimming to improve her health and strengthen her muscles ; nevertheless , by the age of eleven , she had lost her ability to walk and had to use a wheelchair . The youngest of three children in her family , she studied in Ai Tong Primary School and <unk> Secondary School , then graduated from Republic Polytechnic as back @-@ up valedictorian and , as of 2012 , is studying social science at Singapore Management University . 
 = = Swimming career = = 
 Yip started swimming competitively when she was twelve years old . After losing her ability to kick , Yip switched from the front crawl to the backstroke and was reclassified from the S5 to the S3 category ( lower numbers indicate more severe disabilities ) . Her coach is former Singaporean Olympic swimmer Ang Peng Siong , while fellow Paralympic swimmer Theresa Goh is her close friend and role model . Besides competitive swimming , Yip has participated in events to raise awareness of disabled sports , such as the <unk> Swimming Meets and Montfort Secondary School Track and Field Meet 2007 . 
 After successes in national championships , Yip participated in the Asia Paralympics Swimming Championship 2005 , winning two gold medals . Her first international competition was the World Wheelchair and Amputee Games 2005 , where she won two gold medals and a bronze . She then received four gold medals at the DSE Long Course Swimming Championships in 2006 . In 2007 , she won three gold medals at the Japan Paralympic Swimming Championships and four gold medals at the World Wheelchair and Amputee Games . 
 At the 4th ASEAN <unk> , Yip finished first in the women 's 150 metres individual medley , clocking 4 minutes 56 @.@ 34 seconds . She set a world record time of 1 minute 00 @.@ 80 seconds in the 50 metres backstroke at the US Paralympic swimming trials . The 22nd International German Paralympic Swimming Championships saw her set a world record of 2 minutes 10 @.@ 09 seconds in the 100 metres backstroke heats ; in the finals , she was awarded the gold medal with a time of 2 minutes 08 @.@ 09 seconds , bettering her own world record .

In the women 's 50 metres backstroke heats , she posted a time of 57 @.@ 92 seconds , taking two seconds off her own world record . She then swam the women 's 50 metres backstroke finals in a time of 58 @.@ 75 seconds to win the gold medal . After she returned to Singapore , the president conferred Yip a state medal , the Meritorious Service Medal . 
 The success of Yip and Laurentia Tan , who won two bronze medals in equestrian events , sparked public debate about the treatment and recognition of disabled athletes in Singapore . Letters to The Straits Times criticised the poor coverage of the Paralympics . Many Singaporeans also commented about the disparity of the cash awards handed out by the government : S $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 for an Olympic gold and S $ 100 @,@ 000 for a Paralympic gold . When the issues were raised in Parliament , <unk> parliamentary secretary Teo Ser Luck promised to study plans to give disabled athletes greater support and to include them in sporting programmes such as Project <unk> , a training programme for top Singaporean sportspeople . Two months later , the cash rewards for Paralympic medals were doubled and funding for the Singapore National Paralympic Council was increased . 
 At the 8th ASEAN Para Games , she is torch lighter with Tay Wei Ming and Gan Kai Hong Aloysius .

Difficulty varieties adjust the speed of the pigeons . 
 Two two @-@ player gameplay variations exist and are activated by modifying the Atari 2600 's difficulty switches . There is an alternating version where players take turns shooting the clay pigeons , and another variation features one player shooting while the other controls the angle of the clay pigeons . Other variables that can be changed are the position of the shooter and the direction the bird will enter the screen from .

 Ed Salvo developed Skeet Shoot independently . Salvo had self @-@ taught himself to program for the 2600 after purchasing an Atari 800 ; the dealer wanted a flight simulator for the 2600 so he contracted Salvo to make one . The game was never released as the dealer had lost interest . According to Salvo , the development of Skeet Shoot took him around a month at night in his home to finish . After his friend sent him an advertisement from a Dallas newspaper by newly founded studio Games by Apollo that asked for programmers , he contacted Apollo founder Pat Roper and showed him Skeet Shoot . Roper decided that Skeet Shoot was a good enough game for a first time . He offered Salvo a job at Apollo , which Salvo declined , believing it would be too risky . When Salvo returned to his Iowa home , Roper contacted him and told him he would buy Skeet Shoot for five thousand dollars which Salvo accepted . 
 Skeet Shoot still had glitches when it was released ; one caused the image to flip vertically . Salvo learned of the glitch and fixed it , and the only cartridges that bear the bug are European versions . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 Skeet Shoot was released by Apollo in December 1981 . Reviews were negative , as Apollo 's publicist Emmit Crawford acknowledged . Crawford believed that the reason people did not like Skeet Shoot was because it did not provide enough challenge for most video game players and that the company had distributed it in too much of a hurry . He later said that " All in all , Skeet Shoot wasn 't a spectacular game to start off with . " Despite the poor publicity , the game sold very well . 
 Author Brett Alan Weiss wrote that Skeet Shoot was " a shoddily programmed , graphically primitive game " and said that the poor controls and difficulty levels rendered the game " virtually worthless " . A writer for Atari HQ called it a mediocre game . Lee <unk> of <unk> Computing remarked that " Atari & Activision have nothing to fear from the graphics on this first release . " TV Gamer opined it was one of the worst games for the system , saying that it was boring and criticizing the fact that it was difficult to hit the skeet . 
 Mark <unk> of Classic Gamer Magazine was similarly negative , writing " Games by Apollo released a couple of decent games before going bankrupt , but you never would have guessed that anyone at the company knew how to program the Atari 2600 judging by their debut game . " <unk> opined that while the game was playable , it was not " a step in the right direction " for Apollo .

 After Skeet Shoot , Salvo signed a contract that led to the creation of <unk> . Eventually , Salvo became Apollo 's Director of Development and was given the job of hiring 25 programmers to work on Apollo 's games . Apollo went on to release seven other games after Skeet Shoot . One year later , the studio eventually filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 12 , 1982 , due to pressure from its advertising agency , Benton & Bowles . Apollo owed the company $ 2 @.@ 5 million ( half of its total debt ) . Although Roper expected Apollo to return in " smaller form " , the company closed in 1983 after reorganization attempts failed . 
 = American Saddlebred = 
 The American Saddlebred is a horse breed from the United States . This breed was referred to as the " Horse America Made " . Descended from riding @-@ type horses bred at the time of the American Revolution , the American Saddlebred includes the Narragansett Pacer , Canadian Pacer , Morgan and Thoroughbred among its ancestors . Developed into its modern type in Kentucky , it was once known as the " Kentucky Saddler " , and used extensively as an officer 's mount in the American Civil War . In 1891 , a breed registry was formed in the United States . Throughout the 20th century , the breed 's popularity continued to grow in the United States , and exports began to South Africa and Great Britain . Since the formation of the US registry , almost 250 @,@ 000 American Saddlebreds have been registered , and can now be found in countries around the world , with separate breed registries established in Great Britain , Australia , continental Europe , and southern Africa . 
 Averaging 15 to 16 hands ( 60 to 64 inches , 152 to 163 cm ) in height , Saddlebreds are known for their sense of presence and style , as well as for their spirited , yet gentle , temperament . They may be of any color , including pinto patterns , which have been acknowledged in the breed since the late 1800s . They are considered a gaited breed , as some Saddlebreds are bred and trained to perform four @-@ beat ambling gaits , one being a " slow gait " that historically was one of three possible ambling patterns , and the much faster rack . The breed does have a hereditary predisposition to <unk> , a curvature of the spine , as well as occupational predispositions to upper respiratory and lameness issues . 
 Since the mid @-@ 1800s , the breed has played a prominent part in the US horse show industry , and is called the " peacock of the horse world " . They have attracted the attention of numerous celebrities , who have become breeders and exhibitors , and purebred and partbred American Saddlebreds have appeared in several films , especially during the Golden Age of Hollywood . Saddlebreds are mainly known for their performance in the show ring , but can also be seen in competition in several other English riding disciplines and combined driving , as well as being used as a pleasure riding horse . American Saddlebreds often compete in five primary divisions : Five @-@ Gaited , Three @-@ Gaited , Fine Harness , Park and Pleasure . In these divisions they are judged on performance , manners , presence , quality and conformation 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 American Saddlebreds stand 15 to 17 hands ( 60 to 68 inches , 152 to 173 cm ) high , averaging 15 to 16 hands ( 60 to 64 inches , 152 to 163 cm ) , and weigh between 1 @,@ 000 and 1 @,@ 200 pounds ( 450 and 540 kg ) . Members of the breed have well @-@ shaped heads with a straight profile , long , slim , arched necks , well @-@ defined withers , sloping shoulders , correct leg conformation , and strong level backs with well @-@ sprung ribs . The croup is level with a high @-@ carried tail . Enthusiasts consider them to be spirited , yet gentle , animals . Any color is acceptable , but most common are chestnut , bay , brown and black . Some are gray , roan , palomino and pinto . The first @-@ known pinto Saddlebred was a stallion foaled in 1882 . In 1884 and 1891 , two additional <unk> , both mares , were foaled . These three horses were recorded as " spotted " , but many other pinto Saddlebreds with minimal markings were recorded only by their base color , without making note of their markings . This practice continued into the 1930s , at which time breeders came to be more accepting of " colored " horses and began recording markings and registering horses as pinto . The Saddlebred has been called the " world 's most beautiful horse " by admirers , and is known as the " peacock of the horse world " . The United States Equestrian Federation ( USEF ) describes the Saddlebred as follows : " He carries himself with an attitude that is elusive of description — some call it " class " , presence , quality , style , or charm . This superior air distinguishes his every movement . " 
 Saddlebreds are popularly known as show horses , with horses being shown saddle seat in both three @-@ gaited and five @-@ gaited classes . The former are the three common gaits seen in most breeds , the walk , trot and canter . The latter includes the three regular gaits , plus two four @-@ beat ambling gaits known as the slow gait and the rack . The slow gait today is a four @-@ beat gait in which the lateral pairs of legs leave the ground together , but strike the ground at different times , the hind foot connecting slightly before the forefoot . In the show ring , the gait should be performed with restraint and precision . The rack is also a four @-@ beat gait , but with equal intervals between each footfall , making it a smooth gait to ride . In the show ring , the gait is performed with speed and action , appearing unrestrained . Historically , the slow gait could be either a running walk , the stepping pace , or the fox trot , however , the modern five @-@ gaited Saddlebred usually performs the stepping pace . 
 <unk> , also known as <unk> , low back or soft back , has been found to have a hereditary basis in Saddlebreds and a recessive mode of inheritance . The precise mutation has not yet been located , but researchers believe it to be somewhere on horse chromosome 20 . Researching this condition may help more than just the Saddlebred breed as it may " serve as a model for investigating congenital skeletal deformities in horses and other species . " Due to the head position common in the show ring , Saddlebreds can have impairments to the upper respiratory system , while the shoeing and movement required of the horses can cause leg and hoof injuries and increased lameness . A <unk> is penalized as a fault at shows , in addition to other conformation flaws . 
 = = History = = 
 The Saddlebred has origins in the Galloway and Hobby horses of the British Isles , animals sometimes called palfreys , which had ambling gaits and were brought to the United States by early settlers . These animals were further refined in America to become a now @-@ extinct breed called the Narragansett Pacer , a riding and driving breed known for its ambling and pacing gaits . When colonists imported Thoroughbreds to America , beginning in 1706 , they were crossed with the Narragansett Pacer , which , combined with massive exports , ultimately led to the extinction of the Narragansett as a purebred breed . To preserve important bloodlines , Canadian Pacers were introduced instead . By the time of the American Revolution , a distinct type of riding horse had developed with the size and quality of the Thoroughbred , but the ambling gaits and stamina of the Pacer breeds . This animal was called the American Horse . Its existence was first documented in a 1776 letter when an American diplomat wrote to the Continental Congress asking for one to be sent to France as a gift for Marie Antoinette . 
 = = = 19th century = = = 
 Other breeds which played a role in the development of the Saddlebred in the 19th century include the Morgan , Standardbred and Hackney . The Canadian Pacer had a particularly significant impact . The breed , originally of French origin , was also influential in the development of the Standardbred and Tennessee Walking Horse . The most influential Canadian Pacer on Saddlebred lines was Tom Hall , a blue roan stallion foaled in 1806 . After being imported to the United States from Canada , he was registered as an American Saddlebred and became the foundation stallion of several Saddlebred lines . 
 The American Horse was further refined in Kentucky , where the addition of more Thoroughbred blood created a taller and better @-@ looking horse that became known as the Kentucky Saddler . There were originally seventeen foundation stallions listed by the breed registry , but by 1908 the registry decided to list only one and the remainder were identified as " Noted Deceased Sires . " Today , two foundation sires of the breed are recognized , both Thoroughbred crosses . The first was Denmark , son of an imported Thoroughbred , who for many years was the only recognized foundation stallion . His son , Gaines ' Denmark , was in the pedigrees of over 60 percent of the horses registered in the first three volumes of the breed 's studbook . A second foundation sire was recognized in 1991 , Harrison Chief . This sire was a descendent of the Thoroughbred Messenger , who is also considered a foundation stallion for the Standardbred breed . 
 During the American Civil War , American Saddlebreds were commonly used by the military , and known for their bravery and endurance . Many officers used them as mounts , and included in their numbers are General Lee 's Traveller , General Grant 's Cincinnati , General Sherman 's Lexington , and General Jackson 's Little Sorrell . Other generals who used them during the conflict include John Hunt Morgan and Basil W. Duke during his time with Morgan 's Raiders . Kentucky <unk> were used during brutal marches with the latter group , and the historical record suggests that they held up better than horses of other breeds . 
 The American Saddlebred Horse Association was formed in 1891 , then called the National Saddle Horse Breeders Association ( NSHBA ) . Private individuals had produced studbooks for other breeds , such as the Morgan , as early as 1857 , but the NSHBA was the first national association for an American @-@ developed breed of horse . A member of Morgan 's Raiders , General John Breckinridge Castleman , was instrumental in forming the NSHBA . In 1899 , the organization name was changed to the American Saddle Horse Breeders Association , clarifying the breed 's name as the " American Saddle Horse , " not simply " Saddle Horse . " 
 = = = 20th century to present = = = 
 After World War I , the American Saddlebred began to be exported to South Africa , and it is now the most popular non @-@ racing breed in that country . Saddlebred horse show standards continued to evolve through the 1920s , as the popularity of the breed grew . The Saddlebred industry slowed during World War II , but began to grow again post @-@ war , with Mexico , Missouri earning the title " Saddle Horse Capital of the World " . Exports continued , and though attempts to begin a South African breed registry had started in 1935 , it was not until 1949 that the Saddle Horse Breeders ' Society of South Africa was formed . The 1950s saw continued growth of the Saddlebred breed , and The Lemon Drop Kid , a fine harness horse , became the first , and only , Saddlebred to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated . In the late 1950s , the Saddle Horse Capital became centered in Shelby County , Kentucky , largely due to the success of breeders Charles and Helen Crabtree , the latter a renowned <unk> coach . Although individual Saddlebreds had been exported to Great Britain throughout the breed 's history , the first breeding groups were transported there in 1966 . For the next three decades , enthusiasts worked to establish a breeding and showing platform for the breed in the UK . 
 In 1980 , the name of the American Saddle Horse Breeder 's Association was changed to the American Saddlebred Horse Association ( ASHA ) , membership was opened to non @-@ breeders , and the group began to focus on breed promotion . In 1985 , the ASHA became the first breed registry to have their headquarters at the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington , Kentucky . A decade later , in 1995 , the United Saddlebred Association – UK was formed to register Saddlebreds in Great Britain , and acts as the British affiliate of the ASHA . Since the founding of the American registry , almost 250 @,@ 000 horses have been accepted , with almost 3 @,@ 000 new foals registered annually . It is the oldest still @-@ functioning breed registry in the US . Most common in the eastern US , the breed is also found throughout North America , Europe , Australia , and in South Africa . 
 Located at the Kentucky Horse Park is the American Saddlebred Museum , which curates a large collection of Saddlebred @-@ related items and artwork , as well as a 2 @,@ 500 @-@ volume library of breed @-@ related works . There are many magazines which focus on the American Saddlebred : " Show Horse Magazine " , " Bluegrass Horseman " , " The National Horseman " , " Saddle and Bridle " , and " Show Horse International " . 
 = = = Show ring history = = = 
 As a show horse , Saddlebreds were exhibited in Kentucky as early as 1816 , and were a prominent part of the first national horse show in the United States , held at the St. Louis Fair in 1856 . The Kentucky State Fair began running a World Championship show in 1917 , offering a $ 10 @,@ 000 prize for the champion five @-@ gaited horse . Also in 1917 , the American Horse Shows Association , now the United States Equestrian Federation , formed and began to standardize show formats and rules . In 1957 , the American Saddlebred Pleasure Horse Association was formed to regulate English pleasure classes . Today , the most prestigious award in the breed industry is the American Saddlebred " Triple Crown " : winning the five @-@ gaited championships at the Lexington Junior League Horse Show , the Kentucky State Fair World 's Championship Horse Show , and American Royal horse show ; a feat that has only been accomplished by six horses . 
 The breed 's show history also paralleled major historical developments . Heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis , who owned and exhibited Saddlebreds into the 1940s , organized the first " All @-@ Negro " horse show in Utica , Michigan , allowing greater opportunities for African @-@ American people to exhibit horses at a time when there was significant racial segregation in the United States . Gas shortages in the 1970s and 1980s put pressure on the recreational dollar , and saw the growth of single breed shows at the expense of the multi @-@ breed traditional horse show . At the beginning of the 21st century , the number of women showing Saddlebreds increased , with female competitors winning several world championships . 
 = = Uses = = 
 Today , the Saddlebred is exhibited in the United States in multiple divisions , including assorted in @-@ hand classes ; ridden in saddle seat classes for three- and five @-@ gaited horses in both Park and pleasure classes , hunter country pleasure , and western pleasure ; plus pleasure driving , fine harness , roadster harness classes . In five @-@ gaited competition , they are shown with a full tail , often augmented with an artificial switch , and a full mane . Three @-@ gaited horses are shown with a shaved off " <unk> " mane and with the hair at the top of their tails , an area called the dock , trimmed short . While use of a set tail in certain types of competition was common , today , <unk> are generally not allowed on the show grounds , except for horses in the Park Pleasure division , and horses with unset tails are not penalized in any division . <unk> is prohibited . 
 Outside of breed @-@ specific shows , the Saddlebred is also promoted as suitable for competitive trail riding , endurance riding , dressage , combined driving , eventing , and show jumping . Some Saddlebreds are also suitable for fox hunting , cutting and roping . Because they are so closely affiliated with their traditional show ring competition , they are sometimes mistaken for warmbloods or Thoroughbred crosses when participating in other equine events . They are also suitable family horses used for trail and pleasure riding and ranch work . 
 = = = Film and celebrity affiliation = = = 
 Many film and television horses of the Golden Age of Hollywood were also Saddlebreds , including the horses used in lead roles in My Friend Flicka , National Velvet , Fury and one version of Black Beauty . A half @-@ Saddlebred played the lead role in the TV series Mr. Ed , and a Saddlebred was used in a prominent role in Giant . In the 1990s , William Shatner , an actor and Saddlebred breeder , rode one of his own horses , a mare named Great Belles of Fire , in his role as James T. Kirk in Star Trek Generations . Numerous other celebrities have been owners and exhibitors of the breed , including Clark Gable , Will Rogers , Joe Louis , and Carson Kressley . 
 = BLEU = 
 BLEU ( bilingual evaluation understudy ) is an algorithm for evaluating the quality of text which has been machine @-@ translated from one natural language to another . Quality is considered to be the correspondence between a machine 's output and that of a human : " the closer a machine translation is to a professional human translation , the better it is " – this is the central idea behind BLEU . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] BLEU was one of the first metrics to achieve a high correlation with human judgements of quality , [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and remains one of the most popular automated and inexpensive metrics . 
 Scores are calculated for individual translated segments — generally sentences — by comparing them with a set of good quality reference translations . Those scores are then averaged over the whole corpus to reach an estimate of the translation 's overall quality . <unk> or grammatical correctness are not taken into account . 
 BLEU is designed to approximate human judgement at a corpus level , and performs badly if used to evaluate the quality of individual sentences . 
 BLEU ’ s output is always a number between 0 and 1 . This value indicates how similar the candidate and reference texts are , with values closer to 1 representing more similar texts . However , few human translations will attain a score of 1 . The candidate texts must be identical to a reference translation . For this reason , it is not necessary to attain a score of 1 . Because there are more opportunities to match , adding additional reference translations will increase the BLEU score . [ 5 ] 
 = = Algorithm = = 
 BLEU uses a modified form of precision to compare a candidate translation against multiple reference translations . The metric modifies simple precision since machine translation systems have been known to generate more words than are in a reference text . This is illustrated in the following example from <unk> et al . ( 2002 ) , 
 Of the seven words in the candidate translation , all of them appear in the reference translations . Thus the candidate text is given a unigram precision of , 
 <formula> 
 where <formula> is number of words from the candidate that are found in the reference , and <formula> is the total number of words in the candidate . This is a perfect score , despite the fact that the candidate translation above retains little of the content of either of the references . 
 The modification that BLEU makes is fairly straightforward . For each word in the candidate translation , the algorithm takes its maximum total count , <formula> , in any of the reference translations . In the example above , the word " the " appears twice in reference 1 , and once in reference 2 . Thus <formula> . 
 For the candidate translation , the count <formula> of each word is clipped to a maximum of <formula> for that word . In this case , " the " has <formula> and <formula> , thus <formula> is clipped to 2 . <formula> is then summed over all words in the candidate . This sum is then divided by the total number of words in the candidate translation . In the above example , the modified unigram precision score would be : 
 <formula> 
 In practice , however , using individual words as the unit of comparison is not optimal . Instead , BLEU computes the same modified precision metric using n @-@ grams . The length which has the " highest correlation with monolingual human judgements " [ 6 ] was found to be four . The unigram scores are found to account for the adequacy of the translation , how much information is retained . The longer <formula> <unk> scores account for the fluency of the translation , or to what extent it reads like " good English " . 
 Another problem with BLEU scores is that they tend to favor short translations , which can produce very high precision scores , even using modified precision . An example of a candidate translation for the same references as above might be : 
 the cat 
 In this example , the modified unigram precision would be , 
 <formula> 
 as the word ' the ' and the word ' cat ' appear once each in the candidate , and the total number of words is two . The modified <unk> precision would be <formula> as the <unk> , " the cat " appears once in the candidate . It has been pointed out that precision is usually twinned with recall to overcome this problem [ 7 ] , as the unigram recall of this example would be <formula> or <formula> . The problem being that as there are multiple reference translations , a bad translation could easily have an inflated recall , such as a translation which consisted of all the words in each of the references . [ 8 ] 
 To produce a score for the whole corpus the modified precision scores for the segments are combined using the geometric mean multiplied by a brevity penalty to prevent very short candidates from receiving too high a score . Let <formula> be the total length of the reference corpus , and <formula> the total length of the translation corpus . If <formula> , the brevity penalty applies , defined to be <formula> . ( In the case of multiple reference sentences , <formula> is taken to be the sum of the lengths of the sentences whose lengths are closest to the lengths of the candidate sentences . However , in the version of the metric used by NIST evaluations prior to 2009 , the shortest reference sentence had been used instead . ) 
 <unk> is an interactive version of BLEU that allows a user to visually examine the BLEU scores obtained by the candidate translations . It also allows comparing two different systems in a visual and interactive manner which is useful for system development . [ 9 ] 
 = = Performance = = 
 BLEU has frequently been reported as correlating well with human judgement , [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] and remains a benchmark for the assessment of any new evaluation metric . There are however a number of criticisms that have been voiced . It has been noted that although in principle capable of evaluating translations of any language , BLEU cannot in its present form deal with languages lacking word boundaries . [ 13 ] 
 It has been argued that although BLEU has significant advantages , there is no guarantee that an increase in BLEU score is an indicator of improved translation quality . [ 14 ] There is an inherent , systemic problem with any metric based on comparing with one or a few reference translations : in real life , sentences can be translated in many different ways , sometimes with no overlap . Therefore , the approach of comparing by how much any given translation result by a computer differs from just a few human translations is flawed . <unk> is another automated MT metric that compares to very many translations in a reference grammar defined by human translators ; the drawback is then that the human effort involved in correctly defining the <unk> many ways to render the meaning of the translation in practice means <unk> also is only an approximation . 
 = Gryposaurus = 
 Gryposaurus ( meaning " hooked @-@ nosed ( Greek <unk> ) lizard " ; sometimes incorrectly translated as " griffin ( Latin gryphus ) lizard " ) was a genus of duckbilled dinosaur that lived about 83 to 74 million years ago , in the Late Cretaceous ( late Santonian to late Campanian stages ) of North America . Named species of Gryposaurus are known from the Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta , Canada , and two formations in the United States : the Lower Two Medicine Formation in Montana and the Kaiparowits Formation of Utah . 
 Gryposaurus is similar to Kritosaurus , and for many years the two were thought to be synonyms . It is known from numerous skulls , some skeletons , and even some skin impressions that show it to have had pyramidal scales projecting along the midline of the back . It is most easily distinguished from other duckbills by its narrow arching nasal hump , sometimes described as similar to a " Roman nose , " and which may have been used for species or sexual identification , and / or combat with individuals of the same species . A large bipedal / quadrupedal herbivore around 9 meters ( 30 feet ) long , it may have preferred river settings . 
 = = Description = = 
 Gryposaurus was a hadrosaurid of typical size and shape ; one of the best specimens of this genus , the nearly complete type specimen of Kritosaurus incurvimanus ( now regarded as a synonym of Gryposaurus notabilis ) came from an animal about 8 @.@ 2 meters ( 27 feet ) long . This specimen also has the best example of skin impressions for Gryposaurus , showing this dinosaur to have had several different types of scalation : pyramidal , ridged , limpet @-@ shaped scutes upwards of 3 @.@ 8 centimeters long ( 1 @.@ 5 inches ) on the flank and tail ; uniform polygonal scales on the neck and sides of the body ; and pyramidal structures , flattened side @-@ to @-@ side , with fluted sides , longer than tall and found along the top of the back in a single midline row . 
 The three named species of Gryposaurus differ in details of the skull and lower jaw . The prominent nasal arch found in this genus is formed from the paired nasal bones . In profile view , they rise into a rounded hump in front of the eyes , reaching a height as tall as the highest point of the back of the skull . The skeleton is known in great detail , making it a useful point of reference for other duckbill skeletons . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Gryposaurus was a saurolophine ( hadrosaurine of older references ) hadrosaurid , a member of the duckbill subfamily without hollow head crests . The general term " gryposaur " is sometimes used for duckbills with arched nasals . <unk> was once thought to fall into this group as well , before it was described ( then known under the nickname " Antonio " ) . A subfamily , <unk> , was coined by Jack Horner as part of a larger revision that promoted Hadrosaurinae to family status , but is not now in use . A rough equivalent is Kritosaurini , as used by Alberto Prieto @-@ Márquez . The issue of its relationships to other hadrosaurs is complicated by lack of resolution on how it compares to Kritosaurus . At this time , the main differences between the two are location ( Alberta , Montana , and Utah for Gryposaurus , New Mexico for Kritosaurus ) and age ( Kritosaurus comes from slightly younger rocks than Gryposaurus ) . Otherwise , the skull of Kritosaurus is incompletely known , lacking most of the bones in front of the eyes , but very similar to that of Gryposaurus . 
 The following is a cladogram based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Prieto @-@ Márquez and Wagner in 2012 , showing the relationships of Gryposaurus among the other <unk> : 
 = = Discovery and history = = 
 Gryposaurus is based on specimen NMC <unk> , a skull and partial skeleton collected in 1913 by George F. Sternberg from what is now known as the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta , along the Red Deer River . This specimen was described and named by Lawrence Lambe shortly thereafter , Lambe drawing attention to its unusual nasal crest . A few years earlier , Barnum Brown had collected and described a partial skull from New Mexico , which he named Kritosaurus . This skull was missing the snout , which had eroded into fragments ; Brown restored it after the duckbill now known as Anatotitan , which was flat @-@ headed , and believed that some unusual pieces were evidence of compression . Lambe 's description of Gryposaurus provided evidence of a different type of skull configuration , and by 1916 the Kritosaurus skull had been redone with a nasal arch and both Brown and Charles Gilmore had proposed that Gryposaurus and Kritosaurus were one and the same . This idea was reflected in William Parks 's naming of a nearly complete skeleton from the Dinosaur Park Formation as Kritosaurus incurvimanus , not Gryposaurus incurvimanus ( although he left Gryposaurus notabilis in its own genus ) . Direct comparison between Kritosaurus incurvimanus and Gryposaurus notabilis is hindered by the fact that the incurvimanus type specimen is missing the front part of the skull , so the full shape of the nasal arch cannot be seen . The 1942 publication of the influential Lull and Wright monograph on hadrosaurs sealed the Kritosaurus / Gryposaurus question for nearly fifty years in favor of Kritosaurus . Reviews beginning in the 1990s , however , called into question the identity of Kritosaurus navajovius , which has limited material for comparison with other duckbills . Thus , Gryposaurus has once again been separated , at least temporarily , from Kritosaurus . 
 This situation is made more confusing by old suggestions by some authors , including Jack Horner , that Hadrosaurus is also the same as either Gryposaurus , Kritosaurus , or both . This hypothesis was most common in the late 1970s – early 1980s , and appears in some popular books ; one well @-@ known work , The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs , uses Kritosaurus for the Canadian material ( Gryposaurus ) , but identifies the mounted skeleton of K. incurvimanus as Hadrosaurus in a photo caption . Although Horner in 1979 used the new combination Hadrosaurus [ Kritosaurus ] notabilis for a partial skull and skeleton and a second less @-@ complete skeleton from the Bearpaw Shale of Montana ( which have since fallen out of the literature ) , by 1990 he had changed his position , and was among the first to again use Gryposaurus in print . Current thought is that Hadrosaurus , although known from fragmentary material , can be distinguished from Gryposaurus by differences in the upper arm and ilium . 
 Further research has revealed the presence of a second species , G. latidens , from slightly older rocks in Montana than the classic gryposaur localities of Alberta . Based on two parts of a skeleton collected in 1916 for the American Museum of Natural History , G. latidens is also known from bonebed material . Horner , who described the specimens , considered it to be a less derived species . 
 New material from the Kaiparowits Formation of Utah , in Grand Staircase @-@ Escalante National Monument , includes a skull and partial skeleton that represent the species G. monumentensis . Its skull was more robust than that of the other species , and its predentary had enlarged prongs along its upper margin , where the lower jaw 's beak was based . This new species greatly expands the geographic range of this genus , and there may be a second , more lightly built species present as well . Multiple gryposaur species are known from the Kaiparowits Formation , represented by cranial and postcranial remains , and were larger than their northern counterparts . 
 = = = Species = = = 
 Three named species are recognized today : G. notabilis , G. latidens , and G. monumentensis . The type species G. notabilis is from the late Campanian @-@ age Upper Cretaceous Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta , Canada . It is now thought that another species from the same formation , Kritosaurus incurvimanus ( also known as Gryposaurus incurvimanus ) , is a synonym of G. notabilis . The two had been differentiated by the size of the nasal arch ( larger and closer to the eyes in G. notabilis ) and the form of the upper arm ( longer and more robust in K. incurvimanus ) . Ten complete skulls and twelve fragmentary skulls are known for G. notabilis along with postcrania , as well as with two skeletons with skulls that had been assigned to K. incurvimanus . G. latidens , from the late Santonian @-@ early Campanian Lower Two Medicine Formation of <unk> County , Montana , USA , is known from partial skulls and skeletons from several individuals . Its nasal arch is prominent like that of G. notabilis , but farther forward on the snout , and its teeth are less derived , reflecting iguanodont @-@ like characteristics . The informal name " <unk> " is an early , unused name for this species . G. monumentensis is known from a skull and partial skeleton from Utah . G. monumentensis was listed second on the top 10 list of new species in 2008 by the International Institute for Species Exploration . 
 The dubious hadrosaurid Stephanosaurus marginatus was considered a possible species of Kritosaurus , following the synonymy of Gryposaurus with Kritosaurus . However , this synonymy was rejected in the 2004 edition of the Dinosauria , with Stephanosaurus being tabulated as dubious . 
 = = Paleobiology = = 
 As a hadrosaurid , Gryposaurus would have been a bipedal / quadrupedal herbivore , eating a variety of plants . Its skull had special joints that permitted a grinding motion analogous to chewing , and its teeth were continually replacing and packed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of teeth , only a relative handful of which were in use at any time . Plant material would have been cropped by its broad beak , and held in the jaws by a cheek @-@ like organ . Its feeding range would have extended from the ground to about 4 m ( 13 ft ) above . 
 Like other bird @-@ hipped dinosaurs of the Dinosaur Park Formation , Gryposaurus appears to have only existed for part of the duration of time that the rocks were being formed . As the formation was being laid down , it recorded a change to more marine @-@ influenced conditions . Gryposaurus is absent from the upper part of the formation , with Prosaurolophus present instead . Other dinosaurs known from only the lower part of the formation include the horned Centrosaurus and the hollow @-@ crested duckbill Corythosaurus . Gryposaurus may have preferred river @-@ related settings . 
 = = = Nasal arch = = = 
 The distinctive nasal arch of Gryposaurus , like other cranial modifications in duckbills , may have been used for a variety of social functions , such as identification of sexes or species and social ranking . It could also have functioned as a tool for broadside pushing or butting in social contests , and there may have been inflatable air sacs flanking it for both visual and auditory signaling . The top of the arch is roughened in some specimens , suggesting that it was covered by thick , keratinized skin , or that there was a cartilaginous extension .

 Argon @-@ argon radiometric dating indicates that the Kaiparowits Formation was deposited between 76 @.@ 1 and 74 @.@ 0 million years ago , during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period . During the Late Cretaceous period , the site of the Kaiparowits Formation was located near the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway , a large inland sea that split North America into two landmasses , Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east . The plateau where dinosaurs lived was an ancient floodplain dominated by large channels and abundant wetland peat swamps , ponds and lakes , and was bordered by highlands . The climate was wet and humid , and supported an abundant and diverse range of organisms . This formation contains one of the best and most continuous records of Late Cretaceous terrestrial life in the world . 
 Gryposaurus monumentensis shared its paleoenvironment with other dinosaurs , such as dromaeosaurid theropods , the troodontid Talos <unk> , ornithomimids like Ornithomimus velox , tyrannosaurids like Albertosaurus and Teratophoneus , armored ankylosaurids , the duckbilled hadrosaur Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus , the ceratopsians Utahceratops <unk> , Nasutoceratops <unk> and Kosmoceratops richardsoni and the oviraptorosaurian <unk> giganteus . Other <unk> present in the Kaiparowits Formation included <unk> ( sharks and rays ) , frogs , salamanders , turtles , lizards and crocodilians . A variety of early mammals were present including multituberculates , marsupials , and <unk> . 
 = Pain fitzJohn = 
 Pain fitzJohn ( sometimes Payn fitzJohn , Payn FitzJohn , or Pagan fitzJohn ; died 1137 ) was an Anglo @-@ Norman nobleman and administrator , one of King Henry I of England 's " new men " , who owed their positions and wealth to the king . Pain 's family originated in Normandy , but there is little to suggest that he had many ties there , and he appears to have spent most of his career in England and the Welsh Marches . A son of a minor nobleman , he rose through ability to become an important royal official during Henry 's reign . In 1115 he was rewarded with marriage to an heiress , thereby gaining control of the town of Ludlow and its castle , which he augmented with further acquisitions . 
 Although later medieval traditions described Pain as a chamberlain to King Henry , that position is not securely confirmed in contemporary records . He did hold other offices though , including that of sheriff in two counties near the border between England and Wales . In his capacity as a royal justice Pain also heard legal cases for the king throughout much of western England . 
 After King Henry 's death in 1135 Pain supported Henry 's nephew , King Stephen , and was with the new king throughout 1136 . In July 1137 Pain was ambushed by the Welsh and killed as he was leading a relief expedition to the garrison at Carmarthen . His heirs were his daughters , Cecily and Agnes . Cecily married the son of one of Pain 's close associates , Miles of Gloucester . Pain was generous in his gifts of land to a number of monastic houses . 
 = = Family background = = 
 Pain was a son , likely the eldest , of John fitzRichard , a tenant @-@ in @-@ chief listed in Domesday Book . John may have had two wives , therefore the identity of Pain 's mother is uncertain . On the basis of landholding , it has been speculated that Pain 's mother was a daughter of Ralph Mortimer , who held Wigmore in Domesday Book . As well as being a moneyer , Pain 's paternal grandfather , who came from near Avranches in Normandy , owned a mill . Pain 's brother , Eustace fitzJohn , became a royal official who owned lands in the north of England . His other siblings included William , Alice and Agnes . William was probably the same William who later held Harptree in Somerset , and in 1130 was a royal justice in western England . Alice was the abbess of Barking Abbey and Agnes became the wife of Roger de Valognes . 
 Pain was born some time before 1100 . His father may have been in the service of King Henry in Normandy before Henry became king . The family lands in England , which were not extensive , were mainly in East Anglia , and Pain appears to have inherited most of them ; his payment for danegeld , a tax , in 1130 for his East Anglian properties was 40 shillings , compared to only 9 shillings for his brother Eustace . 
 = = Marriage and lands = = 
 All accounts agree that Pain married in 1115 and that his wife was named Sybil , although the identity of Sybil 's parents is unclear . Pain 's Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry states that he married Sybil Talbot , the niece of Hugh de Lacy . The Complete Peerage states that he married Sybil , the daughter of Geoffrey Talbot and Talbot 's wife Agnes , who was herself probably the daughter of Walter de Lacy . The historian K. S. B. Keats @-@ Rohan states that Pain married Sybil de Lacy , the daughter of Hugh de Lacy , a view shared by fellow historians Judith Green and Paul Dalton . Others such as Bruce Coplestone @-@ Crow and David Crouch agree with the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography 's designation of Sybil as Hugh 's niece , and daughter of Geoffrey Talbot and Agnes , the sister of Hugh de Lacy . 
 King Henry and King Stephen recognized Pain as the legitimate holder of the lands acquired through his wife Sybil . Her kinsman Gilbert de Lacy was the son of Roger de Lacy , who had been banished from England in 1095 and his English estates confiscated ; he had though retained his properties in Normandy . Roger 's English possessions were given to his brother Hugh de Lacy , from whom Sybil had inherited them . On Roger 's death Gilbert inherited the lands in Normandy , and pressed his claim to the family 's former English estates . Coplestone @-@ Crow speculates that the uncertainty hanging over the inheritance was one reason why Pain endeavoured to secure more lands around Ludlow . 
 Pain is the presumed builder of Pain 's Castle in the Welsh county of Radnor . He also controlled Caus Castle in Shropshire , and through his wife Ludlow Castle in the same county . Although he held the title to Weobley Castle , he does not appear to have exercised any control over it , which eventually went to Gilbert de Lacy . Pain was not the only recipient of Hugh de Lacy 's lands ; some went to Jocelin de Dinan and some to Miles of Gloucester . Pain 's share included property in Gloucestershire , Herefordshire , and Worcestershire , and he succeeded in acquiring additional lands near Ludlow , adding to the manors he held there through his wife ; his holdings of land were considered to be worth 17 knights fees . By 1130 he had evidently acquired additional properties in Oxfordshire , where he is recorded as being excused payment of danegeld that year . 
 = = Career = = 
 = = = Under Henry I = = = 
 Pain was too young to serve King William Rufus , but according to the later 12th @-@ century writings of Walter Map he may have been a chamberlain — one of the officials in charge of the royal household — for William 's brother , King Henry I ( reigned 1100 – 1135 ) . There is no contemporary evidence for Pain having held that office and nor is it likely , given Map 's story , that Pain was involved with Henry 's financial affairs ; rather it appears that if indeed he was a chamberlain , he was a body servant . Map relates a story about Pain serving the king personally at night , providing Henry with wine if the king called for it . The story continues that Pain once drank the wine and was caught out by Henry when the king subsequently demanded his nightcap . Map finishes the story by saying that the king then ordered that Pain should be given wine every night while awaiting the king 's pleasure . Although the story is unlikely to be true in all details , it suggests that Pain 's service to the king was personal as well as judicial and governmental . Other evidence against Map 's claim that Pain was a chamberlain is that he never attested a royal charter in that office . 
 The author of the Gesta Stephani described Pain as having been a page at Henry 's court , stating that he owed his position to being one of the " special and very intimate friends of King Henry " and that although Pain had been " taken into [ Henry 's ] service as [ one of his ] court pages " , it appears likely that the three fitzJohn brothers — Pain , Eustace and William — worked to advance each other 's careers , as they are frequently found witnessing , or attesting , the same charters and other royal documents . 
 In 1115 , Pain was a witness to a charter of confirmation that King Henry issued to Geoffrey de Clive , the Bishop of Hereford , issued in the Welsh Marches . Sometime between 1123 and 1127 he was appointed Sheriff of Herefordshire , and in 1127 became Sheriff of Shropshire also . He held the sheriffdoms of Hereford and Shropshire at least until 1136 , and probably until his death . Pain is also often termed the king 's " <unk> " or " justiciar " for those counties , and he had the custody of King Henry 's prisoner , Waleran of Melun , from September 1126 until late 1126 , when Waleran was moved to Wallingford Castle and the custody of Brian <unk> . 
 Pain was one of Henry 's " new men " , who owed their positions and wealth to the king . The medieval writer Orderic Vitalis described them as a group as " of base stock who had served him [ Henry ] well , raised them , so to say , from the dust " and that the king " stationed them above earls and famous castellans " . Although Orderic stated that the families of these men were not considered high status , this likely was an exaggeration on the chronicler 's part . Pain 's family was respectable enough , as his father held a number of properties directly from the king . It appears that Pain did not always take the king 's side ; the historian C. Warren Hollister has argued that Pain was not among the supporters of Henry 's only surviving legitimate child , Matilda , in 1126 , when Henry had his nobility swear that they would recognise her as his heiress . Hollister feels that the removal of Waleran from Pain 's custody was a sign that Pain had not supported Matilda . 
 Pain consolidated much of his power in Shropshire and Herefordshire at Bridgnorth Castle , often using that site as a place of business in preference to Shrewsbury , which had previously been the main centre of business for his predecessors as sheriff . As well as Waleran , Pain imprisoned a Welsh hostage there in 1128 , Llywelyn ab Owain , the nephew of Maredudd ap Bleddyn , ruler of the Welsh principality of Powys . Besides Bridgnorth , Pain used his possession of Ludlow Castle to consolidate his power in the Welsh Marches . During Henry 's reign , the Welsh border was a zone of frequent raids and conflict between the Anglo @-@ Normans and the Welsh . 
 The Gesta Stephani indicates that Pain , along with Miles of Gloucester , was a major landholder in the western part of England , and the pair managed to dominate justice in that region . According to the document the two men " raised their power to such a pitch that from the Severn to the sea , all along the border between England and Wales , they involved everyone in litigation and forced services . " The later medieval writer Gerald of Wales called Miles and Pain " secretaries and privy councillors of the king " . 
 The 1130 Pipe Roll noted that Pain was a royal justice in Staffordshire , Gloucestershire , and Pembroke . Besides the ordinary court , Pain also heard cases relating to the forest law in those counties . The Pipe Roll does not record Pain as sheriff in Shropshire , but this is likely because the Shropshire returns for that year are missing from it . Also in 1130 , Pain was consulted by the king about the appointment to a vacant bishopric . The Diocese of Hereford had been vacant since the death of Richard de Capella in August 1127 , and the king consulted with Pain and the constable of Hereford before accepting their candidate — Robert de Bethune , the prior of Llanthony Priory . In 1132 Pain was present , along with his brother , at the Christmas court held by King Henry . Subsequently Caus Castle , which was under Pain 's control , was burnt by the Welsh in 1134 . As lord of Caus , Pain was involved in efforts to suppress Welsh raiding . Although Pain held Caus , his title to the fortification was unclear , as it had earlier been held by Robert Corbet . 
 By the end of Henry 's reign , Pain had witnessed over 60 royal charters for the king , spanning a period from around 1115 until 1135 . Although Pain witnessed a large number of royal documents , this activity took place mostly in England , as few of the documents he witnessed were drawn up while the king was in Normandy . As a reward for his service , Henry gave Pain the lordships of Ewias Lacy and Archenfield , both in Wales . 
 = = = Under Stephen = = = 
 Following King Henry 's death in 1135 , the succession was disputed between the king 's nephews — Stephen and his elder brother , Theobald II , Count of Champagne — and Henry 's surviving legitimate child Matilda , usually known as the Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the Holy Roman Emperor , Henry V. King Henry 's only legitimate son , William , had died in 1120 . After Matilda was widowed in 1125 , she returned to her father , who married her to Geoffrey , Count of Anjou . All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry 's heir , but when Henry I died in 1135 , Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned before either Theobald or Matilda could react . The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy , and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France . Matilda , though , was less sanguine , and secured the support of the Scottish king , David , who was her maternal uncle , and in 1138 also that of her half @-@ brother , Robert , Earl of Gloucester , an illegitimate son of Henry I. 
 On Henry 's death in December 1135 , Pain attended the king 's funeral . Pain was an early supporter of King Stephen , although he was said initially to have been afraid to appear at Stephen 's court for fear of being confronted by those he had oppressed . Nevertheless , Pain was with the new king by early January 1136 , when he witnessed one of Stephen 's documents , dated to around 4 January 1136 , at Reading . By Easter , both Pain and his brother Eustace had formally submitted to the king . Pain witnessed a royal charter at Oxford in April 1136 . The king rewarded the brothers by continuing to appoint them to judicial functions , and confirmed grants made by them to various religious houses . 
 After Henry 's death , the Welsh attempted to drive out the Norman lords who had been extending their control into Wales during Henry 's reign . Pain was with King Stephen at the siege of Exeter from June to August 1136 , early in the king 's reign . Crouch argues that Stephen did not at that time trust Pain , and kept him at the siege to more easily monitor his actions , and to prevent him from defecting to Matilda 's cause . 
 = = Relations with the Church = = 
 In 1119 Pope Callixtus II addressed letters to a group of Anglo @-@ Norman landholders in the Welsh Marches , including Pain , accusing them of having appropriated the lands of the Diocese of Llandaff and ordering their return . Pain was among a group of nobles similarly accused by Pope Honorius II in 1128 . Honorius once again ordered the nobles to restore to the Church lands they had confiscated . 
 Pain gave lands to Llanthony Priory , helping to establish the endowment of that monastic house , although it is difficult to distinguish his gifts from those of Hugh de Lacy , as the monks of Llanthony grouped the gifts of both men together in their records . In addition Pain granted lands to Gloucester Abbey , which had benefited from the generosity of his father and brother , as did his wife Sybil , together with other grants to her uncle the abbot . She also gave to two churches in Hereford : St Peter and St Guthlac . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 On 10 July 1137 Pain was killed by a javelin blow to the head , during an ambush by the Welsh as he was leading a relief expedition to the garrison at Carmarthen . He was buried in Gloucester Abbey , following a funeral service conducted by Robert de Bethune . A number of barons from the Welsh Marches attended , including Miles of Gloucester . Pain 's widow continued to hold Ludlow Castle until the middle of 1139 , when she was forced to surrender it to King Stephen . Stephen then gave Sybil in marriage to Jocelin de Dinan , who consequently acquired Ludlow Castle through his new wife , setting up the background to Gilbert Lacy 's attempts to seize Ludlow from Dinan on which the medieval Welsh romance work Fouke le Fitz Waryn is based . 
 Pain 's heirs were his two daughters , Cecily and Agnes . His heir male was his brother , Eustace fitzJohn . The two daughters were married five times in total ; Cecily married three times but failed to produce any direct heirs . Her first husband was Roger , the son of Miles of Gloucester . Pain arranged Cecily and Roger 's marriage . The marriage contract specified that Roger would inherit all of Pain 's lands , but as result of the latter 's death the marriage was not contracted until December 1137 , when King Stephen confirmed the terms of the settlement . The king also settled the bulk of the inheritance on Cecily , which led to disturbances and a minor war among disappointed claimants . Agnes married Warin de <unk> and after his death <unk> de <unk> . She died after 1185 , by which time she was described as a widow . 
 The historian W. E. Wightman described Pain as a " second @-@ class baron and first @-@ class civil servant " .

 " When I Was Your Man " is a song recorded by American singer and songwriter Bruno Mars for his second studio album , Unorthodox Jukebox ( 2012 ) . Atlantic Records released the song as the third promotional single and as the second official single , taken from the album , to mainstream radio in the United States on January 15 , 2013 . " When I Was Your Man " was written by Bruno Mars , Philip Lawrence , Ari Levine and Andrew Wyatt ; with Mars , Lawrence and Levine credited for composing the song as well . 
 The pop song is an emotional piano ballad with lyrics describing the heartbreak and regret Mars felt from letting his lover get away , and his expressed hope that her new man will give her all the love and attention that he failed to provide . It features Mars singing and a piano accompaniment as the sole instrumentation . " When I Was Your Man " received mostly positive reviews from music critics , who generally praised Mars ' vocal prowess ; calling it a " vulnerable and emotional ballad " . The song won " Favorite Hit " at the 2013 Premios Juventud and was nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards . " When I Was Your Man " topped the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart , and reached the top ten on the singles chart of Australia , Canada , Denmark , France , Ireland , Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , South Korea and the United Kingdom .

 Cameron Duddy and Mars directed the ballad 's accompanying music video . It portrays Mars as a " lonely balladeer " who sits at his piano donned in a pair of sunglasses while setting a half @-@ full glass of whiskey atop it . Critics resoundingly complimented the simplicity of the video 's production . The song has been covered by artists , including Mike Ward , who released a studio version of the song after he performed it on The Voice UK .

 While working on the album , Mars said : " I 'm never singing another ballad again , " but that came from the gut – it 's the most honest , real thing I 've ever sung , " he says . " When there are no safe bets , that 's when I feel my blood move . " He also shared how important the lyrics to this song are for him when he posted a photograph of Unorthodox Jukebox 's artwork via his Twitter account . " Soon you guys will hear a song I wrote called When I Was Your Man . I 've never been this nervous . Can 't explain it , " he tweeted . Philip Lawrence explained the inspiration of the song : " I think Bruno and I are both huge fans of older music , like Billy Joel and Elton John . We always loved those moments where you can sit at the piano and emote . Those intimate moments when an artist is so naked and vulnerable ; you can ’ t help but be drawn to it . We always wanted to find a stripped down song like that , which is how that song came to be . The subject matter was real life ; Bruno had experienced that , so we tried to say it in the best and catchiest way we could . "

It starts with a rolling piano riff ; unto a nearly scat " vocal cadence " : " Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now / Our song on the radio but it don ’ t sound the same " , as he laments the " single state " he created for himself . Next , he sings of his failings ; to do right by his woman , " I shoulda bought you flowers / And held your hand / Shoulda gave you all my hours / When I had the chance " . Its title phrase re @-@ emerges in the final chorus , juxtaposed by Bruno from all the things he " shoulda " done , into things he hopes his ex ’ s new man will do ; concluding : " Do all of the things I should have done / When I was your man " . In an interview to Rolling Stone , Mars revealed , while reluctant , that he wrote the song for his girlfriend , model Jessica Caban , when he was worried about losing her . In contrast with the song , Mars and Caban stayed together ; remaining a couple as of 2014 . Mars also said , in the interview , that he finds it difficult to perform the song ; saying : " You 're bringing up all these old emotions again , " and that : " It 's just like bleeding ! " 
 For Andrew Unterberger of Pop Dust , the song " starts out dangerously close to ' Drops of Jupiter ' territory , but luckily , there are no fried chicken or soy latte lyrics to be found here . " He also noted that , " ' When I Was Your Man ' goes minimal with the musical accompaniment , featuring just Bruno and his piano , sounding halfway between an Alicia Keys ballad and Prince ’ s ' How Come U Don 't Call Me Anymore ?

 = SS American ( 1900 ) = 
 SS American was a steel @-@ hulled , single propeller cargo ship built at Chester , Pennsylvania , by the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding and Engine Works for the American @-@ Hawaiian Steamship Company and the Hawaiian sugar trade . During World War I service for the United States Navy , the ship was known as USS American ( ID @-@ <unk> ) . Late in her career for American @-@ Hawaiian , she was renamed SS Honolulan . 
 American was a little more than 430 feet ( 130 m ) long and 51 feet ( 16 m ) abeam . Coal @-@ fired boilers powered a single triple @-@ expansion steam engine which turned a single screw propeller . This power plant — supplemented with auxiliary sails — was capable of moving the ship at up to 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) . As one of the first four ships ordered by the American @-@ Hawaiian Steamship Company after its 1899 formation , American was used on the Hawaii – New York sugar trade via the Straits of Magellan . In 1901 she set a record for the fastest New York – San Francisco ocean passage , making the voyage in 59 days . After 1905 , she was employed in inter @-@ coastal service via the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and , after it opened in 1914 , the Panama Canal . 
 Taken up for wartime service after the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , she completed two round @-@ trip voyages to France without incident . Shortly after the start of her third such voyage , however , she collided with another U.S. Navy vessel , USS West Gate , sinking that vessel with the loss of seven of her crew in October 1918 . She completed one more round trip in U.S. Navy service , sailing to Gibraltar after the Armistice in November . She returned to New York in February 1919 , was decommissioned , and returned to American @-@ Hawaiian . 
 SS American resumed cargo service with American @-@ Hawaiian after her return from naval service , being renamed Honolulan in 1925 . She was sold in 1926 and taken to Osaka where she was broken up sometime after her arrival there in November that same year . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 The American @-@ Hawaiian Steamship Company , shortly after its March 1899 formation , placed orders for its first four ships for the company 's planned sugar service between Hawaii and the East Coast of the United States . Three ships — American , Hawaiian , and Oregonian — were ordered from Delaware River Shipbuilding in Chester , Pennsylvania , while the fourth — Californian — was ordered from Union Iron Works of San Francisco . The contract cost of the three Pennsylvania @-@ built ships was set at $ 425 @,@ 000 each , but financing costs drove the final cost of each ship higher ; the final cost of American was $ 61 @.@ 00 per deadweight ton , which totaled just under $ 540 @,@ 000 . 
 American ( Delaware River yard no . 308 ) was launched on 14 July 1900 , and delivered to American @-@ Hawaiian in October , joining Californian in the American @-@ Hawaiian Fleet . American , the first of the trio of Pennsylvania ships to be completed , was 6 @,@ 861 gross register tons ( GRT ) , and was 430 feet 1 inch ( 131 @.@ 09 m ) in length and 51 feet 2 inches ( 15 @.@ 60 m ) abeam . She had a deadweight tonnage of 8 @,@ 850 LT DWT , and her cargo holds had a storage capacity of 376 @,@ 699 cubic feet ( 10 @,@ 666 @.@ 9 m3 ) . American had a speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) , and was powered by a single triple @-@ expansion steam engine with coal @-@ fired boilers , that drove a single screw propeller . American and her sister ships , equipped with two upright masts , carried and used two large <unk> , a fore staysail and jib , and a main staysail , to help conserve coal for their journeys . 
 = = Early career = = 
 At the start of her American @-@ Hawaiian career , American sailed in scheduled service from New York and Philadelphia around South America via the Straits of Magellan , up to San Francisco and from there to Honolulu . Along the way , she was refueled with coal at Saint Lucia in the British West Indies and at Coronel in Chile . The Chilean coal was often of lesser quality which burned too quickly and dangerously sent sparks flying from the ship 's funnel ; the quality and fire danger were key reasons that all subsequent American @-@ Hawaiian ships used oil instead of coal for fuel . 
 The early American @-@ Hawaiian voyages averaged about 70 days in each direction from New York to San Francisco , which was about 55 days shorter than the typical time required for sailing ships . Insurers initially made the company pay a 6 % premium for taking its large ships through the treacherous 300 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 560 km ) channel in the Straits of Magellan , rather than the safer passage around Cape Horn . But by 1903 , American @-@ Hawaiian 's safe operation and experience on the route allowed the company to negotiate a 3 ½ % rate , just a ½ % surcharge over the standard rate of 3 % . The experience on the route also paid off in shorter transit times : American set a record time with a 59 @-@ day New York @-@ to @-@ San Francisco passage in 1901 . However , typical times for the trip were just over 50 days by 1903 . 
 In May 1905 , after two years of negotiations , American @-@ Hawaiian signed a contract with the Tehuantepec National Railway of Mexico , abandoning the Straits of Magellan route in favor of the Tehuantepec Route . Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican ports — Salina Cruz , Oaxaca , for eastbound cargo , and Coatzacoalcos , Veracruz , for westbound cargo — and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec , Mexico 's narrowest point , on the railroad . Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii , while westbound cargoes were more general in nature . 
 After the United States occupation of Veracruz on 21 April 1914 ( which found six American @-@ Hawaiian ships in Mexican ports ) , the Huerta @-@ led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping . This loss of access , coupled with the fact that the Panama Canal was not yet open , caused American @-@ Hawaiian to return to its historic route of sailing around South America via the Straits of Magellan in late April . With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August , American @-@ Hawaiian ships switched to taking that route . In October 1915 , landslides closed the Panama Canal and all American @-@ Hawaiian ships , including American , returned to the Straits of Magellan route again . 
 American 's exact movements from this time through early 1917 are unclear . She may have been in the half of the American @-@ Hawaiian fleet that was chartered for transatlantic service . She may also have been in the group of American @-@ Hawaiian ships chartered for service to South America , delivering coal , gasoline , and steel in exchange for coffee , nitrates , cocoa , rubber , and manganese ore . However , when the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , the entire American @-@ Hawaiian fleet , including American , was requisitioned by the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) , which then returned the ships for operation by American @-@ Hawaiian . 
 = = U.S. Navy service = = 
 In May 1918 , the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) selected American for service carrying United States Army cargo to France as a part of the U.S. Navy 's Naval Overseas Transportation Service ( NOTS ) . On 22 May , American was turned over to the Navy and assigned the identification number of <unk> . She was commissioned as USS American on 25 May with Lieutenant Commander ( Lt. Cdr . ) Myron P. Schermerhorn , USNRF , in command . One week later , American , loaded with cargo , departed New York and joined up with an eastbound convoy on 2 June , reaching Brest , France , on 17 June . She sailed to Bordeaux via La Pallice to unload , and departed on 6 July , reaching New York 16 days later . After a quick turnaround , American sailed for Bordeaux again on 5 August and had arrived back at New York on 6 September . 
 = = = Collision with West Gate = = = 
 On 4 October , American began her third trip to France in a convoy escorted by the cruiser Denver and headed to Bordeaux . On the night of 6 / 7 October — noted in the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships as " particularly dark and rainy " — the ships were having trouble maintaining their stations in the convoy ; American was sailing in the column headed by the convoy 's guide ship , Sagua . 
 At 02 : 28 on 7 October , while about 250 nautical miles ( 460 km ) south of Halifax , the steering gear engine of USS West Gate — ahead and to the starboard of American — jammed , sending the ship veering sharply to the port . West Gate 's crew put the ship 's engine at half speed to try to drop out of the convoy , but minutes later , men on the bridge sighted the red light from the oncoming American . Though West Gate 's bridge rang up " full speed ahead " to avoid the collision , there was not enough time for the engine to respond before American 's bow cut into the starboard side of West Gate , near the poop deck . 
 American , which was lightly damaged by the collision , reversed her engine to back out of the tangle while West Gate 's engine was shut down . After American was completely backed out , West Gate began rapidly settling and was ordered abandoned . A total of seven men from West Gate died in the accident — two when their lifeboat capsized , and a further five that probably died in the initial impact . West Gate 's commanding officer , Lt. Cdr . R. B. Vandervoort , and six men he had personally escorted to a life raft were picked up by one of American 's lifeboats at 06 : 00 , after some 3 ½ hours in the water . The Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships does not report any casualties on American from the collision . 
 American proceeded to Halifax , where she had her collision damage repaired over the next six weeks . She departed for Gibraltar on 27 November , a little more than two weeks after the signing of the Armistice with Germany that ended the fighting . After calling at that British port on 9 December , American docked at Marseilles , before leaving for New York in the new year , arriving there on 9 February 1919 . American was decommissioned and returned to American @-@ Hawaiian on 4 March , and formally struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 14 May . 
 = = Later career = = 
 American resumed cargo service with American @-@ Hawaiian after her return from World War I service . Though the company had abandoned its original Hawaiian sugar routes by this time , American sailed in inter @-@ coastal service through the Panama Canal . In June 1925 , American @-@ Hawaiian announced its intent to acquire six steamers from W. R. Grace and Company . Later in the year , American was renamed Honolulan in order to free her name for the newly acquired Santa Barbara . In 1926 , Honolulan was sold for scrap . She was taken to Osaka , Japan , and was broken up some time after her arrival there in November that same year .

 Dælenenga idrettspark is a sports facility located at Grünerløkka in Oslo , Norway . It consists of an artificial turf football pitch , a club house and an indoor ice rink — Grünerhallen . The facilities are owned by the Municipality of Oslo and used and operated by Grüner IL , the local sports club . 
 The venue opened in 1916 and was originally used for football , athletics and speed skating . The club house was completed in 1928 and has since been used for martial arts . From 1929 , a velodrome course was installed , which remained in use until 1940 . During the 1930s , the venue was the main Oslo stadium for the Workers ' Sports Federation ( AIF ) . A speedway course was installed in 1947 and remained in use until 1968 . The venue featured eight ice hockey matches and two bandy matches during the 1952 Winter Olympics . Artificial ice was laid in 1985 and the skating hall opened in 1995 , two years before the artificial turf was laid . 
 = = History = = 
 Construction started in 1915 . The stadium opened in 1916 as a combined football and athletics venue with a capacity for 10 @,@ 000 spectators . The track was iced during winter and used for speed skating . Dælenenga was one of two multi @-@ sport venues serving eastern Oslo , along with Jordal <unk> . The club house , used for wrestling and boxing , opened in 1928 . The following year , the ice rink was decommissioned and a velodrome was instead installed , which remained in use until 1940 . During the Second World War , the club house was used as a school . 
 In 1947 , the velodrome was removed and the track converted for use for speedway . For the 1952 Winter Olympics , the venue was upgraded with a new ice hockey clock , a new lighting system and new ice hockey boards . The speedway course was dismounted in 1968 . During the 1980s , the stadium became a central location for drug dealing , but the traffic moved away during the 1990s . In 1985 , artificial ice was laid north of the football pitch , costing 2 @.@ 1 million Norwegian krone ( NOK ) . Of this , NOK 1 @.@ 3 million was financed by Grüner IL through loans . At the same time a new gravel pitch was laid on the football field . 
 The artificial ice increased the popularity of playing ice hockey in the neighborhood . The club therefore started working on plans to build an indoor ice rink over the artificial rink . Planning of the hall started in 1989 , and in 1990 a proposal for a steel structure was launched . However , it was rejected by the municipality . The club therefore hired Einar Dahle Arkitekter to work on a new design , resulting in area planning regulations being passed in 1991 . Financing of the steel structure had been secured in loans , but these were stopped following a credit crunch . In 1994 , the municipality initiated a redevelopment program of the downtown residential areas , which included grants to build Grünerhallen . The hall was estimated to cost NOK 23 @.@ 4 million and the contract was awarded to Mur 6 Tax . Construction started in March 1995 and the venue opened on 6 October 1995 , as the 30th indoor ice rink in Norway . In 1996 , the city council had to grant an additional NOK 4 @.@ 6 million to cover cost overruns . 
 Ahead of 1997 , the municipal council granted NOK 3 @.@ 2 million to lay artificial turf at Dælenenga . Construction started in May and the pitch was taken into use on 4 September 1997 . The new turf was Belgian @-@ manufactured , sand @-@ filled <unk> 32 . The upgrade also saw the first upgrades to the terraces in the stadium 's history . New artificial turf was laid in 2008 .

The football pitch has artificial turf and measures 100 by 64 meters ( 109 by 70 yd ) . The club house has a floor area of 900 square meters ( 9 @,@ 700 sq ft ) and is built in brick . The building has suffered under lack of maintenance and has been subject to water damage , although the outer walls and foundation are in good condition .

 During the late 1920s and 1930s , Dælenenga was dominated by the Workers ' Sports Federation ( AIF ) and served as its main stadium in Oslo . AIF 's Grünerløkka chapter was established at Dælenenga and used it as its training ground . Dælenenga was used for major AIF tournaments and the largest tournament took place 5 July 1929 , with 500 participants . It also served as the terminus of many of AIF 's and other labor movement parades . Each May Day the stadium would be packed . From the early 1930s , AIF moved its largest tournaments to Jordal . The local AIF club was particularly good at boxing , and in 1937 gathered thousands of spectators to watch a boxing match at Dælenenga .
