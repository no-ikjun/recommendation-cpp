 Born settled in as a young academic at Göttingen as a privatdozent . In Göttingen , Born stayed at a boarding house run by Sister Annie at <unk> 17 , known as El <unk> . The name was derived from the first letters of the last names of its boarders : " El " for Ella Philipson ( a medical student ) , " Bo " for Born and Hans <unk> ( a physics student ) , " Ka " for Theodore von Kármán ( a Privatdozent ) , and " Re " for Albrecht Renner ( another medical student ) . A frequent visitor to the boarding house was Paul Peter Ewald , a doctoral student of Arnold Sommerfeld on loan to Hilbert at Göttingen as a special assistant for physics . Richard Courant , a mathematician and Privatdozent , called these people the " in group . " 
 In 1912 , Born met Hedwig ( Hedi ) Ehrenberg , the daughter of a University of Leipzig law professor , and a friend of Carl Runge 's daughter Iris . She was of Jewish background on her father 's side , although he had become a practising Lutheran when he got married , as did Max 's sister Käthe . Despite never practising his religion , he refused to convert , and his wedding on 2 August 1913 was a garden ceremony . However , he was baptised as a Lutheran in March 1914 by the same pastor who had performed his wedding ceremony . Born regarded " religious professions and churches as a matter of no importance " . His decision to be baptised was made partly in deference to his wife , and partly due to his desire to assimilate into German society . The marriage produced three children : two daughters , Irene , born in 1914 , and Margarethe ( Gritli ) , born in 1915 , and a son , Gustav , born in 1921 . Through marriage , Born is related to jurists Victor Ehrenberg , his father @-@ in @-@ law , and Rudolf von <unk> , his wife 's maternal grandfather , as well as Hans Ehrenberg , and is a great uncle of British comedian Ben Elton . 
 By the end of 1913 , Born had published 27 papers , including important work on relativity and the dynamics of crystal lattices , which became a book . In 1914 received a letter from Max Planck explaining that a new professor <unk> chair of theoretical physics had been created at the University of Berlin . The chair had been offered to Max von Laue , but he had turned it down . Born accepted . The First World War was now raging . Soon after arriving in Berlin in 1915 he enlisted in an Army signals unit . In October he joined the Artillerie @-@ <unk> @-@ Kommission , the Army 's Berlin @-@ based artillery research and development organisation , under Rudolf Ladenburg , who had established a special unit dedicated to the new technology of sound ranging . In Berlin , Born formed a lifelong friendship with Einstein , who became a frequent visitor to Born 's home . Within days of the armistice in November 1918 , Planck had the Army release Born . A chance meeting with Fritz Haber that month led to discussion of the manner in which an ionic compound is formed when a metal reacts with a halogen , which is today known as the Born – Haber cycle . 
 Even before Born had taken up the chair in Berlin , von Laue had changed his mind , and decided that he wanted it after all . He arranged with Born and the faculties concerned for them to exchange jobs . In April 1919 Born became professor ordinarius and Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics on the science faculty at the University of Frankfurt am Main . While there , he was approached by the University of Göttingen , which was looking for a replacement for Peter Debye as Director of the Physical Institute . " Theoretical physics , " Einstein advised him , " will flourish wherever you happen to be ; there is no other Born to be found in Germany today . " In negotiating for the position with the education ministry , Born arranged for another chair , of experimental physics , at Göttingen for his long @-@ time friend and colleague James Franck .

 For the 12 years Born and Franck were at Göttingen from 1921 to 1933 , Born had a collaborator with shared views on basic scientific concepts — a distinct advantage for teaching and his research on the developing quantum theory . The approach of close collaboration between theoretical physicists and experimental physicists was also shared by Born at Göttingen and Arnold Sommerfeld at the University of Munich , who was ordinarius professor of theoretical physics and Director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics — also a prime mover in the development of quantum theory . Born and Sommerfeld not only shared their approach in using experimental physics to test and advance their theories , but Sommerfeld , in 1922 when he was in the United States lecturing at the University of Wisconsin – Madison , sent his student Werner Heisenberg to be Born 's assistant . Heisenberg again returned to Göttingen in 1923 , where he completed his habilitation under Born in 1924 , and became a privatdozent at Göttingen . 
 In 1925 , Born and Heisenberg formulated the matrix mechanics representation of quantum mechanics . On 9 July , Heisenberg gave Born a paper entitled Über <unk> <unk> <unk> und <unk> <unk> ( " Quantum @-@ Theoretical Re @-@ interpretation of Kinematic and Mechanical Relations " ) to review , and submit for publication . In the paper , Heisenberg formulated quantum theory , avoiding the concrete , but unobservable , representations of electron orbits by using parameters such as transition probabilities for quantum jumps , which necessitated using two indexes corresponding to the initial and final states . When Born read the paper , he recognized the formulation as one which could be transcribed and extended to the systematic language of matrices , which he had learned from his study under Jakob <unk> at Breslau University . 
 Up until this time , matrices were seldom used by physicists ; they were considered to belong to the realm of pure mathematics . Gustav Mie had used them in a paper on electrodynamics in 1912 and Born had used them in his work on the lattices theory of crystals in 1921 . While matrices were used in these cases , the algebra of matrices with their multiplication did not enter the picture as they did in the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics . With the help of his assistant and former student Pascual Jordan , Born began immediately to make a transcription and extension , and they submitted their results for publication ; the paper was received for publication just 60 days after Heisenberg 's paper . A follow @-@ on paper was submitted for publication before the end of the year by all three authors . The result was a surprising formulation : 
 <formula> 
 where p and q were matrices for location and momentum p , and I is the identity matrix . The result arises because matrix multiplication is not commutative . This formulation was entirely attributable to Born , who also established that all the elements not on the diagonal of the matrix were zero . Born considered that his paper with Jordan contained " the most important principles of quantum mechanics including its extension to electrodynamics . " The paper put Heisenberg 's approach on a solid mathematical basis . 
 Even Born was surprised to discover that Paul Dirac had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg . Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom , and found that they agreed with the Bohr model . Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger , who looked at the problem using wave mechanics . This had a great deal of appeal to many at the time , as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics . Born would have none of this , as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment . He formulated the now @-@ standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ * ψ in the Schrödinger equation , which he published in July 1926 . 
 In a letter to Born on 4 December 1926 , Einstein made his famous remark regarding quantum mechanics : 
 Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing . But an inner voice tells me that it is not yet the real thing . The theory says a lot , but does not really bring us any closer to the secret of the ' old one ' . I , at any rate , am convinced that He is not playing at dice . 
 This quotation is often paraphrased as ' God does not play dice ' . 
 In 1928 , Einstein nominated Heisenberg , Born , and Jordan for the Nobel Prize in Physics , but Heisenberg alone won the 1932 Prize " for the creation of quantum mechanics , the application of which has led to the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen " , while Schrödinger and Dirac shared the 1933 Prize " for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory " . On 25 November 1933 , Born received a letter from Heisenberg in which he said he had been delayed in writing due to a " bad conscience " that he alone had received the Prize " for work done in Göttingen in collaboration — you , Jordan and I. " Heisenberg went on to say that Born and Jordan 's contribution to quantum mechanics cannot be changed by " a wrong decision from the outside . " In 1954 , Heisenberg wrote an article honouring Planck for his insight in 1900 , in which he credited Born and Jordan for the final mathematical formulation of matrix mechanics and Heisenberg went on to stress how great their contributions were to quantum mechanics , which were not " adequately acknowledged in the public eye . " 
 Those who received their Ph.D. degrees under Born at Göttingen included Max Delbrück , Siegfried Flügge , Friedrich Hund , Pascual Jordan , Maria Goeppert @-@ Mayer , Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim , Robert Oppenheimer , and Victor Weisskopf . Born 's assistants at the University of Göttingen 's Institute for Theoretical Physics included Enrico Fermi , Werner Heisenberg , Gerhard Herzberg , Friedrich Hund , Pascual Jordan , Wolfgang Pauli , Léon Rosenfeld , Edward Teller , and Eugene Wigner . Walter Heitler became an assistant to Born in 1928 , and completed his habilitation under him in 1929 . Born not only recognised talent to work with him , but he " let his superstars stretch past him ; to those less gifted , he patiently handed out respectable but <unk> assignments . " Delbrück , and Goeppert @-@ Mayer went on to win Nobel Prizes . 
 = = Later life = = 
 In January 1933 , the Nazi Party came to power in Germany . In May , Born became one of six Jewish professors at Göttingen who were suspended with pay ; Franck had already resigned . In twelve years they had built Göttingen into one of the world 's foremost centres for physics . Born began looking for a new job , writing to Maria Göppert @-@ Mayer at Johns Hopkins University and Rudi Ladenburg at Princeton University . Offers soon started to pour in , and he accepted one from St John 's College , Cambridge . At Cambridge , he wrote a popular science book , The Restless Universe , and a textbook , Atomic Physics , that soon became a standard text , going through seven editions . His family soon settled into life in England , with his daughters Irene and Gritli becoming engaged to Welshman Brinley ( Bryn ) Newton @-@ John ( Olivia Newton @-@ John 's parents ; Born is Olivia 's grandfather and Irene is her mother ) and Englishman Maurice Pryce respectively . 
 Born 's position at Cambridge was only a temporary one , and his tenure at Göttingen was terminated in May 1935 . He therefore accepted an offer from C. V. Raman to come to Bangalore in 1935 . Born considered taking a permanent position there , but the Indian Institute of Science did not create an additional chair for him . In November 1935 , the Born family had their German citizenship revoked , rendering them stateless . A few weeks later Göttingen cancelled Born 's doctorate . Born considered an offer from Pyotr Kapitsa in Moscow , and started taking Russian lessons from Rudolf Peierls 's Russian @-@ born wife Genia . But then Charles Galton Darwin asked Born if he would consider becoming his successor as Tait Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh , an offer that Born promptly accepted , assuming the chair in October 1936 . 
 In Edinburgh , Born promoted the teaching of mathematical physics . He had two German assistants , E. Walter Kellermann and Klaus Fuchs , and together they continued to investigate the mysterious behaviour of electrons . Born became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1937 , and of the Royal Society of London in March 1939 . During 1939 , he got as many of his remaining friends and relatives still in Germany as he could out of the country , including his sister Käthe , in @-@ laws Kurt and Marga , and the daughters of his friend Heinrich Rausch von <unk> . Hedi ran a domestic bureau , placing young Jewish women in jobs . Born received his certificate of naturalisation as a British subject on 31 August 1939 , one day before the Second World War broke out in Europe . 
 Born remained at Edinburgh until he reached the retirement age of 70 in 1952 . He retired to Bad Pyrmont , in West Germany , in 1954 . In October , he received word that he was being awarded the Nobel Prize . His fellow physicists had never stopped nominating him . Franck and Fermi had nominated him in 1947 and 1948 for his work on crystal lattices , and over the years , he had also been nominated for his work on solid state , quantum mechanics and other topics . In 1954 , he received the prize for " fundamental research in Quantum Mechanics , especially in the statistical interpretation of the wave function " — something that he had worked on alone . In his Nobel lecture he reflected on the philosophical implications of his work : 
 I believe that ideas such as absolute certitude , absolute exactness , final truth , etc. are figments of the imagination which should not be admissible in any field of science . On the other hand , any assertion of probability is either right or wrong from the standpoint of the theory on which it is based . This loosening of thinking ( <unk> des <unk> ) seems to me to be the greatest blessing which modern science has given to us . For the belief in a single truth and in being the possessor thereof is the root cause of all evil in the world . 
 In retirement , he continued scientific work , and produced new editions of his books . He died in hospital in Göttingen on 5 January 1970 . He is buried in the <unk> there , in the same cemetery as Walther Nernst , Wilhelm Weber , Max von Laue , Otto Hahn , Max Planck , and David Hilbert . He was survived by wife Hedi , who died in 1972 , and children Irene , Gritli and Gustav . His great @-@ grandchildren include songwriter Brett Goldsmith , singer Tottie Goldsmith and racing car driver Emerson Newton @-@ John .

 Codex Boreelianus , Codex Boreelianus Rheno @-@ <unk> ( full name ) , designated by Fe or 09 in the Gregory @-@ Aland numbering and ε 86 in von Soden numbering , is a 9th ( or 10th ) century uncial manuscript of the four Gospels in Greek . The manuscript , written on parchment , is full of lacunae ( or gaps ) , many of which arose between 1751 and 1830 . The codex was named Boreelianus after Johannes Boreel ( 1577 – 1629 ) , who brought it from the East . 
 The text of the codex represents the majority of the text ( Byzantine text @-@ type ) , but with numerous alien readings ( non @-@ Byzantine ) . Some of its readings do not occur in any other manuscript ( so called singular readings ) . According to the present textual critics its text is not a very important manuscript , but it is quoted in all modern editions of the Greek New Testament . 
 The manuscript was brought from the East at the beginning of the 17th century . It was in private hands for over 100 years . Since 1830 it has been housed at the Utrecht University . 
 = = Description = = 
 The codex contains the text of the four Gospels , on 204 parchment leaves of size 28 @.@ 5 × 22 cm ( 11 @.@ 2 × 8 @.@ 7 in ) , with numerous lacunae ( or gaps ) . The text of the existing codex begins with Matthew 9 : 1 and ends with John 13 : 34 . Luke is even more incomplete . In 1751 Wettstein remarked that the codex started at Matthew 7 : 6 and that only the <unk> with Matthew 8 : 25 and Mark 11 : 6 – 16 were missing . It means that in his time the manuscript was far more complete than at present . At present , lacunae of the manuscript include : 
 Matthew 1 : 1 – 9 : 1 ; 12 : 1 – 44 ; 13 : 55 – 14 : 9 ; 15 : 20 – 31 ; 20 : 18 – 21 : 5 ; 
 Mark 1 : 43 – 2 : 8 ; 2 : 23 – 3 : 5 ; 11 : 6 – 26 ; 14 : 54 – 15 : 5 ; 15 : 39 – 16 : 19 ; 
 Luke – at least 24 gaps ; 
 John 3 : 5 – 14 ; 4 : 23 – 38 ; 5 : 18 – 38 ; 6 : 39 – 63 ; 7 : 28 – 8 : 10 ; 10 : 32 – 11 : 3 ; 12 : 14 – 25 ; 13 : 34 @-@ end . 
 The leaves are unbound and are kept in loose quires . The text is written in late uncial script , in two columns per page , with mostly 19 lines per column , in large uncial letters . <unk> the writing is close to the Codex <unk> I. 
 The letters Η , Μ , <unk> , and Π , are square , the letters Ε , Θ , Ο , Σ , and Φ have a round shape . The letters Δ , Ε , Θ , Ο , and especially Ψ in cruciform , are of the form characteristic for the late uncial script . Φ is large and bevelled at both ends . The letters were written by an ' elegant and careful ' hand . 
 The nomina sacra ( or sacred names ) are written in an abbreviated way : ΘΣ for <unk> , <unk> for <unk> , <unk> for <unk> , <unk> for κυριος , <unk> for υιος , <unk> for <unk> , <unk> for <unk> , <unk> for <unk> , <unk> for <unk> , <unk> for <unk> , <unk> for <unk> , <unk> for <unk> , <unk> for <unk> , <unk> for <unk> , <unk> for <unk> , ΔΑΔ for <unk> , <unk> for <unk> , <unk> for <unk> , etc . The words at the end of lines are sometimes abbreviated too . It uses typographic ligatures . 
 The codex has a lot of grammar errors , like hiatus ( e.g. <unk> in Matthew 9 : 14 , <unk> in Matthew 9 : 21 , ειπεν in Matthew 9 : 22 , etc . ) and N <unk> . The error of iotacism occurs infrequently . 
 The breathings ( rough and smooth breathing ) and accents ( see e.g. Greek diacritics ) are given fully and usually correctly . The breathings are indicated by sigla <unk> and <unk> , often used in codices from the 9th and 10th century . In some cases breathings are given incorrectly ( e.g. Matthew 9 @,@ 7 @.@ 16 ) . 
 The text is divided according to the Ammonian Sections , with the usual number of sections , are written on the left margin , but there are given without references to the Eusebian Canons . There is no division according to the κεφαλαια ( chapters ) , but the τιτλοι ( titles ) are given at the top of the pages , sometimes also at the bottom . The capitals at the beginning of the sections stand out in the margin to indicate new sections ( as in codices Alexandrinus , Ephraemi , and Basilensis . Although there is no division according to the κεφαλαια ( chapters ) , the tables of the κεφαλαια ( tables of contents ) are placed before each Gospel ( except Matthew – because of its defective character ) . It has some lectionary markings at the margin . 
 The headpieces are decorated , with headings written in gold and red ; in some places nicely decorated initial letters can be found ( in red or gold ) . The Ammonian sections are written in red . The pages are numbered ; the Greek quire numbers are still found at the top right of some pages . At the top left of the first page of most quires in Gospel of Matthew , Arabic quire numbers are found . 
 There are several different correctors , among which the " first hand " worked on the codex , but the total number of corrections is not high .

 The Greek text of this codex is a representative of the Byzantine text @-@ type , but with a number of singular readings . According to Bruce M. Metzger it is typical Byzantine text . According to Kurt and Barbara Aland it agrees with the Byzantine standard text 156 times , and 78 times with the Byzantine when it has the same reading as the original text . It does not support the " original " text against the Byzantine . It has 11 independent or distinctive readings . Alands placed it in Category V of New Testament manuscripts . It is not a very important codex , but it is an important witness of the Byzantine text @-@ type . Hermann von Soden classified it as Ki ( now it is known as textual family E ) . According to the Claremont Profile Method it has mixed Byzantine text in Luke 1 ; in Luke 10 and Luke the manuscript is defective .

 H. Deane , a <unk> , in 1876 dated the manuscript to the 8th century , Tischendorf and Gregory to the 9th century ; <unk> and Tregelles to the 10th century . As of 1995 , it is dated by the Institute for New Testament Textual Research ( INTF ) to the 9th century . 
 The Codex Boreelianus is named after Johann Boreel ( 1577 – 1629 ) , Dutch Ambassador at the Court of James I of England . There is no record of Boreel 's obtaining the codex , but it is generally believed that he brought it to the Netherlands from one of his travels to the Middle East . The connection to Boreel is indicated by Wettstein , who was given a partial collation of the codex in 1730 . The collation was made by Izaak <unk> , rector of the Amsterdam gymnasium , and contained text from Matthew 7 : 2 to Luke 11 . Wettstein adds that he was not aware of its current location . Wettstein cited the codex in his Novum Testamentum <unk> ( 1751 ) , also in these parts , which do not survive to the present day ( e.g. Matthew 7 : 9 ) . Wettstein designated the codex by siglum F , Gregory designated it by 09 ( because number of New Testament manuscripts increased ) , von Soden gave for it siglum ε 86 . 
 After Johann Boreel 's death in 1629 , the codex itself was in private hands . Boreel ’ s library was sold in 1632 , but the manuscript may not have been among the items for sale . It could have remained in the possession of Boreel ’ s family , for example , in the hands of his younger brother , the theologian Adam Boreel ( 1602 – 54 ) . On folio 168 recto of the codex is written the monogram NLB with date " February 9 , 1756 " . On pages 40 recto and 40 verso Dutch notes can found , but they are almost illegible . 
 The codex resurfaced almost two centuries later , in 1823 , and was identified as the Boreelianus by the Utrecht professor Jodocus Heringa ( 1765 – 1840 ) . Its leaves had become disordered , and some of them were lost . Scrivener even stated : " Few manuscripts have fallen into such unworthy hands " . The manuscript was now in the private hands of Johannes Michaelis Roukens in Arnhem . In a letter of 11 March 1830 Roukens explained that the manuscript had been in the possession of his father , Arend Anton Roukens , who had inherited it from his father , Johannes Michaelis Roukens . 
 In 1841 Tischendorf wanted to see and examine the codex , but he was allowed to read only Heringa ’ s papers on it because Heringa was preparing his collation . Heringa ’ s papers were edited and published by Vinke in 1843 under the title <unk> Heringa El . Fil . <unk> de codice <unk> , nunc Rheno @-@ <unk> ab ipso in <unk> <unk> , which includes a full and exact collation of the text . 
 In 1850 Samuel Prideaux Tregelles , though with some difficulty , examined the codex . 
 Philipp <unk> in Introduction to the American Edition of Westcott @-@ Hort ( 1881 ) wrote that it is not an important manuscript . The same opinion gave biblical scholar Frederic G. Kenyon , according to whom the text of the codex has " comparatively little authority " . Despite these opinions , the codex continues to be cited in critical editions of Novum Testamentum Graece . Edition of Nestle @-@ Aland cited the codex from its first verse – i.e. Matthew 9 : 1 – in critical apparatus . 
 Since 1830 , the codex has been located in the library of the Utrecht University ( Ms. 1 ) . In March 2007 David <unk> visited Utrecht and viewed the manuscript with a number of colleagues . In October 2007 the manuscript was digitized .

 = Arts Club of Chicago = 
 Arts Club of Chicago is a private club located in the Near North Side community area of Chicago in Cook County , Illinois , United States , a block east of the Magnificent Mile , that exhibits international contemporary art . It was founded in 1916 , inspired by the success of the Art Institute of Chicago 's handling of the Armory Show . Its founding was viewed as a statement that art had become an important component of civilized urban life . The Arts Club is said to have been pro @-@ Modernist from its founding . The Club strove to break new ground with its shows , rather than collect the works of established artists as the Art Institute does . 
 The club presented Pablo Picasso 's first United States showing . In addition , the 1951 exhibition by Jean Dubuffet and his " <unk> Positions " lecture at the Arts Club were tremendous influences on what would become the mid @-@ 1960s Imagist movement . Another important presentation in the history of the Arts Club was the Fernand Léger showing of Le Ballet <unk> . 
 The Club 's move in 1997 to its current location at 201 E. Ontario Street was not without controversy because the club demolished its former interior space designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and moved only the central staircase to the new gallery space . However , the new space is 19 @,@ 000 square feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m2 ) , which is 7 @,@ 000 square feet ( 650 m2 ) larger than the old space . 
 = = Mission and purpose = = 
 The inaugural mission of the club was " to encourage higher standards of art , maintain galleries for that purpose , and to promote the mutual acquaintance of art lovers and art workers . " This mission arose from the contemporary Chicago active art scene , which had 30 commercial art galleries showing traditional art and an internationally recognized museum . Additionally , the local mass media gave equitable coverage to the visual arts . The art scene also had enough clubs and organizations for musicians , writers and artists . Unfortunately , the lively art scene did not adequately represent the avant @-@ garde art . The local galleries emphasized American , English and the occasional French work , emphasizing prints and drawings . This necessitated trips to New York City , London or Paris for Chicagoans who wanted to buy art . 
 The club does not generally show traveling exhibitions curated by others . Instead , it curates its own exhibits , often with very original works . This places emphasis on cutting edge and avant @-@ garde art . 
 = = History = = 
 The club was founded in 1916 and experienced its first coverage in the Chicago Tribune on March 16 , 1916 . It had office space in the Fine Arts Building that became too limiting to serve the club 's mission . In 1918 , the club elected Rue Winterbotham Carpenter to replace Mrs. Robert McGann as president . She moved the club to 610 South Michigan Avenue . The first exhibition included portraits by Whistler , Renoir , Cassatt , August Johns and others . By 1922 , the club had outgrown its quarters and sponsored supplementary space at the Art Institute of Chicago until 1927 when the cost of doing so became prohibitive . In 1924 , the club moved to the north tower of the Wrigley Building . Among its first exhibitions at the Wrigley building was the first major United States show ( seventeen sculptures , nineteen drawings and a painting ) of Brâncuși . The show was installed by Marcel Duchamp . Rue Carpenter died on December 7 , 1931 , and Mrs. Charles Goodspeed was elected president in 1932 . The club moved to more spacious accommodations at the Wrigley Building in 1936 . " <unk> " Goodspeed served as president until 1940 . Then , Rue Winterbotham Carpenter 's niece Rue Winterbotham Shaw was elected President . In 1947 , the club scaled down its operations for four years after losing its Wrigley Building lease . In 1951 , it moved to 109 East Ontario in quarters built to specification that were designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe . Using Arts Club furniture , he designed a gallery , dining room , and lecture hall in a pre @-@ existing building . The gallery was built around Constantin Brâncuși 's The Golden Bird and the stairway was renowned for its simple elegance . Shaw died in January 1979 and James Phinney Baxter was elected to serve until 1981 when Stanley Freehling was elected . The club struggled financially in the 1980s . 
 = = = 1990s - new building = = = 
 In the 1990s , the club was located west of Michigan Avenue and behind the 620 building which was home to many of Chicago 's finest art dealers including Richard Gray and Richard L. Feigen & Co . The Arts club did not own the land upon which their famous Mies clubhouse was built ; instead , the club held the land in a longterm leasehold . In 1990 , the owner of 620 N. Michigan and the Arts Club land decided to sell . At first the Arts Club hoped to raise the money to purchase its land along with the 620 N. Michigan Avenue property in an effort spearheaded by Richard Gray , but it quickly became apparent that the club would lose a bidding war over this valuable land . A developer bought the property and demolished the entire block to make way for a movie complex and shopping center . 
 With the prospect of losing its home , the Arts Club opted to sell one of the most valuable items in its collection to finance the purchase of new land . The club decided to sell Brâncuși 's Bird to the Art Institute of Chicago . To finance the purchase , the Art Institute sold several second tier works from its famous Impressionist collection at Sotheby 's in guaranteed lots which was a new concept in the auction world in 1990 . While without permanent home , the club continued to meet regularly in space loaned by the Casino , another famous Near North Side club . 
 The 19 @,@ 000 square feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m2 ) John Vinci designed building is a two @-@ story structure that cost $ 9 million for the land , building , landscaping , and interior design . The exterior facade is buff brick with black granite windowsills and thresholds and white @-@ painted steel windows . The building features furniture dating back to the club 's founding as well as Mies van der Rohe designs . Several elements of the new building 's design are considered homages to Mies . The fact that the building was so Miesian thirty years after his death while the club focused on avant @-@ <unk> art was a bit of a controversy .

 Until the Museum of Modern Art was founded in 1929 , Chicago and The Arts Club in particular was the most receptive exhibitor of modern art in the United States . At that time , no institution in the United States , especially none in Manhattan , would exhibit European modernism . By renting space at the Art Institute of Chicago 's Building the Arts Club was able to arrange showings in Chicago 's most prestigious museum . 
 The club has exhibited an impressive number of well @-@ known 20th century visual artists . Many of the century 's most controversial artists made their United States or midwest solo exhibition debuts at the club including : Alexander Calder , Marc Chagall , Salvador Dalí , Jean Dubuffet , Pablo Picasso , Jackson Pollock , Auguste Rodin , Georges Seurat , and Henri Toulouse @-@ Lautrec . In addition , many artists have given lectures at the Club , including Martha Graham , Kathleen Battle , Leonard Bernstein , Kenneth Branagh and Robert Altman . Aside from visual artists , the Club also has hosted lectures and performances from such prominent musicians as John Cage , Philip Glass , Ramsey Lewis and Igor Stravinsky , and poets W. H. Auden , Gertrude Stein and William Butler Yeats . Most notable among these exhibitions was Picasso 's first United States solo exhibition , Original Drawings by Pablo Picasso from March 20 to April 22 , 1923 , by the Arts Club at its installation at the Art Institute of Chicago . ( Picasso 's work had first been shown the US in a group show in New York curated by Edward Steichen in 1911 . ) In the 1930s , when Isamu Noguchi was still known as a sculptor , they hosted him . In 1970 when <unk> <unk> was a timely sculptor known for depicting the legend of orpheus , The Arts Club hosted a showing .

 The current location is the club 's seventh location . However , this is the first building owned by the club . The location history is listed below . 
 The first home at the Fine Arts Building had no exhibition space . The club was not able to put on its first exhibition until December 18 when it moved to a location with exhibition space . The club 's early gallery spaces were not sufficient to achieve the club 's goals and it agreed to assume cost and selection responsibilities for works in a series of shows at The Arts Club Exhibition Room at the Art Institute of Chicago from 1922 @-@ 1927 .

 = JBL Paragon = 
 The JBL <unk> Paragon is an iconic one @-@ piece stereo loudspeaker created by JBL that was introduced in 1957 and discontinued in 1983 ; its production run was the longest of any JBL speaker . At its launch , the Paragon was the most expensive domestic loudspeaker on the market . 
 Designed by Arnold Wolf from a concept elaborated by Richard Ranger , it is almost nine feet long and requires over a hundred man hours of hand @-@ finishing by a team of dedicated craftsmen . Resembling less a conventional loudspeaker than an elegant sideboard , it is a landmark product for the company that was sought after by the well @-@ heeled and celebrities . With estimated total production of about 1 @,@ 000 units , it is highly sought after by collectors to this day . 
 = = History = = 
 The Paragon is a horn @-@ loaded , stereo speaker system housed within a two piece ( Three piece including the slot in reflector panel ) 9 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) cabinet with a . It is based on a diffusion principle developed by Richard Ranger as consultant to JBL . Launched in 1957 , the Paragon is the world 's earliest production stereo loudspeaker for home use , and also the most expensive speaker at the time . As the flagship JBL product , it cost $ 1 @,@ 830 ( £ 650 ) – equivalent to more than $ 15 @,@ 000 in 2013 terms . The " Paragon " is the product with the longest production run of all JBL loudspeakers . It was produced continually until it was discontinued in 1983 , when it was replaced by a product line named " Everest " . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 Since even the early days of stereophonic sound , designers were faced with the issue of directionality and the listener who was not located exactly in between the two speaker units . Col. Richard R. Ranger , a pioneer of stereophonic sound in the film industry , conceptualised the solution to the problem of reproducing stereo sound for all and not just the centrally @-@ positioned listener . He devised a loudspeaker system where the sound from the speaker drive units would be refracted against curved surfaces ( wood panels ) within a cabinet to create a wide , uniform stereo image that would hold stable in any location within the listening room . Ranger elaborates on the JBL @-@ Ranger Radial Refraction system of stereophonic reproduction thus : 
 ... only along this axis of symmetry that the two speakers have consistently equal effect . As soon as the listener moves off axis , the speaker toward which he moves takes predominance . Sound intensity decreases rapidly with distance and the more distant speaker quickly loses out to the nearer . 
 This can be avoided by projecting the sound from each speaker against a curved surface which acts as a convex lens for the sound and directs it more strongly to the side opposite the speaker than it does to its own side . The convex refractor thus eliminates the sharp axis of symmetry where the slightest movement of the listener is so disturbing . 
 In the listening area in front of the integrated speaker system , the energy from the two stereo channels builds up a full front of sound which can readily be appreciated by more than one person . So the axis of symmetry no longer exerts its unstable equilibrium on the critical listener . 
 The term " unstable equilibrium " is not mere whimsy . In stereo reproduction , it is customary for the soloist to appear in the center . Then , certain sections of the accompanying music are positioned right or left ; but it is most important that wherever they are , they <unk> <unk> . Uncertain movement of the apparent sound source gives a very queasy feeling . 
 Once it became possible to hold monaural sound to the center , it was found that with regular stereo everything fell into its proper place ... A whole curtain of sound was opened up . 
 Ranger 's 9 @-@ foot prototype of the product , with plenty of right angles and shiny black Micarta skin , was bulky , imposing , and visually unattractive . Arnold Wolf was called in as the industrial design consultant to this project in early 1957 . Wolf , who would later become president and chief executive of JBL , was initially asked to produce a shell version for dealers ' shops . Due to transportation and installation constraints , it was decided that the speaker would be split into three components – the left and right channel enclosures , and the curved radiator panel – that could be easily re @-@ assembled with a screwdriver . To support the weight and prevent deforming , the design called for six feet , of which four are height @-@ adjustable . Instead of producing detailed drawings , Wolf worked with scale models . First , he created a 1 : 4 model in plastic , after which he made others . He ended with a 1 : 12 scale model that would show how it could be disassembled and reassembled . During the design phase , the relationship between Wolf and Ranger became very tense , and the project nearly collapsed . The parties came together over the month of June , and agreed on the definitive production specification for the Paragon . This would be a 2 @-@ way design . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 As can be seen from the diagram , the unusual shape of the Paragon made it very complicated to build . Engineering and factory translated the design into one executable on the shop floor . After overcoming the manufacturing challenges posed by the curved refractor panels and the cabinet legs , the speaker entered production in late 1957 . 
 The original 2 @-@ way design consisted of two 150 @-@ 4C bass drivers with 4 @-@ inch coils , and two <unk> @-@ 100 elliptical horns . The <unk> are essentially midrange drivers that start rolling off at 15 kHz . In 1960 , after feedback from foreign distributors , the Paragon was made into a 3 @-@ way loudspeaker by adding two 075 ring radiators ( tweeters ) mounted in the back of the cabinet and aimed at the central ' sweet spot ' . Bass – mid crossover was at 500 Hz and mid – treble frequencies crossed over at 7 kHz . 
 The Paragon much resembles a sideboard , measures 106 × 33 @.@ 75 × 24 @.@ 5 inches ( 269 × 86 × 62 cm ) , and weighs 850 pounds ( 390 kg ) according to the product brochure . Standard finishes include <unk> , birch , mahogany and ebony ; premium wood finishes included light and dark walnut , oak , teak , rosewood ; a piano lacquer finish would cost extra . A team of six worked on each unit , spending an estimated 112 to 125 @-@ man @-@ hours to complete a single unit , most of it spent on finishing of the woodwork . After assembly , eight hours would be needed just for sanding down the entire enclosure . Then , several coats of varnish are applied by hand , allowed to dry , and then smoothed down by further rubbing .

 = = = Reception = = = 
 Partick <unk> at L <unk> said that the ideal listening position is at least 3 metres away , and 40 – 50 cm lower than a normal seated position ; alternatively the speaker needs to be hoisted up by that amount for a comfortable sound . The sound itself is described as possessing " unshakeable dynamics " when turned up loud , pacey without any sign of fatiguing distortion , and with an impressive separation of instruments . Sonic Flare describes the sound of the Paragon as possessing well @-@ integrated " liquid highs , excellent midrange and bass " , and <unk> worth dying for . There are rumours that Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin acquired three Paragons each – one for each of left , center and right channels – with which they used to monitor their recordings from master tapes . 
 Only about a thousand units were ever produced over its 25 @-@ year life . At the height of production , five units left the factory each week . In 2000 , units in mint condition would fetch upwards of $ 20 @,@ 000 on the second hand market . It has featured in museum exhibitions , namely one held at Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2011 – 12 entitled " California Design , 1930 – 1965 : Living in a Modern Way . "

 = Interstate 81 in Maryland = 
 Interstate 81 ( I @-@ 81 ) is a part of the Interstate Highway System that runs from Dandridge , Tennessee to Fishers Landing , New York . In Maryland , the Interstate highway runs 12 @.@ 08 miles ( 19 @.@ 44 km ) from the West Virginia state line at the Potomac River in Williamsport north to the Pennsylvania state line near Maugansville . I @-@ 81 is the primary north – south Interstate highway in Washington County , connecting Hagerstown with Chambersburg and Harrisburg to the north and Martinsburg , Winchester , and Roanoke to the south . 
 The idea of a north – south bypass of Hagerstown to relieve congestion on the contemporary main highway through the Hagerstown Valley , U.S. Route 11 ( US 11 ) , predates the Interstate system . Construction on the Hagerstown Bypass began in the mid @-@ 1950s and was completed in 1958 from US 40 north to the Pennsylvania state line . I @-@ 81 was assigned to the new freeway in 1959 . The southern section of the freeway from the Potomac River to US 40 was built starting in 1962 and completed in 1966 . Beyond interchange improvements , I @-@ 81 has changed very little from the four @-@ lane freeway of the 1960s . Long @-@ range plans call for widening I @-@ 81 to six lanes and effecting further interchange improvements along what is a major commuting and trucking corridor . 
 = = Route description = = 
 I @-@ 81 crosses the Potomac River from West Virginia and enters Maryland as a four @-@ lane freeway with a speed limit of 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) . The Interstate curves to the northeast around Williamsport , where the highway meets MD 68 and MD 63 ( Lappans Road ) at a diamond interchange ( Exit 1 ) to the south of the town and US 11 ( Virginia Avenue ) at a five @-@ ramp partial cloverleaf interchange ( Exit 2 ) to the east . Beyond US 11 , I @-@ 81 's speed limit drops to 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) . The Interstate passes along the edge of the Hagerstown suburb of Halfway , where the highway meets I @-@ 70 ( Eisenhower Memorial Highway ) at a cloverleaf interchange ( Exit 4 ) with collector @-@ distributor lanes on both I @-@ 81 and I @-@ 70 . Traffic for I @-@ 68 is advised to use I @-@ 70 west . I @-@ 81 meets Halfway Boulevard , which leads to several shopping centers including the Valley Mall , at a six @-@ ramp partial cloverleaf interchange ( Exit 5 ) . 
 I @-@ 81 continues northeast along the west edge of Hagerstown . The Interstate crosses CSX 's Lurgan Subdivision and passes under MD 144 ( Washington Street ) with no access before reaching a cloverleaf interchange with US 40 ( National Pike ) ( Exit 6 ) . The freeway intersects MD 58 ( <unk> Pike ) at a partial cloverleaf interchange ( Exit 7 ) . Immediately to the north , I @-@ 81 has a partial interchange with Maugansville Road ( Exit 8 ) featuring a loop exit ramp from southbound I @-@ 81 and a straight entrance ramp to the northbound direction . The Interstate curves to the north and crosses Norfolk Southern Railway 's Lurgan Branch . The speed limit increases to 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) as the Interstate passes along the eastern edge of Maugansville , where the highway meets Maugans Avenue at a diamond interchange ( Exit 9 ) . I @-@ 81 meets Showalter Road , which is used to access Hagerstown Regional Airport , at a cloverleaf interchange ( Exit 10 ) as the freeway gently curves around the airport 's runway . The Interstate heads northeast to the Pennsylvania state line , on top of which the highway meets PA 163 ( Mason Dixon Road ) at Exit 1 of the Pennsylvania exit sequence . The southbound exit ramp to and entrance ramp from PA 163 are in Maryland and the northbound ramps are in Pennsylvania . 
 I @-@ 81 , like all Interstate highways , is a part of the National Highway System for its entire length . It is the shortest mainline Interstate in Maryland and contains the shortest portion of I @-@ 81 of all six states through which the Interstate highway passes . The Interstate was dedicated as Maryland Veterans Memorial Highway in 1987 . 
 = = History = = 
 The first section of I @-@ 81 to be constructed in Maryland was the pre @-@ Interstate Hagerstown Bypass that was planned to provide relief to the existing north – south highway through downtown Hagerstown , US 11 . The highway was planned to run from US 40 west of downtown Hagerstown to the Pennsylvania state line , where the Pennsylvania Department of Highways would continue the bypass north to tie into US 11 near Greencastle . Preliminary engineering on the Hagerstown Bypass began in 1954 and construction began in 1956 , by which time a southern extension was planned south to US 11 east of Williamsport . The freeway was completed from US 40 ( now MD 144 ) to the Pennsylvania state line in 1958 , including an interchange with the present alignment of US 40 west of downtown Hagerstown , a highway that was completed around 1963 . Traffic from the Hagerstown Bypass followed Mason Dixon Road to US 11 until the bypass was extended into Pennsylvania and tied into US 11 around modern Exit 3 in 1960 . The new freeway was marked as I @-@ 81 beginning in 1959 . 
 Construction on the portion of I @-@ 81 south of US 40 began in 1962 to fill a gap between the portion of I @-@ 81 in Maryland and the portion of the Interstate completed between WV 9 near Martinsburg and US 11 southwest of Williamsport in West Virginia . MD 144 's bridge over I @-@ 81 was constructed in 1963 once the relocated US 40 opened . The cloverleaf interchange between I @-@ 81 and the future I @-@ 70 was constructed in 1964 , including the collector / distributor lanes . The remainder of the highway south to the Potomac River , including the bridge over the Potomac River , was under construction by 1965 . The southern section of I @-@ 81 from the West Virginia state line to US 40 opened in 1966 . 
 I @-@ 81 remains very similar to when it was completed in 1966 . Exit numbers were first marked in 1974 ; these exit numbers have not changed . The Maugansville Road interchange was originally a full interchange , but it was reduced to a partial interchange in 1968 . The interchange with MD 68 and MD 63 south of Williamsport originally only had a northbound exit ramp and a southbound entrance ramp ; ramps to and from the direction of Hagerstown were added between 1981 and 1989 . The junction with Halfway Boulevard was a diamond interchange until it was rebuilt as a partial cloverleaf interchange in 2001 . 
 = = Future = = 
 I @-@ 81 is heavily congested within Maryland due to the 1960s era freeway being used as both a commuter route within a rapidly growing metropolitan area as well as a major trucking corridor . In 2010 , the highway had a minimum annual average daily traffic of 43 @,@ 771 between Showalter Road and PA 163 and a maximum of 62 @,@ 181 between Halfway Boulevard and US 40 . The Interstate is often used by long @-@ distance traffic as an alternative to I @-@ 95 to avoid traveling through the major cities of the East Coast . As a result , in 2001 the Maryland State Highway Administration began developing long @-@ term plans to upgrade the entire length of I @-@ 81 in Maryland . The state completed the planning process for the eventual upgrades to the Interstate highway in November 2010 ; the next step is preliminary engineering work . The state plans to expand I @-@ 81 to six lanes to address capacity concerns . In addition , many of the interchanges will be rebuilt to reduce or eliminate weaving . In particular : 
 The collector @-@ distributor lanes within the I @-@ 70 interchange would be extended north through the Halfway Boulevard interchange . 
 The US 40 and Showalter Road interchanges would be changed from a full cloverleaf interchange to a partial interchange by removing the two loop ramps from the crossroad onto I @-@ 81 . 
 The MD 58 interchange may be converted from a partial cloverleaf interchange to a diamond interchange . 
 The Maugans Avenue diamond interchange may have a loop ramp added from westbound Maugans Avenue to southbound I @-@ 81 . 
 At almost every interchange , acceleration and deceleration lanes would be lengthened to modern standards . The ramps within the I @-@ 70 interchange would be modified to better handle traffic passing between two freeways . Auxiliary lanes would be added in both directions between the US 40 and MD 58 interchanges , and southbound between the Showalter Road and Maugans Avenue interchanges . In addition , there is an option to construct a truck weigh station somewhere along I @-@ 81 within the state ; there are no weigh stations along either the Maryland or West Virginia segments of I @-@ 81 .

 = Tịnh Xá Trung Tâm = 
 Tịnh Xá Trung Tâm is a Buddhist temple in Ho Chi Minh City , the largest city in Vietnam . It was founded in 1965 and is the spiritual birthplace of the khất sĩ tradition of Vietnamese Buddhism that attempts to recreate the original tradition of the Buddhist sangha by walking barefoot and begging for alms . The temple is located at 7 Nguyễn Trung <unk> Street , in Bình <unk> District . It is known for its weekly <unk> Quan Trai <unk> ( Eight <unk> Ritual ) retreat , which is staged more frequently than at other institutions in the city , and has a reputation among its followers for rigour and discipline . The attendees of the temple are typically over 40 years of age and are overwhelmingly female . 
 The temple is set on a plot of 5 @,@ 490 square metres ( 59 @,@ 100 sq ft ) , and construction took ten years . Initially , the complex comprised two halls , two compounds for the sangha other buildings . The temple was the headquarters of the Vietnamese khất sĩ Sangha Association until 1980 . In 1998 , an octagonal nine @-@ story tower , named the Buddha Gem Tower , was built . The tower is lit at night and is visible throughout the surrounding area . The bottom four floors form the library as well as the repository for some relics of Gautama Buddha . Many of the inner walls of the halls of the temple are adorned with relief carvings and paintings depicting important events in the life of Buddha . In the courtyard stands a statue of Avalokiteshvara bodhisattva .

 The founding patriarch of the khất sĩ tradition was Thích Minh <unk> Quang , who was born Nguyễn Thành <unk> in 1923 to a peasant family from the village of Phú Hậu , Bình Phú prefecture , Tam Bình District in Vĩnh Long Province in the Mekong Delta . He founded the tradition in 1944 with the vow " <unk> <unk> Thích @-@ ca <unk> <unk> <unk> Phật <unk> sĩ Việt Nam " ( Transmitting the correct dharma of Sakyamuni , <unk> sĩ Buddhism of Vietnam ) , which came to be the motto of the khất sĩ tradition . Although he disappeared in 1954 , his followers continued to expand and went on to open Tinh Xa Trung Tam . 
 = = Buildings and development = = 
 The temple is set on a plot of 5 @,@ 490 square metres ( 59 @,@ 100 sq ft ) ; construction of the building began in April 1965 and took ten years . The plot of land was donated by a Buddhist layperson named Nguyễn Văn <unk> . Initially , the complex comprised a main ceremonial hall , a patriarch hall , two compounds for the sangha and a set of huts for solitary religious practice . The temple was the headquarters of the khất sĩ Sangha Association from 1966 until 1980 . 
 In November 1980 , the abbot Thích Giác <unk> along with Thích Giác Phúc organised an expansion that involved the erection of a two @-@ storied compound that included the main ceremonial hall . The compound was built in an octagonal shape , as planned by the architect Nguyễn Hữu Thiện . The tower part of the compound is 4 @.@ 40 metres ( 14 @.@ 4 ft ) tall , with octagonal sides of length 2 @.@ 25 metres ( 7 @.@ 4 ft ) . At the top of the temple are 13 miniature levels , which represent the 13 realms of existence . The tower was constructed from wood , with lotuses depicted on the exterior walls . There are 12 paintings that depict various events in the life of Gautama Buddha , including the birth at Lumbini , the enlightenment at Bodh Gaya , the first dharma talk at Deer Park in Varanasi and the entering of nirvana at Kushinagar . Further parts of the wall display quotes from the <unk> written in Vietnamese . The entire artwork on and within the tower was the work of Thiện <unk> and his group of artists from the Art School of Long An . The artwork was created between 1982 and 1984 . The main lecture hall on the ground floor has wooden benches and can house several hundred people . A large statue of the patriarch Thich Minh Dang Quang stands at the front of the hall , in front of the wall paintings and a table on a platform where the speaking monk sit while giving a dharma talk . 
 The centrepiece of the main ceremonial hall on the second level is a statue of Gautama Buddha in the Buddha Hall . It is carved from wood , is 6 metres ( 20 ft ) tall , and is enclosed in a glass case . Also on this level is a ceramic statue depicting the birth of Prince Siddhartha . It depicts the traditional account of the prince taking seven steps , which resulted in seven lotuses blooming spontaneously , followed by Siddhartha pointing to the sky with his index finger and declaring that this life would be his last in samsara . On the internal wall of the temple are eight murals of the life of Gautama Buddha by Minh Dung and Hai Long . They are 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) high and carved into the wall . 
 There are two other chambers on the second floor . Behind the Buddha Hall is the patriarch 's alcove . The founder of any Vietnamese monastery is typically commemorated there , but in this case , Thích Minh <unk> Quang left no remains , so only his begging bowl and robe are present , protected by a glass enclosure . The bowl is smaller than usual and the robe is of a saffron @-@ dark orange colour . Buddhists often prostrate before the two objects , although as the glass enclosure and the Buddha statues in the main hall lie on the central symmetry axis of the building , they do so at an angle so that their posteriors are not pointing towards the statue of the Buddha . Behind the patriarch 's alcove is another chamber , the centre of which is a statue of the bodhisattva Ksitigarbha . Instead of being depicted with the typical staff with six rings around it — representing the six realms of existence — Ksitigarbha is shown with a " wish @-@ granting gem " . To either side of Ksitigarbha are photos of deceased monks and nuns . To the extreme left and right are photographs and names of deceased lay Buddhists , and their ashes are stored in urns below the altar . 
 In the front courtyard of the temple is a statue Avalokiteshvara bodhisattva , which stands 9 metres ( 30 ft ) , on a lotus seat 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) high . This is unusually high for an Avalokiteshvara statue in an outdoor courtyard . Before 1975 , the khất sĩ Sangha Association had around 300 temples in southern Vietnam , and the temple was the headquarters of the organization . 
 In 1998 , an octagonal nine @-@ story tower , named the Buddha Gem Tower , was built next to the Bodhi tree . It is 37 metres ( 121 ft ) high and has a symbolic Torch of Wisdom at the top , which is lit at night and is visible throughout the surrounding area . The bottom four floors form the library as well as the repository for some of the Buddha 's relics . The top five levels are used to enshrine the ashes of monks and nuns . 
 To the left of the gate is the bookstore , which is run by the lay disciples of the temple . Unlike many other Buddhist institutions , the publications are generally not free . The outlet offers journals published by the government @-@ run Buddhist media , as well as material written by Vietnamese monks , translations of canonical texts , works by internationally renowned Buddhist scholars , and audiovisual recordings of dharma talks by Vietnamese monks . It also sells images and statues of Gautama and Amitabha Buddha , and Avalokiteshvara . Next to the bookstore is the medical clinic , Tue Tinh Duong ( Tue Tinh Hall ) , named after a Trần Dynasty monk and herbal medicine practitioner who was famed for attending to the impoverished and compiling the first known book on Vietnamese herbal medicine . As is the case with medical clinics named in Tue Tinh 's honour , the services dispensed are complimentary . The outlet at Tinh Xa Trung Tam is the mendicant sect 's most active medical facility . 
 The Triple Gate ( Tam Quan ) is accessible by both pedestrians and vehicles . Two @-@ wheeled vehicles and pedestrians use the left and right wings respectively , and cars , buses , and trucks can use the central wing . The three gates represent emptiness , impermanence and middle @-@ view . It is decorated with sculptures and engravings of lotuses , lanterns and swastikas , all prominent symbols in Buddhism . On the left hand side of the grounds , there is a Bodhi tree , a symbol of the enlightenment of the Buddha . The tree is located in a concrete lotus , and around it are eight samsara @-@ wheel @-@ shaped signs that represent the Noble Eightfold Path . Signs with text explain each of the eight paths . 
 Aside from the two tower complexes , there is a reception office , administrative block , monastic quarters , meditation halls and a kitchen complex where lay supporters prepare meals for the monks and visitors . The monastic quarters and meditation hall are not open to laypeople and can provide accommodation for hundreds of monks . This large capacity is often utilised during the Rains Retreat . This retreat commemorates events during the life of the Buddha , when the rainy season came between the full moons of the fourth and seventh lunar months . As a result , monks of the time stayed in one place to practice rather than travel from place to place .

 As with other Buddhist temples in Ho Chi Minh City , rapid urban sprawl in the city has enveloped Tinh Xa Trung Tam and disturbed the serenity that existed when it was first constructed . The area surrounding Tinh Xa Trung Tam is now a noisy neighborhood , and most prominent among the sources of disturbances is a karaoke bar located on an alley leading to the temple . Due to overcrowding in the neighbourhood , joggers often use the monastery grounds , so a sign has been erected indicating " Ladies and gentlemen <unk> please follow this route " so that they circle the Dharma Tower in a clockwise direction , a path usually taken by Buddhists around stupas as an act of devotion . 
 In response to the growing noise , a sign has been placed at the gate to remind visitors — Buddhists and non @-@ Buddhists — about etiquette . It says that bicycles and motorcycles should be pushed into the yard with engines turned off . A policy of locking the halls when they are not in use has also been enacted to prevent homeless people from camping there . Some stray dogs have adopted Tịnh Xá Trung Tâm as their home and <unk> about during rituals ; they are fed vegetarian food . Although begging is not allowed inside the monastery grounds , it is allowed on the footpath outside the camp , and several handicapped people have made themselves a regular presence there .

 The monastery runs a fundraising program for cataract operations in the city , and receives wide support due to public suspicion of charities affiliated with the ruling Communist Party government , due to the communists ' strong reputation for rampant corruption . Following the fall of Saigon and the communist takeover , religious bodies were required to be registered with and loyal to the party . The <unk> si complied and became one of the nine schools within the state @-@ sanctioned Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation . However , the temple does not fly the national flag , and the only government material or symbols on display within Tịnh Xá Trung Tâm are letters of congratulations for charity initiatives . 
 = = Demographics and activities = = 
 The lay attendees at Tinh Xa Trung Tam are predominantly female by a ratio of around 5 to 1 , and most of the temple @-@ goers are over 40 . Most of the younger lay disciples are relatives of regular , older attendees . In addition to local residents , who make up the bulk of the disciples , some are from other parts of Vietnam , as well as overseas Vietnamese who are temporarily in the country . According to the American professor of Vietnamese history and religion Mark W. McLeod , who did fieldwork at Tịnh Xá Trung Tâm , he did not survey the laypeople about their income , for fear of embarrassing them , but conjectured that most had an above average income as they were able to devote a considerable amount of time to organized religious activity instead of working longer hours . A regular occurrence at the temple is the weekly <unk> Quan Trai <unk> ( Eight Precepts Ritual ) . As part of this , the participants take on three additional vows apart from the Five Precepts and stay at the temple for a 24 @-@ hour period . These vows prohibit adornments such as makeup and jewellery , the use of comfortable beds and chairs , and eating <unk> . During the retreat day , meals are taken in silence and talking is avoided , apart from during dharma talks , sutra chanting and religious debate . Meditation is also a part of the routine . Tinh Xa Trung Tam holds the Eight Precepts Ritual more often than any other institution in the city ; the next most frequent temple holds the retreat once every two weeks . Dharma talks are held weekly by the resident monks and nuns , which is generally more frequent than at other places in the city . The disciples and monks at the temple told McLeod that they chose Tinh Xa Trung Tam because of what they regarded as a higher level of discipline , rigor and scholarship at the institution . The monks are transported by their disciples as they are forbidden to drive . 
 The founder of khất sĩ had been a supporter of freeing birds as an act of compassion , and this has been continued by some monks and lay people as it is believed to be meritorious , but others have spoken out against on the grounds that the demand for birds used for such ceremonies merely prompt more people to capture them in the first place . 
 According to the scholar Mark McLeod , the temple incorporated aspects of both Mahayana and Theravada traditions in its style of practice and architecture . He felt that the modest and uncomplicated wooden statue of the Buddha is more reminiscent of Theravada architecture , while the Ksitigarbha and Avalokiteshvara statues are distinctly Mahayana , as these figures are absent from Theravada teachings . One monk interviewed by McLeod said that his temple 's interpretation of Buddhism and its inclusiveness of Mahayana and Theravada aspects is " like a tree , which needs roots , a trunk , branches , and leaves ; it cannot survive if any is missing . " He added that the appropriateness of a teaching , practice , symbol , is independent of its origin , but is determined by " whether or not it accords with the Buddha 's Teachings . " 
 = Brad McCrimmon = 
 Byron Brad McCrimmon ( March 29 , 1959 – September 7 , 2011 ) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman and coach . He played over 1 @,@ 200 games in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) for the Boston Bruins , Philadelphia Flyers , Calgary Flames , Detroit Red Wings , Hartford Whalers and Phoenix Coyotes between 1979 and 1997 . He achieved his greatest success in Calgary , where he was named a second team All @-@ Star in 1987 – 88 , played in the 1988 NHL All @-@ Star Game and won the Plus @-@ Minus Award with a league leading total of + 48 . In 1989 , he helped the Flames win their first Stanley Cup championship . His career plus @-@ minus of + 444 is one of the highest totals in NHL history . 
 McCrimmon turned to coaching following his playing career , serving as an assistant with the New York Islanders before taking over as head coach of the Western Hockey League 's Saskatoon Blades for two seasons between 1998 and 2000 . He then returned to the NHL as an assistant , first with the Flames then the Atlanta Thrashers and finally the Red Wings . He left the NHL to become the head coach of Lokomotiv Yaroslavl of the Kontinental Hockey League ( KHL ) in 2011 . He never coached a regular season game however , as he was killed in the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl air disaster along with most of the team after their plane crashed en route to their first game .

 = = = Junior = = = 
 McCrimmon began his junior career at the age of 15 with the Prince Albert Raiders of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League ( SJHL ) . He played two seasons with the team , scoring 23 goals and 84 points . In his second season , 1975 – 76 , he was named the SJHL 's defenceman of the year . For the 1976 – 77 season , he moved up to the Brandon Wheat Kings of the Western Canada Hockey League ( WCHL ) . He scored 84 points in 72 games in his first WCHL season and added 13 points in 15 playoff games as the Wheat Kings reached the league championship series , only to lose to the New Westminster Bruins . McCrimmon scored 97 points in 1977 – 78 and 98 in 1978 – 79 . He was named the defenceman of the year in 1978 and was named to the league all @-@ star team in both seasons . He also joined the Canadian junior team at the World Junior Championship in each season . He recorded two assists in six games to help Canada win a bronze medal at the 1978 tournament and had three points in five games in 1979 though Canada failed to medal . 
 With McCrimmon as team captain , the Wheat Kings again reached the league championship in 1978 – 79 . He scored 28 points in 22 games to help Brandon win the President 's Cup . The team advanced to the 1979 Memorial Cup tournament where it reached the final against the Ontario Hockey League champion Peterborough Petes . McCrimmon routinely played a high number of minutes each game ; his teammates marveled at his stamina . In the Memorial Cup final , he played virtually every minute of the contest . His total ice time was 60 minutes , 38 seconds , and he was off the ice only to serve a two @-@ minute penalty . Peterborough won the game , 2 – 1 in overtime , after McCrimmon lost the puck on a play he thought was icing was not called . Peterborough 's Terry <unk> stole the puck from him and scored the championship winning goal . Despite the loss , McCrimmon was named a tournament all @-@ star on defence . 
 = = = Professional = = = 
 At the 1979 NHL Entry Draft , considered one of the deepest in league history , McCrimmon was selected 15th overall by the Boston Bruins . He made his NHL debut on October 11 , 1979 , in the team 's opening night victory over the Winnipeg Jets . He scored 5 goals and 16 points in his rookie season of 1979 – 80 and improved to 11 goals and 29 points in his second season . With only nine points in the 1981 – 82 season , McCrimmon had gained a reputation as a player who did not attack with the puck in the NHL . Following the retirement of <unk> Vachon , the Bruins needed a new goaltender . They sent McCrimmon to the Philadelphia Flyers in exchange for Pete Peeters on June 9 , 1982 . 
 Flyers ' coach Bob McCammon argued that McCrimmon had been " intimidated " by playing with fellow 1979 Bruins pick and all @-@ star , Ray Bourque , and that he could be a better overall defenceman . McCrimmon 's offence improved in his first two seasons in Philadelphia – 25 points in 1982 – 83 and 24 , though without a goal scored , in 1983 – 84 – but he established himself as a top shutdown defenceman with the Flyers . He recorded 43 points in 1984 – 85 and posted a plus @-@ minus rating of + 52 , fifth best in the NHL . McCrimmon was ruled out of the 1985 Stanley Cup Playoffs in the third game of the league semi @-@ final against the Quebec Nordiques when he suffered a third @-@ degree separation of his left shoulder following a hard hit by Wilf Paiement , an injury that required surgery to repair . The Flyers reached the final without McCrimmon , but were defeated by the Edmonton Oilers for the Stanley Cup . McCrimmon returned to start the 1985 – 86 season , in which he had his best season statistically . He appeared in all 80 games for the Flyers and set career highs of 13 goals , 43 assists , 56 points and his plus @-@ minus rating of + 83 was second only to defensive partner Mark Howe . He was named recipient of the Barry Ashbee Trophy as the Flyers ' top defenceman . 
 McCrimmon and the Flyers became embroiled in a contract dispute prior to the 1986 – 87 season . The two sides were unable to agree on a contract the season before , and an arbitrator was required to resolve the impasse . The arbitrator sided with the team , setting a contract at the Flyers ' offer of US $ 165 @,@ 000 for that season ( he asked for $ 200 @,@ 000 ) , with an option to extend the deal for 1986 – 87 . The Flyers exercised that option , and though he admitted he was under contract for the season , McCrimmon refused to play unless a new deal was reached . When the two sides were unable to come to an agreement , McCrimmon went home to Saskatchewan as the season began . The Flyers suspended McCrimmon on September 26 , 1986 , after he refused to appear in the first exhibition games . The impasse was not resolved until a month later , when he and the team agreed to a one @-@ year contract on October 29 . He immediately returned to the team and appeared in 72 of the Flyers ' 80 games , recording 22 points and finishing fourth in the league at + 45 . In the 1987 Stanley Cup Playoffs , he appeared in all 26 post @-@ season games as the Flyers again reached the final against Edmonton . McCrimmon scored the overtime winner in game 3 of the final , but the Oilers won the series . 
 Following the season , general manager Bobby Clarke refused to sign a new deal with McCrimmon , choosing instead to trade him . He was sent to the Calgary Flames on August 27 , 1987 , in exchange for a third round selection at the 1988 NHL Entry Draft and a first rounder at the 1989 Draft . On the 1987 – 88 Flames , McCrimmon joined Al MacInnis , Paul Reinhart , Gary Suter and Ric <unk> to form one of the top defences in the NHL . He scored 42 points for the Flames , won the NHL Plus @-@ Minus Award with a league @-@ leading + 48 and was named a second team All @-@ Star . Additionally , he played in the 1988 All @-@ Star Game . 
 McCrimmon recorded only 22 points in 1988 – 89 – his lowest in seven seasons – but led all NHL defencemen with a + 43 rating . He appeared in all 22 playoff games for the Flames as the team defeated the Montreal Canadiens to win the first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history . McCrimmon was named the 10th captain in Flames history on November 3 , 1989 , succeeding Lanny McDonald and Jim Peplinski , who both retired following the Stanley Cup win . He scored 4 goals and 19 points during the 1989 – 90 season , but fell out of favour with head coach Terry Crisp as the two disagreed over how the team 's defencemen were used . The Flames chose to trade him following the season , sending him to the Detroit Red Wings on June 15 , 1990 , in exchange for a second round draft pick . 
 In 1991 – 92 , McCrimmon was paired with a young Nicklas Lidström . Though he focused on defence , allowing Lidström to be more creative offensively , McCrimmon 's 29 points were a significant improvement on the 13 he scored the season before . He played one more season in Detroit before again being traded , this time to the Hartford Whalers on June 1 , 1993 , in exchange for a sixth round draft pick . In Hartford , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old McCrimmon served as a mentor for 18 @-@ year @-@ old Chris Pronger . Offensively , he scored 16 points total in three seasons with the Whalers between 1993 and 1996 . Leaving the team as a free agent , McCrimmon signed with the Phoenix Coyotes for the 1996 – 97 season . He appeared in 37 games that season , scoring one goal and adding five assists . Following the season , he announced his retirement . 
 McCrimmon was paired with some of the best defencemen of his generation . In addition to Lidstrom and Pronger , he played with Hockey Hall of Famers Ray Bourque , Mark Howe and Paul Coffey . He was known as a stay at home defenceman who focused on limiting the opposition 's chances . He played a physical game , often in the " dirty " areas of the ice – battling opponents in the corners and in front of the net . McCrimmon 's career plus @-@ minus was + 444 , a total surpassed by only nine players as of 2012 . Brian Propp , a teammate of his in Philadelphia , said that he was one of the most underrated defencemen of his time . 
 = = Coaching career = = 
 McCrimmon moved behind the bench shortly after his retirement , joining the New York Islanders as an assistant coach to Mike Milbury on August 19 , 1997 . He left the team after two years to become head coach of the Saskatoon Blades of the Western Hockey League in 1999 . In two seasons with the team , he coached 144 games , winning 50 and tying 15 . McCrimmon coached the Blades to a second @-@ place finish in the East Division in 1999 – 2000 and a seven @-@ game opening round playoff victory over the Regina Pats before the team was eliminated by the Calgary Hitmen . 
 Returning to the NHL in 2000 , McCrimmon joined the Calgary Flames as an assistant to Don Hay . He remained with the team for two and a half seasons , serving under both Hay and successor Greg Gilbert until the team replaced its coaching staff on December 3 , 2002 . He returned to the NHL in 2004 as an assistant for the Atlanta Thrashers . He was promoted to associate coach in his fourth season when team general manager Don Waddell fired head coach Bob Hartley during the 2007 – 08 season . McCrimmon had been offered the Thrashers head coaching position after Waddell 's dismissal , but turned it down after the team failed to guarantee he would retain the position beyond the end of the season . Leaving the Thrashers , McCrimmon signed a three @-@ year contract with the Detroit Red Wings in 2008 to serve as an assistant coach . 
 Looking to further his career , he left Detroit on May 19 , 2011 , and was introduced as head coach of Lokomotiv Yaroslavl of the Kontinental Hockey League ( KHL ) on May 29 . He hoped that coaching the Russian club would help him land an NHL head coaching position in the future . He never coached a game for Lokomotiv , as on September 7 , 2011 , the team 's plane crashed on take off en route to their first game of the season . McCrimmon died along with nearly his entire team .

 McCrimmon was born in <unk> , Saskatchewan , but grew up on the family farm near the village of Plenty . He often returned to his hometown during his playing days , spending his summers training on the family farm . He brought the Stanley Cup back to Plenty in 1989 after winning it with the Flames , fulfilling a promise McCrimmon made to his grandfather as a youth . 
 Hockey was a significant part of McCrimmon 's life from his youth . His father Byron was a long time senior player and coach for the Rosetown Red Wings in Saskatchewan . The younger McCrimmon played for teams in both Plenty and Rosetown at the same time , often appearing on teams one level above his age . His younger brother Kelly is the owner and general manager of the Brandon Wheat Kings , with whom they played together as teammates in 1978 – 79 . 
 Nicknamed both " Beast " and " Sarge " , McCrimmon was often considered " gruff " and had a direct way of speaking that cultivated respect amongst his peers . According to former teammate Lanny McDonald : " He was tough , he was abrasive , but on the inside he was a big teddy bear , a big softie . " McCrimmon 's brother remembered him as a person who dedicated himself to his family . Brad had two children with his wife Maureen : daughter Carlin and son Liam .

 = Lyme Park = 
 Lyme Park is a large estate located south of Disley , Cheshire . The estate is managed by the National Trust and consists of a mansion house surrounded by formal gardens , in a deer park in the Peak District National Park . The house is the largest in Cheshire , and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building . 
 The estate was granted to Sir Thomas Danyers in 1346 and passed to the Leghs of Lyme by marriage in 1388 . It remained in the possession of the Legh family until 1946 when it was given to the National Trust . The house dates from the latter part of the 16th century . Modifications were made to it in the 1720s by Giacomo Leoni , who retained some of the Elizabethan features and added others , particularly the courtyard and the south range . It is difficult to classify Leoni 's work at Lyme , as it contains elements of both Palladian and Baroque styles . Further modifications were made by Lewis Wyatt in the 19th century , especially to the interior . Formal gardens were created and developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . The house , gardens and park have been used as locations for filming and they are open to the public . The Lyme Caxton Missal is on display in the Library . 
 = = History = = 
 The land now occupied by Lyme Park was granted to Piers Legh and his wife Margaret D 'anyers , by letters patent dated January 4 , 1398 , by Richard II , son of the Black Prince . Margaret D 'anyers ' grandfather , Sir Thomas D 'anyers , had taken part in retrieving the standard of the Black Prince at the Battle of Crécy in 1346 , and was rewarded with annuity of 40 marks a year by the Black Prince , drawn on his Cheshire estate , and which could be exchanged for land of that value belonging to the Black Prince . Sir Thomas died in 1354 , and the annuity passed to his nearest surviving kin , his granddaughter Margaret , who in 1388 married the first Piers Legh ( Piers Legh I ) . Richard II favoured Piers and granted his family a coat of arms in 1397 , and the estate of Lyme Handley in 1398 redeeming the annuity . However , Piers was executed two years later by Richard 's rival for the throne , Henry Bolingbroke . 
 When in 1415 Sir Piers Legh II was wounded in the Battle of Agincourt , his mastiff stood over and protected him for many hours through the battle . The mastiff was later returned to Legh 's home and was the foundation of the Lyme Hall Mastiffs . They were bred at the hall and kept separate from other strains , figuring prominently in founding the modern breed . The strain died out around the beginning of the 20th century . 
 The first record of a house on the site is in a manuscript folio dated 1465 , but that house was demolished when construction of the present building began during the life of Piers Legh VII , in the middle of the 16th century . This house , by an unknown designer , was L @-@ shaped in plan with east and north ranges ; piecemeal additions were made to it during the 17th century . In the 1720s Giacomo Leoni , an architect from Venice , added a south range to the house creating a courtyard plan , and made other changes . While he retained some of its Elizabethan features , many of his changes were in a mixture of Palladian and Baroque styles . During the latter part of the 18th century Piers Legh XIII bought most of the furniture which is in the house today . However , the family fortunes declined and the house began to deteriorate . In the early 19th century the estate was owned by Thomas Legh , who commissioned Lewis Wyatt to restore the house between 1816 and 1822 . Wyatt 's alterations were mainly to the interior , where he remodelled every room . Leoni had intended to add a cupola to the south range but this never materialised . Instead , Wyatt added a tower @-@ like structure ( a hamper ) to provide bedrooms for the servants . He also added a one @-@ storey block to the east range , containing a dining @-@ room . Later in the century William Legh , 1st Baron Newton , added stables and other buildings to the estate , and created the Dutch Garden . Further alterations were made to the gardens by Thomas Legh , 2nd Baron Newton and his wife during the early 20th century . In 1946 Richard Legh , 3rd Baron Newton , gave Lyme Park to the National Trust .

 = = = Exterior = = = 
 The house is the largest in Cheshire , measuring overall 190 feet ( 58 m ) by 130 feet ( 40 m ) round a courtyard plan . The older part is built in coursed , squared buff sandstone rubble with sandstone dressings ; the later work is in ashlar sandstone . The whole house has a roof of Welsh slates . The symmetrical north face is of 15 bays in three storeys ; its central bay consists of a slightly protruding gateway . The arched doorway in this bay has Doric columns with a niche on each side . Above the doorway are three more Doric columns with a pediment , and above this are three further columns . Over all this are four further columns with an open pediment bearing an image of Minerva . The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner referred to this gateway as " the craziest Elizabethan frontispiece " . The endmost three bays on each side project slightly forwards . The ground floors of the three outer bays on each side are rusticated , and their upper storeys are divided by large Corinthian pilasters . The west front is also in three storeys , with nine bays , the outer two bays on each side projecting forward . The ground floor is rusticated and the upper floors are smooth . 
 The symmetrical 15 @-@ bay three @-@ storey south front overlooking the pond is the work of Leoni . Although Leoni had been influenced by the works and principles of Palladio , both Pevsner and the authors of the citation in the National Heritage List for England agree that the design of this front is more Baroque than Palladian . The bottom storey is rusticated with arched windows , and the other storeys are smooth with rectangular windows . The middle three bays consist of a portico of which the lowest storey has three arches . Above this arise four giant fluted Ionic columns supporting a triangular pediment . Standing on the pediment are three lead statues , of Neptune , Venus and Pan . The pediment partly hides Wyatt 's blind balustraded ashlar attic block . The other bays are separated by plain Ionic pilasters and the end three bays on each side protrude slightly . The nine @-@ bay three @-@ storey east front is mostly Elizabethan in style and has Wyatt 's single @-@ storey extension protruding from its centre . The courtyard was remodelled by Leoni , who gave it a rusticated cloister on all sides . Above the cloister the architecture differs on the four sides although all the windows on the first ( piano nobile ) floor have pediments . On the west side is a one @-@ bay centrepiece with a window between two Doric pilasters ; on the south and north are three windows with four similar pilasters ; and on the east front is the grand entrance with a portal in a Tuscan aedicule . This entrance is between the first and second storeys and is approached by symmetrical pairs of stairs with iron balusters , which were made in 1734 by John <unk> of Baslow , Derbyshire . In the centre of the courtyard is an Italian Renaissance well @-@ head , surrounded by chequered pink and white stone , simulating marble . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The Entrance Hall , which is in the east range , was remodelled by Leoni . It is asymmetrical and contains giant pilasters and a screen of three fluted Ionic columns . The doorway to the courtyard has an open pediment . A hinged picture can be swung out from the wall to reveal a squint looking into the Entrance Hall . Also in the Entrance Hall are tapestries which were woven at Mortlake between 1623 and 1636 . They were originally in the Leghs ' London home in Belgrave Square and were moved to Lyme in 1903 . In order to accommodate them , the interior decorator , <unk> Joubert , had to make alterations , including the removal of a tabernacle and cutting out four of the pilasters . To the south of the Entrance Hall is the Library , and to the east is Wyatt 's Dining Room , which has a stucco ceiling and a carved overmantel both in a late 17th @-@ century style , as well as a frieze . The decoration of this room is considered to be a rare early example of the <unk> style . 
 To the north of the Entrance Hall are the two principal Elizabethan rooms , the Drawing Room and the Stag Parlour . The Drawing Room is panelled with intersecting arches above which is a marquetry frieze . The ceiling has studded bands , strapwork cartouches and a broad frieze . Over the fireplace is a large stone overmantel , which is decorated with pairs of <unk> and caryatids framing the arms of Elizabeth I. The stained glass in this room includes medieval glass that was moved from the original Lyme Hall to Disley Church and returned to Lyme in 1835 . The Stag Parlour has a chimneypiece depicting an Elizabethan house and hunting scenes , and it includes the arms of James I. The other Elizabethan rooms in the house are the Stone Parlour on the ground floor , and the Long Gallery , which is on the top floor of the east range . The Long Gallery also has a chimneypiece with the arms of Elizabeth I. The Grand Staircase dates from the remodelling by Leoni and it has a Baroque ceiling . The Saloon is on the first floor of the south range , behind the portico . Its ceiling is decorated in rococo style , and the room contains wooden carvings that have been attributed to Grinling Gibbons . The Chapel , in the northeast corner of the ground floor , also contains detailed carvings .

 This missal had been owned by the Legh family since at least 1508 . It is the only known nearly complete copy of the earliest edition of a missal according to the Sarum Rite still in existence . When the family moved from the house in 1946 , the missal went with them , and was held for safe @-@ keeping in the John Rylands Library in Manchester . In the late 2000s the National Trust acquired it , and it was decided to return it to Lyme Park . To celebrate this the décor of the library was restored to the way it had been during the 19th century . This included re @-@ graining of its ceiling , reproducing velvet for the upholstery and curtains , and re @-@ <unk> the room with replica wallpaper , based on its original design . 
 = = Grounds = = 
 The house is surrounded by formal gardens of 6 hectares ( 15 acres ) in a deer park of about 550 hectares ( 1 @,@ 359 acres ) which are listed at Grade II * in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens . In the gardens and deer park are a number of structures .

 To the west of the house is the former mill pond . From the south side a lawn slopes down to another pond beyond which is a small ravine with a stone bridge , this area being known as <unk> . To the west of the lawn is the sunken Dutch Garden , which was created by William Legh . It consists of formal flower beds with a central fountain . To the west , south and east of the orangery are further formal flower gardens , including rose gardens . 
 = = = Deer park = = = 
 The park was enclosed in the 14th century by Piers Legh I. In the 17th century Richard Legh planted avenues of sycamore and lime trees . Richard 's son , Peter Legh XII carried out more extensive tree @-@ planting in the park , giving it its current appearance . Red deer descended from the original deer present when the park was enclosed graze in the grounds , as do Highland cattle . Formerly an unusual breed of wild white cattle with red ears grazed in the park but they became extinct in 1884 . Fallow deer and sheep also graze in the park . 
 = = = Structures = = = 
 The most obvious structure in the park , other than the house , is a tower called the Cage which stands on a hill to the east of the approach road to the house ( 53 @.@ <unk> ° N 2 @.@ <unk> ° W ﻿ / 53 @.@ <unk> ; <unk> ) . It was originally a hunting lodge and was later used as a park @-@ keeper 's cottage and as a lock @-@ up for prisoners . The first structure on the site was built about 1580 ; this was taken down and rebuilt in 1737 , possibly to a design by Leoni for Peter Legh X. The tower is built in buff sandstone rubble with ashlar sandstone dressings . It is square in plan , in three storeys , with attached small square towers surmounted by cupolas at the corners . The Cage is a Grade II * listed building . Also in the park is the Paddock Cottage which was erected by Peter Legh IX and restored in the early 21st century . To the east of this are the remains of the Stag House ( 53 @.@ <unk> ° N 2 @.@ <unk> ° W ﻿ / 53 @.@ <unk> ; <unk> ) . To the left of the house in Lantern Wood is a belvedere known as the Lantern ( 53 @.@ <unk> ° N 2 @.@ <unk> ° W ﻿ / 53 @.@ <unk> ; <unk> ) . It is built in sandstone and has three storeys and a spire ; the lowest storey is square in plan while the other storeys and the spire are octagonal . The top storey and spire date from about 1580 and originally formed a bellcote on the north gatehouse . This was removed during the restoration of the house by Wyatt and rebuilt on the present site . It is a Grade II * listed building . 
 Immediately to the northeast of the house is the Orangery which was designed in 1862 by Alfred Darbyshire . The Orangery is joined to the house by a covered passage known as the Dark Passage . This was designed by Wyatt for Sir Thomas Legh in 1815 and is a Grade II listed building . Further from the house , to the northeast of the orangery , are the stables ( 53 @.@ <unk> ° N 2 @.@ <unk> ° W ﻿ / 53 @.@ <unk> ; <unk> ) . These are dated 1863 and were also designed by Darbyshire . They are built in sandstone on a courtyard plan and are listed at Grade II . Other structures in the grounds listed at Grade II are the Pheasant House dating from about 1870 , an Italian white marble wellhead in the centre of the courtyard of the house dating from the 18th century and probably brought to the house from Venice in about 1900 , sandstone kennels in an H @-@ plan dating from around 1870 , a pair of gardener 's cottages dated 1871 , terrace revetment walls to the west of the house containing some 17th @-@ century masonry with later repairs , the lodge , gate piers and gates on Lyme Park Drive , the forward gatepiers to Lyme Park Drive , dating from the late 17th century and moved to their present position about 1860 , the gate piers in Red Lane , and the gate piers , gates and railings to the north of the north front of the house .

The exterior of the hall was used as Pemberley , the seat of Mr Darcy , in the 1995 BBC adaptation of Jane Austen 's novel Pride and Prejudice , and as a location for the Red Dwarf episode " Timeslides " . It was also used as a location in the 2011 film The Awakening and in the second series of The Village in 2014 . 
 = The Lady 's Realm = 
 The Lady 's Realm was a British women 's magazine published from 1896 until 1914 , possibly until 1915 . It primarily targeted upper @-@ class readers as well as an aspirational middle @-@ class audience , featuring photographs , poems , fiction , and columns by popular authors such as Marie Corelli , Frances Hodgson Burnett , Jack London , and H.G. Wells . The London Season was regularly covered , with visuals of significant society figures and débutantes appearing . Fashion trends in Paris and London were frequently discussed as well , particularly by its fashion editor Marian Pritchard . 
 The publication 's targeted reader was the " New Woman " , with enlightened ideas on education , health , independence , and employment . More successful than many of its contemporary publications , the magazine sold reasonably well in the United States , United Kingdom , and Canada . It was a staple of women 's reading rooms in public libraries , which were widespread across the UK . Relatively little is known of The Lady 's Realm 's publishing history , as many records were destroyed during the London Blitz . Its end may have been due to the First World War .

 Relatively little is known of The Lady 's Realm 's publishing history , as many records of its publisher , Hutchinson , were destroyed during the London Blitz . The first issue was published in November 1896 . Its first editor was William Henry Wilkins , a mildly successful novelist who oversaw the publication 's editing from 1896 to 1902 . Though inexperienced , Wilkins was acquainted with society , being a friend of such figures as the explorer Richard Francis Burton and his wife Isabel Burton . After Wilkins ' death in 1905 , The Lady 's Realm wrote of how " the general public are little aware how much of [ the magazine 's ] early success " was due to him , and that " not a few [ contributors who ] have since made their names in the world of letters have to thank him for placing their foot on the first rung of the ladder " . Wilkins ' successor as editor is unknown , though Margaret Versteeg and colleagues , who produced an index of the fiction published in The Lady 's Realm , detect no changes in editorial judgement in the magazine 's tenure after 1902 . While the publication mainly featured women writers and feminine topics , all of its editors , most likely , were men . 
 When it debuted , there were more than twenty @-@ nine publications catering to women . Upon the publication of its first issue in 1896 , Review of Reviews called it " one of the most popular of the magazines that have been started this year " . The illustrated magazine was produced monthly and cost sixpence ( cheap enough for middle @-@ class readers ) . A typical issue contained 120 pages on quality glossy paper . It sold reasonably well in the United Kingdom , United States , and Canada . The magazine was available in women 's reading rooms in public libraries , locations that were well distributed across the United Kingdom . 
 The magazine was produced by the English printers Hazell , Watson and Viney . One of its owners , Walter Hazell , was a social reformer and supporter of women 's suffrage . A successful firm , Hazell , Watson and Viney also produced the Woman 's Signal and the Woman 's Gazette , which featured female political and economic topics . The success of The Lady 's Realm allowed it to remain published for eighteen years , from 1896 to 1915 , much longer than many other contemporary women 's periodicals . Thirty @-@ six volumes were produced , from November 1896 to October 1914 ( a final volume may have been released in 1915 ) . It is not known why it ended , though Versteeg and her colleagues speculate that World War I may have been a cause , as was the case for other contemporary publications like Young Woman ( 1891 – 1914 ) and The Girl ’ s Realm ( 1892 – 1915 ) .

 The magazine focused on an upmarket audience , targeting " aspirational middle @-@ class and upper @-@ class readers " . It was also one of the first intended to appeal to the female homeowner . The Lady 's Realm featured poems , engravings and photographs , as well as columns by popular authors like Marie Corelli , Frances Hodgson Burnett , Violet Fane , and Mary Elizabeth Braddon . Other authors included Jack London , H.G. Wells , and Mary Eleanor Wilkins Freeman . Fiction , in the form of short stories and serialisations , was released during the magazine 's entire span and took up a sizable proportion in issues . A slightly higher percentage of these contributions were written by women . The type of fiction varied , from romances and domestic narratives to fantasies and sociopolitical stories . The publication 's targeted reader was the " New Woman " , with enlightened ideas on education , health , independence , and employment . Victorian scholar Kathryn Ledbetter notes that The Lady 's Realm was " a handbook to the New Woman then being successfully marketed in popular novels ... it provides many examples of this ideal in essays , illustrations , fiction , and poetry through the late 1890s " . 
 Lady 's Realm printed an assortment of Court and society news alongside articles on more daily tasks such as food , homemaking , and methods for female readers to earn money . It covered the London Season , displaying photographs of significant society figures and débutantes . It claimed to feature over 500 illustrations in each volume . Theatre was another regular topic of the magazine 's , as was fiction , poetry , and reports on fashion . The Lady 's Realm 's fashion editor Marian Pritchard regularly wrote articles on emerging fashions in London and Paris , and recommended locations where readers could buy them . While still featuring fashion and beauty , it also encouraged careers for women in music , art , business , and millinery . The magazine maintained this blend of topics relatively consistently , though it gradually made minor changes to the proportion it focused on different topics , for instance later focusing less on the nobility and more on the lives of clergymen and governors general . 
 The Lady 's Realm was a source of celebrity journalism . Ledbetter writes that the magazine inherited its " notions of feminine celebrity " from The Woman 's World , an earlier publication edited by Oscar Wilde . It published studio photographs of actresses as well as aristocrats , including many in the former group who married into the nobility . The British Royal Family was a frequent subject ; one of the magazine 's first issues included an article and photographs about the Princess of Wales ' childhood , and the publication regularly reported on the movements of Queen Victoria 's family . 
 = Ultima Underworld : The Stygian Abyss = 
 Ultima Underworld : The Stygian Abyss is a first @-@ person role @-@ playing video game ( RPG ) developed by Blue Sky Productions ( later Looking Glass Studios ) and published by Origin Systems . Released in March 1992 , the game is set in the fantasy world of the Ultima series . It takes place inside the Great Stygian Abyss : a large , underground cave system that contains the remnants of a failed utopian civilization . The player assumes the role of the Avatar — the Ultima series ' protagonist — and attempts to find and rescue a baron 's kidnapped daughter . 
 Ultima Underworld has been cited as the first role @-@ playing game to feature first @-@ person action in a 3D environment , and it introduced technological innovations such as allowing the player to look up and down . Its design combines simulation elements with concepts from earlier CRPGs , including Wizardry and Dungeon Master , which led the game 's designers to call it a " dungeon simulation " . As such , the game is non @-@ linear and allows for emergent gameplay . 
 Ultima Underworld received widespread critical acclaim and sold nearly 500 @,@ 000 units . The game was later placed on numerous hall of fame lists . It influenced game developers such as Bethesda Softworks and Valve Corporation , and it was an inspiration behind the games Deus Ex and BioShock . The game had a sequel , Ultima Underworld II : Labyrinth of Worlds ( 1993 ) , and a new game in the series , Underworld Ascendant , is forthcoming . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Ultima Underworld is a role @-@ playing video game ( RPG ) that takes place from a first @-@ person perspective in a three @-@ dimensional environment . The player 's goal is to adventure through a large , multi @-@ level dungeon , in which the entire game is set . The player uses a freely movable mouse cursor to interact with the game 's world , and with the icon @-@ based interface on the heads @-@ up display ( HUD ) . Each icon has a specific effect ; for example , the Look icon allows the player to examine objects closely , while the Fight icon causes the player character to ready its weapon . The player 's progression through the game is non @-@ linear : areas may be explored , and puzzles and quests finished , in any order . An automatically filling map , to which the player may add notes , records what the player has seen above a minimum level of brightness . The player character may carry light sources to extend the line of sight in varying amounts . Exploratory actions include looking up and down , jumping , and swimming . 
 The player begins the game by creating a character , for whom traits such as gender , class and skills may be selected . Skills range from fighting with an axe , to bartering , to picking locks . By participating in combat , quests and exploration , the character gains experience points . When certain amounts of experience points are accumulated , the character levels up , gaining additional hit points and mana . Experience also allows the player to recite mantras at shrines in the game . Each mantra is a statement — such as " Om <unk> " — that increases proficiency in a specific skill when typed . Simple mantras are provided in the game 's manual , while more complex ones are hidden throughout the game . An inventory on the HUD lists the items and weapons currently carried by the player character ; capacity is limited by weight . Players equip items via a paper doll system , wherein items are clicked @-@ and @-@ dragged onto a representation of the player character . 
 Combat occurs in real @-@ time , and the player character may use both melee and ranged weapons . The player attacks by holding the cursor over the game screen and clicking , depressing the button longer to inflict greater damage . Some weapons allow for different types of attacks depending on where the cursor is held ; for example , clicking near the bottom of the screen may result in a jab , while clicking in the middle produces a slash . Simulated dice rolls occur behind the scenes to determine weapon accuracy . Enemies sometimes try to escape when near death , and the game 's stealth mechanics may occasionally be used to avoid combat altogether . The player may cast spells by selecting an appropriate combination of runestones . Like mantras , runestones must be found in the game world before use . There are over forty spells , some undocumented ; their effects range from causing earthquakes to allowing the player character to fly . 
 The developers intended Ultima Underworld to be a realistic and interactive " dungeon simulation " , rather than a straightforward role @-@ playing game . For example , many objects in the game have no actual use , while a lit torch may be used on corn to create popcorn . Weapons deteriorate with use , and the player character must eat and rest ; light sources burn out unless extinguished before sleeping . A physics system allows , among other things , for items to bounce when thrown against surfaces . The game contains non @-@ player characters ( NPCs ) with whom the player may interact by selecting dialogue choices from a menu . Most NPCs have possessions , and are willing to trade them . The game was designed to give players " a palette of strategies " with which to approach situations , and its simulation systems allow for emergent gameplay . 
 = = Plot = = 
 = = = Setting = = = 
 Ultima Underworld is set in Britannia , the fantasy world of the Ultima series . Specifically , the game takes place inside a large , underground dungeon called the Great Stygian Abyss . The dungeon 's entrance lies on the Isle of the Avatar , an island ruled by Baron Almric . The Abyss first appeared in Ultima IV : Quest of the Avatar , in which it contains the player 's final goal , the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom . 
 Ultima Underworld is set after the events of Ultima VI : The False Prophet ; in the time between the two games , a man named Cabirus attempted to create a utopian colony inside the Abyss . The eight settlements of the Ultima series each embody one of eight virtues , and Cabirus wished to create a ninth that embodied all virtues . To achieve this , he united diverse cultures and races in peaceful co @-@ existence and planned to promote harmony by giving each group one of eight virtue @-@ imbued magical artifacts . However , he died before distributing the artifacts , and left no instructions for doing so . As a result , the colony collapsed into anarchy and war , and the artifacts were lost . At the time of Ultima Underworld , the Abyss contains the remnants of Cabirus 's colony , inhabited by fractious groups of humans , goblins , trolls and others . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 Before the beginning of the game , the Abyss @-@ dwelling wizard brothers Garamon and Tyball accidentally summon a demon , the Slasher of Veils , while experimenting with inter @-@ dimensional travel . Garamon is used as bait to lure the demon into a room imbued with virtue . However , the demon offers Tyball great power if he betrays Garamon . Tyball agrees , but the betrayal fails ; Garamon is killed , but seals the demon inside the room . Because he lacks virtue , Tyball cannot re @-@ enter by himself , and plans to sacrifice Baron Almric 's daughter at the doorway to gain entrance . 
 In the game 's introduction , the ghost of Garamon haunts the Avatar 's dreams with warnings of a great danger in Britannia . The Avatar allows Garamon to take him there , where he watches Tyball kidnap Baron Almric 's daughter . Tyball escapes , leaving the Avatar to be caught by the Baron 's guards . The guards take him to the Baron , who banishes him to the Great Stygian Abyss to rescue his daughter . After the introduction , the Avatar explores the dungeon and finds remnants of Cabirus 's colony . A few possible scenarios include deciding the fate of two warring goblin tribes , learning a language , and playing an instrument to complete a quest . The Avatar eventually defeats Tyball and frees the Baron 's daughter . 
 However , as he dies , Tyball reveals that he had decided to contain the Slasher of Veils , whose prison he had been weakening , within the Baron 's daughter as a way to prevent it from destroying the world . The Baron 's daughter asks the Avatar to prevent the Slasher of Veils from being unleashed , and magically teleports back to the surface to evacuate its inhabitants . With help from Garamon 's ghost , the Avatar gathers the eight talismans of Cabirus and throws them in the volcano at the base of the Abyss ; the energy they release allows Garamon to open a portal that will send the Slasher of Veils into another dimension . The Avatar is sucked through the portal into a chaotic alternate dimension , but escapes back to the Isle of the Avatar and makes it on board the Baron 's ship as the volcano erupts . As the game ends , Garamon 's spirit reveals that he teleported the inhabitants of the Abyss to another cave .

 Ultima Underworld was conceived in 1989 by Origin Systems employee Paul Neurath . He had just completed work on Space Rogue , a hybrid title that features sequences both of 2D tile @-@ based role @-@ playing and of 3D space flight simulation . According to Neurath , Space Rogue " took the first , tentative steps in exploring a blend of RPG and simulation elements , and this seemed to me a promising direction . " He felt that the way it combined the elements was jarring , however , and believed that he could create a more immersive experience . 
 Neurath had enjoyed role @-@ playing video games like Wizardry , but found that their simple , abstract visuals were an obstacle to the suspension of disbelief . He believed that Dungeon Master 's detailed first @-@ person presentation was a " glimpse into the future " , and he sought to create a fantasy role @-@ playing game that built on its example . In early 1990 , Neurath wrote a design document for a game titled Underworld , which described such elements as " goblins on the <unk> of rowboats tossed in the waves , shooting arrows at the player above on a rope bridge swinging in the wind . " He contracted former Origin employee Doug Wike to create concept art . Wike created a brief , hand @-@ drawn animation with Deluxe Paint Animation , which depicted the game 's interface and a creature moving toward the player . The animation defined the game 's direction , and it was used as a reference point for the game 's tone and features throughout development . That spring , Neurath founded the company Blue Sky Productions in Salem , New Hampshire , with the intention to create Underworld . Among the company 's first employees was Doug Church , who was studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) . The team was thus composed of Doug Church as programmer , Doug Wike as lead artist and Paul Neurath as lead designer . Development began in May 1990 . 
 An early difficulty was the implementation of texture mapping . Neurath had experimented unsuccessfully with the concept on an Apple II computer in the late 1980s , but he believed that the more powerful IBM PCs of the time might be able to process it . He contacted Lerner Research programmer Chris Green — an acquaintance from his past work with Ned Lerner — who created a working algorithm . Using the Space Rogue engine , Green 's algorithm , assembly code from Lerner Research 's Car and Driver and original programming , the Blue Sky team completed a prototype of Underworld after roughly a month of work . Neurath described the prototype as " fast , smooth , and [ featuring ] true texture mapped walls , though the ceiling and floor were flat shaded and the corridors and rooms were all 10 ' [ 3 @.@ 0 m ] high — it looked a lot like Wolfenstein @-@ 3D in fact . " The team demonstrated it at the June 1990 Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) and impressed Origin Systems . Origin producer Warren Spector later said , " I remember Paul showing me that demo [ ... ] at CES and being totally floored by it . None of us had ever seen anything like it . " The two companies reached a publishing agreement that summer , and Origin suggested that the game be reworked to fit into the Ultima universe . The team agreed , and the game was renamed Ultima Underworld . While Spector had hoped to produce the game , he was not assigned to the role ; and he later said that he " sort of watched [ the other producer ] jealously from the sidelines . " 
 After the game was renamed , Doug Church recruited Dan Schmidt , a college friend who had just graduated from MIT , as a programmer . The team abandoned the Space Rogue engine and created a new one that could display a believable 3D world — one with varying heights and texture @-@ mapped floors and ceilings . Church estimated that the first year of production was dedicated to creating the game 's technological base . However , Neurath stated that the team spent " comparatively little " time on the game 's technology , and that " most was spent working on game features , mechanics , and world building " . Their ultimate goal was to create the " finest dungeon game , a game that was tangibly better than any of the long line of dungeon games that came before it . " Each member of the small team assumed multiple roles ; for example , the game 's first two levels were designed by Paul Neurath , while the rest were built by artists , designers and programmers . According to Schmidt , Neurath contracted a writer to create the game 's story and dialogue , but the relationship was a " mismatch " ; and so the team decided to write the plot themselves . Alongside his programming work , Church co @-@ wrote the game 's story with Dan Schmidt , and he gradually took on project leader responsibilities . Writing duties for each level were given to the person who created that level ; Schmidt 's role was to edit the dialogue of each level to fit with that of the others . Schmidt also created the game 's sound effects , which were synthesized — no recorded sounds were used — in a graphical sound editor . Neurath , who Church said was " very day to day at the beginning of the project " , became more involved with the company 's business and finances . 
 Church explained that the core of the project was its " dynamic creation " . He noted that the team had " no set of rules [ ... ] or pre @-@ written plan " , but rather worked organically toward the general idea of creating a " dungeon simulation " . Church believed that the game 's Ultima series heritage was extremely helpful , as it gave the team an anchor for their experiments . According to Church , because the team was young and inexperienced , they were " improvising almost the whole time " . He said that they would " just write something " that seemed interesting , but would then " get it half done , and we 'd say , ' Eh ? That 's not working . ' " He believed that this iterative method was useful overall , but that it entailed an abnormally large workload : it resulted in the creation of " four movement systems before we were done , several combat systems , and so forth " . Certain failed experiments meant that the team created " [ AI ] code for many ideas which turned out to be largely irrelevant to the actual gameplay " . 
 During the first year of the game 's development , Church believed that Origin had little faith in the team 's ability to complete the game . He later said , " They didn 't pay any attention at all , frankly . " While Origin CEO Richard Garriott helped the team in fitting the game into the Ultima franchise , Warren Spector later said that the company seemed " blasé " about Ultima Underworld " for the first several months after <unk> and Blue Sky signed the deal " , despite his own belief that it was a " change @-@ the @-@ world project " . Neurath opined that this was due to the team 's status as outsiders , whose company was " some 1 @,@ 500 miles distant " from their publisher . The team was advanced $ 30 @,@ 000 to create the game , but its final cost was $ 400 @,@ 000 . The game was funded partly by Ned Lerner , and by Neurath 's royalties from Space Rogue . Throughout the game 's production , the studio was run on a tight budget . 
 Roughly a year into development , the team discovered that their second producer — the first having quit Origin near the beginning of development — had left the project . Neurath later said that " neither [ producer ] had much involvement " in the game , and that , following the second 's departure , the team spent time without any producer at all . Rumors circulated that Origin planned to cancel the project . Following a proposal by the team around this time , Spector , who had previously worked with Neurath on Space Rogue , assumed the role of producer . Church later described this event as " a big win for everyone " . Spector began to interact regularly with the team by phone and to visit the studio in person . Neurath later said , " Warren understood immediately what we were trying to accomplish with the game , and became our biggest champion within Origin . Had not Warren stepped in this role at that stage , I 'm not sure Ultima Underworld would have ever seen the light of day . " Church said that Spector helped the team polish the game and " make it real " , and that Spector 's past experience in the industry enabled him to keep the team focused on completing the game . He explained that Spector " had that ability to help me and the rest of the guys reset , from the big @-@ picture view of someone who has done it before . " 
 The final four months of the game 's development constituted " crunch time " . During this period , Neurath rented an extremely small basement office space in a Somerville , Massachusetts social services building : he sought to circumvent the long commute that several team members had been making from Massachusetts . Furniture consisted of inexpensive folding tables and " uncomfortable red deck chairs " . Development took place during the winter , but the room was drafty and poorly heated . The team hired college friends such as Marc LeBlanc to bug test the game , and Spector stayed at the studio for roughly a month and a half , according to Church . Spector later said that " in that little office , that team created some serious magic . I mean , the sense of doing something incredible was palpable " . Neurath summarized , " Despite the austere working environment , the game came together amazingly well in the final stretch , and we delivered the Gold Master just about two years after we had started . " The game was released in March 1992 .

 Ultima Underworld 's game engine was written by a small team . Chris Green provided the game 's texture mapping algorithm , which was applied to walls , floors and ceilings . The engine allowed for transparencies , walls at 45 degree angles , multiple tile heights and inclined surfaces , and other aspects . Ultima Underworld was the first video game to implement many of these effects . The game was also the first indoor , real @-@ time , 3D first @-@ person game to allow the player to look up and down , and to jump . 
 Ultima Underworld uses two @-@ dimensional sprites for characters , but also features 3D objects , as the team believed that it " had to do 3D objects in order to have reasonable visuals " . The game uses physics to calculate the motion of thrown objects . During the game 's alpha testing phase , part of the programming team worked to create a smooth lighting model . The game 's advanced technology caused the engine to run slowly , and its system requirements were extremely high . Doug Church later downplayed the importance of the game 's technology , stating that technological advancement " is somewhat inevitable in our field ... [ and ] sadly , as an industry we seem to know much less about design , and how to continue to extend and grow design capabilities " . Instead , he claimed that Ultima Underworld 's most important achievement was its incorporation of simulation elements into a role @-@ playing game . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Ultima Underworld was not an immediate commercial success , which caused Origin to decrease its marketing support . However , its popularity increased via word of mouth during the years after its release , and sales eventually reached nearly 500 @,@ 000 copies . The game received critical acclaim , with praise directed toward its 3D presentation and <unk> feature . In 1993 the game won the Origins Award for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1992 , and was nominated for an award at the Game Developers Conference . 
 ACE called Ultima Underworld " the next true evolutionary step in the RPG genre " , and noted that its simulation @-@ style dungeon was " frighteningly realistic " . The magazine thought that the game 's sprite character models " detract from the dense atmosphere a bit " , but ended the review by stating , " If you 've got a PC , then you 've got to have Ultima Underworld . " Dragon Magazine opined that " to say this is the best dungeon game we 've ever played is quite an understatement , " and it " will leave you wondering how other game entertainments can ever stack up against the new standards Abyss sets . " 
 Computer Gaming World 's Allen Greenberg in 1992 described it as " an ambitious project " but " not without its share of problems . " He praised the game 's " enjoyable story and well @-@ crafted puzzles " , but disliked its " robotic " controls and " confusing " perspectives , and stated that " far more impressive sounds and pictures have been produced for other dungeon games " . He summarized the game as " an enjoyable challenge with a unique game @-@ playing engine to back it up . " Scorpia was also positive , stating that despite flaws " Ultima Underworld is an impressive first product . The meticulous construction of a real @-@ world dungeon environment is outstanding . [ It ] may be a dungeon trek , but it is certainly the dungeon trek of the future " . In 1993 she praised the " superb graphics " of " a definite must for game players " . The magazine later awarded the game " Role @-@ Playing Game of the Year " . Computer Shopper enjoyed its storyline and characters , and believed that the game " makes you feel as if you 've entered a virtual reality " . Despite describing its interface as " not truly intuitive " , the reviewer finished by calling the game " addictive " and " a fine value " . The Chicago Tribune awarded it Best Game of the Year , and called it " an amazing triumph of the imagination " and " the creme de la creme of dungeon epics " . 
 The game was also well received by non @-@ English publications . The Swedish Datormagazin considered the game to be " in a class by itself " . In Germany , Power Play praised its " technical perfection " and " excellent " story , while Play Time lauded its graphical and aural presentation , and awarded it Game of the Month . Finland 's Pelit stated , " Ultima Underworld is something totally new in the CRPG field . The Virtual Fantasy of the Abyss left reviewers speechless . " 
 Ultima Underworld was inducted into many hall of fame lists , including those compiled by GameSpy , IGN and Computer Gaming World . PC Gamer US ranked the game and its sequel 20th on their 1997 The 50 Best Games Ever list , citing " strong character interaction , thoughtful puzzles , unprecedented control , and genuine roleplaying in ways that have yet to be duplicated " . In 2004 , readers of Retro Gamer voted Ultima Underworld as the 62nd top retro game : the staff called it " easily one of the best entries in the long @-@ running Ultima series . "

 Ultima Underworld has been cited as the first RPG to feature first @-@ person action in a 3D environment . Rival 3D games appeared ; Legends of Valour advertised " Ultima Underworld , move over ! " Gamasutra posited that " all 3D RPG titles from Morrowind to World of Warcraft share Ultima Underworld as a common ancestor , both graphically and spiritually ... [ and ] for better or for worse , Underworld moved the text @-@ based RPG out of the realm of imagination and into the third dimension " . Its soundtrack , composed by George " The Fat Man " Sanger and Dave Govett , was the first in a major first @-@ person game to use a dynamic music system ; the player 's actions alter the game 's music . 
 The game 's influence has been found in BioShock ( 2007 ) , and that game 's designer , Ken Levine , has stated that " all the things that I wanted to do and all the games that I ended up working on came out of the inspiration I took from [ Ultima Underworld ] . " Gears of War designer Cliff Bleszinski also cited it as an early influence , stating that it had " far more impact on me than Doom " . Other games influenced by Ultima Underworld include The Elder Scrolls : Arena , Deus Ex , Deus Ex : Invisible War , Vampire : The Masquerade – Bloodlines , and Half @-@ Life 2 . Toby Gard stated that , when designing Tomb Raider , he " was a big fan of ... Ultima Underworld and I wanted to mix that type of game with the sort of polygon characters that were just being showcased in Virtua Fighter . " Ultima Underworld was also the basis for Looking Glass Technologies ' later System Shock . 
 Id Software 's use of texture mapping in Catacomb 3 @-@ D , a precursor to Wolfenstein 3D , was influenced by Ultima Underworld . Conflicting accounts exist regarding the extent of this influence , however . In the book Masters of Doom , author David Kushner asserts that the concept was discussed only briefly during a 1991 telephone conversation between Paul Neurath and John Romero . However , Doug Church has said that John Carmack saw the game 's summer 1990 software convention demo , and recalled a comment from Carmack that he could write a faster texture mapper . Paul Neurath has recounted the incident similarly , with both Carmack and Romero were present . 
 Despite the technology developed for Ultima Underworld , Origin opted to continue using traditional top @-@ down , 2D graphics for future mainline Ultima games . The engine was re @-@ used and enhanced for Ultima Underworld 's 1993 sequel , Ultima Underworld II : Labyrinth of Worlds . Looking Glass Studios planned to create a third Ultima Underworld , but Origin rejected their pitches . After Electronic Arts ( EA ) rejected Arkane Studios ' pitch for Ultima Underworld III , the studio instead created a spiritual successor : Arx Fatalis . 
 In the early 2000s , Paul Neurath approached EA to discuss a port of Ultima Underworld to the Pocket PC . EA rejected the suggestion , but allowed him to look for possible developers ; Neurath found that <unk> Interactive enthusiastically supported the idea , and EA eventually licensed the rights to the company . Doug Church and <unk> Entertainment assisted with portions of its Pocket PC development , and the port was released in 2002 . 
 In 2015 , Otherside Entertainment , a new developer founded by Paul Neurath and other Looking Glass and Irrational veterans , announced a new entry in the series , entitled Underworld Ascendant . The new title is an officially licensed part of the series set in the Stygian Abyss , but this licensing agreement does not extend to the Ultima name or greater IP , effectively <unk> Underworld from the Ultima series . 
 = Battle of Groton Heights = 
 The Battle of Groton Heights ( also known as the Battle of Fort Griswold , and occasionally called the Fort Griswold massacre ) was a battle of the American Revolutionary War fought on September 6 , 1781 , between a small Connecticut militia force led by Lieutenant Colonel William Ledyard and the more numerous British forces led by Brigadier General Benedict Arnold and Lieutenant Colonel Edmund Eyre . 
 Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton ordered General Arnold to raid the Connecticut port of New London in an unsuccessful attempt to divert General George Washington from marching against Lord Cornwallis 's army in Virginia . The raid was a success , but the Connecticut militia stubbornly resisted British attempts to capture Fort Griswold , across the Thames River in Groton . New London was burned , along with several ships , but many more escaped upriver . Many received land grants in New York and Ohio after the battle as they lost property . Originally there was little resistance on the New London side , but it has been discovered through first @-@ hand reports that resistance was stiff as the regulars landed , similar to that at Lexington and Concord in 1775 . More than 400 militia organised during the raid on the New London side from as far as Lyme and Stonington , but they had no leadership as <unk> reportedly felt ill and rode off . 
 Several leaders of the attacking British force were killed or seriously wounded , and much of the defending garrison was killed , mortally wounded , or captured when the fort was stormed . High British casualties led to criticism of General Arnold by some of his superiors . The battle was the last major military encounter of the war in the northern United States , preceding and being overshadowed by the decisive American victory at Yorktown , Virginia about six weeks later . At the battle of Yorktown , Marquis Lafayette reportedly yelled " Remember Ft . Griswold ! " as US and French forces stormed the redoubts . 
 = = Background = = 
 Groton , Connecticut 's history dates back to 1655 . It was originally a part of New London , its larger counterpart on the other side of the Thames River on the northern shore of Long Island Sound . Groton was an important maritime port and became one of the largest along the New England coastline . Groton officially separated from New London and incorporated as a separate town in 1705 . During the American Revolutionary War , the port was a major center of rebel naval operations , including highly successful privateering operations against British shipping . The port , however , was comparatively poorly protected ; Fort Trumbull on the New London side was little more than a redoubt open on the inland side , while Fort Griswold in Groton was a more substantial , roughly square , bastioned stone fort surrounded by a ditch and some outer earthen defenses . They were typically garrisoned by small companies of militia , including a few artillerymen , and overall command of the area 's defenses was directed by Lieutenant Colonel William Ledyard . The forts suffered from continuous shortages of provisions and equipment . Fort Trumbull itself was unfinished . Fort Griswold 's infrastructure was complete , but it lacked sufficient gunpowder , cannonballs , food , and troops to conduct an effective stand against the British . 
 In August 1781 , Continental Army Major General George Washington realized that there was an opportunity to strike at the British army of Lieutenant General Charles , Earl Cornwallis in Virginia . Washington began moving his forces south from the New York area , using a variety of stratagems to deceive British Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief and head of the British forces in New York City Lieutenant General Sir Henry Clinton . General Clinton realized on September 2 that he had been deceived . He was unable to mobilize quickly enough to assist Cornwallis , and was unwilling to detach a large percentage of his forces in the face of the Continental forces that Washington had left around New York . 
 Clinton decided to launch a raid into Connecticut in an effort to draw Washington 's attention . He only planned it as a raid , but he also believed that , if a permanent British occupation of New London could be established , it could be used as a base for further operations into the interior of New England . He gave command of the forces for the raid to Norwich , Connecticut native Brigadier General Benedict Arnold , who had changed sides the previous September .

 The forces assembled by the British were divided into two battalions , numbering about 1 @,@ 700 men . The first was under Lieutenant Colonel Edmund Eyre , composed of the 40th and 54th Regiments of Foot and a Loyalist provincial regiment of Cortlandt Skinner 's New Jersey Volunteers . The second battalion was under Arnold 's command and consisted of the 38th Foot and a variety of Loyalist units , including the Loyal American Regiment and Arnold 's provincial regiment , known as the American Legion . The expedition also included about 100 Hessian jägers , a small number of artillerymen , three six @-@ pound guns , and a howitzer , all of which were divided among the battalions . These troops were embarked on transports and sailed on September 4 in the company of a fleet of smaller armed ships , led by Commodore John Bazely in the fifth @-@ rate HMS Amphion . 
 The fleet anchored about 30 miles ( 48 km ) west of New London to make final preparations , and then sailed for New London late on September 5 , intending to make a nighttime landing . However , contrary winds prevented the transports from reaching the port until it was already daylight on September 6 . In the early hours of that morning , Rufus Avery , a colonial officer stationed at Fort Griswold , witnessed the fleet 's arrival : 
 " ... about three o 'clock in the morning , as soon as I had daylight so as to see the fleet , it appeared a short distance below the lighthouse . The fleet consisted of thirty @-@ two vessels ... I immediately sent word to Captain William Latham , who commanded [ Fort Griswold ] , and who was not far distant . He very soon came to the fort , and saw the enemy 's fleet , and immediately sent a notice to Col. William Ledyard , who was commander of the harbor , Fort Griswold , and Fort Trumbull . " 
 Upon receiving the alert , Ledyard sent a messenger to notify Governor Jonathan Trumbull and local militia leaders of the British arrival , and went to Fort Griswold to arrange its defenses . Fort Griswold 's guns were fired twice , a signal of enemy approach . However , one of the British ships fired a third round , changing the meaning of the signal to indicate the arrival of a victorious friend . This signal confusion led to delays in mustering militia companies . 
 At sunrise on September 6 , the British landed on both sides of the mouth of the Thames River . The people of the town could do nothing but evacuate , and several ships in the harbor escaped upstream . The 800 @-@ man detachment that Arnold led in New London met with no resistance . The defenders of Fort Trumbull , 23 men led by Captain Shapley , fired a single volley , spiked the guns , and boarded boats to cross the river to Fort Griswold , following orders left by Colonel Ledyard . Seven of Shapley 's men were wounded , and one of the boats was captured ; the detachment that Arnold sent to take Fort Trumbull sustained four or five killed or wounded , according to Arnold 's account . Arnold 's troops continued into the town where they set about destroying stockpiles of goods and naval stores . Under the orders given , much of the town was supposed to be spared ; but unknown to Arnold , at least one of the storehouses burned contained a large quantity of gunpowder . When it ignited , the resulting explosion set fire to the surrounding buildings . The fire was soon uncontrollable and 143 buildings were consumed by flames . Several ships in the harbor were able to escape upriver when the wind changed . 
 Meanwhile , Lieutenant Colonel Eyre 's force of 800 men that landed on the east side of the Thames River was slowed by tangled woodlands and swamplands . The New Jersey Loyalists landed after the initial wave of regulars , also delayed by the difficulty in moving the artillery through rough conditions , and they did not participate in the assault . 
 George Middleton was a boy of 12 who is confused in some accounts with George Middleton , the commanding officer of an African American militia unit called the Bucks of America . He witnessed the quick rallying of Ledyard 's militia and the landing of the British regiments , which he reported occurred between 10 : 30 and 11 : 00 am : 
 " The other division of troops landed on the east side of the river ... under the command of Col. Eyre and Major Montgomery . This division ... got to the terminus of the woods ... a little south of east on a direct line from the fort . Here the division halted , and Major Montgomery sent Captain Beckwith with a flag to the fort to demand its surrender . Colonel Ledyard ... sent a flag and met Beckwith ... The bearer of the American flag answered , ' Colonel Ledyard will maintain the fort to the last extremity . ' " Eyre sent a second parley flag , threatening to give no quarter if the militia did not surrender . Ledyard 's response was as before , even though some of his subordinates argued that they should leave the fort and fight outside it . 
 General Arnold ordered Eyre to assault the fort , believing that it would fall easily . However , upon reaching a prominence from which he could see its defenses , Arnold realized that the fort was more complete than anticipated and that taking it would not be easy . One of the reasons for taking the fort was to prevent the escape of boats upriver , and many had already passed beyond the fort ; Arnold , therefore , attempted to recall Eyre , but the battle was joined a few minutes before the messenger arrived . 
 = = Battle = = 
 On the return of the second parley flag , Eyre launched a full @-@ scale assault upon the fort and its roughly 150 defenders . Stephen Hempstead , a sergeant in Ledyard 's militia recounted , " When the answer to their demand had been returned ... the enemy were soon in motion , and marched with great rapidity , in a solid column ... they rushed furiously and simultaneously to the assault of the southwest bastion and the opposite sides . " As the British neared the ditch , they were met by a bombardment of grapeshot that killed and wounded many . This briefly scattered the British , who reformed into two units . Eyre led one force against the southwest bastion , where American fire repulsed the assault , seriously wounding Eyre and several of his officers . ( New London historian Frances <unk> Caulkins ' assertion that Eyre was mortally wounded is apparently incorrect ; Arnold reported that Eyre survived . ) Major William Montgomery led the second party to an abandoned redoubt just east of the fort . From there they moved across the ditch and assaulted the ramparts . Against fierce resistance this unit gained the bastion , but Montgomery was instantly killed by a bayonet thrust . Montgomery 's men were finally able to open a gate from inside , and the British force poured into the fort . Seeing that the fort was penetrated , Colonel Ledyard ordered a cease fire and prepared to surrender the place . 
 What happened next was a subject of some controversy . The most detailed extant accounts of the event are from American sources , but are fairly consistent in what they describe . According to these accounts , the British continued to fire on the Americans despite Ledyard 's signs of surrender , and much of the garrison was consequently either killed or seriously wounded . Rufus Avery wrote in his account , " I believe there was not less than five or six hundred men of the enemy on the parade in the fort . They killed and wounded nearly every man in the fort as quick as they could ... " Jonathan Rathbun described the cold @-@ blooded killing of Colonel Ledyard with his own sword by an officer : 
 " ... the wretch who murdered him [ Ledyard ] , exclaimed , as he came near , ' Who commands this fort ? ' Ledyard handsomely replied , ' I did , but you do now ' , at the same moment handing him his sword , which the unfeeling villain buried in his breast ! Oh , the hellish spite and madness of a man that will murder a reasonable and noble @-@ hearted officer , in the act of submitting and surrendering ! " 
 Some accounts claim that Captain George Beckwith killed Ledyard , while others claim it was Captain Stephen Bromfield , who assumed command after Major Montgomery was killed . Stephen Hempstead recalled the bloody scene in the aftermath : " Never was a scene of more brutal wanton carnage witnessed than now took place . The enemy were still firing upon us ... [ until ] they discovered they were in danger of being blown up ... " Rufus Avery believed the attack was called off due to the chance that further musket fire might set off the fort 's powder magazine . 
 American accounts and historical descriptions ascribe several possible reasons for the British behavior . During the battle , the fort 's flag was supposedly shot down at one point . Although it was quickly <unk> , some of the British attackers interpreted the event as striking the colors , making a sign of surrender ; the British suffered significant casualties when they then approached the fort on that occasion . Combined with anger over the death and wounding of their commanding officers , this led them to disregard Ledyard 's legitimate surrender . Some accounts also claim that Americans in one part of the fort were unaware that Ledyard had surrendered , and continued to fight , leading the British to also continue fighting , even against those who had surrendered . 
 Early British historians generally did not report much beyond Arnold 's report of the expedition , which did not mention killings after the surrender . William Gordon , however , reported in his 1788 history of the war that " [ t ] he Americans had not more than a half dozen killed " before the fort was stormed , and that " a severe execution took place after resistance ceased . " An Italian historian wrote in 1809 that " [ t ] he assailants massacred as well those who surrendered as those who resisted . " 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The massacre at Fort Griswold marked one of the largest tragedies in the history of Groton and Connecticut , and was one of the last British victories in North America before the end of the war . Damage to New London was substantial : one estimate placed the value destroyed at nearly $ 500 @,@ 000 . The battle left nearly 100 families homeless and destroyed nine public buildings and much of the town 's waterfront . The state in 1792 identified losses that totaled more than £ 61 @,@ 000 , or $ 200 @,@ 000 Continental dollars . Some who lost homes or property were awarded land in the Western Reserve . 
 The slaughter at Fort Griswold left dozens of Americans dead . The Groton Gazette reported that casualties numbered about 150 . Some survivors escaped , such as George Middleton , but others were taken prisoner , including Stephen Hempstead . He stated , " After the massacre , they plundered us of everything we had , and left us literally naked . " Hempstead was among the wounded and reported how he was placed on a wagon with others to be taken down to the fleet . The wagon was allowed to run down the hill , where it stopped when it struck a tree , throwing some of the men off the wagon and aggravating their injuries . General Arnold reported that 85 men " were found dead in Fort Griswold , and sixty wounded , most of them mortally . " 
 Benedict Arnold later issued a report stating that 48 British soldiers were killed and 145 wounded . General Clinton praised Arnold for his " spirited conduct " , but also complained about the high casualty rate ; about 25 percent of the troops sent against Fort Griswold were killed or wounded . One British observer wrote that it had been like " a Bunker Hill expedition " , and many British soldiers blamed Arnold for the events at Fort Griswold , even though he had not been in a position to prevent the reported slaughter . Arnold next proposed a raiding expedition against Philadelphia , but the surrender of General Charles Cornwallis at Yorktown in late October ended that idea .

 The British left a burning powder trail to destroy Fort Griswold 's magazine , but a daring militiaman entered the fort and extinguished the fire . Both Forts Trumbull and Griswold were extensively modified in the 19th century , and are now preserved in state parks . The Fort Griswold park also includes the Groton Monument , erected in the 1820s to commemorate the battle . Both forts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places .

 " City of Blinding Lights " is a song by the rock band U2 . It is the fifth track on their 2004 album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb and was released as the album 's fourth single on 6 June 2005 . The song was a top ten hit in Ireland , the United Kingdom , and several other countries . The music video was shot in Vancouver , British Columbia . 
 The earliest incarnation of the song was developed during sessions for the band 's 1997 album Pop . The lyrics were partially inspired by lead singer Bono 's recollection of his first trip to London , and by the band 's experience of playing New York City in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks . Other lyrics refer to Bono 's relationship with his wife . The song 's underlying theme reflects lost innocence and was inspired by an image Bono saw of himself from the early 1980s . The sound has been compared to the tone of U2 's 1984 album The Unforgettable Fire and their 1987 single " Where the Streets Have No Name . " 
 " City of Blinding Lights " was well received by critics and won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Song at the 2006 ceremony . The song made its live debut on the group 's 2005 Vertigo Tour , when it was commonly played as the opening song , and it has been performed at every show from a U2 concert tour since . The track has been used in episodes of The Simpsons and Entourage , and in the film The Devil Wears Prada . 
 President Barack Obama used it at campaign events during the 2008 and 2012 U.S. presidential elections , and listed it as one of his favourite songs ; U2 performed it at his inaugural celebration . 
 = = Writing and inspiration = = 
 U2 developed " City of Blinding Lights " from a song called " Scott Walker , " an outtake from the band 's 1997 album Pop . This incarnation , written as an homage to the singer of the same name , was only an outline when the recording sessions for Pop concluded . The group reworked it in preparation for their 2000 album All That You Can 't Leave Behind , but the song was still unfinished when that album was released . They rewrote the song for their 2004 album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb . Bassist Adam Clayton said , " There was a melody and a groove that ultimately didn 't go anywhere and we kind of threw out everything , found chords that worked with that melody and built it back up , new drum parts , new bass parts , new guitars . " 
 A photographic exhibition in the Netherlands by longtime band photographer Anton Corbijn served as a thematic inspiration for the song . Lead vocalist Bono saw an image of himself boarding a helicopter , taken in 1982 during filming of the music video for " New Year 's Day . " A journalist asked him what he would say to his younger self if given the chance ; Bono replied , " I 'd tell him he 's absolutely right and stop second guessing himself . " He explained his comments later , saying , " I realized how much I 'd lost ... that way of looking at the world . There was such a clarity to it , but it was so defiant in a way . " 
 The chorus was inspired by U2 's first concert in New York City following the September 11 attacks during their 2001 Elevation Tour . When the lights illuminated the audience during a performance of " Where the Streets Have No Name , " the band saw tears streaming down the faces of many fans . Upon seeing this raw release of emotion , Bono shouted , " Oh you look so beautiful tonight " ; later , the band integrated the line into the chorus . The fans ' passion , along with the resolve of the city following the attack , were the primary inspirations for many of the song 's other lyrics . 
 = = Composition and theme = = 
 " City of Blinding Lights " is played in common time at a tempo of 139 beats per minute in two keys : A ♭ major in the verses , and E ♭ major in the chorus . 
 The album version of the song runs for 5 : 47 . It begins with a low note played on an electric guitar with heavy delay and distortion . The note is sustained for ten seconds as its harmonics gradually feed back . A pulsing rhythm guitar part with muted staccato chords by the Edge then begins underneath . After a further ten seconds it is joined by lower @-@ register guitar drones played by the Edge , and a repetition of four descending piano notes performed by the Edge and Bono . Forty @-@ five seconds into the song , halfway through the introduction , Clayton 's bass and percussion by drummer Larry Mullen , Jr. fade into the song with producer Jacknife Lee 's synthesizers , which play part of the melody line . The first verse begins at 1 : 20 and is accompanied by the bass , drums and rhythm guitar playing the chord progression A ♭ – E ♭ – D ♭ . This alters to B – D ♭ in the pre @-@ chorus , with a short harmony vocal line leading to the E ♭ – D ♭ chorus . 
 After the second chorus , the lead guitar alternates with Bono 's repeated " Time " into the B ♭ – A ♭ bridge before returning to an extended chorus . The vocals range from D ♭ 3 in the verses to a peak of C5 in the chorus . The Edge provides backing vocals in the second verse , the first three chorus lines , and the bridge lyric " Time won 't leave me as I am / Time won 't take the boy out of this man " . There is no chorus after the third verse ; instead , the track enters into a coda where , after restating the introductory piano theme , the guitar , bass , and drum parts come to a finish . The song concludes on a final reprise of the piano notes . The radio edit , with a run @-@ time of 4 : 11 , is 1 : 36 shorter than the album version . The introduction is half the length and the bass and drums enter after only two repetitions of the piano notes . The first two verses are kept intact but the bridge is shortened by seven seconds , removing two calls of " Time . " The third verse is cut and the coda shortened by twenty seconds . 
 The sound of " City of Blinding Lights " has been compared to U2 's 1987 single " Where the Streets Have No Name , " prompted by a similar style of guitar playing , as well as to the atmospheric tone of the band 's 1984 album The Unforgettable Fire . The melding of guitar and piano in the introduction was likened by the Edmonton Journal to the Coldplay song " Clocks . " Rolling Stone described the song as " building into a bittersweet lament " , while Uncut said it was " beautiful but slightly sinister " , comparing the quality of the lyrics to the George Harrison song " The Inner Light . " 
 The underlying theme of " City of Blinding Lights , " reflected in the chorus , is lost innocence . The theme was reinforced during an impromptu concert at Empire – Fulton Ferry State Park under the Brooklyn Bridge ; Bono introduced the song by reminiscing about the first time the band arrived in New York City , calling it " a song about innocence and <unk> . " Bono developed the opening stanza from a memory of his first trip to London with his future wife , Alison Stewart , when they were teenagers . The experience of walking through Piccadilly Circus and along Wardour Street put him in mind of " discovering what a big city could offer you and what it could take away . " Although the first verse is set in London , the chorus is set in New York City . The verse , " I 've seen you walk unafraid / I 've seen you in the clothes you 've made / Can you see the beauty inside of me ? / What happened to the beauty I had inside of me ? " was written as an expression of love for Alison , with a reflection on their life together as they grow older . 
 Like many other U2 songs , " City of Blinding Lights " can be interpreted in a religious manner . Author Cameron Conant related the opening verse to the doubt he felt about his convictions on politics , marriage , and faith as he aged , concluding that a person 's confidence in their beliefs makes it seem as if they know more than they do . Music critic Bill Friskics @-@ Warren felt that the final line , " Blessings not just for the ones who kneel , luckily " , was a way for Bono to berate himself for not praying enough , and was an attack on Christianity because " faith often perpetuates the misery and divisiveness that he decries . " Steve Stockman , a chaplain at Queen 's University of Belfast , believed the song was a metaphor for growing up , and that the final line meant that not just people of faith could be blessed .

 Three major versions of the single were released , including two CD singles and one DVD single . Additionally , a mini CD single was released in Europe , and a separate CD single containing all four tracks from CD1 and CD2 was released in Japan . The " Hot Chip 2006 " remix of the song was included on the 2010 compilation album Artificial Horizon .

Videos of these performances would later be included as bonus tracks on the DVD release of Zoo TV : Live from Sydney . The rendition of " Out of Control " was taken from a promotional concert the band played at the Empire – Fulton Ferry State Park in Brooklyn , New York on 22 November 2004 ; the live video of " City of Blinding Lights " on the DVD release was taken from the same concert .

 The music video for " City of Blinding Lights " was directed by Alex Courtes and Martin <unk> . Shot at General Motors Place in Vancouver , British Columbia on 27 April 2005 , the video included additional footage from the band 's Vertigo Tour concert of 28 April . Planning for the project began as soon as U2 became aware the arena was available ( a result of the NHL lockout of 2004 – 2005 ) . Manager Paul McGuinness believed selecting Vancouver as the filming location made a lot of sense , saying , " [ i ] t 's a world @-@ renowned production centre . We knew we 'd be able to get the crews and camera people and equipment here . " Members of the public were invited to be part of the video via radio and internet announcements . Word of the shoot leaked before the official announcement , which led to fans lining up outside for the entire day . Between 3 @,@ 000 and 5 @,@ 000 people were allowed in for the filming . During the shoot , U2 performed " City of Blinding Lights " multiple times , followed by " Vertigo , " " All Because of You " and " Sometimes You Can 't Make It on Your Own . " 
 The video shows the band playing the song on the Vertigo Tour stage . The live audio is kept to demonstrate the imperfections and emotion in the performance . The lighting is kept low , drawing attention to the visuals on the LED curtains used throughout the tour and obscuring much of the band members ' facial features in shadow . Courtes and <unk> explained : " we wanted to reflect the mood we 've seen at the concerts , so we played with that lighting knowing that you are more blinded from a light if it was darker before " .

 " City of Blinding Lights " was performed on every night of the Vertigo Tour , opening 86 of the 131 concerts and a public dress rehearsal immediately before its launch . Performances frequently began with confetti falling from the ceiling , serving as a bridge to engage the audience . The song made extensive use of the stage 's LED curtains for its visual effects ; Wired noted that " they do a fine imitation of Shinjuku on speed , and the lighting design for ' City of Blinding Lights ' takes advantage of that ... the visual effect manages to be far more that [ sic ] the sum of its parts . " The Vancouver Sun described the result as " akin to a busy street at night through a misted windshield " , later saying it provided " a theme for the night – the sparse , elegant stage was constantly bathed in vivid colours " . During the Vertigo Tour , the piano introduction was played by Adam Clayton on a keyboard . Sound engineer Joe O 'Herlihy believed Clayton 's bass in the live setting to be " the driving implement that pushes the sound along " . 
 " City of Blinding Lights " was played on every night of the U2 360 ° Tour , in each case appearing approximately halfway through the set . The lighting effects used on the U2 360 ° Tour video screen emulate the LED curtain visuals of the Vertigo Tour and were described as " psychedelic " by Edna Gundersen of USA Today . It is one of a handful of songs to utilize the fully descended video screen . 
 With the exception of two shows early in the tour , the song was played at every date of the Innocence + Experience Tour , typically opening the encore . The lighting effects utilised the numerous fluorescent tubes set around the stage , while the video screen showed cityscapes at night superimposed with the band members performances . 
 Live performances of the song appear on the DVDs Vertigo 2005 : Live from Chicago and U2 360 ° at the Rose Bowl , the bonus disc of U218 Singles , and on the 2005 U2.com subscriber 's release <unk> The <unk> version is an audio rip of the performance from Vertigo 2005 : Live from Chicago .

 Tom Clancy 's Splinter Cell : Blacklist is an action @-@ adventure stealth video game developed by Ubisoft Toronto and published by Ubisoft . The sixth installment of the Tom Clancy 's Splinter Cell series , it is the sequel of Splinter Cell : Conviction . The game was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 , Wii U , and Xbox 360 in August 2013 . 
 Players control Sam Fisher , a spymaster working for the Fourth Echelon , in a mission to stop the Engineers , a group of terrorists which is trying to coerce the United States into recalling all of its troops stationed abroad . Blacklist 's gameplay is similar to its predecessors , with players tasked with completing objectives and defeating enemies . The game endeavors to combine elements of its predecessors , including the action focus of Conviction and the stealth focus of the older games . Blacklist marks the return of the asymmetrical multiplayer mode Spies vs. Mercs , which was introduced in Pandora Tomorrow . 
 It is the first title developed by Ubisoft Toronto , a studio founded by Ubisoft in 2009 . The game was directed by Maxime Béland , who had worked on Conviction , and produced by Jade Raymond . To prepare for this game , Béland studied reviews and feature lists of the latter . Blacklist is the first Splinter Cell game starring Eric Johnson as Sam Fisher , since series veteran Michael Ironside was unable to perform motion capture for the game . The Toronto studio focused on the game 's Windows , PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions , and its later @-@ announced Wii U version was developed by Ubisoft Shanghai . 
 Blacklist 's pre @-@ release reception was generally positive , despite criticism of its new voice actor . The game received generally positive reviews when it was released , with praise for its level design , story , and multiplayer mode . However , criticism was directed at its dated graphics . It failed to meet Ubisoft 's sales expectations , with sales of two million copies three months after its release . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 In Blacklist , players assume control of series protagonist Sam Fisher as he seeks to stop a terrorist group called the Engineers . The gameplay emphasizes stealth , and utilizes the third @-@ person perspective . During the game , players can rotate its camera , run , crouch and leap over obstacles . Since Blacklist intended to continue the " aggressive stealth " of Conviction while retaining the traditional stealth features of the older games , it combines action and stealth , and allows players to use different approaches and methods to complete objectives and defeat enemies . Players can complete levels without being noticed by the non @-@ playable characters ' artificial intelligence by taking cover or using other traditional stealth methods . If the player chooses to kill enemies , other enemies are alerted when they see their companions ' dead bodies . To avoid this , players can hide corpses . Fisher can also create a strategically advantageous dark environment by destroying nearby lights , and is equipped with customizable night @-@ vision and sonar goggles to detect enemies in darkness and see through walls . He also has the Tri @-@ Rotor , a compact surveillance drone which can spy on enemies , create distractions , give electric shocks , and self @-@ destruct to kill enemies . 
 Players can play a more aggressive run @-@ and @-@ gun game by using gadgets and weapons to eliminate enemies . They can interact with environmental objects , such as ledges and zip @-@ lines , to navigate levels . Conviction 's mark @-@ and @-@ execute system returns in Blacklist , with refinements and additions to allow players to mark several targets . When they attack , they can kill all marked targets instantly . Improvements made the system work more fluidly . A variety of enemies ( including soldiers and dogs ) are encountered in the game , following the protagonist and alerting their companions . Players have the option to kill them , leave them untouched , or incapacitate them , and the game classifies their choices in one of three categories : Ghost ( stealthy play ) , Panther ( stealthy , aggressive play ) , and Assault ( aggressive play ) . 
 When players kill ( or avoid ) targets and complete objectives , experience points and money are awarded to buy ( or improve ) weapons , and upgrade the Paladin airship and Sam 's suit and equipment ; the upgrades improve efficiency in completing missions . Experience gained depends on the difficulty level and how the game is played ; the greater the stealth , the greater the reward . According to Ubisoft Toronto , the system , known as " universal economy " , was intended to satisfy players ; every action has a corresponding reward . 
 The Paladin is the game 's hub . Between missions , players can interact with crew members on the ship and view the game 's objectives . Crew members also offer the protagonist side missions to complete . Before a mission Fisher can deploy the strategic mission interface , allowing players to see enemy positions and plan attacks and routes . Players can also use the interface to access multiplayer modes and missions . 
 Although the game has interrogation sequences involving questioning ( or torturing ) targets , it does not have Conviction 's interactive torture scenes . Players can still decide whether to spare their targets or kill them after interrogation , and these decisions influence the relationship between Fisher and other crew members . 
 Blacklist has platform @-@ specific features , including voice integration with Xbox 360 's Kinect peripheral which allows players to distract enemies before attacking . A player can also use the Kinect sensor to control the protagonist with their body instead of the Xbox 360 controller . In the Wii U version , the Gamepad controller 's touchscreen is an interface , accessing gadgets and other features from the protagonist 's arm @-@ mounted computer ( <unk> ) , and incorporating screen and motion controls to highlight enemies with thermal vision when using Killing in Motion . The Wii U version was not shipped with the game 's cooperative mode . 
 = = = Multiplayer modes = = = 
 The " Spies vs. Mercs " competitive mode introduced in Pandora Tomorrow again appears in Blacklist . An asymmetrical multiplayer mode , it pits two teams ( with different gadgets , playing as spies or mercenaries ) against each other . Spies , in third @-@ person perspective , are equipped with smoke grenades and flashbangs and are tasked with hacking computer stations heavily guarded by mercenaries . Mercenaries , in first person , can access lethal and longer @-@ range weapons despite being unable to stealth @-@ kill enemies . The mode has two varieties : Classic , supporting four players , and Blacklist , supporting eight . 
 Blacklist also has a co @-@ operative multiplayer mode , where each mission can be accessed by talking with the crew of the Paladin . Crew members offer a variety of missions and requirements for completing them , and players play as Fisher or his colleague Briggs ; both have the same abilities . The game has a total of 14 missions , with split @-@ screen play supported . In addition to co @-@ op and Spies vs. Mercs , Blacklist has other multiplayer modes including Uplink control , Team Deathmatch , and Extraction .

 Blacklist again features Sam Fisher , who is now the spymaster and commander of the newly installed Fourth Echelon . The game also sees the return of Fisher 's old ally , Anna ( Grim ) <unk> , and new characters such as Isaac Briggs and Charlie Cole . Several supporting characters from Conviction reappear , including Victor Coste , Patricia Caldwell , and Andriy Kobin . 
 = = = Main campaign = = = 
 Sam Fisher is leaving Andersen Air Force Base when a terrorist organization assaults the base , wounding Paladin Nine Security co @-@ worker and best friend Victor Coste . Soon afterwards a faction known as the Engineers takes responsibility , announcing a series of attacks on the United States , the titular Blacklist , which will continue until the U.S. recalls its troops deployed abroad . 
 U.S. President Caldwell assigns Fisher , his colleague Charlie Cole , CIA agent Isaac Briggs and Anna <unk> to Fourth Echelon , a new special @-@ ops and counter @-@ terrorism unit . Charged with stopping the Engineers , the group uses the cargo plane Paladin as its command center . Fourth Echelon first aims to secure Andriy Kobin , a CIA hostage believed to possess information on the Engineers . Fisher extracts him from a safe house in Benghazi , and learns that his associates have ties to the Engineers . Infiltrating an insurgent stronghold , he finds an executed U.S. soldier and learns from a video recording that the executioner is Majid Sadiq ; a former MI6 agent , Sadiq demands the Fourth Echelon to stop interfering . 
 Believing that their next target is a water @-@ filtration plant near Navy Pier , Fisher infiltrates the Engineers and prevents the release of a biological toxin into the water supply . Kobin then tells him that mercenary supplier Reza Nouri may be allied with the Engineers . Sam assaults Nouri 's mansion , capturing him for questioning . When he learns about an Engineer sleeper cell in London , Fisher infiltrates an abandoned mill and discovers chemical bombs in a shipping bay . Opening a bomb to plant a tracking device , he is exposed to nerve gas . Incapacitated and apparently dying , Fisher is captured by Sadiq and rescued by Briggs ; in the ensuing confrontation , Sadiq escapes while Briggs provides first aid to Sam . 
 The fully healed Fisher and Briggs then deploy to Philadelphia . When they find four bombs being loaded onto trains , they follow the bombs to a rail yard and disarm them . Boarding a departing train of Engineers , Fisher fights his way through the cars and pursues an Engineer leader ( who escapes into a station and is killed by a police officer ) . 
 Briggs uses his CIA credentials to have Fisher sent to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp , allowing him to continue interrogating Nouri . Nouri confirms that Sadiq is head of the Engineers , and says that Sadiq knows the identities of the Fourth Echelon leaders . Escaping from the prison , Briggs and Fisher reach the Paladin in Yucatán and escape when the plane is attacked by Sadiq . Fourth Echelon restarts the plane with Kobin 's help , and Sadiq executes a Blacklist attack on the largest U.S. gas reserve in Louisiana . 
 As the president begins continuity @-@ of @-@ government procedures , Fisher shuts down the burning plant and averts a chain reaction to the next reserve . When he captures another senior Engineer , he learns about Sadiq 's final plan : to disclose all U.S. military secrets . Sadiq kidnaps the Secretary of Defense and holds them at the Site F government bunker under Denver International Airport . Disregarding the president 's order , Fourth Echelon infiltrates the base . Despite Cole 's infiltration of Sadiq 's team , Sadiq 's men capture Briggs and torture the secretary of defense into authorizing the transfer . Briggs intervenes , killing the secretary and halting Sadiq 's plan . 
 The Engineers try to flee Site F , using Briggs and the hostages as human shields . Fisher , disguised as an Air Force hostage , helps Delta Force marksmen open fire on Sadiq and his men . Sadiq escapes on foot , and Fisher disarms and seriously wounds him . Sadiq boasts that he has already won ; if he dies twelve nations supporting the Engineers will declare war on the U.S. and if he is tried , he will leak U.S. information . Although Fisher spares Sadiq , he detains him . President Caldwell publicly covers Sadiq 's imprisonment by announcing his death , and the game ends as Fourth Echelon continues its operations ; in a post @-@ credits scene , a recovered Coste and Fisher prepare to interrogate Sadiq .

 Intertwined with the main plot , the co @-@ op missions begin with Fisher and Briggs infiltrating Kashmir . Finding a group of smugglers linked to the Engineers , Fisher and Briggs discover intelligence connecting them to the Russian intelligence organization Voron , before they escape during a drone attack . 
 Following a lead to a friendly missile base in Bangalore , they find the Indian inhabitants dead and Voron agents stealing the warhead from a missile . Securing the missile and learning that the agents are led by a man named Cherski , Fisher and Briggs escape as the building is destroyed and Indian authorities arrive . Unaware of Cherski 's identity , Fisher and Briggs track him to a Voron base in Chittagong and find him living in a nearby apartment . They breach Cherski 's panic room and find two people ; uncertain which one is Cherski , they begin interrogating both and learn about a secret base in Russia . 
 Fisher and Briggs reach an abandoned <unk> , surviving a drone attack , and find a secure medical facility said to contain an <unk> ( satellite uplink device used by Fourth Echelon operatives ) with vital Voron information . Instead , the base contains a comatose man . Rescuing the man , Fisher and Briggs narrowly escape as the base self @-@ destructs and return the patient to the Paladin . Grim identifies him as Mikhail " Kestrel " <unk> and Kobin confirms his identity , noting that they have a history ( detailed in Conviction ) . When he questions Kobin ( who asks if Kestrel 's gunshot wound has put him into a coma ) , Fisher notes that no one had told Kobin how Kestrel had been incapacitated .

 Ubisoft Montreal 's success inspired the company to continue its Canadian expansion , and a new studio , Ubisoft Toronto , was announced on July 6 , 2009 . Headed by Jade Raymond , the studio focuses on the creation of triple @-@ A video games and intellectual property . It worked on a new installment of the Splinter Cell series , which was in parallel development with an unnamed project , and the Toronto team was made up of Ubisoft Montreal 's core Conviction team . Maxime Béland , who had worked on Conviction , was the game 's creative director , and in November 2010 Raymond confirmed that her studio was developing Splinter Cell 6 . Ubisoft Toronto was the game 's lead developer , with assistance from Ubisoft Montreal . Ubisoft Shanghai developed the game 's co @-@ operative multiplayer mode . The Toronto studio focused on the game 's Windows , PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions , with the Wii U version developed by Ubisoft Shanghai . 
 In 2010 , the series ' fifth installment , Conviction , was released . Although it received generally positive reviews , it was criticized by series fans for lacking some features . Béland considered Conviction a " stepping stone " for him when he prepared for the development of Blacklist . The development team studied Conviction 's reviews and feature lists , deciding to discard its " black @-@ and @-@ white " stealth approach , and also deciding to bring back the Spies vs. Mercs mode introduced in Pandora Tomorrow . Béland called the mode 's return " the easiest decision of [ his ] life " , since the team considered its absence Conviction 's greatest misstep . Ubisoft sent questionnaires through Uplay to thousands of players to collect feedback on Conviction 's new features . When players called Conviction 's campaign weak and short , the team added a stronger storyline and greater character depth by introducing the Fourth Echelon and Fisher as a leader ( a series first ) . To encourage repeat play the team introduced the aircraft hub and the strategic mission interface , a player menu . 
 According to Ubisoft Toronto founder Jade Raymond , the series had become too grueling and complicated for modern gamers , and its popularity had suffered relative to Ubisoft flagship franchises such as Assassin 's Creed and Far Cry . The Toronto studio hoped to introduce the franchise to a broader audience , while remaining tactical and hardcore for long @-@ term series fans . It introduced a perfectionist mode , significantly increasing the game 's difficulty by removing some of Fisher 's abilities . The team also introduced accessible , action @-@ oriented gameplay segments which would suit new players , crafting open @-@ ended levels which could be reached with different approaches to broaden the variety of play . The developers re @-@ worked the controls to increase gameplay fluidity , allowing players to automatically leap over objects and traverse a simplified environment . 
 During Blacklist 's development , its team faced a variety of challenges . The first was to create stealth which was satisfying and fun for players . According to the team , players gain satisfaction from stealth with freedom and choices which allow them to develop a plan . Players must experiment , with each decision having consequences . Game director Patrick Redding compared it to the development of an ecosystem ; the team designed a dynamic artificial intelligence which would react differently to players ' actions , making levels feel alive and adding randomness . Encouraging the " panther " style of play ( aggressive stealth ) , the team incorporated elements from the original Tom Clancy 's Splinter Cell ( where one mistake would abort a mission ) and Conviction ( where stealth seamlessly becomes combat ) . This approach , the team thought , could help players to feel like elite , silent predators . 
 Series veteran Michael Ironside did not reprise his role as the voice of Sam Fisher . His part was played by Eric Johnson , who also performed the motion capture . In a Blacklist developer diary , Ironside said that he was passing the torch to another actor . According to Ubisoft executives the change was made to take advantage of new performance @-@ capture technology to enrich the game experience , and Ironside assisted Johnson with the role . Elias <unk> , voice and performance @-@ capture actor for Andriy Kobin in Splinter Cell : Conviction , said that he would return for the new game . 
 Unlike Conviction , the game would have no interactive torture sequences . Instead , players could choose whether to kill or incapacitate a target after interrogation . The system was not complex , and it was hoped that players would choose based on instinct . According to Béland , every player choice is gray and there are no right or wrong choices . However , the game demo has an interactive torture scene in which players can decide how deeply a knife penetrates a person 's shoulder . After a mixed @-@ to @-@ negative response , Ubisoft removed the scene from its final product .

 Although Joystiq 's Mike Schramm praised Blacklist 's early screenshots and videos for removing Conviction 's monochromatic visuals , its new voice actor was not received well by some fans . Ubisoft responded with a statement that Ironside was not returning as Fisher because an actor " physically capable " of a motion @-@ capture performance was needed , and Johnson was hired for the role .

 Tom Clancy 's Splinter Cell : Blacklist received positive reviews . The review aggregator websites GameRankings and Metacritic rated the PlayStation 3 version at 85 % and 84 out of 100 , the Xbox 360 version 84 % and 82 out of 100 , the PC version 80 % and 82 out of 100 , and the Wii U version 79 % and 75 out of 100 . 
 The game 's design was praised by most reviewers . Ryan McCaffrey of IGN praised the gameplay 's variety and player options , which he thought made Blacklist the best installment in the series since Tom Clancy 's Splinter Cell : Chaos Theory . According to McCaffrey , the game was a satisfying stealth experience and an excellent , capable shooter ( increasing its replay value ) . He noted that several segments forced players to use the Mark and Execute feature , frustrating players who favored stealth over action . Ben Reeves of Game Informer praised the return and refinement of Mark and Execute , which he found satisfying , and praised the game 's intense , varied mission design . Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer disliked the game 's direction , particularly its action elements ( which he compared to 2012 's Hitman : Absolution ) . 
 Blacklist 's campaign was also generally praised . According to IGN 's McCaffrey , the game 's story is superior to those of its predecessors : well @-@ balanced and believable . He criticized Sam Fisher 's new voice actor , whom he thought failed to replicate Ironside 's charm . Ben Reeves praised the story 's plot twists and sympathetic characters . On the Joystiq blog , Xav De Matos liked the game 's narrative urgency and engaging plot twists but criticized its rushed ending . Simon Miller of VideoGamer.com called the game forgettable and boring , with Fisher 's new voice actor failing to bring personality to the character . Eurogamer 's Bramwell also criticized the game 's lack of character development . 
 Its multiplayer features were praised ; according to McCaffrey , the co @-@ operative multiplayer mode had enough content for a separate game . Although he appreciated Spies vs. Mercs ' faster pace , he found the mode less innovative than its predecessor . Reeves partially agreed , describing the revived Spies vs. Mercs mode as refreshing , intense , and bloody . De Matos wrote that it was one of the best multiplayer modes he had ever experienced , and the Blacklist version had evolved and modernized while remaining creative . Daniel Bloodworth of GameTrailers praised the game 's satisfying co @-@ op design , which tasks players to plan and coordinate strategy . 
 Blacklist 's graphics and lack of difficulty were criticized . McCaffrey found the visuals unimpressive and most character models to be ugly ; he also noted technical problems , such as screen @-@ tearing and frame rate issues . Bloodworth criticized the game 's invisible wall and unresponsive controls in certain segments , although he thought those minor issues did not drag down its overall experience . McCaffrey noted that even when the game is played in perfectionist mode , it is less challenging than its predecessors . He thought Blacklist gave players too many rewards , making its universal @-@ economy system a useless feature . Bloodworth was puzzled by the game 's unlock system , which he said hindered its credibility .

 Ubisoft hoped that Tom Clancy 's Splinter Cell : Blacklist would sell at least five million copies .

On October 16 , 2013 Ubisoft announced that Blacklist had failed to meet sales expectations , and on November 13 it was announced that the game had sold two million copies worldwide . 
 = Aradia , or the Gospel of the Witches = 
 Aradia , or the Gospel of the Witches is a book composed by the American folklorist Charles Godfrey Leland that was published in 1899 . It contains what he believed was the religious text of a group of pagan witches in Tuscany , Italy that documented their beliefs and rituals , although various historians and folklorists have disputed the existence of such a group . In the 20th century , the book was very influential in the development of the contemporary Pagan religion of Wicca . 
 The text is a composite . Some of it is Leland 's translation into English of an original Italian manuscript , the Vangelo ( gospel ) . Leland reported receiving the manuscript from his primary informant on Italian witchcraft beliefs , a woman Leland referred to as " Maddalena " and whom he called his " witch informant " in Italy . The rest of the material comes from Leland 's research on Italian folklore and traditions , including other related material from Maddalena . Leland had been informed of the Vangelo 's existence in 1886 , but it took Maddalena eleven years to provide him with a copy . After translating and editing the material , it took another two years for the book to be published . Its fifteen chapters portray the origins , beliefs , rituals , and spells of an Italian pagan witchcraft tradition . The central figure of that religion is the goddess Aradia , who came to Earth to teach the practice of witchcraft to peasants in order for them to oppose their feudal oppressors and the Roman Catholic Church . 
 Leland 's work remained obscure until the 1950s , when other theories about , and claims of , " pagan witchcraft " survivals began to be widely discussed . Aradia began to be examined within the wider context of such claims . Scholars are divided , with some dismissing Leland 's assertion regarding the origins of the manuscript , and others arguing for its authenticity as a unique documentation of folk beliefs . Along with increased scholarly attention , Aradia came to play a special role in the history of Gardnerian Wicca and its offshoots , being used as evidence that pagan witchcraft survivals existed in Europe , and because a passage from the book 's first chapter was used as a part of the religion 's liturgy . After the increase in interest in the text , it became widely available through numerous reprints from a variety of publishers , including a 1999 critical edition with a new translation by Mario and Dina Pazzaglini . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Charles Godfrey Leland was an American author and folklorist , and spent much of the 1890s in Florence researching Italian folklore . Aradia was one of the products of Leland 's research . While Leland 's name is the one principally associated with Aradia , the manuscript that makes up the bulk of it is attributed to the research of an Italian woman that Leland and Leland 's biographer , his niece Elizabeth Robins Pennell , referred to as " Maddalena " . According to folklorist Roma Lister , a contemporary and friend of Leland 's , Maddalena 's real name was Margherita , and she was a " witch " from Florence who claimed a family lineage from the Etruscans and knowledge of ancient rituals . Professor Robert Mathiesen , as a contributor to the Pazzaglini translation of Aradia , mentions a letter from Maddalena to Leland , which he states is signed " Maddalena <unk> " ( the last name being a guess as the handwriting is difficult to decipher ) . However , pagan scholar Raven Grimassi presented a document at the <unk> convention on February 17 , 2008 , revealing that Maddalena 's last name was actually <unk> . This document was reproduced from The International Folklore Congress : Papers and Transactions , 1892 , page 454 . 
 Leland reports meeting Maddalena in 1886 , and she became the primary source for his Italian folklore collecting for several years . Leland describes her as belonging to a vanishing tradition of sorcery . He writes that " by long practice [ she ] has perfectly learned ... just what I want , and how to extract it from those of her kind . " He received several hundred pages worth of material from her , which was incorporated into his books Etruscan Roman Remains in Popular Tradition , Legends of Florence Collected From the People , and eventually Aradia . Leland wrote that he had " learned that there was in existence a manuscript setting forth the doctrines of Italian witchcraft " in 1886 , and had urged Maddalena to find it . Eleven years later , on 1 January 1897 , Leland received the Vangelo by post . The manuscript was written in Maddalena 's handwriting . Leland understood it to be an authentic document of the " Old Religion " of the witches , but explains that he did not know if the text came from written or oral sources . Maddalena 's correspondence with Leland indicated that she intended to marry a man named Lorenzo <unk> and emigrate to the United States , and the Vangelo was the last material Leland received from her . Author Raven Grimassi , at the <unk> convention on February 17 , 2008 , presented a copy of a letter written by Leland ( housed in The Library of Congress ) . The letter states that Maddalena did not follow through with her plans , but instead left her husband and worked in Genoa for a period of time before returning to Florence . 
 Leland 's translation and editing was completed in early 1897 and submitted to David Nutt for publication . Two years passed , until Leland wrote requesting the return of the manuscript in order to submit it to a different publishing house . This request spurred Nutt to accept the book , and it was published in July 1899 in a small print run . Wiccan author Raymond Buckland claims to have been the first to reprint the book in 1968 through his " Buckland Museum of Witchcraft " press , but a British reprint was made by " Wiccens " [ sic ] Charles " Rex <unk> " and Mary Cardell in the early 1960s . Since then the text has been repeatedly reprinted by a variety of different publishers , including as a 1998 retranslation by Mario and Dina Pazzaglini with essays and commentary . 
 = = Contents = = 
 After the eleven @-@ year search , Leland writes that he was unsurprised by the contents of the Vangelo . It was largely what he was expecting , with the exception that he did not predict passages in " prose @-@ poetry " . " I also believe that in this Gospel of the Witches " , comments Leland in the appendix , " we have a trustworthy outline at least of the doctrine and rites observed at [ the witches ' Sabbat ] . They adored forbidden deities and practised forbidden deeds , inspired as much by rebellion against Society as by their own passions . " 
 Leland 's final draft was a slim volume . He organised the material to be included into fifteen chapters , and added a brief preface and an appendix . The published version also included footnotes and , in many places , the original Italian that Leland had translated . Most of the content of Leland 's Aradia is made up of spells , blessings , and rituals , but the text also contains stories and myths which suggest influences from both the ancient Roman religion and Roman Catholicism . Major characters in the myths include the Roman goddess Diana , a sun god called Lucifer , the Biblical Cain as a lunar figure , and the messianic Aradia . The witchcraft of " The Gospel of the Witches " is both a method for casting spells and an anti @-@ hierarchical " counter @-@ religion " to the Catholic church . 
 = = = Themes = = = 
 Entire chapters of Aradia are devoted to rituals and magic spells . These include enchantments to win love ( Chapter VI ) , a conjuration to perform when finding a stone with a hole or a round stone in order to turn it into an amulet for Diana 's favour ( Chapter IV ) , and the consecration of a ritual feast for Diana , Aradia , and Cain ( Chapter II ) . The narrative material makes up less of the text , and is composed of short stories and legends about the birth of the witchcraft religion and the actions of their gods . Leland summarises the mythic material in the book in its appendix , writing " Diana is Queen of the Witches ; an associate of Herodias ( Aradia ) in her relations to sorcery ; that she bore a child to her brother the Sun ( here Lucifer ) ; that as a moon @-@ goddess she is in some relation to Cain , who dwells as prisoner in the moon , and that the witches of old were people oppressed by feudal lands , the former <unk> themselves in every way , and holding orgies to Diana which the Church represented as being the worship of Satan " . Diana is not only the witches ' goddess , but is presented as the primordial <unk> in Chapter III , dividing herself into darkness and light . After giving birth to Lucifer , Diana seduces him while in the form of a cat , eventually giving birth to Aradia , their daughter . Diana demonstrates the power of her witchcraft by creating " the heavens , the stars and the rain " , becoming " Queen of the Witches " . Chapter I presents the original witches as slaves that escaped from their masters , beginning new lives as " thieves and evil folk " . Diana sends her daughter Aradia to them to teach these former serfs witchcraft , the power of which they can use to " destroy the evil race ( of oppressors ) " . Aradia 's students thus became the first witches , who would then continue the worship of Diana . Leland was struck by this cosmogony : " In all other Scriptures of all races , it is the male ... who creates the universe ; in Witch Sorcery it is the female who is the primitive principle " . 
 = = = Structure = = = 
 Aradia is composed of fifteen chapters , the first ten of which are presented as being Leland 's translation of the Vangelo manuscript given to him by Maddalena . This section , while predominantly made up of spells and rituals , is also the source of most of the myths and folktales contained in the text . At the end of Chapter I is the text in which Aradia gives instructions to her followers on how to practice witchcraft . 
 The first ten chapters are not entirely a direct translation of the Vangelo ; Leland offers his own commentary and notes on a number of passages , and Chapter VII is Leland 's incorporation of other Italian folklore material . Medievalist Robert Mathiesen contends that the Vangelo manuscript actually represents even less of Aradia , arguing that only Chapters I , II , and the first half of Chapter IV match Leland 's description of the manuscript 's contents , and suggests that the other material came from different texts collected by Leland through Maddalena . 
 The remaining five chapters are clearly identified in the text as representing other material Leland believed to be relevant to the Vangelo , acquired during his research into Italian witchcraft , and especially while working on his Etruscan Roman Remains and Legends of Florence . The themes in these additional chapters vary in some details from the first ten , and Leland included them partly to " [ confirm ] the fact that the worship of Diana existed for a long time contemporary with Christianity " . Chapter XV , for example , gives an incantation to <unk> , through the use of a deck of playing cards . Leland explains its inclusion by a note that Diana , as portrayed in Aradia , is worshipped by outlaws , and <unk> was the Roman goddess of thievery . Other examples of Leland 's thoughts about the text are given in the book 's preface , appendix , and numerous footnotes . 
 In several places Leland provides the Italian he was translating . According to Mario Pazzaglini , author of the 1999 translation , the Italian contains misspellings , missing words , and grammatical errors , and is in a standardised Italian rather than the local dialect one might expect . Pazzaglini concludes that Aradia represents material translated from dialect to basic Italian and then into English , creating a summary of texts , some of which were mis @-@ recorded . Leland himself called the text a " collection of ceremonies , ' <unk> , ' incantations , and traditions " and described it as an attempt to gather material , " valuable and curious remains of ancient Latin or Etruscan lore " that he feared would be lost . There is no cohesive narrative even in the sections that Leland attributes to the Vangelo . This lack of cohesion , or " inconsistency " , is an argument for the text 's authenticity , according to religious scholar Chas S. Clifton , since the text shows no signs of being " massaged ... for future book buyers . " 
 = = Claims questioned = = 
 Leland wrote that " the witches even yet form a fragmentary secret society or sect , that they call it that of the Old Religion , and that there are in the Romagna entire villages in which the people are completely heathen " . Accepting this , Leland supposed that " the existence of a religion supposes a Scripture , and in this case it may be admitted , almost without severe verification , that the Evangel of the Witches is really a very old work ... in all probability the translation of some early or later Latin work . " 
 Leland 's claim that the manuscript was genuine , and even his assertion that he received such a manuscript , have been called into question . After the 1921 publication of Margaret Murray 's The Witch @-@ cult in Western Europe , which hypothesised that the European witch trials were actually a persecution of a pagan religious survival , American sensationalist author Theda Kenyon 's 1929 book Witches Still Live connected Murray 's thesis with the witchcraft religion in Aradia . Arguments against Murray 's thesis would eventually include arguments against Leland . Witchcraft scholar Jeffrey Russell devoted some of his 1980 book A History of Witchcraft : Sorcerers , Heretics and Pagans to arguing against the claims in Aradia , Murray 's thesis , and Jules Michelet 's 1862 La <unk> , which also theorised that witchcraft represented an underground religion . Historian Elliot Rose 's A Razor for a Goat dismissed Aradia as a collection of incantations unsuccessfully attempting to portray a religion . In his Triumph of the Moon , historian Ronald Hutton summarises the controversy as having three possible extremes : 
 The Vangelo manuscript represents a genuine text from an otherwise undiscovered religion . 
 Maddalena wrote the text , either with or without Leland 's assistance , possibly drawing from her own background with folklore or witchcraft . 
 The entire document was forged by Leland . 
 Hutton himself is a sceptic , not only of the existence of the religion that Aradia claims to represent , but also of the existence of Maddalena , arguing that it is more likely that Leland created the entire story than that Leland could be so easily " duped " by an Italian fortune @-@ teller . Clifton takes exception to Hutton 's position , writing that it amounts to an accusation of " serious literary fraud " made by an " argument from absence " ; one of Hutton 's main objections is that Aradia is unlike anything found in medieval literature . 
 Mathiesen also dismisses this " option three " , arguing that while Leland 's English drafts for the book were heavily edited and revised in the process of writing , the Italian sections , in contrast , were almost untouched except for corrections of " precisely the sort that a proofreader would make as he compared his copy to the original " . This leads Mathiesen to conclude that Leland was working from an extant Italian @-@ language original that he describes as " authentic , but not representative " of any larger folk tradition . Anthropologist Sabina Magliocco examines the " option one " possibility , that Leland 's manuscript represented a folk tradition involving Diana and the Cult of Herodias , in her article Who Was Aradia ? The History and Development of a Legend . Magliocco writes that Aradia " may represent a 19th @-@ century version of [ the legend of the Cult of Herodias ] that incorporated later materials influenced by medieval diabolism : the presence of ' <unk> , ' the Christian devil ; the practice of sorcery ; the naked dances under the full moon . " 
 = = Influence on Wicca and Stregheria = = 
 Magliocco calls Aradia " the first real text of the 20th century Witchcraft revival " , and it is repeatedly cited as being profoundly influential on the development of Wicca . The text apparently corroborates the thesis of Margaret Murray that early modern and Renaissance witchcraft represented a survival of ancient pagan beliefs , and after Gerald Gardner 's claim to have encountered religious witchcraft in 20th @-@ century England , the works of Michelet , Murray , and Leland helped support at least the possibility that such a survival could exist . 
 The Charge of the Goddess , an important piece of liturgy used in Wiccan rituals , was inspired by Aradia 's speech in the first chapter of the book . Parts of the speech appeared in an early version of Gardnerian Wicca ritual . According to Doreen Valiente , one of Gardner 's priestesses , Gardner was surprised by Valiente 's recognising the material as having come from Leland 's book . Valiente subsequently rewrote the passage in both prose and verse , retaining the " traditional " Aradia lines . Some Wiccan traditions use the name Aradia , or Diana , to refer to the Goddess or Queen of the Witches , and Hutton writes that the earliest Gardnerian rituals used the name <unk> , a " garbled " form of Aradia . Hutton further suggests that the reason that Wicca includes <unk> practice , or ritual nudity , is because of a line spoken by Aradia : 
 And as the sign that ye are truly free , 
 Ye shall be naked in your rites , both men 
 And women also : this shall last until 
 The last of your oppressors shall be dead ; 
 Accepting Aradia as the source of this practice , Robert <unk> points to the 1998 Pazzaglini translation of these lines , which read " Men and Women / You will all be naked , until / Yet he shall be dead , the last / Of your oppressors is dead . " <unk> argues that the ritual nudity of Wicca was based upon Leland 's mistranslation of these lines by incorporating the clause " in your rites " . There are , however , earlier mentions of ritual nudity among Italian witches . Historian Ruth Martin states that it was a common practice for witches of Italy to be " naked with their hair loose around their shoulders " while reciting <unk> . Jeffrey Burton Russell notes that " A woman named Marta was tortured in Florence about 1375 : she was alleged to have placed candles round a dish and to have taken off her clothes and stood above the dish in the nude , making magical signs " . Historian Franco <unk> refers to an Italian witch : " Lo and behold : in the first hours of sleep , this woman opens the door to her vegetable garden and comes out completely naked and her hair all undone , and she begins to do and say her various signs and <unk> ... " . 
 The reception of Aradia amongst Neopagans has not been entirely positive . Clifton suggests that modern claims of revealing an Italian pagan witchcraft tradition , for example those of Leo Martello and Raven Grimassi , must be " match [ ed ] against " , and compared with the claims in Aradia . He further suggests that a lack of comfort with Aradia may be due to an " insecurity " within Neopaganism about the movement 's claim to authenticity as a religious revival . Valiente offers another explanation for the negative reaction of some neopagans ; that the identification of Lucifer as the God of the witches in Aradia was " too strong meat " for Wiccans who were used to the gentler , romantic paganism of Gerald Gardner and were especially quick to reject any relationship between witchcraft and Satanism . 
 Clifton writes that Aradia was especially influential for leaders of the Wiccan religious movement in the 1950s and 1960s , but that the book no longer appears on the " reading lists " given by members to newcomers , nor is it extensively cited in more recent Neopagan books . The new translation of the book released in 1998 was introduced by Wiccan author Stewart Farrar , who affirms the importance of Aradia , writing that " Leland 's gifted research into a ' dying ' tradition has made a significant contribution to a living and growing one . " 
 Author Raven Grimassi has written extensively about Aradia in his popularization of Stregheria , presenting what he admits is his own personal rendering of her story . He differs from Leland in many ways , particularly in portraying her as a witch who lived and taught in 14th @-@ century Italy , rather than a goddess . In response to Clifton , he states that similarity or dissimilarity to Leland 's Aradia material cannot be a measure of authenticity , since Leland 's material itself is disputed . 
 Therefore it cannot effectively be used to discredit other writings or views on Italian witchcraft , nor is it a representative ethnographic foundation against which other writings or views " must " be compared . The Aradia material is , unfortunately , a disputed text with problems of its own when compared to the usually accepted folklore , folk traditions , and folk magic practices of Italy . 
 He agrees with Valiente that the major objection of Neopagans to this material is its " inclusion of negative stereotypes related to witches and witchcraft " , and suggests that comparisons between this material and religious witchcraft are " regarded as an insult by many neo @-@ pagans " . 
 = University of Michigan basketball scandal = 
 The University of Michigan basketball scandal or Ed Martin scandal was a series of National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) rules violations that resulted in a six @-@ year investigation of the relationship between the University of Michigan , its men 's basketball program , and basketball team booster Ed Martin . As a result of the investigation , the Wolverine men 's basketball program was punished with sanctions . The violations principally involved payments booster Martin made to several players to launder money from an illegal gambling operation . It is one of the largest incidents involving payments to college athletes in American collegiate history . An initial investigation by the school was joined by the NCAA , Big Ten Conference , Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) , and the United States Department of Justice ( DOJ ) . 
 The case began when the investigation of an automobile accident during Mateen Cleaves 's 1996 recruiting trip revealed a curious relationship between Martin and the Wolverine basketball program dating back to the 1980s . Several Michigan basketball players were implicated over the next few years and by 1999 some were called before a federal grand jury . Four eventual professional basketball players — Chris Webber , Maurice Taylor , Robert Traylor and Louis Bullock — were discovered to have borrowed a total of $ 616 @,@ 000 from Martin . During the investigation , Webber claimed not to have had any financial relationship with Martin , but eventually confessed to taking loans from Martin . He was both fined in the legal system and briefly suspended by the National Basketball Association after performing public service . 
 In 1997 , coach Steve Fisher was fired for his involvement in violations relating to the scandal . Subsequently , the NCAA investigation did not find him culpable of significant wrongdoing related to the scandal . By the fall of 2002 , it was obvious that the four players were in fact guilty of taking money from Martin , and had thus compromised their amateur status . In response , Michigan placed the basketball program on two years ' probation . It also withdrew from postseason consideration for the 2002 – 03 season , vacated all or part of five past seasons and removed the players ' names and achievements from its record book . A few months later , the NCAA accepted these punishments , doubled both the probation period and the post @-@ season ineligibility , penalized the school one scholarship for four seasons , and ordered Michigan to disassociate from the three living guilty players until 2012 ( Webber 's ban extended through 2013 , and a fourth player included in this sanction , Traylor , has since died ) . The punishment cost the 2002 – 2003 team its post @-@ season eligibility , cost past teams the 1997 National Invitation Tournament and the 1998 Big Ten Tournament championships as well as appearances in the 1992 and 1993 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament Final Fours . It cost Chris Webber his All @-@ American 1993 honors , Traylor his MVP awards in the 1997 NIT and 1998 Big Ten Tournament , as well as Bullock 's standing as the school 's third all @-@ time leading scorer and all @-@ time leader in free throws and the Big Ten 's all @-@ time leader in 3 @-@ point field goals ( surpassed in 2011 ) . The additional year of post @-@ season ineligibility was overturned on appeal . Mandatory <unk> with the surviving players ended on May 8 , 2013 .

 In the early morning of February 17 , 1996 , a Ford Explorer driven by either Taylor or Traylor , depending on the source , went out of control while returning along M @-@ 14 from a party in Detroit , 40 miles ( 64 km ) east of Michigan 's campus in Ann Arbor . Among the passengers was high school star Mateen Cleaves , who was on his official recruiting visit . When an investigation revealed that the trip included a visit to Ed Martin 's home , the University investigated his relationship with the basketball program . Martin was reportedly returning to Ann Arbor from Detroit with Traylor , Taylor , Cleaves , Willie Mitchell , Bullock , and Ron Oliver after a party that included drugs , strippers and alcohol . Accounts of the party vary . By some accounts the party was hosted by Martin , but by other accounts Martin 's house was a stop on the way to a party at Detroit 's Westin Hotel . Martin , a retired Ford Motor Company electrician , provided all the players with money . During the rollover accident , Traylor broke his arm and was lost for the season . Mitchell transferred from Michigan to the University of Alabama @-@ Birmingham after his junior season ( 1995 – 1996 ) . Bullock , Cleaves ( who eventually signed with rival Michigan State ) , Taylor , and Traylor all went on to be drafted by National Basketball Association ( NBA ) teams . Bullock played in various foreign leagues but never in the NBA . 
 The NCAA uses a statute of limitations of four years . Thus , at any time the NCAA can open or re @-@ open an investigation for an infraction occurring within the last four years . However , NCAA convention is to date violations based on when they learned about the infraction . Thus , events that had occurred far more than four years prior to the investigation came under its purview . The initial accident reports revealed several inconsistencies and violations that induced expanded investigation . 
 Michigan admitted to the secondary NCAA violation of transporting a recruit more than 30 miles ( 48 km ) from campus . Questions were immediately raised about whether Taylor actually owned the sport utility vehicle . The NCAA asked for leasing documentation of Taylor 's vehicle and Michigan investigated the registrations of its players ' vehicles . The University soon required that all the vehicles driven by its players be part of a special vehicle registration program . 
 = = Martin 's relationship with the program = = 
 In March 1997 , Michigan and the Big Ten released the results of an investigation of Martin 's relationship with the school . The investigation determined that Martin had nurtured a relationship that involved some minor violations . The violations that were published were that Martin was present at a recruit 's home during a visit by head coach Fisher ; and he 'd given a U @-@ M player a birthday cake . Fisher prevented Martin from committing serious additional violations by keeping him from placing a deposit on an apartment for a player . He also stopped Martin from buying airplane tickets for another player 's family . A second October 1997 private investigation also failed to reveal any large violations .

 Martin befriended Perry Watson , coach for Southwestern High School of Detroit , and provided gifts to the team 's players . When Michigan 's Bill Frieder recruited a Southwestern High School prospect , Martin was present . Martin then began attending Michigan games with the prospect 's father when the student enrolled . Martin also attended games and practices with Watson . Martin also developed a relationship with George Raveling who regularly recruited from Detroit high schools for the Iowa Hawkeyes . He also received complimentary tickets to Iowa games while Raveling was coach . Martin attempted to give gifts and cash to Frieder recruit Terry Mills . 
 After Frieder left Michigan in 1989 , Martin immediately formed an equally close relationship with his successor , Fisher . Martin gave Fisher 's family gifts . 
 = = = Webber = = = 
 Martin noticed Webber during a middle school game . Martin attended Webber 's church , where Webber 's father was deacon and began fostering a relationship by making frequent visits to the Webber family home . Between 1988 and 1993 Martin gave Webber about $ 280 @,@ 000 . Eventually , Webber would confess to having received and repaid only $ 38 @,@ 200 , an amount identified via a specific transaction tied to Webber . 
 = = = 1990s = = = 
 In September 1996 , athletic director Joe Roberson learned that during the previous month Martin had tried to place deposits on apartments for Traylor and Louis Bullock . Martin had also offered airline tickets to Bullock 's parents so they could attend a tournament in Puerto Rico . It emerged that Fisher had known about Martin 's actions at the time . While Fisher had ordered the deposits retrieved and made sure the tickets weren 't used , he didn 't tell anyone in the athletic or compliance offices , as he was required to do . As a result of Roberson 's findings , he ordered interviews of the basketball team and team coaches . 
 The March 1997 Big Ten report showed that official University phone records documented that the coaching staff called Martin 's home 39 times . Between the 1991 – 92 and the 1993 – 94 seasons , records showed that Martin received 97 tickets to Michigan basketball games either for free or under his special arrangement to have tickets made available for purchase . Watson joined the Michigan basketball coaching staff in 1991 . The October 1997 investigation revealed that Fisher had provided Martin with passes for sixteen complimentary tickets from 1994 to 1997 , and that his secretary and other clerical workers made out ten more such passes . In addition , six passes were signed with the PW initials of departed coach Watson . Watson denied making such passes available and a handwriting analysis matched five of the six to Fisher . Fisher was fired when the investigation became public on October 10 , 1997 , just a week before the start of basketball practices . 
 In June 1997 , the Detroit Free Press revealed sources that claimed both Chris Webber and Taylor had received at least $ 100 @,@ 000 from Martin , but that Webber had repaid the money after turning pro . A pattern of Martin befriending young basketball stars eventually became clear . Martin paid $ 280 @,@ 000 to Webber from 1988 ( when he was a ninth @-@ grader at Detroit Country Day School ) to 1993 ( his sophomore year at Michigan , after which he turned pro ) . Martin also befriended Traylor as a freshman in high school . Martin was at Traylor 's home when Fisher made a recruiting visit . Between 1994 ( his senior year at Murray @-@ Wright High School in Detroit ) and 1998 ( his junior year at Michigan , after which he turned pro ) , Martin gave Traylor about $ 160 @,@ 000 . Martin befriended Taylor when he was in high school . Between 1995 and 1998 ( during his time at Michigan ) , Martin gave Taylor about $ 105 @,@ 000 . Since Bullock went to high school in Maryland , he did not know Martin before coming to Michigan . Martin gave Bullock about $ 71 @,@ 000 during his four years at Michigan which ended in 1999 . 
 Roberson also learned that during the 1992 Final Four , Fisher made two of the limited supply of team rooms available to Martin . Martin gave one hotel room paid for by Michigan to Webber 's father — a violation of NCAA rules . For his part , Martin denied any wrongdoing when questioned by an NCAA enforcement representative . However , he later refused to cooperate with the University or the NCAA , forcing Michigan to ban him from any contact with the athletic program in March 1997 . 
 = = Raid and subpoenas = = 
 After the Michigan / Big Ten investigation and the private investigation , no serious violations arose . For example , Robert Traylor , Chris Webber , Jalen Rose , and Maurice Taylor were cleared in October 1997 . In April 1999 , the FBI and IRS raided several Detroit @-@ area homes to stop a numbers game operation in the area 's Ford plants . Martin 's home was one of the targets ; on April 28 , he was found with a loaded gun , gambling records and $ 20 @,@ 000 in cash in his home . The authorities were investigating Martin 's alleged numbers game operation at Ford plants and whether Martin had provided Michigan basketball players with money and gifts . Another item that they seized was a Western Union <unk> from Martin to Traylor . In the course of a federal investigation , evidence turned up that Martin had given cash payments and other benefits to several Michigan players and Detroit @-@ area high school prospects starting in the early 1980s . As a result of the investigations , in May 1999 a federal grand jury subpoenaed several Michigan basketball players to investigate the relationship between Martin and the basketball program . 
 Former Michigan basketball player Albert White was implicated in early investigations for having accepted US $ 37 @,@ 000 , but he was not named in later indictments . It was not clear how much of the money White received directly and how much was given to his friends and family to influence his decision to attend Michigan . Although White was one of several players captured on federal wiretaps and interviewed by both the FBI and IRS , he cooperated fully and did not need to hire a lawyer . Although he was not implicated , he transferred from Michigan to play for the Missouri Tigers men 's basketball team after clashing with Steve Fisher .

 = = = Ed Martin = = = 
 In late 1999 , Martin originally agreed to a plea bargain in which he agreed to disclose information about the payments . The agreement with the United States Attorney 's office , whose Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard <unk> led the prosecution case against Martin , was nearly finalized in January 2000 . The paperwork for the plea agreement was to be finalized in March 2000 for the former Ford Motor Company employee to plead guilty to one count of federal gambling and one count of income tax evasion . He and his son , Carlton , backed out in May 2000 , preferring to take their chances at trial due to the likelihood of light punishment for first @-@ time offenders . Under the plea agreement in which they would have forfeited $ 100 @,@ 000 and faced 6 – 15 months in prison , they would have been able to keep their homes . If found guilty at trial , they could have received up to 5 years imprisonment and a fine of $ 250 @,@ 000 per count , but they would not have to agree to cooperate with the University investigation . 
 Less than a week after Martin backed out of his plea agreement , several former players were subpoenaed to testify before grand juries . In August 2000 , Traylor and Bullock , by this time professional basketball players in the NBA and Italy respectively , were confirmed to have taken payments from Martin . Many of the payments came after the 1997 banning of Martin from contact with the team and the firing of Steve Fisher . The two players cooperated with federal authorities and admitted to receiving money . Traylor , Bullock , Webber , Rose and Taylor all testified before the grand jury . Fisher , the current San Diego State University coach , testified before a federal grand jury investigating Martin . Also testifying were former Michigan assistants Perry Watson , Brian Dutcher and Scott Perry . Martin and Watson had been close friends when Watson was head coach at Detroit Southwestern High School , with Martin often sitting on the bench along with assistant coaches . Perry , who had arranged Cleaves ' recruiting trip , had known Martin since 1977 and coached under Fisher from 1993 – 1997 . Many players and observers believed Martin was Watson 's uncle , leading to Martin 's schoolyard nickname of " Uncle Ed . " Martin and Watson had a falling @-@ out in the early 1990s , shortly after Watson joined the Michigan staff . Webber 's father also gave sealed testimony before the grand jury . 
 On March 21 , 2002 — after almost three years of testimony — the grand jury returned an eight @-@ count indictment charging Martin , his wife Hilda and their friend Clarence Malvo with running an illegal gambling business at the Ford River Rouge plant , money laundering and conspiracy to launder money . According to the indictment , Martin made illicit loans totalling $ 616 @,@ 000 to Webber , Taylor , Bullock and Traylor to launder money from an illegal numbers game at Detroit – area auto plants . The loans were made with the understanding that they would be repaid once the players turned pro . Martin was indicted for having paid Webber a total of $ 280 @,@ 000 between 1988 – 1993 , which included time from Webber 's freshman year at Detroit Country Day School in Birmingham , Michigan to his sophomore year at Michigan . 
 Martin , his wife , Hilda , and Clarence Malvo were under federal indictment for conspiracy to engage in illegal gambling and could have faced up to five years in prison and a $ 250 @,@ 000 fine if convicted . Mr. Martin had also been charged with seven additional counts : having an illegal gambling business , conspiracy to launder money , three counts of laundering money and two counts of using money from illegal activities . The charge against Hilda Martin was dropped as part of a plea agreement . On April 8 , 2002 , Malvo pleaded guilty to grand jury perjury for testifying that he did not work for Martin . On May 28 , 2002 Martin pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to launder money . He agreed to cooperate with investigations by the government , Michigan and the NCAA . The other seven charges against Martin were dropped in addition to those against Hilda . Furthermore , Martin was barred from associating with the team by a ban , which made any continuing financial relationship with him in violation of NCAA rules and to be considered a new violation . 
 = = = Chris Webber = = = 
 In September 2002 , Webber was indicted on five charges , including obstruction of justice and lying to a federal grand jury , for having misrepresented his relationship with Martin . Each charge was punishable by five years in prison and a $ 250 @,@ 000 fine . He vowed to fight the charges . 
 Martin pleaded guilty to running an illegal lottery at the Ford Motors plant he worked at to provide proceeds for the players . Martin testified that he paid Webber $ 280 @,@ 000 in cash and gifts , but as of January 2003 Webber denied receipt of money from Martin and maintained that he had testified truthfully to a grand jury in 2000 on such matters . Martin stated that there was always an understanding that the money would be repaid after the players became professionals . In the 2000 grand jury investigation , Webber had been asked about whether his off @-@ campus apartment rent had been paid by Martin and whether he had received spending money , jewelry , clothing or a stereo . Webber generally responded by saying either that he could not recall or that he did not think he had received such gifts . However , prosecutors say that Webber , after turning professional , gave Martin ' ' a significant sum of money , in cash , as a partial repayment . ' ' In December 2002 , Webber 's father admitted he had accepted gifts and a small loan from Martin , which contradicted earlier statements . Prosecutors also accused Webber 's aunt of lying about a meeting she had with Martin in the updated filing . 
 Chris Webber , his father , <unk> Webber , and aunt , Charlene Johnson , were also indicted on charges of having lied to a federal grand jury regarding dealings with Martin . The University had attempted three previous investigations and was not successful at gathering enough evidence to proceed further until the federal government got involved . In January 2003 , the federal prosecutors filed more detailed indictments against Webber and his relatives for obstruction of justice and perjury . 
 Ed Martin died of a suspected pulmonary embolism on February 14 , 2003 . He was awaiting sentencing at the time of his death . Malvo , who confessed to taking bets and paying off winning wagers for Martin , pleaded guilty April 8 , 2002 to lying before a federal grand jury . He admitted to telling a grand jury in October 1999 that he bet money but did not work for Martin . He was sentenced in August 2002 to two years ' probation . 
 Martin 's death largely took the air out of the federal perjury case against Webber . In July 2003 , on the day before jury selection in the case was due to begin , Webber pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of criminal contempt in order to avoid a possible jail sentence . He admitted to having received and repaid $ 38 @,@ 200 . The deal was subject to a discretionary fine and possible classification of the infraction as a felony by the United States District Court Judge Nancy Edmunds who would rule in September 2003 . In exchange for the plea all other charges were dropped against him as were all charges against his father . The charges against Webber 's aunt had been dropped after Martin 's death .

 = = = Self @-@ imposed = = = 
 By the fall of 2002 , it had become clear that Michigan 's basketball program was guilty of major violations . In response , Michigan decided to impose its own sanctions on the program . Initially , Michigan announced it would forfeit every game in which the four players appeared . On November 7 , 2002 ; Michigan president Mary Sue Coleman and athletic director Bill Martin announced that the school was imposing sanctions of its own on the basketball program . Among them : 
 No postseason play in 2002 – 03 , even though the players who took Martin 's money were no longer at the school . 
 The school vacated the entire 1992 – 93 season and every game it played from the 1995 – 96 season through the 1998 – 99 season . This included the 1997 National Invitation Tournament title and the 1998 Big Ten Tournament title . It also vacated its two Final Four games in 1992 and its entire NCAA tournament record in 1993 , 1996 and 1998 . There is a difference between forfeiting a game and vacating a game ; a vacated game does not result in the other school being credited with a win . This included virtually the entire career of Fisher 's successor , Brian Ellerbe . However , it did not include all games that Webber played or was eligible because all but the final two games of his freshman year were retained . 
 Returning $ 450 @,@ 000 received from the NCAA for postseason play in 1992 , 1993 , 1996 and 1998 
 Banners commemorating the 1992 and 1993 Final Four runs , the 1997 NIT title and 1998 Big Ten Tournament title would be removed from the rafters at Crisler Arena . 
 Two years ' probation . 
 Coleman described what happened as " wrong , plain and simple . " She also said , " I am determined that nothing like this will ever happen again at Michigan . " 
 At 8 : 00 A.M. that same day , the four banners were removed from the rafters . Four days later , the athletic department officially deleted all mention of Webber , Taylor , Traylor and Bullock from the school 's athletic records . These included Traylor 's MVP awards in the 1997 NIT and 1998 Big Ten Tournament , as well as Bullock 's standing as the Big Ten 's all @-@ time leader in 3 @-@ point field goals and the school 's third all @-@ time leading scorer and all @-@ time leader free throws made . The deletions came because the payments may have compromised their amateur status . Several players not implicated in the scandal continue to be listed among the school 's honorees such as Rob Pelinka ( Walter Byers Scholarship , 1993 ) , Juwan Howard and Jalen Rose ( All @-@ American , 1994 ) and <unk> Ward ( Big Ten All @-@ Tournament Team , 1998 ) . 
 Michigan finished the 2002 – 2003 season with a 17 – 13 record , but sat out both that year 's NCAA and NIT tournaments due to the self @-@ imposed postseason ban . 
 = = = NCAA = = = 
 On May 8 , 2003 ; the NCAA accepted Michigan 's sanctions . It also imposed an additional two years of probation and docked the school one scholarship a year from 2004 – 2005 until 2007 – 2008 . It also ordered the school to disassociate itself from Traylor ( who has since died ) , Taylor and Bullock until 2012 , and Webber until 2013 . The NCAA also barred Michigan from postseason play for the 2003 – 04 season ( later overturned on appeal ) . Infractions committee chairman Thomas Yeager , who had come very close to imposing the " death penalty " on the University of Alabama football program a few months earlier , called the Martin / Michigan affair " one of the three or four most egregious violations of NCAA bylaws " ever . The disassociation meant that Michigan could not accept donations or recruiting assistance from any of the players for ten years . Webber 's sanction ended on May 8 , 2013 . The NCAA criticized Fisher for allowing Martin access to the program , but did not sanction him . The University announced its intention to appeal the additional one @-@ year suspension from post @-@ season play . As a result of the sanctions , Ellerbe 's successor , Tommy Amaker , received a four @-@ year contract extension to compensate for the duties while under probation , and Bernard Robinson , Jr. had the right to transfer without sitting out a year because , as the only scholarship senior , the ineligibility extended for his entire remaining scholarship tenure .

 In September 2003 , the NCAA reversed its decision to add a second year of postseason ineligibility after hearing an appeal by the University ; the Wolverines went on to become champions of the 2004 National Invitation Tournament . Also in September 2003 , Judge Edmunds deferred sentencing until she could monitor Webber 's service of 300 hours of community service at a middle @-@ school literacy program for two summers that she ordered . The literacy program is a six @-@ week program and Webber was expected to work at least 150 hours each summer . Also in September the University announced it sought $ 695 @,@ 000 in restitution from Webber . Webber was the only involved athlete that the University sought restitution from in part because he was the only one who confessed to lying to a grand jury . Webber stated that he did not feel the University 's request was appropriate because he had not stolen from the University . 
 During the 2003 @-@ 04 NBA season , Webber was on the disabled list until February . When he returned , the NBA suspended him for three games for his guilty plea . In September 2005 , Judge Edmunds ruled that the conviction should be treated as a misdemeanor and that Webber should pay the maximum fine for such an offense , which was $ 100 @,@ 000 . This ruling came after Webber served 330 hours of public service and accumulated $ 78 @,@ 000 of related out @-@ of @-@ pocket expenses . 
 The Michigan High School Athletic Association ( MHSAA ) , following the release of court testimony , requested that Webber 's high school , Detroit Country Day ( DCD ) , forfeit the three state titles won with Webber in the lineup ( 1989 – 91 ) . DCD conducted its own investigation , then called a press conference on March 2 , 2004 , to announce there was no " credible evidence " Webber 's amateur status had been violated . When the MHSAA gave them the option of forfeiting games Webber played they decided not to . Traylor 's alma mater , Murray @-@ Wright High , forfeited its entire 1994 – 95 season — Traylor 's senior year .

If any of those guys are interested in meeting with me , that would be great . " Both Bullock and Taylor immediately stated that they look forward to their re @-@ affiliation with the university . At the stroke of midnight when the disassociation ended , Webber tweeted " OK ! ! ! " 
 There were many vocal opinions on what should happen following the end of the disassociation . An article on Bleacher Report stated that the University should retire Webber 's Jersey . When asked whether the National finalist banners would ever be rehung , University President Mary Sue Coleman said not during her tenure , but she noted that " Some day , I won 't be president anymore , and maybe someone else will have a different view " .

 When Bart complains he never gets any mail , Marge gives him the family 's junk mail . One piece contains a credit card application , which Bart fills out under the name of his dog Santa 's Little Helper , whom he claims to have the occupation " butt doctor " . The company misreads the name as " Santos L. Halper " , and the credit card application is approved . Before long , Bart receives a credit card . Bart goes on a shopping spree , buying the family some very expensive gifts from a mail order catalog : Vancouver smoked salmon and a radio @-@ frying pan for Marge , a golf shirt with corporate logo for Homer , " Trucker 's Choice Stay @-@ Alert Capsules " for Lisa and many things for himself . The item that Bart anticipates the most is a finely @-@ bred , pre @-@ trained collie . Not letting its US $ 1 @,@ 200 purchase price stand in the way , Bart promptly orders one . Upon its arrival Bart learns the dog 's name is Laddie , who has been trained to perform a wide variety of tasks . The rest of the family fall in love with the new dog , while Santa 's Little Helper goes unnoticed . 
 Bart fails to pay off " Santos L. Halper 's " credit card bill , and it is not long before he gets a call from a debt collection agency demanding payment . When the calls and collection letters persist , Bart enlists Laddie to help him bury his ill @-@ gotten credit card . Later , repo men arrive to take back all of the things Bart has purchased .

At the ceremony honoring Laddie 's heroism , Chief Wiggum decides that Laddie would make the perfect police dog . Bart gives him to the Springfield police force and is forced to explain why the family now has no dog at all , while sobbing .

 The episode uses the full opening sequence because the story came out short . Despite this , a large sequence was cut from the middle of the episode , with half of the episode having to be re @-@ written after the animatic had been finished . The main plot of the episode came from an original idea that the family would be issued a credit card in the name " Hobart Simpson " and that Bart would use that . An original side @-@ story was that Lisa would become addicted to the " Trucker 's Choice " pep pills . Originally , instead of going to the dog park , the family took Laddie to a waterfall and he performed a series of dives , but it was scrapped as it had already been proven that Laddie was a form of " <unk> " . Likewise , Laddie rescuing Baby Gerald was originally a complicated rescue scene , but was cut into showing the aftermath . 
 Laddie was designed to resemble a real dog . The catalog Bart uses is a combination of the Lillian Vernon catalog and The Sharper Image . The opening stemmed from the fact that the show had not had a sequence where the family received mail , and the writers wanted to create a joke about the different types of mail each of the family get . After Bart 's " dog burning " fantasy , when he hears a ship 's horn in the distance , there was originally going to be a faint cry of " more dogs " , but it was deemed that it took the joke too far . Hank Azaria ad @-@ libbed the entire sequence during the credits in which Chief Wiggum and Lou sing along to " Jammin ' " . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The title is a reference to the novel and film The Caine Mutiny . The dog " Laddie " is a play on Lassie , in terms of name , appearance and uncanny intelligence . Marge listens to the song " You Really Got Me " by The Kinks played on the frying pan radio . At the end of the episode , the song " Jamming " by Bob Marley is played . The design of the " Repo Depot " is based very loosely on the repossession agency from Repo Man . The address of Mr. Mitchell 's house 57 Mt . <unk> Street is one of addresses of the Harvard Lampoon . Mr. Mitchell having a dead parrot that he believes to still be alive is a reference to the " Dead Parrot " Monty Python sketch .

 In its original broadcast , " The Canine Mutiny " finished 43rd in ratings for the week of April 7 – 13 , 1997 , with a Nielsen rating of 8 @.@ 1 , equivalent to approximately 7 @.@ 9 million viewing households . It was the fourth highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , following The X @-@ Files , King of the Hill , and Beverly Hills , 90210 . 
 The episode 's ending with Chief Wiggum and Lou singing along to " Jamming ' " by Bob Marley is often cited as one of the best endings in the history of the show . The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , called it " A sweet episode " . Homer 's line " There , there , shut up boy " is one of Josh Weinstein 's favorites .

Wittelsbach was the first capital ship built under the Navy Law of 1898 , brought about by Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz . 
 The ship served in the I Squadron of the German fleet for the majority of her career . Wittelsbach was rapidly superseded by new " all @-@ big @-@ gun " warships , and as a result served for less than eight years before being decommissioned on 20 September 1910 . After the start of World War I in August 1914 , Wittelsbach was brought back to active duty in the IV Battle Squadron . The ship saw limited duty in the Baltic Sea against Russian forces , though the threat from British submarines forced the ship to withdraw by 1916 . The ship then saw service in a number of auxiliary roles , ultimately as a tender for minesweepers after 1919 . In July 1921 , however , the ship was sold and broken up for scrap metal .

 Wittelsbach was 126 @.@ 8 m ( 416 ft 0 in ) long overall and had a beam of 22 @.@ 8 m ( 74 ft 10 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 95 m ( 26 ft 1 in ) forward . The ship was powered by three 3 @-@ cylinder vertical triple expansion engines that drove three screws . Steam was provided by six naval and six cylindrical coal @-@ fired water @-@ tube boilers . Wittelsbach 's powerplant was rated at 14 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 13 @,@ 808 ihp ; 10 @,@ 297 kW ) , which generated a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . She had a crew of 30 officers and 650 enlisted men . 
 Wittelsbach 's armament consisted of a main battery of four 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) SK L / 40 guns in twin gun turrets , one fore and one aft of the central superstructure . Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 inch ) SK L / 40 guns and twelve 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 45 in ) SK L / 30 quick @-@ firing guns . The armament suite was rounded out with six 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , all in above @-@ water swivel mounts . Her armored belt was 225 millimeters ( 8 @.@ 9 in ) thick in the central portion that protected her magazines and machinery spaces , and the deck was 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick . The main battery turrets had 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) of armor plating . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Wittelsbach 's keel was laid in 1899 , at the Kaiserliche Werft in Wilhelmshaven , under construction number 25 . She was ordered under the contract name " C " , as a new unit for the fleet . The vessel was the first battleship built under the direction of State Secretary Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz , according to the terms of the Navy Law of 1898 . Wittelsbach was launched on 3 July 1900 and commissioned on 15 October 1902 . 
 Upon commissioning in 1902 , Wittelsbach was assigned to the I Squadron of the Active Battle Fleet . In 1905 the German fleet was reorganized into two squadrons of battleships . Wittelsbach was assigned to the I Division of I Squadron . The ship was joined by her sisters Wettin and Zähringen . The German fleet consisted of another three @-@ ship division in the I Squadron and 2 three @-@ ship divisions in the II Squadron . This was supported by a cruiser division , composed of two armored cruisers and six protected cruisers . That year , Kapitän zur See Maximilian von Spee , who would go on to command the East Asia Squadron at the outbreak of World War I , took command of the ship . 
 In 1907 , the newest Deutschland @-@ class battleships were beginning to enter service . This provided the Navy with enough ships to form two full battle squadrons of eight ships each . The fleet was then renamed the Hochseeflotte ( High Seas Fleet ) . Wittelsbach served in the I Division until 20 September 1910 . The ship was then decommissioned and placed in reserve ; her crew was then sent to man the newly commissioned dreadnought Posen . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 At the start of World War I , Wittelsbach was mobilized as part of the IV Battle Squadron , under the command of Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt . Starting on 3 September , the IV Squadron , assisted by the armored cruiser Blücher , conducted a sweep into the Baltic . The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle . In May 1915 , Wittelsbach and the rest of IV Squadron was transferred to support the German Army in the Baltic Sea area . Wittelsbach and her sisters were then based in Kiel . On 6 May , the IV Squadron ships were tasked with providing support to the assault on Libau . Wittelsbach and the other ships were stationed off Gotland to intercept any Russian cruisers that might attempt to intervene in the landings ; the Russians , however , did not do so . On 10 May , after the invasion force had entered Libau , the British submarines HMS E1 and HMS E9 spotted the IV Squadron , but were too far away to attack them . 
 By 1916 , the threat from submarines in the Baltic convinced the German navy to withdraw the elderly Wittelsbach @-@ class ships from active service . Wittelsbach was initially used as a training ship based in Kiel . The ship was then transferred to Wilhelmshaven for use as a fleet tender . Wittelsbach was converted into a depot ship in 1919 for minesweepers in the newly constituted Reichsmarine . She carried 12 of these shallow draft vessels . The ship served in this capacity for little more than a year ; on 8 March 1921 , Wittelsbach was stricken from the Navy List and sold four months later , on 7 July , for 3 @,@ 561 @,@ 000 Marks . The ship was then broken up for scrap in Wilhelmshaven .

 Lana Crawford is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours , played by Bridget Neval . The actress 's casting was announced in June 2004 , and she stated that she was excited to take on the role of Lana , a schoolgirl and the serial 's first lesbian character . Neval explained that Lana 's sexuality did not bother her , but she hoped her story would not be told in a sensationalist or distasteful way . Neval made her first screen appearance as Lana during the episode broadcast on 30 August 2004 . 
 Lana was a student , who had been closeted due to homophobic bullying at her high school . Upon moving to Erinsborough , Lana befriended Serena Bishop ( Lara Sacher ) and her cousin Sky Mangel ( Stephanie McIntosh ) , who she developed a crush on . The storyline between Lana and Sky was billed as a relationship story between two close female friends , " made compelling by the complexity of the feelings involved . " Lana and Sky 's friendship eventually culminated in Neighbours ' first lesbian kiss . 
 The episode featuring the kiss was broadcast in the serial 's regular G @-@ rated timselot and gave Neighbours a small increase in ratings . However , it led talkback callers and conservative groups to attack the storyline and the characters . Writers for AfterEllen and the Sydney Star Observer branded the storyline " a real television advance " and praised Lana and her journey .

 In June 2004 , Pete Timbs of TV Week reported Wicked Science actress Bridget Neval had joined the cast of Neighbours as Lana Crawford . Timbs revealed that Lana was a schoolgirl set to " liven things up among the Ramsay Street teenagers as she comes to terms with her sexuality . " Neval told Timbs ' colleague Helen <unk> that she was initially taken aback when she learned of the character she might be asked to play . However , she was very excited to take on the role of Lana , calling her " a fantastic character " . 
 Neval later explained " My initial reaction to the part was surprise as Neighbours have never had a gay character . But the nature of the character never really bothered me . My only real concern was that the story would not be told in a sensationalist or distasteful way . She 's not a stereotypical character and being gay is certainly not the only interesting thing about her . " Neval made her first screen appearance as Lana during the episode broadcast on 30 August 2004 .

 Lana was introduced as Neighbours ' first lesbian character . Neval revealed that while Lana would fuel a storyline for established character Sky Mangel ( Stephanie McIntosh ) , she would also go through her own journey . A representative from Grundy Television explained that the storyline would be " a relationship story of a close female friendship , made compelling by the complexity of the feelings involved . " The representative believed the storyline would " strike a chord " with teenage viewers , who could relate to Sky and Lana 's feelings . Scriptwriter Helen <unk> also stated that Lana 's story is " multi @-@ faceted " , saying , " On one level it 's about a young girl coming to terms with her sexuality , which on its own might have been a bit boring and gratuitous , but it also brought into play other story strands which added depth and dimension . " 
 Lana was a " pretty " Canadian high school student . She left her old high school due to homophobic bullying , and as a result she became " very closeted " . Describing the character , Natasha Norton from AfterEllen stated " She comes across at first as a touch flighty , as if she can 't quite make up her mind as to who she wants to be , but it soon becomes abundantly clear that Lana 's carefully constructed façade has a purpose . " Following her arrival in Erinsborough , Lana befriended Serena Bishop ( Lara Sacher ) . They both learned that they had been taken advantage of by " sleazy " photographer Chris Cousens ( Simon Mallory ) . Serena 's cousin , Sky , took an instant dislike to Lana . Sky had learned that Lana had flirted with her boyfriend , leaving her " less than impressed " . During a game of basketball , Sky began feuding with Lana , and they started a brawl on the court . Of filming the fight , Neval stated , " We wanted to make it look spontaneous , and really gritty and <unk> . It was a lot of fun learning how to choreograph a fight and how to be aware of the other actor and not actually hurt them . " 
 After being placed in detention together , Lana and Sky came to know each other better . They gradually formed a bond , and Lana developed feelings for Sky . Lana 's crush on Sky eventually culminated in Neighbours ' first lesbian kiss . The episode featuring the kiss was broadcast in its usual 6.30pm G @-@ rated timeslot . The executive producer of Neighbours , Ric Pellizzeri , said the storyline reflected reality and continued the show 's move toward more contemporary issues . Pellizzeri explained that Neighbours was simply telling " a story about tolerance . " The producer added that the kiss was as far as they would go , but the writers would not be discouraged from telling other stories about homosexuality in the future . On @-@ screen , Sky told Lana that she was only interested in her boyfriend , but they remained friends . With her main storyline completed , Lana was seen attending the prom with a female admirer , before moving to Canada with her family . Script producer Luke Devenish told a reporter for the Sydney Star Observer , " There is that great tradition that the lesbian is always dead in the final scene , and we were very aware of that as we were writing her out . We wanted to avoid that at all costs . "

 Shortly after the episode featuring the kiss was aired , the characters were attacked by talkback callers and conservative groups who thought that they had been " <unk> a high @-@ risk culture " and " making homosexuality look cool " . Chief executive of the Christian group Salt Shakers , Peter Stokes , told The Age 's Kenneth Nguyen , " It just saddens me that we give our young people the message that these relationships are OK . " However , Ray Misson , the head of Melbourne University 's arts education department , described the serial 's depiction of a lesbian as " a real advance . " Neval believed that gay teenagers , who were already feeling insecure about how their sexuality would be accepted , would be devastated by the negative reaction surrounding the storyline . 
 On the reaction the kiss between Lana and Sky received , Natasha Norton from AfterEllen stated , " From the amount of backlash this kiss generated in Australia , you 'd think that they 'd shown a full blown love scene ; newspapers have been full of angry letters to the editor decrying the gay storyline . The negative reaction by many in the Australia press mirrors Lana 's current storyline on Neighbours , which explores the backlash Lana experiences when her sexuality becomes public knowledge at her high school . " Norton 's colleague , Malinda Lo , later said that many of the website 's readers said Lana 's storyline had a " profound effect " on them when they were teenagers . A writer from GayNZ.com noted that the episode featuring the kiss was broadcast unedited and provided Neighbours with a modest ratings increase . 
 Bill <unk> from Australian Family Association believed Lana 's introduction and storyline was just an attempt to increase ratings . A Sydney Star Observer reporter praised Lana 's cousin , Sindi , for being sympathetic and reacting in a positive way when Lana came out to her . The reporter also praised Sky 's reaction for being " more let 's talk about it than get away from me , you <unk> freak " , while adding that it seemed Neighbours had wanted Lana to be a " sympathetic gay character " , which must have upset the Christian groups . Of Lana 's storyline , a writer for AfterEllen stated , " The significance of this depiction was that it occurred in a relatively conservative , family @-@ oriented show with a large child viewership , and all the major sympathetic characters were presented as supportive of Lana 's sexuality , with the bullies being depicted as villains . " 
 In his book Neighbours : 20 years of Ramsay Street , Tony Johnston wrote , " <unk> by ultra @-@ conservative groups and celebrated by the gay press , the kiss helped to redefine Neighbours as it entered its third decade . " In July 2007 , the Herald Sun asked readers to vote for their top ten Neighbours moments . Lana and Sky 's kiss came in at number nine , and a reporter for the paper said " It 's rare that Neighbours attracts the attention of the shock jocks around the country , but that 's what happened when Sky Bishop , played by Stephanie McIntosh , gave Lana , played by Bridget Neval , a kiss . Sky was exploring her sexuality and the scene was one of the most talked about ever in the press . Lana left Erinsborough and Sky has gone on to be an unmarried mum " . 
 = M @-@ 48 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 48 is an east – west state trunkline highway in the Upper Peninsula ( UP ) of the US state of Michigan . It connects Rudyard with Pickford and continues to the far eastern end of the UP . The highway runs for 43 @.@ 723 miles ( 70 @.@ 365 km ) through rural parts of Chippewa County , including along the county line with Mackinac County . Between 580 and 1 @,@ 800 vehicles a day use the roadway daily . 
 The highway was designated by 1919 along a route that ran much farther west in the UP . Within its first decade , M @-@ 48 was extended to end at a point north of Newberry . Since the 1960s , it has had its current configuration . A section of roadway that was previously used as part of the western end of the highway was redesignated as a section H @-@ 40 in the 1970s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 48 currently starts at an interchange with I @-@ 75 in the Rudyard area . The highway runs west from the interchange into Rudyard where it turns south , running concurrently with county road H @-@ 63 . M @-@ 48 turns eastward south of town along 22 Mile Road through fields . At Meridian Road , M @-@ 48 turns south along M @-@ 129 through the community of Pickford . South of town , M @-@ 48 / M @-@ 129 runs long the Chippewa – Mackinac county line and crosses the Munuscong River . M @-@ 48 turns east at 26 Mile Road into Chippewa County . The highway zig @-@ zags through rural areas in the southeast of the county . It follows Hanna and 28 Mile roads to Stalwart . In that community , M @-@ 48 runs south on Reynolds Road to a corner on the Chippewa – Mackinac county line where the highway turns back east toward the Goetzville area running through the Lake Superior State Forest . After one last north – south segment , M @-@ 48 terminates at a junction with M @-@ 134 west of DeTour Village near Albany Harbor . 
 The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) maintains M @-@ 48 like all other parts of the state trunkline highway system under its jurisdiction . As a part of these responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of traffic along its roads using a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) . This measurement is a calculation of the average traffic levels for a roadway segment on any average day of the year . In 2009 , MDOT figured that between 580 and 1 @,@ 800 vehicles a day used sections of M @-@ 48 . In addition , the department has added the portion of M @-@ 48 between the northern M @-@ 129 junction and M @-@ 134 to the Lake Huron Circle Tour , a scenic drive that loops around the lake . No part of the highway has been added to the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 On July 1 , 1919 , M @-@ 48 ran from Rexton to Trout Lake and eastward on to Rudyard . The highway continued to Goetzville and ran to DeTour Village at the eastern tip of the UP . By 1927 , the western end was moved to a point north of Newberry . M @-@ 48 was extended along US Highway 2 ( US 2 ) to Garnet . From there , M @-@ 48 ran north to M @-@ 28 east of Newberry . It turned west along M @-@ 28 into Newberry and then north to Four Mile Corner . In the mid @-@ 1930s , M @-@ 28 's routing through the Newberry area was shifted . As a result of this shift , the section of M @-@ 28 / M @-@ 48 in downtown was renumbered M @-@ 28A / M @-@ 48 . In the early 1940s , US 2 was moved to a new routing along the Lake Michigan shoreline . In the process , the US 2 / M @-@ 48 concurrency was eliminated . By the same time , M @-@ 48 was truncated when M @-@ 134 was designated east to the DeTour area . By the end of the decade , M @-@ 48 was truncated and rerouted on its western end , replacing the contemporary M @-@ 117 south of Rexton to US 2 in Epoufette . All of M @-@ 48 west of US 2 was turned over to local jurisdiction and removed from the state highway system , save a section made part of M @-@ 123 in late 1960 or early 1961 . A few years later , M @-@ 48 was extended along a former section of US 2 into Rudyard to connect to the newly opened I @-@ 75 / US 2 freeway in 1963 . After October 1970 , the former M @-@ 48 west of the current highway was designated as a part of the County @-@ Designated Highway System .

 = Washington State Route 104 = 
 State Route 104 ( SR 104 ) is a 31 @.@ 75 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 51 @.@ 10 km ) state highway in the U.S. state of Washington , serving four counties : Jefferson on the Olympic Peninsula , Kitsap on the Kitsap Peninsula , and Snohomish and King in the Puget Sound region . It begins south of Discovery Bay at U.S. Route 101 ( US 101 ) south of Discovery Bay and crosses the Hood Canal Bridge over Hood Canal to the terminus of SR 3 near Port Gamble . SR 104 continues southeast onto the Edmonds – Kingston Ferry to cross the Puget Sound and intersects SR 99 and Interstate 5 ( I @-@ 5 ) before ending at SR 522 in Lake Forest Park . SR 104 also has a short spur route that connects the highway to SR 99 at an at @-@ grade signal on the Snohomish – King county line . 
 Established during the 1964 state highway renumbering , SR 104 was formed out of four highways , themselves created in 1937 : Secondary State Highway 9E ( SSH 9E ) from Discovery Bay to Port Gamble , Primary State Highway 21 ( PSH 21 ) from Port Gamble to Kingston , SSH 1W within Edmonds , and SSH 2B from Edmonds to Lake Forest Park . PSH 21 was originally part of State Road 21 , added to the state highway system in 1915 to connect the Port Gamble – Shine ferry to the Kingston ferry landing . The Edmonds – Kingston ferry at the end of State Road 21 has been in operation under various companies since 1923 and was served by the 14 @-@ car City of Edmonds . SSH 9E extended from Discovery Bay to Port Ludlow initially and was moved south and extended to the South Point ferry landing in the late 1940s . The bridge replaced the South Point – Lofall ferry when it opened in 1961 , but the ferry was re @-@ used during the construction of the second Hood Canal Bridge after the first bridge sank in 1979 and before the new bridge opened in 1982 . The Edmonds – Kingston ferry was added to the state ferry system in 1951 before it was incorporated into SR 104 in 1994 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 104 begins at an intersection with US 101 , located south of Discovery Bay on the Olympic Peninsula . The highway travels south through rural Jefferson County towards Crocker Lake and turns southeast , intersecting SR 19 south of Port Ludlow . SR 104 continues east along the northern shore of Squamish Harbor , part of the Hood Canal , and crosses into Kitsap County on the 7 @,@ 869 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 2 @,@ 398 m ) Hood Canal Bridge , the third longest floating bridge in the world . The highway serves as the northern terminus of SR 3 east of the bridge and turns northeast towards Port Gamble , located on the Kitsap Peninsula . SR 104 turns south along the western shore of Port Gamble , the bay the community is named after , and turns southeast to intersect SR 307 . The highway continues east from the intersection to Kingston , where it splits into a one @-@ way pair before the designation travels onto the Edmonds – Kingston Ferry . 
 The ferry , operated by Washington State Ferries ( WSF ) , takes approximately 30 minutes to cross 5 @.@ 95 miles ( 9 @.@ 58 km ) across Puget Sound . It departs from Kingston on <unk> Cove and arrives in Edmonds in Snohomish County . WSF operates thirteen round @-@ trip crossings every day . Westbound passengers must pay a $ 7 @.@ 70 toll or they may alternately pay with a prepaid Wave2Go card . 
 SR 104 resumes in Edmonds on Main Street and crosses a BNSF rail line south of Edmonds Station . The highway turns south at an intersection with SR 524 onto Sunset Avenue towards Woodway . The roadway travels southeast along Edmonds Way towards the Snohomish – King county line , intersecting SR 524 Spur and 5th Street at a grade @-@ separated interchange . Edmonds Way travels through a partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 99 before SR 104 intersects its spur route , which travels west towards an at @-@ grade signal with SR 99 . The highway continues east along Ballinger Way to a partial cloverleaf interchange with I @-@ 5 southeast of Lake Ballinger . The highway travels southeast into Lake Forest Park , where SR 104 ends at SR 522 on the north shore of Lake Washington . 
 SR 104 is considered , by the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) , an auxiliary route of US 101 , part of a numbering system established during the 1964 state highway renumbering . Every year , WSDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2011 , WSDOT calculated that between 3 @,@ 800 and 44 @,@ 000 vehicles per day used the highway , mostly in the Shoreline area . The Edmonds – Kingston ferry carried 3 @.@ 808 million passengers and 2 @.@ 025 million vehicles in 2012 , according to WSF statistics . The segments of the highway between Discovery Bay and Kingston and SR 99 and I @-@ 5 in Edmonds and Shoreline are designated as part of the National Highway System , while the whole route is designated by WSDOT as a Highway of Statewide Significance because it connects major communities in the state of Washington . 
 = = History = = 
 SR 104 was established during the 1964 state highway renumbering as the successor to several state highways : SSH 9E between Discovery Bay and Port Gamble , PSH 21 between Port Gamble and Kingston , SSH 1W in Edmonds , and SSH 2B between Edmonds and Lake Forest Park . The highway between Port Gamble and Kingston was established in 1915 as part of State Road 21 , which extended south to Bremerton . During the creation of the Primary and secondary state highways in 1937 , State Road 21 was re @-@ designated as PSH 21 and extended south to Gorst . SSH 9E was also established , connecting US 101 and PSH 9 in Discovery Bay to Port Ludlow , along with SSH 1W from US 99 and PSH 1 in Lynnwood through Edmonds to US 99 and PSH 1 in Woodway , following the route of an unpaved road built in the 1890s . SSH 2B was created in 1937 to serve as a connector between US 99 and PSH 1 in Shoreline to a branch of PSH 2 in Lake Forest Park . 
 SSH 9E was extended southeast to the South Point ferry over Hood Canal in 1947 , as the ferry traveled east to a branch of PSH 21 at Lofall created in 1949 . The highway was moved south from Discovery Bay to intersect US 101 near Crocker Lake in 1957 and was extended across the floating Hood Canal Bridge in 1959 to PSH 21 west of Port Gamble prior to the bridge opening on August 12 , 1961 . SR 104 was designated over the highways in 1964 and was signed into law in 1970 . The Hood Canal Bridge , officially named after William A. Bugge , sank during the February 13 , 1979 windstorm and was replaced by a ferry operating between Lofall and South Point until the west span was re @-@ opened on October 23 , 1982 . The east span of the bridge was replaced between 1997 and 2010 , closing the bridge to traffic in May 2009 and re @-@ opening the South Point – Lofall ferry . The route of the highway has not been revised significantly since the 1994 inclusion of ferry routes . 
 The Edmonds – Kingston ferry , added to SR 104 in 1994 , was first served by the 14 @-@ car and 76 @-@ passenger City of Edmonds in 1923 . The ferry ran three crossings on weekdays and six on weekends and a toll of $ 1 @.@ 50 for vehicles and $ 0 @.@ 25 for passengers was later charged . After the establishment of Washington State Ferries in 1951 , the 59 @-@ car MV Nisqually was assigned to the Edmonds – Kingston route . Between 1968 and 2005 , the Evergreen State class MV <unk> and MV Evergreen State were used on the route , while the Steel Electric class MV <unk> and MV Quinault were used on extra summer runs . The Jumbo class MV Spokane and MV Walla Walla began serving the route in 2005 , but sometimes are replaced by other ferries , especially during maintenance .

 SR 104 Spur begins its short , 0 @.@ 34 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 0 @.@ 55 km ) route as 244th Street at SR 104 on the Snohomish – King county line between Edmonds and Shoreline . 244th Street travels west on the 5 @-@ lane roadway ( including a center turning lane ) north of the Aurora Village shopping center to end at an intersection with Aurora Avenue , signed as SR 99 . The highway was originally part of SSH 2B from 1937 to 1964 and SR 104 after the 1964 highway renumbering and was created in 2009 after SR 104 was realigned onto a new divided highway . WSDOT estimated that between 18 @,@ 000 and 19 @,@ 000 vehicles per day used the spur route , according to AADT data in 2011 .

 = Cheddar Gorge = 
 Cheddar Gorge is a limestone gorge in the Mendip Hills , near the village of Cheddar , Somerset , England . The gorge is the site of the Cheddar show caves , where Britain 's oldest complete human skeleton , Cheddar Man , estimated to be over 9 @,@ 000 years old , was found in 1903 . Older remains from the Upper Late Palaeolithic era ( 12 @,@ 000 – 13 @,@ 000 years ago ) have been found . The caves , produced by the activity of an underground river , contain stalactites and stalagmites . The gorge is part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest called Cheddar Complex . 
 Cheddar Gorge , including the caves and other attractions , has become a tourist destination . In a 2005 poll of Radio Times readers , following its appearance on the 2005 television programme Seven Natural Wonders , Cheddar Gorge was named as the second greatest natural wonder in Britain , surpassed only by Dan yr Ogof caves . The gorge attracts about 500 @,@ 000 visitors per year . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Cheddar is a gorge lying on the southern edge of the Mendip Hills . The maximum depth of the gorge is 137 m ( 449 ft ) , with a near @-@ vertical cliff @-@ face to the south , and steep grassy slopes to the north . The B3135 road runs along the bottom of the gorge . 
 The area is underlain by Black Rock slate , Burrington Oolite and Clifton Down Limestone of the Carboniferous Limestone Series , which contain <unk> and fossil debris , on top of Old Red Sandstone and by Dolomitic Conglomerate of the Keuper . Evidence for Variscan orogeny is seen in the sheared rock and cleaved shales . In many places weathering of these strata has resulted in the formation of immature calcareous soils . 
 The gorge was formed by meltwater floods during the cold periglacial periods which have occurred over the last 1 @.@ 2 million years . During the ice ages permafrost blocked the caves with ice and frozen mud and made the limestone impermeable . When this melted during the summers , water was forced to flow on the surface , and carved out the gorge . During warmer periods the water flowed underground through the permeable limestone , creating the caves and leaving the gorge dry , so that today much of the gorge has no river until the underground Cheddar Yeo river emerges in the lower part from Gough 's Cave . The river is used by Bristol Water , who maintain a series of dams and ponds which supply the nearby Cheddar Reservoir , via a 137 @-@ centimetre ( 54 in ) diameter pipe that takes water just upstream of the Rotary Club Sensory Garden , a public park in the gorge opposite Jacob 's Ladder . 
 The gorge is susceptible to flooding . In the Great Flood of 1968 the flow of water washed large boulders down the gorge , damaging the cafe and entrance to Gough 's Cave and washing away cars . In the cave itself the flooding lasted for three days . In 2012 the B3135 , the road through the gorge , was closed for several weeks following damage to the road surface during extensive flooding . 
 = = Ownership and commercialisation = = 
 The south side of the gorge is owned and administered by the Marquess of Bath 's Longleat Estate . The cliffs on the north side of the gorge are owned by The National Trust . Every year both of the gorge 's owners contribute funds towards the clearance of scrub bush and trees from the area .
