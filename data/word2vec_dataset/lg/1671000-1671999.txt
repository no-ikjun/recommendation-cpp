 Sales and income taxes behave differently due to differing definitions of tax base , which can make comparisons between the two confusing . Under the existing individual income plus employment ( Social Security ; Medicare ; Medicaid ) tax formula , taxes to be paid are included in the base on which the tax rate is imposed ( known as tax @-@ inclusive ) . If an individual 's gross income is $ 100 and the sum of their income plus employment tax rate is 23 % , taxes owed equals $ 23 . Traditional state sales taxes are imposed on a tax base equal to the pre @-@ tax portion of a good 's price ( known as tax @-@ exclusive ) . A good priced at $ 77 with a 30 % sales tax rate yields $ 23 in taxes owed . To adjust an inclusive rate to an exclusive rate , divide the given rate by one minus that rate ( i.e. <formula> ) . 
 The FairTax statutory rate , unlike most U.S. state @-@ level sales taxes , is presented on a tax base that includes the amount of FairTax paid . For example , a final after @-@ tax price of $ 100 includes $ 23 of taxes . Although no such requirement is included in the text of the legislation , Congressman John Linder has stated that the FairTax would be implemented as an inclusive tax , which would include the tax in the retail price , not added on at checkout — an item on the shelf for five dollars would be five dollars total . The legislation requires the receipt to display the tax as 23 % of the total . Linder states the FairTax is presented as a 23 % tax rate for easy comparison to income and employment tax rates ( the taxes it would be replacing ) . The plan 's opponents call the semantics deceptive . <unk> called the presentation misleading , saying that it hides the real truth of the tax rate . Bruce Bartlett stated that polls show tax reform support is extremely sensitive to the proposed rate , and called the presentation confusing and deceptive based on the conventional method of calculating sales taxes . Proponents believe it is both inaccurate and misleading to say that an income tax is 23 % and the FairTax is 30 % as it implies that the sales tax burden is higher . 
 = = = Revenue neutrality = = = 
 A key question surrounding the FairTax is whether the tax has the ability to be revenue @-@ neutral ; that is , whether the tax would result in an increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues . Economists , advisory groups , and political advocacy groups disagree about the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue @-@ neutral . Various analysts use different assumptions , time @-@ frames , and methods resulting in dramatically different tax rates making direct comparison among the studies difficult . The choice between static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue @-@ neutral rates . 
 A 2006 study published in Tax Notes by the Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University and Dr. Laurence Kotlikoff estimated the FairTax would be revenue @-@ neutral for the tax year 2007 at a rate of 23 @.@ 82 % ( 31 @.@ 27 % tax @-@ exclusive ) . The study states that purchasing power is transferred to state and local taxpayers from state and local governments . To recapture the lost revenue , state and local governments would have to raise tax rates or otherwise change tax laws in order to continue collecting the same real revenues from their taxpayers . The Argus Group and Arduin , Laffer & Moore Econometrics each published an analysis that defended the 23 % rate . While proponents of the FairTax concede that the above studies did not explicitly account for tax evasion , they also claim that the studies did not altogether ignore tax evasion under the FairTax . These studies presumably incorporated some degree of tax evasion in their calculations by using National Income and Product Account based figures , which is argued to understate total household consumption . The studies also did not account for capital gains that may be realized by the U.S. government if consumer prices were allowed to rise , which would reduce the real value of nominal U.S. government debt . Nor did these studies account for any increased economic growth that many economists researching the plan believe would occur . 
 In contrast to the above studies , William G. Gale of the Brookings Institution published a study in Tax Notes that estimated a rate of 28 @.@ 2 % ( 39 @.@ 3 % tax @-@ exclusive ) for 2007 assuming full taxpayer compliance and an average rate of 31 % ( 44 % tax @-@ exclusive ) from 2006 to 2015 ( assumes that the Bush tax cuts expire on schedule and accounts for the replacement of an additional $ 3 trillion collected through the Alternative Minimum Tax ) . The study also concluded that if the tax base were eroded by 10 % due to tax evasion , tax avoidance , and / or legislative adjustments , the average rate would be 34 % ( 53 % tax @-@ exclusive ) for the 10 @-@ year period . A dynamic analysis in 2008 by the Baker Institute For Public Policy concluded that a 28 % ( 38 @.@ 9 % tax @-@ exclusive ) rate would be revenue neutral for 2006 . The President 's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform performed a 2006 analysis to replace the individual and corporate income tax with a retail sales tax and estimated the rate to be 25 % ( 34 % tax @-@ exclusive ) assuming 15 % tax evasion , and 33 % ( 49 % tax @-@ exclusive ) with 30 % tax evasion . The rate would need to be substantially higher to replace the additional taxes replaced by the FairTax ( payroll , estate , and gift taxes ) . Several economists criticized the President 's Advisory Panel 's study as having allegedly altered the terms of the FairTax , using unsound methodology , and / or failing to fully explain their calculations . 
 = = Taxable items and exemptions = = 
 The tax would be levied once at the final retail sale for personal consumption on new goods and services . Purchases of used items , exports and all business transactions would not be taxed . Also excluded are investments , such as purchases of stock , corporate mergers and acquisitions and capital investments . Savings and education tuition expenses would be exempt as they would be considered an investment ( rather than final consumption ) . 
 A good would be considered " used " and not taxable if a consumer already owns it before the FairTax takes effect or if the FairTax has been paid previously on the good , which may be different from the item being sold previously . Personal services such as health care , legal services , financial services , and auto repairs would be subject to the FairTax , as would renting apartments and other real property . Food , clothing , prescription drugs and medical services would be taxed . ( State sales taxes generally exempt these types of basic @-@ need items in an effort to reduce the tax burden on low @-@ income families . The FairTax would use a monthly rebate system instead of the common state exclusions . ) Internet purchases would be taxed , as would retail international purchases ( such as a boat or car ) that are imported to the United States ( collected by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection ) . 
 = = Distribution of tax burden = = 
 The FairTax 's effect on the distribution of taxation or tax incidence ( the effect on the distribution of economic welfare ) is a point of dispute . The plan 's supporters argue that the tax would broaden the tax base , that it would be progressive , and that it would decrease tax burdens and start taxing wealth ( reducing the economic gap ) . Opponents argue that a national sales tax would be inherently regressive and would decrease tax burdens paid by high @-@ income individuals . A person earning $ 2 million a year could live well spending $ 1 million , and as a result pay a mere 11 % of that year 's income in taxes . Households at the lower end of the income scale spend almost all their income , while households at the higher end are more likely to devote a portion of income to saving . Therefore , according to economist William G. Gale , the percentage of income taxed is regressive at higher income levels ( as consumption falls as a percentage of income ) . 
 Income earned and saved would not be taxed until spent under the proposal . Households at the extreme high end of consumption often finance their purchases out of savings , not income . Economist Laurence Kotlikoff states that the FairTax could make the tax system much more progressive and generationally equitable , and argues that taxing consumption is effectively the same as taxing wages plus taxing wealth . A household of three persons ( this example will use two adults of any gender plus one child ; the rebate does not consider marital status ) spending $ 30 @,@ 000 a year on taxable items would devote about 3 @.@ 4 % of total spending ( [ $ 6 @,@ 900 tax minus $ 5 @,@ 888 rebate ] / $ 30 @,@ 000 spending ) to the FairTax after the rebate . The same household spending $ 125 @,@ 000 on taxable items would spend around 18 @.@ 3 % ( [ $ 28 @,@ 750 tax minus $ 5 @,@ 888 rebate ] / $ 125 @,@ 000 spending ) on the FairTax . At higher spending levels , the rebate has less impact and the rate approaches 23 % of total spending . Thus , according to economist Laurence Kotlikoff , the effective tax rate is progressive on consumption . 
 Studies by Kotlikoff and David <unk> state that the FairTax would significantly reduce marginal taxes on work and saving , lowering overall average remaining lifetime tax burdens on current and future workers . A study by Kotlikoff and Sabine <unk> concluded that the long @-@ term effects of the FairTax would reward low @-@ income households with 26 @.@ 3 % more purchasing power , middle @-@ income households with 12 @.@ 4 % more purchasing power , and high @-@ income households with 5 % more purchasing power . The Beacon Hill Institute reported that the FairTax would make the federal tax system more progressive and would benefit the average individual in almost all expenditures <unk> . In another study , they state the FairTax would offer the broadest tax base ( an increase of over $ 2 trillion ) , which allows the FairTax to have a lower tax rate than current tax law . 
 Gale analyzed a national sales tax ( though different from the FairTax in several aspects ) and reported that the overall tax burden on middle @-@ income Americans would increase while the tax burden on the top 1 % would drop . A study by the Beacon Hill Institute reported that the FairTax may have a negative effect on the well @-@ being of mid @-@ income earners for several years after implementation . According to the President 's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform report , which compared the individual and corporate income tax ( excluding other taxes the FairTax replaces ) to a sales tax with rebate , the percentage of federal taxes paid by those earning from $ 15 @,@ 000 – $ 50 @,@ 000 would rise from 3 @.@ 6 % to 6 @.@ 7 % , while the burden on those earning more than $ 200 @,@ 000 would fall from 53 @.@ 5 % to 45 @.@ 9 % . The report states that the top 5 % of earners would see their burden decrease from 58 @.@ 6 % to 37 @.@ 4 % . FairTax supporters argue that replacing the regressive payroll tax ( a 15 @.@ 3 % total tax not included in the Tax Panel study ; payroll taxes include a 12 @.@ 4 % Social Security tax on wages up to $ 97 @,@ 500 and a 2 @.@ 9 % Medicare tax , a 15 @.@ 3 % total tax that is often split between employee and employer ) greatly changes the tax distribution , and that the FairTax would relieve the tax burden on middle @-@ class workers . 
 = = Predicted effects = = 
 The predicted effects of the FairTax are a source of disagreement among economists and other analysts . According to Money magazine , while many economists and tax experts support the idea of a consumption tax , many of them view the FairTax proposal as having serious problems with evasion and revenue neutrality . Some economists argue that a consumption tax ( the FairTax is one such tax ) would have a positive effect on economic growth , incentives for international business to locate in the U.S. , and increased U.S. international competitiveness ( border tax adjustment in global trade ) . The FairTax would be tax @-@ free on mortgage interest ( up to a basic interest rate ) and donations , but some law makers have concerns about losing tax incentives on home ownership and charitable contributions . There is also concern about the effect on the income tax industry and the difficulty of repealing the Sixteenth Amendment ( to prevent Congress from re @-@ introducing an income tax ) . 
 = = = Economic = = = 
 Americans For Fair Taxation states the FairTax would boost the United States economy and offers a letter signed by eighty economists , including Nobel Laureate Vernon L. Smith , that have endorsed the plan . The Beacon Hill Institute estimated that within five years real GDP would increase 10 @.@ 7 % over the current system , domestic investment by 86 @.@ 3 % , capital stock by 9 @.@ 3 % , employment by 9 @.@ 9 % , real wages by 10 @.@ 2 % , and consumption by 1 @.@ 8 % . Arduin , Laffer & Moore Econometrics projected the economy as measured by GDP would be 2 @.@ 4 % higher in the first year and 11 @.@ 3 % higher by the 10th year than it would otherwise be . Economists Laurence Kotlikoff and Sabine <unk> reported the incentive to work and save would increase ; by 2030 , the economy 's capital stock would increase by 43 @.@ 7 % over the current system , output by 9 @.@ 4 % , and real wages by 11 @.@ 5 % . Economist John <unk> estimates a consumption tax , like the FairTax , would bring long @-@ term interest rates down by 25 – 35 % . An analysis in 2008 by the Baker Institute For Public Policy indicated that the plan would generate significant overall macroeconomic improvement in both the short and long @-@ term , but warned of transitional issues . 
 FairTax proponents argue that the proposal would provide tax burden visibility and reduce compliance and efficiency costs by 90 % , returning a large share of money to the productive economy . The Beacon Hill Institute concluded that the FairTax would save $ 346 @.@ 51 billion in administrative costs and would be a much more efficient taxation system . Bill Archer , former head of the House Ways and Means Committee , asked Princeton University Econometrics to survey 500 European and Asian companies regarding the effect on their business decisions if the United States enacted the FairTax . 400 of those companies stated they would build their next plant in the United States , and 100 companies said they would move their corporate headquarters to the United States . Supporters argue that the U.S. has the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate among OECD countries along with being the only country with no border adjustment element in its tax system . Proponents state that because the FairTax eliminates corporate income taxes and is automatically border adjustable , the competitive tax advantage of foreign producers would be eliminated , immediately boosting U.S. competitiveness overseas and at home . 
 Opponents point to a study commissioned by the National Retail Federation in 2000 that found a national sales tax bill filed by Billy <unk> , the Individual Tax Freedom Act ( H.R. <unk> ) , would bring a three @-@ year decline in the economy , a four @-@ year decline in employment and an eight @-@ year decline in consumer spending . Wall Street Journal columnist James Taranto states the FairTax is unsuited to take advantage of supply @-@ side effects and would create a powerful disincentive to spend money . John Linder states an estimated $ 11 trillion is held in foreign accounts ( largely for tax purposes ) , which he states would be repatriated back to U.S. banks if the FairTax were enacted , becoming available to U.S. capital markets , bringing down interest rates , and otherwise promoting economic growth in the United States . Attorney Allen Buckley states that a tremendous amount of wealth was already repatriated under law changes in 2004 and 2005 . Buckley also argues that if the tax rate was significantly higher , the FairTax would discourage the consumption of new goods and hurt economic growth . 
 = = = Transition = = = 
 During the transition , many or most of the employees of the IRS ( 105 @,@ 978 in 2005 ) would face loss of employment . The Beacon Hill Institute estimate is that the federal government would be able to cut $ 8 billion from the IRS budget of $ 11 @.@ 01 billion ( in 2007 ) , reducing the size of federal tax administration by 73 % . In addition , income tax <unk> ( many seasonal ) , tax lawyers , tax compliance staff in medium @-@ to @-@ large businesses , and software companies which sell tax preparation software could face significant drops , changes , or loss of employment . The bill would maintain the IRS for three years after implementation before completely decommissioning the agency , providing employees time to find other employment . 
 In the period before the FairTax is implemented , there could be a strong incentive for individuals to buy goods without the sales tax using credit . After the FairTax is in effect , the credit could be paid off using untaxed payroll . If credit incentives do not change , opponents of the FairTax worry it could exacerbate an existing consumer debt problem . Proponents of the FairTax state that this effect could also allow individuals to pay off their existing ( pre @-@ FairTax ) debt more quickly , and studies suggest lower interest rates after FairTax passage . 
 Individuals under the current system who accumulated savings from ordinary income ( by choosing not to spend their money when the income was earned ) paid taxes on that income before it was placed in savings ( such as a Roth IRA or CD ) . When individuals spend above the poverty level with money saved under the current system , that spending would be subject to the FairTax . People living through the transition may find both their earnings and their spending taxed . Critics have stated that the FairTax would result in unfair double taxation for savers and suggest it does not address the transition effect on some taxpayers who have accumulated significant savings from after @-@ tax dollars , especially retirees who have finished their careers and switched to spending down their life savings . Supporters of the plan argue that the current system is no different , since compliance costs and " hidden taxes " embedded in the prices of goods and services cause savings to be " taxed " a second time already when spent . The rebate would supplement accrued savings , covering taxes up to the poverty level . The income taxes on capital gains , estates , social security and pension benefits would be eliminated under FairTax . In addition , the FairTax legislation adjusts Social Security benefits for changes in the price level , so a percentage increase in prices would result in an equal percentage increase to Social Security income . Supporters suggest these changes would offset paying the FairTax under transition conditions . 
 = = = Other indirect effects = = = 
 The FairTax would be tax free on mortgage interest up to the federal borrowing rate for like @-@ term instruments as determined by the Treasury , but since savings , education , and other investments would be tax free under the plan , the FairTax could decrease the incentive to spend more on homes . An analysis in 2008 by the Baker Institute For Public Policy concluded that the FairTax would have significant transitional issues for the housing sector since the investment would no longer be tax @-@ favored . In a 2007 study , the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that total charitable giving would increase under the FairTax , although increases in giving would not be distributed proportionately amongst the various types of charitable organizations . The FairTax may also affect state and local government debt as the federal income tax system provides tax advantages to municipal bonds . Proponents believe environmental benefits would result from the FairTax through environmental economics and the re @-@ use and re @-@ sale of used goods . Former Senator Mike Gravel states the significant reduction of paperwork for IRS compliance and tax forms is estimated to save about 300 @,@ 000 trees each year . Advocates argue the FairTax would provide an incentive for illegal immigrants to legalize as they would otherwise not receive the rebate . Proponents also believe that the FairTax would have positive effects on civil liberties that are sometimes charged against the income tax system , such as social inequality , economic inequality , financial privacy , self @-@ incrimination , unreasonable search and seizure , burden of proof , and due process . 
 If the FairTax bill were passed , permanent elimination of income taxation would not be guaranteed ; the FairTax bill would repeal much of the existing tax code , but the Sixteenth Amendment would remain in place . Preventing new legislation from reintroducing income taxation would require a repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution with a separate provision expressly prohibiting a federal income tax . This is referred to as an " aggressive repeal " . Separate income taxes enforced by individual states would be unaffected by the federal repeal . Passing the FairTax would require only a simple majority in each house of the United States Congress along with the signature of the President , whereas enactment of a constitutional amendment must be approved by two thirds of each house of the Congress , and three @-@ quarters of the individual U.S. states . It is therefore possible that passage of the FairTax bill would simply add another taxation system . If a new income tax bill were passed after the FairTax passage , a hybrid system could develop ; albeit , there is nothing preventing a bill for a hybrid system today . To address this issue and preclude that possibility , in the 111th Congress John Linder introduced a contingent sunset provision in H.R. 25 . It would require the repeal of the Sixteenth Amendment within 8 years after the implementation of the FairTax or , failing that , the FairTax would expire . Critics have also argued that a tax on state government consumption could be unconstitutional . 
 = = Changes in the retail economy = = 
 Since the FairTax would not tax used goods , the value would be determined by the supply and demand in relation to new goods . The price differential / margins between used and new goods would stay consistent , as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods . Because the U.S. tax system has a hidden effect on prices , it is expected that moving to the FairTax would decrease production costs from the removal of business taxes and compliance costs , which is predicted to offset a portion of the FairTax effect on prices . 
 = = = Value of used goods = = = 
 Since the FairTax would not tax used goods , some critics have argued that this would create a differential between the price of new and used goods , which may take years to equalize . Such a differential would certainly influence the sale of new goods like vehicles and homes . Similarly , some supporters have claimed that this would create an incentive to buy used goods , creating environmental benefits of re @-@ use and re @-@ sale . Conversely , it is argued that like the income tax system that contains embedded tax cost ( see Theories of retail pricing ) , used goods would contain the embedded FairTax cost . While the FairTax would not be applied to the retail sales of used goods , the inherent value of a used good includes the taxes paid when the good was sold at retail . The value is determined by the supply and demand in relation to new goods . The price differential / margins between used and new goods should stay consistent , as the cost and value of used goods are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new goods . 
 = = = Theories of retail pricing = = = 
 Based on a study conducted by Dale Jorgenson , proponents state that production cost of domestic goods and services could decrease by approximately 22 % on average after embedded tax costs are removed , leaving the sale nearly the same after taxes . The study concludes that producer prices would drop between 15 % and 26 % ( depending on the type of good / service ) . Jorgenson 's research included all income and payroll taxes in the embedded tax estimation , which assumes employee take @-@ home pay ( net income ) remains unchanged from pre @-@ FairTax levels . Price and wage changes after the FairTax would largely depend on the response of the Federal Reserve monetary authorities . Non @-@ accommodation of the money supply would suggest retail prices and take home pay stay the same — embedded taxes are replaced by the FairTax . Full accommodation would suggest prices and incomes rise by the exclusive rate ( i.e. , 30 % ) — embedded taxes become windfall gains . Partial accommodation would suggest a varying degree in @-@ between . 
 If businesses provided employees with gross pay ( including income tax withholding and the employee share of payroll taxes ) , Arduin , Laffer & Moore Econometrics estimated production costs could decrease by a minimum of 11 @.@ 55 % ( partial accommodation ) . This reduction would be from the removal of the remaining embedded costs , including corporate taxes , compliance costs , and the employer share of payroll taxes . This decrease would offset a portion of the FairTax amount reflected in retail prices , which proponents suggest as the most likely scenario . Bruce Bartlett states that it is unlikely that nominal wages would be reduced , which he believes would result in a recession , but that the Federal Reserve would likely increase the money supply to accommodate price increases . David <unk> states " The monetary authorities would have to consider how the degree of accommodation , varying from none to full , would affect the overall economy and how it would affect the well @-@ being of various groups such as retirees . " 
 Social Security benefits would be adjusted for any price changes due to FairTax implementation . The Beacon Hill Institute states that it would not matter , apart from transition issues , whether prices fall or rise — the relative tax burden and tax rate remains the same . Decreases in production cost would not fully apply to imported products ; so according to proponents , it would provide tax advantages for domestic production and increase U.S. competitiveness in global trade ( see Border <unk> ) . To ease the transition , U.S. retailers will receive a tax credit equal to the FairTax on their inventory to allow for quick cost reduction . Retailers would also receive an administrative fee equal to the greater of $ 200 or 0 @.@ 25 % of the remitted tax as compensation for compliance costs , which amounts to around $ 5 billion . 
 = = Effects on tax code compliance = = 
 One avenue for non @-@ compliance is the black market . FairTax supporters state that the black market is largely untaxed under the current tax system . Economists estimate the underground economy in the United States to be between one and three trillion dollars annually . By imposing a sales tax , supporters argue that black market activity would be taxed when proceeds from such activity are spent on legal consumption . For example , the sale of illegal narcotics would remain untaxed ( instead of being guilty of income tax evasion , drug dealers would be guilty of failing to submit sales tax ) , but they would face taxation when they used drug proceeds to buy consumer goods such as food , clothing , and cars . By taxing this previously untaxed money , FairTax supporters argue that non @-@ filers would be paying part of their share of what would otherwise be uncollected income and payroll taxes . 
 Other economists and analysts have argued that the underground economy would continue to bear the same tax burden as before . They state that replacing the current tax system with a consumption tax would not change the tax revenue generated from the underground economy — while illicit income is not taxed directly , spending of income from illicit activity results in business income and wages that are taxed . 
 = = = Tax compliance and evasion = = = 
 Proponents state the FairTax would reduce the number of tax filers by about 86 % ( from 100 million to 14 million ) and reduce the filing complexity to a simplified state sales tax form . The Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , among others , have specifically identified the negative relationship between compliance costs and the number of focal points for collection . Under the FairTax , the federal government would be able to concentrate tax enforcement efforts on a single tax . Retailers would receive an administrative fee equal to the greater of $ 200 or 0 @.@ 25 % of the remitted tax as compensation for compliance costs . In addition , supporters state that the overwhelming majority of purchases occur in major retail outlets , which are very unlikely to evade the FairTax and risk losing their business licenses . Economic Census figures for 2002 show that 48 @.@ 5 % of merchandise sales are made by just 688 businesses ( " Big @-@ Box " retailers ) . 85 @.@ 7 % of all retail sales are made by 92 @,@ 334 businesses , which is 3 @.@ 6 % of American companies . In the service sector , approximately 80 % of sales are made by 1 @.@ 2 % of U.S. businesses . 
 The FairTax is a national tax , but can be administered by the states rather than a federal agency , which may have a bearing on compliance as the states ' own agencies could monitor and audit businesses within that state . The 0 @.@ 25 % retained by the states amounts to $ 5 billion the states would have available for enforcement and administration . For example , California should receive over $ 500 million for enforcement and administration , which is more than the $ 327 million budget for the state 's sales and excise taxes . Because the federal money paid to the states would be a percentage of the total revenue collected , John Linder claims the states would have an incentive to maximize collections . Proponents believe that states that choose to conform to the federal tax base would have advantages in enforcement , information sharing , and clear interstate revenue allocation rules . A study by the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that , on average , states could more than halve their sales tax rates and that state economies would benefit greatly from adopting a state @-@ level FairTax . 
 FairTax opponents state that compliance decreases when taxes are not automatically withheld from citizens , and that massive tax evasion could result by collecting at just one point in the economic system . Compliance rates can also fall when taxed entities , rather than a third party , self @-@ report their tax liability . For example , ordinary personal income taxes can be automatically withheld and are reported to the government by a third party . Taxes without withholding and with self @-@ reporting , such as the FairTax , can see higher evasion rates . Economist Jane Gravelle of the Congressional Research Service found studies showing that evasion rates of sales taxes are often above 10 % , even when the sales tax rate is in the single digits . Tax publications by the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) , IMF , and Brookings Institution have suggested that the upper limit for a sales tax is about 10 % before incentives for evasion become too great to control . According to the GAO , 80 % of state tax officials opposed a national sales tax as an intrusion on their tax base . Opponents also raise concerns of legal tax avoidance by spending and consuming outside of the U.S. ( imported goods would be subject to collection by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection ) . 
 Economists from the University of Tennessee concluded that while there would be many desirable macroeconomic effects , adoption of a national retail sales tax would also have serious effects on state and local government finances . Economist Bruce Bartlett stated that if the states did not conform to the FairTax , they would have massive confusion and complication as to what is taxed by the state and what is taxed by the federal government . In addition , sales taxes have long exempted all but a few services because of the enormous difficulty in taxing intangibles — Bartlett suggests that the state may not have sufficient incentive to enforce the tax . University of Michigan economist Joel <unk> argues that states would face significant issues in enforcing the tax . " Even at an average rate of around five percent , state sales taxes are difficult to administer . " University of Virginia School of Law professor George Yin states that the FairTax could have evasion issues with export and import transactions . The President 's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform reported that if the federal government were to cease taxing income , states might choose to shift their revenue @-@ raising to income . Absent the Internal Revenue Service , it would be more difficult for the states to maintain viable income tax systems . 
 = = = Underground economy = = = 
 Opponents of the FairTax argue that imposing a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground and create a vast underground economy . Under a retail sales tax system , the purchase of intermediate goods and services that are factors of production are not taxed , since those goods would produce a final retail good that would be taxed . Individuals and businesses may be able to manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for intermediate goods , when in fact they are final purchases that should be taxed . Proponents point out that a business is required to have a registered seller 's certificate on file , and must keep complete records of all transactions for six years . Businesses must also record all taxable goods bought for seven years . They are required to report these sales every month ( see Personal vs. business purchases ) . The government could also stipulate that all retail sellers provide buyers with a written receipt , regardless of transaction type ( cash , credit , etc . ) , which would create a paper trail for evasion with risk of having the buyer turn them in ( the FairTax authorizes a reward for reporting tax cheats ) . 
 While many economists and tax experts support a consumption tax , problems could arise with using a retail sales tax rather than a value added tax ( VAT ) . A VAT imposes a tax on the value added at every intermediate step of production , so the goods reach the final consumer with much of the tax already in the price . The retail seller has little incentive to conceal retail sales , since he has already paid much of the good 's tax . Retailers are unlikely to subsidize the consumer 's tax evasion by concealing sales . In contrast , a retailer has paid no tax on goods under a sales tax system . This provides an incentive for retailers to conceal sales and engage in " tax arbitrage " by sharing some of the illicit tax savings with the final consumer . Citing evasion , Tim <unk> wrote in Forbes that Europe ’ s 20 @-@ 25 % consumption taxes simply would not work if they were a sales tax : that ’ s why they ’ re all a VAT . Laurence Kotlikoff has stated that the government could compel firms to report , via 1099 @-@ type forms , their sales to other firms , which would provide the same records that arise under a VAT . In the United States , a general sales tax is imposed in 45 states plus the District of Columbia ( accounting for over 97 % of both population and economic output ) , which proponents argue provides a large infrastructure for taxing sales that many countries do not have . 
 = = = Personal versus business purchases = = = 
 Businesses would be required to submit monthly or quarterly reports ( depending on sales volume ) of taxable sales and sales tax collected on their monthly sales tax return . During audits , the business would have to produce invoices for the " business purchases " that they did not pay sales tax on , and would have to be able to show that they were genuine business expenses . Advocates state the significant 86 % reduction in collection points would greatly increase the likelihood of business audits , making tax evasion behavior much more risky . Additionally , the FairTax legislation has several fines and penalties for non @-@ compliance , and authorizes a mechanism for reporting tax cheats to obtain a reward . To prevent businesses from purchasing everything for their employees , in a family business for example , goods and services bought by the business for the employees that are not strictly for business use would be taxable . Health insurance or medical expenses would be an example where the business would have to pay the FairTax on these purchases . Taxable property and services purchased by a qualified non @-@ profit or religious organization " for business purposes " would not be taxable . 
 = = FairTax movement = = 
 The creation of the FairTax began with a group of businessmen from Houston , Texas , who initially financed what has become the political advocacy group Americans For Fair Taxation ( AFFT ) , which has grown into a large tax reform movement . This organization , founded in 1994 , claims to have spent over $ 20 million in research , marketing , lobbying , and organizing efforts over a ten @-@ year period and is seeking to raise over $ 100 million more to promote the plan . AFFT includes a staff in Houston and a large group of volunteers who are working to get the FairTax enacted . Bruce Bartlett has charged that the FairTax was devised by the Church of Scientology in the early 1990s , drawing comparisons between the tax policy and religious doctrine from the faith , whose creation myth holds that an evil alien ruler known as Xenu " used phony tax inspections as a guise for destroying his enemies . " Representative John Linder told the Atlanta Journal @-@ Constitution that Bartlett confused the FairTax movement with the Scientology @-@ affiliated Citizens for an Alternative Tax System , which also seeks to abolish the federal income tax and replace it with a national retail sales tax . Leo <unk> , AFFT Chairman and CEO , stated " As a founder of Americans For Fair Taxation , I can state categorically , however , that Scientology played no role in the founding , research or crafting of the legislation giving expression to the FairTax . " 
 Much support has been achieved by talk radio personality Neal Boortz . Boortz 's book ( co @-@ authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder ) entitled The FairTax Book , explains the proposal and spent time atop the New York Times Best Seller list . Boortz stated that he donates his share of the proceeds to charity to promote the book . In addition , Boortz and Linder have organized several FairTax rallies to publicize support for the plan . Other media personalities have also assisted in growing grassroots support including former radio and TV talk show host Larry Elder , radio host and former candidate for the 2012 GOP Presidential Nomination Herman Cain , Fox News and radio host Sean Hannity , and Fox Business Host John Stossel . The FairTax received additional visibility as one of the issues in the 2008 presidential election . At a debate on June 30 , 2007 , several Republican candidates were asked about their position on the FairTax and many responded that they would sign the bill into law if elected . The most vocal promoters of the FairTax during the 2008 primary elections were Republican candidate Mike Huckabee and Democratic candidate Mike Gravel . The Internet , blogosphere , and electronic mailing lists have contributed to promoting , organizing , and gaining support for the FairTax . In the 2012 Republican presidential primary , and his ensuing Libertarian Party presidential run , former Governor of New Mexico and businessman Gary Johnson actively campaigned for the FairTax . Former CEO of Godfather 's Pizza Herman Cain has been promoting the FairTax as a final step in a multiple @-@ phase tax reform . Outside of the United States , the Christian Heritage Party of Canada adopted a FairTax proposal as part of their 2011 election platform but won no seats in that election .

 = Greene v Associated Newspapers Ltd = 
 Greene v Associated Newspapers Ltd [ 2004 ] EWCA Civ 1462 is a case of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales that governs the use of injunctions against publication in alleged defamation cases . Greene , a businesswoman , sought an injunction against Associated Newspapers Ltd to prevent them publishing alleged links with Peter Foster ; while they claimed to have emails showing links , she asserted that they were false . The test at the time for a preliminary injunction in defamation cases was Bonnard v Perryman , where it was established that the applicant has to show " a real prospect of success " at trial . The Human Rights Act 1998 established that judges should consider whether applicants are " more likely than not " to succeed at trial , a test applied to confidentiality cases in Cream Holdings Ltd v Banerjee and the Liverpool Post and Echo Ltd . Greene claimed that the Cream test should be applied rather than the Bonnard test . 
 The case first went to the High Court of Justice , where it was heard by Fulford J ; he decided that he did not have the authority to overrule Bonnard , and passed the case on to the Court of Appeal after granting a temporary injunction . In the Court of Appeal , the case was heard by May , Dyson and Brooke LJJ , with Brooke delivering the judgment on 5 November 2004 . In it , Brooke judged that defamation , the subject of Greene , was significantly different from breach of confidentiality , the subject in Cream . While the damage from a breach of confidentiality can never be undone , <unk> a simple test for issuing injunctions , a defamation case that is won vindicates the injured party . Making it easier to grant injunctions in defamation cases would damage the delicate balance between freedom of the press and the right to privacy ; as such , despite the Human Rights Act , Bonnard is still a valid test .

 Martha Greene , a businesswoman , sought an injunction against Associated Newspapers Ltd to prevent them publishing allegations that she was linked to Peter Foster , a convicted fraudster . Associated Newspapers claimed they had emails proving the link , and wanted to rely on a defence of fair comment and justification ; Green asserted that the emails were fakes . At the time , the law on injunctions was governed by two cases ; Bonnard v Perryman and Cream Holdings Ltd v Banerjee and the Liverpool Post and Echo Ltd . Bonnard established that " The right of free speech is one which it is for the public interest that individuals should <unk> , and indeed , that they should exercise without impediment , so long as no wrongful act is done … Until it is clear that an alleged libel is untrue , it is not clear that any right at all has been infringed ; and the importance of leaving free speech unfettered is a strong reason in cases of libel for dealing most cautiously and warily with the granting of interim injunctions " , telling courts that injunctions in libel cases should only be granted if there is " a real prospect of success " at trial . 
 The Human Rights Act 1998 , which came into force in 2000 , brought the European Convention on Human Rights into British domestic law . Article 8 of the convention covers " the right to respect for private and family life " , and during the passage of the Act through Parliament , elements of the press were concerned that this could affect their freedom of expression . As such , Section 12 of the Act provides that , if a court is considering whether to grant relief which infringes on the right to freedom of expression ( such as an injunction ) , it must " have particular regard to the importance of the Convention right to freedom of expression " , although recognising the other limits put on this right . Where a relief ( such as an injunction ) is granted in the absence of the respondent , the court must be satisfied that the claimant has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the defendant was notified , unless there are compelling reasons why they should not be . The court must also not grant relief that would restrict publication before trial , unless satisfied that it is " more likely than not " that the trial will establish that publication should not be allowed . 
 As a result of the Act , it was uncertain what test to use ; was " a real prospect of success " at trial acceptable , or the easier test of " more likely than not " to succeed at trial ? In Cream the House of Lords decided that " a real prospect of success " was still valid law , but that from then on the test of " more likely than not " should be applied . Following on from this ruling , Greene argued that the Bonnard test was now invalid , and that the case should be judged under the Human Rights Act and Cream .

 The case first went before Fulford J in the Queen 's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice , with Fulford 's judgment delivered on 16 October 2004 . In it , he held that the High Court was bound to apply Bonnard v Perryman , but granted an injunction until such time as a more senior court could determine Bonnard 's status . The case then went to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales , where it was heard by May , Dyson and Brooke LJJ ; Brooke delivered a judgment for the entire court on 5 November 2004 . In it , the court refused to extend the " more likely or not " test found in the Human Rights Act 1998 to cover defamation as well as breach of confidentiality ( the subject of the Cream case ) . While Brooke noted that the Bonnard test was inflexible , he also considered the distinction between defamation and breach of confidentiality ; while " confidentiality , once breached , is lost for ever " , if a defamatory statement is taken to trial and the claimant wins , he or she is vindicated and suffers no lasting harm . As such , the Cream test should not be applied , because it would violate the delicate balance between the right to privacy and the freedom of the press . 
 = Kvinneakt = 
 Kvinneakt ( " female nude " in Norwegian ) is an abstract bronze sculpture located on the Transit Mall of downtown Portland , Oregon . Designed and created by Norman J. Taylor between 1973 and 1975 , the work was funded by TriMet and the United States Department of Transportation and was installed on the Transit Mall in 1977 . The following year Kvinneakt appeared in the " Expose Yourself to Art " poster which featured future Mayor of Portland Bud Clark flashing the sculpture . It remained in place until November 2006 when it was removed temporarily during renovation of the Transit Mall and the installation of the MAX Light Rail on the mall . 
 Originally located on Fifth Avenue , the sculpture was reinstalled on the mall in 2009 at a different location , on SW Sixth Avenue between Alder and Morrison , where it remains . According to TriMet , Kvinneakt is one of 40 public art sculptures in the Transit Mall 's art collection . The sculpture is part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the Regional Arts & Culture Council and is administered by the City of Portland Metropolitan Arts Commission .

 Kvinneakt was designed and created by Norman J. Taylor , a Seattle @-@ based artist and professor of sculpture at the University of Washington , between 1973 and 1975 . The piece is an abstract bronze sculpture depicting a full @-@ length nude woman measuring 71 " x 38 " x 25 " . Kvinneakt was one of 11 sculptures selected for the Portland Transit Mall from more than 500 entries entered in a juried competition . The works were purchased through a budget of $ 250 @,@ 000 ; Kvinneakt was commissioned at a cost of $ 6 @,@ 500 . Funding sources for the project included Tri @-@ Met ( 20 percent ) and the United States Department of Transportation ( 80 percent ) . Of the 11 sculptures , only Kvinneakt and Kathleen McCullough 's ( née <unk> ) Cat in Repose were considered " figurative " . Claiming his intention was not to be vulgar , Taylor said : " It 's about grace and motion and a certain beauty and pride in the human figure . That may be sensual , but that 's far different from sex . " According to the Regional Arts & Culture Council , Taylor intended the piece to be " confrontational " ; he admitted , " the worst reaction you could give my work is no reaction . " 
 Kvinneakt was installed on the newly built Transit Mall in 1977 . The bronze sculpture was sited on SW Fifth Avenue near Washington Street ( between Washington and Stark ) . In 1978 , Kvinneakt appeared on the " Expose Yourself to Art " poster , which featured future Portland Mayor Bud Clark flashing the nude woman . 
 In 1981 , about 30 minutes before the start of April Fools ' Day , three men attempted to steal the 250 @-@ pound ( 110 kg ) statue , breaking it free from its pedestal and dragging it towards a waiting car before being spotted by a city worker and fleeing the scene . Damage from the incident included a broken right index finger and other cracks . Repairs cost $ 3 @,@ 000 and were undertaken by Norman Taylor , who also strengthened the sculpture 's body and its connections to its base . Kvinneakt was reinstalled at Fifth Avenue and Washington six months later , in October 1981 . 
 The sculpture has served as a stop on walking tours of the city , including the Metropolitan Arts Commission 's 1987 Portland Public Art walking tour and the 2003 Public Art Conference 's walking tour of downtown . On November 7 , 2006 , Kvinneakt was temporarily removed for renovation of the Transit Mall and installation of the MAX Light Rail along the mall . Its removal was supervised by staff of the Regional Arts & Culture Council . During this time Kvinneakt and other removed works were cleaned and refurbished . In September 2009 , the statue was re @-@ sited on SW Sixth Avenue between Alder and Morrison . Representatives from the Regional Arts & Culture Council and the TriMet Public Art Program conducted the unveiling . According to the former organization 's public art manager , the sculpture will likely remain in its current location for as long as 30 years . 
 There have been other instances when Kvinneakt was used to make a statement or act as a prop . On April Fools ' Day , 1982 , the Portland <unk> gathered around the sculpture , issued a proclamation condemning nudity , " even in statues , for viewing by the general public " , and left the statue covered with a " size 42 @-@ plus " , lacy bra . In 1984 the statue was vandalized with the painted text " Jesus Saves " . In January 1985 , on the day Bud Clark took the oath of office as Mayor of Portland , Kvinneakt was draped anonymously with a sash reading " Congratulations " . In 2007 Tom <unk> , founder of New Deal Vodka , posted an image of the sculpture on the company 's website with the woman 's nipples airbrushed out , protesting censorship after the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau deemed the website " offensive " . In 2012 , Century of Action , a project of the Oregon Women 's History Consortium , used the sculpture to promote women 's suffrage by placing a " Votes for Women " sash across her chest as part of the organization 's " Sash Project " .

 Kvinneakt is often referred to as the most notorious of the sculptures installed in the Transit Mall during the 1970s . In addition to being somewhat controversial because it is a nude , the sculpture has also received mixed reviews as a work of art . In 1981 , Taylor recalled that following the sculpture 's first installation one man told him that " he ought to be ashamed of himself . " In 1985 Jeff <unk> of The Oregonian listed the work as one of the city 's " worst sculptures " . In the article , Claire Kelly , director of Portland State University 's art and architecture program said , " She 's more than simplistic , she 's absurd . It 's not a piece that belongs on public display . " In contrast , Monk Magazine described the sculpture as " the best @-@ looking girl in Portland " with " her stunning eyes and voluptuous figure " . According to the magazine , Portland is the only city in the United States with a " flasher statue " . The sculpture was included in Kate Chynoweth 's 2003 book , The Best Places to Kiss in the Northwest : A Romantic Travel Guide , as one of Portland 's " romantic highlights " .

 According to an article by Richard Corliss published in Time , " In a way , Franken has been running for office since the late ' 70s . " Corliss also hinted at Franken 's " possibly ironic role as a relentless self @-@ promoter " in proclaiming the 1980s " the Al Franken Decade " and saying , " Vote for me , Al Franken . You 'll be glad you did ! " In 1999 , Franken released a parody book , Why Not Me ? , detailing his hypothetical campaign for President in 2000 . He had been a strong supporter of Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone and was deeply affected by the Senator 's death in a plane crash shortly before the 2002 election . Wellstone was a mentor and political and personal role model for Franken , with Franken stating his hopes of following in the late Senator ’ s footsteps . 
 Franken said he learned that 21 % of Americans received most of their news from talk radio , an almost exclusively conservative medium . Said Franken , " I didn 't want to sit on the sidelines , and I believed Air America could make a difference . " In November 2003 , Franken talked about moving to his home state of Minnesota to run for the Senate . At the time the seat , once held by Wellstone , was occupied by Republican Norm Coleman . In 2005 , Franken announced his move to Minnesota : " I can tell you honestly , I don 't know if I 'm going to run , but I 'm doing the stuff I need to do in order to do it . " In late 2005 , Franken started his own political action committee , called Midwest Values PAC . By early 2007 , the PAC raised more than $ 1 million . 
 Franken was the subject of the 2006 documentary film Al Franken : God Spoke , which was , according to the New York Times , " an investigation of the phenomenon of ideological celebrity . " 
 Franken initially supported the Iraq War but opposed the 2007 troop surge . In an interview with MSNBC ’ s Joe Scarborough , Franken said that he " believed Colin Powell " , whose presentation at the United Nations convinced him that the war was necessary . However , since then he had come to believe that " we were misled into the war " and urged the Democratically controlled Congress to refuse to pass appropriations bills to fund the war if they don 't include timetables for leaving Iraq . In an interview with Josh Marshall , Franken said of the Democrats , " I think we 've gotta make President George W. Bush say , ' OK , I 'm cutting off funding because I won 't agree to a timetable . ' " 
 Franken favors transitioning to a universal health care system , with the provision that every child in America should receive health care coverage immediately . Franken objects to efforts to privatize Social Security or cut benefits . He favors raising the cap on wages to which Social Security taxes apply . On his 2008 campaign website , he voiced support for cutting subsidies for oil companies , increasing money available for college students , and cutting interest rates on student loans . 
 During the 2008 election , New York state officials asserted that Al Franken Inc. had failed to carry required workers ' compensation insurance for employees who assisted him with his comedy and public speaking from 2002 to 2005 . Franken paid a $ 25 @,@ 000 fine to the state of New York upon being advised his corporation was out of compliance with the state 's workers ' compensation laws . At the same time , the California Franchise Tax Board reported that the same corporation owed more than $ 4 @,@ 743 @.@ 40 in taxes , fines , and associated penalties in the state of California for 2003 through 2007 because the corporation did not file tax returns in the state for those years . A Franken representative said that it followed the advice of an accountant who believed when the corporation stopped doing business in California that no further filing was required . Subsequently , Franken paid $ 70 @,@ 000 in back income taxes in 17 states dating back to 2003 , mostly from Franken 's speeches and other paid appearances . Franken said he paid the income tax in his state of residence , and he would seek retroactive credit for paying the taxes in the wrong states .

 2008 
 On January 29 , 2007 , Franken announced his departure from Air America Radio , and on the day of his final show , February 14 , Franken formally announced his candidacy for the United States Senate from Minnesota in 2008 . Challenging him for the Democratic – Farmer – Labor Party endorsement was Jack Nelson @-@ <unk> , a professor , author , and activist . Other candidates were trial lawyer Mike <unk> and attorney and human rights activist Jim Cohen , who had dropped out of the race earlier . Franken won the nomination with 65 % of the vote . 
 On July 8 , 2007 , Franken 's campaign stated that it expected to announce that Franken had raised more money than Republican opponent Norm Coleman during the second quarter of the year , taking in $ 1 @.@ 9 million to Coleman 's $ 1 @.@ 6 million , although in early July 2007 , Coleman 's $ 3 @.@ 8 million cash on hand exceeded Franken 's $ 2 million . 
 In late May 2008 , the Minnesota Republican Party released a letter regarding an article Franken had written for Playboy in 2000 entitled " Porn @-@ O @-@ Rama ! " . The letter , signed by six prominent GOP women , including a state senator and state representative , called on Franken to apologize for what they referred to as a " demeaning and degrading " article . A Franken campaign spokesman responded that , " Al had a long career as a satirist . But he understands the difference between what you say as a satirist and what you do as a senator . And as a Senator , Norm Coleman has disrespected the people of Minnesota by putting the <unk> and <unk> ahead of working families . And there 's nothing funny about that . " 
 On June 7 , 2008 , Franken was endorsed at the DFL convention . In a July 2008 interview with CNN , Franken was endorsed by Ben Stein , the noted entertainer , speechwriter , lawyer and author who is known for his conservative views and generally supports Republican candidates . Stein said of Franken , " He is my pal , and he is a really , really capable smart guy . I don 't agree with all of his positions , but he is a very impressive guy , and I think he should be in the Senate . " 
 During his campaign for the Senate , Franken was criticized for advising SNL creator Lorne Michaels on a political sketch ridiculing Senator John McCain 's ads attacking Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election . Coleman 's campaign reacted , saying , " Once again , he proves he 's more interested in entertainment than service , and ridiculing those with whom he disagrees . " 
 Preliminary reports on election night , November 4 , had Coleman ahead by over 700 votes , but the official results certified on November 18 , 2008 , had Coleman leading by only 215 votes . As the two candidates were separated by less than 0 @.@ 5 percent , the Secretary of State of Minnesota Mark Ritchie , authorized an automatic recount stipulated in Minnesota election law . In the recount , ballots and certifying materials were examined by hand , and candidates could file challenges to the legality of ballots or materials for inclusion or exclusion with regard to the recount . On January 5 , 2009 , the Minnesota State Canvassing Board certified the recounted vote totals , with Franken ahead by 225 votes . 
 On January 6 , 2009 , Coleman 's campaign filed an election contest , which led to a trial before a three @-@ judge panel . The trial ended on April 7 , when the panel ruled that 351 of 387 disputed absentee ballots were incorrectly rejected and ordered them counted . Counting those ballots raised Franken 's lead to 312 votes . Coleman appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court on April 20 . On April 24 , the Minnesota Supreme Court agreed to hear the <unk> and oral arguments were conducted on June 1 . 
 On June 30 , 2009 , the Minnesota Supreme Court unanimously rejected Coleman 's appeal and said that Franken was entitled to be certified as the winner . Shortly after the court 's decision , Coleman conceded . Governor Tim Pawlenty signed Franken ’ s election certificate that same evening .

 Franken was sworn into the Senate on July 7 , 2009 , 246 days after election . Franken was sworn in with the Bible of late Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone , whose old seat was set aside by Senate leaders for Franken . 
 On August 6 , 2009 , Franken presided over the confirmation vote of Sonia Sotomayor to be an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court . A year later , on August 5 , 2010 , Franken presided over the confirmation vote of Elena Kagan . His first piece of legislation , the Service Dogs for Veterans Act , which he wrote jointly with Republican Johnny <unk> , passed the Senate with unanimous consent , and established a program with the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to pair disabled veterans with service dogs . 
 A video began circulating on the Internet of Franken at the Minnesota State Fair on September 2 , 2009 , engaging in a discussion with a group of Tea Party protesters on health care reform , and soon went viral . The discussion was noted for its civility , in contrast to the explosive character of several other discussions between members of the 111th Congress and their constituents that had occurred over the summer . 
 During the debate on health care reform , Franken was one of the strongest supporters of a single @-@ payer system . He authored an amendment , called the Medical Loss Ratio , to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that required insurance companies spend at least 80 % of premiums on actual health care costs , rising to 85 % for large group plans . In June 2013 , it was reported that the amendment had saved consumers $ 3 @.@ 4 billion on premiums and resulted in nationwide rebates of $ 1 @.@ 1 billion in 2012 and $ 500 million in 2013 . On September 30 , 2013 , Franken voted to remove a provision which would repeal the medical device tax in Obamacare from a government funding bill . Although Franken says he is in favor of the provision , he disagreed with it being used as a condition in preventing the 2013 federal government shutdown . 
 Citing the case of Jamie Leigh Jones , Franken offered an amendment to the 2010 Defense Appropriations bill that would withhold defense contracts from companies that restrict their employees from taking workplace sexual assault , battery and discrimination cases to court . It passed the U.S. Senate in November 2010 , 68 to 30 in a roll @-@ call vote . 
 In May 2010 , Franken proposed a financial reform legislation amendment which would create a board to select which credit rating agency would evaluate a given security ; currently any companies issuing a security may select which company evaluates the security . The amendment was passed ; however , the financial industry lobbied to have Franken 's amendment removed from the final bill . Negotiations between the Senate and House , whose version of financial reform did not include such a provision , resulted in the amendment 's being watered down to require only a series of studies being done upon the issue for two years . After the studies , if the Securities and Exchange Commission has not implemented another solution to the conflict of interest problem , Franken 's solution will go into effect . 
 In August 2010 , Franken made faces and hand gestures and rolled his eyes while Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell delivered a speech in opposition to the confirmation of Elena Kagan to the U.S. Supreme Court . Franken 's actions prompted McConnell to remark , " This isn 't Saturday Night Live , Al . " Following Kagan 's confirmation , Franken delivered a handwritten apology to McConnell and issued a public statement saying that McConnell had a right " to give his speech with the presiding officer just listening respectfully . " 
 The National Journal reported in 2013 that Franken supports the National Security Agency ’ s data mining programs , believing they have saved lives , and that " I can assure you , this is not about spying on the American people . ” 
 When Franken declared his intention to seek re @-@ election in 2014 , his seat was thought to be a top target for the Republicans due to his very slim margin of victory in the previous election . However Politico reported that his high approval rating , large war chest , and the Republicans ' struggle to find a top @-@ tier candidate meant that he was a " heavy favorite " to win re @-@ election , a view subsequently confirmed in the election , which Franken won comfortably . 
 The Associated Press has noted that contrary to expectations , Franken has not sought out the media spotlight : " He rarely talks to the Washington press corps , has shed his comedic persona and focused on policy , working to be taken seriously . " In interviews he has expressed his desire to be known for focusing on constituency work , keeping his head down and working hard .

 = Dennis Bergkamp = 
 Dennis Nicolaas Maria Bergkamp ( Dutch pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; born 10 May 1969 ) is a Dutch former professional footballer , who is the assistant manager to Frank de Boer at Ajax . Originally a wide midfielder , Bergkamp was moved to main striker and then to second striker , where he remained throughout his playing career . Bergkamp has been described by Jan Mulder as having " the finest technique " of any Dutch international and a " dream for a striker " by teammate Thierry Henry . 
 The son of an electrician , Bergkamp was born in Amsterdam and played as an amateur in the lower leagues . He was spotted by Ajax at age 11 and made his professional debut in 1986 . Good form led to an international call @-@ up a year later , attracting the attention of several European clubs . Bergkamp signed for Italian club Internazionale in 1993 , where he had two disappointing seasons . After joining Arsenal in 1995 , he rejuvenated his career , helping the club to win three Premier League titles , four FA Cup trophies , and reach the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final , which marked his last appearance as a player . With the Netherlands national team , Bergkamp surpassed Faas Wilkes 's record to become the country 's top goalscorer of all time in 1998 , a record later eclipsed by Patrick Kluivert , Robin van Persie and Klaas @-@ Jan Huntelaar . 
 Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in his generation , Bergkamp finished third twice in the FIFA World Player of the Year award and was selected by Pelé as one of the FIFA 100 greatest living players . In 2007 , he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame , the first and so far only Dutch player ever to receive such honour . Due to his fear of flying , Bergkamp has been affectionately nicknamed the " Non @-@ Flying Dutchman " by Arsenal supporters . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Born in Amsterdam , Bergkamp was the last of Wim and <unk> Bergkamp 's four sons . He was brought up in a working @-@ class suburb , in a family aspiring to reach middle @-@ class status . His father , an electrician and amateur footballer in the lower leagues , named him in honour of Scottish striker Denis Law . To comply with Dutch given name customs , an extra " n " was inserted in Bergkamp 's first name by his father after it was not accepted by the registrar . Bergkamp was raised as a Catholic by his family and regularly attended church during his childhood . Although in later years he said visits to church did not appeal to him , Bergkamp still maintains his faith .

 = = = Ajax : 1986 – 1993 = = = 
 Bergkamp was brought up through Ajax 's youth system , joining the club at age 11 . Manager Johan Cruyff gave him his professional debut on 14 December 1986 against Roda JC ; the game ended in a 2 – 0 victory for Ajax . Bergkamp scored his first senior goal for the club against HFC Haarlem on 22 February 1987 in a match Ajax won 6 – 0 . He went on to make 23 appearances in the 1986 – 87 season , including a European debut against Malmö FF in the 1986 – 87 European Cup Winners ' Cup , earning him praise . Ajax won the competition , beating Lokomotive Leipzig 1 – 0 as Bergkamp made an appearance as a substitute . 
 In later seasons , Bergkamp established himself as a first @-@ team player for Ajax . This culminated in a period of success for the club , which won the Eredivisie title in the 1989 – 90 season for the first time in five years . Bergkamp scored 29 goals in 36 games the following season and became the joint top goalscorer in the league , sharing the accolade with PSV Eindhoven striker Romário . Ajax won the 1992 UEFA Cup Final , beating Torino through the away goals ruling . They then defeated SC Heerenveen 6 – 2 in the final of the KNVB Cup on 20 May 1993 . Bergkamp was the top scorer in the Eredivisie from 1991 to 1993 , and was voted Dutch Footballer of the Year in 1992 and 1993 . In total , he scored 122 goals in 239 games for his hometown club . 
 = = = Internazionale : 1993 – 1995 = = = 
 Bergkamp attracted the attention of several European clubs as a result of his performances for Ajax . Cruyff advised him not to join Real Madrid , one of the teams said to have been interested in him . But Bergkamp was insistent on playing in Italy . He considered Serie A " the biggest league at the time " and preferred a move to either Juventus or Internazionale . On 16 February 1993 , Bergkamp agreed a £ 7 @.@ 1 million move to the latter club in a deal which included his Ajax teammate Wim Jonk . Upon signing , Bergkamp said Inter " met all my demands . The most important thing for me was the stadium , the people at the club and their style of play . " 
 Bergkamp made his debut against <unk> on 29 August 1993 at the San Siro in a 2 – 1 victory . He scored his first goal for the club against Cremonese in September 1993 but had a difficult time against the highly organised and resolute Italian defences , scoring a further seven goals in the league . This was partly due to manager Osvaldo Bagnoli 's inability to find a stable forward partnership , preferring Bergkamp in a three with Uruguayan Rubén Sosa and Italian Salvatore Schillaci . Inter 's poor league form culminated in the sacking of Bagnoli in February 1994 and his replacement by Gianpiero Marini , a member of Italy 's World Cup winning squad of 1982 . The club finished 13th in Serie A , one point away from relegation , but enjoyed success in the UEFA Cup , beating Austria Salzburg in the final over two legs . Bergkamp was the competition 's joint top goalscorer with eight goals and scored a hat @-@ trick against Rapid București in the first round . 
 In Bergkamp 's second season at Inter , the club changed managers again , appointing Ottavio Bianchi . Bergkamp endured a disappointing campaign , troubled with stress injuries and fatigue from the 1994 World Cup . He managed to score five goals in 26 appearances . Off the field , Bergkamp 's relationship with the Italian press and fans became uncomfortable . His shy persona and his propensity to go home after matches was interpreted as apathy . Because of his poor performance on the pitch , one Italian publication renamed their award given to the worst performance of the week , L <unk> della <unk> ( Donkey of the Week ) to Bergkamp della <unk> . Inter ended the league season in sixth position and failed to retain the UEFA Cup , with the club eliminated in the second round . In February 1995 , the club was purchased by Italian businessman and fan Massimo Moratti , who promised to invest heavily in the squad . Bergkamp 's future in the first team was uncertain following the signing of Maurizio Ganz a month after the takeover . 
 = = = Arsenal : 1995 – 2006 = = = 
 As Moratti prepared to make wholesale changes at the club , Bergkamp left Inter and signed with Arsenal in June 1995 for a transfer fee estimated at £ 7 @.@ 5 million . He became manager Bruce Rioch 's first signing at Arsenal and broke the club 's transfer fee record set at £ 2 @.@ 5 million . Bergkamp 's arrival at the club was significant not only because he was an established international footballer who looked to have his best years ahead of him but also because he was a major contributor to Arsenal 's return to success after much decline in the mid @-@ 1990s . On the opening day of the 1995 – 96 league season , Bergkamp made his full debut against Middlesbrough . He struggled to adapt to the English game and failed to score in the club 's next six league matches , prompting ridicule by the national press . On 23 September 1995 , Bergkamp scored his first and second goals for Arsenal against Southampton at Highbury . Bergkamp ended his first season with 33 appearances and a goal tally of 11 , helping Arsenal finish fifth and earn a place in the UEFA Cup by scoring the winner against Bolton Wanderers on the final day of the season . 
 The appointment of Arsène Wenger as Arsenal manager in September 1996 marked a turning point in Bergkamp 's career . Wenger , who had moderate success coaching in France and Japan , recognised Bergkamp 's talent and wanted to use him as a fulcrum of the team 's forward play . Both were advocates of a continental style of attacking football , and Wenger 's decision to impose a strict fitness and health regime pleased Bergkamp . Despite making fewer appearances in the 1996 – 97 season , Bergkamp was more influential in the first team , creating 13 assists . Against Tottenham Hotspur in November 1996 , he set up an 88th @-@ minute winner for captain Tony Adams to volley in using his left foot . He then scored in injury time , controlling a high ball with his left foot and evading his marker Stephen Carr in a tight area to set up his shot . Bergkamp received his first red card against Sunderland in January 1997 for a high tackle on midfielder Paul Bracewell in the 26th minute . Arsenal went on to lose the match 1 – 0 , but a run of eight wins in their final 16 matches gave the club a third @-@ place finish , missing out on a spot in the Champions League via goal difference . 
 Bergkamp was instrumental the following season in helping Arsenal complete a domestic league and cup double . He became the club 's top scorer with 22 goals and recorded a strike rate of 0 @.@ 57 . Arsenal 's achievement was all the more astonishing given that the team , written off by many in December 1997 , had made ground on reigning Premier League champions Manchester United . Early in the season away to Leicester City at Filbert Street on 23 August 1997 , Bergkamp scored his first hat @-@ trick for the club . The third goal , which he regarded as his favourite for Arsenal , required just one touch to control the ball in the penalty box , another to flick it past his marker Matt Elliott before juggling it with his feet and shooting past goalkeeper Kasey Keller . After the match , Leicester manager Martin O 'Neill was gracious enough to admit that Bergkamp 's was " the best hat @-@ trick I 've ever seen " . In an FA Cup quarter @-@ final replay against West Ham United on 17 March 1998 , Bergkamp was sent off for elbowing midfielder Steve Lomas and missed three matches due to suspension . He played no further part in Arsenal 's season after <unk> his hamstring against Derby County on 29 April 1998 , missing the 1998 FA Cup Final . Bergkamp was consoled with the PFA Players ' Player of the Year award , becoming only the third non @-@ British player to be recognised by his fellow professionals as the outstanding performer in English football . 
 After an effective 1998 World Cup campaign with the national team , Bergkamp had another productive season in 1998 – 99 . Although Arsenal failed to retain the Premier League after losing the title on the final day of the season to Manchester United , Bergkamp was the club 's second @-@ top scorer with 16 goals . The team were also defeated in a FA Cup semi @-@ final replay against Manchester United in April 1999 . With the score 1 – 1 heading into injury time , Arsenal were awarded a penalty after midfielder Ray Parlour was brought down by Phil Neville inside the 18 @-@ yard box . Bergkamp took the penalty shot , but it was saved by goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel . In the second half of extra time , Ryan Giggs scored the winner , a goal regarded by many as the greatest in the competition 's history . After this miss , Bergkamp did not take another penalty for the remainder of his career . 
 The 1999 – 2000 season proved to be a frustrating one for both Arsenal and Bergkamp . The club finished second in the league , 18 points behind Manchester United , and lost in the 2000 UEFA Cup Final to Turkish opponents Galatasaray on penalties . The departure of compatriot Marc Overmars and French midfielder Emmanuel Petit in the close season led to speculation over Bergkamp 's future . He ultimately agreed terms on a contract extension in December 2000 . Despite an array of new signings made in the 2000 – 01 season , Arsenal were runners @-@ up in the league for a third year in succession . The emergence of Thierry Henry and Sylvain Wiltord as the main strikers saw Bergkamp 's first @-@ team opportunities limited as a result . He was used as a late substitute in Liverpool 's win over Arsenal in the 2001 FA Cup Final . 
 Success finally came in the 2001 – 02 season . Arsenal regained the league , beating Manchester United at Old Trafford in the penultimate game of the season to complete the club 's second double under Wenger ; Arsenal defeated Chelsea 2 – 0 to win the FA Cup four days prior . Bergkamp played in 33 league matches , setting up 15 goals , one of which was against Juventus in the second group stage of the Champions League . Holding off two markers , he twisted and turned before feeding the ball to Freddie Ljungberg in the penalty box to score . Bergkamp headed in the winner against Liverpool in a FA Cup fourth @-@ round tie on 27 January 2002 , but was shown a red card for a two @-@ footed lunge on defender Jamie Carragher , who himself was sent off for throwing a coin into the crowd . He was subsequently banned for three matches ( two league , one FA Cup round ) . Bergkamp appealed for his ban , but was unsuccessful . He made his return against Newcastle United on 3 March 2002 . Early in the match , Arsenal midfielder Robert Pirès played a low pass from the left flank to Bergkamp in the edge of the opponent area with his back to goal . Under pressure from his marker Nikos <unk> , Bergkamp controlled the ball with one flick and went around the other side before placing the ball precisely into the bottom right @-@ hand corner to score . Wenger described the goal as " unbelievable " , adding " It was not only a magnificent goal but a very important one – I enjoyed it a lot " . Bergkamp featured in nine out of the last ten league games , forming a productive partnership with Ljungberg . 
 Bergkamp reached a personal landmark during the 2002 – 03 season , scoring his 100th goal for Arsenal against Oxford United in a FA Cup third @-@ round tie on 4 January 2003 . In the league , Arsenal failed to retain the championship despite having led by eight points in March 2003 . They did , however , win the FA Cup for a second successive year , beating Southampton in the 2003 FA Cup Final . On 20 July 2003 , Bergkamp signed a one @-@ year extension at the club . The 2003 – 04 season ended on a high point for Bergkamp as Arsenal reclaimed the league title , becoming the first English team in more than a century to go through the entire domestic league season unbeaten . Against Leicester City in the final league match of the campaign with the score tied at 1 – 1 , Bergkamp set up the winner with a pass to captain Patrick Vieira . Vieira rounded the goalkeeper and scored . The team , dubbed " The Invincibles " did not achieve similar dominance in Europe ; Arsenal were beaten by Chelsea in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League over two legs . Bergkamp committed himself to Arsenal at the end of the season , signing a further extension to his contract . 
 Bergkamp started in 29 league matches in the 2004 – 05 season , but Arsenal 's title defence ended unsuccessfully . The team finished second , 12 points behind Chelsea . At home against Middlesbrough on 22 August 2004 , Bergkamp acted as captain for the injured Vieira in a match where Arsenal came back from 1 – 3 down to win 5 – 3 and equal Nottingham Forest 's record of 42 league matches undefeated . Against Sheffield United in the FA Cup on 19 February 2005 , Bergkamp was shown a straight red card by referee Neale Barry for shoving defender Danny Cullip . His appeal of the decision was rejected by The Football Association , meaning that he missed the club 's next three domestic games . In Arsenal 's final home match of the season against Everton , Bergkamp had a man of the match game , scoring once and assisting three of the goals in a 7 – 0 win . Bergkamp was moved by Arsenal supporters chanting " one more year " , describing it as " quite special " . " They obviously feel there is another year left in me , so that 's great as it shows they 're really behind me , " he said . Following Arsenal 's penalty shootout victory over Manchester United in the 2005 FA Cup Final , he signed a one @-@ year contract extension . 
 The team finished fourth in the league in Bergkamp 's final season at Arsenal . Bergkamp scored an injury @-@ time winner against FC Thun on Matchday 1 of the Champions League , having come on as a substitute in the 72nd minute . After much campaigning from Arsenal supporters , the club designated one of its Highbury matchday themes , organised to commemorate the stadium 's final season as home of Arsenal , to Dennis Bergkamp . " Bergkamp Day " took place on 15 April 2006 and saw Arsenal up against West Bromwich Albion . It celebrated the player 's contribution to Arsenal ; fans were given commemorative orange ' <unk> ' T @-@ shirts – the colour of his national team , his initials and his squad number . Bergkamp himself came on as a second @-@ half substitute and set up the winning Pirès goal moments after Nigel <unk> had levelled the scoreline . Fittingly , Bergkamp 's 89th @-@ minute goal proved to be his last for Arsenal in competitive football . Bergkamp was an unused substitute in his final match for Arsenal against Barcelona in the Champions League final ; Barcelona scored twice in the last 13 minutes to overturn Arsenal 's early lead and win the competition . 
 Bergkamp was the focus of the first match at Arsenal 's new ground , the Emirates Stadium . On 22 July 2006 , a testimonial was played in his honour at the new stadium as Arsenal played his old club Ajax . Bergkamp kicked off the match with his father , Wim , and son , Mitchel . All four children acted as the match 's mascots . The first half was played by members of Arsenal and Ajax 's current squads , while the second was played by famous ex @-@ players from both sides , including Ian Wright , Vieira , Overmars , Petit and David Seaman for Arsenal , and Cruyff , Marco van Basten , Danny Blind , Frank and Ronald de Boer for Ajax . Arsenal won the match 2 – 1 with goals from Henry and Nwankwo Kanu . Klaas @-@ Jan Huntelaar had earlier opened the scoring for Ajax , making him the first goalscorer at the Emirates Stadium .

 Bergkamp made his international debut for the Netherlands national team against Italy on 26 September 1990 as a substitute for Frank de Boer . He scored his first goal for the team against Greece on 21 November 1990 . Bergkamp was selected for Euro 1992 , where his national team were the defending champions . Although Bergkamp impressed , scoring three goals in the tournament , the team lost on penalties to eventual champions Denmark . 
 In the qualification for the 1994 FIFA World Cup , Bergkamp scored five goals and was selected for the finals , staged in the United States . He featured in every game for the national team , getting goals against Morocco in the group stages and the Republic of Ireland in the round @-@ of @-@ 16 . Bergkamp scored the second goal for the Netherlands against Brazil , but the team lost 3 – 2 , exiting in the quarter @-@ finals . At Euro 1996 , Bergkamp scored against Switzerland and set up striker Patrick Kluivert 's consolation goal against England , who advanced into the quarter @-@ finals . 
 Against Wales in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification on 9 November 1996 , he scored his first hat @-@ trick for the national team . The Netherlands finished first in their group and qualified for the 1998 FIFA World Cup , held in France . Bergkamp scored three times in the competition , including a memorable winning goal in the final minute of the quarterfinal against Argentina . He took one touch to control a long 60 @-@ yard aerial pass from Frank de Boer , brought the ball down through Argentine defender Roberto Ayala 's legs , and finally finished by firing a volley with the outside of his right foot , past keeper Carlos Roa at a tight angle from the right . The goal , cited by Bergkamp as his favourite in his career , was his 36th for the national team , overtaking Faas Wilkes as the record goalscorer . In the semi @-@ finals , the Netherlands lost to Brazil on penalties after drawing 1 – 1 in normal time . Bergkamp made the All @-@ Star team of the tournament , alongside Frank de Boer and Edgar Davids . 
 On 9 October 1999 , Bergkamp scored his final goal for the Netherlands , against Brazil . As the Netherlands were co @-@ hosts for Euro 2000 , the team automatically qualified for the tournament and were considered favourites . In the semi @-@ finals , the Netherlands lost 3 – 1 on penalties to Italy . Following the defeat , Bergkamp announced his retirement from international football , choosing to focus on his club career . His final goal tally of 37 goals in 79 appearances was overtaken by Patrick Kluivert in June 2003 . 
 = = Coaching career = = 
 Upon retiring , Bergkamp insisted he would not move into coaching . He turned down an offer to scout for Arsenal and instead concentrated on travelling and spending time with his family . However , in April 2008 , he began a fast @-@ track coaching diploma for former Dutch international footballers and undertook a trainee role at Ajax . Having completed the Coach <unk> <unk> course by the KNVB , Bergkamp was appointed assistant to Johan <unk> for the newly formed Netherlands B team on 26 October 2008 . For the 2008 – 09 season , Bergkamp returned to Ajax in a formal coaching position with responsibility for the D2 ( U12 ) youth team . Following the promotion of Frank de Boer as manager of Ajax in December 2010 , Bergkamp was appointed assistant manager to Fred Grim , dealing with Ajax ' flagship A1 ( U19 ) youth team . 
 As of August 2011 , Bergkamp has been De Boer 's assistant at Ajax .

 Bergkamp has been married to <unk> <unk> since 16 June 1993 . The couple have four children : Estelle Deborah , Mitchel Dennis , Yasmin Naomi and Saffron Rita . His nephew , Roland Bergkamp currently plays for Sparta Rotterdam , having previously played for Brighton & Hove Albion . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Bergkamp 's nickname is the Non @-@ Flying Dutchman due to his fear of flying . This stemmed from an incident with the Netherlands national team at the 1994 World Cup where the engine of the plane cut out during a flight , prompting a journalist to joke about having a bomb in his bag . Following this incident , Bergkamp decided he would never fly again but did consider seeking psychiatric help : 
 I 've got this problem and I have to live with it . I can 't do anything about it , it is a psychological thing and I can 't explain it . I have not flown on a plane for two years . The Dutch FA has been sympathetic , so have Arsenal , so far . I am considering psychiatric help . I can 't fly . I just freeze . I get panicky . It starts the day before , when I can 't sleep . 
 The condition severely limited his ability to play in away matches in European competitions and to travel with the national team . In some cases , he would travel overland by car or train , but the logistics of some matches were such that he would not travel at all . In the build @-@ up to Arsenal 's Champions League match against Olympique Lyonnais in February 2001 , Wenger spoke of his concerns for Bergkamp travelling by train and car , because of the exertions involved . 
 = = Style of play = = 
 Bergkamp was schooled in Total Football , a playing style and philosophy which relied on versatility . This was primarily to maximise the footballer 's potential ; players tried out every outfield position before finding one that suited them best . Every age group at Ajax played in the same style and formation as the first team – 3 – 4 – 3 – to allow individuals to slot in without effort when moving up the pyramid . Bergkamp " played in every position apart from goalie " and believed he benefited from the experience of playing as a defender , as it helped him " know how they think and how to beat them " . When he made his debut as a substitute against Roda JC , Bergkamp was positioned on the right wing , where he remained for three years . 
 During his time at Inter Milan , Bergkamp was switched to the position of a main striker , but failed to cooperate with his offensive partner Ruben Sosa , whom he later called " selfish " . Furthermore , due to his introverted character , he was accused of lacking consistency and leadership skills by the Italian press , and struggled to replicate his previous form during his time with Inter . When Bergkamp joined Arsenal in 1995 , he enjoyed a successful strike partnership with Wright , and in later seasons Anelka and Henry , playing in his preferred position as a creative second striker . The arrival of Overmars in the 1997 – 98 season enhanced Bergkamp 's play , as he was getting more of the ball . Between August and October 1997 , he scored seven goals in seven league matches . A similar rapport developed between him and Ljungberg during the 2001 – 02 season . 
 Although he was known for his ability to score several goals for his team as a forward , Bergkamp was also capable of playing behind a lone striker , where he essentially functioned in the number 10 role as a playmaking attacking midfielder or deep @-@ lying forward , due to his ball skills and creative ability , which enabled him to drop deep between the lines and link @-@ up play . A quick , elegant , intelligent , and technically gifted player , his excellent first touch , quick feet , dribbling ability , and change of pace enabled him to beat defenders in one on one situations , while his attacking movement , physique , balance , and close control allowed him to hold up the ball and create space for team mates ; his vision and passing range with both feet subsequently allowed him to provide assists for on @-@ running strikers . Bergkamp often stated that he preferred playing in this deeper role , as he derived more pleasure from assisting goals , rather than scoring them himself . 
 Throughout his playing career Bergkamp was accused of diving , and was referred to as a " cheat " and " dirty player " for retaliating against players who had previously challenged him , something his former manager Wenger denied . In an interview with The Times in 2004 , he said that while he was at Inter Milan , he realised the importance of being mentally tough in order to survive : " A lot of people there try to hurt you , not just physically but mentally as well , and coming from the easygoing culture in Holland , I had to adopt a tougher approach . There , it was a case of two strikers up against four or five hard defenders who would stop at nothing . " Bergkamp says his aggression often stems from frustration .

 Bergkamp has received several accolades during his playing career . He twice finished in third place for the 1993 and 1996 FIFA World Player of the Year award and was named in FIFA 100 , a list compiled by footballer Pelé of the 125 greatest living footballers . In his club career , Bergkamp won two successive Dutch Footballer of the Year awards in 1991 and 1992 and was the Eredivisie Top Scorer winner for three consecutive seasons ( 1990 – 91 to 1992 – 93 ) . He was named the FWA Footballer of the Year and PFA Players ' Player of the Year in April and May 1998 and made the PFA Team of the Year for the 1997 – 98 season . Bergkamp also achieved a unique feat in being voted first , second and third on Match of the Day 's Goal of the Month competition in August 1997 . 
 In April 2007 , Bergkamp was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame by viewers of BBC 's Football Focus . A year later , he was voted second by Arsenal fans behind Thierry Henry in a list of the 50 Gunners Greatest Players . In February 2014 , Arsenal unveiled a statue of Bergkamp outside the Emirates Stadium to honour his time at the club . A statue of Dennis Bergkamp will be erected outside the KNVB headquarters in Zeist , as he has been chosen as the best Dutch international soccer player in the period 1990 @-@ 2015 . The statue will join those of the eleven of the century , erected in 1999 , with statues of Johan Cruijff , Ruud Gullit , Frank Rijkaard and Marco van Basten amongst others there .

 The Chicago Marathon is a major marathon held yearly in Chicago in Cook County , Illinois , United States . Alongside the Boston , New York , London , Berlin , and Tokyo Marathons , it is one of the six World Marathon Majors . Thus , it is also an IAAF Gold Label race . The October 9 , 2016 running will be the 39th anniversary of the race . The first race was held on September 25 , 1977 under the original name the Mayor Daley Marathon , which drew a field of 4 @,@ 200 runners . The race has been held every year since , except in 1987 when only a half @-@ marathon was run . It is among the fastest growing marathon road races in the world , due in part to its largely fast and flat course which facilitates the pursuit of personal records and world record performances . The race has achieved its elite status among marathons by developing relationship with sponsors who provide prize money to lure elite runners who have produced American and world record performances . Since 2008 the race has been sponsored by Bank of America , and is officially known as the Bank of America Chicago Marathon . 
 The race is limited to 45 @,@ 000 runners and only runners who finish within 6 ½ hours are officially timed . Those wishing to participate can register after either meeting a time qualifying standard or being selected through a general lottery . Although the race has limited registration , exceptions include elite runners and charity representatives . Increasingly , local ( e.g. , Chicago 's Children 's Memorial Hospital ) , national ( e.g. , American Cancer Society ) and global ( e.g. , Global Business Assist , Team World Vision ) charities and humanitarian organizations encourage sponsored participation in the event as a means of fund raising . 
 = = History = = 
 The first marathon at the 1896 Games of the I Olympiad generated interest in the sport which led to similar races throughout most western countries and across the United States . While marathons sporadically occurred in New York City and St. Louis , the Boston Marathon had established an annual marathon in 1897 , soon to be followed by Chicago . Beginning in 1905 , the Chicago Marathon ( organized first by the Illinois Athletic Club 1905 to 1909 , then sponsored by the Chicago Daily News after 1910 ) was held annually , with significant community and spectator support , until the early 1920s . 
 The First Chicago Marathon was run on Saturday , September 23 , 1905 . That first race began in Evanston and finished in front of a standing @-@ room @-@ only paying crowd at Washington Park race track . In a stunning upset , a reported 100 @,@ 000 or more spectators watched <unk> Metzner come from behind to steal a late @-@ race victory from the favored Louis Marks . With that first race , the Chicago Marathon began an annual run of epic races that continued until the early 1920s on a revised course that largely resembles today 's marathon route . Over the years elite fields included Olympic champions , world records were continually sought , and the marathon continued to inspire Chicago communities and spectators until challenges of the early 1920s sidelined the event . 
 It was not until the health consciousness of the 1960s that marathon growth gained traction in the eyes of the nation . Frank Shorter 's 1972 Games of the XX Olympiad marathon victory represented the convergence of many middle @-@ class American ideals . Then the 1976 New York City Marathon , which was the first New York City Marathon to embrace the five borough course , popularized the big city marathon . As the New York marathon began to grow exponentially in the 1970s , the Chicago Marathon was established as a rival to the New York City Marathon . By the mid @-@ 1980s , the Chicago Marathon was ensconced as one of the big four marathons . During the mid @-@ 1980s , it was named America 's Marathon / Chicago and opened up the way for appearance payments . Joan Benoit Samuelson described the Chicago Marathon 's of the mid @-@ 1980s as " The World 's Marathon " . The Bank of America Chicago Marathon is an open race with no qualifying time to participate . 
 The Modern Era Chicago Marathon was founded over the objection of Ed Kelly , Chicago Parks Superintendent who refused permission to run in the parks or along the Lake Michigan lakefront . With the help of Lee Flaherty , the event 's founder who operated out of Flair House in the Near North Side community area of Chicago , Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley 's support for the marathon was enlisted . Although Mayor Daley died , his successor Michael Anthony Bilandic approved the race and got Kelly on board . Michael Bilandic , a runner , and his wife actually passed out medals at the first marathon on September 25 , 1977 . This first edition of the modern Chicago Marathon was called the Mayor Daley Marathon . Flaherty footed the bill for the first race , which had no sponsors . He again footed the bill in 1978 when the race was again called the Mayor Daley Marathon . In 1979 , however , Beatrice Foods became the first race sponsor . 
 In the early years the Chicago Marathon was held in August . It has from its inception with 4 @,@ 200 runners and 2 @,@ 128 finishers been one of the nation 's largest marathons . The 2000 running was second only to New York . The 1979 and 1980 events , however , continued to be gatherings of amateur runners . By 1982 , the race finally had sufficient prize money to attract world class athletes . The 1982 was the first with world class times such as the 2 : 10 : 59 by Greg Meyer , the last American @-@ born male to win the race . By 1983 , the Chicago Marathon had achieved its status as one of America 's most important marathons . In 1984 , Beatrice raised the purse to $ 250 @,@ 000 ( $ 50 @,@ 000 more than New York 's ) . The race had become a legitimate rival to New York and continues to vie for top runners . The 1985 race was spectacular with Steve Jones breaking his own course record ( 2 seconds short of the world record ) and Joan Benoit Samuelson the 1984 Olympic Champion , two @-@ time defending Chicago Marathon Champion and Olympic Bronze Medalist , Rosa Mota and the fourth place Olympic finisher and world record setting Ingrid Kristiansen . Benoit set a record that stood nearly a generation . At that time , it was considered the premier marathon in the United States , if not the world . Although 1986 had 40 world @-@ class runners among the 8 @,@ 000 participants the times paled in comparison . Beatrice dropped out as a sponsor in 1987 . Because of this only a half @-@ marathon race was held that year and the marathon was moved to the spring of 1988 and attracted <unk> Brewing Company to sponsor the 1988 Old Style Chicago Marathon . The race resulted in three women who had been passed over for the 1988 Games of the XXIV Olympiad placing in the top positions . In 1991 , <unk> discontinued its sponsorship and both the prize money and performances waned . In 1992 , the race again had no sponsorship , but 1993 brought new sponsor LaSalle Bank . In 1994 , the race became the LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon . In 1996 , LaSalle Bank purchased the Chicago Marathon from Major Events , Inc . , who had purchased the race three years prior from Flaherty . In 1998 , the race began using transponder timing . In 2001 , when Catherine <unk> broke the women 's world record marathon time , both the men 's and women 's then @-@ current world records had been set at the Chicago Marathon . For 2008 , the race was sponsored by Bank of America following the purchase of LaSalle Bank from ABN <unk> to Bank of America , and the new title will be in use . 
 In 2007 Bank of America acquired LaSalle Bank 's parent company ABN AMRO North America in 2007 and assumed the races title sponsorship . The 2007 race made history with the first ever CEO Marathon Challenge . The race featured a special competition among the CEOs , presidents , company owners and c @-@ suite executives of companies with at least $ 5 million in annual gross revenue ( $ 2 @.@ 5 million for women ) . The 2007 race also made history for having three ( men 's , women 's & men 's wheelchair ) of its four races decided in the final 100 meters in a day of record setting heat . The race was partially shut down early ( after three and a half hours ) as temperatures rose to an unseasonably hot 88 ° F ( 31 ° C ) , which surpassed both the temperature records for the Chicago Marathon and official Chicago records for October 7 . Over 10 @,@ 000 registrants chose not to run in the record temperatures , while 10 @,@ 934 people did not finish ( many were called after the course closed early for safety ) . One runner died , over 30 were hospitalized , and over 400 others sought medical attention . Marathon owner and sponsor Bank of America , which had just acquired LaSalle Bank , has denied culpability . Similar hot conditions have been experienced in other city centre races . In London in 2003 The British 10K also had extremely hot weather that affected many runners . 
 = = Course = = 
 The marathon course is a loop course , starting and ending at Grant Park . From here , the current course winds through 29 of the city 's neighborhoods . The course loop can be generally divided into three sections : North , West , and South . Near each of these directions , three of the city 's main stadiums are nearby at their turning points . Wrigley Field is near the north . The United Center is to the west . US Cellular Field is to the south . On the other hand , Soldier Field is located near the start / finish area . 
 For the first three miles , runners wind through Chicago 's downtown area . Eventually , they head north along LaSalle Street . 
 Runners are supported by 20 aid stations . Each are spread about 1 – 3 miles from each other . In addition , medical staff is available at each of the stations , and ambulatory services are scattered throughout the course . 
 Digital timers are positioned every 5 kilometers , as well as the halfway point .

 The Bank of America Chicago Marathon has grown significantly from its beginnings . In 1905 , 20 runners registered for the first Chicago Marathon , 15 actually started the race , and 7 finished . For the first " modern " marathon race in 1977 , just over 1 @,@ 000 people signed up for the race , with expected numbers of just 200 – 300 . In 1995 , 9 @,@ 000 people registered , and in 1999 , over 29 @,@ 000 people registered . The 2001 marathon run on October 7 reached its cap of 37 @,@ 500 , which was instituted after the 2000 race drew 33 @,@ 171 runners , just prior to the entry deadline on September 19 . In 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , and 2006 it reached its cap of 40 @,@ 000 . The October 10 , 2004 , October 9 , 2005 and October 22 , 2006 races reached their 40 @,@ 000 entrant caps on August 16 , July 14 , and May 26 respectively . On April 18 , 2007 , the 2007 race run on October 7 reached its cap of 45 @,@ 000 entrants . There was a late registration exemption whereby elite runners ( marathon times of less than 2 : 31 / 3 : 01 or half marathon times of 1 : 11 / 1 : 21 for ( men / women ) ) could register until September 1 even though the race had reached its registration cap in the spring . The 40 @,@ 000 registrants and 33 @,@ 000 finishers in 2003 made the Chicago Marathon the third or fourth largest marathon depending on which metric ( registrants or finishers ) is used . 
 The Chicago Marathon is entered by predominantly Caucasian entrants from middle- to upper @-@ middle @-@ class affluence with a wide range in age and near equality in the sexes . The Chicago Marathon has never excluded women . Historically , however , the women 's field has been smaller than the men 's . This seems to be the result of older age categories having large multiples of men to women , but the women are beginning to outnumber the men in the 20s age group of the field .

 World records have been broken at Chicago four times . In 1984 , Steve Jones broke the world record with 2 : 08 : 05 . In 1999 , Khalid <unk> was the first to surpass 2 : 06 : 00 with 2 : 05 : 42 . The women 's record was broken in two consecutive years . In 2001 , Catherine <unk> broke the record in 2 : 18 : 47 , and Paula Radcliffe surpassed that mark with 2 : 17 : 18 the year after . 
 Radcliffe 's world record is also the course record ; while the men 's record is 2 : 03 : 45 , set in the 2013 race by Dennis <unk> .

 Much of the marathon 's impact is derived from the tourism industry . More than 10 @,@ 000 of the runners in 2010 have indicated their first visit to Chicago . Of that , 6 @,@ 000 have come from 100 countries . Due to the travelers , the event increases hotel occupancy rates during the marathon . In the 2009 edition , the marathon contributed $ 150 million worth of activity . The local economy produced 1 @,@ 310 jobs .

 Although entrants have registered on a first @-@ come first @-@ served basis and elite runners have an extended deadline , numerous official charities have additional late registration rights to award . The 2007 event had 85 charity partners . The 2006 event raised US $ 9 @.@ 2 million for charity . Charity fundraising is now closely intertwined with the event as the runners now raise money for research , aid the suffering and heighten public awareness of different causes . The marathon offers all registrants the opportunity to sign up to run with a charity partner . The marathon recognizes four levels of charities based on the number of participants recruited . The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society required participants to raise $ 1 @,@ 400 to be a team member in 2004 . Children 's Memorial Hospital has a $ 500 requirement . This program has existed since 2001 . 2013 marked the first year ever ( since data was available in 2002 ) that the total number of charities had dropped , however the number of participants and the amount of funds raised continued to climb .

 = Criminal law in the Marshall Court = 
 The Marshall Court ( 1801 – 1835 ) heard forty @-@ one criminal law cases , slightly more than one per year . Among such cases are United States v. Simms ( 1803 ) , United States v. More ( 1805 ) , Ex parte Bollman ( 1807 ) , United States v. Hudson ( 1812 ) , Cohens v. Virginia ( 1821 ) , United States v. Perez ( 1824 ) , Worcester v. Georgia ( 1832 ) , and United States v. Wilson ( 1833 ) . 
 During Marshall 's tenure , the Supreme Court had no general appellate jurisdiction in criminal cases . The Court could review criminal convictions from the state courts , but not the lower federal courts , via writs of error . It only did so twice . The Court could hear original habeas petitions , but disclaimed the authority to grant the writ post @-@ conviction unless the sentence had already been completed . Thus , the majority of the Marshall Court 's opinions on criminal law were issued in response to questions certified by divided panels of the circuit courts by a certificate of division . 
 Most of the Marshall Court 's criminal opinions involved defining the elements of federal crimes . Criminal statutes considered by the Court during this period involved assimilative crimes , counterfeiting , embargoes , insurance fraud , piracy , and slave trading . But , the Court twice disclaimed the authority to define common law crimes not proscribed by Congressional statute . 
 The Marshall Court also issued important opinions regarding criminal procedure . Although the Court did not explicitly cite or quote constitutional provisions , its opinions remain influential in interpreting the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment and venue provision of Article Three . The Court also laid down the common law rules of evidence in federal courts , including the hearsay exception for party admissions and the narrowing of the best evidence rule . 
 = = Background = = 
 Under the Articles of Confederation , there were no general federal courts or crimes . Although the Articles authorized a federal court to punish " <unk> and felonies committed on the high seas , " and the Congress of the Confederation in 1775 created the Court of Appeals in Prize Cases , Congress soon devolved this power to the states . Rather than creating additional crimes , the Congress merely recommended to the states that they criminalize acts like piracy and counterfeiting . 
 Criminal law was considered in the framing of the Constitution . In addition to the criminal procedure provisions of Article Three , the Constitutional Convention discussed piracy , crimes against the law of nations , treason , and counterfeiting . As Alexander Hamilton noted in Federalist No. 21 , a " most palpable defect of the subsisting Confederation , is the total want of a sanction to its laws . The United States , as now composed , have no powers to exact obedience , or punish disobedience to their resolutions . . . . " 
 One of the first statutes passed by the First Congress , the Judiciary Act of 1789 , divided original jurisdiction for the trial of federal crimes between the district courts and the circuit courts . The district courts were given jurisdiction over all federal crimes " where no other punishment than whipping , not exceeding thirty stripes , a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars , or a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months , is to be inflicted . " The circuit courts were given concurrent jurisdiction over these crimes , and exclusive jurisdiction over all other federal crimes . The circuit courts also exercised appellate jurisdiction over the district courts , but only in civil cases . In capital cases , the Act provided that " the trial shall be had in the county where the offence , was committed , or where that cannot be done without great inconvenience , twelve petit jurors at least shall be summoned from thence . " " No other procedural provisions were included , probably because the legislators were simultaneously considering amendments which would provide such security . " 
 The Act of 1789 also placed the responsibility for prosecuting federal crimes in the United States Attorney for each federal judicial district . The Act provided that " there shall be appointed in each district " a " person learned in the law to act as attorney for the United States in such district , who shall be sworn or affirmed to the faithful execution of his office , whose duty it shall be to prosecute in such district all delinquents for crimes and offences , cognizable under the authority of the United States . " The Act authorized judges , justices , justices of the peace , and magistrates to issue arrest warrants . The Act provided a right to bail in non @-@ capital cases , and authorized bail in capital cases — by the district courts , circuit courts , and Supreme Court , or any individual judge of them — issued on an " exercise their discretion therein , regarding the nature and circumstances of the offence , and of the evidence , and the usages of law . " The 1789 act did not create federal prisons , but it did provide for the imprisonment of federal prisoners ( presumably in state prisons ) " at the expense of the United States . " 
 Many of the substantive federal crimes during this period were created by two omnibus pieces of legislation : the Crimes Act of 1790 ( authored and introduced by Senator and future Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth ) and the Crimes Act of 1825 ( authored by Justice Joseph Story and introduced by Representative Daniel Webster ) . Congress also passed a variety of single @-@ subject criminal statutes , which were not centrally codified in any official publication . 
 Between 1790 and 1797 , only 143 or 147 criminal cases were brought in the circuit courts , and 56 of those cases were brought in the Pennsylvania circuit court concerning the Whiskey Rebellion . And , between 1790 and 1801 , only 426 criminal cases were brought in all federal courts ( the district courts and the circuit courts combined ) . Between 1801 and 1828 , a total of 2 @,@ 718 criminal indictments were returned in the circuit courts : 596 resulted in guilty verdicts by juries ; 479 , not guilty verdicts by juries ; 902 , nolle prosequi ; and 741 , other ( either no disposition recorded , abated , quashed , discharged , discontinued , or prison break ) . 
 Prior to Chief Justice Marshall 's tenure , the Supreme Court had heard only two criminal cases — both by prerogative writ . First , in United States v. Hamilton ( 1795 ) , the Court granted bail to a capital defendant charged with treason — as it was authorized to do by § 33 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and § 4 of the Judiciary Act of 1793 — on an original writ of habeas corpus . The greater portion of the decision was dedicated to the Court 's refusal to order the case tried by a special circuit court , as was provided for by § 3 of the Judiciary Act of 1793 . Second , in United States v. Lawrence ( 1795 ) , the Court declined to issue a writ of mandamus to compel a district judge to order the arrest of a deserter of the French navy , as the French government argued to be required by the consular convention between the United States and France . 
 = = = Writs of error = = = 
 The Judiciary Act of 1789 authorized the Supreme Court to hear writs of error from the circuit courts and writs of error from the highest state courts in cases that involved the validity or construction of federal law . Either a judge of the lower court or a justice of the Supreme Court would have to sign the writ of error ( which was drafted and signed by counsel ) before the Supreme Court could hear the case . Signing the writ of error was not a mere formality , but rather a preliminary assessment of the merits of the arguments in the writ . 
 = = = = Circuit courts = = = = 
 Section 22 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 authorized writs of error from the circuit courts only in civil cases . The District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 — which created the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia and granted it jurisdiction over crimes committed within the federal district — did not explicitly limit writs of error from the D.C. circuit court to civil cases , except insofar as it required an amount in controversy . Although the Court reached the merits of a criminal writ of error from the D.C. circuit court in United States v. Simms ( 1803 ) , without any discussion of the jurisdictional issue , in United States v. More ( 1805 ) , the Court held that it had no such jurisdiction . More held that Congress 's piecemeal statutory grants of appellate jurisdiction to the Court operated as an exercise of Congress 's power under the Exceptions Clause , eliminating all jurisdiction not explicitly granted . 
 More also rejected the argument that criminal writs of error were authorized by § 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 ( the " All Writs Act " ) . That section provided , in relevant part , that " all the before @-@ mentioned courts of the United States shall have power to issue . . . all other writs , not specially provided for by statute , which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions , and agreeable to the principles and usages of law . " Following More , the Court did not hear writs of error from federal criminal trials in the circuit courts for 84 years . In 1889 , Congress created a right of appeal by writ of error in capital cases . The Judiciary Act of 1891 ( the " Evarts Act " ) extended this right to serious crimes . And , the Judicial Code of 1911 — which abolished the circuit courts and placed original jurisdiction for the trial of all federal crime in the district courts — granted general appellate jurisdiction . 
 = = = = State courts = = = = 
 Section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 authorized the Supreme Court to hear writs of error from state courts in cases 
 where is drawn in question the <unk> of a treaty or statute of , or at , authority exercised under the United States , and the decision is against their validity ; or where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of , or an authority exercised under any State , on the ground of their being repugnant to the constitution , treaties or laws of the United States , and the decision is in favour of such their validity , or where is drawn in question the construction of any clause of the constitution , or of a treaty , or statute of , or commission held under the United States , and the decision is against the title , right , privilege or exemption specially set up or claimed by either party , under such clause of the said <unk> treaty , statute or commission . . . . 
 Only twice did the Marshall Court hear criminal cases under § 25 . In Cohens v. Virginia ( 1821 ) , the Court upheld a state lottery law conviction because the federal lottery was authorized only in the District of Columbia . In Worcester v. Georgia ( 1832 ) , the Court reversed Worcester 's conviction for being present in Cherokee country as inconsistent with federal law . 
 Section 25 was not a more significant source of criminal appeals in large part because — as Barron v. Baltimore ( 1833 ) held — the Bill of Rights ( including its criminal procedure provisions ) was viewed as inapplicable to the state governments . This continued until the incorporation of the Bill of Rights after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment . 
 = = = Original habeas = = = 
 Section 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 provided , in relevant part , that 
 all the before @-@ mentioned courts of the United States shall have power to issue writs of . . . habeas corpus . . . . And that either of the justices of the supreme court . . . shall have the power to grant writs of habeas corpus for the purpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment . — Provided , That writs of habeas corpus shall in no case extend to prisoners in gaol , unless where they are in custody , under or by colour of the authority of the United States , or are committed for trial before some court of the same , or are necessary to be brought into court to testify . 
 The Marshall Court heard six original habeas cases of a criminal nature . All of the cases involved detention in the District of Columbia and prior proceedings in the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia . Because the D.C. circuit court did not utilize the practice of riding circuit , certificates of division could not have been granted in these cases . In the first two cases , the Court held that it had jurisdiction to issue the writ in pre @-@ conviction situations . In the next two cases , the Court held that it did not have jurisdiction to issue the writ in post @-@ conviction cases . 
 Ex parte Burford 
 In Ex parte Burford ( 1806 ) , the Court granted the writ of habeas corpus in a case of preventative detention . Eleven justices of the peace of Alexandria County , D.C. had issued a warrant for Burford 's arrest on the grounds that he was " not of good name and fame , nor of honest conversation , but an evil doer and disturber of the peace of the United States , so that murder , homicide , strifes , discords , and other grievances and damages , amongst the citizens of the United States , concerning their bodies and property , are likely to arise thereby . " The D.C. circuit court initially granted Burford the writ of habeas corpus , but remanded him until he posted $ 1 @,@ 000 bail . 
 The Court held that the " warrant of commitment was illegal , for want of stating some good cause certain , supported by oath . " In his dissent in Bollman , Johnson indicated that he also wished to have dissented in Burford : 
 In the case of Burford I was one of the members who constituted the court . I owe it to my own consistency to declare that the court were then <unk> of my objections to the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus . I did not then comment at large on the reasons which influenced my opinion , and the cause was this : The gentleman who argued that cause confined himself strictly to those considerations which ought alone to influence the decisions of this court . No popular observations on the necessity of protecting the citizen from executive oppression , no animated address calculated to enlist the passions or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion , imposed on me the necessity of vindicating my opinion . I submitted in silent deference to the decision of my brethren . 
 Ex parte Bollman 
 In Ex parte Bollman ( 1807 ) , the Court granted the writ to two members of the Burr conspiracy . Dr. Erick Bollman and Samuel Swartwout , having been apprehended in New Orleans , were transported to Charleston and then Baltimore on a navy vessel — notwithstanding the writs of habeas corpus issued by a territorial judge in New Orleans and a district judge in Charlestown . The United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia issued an arrest warrant for Bollman and Swartwout ( who were already in military custody ) , slated the case for trial in D.C. , and denied the prisoners bail ; Judge William Cranch ( also the Supreme Court 's reporter of decisions ) dissented in part on the ground that there was no probable cause for the arrest warrant as required by the Fourth Amendment . The Senate passed , but the House rejected , legislation that would have suspended the writ for three months and legalized Bollman and Swartwout 's arrests . Nearly every member of Congress attended the oral arguments in the Supreme Court . 
 Chief Justice Marshall 's two opinions for the Court in Bollman addressed several issues . On February 13 , Marshall held that the Supreme Court had jurisdiction to issue the writ under Article Three and § 14 . First , he held that the restrictive phrase " necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions " applied only to " all other writs , not specially provided for by statute , " not habeas corpus . Next , he held that the proviso applies both to the power of courts and individual justices to issue the writ , and that the scope of the writ was to be determined by reference to common law . Then , he held that original habeas was not preempted by the decision of a lower court to deny bail . Finally , he reaffirmed the holding of Burford that original habeas was a constitutional exercise of appellate jurisdiction . 
 Justice Johnson dissented . Johnson stated that his dissent was " supported by the opinion of one of my brethren , who is prevented by indisposition from attending . " Scholars are divided on whether Johnson referred to Justice Chase or Justice Cushing . 
 Prof. Freedman has argued that Bollman erred in applying § 14 's proviso to both courts and individual judges ( as opposed to only individual judges ) and thus that the Judiciary Act of 1789 did confer federal courts the power to grant writs of habeas corpus to state prisoners . The Reconstruction @-@ era Congress granted federal courts this power in 1867 . 
 Ex parte Kearney 
 In Ex parte Kearney ( 1822 ) , the Court denied the writ to a prisoner who was imprisoned for criminal contempt . In an opinion by Justice Story , the Court 's reasoning reached far further : 
 [ T ] his Court has no appellate jurisdiction confided to it in criminal cases , by the laws of the United States . It cannot entertain a writ of error , to revise the judgment of the Circuit Court , in any case where a party has been convicted of a public offence . And undoubtedly the denial of this authority proceeded upon great principles of public policy and convenience . If every party had a right to bring before this Court every case , in which judgment had passed against him , for a crime or misdemeanor or felony , the course of justice might be materially delayed and obstructed , and , in some cases , totally frustrated . If , then , this Court cannot directly revise a judgment of the Circuit Court in a criminal case , what reason is there to suppose , that it was intended to vest it with the authority to do it indirectly ? 
 Story explained : 
 The only objection is , not that the Court acted beyond its jurisdiction , but that it erred in its judgment of the law applicable to the case . If , then , we are to give any relief in this case , it is by a revision of the opinion of the Court , given in the course of a criminal trial , and thus asserting a right to control its proceedings , and take from them the conclusive effect which the law intended to give them . If this were an application for a habeas corpus , after judgment on an indictment for an offence within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court , it could hardly be maintained , that this court could revise such a judgment , or the proceedings which led to it , or set it aside , and discharge the prisoner . 
 Ex parte Watkins 
 In Ex parte Watkins ( 1830 ) , the Court held that the writ did not lie after a federal criminal conviction even if the indictment failed to state an offense . Three years later , with the same petitioner , in Ex parte Watkins ( 1833 ) , the Court did issue the writ because the petitioner was detained beyond his authorized sentence for non @-@ payment of a fine ; although the Court held that such detention would be permissible under the writ of capias pro fine ( generally , a writ ordering the imprisonment of a defendant until a criminal fine is paid ) , it held that it was not under the writ of capias ad <unk> ( a civil law analog ) . After further proceedings in the D.C. circuit court , Watkins was discharged . 
 Ex parte Milburn 
 In Ex parte Milburn ( 1835 ) , the Court denied an original habeas petition concerning pretrial detention holding that the forfeiture of bail for failure to appear did not satisfy a criminal indictment and that a prior granting of the writ of habeas corpus was no bar to a subsequent arrest warrant . 
 = = = Certificates of division = = = 
 Under the Judiciary Act of 1789 , the United States circuit courts were composed of a stationary United States district court judge and any two Supreme Court justices riding circuit . If one judge or justice disagreed with the other two , the majority prevailed . If only one Supreme Court justice could attend ( as was authorized by the Judiciary Act of 1793 ) , and a division arose between the district judge and the Supreme Court justice , the practice was to hold the case over until the next term . If a one @-@ to @-@ one division persisted with a different circuit riding justice , the opinion of the previous circuit rider broke the tie . Following a brief intermezzo with the soon @-@ repealed Midnight Judges Act of 1801 ( which briefly abolished circuit riding ) , under the Judiciary Act of 1802 , the circuit courts were composed of a stationary district judge and one Supreme Court justice assigned to the circuit . But , a single judge ( either the district judge or the circuit rider ) could preside alone . In cases where both judges sat , though , one @-@ to @-@ one divisions were less likely to be resolved by continuing the case until the next term because the circuit riding justice would be the same ( barring a change in membership on the Court ) . 
 Accordingly , § 6 of the Judiciary Act of 1802 provided that the circuit courts could certify questions of law to the Supreme Court if the judges were divided on that question . Several scholars have argued that certificates of division were pro forma , and that the judge and justice would merely agree to disagree , often without writing opposing opinions . For example , with the circuit court decision leading up to United States v. Marchant ( 1827 ) , the reporter records that " [ t ] he district judge concurred in this opinion ; but as it was a matter of not infrequent occurrence , and important to the practice of the court , the judges afterwards divided in opinion for the purpose of obtaining a solemn decision of the superior court . " Similarly , the United States v. Ortega ( 1826 ) circuit court opinion notes that the " point was taken to the supreme court upon a <unk> certificate of a division of opinion in this court . " 
 Chief Justice Marshall and Justice Story in particular were known for making use of certificates of division while riding circuit . For example , Justice Marshall was one of the divided judges in United States v. <unk> ( 1820 ) , United States v. Smith ( 1820 ) , United States v. <unk> ( 1826 ) , United States v. Turner ( 1833 ) , and United States v. Mills ( 1833 ) ; and Justice Story played the role in United States v. Coolidge ( 1816 ) , United States v. Bevans ( 1818 ) , United States v. Palmer ( 1818 ) , United States v. Holmes ( 1820 ) , and Marchant . But , Justice Story — in his opinions for the Court — cautioned against the too frequent use of certificates of division in criminal cases . In United States v. Gooding ( 1827 ) , for the Court , Justice Story wrote : 
 We take this opportunity of expressing our anxiety , least , by too great indulgence to the wishes of counsel , questions of this sort should be frequently brought before this Court , and thus , in effect , an appeal in criminal cases become an ordinary proceeding to the manifest obstruction of public justice , and against the plain <unk> of the acts of Congress . 
 The Judiciary Act of 1802 plainly did contemplate that certificates of division would issue in criminal cases . Section 6 provided that " imprisonment shall not be allowed , nor punishment in any case be inflicted , where judges of the said court are divided in opinion upon the question touching the said imprisonment or punishment . " And , while the statute provided only for the certification of " the point upon which the disagreement shall happen , " the justices sometimes took the liberty of enlarging the question . For example , in United States v. Hudson ( 1812 ) , the question certified was " whether the Circuit Court of the United States had a common law jurisdiction in cases of libel ? " but the question answered was " whether the Circuit Courts of the United States can exercise a common law jurisdiction in criminal cases ? " And , in United States v. Bevans ( 1818 ) , the Court noted that " [ i ] t may be deemed within the scope of the question certified to this court " to inquire whether the murder was cognizable under § 3 of the Crimes Act of 1790 , even though the defendant had only been indicted under § 8 . 
 But not every question or every case was eligible for a certificate of division . In United States v. Daniel ( 1821 ) , the Court held that a motion for a new trial — as authorized by the § 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 — could not be the subject of a certificate of division ; rather , the division would operate a rejection of the motion . Similarly , in United States v. Bailey ( 1835 ) , the Court held that the question of whether the evidence was legally sufficient to support the offense charged could not be certified . And , certificates of division began to fall into disuse as it became increasingly common for the circuit courts to sit with a single judge . As Chief Justice Marshall wrote , he did not have " the privilege of dividing the court when alone . " 
 = = Defining federal crimes = = 
 = = = Assimilative crimes = = = 
 Section 3 of the Crimes Act of 1825 enacted the first federal assimilative crimes statute , criminalizing conduct in violation of state law within areas under federal jurisdiction . Section 3 provided that : 
 [ I ] f any offence shall be committed in any [ fort , dock @-@ yard , navy @-@ yard , arsenal , armory , magazine , lighthouse , or other needful building under the jurisdiction of the United States ] , the punishment of which offence is not specifically provided for by any law of the United States , such offense shall , upon conviction in any court of the United States having <unk> thereof , be liable to , and receive the same punishment as the laws of the state in which such [ place aforesaid ] , is situated , provide for the like offence when committed within the body of any county of such state . 
 In United States v. Paul ( 1832 ) — involving a criminal burglary at West Point , prosecuted via an 1829 New York statute defining burglary in the third degree — the Court held that the assimilative crimes provision was limited to state crimes in force at the time of the federal statute 's enactment . The 1866 , 1874 , 1898 , 1909 , 1933 , 1935 , and 1940 re @-@ enactments of the assimilative crimes offense explicitly incorporated this interpretation of Paul . 
 But , in 1948 , Congress amended the Assimilative Crimes Act , 18 U.S.C. § 13 , to incorporate changes in state criminal law , as they occur , up until the commission of the charged conduct . The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the revision in United States v. <unk> ( 1958 ) . <unk> held that : " There is nothing in [ Paul ] to show that the issue was decided as anything more than one of statutory construction falling within the doctrine calling for the narrow construction of a penal statute . So interpreted , the decision did not reach the issue that is before us . " 
 = = = Common law crimes = = = 
 In United States v. Hudson ( 1812 ) , without oral argument from either the defendants or Attorney General William Pinkney , the Court held that an indictment for a common law crime must be dismissed because all federal crimes ( with the exception of contempt of court ) must be established by statute . Justice Johnson , for the Court , wrote : 
 Although this question is brought up now for the first time to be decided by this Court , we consider it as having been long since settled in public opinion . In no other case for many years has this jurisdiction been asserted , and the general acquiescence of legal men shows the prevalence of opinion in favor of the negative of the proposition . 
 While riding circuit in Massachusetts , Justice Story — in addition to distinguishing Hudson under admiralty jurisdiction — argued for the overruling of Hudson : 
 [ Hudson ] having been made without argument , and by a majority only of the court , I hope that it is not an improper course to bring the subject again in review for a more solemn decision , as it is not a question of mere ordinary import , but vitally affects the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States ; a jurisdiction which they cannot lawfully enlarge or diminish . I shall submit , with the utmost cheerfulness , to the judgment of my brethren , and if I have <unk> a rash opinion , I have the consolation to know , that their superior learning and ability will save the public from an injury by my error . 
 On the certificate of division , in United States v. Coolidge ( 1816 ) , three justices — Washington and Livingston in addition to Story — indicated their willingness to depart from Hudson , but since no counsel appeared for Coolidge , and since Attorney General Richard Rush refused to argue the point , Hudson was reaffirmed . 
 According to Prof. Rowe , " [ f ] ew major controversies have ended with as slight a whimper as the battle over federal common law crimes that raged in the first two decades of the American republic . " Rowe argues that " without acknowledging it , the Hudson Court disapproved at least eight circuit court cases , brushed off the views of all but one Justice who sat on the Court prior to 1804 , and departed from what was arguably the original understanding of those who framed the Constitution and penned the Judiciary Act of 1789 . " Rowe views Hudson as a codification of an issue decided by public opinion , including during the 1800 presidential election : " Hudson set onto tablets the principles that guided the Jeffersonians during their wanderings in the desert . " 
 = = = Counterfeiting = = = 
 First Bank 
 When it created the First Bank of the United States , Congress criminalized counterfeiting the bills of the bank . " Read literally , " the statute required both that the bill be counterfeit and that the bill be signed by the President of the Bank of the United States . In United States v. Cantril ( 1807 ) , without oral argument , the Court arrested a judgment of conviction under the counterfeiting statute , finding the statute invalid " for the reasons assigned in the record " ( without further elaboration ) . By the time Cantril was decided , Congress had already passed a new statute to correct the apparent drafting error . 
 According to Prof. Whittington , Cantril was the first challenge to a federal statute under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to be considered by the Court . In later cases , the Court has noted the several possible holdings that could have been intended in Cantril . 
 Second Bank 
 Congress passed a new counterfeiting statute in 1816 when it created the Second Bank of the United States . In United States v. Turner ( 1833 ) , interpreting the new act , the Court held that the offense of counterfeiting was committed even if the signatures forged were those of the wrong bank officers . But , in United States v. Brewster ( 1833 ) , the Court held that the crime applied only to counterfeit bills , not counterfeit notes .

 War of 1812 
 In June 1812 , during the War of 1812 , Congress passed a statute prohibiting the transportation " over land or otherwise , in any wagon , cart , sleigh , boat , or otherwise , naval or military stores , arms or the munitions of war , or any article of provision , from any place of the <unk> States , to " Canada . In United States v. Barber ( 1815 ) , the Court held " fat cattle " to be " provisions , or munitions of war , within the true intent and meaning of the act . " In United States v. Sheldon ( 1817 ) , decided after the war had ended , Barber was distinguished on the grounds that driving cattle on foot was not " transportation " within the meaning of the act . 
 Neutrality Act of 1818 
 The Neutrality Act of 1818 provided the arming of a vessel with the intention that it be employed against a people at peace with the United States . In United States v. Quincy ( 1832 ) , the Court decided several questions concerning the interpretation of the Neutrality Act . First , the Court held that the elements of the offense did not require that the vessel be fitted out within the United States , but rather than an intention to fit the vessel out in an intermediary port was sufficient . Second , the Court held that a conditional intention ( for example , an intention to so arm the vessel only if sufficient funds could be obtained ) was insufficient to satisfy the elements of the offense . Third , the Court held that , if the defendant had a fixed intention to so arm the vessel upon leaving the United States , the frustration of that intention at the intermediate port was irrelevant . Fourth , the Court refused to distinguish between the statutory term of " people " and the concept of a " state . "

 = = = Maritime insurance fraud = = = 
 An 1804 criminal insurance fraud statute provided : 
 [ I ] f any person shall , on the high seas , wilfully and corruptly cast away , burn , or otherwise destroy , any ship or vessel of which he is owner in part or in whole , or in <unk> direct or procure the same to be done , with intent or design to prejudice any person or persons that hath underwritten , or shall underwrite , any policy or policies of insurance thereon or of any merchant or merchants that shall load goods thereon , or of any other owner or owners of such ship or vessel , the person or persons offending therein , being thereof lawfully convicted , shall be deemed and adjudged guilty of felony , and shall suffer death . 
 In United States v. <unk> ( 1826 ) , the Court held that the federal criminal insurance fraud statute was no subjected to the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims . First , the Court held that the state statute of incorporation of the insurance company required no more than the state 's seal to be authenticated . Second , there was no need to prove the existence of the insurance company ( i.e. , that its stock had actually been subscribed ) because it was not a party . Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company . Nor did it matter whether the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the fraud . Finally , it was held that an insurance corporation was a person within the meaning of the statute . 
 = = = Piracy and the high seas = = = 
 The piracy cases considered by the Marshall Court arose under two Congressional statutes : the Crimes Act of 1790 and the Act of March 3 , 1819 . Article One provides that Congress shall have the power " [ t ] o define and punish <unk> and Felonies committed on the high Seas . " Five sections in the Crimes Act " were devoted to the subject , " but " [ t ] he principal provisions with respect to piracy were incorporated in section 8 . " According to Prof. White , " from 1815 to 1823 , piracy cases were among the most numerous and controversial of those decided by the Court . " 
 Crimes Act of 1790 , § 8 
 Section 8 of the Crimes Act of 1790 provided : 
 [ I ] f any person or persons shall commit upon the high seas , or in any river , haven , basin or bay , out of the jurisdiction of any particular state , murder or robbery , or any other offence which if committed within the body of a county , would by <unk> of the United States be punishable with death ; or if any captain or mariner of any ship or other vessel , shall <unk> and feloniously run away with such ship or vessel , or any goods or merchandise to the value of fifty dollars , or yield up such ship or vessel voluntarily to any pirate ; or if any seaman shall lay violent hands upon his commander , thereby to hinder and prevent his fighting in defence of his ship or goods committed to his trust , or shall make a revolt in the ship ; every such offender shall be deemed , taken and adjudged to be a pirate and felon , and being thereof convicted , shall suffer death ; and the trial of crimes committed on the high seas , or in any place out of the jurisdiction of any particular state , shall be in the district where the offender is apprehended , or into which he may first be brought . 
 The first two decisions to interpret § 8 construed it not to apply to the crimes charged . In United States v. Bevans ( 1818 ) , the Court held that the § 8 of the Act did not extend to a murder committed on a navy vessel within state waters . In United States v. Palmer ( 1818 ) , the Court held that the § 8 of the Act did not extend to piracy by U.S. citizen defendants , in the employ of a South American government at war with Spain , committed against Spanish ships and citizens . President John Quincy Adams was a harsh critic of the decision in Palmer . He wrote in his diary that the Court had " cast away the jurisdiction which a law of congress had given , that its " reasoning [ was ] a sample of judicial logic — disingenuous , false , and hollow , " and that it gave him " an early disgust for the practice of law , and led me to the unalterable determination never to accept judicial office . " 
 Following the Act of 1819 , in 1820 the Court began to distinguish Palmer . In United States v. <unk> ( 1820 ) , the Court distinguished Palmer — in a case involving piracy by a U.S. citizen , claiming to act under the authority of the Mexican Republic , committed against a Danish ship and citizens , under the fraudulent claim that the Danes were Spanish ( Spain being at war with the Mexican Republic ) — on the grounds that the victims in Palmer were not subjects of a nation recognized by the United States . In United States v. Furlong ( 1820 ) , sometimes referred to as United States v. Pirates , authored by Justice Johnson ( a dissenter in Palmer ) , the Court distinguished Palmer again , primarily on the ground that the pirate vessel had no nationality ( it was an American ship prior to being hijacked ) . United States v. Holmes ( 1820 ) distinguished Palmer on the same ground , further holding that the burden was on the defendant to prove that his vessel flew a lawful flag . 
 Crimes Act of 1790 , § 12 
 Section 12 of the Act provided : 
 [ I ] f any seaman or other person shall commit manslaughter upon the high seas , or confederate , or attempt or endeavour to corrupt any commander , master , officer or mariner , to yield up or to run away with any ship or vessel , or with any goods , wares , or merchandise , or to turn pirate , or to go over to or confederate with pirates , or in any wise trade with any pirate knowing him to be such , or shall furnish such pirate with any ammunition , stores or provisions of any kind , or shall fit out any vessel knowingly and with a design to trade with or <unk> or correspond with any pirate or robber upon the seas ; or if any person or persons shall any ways consult , combine , confederate or correspond with any pirate or robber on the seas , knowing him to be guilty of any such piracy or robbery ; or if any seaman shall confine the master of any ship or other vessel , or endeavour to make a revolt in such ship . . . such person or persons so offending , and being thereof convicted , shall be imprisoned not exceeding three years , and fined not exceeding one thousand dollars . 
 In United States v. <unk> ( 1820 ) , the Court held that § 12 of the Act did not extend to a manslaughter committed " in a river such as the river Tigris " because such was not on the " high seas . " ( Justice Washington had delivered an unrelated jury charge below . ) In United States v. Kelly ( 1826 ) , the Court interpreted the phrase " endeavour to make a revolt " to refer to " the endeavour of the crew of a vessel , or any one or more of them , to overthrow the legitimate authority of her commander , with intent to remove him from his command , or against his will to take possession of the vessel by assuming the government and navigation of her , or by transferring their obedience from the lawful commander to some other person . " Justice Washington , the author of the opinion of the Court , had written a slightly longer opinion below . 
 Act of March 3 , 1819 , § 5 
 In 1819 , Congress enacted a new anti @-@ piracy statute : Act to Protect the Commerce of the United States and Punish the Crime of Piracy . Section 5 of that Act provided : 
 [ I ] f any person or persons whatsoever , shall , on the high seas , commit the crime of piracy , as defined by the law of nations , and such offender or offenders shall afterwards be brought into , or found in , the United States , every such offender or offenders shall , upon conviction thereof , before the Circuit Court of the United States for the District into which he or they may be brought , or in which he or they shall be found , be punished with death . 
 In United States v. Smith ( 1820 ) , in an opinion by Justice Story , the Court upheld a conviction under the 1819 statute , holding that Congress could leave the definition of piracy to the law of nations . After reviewing the history of foreign ( primarily English ) law , Justice Story declared : " We have , therefore , no hesitation in declaring , that piracy , by the law of nations , is robbery upon the sea , and that it is sufficiently and constitutionally defined by the fifth section of the act of 1819 . " In a rare dissent , Justice Livingston argued that Article One , Section Eight , Clause Ten obliged Congress to define piracy with more specificity . The facts in Smith were almost identical to those which Palmer had held could not be reached under the Crimes Act of 1790 : a U.S. citizen pirate , commissioned by a government in Buenos Aires , had led a mutiny , seized a new ship , and then robbed a Spanish ship . 
 Section 5 of the 1819 act was set to sunset at the end of the next session of Congress . Before that time , Congress made the provision permanent in an 1820 omnibus piracy bill that also defined additional offenses . Section 8 of the Crimes Act of 1790 , § 5 of the 1819 act , and § 3 of the 1820 act were all separately codified in the Revised Statutes in 1874 . Section 8 of the Crimes Act of 1790 was repealed by the Criminal Code of 1909 . 
 = = = Slave trading = = = 
 The Slave Trade Act of 1818 prohibited the importation of slaves into the United States . The " fitting out " offense provided that : 
 [ N ] o citizen or citizens of the United States , or any other person or persons , shall , after the passing of this act , as aforesaid , for himself , themselves , or any other person or persons whatsoever , either as master , factor , or owner , build , fit , equip , load , or otherwise prepare , any ship or vessel , in any port or place within the jurisdiction of the United States , nor cause any such ship or vessel to sail from any port or place <unk> , within the jurisdiction of the same , for the purpose of procuring any negro , mulatto , or person of colour , from any foreign kingdom , place , or country , to be transported to any port or place whatsoever , to be held , sold , or otherwise disposed of , as slaves , or to be held to service or labour ; and if any ship or vessel shall be so built , fitted out , equipped , laden , or otherwise prepared , for the purpose aforesaid , every such ship or vessel , her tackle , apparel , furniture , and lading , shall be forfeited , one moiety to the use of the United Slates , and the other to the use of the person , or persons who shall sue for said forfeiture , and prosecute the same to effect ; and such ship or vessel shall be liable to be seized , prosecuted , and condemned , in any court of the United States having competent jurisdiction . 
 and that : 
 [ E ] very person or persons so building , fitting out , equipping , loading , or otherwise preparing , or sending away , or causing any of the acts aforesaid to be done , with intent to employ such ship or vessel in such trade or business , after the passing of this act , contrary to the true intent and meaning thereof or who shall , in any wise , be aiding or abetting therein , shall , <unk> , on conviction thereof , by due course of law , forfeit and pay a sum not exceeding five thousand dollars , nor less than one thousand dollars , one moiety to the use of the United States , and the other to the use of the person or persons who shall sue for such forfeiture and prosecute the same to effect , and shall moreover be imprisoned for a term not exceeding seven years , nor less than three years . 
 In United States v. Gooding ( 1827 ) , the Court construed the elements of the fitting out offense . First , the Court held that the offense of fitting out a vessel for slave trading could be committed even if the owner of the vessel did not personally fit it out . Second , the Court held that the statute could be violated by a partial fitting out ( as opposed to a complete fitting out ) of a vessel for that purpose . Third , the Court held that — since slave trading was a misdemeanor — there was no distinction between principal and accessory . Fourth , the Court held that , for the statute to be violated , the fitting out must have occurred within the United States . Finally , the Court held that the statute 's mens rea required that the owner intend to cause the vessel to be used for slave trading , as opposed to intending that the vessel be used for slave trading ( by some third party ) . 
 = = = Treason = = = 
 Article Three , Section Three , Clause One of the Constitution provides that : 
 Treason against the United States , shall consist only in levying War against them , or in adhering to their Enemies , giving them Aid and Comfort . No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act , or on Confession in open Court . 
 Section 1 of the Crimes Act of 1790 provided that 
 if any person or persons , owing allegiance to the United States of America , shall levy war against them , or shall adhere to their enemies , giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere , and shall be thereof convicted , on confession in open court , or on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act of treason whereof he or they shall stand indicted , such person or persons shall be adjudged guilty of treason against the United States , and shall suffer death . 
 In Ex parte Bollman ( 1807 ) , the Court held that conspiracy to wage war on the United States was not treason . Further , Bollman held that the evidence against both Bollman and Swartwout was insufficient to justify pre @-@ trial detention . 
 = = Criminal procedure = = 
 = = = Constitutional issues = = = 
 Venue 
 While Ex parte Bollman ( 1807 ) is more famous for its holding that the Burr conspirators had not committed treason , the Court could not have ordered the release of the prisoners without also addressing the Neutrality Act of 1794 , under which the conspirators were also charged . With regard to these charges , the Court conceded , " those who admit the affidavit of General Wilkinson cannot doubt . " 
 But , Bollman held that venue for the Neutrality Act charges was improper in the District of Columbia . First , the Court rejected locus delicti venue ( without reaching the question of whether such could exist outside of a U.S. state ) . " [ T ] hat no part of this crime was committed in the district of Columbia is apparent . It is therefore the unanimous opinion of the court that they cannot be tried in this district . " Second , the Court rejected statutory venue under section 8 the Crimes Act of 1790 ( as permitted by Article Three for crimes not committed within a state ) . The Court held that the Territory of Orleans was not a place that triggered the alternative venue provisions of the Crimes Act . The Court held that the statutory term " any place out of the jurisdiction of any particular state " applied only to " any river , haven , <unk> or bay , not within the jurisdiction of any particular state , " and only in " those cases there is no court which has particular cognizance of the crime . " 
 Double jeopardy 
 In three opinions , the Marshall Court considered questions of double jeopardy , without ever clearly referring to the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment . First , in United States v. Perez ( 1824 ) , the Court held that there was no bar to a second prosecution after a mistrial was declared for " manifest necessity . " ( Justice Story authored the opinion of the Court , espousing the position taken by Justice Thompson below . ) Next , in United States v. Wilson ( 1833 ) , the Court held that the protection of prior jeopardy extended to lesser included offenses ; " [ a ] fter the judgment [ of conviction ] , no subsequent prosecution could be maintained for the same offence , nor for any part of it . " But , Wilson held that , in order to receive the protection of a pardon , a defendant must accept the pardon and affirmatively plead its existence in court . And , finally , in United States v. <unk> ( 1834 ) — where the defendant had first been acquitted of counterfeiting one note , and then convicted of counterfeiting a different note ( which had been introduced as evidence at the first trial ) — the Court held that double jeopardy did not run from the use of the same evidence for " entirely a distinct offence . " 
 Original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court 
 In United States v. Ortega ( 1826 ) , the Court held that it was not unconstitutional to vest original jurisdiction for the criminal trial of assaults on ambassadors in the circuit courts . The Court did not reach the question of whether the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court could be made concurrent with a lower court , instead holding that the criminal trial of an assault on an ambassador was not a " Case [ ] affecting Ambassadors , other public Ministers and Consuls " within the meaning of Article Three . Justice Washington , the author of the Court 's opinion , had also delivered the jury charge below . 
 Two Supreme Court justices had previously disagreed on this question while riding circuit . In United States v. <unk> ( C.C.D. Pa . 1793 ) , an indictment for sending anonymous and threatening letters to a foreign minister with a view to extort money , Justice James Wilson argued that the circuit court could be given concurrent jurisdiction ; Justice James Iredell argued that it could not ; Judge Richard Peters , of the District of Pennsylvania , sided with Wilson , and the case continued . 
 = = = Evidence = = = 
 Burden of proof 
 In United States v. Gooding ( 1827 ) , the Court held that the government must bear the burden of proof in criminal cases " unless a different provision is made by some statute . " 
 Hearsay 
 Also in Gooding , the Court approved of a hearsay exception for the statement of an agent of the defendant , holding that the doctrine should be the same in civil and criminal cases . 
 Best evidence 
 In United States v. Reyburn ( 1832 ) , the Court again held that civil rules of evidence should be applied in criminal cases , recognizing an exception to the best evidence rule where " non production of the written instrument is satisfactorily accounted for . " 
 = = = Other = = = 
 Facts found by a jury 
 In United States v. Tyler ( 1812 ) , without oral argument , the Court held that an error in a verdict sheet — referring to the goods in violation of the embargo as " pot @-@ ashes " rather than " pearl @-@ ashes " — was harmless because the jury need not find the value to be forfeited . 
 Sufficiency of an indictment 
 In United States v. Gooding ( 1827 ) , the Court held that , in general , it is sufficient for a criminal indictment to merely repeat the text of the statute . Further , the Court held that — " under circumstances of an extraordinary nature , " " on very urgent occasions " — a challenge to the sufficiency of an indictment could be made post @-@ conviction . In United States v. Mills ( 1833 ) , the Court again embraced the general rule that a sufficient indictment need only follow the terms of the statute . 
 Separate trials of co @-@ defendants 
 In United States v. Marchant ( 1827 ) , the Court held that — even though a trial court has the discretion to sever the trials of co @-@ defendants — a defendant has no right to insist upon being tried alone . The Court recounted the history of criminal severance in English law , and concluded that the practice merely arose to prevent co @-@ defendants from each using their peremptory challenges to deplete the venire such that too few jurors remained for trial . Justice Story was the author of the opinion of the Court , as well as a substantially similar opinion in the Massachusetts circuit court below . 
 Nol pros 
 In United States v. Phillips ( 1832 ) , the Court dismissed a criminal action , on the motion of the Attorney General , pursuant to the district prosecutor 's filing of a nolle prosequi motion ( a motion by the prosecutor to dismiss the case ) in the trial court , even though the nolle prosequi motion was filed after the writ of error issued from the Supreme Court . Phillips has been cited as an early example of judicial recognition of the norm of prosecutorial enforcement discretion and as an example of mootness ( although the Phillips Court did not use that term ) . The underlying case had involved the prosecution of <unk> Phillips , a prominent Philadelphia attorney , for interfering with diplomatic immunity , as protected by the Crimes Act of 1790 , by filing a lawsuit against a former diplomat .

 Mary Toft ( née Denyer ; c . 1701 – 1763 ) , also spelled Tofts , was an English woman from Godalming , Surrey , who in 1726 became the subject of considerable controversy when she tricked doctors into believing that she had given birth to rabbits . 
 In 1726 Toft became pregnant , but following her reported fascination with the sighting of a rabbit , she miscarried . Her claim to have given birth to various animal parts prompted the arrival of John Howard , a local surgeon , who investigated the matter . He delivered several pieces of animal flesh and duly notified other prominent physicians , which brought the case to the attention of Nathaniel St. André , surgeon to the Royal Household of King George I. St. André concluded that Toft 's case was genuine but the king also sent surgeon Cyriacus Ahlers , who remained sceptical . By then quite famous , Toft was brought to London and studied at length , where under intense scrutiny and producing no more rabbits she confessed to the hoax , and was subsequently imprisoned as a fraud . 
 The resultant public mockery created panic within the medical profession and ruined the careers of several prominent surgeons . The affair was satirised on many occasions , not least by the pictorial satirist and social critic William Hogarth , who was notably critical of the medical profession 's gullibility . Toft was eventually released without charge and returned home . 
 = = Account = = 
 The story first came to the public 's attention in late October 1726 , when reports began to reach London . An account appeared in the Mist 's Weekly Journal , on 19 November 1726 : 
 From Guildford comes a strange but well @-@ attested Piece of News . That a poor Woman who lives at <unk> [ sic ] , near that Town , was about a Month past delivered by Mr John Howard , an Eminent Surgeon and Man @-@ Midwife , of a creature resembling a Rabbit but whose Heart and Lungs grew without [ outside ] its Belly , about 14 Days since she was delivered by the same Person , of a perfect Rabbit : and in a few Days after of 4 more ; and on Friday , Saturday , Sunday , the 4th , 5th , and 6th instant , of one in each day : in all nine , they died all in bringing into the World . The woman hath made Oath , that two Months ago , being working in a Field with other Women , they put up a Rabbit , who running from them , they pursued it , but to no Purpose : This created in her such a Longing to it , that she ( being with Child ) was taken ill and miscarried , and from that Time she hath not been able to avoid thinking of Rabbits . People after all , differ much in their Opinion about this Matter , some looking upon them as great Curiosities , fit to be presented to the Royal Society , etc. others are angry at the Account , and say , that if it be a Fact , a Veil should be drawn over it , as an <unk> in human Nature . 
 The ' poor Woman ' , Mary Toft , was twenty @-@ four or twenty @-@ five years old . She was baptised Mary Denyer on 21 February 1703 , the daughter of John and Jane Denyer . In 1720 she married Joshua Toft , a journeyman clothier and together the couple had three children , Mary , Anne and James . As an 18th @-@ century English peasant , circumstances dictated that when in 1726 Toft again became pregnant , she continue working in the fields . She complained of painful complications early in the pregnancy and in early August <unk> several pieces of flesh , one " as big as my arm " . This may have been the result of an abnormality of the developing placenta , which would have caused the embryo to stop developing and blood clots and flesh to be ejected . Toft went into labour on 27 September . Her neighbour was called and watched as she produced several animal parts . This neighbour then showed the pieces to her mother and to her mother @-@ in @-@ law , Ann Toft , who by chance was a midwife . Ann Toft sent the flesh to John Howard , a Guildford @-@ based man @-@ midwife of thirty years experience . 
 Initially , Howard dismissed the notion that Toft had given birth to animal parts , but the next day , despite his reservations , he went to see her . Ann Toft showed him more pieces of the previous night 's exertions , but on examining Mary , he found nothing . When Mary again went into labour , appearing to give birth to several more animal parts , Howard returned to continue his investigations . According to a contemporary account of 9 November , over the next few days he delivered " three legs of a Cat of a Tabby Colour , and one leg of a Rabbet : the guts were as a Cat 's and in them were three pieces of the Back @-@ Bone of an Eel ... The cat 's feet supposed were formed in her imagination from a cat she was fond of that slept on the bed at night . " Toft seemingly became ill once more and over the next few days delivered more pieces of rabbit . 
 As the story became more widely known , on 4 November Henry Davenant , a member of the court of King George I , went to see for himself what was happening . He examined the samples Howard had collected and returned to London , ostensibly a believer . Howard had Toft moved to Guildford , where he offered to deliver rabbits in the presence of anyone who doubted her story . Some of the letters he wrote to Davenant to notify him of any progress in the case came to the attention of Nathaniel St. André , since 1723 a Swiss surgeon to the Royal Household . St. André would ultimately detail the contents of one of these letters in his pamphlet , A short narrative of an extraordinary delivery of <unk> ( 1727 ) : 
 SIR , 
 Since I wrote to you , I have taken or deliver 'd the poor Woman of three more Rabbets , all three half grown , one of them a <unk> Rabbet ; the last leap 'd twenty three Hours in the Uterus before it dy 'd . As soon as the eleventh Rabbet was taken away , up leap 'd the twelfth Rabbet , which is now leaping . If you have any curious Person that is pleased to come Post , may see another leap in her Uterus , and shall take it from her if he pleases ; which will be a great Satisfaction to the Curious : If she had been with Child , she has but ten Days more to go , so I do not know how many Rabbets may be behind ; I have brought the Woman to Guildford for better Convenience . 
 I am , SIR , Your humble Servant , 
 JOHN <unk> . 
 = = Investigation = = 
 By the middle of November the British Royal Family were so interested in the story that they sent St. André and Samuel Molyneux , secretary to the Prince of Wales , to investigate . Apparently , they were not disappointed ; arriving on 15 November they were taken by Howard to see Toft , who within hours delivered a rabbit 's torso . St. André 's account details his examination of the rabbit . To check if it had breathed air , he placed a piece of its lung in water to see if it would float — which it did . St. André then performed a medical examination on Toft , and concluded that the rabbits were bred in her Fallopian tubes . In the doctors ' absence , Toft later that day reportedly delivered the torso of another rabbit , which the two also examined . They again returned that evening to find Toft again displaying violent contractions . A further medical examination followed , and St. André delivered some rabbit skin , followed a few minutes later by a rabbit 's head . Both men inspected the <unk> pieces of flesh , noting that some resembled the body parts of a cat . 
 Fascinated , the king then sent surgeon Cyriacus Ahlers to Guildford . Ahlers arrived on 20 November and found Toft exhibiting no signs of pregnancy . He may have already suspected the affair was a hoax and observed that Toft seemed to press her knees and thighs together , as if to prevent something from " dropping down " . He thought Howard 's behaviour just as suspicious , as the man @-@ midwife would not let him help deliver the rabbits — although Ahlers was not a man @-@ midwife and in an earlier attempt had apparently put Toft through considerable pain . Convinced the affair was a hoax , he lied , telling those involved that he believed Toft 's story , before making his excuses and returning to London , taking specimens of the rabbits with him . Upon closer study , he reportedly found evidence of them having been cut with a man @-@ made instrument , and noted pieces of straw and grain in their droppings . 
 On 21 November Ahlers reported his findings to the king and later to " several Persons of Note and Distinction " . Howard wrote to Ahlers the next day , asking for the return of his specimens . Ahlers ' suspicions began to worry both Howard and St. André , and apparently the king , as two days later St. André and a colleague were ordered back to Guildford . Upon their arrival they met Howard , who told St. André that Toft had given birth to two more rabbits . She delivered several portions of what was presumed to be a placenta but she was by then quite ill , and suffering from a constant pain in the right side of her abdomen . In a pre @-@ emptive move against Ahlers , St. André collected affidavits from several witnesses , which in effect cast doubt on Ahlers ' honesty , and on 26 November gave an anatomical demonstration before the king to support Toft 's story . According to his pamphlet , neither St. André nor Molyneux suspected any fraudulent activity . 
 St. André was ordered by the king to travel back to Guildford and to bring Toft to London , so that further investigations could be carried out . He was accompanied by Richard Manningham , a well @-@ known obstetrician who was knighted in 1721 , and the second son of Thomas Manningham , Bishop of Chichester . He examined Toft and found the right side of her abdomen slightly enlarged . Manningham also delivered what he thought was a hog 's bladder — although St. André and Howard disagreed with his identification — but became suspicious as it smelled of urine . Nevertheless , those involved agreed to say nothing in public and on their return to London on 29 November lodged Toft in Lacey 's Bagnio , in Leicester Fields .

 Printed in the early days of newspapers , the story became a national sensation , although some publications were sceptical , the Norwich Gazette viewing the affair simply as female gossip . Rabbit stew and <unk> hare disappeared from the dinner table , while as unlikely as the story sounded , many physicians felt compelled to see Toft for themselves . The political writer John Hervey later told his friend Henry Fox that : 
 Every creature in town , both men and women , have been to see and feel her : the perpetual emotions , noises and rumblings in her Belly are something prodigious ; all the eminent physicians , surgeons and man @-@ midwives in London are there Day and Night to watch her next production . 
 Under St. André 's strict control Toft was studied by a number of eminent physicians and surgeons , including John Maubray . In The Female Physician Maubray had proposed women could give birth to a creature he named a Sooterkin . He was a proponent of maternal impression , a widely held belief that conception and pregnancy could be influenced by what the mother dreamt , or saw , and warned pregnant women that over @-@ familiarity with household pets could cause their children to resemble those pets . He was reportedly happy to attend Toft , pleased that her case appeared to vindicate his theories , but man @-@ midwife James Douglas , like Manningham , presumed that the affair was a hoax and despite St. André 's repeated invitations , kept his distance . Douglas was one of the country 's most respected anatomists and a well @-@ known man @-@ midwife , whereas St. André was often considered to be a member of the court only because of his ability to speak the king 's native German . St. André therefore desperately wanted the two to attend Toft ; after George I 's accession to the throne the Whigs had become the dominant political faction , and Manningham and Douglas ' Whig affiliations and medical knowledge might have elevated his status as both doctor and philosopher . Douglas thought that a woman giving birth to rabbits was as likely as a rabbit giving birth to a human child , but despite his scepticism he went to see her . When Manningham informed him of the suspected hog 's bladder , and after he examined Toft , he refused to engage St. André on the matter : 
 To be able to determine , to the Satisfaction and Conviction of all sorts of Persons , other Arguments were necessary , than Anatomy , or any other Branch of <unk> [ sic ] , could furnish . Of these the greatest Number are not Judges . It was therefore undoubtedly very natural for me to desire that People would suspend any farther Judgement for a little Time , till such Proofs could be brought of the <unk> as they <unk> 'd . 
 Under constant supervision , Toft went into labour several times , to no avail . 
 = = Confession = = 
 The hoax was uncovered on 4 December . Thomas Onslow , 2nd Baron Onslow , had begun an investigation of his own and discovered that for the past month Toft 's husband , Joshua , had been buying young rabbits . Convinced he had enough evidence to proceed , in a letter to physician Sir Hans Sloane he wrote that the affair had " almost alarmed England " and that he would soon publish his findings . The same day , Thomas Howard , a porter at the bagnio , confessed to Justice of the Peace Sir Thomas <unk> that he had been bribed by Toft 's sister @-@ in @-@ law , Margaret , to sneak a rabbit into Toft 's chamber . When arrested and questioned Mary denied the accusation , while Margaret , under Douglas 's interrogation , claimed that she had obtained the rabbit for eating only . 
 I told my sister of my having sent for a rabbit and I desire [ d ] her to give it to the porter to be <unk> [ sic ] away which my sister did saying she would not have it known for 1000 p [ <unk> ] d [ s ] . 
 Manningham examined Toft and thought something remained in the cavity of her uterus , and so he successfully persuaded <unk> to allow her to remain at the bagnio . Douglas , who had by then visited Toft , questioned her on three or four occasions , each time for several hours . After several days of this Manningham threatened to perform a painful operation on her , and on 7 December , in the presence of Manningham , Douglas , John Montagu and Frederick Calvert , Toft finally confessed . Following her miscarriage and while her cervix permitted access , an accomplice had inserted into her womb the claws and body of a cat , and the head of a rabbit . They had also invented a story in which Toft claimed that during her pregnancy and while working in a field , she had been startled by a rabbit , and had since become obsessed with rabbits . For later <unk> , animal parts had been inserted into her vagina . 
 Pressured again by Manningham and Douglas ( it was the latter who took her confession ) , she made a further admission on 8 December and another on 9 December , before being sent to Tothill Fields Bridewell , charged on a statute of Edward III as a " vile cheat and imposter " . In her earlier , unpublished confessions , she blamed the entire affair on a range of other participants , from her mother @-@ in @-@ law to John Howard . She also claimed that a travelling woman told her how to insert the rabbits into her body , and how such a scheme would ensure that she would " never want as long as I liv 'd " . The British Journal reported that on 7 January 1727 she appeared at the Courts of Quarter Sessions at Westminster , charged " for being an abominable cheat and imposter in pretending to be delivered of several monstrous births " . Margaret Toft had remained staunch , and refused to comment further . Mist 's Weekly Journal of 24 December 1726 reported that " the nurse has been examined as to the person 's concerned with her , but either was kept in the dark as to the imposition , or is not willing to disclose what she knows ; for nothing can be got from her ; so that her resolution shocks others . " 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Following the hoax the medical profession 's gullibility became the target of a great deal of public mockery . William Hogarth published <unk> , or The Wise Men of <unk> in Consultation ( 1726 ) , which portrays Toft in the throes of labour , surrounded by the tale 's chief participants . Figure " F " is Toft , " E " is her husband . " A " is St. André , and " D " is Howard . In Dennis Todd 's Three Characters in Hogarth 's <unk> and Some Implications the author concludes that figure " G " is Mary Toft 's sister @-@ in @-@ law , Margaret Toft . Toft 's confession of 7 December demonstrates her insistence that her sister @-@ in @-@ law played no part in the hoax , but Manningham 's 1726 An Exact Diary of what was observ 'd during a Close Attendance upon Mary Toft , the pretended Rabbet @-@ Breeder of Godalming in Surrey offers eyewitness testimony of her complicity . Hogarth 's print was not the only image that ridiculed the affair — George Vertue published The Surrey @-@ Wonder , and The Doctors in Labour , or a New Wim @-@ Wam in Guildford ( 12 plates ) , a broadsheet published in 1727 which satirises St. André , was also popular at the time . 
 The timing of Toft 's confession proved awkward for St. André , who on 3 December had published his forty @-@ page pamphlet A Short Narrative of an Extraordinary Delivery of Rabbets . On this document the surgeon had staked his reputation , and although it offers a more empirical account of the Toft case than earlier more fanciful publications about reproduction in general , ultimately it was derided . Ahlers , his scepticism justified , published Some observations concerning the woman of <unk> in Surrey , which details his account of events and his suspicion of the complicity of both St. André and Howard . 
 St. André recanted his views on 9 December 1726 . In 1729 , following the death of Samuel Molyneux from poisoning , he married Molyneux 's widow , Elizabeth . This did little to impress his peers . Molyneux 's cousin accused him of the poisoning , a charge that St. André defended by suing for defamation , but the careers of St. André and his wife were permanently damaged . Elizabeth lost her attendance on Queen Caroline , and St. André was publicly humiliated at court . Living on Elizabeth 's considerable wealth , they retired to the country , where St. André died in 1776 , aged 96 . Manningham , desperate to exculpate himself , published a diary of his observations of Mary Toft , together with an account of her confession of the fraud , on 12 December . In it he suggested that Douglas had been fooled by Toft , and concerned with his image Douglas replied by publishing his own account . Using the pseudonym ' Lover of Truth and Learning ' , in 1727 Douglas also published The Sooterkin Dissected . A letter to Maubray , Douglas was scathingly critical of his Sooterkin theory , calling it " a mere fiction of your [ Maubray 's ] brain " . The damage done to the medical profession was such that several doctors not connected with the tale felt compelled to print statements that they had not believed Toft 's story . On 7 January 1727 John Howard and Toft appeared before the bench , where Howard was fined £ 800 ( £ 107 thousand today ) . He returned to Surrey and continued his practice , and died in 1755 . 
 Crowds reportedly mobbed Tothill Fields Bridewell for months , hoping to catch a glimpse of the now infamous Toft . By this time she had become quite ill , and while incarcerated had her portrait drawn by John Laguerre . She was ultimately discharged on 8 April 1727 , as it was unclear as to what charge should have been made against her . The Toft family made no profit from the affair , and Mary Toft returned to Surrey . She had a daughter in February 1727 , and reappeared briefly in 1740 when she was imprisoned for receiving stolen goods , but her death was reported in 1763 . 
 The case was cited by Robert Walpole 's opponents as symbolising the age , which they perceived as greedy , corrupt and deceitful . One author , writing to the Prince of Wales 's mistress , suggested the story was a political portent of the approaching death of the prince 's father . On 7 January 1727 Mist 's Weekly Journal satirised the matter , making several allusions to political change , and comparing the affair to the events of 1641 when Parliament began its revolution against King Charles I. The scandal provided the writers of Grub Street with enough material to produce pamphlets , squibs , broadsides and ballads for several months . With publications such as St. André 's Miscarriage ( 1727 ) and The anatomist dissected : or the man @-@ midwife finely brought to bed ( 1727 ) satirists scorned the objectivity of men @-@ midwives , and critics of Toft 's attendants questioned their integrity , undermining their profession with sexual puns and allusions . The case raised questions about England 's status as an " enlightened " nation — Voltaire used the case in his brief essay <unk> de la nature to describe how the Protestant English were still influenced by an ignorant Church . 
 Toft did not escape the ire of the satirists , who concentrated mainly on sexual innuendo . Some took advantage of a common 18th @-@ century word for a rabbit track — prick — and others were scatological in nature . However , Much Ado about Nothing ; or , A Plain Refutation of All that Has Been Written or Said Concerning the Rabbit @-@ Woman of Godalming ( 1727 ) is one of the more cutting satires on Toft . The document supposes to be the confession of ' Merry Tuft ' , " ... in her own Stile and Spelling " . <unk> fun at her illiteracy , it makes a number of obscene suggestions hinting at her promiscuity — " I <unk> a <unk> as had grate <unk> parts , and a large <unk> , and <unk> of being <unk> in <unk> <unk> . " The document also ridicules several of the physicians involved in the affair , and reflects the general view portrayed by the satirists that Toft was a weak woman and the least complicit of " the offenders " ( regardless of her guilt ) . The notion contrasts with that expressed of her before the hoax was revealed and may indicate an overall strategy to disempower Toft completely . This is reflected in one of the most notable satires of the affair , Alexander Pope and William Pulteney 's anonymous satirical ballad The Discovery ; or , The Squire Turn 'd Ferret . Published in 1726 and aimed at Samuel Molyneux , it rhymes " hare " with " hair " , and " coney " with " <unk> " . The ballad opens with the following verse : 
 Most true it is , I dare to say , 
 E 'er since the Days of Eve , 
 The weakest Woman sometimes may 
 The wisest Man deceive .

 As Reed Richards and Sue Storm prepare for their wedding , a silver object enters Earth 's atmosphere , creating immense craters around the world . General Hager directs Reed to track and identify its movements . 
 During the wedding , Reed 's systems detect the phenomenon approaching New York City , which suffers a blackout since from the objects electromagnetic pulses . Johnny Storm pursues the object , discovering it to be a silver humanoid on a flying surfboard . The " Silver Surfer " drags him into the upper atmosphere , suffocates and then drops him . Johnny barely survives , successfully flying only at the last moment . Later , Sue and Johnny find they have switched powers after touching , prompting Reed to deduce that exposure to the Surfer has affected Johnny 's molecular structure , allowing these transfers of their powers . Tracing the Surfer 's cosmic energy , Reed discovers that a series of planets the alien has visited are all destroyed . 
 Reed and Sue contemplate abandoning their lives as superheroes in order to have a normal life and raise a family , but are unaware Johnny is listening . With the Surfer creating craters around the globe , Reed determines that the next will appear in London . The team arrives too late to stop the crater , which drains the River Thames , but they prevent the London Eye from collapsing after it is damaged by the quake . Meanwhile , the Surfer 's movements around the globe bring him past Latveria , where the cosmic energy affects Victor Von Doom , freeing him from two years encased in metal . A scarred Doom traces the Surfer to the Russell Glacier and offers to join forces . When the Surfer rebuffs him , Doom attacks . The Surfer retaliates , blasting Doom through the ice , but the cosmic energy of the Surfer 's blast heals Doom 's body . 
 Doom leverages his experience into a deal with the American military , which forces the Fantastic Four to work with Doom . Deducing that the Surfer 's board is the source of his power , Reed develops a tachyon pulse generator that will separate the Surfer from it , while Doom devises a machine whose function he keeps secret . In the Black Forest , the Surfer confronts Sue and reveals he is merely a servant to the destroyer of worlds , and regrets the destruction he causes . The military opens fire on the Surfer , which distracts him and allows the Fantastic Four to fire the pulse , separating the Surfer from his board . The military imprisons the Surfer in Siberia , where they torture him for information . Sue uses her powers to sneak into his cell , where he informs her that his master , known by the people of his world as Galactus , is a massive cloud @-@ like cosmic entity that feeds on life @-@ bearing planets to survive , and that his board is a homing beacon summoning Galactus to the planet . The Silver Surfer has to serve Galactus , who will otherwise destroy the Surfer 's planet . 
 Using the device he created earlier , Doom betrays Hager and steals the board from the compound , killing most of the Army personnel there . The Fantastic Four rescue the Surfer and pursue Doom in the <unk> , confronting him in Shanghai . During the battle , Sue is severely wounded . With the Surfer powerless , Johnny absorbs the combined powers of the entire team in order to battle the now cosmic energy @-@ empowered Doom . Johnny succeeds in breaking Doom 's control over the Surfer 's board , and Ben Grimm uses a nearby crane to knock Doom into the harbor . However , Galactus arrives and Sue appears to die in Reed 's arms . The Surfer regains control of his board , restoring his power . He revives Sue and chooses to defend Earth , flying , with an extra boost from Johnny , into Galactus . The conflict results in a massive blast of energy that engulfs Galactus , and apparently kills the Surfer as well . Johnny recovers his stable molecular state after touching the Surfer 's board . 
 Reed and Sue marry in Japan , in an abbreviated ceremony . Receiving news that Venice is sinking into the Adriatic , the team heads to Italy . In a mid @-@ credits scene , the Silver Surfer 's seemingly lifeless body floats through space . His eyes then open and his board races toward him .

 With Fantastic Four grossing $ 330 million worldwide , 20th Century Fox hired director Tim Story and screenwriter Mark Frost in December 2005 to return for the superhero team 's sequel . Screenwriters Frost and Don Payne were hired to write the screenplay . Payne has said the film is based upon " The Galactus Trilogy " , in which Galactus also makes an appearance , as well as issues 57 @-@ 60 in which Doom steals the Surfer 's power . Payne has also said the film takes inspiration from the Ultimate Marvel limited series Ultimate Extinction . As of March 2 , 2007 , Galactus 's design was not yet done , and by April 18 , until hiring Laurence Fishburne to perform the voice of the Silver Surfer , the filmmakers were unsure of whether the character would speak . 
 The film includes the <unk> @-@ Car , a larger role for Kerry Washington 's character Alicia Masters , and in June 2006 , the Silver Surfer was announced to appear in the sequel as a " villain / hero " . The Silver Surfer was created by combining the performance of actor Doug Jones and a grey @-@ silver suit designed by Jose Fernandez . FX shop Spectral Motion created the Surfer , who was then been enhanced by a new computer @-@ generated system designed by WETA . 
 The sequel , whose working title was Fantastic Four 2 , was officially titled Fantastic Four : Rise of the Silver Surfer in August 2006 with filming beginning on August 28 in Vancouver and set for a release date of June 15 , 2007 . Michael Chiklis 's prosthetics as The Thing were also redesigned to allow him to take it off in between takes and for better ventilation . 
 In August 2006 , actor Andre Braugher dropped out of his supporting role in the TV series ER to be cast in Rise of the Silver Surfer . Braugher was cast as General Hager , whom director Story described as " an old acquaintance of Reed Richards and one of the major additions to the movie " . In September , Jones was confirmed to portray the Silver Surfer in addition to Julian McMahon reprising his role as Doctor Doom . The Baxter Building was also redesigned . Braugher , McMahon and Chiklis were all starring in FX Network dramas that year .

 In August 2009 , Fox announced plans to reboot the Fantastic Four film franchise , with Michael Green and Jeremy Slater writing , Seth Grahame @-@ Smith polishing the film 's script , and Akiva Goldsman and Matthew Vaughn producing . After the release of 2012 's Chronicle , Josh Trank was linked to the reboot , and in mid July 2012 , he was officially announced to be director . Filming started mid September 2013 . As it is produced by Fox , the film is independent from the Marvel Cinematic Universe . Fantastic Four was released on August 7 , 2015 .

 In the cold open , Kevin struggles to correctly transfer phone calls , after having been moved to reception by Charles . 
 Michael ( Steve Carell ) , having left Dunder Mifflin with Pam ( Jenna Fischer ) to form his own company , is having trouble starting his first day as president of the Michael Scott Paper Company . Pam tries to keep things together and suggests they create a list of things to do to maintain a positive working atmosphere . Michael sets up a meeting with a potential investor and makes a list of potential salesmen to join the company . He receives a letter from his realtor saying that running a business from his condominium is in violation of his residence agreement , so he needs to find office space for the company . Michael and Pam leave to find potential salesmen and then have their meeting with the potential investor . 
 Michael 's first stop is his old part @-@ time telemarketing job to pick up Vikram . Next , they stop at a bowling alley , where Ryan ( B. J. Novak ) , with bleached blond hair , is now working the shoe counter . Michael asks Ryan to join them , despite heavy protests from Pam . Ryan is convinced and steals two pairs of bowling shoes on the way out . They head to the meeting with the investor , who turns out to be Michael 's " nana , " at a nursing home . Michael gives her his pitch , but she does not believe his new venture will yield success and refuses to fund his company . 
 Meanwhile , at the Dunder Mifflin office , Charles Miner ( Idris Elba ) is revealed to have an obsession with soccer , and the rest of the employees pretend to feel the same way about it . When Jim ( John Krasinski ) tries claiming to be an experienced soccer player , Dwight ( Rainn Wilson ) , attempting to humiliate Jim , suggests that the staff play a game after work in the parking lot . During the game , when Charles kicks the ball towards Jim , he ducks and the ball hits Phyllis ( Phyllis Smith ) in the face . Charles berates Jim for ducking , and Dwight mocks him . 
 In the car leaving the nursing home , Vikram asks to be brought back to the telemarketing job after he learns " nana " is a term for grandmother . Back at Michael 's condo , a frustrated Pam loses her composure and tells Michael she made a mistake leaving Dunder Mifflin and only did it because she was tired of being a receptionist . Michael calms her down , telling her the reality is they both quit and that their only option is to continue trying with the new company . Michael purchases office space in the Scranton Business Park , where Dunder Mifflin is located ; it turns out to be a large closet directly underneath the Dunder Mifflin office . Michael and Pam put their company name in the office lobby directory where they encounter Charles . Michael taunts Charles that he cannot kick them out of the building now because they own their own space .

 " Dream Team " was written by B. J. Novak and directed by Paul Feig . It originally aired on April 9 , 2009 , the same day as the episode " Michael Scott Paper Company " ; the debut episode of the new NBC show Parks and Recreation was shown between the two episodes . It marks the first appearance of Novak as Ryan since " Frame Toby " in November 2008 , when Novak briefly left the show to film his role in Quentin Tarantino 's Inglourious Basterds . Mindy Kaling , an Office writer who also stars as Kelly Kapoor , thought of the idea of Ryan dying his hair blond . Novak wore a baseball cap in public between the times his hair was dyed and when the episode aired , in order to make the reveal a surprise , and even kept the cap on when he and the rest of the cast and crew did a public forum and Q & A session . " Dream Team " was the third of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba , best known as Stringer Bell from the television series The Wire . Elba said he did not watch the episode when it aired because " I 'm hypercritical about my work , so I try not to torture myself . " 
 Prior to the episode airing , NBC set up a web site for the new Michael Scott Paper Company at <unk> , which included a mission statement for the company , photos of the new office space and a downloadable copy of the coupon for " unparalleled customer service " featured in the episode " Michael Scott Company " . Another official NBC site , <unk> , created a Flash game inspired by the episode , in which the viewer attempts to kick a soccer ball past Jim in the office parking lot and hit Phyllis in the face . 
 The official The Office website included two cut scenes from " Dream Team " within a week of the episode 's original release . In one minute @-@ long clip , Andy continues brown @-@ nosing to Charles ; during a documentary interview , Andy says he was not the teacher 's pet in school , but that he " walked the teacher 's pet , and fed it , and bathed it " . A second one @-@ minute clip involves the soccer game itself : Dwight excitedly sets up the game , Jim tries not to show Charles he does not know what " offside " means and Creed picks up the ball and hurls it at Kelly .

 Michael refers to his old telemarketing job where he met salesman Vikram ; this is a reference to the fourth season episode " Money " , in which Michael briefly works a second job as a telemarketer . The bowling alley Ryan works at is Idle Hour Lanes , an actual bowling alley in Dickson City , Pennsylvania , which is just outside the show 's setting of Scranton . When Michael discusses song parodies , he names " My Stumps " in a reference to The Black Eyed Peas song " My Humps " and " Achy Breaky Fart " in a reference to the Billy Ray Cyrus song " Achy Breaky Heart " . In discussing the formation of the new paper company , Pam refers to the early years of Apple Inc . , which she said began in a garage .

 In its original American broadcast on April 9 , 2009 , " Dream Team " was watched by 7 @.@ 2 million overall viewers , according to Nielsen ratings . The episode earned more ratings than the Parks and Recreation pilot that immediately followed it ( which had 6 @.@ 8 million viewers ) but had less than " Michael Scott Paper Company " , which came right after Parks and Recreation and had 8 million viewers . " Dream Team " , as well as " Michael Scott Paper Company " , had the most viewers in its time slot among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 . 
 " Dream Team " received generally positive reviews . Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger said he was enjoying the new paper company storyline and that " Dream Team " was funnier than " Michael Scott Paper Company " . Sepinwall said the final scene with Michael trying to comfort Pam in the car was a " good payoff " which was well acted by Steve Carell and Jenna Fischer , and " yet another reminder that Michael does know what he 's doing some of the time , which means Pam wasn 't a complete idiot for following him out the door . " He also liked Kevin 's struggle with the phones in the beginning , but said the storyline between Jim and Charles was getting repetitive and , " It would help if the writers ever gave Idris Elba something funny to do . " Steven Mullen of The Tuscaloosa News called the episode " stellar " , said the Charles Miner soccer subplot ended " perfectly " and said , " Watching [ Michael 's ] fears bubble beneath the surface and slowly erode Pam 's confidence was a masterwork . " 
 Travis Fickett of IGN said he was happy with the new , unpredictable direction The Office was taking . He particularly praised the Michael / Pam relationship in the episode , as well as soccer subplot involving Jim and Charles and the return of Ryan ; he said Ryan 's new bleached blond hair and his theft of bowling shoes were particularly funny moments . Will Leitch of New York magazine said the episode has provided a change the show needed , and said , " Considering how unlikely it was that The Office was going to allow Michael and Pam to degrade into homelessness and squalor , the show has handled the predictable transition as well as possible . " Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said the episode included a good exploration of Michael and Pam 's relationship ; he said " they 're weirdly good together " . Phipps , who gave the episode an A- grade , also said the Dunder Mifflin material worked well , " although Idris Elba has been so good at portraying a heartless professional it almost doesn ’ t seem right for anything to break through his icy exterior . " 
 Margaret Lions of Entertainment Weekly said the episode had " strong moments , and some interesting character play [ but ] I didn 't get quite the same buzz from this week 's installments as I did from the previous episode . " She said " Dream Team " lacks the usual group interactions between the office co @-@ workers , which she said are normally the funniest parts of the show . However , she praised Michael 's pep talk to Pam in the final scene , and said the episode was " the best showcase Jenna Fischer has had in years " . Entertainment Weekly listed Michael 's pep talk to Pam at the end of the episode as one of the 13 highlights from that week in television . 
 In her list of the top ten moments from the fifth season of The Office , phillyBurbs.com writer Jen Wielgus ranked Michael 's formation of the Michael Scott Paper Company in the downstairs storage closet as number one , citing the " Dream Team " , " Michael Scott Paper Company " and " Heavy Competition " episodes in particular . She also said she specifically enjoyed the attempt to solicit investments at the retirement home from " Dream Team " . Ryan 's return to the series , along with his brief return as a temp in the episode " Weight Loss " , ranked number 5 in that list . " Dream Team " was voted the fifteenth highest @-@ rated episode out of 26 from the fifth season , according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally ; the episode was rated 8 @.@ 00 out of 10 .

 = Hugh Trumble = 
 Hugh Trumble ( 12 May 1867 – 14 August 1938 ) was an Australian cricketer who played 32 Test matches as a bowling all @-@ rounder between 1890 and 1904 . He captained the Australian team in two Tests , winning both . Trumble took 141 wickets in Test cricket — a world record at the time of his retirement — at an average of 21 @.@ 78 runs per wicket . He is one of only four bowlers to twice take a hat @-@ trick in Test cricket . Observers in Trumble 's day , including the authoritative Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack , regarded him as ranking among the great Australian bowlers of the Golden Age of cricket . He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1897 and the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame , established in 1996 , inducted him in 2004 . 
 A tall and thin off spinner , Trumble delivered the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers , using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage . He was at his best on the softer pitches of England , but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia . He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips . He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team @-@ mates and opponents , with a penchant for practical jokes . 
 Trumble made his Test debut during the Australian cricket team 's tour of England in 1890 , but was unable to secure a permanent place in the Australian side until the 1896 tour of England . When the Australian team next toured England in 1899 , Trumble scored 1 @,@ 183 runs and took 142 wickets ; only George Giffen before him had achieved the " double " of 1 @,@ 000 runs and 100 wickets as part of a touring team in England . He was appointed captain of Australia in 1901 – 02 , when Joe Darling was unavailable due to farming commitments . He retired after the 1902 Australian tour of England but was coaxed back in 1903 – 04 . In his last Test match , Trumble took a hat @-@ trick , his second , in front of his home town supporters in Melbourne . 
 Off the field , Trumble worked for the National Bank of Australasia , rising to the position of manager of a local branch despite his cricket commitments interrupting his banking career . In 1911 , he was appointed secretary of the Melbourne Cricket Club , overseeing the development of the Melbourne Cricket Ground ( MCG ) into a stadium capable of holding over 70 @,@ 000 spectators . He held this post until his death in 1938 from a heart attack , aged 71 . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Trumble was born in the inner Melbourne neighbourhood of Collingwood , Victoria in 1867 , the son of William , born in Northern Ireland and superintendent of an insane asylum , and Scottish @-@ born Elizabeth ( née Clark ) . His elder brother , John , also played Test cricket for Australia and his younger brother , Thomas , was a public servant who served as Secretary for the Department of Defence from 1918 – 27 , and then official secretary to the High Commissioner for Australia in London . 
 Trumble spent part of his early life in the western Victorian town of Ararat before returning to Melbourne , settling in suburban Camberwell . He was educated at Hawthorn Grammar School and played his early cricket for Kew Cricket Club . Encouraging his sons ' early love of cricket , William Trumble — a keen cricketer who bowled leg breaks for South Melbourne Cricket Club — set out a cricket pitch at the family home . He placed a feather on a good length and urged his sons to aim at it when bowling . Known for his accuracy , Hugh later said , " Of course I couldn 't repeatedly hit the feather , but I soon reached the stage when I was always pretty close to it " 
 Trumble transferred to the Melbourne Cricket Club for the 1887 – 88 cricket season and was an immediate success . He took 36 wickets that season , finishing with an average of 6 @.@ 77 runs per wicket ; the best in the club , beating his teammate and Australian Test bowler Fred Spofforth . He made his first @-@ class cricket debut for Victoria that same season , selected to play against a touring English XI led by Middlesex batsman George Vernon . His first match for Victoria against Australian opposition was against New South Wales at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . Bowling with Spofforth , in the first innings Trumble took seven wickets for 52 runs .

 = = = Early struggle = = = 
 Early in the 1889 – 90 Australian season , Trumble endured a period where he was not able to take wickets consistently . With selection of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time , Trumble was anxious about this poor run of form . Noting his anxiety while playing , a friend offered him a beer during the lunch break to revive his spirits . Previously a teetotaler , Trumble enjoyed his first taste and ordered another before re @-@ entering the field of play . Feeling relaxed , although wondering about his steadiness of step , Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure his selection in the Australian team . Trumble finished the season with 27 wickets at an average of 14 @.@ 20 per wicket . 
 The 1890 Australian team touring England was relatively inexperienced . The team missed the all @-@ round ability of George Giffen , who had refused to join the squad , thinking it unlikely the tour would be a sporting or financial success . The Australians won 13 matches on tour , losing 16 and drawing 9 . Trumble made his Test cricket debut in the First Test against the English team at Lord 's Cricket Ground . He took only one wicket , dismissing Bobby Peel caught and bowled for 1 . Batting at number eleven in the first innings he made 1 not out and in the second , 5 runs batting at number ten . Despite this lack of success , he retained his spot in the team for the Second Test at The Oval where he failed to take a wicket . He was selected for the Third Test at Old Trafford but continuous rain saw the match abandoned without a ball being bowled . Trumble played 28 first @-@ class matches during the tour , scoring 288 runs at an average of 8 @.@ 47 and took 52 wickets at an average of 21 @.@ 75 . Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack wrote , " Reports from Australia had led us to expect a great deal of ... Trumble " but his " straightness and regular length [ were ] insufficient to compensate for an obvious lack of ' devil ' and variety " . 
 Trumble was not selected for the Australian team to play Lord Sheffield 's touring English team in 1891 – 92 . He did not return to the Australian team until his selection in the squad to tour England in 1893 . Before the Test matches he took 14 wickets for 116 runs ( 14 / 116 ) against the Players followed by 12 / 84 against Kent at Gravesend . He played in all three Test matches in 1893 , taking 6 wickets at an average of 39 @.@ 00 . Trumble scored 58 runs in the Tests with a highest score of 35 but had more success in the other matches , scoring 774 runs , including one century in all first @-@ class matches on tour . Wisden noted that " An immense improvement on his form of three years before was shown by Hugh Trumble , who bowled consistently well all through the tour " and " ... the reports of Hugh Trumble 's improvement in batting were amply borne out , his hitting in many matches being remarkably fine " . 
 When Andrew Stoddart 's English team visited Australia in 1894 – 95 , Trumble played only one Test , the Second at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . In the first innings , England scored 75 runs with Trumble taking 3 wickets . England fought back in their second innings , scoring 475 runs to win the Test by 94 runs ; Trumble failed to take a wicket . 
 = = = Established cricketer = = = 
 Trumble was selected in the Australian team to tour England in 1896 , despite a poor domestic season in 1895 – 96 that saw his place in the touring squad seriously questioned by pundits . The leading cricket journalist , Tom Horan said that as much as he personally liked Trumble , he could not see him as a member of a team for the England tour that season . It was , however , during this tour that Trumble finally established a permanent place in the Australian line up . Wisden said of Trumble when listing him as one of its Cricketers of the Year , " ... it was not until his third visit , during the past season , that Trumble convinced Englishmen he was entitled to rank among the great bowlers of Australia " . In that season , Trumble took 148 wickets at an average of 15 @.@ 81 . He was seen as Australia 's leading bowler who " was able to inspire [ the English ] batsmen with a feeling of apprehension " . Wisden 's summary of the 1896 Australian tour said of Trumble , " His great strength lay in the combination of spin with extreme accuracy " and " he was on all wickets distinctly the best bowler on the [ Australian ] side " . 
 England won the First Test at Lord 's by 6 wickets , Trumble taking one wicket in each innings . The Second Test at Old Trafford was more closely fought . Despite K. S. Ranjitsinhji scoring a " marvellous " 154 and Tom Richardson " bowling in his finest form " the Australians managed to hold on for a 3 wicket victory . The Australians required 125 runs to win in their second innings and were expected to make this target easily . Richardson 's skilful bowling however saw Trumble and Kelly batting together with only 3 wickets in hand but with 25 runs still to make . Against excellent bowling and in a tense atmosphere , the pair managed to bat Australia home with the last runs taking an hour to score , mainly in singles . Trumble made 17 not out to follow his 24 runs in the first innings and his 4 wickets . With the series tied at one Test apiece , the Third and final Test was played at The Oval in London . On a pitch damaged by rain , the English batted first and were dismissed for 145 . Trumble took 6 wickets for 59 runs , including a 9 @-@ over spell of 5 wickets for 10 runs . England fought back to bowl the Australians out for 119 . In turn , the Australians restricted England to 84 runs with Trumble taking 6 wickets for 30 , to leave Australia requiring 111 runs in their second innings to win the match . Bobby Peel and Jack Hearne combined to bowl Australia out for 44 runs to win the Test by 66 runs and retain the Ashes for England . In the three Tests , Trumble took 18 wickets at an average of 18 @.@ 83 runs per wicket . 
 Trumble played in every Test of the 1897 – 98 series against the touring English , who were again captained by Stoddart . England won the First Test in Sydney by 9 wickets with Trumble 's 70 runs the highest score in the Australian first innings . Under the captaincy of Harry Trott , Australia fought back to win the Second Test in Melbourne by an innings and 55 runs . Trumble took 8 wickets in the match and in partnership with Monty Noble bowled the English out for 150 runs in the second innings . Australia won the Third Test in Adelaide by an innings and 13 runs ; Trumble made 37 runs in the Australian innings and took 1 wicket for the match . In the Fourth Test , Trumble combined with Clem Hill in a 165 run partnership for the seventh wicket , described by Wisden as the turning point in the innings . Australia won the match by 8 wickets . Australia won the Fifth Test and the series four Tests to one . For the series overall , Trumble took 19 wickets at an average of 28 @.@ 15 runs per wicket and scored 170 runs at an average of 36 @.@ 20 . 
 The 1899 Australian tour saw Trumble score 1 @,@ 183 runs and take 142 wickets ; he was only the second Australian , after George Giffen , to score 1 @,@ 000 runs and take 100 wickets in an English season as part of a touring team . In the Test series , Trumble took 15 wickets at an average of 25 @.@ 00 and made 232 runs at an average of 38 @.@ 66 . Wisden said of Trumble 's batting that season , " [ Trumble ] played so consistently well as to make it clear that if he had not been a bowler he would have been a great batsman " . Dry pitches saw his bowling average fall off a little from the 1896 tour but Wisden stated that he " bowled quite as well as in 1896 " and " [ he ] never seemed easy to hit , and whenever the ground gave him least advantage ... he was deadly " . Australia won the Second Test by 10 wickets and with the other Tests finishing in draws , they retained the Ashes in a one Test to nil series victory . Trumble played particularly well in the Third Test at Headingley , where he took 5 wickets for 60 runs and was the highest run @-@ scorer in the Australian second innings with 56 . 
 = = = Hat @-@ tricks and captaincy = = = 
 At the age of 34 , Trumble was chosen to captain the Australian team against England in 1901 – 02 when Joe Darling withdrew to manage his farm in Tasmania after the first three Tests . Australia won the two remaining Tests — the only occasions that Trumble would captain his country in Test cricket — to win the series four Tests to one . Earlier , in the Second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , Trumble took a " hat @-@ trick " ; only five hat @-@ tricks had been taken in the previous 24 years of Test cricket . He dismissed Arthur Jones , John Gunn and Sydney Barnes in successive balls to complete an Australian victory by 229 runs . In the Third Test in Adelaide , Trumble captured 6 wickets for 74 runs in the England second innings and made 62 not out to help the Australians win the match by 4 wickets . After this success with the bat , Trumble — in his new role as captain — promoted himself to open the batting alongside Victor Trumper . He made only 6 runs , handing the opening batsman role to Reggie Duff for the second innings . Australia won the Test by 7 wickets with Trumble not required to bat a second time . In the Fifth Test , again in Melbourne , Trumble took 5 wickets for 62 runs to help restrict England to a lead of 45 runs after the first innings . In the second innings Trumble took another 3 wickets and , combined with Noble 's 6 wickets , helped Australia win by 32 runs . Trumble and Noble were the most successful Australian bowlers during the series . Together they took 60 wickets in the Tests : Noble 32 at an average of 19 @.@ 00 and Trumble 28 at an average of 20 @.@ 03 . 
 Trumble 's last cricketing tour of England was in 1902 , with Darling returning to captain the Australian team . Early in the tour , Trumble broke his thumb at practice , causing him to miss the first month of the English season . Despite this , when he returned for the final three Tests he took 26 wickets . In the Fourth Test at Old Trafford , Trumble took 10 wickets . This included 6 wickets in the second innings when he combined with Jack Saunders to bowl England out for 120 ; securing an Australian victory by 3 runs . Trumble , recalling his final over of the match , said " With the ball greasy [ wet ] and my boots unable to get a proper foothold on slippery turf , it was the most trying over I ever bowled . " In the Fifth Test at The Oval , Trumble made 64 runs in the first innings and followed this with 8 wickets for 65 runs in the English first innings . He took another 4 wickets in the English second innings , but this was not sufficient to prevent an English victory by one wicket . Darling bowled Trumble unchanged from the Pavilion end throughout both innings of the match . Wisden praised Trumble 's bowling saying " Trumble , paying us his fifth visit , bowled perhaps better than ever " , but remarked that " it must be said that the wet weather and soft wickets were all in his favour " 
 After playing in one Test match against the South African team on a stopover when returning from England to Australia , Trumble retired from Test cricket , aged 35 . When Australia lost to the English tourists in the First Test in Sydney in 1903 – 04 , Trumble was persuaded to return for the Second Test under the captaincy of Noble . He was immediately successful taking 4 wickets for 107 runs in the first innings and 5 for 34 in the second , but was unable to prevent England from winning the Test by 185 runs Selected for the remaining four Tests , his 24 wickets in four Tests made Trumble the most successful Australian bowler in the series . The writer Roland Perry described Trumble 's final Test match as " the most dramatic and memorable farewell performance ever by a bowler " . In front of his home town supporters in Melbourne , he took 7 wickets for 28 runs , including a hat @-@ trick , to bowl Australia to victory ; Wisden describing his bowling in the second innings as " practically unplayable " . The hat @-@ trick , his second in Test cricket , consisted of the dismissals of Bernard Bosanquet , Plum Warner and Dick Lilley on 7 March . He went on to take the wicket of Ted Arnold , ending the match and his career in international cricket . 
 = = Style and personality = = 
 Always the same , whether on the winning or the losing side , Hugh Trumble is ... one of the most popular of Australian cricketers . 
 Trumble was tall and thin , 6 feet 4 inches ( 193 cm ) in height . His long face featured prominent ears and a large nose , while his long arms and uncommonly long and strong fingers assisted his bowling . The cricket writer Ray Robinson said of Trumble : " El Greco , with his lengthening touch would have liked to draw Trumble . Hugh 's lantern shaped head set on a column of a neck would have given the Spaniard a halfway start . " English cricketer and author Plum Warner called him " That great camel , Hughie Trumble . " 
 When bowling , Trumble made the most of his height , bringing the ball over the full extent of his right arm . His action was described by his team @-@ mate and bowling partner , Monty Noble , as " sidelong and insinuating , with his neck craned like a gigantic bird " . He bowled off spinners with an impeccable length at medium pace and was able to swing the new ball . He had a well @-@ disguised slower ball , <unk> batsmen such as Stanley Jackson , who said , " You old devil . You get me caught @-@ and @-@ bowled whenever you like but I 'll pick that slow one sooner or later . " He preferred English pitches , saying he hardly saw one on which he could not get some turn and the temperate weather allowed him to bowl all day . In Australia , Trumble had to work harder for his wickets on firmer pitches , relying on his change of pace and consistent accuracy ; he claimed he could land the ball on a saucer 17 metres ( 19 yd ) away five times out of six . Johnnie Moyes named him as an " immortal of the art " who succeeded by " attacking the batsman 's strength " . W. G. Grace called him " the best bowler Australia has sent us " . While Trumble was able to score 1 @,@ 183 runs during the 1899 tour of England , the demands of bowling did not allow him to consistently score heavily . His long , prehensile fingers helped him make a reputation as a fine slips fieldsman and he was the first to take 20 catches in an Australian season . English cricketer Johnny Douglas said , " Trumble should not be allowed on the cricket field — his natural place would be up trees in the bush . " He practised slip fielding by catching a tennis ball thrown against a brick wall ; he believed this practise trained him not to " snatch " at the ball but allow it to fall into his safe hands . 
 Trumble was known for his cleverness on the field . C. B. Fry said of him , " He is the most long @-@ headed , observant and acute judge of the game , a perfect master of the whole art of placing fieldsmen and changing bowlers . " On one occasion when captaining his state side , Victoria , he deliberately bowled two wides that his fieldsmen allowed to roll to the boundary to score four runs for his opponents . This was done to save his tired bowlers from having to bowl again immediately , as his opponents would have been required to follow @-@ on ( bat twice in a row ) , at the time compulsory . When questioned by an onlooker about the dubious sportsmanship of the action , he replied , " I had to do it , old chap , but I wonder what my father will think of it ? " Trumble was respected by his teammates and opponents ; New Zealand cricketer , Dan Reese , who played against and alongside Trumble said , " His subtle humour , his fund of cricket stories , his kindness , and , above all , his judgment , made him a man of exceptional character . " 
 He was popular with team @-@ mates and opponents alike , with a weakness for practical jokes . On board a ship travelling to England , Trumble offered to coach unsuspecting fellow travellers in various deck sports such as quoits . Accepting Trumble 's advice , they were made to contort themselves into a number of ludicrous positions to the amusement of his team @-@ mates and other onlookers in the know . To prolong the joke , in his own games Trumble would adopt the same peculiar stance and method he advocated . 
 = = Legacy and statistical analysis = = 
 " The first of the great off spinners of the Test @-@ match age " , in 32 Tests , Trumble took 141 wickets at an average of just over 20 runs per wicket . He took 5 wickets in an innings on nine occasions and 10 wickets in a match three times . On retirement , he had taken more wickets in Test cricket than any other player ; a record he held for nearly 10 years until surpassed by Sydney Barnes . It wasn 't until Dennis Lillee 75 years later that anyone was able to better Trumble 's 141 wickets against England . While mainly a bowler , Trumble batted well enough to make 851 runs in Test cricket at an average of 19 @.@ 79 with a highest score of 70 . Trumble was also prolific at first @-@ class level . He took 929 wickets , including 5 wickets in an innings on 69 occasions , and as a batsman , he made 5 @,@ 395 runs with three centuries and a highest score of 107 . For Melbourne Cricket Club , he took just under 400 wickets and scored more than 3 @,@ 000 runs ; winning the club best bowling average on six occasions and the best batting average once . 
 Trumble was particularly effective in England . After taking 52 wickets on his first tour of England in 1890 , his other four visits to England — in 1893 , 1896 , 1899 and 1902 — saw him take over 100 wickets in first @-@ class matches . In 1899 , he scored 1 @,@ 183 runs making him one of only four Australians , with George Giffen , Warwick Armstrong ( both three times ) and Jack Gregory , to take over 100 wickets and make over 1 @,@ 000 runs on a tour of England . 
 The ICC player rankings have been applied retrospectively to cricket history and Trumble achieved the top ranking as a bowler . By June 1896 , he was ranked fifth in the world and never again slipped lower ; from 1899 until his retirement he was the first or second best bowler in the world according to the ratings . As a batsman , Trumble 's ranking peaked at twelfth in the world after the Third Test in Adelaide in 1901 – 02 . 
 Trumble was the first player to take two hat @-@ tricks in Test cricket . Both hat @-@ tricks were taken against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , where Trumble played his club cricket . Hat @-@ tricks are extremely rare ; in over 131 years of Test cricket to March 2008 , there had only been 37 Test hat @-@ tricks and only Jimmy Matthews and Wasim Akram been able to repeat Trumble 's feat of taking a second . 
 = = Off the playing field = = 
 Trumble joined the National Bank of Australasia in 1887 to begin a career in banking . While the bank often allowed him time to practice , his frequent absences with cricket meant his career progression was slow ; after each of his five tours of England he returned to find junior bank officers promoted over him . Nevertheless , he was appointed accountant at the Richmond branch in 1903 and after his retirement from cricket in 1908 , manager of the Kew branch . 
 A loyal clubman , Trumble served on the committee of the Melbourne Cricket Club ( MCC ) from 1900 – 01 to 1910 – 11 and was made a life member in 1904 . In 1911 he resigned from the bank to become MCC club secretary ; a position he held for 27 years until his death . In this role , he played a leading part in reconciling the club and the Victorian Cricket Association after a period of some friction between the two bodies . He was instrumental in attracting quality cricketers to the club including Bert Ironmonger , whom Trumble saw play on a visit to Queensland . During his term as secretary , the Melbourne Cricket Ground was expanded to a capacity of over 70 @,@ 000 spectators . 
 Trumble was a prominent writer about and elder statesman of the game and was conspicuous in his support for journalists calling at any hour . From time to time , Trumble acted as a selector of the Victorian cricket team . In 2001 , Trumble was selected in the Melbourne Cricket Club Team of the Century , and in 2004 he was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame for his contribution to the sport in Australia . 
 In 1899 , aged 31 , Trumble met and fell in love with Florence Christian , aged 19 from Queensland . The couple were married in 1902 , with the wedding timed to allow a honeymoon trip accompanying the Australian cricket tour of England . An injury to his thumb freed Trumble from cricket commitments for a while , to his new wife 's delight . Together , the couple had eight children ; six sons and two daughters . One son , Robert , a renowned musician and writer , dedicated his first book , The Golden Age of Cricket , to his father . Trumble died aged 71 , from a heart attack in his home in the Melbourne eastern suburb of Hawthorn .

 After moving to the US , Rihanna signed a contract with Def Jam Recordings , and released her debut album Music of the Sun ( 2005 ) . The album was inspired by caribbean music , including soca , dancehall , and reggae , and incorporates dance @-@ pop and R & B. In an interview for MTV , Rihanna said that when she had arrived in the US , she had been exposed to different types of music that she had never heard before , including rock music , which she incorporated into her second studio album , A Girl like Me ( 2006 ) . 
 While recording her debut studio album in 2005 , Rihanna met Ne @-@ Yo for the first time , but they could not collaborate on the album . She wanted to work with him since she heard " Let Me Love You " ( 2004 ) by Mario , which Ne @-@ Yo wrote . When the production for A Girl like Me started , she considered working with him . She said , " So for the second album , I was like , ' You know what ? I have to work with that guy Ne @-@ Yo . ' So we went into the studio and we started working on this song . " Ne @-@ Yo and Norwegian production duo Mikkel S. Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen collectively known as StarGate wrote " Unfaithful " , which Rihanna said was " new ground for [ her ] " because it was a ballad . It was produced by StarGate while Debbie Mounsey served as a production assistant . " Unfaithful " was recorded by Eriksen , Al Hemberger , Malcolm Pollack and Tiger <unk> at Battery and Avatar Studios in New York City , Loft Recording Studios in Bronxville and Digital Insight Recording Studios in Las Vegas . It was mixed by Phil Tan and Makeba Riddick provided the vocal production . 
 " Unfaithful " was released as the second single from A Girl like Me , after the number @-@ one single " SOS " . The song was released to digital outlets in Canada on June 20 , 2006 . A radio edit of the song was release . It is under the same time length of the album and instrumental versions . For the plays on radio stations , the radio edit has the word " gun " omitted . It was also sent to urban contemporary radio stations in the United States on June 29 , 2006 . Seven digital remixes of " Unfaithful " were released on July 17 , 2006 , via iTunes in several countries including France , Germany , Italy , Spain and the US . A CD single of the song , comprising its album and instrumental version , a Tony Moran 's radio mix , and its music video , was released in the United Kingdom on July 25 , 2006 and in August of that year in Germany and France .

 " Unfaithful " is a pop and R & B ballad that runs for three minutes and forty @-@ six seconds . Originally , it was a dark and moody track inspired by the work of the American rock band Evanescence , with the initial title of " Murderer " . Hermansen and Eriksen collaborated on the melody of " Unfaithful " . In the beginning , the song 's structure was built around piano as the only instrument ; the percussion and strings was added later . The strings on the track were arranged by Robert <unk> . 
 Elaborating about the song 's development in an interview for Sound on Sound Eriksen said , " I find that how natural it sounds is not so much about how realistic the string sound is , but more about your choice of notes and how you play and program the strings . " According to the sheet music published by Universal Music Publishing Group at Musicnotes.com , it was composed in the key of C minor using in common time and a slow feeling groove of 72 beats per minute . Rihanna 's vocal range spans from the low note of F # 3 to the high note of C # 5 . 
 According to Brandee J. <unk> of MTV News , " Unfaithful " is a " bittersweet ballad " that shows a new side to Rihanna . In an interview for the same publication Rihanna said about the lyrics , " I 'm referred to as a murderer in that song . Meaning , I 'm taking this guy 's life by hurting him , cheating on him . He knows , and it makes him feel so bad . " She continued , " We always put it out there that guys cheat , and finally someone put it in perspective : girls cheat too . " In another interview for Newsday , she said that " Unfaithful " was " birthed out of a relationship she outgrew when she was fourteen " . She added that the nature of the relationship was not physical .

Slant Magazine 's Sal Cinquemani stated , " The melodramatic , string @-@ laden ballad ' Unfaithful ' is , if nothing else , an ambitious second single for an artist like Rihanna , and with lyrics like ' I don 't want to be a murderer / Our love , his trust / I might as well take a gun and put it to his head , ' it earns bonus points just for being so fucking weird " . 
 Steve Jones of USA Today wrote that while the other ballads on the album were not as strong , " ' Unfaithful ' , in which [ Rihanna ] deals with the consequences of her own cheating heart , shows depth " . Celia San Miguel from Vibe magazine praised " Unfaithful " , stating that it gives Rihanna a " new found charisma , solid vocal range and her ability to channel deep @-@ rooted emotions with ease " . Dan Charnas from The Washington Post described the single as " an honest account of dishonesty " .

The video premiered May 1 , 2006 on MTV , and was later released on iTunes for digital download . 
 As the video begins , Rihanna is walking towards a dressing room mirror while preparing for a show . This is intercut with scenes of Rihanna with her boyfriend in a restaurant . While they talk to each other , Rihanna 's boyfriend leaves the table and is absent for some time , during which Rihanna watches the other tables . One diner writes a note and gives it to a waiter , who passes it to Rihanna , who reads and quickly hides the note as her boyfriend returns to the table . Rihanna starts to sing the song 's lyrics while she leaves the dressing room and approaches the stage , where she continues singing while a man plays a piano on the stage . The arena is empty and it appears as though Rihanna is rehearsing . 
 Other scenes show Rihanna dancing around the piano while the pianist is still playing . While her boyfriend is sleeping , Rihanna sends a text message to her lover , " B down in 5 " .

 OpenBSD is a Unix @-@ like computer operating system descended from Berkeley Software Distribution ( BSD ) , a Research Unix derivative developed at the University of California , Berkeley . In late 1995 , Theo de Raadt forked it from NetBSD . Besides the operating system as a whole , the project maintains portable versions of many subsystems , most notably OpenSSH , which are available as packages in other operating systems . 
 The project is known for its developers ' insistence on open @-@ source code , good documentation , code correctness , and security . It has strict policies on licensing , preferring the ISC license and other variants of the Simplified BSD License . Many of its security features are optional or absent in other operating systems . Its developers frequently audit the source tree for software bugs and security holes . 
 De Raadt coordinates the project from his home in Calgary , Alberta , Canada . Its logo and mascot is a pufferfish named Puffy . 
 = = History and popularity = = 
 In December 1994 , NetBSD co @-@ founder Theo de Raadt was asked to resign from his position as a senior developer and member of the NetBSD core team . The reason for this is not wholly clear , although there are claims that it was due to personality clashes within the NetBSD project and on its mailing lists . 
 In October 1995 , de Raadt founded OpenBSD , a new project forked from NetBSD 1 @.@ 0 . The initial release , OpenBSD 1 @.@ 2 , was made in July 1996 , followed by OpenBSD 2 @.@ 0 in October of the same year . Since then , the project has followed a schedule of a release every six months , each of which is supported for one year . 
 On 25 July 2007 , OpenBSD developer Bob Beck announced the formation of the OpenBSD Foundation , a Canadian non @-@ profit organization formed to " act as a single point of contact for persons and organizations requiring a legal entity to deal with when they wish to support OpenBSD . " 
 Just how widely OpenBSD is used is hard to determine as its developers do not publish or collect usage statistics . In September 2005 , the BSD Certification Group performed a usage survey which revealed that 32 @.@ 8 % of BSD users ( 1420 of <unk> respondents ) were using OpenBSD , placing it second out of the four major BSD variants , behind FreeBSD with 77 % and ahead of NetBSD with 16 @.@ 3 % .

 = = Development and release process = = 
 Development is continuous , and team management is open and tiered . Anyone with appropriate skills may contribute , with commit rights being awarded on merit and de Raadt acting as coordinator . : <unk> Two official releases are made per year , with the version number incremented by 0 @.@ 1 , and these are each supported for twelve months ( two release cycles ) . Snapshot releases are also available at frequent intervals . 
 Maintenance patches for supported releases may be applied manually or by updating the system against the patch branch of the CVS repository for that release . Alternatively , a system administrator may opt to upgrade using a snapshot release and then regularly update the system against the <unk> branch of the CVS repository , in order to gain pre @-@ release access to recently added features . 
 The standard OpenBSD kernel , as maintained by the project , is strongly recommended for end users . Customized kernels are not supported by the project : " Users attempting to ' customize ' or ' optimize ' their kernel usually cause far more problems than they solve . " 
 Packages outside the base system are maintained by CVS through a ports tree and are the responsibility of the individual maintainers , known as porters . As well as keeping the current branch up to date , porters are expected to apply appropriate bug @-@ fixes and maintenance fixes to branches of their package for OpenBSD 's supported releases . Ports are generally not subject to the same continuous auditing as the base system due to lack of manpower . 
 Binary packages are built centrally from the ports tree for each architecture . This process is applied for the current version , for each supported release , and for each snapshot . Administrators are recommended to use the package mechanism rather than build the package from the ports tree , unless they need to perform their own source changes . 
 OpenBSD 's developers regularly meet at special events called <unk> , where they " sit down and code " , emphasizing productivity . 
 Every new release includes a song . 
 The OpenBSD Foundation was accepted as a mentoring organization for the 2014 Google Summer of Code . 
 = = Open @-@ source and open documentation = = 
 The OpenBSD Project is noted for its high @-@ quality user documentation , considered top among the BSD family operating systems , all of which have excellent documentation . When OpenBSD was created , de Raadt decided that the source should be easily available for anyone to read at any time , so , with the assistance of Chuck Cranor , he set up the first public , anonymous CVS server . At the time , the tradition was for only a small team of developers to have access to a project 's source repository . Cranor and de Raadt concluded that this practice " runs counter to the open source philosophy " and is inconvenient to contributors . De Raadt 's decision allowed " users to take a more active role " , and signaled the project 's belief in open and public access to source code . 
 OpenBSD does not include closed source binary drivers in the source tree , nor do they include code requiring the signing of non @-@ disclosure agreements . 
 Since OpenBSD is based in Canada , no United States export restrictions on cryptography apply , allowing the distribution to make full use of modern algorithms for encryption . For example , the swap space is divided into small sections and each section is encrypted with its own key , ensuring that sensitive data does not leak into an insecure part of the system . 
 OpenBSD <unk> various behaviors of applications , making them less predictable and thus more difficult to attack . For example , <unk> are created and associated randomly to processes ; the bind system call uses random port numbers ; files are created with random <unk> numbers ; and IP <unk> have random identifiers . This approach also helps expose bugs in the kernel and in user space programs . 
 The OpenBSD policy on openness extends to hardware documentation : in the slides for a December 2006 presentation , de Raadt explained that without it " developers often make mistakes writing drivers " , and pointed out that " the [ oh my god , I got it to work ] rush is harder to achieve , and some developers just give up . " He went on to say that vendor @-@ supplied binary drivers are unacceptable for inclusion in OpenBSD , that they have " no trust of vendor binaries running in our kernel " and that there is " no way to fix [ them ] ... when they break . " 
 = = Licensing = = 
 A goal of the OpenBSD Project is to " maintain the spirit of the original Berkeley Unix copyrights " , which permitted a " relatively un @-@ encumbered Unix source distribution . " To this end , the Internet Systems Consortium ( ISC ) license is preferred for new code , but the MIT and BSD licenses are also accepted . The widely used GNU General Public License is considered overly restrictive compared to these . 
 In June 2001 , triggered by concerns over Darren Reed 's modification of IPFilter 's license wording , a systematic license audit of the OpenBSD ports and source trees was undertaken . Code in more than a hundred files throughout the system was found to be unlicensed , ambiguously licensed or in use against the terms of the license . To ensure that all licenses were properly adhered to , an attempt was made to contact all the relevant copyright holders : some pieces of code were removed , many were replaced , and others , such as the multicast routing tools <unk> and map @-@ <unk> , were relicensed so that OpenBSD could continue to use them . Also removed during this audit was all software produced by Daniel J. Bernstein . At the time , Bernstein requested that all modified versions of his code be approved by him prior to redistribution , a requirement to which OpenBSD developers were unwilling to devote time or effort . 
 Because of licensing concerns , the OpenBSD team has re @-@ implemented software from scratch or adopted suitable existing software . Of particular note is the development , after license restrictions were imposed on IPFilter , of the pf packet filter , which first appeared in OpenBSD 3 @.@ 0 and is now available in other major BSDs . OpenBSD developers have also replaced GPL licensed tools ( such as <unk> , <unk> and pkg @-@ <unk> ) with BSD licensed equivalents . 
 = = Funding = = 
 Although the operating system and its portable components are used in commercial products , de Raadt says that little of the funding for the project comes from the industry : " traditionally all our funding has come from user donations and users buying our CDs ( our other products don 't really make us much money ) . Obviously , that has not been a lot of money . " 
 For a two @-@ year period in the early 2000s , the project received DARPA funding , which " paid the salaries of 5 people to work completely full @-@ time , bought about $ <unk> in hardware , and paid for 3 <unk> . " 
 In 2006 , de Raadt expressed concern about the asymmetry of funding : " I think that contributions should have come first from the vendors , secondly from the corporate users , and thirdly from individual users . But the response has been almost entirely the opposite , with almost a 15 to 1 dollar ratio in favor of the little people . Thanks a lot , little people ! " However , since 2014 several large contributions to the OpenBSD Foundation have come from corporations such as Microsoft , Facebook , and Google as well as the Core Infrastructure Initiative . 
 In 2006 , the OpenBSD Project experienced financial danger . The Mozilla Foundation and GoDaddy are among the organizations that helped the OpenBSD Project to overcome its financial troubles . 
 On 14 January 2014 , Bob Beck issued a request for funding to cover electrical costs . If sustainable funding was not found , Beck suggested the OpenBSD Project would shut down . The project soon received a US $ 20 @,@ 000 donation from Mircea Popescu , the Romanian creator of the <unk> <unk> stock exchange , paid in <unk> . The project raised US $ 150 @,@ 000 in response to the appeal , enabling it to pay its bills and securing its short @-@ term future . 
 = = Security and code auditing = = 
 Shortly after OpenBSD 's creation , de Raadt was contacted by a local security software company named Secure Networks ( SNI ) . They were developing a " network security auditing tool " called <unk> , which was intended to find and attempt to exploit possible software security flaws . This coincided with de Raadt 's own interest in security , so for a time the two cooperated , a relationship that was of particular usefulness leading up to the release of OpenBSD 2 @.@ 3 and helped to define security as the focal point of the project . 
 OpenBSD includes features designed to improve security , such as : 
 secure alternatives to POSIX functions in the C standard library , e.g. , <unk> and <unk> 
 toolchain alterations , including a static bounds checker 
 memory protection techniques to guard against invalid accesses , such as <unk> and the W ^ X page protection feature 
 strong cryptography and randomization 
 To reduce the risk of a vulnerability or <unk> allowing privilege escalation , many programs have been written or adapted to make use of privilege separation , privilege revocation and <unk> . Privilege separation is a technique , pioneered on OpenBSD and inspired by the principle of least privilege , where a program is split into two or more parts , one of which performs privileged operations and the other — almost always the bulk of the code — runs without privilege . Privilege revocation is similar and involves a program performing any necessary operations with the privileges it starts with then dropping them . <unk> involves restricting an application to one section of the file system , prohibiting it from accessing areas that contain private or system files . Developers have applied these features to OpenBSD versions of many common applications , such as <unk> , file , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 OpenBSD developers were instrumental in the creation and development of OpenSSH , which is developed in the OpenBSD CVS repositories . OpenSSH is based on the original SSH . It first appeared in OpenBSD 2 @.@ 6 and is now by far the most popular SSH client and server , available on many operating systems . 
 The project has a policy of continually auditing source code for problems , work that developer Marc Espie has described as " never finished ... more a question of process than of a specific bug being hunted . " He went on to list several typical steps once a bug is found , including examining the entire source tree for the same and similar issues , " try [ ing ] to find out whether the documentation ought to be amended " , and investigating whether " it 's possible to augment the compiler to warn against this specific problem . " 
 The default install is quite minimal , which the project states is to ensure novice users " do not need to become security experts overnight " , which fits with open @-@ source and code auditing practices argued to be important elements of a security system . 
 = = = Alleged FBI backdoor investigated = = = 
 On 11 December 2010 , Gregory Perry , a former technical consultant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , emailed de Raadt alleging that the FBI had paid some OpenBSD ex @-@ developers 10 years previously to insert backdoors into the OpenBSD Cryptographic Framework . De Raadt made the email public on 14 December by forwarding it to the <unk> @-@ tech mailing list and suggested an audit of the <unk> codebase . De Raadt 's response was skeptical of the report and he invited all developers to independently review the relevant code . In the weeks that followed , bugs were fixed but no evidence of backdoors were found . De Raadt stated " I believe that <unk> was probably contracted to write backdoors as alleged . If those were written , I don 't believe they made it into our tree . They might have been deployed as their own product . " 
 = = = Slogan = = = 
 The OpenBSD website features a prominent reference to the security record of the default installation . Until June 2002 , the wording read " Five years without a remote hole in the default install ! " An OpenSSH bug was then discovered that made it possible for a remote attacker to gain root privileges in OpenBSD and in any of the other systems running OpenSSH at the time . It was quickly fixed , as is normal with known security holes . The slogan was changed to " One remote hole in the default install , in nearly 6 years ! " In 2007 , a network @-@ related remote vulnerability was found , which was also quickly fixed . The quote was subsequently altered to " Only two remote holes in the default install , in a heck of a long time ! " As of July 2016 , the wording remains .

 The name OpenBSD refers to the fact that OpenBSD 's source code is freely available on the Internet . It also refers to the wide range of hardware platforms the operating system supports . 
 OpenBSD is freely available in various ways : the source can be retrieved by anonymous CVS , and binary releases and development snapshots can be downloaded by FTP , HTTP , and <unk> . <unk> CD @-@ ROM sets can be ordered online for a small fee , complete with an assortment of stickers and a copy of the release 's theme song . These , with their artwork and other bonuses , are one of the project 's few sources of income , funding hardware , Internet service , and other expenses . 
 In common with other operating systems , OpenBSD provides a package management system for easy installation and management of programs which are not part of the base operating system . Packages are binary files which are extracted , managed and removed using the package tools . On OpenBSD , the source of packages is the ports system , a collection of <unk> and other infrastructure required to create packages . In OpenBSD , the ports and base operating system are developed and released together for each version : this means that the ports or packages released with , for example , 4 @.@ 6 are not suitable for use with 4 @.@ 5 and vice versa . 
 OpenBSD at first used the BSD daemon mascot . A specialized version of the daemon , the haloed daemon was drawn by Erick Green . Green was asked by de Raadt to create the logo for the 2 @.@ 3 and 2 @.@ 4 versions of OpenBSD . At first , it was planned to create a full daemon , including head and body , but Green was only able to complete the head part for OpenBSD 2 @.@ 3 . The body as well as pitchfork and tail was completed for OpenBSD 2 @.@ 4 . Subsequent releases saw variations , such as Cop daemon by Ty <unk> , but eventually settling on Puffy , described as a pufferfish . Since then Puffy has appeared on OpenBSD promotional material and featured in release songs and artwork . The promotional material of early OpenBSD releases did not have a cohesive theme or design , but later the CD @-@ ROMs , release songs , posters and tee @-@ shirts for each release have been produced with a single style and theme , sometimes contributed to by Ty <unk> of the Plaid Tongued Devils . These have become a part of OpenBSD advocacy , with each release expounding a moral or political point important to the project , often through parody . Past themes have included : in OpenBSD 3 @.@ 8 , the Hackers of the Lost RAID , a parody of Indiana Jones linked to the new RAID tools featured as part of the release ; The Wizard of OS , making its debut in OpenBSD 3 @.@ 7 , based on the work of Pink Floyd and a parody of The Wizard of Oz related to the project 's recent work on wireless card drivers ; and OpenBSD 3 @.@ 3 's Puff the Barbarian , including an 80s rock @-@ style song and parody of Conan the Barbarian , alluding to open documentation .

Schwimmer enrolled in a drama class , where he appeared in stage productions . Encouraged by his school drama teacher to further his acting , he flew to Chicago for an acting workshop . He noted that the experience was both " enlightening and exhilarating " . In 1984 , Schwimmer graduated from Beverly Hills High and wanted to go straight into acting , but his parents insisted he go to college first so he would have something to fall back on .

 In 1994 , Schwimmer was cast as Ross Geller in NBC 's situation comedy Friends , a series that revolved around a group of friends who live near each other in Manhattan . He played a hopeless @-@ romantic paleontologist who works at a museum and later becomes a professor at a university . Schwimmer initially turned down the role as Ross , but accepted afterwards . Executive producer Kevin S. Bright said that he had previously worked with Schwimmer , the character of Ross was written with him in mind , and he was the first actor cast . Schwimmer based Ross on Nicolas Cage 's role of Charlie from the 1986 film Peggy Sue Got Married . The show debuted on September 22 , 1994 , and was watched by almost 22 million American viewers . Friends quickly developed a loyal audience , with the show and Schwimmer receiving strong reviews . The Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette was complimentary of Schwimmer , calling him " terrific " . Variety 's television reviewer , said : " All six of the principals , especially ( Courteney ) Cox and Schwimmer , appear resourceful and display sharp sitcom skills " . For this performance , he earned an Emmy Award nomination in the category of Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series in 1995 . 
 Schwimmer starred in his first leading film role in the 1996 romantic comedy film , The Pallbearer with Gwyneth Paltrow . In the film , Schwimmer plays a man asked to deliver the eulogy for a high school friend he cannot remember , and begins an affair with the friend 's mother . Critics dismissed The Pallbearer as a poor imitation of the 1967 film The Graduate . Variety 's film reviewer complimented the actor , writing that he had enjoyed his performance , stating that he displayed " a winning , if rather deadpan , personality along with good comic timing " . It also concluded that Schwimmer had a " promising <unk> future " . Janet Maslin of The New York Times cited that his first film " <unk> him to a drab role " . When asked why he decided to accept the role , Schwimmer admitted the decision was to " make an effort to find roles that are as far away from the character of Ross as possible " . He was offered a role to star alongside Tommy Lee Jones in the 1997 science @-@ fiction comedy Men in Black , but turned it down in favor of starring in The Pallbearer , explaining , " This is an opportunity to grow rather than go for the quick cash " . 
 His next film roles in 1998 were Kissing a Fool , Six Days Seven Nights , and Apt Pupil . In Kissing a Fool , a romantic comedy , Schwimmer played Max , a dapper , smart @-@ mouthed ladies ' man . Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote , " Fans of the sitcom Friends may be surprised by David Schwimmer in Kissing a Fool . [ ... ] Take it from someone who has never seen Friends and comes at Schwimmer with no preconceptions : He does just fine . As a TV sports reporter in Kissing a Fool , he oozes the command and self @-@ satisfaction of a young , successful man " . The film was critically and financially unsuccessful . In Six Days Seven Nights , he played the boyfriend of Anne Heche 's character . In Apt Pupil , adapted from a novella of the same name by Stephen King , he had a supporting role as a school guidance counselor . " I was scared of the part " , Schwimmer said , " but I wanted to be part of the movie " . At the time , he noted it was a " little frustrating " that people would typecast him due to his role on Friends . He subsequently appeared opposite Woody Allen and Sharon Stone in Alfonso <unk> 's straight @-@ to @-@ cable comedy Picking Up the Pieces ( 2000 ) . 
 In 2001 , Schwimmer played Captain Herbert M. Sobel in Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks ' HBO World War II miniseries Band of Brothers . The television miniseries is based on the book of the same title written by historian and biographer Stephen Ambrose . Although Band of Brothers was met with largely positive reception , Schwimmer 's performance was criticized ; the BBC News concluded , " Part of the problem ... may have been the ridiculous fact that Friends favourite David Schwimmer plays the hard and cruel Captain Herbert Sobel . The only thing believable about Schwimmer 's acting is when he cowers in the face of true battle . His puppy dog eyes make him appear even more pitiful " . Later that year he portrayed Yitzhak Zuckerman in the war drama Uprising , based on the true events of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943 . 
 In March 2004 , Schwimmer appeared as himself on HBO 's comedy series Curb Your Enthusiasm . During the lengthy run of Friends , Schwimmer directed ten of the show 's episodes . The show 's tenth and final season ended on May 6 , 2004 .

 After Friends , Schwimmer starred in the 2005 independent drama Duane Hopwood , as the title character , who is an alcoholic whose life is spiraling downward rapidly after a divorce and is looking to turn his life around . The film received ambivalent reviews . Despite the reception , Schwimmer 's performance was favored by critics ; Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times reported that the role was Schwimmer 's " career @-@ transforming performance " . Duane Hopwood was screened at a special presentation at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival . Furthermore , in the same year he voiced Melman , a hypochondriac giraffe , in the computer animated film Madagascar ( 2005 ) . The Washington Post noted that Schwimmer is particularly appealing as Melman . Despite the mixed response from critics , the film was a commercial success , earning US $ 532 million worldwide , making it one of the biggest hits of 2005 . 
 Schwimmer starred on the London stage in May 2005 , with Catherine Tate , Lesley Manville , Sara Powell , and Saffron Burrows , in Neil LaBute 's Some Girl ( s ) at the Gielgud Theatre . In the production , he plays a teacher who is ready to settle down and marry , but decides to visit four ex @-@ girlfriends first . For his performance , Schwimmer received critical reviews . The Independent wrote that Schwimmer " is not called upon to extend his range nearly as far as one might have expected in Some Girl ( s ) . [ ... ] Schwimmer remains bland , competent , and boyish — though not fatally boyish in the manner that appears to have turned these women on " . However , Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph praised Schwimmer , reporting he " proves inspired casting . He takes to the stage with ... his endearing <unk> seems designed to ensure our continued sympathy . Schwimmer mercilessly lays bare his character 's opportunism , casual cruelties , and chronic self @-@ deception " . 
 In 2006 , he made his Broadway debut in Herman Wouk 's two @-@ act play The Caine Mutiny Court @-@ Martial . Schwimmer played the role of Lieutenant Barney Greenwald in the production , which was directed by Jerry <unk> . In an interview with New York magazine , he revealed that he had wanted to try Broadway , however said " a couple of things came up that just never quite felt right . Either because I liked the play but wasn ’ t hot on the director , or there was another star attached that I wasn 't jazzed about working with " . He further added that when showed a copy of Wouk 's novel " ... I was shocked at how good the writing was " . His next film role was in the 2006 black comedy Big Nothing , in which he played a bitter , unemployed scientist . 
 Schwimmer made his directorial feature debut in the 2007 British comedy film Run Fatboy Run . The film stars Simon Pegg as a man who signs up for a marathon ( he is out of shape ) to convince his former fiancée and five @-@ year @-@ old son that he has turned his life around . When asked why he decided to direct the film , Schwimmer said : " As a director , I was struck by the challenge that I thought the script presented , which was that it was kind of three films in one . You had some great , big physical comedy , and I thought funny dialogue and characters . And then there was some real emotion to it with the relationship between the father and the son and the romance aspect " . Run Fatboy Run garnered mixed reception , with the New York Daily News rating it one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of five stars and writing , " Most disappointing is how Schwimmer — who spent 10 seasons on a sitcom filled with <unk> characters — manages to bumble ' Fatboy 's ' tender moments " . USA Today , however , was favorable towards Schwimmer , reporting he possesses filmmaking finesse " having wisely chosen strong comic material for his debut behind the camera " . For his directorial work , he was nominated for a British Independent Film Award in the category of Best Debut Director .

The film earned US $ 603 million at the international box office . Schwimmer took part in directing in @-@ studio segments for Little Britain USA , an American spinoff of the British BBC television series Little Britain . In regard to this , he commented that he had " a good time directing episodes " for the show . 
 In October 2008 , Schwimmer made his Off @-@ Broadway directorial debut in Fault Lines at the Cherry Lane Theatre in New York . The production won a mixed review from the Los Angeles Times , which wrote : " Based on Fault Lines ... we can 't really tell whether Schwimmer has much talent as a director . We 're surprised he didn 't try something more challenging for his debut . If not much else , Schwimmer has encouraged his actors to intense their energy levels and comic timing at all costs " . The New York Post , however , noted that Schwimmer " knows a thing or two about freewheeling banter ... and for a good while the play crackles with terrific dialogue , expertly delivered " . In February 2009 , he returned to theater in a Chicago production of Thornton Wilder 's three @-@ act play Our Town as George Gibbs at the Lookingglass Theatre . " Schwimmer ... turns in a poignant , richly textured and demonstrably heartfelt performance as George Gibbs . I 've seen a fair bit of Schwimmer 's post @-@ Friends stage work in London and New York , and I 've never seen him better " , commented the Chicago Tribune . 
 On August 2 , 2009 , Schwimmer played himself in the sixth season of the HBO television series , Entourage .
