 Facing the eighth @-@ seeded Los Angeles Kings in the opening round of the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs , Luongo started the first two games and played well but his team lost both . Vigneault opted to start Schneider for the rest of the series , in order to give the Canucks some momentum , and Luongo remained on the bench for the remainder of the series as the Kings won four games to one . Dressing as a backup for the Canucks ' final three playoff games led many in the media to believe that Luongo would be traded in the off @-@ season , in favour of Schneider , who recorded better regular season and playoff statistics than him in 2011 – 12 . Asked about his role with the Canucks following the defeat , Luongo told reporters that he would waive his no @-@ trade clause if management asked him to . In June 2012 , Schneider was signed to a three @-@ year $ 12 million contract , which made Luongo expendable , but general manager Mike Gillis ' efforts to trade Luongo were unsuccessful due to his $ 64 million ( U.S. ) , 12 @-@ year contract . 
 In the lockout @-@ shortened 2012 – 13 NHL season , both goaltenders split the playing duties although Schneider was the number one goalie . Luongo handled his demotion with class and remained supportive of Schneider , soon calling the Canucks " Cory 's team . " Head coach Alain Vigneault said " Cory is our MVP and one of reasons why we got into playoffs . I 've got a lot of faith in him and that 's why we 're going with him " . In the opening playoff round facing the San Jose Sharks , as Schneider had been injured near the end of the regular season , Luongo started the first two games and played well but his team lost both . Luongo came off the bench in game three after Schneider was pulled in the third period . Luongo was the backup in game four as the Canucks lost in overtime , ending his team 's postseason in four straight games . Luongo put his penthouse up for sale , as it was accepted that he had played his final game as a Canuck . Although he had nine years left on a 12 @-@ year , $ 64 @-@ million contract , which represented a $ 5 @.@ 33 million salary cap hit , general manager Mike Gillis remained confident of making a deal in the summer . 
 Surprisingly , Schneider was traded to the New Jersey Devils on June 30 , 2013 , reinstating Luongo in the starting position for the 2013 – 14 NHL season . John Tortorella , who had replaced Alain Vigneault as Canucks head coach after the conclusion of the 2012 @-@ 13 season , chose rookie Eddie <unk> to start in goal instead of Luongo in the Heritage Classic against the Ottawa Senators at BC Place . Tortorella 's decision was unpopular with the crowd as they booed <unk> , while Luongo was also unhappy as he had been looking forward to that game all season .

 On March 4 , 2014 , a day before the NHL trade deadline , Luongo was traded back to the Florida Panthers along with prospect Steven Anthony in exchange for goaltender Jacob <unk> and centre Shawn Matthias . The Canucks retain part of Luongo 's salary . Luongo is seen as key to helping build the Panthers into a strong contender . 
 The Panthers won their division during the 2015 – 16 season and returned to the playoffs for the second time in 16 years , due in part to Luongo 's strong play . On March 14 , 2016 Luongo was announced as the starter for the Panthers first game of the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs , taking place the same night . 
 = = International career = = 
 Luongo made his international debut at the 1995 World U @-@ 17 Hockey Challenge in Moncton , New Brunswick , with Team Québec , winning bronze . Three years later , he was named to the Canadian national junior team for the 1998 World Junior Championships in Finland . He played backup to Victoriaville Tigres goaltender Mathieu Garon , going winless in three appearances with a 3 @.@ 70 GAA , as Canada finished in eighth place . Luongo became the starting goaltender the following year at the 1999 World Junior Championships in Winnipeg , Manitoba , appearing in seven of Canada 's eight games . He recorded a shutout in the first game of the tournament against the Czech Republic , making 36 saves in a 0 – 0 tie . He went on to help Team Canada to the gold medal game against Russia , but lost in overtime , surrendering a goal to Artem <unk> . With a 1 @.@ 92 GAA and two shutouts , Luongo was given Best Goaltender and All @-@ Star Team honours . 
 Luongo first appeared with the Canadian men 's team at the 2001 World Championships in Germany . He played backup to Fred Brathwaite of the Calgary Flames before injuring his finger during the first game of the qualification round against Switzerland on May 4 , 2001 . Luongo returned home to Florida , as Vancouver Canucks goaltender Dan Cloutier replaced him , ending his tournament debut with a 1 @.@ 44 GAA in two games . Canada finished in fifth place . 
 During his next appearance at the 2003 World Championships in Finland , Luongo began the tournament as backup to the Phoenix Coyotes ' Sean Burke . He earned wins against Latvia in the preliminaries and Switzerland in the qualifying round . During the semifinals against the Czech Republic , Luongo replaced Burke after he left the game with a lower @-@ body injury eight minutes into the second period . Luongo allowed four goals in relief , but earned the win as Canada defeated the Czechs 8 – 4 . With Burke still out for the gold medal game , Luongo made 49 saves against Sweden in a 3 – 2 overtime win . Despite Luongo 's medal round efforts , Burke was named the Best Goaltender for the tournament , as he played in the majority of Team Canada 's games . The gold @-@ medal winning 2003 team was later named the Canadian Press national sports team of the year on January 2 , 2004 . 
 Luongo made his third appearance at the World Championships in 2004 in the Czech Republic . He played in seven games as the starting goaltender , recording a 2 @.@ 32 GAA and one shutout , as Canada captured its second straight gold medal at the tournament , beating Sweden 5 – 3 in the final . Several months later , Luongo competed for Team Canada in the 2004 World Cup as backup to Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils . It marked Luongo 's first international tournament in which all NHL players were eligible , as the annual World Championships conflict with the Stanley Cup playoffs . He had another opportunity to step in for the starting goalie when Brodeur pulled himself out prior to the semi @-@ final game against the Czech Republic due to a sprained wrist . Filling in for Brodeur , Luongo made 37 of 40 stops in a 4 – 3 overtime victory to put Team Canada into the finals against Finland . Brodeur returned for the championship game to backstop Team Canada to a 3 – 2 win . 
 Luongo appeared in his fourth World Championships in 2005 . Due to the 2004 – 05 NHL lockout , all NHL players were available for the tournament in Austria , and Luongo played backup to Brodeur . He appeared in two games , including a shutout win against Slovenia in the round @-@ robin . Luongo earned a silver medal as Team Canada was shut out by the Czech Republic 3 – 0 in the final . 
 Luongo was named to his first Winter Olympics in 2006 . The tournament was held in Turin , Italy , his country of cultural origin . He again played behind Brodeur and appeared in two games . He made his Olympic debut in the second game of the round @-@ robin with a 5 – 1 win against Germany . His second appearance of the tournament was a loss to Finland , also in the round @-@ robin . Team Canada had entered the tournament as the defending gold medal champions from the 2002 Winter Olympics , but were eliminated facing Russia in the quarter @-@ finals and finished in seventh place . 
 Leading up to the 2010 Winter Olympics , to be held in Luongo 's NHL hometown of Vancouver , Luongo and Brodeur were considered locks to be named to the national team heading into the summer orientation camp in August 2009 and speculation began as to who would be appointed the starting position . On December 31 , 2009 , Luongo was selected to Team Canada , along with Brodeur and Marc @-@ Andre Fleury of the Pittsburgh Penguins as the three goaltenders . Luongo was given the start for the first game against Norway . He recorded his first Olympic shutout , making 15 saves in an 8 – 0 win to open the tournament . After Brodeur surrendered four goals in a 5 – 3 loss to the United States in their final preliminary game , Luongo replaced him as the starting goalie . He helped Canada to four consecutive single @-@ elimination game wins against Germany , Russia , Slovakia and the United States to capture the gold medal . During the semifinal against Slovakia , Luongo made a game @-@ saving stop against Canucks teammate Pavol Demitra with nine seconds to go in regulation . With Slovakia 's goaltender pulled and down by a goal , the puck bounced to Demitra by the side of the net . Out of position , Luongo managed to get his glove on the puck , deflecting it away from the net and preserving the win . In the subsequent gold medal game , Luongo made 34 saves in Canada 's overtime win against the United States . 
 The following month , Luongo carried the torch into Robson Square in Downtown Vancouver for the 2010 Paralympics on March 11 , 2010 . 
 Four years later , Luongo was selected to Team Canada for his third straight Olympics . Heading into the Sochi Games as the incumbent starter , there was much debate among the media as to whether he or Montreal Canadiens goaltender Carey Price would play most of Canada 's games . With head coach Mike Babcock electing Price , Luongo received one start in the tournament , a round robin game against Austria , in which he recorded a 6 @-@ 0 shutout . As a backup , earned his second Olympic gold medal , as Canada went on to defeat Sweden in the final 3 @-@ 0 . 
 = = Playing style = = 
 Luongo plays in the butterfly style of goaltending , dropping to his knees with his skates pointing outwards and his pads meeting in the middle in order to cover the bottom portion of the net . Due to the style of play , groin injuries are common for butterfly goalies . Luongo suffered one during the 2008 – 09 season and missed 24 games . 
 An athletic goaltender , Luongo is known for having quick reflexes , particularly with his glove . One of Luongo 's early goaltending coaches , François Allaire , has remembered Luongo to have had the " best catching glove [ he 'd ] ever seen in a kid " when he first came to his goaltending school in Sainte @-@ Thérèse @-@ de @-@ Gaspé , Québec , at the age of 14 . Allaire is known to be a strong proponent of the butterfly style . At 6 feet and 3 inches , Luongo is able to cover a lot of net with his size . Observers also note the strong concentration , competitiveness and mental aspects of his game . On the other hand , his puck @-@ handling skills have been described as a weakness . 
 His style began to be directed during his midget years with Allaire and Montreal @-@ Bourassa goaltending coach Mario Baril . Luongo sent tapes of his play to Allaire during his rookie season in the QMJHL and his former goaltending coach advised him to be more aggressive and come out of the net more to cut off angles and challenge shooters . Later in his NHL career , the Canucks hired a new goaltending coach , Roland Melanson , prior to the 2010 – 11 season . Working with Melanson , Luongo began playing deeper in his crease against Allaire 's original advice , allowing him to maintain positioning for rebounds . The following season , Melanson further tweaked Luongo 's style , encouraging him to extend and elevate his glove after his hand 's usual low positioning was interpreted to have become a weakness . 
 Vancouver Canucks head coach Alain Vigneault has said that Luongo plays best with more playing time over the length of the season . Throughout his career , he has garnered lots of playing time , including four consecutive 70 @-@ game seasons from 2003 – 04 to 2007 – 08 between the Florida Panthers and Canucks . He has been known to suffer from slow starts to the season , usually in the first month of October . In his first three <unk> with the Canucks , Luongo posted a combined 10 – 13 – 0 record and a <unk> save percentage – numbers that are well below his career pace . 
 Luongo is also known for his leadership qualities . He received the Mark Messier Leadership Award in his first season with the Canucks for the month of March 2007 . Prior to his third season with Vancouver , he was named Markus Näslund 's successor as team captain and the first goaltender to be named a captain in 59 years . Teammate Mattias Öhlund , who served as alternate captain to Luongo for one season , described him as a vocal leader , while Luongo has also identified that quality in himself . General manager Mike Gillis described his commitment level as " unprecedented " , adding that " he 'd be a great example for our younger guys " , at the time of the captaincy announcement . He served in that capacity for two seasons before stepping down prior to the 2010 – 11 season . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 While playing with the Florida Panthers , Luongo met his wife , Gina Cerbone , at a team hangout called the Pizza Time <unk> . Gina is the daughter of the Italian restaurant owner , Umberto Cerbone , who is originally from Naples , while Gina 's mother is from Palermo . Luongo proposed to Gina under the Bridge of Sighs in Venice in 2004 . They lived in Broward County , Florida , during his tenure with the Panthers . However within a month of moving into a new home in Florida , Luongo was traded to Vancouver . They subsequently moved into the Vancouver neighbourhood of Yaletown , while spending Luongo 's off @-@ seasons in Fort Lauderdale , Florida . Their first child , Gabriella , was born on March 27 , 2008 . Luongo had been chosen as a starting goaltender for the 2008 NHL All @-@ Star Game , but he chose not to attend in order to be with Gina , who was pregnant with Gabriella at the time and had returned to Florida . On December 27 , 2010 , Gina gave birth to the couple 's second child , Gianni Antonio . 
 Luongo is involved with several charities . Like many Canucks players , he spent time with Canuck Place , a children 's hospice in Vancouver . He also sponsored a spectator 's box in Rogers Arena that is reserved for underprivileged children to attend Canucks games . At the end of games in which he was named one of the three stars , he was known to give away his goalie stick to a fan in the crowd . In the summer of 2009 , he hosted the Roberto Luongo Golf Open to benefit Montreal Children 's Hospital , Sainte @-@ Justine Hospital , and a seniors centre network in Saint @-@ Léonard . 
 In addition to being an avid golfer , Luongo also enjoys playing poker . 
 In September 2011 , Luongo was inducted into the Italian Walk of Fame in Toronto , Ontario .

 = Battle of Corydon = 
 The Battle of Corydon was a minor engagement that took place July 9 , 1863 , just south of Corydon , which had been the original capital of Indiana until 1825 , and was the county seat of Harrison County . The attack occurred during Morgan 's Raid in the American Civil War as a force of 2 @,@ 500 cavalry invaded the North in support of the Tullahoma Campaign . It was the only pitched battle of the Civil War that occurred in Indiana , and no battle has occurred within Indiana since . 
 As news of an impending raid spread across the state , Governor Oliver P. Morton called out the state 's militia force , the Indiana Legion , to defend against the threat . Unaware of the size of the invading army , four companies of the 6th and 8th Regiments of the Legion , totaling about one hundred men , attempted to prevent the Confederates from crossing the Ohio River into Indiana , but were overcome by superior artillery fire , killing two of the defenders . The units retreated northward where they met with the main body of the 6th Regiment under the command of Col. Lewis Jordan . Along with the townspeople , they constructed breastworks that formed a defensive line south of Corydon . Despite promises of reinforcements from regional Legion commanders in New Albany , only about 450 men ( consisting almost entirely of locals ) were defending the town . 
 As the raiders approached from the south , the advance elements formed a battle line and launched a frontal attack and an unsuccessful flanking movement against the east side of the Legion 's works . Reinforcements and artillery soon arrived with the main body of Confederate troops , giving the attackers a strong numerical superiority . With the support of the artillery , a pincer movement caused the Legion to abandon their position to avoid being surrounded . A large part of the Legion were captured as they attempted to escape from the town , while Col. Jordon and others regrouped downtown . Confederates then seized the Legion 's commissary supplies on the edge of town , and fired two warning shots into the downtown from their artillery , convincing Jordan that continued resistance was futile and leading him to surrender his force and Corydon . Although the short battle cost the cavalry twice as many casualties as the outnumbered militia units , the battle resulted in a Confederate victory , which enabled Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan to secure supplies and money before continuing his raid through Indiana and into Ohio . The delay , however , proved critical in helping the pursuing Union army overtake and later capture Morgan and his forces . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Following the 1862 Newburgh Raid into Indiana , the federal government had put a regiment of regular cavalry troops in south central Indiana for defensive purposes . After patrolling the border for several months , no new raids materialized , and they were withdrawn in March 1863 , leaving only the local militia for defense . 
 = = = Advance through Kentucky = = = 
 On June 23 , 1863 , Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan led a cavalry division consisting of two brigades , totaling nearly 2 @,@ 500 men , and two batteries of artillery , northward from Tennessee in the Confederacy . His movements began as a ride into Kentucky to disrupt the communications of the Union Army of the Cumberland in support of Gen. Braxton Bragg 's Army of Tennessee during the Tullahoma Campaign . Bragg had ordered Morgan to attack any settlements of his choosing in Kentucky , but not to cross the Ohio River into Union territory . Bragg was worried about Morgan getting too far from the main army and being unable to come to his aid should it be needed . Morgan was already planning to disregard the orders and had sent scouts beyond the river before leaving Tennessee . Crossing the Cumberland River at <unk> , Kentucky , Morgan 's column advanced to the Green River , where it was deflected by a Union regiment at Tebbs Bend on July 4 . Morgan surprised and captured the garrison of Lebanon , and then rode northward via Springfield , Bardstown and <unk> . 
 Morgan had his men tap the Union telegraph lines and send conflicting reports about his strength and destination . Most Union officials believed his target was Louisville , Kentucky . Not taking any chances , Governor of Indiana Oliver P. Morton telegraphed orders calling out all of the state 's militia , the Indiana Legion , south of the National Road . 
 In the afternoon of July 7 an advance force of Confederates entered Brandenburg , Kentucky , where they rendezvoused with Capt. Thomas Hines , who assumed command . Hines had led a reconnaissance mission into Indiana in search of Confederate sympathizers to support Morgan 's coming raid . He did not find the support he was looking for , and had been pursued by elements of the 6th and 8th Regiment of the Indiana Legion who killed three of his men and captured several others before the remainder escaped back into Kentucky . Since then he had been waiting in the Brandenburg area for Morgan to arrive . The Ohio River was swollen from recent rain , making any hope of fording it impossible and requiring that the Confederates secure boats to ferry their men across . Under Hines ' guidance , the Confederates set an ambush to capture the steamship John T. McCombs as it landed in Brandenburg to deliver the mail . The one ship would not be enough to allow the Confederate division to quickly cross the river , so to capture another boat the McCombs was used to simulate a distress call to lure in the fast sidewheel steamer Alice Dean . As the unsuspecting ship moved alongside the McCombs , the Confederates on board sprung out , lashed the two ships together , and boarded the Alice Dean . Taking the two ships back to shore , they released the crew and passengers just as Morgan arrived with the main body of the army . Some of the passengers escaped the town and sent message to commanders in Louisville of the Confederate occupation of Brandenburg . 
 = = = Battle of Brandenburg Crossing = = = 
 Indiana militia leaders learned of Morgan 's capture of Brandenburg , ten miles south of Corydon , and his intent to cross into Indiana in a dispatch from Regular Army commanders in Louisville . All the roads Morgan would likely take northward intersected at Corydon . Emergency requests for reinforcements were sent out from the town in all directions . New Albany leaders sent word promising to send a thousand men . Other companies around Harrison County immediately began to gather and advance to Corydon . Three companies of the 6th Regiment Indiana Legion based in Mauckport and totaling about one hundred men moved to Morvin 's Landing , the north bank of the river opposite Brandenburg , to contest the crossing . A thirty @-@ man company of the 8th Regiment of the Indiana Legion based in Leavenworth and under the command of Capt. G.W. Lyon , was transported to Morvin 's landing by the Lady Pike during the night . They brought with them their town 's ceremonial 8 @-@ pound cannon which they deployed and camouflaged on a small bluff in front of an abandoned log cabin . 
 On the morning of July 8 , Lyon opened fire on the Alice Dean , intending to destroy or disable the steamers . The men had only ever fired the cannon at celebratory events and were unsure how to aim it properly . Two shots were fired , with the second one hitting the upper deck of the McCombs , passing through the ship and landing near a group of men on the shore , wounding a Confederate . Just as the shelling began Provost Marshal John Timberlake arrived on the scene from Corydon with a small company of reinforcements and assumed command . Timberlake , who was a colonel in the regular army , believed Morgan 's force was small , and decided to spare the steamships and instead shell the massed cavalry . Before the cannon could be re @-@ aimed , the superior Confederate artillery was set up and returned fire from their significantly higher position on the opposite side of the river . The dense morning fog in the valley obliged the Confederates to guess at their target . Their first shot landed short of the Legion 's position , and the second shot landed behind them and leveled the cabin . The Legion defenders set off a third shot that had already been loaded into their cannon , and fled into a nearby forest . As they moved up the ridge and into the woods , they became visible to the Confederate artillery who began to shell the forest . One shot struck a log where two of the defenders had stopped to rest . They were mortally wounded while the rest fled into the forest as the Confederates continued to shell the landing . 
 With the resistance seemingly at an end , Morgan began crossing his troops in the captured steamers . The first company to land moved up the ridge on the north shore and engaged the Legion defenders in a skirmish . Union commanders in Louisville had sent out requests for naval support in preventing Morgan 's crossing when they first received reports from Brandenburg . The <unk> Springfield , armed with six 24 @-@ pound howitzers , was at New Albany and was dispatched down @-@ river and arrived on the scene just after Morgan had begun to ferry his force across the river . The Springfield opened fire on Morgan 's two steamers who retreated back under the covering fire of the Confederate artillery . The ship began shelling both the north and south shores of the river , firing at least fifty shells into Brandenburg , damaging several buildings and killing three horses . Morgan 's forces took cover in nearby forests while the armed steamer and the artillery on the shore dueled for about an hour . Once the Springfield ran out of ammunition she withdrew , allowing Morgan to resume the crossing . 
 After about half of his army had been ferried into Indiana , the Union gunboat USS Elk and an armed private ship , the Grey Eagle , arrived on the scene . The Elk fired a shot into the deck of the Alice Dean as it tried to escape to the shoreline . Both of the Union ships were wooden , and as the Confederate artillery opened fire , they quickly retreated upriver towards Louisville to avoid being destroyed . The crossing resumed again . In total , it took seventeen hours for Morgan to ferry his now 2 @,@ 000 men and supplies across the river . By listening in on the telegraph , he learned that Brig. Gen. Edward H. Hobson with a force of 4 @,@ 000 cavalry was advancing on his position from the south . The lead elements of the Union force arrived in Brandenburg at about 8 : 00 pm , where the Confederate rearguard was able to delay their advance long enough for Morgan 's artillery to be carried across the river . On the last trip across , most of the rearguard was able to escape , but several were left behind and captured . 
 Once the Confederates had crossed the river , the Alice Dean was set ablaze and sunk in the river between Morvin 's landing and Mauckport to deny the Union pursuers use of the vessel and to block the landing , making their crossing more difficult . Morgan ordered the McCombs to be burnt , but Col. Duke countermanded the order because of his friendship with its captain . He was allowed to return with his ship to Louisville unharmed . Gen. Hobson and the main body of the Union cavalry arrived in Brandenburg at about 10 : 15 pm , just as the Alice Dean went under the water . He set up his artillery and fired several shots at the Confederates who jeered at him from the opposite side of the river ; they quickly withdrew out of range of his guns . The lead elements of the cavalry had already set out northward following the Legion forces who withdrew gradually and fought delaying skirmishes along the Mauckport road to slow the cavalry 's advance towards Corydon . 
 = = Battle = = 
 = = = Skirmishes = = = 
 During the evening , elements of Morgan 's army had advanced to within five miles ( 8 km ) of Corydon . The four Legion companies that had attempted to prevent the crossing had been reinforced by four additional companies from Corydon , one from Elizabeth , and one from New Amsterdam , making the force about four @-@ hundred strong . They lured a company of unsuspecting Confederates into an ambush where they were surrounded ; sixteen were captured and taken to the Corydon jail . The invaders also successfully captured about thirty defenders in several skirmishes . They were rounded up and held in a school house near Laconia . After Morgan crossed the river he addressed the prisoners and told them that if they would promise to go home and not return to arms , he would allow them to leave and keep their guns . They all agreed and were released . 
 That night Morgan 's men camped at Frakes ' Mill just north of Mauckport . They found the area deserted , as all the civilians had fled their homes . In the house where Morgan stayed , the table was set with supper which he and his men ate before resting for the night . Morgan 's men tapped the telegraph lines again and began sending false reports that they were headed for New Albany . The disinformation dissuaded New Albany 's Legion leaders from sending the large number of reinforcements to Corydon that they had been organizing . The next morning the Confederates resumed their march northward . As they passed up a county road , a shot was fired killing a soldier . The scouts opened fired on a nearby house from which they assumed the shot had come , killing a Lutheran minister and wounding his son . 
 Corydon was the county seat of Harrison County and the former capital of Indiana . The town and immediate countryside had about one thousand inhabitants . The townspeople had been working all night building a breastwork of criss @-@ crossed logs on a high ridge just south of the town . A pair of Confederate spies had already infiltrated Corydon and reported their findings back to Morgan . As the works were completed , the Legion fell back to the town to take up position behind them . Many older men in the town joined in the defense , swelling their numbers to about 450 . Despite the emergency calls for reinforcements to the regional Legion commanders in New Albany , none of their men arrived before the battle began

 The Legion 's barricade was between four and five feet high ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) and stretched 2 @,@ 500 feet ( 760 m ) from the Amsterdam Road on the far western wing to the Laconia Road on the far eastern wing and straddled the Mauckport Road in the center . The 6th Regiment of the Indiana Legion was commanded by the elderly Col. Lewis Jordan , a veteran of the War of 1812 . Maj. <unk> , a lieutenant in the Regular Army and recently returning from the war front , was given command of the west wing . Capt. George Lahue , a veteran of the Mexican @-@ American War , was in command of the east wing . Although the commanders were battle hardened , most of the men behind the works had never seen battle . The western wing was heavily wooded , but the slope of the ground prevented the defenders or the attackers from seeing each other until they were within close range . The eastern wing of the works was in a mostly open field and afforded little natural cover to the attackers , while the defenders were protected from gunfire behind their works . 
 At 11 : 30 a.m. on July 9 , the 3rd Regiment Kentucky Cavalry , the advance element of the Confederate forces under the command of Col. " Stovepipe " Johnson , was sighted moving north along the Mauckport Road towards Corydon . Col. Johnson believed that the artillery could have quickly dispersed the four hundred farmers @-@ turned @-@ soldiers , but Morgan was worried about any delay because during the night the Union forces had begun crossing the river in his rear . Morgan 's main body with the artillery was still en route , and he decided that the Legion should be engaged by the advance forces . 
 By about noon , the Confederates had formed an attack line and were in position to advance on the works . Because of the forest on the west side of the Mauckport Road , a company of men dismounted and attacked the works head on . They were repulsed three times , but the Legion suffered a casualty during the second wave . Simultaneously , the Confederates launched a flanking maneuver on the eastern wing of the defensive works . The initial flanking attempt was prevented because of the superior weapons held by the thirty Legion soldiers on that wing . They were equipped with Henry rifles capable of firing fourteen rounds before reloading , and were able to keep the Confederates pinned down in the open field for about twenty minutes . 
 Shortly after the third repulse of the Confederates on the western wing , the 2nd Kentucky and 9th Tennessee regiments arrived from the Mauckport Road and joined the battle , giving the attackers a numerical superiority . At about 12 : 40 p.m. , Capt. Byrnes arrived with the Confederate artillery and used his two ten @-@ pound Parrott rifle cannons to pin down the defenders in the works . In the meantime , Morgan was leading his main body of troops far around the eastern edge of the defenses and up the Plank Road , threatening the town directly and bypassing the defenses entirely . As they moved onto the Corydon Pike , they shot and robbed a toll gate keeper who refused to throw down his gun . 
 = = = Legion rout = = = 
 Using the cannons and one infantry battalion to prevent the defenders from maneuvering , Col. Richard Morgan , the general 's brother , launched a pincer movement in an attempt to surround the Legion units . With the artillery bearing down on the works , the 2nd Kentucky and 9th Tennessee began to flank the Union defense on the east and west sides respectively . Col. Lewis ordered a retreat to prevent the army from being captured . With their superior numbers , the Confederates were able to move around both ends of the Legion 's works and quickly turned the retreat into a rout . The second part of the engagement was over in about twenty @-@ five minutes ; in total the battle lasted about one hour . As the Legion fled into the town , many threw their guns into the Indian Creek to prevent them from being captured by the enemy . About one hundred men attempted to escape by the Corydon Pike , unaware that the main Confederate force was advancing up it , and were captured . 
 A large part of the Legion force , including Col. Jordon , retreated into the downtown . On the western edge of the town , a company of Confederates seized the Legion 's commissary . Morgan took command of the heights south of the town and fired two warning shells from his artillery into Corydon , one landing very near Cedar Glade , now a historic site that keeps a marker at the location where the shot landed . Col. Jordan realized that continued resistance was useless and did not " desire to see the unnecessary loss of life " , and promptly surrendered the town by running up a white flag in the town square . The Legion 's cavalry and the infantrymen who had mounts were able to escape into the countryside , but almost all of the remaining infantry was captured . 
 Accounts vary as to the number of casualties , but the most reliable evidence suggests that Jordan lost four killed , ten to twelve wounded , and 355 captured — about 100 escaped . After the battle , Morgan counted eleven dead and forty wounded among the raiders , plus one killed while advancing on the town . Additionally , three civilians were killed .

 = = = <unk> of Corydon = = = 
 Morgan led his division into Corydon . As the county commissioner exited the courthouse carrying a rifle he was shot dead , becoming the final casualty of the day . Morgan paroled the Legion as if they had been regular soldiers ; their weapons and ammunition were seized or destroyed , and they were required to promise not return to arms for a period of time . The prisoners in the county jail were freed , including the Confederates who had been captured the previous day . The cavalrymen spent the afternoon plundering stores and collecting ransom money ; Morgan threatened to torch three local mills , and demanded each of them pay $ 1 @,@ 000 to prevent their destruction . The owners negotiated the rate down to $ 500 . The county treasurer paid $ 690 to spare the courthouse from being burnt , and two leading stores paid $ 600 each . His men robbed the townspeople freely , stealing items ranging from ice @-@ skates and bonnets to guns and horses . The total amount taken by ransom and plunder was estimated at $ 26 @,@ 450 ( $ 460 @,@ 873 in 2009 chained dollars ) . The value of most of the stolen goods and property destruction was later reimbursed , mostly by the state government . 
 Morgan ate lunch at the Kintner House Inn where he read a newspaper and learned of the Confederate defeat at Gettysburg and the fall of Vicksburg . The news caused him to realize his army was in serious danger ; his hosts later said that upon his reading the paper that he was " noticeably crestfallen " . Morgan had intended to meet up with the Confederate army in Pennsylvania , but with their forces in retreat this was impossible and began to plan for a safe return across the Ohio River . He had his telegrapher tap the telegraph lines and send false messages indicating he was heading for Indianapolis to free Confederate prisoners of war held at Camp Morton . The Confederate dead were buried in unmarked graves on a farm on the western edge of town . Morgan 's wounded were left in the town and were taken into a local Presbyterian church , where they were cared for . The wounded men were paroled after Union troops arrived . Two were taken to the Union army hospital in Jeffersonville , and remained in the town until they were well enough to return home and await their exchange . 
 = = = Continued raid = = = 
 Shortly after looting the town , detachments of raiders left Corydon and continued their raid , scouring the countryside for fresh horses and food . An African American from Corydon was forced to serve as their guide ; he led them for two days before escaping and returning home . By about 6 : 00 pm Morgan and the main body had resumed their march northward , foraging in northern Harrison County before camping a few miles from Corydon , near New Salisbury . They left Harrison County early the next morning heading north . 
 As soon as he learned of the defeat at Corydon , Governor Morton sent a series of telegrams to Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside , commander of the Army of the Ohio , first requesting then demanding the return of two Indiana regiments recently sent to the defense of Louisville , Kentucky . Burnside refused but did order his cavalry to join in the pursuit of Morgan . As Corydon had until recently been capital of Indiana , the defeat was symbolic . The July 10 headline of the Indianapolis Gazetteer screamed " Former Capitol Corydon Ravaged By Morgan 's Raiders ; Two Hoosiers Dead . " 
 More than 150 @,@ 000 men turned out to join Legion units during the next week and began pursuing on Morgan 's cavalrymen . Gen. Hobson and his men arrived in Corydon on July 10 , after crossing the Ohio River from Kentucky . Although a Confederate victory , the Battle of Corydon had delayed Morgan by six crucial hours , allowing the pursuing Union army to begin closing the gap . Union cavalry numbering six thousand men were soon only a few miles behind him . Morgan briefly continued north and raided Salem . He then turned his east to Ohio as his raid turned into flight to escape . He was thwarted at the Battle of Buffington Island , where he tried to cross the Ohio River to safety . Only about 250 of his men were across the river , when Union gunboats brought his attempt to an end . Morgan was later captured at the Battle of <unk> , the furthest north regular Confederates ever reached . 
 Other raids and small skirmishes took place in Indiana during the war , but the Battle of Corydon was the only pitched battle fought in the state . It remains the last military conflict to have occurred in Indiana . In 1976 the site was preserved as the Corydon Battle Site memorial park and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 9 , 1979 . Today it is part of the John Hunt Morgan Heritage Trail . The battle has been re @-@ enacted each year since 1980 .

 = Northrop N @-@ 3PB = 
 The Northrop N @-@ 3PB Nomad was a single @-@ engined American floatplane of the 1940s . Northrop developed the N @-@ 3PB as an export model based on the earlier Northrop A @-@ 17 design . A total of 24 were purchased by Norway , but were not delivered until after the Fall of Norway during the Second World War . Exiled Norwegian forces used them from 1941 , operating from Iceland , for convoy escort , anti @-@ submarine patrols , and training purposes from " Little Norway " in Canada . Within two years of delivery , the design was effectively obsolete in its combat role , and the remaining N @-@ 3PBs were replaced by larger aircraft in 1943 . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 Following increased international tension surrounding the German annexation of the Sudetenland in 1938 , the Norwegian parliament granted extraordinary appropriations to modernize the Norwegian Armed Forces . The Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service ( RNNAS ) and the Norwegian Army Air Service were prioritized for funds from the NOK 50 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 Norwegian Neutrality Fund . The RNNAS ' share of the funds were designated to buy 12 Heinkel He 115 torpedo bombers and 24 reconnaissance aircraft , as well as several new naval air stations . The Dornier Do 22 , Northrop 8 @-@ A , Northrop <unk> and Vultee V @-@ 11 GB were considered and proposals retrieved . The commission quickly decided the Vultee V @-@ 11 GB was the best aircraft to satisfy both air services ' needs . On the part of the Royal Norwegian Air Service , the requirements were for a reconnaissance aircraft with a range of 1 @,@ 500 km , a top speed of no less than 320 km / h and a payload of a 900 kg torpedo or the equivalent in bombs . 
 On 30 December 1939 , Norway sent a purchasing commission to the United States , consisting of a Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service contingent headed by Cmdr. Kristian Østby , and a Norwegian Army Air Service contingent led by Birger F. <unk> . The goal of the commission was to inspect the Vultee V @-@ 11 , which would serve as a new common reconnaissance bomber for the two air services . Amongst the requirements the commission hoped to fill was replacing the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service 's <unk> biplane patrol aircraft . Once in the US , the commission found that Vultee would not be able to deliver the V @-@ 11 within a reasonable amount of time so another aircraft had to be found . <unk> quickly found that the Douglas 8A @-@ 5N would satisfy the NOAAS ' requirements . As the Douglas 8A @-@ 5N could not be fitted with floats , Østby continued to look for an aircraft suitable for the RNNAS . After visits to many of the aviation companies in February 1940 , Østby determined that only one manufacturer had both a design and available production capacity , Northrop Aircraft Incorporated . The commission ordered 24 floatplanes based on the Model 8 @-@ A , renamed the N @-@ 3PB , " off the drawing board " ( literally , the aircraft being ordered prior to the type having flown ) from Northrop on 8 March 1940 , at a total cost of NOK 6 @,@ 550 @,@ 000 to meet this requirement . Half the amount was paid shortly before the German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940 . 
 The Model 8 @-@ A , the export model of the Northrop Attack Bomber series was never intended to serve as the basis of a floatplane and had to be redesigned to meet the requirements of the Norwegian order . The new N @-@ 3PB was the first product of Northrop Aircraft , which had reformed in 1939 , and was a low @-@ winged cantilever monoplane fitted with twin floats . First intended for a lower powered engine , the N @-@ 3PB was ultimately powered by a Wright Cyclone radial engine , of the same type specified for the Douglas 8A @-@ 5N bombers and Curtiss Hawk <unk> @-@ 8s ordered by Norway at the same time , simplifying the eventual maintenance and operation requirements for the entire Norwegian military aircraft fleets . 
 With the Norwegian operation requirements drawn up for a coastal reconnaissance floatplane , a series of modifications were requested to the original design . The changes included a redesign of the float structure to accommodate either a torpedo or bomb load carried under the center fuselage to supplement five underwing bomb racks . Additional armament changes led to a combination of six machine guns replacing the four machine gun ( two fixed forward , two flexible rear @-@ mounted 7 @.@ 9 mm ) / one cannon ( forward facing , fixed 20 mm ) arrangement that was in the initial design . Provision for a rear under @-@ fuselage gun was also made . Further equipment requirements including fitting a rear fuselage @-@ mounted camera as well as changes to instrumentation and radio equipment . 
 Before Northrop could complete any aircraft , Norway was invaded by Germany . The invasion and occupation of Norway necessitated that the armament of the N @-@ 3PB , originally to be installed in Norway , had to be changed . Initial specifications listed one Oerlikon 20 mm cannon in each wing , as well as two 7 @.@ 9 mm Fabrique Nationale machine guns each in both fuselage and rear gunner stations . Owing to the lack of availability of the originally specified armament , Norwegian @-@ manufactured Colt heavy machine guns were substituted with four Colt <unk> .50 cal. machine guns in the wings and two .30 cal . Colt <unk> mounted in dorsal and ventral positions of the gunner 's rear cockpit .

 Northrop 's Chief Test Pilot Vance Breese flew the first N @-@ 3PB ( c / n 301 ) on 22 December 1940 from Lake Elsinore , California . The flight test and customer acceptance trials were successfully completed using the first production aircraft . Due to the use of the more powerful Cyclone engine , all performance estimates were exceeded and flight characteristics including <unk> were considered " excellent . " All 24 aircraft were delivered to the exiled Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service by the end of March 1941 . 
 = = = Training = = = 
 In late February 1941 , six production N @-@ 3PBs were flown to RCAF Station Patricia Bay , Vancouver Island in Canada , one of the Canadian winter bases of the <unk> <unk> ( FTL ) Norwegian training bases known as " Little Norway " . The N @-@ 3PB 's service as an advanced trainer in Canada in the " Little Norway " summer base at Island Harbour , Toronto and winter bases along the western coast of Canada , was relatively brief and ended when it was determined that pilot and air crew graduates were to be integrated into RAF squadrons . Arrangements were made later in 1941 for the advanced flight training of Norwegian pilots to be carried out in RAF and Royal Canadian Air Force schools on types that better fit the transition to combat flying . Consequently , the three surviving N @-@ 3PBs were stored until shipped to Iceland in March 1942 on the steamer Delta . 
 = = = Combat use = = = 
 The remaining 18 N @-@ 3PBs were used to equip No. 330 ( Norwegian ) Squadron RAF in Reykjavík , Iceland . The N @-@ 3PBs sent to Iceland were all shipped across the Atlantic in crates on board the Norwegian steamer <unk> , the voyage from New York to Reykjavik taking 13 days to complete . Part of the reason for deploying the N @-@ 3PBs to Iceland were to avoid having the unusual aircraft operating over the United Kingdom , with the involved risk of friendly fire incidents . 
 No. 330 ( N ) Squadron was declared operational on 25 April 1941 ; the N @-@ 3PBs were erected in a seaplane hangar at Reykjavik , with the first aircraft flying by 2 June 1941 . The squadron flew antisubmarine and convoy escort patrols from 23 June 1941 , with flights based at Reykjavík , Akureyri and Budareyi . While the squadron 's N @-@ 3PBs carried out eight attacks on German U @-@ boats , including one on U @-@ 570 after it had surrendered to the British , no U @-@ boats were sunk . On a number of occasions in 1942 , the N @-@ 3PBs clashed with Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 200 long range reconnaissance bombers and Blohm & Voss BV 138 flying boats , being credited with at least one damaged . On 10 October 1942 , a " Northrop " from Budareyi was involved in a friendly fire incident , attacking a British Lockheed Hudson . The incident ended without any of the aircraft involved being hit . 
 In an effort to publicize the N @-@ 3PB operations , the British Air Ministry circulated a report that two Norwegian @-@ flown aircraft had been involved in the attack on the German battleship Bismarck on 21 – 22 May 1941 , but it was merely an example of wartime propaganda . Despite many aviation historians disputing the claim , it still appears in current accounts of the sinking of the Bismarck . No. 330 ( N ) was formed on 25 April 1941 and received its first of 18 N @-@ 3PBs on 19 May , two days before the attack on the Bismark but didn 't fly until 2 June 1941 and their first official operational flight wasn 't until 23 June 1941 . No. 330 ( N ) Squadron began supplementing the N @-@ 3PBs with Consolidated Catalina flying boats in 1942 , and both the Catalina and the N @-@ 3PB began to be displaced in February 1943 by the arrival of the more capable Short Sunderland . Flying boats allowed for longer patrols to be carried out , and had superior seakeeping qualities to the N @-@ 3PB . The surviving N @-@ 3PBs continued to operate alongside the Catalinas , flying fighter patrol , escort and antisubmarine operations off Iceland 's east coast until early 1943 . Throughout the transition to other types , the squadron 's C @-@ Flight maintained an " all @-@ Northrop " unit , predominately involved in secondary roles including army cooperation , transport , air @-@ sea rescue , ice reconnaissance and ambulance roles . In early 1943 , No. 330 ( N ) ' s crews relocated to Oban , Scotland , aboard the troop ship Leinster . Two of the remaining N @-@ 3PBs flew to Oban . The eight aircraft left behind on Iceland were scrapped in Reykjavik between December 1942 – April 1943 . 
 Throughout its combat service from 23 June 1941 – 30 March 1943 , No. 330 ( N ) ' s N @-@ 3PBs carried out 1 @,@ 1011 operational sorties , totalling 3 @,@ 512 hours flying time . Although the eight attacks they carried out on U @-@ boats proved inconclusive , N @-@ 3PB escort patrols and antisubmarine sweeps were an important part of the Allied effort in keeping the North Atlantic sea lanes open . After the end of the type 's combat service on Iceland , the Norwegian naval authorities considered basing two N @-@ 3PBs on Svalbard , an Arctic archipelago previously known as Spitzbergen . A German naval raid on 8 September 1943 resulted in the deployment being cancelled . 
 = = Accidents and incidents = = 
 During flight training at " Little Norway " , there were several accidents resulting in the death of students and instructors . The FTL lost three N @-@ 3PBs in Canada in fatal crashes , two in British Columbia when the harbour in Toronto was frozen , at RCAF Jericho Beach Flying Boat Station near Vancouver and Patricia Bay , Vancouver Island , along with the aircraft involved in the ferry boat accident at Island Harbour . 
 On 20 June 1941 , while taking off , a N @-@ 3PB collided with the ferry Sam McBride in Port Race , Toronto Harbour , killing both the student pilot and instructor . The Toronto Star newspaper wrote that it was " a matter of time before one of the Norwegian aircraft crashes in the city itself . " This fear , along with it being impractical to have flight training in the same place as the current civil aviation operations , precipitated a move to a new camp in Muskoka , Ontario . At the new location , both elementary and advanced level training could take place , while advanced flight training continued at Toronto Island Airport . 
 No. 330 ( N ) Squadron also had notable accidents and fatalities , including its first operational loss when a N @-@ 3PB on a navigational training flight disappeared over the North Atlantic on 30 July 1941 . Attrition through accidents gradually reduced the squadron 's operational fleet ; N @-@ 3PB ( c / n 311 ) was damaged beyond repair on 16 September 1942 when depth charges accidentally released and detonated while the aircraft was moored at Budareyi . A total of 11 of the " <unk> " were lost with 12 casualties , including the squadron commander Cmdr. Hans Bugge and his crew who failed to return from an antisubmarine sweep on 25 August 1942 . Despite an intensive search , no trace of the aircraft or crew was ever found .

 After the war , two surviving N @-@ 3PBs ( c / n 306 , 322 ) aircraft were flown to Norway , sold for salvage , with c / n 306 being scrapped in 1949 and c / n 322 scrapped in 1956 . 
 After a search through records , Ragnar R. Ragnarsson , then vice president of the Icelandic Aviation Historical Society pinpointed the crash site of N @-@ 3PB ( c / n 320 [ " U " ] ) . In 1979 , the N @-@ 3PB wreck was recovered from the <unk> River in Iceland . Due to bad weather over Iceland 's east coast , the N @-@ 3PB flown by Lt. W.W. <unk> , operating from <unk> and transiting to Reykjavik , made a forced landing on 21 April 1943 . After being stuck in the silt , it gradually sunk to the river 's bottom . 
 US Navy divers began its initial recovery , later aided by a team of volunteer divers from Great Britain , Iceland , Norway and the United States , bringing up the remains that were sent to the Northrop Aircraft Corporation in Hawthorne , California . Restoration was completed by a 300 strong volunteer group , including 14 retired ex @-@ Northrop employees who had been involved in the original N @-@ 3PB production line . The complex restoration required the construction of replacement parts primarily by templating many damaged or corroded original aircraft components in order to create a complete airframe . This only surviving aircraft is currently on exhibition as part of Norwegian Armed Forces Aircraft Collection at Gardermoen , Norway .

 = Liverpool Scottish = 
 The Liverpool Scottish , known <unk> as " the Scottish " , is a unit of the British Army , part of the Army Reserve ( formerly the Territorial Army ) , raised in 1900 as an infantry battalion of the King 's ( Liverpool Regiment ) . The Liverpool Scottish became affiliated to the Queen 's Own Cameron Highlanders in the 1920s and formally transferred to the regiment in 1937 with its identity preserved . Reflecting the Territorial Army 's decline in size since the late 1940s , the battalion was reduced to a company in 1967 , then to a platoon of " A " ( King 's ) Company , King 's and Cheshire Regiment in 1999 . In 2006 , the company was incorporated into the 4th Battalion , Duke of Lancaster 's Regiment ( King 's , Lancashire and Border ) . 
 Service in the First World War was extensive and the Liverpool Scottish was one of the first territorial battalions to arrive on the Western Front when it deployed in November 1914 . Approximately 1 @,@ 000 of more than 10 @,@ 000 men who served with the Scottish died during the war . The first major battle of the Scottish during the war was on 16 June 1915 in what is officially known as " The First Action at Bellewaarde " , which was designed to pin down German reserves while other Allied forces were engaged elsewhere . The action is known to the Liverpool Scottish as the " Battle of Hooge " . Hooge being a village a few miles East of Ypres in Belgium . 
 The unit 's most acclaimed soldier during the war was Captain Noel Godfrey Chavasse , who was awarded two Victoria Crosses while attached from the Royal Army Medical Corps . Sergeant Albert <unk> , Chavasse 's Medical Orderly , is technically the most highly decorated soldier in the history of Liverpool Scottish due to Chavasse 's parent unit actually being the Royal Army Medical Corps ( RAMC ) . <unk> would receive a Distinguished Conduct Medal , and Bar , together with the Military Medal for his actions alongside Chavasse during World War I. Chavasse remains one of only three people to have been awarded the VC twice , and the only recipient from the Liverpool Scottish . 
 Although expanded to two battalions during the Second World War , the Liverpool Scottish did not serve abroad as intact battalions . Instead , contingents were supplied to other battalions and the Army Commandos . With the commandos , the Liverpool Scottish actively served in operations in Europe , including the Norwegian Campaign and the St Nazaire Raid . 
 = = 1900 – 1914 = = 
 There had been a previous attempt to raise a formation of Scots in Liverpool . Heightened tension with France in the late 1850s had provided the impetus for the emergence of the Volunteer movement . Three " Scottish " companies ( one " Highland " and two " Lowland " ) were formed as the 19th ( Liverpool Scottish ) Lancashire Volunteer Rifle Corps , composed predominantly of the middle class . Disputes between members over the use of kilts and the colour of their tartan culminated in the 19th 's fragmentation . By 1861 , four companies of Liverpool Scottish existed within the 19th and 79th Corps . Neither corps survived : the 19th was subsumed by the Liverpool Volunteer Rifle Brigade while the 79th disbanded in 1863 . 
 The Second Boer War catalysed a renewed interest in establishing a unit composed of Scottish Liverpudlians . On 30 April 1900 , the 8th ( Scottish ) Volunteer Battalion was formed within the King 's ( Liverpool Regiment ) , with headquarters later being located at 22 Highgate Street , Edge Hill . The Liverpool Scottish became one of four battalions in English infantry regiments to explicitly associate with the Irish and Scottish communities - the other battalions were the London Scottish , Liverpool Irish and London Irish Rifles . 
 Traditional highland attire adopted for the battalion 's dress uniform included the Clan Forbes pattern tartan and the <unk> headdress . A former major in the 2nd Volunteer Battalion , Christopher Forbes Bell , was appointed commanding officer and officially assumed command on 24 October . Bell was succeeded in command by Andrew Laurie Macfie in 1902 . 
 In common with other volunteer battalions , the Liverpool Scottish organised a detachment for overseas service in South Africa during the Second Boer War . The contingent of 22 volunteers under Lieutenant John Watson was dispatched in 1902 and attached to the 4th Service Company of the 1st Gordon Highlanders . The battalion had already suffered its first fatality after Lieutenant J.A. Bingham succumbed to wounds incurred at Klip River while serving with the Imperial Yeomanry in February 1902 . They had only limited duties , primarily occupying blockhouses , as the conflict was reaching its conclusion . Nevertheless , the British Army recognised the battalion 's contribution with the reward of a battle honour : " South Africa 1902 " . 
 The Liverpool Scottish acquired purpose @-@ built accommodation for its headquarters in 1904 at Fraser Street , in Liverpool City Centre , which the battalion maintained until 1967 . The construction of the building was partially subsidised by public donation ( some £ 4 @,@ 000 ) but its cost required additional funds generated through a three @-@ day " bazaar " hosted at St George 's Hall . 
 The Liverpool Scottish became the King 's 10th Battalion in 1908 when Secretary of State for War Richard Haldane 's reforms established the Territorial Force , which grouped the volunteers and yeomanry into 14 county @-@ administered divisions and 14 mounted brigades . By 1914 , the 10th ( Liverpool Scottish ) would be subordinate to the South Lancashire Brigade , West Lancashire Division .

 When war was declared in August 1914 , the Liverpool Scottish mobilised and moved to Scotland under the command of Lieutenant @-@ Colonel William Nicholl . Duplicate battalions were formed in Liverpool from personnel unable to volunteer for overseas service . The second @-@ line battalion , designated as the 2 / 10th to distinguish it from the original , was organised in October , the third @-@ line in May 1915 . They became responsible for the training of recruits and provision of drafts for overseas service . The 2 / 10th , raised and organised by Captain ( later Lieutenant @-@ Colonel ) Adam <unk> , was committed to the Western Front in 1917 . The third @-@ line remained in Britain for the duration of the war . 
 Considered by contemporaries to be socially élite and reasonably well @-@ trained compared to other territorial units , the 1 / 10th volunteered for overseas service and became the seventh territorial battalion to be dispatched to the Western Front . The battalion took passage aboard the SS Maidan at Southampton on 1 November 1914 , completing its disembarkation at Le Havre on the morning of the third with the Queen 's Westminster Rifles . The battalion 's original strength - those who qualified for the 1914 Star - became known as the " <unk> " in reference to the vessel . 
 Assigned to the 9th Brigade , 3rd Division , the Liverpool Scottish occupied trenches in the Kemmel area , five miles south of Ypres . The 1 / 10th suffered its first fatality on 29 November : Captain Arthur Twentyman , killed while attempting to return to British lines . The combination of severe winter and trench warfare soon depleted the strength of the Liverpool Scottish . From an establishment of 26 officers and 829 men recorded in November , the battalion had dwindled to 370 able @-@ bodied men by January 1915 . Within weeks of the battalion 's arrival , Major Blair , Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Nicholl 's successor , was replaced by J.R. Davidson due to ill @-@ health . Davidson would command the battalion , albeit interrupted by wounds sustained during the Somme Offensive , until 1917 , when he returned to Liverpool to become the city 's Chief Engineer . 
 Obsolete equipment and organisational differences with the regular army became some of the earliest challenges that the battalion and other territorials contended with in France . The Scottish employed the long version of the Lee – Enfield ( MLE ) rifle , which had been superseded by the SMLE ( Short Magazine Lee – Enfield ) in the Regular Army . Unsuited to newer ammunition and the conditions of the Western Front , the 10th 's <unk> began to be phased out by the SMLE in early 1915 — a process that would not be entirely complete until 1916 . Structurally different from their regular counterparts , territorial battalions were reorganised early in the war to conform with the regulars . Unlike the Regular Army , which had adopted a four @-@ company system in 1913 , territorial battalions were still organised into eight companies . When the system was extended to the Liverpool Scottish , the battalion designated its consolidated companies " V " , " X , " Y " , and " Z " . This contrasted with the more conventional " A " to " D " or " 1 " to " 4 " — considered by the battalion to be potentially confusing . 
 The battalion 's first major engagement happened on 16 June 1915 , at Hooge , 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) east of Ypres . The 9th Brigade , with the 7th Brigade in support , was chosen to conduct a three @-@ phased attack with the ultimate intention being to reach trenches on the south @-@ western edge of Bellewaarde Lake . Situated behind German lines was Bellewaarde Ridge , a tactically @-@ important feature that overlooked British positions . At <unk> , the first wave of troops moved on their objective and quickly secured the first @-@ line trenches , which continued to be shelled by British artillery . The Liverpool Scottish and 1st Lincolnshire Regiment , forming the second wave , then left their trenches to pass through the first wave of attackers and reach the German second @-@ line . Although the advance was relatively unopposed , " V " Company encountered resistance on its front from machine @-@ gun fire . After briefly suspending its advance , the company , reinforced by " Z " , charged the opposing positions and took about 40 prisoners . 
 On capturing the second @-@ line , elements of the Liverpool Scottish decided to consolidate the shallow trenches that afforded little protection . The battle had quickly degenerated into a disorganised and chaotic affair , with British battalions losing cohesion and becoming mixed up with each other . An intensive German barrage decimated the occupants of the second @-@ line trenches , while the 10th 's temporary commanding officer , Lieutenant @-@ Colonel E.G. Thin , was wounded by gunfire . The remainder of the Liverpool Scottish continued onto the third @-@ line with portions of the Royal Scots Fusiliers and 1st Northumberland Fusiliers . 
 Consolidating the third @-@ line proved difficult under relentless bombardment and determined opposition from the uncaptured right of the trench system . Some of the Liverpool Scottish nevertheless impulsively carried on beyond the third @-@ line , towards a position called Dead Man 's Bottom and probable death . The battalion 's left flank became compromised in the afternoon by the retreat of the surviving Northumberland Fusiliers . The Liverpool Scottish eventually retreated first to the second @-@ line , then to the more viable <unk> of the former German frontline . The battle persisted into the night , and abortive attempts were made by the Germans to retake the first @-@ line trenches . For about 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 3 @,@ 000 ft ) of gained territory , the Liverpool Scottish had suffered heavy casualties : 79 killed , 212 wounded , and 109 missing from a pre @-@ battle strength of 542 officers and other ranks . A memorial to this battle was erected in the area in 2000 . An experienced Company @-@ Quartermaster Sergeant , R.A. Scott Macfie , described the aftermath at camp in a letter to his father : 
 = = = 1916 – 1917 = = = 
 The West Lancashire Division reformed in January 1916 as the 55th , under the command of Major @-@ General Hugh Jeudwine . Many of the division 's original constituent battalions returned and the Liverpool Scottish joined the 166th Brigade . Before being committed to the Somme Offensive in July 1916 , the 55th had concentrated in the Amiens area . The Liverpool Scottish moved to the Somme in mid @-@ July and relieved the 18th King 's near Montauban on the 31st . After spending six days under constant artillery fire undertaking auxiliary duties in the vicinity of <unk> and <unk> Woods , the Liverpool Scottish moved to <unk> Copse in preparation for an assault on Guillemont . The village had already been subjected to two attacks since the opening battles of the Somme . At <unk> on 8 August , brigades from the 2nd and 55th divisions began a concerted effort to take Guillemont . The operation failed with <unk> heavy losses . Despite that , the Liverpool Irish and part of the 1st King 's managed to enter Guillemont , but became isolated . More than 700 men from the two battalions were killed , wounded , or missing , many becoming prisoners of war . 
 Amid reports that the Liverpool Irish were holding out in Guillemont , orders were issued for the 55th Division to renew the attack the next day . Resuming the battle on the night of the 8th had been considered before the decision to attack in the early hours of the 9th . The Liverpool Scottish , which had been in reserve on the 8th , was to advance along a front of 400 yards ( 1 @,@ 200 ft ) with the 1 / 5th Loyals on its left flank , penetrate the German frontline , and establish itself on Guillemont 's eastern boundary . In the prelude to the battle , the Liverpool Scottish waited behind lines , constantly moving to avoid sporadic German bombardment . Further difficulties arose for the battalion when it attempted to navigate to its starting positions through unfamiliar territory , compounded at one stage by the absence of guides . While the battalion reached its destination at 0400 , just 20 minutes before the attack was to begin , the Loyals did not arrive until an hour later . Final orders were received late , giving Colonel Davidson only minutes to brief his company commanders . 
 A five @-@ minute artillery bombardment preceded " Zero " hour , which provoked an immediate counter @-@ barrage . At <unk> , the Liverpool Scottish went over the top from the same positions that the 164th Brigade had the previous day . The barrage enveloped the Liverpool Scottish in no man 's land , which , combined with machine @-@ gun fire , stifled the battalion 's progress . Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Davidson personally rallied his battalion , seeking to regain momentum , but was wounded during the repulsed attack . Two further attempts by the remnants of the battalion to reach the frontline yielded no success . Few had entered the German trenches , the majority having been obstructed by uncut barbed wire . Of the 20 officers and about 600 other ranks engaged at Guillemont , 74 had been killed , 174 were wounded , and 32 were unaccounted for . Most of the missing would later be confirmed killed . Another attempt was made days later by the 1 / 9th King 's . The village would not be captured until September . Among the wounded was Captain Noel Godfrey Chavasse , attached to the Liverpool Scottish from the Royal Army Medical Corps , who was awarded the Victoria Cross . He became the battalion 's first and only recipient , and had previously been awarded the Military Cross for his conduct at <unk> . 
 In the subsequent battles of Ginchy and Morval , the 1 / 10th was engaged in a purely supporting role : trench networks were constructed and improved near Delville Wood , and the dead collected and buried . A party of two officers and 100 other ranks was attached to the Third West Lancashire Field Ambulance during the Battle of Morval . After bivouacking at Pont Rémy , the battalion transferred with its division to the relatively quiet Ypres Salient in October . The routine of alternating between the front line , being in support , and in reserve preoccupied the battalion until the Third Battle of Ypres in July 1917 . Casualties were nevertheless sustained by the battalion during this period , invariably as a result of shelling and sniping . 
 The battalion was subsequently returned to the Ypres salient , positioned at Wieltje . On 31 July 1917 , a new offensive around Ypres was launched to try to penetrate the German lines , advance to the Belgian coast and capture German submarine bases . The Liverpool Scottish experienced some of the heaviest resistance in 166th Brigade 's area , taking heavy losses around the fortified farms . The battalion remained in some captured German trenches until it was relieved on 3 August . Captain Chavasse died of wounds the next day having again tended to wounded soldiers . His actions earned him a posthumous Bar to his Victoria Cross , one of only three men to be so decorated , and the sole double recipient of the First World War . 
 In September , the Scottish moved south to Epehy , thirteen miles south of Cambrai , where its division took part in the Battle of Cambrai in November . 
 = = = 1918 = = = 
 On 21 March 1918 , the Central Powers launched their expected Spring Offensive ( Operation Michael ) , signifying the beginning of Germany 's final attempt to achieve a decisive victory before significant American forces arrived on the Western Front . By the 25th , substantial gains in territory had been made in the direction of Amiens . Although prepared for a possible attack , the Liverpool Scottish and the 55th Division did not participate in the desperate Allied defence until the next phase of the offensive , Operation Georgette . 
 Begun on 9 April , Operation Georgette shifted the focus to the devastated town of Ypres , in Flanders . The bombardment preceding the attack was of considerable scale and included phosgene gas shells , causing severe casualties among the Liverpool Scottish . 
 The Liverpool Scottish was involved in the defence of the Givenchy sector during the Battle of Estaires , sustaining such losses that they absorbed the 2 / 10th Battalion that had landed in France in February 1917 . After the Spring Offensive was halted , the Western Front entered its final phase — a series of Allied drives from August to November known as the Hundred Days Offensive . The Liverpool Scottish fought one of its last actions of the war , at La Bassée Canal , in October . 
 The final month of the war offered little respite to the battalion . In the days leading up to the Armistice of 11 November 1918 , the Liverpool Scottish helped to secure numerous villages without opposition and crossed the River Scheldt on 9 November . On the day of the Armistice , the Liverpool Scottish was situated at Villers @-@ Notre @-@ Dame . With the 165th and 166th brigades , the battalion had been readied to assault German positions obstructing passage into the town of Ath . Such a prospect was averted , however , when the 2 / 5th Lancashire Fusiliers attacked and seized one of the bridges before it could be demolished . 
 = = Interbellum and Second World War = = 
 Following reconstitution into the Territorial Army in 1920 , the Liverpool Scottish formalised its relationship with the Queen 's Own Cameron Highlanders and transferred in 1937 to become the regiment 's second territorial battalion . In comparison to the densely urbanised region that the King 's Regiment encompassed in north @-@ west England , the Cameron Highlanders area of recruitment in the Highlands was sparsely populated . Although it had its numerical designation omitted , the battalion 's identity was preserved and headquarters at Fraser Street , Liverpool were retained . During a royal visit to Liverpool in 1938 , George VI presented the battalion with new colours at Everton Football Club 's Goodison Park stadium . 
 After the Territorial Army began to expand following a Government announcement in March 1939 , the Liverpool Scottish formed a second battalion . Mobilisation was later authorised , but both battalions would remain in Britain for the duration of the Second World War . The 2nd Battalion converted to artillery in 1942 as the 89th Anti @-@ Tank Regiment , Royal Artillery and served with the 55th ( West Lancashire ) Infantry Division . In addition , the Liverpool Scottish supplied drafts to other units , principally to the Cameron Highlanders , and formed contingents for the embryonic " Independent Companies " that became the Army " Commandos " . 
 The Liverpool Scottish contributed a troop to the composite No. 4 Independent Company , which also contained troops from the King 's Regiment and South Lancashires , collectively under the command of Major J.R. Paterson — an officer from the Scottish . Formed on 21 April 1940 , at Sizewell , the company soon after embarked aboard the Ulster Prince , bound for Norway to join the Allied campaign against Germany . After landing in early May , No. 4 Company relieved a French force and occupied positions near <unk> . The company , in conjunction with others , operated under the aegis of <unk> , commanded by Brigadier Colin Gubbins . When a German landing cut off <unk> from the north on 11 May , No. 4 Company had to be evacuated by a Norwegian steamer and transported to Sandnessjøen , then to Bodø with No. 5 Company . 
 By the 24th , Allied troops had established a line of defence near the town of <unk> to facilitate the defence of Bodø against Germany 's northern advance . While his forces were engaged in battle , Brigadier Gubbins was informed that the British Government had decided to evacuate northern Norway . The withdrawal of Allied forces commenced on 29 May , with Nos. 1 and 4 Companies being embarked on two destroyers carrying other passengers , including administrative personnel and wounded . 
 After returning to Britain , the Liverpool Scottish troop obtained approval from the Government to <unk> the kilt as an integral part of its Battle Dress . The Commando units and the independent companies consolidated later in the year into " Special Service " battalions , administered by a single brigade . For various reason , the system proved unpopular and in 1941 the battalions were sub @-@ divided , reverting to distinct Commando units . The 1st Special Service Battalion , which had absorbed No. 4 Company , became Nos. 1 and 2 Commando - the latter included a number of the Liverpool Scottish , designated as 5 Troop . 
 In March 1942 , the troop participated with 2 Commando in the raid on St Nazaire , codenamed Operation Chariot . Conceived to neutralise the western French port as an Atlantic sanctuary for the battleship Tirpitz , Operation Chariot involved 611 men , the antiquated lend @-@ lease destroyer Campbeltown , and numerous small craft . The Campbeltown was converted into a platform designed to deliver 9 @,@ 600 pounds ( 4 @,@ 400 kg ) of explosives , and her appearance was reconfigured to resemble a German destroyer . 
 = = Post @-@ war = = 
 The 1st Scottish deployed to the garrison of Gibraltar in 1945 . Conversion to motorised infantry occurred in 1947 ; however , the battalion soon reverted to a standard infantry role . Economic constraints and alignment towards nuclear weapons and other military technology necessitated the reorganisation and rationalisation of the Territorial Army in the 1960s . Most battalions were reduced to cadre @-@ strength or disbanded . Although the Liverpool Scottish avoided extinction , the battalion disbanded and reconstituted into two separate units , one of infantry and one of artillery : " V " Company , 51st Highland Volunteers , and " G " Troop of " R " ( King 's ) Company , The West Lancashire Regiment , RA . Both maintained their headquarters at Forbes House , Score Lane , in Childwall , Liverpool . While the troop disbanded with " R " Battery in 1969 , the company remained an integral component of the 51st Highland until 1992 . 
 During company exercises in Cyprus in 1974 , Greek Cypriots seeking <unk> with Greece deposed the island 's government - an action illicitly supported by the Greek Junta and followed by the Turkish invasion . Unable to intervene in the ethnic conflict , the Liverpool Scottish were eventually evacuated from <unk> , through Greek @-@ controlled territory , to the British base at Akrotiri . Post @-@ Cold War restructuring incorporated " V " Company into the 5th / 8th ( Volunteer ) Battalion of the King 's Regiment , successor to the King 's Regiment ( Liverpool ) . Further reorganisation in 1999 reduced the Scottish to a platoon of A ( King 's ) Company , King 's and Cheshire Regiment . The platoon relocated to Townsend Avenue , Norris Green , where territorial infantry in Liverpool are concentrated . 
 In 2006 , the King 's Regiment amalgamated with two others to become the Duke of Lancaster 's Regiment . The regiment 's 4th Battalion was formed by the integration of the Lancastrian and Cumbrian Volunteers with the King 's companies of the King 's and Cheshire Regiment . The Liverpool Scottish Platoon remained a part of the retitled " A " ( Ladysmith ) Company . Individuals from the platoon have been attached to other units deployed on operational tours in Bosnia , Afghanistan , and Iraq .

 = The Chaser APEC pranks = 
 The Chaser APEC pranks were a series of comic stunts that targeted the Asia @-@ Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) Leaders Summit ( 2 – 9 September 2007 ) , in Sydney , Australia . They were coordinated and performed by the Australian satire group The Chaser for the television series The Chaser 's War on Everything . The most prominent prank was the breach of an APEC restricted zone in the heart of Sydney central business district on 6 September . Julian Morrow directed a fake Canadian motorcade , which was allowed through the restricted zone by police and not detected until Chas Licciardello alighted , dressed as Osama bin Laden . 
 Although pranks that involved public locations , figures , and organisations were always a feature of the series , the APEC pranks yielded unprecedented local and international publicity , both positive and negative . Some team members faced charges for breaching the APEC zone , but these were dropped because police had allowed their entry into the restricted zone . Other less controversial and less publicised stunts were also shown on The Chaser 's War on Everything , with ratings peaking at almost three million Australian viewers for the APEC wrap @-@ up episode .

 APEC Australia 2007 comprised a series of political meetings between representatives of the 21 member governments of the Asia @-@ Pacific Economic Cooperation . This culminated in a week @-@ long summit meeting : Leaders Week , 2 to 9 September , when heads of the member governments gathered in Sydney . The significance of the APEC summit called for stringent and expensive security arrangements . The Protective Security Coordination Centre , of the National Security and Criminal Justice Group from the Australian Attorney @-@ General 's Department , oversaw security planning through the APEC 2007 Security Branch , formed expressly for the APEC meetings . In order to secure and monitor the summit , the New South Wales Police Force instituted the APEC Police Security Command . Many public roads in Sydney were closed , as leaders , officials , and personnel travelled in motorcades around the city centre . Figures released by the state government at a Senate committee hearing show that security measures at APEC cost $ 170 million . 
 = = = The Chaser = = = 
 The Chaser group 's founding members were Charles Firth , Dominic Knight , Craig Reucassel , and Julian Morrow . In 1999 they started The Chaser , a fortnightly satirical newspaper . Chas Licciardello , Andrew Hansen , and Chris Taylor later joined the group ; and in 2006 , after various ventures in radio , stage , and television , this line @-@ up created The Chaser 's War on Everything , its most successful program , which screened on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) station ABC1 . By its second season in 2007 , the show had forged a reputation for ambush @-@ style stunts and deliberate controversy . 
 The group had been warned about the dangers of irresponsible behaviour during the Sydney lockdown for the APEC summit . According to New South Wales Police Minister David Campbell , the police understood that " parody and satire are entertaining and fun " , but The Chaser must understand the " seriousness of this matter [ APEC ] and take caution " . A later police statement reiterated that producers of The Chaser 's War on Everything had been warned about the " ramifications of stunts during APEC " . 
 The Chaser was unfazed by police warnings . Before the summit , Julian Morrow commented on radio that " the eyes of the world and the eyes of Al @-@ Qaeda are on us " . Morrow hinted that their challenge was to perform a stunt that would " make Osama bin Laden feel a little incompetent " . 
 = = Breach of APEC restricted zone = = 
 On 6 September 2007 , eight members of the team ( including five runners dressed as bodyguards ) and three hired chauffeurs manned a fake Canadian motorcade consisting of two motorcycles , two black four @-@ wheel drive vehicles , and a black sedan . The group — including Chas Licciardello dressed as Osama bin Laden , and Julian Morrow — drove the motorcade through the Sydney central business district and breached the APEC security zone . The premise of the stunt was that bin Laden should have been invited to the summit as a world leader , to discuss the War on Terror , with another motive being to test the event 's security . The stunt was approved by ABC lawyers under the assumption that the motorcade would be stopped at the first security checkpoint and denied entry . 
 In the following episode of The Chaser 's War on Everything , the team emphasised that their only realistic attempt to disguise the vehicles was the use of a Canadian flag . Taylor later said that there was " no particular reason we chose Canada , we just thought they 'd be a country who the cops wouldn 't scrutinise too closely , and who feasibly would only have three cars in their motorcade — as opposed to the 20 or so gas guzzlers that Bush has brought with him " . There were many deliberate indications that the motorcade was not genuine , particularly on the fake credentials used by the team ; members ' security passes were printed with <unk> , <unk> , and It 's pretty obvious this isn 't a real pass all clearly visible , while the APEC 2007 Official Vehicle stickers included both the name of the series and the text This dude likes trees and poetry and certain types of carnivorous plants excite him . In addition , some of the runners were holding camcorders and one of the motorcyclists was wearing jeans , both highly unusual for an official motorcade . 
 At 11 @.@ 30 am ( <unk> ) , the motorcade began its journey towards the " ring of steel " , a fenced area at the intersection of Bent and Macquarie Streets . The vehicle ( or vehicles ) stopped for a red light and the police became aware of the motorcade 's presence , but waved them towards the checkpoint . The convoy travelled through the first checkpoint without inspection and proceeded in a northerly direction to a second security checkpoint in the prohibited " red zone " , just before Bridge Street . Both motorcyclists had by now separated from the motorcade , which was waved through the second checkpoint by police officers . It travelled further into the restricted area before stopping outside the InterContinental Hotel . 
 Morrow ordered the motorcade to turn around at the Bridge Street intersection because he realised that they had proceeded further than expected , and because the police officers were not going to stop them . After partially turning the motorcade , Licciardello alighted onto the street and complained , in character as bin Laden , about not being invited to the APEC Summit . At this point , the police requested Morrow 's identity . After inspecting his fake pass , officers realised that Morrow was from The Chaser and took all eleven members of the motorcade into custody . Surprisingly , as pointed out by the team on their television show , the officers initially ignored Licciardello ( Osama Bin Laden ) and only arrested Morrow . 
 The arrested cast and crew were immediately taken to Surry Hills Police Station , where they were questioned and charged with entering a prohibited area under the APEC Meeting ( Police Powers ) Act 2007 . All were released on bail to appear in court on 4 October 2007 . Under the new legislation , the crew members would each face a maximum penalty of six months ' imprisonment if they were convicted or up to two years if they were in possession of a " prohibited item " .

 Following the breach of the APEC restricted area , the actions of The Chaser became the subject of intense debate among sections of the media , senior police officers , and government ministers . 
 = = = Public response = = = 
 Despite strong condemnation from some officials , the stunt was mostly well received by the public . A Sydney correspondent for the British Broadcasting Corporation reported that the Chaser team had become " folk heroes " after the prank , while 87 % of the 28 @,@ 451 respondents to a Sydney Morning Herald internet poll found the stunt " funny " . 
 However , the ABC received more than 250 complaints , outweighing the 177 positive submissions . A spokesperson for the national broadcaster said that the results were misleading because people who enjoyed the show typically do not make comments . Around the country , around 80 % of callers to talkback radio were supportive ; and one third of all calls regarding APEC mentioned the stunt . 
 = = = Political reactions = = = 
 There were many critics among politicians and officials . Representatives of the police force in Sydney were among the most severe , and New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione , the head of APEC 's lead security agency , was angered because the comedians could have been shot by police snipers , who were " clearly ... there because they mean business . They 're not there for show . " In response , Licciardello expressed his faith in the snipers ' professional ability : " They are highly trained , competent people and they 're not going to shoot people if they 're in an Osama bin Laden costume if they clearly don 't pose a threat " . 
 Many politicians , mostly from the Labor government of New South Wales , reacted to the security breach with concern and unease . Police Minister David Andrew Campbell expressed disappointment and concern over the stunt , arguing that there were " 21 world leaders arriving in the city at the one time and it needs to be taken seriously " . Then New South Wales Premier Morris <unk> said that while he was a fan of the show , those involved would have to face the full force of the law . The then Federal Opposition Leader Kevin Rudd , also from the Labor Party , voiced similar concerns , saying that " I 'm a fan of The Chaser ... but I think these guys have crossed the line . " 
 Alexander Downer , the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Australia 's Coalition government , was amused when asked to comment on the incident . He said the arrests proved that the security system had functioned properly , adding that " whatever you think of the humour of The Chaser ... they were clearly not going to harm anybody in a physical way " . The incident also generated debate during Question Time in the Senate .

 The APEC security breach captured international attention and acclaim . A local newspaper in Canada saw the humorous side , despite the pranksters posing as Canadian officials . In the United States media reviews were mixed . <unk> from American networks such as the Fox News Channel , National Broadcasting Company , and CBS Broadcasting either " raised their eyebrows " or " had smiles on their faces over the stunt " . After the high ratings for the episode and international recognition derived from the stunt , the program began screening in countries such as Israel , South Korea , and New Zealand ; and other countries , especially in the Middle East , began negotiating with the ABC . The stunt was named the Best Television Moment at the 2008 MTV Australia Awards . Australian scholar Niall Lucy analyses the prank 's political significance as an important act of deconstruction in his book Pomo Oz : Fear and Loathing Downunder . 
 = = = Current affairs = = = 
 On 6 September 2007 , the tabloid current affairs program Today Tonight from the Seven Network aired a story headed " Dangerous Fools " , specifically devoted to the APEC stunt . Host Anna Coren asserted that The Chaser were wasting taxpayers ' money , and will " need more of those funds [ in legal costs to the government @-@ funded ABC ] to defend their actions in court " . Coren claimed that the ABC chiefs were too arrogant to reply to the program 's inquiries . A media commentator interviewed in the report condemned the APEC stunt as " over the top " , and said he could not see the humour of it . A security expert presented his view , saying that there was a serious risk of injury , not just to the crew members , but to onlookers outside the security zone , even though the breach was discovered by police officers well inside the prohibited area . 
 Today Tonight 's broadcast criticised The Chaser 's approach to the APEC event , describing the stunt as " [ stretching ] the boundaries yet again " . The program quoted Morrow 's radio comments about wanting " a stunt that can really hit the headlines across the world " as evidence of irresponsibility . The show also presented Craig Reucassel from The Chaser , responding to questions and claiming that the comedians were " hardly sorry " for their actions . Ironically , the report was made by Dave " <unk> " Richardson , notorious for his hoax story " In Barcelona Tonight " ; but Richardson , unlike The Chaser crew , had not gone through roadblocks in his stunt . 
 The rival Nine Network 's current affairs program A Current Affair also aired a report . A Nine cameraman had seen the stunt unfold , and managed to capture it on tape . The report revolved around the incompetence of the police and security personnel , in contrast to Today Tonight 's criticism of The Chaser 's actions , and spoke of the group executing " their grandest gag yet " , bringing together " the world 's most powerful man and the world 's most wanted , in the same place , at the same time " , referring to US president Bush and terrorist bin Laden . 
 = = = Legal action = = = 
 After their arrest and questioning by police , all eleven participants in the stunt ( eight production members of The Chaser 's War on Everything and three hired drivers ) were charged with " entering a restricted area without special justification " under the APEC Meeting ( Police Powers ) Act 2007 . All eleven were granted bail , on the condition that they refrain from entering any of the APEC secured areas , and ordered to appear at the Downing Centre Local Court on 4 October 2007 . Those charged were Esteban Alegria , Nathan Earl , Giles Hardie , Lauren Howard , Mark <unk> , Chas Licciardello , Geoffrey Lye , Alexander Morrow , Julian Morrow , Rodrigo Pena , and Benson Simpson . After numerous adjournments , all charges were dropped by the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) on 28 April 2008 . 
 It was decided that the police , failing to notice that the presented security badges were fake , had given " tacit " permission for the group to enter the restricted zone . Further , the actions of the police on the scene , who themselves may have been unaware of where , exactly , the legally restricted area began , caused the Chaser team to proceed much further into the heart of the security zone than they had intended to or realised . This meant their breach of the law had happened largely due to an <unk> mistake of fact on the part of Morrow , who intended to end the stunt before crossing into restricted territory , but who received no explicit indications as to where that territory began − and was indeed waved farther into it by the police . The ABC welcomed this development ; Morrow commented : " I think it 's just great that justice hasn 't been done " . The police remained unapologetic . 
 The DPP argued that it was never the intention of The Chaser to breach security and that they were allowed into the restricted area only because of the mistakes of the police . The laws enacted for the summit meant that entry into the restricted zone needed justification , which could include police permission . The DPP stated that by waving The Chaser through , they had granted permission to be in the restricted zone . A further defence was available : all members charged , except Morrow , could argue that they were present for work @-@ related purposes , and part of their employment was to be with Morrow , who was directing the stunt . 
 = = = Show ratings = = = 
 With all the hype and media attention directed at this stunt , the following episode of The Chaser 's War on Everything on 12 September 2007 , initially intended to be called The Chaser 's War on APEC , was the program 's highest @-@ rating ever . In Australia there was a total of 2 @.@ 981 million viewers : 2 @.@ 245 million viewers in the capital cities , and 736 @,@ 000 regional viewers . This stunning success made it the most watched ABC1 television program since 2000 , and broke the show 's own record of 1 @.@ 491 million viewers in capital cities , set by the preceding episode . 
 The 12 September episode was downloaded one million times from the ABC 's website , and in late February 2008 it was nominated for the Rose d 'Or international television award for comedy , on behalf of The Chaser 's War on Everything . The stunt depicted was nominated for the " TV moment award " at the 2008 MTV Australia Video Music Awards , and Nine Network 's show 20 to 1 Pranks and Pranksters ranked it first in its list of " greatest pranks in Australian history " . 
 = = = The Chaser 's response = = = 
 After the successful breach of APEC security , the comedians expressed their bewilderment at the incompetence of the security forces . Morrow and Reucassel went on radio to augment the initial reactions they had aired on the 12 September episode of The Chaser 's War on Everything . Morrow pointed out that while they did extensive planning for the stunt , the one thing they " didn 't plan for was success " ; the participants were confused by the unexpected permission to enter the area , and unsure how to proceed ; they clearly sensed danger , but the atmosphere was actually very quiet and subdued . 
 Licciardello stated that they did not know they had entered the red zone , and " we had the advice of our lawyers ring in our ears ; ' Do NOT go into the red zone . You can go into the green zone if they let you , but DO NOT go into the red zone . ' " He said that they " were absolutely sure we would never get past the first checkpoint . It was panic stations when we realised " , adding that it was a " stupid gag that backfired " . Morrow said that the purpose of the stunt was " an attempt to satirise in a silly way the very heavy security and the spin surrounding that security , it was a test of the old adage that if you want to get in somewhere the best way is right through the front door . I didn 't want the stunt to happen in a way that resulted in people getting arrested . If we 've made a mistake and crossed into the green zone , I 'm very regretful about that . " He said the only reason they impersonated bin Laden was because they needed a joke to get out of the stunt that they always assumed would never have passed security .

 In addition to The Chaser 's major APEC security breach , the team performed stunts at the APEC Summit that received far less coverage in the media . 
 = = = Pantomime horse at APEC protests = = = 
 On 5 September 2007 , Chris Taylor , mounted on a pantomime horse , confronted police officers , who were on foot , and asked them if they needed any reinforcements against APEC protesters . When his offer was refused , Taylor took the horse for a stroll anyway , and was met by amused onlookers and media personnel . He was later asked by police officers to remove his clothing for examination , since it resembled a police uniform ; but no charges of impersonating police were laid . The reference was to the horse flu outbreak , which forced police officers to face APEC protesters on foot . This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode .

 On 7 September 2007 , following the security breach on the previous day , Taylor , Reucassel , Dominic Knight and their film crew were detained and questioned over a follow @-@ up stunt . This incident involved running near and attempting to enter the APEC protected zone dressed in cardboard cars mounted with Canadian flags , a reference to the flags ' earlier use to disguise the successful breach by the real motorcade . Police had no choice but to release all members involved in this stunt , as they were outside the prohibited area . This stunt also aired on the 12 September episode .

 Shortly before 5 September 2007 , Reucassel approached several APEC security personnel and offered a selection of clothing , inspired by the traditional official photograph of all the attending leaders wearing matching outfits . This stunt aired on the 5 September 2007 episode .

 Shortly before 12 September 2007 , as part of Chinese President Hu Jintao 's visit to Australia , Reucassel went to the Chinese Consulate and asked for them to prepay the bullets he was going to use to assassinate Hu , in reference to China 's policy of requiring the family of the condemned prisoner to pay for bullets used in their relative 's execution . This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode . 
 = = = APEC security checks = = = 
 Shortly before 5 September 2007 , Licciardello , who was dressed as a police officer , performed random security checks and procedures on members of the public to demonstrate the glorification of the tough APEC security measures . These procedures included random frisking , taking hair samples , telling tram riders in Melbourne to stand and turn their heads , and erecting secure areas in public toilets and near escalators . When Licciardello was approached by real security officers , he said that all of these measures were " classified " . This stunt aired on the 5 September 2007 episode . 
 = = = Radio prank call = = = 
 On 10 September 2007 , Licciardello rang a talkback radio station pretending to be someone else , and complained about the stunt , claiming that it was stupid and anyone involved at the ABC , including Kerry O 'Brien , should be jailed for ten years . This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode , and Licciardello said he wished he had made the call on the evening of the security breach because talkback radio discussion would not have already died down . 
 = = = RSL attempted entry = = = 
 Sometime between 6 and 12 September 2007 , Licciardello and Morrow tried to enter a Returned and Services League ( RSL ) building using the same fake passes that had gained them entry to the restricted area . The manager did not let them enter , which was proof , according to the team , that " <unk> are harder to get into than APEC " . This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode . However , in the DVD commentary of the episode , The Chaser stated that they were actually let into many RSL buildings with the fake passes . They claimed that acting as if one is meant to be present is usually enough .

 On 8 September 2007 , Chaser members Taylor and Andrew Hansen launched a competing fireworks display to coincide with the official APEC fireworks display , which was only to be viewed by the APEC officials . The two displays were close to each other , with the official fireworks launched at the Sydney Harbour Bridge , while the rival fireworks were fired from Woolwich . The team lit up a large screen with the text Screw APEC . This stunt aired on the 12 September 2007 episode ; and in the DVD commentary on the episode Morrow said the display was hard to orchestrate and not cheap . 
 = = = Animals at Taronga Zoo = = = 
 Shortly before 5 September 2007 , Reucassel , equipped with suitable costumes , went into Taronga Zoo and impersonated real Australian native animals , in reference to the temporary relocation of some animals for private viewing by spouses of APEC leaders .

 A planned stunt that was never executed was an attempt to breach the nautical red zone . Morrow and Licciardello were to perform it after the motorcade stunt on 6 September 2007 ; but it never went ahead , since they were detained by police after the surprising success of the earlier stunt . The plan was to breach APEC nautical security in " funny " boats , such as a gondola . Licciardello also stated on an episode of ' Rove Live ' that there was to be an attempt to breach APEC security " by <unk> . " 
 = Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan = 
 Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan is a 1982 American science fiction film released by Paramount Pictures . It is the second film based on Star Trek , and is a sequel to Star Trek : The Motion Picture ( 1979 ) . The plot features Admiral James T. Kirk ( William Shatner ) and the crew of the starship USS Enterprise facing off against the genetically engineered tyrant Khan Noonien Singh ( Ricardo Montalbán ) , a character who first appeared in the 1967 Star Trek television series episode " Space Seed " . When Khan escapes from a 15 @-@ year exile to exact revenge on Kirk , the crew of the Enterprise must stop him from acquiring a powerful terraforming device named Genesis . The film concludes with the death of Spock ( Leonard Nimoy ) , beginning a story arc that continues with the 1984 film Star Trek III : The Search for Spock and concludes with 1986 's Star Trek IV : The Voyage Home . 
 After the lackluster critical and commercial response to The Motion Picture , series creator Gene Roddenberry was forced out of the sequel 's production . Executive producer Harve Bennett wrote the film 's original outline , which Jack B. Sowards developed into a full script . Director Nicholas Meyer completed the final script in 12 days , without accepting a writing credit . Meyer 's approach evoked the swashbuckling atmosphere of the original series , and the theme was reinforced by James Horner 's musical score . Nimoy had not intended to have a role in The Motion Picture 's sequel , but was enticed back on the promise that his character would be given a dramatic death scene . Negative test audience reaction to Spock 's death led to significant revisions of the ending over Meyer 's objections . The production used various cost @-@ cutting techniques to keep within budget , including utilizing miniatures from past projects and re @-@ using sets , effects footage and costumes from the previous movie . Among the film 's technical achievements is it being the first feature film to contain a complete sequence created entirely with computer @-@ generated graphics . 
 The Wrath of Khan was released in North America on June 4 , 1982 . It was a box office success , earning US $ 97 million worldwide and setting a world record for first @-@ day box office gross . Critical reaction to the film was positive ; reviewers highlighted Khan , the film 's pacing , and the character interactions as strong elements . Negative reaction focused on weak special effects and some of the acting . The Wrath of Khan is considered by some to be the best film of the Star Trek series , and is credited with renewing substantial interest in the franchise . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In the year <unk> , Admiral James T. Kirk oversees a simulator session of Captain Spock 's trainees . In the simulation , Lieutenant Saavik commands the starship USS Enterprise on a rescue mission to save the crew of the damaged ship Kobayashi Maru . When the Enterprise enters the Klingon Neutral Zone to reach the ship it is attacked by Klingon cruisers and critically damaged . The simulation is a no @-@ win scenario designed to test the character of Starfleet officers . Later , Dr. McCoy joins Kirk on his birthday ; seeing Kirk in low spirits , the doctor advises Kirk to get a new command and not grow old behind a desk . 
 Meanwhile , the USS Reliant is on a mission to search for a lifeless planet for testing of the Genesis Device , a technology designed to reorganize matter to create habitable worlds for colonization . Reliant officers Commander Pavel Chekov and Captain Clark Terrell beam down to the surface of a possible candidate planet , which they believe to be Ceti Alpha VI ; once there , they are captured by genetically engineered tyrant Khan Noonien Singh . The Enterprise discovered Khan 's ship adrift in space 15 years previously ; Kirk exiled Khan and his fellow supermen from 20th @-@ century Earth to Ceti Alpha V after they attempted to take over the Enterprise . After they were marooned , Ceti Alpha VI exploded , shifting the orbit of Ceti Alpha V and destroying its ecosystem . Khan blames Kirk for the death of his wife and plans revenge . He implants Chekov and Terrell with indigenous creatures that enter the ears of their victims and render them susceptible to mind control , and uses the officers to capture the Reliant . Learning of Genesis , Khan attacks space station Regula I where the device is being developed by Kirk 's former lover , Dr. Carol Marcus , and their son , David . 
 The Enterprise embarks on a three @-@ week training voyage . Kirk assumes command after the ship receives a distress call from Regula I. En route , the Enterprise is ambushed and crippled by the Reliant , leading to the deaths and injuries of many trainees . Khan hails the Enterprise and offers to spare Kirk 's crew if they relinquish all material related to Genesis . Kirk stalls for time and uses the Reliant 's prefix code to remotely lower its shields , allowing the Enterprise to counter @-@ attack . Khan is forced to retreat and effect repairs , while the Enterprise limps to Regula I. Kirk , McCoy , and Saavik beam to the station and find Terrell and Chekov alive , along with slaughtered members of Marcus 's team . They soon find Carol and David hiding deep inside the planetoid of Regula . Khan , having used Terrell and Chekov as spies , orders them to kill Kirk ; Terrell resists the eel 's influence and kills himself while Chekov collapses as the eel leaves his body . Khan then transports Genesis aboard the Reliant . Though Khan believes his foe stranded on Regula I , Kirk and Spock use a coded message to arrange a rendezvous . Kirk directs the Enterprise into the nearby Mutara Nebula ; static discharges inside the nebula render shields useless and compromise targeting systems , making the Enterprise and the Reliant evenly matched . Spock notes however that Khan 's tactics are two @-@ dimensional , indicating inexperience in space combat , which Kirk then exploits to critically disable the Reliant . 
 Mortally wounded , Khan activates Genesis , which will reorganize all matter in the nebula including the Enterprise . Though Kirk 's crew detects the activation of Genesis and attempts to move out of range , they will not be able to escape the nebula in time due to the ship 's damaged warp drive . Spock goes to the engine room to restore the warp drive . When McCoy tries to prevent Spock 's entry , as exposure to the high levels of radiation would be fatal , Spock incapacitates the doctor with a Vulcan nerve pinch and performs a mind meld , telling him to " remember " . Spock successfully restores power to the warp drive and the Enterprise escapes the explosion , though at the cost of his life . The explosion of Genesis causes the gas in the nebula to reform into a new planet , capable of sustaining life . 
 After being alerted by McCoy , Kirk arrives in the engine room and discovers Spock dying of radiation poisoning . The two share a meaningful exchange in which Spock urges Kirk not to grieve , as his decision to sacrifice his own life to save those of the ship 's crew is a logical one , before succumbing to his injuries . A space burial is held in the Enterprise 's torpedo room and Spock 's coffin is shot into orbit around the new planet . The crew leaves to pick up the Reliant 's marooned crew from Ceti Alpha V. Spock 's coffin , having soft @-@ landed , rests on the Genesis planet 's surface . 
 = = Cast = = 
 William Shatner as James T. Kirk 
 A Starfleet Admiral and former commanding officer of the Enterprise . Kirk and Khan never confront each other face @-@ to @-@ face during the film . All of their interactions are over a viewscreen or through communicators and their scenes were filmed four months apart , although a draft script had Khan defeating Kirk in a swordfight . Meyer described Shatner as an actor who was naturally protective of his character and himself , and who performed better over multiple takes . 
 Ricardo Montalbán as Khan Noonien Singh 
 A genetically enhanced superhuman who used his strength and intellect to briefly rule much of Earth in the 1990s . Montalbán said that he believed all good villains do villainous things , but think that they are acting for the " right " reasons ; in this way , Khan uses his anger at the death of his wife to justify his pursuit of Kirk . The film was close to production approval when it occurred to the producers that no one had asked Montalbán whether he was interested in appearing in the film despite his character having been in the scripts for more than a year . Montalbán was unsure whether he could plausibly play Khan again after many years , especially given his current role of Mr. Roarke on Fantasy Island . Contrary to speculation that Montalbán used a prosthetic chest , no artificial devices were added to emphasize Montalbán 's muscular physique , since even in his 60s and despite an increasingly painful back injury , stemming from being thrown off a horse in the 1950s , Montalbán had a vigorous workout routine . Montalbán enjoyed making the film , and counted the role as a career highlight . His major complaint was that he was never face @-@ to @-@ face with Shatner for a scene . " I had to do my lines with the script girl , who , as you might imagine , sounded nothing like Bill [ Shatner ] , " he explained . 
 Leonard Nimoy as Captain Spock 
 Nimoy had not intended to have a role in The Motion Picture 's sequel , but was enticed back on the promise that his character would be given a dramatic death scene . Nimoy felt it was logical that as Wrath of Khan would be the final Star Trek film , having Spock " go out in a blaze of glory " would be an appropriate way to end the character . 
 DeForest Kelley as Leonard McCoy 
 The Enterprise 's chief medical officer and a close friend of Kirk and Spock . Kelley was dissatisfied with an earlier version of the script to the point that he considered not taking part . Kelley noted his character spoke many of the film 's lighter lines , and felt that this role was essential in bringing a lighter side to the onscreen drama . 
 Walter Koenig as Pavel Chekov 
 The Reliant 's first officer and a former Enterprise crewmember . During filming , Kelley noted that Chekov never met Khan in " Space Seed " ( Koenig had not yet joined the cast ) , and thus Khan recognizing Chekov on Ceti Alpha did not make sense . Star Trek books have tried to rationalize this discrepancy ; in the film 's novelization by Vonda N. McIntyre , Chekov is " an ensign assigned to the night watch " during " Space Seed " and met Khan in an off @-@ screen scene . The non @-@ canonical novel To Reign in Hell : The Exile of Khan Noonien Singh explains the error by having Chekov escort Khan to the surface of Ceti Alpha after the events of the television episode . The real cause of the error was a simple oversight by the filmmakers . Meyer defended the mistake by noting that Arthur Conan Doyle made similar oversights in his Sherlock Holmes stories . Chekov 's screaming while being infested by the Ceti eel led Koenig to jokingly dub the film Star Trek II : Chekov Screams Again , in reference to a similar screaming scene in The Motion Picture . Paul Winfield plays Reliant captain Clark Terrell ; Meyer had seen Winfield 's work in films such as Sounder and wanted to direct him . Meyer thought in retrospect that the Ceti eel scenes might have been corny , but felt that Winfield 's performance helped add gravity . 
 Other members of the Enterprise crew include chief engineer Montgomery Scott ( James Doohan ) , helmsman Hikaru Sulu ( George Takei ) , and communications officer Uhura ( Nichelle Nichols ) . Nichols and Gene Roddenberry took issue with elements of the film , including the naval references and militaristic uniforms . Nichols also defended Roddenberry when the producers believed he was the source of script leaks . Takei had simply not wanted to reprise his role until Shatner persuaded him to return . Kelley felt that McCoy speaking his catchphrase " he 's dead , Jim " during Spock 's death scene would ruin the moment 's seriousness , so Doohan delivers the line " he 's dead already " to Kirk . Scott loses his young nephew following Khan 's attacks on the Enterprise . The cadet , played by Ike Eisenmann , had many of his lines cut from the original theatrical release , including a scene where it is explained he is Scott 's relative . These scenes were reintroduced when ABC aired The Wrath of Khan on television in 1985 , and in the director 's edition , making Scott 's grief at the crewman 's death more understandable . 
 Other characters include Kirstie Alley as Saavik , Spock 's protege and a Starfleet commander @-@ in @-@ training aboard the Enterprise . The movie was Alley 's first feature film role . Saavik cries during Spock 's funeral . Meyer said that during filming someone asked him , " ' Are you going to let her do that ? ' And I said , ' Yeah , ' and they said , ' But Vulcans don 't cry , ' and I said , ' Well , that 's what makes this such an interesting Vulcan . ' " The character 's emotional outbursts can be partly explained by the fact that Saavik was described as of mixed Vulcan @-@ Romulan heritage in the script , though no indication is given on film . Alley was so fond of her Vulcan ears that she would take them home with her at the end of each day . Bibi Besch plays Carol Marcus , the lead scientist working on Project Genesis , and the mother of Kirk 's son , David ( played by Merritt Butrick ) . Meyer was looking for an actress who looked beautiful enough that it was plausible a womanizer such as Kirk would fall for her , yet who could also project a sense of intelligence . Meyer liked that Butrick 's hair was blond like Besch 's and curly like Shatner 's , making him a plausible son of the two . John Winston reprises his series role as Kyle , the Enterprise transporter chief .

 = = = Development = = = 
 After the release of The Motion Picture , executive producer Gene Roddenberry wrote his own sequel . In his plot , the crew of the Enterprise travel back in time to set right a corrupted time line after Klingons use the Guardian of Forever to prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy . This was rejected by Paramount executives , who blamed the poor performance and large budget ( $ 46 million ) of the first movie on its plodding pace and the constant rewrites Roddenberry demanded . As a consequence , Roddenberry was removed from the production and , according to Shatner , " kicked upstairs " to the ceremonial position of executive consultant . Harve Bennett , a new Paramount television producer , was made producer for the next Star Trek film . According to Bennett , he was called in front of a group including Jeffrey Katzenberg and Michael Eisner and asked if he thought he could make a better film than The Motion Picture , which Bennett confessed he found " really boring " . When Bennett replied in the affirmative , Charles Bluhdorn asked , " Can you make it for less than forty @-@ five @-@ fucking @-@ million @-@ dollars ? " Bennett replied that " Where I come from , I can make five movies for that . " 
 Bennett realized he faced a serious challenge in developing the new Star Trek movie , partly due to his never having seen the television show . To compensate , Bennett watched all the original episodes . This immersion convinced Bennett that what the first movie lacked was a real villain ; after seeing the episode " Space Seed " , he decided that the character of Khan Noonien Singh was the perfect enemy for the new film . Before the script was settled upon , Bennett gathered his production staff . He selected Robert Sallin , a director of television commercials and a college friend , to produce the film . Sallin 's job would be to produce Star Trek II quickly and cheaply . Bennett also hired Michael Minor as art director to shape the direction of the film . 
 Bennett wrote his first film treatment in November 1980 . In his version , entitled The War of the Generations , Kirk investigates a rebellion on a distant world and discovers that his son is the leader of the rebels . Khan is the mastermind behind the plot , and Kirk and son join forces to defeat the tyrant . Bennett then hired Jack B. Sowards , an avid Star Trek fan , to turn his outline into a film @-@ able script . Sowards wrote an initial script before a writer 's strike in 1981 . Sowards ' draft , The Omega Syndrome , involved the theft of the Federation 's ultimate weapon , the " Omega system " . Sowards was concerned that his weapon was too negative , and Bennett wanted something more uplifting " and as fundamental in the 23rd century as recombinant DNA is in our time " , Minor recalled . Minor suggested to Bennett that the device be turned into a terraforming tool instead . At the story conference the next day , Bennett hugged Minor and declared that he had saved Star Trek . In recognition of the Biblical power of the weapon , Sowards renamed the " Omega system " to the " Genesis Device " . 
 By April 1981 , Sowards had produced a draft that moved Spock 's death to later in the story , because of fan dissatisfaction to the event after the script was leaked . Spock had originally died in the first act , in a shocking demise that Bennett compared to Janet Leigh 's early death in Psycho . This draft had a twelve @-@ page face @-@ to @-@ face confrontation between Kirk and Khan . Sowards ' draft also introduced a male character named Saavik . As pre @-@ production began , Samuel A. Peeples , writer of the Star Trek episode " Where No Man Has Gone Before " , was invited to offer his own script . Peeples ' draft replaced Khan with two new villains named Sojin and Moray ; the alien beings are so powerful they almost destroy Earth by mistake . This script was considered inadequate ; the aliens resembled too closely the villains on a typical TOS episode . Deadlines loomed for special effects production to begin ( which required detailed storyboards based on a completed script ) , and by this point there was no finished script to use . 
 Karen Moore , a Paramount executive , suggested to Bennett that Nicholas Meyer , writer of The Seven @-@ Per @-@ Cent Solution and director of Time After Time , could help resolve the screenplay issues . Meyer had also never seen an episode of Star Trek . He had the idea of making a list consisting of everything that the creative team had liked from the preceding drafts — " it could be a character , it could be a scene , it could be a plot , it could be a subplot , [ ... ] it could be a line of dialogue " — so that he could use that list as the basis of a new screenplay made from all the best aspects of the previous ones . To offset fan expectation that Spock would die , Meyer had the character " killed " in the Kobayashi Maru simulator in the opening scene . The effects company required a completed script in just 12 days . Meyer wrote the screenplay uncredited and for no pay before the deadline , surprising the actors and producers , and rapidly produced subsequent rewrites as necessary . One draft , for example , had a baby in Khan 's group , who is killed with the others in the Genesis detonation . Meyer later said : 
 The chief contribution I brought to ' Star Trek II ' was a healthy disrespect ... ' Star Trek ' was human allegory in a space format . That was both its strength and , ultimately , its weakness . I tried through irreverence to make them more human and a little less wooden . I didn 't insist that Captain Kirk go to the bathroom , but did ' Star Trek ' have to be so sanctified ? 
 Meyer described his script as " ' Hornblower ' in outer space " , utilizing nautical references and a swashbuckling atmosphere . ( Hornblower was an inspiration to Roddenberry and Shatner when making the show , although Meyer was unaware of this . ) Sallin was impressed with Meyer 's vision for the film : " His ideas brought dimension that broadened the scope of the material as we were working on it . " Gene Roddenberry disagreed with the script 's naval texture and Khan 's Captain Ahab undertones , but was mostly ignored by the creative team . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 Meyer attempted to change the look of Star Trek to match the nautical atmosphere he envisioned and stay within budget . The Enterprise , for example , was given a ship 's bell , boatswain 's call , and more blinking lights and signage . To save money on set design , production designer Joseph Jennings used existing elements from The Motion Picture that had been left standing after filming was completed . Sixty @-@ five percent of the film was shot on the same set ; the bridge of the Reliant and the " bridge simulator " from the opening scene were redresses of the Enterprise 's bridge . The Klingon bridge from The Motion Picture was redressed as the transporter and torpedo rooms . The filmmakers stretched The Wrath of Khan 's budget by reusing models and footage from the first Star Trek film , including footage of the Enterprise in <unk> . The original ship miniatures were used where possible , or modified to stand in as new constructions . The orbital office complex from The Motion Picture was inverted and retouched to become the Regula I space station . Elements of the cancelled Star Trek : Phase II television show , such as bulkheads , railings , and sets , were cannibalized and reused . A major concern for the designers was that the Reliant should be easily distinguishable from the Enterprise . The ship 's design was flipped after Bennett accidentally opened and approved the preliminary Reliant designs upside @-@ down . 
 Designer Robert Fletcher was brought in to redesign existing costumes and create new ones . Fletcher decided on a scheme of " corrupt colors " , using materials with colors slightly off from the pure color . " They 're not colors you see today , so in a subtle way their [ sic ] indicate another time . " Meyer did not like the Starfleet uniforms from either the television series or The Motion Picture and wanted them changed , but for budgetary reasons they could not be discarded entirely . Dye tests of the fabric showed that the old uniforms took three colors well : blue @-@ gray , gold , and dark red . Fletcher decided to use the dark red due to the strong contrast it provided with the background . The resulting naval @-@ inspired designs would be used in Star Trek films until 1996 's First Contact . The first versions of the uniforms had stiff black collars , but Sallin suggested changing it to a turtleneck , using a form of vertical quilting called <unk> . The method creates a bas @-@ relief effect to the material by stuffing the outlined areas with soft thread shot via air pressure through a hollow needle . By the time of The Wrath of Khan 's production , the machines and needles needed to produce <unk> were rare , and Fletcher was only able to find one needle for the wardrobe department . The crew was so worried about losing or breaking the needle that one of the department 's workers took it home with him as a security measure , leading Fletcher to think it had been stolen . 
 For Khan and his followers , Fletcher created a strong contrast with the highly organized Starfleet uniforms ; his idea was that the exiles ' costumes were made out of whatever they could find . Fletcher said , " My intention with Khan was to express the fact that they had been marooned on that planet with no technical infrastructure , so they had to cannibalize from the spaceship whatever they used or wore . Therefore , I tried to make it look as if they had dressed themselves out of pieces of upholstery and electrical equipment that composed the ship . " Khan 's costume was designed with an open chest to show Ricardo Montalbán 's physique . Fletcher also designed smocks for the Regula I scientists , and civilian clothes for Kirk and McCoy that were designed to look practical and comfortable . 
 Meyer had a " No Smoking " sign added to the Enterprise 's bridge , which he recalled " Everyone had a fit over [ ... ] I said ' Why have they stopped smoking in the future ? They 've been smoking for four hundred years , you think it 's going to stop in the next two ? " The sign appeared in the first shot of the film , but was removed for all others appearing in the final cut of the film . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Principal photography began on November 9 , 1981 , and ended on January 29 , 1982 . The Wrath of Khan was more action @-@ oriented than its predecessor , but less costly to make . The project was supervised by Paramount 's television unit rather than its theatrical division . Bennett , a respected television veteran , made The Wrath of Khan on a budget of $ 11 million — far less than The Motion Picture 's $ 46 million . The budget was initially lower at $ 8 @.@ 5 million , but it rose when the producers were impressed by the first two weeks of footage . Meyer used camera and set tricks to spare the construction of large and expensive sets . For a scene taking place at Starfleet Academy , a forced perspective was created by placing scenery close to the camera to give the sense the set was larger than it really was . To present the illusion that the Enterprise 's elevators moved between decks , corridor pieces were wheeled out of sight to change the hall configuration while the lift doors were closed . Background equipment such as computer terminals were rented when possible instead of purchased outright . Some designed props , such as a redesigned phaser and communicator , were vetoed by Paramount executives in favor of existing materials from The Motion Picture . 
 The Enterprise was refurbished for its space shots , with its shiny exterior dulled down and extra detail added to the frame . Compared to the newly built Reliant , the Enterprise was hated by the effects artists and cameramen ; it took eight people to mount the model , and a forklift truck to move it . The Reliant , meanwhile , was lighter and had less complex internal wiring . The ships were filmed on a blue screen with special film that does not register the color ; the resulting shots could be added to effects shots or other footage . Any reflection of blue on the ship 's hull would appear as a hole on the film ; the gaps had to be patched frame by frame for the final film . The same camera used to film Star Wars , the <unk> , was used for shots of the Enterprise and other ships . 
 The barren desert surface of Ceti Alpha V was simulated on stage 8 , the largest sound stage at Paramount 's studio . The set was elevated 25 feet off the ground and covered in wooden mats , over which tons of colored sand and powder were dumped . A cyclorama was painted and wrapped around the set , while massive industrial fans created a sandstorm . The filming was uncomfortable for actors and crew alike . The spandex environmental suits Koenig and Winfield wore were unventilated , and the actors had to signal by microphone when they needed air . Filming equipment was wrapped in plastic to prevent mechanical troubles and everyone on set wore boots , masks , and coveralls as protection from flying sand . 
 Spock 's death was shot over three days , during which no visitors were allowed on set . Spock 's death was to be irrevocable , but Nimoy had such a positive experience during filming that he asked if he could add a way for Spock to return in a later film . The mind meld sequence was initially filmed without Kelley 's prior knowledge of what was going on . Shatner disagreed with having a clear glass separation between Spock and Kirk during the death scene ; he instead wanted a translucent divider allowing viewers to see only Spock 's silhouette , but his objection was overruled . During Spock 's funeral sequence Meyer wanted the camera to track the torpedo that served as Spock 's coffin as it was placed in a long trough and slid into the launcher . The camera crew thought the entire set would have to be rebuilt to accommodate the shot , but Sallin suggested putting a dolly into the trough and controlling it from above with an offset arm . Scott 's rendition of " Amazing Grace " on the bagpipes was James Doohan 's idea . Kathleen Nicholson Graham recorded the bagpipes music at Paramount Studio with the orchestra . 
 Spock 's death in the film was widely reported during production . " Trekkies " wrote letters to protest , one paid for trade press advertisements urging Paramount to change the plot , and Nimoy even received death threats . Test audiences reacted badly to Spock 's death and the film 's ending 's dark tone , so it was made more uplifting by Bennett . The scene of Spock 's casket on the planet and Nimoy 's closing monologue were added ; Meyer objected , but did not stand in the way of the modifications . Nimoy did not know about the scene until he saw the film , but before it opened , the media reassured fans that " Spock will live " again . Due to time constraints , the casket scene was filmed in an overgrown corner of San Francisco 's Golden Gate Park , using smoke machines to add a primal atmosphere . The shoot lasted from midday to evening , as the team was well aware there would be no time for reshoots . 
 Special consideration was given during filming to allow for integration of the planned special effects . Television monitors standing in for computer displays were specially calibrated so that their refresh rate did not result in banding on film . Due to a loss of resolution and quality resulting from <unk> an element in an optical printer , live action sequences for effects were shot in 65mm or VistaVision formats to compensate . When the larger prints were reduced through an anamorphic lens on the printer , the result was a Panavision composite . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 With a short timeframe to complete The Wrath of Khan 's special effects sequences , effects supervisor Jim Veilleux , Meyer , Jennings , Sallin , and Minor worked to transform the written ideas for the script into concrete storyboards and visuals . The detailed sequences were essential to keep the film 's effects from spiraling out of control and driving up costs , as had occurred with The Motion Picture . Each special and optical effect , and the duration of the sequences , was listed . By the end of six weeks , the producers determined the basic look and construction of nearly all the effects ; the resulting shots were combined with film footage five months later . Industrial Light & Magic ( ILM ) produced many of the effects , and created the new models ; the Reliant was the first non @-@ Constitution @-@ class Federation starship seen in the series . Originally , the Reliant was supposed to be a Constitution @-@ class starship identical to the Enterprise , but it was felt audiences would have difficulty distinguishing between the two ships . As the script called for the Reliant and Enterprise to inflict significant damage on each other , ILM developed techniques to illustrate the damage without physically harming the models . Rather than move the models on a bluescreen during shooting , the VistaVision camera was panned and tracked to give the illusion of movement . Damage to the Enterprise was cosmetic , and simulated with pieces of aluminum that were colored or peeled off . Phaser damage was created using stop motion . The script called for large @-@ scale damage to the Reliant , so larger versions of the ship 's model were created to be blown up . 
 The battle in the nebula was a difficult sequence to accomplish without the aid of computer @-@ generated models . The swirling nebula was created by injecting a latex rubber and ammonia mixture into a cloud tank filled with fresh and salt water . All the footage was shot at two frames per second to give the illusion of faster movement . The vibrant abstract colors of the nebula were simulated by lighting the tank using colored gels . Additional light effects such as auroras were created by the ILM animation department . Using matte work , the ships were physically stuck on a background plate to complete the shot . The destruction of the Reliant 's engine nacelle was created by superimposing shots of the engine blowing apart and explosions over the model . 
 The scene in which Terrell kills <unk> , a Regula scientist , by vaporizing him with a phaser was filmed in two takes . Winfield and the related actors first played out the scene ; this footage became the background plate . A blue screen was wheeled onto the set and actor John Vargas , the recipient of the phaser blast , acted out his response to being hit with the energy weapon . A phaser beam element was placed on top of the background plate , and Vargas ' shots were optically dissolved into an airbrushed disintegration effect which matched Vargas ' position in every frame . 
 The Ceti eel shots used several models , overseen by visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston , who had just finished creature design for Return of the Jedi . He tied a string to the eels to inch the models across the actors ' faces before they entered the ear canal . The scene of a more mature eel 's leaving Chekov 's ear was simulated by threading a <unk> through the floor of the set up to Koenig 's ear . The scene was filmed with three variations , which Ralston described as " a dry shot , one with some blood , and the Fangoria shot , with a lot of gore . " Footage of a giant model of Koenig 's ear was discarded from the theatrical release due to the visceral reaction it elicited in test audiences . 
 Additional optical effects were provided by Visual Concept Engineering ( VCE ) , a small effects company headed by Peter Kuran ; Kuran had previously worked at ILM and left after finishing The Empire Strikes Back . VCE provided effects including phaser beams , the Enterprise reactor , additional sand on Ceti Alpha V , and an updated transporter effect . Meyer and the production staff were adamant about not using freeze frames for the transporter , as had been done in the original television series . Scenes were shot so that conversations would continue while characters were in mid @-@ transport , although much of the matte work VCE created was discarded when the production decided not to have as much action during transports . 
 The Wrath of Khan was one of the first films to extensively use electronic images and computer graphics to speed production of shots . Computer graphics company Evans & Sutherland produced the vector graphics displays aboard the Enterprise and the fields of stars used in the opening credits . Among ILM 's technical achievements was cinema 's first entirely computer @-@ generated sequence : the demonstration of the effects of the Genesis Device on a barren planet . The first concept for the shot took the form of a laboratory demonstration , where a rock would be placed in a chamber and turned into a flower . Veilleux suggested the sequence 's scope be expanded to show the Genesis effect taking over a planet . While Paramount appreciated the more dramatic presentation , they also wanted the simulation to be more impressive than traditional animation . Having seen research done by Lucasfilm 's Computer Graphics group , Veilleux offered them the task . The graphics team paid attention to detail for the sixty @-@ second sequence ; one artist ensured that the stars visible in the background matched those visible from a real star light @-@ years from Earth . The animators hoped it would serve as a " commercial " for the studio 's talents . The studio would later branch off from Lucasfilm to form Pixar . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Jerry Goldsmith had composed the music for The Motion Picture , but was not an option for The Wrath of Khan given the reduced budget ; Meyer 's composer for Time After Time , Miklós Rózsa , was likewise prohibitively expensive . Bennett and Meyer wanted the music for the film to go in a different direction , but had not decided on a composer by the time filming began . Meyer initially hoped to hire an associate named John Morgan , but Morgan lacked film experience , which would have troubled the studio . 
 Paramount 's vice @-@ president of music Joel Sill took a liking to a 28 @-@ year @-@ old composer named James Horner , feeling that his demo tapes stood out from generic film music . Horner was introduced to Bennett , Meyer and <unk> . Horner said that " [ The producers ] did not want the kind of score they had gotten before . They did not want a John Williams score , per se . They wanted something different , more modern . " When asked about how he landed the assignment , the composer replied that " the producers loved my work for Wolfen , and had heard my music for several other projects , and I think , so far as I 've been told , they liked my versatility very much . I wanted the assignment , and I met with them , we all got along well , they were impressed with my music , and that 's how it happened . " Horner agreed with the producers ' expectations and agreed to begin work in mid @-@ January 1982 . 
 In keeping with the nautical tone , Meyer wanted music evocative of seafaring and swashbuckling , and the director and composer worked together closely , becoming friends in the process . As a classical music fan , Meyer was able to describe the effects and sounds he wanted in the music . While Horner 's style was described as " echoing both the bombastic and elegiac elements of John Williams ' Star Wars and Goldsmith 's original Star Trek ( The Motion Picture ) scores , " Horner was expressly told to not use any of Goldsmith 's score . Instead Horner adapted the opening fanfare of Alexander Courage 's Star Trek television theme . " The fanfare draws you in immediately — you know you 're going to get a good movie , " Horner said . 
 In comparison to the flowing main theme , Khan 's leitmotif was designed as a percussive texture that could be overlaid with other music and emphasized the character 's insanity . The seven @-@ note brass theme was <unk> to emphasize the character 's ruminations about the past while on Ceti Alpha V , but does not play fully until Reliant 's attack on the Enterprise . Many elements drew from Horner 's previous work ( a rhythm that accompanies Khan 's theme during the surprise attack borrows from an attack theme from Wolfen , in turn influenced by Goldsmith 's score for Alien ) . Musical moments from the original television series are also heard during investigation of the Regula space station and elsewhere . 
 To Horner , the " stuff underneath " the main story was what needed to be addressed by the score ; in The Wrath of Khan , this was the relationship between Kirk and Spock . The main theme serves as Kirk 's theme , with a mellower section following that is the theme for the Starship Enterprise . Horner also wrote a motif for Spock , to emphasize the character 's depth : " By putting a theme over Spock , it warms him and he becomes three @-@ dimensional rather than a collection of <unk> . " The difference in the short , French horn @-@ based cues for the villain and longer melodies for the heroes helped to differentiate characters and ships during the battle sequences . 
 The soundtrack was Horner 's first major film score , and was written in four and a half weeks . The resulting 72 minutes of music was then performed by a 91 @-@ piece orchestra . Recording sessions for the score began on April 12 , 1982 at the Warner Bros. lot , The Burbank Studios and continued until April 15 . A pickup session was held on April 30 to record music for the Mutara nebula battle , while another session held on May 3 was used to cover the recently changed epilogue . Horner used synthesizers for ancillary effects ; at the time , science fiction films such as E.T. the Extra @-@ Terrestrial and The Thing were eschewing the synthesizer in favor of more traditional orchestras . Craig Huxley performed his invented instrument — the Blaster Beam — during recording , as well as composing and performing electronic music for the Genesis Project video . While most of the film was " locked in " by the time Horner had begun composing music , he had to change musical cue orchestration after the integration of special effects caused changes in scene durations . 
 = = Themes = = 
 The Wrath of Khan features several recurring themes , including death , resurrection , and growing old . Upon writing his script , Meyer hit upon a link between Spock 's death and the age of the characters . " This was going to be a story in which Spock died , so it was going to be a story about death , and it was only a short hop , skip , and a jump to realize that it was going to be about old age and friendship , " Meyer said . " I don 't think that any of [ the other preliminary ] scripts were about old age , friendship , and death . " In keeping with the theme of death and rebirth symbolized by Spock 's sacrifice and the Genesis Device , Meyer wanted to call the film The Undiscovered Country , in reference to Prince Hamlet 's description of death in William Shakespeare 's Hamlet , but the title was changed during editing without his knowledge . Meyer disliked Wrath of Khan , but it was chosen because the preferred Vengeance of Khan conflicted with Lucasfilm 's forthcoming Revenge of the Jedi ( renamed Return of the Jedi late in production ) . 
 The Wrath of Khan follows in a long tradition of films in which the adventurer or explorer must undergo a figurative or literal death to start anew . Spock is Kirk 's doppelgänger and together they represent a bifurcated hero , with the two characters representing dueling halves of the human condition . Spock represents the supernatural ideal of a completely logical and infallible person , while Kirk represents the impassioned and human reality , prone to error and at odds with himself . Spock 's sacrifice at the end of the film allows for Kirk 's spiritual rebirth in the tradition of the death @-@ rebirth cycle . After commenting earlier that he feels old and worn out , Kirk states in the final scene that " I feel young . " The Kobayashi Maru test forces its participants to confront an unwinnable situation which serves as a test of character , but Kirk reveals that he won the test by cheating ; Saavik responds that Kirk has never faced death . Spock 's own solution to the no @-@ win scenario , that of self @-@ sacrifice , forces Kirk to confront death after continually cheating it , and to grow as a character . Sight and sound reinforce the themes of death and aging , as well as the promise of rebirth ; Spock is the first character seen and his voice is the last heard , and his coffin follows the same trajectory towards the new planet as the Genesis Device does in a video lecture earlier in the film . The principle of sacrificing the needs of the one for those of the many was translated to modern triage via the ' Spock principle ' . 
 Meyer added elements to reinforce the aging of the characters . Kirk 's unhappiness about his birthday is compounded by McCoy 's gift of reading glasses . The script stated that Kirk was 49 , but Shatner was unsure about being specific about Kirk 's age . Bennett remembers that Shatner was hesitant about portraying a middle @-@ aged version of himself , and believed that with proper makeup he could continue playing a younger Kirk . Bennett convinced Shatner that he could age gracefully like Spencer Tracy ; the producer did not know that Shatner had worked with Tracy on Judgment at Nuremberg ( 1961 ) , and was fond of the actor . Meyer made sure to emphasize Kirk 's parallel to Sherlock Holmes in that both characters waste away in the absence of their stimuli ; new cases , in Holmes ' case , and starship adventures in Kirk 's . 
 Khan 's pursuit of Kirk is central to the film 's theme of vengeance , and The Wrath of Khan deliberately borrows heavily from Herman Melville 's Moby @-@ Dick . To make the parallels clear to viewers , Meyer added a visible copy of Moby @-@ Dick to Khan 's dwelling . Khan liberally paraphrases Ahab , with " I 'll chase him round the moons of <unk> and round the Antares maelstrom and round perdition 's flames before I give him up ! " . Khan also quotes Ahab 's tirade at the end of the novel verbatim with his final lines : " to the last I grapple with thee ; from Hell 's heart I stab at thee ; for hate 's sake , I spit my last breath at thee . " Kirk represents both the restless elements of Ishmael as well as the titular white whale of Melville 's novel ; Khan 's blind pursuit of Kirk mirrors Captain Ahab 's obsession with Moby @-@ Dick . Both Khan and Ahab pursue their quarry against the better judgment of their crew , and end up killing themselves in an effort to take their foe with them . University of Northern Colorado professor Jane Wall Hinds argues that the themes of The Wrath of Khan clash with the optimistic and transcendentalist perspectives of the original series and The Next Generation . Moby Dick 's themes of vengeance would later heavily influence Star Trek : First Contact .

 The Wrath of Khan opened on June 4 , 1982 in 1 @,@ 621 theaters in the United States . It made $ 14 @,@ 347 @,@ 221 in its opening weekend , at the time the largest opening weekend gross in history .

Although the total gross of The Wrath of Khan was less than that of The Motion Picture , it was more profitable due to its lower production cost . The film 's novelization , written by Vonda N. McIntyre , stayed on the New York Times paperback bestsellers list for more than three weeks . Unlike the previous film , Wrath of Khan was not promoted with a toy line , although Playmates Toys created Khan and Saavik figures in the 1990s , and in 2007 Art Asylum crafted a full series of action figures to mark the film 's 25th anniversary . In 2009 IDW Publishing released a comic adaptation of the film , and Film Score Monthly released an expanded score . 
 = = = Critical response = = = 
 Critical response was positive . Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 88 % of selected critics have given the film a positive review based on a sample of 49 . After the lukewarm reaction to the first film , fan response to The Wrath of Khan was highly positive . The film 's success was credited with renewing interest in the franchise . Mark Bernardin of Entertainment Weekly went further , calling The Wrath of Khan " the film that , by most accounts , saved Star Trek as we know it " ; it is now considered one of the best films in the series . 
 The film 's pacing was praised by reviewers in The New York Times and The Washington Post as being much swifter than its predecessor and closer to that of the television series . Janet Maslin of The New York Times credited the film with a stronger story than The Motion Picture and stated the sequel was everything the first film should have been . Variety agreed that The Wrath of Khan was closer to the original spirit of Star Trek than its predecessor . Strong character interaction was cited as a strong feature of the film , as was Montalbán 's portrayal of Khan . In 2016 , Playboy ranked the film number four on its list of 15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals . 
 Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times and Derek Adams of Time Out complained about what were seen as tepid battle sequences , and perceived melodrama . While Ebert and TV Guide felt that Spock 's death was dramatic and well @-@ handled , The Washington Post 's Gary Arnold stated Spock 's death " feels like an unnecessary twist , and the filmmakers are obviously well @-@ prepared to fudge in case the public demands another sequel . " Negative reviews of the film also focused on the acting , and Empire singled out the " dodgy <unk> " and " Santa Claus tunics " as elements of the film that had not aged well . 
 The Wrath of Khan won two Saturn Awards in 1982 , for best actor ( Shatner ) and best direction ( Meyer ) . The film was also nominated in the " best dramatic presentation " category for the 1983 Hugo Awards , but lost to Blade Runner . The Wrath of Khan has influenced later movies : Meyer 's rejected title for the film , The Undiscovered Country , was finally put to use when Meyer directed the sixth film , which retained the nautical influences . Director Bryan Singer cited the film as an influence on X2 and his abandoned sequel to Superman Returns . The film is also a favorite of director J. J. Abrams , producer Damon Lindelof and writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman , the creative team behind the franchise relaunch film Star Trek .

 Paramount released The Wrath of Khan on VHS and Beta in 1983 . The studio sold the VHS for $ 39 @.@ 95 , $ 40 below contemporary movie cassette prices . It needed to sell 60 @,@ 000 tapes to make the film as profitable as other tapes , but sold 120 @,@ 000 . The successful experiment was credited with instigating more competitive VHS pricing , an increase in the adoption of increasingly cheaper VHS players , and an industry @-@ wide move away from rentals to sales as the bulk of videotape revenue . 
 Paramount released The Wrath of Khan on DVD in 2000 ; no special features were included on the disc . Montalbán drew hundreds of fans of the film to Universal City , California where he signed copies of the DVD to commemorate its release . In August 2002 , the film was re @-@ released in a highly anticipated two @-@ disc " Director 's Edition " format . In addition to remastered picture quality and 5 @.@ 1 Dolby surround sound , the DVD set included director commentary , cast interviews , storyboards and the theatrical trailer . The expanded cut of the film was given a Hollywood premiere before the release of the DVD . Meyer stated that he didn 't believe directors ' cuts of films were necessarily better than the original but that the re @-@ release gave him a chance to add elements that had been removed from the theatrical release by Paramount . The four hours of bonus content and expanded director 's cut were favorably received . 
 The film 's original theatrical cut was released on Blu @-@ ray Disc in May 2009 to coincide with the new Star Trek feature , along with the other five films featuring the original crew in Star Trek : Original Motion Picture Collection . Of all six original films , Wrath of Khan was the only one to be remastered in 1080p high @-@ definition from the original negative . Nicholas Meyer stated that the Wrath of Khan negative " was in terrible shape , " which is why it needed extensive restoration . All six films in the set have new 7 @.@ 1 Dolby TrueHD audio . The disc also features a new commentary track by director Nicholas Meyer and Star Trek : Enterprise showrunner Manny Coto . On April 24 , 2016 , Paramount Pictures announced the Director 's Edition of the film would be released for Blu @-@ ray Disc on June 7 , 2016 . 
 = Number 13 @-@ class battleship = 
 The Number 13 @-@ class battleship was a planned class of four fast battleships to be built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) during the 1920s . The ships never received any names , being known only as Numbers 13 – 16 . They were intended to reinforce Japan 's " eight @-@ eight fleet " of eight battleships and eight battlecruisers after the United States announced a major naval construction program in 1919 . The Number 13 class was designed to be superior to all other existing battleships , planned or building . After the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922 , they were cancelled in November 1923 before construction could begin . 
 = = Design and background = = 
 By 1918 , the Navy had gained approval for an " eight @-@ six " fleet , all ships under eight years old . However , having four large battleships and four battlecruisers on order put an enormous financial strain on Japan , which was spending about a third of its national budget on the Navy . Despite this , the IJN gained approval of the " eight @-@ eight @-@ eight " plan in 1920 after American President Woodrow Wilson announced plans in 1919 to re @-@ initiate the 1916 plan for ten additional battleships and six battlecruisers . The Japanese response required the construction of eight additional fast battleships in the Kii and the Number 13 classes . 
 When designing the latter class , the Japanese followed the doctrine that they had used since the First Sino @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 95 of compensating for quantitative inferiority with qualitative superiority . In the words of naval historian Siegfried Breyer , " had [ the ships ] been completed , they would have been the world 's largest and most powerful battleships . Their gun calibre alone would have caused a new and more intensive naval arms race . From an engineering aspect they were more than ten years ahead of their time because they anticipated the characteristics of the fully developed , fast battleship . " Naval architects William Garzke and Robert Dulin concur saying , " These ships would have completely outclassed any European battleship " . 
 The Number 13 class was designed by Captain Yuzuru Hiraga , the naval architect responsible for most of the previous Japanese capital ships . The ships were based on his previous Kii @-@ class battleship and Amagi @-@ class battlecruiser designs , enlarged to take 457 @-@ millimeter ( 18 @.@ 0 in ) guns . 
 = = = Description = = = 
 The ships had a length of 259 @.@ 1 meters ( 850 ft 1 in ) between perpendiculars and 274 @.@ 4 meters ( 900 ft 3 in ) overall . They had a beam of 30 @.@ 8 meters ( 101 ft 1 in ) and a draft of 9 @.@ 8 meters ( 32 ft 2 in ) . The normal displacement of the battleships was 47 @,@ 500 metric tons ( 46 @,@ 700 long tons ) . 
 The class was intended to be equipped with four <unk> @-@ Hombu geared steam turbines , each of which drove one propeller shaft . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 150 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 110 @,@ 000 kW ) , using steam provided by 22 Kampon oil @-@ fired water @-@ tube boilers , to reach a maximum speed of 30 knots ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) . 
 The primary armament of the Number 13 class was eight 45 @-@ caliber 457 @-@ millimeter guns in four twin @-@ gun turrets , two each fore and aft of the superstructure . No examples of this gun were ever built , but it was planned to fire a 1 @,@ 550 @-@ kilogram ( 3 @,@ 420 lb ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 800 meters per second ( 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ) . The secondary battery consisted of 16 single 50 @-@ caliber 14 @-@ centimeter guns was mounted in casemates in the superstructure . The manually operated guns had a maximum range of 19 @,@ 750 meters ( 21 @,@ 600 yd ) at an elevation of + 35 ° and fired at a rate up to 10 rounds per minute . The ships ' anti @-@ aircraft defenses consisted of either four or eight single 45 @-@ caliber 12 @-@ centimeter 10th Year Type anti @-@ aircraft guns mounted around the single funnel . Each of these guns had a maximum elevation of + 75 ° and a maximum rate of fire of 10 – 11 rounds per minute . They could fire a 20 @.@ 41 @-@ kilogram ( 45 @.@ 0 lb ) projectile with a muzzle velocity of 825 – 830 m / s ( 2 @,@ 710 – 2 @,@ 720 ft / s ) to a maximum height of 10 @,@ 000 meters ( 32 @,@ 808 ft ) . The Number 13 class was also designed with eight 61 @-@ centimeter ( 24 in ) above @-@ water torpedo tubes , four on each broadside . 
 The waterline armor belt was intended have a maximum thickness of 330 millimeters ( 13 in ) and , like the Kii class , it was angled 15 ° outwards at the top to increase its ability to resist penetration at short range . The deck armor would have had a total thickness of 127 millimeters ( 5 in ) .

 After the end of World War I , the United Kingdom , the United States and the Empire of Japan all announced large capital ship building programs , incorporating design lessons from the war . These ships would have been much larger and more expensive than earlier vessels and President Warren G. Harding called a conference at Washington , D. C. in late 1921 to forestall a very expensive arms race . The attendees at the conference agreed to limit capital ship construction for the next decade and scrapped large numbers of existing ships as well as many ships still under construction . Japan suspended the Number 13 class while the conference was in progress before any ship was laid down and formally cancelled them on 19 November 1923 . As construction of the ships was scheduled to begin in 1922 , and completed by 1927 , they were already allocated to specific shipyards :

 = Rhys Lawson = 
 Rhys Lawson is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours , played by Ben Barber . The actor 's casting was announced on 18 May 2011 and he began filming his first scenes the week before opposite established cast members Alan Fletcher ( Karl Kennedy ) and Jackie Woodburne ( Susan Kennedy ) . Barber said he loved his character and was looking forward to what was ahead . He made his debut screen appearance on 13 July 2011 . In November 2012 , it was announced that Barber would be leaving Neighbours and Rhys made his last screen appearance on 20 March 2013 . 
 Before his arrival on screen , Barber described Rhys as being determined and focused , while Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy said his arrival would cause a stir . Rhys is ambitious , persuasive and manipulative . His profile on the official Neighbours website states that he believes Erinsborough is " a bit of a backwater " , while he is more of a city guy . Rhys is an enthusiastic young doctor and often riles his colleague , Karl , in his quest to become a surgeon . He wants to succeed and can justify why he does certain things , which hurt other people . Rhys is good at separating his work life from his home life and he knows how to have a good time . Barber revealed that Rhys does have a sensitive side and he can mean well . 
 One of the character 's earliest storylines saw him becoming caught up in Karl and Susan Kennedy 's marital problems , while treating their friend , Jim Dolan ( Scott Parmeter ) . Rhys was with Jim when he died and he remained affected by his death for a long time . Rhys had a one @-@ night stand with Kate Ramsay ( Ashleigh Brewer ) , which left Kate feeling awkward around him . Rhys became determined to join the hospital 's surgical training programme and was devastated when he missed out on a place . Rhys then romantically pursued Erin Salisbury ( Elise Jansen ) and through his manipulative behaviour he forced her to quit the programme . Exploration of the character 's backstory began after his mother was introduced and Barber believed this would allow the audience to see why Rhys has become who he is .

 On 18 May 2011 , it was announced Barber had joined the cast of Neighbours as Rhys Lawson . His casting announcement came as the show lost regular cast member Scott McGregor ( Mark Brennan ) . Barber was appearing in a small guest role in fellow Australian soap opera Home and Away when he was given the role of Rhys . He began filming his first scenes for Neighbours opposite Alan Fletcher ( Karl Kennedy ) and Jackie Woodburne ( Susan Kennedy ) the week before his casting announcement . Of appearing in Neighbours , the actor told Matt Neal of The Warrnambool Standard " I catch myself and have a moment where I realise that I 'm working with actors I watched on TV growing up . My first scenes were with Alan and Jackie . It was great to have them there to help out and show me how it 's done . I was in safe hands . " Barber revealed he loved his character and was looking forward to what was ahead . He made his first on screen appearance as Rhys in July 2011 .

 " Rhys is a real city guy , and thinks Erinsborough is a bit of a backwater . He is career focused , driven and determined to be a surgeon — and he doesn 't care who he has to tread on to get there . " 
 Shortly after his casting was announced , Barber told a reporter for the Herald Sun that he loved his character and said his determination and focus would get him into trouble . Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy said Rhys 's arrival would cause a stir in Erinsborough and may not go down well with some of the local residents . Barber also called Rhys ambitious and said that while he is not a villain , he is not an entirely good guy either . The actor explained " He rides that line and that 's a lot of fun to play . There are a lot of different dynamics . He can be very persuasive , bordering on manipulative , but he has a sensitive side as well , which is coming out gradually . " Barber told a writer for Inside Soap that Rhys is good at separating his work life from his home life , and can easily switch from one to the other . Barber quipped that Rhys knows how to have a good time , while the official Neighbours website said he considers himself " a bit of a ladies ' man " . A Herald Sun reporter said Rhys would " rile " his colleague , Karl Kennedy . Alan Fletcher , who plays Karl , revealed that his character and Rhys would share many scenes . Fletcher explained that it can be " somewhat galling " for Karl to be faced with Rhys , who is an enthusiastic young doctor . The actor added " So expect some fun confrontation but also cleverly the writers have explored what Rhys and Karl might have in common . " 
 When asked what advice he would give to his character , Barber said " Unfortunately , I don 't think he would listen to me in the first place , but if he could give me the time of day , I would say lighten up on the control because you ’ re never going to have it . " Speaking to Channel 5 , Barber revealed Rhys would not do a lot to redeem himself in the new year , but viewers would get learn more about his back story , which could explain his dark side . During a 2012 interview with Kilkelly , Barber said his character is good at getting what he wants , saying " I think at the end of the day , he just wants to win and he has this ability to justify why he does things , and if people are hurt in the process , it 's their fault . His vision is the one that is most important . " Barber said that deep down , Rhys is sensitive and he means well . When asked about the reaction Rhys has received from viewers , Barber believed they liked the character as he is unpredictable and manipulative . He added that the viewers are interested in seeing what Rhys does next . When asked how he felt about playing a bad boy by DNA 's Matthew Myers , Barber revealed that he loved it , saying " It 's always exciting getting the scripts because I never know which way they are going to turn or who I 'm going to be turning on ! " The actor quipped that he is always wondering which character he is going to manipulate or " screw over " next and added " But at the core of things Rhys has a heart of gold . " 
 = = = Family = = = 
 Rhys ' mother , Elaine ( <unk> Robinson ) , was introduced in November 2011 . Barber revealed in his interview with Kilkelly that their backstory would be explored and stated that it would explain " a lot more about why Rhys is the way he is " . He added that there would be " a big revelation " about Elaine coming up . Elaine suffers from a degenerative spinal condition and has to use a wheelchair . Rhys was forced to care for her when his father ran out on them both . Rhys tries to keep his life on Ramsay Street separate from his family , so when Elaine asks him if she can spend Easter with him , he makes up excuses as to why she cannot visit him . Barber revealed to an Inside Soap writer that Elaine realises Rhys is lying to her and she starts to wonder if he is ashamed to be seen with her . Rhys ' actions when his housemates arrive appear to confirm his mother 's suspicions . While they wonder who Elaine is , he makes up an excuse . Barber explained " Rhys pretends he 's visiting one of his patients . Elaine is really hurt and embarrassed when he comes out with that . He realises , and feels terrible . " 
 Rhys tries to make things up to Elaine by taking her to the hospital to meet his colleagues , but when she questions his motives for " going public " and admitting who she is , Rhys has to look at himself and his attitude towards her . In a May 2012 interview with Inside Soap 's Jason Herbison , Barber said he liked the fact that Rhys ' mother had been introduced and that he had the chance to learn more about his character 's background . He expressed his wish of having Rhys ' father introduced in the future , saying " Rhys doesn 't have a good relationship with him , as his dad abandoned the family when he was younger .

 One of Rhys ' first storylines saw him caught up in Karl and Susan Kennedy 's marital problems . Rhys is the attending physician to Jim Dolan ( Scott Parmeter ) , a man befriended by Susan . At first , Rhys is not aware that Karl and Susan are going through a difficult time in their marriage as he is " solely concerned " with Jim 's well being . Rhys is annoyed by Susan 's interference with his patient and Barber told a columnist for Inside Soap " He wants him to have chemotherapy , but Karl tells Susan it will only prolong Jim 's suffering , not save his life . Susan tells that to Jim , which Rhys doesn 't like . " Karl later takes over as Jim 's physician and Rhys steps back and watches the situation unfold . Rhys is with Jim when he dies and a writer for the official Neighbours website said it is an event that will stay with him for a long time . 
 Rhys has a one @-@ night stand with Kate Ramsay ( Ashleigh Brewer ) not long after his introduction . Rhys meets Kate in the local bar and they have a " big night out " ; the following morning Kate wakes up in Rhys ' apartment . Brewer told a writer for Inside Soap " You don 't actually see the lead @-@ up – one minute she meets Rhys in a bar , the next minute we see that they 've already slept together ! " Kate feels awkward about the situation , but it is made worse when she is unable to remember Rhys ' name . When Kate and Rhys meet again , they have different attitudes to their one @-@ night stand . Brewer said Rhys is " a bit of a player " , so it is not a big deal to him . He does not have any expectations of Kate , but she is uncomfortable with it and tries to cover her tracks . In November 2011 , Brewer said it would be interesting to revisit the relationship between Rhys and Kate . Barber also thought it would be interesting to see where the characters could go together . The actor added that " sparks fly " when Rhys is around Kate , as he knows how to " press her buttons " . 
 = = = Surgical program = = = 
 Rhys becomes determined to join the hospital surgical program led by the head of surgery , Martin Chambers ( John Wood ) . When Karl makes a potentially dangerous mistake on a prescription form , Rhys covers for him , but makes it clear he wants something in return . Knowing Karl plays golf with Martin , Rhys asks to join their game so he can try and impress the surgeon . Despite being warned that Martin does not like to talk shop during his golf games , Rhys reveals that he has been following his career and Martin is impressed . Barber explained to a writer for Inside Soap " And Karl has no choice but to agree that Rhys is a good doctor . It 's a bit awkward , because Karl doesn 't like the way Rhys operates — so to speak ! " Martin grants Rhys an interview for a place on the surgical program ; however he forgets everything he knows and makes a fool of himself due to being hungover . Rhys misses out on a place on the program and Barber told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that he is feeling " devastated and desperate . " Barber described the position as the Holy Grail for Rhys and because of a stupid act , he has lost it . 
 Shortly after missing out on the program , Rhys finds himself performing surgery on Chris Pappas ( James Mason ) . Rhys initially treats Chris at the hospital after he is attacked at work by an unknown assailant . Chris refuses to stay for any further medical treatment and later collapses with a punctured lung . Barber said that as soon as Rhys sees Chris 's X @-@ rays , he " goes beyond the call of duty " to find him . The actor explained " When he finds him on the floor , he knows exactly what 's happened , but he isn 't sure how long he 's been unconscious for . For all he knows , Chris could be dead within the minute — so he goes straight into emergency mode . " In a bid to save Chris 's life , Rhys performs an emergency procedure to get him breathing again using a screwdriver and a piece of piping . Rhys should not be conducting any type of surgery as he is not a qualified surgeon , but he does not think of the consequences . All About Soap 's Laura Morgan said Rhys ' " quick thinking " pays off and Chris starts breathing again , but at the hospital Karl warns him he will be held accountable if Chris does not pull through . 
 Rhys tries unsuccessfully to get Robbie O 'Brien ( Shaun Goss ) to quit the surgical program . He then turns his attention to Erin Salisbury ( Elise Jansen ) and plots to take her spot on the program instead . He pursues Erin romantically and tries to distract her away from her work , so she will be kicked off the program and he can take her place . Barber said the scheme sees Rhys at his manipulative best , he realises Erin is vulnerable and he strikes . Jansen told a writer for TV Week that Erin is a bit reluctant to accept when Rhys asks her out . She thinks that someone like Rhys would not normally be interested in her , but she is flattered by the attention . Jansen added Erin is unaware it is all an act . Kate realises what Rhys is doing and interferes with his plan . Barber explained that Kate 's feelings about the matter means nothing to Rhys as his sole objective is to get into the program . He does not mind that Kate is appalled at Erin becoming a casualty of his scheme . 
 Rhys forces Erin to miss a class and Barber revealed that Rhys feels no guilt about what he has done . He quipped " His plan is falling into place perfectly . You 'll see that Kate later tries to tell Erin what Rhys is up to . But the guy is a charmer and is able to make Erin believe that Kate is the one with the problem . " Rhys manages to convince Erin that Kate is a jealous ex @-@ girlfriend and that he does not want her place on the program . Rhys charms Erin " into his bed " , but he is put out when she calls time on their relationship to focus on her studies . Rhys later learns Erin has turned up late for surgery and during dinner together , he spills wine on Erin 's top . When she turns up at the hospital , she smells of alcohol . Rhys then implies to Karl that she has a drinking problem . Barber explained " Rhys just has to plant the seed of doubt , fake some concern for his colleague , and rumour and innuendo does the rest ... " Erin quits the program , giving Rhys the chance to successfully apply for her place .

Rhys believes the father of her child , Lucas Fitzgerald ( Scott Major ) , is not " pulling his weight " and he starts looking out for her . Rhys helps Vanessa lift some heavy boxes and she offers to show him how to bake a cake to say thank you . A <unk> for All About Soap observed " While Vanessa sees it as mates having fun , it 's clear Rhys has got it bad ! " Rhys later returns to spend more time with Vanessa , which unnerves Lucas . Herbison commented that Rhys may have met his match in Vanessa , while Barber said her feistiness appeals to him . He stated " He finds her attractive , and she takes the mickey out of him - that 's good for Rhys . He needs to be knocked off his pedestal ! Vanessa also exposes a rare vulnerability in Rhys , so there 's a risk he could get hurt and lash out in other ways . " 
 The actor further explained that Rhys is not put off by the fact she is carrying another man 's child , he is attracted to her because of her " fire and passion " . Barber added " She also doesn 't play games and she says what she thinks . Rhys loves that about Vanessa and sees her as someone he can trust , which is rare for him . " Vanessa and Rhys eventually give into their attraction for one another and share a kiss in Harold 's Store . Barber commented that his character enjoys making the first move , so he is the one who goes in for the kiss . The actor also thought it would be interesting to see his character in a relationship . TV Week 's Andrew Mercado observed that Rhys should prepare for a bumpy road ahead , with Vanessa living under the same roof as Lucas . Rhys and Vanessa take their relationship to the next level in a consultation room at Erinsborough Hospital . However , they are shocked when Karl walks in on them . 
 When Rhys is offered the chance to apply for a three @-@ month work placement in Japan , he decides to apply and then convince Vanessa to go with him . Barber revealed " He puts himself and his heart on the line like he 's never done before . At first , Vanessa says no - and he 's devastated . He 's in a really vulnerable place and he doesn 't take her <unk> well . Rhys has been a bit of a ladies man all his life and he 's never really committed to someone before Vanessa . She 's a pretty special girl as far as Rhys is concerned . " Rhys becomes determined not to give up and he is " thrilled " when Vanessa changes her mind . Barber teased that it is possible viewers could see the last of Rhys and Vanessa for a while , adding " There are definitely interesting times ahead ! "

 = Cyclone Narelle = 
 Severe Tropical Cyclone Narelle was a Category 4 cyclone in early January 2013 that brought light rains to areas in South Australia suffering from a drought and heat wave . On 4 January , a tropical low developed within a monsoon trough over the Timor Sea . Over the following several days , the system gradually tracked westward and intensified , being classified Tropical Cyclone Narelle on 8 January . Turning southward into a region of low wind shear , Narelle intensified into a severe tropical cyclone on 9 January . Over the following two days , the cyclone 's structure fluctuated , temporarily featuring an eye , before it maintained its organisation and intensified further on 11 January . The storm attained its peak intensity later on 11 January as a Category 4 cyclone with winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . The following day , Narelle passed approximately 330 km ( 205 mi ) northwest of Exmouth as it moved on a south @-@ southwesterly course . The system steadily weakened and ultimately fell below tropical cyclone strength on 15 January well to the west of Geraldton . 
 Early in the storm 's existence , Narelle brought strong winds , heavy rain , and high winds to many areas in Indonesia . More than 10 @,@ 000 homes were flooded and many others were damaged by thunderstorms . A total of 14 people were killed by the storm , and 17 others were listed as missing . In Western Australia , scattered strong thunderstorms caused minor damage and produced a possible tornado .

 On 4 January , a weak area of low pressure developed within a monsoon trough near Timor . The following day , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) began monitoring the system for possible development into a tropical cyclone . Traveling westward , the system was forecast to intensify as it moved into an area highly favouring tropical cyclogenesis with very warm waters ( with sea surface temperatures of 30 to 31 ° C ( 86 to 88 ° F ) ) and low wind shear . Additionally , a nearby anticyclone provided good outflow for the system . Over the following two days , deep convection gradually built around the low and on 7 January , the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre ( TCWC ) in Darwin designated the system as Tropical Low <unk> , at which time the storm was situated roughly 135 km ( 85 mi ) south @-@ southeast of Sumba , Indonesia . By this time , the system was tracking west @-@ southwestward around a subtropical ridge , which would dictate the track of the storm for the remainder of its existence . Later on 7 January , the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system , indicating that further development of the low into a significant tropical cyclone was anticipated . Just seven hours after this , the JTWC classified the system as a tropical storm and began issuing advisories . 
 Through the morning of 8 January , weak wind shear hindered development of the system . After enough convection wrapped around the centre of circulation , the Australian Bureau of Meteorology classified the low as Tropical Cyclone Narelle , the second named storm in the western region during the 2012 – 13 season . Shortly thereafter , intensification quickened as a central dense overcast formed and prominent banding features consolidated . Following the development of an eye early on 9 January , the Bureau of Meteorology upgraded Narelle to a severe tropical cyclone , with winds estimated at 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . Over the following day , Narelle 's intensity leveled out as it encountered moderate wind shear . Once the shear relaxed , the system resumed strengthening . With conditions more favourable , Narelle redeveloped an eye and its outflow improved . Late on 11 January , Narelle is estimated to have attained its peak intensity with winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) and a barometric pressure of 930 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 46 inHg ) . Operationally , the storm was believed to have been slightly stronger , peaking as a Category 5 cyclone on the Australian scale . It was not until a post @-@ storm assessment that the Bureau of Meteorology found Narelle to have been a weaker system at its peak . At the same time , the JTWC assessed the storm to have attained one @-@ minute sustained winds of 215 km / h ( 130 mph ) , ranking it as a Category 4 @-@ equivalent cyclone on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane scale . 
 Hours after Narelle reached peak intensity , increasing wind shear caused the storm 's eyewall to erode and the outflow to become somewhat restricted . By the afternoon of 12 January , the storm 's structure had significantly degraded , with the eye no longer apparent and a marked decrease in cold cloud tops . Later that day , the cyclone made its closest approach to Western Australia , passing approximately 330 km ( 205 mi ) northwest of Exmouth . Despite shear eventually lightening up , the storm 's southerly course brought it over cooler waters , preventing restrengthening . Most of the deep convection shifted to the western side of Narelle 's circulation , though its centre remained well defined . By the evening of 13 January , the storm had weakened below severe tropical cyclone strength . Rapid weakening ensued on 14 January , as the effects of cooler waters and dry air caused the deep convection to dissociate into an area of shallow stratocumulus clouds . Narelle failed to redevelop deep convection and weakened below tropical cyclone status early on 15 January , prompting the Bureau of Meteorology to issue its final bulletin on the cyclone . The system was last observed about 500 km ( 310 mi ) west of Geraldton , where it continued southward away from Australia .

 On 9 January , the MV Emeline cargo vessel sank off the coast of Selayar Islands . Of the 17 crewmen , 6 were rescued and 11 others remained missing as of 16 January . Another vessel , the MV Angle , became stranded near West Lombok Regency . By 10 January , Narelle brought strong winds , heavy rains , and rough seas to the province of Bali in Indonesia . Residents and tourists were warned of waves up to 5 m ( 16 ft ) . Ferry service between Bali , West Nusa Tenggara , and Java was suspended , isolating residents in Nusa Penida , Nusa <unk> , and Nusa <unk> . Winds from the storm downed many trees and caused severe damage to structures across Bali , especially in the capital city of Denpasar . In <unk> Village , one person died after a tree fell on her . Trees and billboards were downed across Jakarta , and three homes were damaged . Flooding in the region closed several roads , leading to traffic delays more than 6 km ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) long . In Banten , heavy rains caused four major rivers in the province to overflow their banks , leading to flooding in 33 districts . A total of 10 @,@ 470 homes across the province were inundated , and four people were killed . In all , 14 people were killed and 6 others were listed as missing .

 After Narelle moved into TCWC Perth 's area of responsibility on 9 January , a cyclone watch was issued for areas between Whim Creek and Coral Bay . A blue alert , the Department of Fire and Emergency Services ( <unk> ) lowest level of readiness , was also issued for areas between Mardie and Whim Creek . The following day , the watch was upgraded to a cyclone warning for all areas and a new watch was issued to the west , encompassing areas as far as Cape Cuvier . The watch was further extended early on 11 January to include areas between Cape Cuvier and Carnarvon . As the storm continued on a more westward path than initially anticipated , the warning area was gradually decreased , with areas east of Roebourne receiving the all clear later on 11 January . The watch area , however , continued to expand and encompassed areas as far east as Denham . As the storm made its closet approach to Western Australia on 13 January , the watches and warnings area were gradually discontinued , with all advisories being discontinued that afternoon . 
 By 11 January , the Apache Corporation began evacuating all non @-@ essential personnel from oil rigs in the path of the storm . The Rio Tinto Group shut down iron exports at its Dampier and Cape Lambert ports due to rough seas . Across the Pilbara region , the State Emergency Service advised residents to secure loose objects and ensure their emergency kits were stocked . Incident management teams were also established to help people in the wake of the storm . Additionally , urban search and rescue equipment was set up in Karratha . Horizon Power dispatched additional linemen to the most at @-@ risk areas in Narelle 's path to speed up power restoration in the wake of the storm . In Carnarvon , mango producers picked as much of their fruit as possible before the storm arrived in order to minimize losses . 
 Along the coast of Western Australia , between Onslow and Busselton , minor storm tides were reported , with a peak rise of 1 @.@ 1 m ( 3 @.@ 6 ft ) in Onslow . This caused flooding in low @-@ lying areas , though no damage was reported in relation to it . In North West Australia , especially around Exmouth , the storm brought gusty winds that downed a few trees and produced as much as 76 mm ( 3 in ) of rain . Between 15 and 16 January , the remnants of the storm brought widespread moisture to southern areas of Western Australia , especially the wheatbelt region , leading to scattered showers and thunderstorms . A total of 39 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) of rain fell in Ravensthorpe , with 22 mm ( 0 @.@ 87 in ) falling in a ten @-@ minute span . A strong storm in <unk> produced winds up to 90 km / h ( 56 mph ) that tore the roofs off eight buildings . Losses in the town exceeded A $ 70 @,@ 000 ( US $ 74 @,@ 000 ) . Winds in Lake Grace gusted up to 87 km / h ( 54 mph ) . According to Horizon Power , there was no loss of electricity across Western Australia . A potential tornado touched down near Capel , downing trees along a 400 m ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) wide swath . In Perth , the storm brought unusually warm , moist air , keeping temperatures from dropping below 27 @.@ 3 ° C ( 81 @.@ 1 ° F ) , making it the warmest January night in 24 years .

 While still off the coast of Western Australia , moisture from Narelle brought scattered rains to South Australia . The heaviest totals were measured in <unk> at 12 @.@ 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 50 in ) . In many areas , this ended a 28 day dry spell and brought relief amid a severe heat wave . Grape growers in Adelaide Hills also benefited from the rain and cooler temperatures . On 18 January , a French sailor had to abandon his yacht off the coast of Tasmania after its mast broke due to rough weather caused by the remnants of Narelle . 
 = Rjukan Line = 
 The Rjukan Line ( Norwegian : Rjukanbanen ) , at first called the <unk> Line , was a 16 @-@ kilometre ( 10 mi ) Norwegian railway line running through Vestfjorddalen between Mæl and Rjukan in Telemark . The railway 's main purpose was to transport chemicals from Norsk Hydro 's plant at Rjukan to the port at Skien , in addition to passenger transport . At Mæl the wagons were shipped 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) on the <unk> railway ferry to Tinnoset where they connected to the Tinnos Line . The Rjukan Line and the ferries were operated by Norsk Transport , a subsidiary of Norsk Hydro . 
 Construction of the line started in 1907 , and it opened two years later . It became the second Norwegian railway to be electrified in 1911 . It experienced heavy growth , and had fifteen electric locomotives in use . During World War II it was the scene of the Norwegian heavy water sabotage . After the 1960s production declined , and the railway was closed in 1991 . It was kept as a heritage railway . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 The Telemark power @-@ based industry started in 1902 when Sam Eyde , along with Norwegian and Swedish investors , bought Rjukan Falls — establishing A / S Rjukanfos on 30 April 1903 . The same year , on 13 February , Eyde and Kristian Birkeland had met and started working on refining the electric arc to produce an electric flame ; allowing Eyde to complete his process of converting air and electricity into fertilizer . On 19 December 1903 Det Norske <unk> was founded , followed by Det Norske <unk> for <unk> Industri ( today <unk> ) in 1904 ; both were in part owned by the Wallenberg family , Stockholms <unk> Bank and Banque de Paris et des Pays @-@ Bas . 
 The test plant in Notodden started operation on 2 May 1905 as the first in the world to produce synthetic potassium nitrate . On 2 December 1905 Norsk Hydro @-@ Elektrisk <unk> ( now Norsk Hydro ) was founded , and plans to start a new plant in Rjukan were initialized ; moving closer to the source of power would improve efficiency and not make it possible for the newly independent Government of Norway to hinder construction of hydroelectric power by foreign investors — a major political issue at the time . Rjukanfos applied for permission to build a power line from Rjukan to Notodden , but on 18 June 1907 the Norwegian Parliament did not accept the application , despite an offer from Eyde that the state would receive escheat after eighty years , in part because the state would have to guarantee NOK 18 million for the project . 
 In the mean time the issue of a pure industrial versus a general purpose railway line had stirred local protests , since Norsk Hydro had indicated they were not interested in building a railway to serve the general public . At the time it was common that lines built primarily for single @-@ company freight transport would involve the subsidized operation of passenger and general cargo trains , at the expense of the railway owner . Heavy local protests were transmitted to parliament in 1906 , but by the next year an agreement was made for the construction of a general purpose line . On 13 April 1907 Norsk Hydro and the German group <unk> <unk> und Soda @-@ Fabrik ( today BASF ) made an agreement for the creation of the factory at Rjukan , Rjukan <unk> , and at the same time created Norsk <unk> — both companies were owned as 50 / 50 joint ventures . Norsk Transport received a concession to build — with necessary expropriations and operate a railway for thirty years on 17 July 1907 . The companies had a stock equity of NOK 34 million . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 By the time the concession was given construction of the railway had already started . At the most 2 @,@ 000 workers were involved in the construction of the plant , Rjukanbanen and the Tinnos Line . This was in addition to the <unk> Power Station and a new potassium nitrate factory in Notodden . During the construction one worker lost his life in a landslide , while two survived the accident . Housing was provided in simple barracks , and few laborers came with family . Prostitution and the sale of illegal liquor during the prohibition flourished ; the lack of proper law enforcement making Vestfjorddalen known as a lawless valley . 
 Rjukanbanen was built with a maximum gradient of 1 @.@ 5 % . In addition to the line to the plant , a branch line went to the hydroelectric power station at Vemork ; completed in 1908 it would only be used for service technicians to the power station and had a gradient of 5 @.@ 7 % . Construction in Vestfjorddalen was led by Sigurd <unk> . 
 During May 1908 the workers were not being paid regularly enough , and took to a strike on 6 June ; 2 @,@ 120 men were at the most in strike . As a consequence Norsk Hydro became a member of Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise ( NAF ) . Negotiations were conducted in August , but failed — not until Minister of Labour Nils Claus <unk> meddled and Sam Eyde pulled Norsk Hydro out of NAF and reduced his demands did the strike end , on 6 October . 
 Laying of the tracks started during the fall of 1908 , and on 18 February 1909 the first train from Notodden to Vestfjorddalen ran . The official opening of the line from Notodden to Rjukan occurred on 9 August , performed by King Haakon VII — despite the mayor of Tinn referring to the monarch as " the <unk> King Oscar II " . 
 The line was initially operated by steam locomotives , however the cost of steam power was large ; and on 7 June 1910 a contract with Allgemeine <unk> @-@ Gesellschaft ( today AEG ) of Berlin was signed to provide overhead wires and five electric locomotives . The Rjukan Line became the second electrified railway in Norway , after the <unk> Line , and the first that would be connected to the main railway network . The first electric locomotive was taken into operation on 30 November 1911 . Because only some of the locomotives were delivered , steam locomotive had to help with the service . Because of insufficient safety routines there were several fatalities among employees , and not until 1922 was sufficient policy initiated . 
 = = = Ships = = = 
 In 1907 the first ferry , an <unk> barge named <unk> was completed ; the steam ship <unk> was used to haul it between the two railways . The first self @-@ propelled ferry was SF Rjukanfos , a 338 gross tonne ferry launched in 1909 . She got a major overhaul in 1915 after the sister ship SF Hydro at 494 gross tonnes was launched the same year . The third steamship was SF Ammonia at 929 gross tonnes . Lake Tinn freezes in winter , and all the ships had to be built as icebreakers . The ferries transported the wagons and passengers 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) across Lake Tinn ; until 1936 Norsk Transport had to compete with a passenger steamship service , but after their closing the railway ferries were responsible for all passenger traffic on the lake , which also helped boost passenger traffic on the trains . 
 = = = The first years = = = 
 The first potassium nitrate was transported on 8 December 1911 , and two years later the plants were making a profit . Transported cargo increased from 110 @,@ 000 tonnes per year to 250 @,@ 000 tonnes in 1915 , after the plant had been expanded , and up to 345 @,@ 000 tonnes in 1917 . The small hamlet of Rjukan had turned into a town , and in 1920 there were 11 @,@ 651 people in Tinn . The 1920 were a tough time , and cargo decreased , but in 1929 the electric arc technology was replaced by the ammonia method , with the main product being potassium nitrate . During the 1930s other products came into production , including hydrogen and other gases , and from 1934 as the first plant in the world mass @-@ produced heavy water . 
 Passenger transport was of two types ; trains that corresponded with the ferries and connected with trains at Tinnoset , and commuter trains transporting workers to the plants at Rjukan . The commuter trains were initiated in 1913 , and Norsk Hydro started building housing at Ingolfsland and <unk> , and both Ingolfsland and <unk> got their own stops , and from 1919 stations . The two kilometers ( one mile ) commuter train from Rjukan to <unk> took five minutes ; a month pass cost NOK 2 @.@ 50 for employees and their families . There were seventeen departures in each direction per week , timed to fit with the working times at the plant . This increased to 58 in 1916 , when a new stop at <unk> was opened . 
 The passenger transport to Mæl was performed by connecting passenger wagons to the freight trains . Up to ten trains were operated each direction each day , and up to five would correspond with the ferry ; at Tinnoset trains would operate to Skien , and connection at Hjuksebø allowed for transport to Oslo <unk> . In 1928 Norsk Transport and NSB agreed to operate a weekly night train service from Rjukan to Oslo ; the service lasted until 1933 . During the 1930s NSB and Norsk Hydro initiated an attempt to attract tourists to Rjukan , through discounted direct trains from Oslo , Drammen and Skien . They were taken up again after the war , and remained until 1969 . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 The German occupation of Norway ( 1940 – 1945 ) during World War II made Rjukanbanen the area for a massive struggle in between the Norwegian resistance movement and the Third Reich . In February 1940 , before the occupation , the entire Vestfjorddalen and the docks closed for foreigners . On 4 May 1940 German troops reached Rjukan , a month after the invasion of Norway had started . The ferries were camouflaged and by January 1941 lack of coal resulted in the steamships being fired by wood . 
 One of the by @-@ products at Rjukan was the production of heavy water — a key component in nuclear weapons , and necessary for the Germany designs as a moderator . The hydrogen plant at Vemork was the first mass producer of heavy water , and in 1939 IG Farben , who owned 25 % of Norsk Hydro at the time , asked to import five liters of heavy water , but was denied due to lack of an export license . In 1939 – 40 production at Vemork was 20 kilograms , by 1942 production had increased to five kilograms per day . 
 The first attempt from the resistance was Operation Grouse in October 1942 , but failed and caught by the Germans ; as a consequence passenger transport after 7 April 1942 from Ingolfsland Station to Rjukan was only permitted for soldiers , police , workers at the plant and schoolchildren . All filled ammonia wagons were stored indoors in a tunnel with heavy guarding . On 16 November 1943 the United States Air Force bombed the hydrogen plant ; the attack killed 21 civilians but failed to touch the plant itself , located underneath seven stories of reinforced concrete . The secondary targets of the attack were the station at Rjukan , the industrial tracks and the track to Vemork . The attack caused great damage to the railway with locomotives No.7 and 8 , eight cargo wagons and seven passenger wagons suffering damage . Total costs for the bombings were NOK 245 @,@ 611 , most of it related to rolling stock . 
 The Germans decided to cancel production of heavy water at Rjukan , and move the remains of the potassium hydroxide — from which the heavy water was distilled — was to be transported to Germany . The resistance movement was aware of this plan , and considered blowing up the train at various places , but instead chose to target the ferry SF Hydro . The night before the shipment went the saboteurs entered the ship and placed a bomb in the hull , timed so the ferry would blow at the deepest point of the lake , but at the same time close to land to help save the civilians on board . The attack was successful , the ship sank to 430 metres ( 1 @,@ 410 ft ) depth with 47 people on board , including eight German soldiers , a crew of seven and the cargo of heavy water . 29 people survived . 
 = = = Climax = = = 
 After the end of the war Norsk Hydro had a strong liquidity , while the Green Revolution and increased industrialization of agriculture in Europe boomed the demand for the products ; from 1945 to 1955 production increased eightfold . The increased transport was a heavy burden on the two steamships , and in 1953 Norsk Transport ordered MF <unk> , a diesel powered ship of 1119 gross tonnes . She was launched on 25 May 1956 , and the two older ferries were put to reserve duty in the meantime . A number of upgrades were made to the line , and the two locomotives 9 and 10 were bought in 1958 . This was followed by the three diesel locomotives 20 , 21 and 22 from Henschel . In 1966 two NSB El 1 locomotives were bought , and the voltage on the line increased from 10 to 15 kV . 
 In 1957 five round trips had to be made each day , while the trains made nine round trips from Rjukan to Mæl . Rjukan station handled 100 wagons , with 800 tonnes potassium nitrate and 400 tonnes ammonia ; by 1962 723 @,@ 482 tonnes were transported on Rjukanbanen , 14 % of the transported amount of NSB ( excluding the ore trains on Ofotbanen ) . In total 30 million tonnes on 1 @,@ 5 million carloads were transported from 1911 to 1991 . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 Norsk Hydro announced in 1963 a savings plan for its four plants in Norway ; Chief Executive Officer Rolf <unk> made it clear that new technology in the production of ammonia would force the closure of the plant at Rjukan , and replace it with a petroleum @-@ based process at Herøya . The Rjukan situation , as it was named in the press , became a source of conflict between the local community and Norsk Hydro ; initially 250 jobs were to be moved to Herøya , but in 1964 Norsk Hydro applied for permission to build a power line from Rjukan to Herøya — what would become the death sentence for the Rjukan Line . Permission for the construction of the power line was granted in 1968 . Production of fertilizer was moved to Herøya and <unk> , and Rjukan transferred to production of <unk> in 1963 and ammonium nitrate in 1964 . 
 During the 1960s a series of cost reductions were introduced on the line , after major reorganizations between 1965 and 1970 ; the last commuter train for the workers to the plants went on 25 May 1968 , while on 31 May 1970 the last passenger train in connection with the ferries went on Rjukanbanen , being replaced with bus . In 1972 Norsk Transport applied to terminate passenger transport with the railway ferry , since they were operating trips with only passengers and no cargo . The application was declined by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications , but in 1978 they permitted that the Saturday afternoon and Sunday departures be terminated — these were not used to transport freight trains . By the mid eighties passenger numbers had fallen dramatically , and in 1985 the department gave in and permitted the termination of passenger services with <unk> and Ammonia . 
 The plan had been producing a deficit since 1982 . Norsk Hydro made an agreement with the authorities where they would create 350 new permanent jobs , create a business fund and donate NOK 60 million for the construction of a new road , Route 37 along Lake Tinn . In 1988 Norsk Hydro terminated the ammonia production , and in 1991 they also closed down the production ammonium nitrate and potassium nitrate , along with the Rjukan Line . Within a few years the number of Norsk Hydro employees in Rjukan had been reduced from 1 @,@ 760 to 530 people ; 24 of these were employed by Norsk Transport operating the railway and railway ferries . All the employees were either retired or moved to other areas of Norsk Hydro 's enterprise . 
 The last train ran on 4 July 1991 , four days after the plant closed . Without production at the plants there was no need for the railway ; it would be more economical to transport the few last products by truck . The final hauled several wagons down to the coast for scrapping . The closing of the Rjukan Line also terminated operations on the Tinnos Line , where passenger traffic had remained until 1991 . 
 = = Rolling stock = = 
 = = Reuse as a heritage line = = 
 After the closing in 1991 the foundation Stiftelsen Rjukanbanen was established to ensure that the railway remained in an operational condition , and kept the two railway ferries and some of the rolling stock in operational condition . Norsk Transport retained for a period maintenance of the Rjukan Line , while the Tinnos Line remained part of the rail network maintained by the Norwegian National Rail Administration . The foundation operated ad @-@ hoc charter services on both the Tinnos Line and the Rjukan Line , as well as with both railway ferries . By 2004 the foundation had run out of money , and closed down . 
 In 2006 the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage announced they would be working to preserve the railways and ferries , and in 2008 it became clear that the directorate was working with an application for the Rjukan Line , the Tinnos Line and the ferries to be included in a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with the closed plants in Rjukan and Odda . 
 = Tomorrow Never Knows = 
 " Tomorrow Never Knows " is the final track of the Beatles ' 1966 studio album Revolver but the first to be recorded . Credited as a Lennon – McCartney song , it was written primarily by John Lennon . 
 The song has a vocal put through a Leslie speaker cabinet ( which was normally used as a loudspeaker for a Hammond organ ) . Tape loops prepared by the Beatles were mixed in and out of the Indian @-@ inspired modal backing underpinned by Ringo Starr 's constant but non @-@ standard drum pattern . 
 It is considered one of the greatest songs of its time , with Pitchfork Media placing it at number 19 on its list of " The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s " and Rolling Stone Magazine placing it at number 18 on its list of the 100 greatest Beatles songs . 
 = = Inspiration = = 
 John Lennon wrote the song in January 1966 , with lyrics adapted from the book The Psychedelic Experience : A Manual Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead by Timothy Leary , Richard Alpert , and Ralph Metzner , which was in turn adapted from the Tibetan Book of the Dead . Although Peter Brown believed that Lennon 's source for the lyrics was the Tibetan Book of the Dead itself , which , he said , Lennon had read whilst consuming LSD , George Harrison later stated that the idea for the lyrics came from Leary , Alpert , and Metzner 's book ; Paul McCartney confirmed this , stating that when he and Lennon visited the newly opened Indica bookshop , Lennon had been looking for a copy of The Portable Nietzsche and found a copy of The Psychedelic Experience that contained the lines : " Whenever in doubt , turn off your mind , relax , float downstream " . 
 Lennon bought the book , went home , took LSD , and followed the instructions exactly as stated in the book . The book held that the " ego death " experienced under the influence of LSD and other psychedelic drugs is essentially similar to the dying process and requires similar guidance . This is a state of being known by eastern mystics and masters as samādhi ( a state of being totally aware of the present moment ; a one @-@ pointedness of mind . ) . 
 = = Title = = 
 The title never actually appears in the song 's lyrics . In an interview Lennon revealed that , like " A Hard Day 's Night " , it was taken from one of Ringo Starr 's malapropisms . The piece was originally titled " Mark I " . " The Void " is cited as another working title but according to Mark Lewisohn ( and Bob Spitz ) this is untrue , although the books The Love You Make : An Insider 's Story of the Beatles and The Beatles A to Z both cite " The Void " as the original title . 
 When the Beatles returned to London after their first visit to America in early 1964 they were interviewed by David Coleman of BBC Television . The interview included the following exchange : 
 Interviewer : " Now , Ringo , I hear you were manhandled at the Embassy Ball . Is this right ? " 
 Ringo : " Not really . Someone just cut a bit of my hair , you see . " 
 Interviewer : " Let 's have a look . You seem to have got plenty left . " 
 Ringo : ( turns head ) " Can you see the difference ? It 's longer , this side . " 
 Interviewer : " What happened exactly ? " 
 Ringo : " I don 't know . I was just talking , having an interview ( exaggerated voice ) . Just like I am NOW ! " 
 ( John and Paul begin lifting locks of his hair , pretending to cut it ) 
 Ringo : " I was talking away and I looked ' round , and there was about 400 people just smiling . So , you know – what can you say ? " 
 John : " What can you say ? " 
 Ringo : " Tomorrow never knows . " 
 ( John laughs ) 
 = = Musical structure = = 
 McCartney remembered that even though the song 's harmony was mainly restricted to the chord of C , Martin accepted it as it was and said it was " rather interesting " . The song 's harmonic structure is derived from Indian music and is based upon a high volume C drone played by Harrison on a tamboura . The " chord " over the drone is generally C major , but some changes to B flat major result from vocal modulations , as well as orchestral and guitar tape loops . The song has been called the first pop song that attempted to dispense with chord changes altogether . Here , the Beatles ' harmonic ingenuity is nonetheless displayed in the upper harmonies – " Turn off your mind " , for example , is suitably a run of unvarying E melody notes , before " relax " involves an E @-@ G melody note shift and " float downstream " an E @-@ C @-@ G descent . " It is not dying " involves a run of three G melody notes that rise on " dying " to a B ♭ , creating a ♭ VII / I ( B ♭ / C ) ' slash ' <unk> . This is a prominent device in Beatles songs such as " All My Loving " , " Help ! " , " A Hard Day 's Night " , " Norwegian Wood ( This Bird Has Flown ) " , " Hey Jude " , " Dear Prudence " , " Revolution " and " Get Back " .

 Lennon first played the song to Brian Epstein , George Martin and the other Beatles at Epstein 's house at 24 Chapel Street , Belgravia . 
 The 19 @-@ year @-@ old Geoff Emerick was promoted to replace Norman Smith as engineer on the first session for the Revolver album . This started at 8 pm on 6 April 1966 , in Studio Three at Abbey Road . Lennon told producer Martin that he wanted to sound like a hundred chanting Tibetan monks , which left Martin the difficult task of trying to find the effect by using the basic equipment they had . The effect was achieved by using a Leslie speaker . When the concept was explained to Lennon , he inquired if the same effect could be achieved by hanging him upside down and spinning him around a microphone while he sang into it . Emerick made a connector to break into the electronic circuitry of the cabinet and then re @-@ recorded the vocal as it came out of the revolving speaker . 
 As Lennon hated doing a second take to double his vocals , Ken Townsend , the studio 's technical manager , developed an alternative form of double @-@ tracking called artificial double tracking ( ADT ) system , taking the signal from the sync head of one tape machine and delaying it slightly through a second tape machine . The two tape machines used were not driven by mains electricity , but from a separate generator which put out a particular frequency , the same for both , thereby keeping them locked together . By altering the speed and frequencies , he could create various effects , which the Beatles used throughout the recording of Revolver . Lennon 's vocal is double @-@ tracked on the first three verses of the song : the effect of the Leslie cabinet can be heard after the ( backwards ) guitar solo . 
 The track included the highly compressed drums that the Beatles currently favoured , with reverse cymbals , reverse guitar , processed vocals , looped tape effects , a sitar and a tambura drone . The use of these ¼ -inch audio tape loops resulted primarily from McCartney 's admiration for Stockhausen 's Gesang der Jünglinge . By disabling the erase head of a tape recorder and then spooling a continuous loop of tape through the machine while recording , the tape would constantly overdub itself , creating a saturation effect , a technique also used in musique concrète . The tape could also be induced to go faster and slower . McCartney encouraged the other Beatles to use the same effects and create their own loops . After experimentation on their own , the various Beatles supplied a total of " 30 or so " tape loops to Martin , who selected 16 for use on the song . Each loop was about six seconds long . 
 The tape loops were played on <unk> tape machines located in various studios of the Abbey Road building and controlled by EMI technicians in Studio Two at Abbey Road on 7 April . Each machine was monitored by one technician , who had to hold a pencil within each loop to maintain tension . The four Beatles controlled the faders of the mixing console while Martin varied the stereo panning and Emerick watched the meters . Eight of the tapes were used at one time , changed halfway through the song . The tapes were made ( like most of the other loops ) by superimposition and acceleration . According to Martin , the finished mix of the tape loops could not be repeated because of the complex and random way in which they were laid over the music . 
 Five tape loops are audible in the finished version of the song . Isolating the loops reveals that they contained : 
 A " laughing " voice , played at double @-@ speed ( the " seagull " sound ) 
 An orchestral chord of B flat major ( from a Sibelius symphony ) ( 0 : 19 ) 
 A fast electric guitar phrase in C major , reversed and played at double @-@ speed ( 0 : 22 ) 
 Another guitar phrase with heavy tape echo , with a B flat chord provided either by guitar , organ or possibly a Mellotron Mk II ( 0 : 38 ) 
 A sitar @-@ like descending scalar phrase played on an electric guitar , reversed and played at double @-@ speed ( 0 : 56 ) 
 The Beatles further experimented with tape loops in " Carnival of Light " , an as @-@ yet @-@ unreleased piece recorded during the Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band sessions , and in " Revolution 9 " , released on The Beatles . Also , on the same album , is Blackbird , where the tweeting birds are actually tape loops . 
 The opening chord fades in gradually on the stereo version while the mono version features a more sudden fade @-@ in . The mono and stereo versions also have the tape @-@ loop track faded in at slightly different times and different volumes ( in general , the loops are louder on the mono mix ) . On the stereo version a little feedback comes in after the guitar solo , exactly halfway through the song , but is edited out of the mono mix . 
 Lennon was later quoted as saying that " I should have tried to get my original idea , the monks singing . I realise now that 's what I wanted . " Take one of the recording was released on the Anthology 2 album . 
 = = Interpretation = = 
 Harrison questioned whether Lennon fully understood the meaning of the song 's lyrics : 
 You can hear ( and I am sure most Beatles fans have ) " Tomorrow Never Knows " a lot and not know really what it is about . Basically it is saying what meditation is all about . The goal of meditation is to go beyond ( that is , transcend ) waking , sleeping and dreaming . So the song starts out by saying , " Turn off your mind , relax and float downstream , it is not dying . " 
 Then it says , " Lay down all thoughts , surrender to the void – it is shining . That you may see the meaning of within – it is being . " From birth to death all we ever do is think : we have one thought , we have another thought , another thought , another thought . Even when you are asleep you are having dreams , so there is never a time from birth to death when the mind isn 't always active with thoughts . But you can turn off your mind , and go to the part which Maharishi described as : " Where was your last thought before you thought it ? " 
 The whole point is that we are the song . The self is coming from a state of pure awareness , from the state of being . All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the physical world ( including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions ) is just clutter . The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness . So the song is really about transcending and about the quality of the transcendent . 
 I am not too sure if John actually fully understood what he was saying . He knew he was onto something when he saw those words and turned them into a song . But to have experienced what the lyrics in that song are actually about ? I don 't know if he fully understood it .

 = Voivode of Transylvania = 
 The Voivode of Transylvania ( German : <unk> von Siebenbürgen , Hungarian : <unk> <unk> , Latin : <unk> <unk> , Romanian : <unk> <unk> ) was the highest @-@ ranking official in Transylvania within the Kingdom of Hungary from the 12th century to the 16th century . Appointed by the monarchs , the voivodes – themselves also the heads or ispáns of Fehér County – were the superiors of the ispáns of all the other counties in the province . 
 They had wide @-@ ranging administrative , military and judicial powers , but their jurisdiction never covered the whole province . The Saxon and Székely communities – organized into their own districts or " seats " from the 13th century – were independent of the voivodes . The kings also exempted some Transylvanian towns and villages from their authority over the centuries . Even so , the voivodeship of Transylvania " was the largest single administrative entity " in the entire kingdom in the 15th century . Voivodes enjoyed income from the royal estates attached to their office , but the right to " grant lands , collect taxes and tolls , or coin money " was reserved for the monarchs . Although Roland Borsa , Ladislaus Kán and some other voivodes rebelled against the sovereign , most remained faithful royal officials . 
 Because of the gradual disintegration of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary in the 16th century , the last voivodes of Transylvania , who came from the Báthory family , ceased to be high @-@ ranking officials . Instead they were the heads of state , although under Ottoman suzerainty , of a new principality emerging in the eastern territories of the kingdom . Accordingly , Stephen Báthory , the voivode elected by the Diet of the new realm , officially abandoned the title of voivode and adopted that of prince in 1576 , upon his election as King of Poland .

 The origin of the office is unclear . The title voivode is of Slavic origin with a meaning of " commander , lieutenant " . Although Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos wrote of the voivodes or chieftains of the Hungarian tribes around 950 , he seems to have adopted the term used by a Slavic interpreter . 
 The border position of Transylvania led to the formation of the voivodeship , since the monarchs could not maintain direct control over this remote region . Thus the voivodes were never autonomous , but remained provincial officials . The voivodes were heads of Fehér County from 1201 , which may indicate that their position had its origin in the office of that county 's ispán . 
 Two royal charters issued in 1111 and 1113 mention one Mercurius " princeps <unk> " , but he may have been only an important landowner in Transylvania without holding any specific office . The title voivode was first documented in 1199 , but a certain <unk> voivode living some years earlier was mentioned by a document from 1230 . In addition to voivode , royal charters used the titles banus , dux and <unk> for the same office in the next decades , showing that the terminology remained uncertain until the second half of the 13th century .

 = = = Jurisdiction = = = 
 The territories under the jurisdiction of the voivodes are known as Voivodeship of Transylvania or <unk> of Transylvania ( Hungarian : <unk> <unk> , Romanian : <unk> <unk> ) . Voivodes were the chiefs of the ispáns of the Transylvanian counties . Although the counties in Transylvania were first attested from the 1170s , earlier references to fortresses at their seats and archaeological finds suggest that a system of counties existed in the 11th century . For instance , Torda County was first mentioned in a charter of 1227 , but a royal castle at Torda ( Turda ) had already been documented in 1097 , and three burials coin @-@ dated to the reign of Stephen I of Hungary ( 1000 or 1001 – 1038 ) were unearthed in the same fortress . 
 The ispáns of the Transylvanian counties of Doboka , Hunyad , Kolozs , Küküllő and Torda were not listed among the witnesses of royal charters from the beginning of the 13th century , hinting that their direct connection to the monarchs had by that time been interrupted . Thereafter they were employed by the voivode who appointed and dismissed them at will . Only the heads of Szolnok County remained directly connected to the monarchs for a longer period , until their office was united with the voivodeship in the 1260s . Similarly , the voivodes were simultaneously the ispáns of the nearby Arad County between 1321 and 1412 . 
 The kings exempted some communities from the jurisdiction of the voivodes . The Diploma Andreanum , a royal charter of 1224 , placed the territory of the Saxons between <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) under the authority of the Count of Hermannstadt ( Nagyszeben , Sibiu ) , who was appointed by and directly subordinate to the monarchs . Likewise , a special royal official , the Count of the Székelys , administered the Székely community from around 1228 . In the latter case , the two offices were united by custom in 1462 : from then on each voivode was also appointed Count of the Székelys . 
 Following the Mongol invasion of 1241 and 1242 , King Béla IV of Hungary exempted the inhabitants of <unk> ( <unk> ) , Gyalu ( Gilău ) , Gyulafehérvár ( Alba Iulia ) , Harina ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( Tășnad ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) . King Charles I of Hungary granted immunity to the Saxon communities of <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> Mică ) , and <unk> ( <unk> , Mediaș ) in 1315 , but the same monarch annulled other communities ' similar privileges in 1324 . <unk> ( <unk> , Rodna ) and <unk> ( Beszterce , Bistrița ) received immunity in 1366 . 
 = = = Honour of the voivodes = = = 
 The office of voivode was one of the most important royal honours in the kingdom . All income from lands attached to the Transylvanian royal castles was collected for the voivodes . They enjoyed the income from fines , but royal revenues from taxes , tolls and mines remained the kings ' due . 
 During most of the 14th century , the voivodes held the castles at <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( Ciceu @-@ <unk> ) , <unk> ( Deva ) , Hátszeg ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( Cetatea de Baltă ) , <unk> ( Lita ) , Nagy @-@ <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( Gogan <unk> ) , together with their lands . Additionally , the voivodes enjoyed the revenues of royal estates in Transylvania . For instance , the estates at <unk> ( Bonțida ) and <unk> ( Hunedoara ) were attached to them for decades . However , the monarchs started to grant their castles and estates to noblemen , to the bishops of Transylvania or to the Saxon community after 1387 . Consequently , <unk> and the lands pertaining to it remained the last piece of the " <unk> domain " in the 1450s . 
 The inhabitants of the Transylvanian counties were compelled to accommodate the voivodes and their officials . The " guest settlers " at <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) were the first to be released from this duty in 1206 . In <unk> ( Vinţu de Jos ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) , the obligation itself was not abolished , but limited to two occasions a year . Finally King Charles I exempted all Transylvanian noblemen and their serfs from this irksome duty in 1324 . 
 The voivodes who preferred to stay in the royal court seldom resided in their province , but were represented by their deputies . The earliest record of a vicar of a voivode dates from 1221 . Later the title " vice @-@ voivode " , first documented in 1278 , came into general use . In addition to vice @-@ voivodes and ispáns of the Transylvanian counties , the voivodes appointed the castellans of the royal fortresses . They tended to choose from among the noblemen serving in their own retinue , which ensured that their followers received a fair share of their revenues . Accordingly , when a king dismissed a voivode , his men were also replaced with his successor 's men . 
 = = = Judicial functions = = = 
 Along with the palatine , the judge royal and the ban , the voivode was one of the Kingdom 's highest judges . In this capacity , he was authorized to issue " credible " charters . The earliest preserved charter dates to 1248 . The voivodes or their vice @-@ voivodes always heard disputes together with local noblemen who knew local customs . Initially , the voivodes and their deputies held their courts at <unk> ( <unk> ) , but they heard disputes at their own abodes from the 14th century . Voivodes rarely headed their courts after the 1340s and were rather represented by their deputies . 
 Although limiting his own jurisdiction , in 1342 voivode Thomas Szécsényi recognized the right of Transylvanian noblemen to judge legal cases of peasants owning parcels in their estates , " with the exception of three cases , such as robbery , highway robbery , and violent trespass " . This concession was confirmed in 1365 by King Louis I of Hungary . Furthermore , the monarchs granted jus gladii ( the right to the application of capital punishment ) to more and more nobles in the course of the same century . 
 According to customary law , noblemen could not be sued outside the province until the 15th century . King Louis I even prohibited all prelates and noblemen who owned lands in Transylvania from bringing legal proceedings of lesser importance concerning these estates to the royal court . Nevertheless , legal actions between Transylvanians and the inhabitants of other parts of the kingdom remained outside the jurisdiction of the voivodes . Litigants could appeal to the royal court against the decision of the voivode from the 14th century , but the voivode often remained involved in the proceedings . Legislation prescribed that appeals against decisions of the voivodes were to be addressed to the judge royal only from 1444 . 
 " General assemblies " convoked and presided over by the principal judges of the realm became important judicial institutions in the last decade of the 13th century . General assemblies for the representatives of the Transylvanian counties were presided over by the voivode or the vice @-@ voivode . The first such assembly was held on June 8 , 1288 . They became important legal institutions from 1322 . Thereafter they were held on a regular basis , at least once a year at <unk> ( <unk> ) near Torda . 
 With the authority of the monarch , the voivodes occasionally also invited the representatives of the Saxon and Székely communities to the counties ' general meetings . This contributed to the development of legal connections among the future " Three Nations of Transylvania " . The threat from the peasants ' revolt of 1437 gave rise to the first joint meeting of the Hungarian noblemen and the representatives of the Saxons and the Székelys , which was convoked without a former royal authorization by the vice @-@ voivode . Romanian cneazes were only once , in 1355 , invited to the general assembly . Otherwise , the vice @-@ voivodes organized separate meetings for them . 
 = = = Military functions = = = 
 The etymology of the title ( " commander " ) suggests that voivodes had significant military duties . They were the supreme leader of the troops recruited in the counties under their jurisdiction . Although law obliged noblemen to fight in the king 's army , Transylvanian nobles fought under the command of the voivode . Furthermore , the voivodes had their own private retinue , formed primarily by armed noblemen . Their right to raise an army under their own flag was confirmed by legislation in 1498 . 
 Military functions are attested , for instance , by <unk> , the voivode at the time of the Mongol invasion who fell in battle on March 31 , 1241 . Voivode Lawrence of the Aba clan fought in the royal army in a war against Austria in 1246 . A Mongol army attacking the southern regions of Transylvania was defeated by voivode <unk> of the Ákos clan in 1260 . Roland Borsa fought against the invading Mongols in 1285 . 
 Voivode Nicholas <unk> failed to repel an Ottoman invasion of Transylvania in 1420 . In contrast , John Hunyadi , voivode between 1441 and 1446 , defeated a major Ottoman army at Gyulafehérvár in 1442 . His successor Stephen Báthory likewise won a resounding victory at <unk> ( Hungarian : <unk> , Romanian : Câmpul <unk> ) on October 13 , 1479 . By contrast , John Zápolya ( Szapolyai ) , the last voivode before the battle of Mohács on August 29 , 1526 did not arrive to the battlefield in time , summoned too late . The battle ended with the Ottomans ' annihilation of the royal army . King Louis II of Hungary was also killed on the battlefield . 
 = = Monarchs and their voivodes = = 
 = = = Appointment and dismissal = = = 
 The voivodes had power concentrated in their hands , <unk> the monarchs to replace them frequently : forty @-@ three voivodes ruled between 1199 and 1288 . Monarchs usually refrained from appointing as voivode noblemen who owned Transylvanian estates . Michael of the Kacsics clan was the first voivode to receive a land grant in the province , around 1210 . However , these originally uninhabited lands along the upper courses of the river Mureș ( Maros ) were confiscated in 1228 . 
 The era beginning with 1288 was characterized by longer periods in office . Roland Borsa survived 10 years , while his successor , Ladislaus Kán , lasted 20 years . This apparent stability was the consequence of the weakening of central government under the last two kings of the Árpád dynasty , Ladislaus IV ( 1272 – 1290 ) and Andrew III ( 1290 – 1301 ) . Royal power was only restored in the reign of Charles I ( 1308 – 1342 ) who one by one defeated the rebellious noblemen throughout his kingdom . 
 In Transylvania , he was assisted by Thomas Szécsényi , the voivode between 1320 and 1342 . Ioan @-@ Aurel Pop characterizes the following period as including " <unk> dynasties " : five members of the Lackfi family ( father and four sons ) were successively appointed between 1356 and 1376 . Likewise , Nicholas <unk> ( 1415 to 1426 ) was succeeded by his son Ladislaus . The pair preferred to entrust their vice @-@ voivode Roland <unk> to represent them , instead of visiting the province . From the middle of the 15th century it was not unusual for two or even three noblemen to hold the office at the same time . For instance , John Hunyadi was appointed together with Nicholas <unk> in 1441 by King <unk> I. 
 = = = Cooperation and conflicts = = = 
 The Mongols comprehensively plundered the eastern territories of the Kingdom of Hungary , including Transylvania , during both their invasion in 1241 and their withdrawal the following year . The consolidation of the province was the main task of Lawrence of the Aba clan , who was appointed by Béla IV and held the office for 10 years from 1242 . One of his successors , also appointed by Béla IV , banus <unk> of the Ákos clan , was dismissed in 1260 by the king 's son , Stephen who had just taken over Transylvania with the title of duke . The duke 's action showed emerging tensions between father and son , rather than conflicts between the duke and the banus . 
 The first years of the reign of the minor Ladislaus IV were characterized by armed conflicts between parties of the leading noble families . Although Roland Borsa , voivode in 1282 and between 1284 and 1294 , was initially among the nobles assisting the king in consolidating royal power , he himself became the source of new conflicts . First he prevented the canons of the Gyulafehérvár Chapter from collecting their income in 1289 . Next he unlawfully compelled noblemen and Saxon landowners in Transylvania to accommodate him and his retinue . Later Borsa fought the bishop of Várad ( Oradea ) and even resisted King Andrew III who besieged him in the fortress of Adorján ( Adrian ) at <unk> ( <unk> ) for three months in 1294 . 
 Borsa 's successor Ladislaus Kán went even further by usurping royal prerogative during his voivodeship between 1294 and 1315 . He arbitrarily assumed the titles of count of <unk> , Hermannstadt and the Székelys to expand his authority over Saxon and Székely communities exempted from <unk> authority . He set up a tax @-@ collecting body , seemingly covering the entire province . He captured Otto of Bavaria , a claimant to the Hungarian throne and seized the Holy Crown of Hungary from him in the first half of 1307 . He handed the royal diadem to King Charles I in 1310 , but continued to rule Transylvania de facto independently until his death in 1315 . His son of the same name declared himself voivode , a title even used by the monarch when referring to him in a charter of August 12 , 1315 . Dózsa Debreceni , the voivode King Charles I appointed in 1318 , defeated some rebellious minor lords , but royal authority in Transylvania was only restored by Thomas Szécsényi in the 1320s . 
 The next rebellion against royal power in Transylvania broke out in 1467 . Irritated by a new tax that King Matthias Corvinus had just introduced , representatives of the Three Nations concluded an alliance against the monarch and declared the three incumbent voivodes ( the brothers Counts John and Sigismund Szentgyörgyi and Berthold <unk> ) their leaders . The king put down the revolt in a week , but did not sentence the three voivodes , because their active role in the revolt was never proven . 
 = = End of the office = = 
 The barons did not find a compromise candidate to succeed King Louis II who perished in the battle of Mohács in 1526 . First the voivode , John Szapolyai was proclaimed king by a group of nobles , but the opposing party also elected its own king , Ferdinand I , a scion of the Habsburg family , by the end of the year . 
 King John I accepted Ottoman suzerainty in 1529 , but in the Treaty of Nagyvárad of 1538 he conceded the right of the Habsburgs to succeed him after his death . At that point his voivodes , Stephen Majláth and Emeric Balassa , decided to separate Transylvania from the kingdom in order to save the province from an Ottoman invasion . Although other leading Transylvanian noblemen soon joined them , King John I overcame their rebellion in some weeks . 
 Following John 's death , Ottoman troops occupied the central parts of the Kingdom of Hungary in 1541 . Sultan Suleiman I permitted the king 's widow , Queen Isabella , to retain the territories east of the river Tisza ( Tisa ) , including Transylvania , in the name of her infant son , John Sigismund . George Martinuzzi , bishop of Várad , soon started to reorganize the government in the name of the dowager queen and her son . The Ottomans assisted the bishop by capturing his opponent , Stephen Majláth , although the sultan had earlier confirmed the latter 's position as voivode . An assembly of the Three Nations elected George Martinuzzi as governor on behalf of the infant king in 1542 . 
 The office of voivode was vacant until September 1549 , when Ferdinand ( who had not given up the idea of reuniting the territories of the entire kingdom ) appointed Martinuzzi to this post . However , Isabella and his son only left their realm in 1551 . Thereafter , Transylvania was again under the rule of voivodes appointed by the monarch , ending with István <unk> . He administered the province until 1556 , when Isabella and John Sigismund returned . 
 John Sigismund ceased to style himself king of Hungary after the Treaty of Speyer of 1570 , under which he adopted the title of " Prince of Transylvania and Lord of parts of the Kingdom of Hungary " . His successor Stephen Báthory ( who was elected ruler by the assembly of the Three Nations ) revived the title of voivode , initially for himself . He adopted the title of " prince of Transylvania " when he was elected king of Poland in 1576 . At the same time , he conferred the title voivode on his brother Christopher in 1576 . Christopher Báthory was followed in 1581 by his minor son Sigismund who continued to style himself voivode until the death of his uncle , Stephen Báthory in 1586 . Sigismund Báthory 's title of prince was acknowledged in 1595 by Emperor Rudolph ( also king of Hungary ) .

 = Interstate 74 in Iowa = 
 Interstate 74 ( I @-@ 74 ) is the central freeway through the Iowa Quad Cities . It roughly divides Davenport to the west and Bettendorf to the east . The Interstate Highway begins at an interchange with Interstate 80 ( I @-@ 80 ) at the northeastern edge of Davenport and continues into Illinois at the Mississippi River by crossing the I @-@ 74 Bridge . The freeway was built in stages during the late 1960s and early 1970s . 
 The northern half of the interstate was built atop farmland in northeastern Davenport , while the southern half was built near the existing U.S. Route 6 ( US 6 ) corridor through Bettendorf . After the approaches to the Iowa @-@ Illinois Memorial Bridge were rebuilt for interstate traffic , it was completed and opened to traffic on November 26 , 1974 . 
 The Iowa and Illinois departments of transportation are planning a major reconstruction project along I @-@ 74 . The 7 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 11 km ) corridor will be widened from four lanes to six . A new river crossing will be built to replace the aging bridges . Eastbound motorists on I @-@ 80 wishing to use I @-@ 74 east of the Quad Cities are suggested to use I @-@ 80 east around town for this reason . 
 = = Route description = = 
 I @-@ 74 begins at a trumpet interchange with I @-@ 80 on the northern edge of Davenport where it heads to the south . From I @-@ 80 to the East 67th Street overpass , the freeway is surrounded by farmland on either side . South of the overpass , it passes a residential area to the east and a commercial area to the west . The East 53rd Street exit provides access to shopping centers on both sides of the interstate . 
 Continuing south between East 53rd Street and Spruce Hills Drive , I @-@ 74 goes through an area of sparse development . What businesses there are have frontages on either Elmore Avenue to the west or Utica Ridge Road to the east ; the backs of these businesses abut the freeway . At the Spruce Hills Drive exit , U.S. Route 6 ( US 6 ) joins from the west . Nearly 1 ⁄ 3 mile ( 0 @.@ 54 km ) to the west , Spruce Hills Drive becomes Kimberly Road , which carries US 6 through Davenport until it intersects I @-@ 280 on the western edge of the Quad Cities . 
 South of Spruce Hills Drive , I @-@ 74 runs parallel to the eastern leg of Kimberly Road , which turned south at its intersection with Spruce Hills Drive . The freeway curves slightly to the southeast and enters Bettendorf . It crosses Duck Creek and meets Middle Road at a diamond interchange . 
 As I @-@ 74 and US 6 head down a hill towards the Mississippi River , a series of exit and entrance ramps connect the freeway to US 67 , which runs northbound along State Street and southbound along Grant Street . The interstate passes over US 67 and railroad tracks belonging to the Dakota , Minnesota and Eastern Railroad on an elevated highway , which serves as the approach to the Interstate 74 Bridge over the Mississippi River . Despite the singular name , the crossing is actually two twin bridges which each carry one direction of traffic to and from Moline , Illinois . 
 = = History = = 
 I @-@ 74 was part of the original plans for building Iowa 's interstate system . It would form the Iowa leg of a planned freeway from the Quad Cities to Cincinnati , Ohio . Its route through the Quad Cities closely resembles the path drawn up in the mid @-@ 1950s . 
 In the Iowa Quad Cities , I @-@ 74 opened in three segments beginning on August 30 , 1968 . On that day , the northernmost 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) , from I @-@ 80 to US 6 , opened to traffic . The new freeway was built atop farmland west of Utica Ridge Road in the northeastern part of Davenport . The next section was built adjacent to the north – south portion of Kimberly Road , which then carried US 6 through Bettendorf . The segment ended where the interstate lined up with the older street . The eastbound exit and westbound entrance ramps at Kimberly Road now provide access to and from US 67 . The middle section opened in 1971 . 
 Another three years passed before the freeway was completed and opened to traffic . The twin spans of the I @-@ 74 Bridge had to be retrofitted to connect to the interstate . The Iowa @-@ bound bridge was built as a Works Progress Administration project in 1934 – 35 and the Illinois @-@ bound bridge was 24 years later . Prior to interstate construction , the I @-@ 74 Bridge terminated at State Street , the northbound lanes of US 67 , in Bettendorf . To prevent traffic bottlenecks , traffic was prohibited from making left turns onto and off of the bridges . As a result , loop ramps diverted traffic onto Gilbert Street , one block south of State Street , which curved back to State Street at both ends thus allowing traffic to make the necessary left turns . 
 Construction of the interstate meant eliminating the at @-@ grade intersections with State and Grant streets . I @-@ 74 was built as elevated highway from the bridges to a new overpass at Kimberly Road . The connections were completed and opened to traffic on November 26 , 1974 . 
 = = Future = = 
 The Iowa and Illinois departments of transportation are in the planning stages to build a new bridge to replace the aging I @-@ 74 Bridge . The Iowa @-@ bound bridge opened in 1935 ; the Illinois bridge in 1958 . In addition to replacing the bridges , the scope of the bi @-@ state coalition 's plan includes updating 7 miles ( 11 km ) of I @-@ 74 mainline and interchanges from 53rd Street in Davenport to the Avenue of the Cities in Moline . 
 In 2005 , the Iowa and Illinois DOTs identified the traffic needs of the corridor and found they would be satisfied by a true @-@ arch , tied @-@ arch , or cable @-@ stayed bridge . After public input and consideration of construction costs and aesthetics , the departments of transportation , in August 2006 , recommended building two twin , true arch , basket handle bridges . U.S. Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois has suggested charging a toll upon motorists who use the new bridges to help pay for their construction . However , a 1998 study , which researched all river crossing options to replace the bridges , deemed new tolls were not viable . 
 In addition to the new river crossing , the mainline of I @-@ 74 between 53rd Street in Davenport and the Avenue of the Cities in Moline will be widened from a four @-@ lane freeway to six lanes . Additional lanes will be picked up and dropped in selected locations . In downtown Bettendorf , the connection to US 67 will be simplified . US 67 traffic will be routed in both directions along Grant Street . State and Grant streets are currently a one @-@ way couplet through Bettendorf . A network of ramps and city streets form the interchange as it is now . A full @-@ access interchange will be built in its place at Grant Street . 
 Construction along the corridor has already been completed at the 53rd Street interchange . A partial cloverleaf interchange was being added in each direction to allow traffic to enter I @-@ 74 without making left turns at its intersection with 53rd Street . This phase of construction ended around December 2012 .

 = Claud Schuster , 1st Baron Schuster = 
 Claud Schuster , 1st Baron Schuster GCB CVO KC ( 22 August 1869 – 28 June 1956 ) was a British barrister and civil servant noted for his long tenure as Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor 's Office . Born to a Mancunian business family , Schuster was educated at St. George 's School , Ascot and Winchester College before matriculating at New College , Oxford in 1888 to study history . After graduation he joined the Inner Temple with the aim of becoming a barrister , and was called to the Bar in 1895 . Practising in Liverpool , Schuster was not noted as a particularly successful barrister , and he joined Her Majesty 's Civil Service in 1899 as secretary to the Chief Commissioner of the Local Government Act Commission . 
 After serving as secretary to several more commissions , he was made Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor 's Office in 1915 . Schuster served in this position for 29 years under ten different Lord Chancellors , and with the contacts obtained thanks to his long tenure and his work outside the Office he became " one of the most influential Permanent Secretaries of the 20th century " . His influence over decisions within the Lord Chancellor 's Office and greater Civil Service led to criticism and suspicions that he was a " power behind the throne " , which culminated in a verbal attack by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Hewart in 1934 during a session of the House of Lords . Schuster retired in 1944 and was made Baron Schuster , of Cerne , in the County of Dorset . Despite being officially retired he continued to work in government circles , such as with the Allied Commission for Austria and by using his seat in the House of Lords as a way to directly criticise legislation . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Schuster was born on 22 August 1869 to Frederick Schuster , a manager of the Manchester firm of merchants Schuster , <unk> and Company , and his wife Sophia Wood , the daughter of a Lieutenant Colonel in the Indian Army . The family described themselves as " Unitarian " but were descended from Jews who had converted to Christianity in the mid @-@ 1850s and included other notable people such as Sir Arthur Schuster , Sir Felix Schuster , and later Sir George Schuster . From the age of seven he was educated at St. George 's School , Ascot , one of the most expensive preparatory schools in the country but one known for harsh treatment ; it was standard for the headmaster to flog pupils until they bled and force other students and staff to listen to their screams . During the school holidays he accompanied his father to Switzerland , where he developed a lifelong love of mountaineering and skiing . He was president of the Alpine Club from 1938 to 1940 . 
 When he was fourteen he was sent to Winchester College , which was known as both the most academic of the main public schools and also for its discomfort . Schuster 's time at St George 's had prepared him for discomfort , however , and he was noted as being very proud of attending the school . While at Winchester Schuster played Winchester College football and was occasionally involved in debates ; he was not , however , noted as a particularly exceptional pupil . He matriculated at New College , Oxford in 1888 and graduated with a second @-@ class degree in history in 1892 ; again he was not noted as a particularly outstanding student , which was attributed to the time he spent enjoying himself rather than studying . Despite his lack of academic brilliance he was invited to present the Romanes Lecture in 1949 , an honour normally only given to the most eminent alumni of Oxford . After graduation he applied to become a Fellow of All Souls College , Oxford but was rejected . 
 = = Bar work and career change = = 
 After his failure to become a Fellow of All Souls , Schuster joined the Inner Temple and was called to the bar in 1895 . He practised in Liverpool and , though he was not noted as a particularly successful barrister , he became Circuit Junior of the Northern Circuit Bar in late 1895 , an important position . By this point Schuster was married and required a steady income to support his family , something which the bar was not providing . With his love of the English language and the knowledge that he was " good with paper " Schuster decided to join Civil Service , with the intention of becoming a Permanent Secretary . 
 Schuster entered the Civil Service in 1899 and as a qualified lawyer was exempt from the required examinations , something that marked him as " different " from other civil service employees with whom he worked . His first post was as secretary to the Chief Commissioner of the Local Government Act Commission , which produced a report leading to the creation of the London County Council . After this he worked as a secretary to the Great Northern Railway and then for the workers ' union at London & Smith 's Bank Ltd . After his job at the union he was noticed by Robert Morant who employed him as a temporary legal assistant to the Board of Education on the understanding that the job would become permanent , which it did in 1907 . In 1911 he was promoted to Principal Assistant Secretary , and after Morant was appointed to the English Commission under the National Insurance Act 1911 Schuster followed him by being appointed Chief Registrar of the Friendly Societies , which granted him a place on the Societies ' committee . 
 In February 1912 he gave up his position as Chief Registrar to become Secretary ( and then legal adviser ) to the English Insurance Commission , with the newspapers of the time reporting that he had had " three promotions in two months " , a consequence of his high standing with Morant . During this period he was also involved in drafting education bills with Arthur Thring . The commission was " a galaxy of future Whitehall stars " , and contained many individuals who would later become noted civil servants in their own right , including Morant , Schuster , John Anderson , Warren Fisher and John Bradbury . The contacts Schuster made during his time on the committee were instrumental in advancing his career ; as a lawyer rather than a dedicated civil servant he was considered an outsider , and the links he made – particularly the friendships he struck up with Fisher and Anderson – helped allay this to some extent . 
 He was knighted in 1913 for his services on various committees . 
 = = Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor 's Office = = 
 In 1915 Sir Kenneth Muir Mackenzie , who had served as Permanent Secretary to the Lord Chancellor 's Office , was close to retirement . The current Lord Chancellor Lord Haldane believed that the duties of a Lord Chancellor were too much for one man , and should be divided between a Lord Chancellor and a Minister of Justice . As such he looked for a Permanent Secretary who was a qualified lawyer and who could help him set up a Ministry of Justice after the war , appointing Schuster in early 1915 . The two did not work together , however , until Haldane became Lord Chancellor for a second time in 1924 ; he was forced to resign several months before Schuster started work on 2 July 1915 after being accused of pro @-@ German sympathies .

 The first Lord Chancellor under whom Schuster served was Lord Buckmaster , who was appointed on 27 May 1915 . Although most senior government offices at this time were held by wealthy aristocrats , the office of Lord Chancellor stood out as most of the appointees were lawyers from the middle class . Buckmaster was considered " the most plebeian of Lord Chancellors " , as he was the son of a farmer and schoolteacher who later became a Justice of the Peace . Schuster became Permanent Secretary in July , a month after Buckmaster took his post , and immediately tried to make an impression on the workings of the office by modernising it ; under the previous Permanent Secretary – who abhorred time @-@ saving mechanisms – shorthand had been forbidden , and the office had owned only one typewriter . Buckmaster and Schuster had similar outlooks on World War I , with both their sons serving on the Western Front ; Schuster almost certainly helped write the 1915 memorandum Buckmaster circulated to the Westminster Cabinet arguing that forces should be concentrated on the Western Front rather than spread out in an attempt to assault other areas . 
 H. H. Asquith resigned as Prime Minister in December 1916 , and as a member of Asquith 's cabinet Buckmaster followed him . He was replaced by Lord Finlay who was appointed on 12 December . Aged 74 when he was appointed , Finlay was the oldest person to be made Lord Chancellor other than Lord Campbell , who was 80 when he was appointed in 1859 , and his age showed , with his decisions being slow and cautious . Luckily the job of the Lord Chancellor during the last two years of World War I was limited to maintaining the system rather than instituting any changes , and his tenure was uneventful . During this period Schuster was very influential in judicial appointments , phrasing his reports in such a way that Finlay could only logically accept one candidate . Although Finlay was not a member of the cabinet ( it was a War Cabinet , with limited representation of ministers ) which limited his political influence to some extent , he was close friends with Lord Haldane and through Haldane Schuster made contacts with up and coming politicians such as Sir Alan Sykes and Jimmy Thomas ; the group was described as " the future Labour Cabinet " . During Findlay 's tenure as Lord Chancellor the question of a Ministry of Justice again came up ; while the Law Society was in favour of such a department the Bar Council along with Schuster was opposed to any changes in the status quo , and as the person who prepared a report on the matter for the Lord Chancellor Schuster did his best to express his disapproval of any changes . For his continued work in the Civil Service Schuster was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1918 . A year later he was made a King 's Counsel : an odd honour for a man who no longer worked as a barrister .

 Finlay had been appointed on the conditions that he would not claim a pension ( it was war @-@ time , and there were already four retired Lord Chancellors claiming £ 5000 per year pensions ) and that he would resign when required . Despite this he was surprised when he was dismissed after the 1919 general election , first hearing about it when it was mentioned in the newspapers . His replacement Lord Birkenhead was appointed on 14 January 1919 , and was a controversial choice ; he was only 46 when appointed and was unpopular with large sections of the Bar as a result ; George V himself wrote to the Prime Minister before Birkenhead was appointed and said that " His Majesty does not feel sure that [ Birkenhead ] has established such a reputation in men 's minds as to ensure that the country will welcome him to the second highest position which can be occupied by a subject of the Crown " . Birkenhead and Schuster established a strong partnership , and Schuster played a part in instituting Birkenhead 's legal reforms , particularly those relating to the law of real property . 
 Real property law in the English and Welsh legal system had evolved from feudalism , and was an immensely complex system understood by only a small number of lawyers . In particular peculiarities meant that land owned by beneficiaries could be sold without the agreement of all the beneficiaries involved , something partially rectified by the Settled Land Act 1882 and the Land Transfer Act 1897 . Despite these statutes reform in this area was still needed , and Lord Haldane presented reform bills to parliament in 1913 , 1914 and 1915 with no real progress thanks to the opposition of the Law Society . In March 1917 a Reconstruction Subcommittee under Sir Leslie Scott was created to consider land policy after the First World War , and Schuster ( who had <unk> for Scott when working as a barrister in Liverpool ) was appointed as a member . The subcommittee decided that the law should be changed to merge real and personal property law , and that outdated aspects of land law such as <unk> and <unk> should be eliminated . When Birkenhead became Lord Chancellor in 1919 he inherited the problem of English property law , and immediately instructed Schuster to prepare the department for forcing a bill through Parliament on the matter . 
 Although there was general agreement that property law should be reformed the process was made more difficult by the various vested interests involved ; the Law Society , for example , was opposed to the changes because it would reduce the fees dedicated property solicitors could earn by making it possible for more solicitors to understand that area of law and become involved . After intense negotiation Schuster and the Law Society representative agreed that a " period of probation " lasting three years would be included in the bill , which Charles <unk> the Chief Registrar of HM Land Registry considered " a very good bargain " . When the bill finally got to the House of Commons it met additional opposition from Members of Parliament who were also members of the Law Society and Bar Council , as well as Lord Cave who later became Lord Chancellor . After further negotiations the bill was passed on 8 June 1922 , with Birkenhead taking the credit , and it became the Law of Property Act 1922 . 
 Schuster also assisted Birkenhead in his attempts to reform the administration of the court system , particularly in his preparation of the Supreme Court ( Consolidation ) Act 1925 . A committee was also set up to look into the reform of the Supreme Court , the County Courts and the Probate Services , divided into a subcommittee for each institution . Schuster served as a member of the committee , with his primary goal being to end the patronage and nepotism that filled the judicial system . Although the Supreme Court was resistant the committee did succeed in making some changes , such as introducing mandatory retirement ages for masters and clerks ; they were unable , however , to end the patronage . Schuster also attempted to reform the County Courts by increasing their jurisdiction , and a Committee on County Court Procedure ( known as the Swift Committee after its chairman Rigby Swift ) was set up in 1920 , with Schuster serving as a member . The commission concluded that HM Treasury had mismanaged the County Courts , and on 1 August 1922 the Lord Chancellor 's Office instead became responsible for the courts , with Schuster becoming Accounting Officer . The committee 's final report was used as the basis for the County Courts Act 1924 , which did much to correct the problems with the County Courts . Schuster was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath ( KCB ) in the 1920 New Year War Honours .

 By the summer of 1922 the coalition government Birkenhead was a member of began to splinter , and when it finally collapsed Birkenhead was forced to resign on 25 October 1922 . His replacement was Lord Cave , a member of the new Conservative government who was appointed on 27 October 1922 . The Conservative government under Stanley Baldwin soon ran into trouble due to his desire to introduce protectionist tariffs to protect British jobs . Baldwin called an early general election in December 1923 to serve as a referendum on the subject , and although the Conservatives remained the largest party they did not have enough Members of Parliament to claim a parliamentary majority . At the opening of the new Parliament in January 1924 the party was defeated in a vote of no confidence , and the king instead invited the Labour Party under Ramsay MacDonald to form a government . This caused various constitutional problems ; traditionally every member of a cabinet , including the Prime Minister , must be a Privy Councillor . MacDonald was not a Privy Councillor , and therefore could not be made Prime Minister . The king asked Lord Cave for a way around this problem , and as an expert on constitutional issues Schuster helped draft the response . In the end it was determined that MacDonald would be sworn in as a Privy Councillor and then invited to form a government . 
 As a member of the old Conservative government Cave left office on 23 January 1924 . He was replaced by Lord Haldane , who was serving for a second time and was sworn in on 25 January . Haldane was in favour of the creation of a Ministry of Justice , and although Schuster was privately against it he suggested that he would have accepted the responsibilities of such a Ministry on the condition that it remained under his control as the Lord Chancellor 's Office was . Haldane was ill , however , and the Labour government lasted only ten months thanks to the publishing of the Zinoviev Letter , and no large @-@ scale reforms such as the creation of a Ministry of Justice were ever pushed through . 
 = = = Lords Cave and Hailsham ( 1924 – 1928 , 1928 – 1929 ) = = = 
 After the collapse of the Labour government in October 1924 the Conservative Party returned to power , and Lord Cave became Lord Chancellor for a second time on 7 November . Spending four and a half years in office Cave had time to push through some significant reforms , including the Law of Property Act 1925 based on the 1922 act Schuster had been involved in . By 1925 Schuster had spent a decade as Permanent Secretary and was described as a " Whitehall Mandarin " , his contacts and long service allowing him greater influence over policy decisions than a Permanent Secretary normally had . The expansion of the Lord Chancellor 's Office he had overseen also gave him greater opportunities to delegate to his subordinates , allowing him more time to spend on committees and inquiries directly influencing the way the government worked . As a result of his power and influence he grew to dislike being opposed in any way , and this led to conflict between him and other heads of department . As a reward for his continued service with the Lord Chancellor 's Office he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1927 as part of the New Year Honours . 
 Lord Cave resigned on 28 March 1928 due to ill health , and died the day after . His replacement was Lord Hailsham , who was appointed by Stanley Baldwin on 29 March 1928 . Hailsham 's first tenure as Lord Chancellor lasted barely a year and highlighted the fact that despite his abilities ( many politicians considered that if he had not accepted the offer to become Lord Chancellor he would likely have become Prime Minister ) he was not a particularly innovative Lord Chancellor . For a short period in August 1928 he acted as Prime Minister ( Baldwin was on holiday in Aix @-@ en @-@ Provence ) with Schuster as his chief adviser , but he rarely went to 10 Downing Street and nothing eventful happened during his time in charge . 
 = = = Lord Sankey ( 1929 – 1935 ) = = = 
 Lord Hailsham left office in mid @-@ 1929 with the fall of the Conservative government in 1929 . His replacement was a member of the newly elected Labour Government , Lord Sankey , who was appointed on 8 June 1929 . Sankey was appointed on Schuster 's advice , and served longer with him than any other Lord Chancellor . Sankey was a " reforming " Lord Chancellor , and as part of one of his first reforms Schuster helped him draft and pass the Statute of Westminster in 1931 . 
 During this period the question of Judge 's salaries also arose , and almost caused a constitutional crisis . As Permanent Secretary Schuster was tasked with ensuring that the courts ran correctly , and although the Judges were independent they were paid by the Lord Chancellor 's Office . Although a Select Committee in 1878 had recommended that County Court Judges be paid £ 2 @,@ 000 a year this increase had still failed to appear due to the economic hardships caused by the First World War . The increase was eventually implemented in 1937 , but in the meantime High Court Judges had also been lobbying for an increase , as their pay had stayed at the same level since 1832 . Schuster and Warren Fisher had produced a report recommending a pay increase in 1920 , but again the economic hardship prevented their plan from being implemented . The 1931 economic crash led to the government passing the National Recovery Act 1931 , which reduced the salaries of High Court Judges by 20 % . The Judges , who had been expecting a pay raise rather than a pay cut , were shocked , and six High Court Judges threatened to resign , with Henry McCardie accusing Schuster of having his salary almost doubled in the last twelve years . The Prime Minister and Sankey met to write a letter to the Judges demanding that they give in ; as soon as Schuster heard about this he rushed to Whitehall to " stop the madness " . The protests from the Judges increased through 1931 and 1932 , with several judges including Albert Clauson and Arthur <unk> threatening to sue the government . After negotiations between Schuster and the judges failed to bring an end to the crisis the section of the act cutting judges ' pay was quietly dropped . 
 Soon after becoming Permanent Secretary Schuster had decided that his aim should be to make sure that the entire court system was under the control of his office , rather than partially under his control and partially under the control of HM Treasury as it had been when he started . The 1931 Royal Commission on the Civil Service recommended that all Civil Service departments take a more business @-@ like approach to their work , and spurred Schuster into making a further attempt to reorganise and reform the Lord Chancellor 's Office . As such he persuaded Sankey to set up a Departmental Committee on the Business of the Courts , with Lord Hanworth ( one of Schuster 's friends ) chairing the committee and Schuster himself sitting as a member . As he had under Lord Birkenhead Schuster attempted to reform the County Courts . Hee partially succeeded in doing when his recommendations were included in the Administration of Justice [ Appeals ] Act 1934 which sent appeals from the county courts straight to the Court of Appeal rather than the Divisional Courts . He also attempted to have the number of jury trials in civil cases reduced , something which Hanworth supported but which was blocked by the King 's Bench Division . 
 Schuster also took part in law reform after Lord Sankey decided to set up a Law Revision Committee in January 1934 which consisted of Sankey , Schuster , four judges , five barristers , one solicitor and two academic lawyers . The committee produced 86 reports from 1934 to 1939 on a variety of subjects , and many of their recommendations were made into legislation after negotiations with the Home Office . Although the Law Revision Committee fell into disuse after this it was re @-@ formed as a permanent Law Commission in 1965 . 
 In 1934 Schuster was subject to a public attack by Lord Hewart , the Lord Chief Justice . On 7 December 1934 his clerk found a bill amongst Hewart 's parliamentary papers with a clause that allowed the Lord Chancellor to appoint any Lord Justice of Appeal as Vice President of the Chancery Appeal Court , a right traditionally held by the Lord Chief Justice . Hewart immediately made plans to attend the House of Lords , where Lord Sankey was expected to move the Second Reading of the bill in question . Immediately after second reading Hewart rose and began a speech that was " as violent an attack as has ever been made in the Lords " . In it he criticised the officials of the Lord Chancellor 's Department ( which to listeners clearly meant Schuster specifically ) and insinuated that the bill was part of a conspiracy to move power from the judiciary to the politicians ( and thus the civil service ) and create a Ministry of Justice . The speech provoked uproar in the house ; a public quarrel between senior judges and civil servants had not happened in centuries , especially in such a traditionally calm and collected place . Lord Reading , himself a former Lord Chief Justice , adjourned the debate , and the following Friday Lord Hailsham , at the time the Leader of the House of Lords , made a defence of Schuster , saying that " I can show that this is an absolute delusion [ and ] that there was no such scheme ever hatched " . He showed that the proposal of a Ministry of Justice had originated in 1836 , long before Schuster became Permanent Secretary , and in addition that the report Schuster had helped prepare for Sankey was clearly biased against the creation of such a Ministry as he himself was opposed to it . He went on to praise Schuster as " the author and instigator of many great reforms " , and along with a similar speech by Lord Sankey and an amendment to the offending bill this helped appease Hewart .

 Lord Hailsham returned to power on 7 June 1935 after the election of a new government , and by this point his health was beginning to decline , limiting his effectiveness . The Second Italo @-@ Abyssinian War alerted the Civil Service and MI5 to the ambitions of Italy and Germany , and the Committee of Imperial Defence was asked to review the defence legislation that had been used in the First World War and present it to Warren Fisher . Fisher was horrified at how outdated the laws were , and with the permission of the Cabinet organised a War Legislation Committee under Schuster to draft a new code of defence regulations . Norman Brook , later head of the Civil Service , served as secretary , and the Committee was described as " a model piece of organisation " thanks to the work of Schuster as chairman . The regulations drafted by the Committee were eventually made into law after the passing of the Emergency Powers ( Defence ) Act 1939 .
