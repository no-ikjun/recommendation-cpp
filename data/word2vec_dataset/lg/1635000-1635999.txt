 = = Coat of arms = = 
 Coatbridge was given burgh status in 1885 , and was granted a coat of arms by the Lord Lyon in 1892 . The arms have a black field and on it a flaming tower to represent a blast furnace and Coatbridge 's industrial tradition . The crest is a monk holding a stone in his left hand . The stone relates to the old parish of Monklands and the legend of the ' aul ' Kirk stane ' . The legend of the ' aul ' Kirk stane ' is that a pilgrim undertaking a penance from Glasgow carried a stone in the direction of Monklands . When he could carry the stone no further ( or in another version of the legend , when an angel spoke to him ) he laid the stone down . It was where the stone came to rest that he was to build a church . The church is the present day Old Monkland Kirk , at which the stone can still be seen . 
 The Latin motto ' <unk> est <unk> ' translates as ' to work is to pray ' , which originates in the writings of St. Benedict and is commonly associated with the Cistercian Order whose monks came to Monklands in the 12th century . 
 = = Local government = = 
 Coatbridge is represented by three tiers of elected government . North Lanarkshire Council , the unitary local authority for Coatbridge , is based at Motherwell , and is the executive , deliberative and legislative body responsible for local governance . The Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters such as education , health and justice , while reserved matters are dealt with by the Parliament of the United Kingdom . 
 Up until 1975 , Coatbridge had its own Burgh Council . Between 1975 and 1996 , Coatbridge was part of Monklands District Council and Strathclyde Regional Council . During the by @-@ election campaign in Monklands East of 1994 , there were accusations of sectarianism and nepotism in favour of Coatbridge over neighbouring Airdrie by Monklands District Council . See <unk> and Monklands East by @-@ election , 1994 . The fact that all 17 Labour councillors were Roman Catholic led to Coatbridge being seen as a ' Catholic town ' . Subsequent inquiries showed no evidence of sectarianism , but allegations of nepotism were shown to be true . 
 Coatbridge is presently part of the burgh constituency of Coatbridge , <unk> and <unk> , electing one Member of Parliament ( MP ) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom . Before the constituency 's creation in 2005 , Coatbridge lay in the Coatbridge and <unk> constituency . Tom Clarke of the Scottish Labour Party has been the MP since 1982 . For the purposes of the Scottish Parliament , Coatbridge forms part of the Coatbridge and <unk> constituency , which is represented by Elaine Smith MSP , also Labour . Coatbridge is further represented by seven regional MSPs from the Central Scotland electoral region . A small part of the eastern fringes of the town forms part of the Airdrie and Shotts constituency . 
 Notable politicians from Coatbridge are Baroness Liddell , a former MP who was formerly both Secretary of State for Scotland and Britain 's High Commissioner in Australia , and Lord Reid , also a former MP who was the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and Home Secretary . Lord Reid is a former Chairman of Celtic FC .

 During the 19th century , Irish people began to arrive in large numbers in Coatbridge . The 1851 census recorded that the Irish constituted 35 @.@ 8 % of the local population . Although while a significant proportion of these emigrants were Protestant , the majority were Catholic . By 1901 , the percentage of Irish @-@ born people in Coatbridge had fallen to around 15 % , but remained the highest of all the major towns in Scotland . In the 2001 census Irish ethnicity was recorded at just over 1 % , although just over half the population claimed their religious denomination as Roman Catholicism . In 1985 , 56 % of the population of Coatbridge were Roman Catholic . 
 In 2006 , Coatbridge ( along with Port Glasgow and Clydebank ) was identified as ' the least Scottish town in Scotland ' due to having the highest percentage of Irish names in the country . Reportedly more than 28 % of adults in Coatbridge had names with Irish origins . 
 Other immigrants to Coatbridge have included in the 1880s a small number of Lithuanians . In 1905 , part of a ' wave ' of immigrants from Monte Cassino in Italy settled in Coatbridge . A small number of Polish people had stayed in Coatbridge after a Polish tank regiment was stationed in the town during WWII . The 1960 Coatbridge town plan forecast the population to reach 76 @,@ 000 by 1990 . 
 One local author argued that despite the population apparently remaining relatively static during the 1970s , Coatbridge 's population has declined by around 15 @,@ 000 due to emigration .

 = Lactarius vinaceorufescens = 
 Lactarius vinaceorufescens , commonly known as the yellow @-@ staining milkcap or the yellow @-@ latex milky , is a poisonous species of fungus in the family Russulaceae . It produces mushrooms with pinkish @-@ cinnamon caps up to 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) wide held by pinkish @-@ white stems up to 7 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) long . The closely spaced whitish to pinkish buff gills develop wine @-@ red spots in age . When it is cut or injured , the mushroom oozes a white latex that rapidly turns bright sulfur @-@ yellow . The species , common and widely distributed in North America , grows in the ground in association with conifer trees . There are several other Lactarius species that bear resemblance to L. vinaceorufescens , but most can be distinguished by differences in staining reactions , macroscopic characteristics , or habitat . 
 = = Taxonomy and classification = = 
 The species was first described by American mycologists Lexemuel Ray Hesler and Alexander H. Smith in 1960 , based on specimens collected in Muskegon , Michigan in 1936 . In the same publication , they also named the variety Lactarius vinaceorufescens var. fallax to account for individuals with prominently projecting pleurocystidia measuring 9 – 12 µm broad , but they reduced this to synonymy with the main species in their 1979 monograph of North American Lactarius species . The fungus is classified in the subsection <unk> of the subgenus <unk> in the genus Lactarius , along with other species with latex that stains the fruit body tissue yellow , or with latex that slowly become yellow upon exposure to air . 
 The specific epithet vinaceorufescens is derived from the Latin word meaning " becoming wine reddish " . The mushroom is commonly known as the " yellow @-@ latex milky " or the " yellow @-@ staining milkcap " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of L. vinaceorufescens is initially convex , then becomes broadly convex to nearly flat , and reaches diameters of 4 – 12 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 4 @.@ 7 in ) wide . The cap margin is rolled inwards at first , but later expands , becoming somewhat uplifted and uneven with age . The cap surface is smooth , pale pinkish @-@ cinnamon with pinkish @-@ buff at the margin when young , becoming darker pinkish @-@ cinnamon to <unk> @-@ cinnamon when older , faintly zoned with bands or water spots of nearly the same color . The gills are attached to slightly decurrent , narrow , close together , and often forked near the stem . There are several tiers of lamellulae ( short gills that do not fully extend to the stem from the cap margin ) . The gills are initially whitish to pinkish @-@ buff , later spotting wine red ( vinaceous ) to pinkish @-@ brown or dark reddish @-@ brown . The latex that is exuded when the mushroom is cut or injured is initially white , but rapidly turns sulfur @-@ yellow . 
 The stem is 4 – 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 2 @.@ 8 in ) long by 1 – 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 0 in ) thick , nearly equal in width throughout or enlarged slightly downward , and hollow . The stem surface is nearly smooth , with white to brownish stiff hairs at the base , pinkish @-@ white overall , and darkening with age . The flesh is moderately thick , white to pinkish , staining bright sulfur yellow . It has an acrid taste . The spore print is white to yellowish . The mushrooms are poisonous ; as a general rule , several guide books recommend to avoid the consumption of Lactarius species with latex that turns yellow . 
 The spores are roughly spherical to broadly ellipsoid , hyaline ( translucent ) , amyloid , and measure 6 @.@ 5 – 9 by 6 – 7 µm . They are ornamented with warts and ridges that sometimes form a partial reticulum , with prominences up to 0 @.@ 8 µm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are four @-@ spored , and measure 28 – 33 by 8 – 10 µm . The pleurocystidia ( cystidia found on the gill faces ) are roughly cylindrical to narrowly club @-@ shaped when they are young , but soon broaden in the mid portion and taper to an abrupt point ; they reach dimensions of 40 – 68 ( up to 80 µm ) by 9 – 13 µm . The cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edges ) are roughly club @-@ shaped or ventricose with acute apices , and measure 32 – 44 by 6 – 10 µm . Clamp connections are absent in the hyphae . The cap cuticle is a thin ixocutis composed of gelatinous hyphae that are typically 2 – 4 µm wide . Projecting out from the cuticle surface are the ends of numerous connective hyphae , about 5 – 15 µm long . 
 = = Similar species = = 
 Lactarius <unk> has nearly identical microscopic features to L. vinaceorufescens , but macroscopically , it does not have the reddish @-@ vinaceous stains that develop on the cap , gills , and stem of L. vinaceorufescens , and it grows on the ground under oak . Another lookalike is L. <unk> , but it may be distinguished from L. vinaceorufescens by several features : a smaller fruit body ; a whitish cap that becomes brownish @-@ red with age and does not spot vinaceous or brown ; bitter to faintly acrid latex ; and slightly smaller spores . L. <unk> is also similar , but it has a whitish to pale yellowish @-@ cinnamon cap with slightly darker spots and grows under hardwoods ( especially oak ) on well @-@ drained , often sandy soil , and its gills do not discolor or spot vinaceous or brown . 
 Other superficially similar species include L. <unk> , L. rufus , L. <unk> , L. fragilis and L. rufulus , but none of these species have the yellow staining reaction characteristic of L. vinaceorufescens . The edible species Lactarius <unk> has an orange @-@ brown to light grayish @-@ brown cap with thin bands of dark grayish @-@ brown , a watery latex , and whitish to tan flesh with an odor resembling maple sugar or burnt sugar . Lactarius <unk> , the " sulfur @-@ milk Lactarius " , has an <unk> cap and white latex that slowly changes yellow upon exposure to air ; it is typically found in broadleaf and mixed woods . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 The fruit bodies of Lactarius vinaceorufescens grow scattered or in groups on the ground under pine between August and October . The species is known to develop mycorrhizal associations with Douglas fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii ) . It is a fairly common and widely distributed species in North America . The mushroom has been found in boreal forests and high @-@ elevation forests of the Southern Appalachians , associated with the tree genera Picea , Abies , and Pinus . In California , it has been noted to commonly co @-@ occur with L. fragilis , L. <unk> , Russula emetica , and R. cremoricolor . 
 = Hawker Hunter = 
 The Hawker Hunter is a transonic British jet aircraft developed in the late 1940s and early 1950s . The single @-@ seat Hunter entered service as a manoeuvrable fighter aircraft , and later operated in fighter @-@ bomber and reconnaissance roles in numerous conflicts . Two @-@ seat variants remained in use for training and secondary roles with the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) and Royal Navy until the early 1990s . The Hunter was also widely exported , serving with 21 other air forces . Sixty years after its original introduction it was still in active service , operated by the Lebanese Air Force until 2014 . 
 On 7 September 1953 , the modified first prototype broke the world air speed record for jet @-@ powered aircraft , achieving 727 @.@ 63 mph ( 1 @,@ 171 @.@ 01 km / h ; 632 @.@ 29 kn ) . Hunters were also used by two RAF display teams : the " Black Arrows " , who on one occasion looped a record @-@ breaking 24 examples in formation , and later the " Blue Diamonds " , who flew 16 aircraft . Overall , 1 @,@ 972 Hunters were produced by Hawker Siddeley and under licence . In British service , the aircraft was replaced by the English Electric Lightning , the Hawker Siddeley Harrier and the McDonnell Douglas F @-@ 4 Phantom II . 
 = = Development = = 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 At the end of the Second World War , it was apparent that jet propulsion would be the future of fighter development . Many companies were quick to come up with airframe designs for this new means of propulsion . Hawker Aviation 's chief designer , Sydney Camm , proposed the Hawker <unk> for the RAF , but the demonstrator failed to interest them . Further modifications to the basic design resulted in the Hawker Sea Hawk carrier @-@ based fighter . The Sea Hawk had a straight wing and used the Rolls @-@ Royce Nene turbojet engine , both features that rapidly became obsolete . 
 Seeking better performance and fulfilment of the Air Ministry Specification <unk> / 46 , Sydney Camm designed the Hawker P.1052 , which was essentially a Sea Hawk with a 35 @-@ degree swept wing . First flying in 1948 , the P.1052 demonstrated good performance and conducted several carrier trials , but did not warrant further development into a production aircraft . As a private venture , Hawker converted the second P.1052 prototype into the Hawker <unk> with swept tailplanes , a revised fuselage , and a single jet exhaust at the rear . First flown on 19 June 1950 , the <unk> was promising enough to draw interest from the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) , but further development was stalled by difficulties with the engine reheat . The sole prototype was lost in a crash in 1951 . 
 = = = P.1067 = = = 
 In 1946 , the Air Ministry issued Specification <unk> / 46 for a daytime jet @-@ powered interceptor . Camm prepared a new design for a swept @-@ winged fighter powered by the upcoming Rolls @-@ Royce Avon turbojet . The Avon 's major advantage over the Rolls @-@ Royce Nene , used in the earlier Sea Hawk , was the axial compressor , which allowed for a much smaller engine diameter and provided greater thrust ; this single engine gave roughly the same power as the two Rolls @-@ Royce <unk> of the Gloster Meteors that would be replaced by the new fighter . In March 1948 , the Air Ministry issued a revised Specification F.3 / 48 , which demanded a speed of 629 mph ( 1 @,@ 010 km / h ) at 45 @,@ 000 ft ( 13 @,@ 700 m ) and a high rate of climb , while carrying an armament of four 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) or two 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 18 in ) cannon ( rather than the large @-@ calibre gun demanded by earlier specifications ) . Initially fitted with a single air intake in the nose and a T @-@ tail , the project rapidly evolved into the more familiar Hunter shape . The intakes were moved to the wing roots to make room for weapons and radar in the nose , and a more conventional tail arrangement was devised as a result of stability concerns . 
 The P.1067 first flew from RAF Boscombe Down on 20 July 1951 , powered by a 6 @,@ 500 lbf ( 28 @.@ 91 kN ) Avon 103 engine . The second prototype , which was fitted with production avionics , armament and a 7 @,@ 550 lbf ( 33 @.@ 58 kN ) Avon 107 turbojet , first flew on 5 May 1952 . As an insurance against Avon development problems , Hawker modified the design to accommodate another axial turbojet , the 8 @,@ 000 lbf ( 35 @.@ 59 kN ) Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire 101 . Fitted with a Sapphire , the third prototype flew on 30 November 1952 . 
 The Ministry of Supply ordered the Hunter into production in March 1950 . The Hunter F.1 , fitted with a 7 @,@ 600 lbf ( 33 @.@ 80 kN ) Avon 113 turbojet , flew on 16 March 1953 . The first 20 aircraft were , in effect , a pre @-@ production series and featured a number of " one @-@ off " modifications such as blown flaps and area ruled fuselage . On 7 September 1953 , the sole Hunter Mk 3 ( the modified first prototype , WB 188 ) flown by Neville Duke broke the world air speed record for jet @-@ powered aircraft , achieving 727 @.@ 63 mph ( 1 @,@ 171 @.@ 01 km / h ) over Littlehampton . The record stood for under three weeks before being broken on 25 September 1953 by an RAF Supermarine Swift flown by Michael Lithgow . 
 = = Design = = 
 = = = Overview = = = 
 The Hunter entered service with the Royal Air Force as an interceptor aircraft . It was the first jet aircraft produced by Hawker for the RAF . From the outset it was clear that the type had exceptional performance , being the first RAF aircraft capable of effectively matching the English Electric Canberra bomber . The Hunter also set numerous aviation records , including absolute speed records . The type was also lauded for its quick turnaround time , enabled by features such as its removable gun pack , pressurised fuelling system , and easy handling in flight . 
 The definitive version of the Hunter was the FGA.9 , on which the majority of export versions were based . Although the Supermarine Swift had initially been politically favoured by the British Government , the Hunter proved far more successful , and had a lengthy service life with various operators , in part due to its low maintenance requirements and operating costs . 
 As the RAF received newer aircraft capable of supersonic speeds to perform the air interceptor role , many Hunters would be modified and re @-@ equipped for undertaking ground @-@ attack and reconnaissance missions instead . Hunters deemed surplus to the RAF 's requirements were also quickly refurbished for continued service abroad . The Hunter would be procured by a considerable number of foreign nations . In addition to former RAF aircraft , roughly half of the nearly 2 @,@ 000 Hunters produced had been manufactured specifically for overseas customers . The Hunter would be in operational service with the RAF for over 30 years . As late as 1996 , hundreds were still in active service with various operators across the world .

 The single @-@ seat fighter versions of the Hunter were armed with four 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 18 in ) ADEN cannon , with 150 rounds of ammunition per gun . The cannon and ammunition boxes were contained in a single pack that could be removed from the aircraft for rapid re @-@ arming and maintenance . Unusually , the barrels of the cannon remained in the aircraft while the pack was removed and changed . In the two @-@ seat version , either a single 30 mm ADEN cannon was carried or , in some export versions , two , with a removable ammunition tank . Later versions of the Hunter were fitted with SNEB Pods ; these were 68 mm ( 2 @.@ 68 in ) rocket projectiles in 18 @-@ round Matra pods , providing an effective strike capability against ground targets . 
 The Hunter featured a nose @-@ mounted ranging radar , providing automatic ranging for aiming various armaments . Other equipment included pylon @-@ mounted underwing external fuel tanks , a forward @-@ facing gun camera , and large streamlined pods for collecting expended shell cases beneath the gun pack . It was the placing of those pods which led to the plane getting the humorous nickname " Huntress " , because they resemble breasts . Several variants were fitted with tail @-@ mounted brake parachutes . Typically , export Hunters were equipped to be compatible with additional types of missiles , such as the AIM @-@ 9 Sidewinder air @-@ to @-@ air missile and the AGM @-@ 65 Maverick air @-@ to @-@ surface missile . 
 = = = Layout and structure = = = 
 The Hunter is a conventional swept wing all @-@ metal monoplane . The fuselage is of monocoque construction , with a removable rear section for engine maintenance . The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots and has a single <unk> in the rear of the fuselage . The mid @-@ mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35 ° and slight anhedral , the tailplanes and fin are also swept . The Hunter 's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models , such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges , underwing fuel tanks to increase range , leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties , and a large ventral air brake . 
 The airframe of the Hunter consists of six interchangeable major sections : the forward fuselage ( housing the cockpit and armament pack ) , center fuselage ( including the integral wing roots and air duct intakes ) , rear fuselage , tail unit assembly , and two individually produced wings . Production was divided up so major sections could be completed individually and manufacturing of the type could be dispersed to reduce vulnerability to attack . Establishing initial full @-@ rate production for the type was difficult , as manufacturing the Hunter required the development of 3 @,@ 250 tool designs and the procurement of 40 @,@ 000 fixtures , jigs , and tools . 
 = = = Engine = = = 
 The P.1067 first flew from RAF Boscombe Down on 20 July 1951 , powered by a 6 @,@ 500 lbf ( 28 @.@ 91 kN ) Rolls @-@ Royce Avon 103 engine from an English Electric Canberra bomber . The second prototype was fitted with a 7 @,@ 550 lbf ( 33 @.@ 58 kN ) Avon 107 turbojet . Hawker 's third prototype was powered by an 8 @,@ 000 lbf ( 35 @.@ 59 kN ) Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire 101 . Production Hunters were fitted with either the Avon or the Sapphire engine . 
 Early on in the Hunter 's service the Avon engines proved to have poor surge margins , and worryingly suffered compressor stalls when the cannon were fired , sometimes resulting in flameouts . The practise of " fuel dipping " , reducing fuel flow to the engine when the cannon were fired , was a satisfactory solution . Although the Sapphire did not suffer from the flameout problems of the Avon and had better fuel economy , Sapphire @-@ powered Hunters suffered many engine failures . The RAF elected to persevere with the Avon to simplify supply and maintenance , since the Canberra bomber used the same engine . 
 The RAF sought more thrust than was available from the Avon 100 series ; in response Rolls @-@ Royce developed the Avon 200 series engine . This was an almost wholly new design , equipped with a new compressor to put an end to surge problems , an annular combustion chamber , and an improved fuel control system . The resulting Avon 203 produced 10 @,@ 000 lbf ( 44 @.@ 48 kN ) of thrust , and was the engine for the Hunter <unk>

 The Hunter F.1 entered service with the Royal Air Force in July 1954 . It was the first high @-@ speed jet aircraft equipped with radar and fully powered flight controls to go into widespread service with the RAF . The Hunter replaced the Gloster Meteor , the Canadair Sabre , and the de Havilland Venom jet fighters in service . Initially , low internal fuel capacity restricted the Hunter 's performance , giving it only a maximum flight endurance of about an hour . A tragic incident occurred on 8 February 1956 , when a flight of eight Hunters was redirected to another airfield owing to adverse weather conditions . Six of the eight aircraft ran out of fuel and crashed , killing one pilot . 
 Another difficulty encountered during the aircraft 's introduction was the occurrence of surging and stalling with the Avon engines . The F.2 , which used the Armstrong @-@ Siddeley Sapphire engine , did not suffer from this issue . Further problems occurred ; ejected cannon ammunition links had a tendency to strike and damage the underside of the fuselage , and diverting the gas emitted by the cannon during firing was another necessary modification . The original split @-@ flap airbrakes caused adverse changes in pitch trim and were quickly replaced by a single ventral airbrake . This meant , however , that the airbrake could not be used for landings . 
 To address the problem of range , a production Hunter F.1 was fitted with a modified wing that featured bag @-@ type fuel tanks in the leading edge and " wet " hardpoints . The resulting Hunter F.4 first flew on 20 October 1954 , and entered service in March 1955 . A distinctive Hunter feature added on the F.4 was the pair of blisters under the cockpit , which collected spent ammunition links to prevent airframe damage . Crews dubbed them " <unk> " after the contemporary movie star . The Sapphire @-@ powered version of the F.4 was designated the Hunter <unk> 
 The RAF later received Hunters equipped with an improved Avon engine . The Avon 203 produced 10 @,@ 000 lbf ( 44 @.@ 48 kN ) of thrust and was fitted to <unk> , which became the first Hunter <unk> Some other revisions on the F.6 included a revised fuel tank layout , the centre fuselage tanks being replaced by new ones in the rear fuselage ; the " Mod 228 " wing , which has a distinctive " dogtooth " leading edge notch to alleviate the pitch @-@ up problem ; and four " wet " hardpoints , finally giving the aircraft a good ferry range . The Hunter F.6 was given the company designation Hawker <unk> 
 During the Suez Crisis of 1956 , Hunters of No. 1 and No. 34 Squadrons based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus flew escort for English Electric Canberra bombers on offensive missions into Egypt . For most of the conflict the Hunters engaged in local air defence due to their lack of range . 
 During the Brunei Revolt in 1962 , the Royal Air Force deployed Hunters and Gloster Javelins over Brunei to provide support for British ground forces ; Hunters launched both dummy and real strafing runs on ground targets to intimidate and pin down rebels . In one event , several Bruneian and expatriate hostages were due to be executed by rebels . Hunter aircraft flew over Limbang while Royal Marines from 42 Commando rescued the hostages in a fierce battle . In the following years of the Borneo Confrontation , Hunters were deployed along with other RAF aircraft in Borneo and Malaya . 
 The Hunter F.6 was retired from its day fighter role in the RAF by 1963 , being replaced by the much faster English Electric Lightning interceptor . Many <unk> were then given a new lease of life in the close air support role , converting into the Hunter FGA.9 variant . The FGA.9 saw frontline use from 1960 to 1971 , alongside the closely related Hunter <unk> tactical reconnaissance variant . The Hunters were also used by two RAF display units ; the " Black Arrows " of No. 111 Squadron who set a record by looping and barrel rolling 22 Hunters in formation , and later the " Blue Diamonds " of No. 92 Squadron who flew 16 Hunters . 
 In Aden in May 1964 , Hunter <unk> and <unk> of No. 43 Squadron RAF and No. 8 Squadron RAF were used extensively during the <unk> campaign against insurgents attempting to overthrow the Federation of South Arabia . SAS forces would routinely call in air strikes that required considerable precision , and , predominantly using 3 @-@ inch high explosive rockets and 30 mm ADEN cannon , the Hunter proved an able ground @-@ attack platform . Both squadrons continued operations with their Hunters until the UK withdrew from Aden in November 1967 . 
 Hunters were flown by <unk> , No. 234 and No. 79 Squadrons acting in training roles for foreign and Commonwealth students . These remained in service until after the Hawk <unk> entered service in the mid @-@ 1970s . Two @-@ seat trainer versions of the Hunter , the T.7 and T.8 , remained in use for training and secondary roles by the RAF and Royal Navy until the early 1990s ; when the Blackburn Buccaneer retired from service , the requirement for Hunter trainers was nullified and consequently all were retired . 
 = = = Indian Air Force = = = 
 In 1954 , India arranged to purchase Hunters as a part of a wider arms deal with Britain , ordering 140 Hunter single @-@ seat fighters at the same time that Pakistan announced its purchase of several North American F @-@ 86 Sabre jet fighters . The Indian Air Force ( IAF ) was the first to operate the Hunter <unk> trainers , placing an initial order in 1957 . The more powerful engine was considered beneficial in a hot environment , allowing for greater takeoff weights . During the 1960s , Pakistan investigated the possibility of buying as many as 40 English Electric Lightnings , but Britain was unenthusiastic about the potential sales opportunity because of the damage it would do to its relations with India , which at the time was still awaiting the delivery of large numbers of ex @-@ RAF Hunters . 
 By the outbreak of the Sino @-@ Indian War in 1962 , India had assembled one of the largest air forces in Asia , and the Hunter was the nation 's primary and most capable interceptor . During the conflict , the Hunter demonstrated its superiority over China 's Russian @-@ sourced MiGs and gave India a strategic advantage in the air . India 's aerial superiority deterred Chinese Ilyushin Il @-@ 4 bombers from attacking targets within India . In 1962 , India had selected to procure its first supersonic @-@ capable fighter , the Mikoyan @-@ Gurevich MiG @-@ 21 ; large numbers of Russian @-@ built fighters had increasingly supplemented the aging Hunters in the interceptor role by 1970 . 
 The Hunter was to play a major role during the Indo @-@ Pakistani War of 1965 ; along with the Gnat the Hunter was India 's primary air defence fighter , and regularly engaged in dogfights with the Pakistani F @-@ 86 Sabres and F @-@ 104 Starfighters . The aerial war saw both sides conducting thousands of sorties in a single month . Both sides claimed victory in the air war , Pakistan claimed to have destroyed 104 aircraft against its own losses of 19 , while India claimed to have destroyed 73 enemy aircraft and lost 35 of its own . Despite the intense fighting , the conflict was effectively a stalemate . 
 IAF Hunters performed extensive operations during the Indo @-@ Pakistani War of 1971 ; India had six combat @-@ ready squadrons of Hunters at the start of the conflict . Pakistani infantry and armoured forces attacked the Indian outpost of Longewala in an event now known as the Battle of Longewala . Six IAF Hunters stationed at Jaisalmer Air Force Base were able to halt the Pakistani advance at Longewala by conducting non @-@ stop bombing raids . The aircraft attacked Pakistani tanks , armoured personnel carriers and gun positions and contributed to the increasingly chaotic battlefield conditions , which ultimately led to the retreat of Pakistan 's ground forces . Hunters were also used for many ground @-@ attack missions and raids inside Pakistan 's borders , such as the high @-@ profile bombing of the Attock Oil refinery to limit Pakistani fuel supplies . In the aftermath of the conflict , Pakistan claimed to have shot down a total of 32 of India 's Hunters . 
 Due to unfavourable currency conditions and conflicting pressures on the military budget , several prospective procurements of modern aircraft such as the SEPECAT Jaguar and the British Aerospace Sea Harrier were put on hold following the 1971 war ; the indigenously developed HAL HF @-@ 24 <unk> had also not been as successful as hoped , thus the IAF decided to retain the ageing fleets of Hunters and English Electric Canberra bombers . After considering several foreign aircraft to replace the Hunter , including the Dassault Mirage F1 , the Saab 37 Viggen , and several Soviet models , the Indian government announced its intention to procure 200 Jaguars , a large portion of which were to be assembled domestically , in October 1978 . In 1996 , the last of the IAF 's Hunters were phased out of service , the remaining single squadron operating the Hunter converting to the newer Sukhoi Su @-@ 30MKI . 
 = = = Swedish Air Force = = = 
 In the early 1950s , the Swedish Air Force saw the need for an interceptor that could reach enemy bombers at a higher altitude than the J 29 <unk> that formed the backbone of the fighter force . A contract for 120 Hawker Hunter Mk 50s ( equivalent to the Mk 4 ) was therefore signed on 29 June 1954 and the first aircraft was delivered on 26 August 1955 . The model was designated J 34 and was assigned to the F 8 and F 18 wings that defended Stockholm . The J 34 was armed with four 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 18 in ) cannon and two Sidewinders . The Swedish Air Force 's aerobatic team <unk> Hunters used five J 34s during the late 1950s . The J 34s were gradually replaced by supersonic J 35 Draken and reassigned to less prominent air wings , F 9 in Gothenburg and F 10 in <unk> , during the 1960s . 
 A project to improve the performance of the J 34 resulted in one Hunter being fitted with a Swedish @-@ designed afterburner in 1958 . While this significantly increased the engine 's thrust , there was little improvement in overall performance , thus the project was shelved . The last of the J 34s was retired from service in 1969 . 
 = = = Swiss Air Force = = = 
 In 1957 , the Swiss Air Force performed an extensive evaluation of several aircraft for a prospective purchase ; competitors included the North American F @-@ 86 Sabre , the Folland Gnat , and the Hawker Hunter ; a pair of Hunters were loaned to the Swiss for further trials and testing . In January 1958 , the government of Switzerland chose to terminate their independent fighter aircraft project , the in @-@ development FFA P @-@ 16 , instead choosing to order 100 Hunters to replace their existing fleet of de Havilland Vampire <unk> further development of the indigenous P @-@ 16 was discontinued . This initial order for 100 single @-@ seat Hunters consisted of 12 refurbished RAF <unk> , and 88 new @-@ built <unk> 
 Swiss Hunters were operated as interceptors , with a secondary ground @-@ attack role ; from 1963 onwards , the outboard wing pylons were modified to carry two AIM @-@ 9 Sidewinder air @-@ to @-@ air missiles . In the ground @-@ attack role , the Swiss Air Force maintained an arsenal of conventional iron bombs , a number of compatible napalm bombs were also maintained for intended use by the Hunters . In the interceptor role , the Hunters were supplemented by a surface @-@ to @-@ air missile ( SAM ) defence system also procured from the United Kingdom , based on the Bristol Bloodhound . A portion of the Hunter fleet was permanently placed in reserve as " sleeper squadrons " , housed in remote mountain @-@ side hangars . It was planned that in a large @-@ scale conflict , these aircraft would fly from adjacent highways , using them as improvised runways . 
 The <unk> Suisse flight demonstration team were prominent fliers of the Hawker Hunter for several decades . Squadron aircraft were fitted with smoke generators on the engine exhausts and , later on , were painted in a distinctive red @-@ and @-@ white livery . The group officially formed on 22 August 1964 , and used the Hunter as its display aircraft until it was withdrawn from use in 1994 , the team continued to perform flight display using newer aircraft . 
 The Hunter fleet endured several attempts to procure successor aircraft to the type ; in the case of the Dassault Mirage III this had been due to excessive cost overruns and poor project management rather than the attributes of the Hunter itself . A second attempt to replace the Hunter resulted in a competition between the French Dassault Milan and the U.S. LTV A @-@ 7 Corsair II . Although the A @-@ 7 was eventually chosen as the winner , it would not be purchased and further 30 refurbished Hunters ( 22 <unk> and eight <unk> trainers ) were purchased in 1974 instead . 
 By 1975 , plans were laid to replace the Hunter in the air @-@ to @-@ air role with a more modern fighter aircraft , the Northrop F @-@ 5E Tiger II . The Hunter remained in a key role within the Swiss Air Force ; like the RAF 's Hunter fleet , the type transitioned to become the country 's primary ground attack platform , replacing the Venom . While the Swiss Hunters already had more armament options than the RAF aircraft , being cleared to carry Oerlikon 80 mm rockets instead of the elderly 3 @-@ inch rockets used by the RAF , to carry bombs from both inner and outer pylons and to launch AIM @-@ 9 Sidewinder air @-@ to @-@ air missiles , the change to a primary air @-@ to @-@ ground role resulted in the Hunter 80 upgrade , adding chaff / flare dispensers , BL755 cluster bombs and the ability to carry AGM @-@ 65 Maverick missiles . 
 In the 1990s , the discovery of wing cracking lead to the quick scrapping of all Hunter <unk> The end of the Cold War also allowed Switzerland to retire its Hunters earlier than expected , even before taking delivery of the McDonnell Douglas F / A @-@ 18 Hornets that had been ordered as replacements for the type ; the Hunter was completely withdrawn from Swiss service in 1994 . Author Fiona Lombardi stated of the retirement of the Hunter , the Swiss Air Force " definitively lost the capability to carry out air @-@ to @-@ ground operations " . 
 = = = Republic of Singapore Air Force = = = 
 Singapore was an enthusiastic operator of the Hunter , first ordering the aircraft in 1968 during a massive expansion of the city @-@ state 's armed forces ; deliveries began in 1971 and were completed by 1973 . At the time , considerable international controversy was generated as Britain ( and , as was later revealed , the U.S. ) had refused to sell Hunters to neighbouring Malaysia , sparking fears of a regional arms race and accusations of favouritism . The Republic of Singapore Air Force ( RSAF ) eventually received 46 refurbished Hunters to equip two squadrons . 
 In the late 1970s , the Singaporean Hunter fleet was upgraded and modified by Lockheed Aircraft Services Singapore ( <unk> ) with an additional hardpoint under the forward fuselage and another two inboard pylons ( wired only for AIM @-@ 9 Sidewinders ) before the main gears , bringing to a total of seven hardpoints for external stores and weapons delivery . As a result of these upgrades , they were redesignated as <unk> , FR.74S and <unk> The RSAF Black Knights , Singapore Air Force 's aerobatic team , flew Hunters from 1973 until 1989 . 
 By 1991 , Singapore 's fleet of combat aircraft included the General Dynamics F @-@ 16 Fighting Falcon , the Northrop F @-@ 5 Tiger II , as well as the locally modernised and upgraded ST Aerospace A @-@ <unk> Super Skyhawk ; the Hunters were active but obsolete in comparison . The type was finally retired and phased out of service in 1992 , with the 21 surviving airframes being sold off to an Australian warbird broker , Pacific Hunter Aviation Pty , in 1995 . 
 = = = Lebanese Air Force = = = 
 The Lebanese Air Force operated Hawker Hunters from 1958 to 2014 . A Lebanese Hunter shot down an Israeli jet over <unk> in the early 1960s ; its pilot was captured by the Lebanese Armed Forces . One Hunter was shot down on the first day of the Six @-@ Day War by the Israeli Air Force . They were used infrequently during the Lebanese Civil War , and eventually fell out of usage and went into storage during the 1980s . 
 In August 2007 , the Lebanese Armed Forces planned to put its Hunters back into service following the 2007 Lebanon conflict , to deal with Fatah al @-@ Islam militants in the Nahr el @-@ <unk> camp north of Tripoli . The programme was delayed by lack of spare parts for the aircraft , such as cartridges for the Martin @-@ Baker ejection seats . On 12 November 2008 , 50 years after its original introduction , the Lebanese Air Force returned four of its eight Hunters to service with 2nd Squadron , based at Rayak AB : one two @-@ seater and three single @-@ seaters ′ . Military exercises were conducted with Hunters , such as those that took place on 12 July 2010 . The Hunters were retired from service during 2014 .

 During the 1950s , the Royal Rhodesian Air Force was an important export customer of Britain , purchasing not only Hunters but De Havilland Vampires and Canberra bombers as well . Rhodesia later deployed its Hunter <unk> extensively against ZANLA and ZIPRA guerrillas during the Rhodesian Bush War in the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s , occasionally engaging in cross @-@ border raids over Zambia and Mozambique . The Zimbabwean Air Force Hunters were flown to support Laurent Kabila 's loyalists during the Second Congo War , and were reported to be involved in the Mozambican Civil War . In Somalia , the Siad Barre regime 's fleet of ageing Hunters , often piloted by former Rhodesian servicemen , carried out several bombing missions against rebel units in the late 1980s . 
 = = = = Belgium and the Netherlands = = = = 
 The Belgian Air Force received 112 Hunter <unk> between 1956 and 1957 to replace the Gloster Meteor <unk> The aircraft were built under licence in both Belgium and the Netherlands in a joint programme , some using U.S. offshore funding . SABCA and <unk> Fairey built 64 aircraft in Belgium and a further 48 were built in the Netherlands by Fokker . The Hunters were used by Nos. 1 , 3 and 9 Wings but did not serve for long ; the aircraft with 1 Wing were replaced in 1958 by the Avro Canada CF @-@ 100 Canuck , and most were scrapped afterwards . 
 The Belgian and Dutch governments subsequently ordered the improved Hunter F.6 , with Nos. 1 , 7 and 9 Wings of the Belgian Air Force receiving 112 Fokker @-@ built aircraft between 1957 and 1958 . Although built in the Netherlands , 29 aircraft had been assembled from kits in Belgium by SABCA and 59 by <unk> Fairey , and were operated by 7 and 9 Wings . No. 9 Wing was disbanded in 1960 , and by 1963 the Hunter squadrons in 7 Wing had also been disbanded . A large number of the surviving Hunters were sold to Hawker Aircraft and re @-@ built for re @-@ export to India and Iraq , with others to Chile , Kuwait and Lebanon .

 Between 1964 and 1975 , both Britain and France delivered significant quantities of arms , including Hunters , to Iraq . The Hunters were far more effective in fighting guerrilla activity than the Russian MiG @-@ 17s then operated by Iraq . In 1967 , Hunters of the Iraqi Air Force saw action after the Six @-@ Day War between Israel and several neighbouring Arab nations . During the War of Attrition Iraqi Hunters usually operated from bases in Egypt and Syria . While flying a Hunter from Iraqi Airbase H3 , Flight Lieutenant <unk> Azam , on exchange from the Pakistan Air Force , shot down three Israeli jets including a Sud Aviation Vautour and a Mirage <unk> . Some missions were also flown by the Royal Jordanian Air Force , but most of the Jordanian Hunters were destroyed on the ground on the first day of the Six @-@ Day War . Replacement Hunters for Jordanian service were acquired from both Britain and Saudi Arabia in the war 's aftermath . These were used with considerable success in ground attacks against Syrian Army tanks during the Black September Crisis . 
 = = = = South America = = = = 
 During the 1960s and 1970s , Chile completed the acquisition of Hunters from Britain for service in the Chilean Air Force . In June 1973 , the Liberian oil tanker Napier ran aground on <unk> Island , accidentally releasing 30 @,@ 000 tons of oil . After the rescue of the crew , the vessel was fired upon and set on fire by Chilean Hunters in an effort to burn the oil to avoid further environmental contamination . 
 During the 1973 Chilean coup d 'état , some of the Hunters were used by military officers as part of the effort to successfully overthrow the socialist president of Chile , Salvador Allende , on 11 September 1973 . On 10 September 1973 , coup leaders ordered the Hunters to relocate to Talcahuano in preparation . The following morning , the aircraft were used to conduct bombing missions against the presidential palace , Allende 's house in Santiago , and several radio stations loyal to the government . The UK had signed contracts prior to the Chilean coup d 'état for delivery of a further seven Hunters , as well as performing engine overhauls and the delivery of other equipment . The government under Prime Minister James Callaghan delayed the delivery of the aircraft , along with vessels and submarines also on order ; the trade unions took action to block delivery of refurbished Hunter engines at the East Kilbride plant until October 1978 . The action was led by Rolls Royce workers , Bob Fulton , Robert Sommerville and John Keenan , who hid the engines in the factory . The Government of Chile bestowed on 16 April 2015 , its highest civilian medal the Order Bernardo O 'Higgins Medal on the three workers for their action of solidarity . In 1982 , after the Falklands War , a number of Hunters were air freighted to Chile as part of the arrangements for providing support for UK operations in the South Atlantic . 
 The purchase of Hunters by Chile may have been a factor in the decision by the Peruvian Air Force to acquire Hunters of their own . Britain was keen to sell to Peru as the decision to sell Hunters to Chile became a controversial political issue for the British government following the Chilean coup ; the sale also upheld Britain 's concept of regional " balancing " .

 = Edward Sainsbury = 
 Edward Sainsbury ( 5 July 1851 – 28 October 1930 ) was an English cricketer who represented , and captained , Somerset County Cricket Club in the late 19th century . During a 10 @-@ year first @-@ class cricket career , he also represented Gloucestershire and the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) . 
 Most commonly employed as a right @-@ handed opening batsman , Sainsbury was one of Somerset 's most talented batsman during their formative years . His slow underarm bowling was effective in second @-@ class cricket , but in an era when overarm bowling was becoming the standard , he was used sparingly in the first @-@ class game . During his time at Somerset , the county gained first @-@ class status . After being led for three seasons by Sainsbury 's Lansdown team @-@ mate Stephen Newton , Sainsbury was given the Somerset captaincy for the 1885 season . A combination of poor results and not being able to raise a full eleven during that season led to the county 's removal from the first @-@ class game , although Sainsbury remained as captain until 1888 . By the time Somerset had improved sufficiently to return to first @-@ class cricket in 1891 , Sainsbury had moved to neighbouring county Gloucestershire , where he saw out his county cricket career . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Edward Sainsbury was born on 5 July 1851 in Bath , Somerset , the youngest son of John Popham Sainsbury . He attended Sherborne School , an independent school in north @-@ west Dorset . Playing for the school 's cricket eleven he acquired a reputation for his slow underarm bowling , which could deceive even the most wary opponent into conceding his wicket . He was considered an even better batsman , and often opened the innings for the school . 
 = = Club and second @-@ class county cricket = = 
 Sainsbury played alongside his older brother , Francis , for Lansdown Cricket Club from at least 1865 . His first recorded appearance for a representative county side was in August 1877 , when he played for Somerset , against their Dorset neighbours . He opened the batting for the Somerset team alongside Hamilton Ross . Both had been scoring plenty of runs for Lansdown in club cricket , and Sainsbury made 32 , a respectable score in the match , which Somerset won by an innings . Only Edward Lloyd scored more , posting an unbeaten 110 , one of the earliest centuries scored for a Somerset county side . Sainsbury also opened the bowling during the match , but he claimed only one wicket over the two innings and bowled just 13 of the 104 overs . A few days later he appeared again for the county side , against Clifton , who had the Australian Test cricketer , Billy Midwinter , in their team . Sainsbury scored 96 not out , including a " resolute " partnership with Stephen Newton , before rain forced the game to be drawn . Subsequently , he scored 7 and 81 against the Wiltshire Wanderers , and took ten wickets in the match , including six in the first innings . In two further appearances for Somerset in 1877 , Sainsbury did not surpass the score he reached against Dorset but claimed two further wickets , both against the Gentlemen of Wiltshire . Sainsbury finished the season top of Somerset 's batting averages , having scored 230 runs at an average of 46 @.@ 00 . 
 Sainsbury added himself to the list of early Somerset centurions during 1878 , hitting 105 while batting at number 6 against Hertfordshire . In doing so , he batted for over four hours , and shared an eighth wicket partnership of 114 with Francis Reed , out of a Somerset total of 249 . His bowling was also on form during the match , and after collecting two wickets in the first innings , he claimed five in the second . The Somerset side during the late 1870s reflected the strength of the Lansdown club : of the eleven players that represented Somerset in their match against the Marylebone Cricket Club in early August 1878 , five of them also represented Lansdown when the London club travelled down to Bath . In between these two matches against the MCC , Sainsbury scored a half @-@ century for Somerset during their match against Devon . Toward the end of August , Sainsbury 's bowling once again came to the fore , as he claimed five wickets in the first innings against Worcestershire to help defend Somerset 's lead and propel them to an innings victory . He once again led the Somerset batting averages , scoring 211 runs at an average of 35 @.@ 16 , while his 13 wickets were the second most in the team , at an average of 9 @.@ 69 . 
 Sainsbury batting scores dipped in county cricket during 1879 ; in nine appearances for Somerset during the year , his highest score was 39 . He performed better with the ball , twice taking four wickets during an innings , against both Bedfordshire and the MCC . The following county season began more positively for Sainsbury , as he collected nine wickets in the match against Sussex at Lansdown 's ground in Bath , claiming six wickets for 54 runs in the second innings of the game . He claimed another eight wickets when Somerset travelled to Leicestershire , during which Sainsbury and Arnold Fothergill took five wickets each in Leicestershire 's first innings , restricting the home side to 51 runs . Somerset won the low @-@ scoring contest by 85 runs , Sainsbury having scored a valuable 28 during his side 's first innings . Somerset 's visit to Sussex saw Sainsbury continue his success against the county , this time with the bat rather than the ball . Sussex built on their 63 run first innings lead with a second innings total of 183 , leaving Somerset the task of scoring 247 runs to win the match . Sainsbury scored his second century for Somerset , remaining 101 not out when Somerset reached the winning total . He was assisted by a half @-@ century from Stephen Newton , and scores in the twenties by Bill Fowler and Frederick Smith . Later that month , his batting was once again instrumental in setting up a Somerset victory , when he top @-@ scored with 87 as Somerset beat the MCC by an innings . 
 During the 1881 season , Sainsbury was joined at Somerset by his older brother Francis , who appeared four times for the county . Sainsbury performed consistently with the bat during the season , regularly scoring between 20 and 40 runs in an innings . His highest score was made against Gloucestershire , when he reached his only half @-@ century of the season , scoring 56 while batting at number seven . Sainsbury bowled less frequently during 1881 , and rarely opened the bowling for Somerset . His best bowling performance of the season for his county came against Hampshire , when – having not bowled in the first innings – he claimed four wickets as Hampshire followed on . On this occasion he was the fifth bowler used by Somerset , but he bowled the highest number of overs . 
 = = First @-@ class cricket = = 
 = = = Somerset 's leading batsman = = = 
 Towards the end of the 1870s , journalists had suggested that Somerset chose their players " upon breeding rather than skill " . The best players in the county , many of whom were not wealthy men , were unable to afford to play for Somerset . In turn , the cricket club could not afford to pay professionals to play for them , and were regarded as an occasional amateur outfit by many , rather than a side that could truly represent the strength of cricket within the county . The arrival of two professional players , and the acquisition of a permanent home ground in Taunton helped strengthen the club so that in 1882 they were admitted as a first @-@ class county . Bill Roe , at the time a schoolboy , rated Sainsbury as " by far the best batsman in the side " during their pre @-@ first @-@ class years . On 8 June 1882 , Somerset played their first match to be universally considered first @-@ class , against Lancashire . After losing the toss and fielding for over 150 overs as Lancashire scored 237 , Somerset responded with a first innings total of 29 – their second lowest total ever in first @-@ class cricket . Sainsbury and his fellow opening batsman , Fowler , top @-@ scored for Somerset with 9 runs each , and both were once again the highest scorers in the second innings , when Fowler scored 18 and Sainsbury 17 runs out of a total of 51 . Somerset were beaten by an innings and 157 runs , and batted for less than 70 overs . The county suffered further heavy defeats in their next two matches , losing to Gloucestershire and Hampshire , with no Somerset batsman reaching a half @-@ century in either match . Sainsbury reached his first half @-@ century in first @-@ class cricket when Somerset hosted Hampshire at the County Ground – team mates Robert Ramsay and Stephen Newton also passed 50 for the county in this match , which helped Somerset to their maiden first @-@ class victory . Sainsbury claimed a wicket in each innings of the match , during which he bowled just eight overs : in the first innings he bowled one over , conceding one run and claiming one wicket . In first @-@ class matches in 1882 , Sainsbury scored 255 runs at an average of 17 @.@ 00 , exceeding 50 on only one occasion . He bowled infrequently , claiming four wickets at an average in excess of 40 . 
 Sainsbury reached a half @-@ century on his first appearance for Somerset in first @-@ class cricket in 1883 , scoring 51 runs against the MCC . He did not reach 50 in his next three appearances for the county , but against Gloucestershire he top @-@ scored for his side in their first innings with 59 , and then when Somerset were forced to follow on , he scored his only century in first @-@ class cricket , amassing 116 runs before he became one of W. G. Grace 's eleven victims in the match . Sainsbury played in seven matches during 1883 , and achieved his highest batting average in a season , his century and two fifties boosting him to 27 @.@ 92 . Although he played another 31 first @-@ class matches during his career , he did not score more than 40 runs in an innings after 1883 . He also recorded his best bowling average in 1883 , claiming his nine first @-@ class wickets at 18 @.@ 55 . In early June 1884 , Sainsbury played for a side representing the South of England , scoring 3 and 29 during a 66 @-@ run victory for the South . Playing for Lansdown against the touring Gentlemen of Philadelphia the following month , he scored the only century of the match , reaching 108 , and sharing a first wicket partnership of 149 with E. M. Grace . He batted poorly for Somerset during 1884 , failing to reach double figures in most of his innings , and hitting a top score of 30 for the county . His season average was dramatically lower than the previous season , dropping below 10 . 
 = = = Troubled captaincy = = = 
 Following the departure of Somerset captain Stephen Newton , who played all his first @-@ class cricket in London from the 1885 season onwards , Sainsbury was given the club captaincy . Somerset 's first county match of the season took place in mid @-@ July , almost two months after four of the counties had contested matches . The match , played against Hampshire , showed little sign of the troubles that were to come . Sainsbury scored 0 and 13 opening the batting for his side , but the bowling of Edward Bastard , who claimed eight wickets in the first innings and three in the second , helped Somerset to a five @-@ wicket victory . The county 's next match , played two weeks later against Gloucestershire , was their heaviest defeat when losing by an innings to that point . Gloucestershire won the toss and elected to bat , totalling 448 in 190 overs ; Somerset bowlers James Parfitt and Charles Winter both conceding over 100 runs . In reply , five of the Somerset batsman were out for ducks ; Sainsbury , Parfitt and Albert Clapp were the only ones to reach double figures . Sainsbury top @-@ scored with 40 runs , but a team total of 100 meant that Gloucestershire forced his side to follow @-@ on . The second innings progressed even more poorly for Somerset . Sainsbury was one of eight batsmen who failed to reach double figures , and the team was dismissed for 80 runs , resulting in an innings and 268 run loss . 
 Matches were played more frequently in August , and Sainsbury and his Somerset team had just four days to recover from their defeat before travelling to The Oval to face Surrey . Sainsbury once again lost the toss and was forced to field . Surrey batted for 222 @.@ 1 overs as they accumulated 635 runs . Opening bowlers Parfitt and Winter once again conceded a century of runs apiece , and four of Somerset 's other bowlers conceded over 50 runs each . In total , Sainsbury tried seven different bowlers during the innings to try to get wickets , including Herbie Hewett , who completed his career of 106 matches with just two first @-@ class wickets . Sainsbury himself was the most successful of the bowlers , taking four wickets for 74 runs , his best first @-@ class bowling performance . In reply , Somerset were bowled out for 83 runs , with Clapp recorded as " absent hurt " . Following on , Somerset mustered a more respectable total of 251 , aided primarily by a century from Octavius Radcliffe and 85 from Hewett . Sainsbury himself added 21 to the score in the second innings after being dismissed for one in the first . The defeat was heavier still than the one suffered a week earlier ; Surrey won by an innings and 301 runs . 
 Morale was low at Somerset , and the county could not raise a full team to face Hampshire at Southampton a week later . They travelled with nine players , among their number Farrant Reed , who played eight first @-@ class matches in his life , Ernest Murdock , who played five , Egerton Hall , three , and Edward Spurway , two . Somerset scored 117 runs in their first innings , of which Sainsbury contributed nine . The bowling of Bastard , who took eight for 59 , helped to restrict Hampshire to 162 . Despite their low numbers , Somerset reached 166 in their second innings , Sainsbury scoring ten from number five in the batting order . With Bastard unable to replicate his first innings performance , Hampshire reached the winning total of 123 from 60 @.@ 3 overs . Somerset played Surrey and Gloucestershire in their final two matches of the season and lost both heavily , although they did succeed in avoiding any further record defeats ; Surrey won by an innings and five runs , and Gloucestershire by nine wickets . Sainsbury 's highest score in his four innings was 14 . In the six matches that he played that season , all for Somerset , Sainsbury scored 119 runs at an average of 9 @.@ 91 , a marginal improvement on his previous season . 
 = = Return to second @-@ class cricket = = 
 Somerset were stripped of their first @-@ class status for three reasons : they had not organised and played enough first @-@ class fixtures during the season , their performances were not what was expected from a first @-@ class county , and they had not succeeded in fielding a full side of eleven players in all their matches . An emergency meeting was held in Taunton , during which a new club secretary was appointed , rules were altered , and wealthy benefactors were sought . Despite these widespread changes , Sainsbury retained the club captaincy . In Somerset 's first match of 1886 , Sainsbury hit his highest score for the county in almost three years , scoring 90 out of a Somerset total of 241 . The bowling of Arnold Fothergill helped to restrict their opponents , Warwickshire , in the second innings ; but faced with requiring 150 in their second innings for victory , Somerset were bowled out for 58 . Throughout 1886 , Sainsbury 's batting continued to be more fruitful than his efforts in the previous two years of first @-@ class cricket , and he regularly made scores in the twenties and thirties . He hit 94 from the middle order against the MCC in mid @-@ August , his highest score of the season . Toward the end of the 1886 season the arrival of Sammy Woods and George Nichols vastly improved the quality of the bowling for the county , but 1887 was nevertheless marked by a slow start . A victory over Essex , in which Sainsbury scored 71 , was bracketed by heavy losses to Warwickshire and Gloucestershire . Against Hampshire , Sainsbury reached his highest total for Somerset , scoring 164 out of a total of 315 , to help his side on their way to a six @-@ wicket victory . A big win over Warwickshire followed , and the county was said to be " a ship heading out for an ocean of prosperity " . 
 Sainsbury 's scores dipped again for Somerset in 1888 ; his highest total for the county was an unbeaten 42 against the MCC . In contrast , in a match played for the MCC , Sainsbury struck his highest total for the side , scoring 180 runs against Wiltshire at Lord 's . Somerset were rated as the best of the second @-@ class counties in both 1887 and 1888 , but at the club 's annual general meeting , a long discussion took place regarding the captaincy of the club . Sainsbury was unable to be present for the meeting , but had sent a letter advising that if he was removed as captain , he did not feel he could play for the county any more . His letter was not well received at the meeting , and it was decided to replace him as captain with another player who lived closer to Taunton , and was able to play more of the county matches , as Sainsbury had missed a number during 1888 . Roe was selected as his replacement , with Hewett as vice @-@ captain . A vote of thanks was given to Sainsbury for his service to the county club . 
 = = Move to Gloucestershire = = 
 Over the following two seasons , 1889 and 1890 , Sainsbury played club cricket for Lansdown , but no county cricket , as he served his residential qualification for Gloucestershire . At Gloucestershire 's annual meeting in April 1891 , W. G. Grace welcomed Sainsbury to the club , and there was some mirth at the expense of Somerset regarding his move . His first appearance for his new county was in match in early May between " Club and Ground " sides from Gloucestershire and Glamorgan ; his first @-@ class debut for the county was against Kent later that month , when he scored 12 runs during a rain @-@ affected match . He was not the only former Somerset player to appear for Gloucestershire in the match – his fellow opening partner at Somerset , Octavius Radcliffe , had moved across the county border in 1886 . Sainsbury played 13 times for Gloucestershire that season , with his highest score being 36 , made against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane , Sheffield . He scored 259 runs at an average of 13 @.@ 63 , and did not bowl . An appearance for Lansdown that summer , against the Royal Agricultural College , Cirencester , saw him score 228 runs in a drawn match . The following year was his last in first @-@ class cricket , during which he made five appearances , all for Gloucestershire , scoring 100 runs , at an average of 10 @.@ 00 . He continued to play for Lansdown , who he captained in 1893 , scoring over 1 @,@ 000 runs that season , Clifton , and the MCC for a number of years . 
 = = Captaincy = = 
 During Sainsbury 's first year as Somerset captain , the county suffered two of its heaviest defeats in first @-@ class cricket at the hands of Gloucestershire and Surrey , and was stripped of its first @-@ class status . But it was the club secretary who was replaced at the end of that season , and Sainsbury remained in position as club captain , perhaps indicating that the club felt it was a lack of resources , rather than Sainsbury 's captaincy , that was to blame for the poor performances . In From Sammy to Jimmy : An Official History of Somerset County Cricket Club , Peter Roebuck suggests that Sainsbury was key in the improvements made by the county in 1888 , but fellow cricket historian David Foot appears to portray a more negative image in his book Sunshine , Sixes and Cider , suggesting that during Sainsbury 's time as captain he may have included players in the team " on the strength of [ their ] social charm and ability to drink into the early hours " . 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 Sainsbury married Mary Stevens <unk> on 28 August 1883 at Christ Church , Wanstead , Essex . He established an eponymous oil cake company in Bristol . He died on 28 October 1930 , aged 79 in Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare , Somerset , and his funeral was held at St Paul 's Church in Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare . He was survived by at least two sons and two daughters . One of those sons , E. A. Sainsbury , played cricket for Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare and the Gloucestershire Colts .

 = University of the Philippines Los Baños College of Forestry and Natural Resources = 
 The University of the Philippines Los Baños College of Forestry and Natural Resources ( also referred to as CFNR ) is one of the 11 degree @-@ granting units of the University of the Philippines Los Baños ( UPLB ) . It started as the Forest School under the UP College of Agriculture in 1910 , making it the oldest forestry school in the Philippines . It is one of the five founding units of UPLB upon its establishment in 1972 . 
 The college has been identified as a " Center of Excellence " in forestry by the Philippine Commission on Higher Education since January 2000 . CFNR offers one undergraduate degree program ( Bachelor of Science in Forestry ) along with four other graduate degree programs and one two @-@ year certificate program . Two of its professors , including its current dean , are members of the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change , the 2007 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize . 
 = = History = = 
 CFNR traces its roots to the Forest School founded in April 14 , 1910 , through an Act 1989 by the Insular Government of the Philippines and efforts by Secretary of the Interior , Dean Conant Worcester . It was originally established as a department in the newly established of the College of Agriculture , and all of its early faculty were from the Bureau of Forestry . The Forest School became independent of the College of Agriculture in February 1916 through Act 2578 . Since then directors of the bureau had acted as ex officio deans of the school . The Forest School changed its name to School of Forestry in 1924 by effect of Act 3095 . 
 Arthur F. Fischer , the School of Forestry 's first dean , retired as director of the Bureau of Forestry in February 1936 . He was replaced by Florencio Tamesis who became the School of Forestry 's second dean , as well as its first Filipino dean . 
 The Second World War devastated the campus . All the School of Forestry buildings , including student and faculty houses , were destroyed . Large parts of the Makiling Forest Reserve , which is administered by the school were likewise damaged . Only four faculty including Tamesis and silviculture professor Teodoro C. <unk> , along with five students returned upon the resumption of classes . Classes were held under trees until its buildings could be reconstructed through the help of war reparation funds worth ₱ 59 @,@ 300 ( US $ 1 @,@ 380 ) . 
 The School of Forestry became the College of Forestry on June 14 , 1949 , by effect of RA 352 , with the College of Forestry finally separated from the Bureau of Forestry in 1957 , effectively putting it under direct administration of the University of the Philippines . 
 In 1954 the College of Forestry signed an agreement with Cornell University for providing academic and financial assistance . The College of Forestry received visiting professors from Cornell and grants that were used for construction and forestry research , while faculty and students were awarded scholarships for pursuing master 's degrees at US universities . 
 Domingo M. Lantican became the dean of the College of Forestry in May 1966 . Lantican implemented a 5 @-@ year campus development program which included construction of new buildings and designating areas for dormitories and staff housing . 
 The College of Forestry was reorganized to become the College of Forestry and Natural Resources on June 25 , 1998 . Since 2004 the event has been celebrated in concurrence with the Philippine Arbor Day , a nationwide event marked by extensive tree planting . 
 = = Campus = = 
 The campus of the College of Forestry and Natural Resources , referred to as the " upper campus " , is situated on the northeastern slope of Mount Makiling . The campus contains academic buildings , dormitories , hosted institutions ( such as the ASEAN Center for Biodiversity ) , and the 4 @,@ 347 @-@ hectare Makiling Forest Reserve ( MFR ) , which serves as an outdoor laboratory for forestry students and is believed to contain more tree species than the continental United States . 
 Aside from being the location of the college , the MFR is also the site of the College of Public Affairs , National Arts Center , Philippine High School for the Arts , the venue of the National Jamboree of the Boy Scouts of the Philippines ( BSP ) , the Center for Philippine Raptors and the Bureau of Plant Industry @-@ Makiling Botanic Gardens , one of the oldest parts of the campus . The gardens occupy the site where the tents were used as classrooms during the first four months of the university . 
 The MFR serves as an outdoor laboratory to students , primarily of the College of Forestry and Natural Resources . ₱ 5 million ( US $ 156 @,@ 000 ) was designated for its conservation and development in 2011 . The MFR was created in 1910 under the Bureau of Forestry . Jurisdiction over the MFR was transferred to the UP in 1960 . <unk> acquired complete jurisdiction of the MFR , however , in 1987 as part of the Philippines ' energy development program under President Corazon Aquino . The MFR was returned to UPLB three years later by effect of RA 6967 . In 2008 representative Del De Guzman of the 2nd district of Makati filed HB 1143 which , if passed into law , would have transferred jurisdiction of the MFR to the Boy Scouts of the Philippines . The bill was strongly opposed by the UPLB , citing possible mismanagement and deforestation of the site if placed under the BSP among others . 
 = = Organization and administration = = 
 The College of Forestry and Natural Resources is managed by a dean , currently Juan M. <unk> , who is appointed by the UP Board of Regents , and assisted by an associate dean . Prior to the college 's separation from the Bureau of Forestry in 1957 , the deans of the College of Forestry and its predecessors were not appointed by the board but were the directors of the Bureau of Forestry acting as ex officio heads of the college . Due to the distance of the Bureau of Forestry in Manila from the Forest School in Los Baños ( about 64 kilometers ) , directors of the bureau appointed foresters @-@ in @-@ charge to manage the school , a practice which continued until 1957 . 
 The College of Forestry and Natural Resources is a founding member of the Asia Pacific of Forestry Research Institutions , and the CFNR Institute of Agroforestry is a member of the Philippine Agroforestry Education and Research Network . 
 = = Academics = = 
 CFNR offers one undergraduate degree program ( Bachelor of Science in Forestry ) , four graduate degree programs and one certificate program . It started offering master 's and doctor 's degrees in 1966 and 1973 , respectively . The college produces about 100 graduates every year and has been identified as a " Center of Excellence " in forestry by the Philippine Commission on Higher Education since January 2000 . 
 Admission to the BS Forestry program is done through the University of the Philippines College Admission Test , while a Certificate in Forestry applicants are screened by a test administered by CFNR . Admission to graduate programs are managed by the Graduate School . Of its 394 students in 2008 , 61 and 295 were enrolled in its Certificate in Forestry and BS Forestry programs , respectively , while the rest are in its graduate degree programs . As of 2009 it had 393 students enrolled in all of its programs . 38 of its faculty hold PhDs . 
 While all of its 20 students when the Forest School opened were male , more than 60 % of the students of the college were female as of 2003 . Women first enrolled in the college in 1951 . Other forestry schools in the Philippines have also experienced a similar increase in female enrollment . 
 The graduates of the college has maintained substantially good performance in the forestry license exams conducted by the Professional Regulation Commission . For instance , the mean passing rates of its graduates in the exams for the years 2008 – 2010 is 92 @.@ 49 % . This is almost double of the mean national passing rate for the same period . Furthermore , six of its graduates belonged to the top ten best performing students in the 2010 exam , while four belonged to the top ten in both 2008 and 2009 exams . ( see table )

 The CFNR Library holds about 30 @,@ 000 publications which mostly focus on forestry and related disciplines . The library has a floor area of 974 @.@ 64 sq. m , and is open 40 hours a week . 
 The Museum of Natural History of the University of the Philippines Los Baños , established in 1976 , is located in the campus . It holds over 200 @,@ 000 biological specimens ; including half of the samplings from the Philippine Water Bug Inventory Project . More than half of the museum 's specimens are in its entomological collection . While most of the museum 's collections are in its main building , some are housed in other UPLB units .

 In 2002 the college had 94 researchers working in its eight research units . This includes the Makiling Center for Mountain Ecosystems , believed to be the first institution in the Philippines devoted to the study of mountain ecology . It also manages the Makiling Forest Reserve and has launched programs promoting its conservation . 
 The Forest Products Research and Development Institute , founded as the Forest Products Laboratory under the Bureau of Forestry in 1954 , is hosted in the campus . Managed by the Department of Science and Technology of the government of the Philippines , it is engaged in paper science and bioenergy research , among others . It has also generated technologies such as those for biomass energy generation and construction . Its facilities , believed to be the " largest and best equipped in the eastern hemisphere " by the time of its construction , were patterned after the University of Wisconsin 's Forest Products Laboratory . It was built using US grants worth US $ 239 @,@ 552 and funding from the Philippine government worth ₱ 518 @,@ 000 ( US $ 12 @,@ 000 ) .

 The 2008 NCAA Division I Men 's Lacrosse Tournament was held from May 10 through May 26 , 2008 . This was the 38th annual Division I NCAA Men 's Lacrosse Championship tournament . Sixteen NCAA Division I college men 's lacrosse teams met after having played their way through a regular season , and for some , a conference tournament . 
 The first round of the single @-@ elimination tournament was played on May 10 and May 11 at the home field of the top @-@ seeded team . The quarterfinals were held on May 17 and May 18 on two separate neutral fields : the Navy @-@ Marine Corps Memorial Stadium in Annapolis , Maryland , and <unk> Field in Ithaca , New York . The tournament culminated with the semifinals and finals held on Memorial Day weekend at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough , Massachusetts . The championship weekend , which included the Division II and Division III championships , was hosted by Harvard University and the Eastern College Athletic Conference . The championship was won by Syracuse University , beating Johns Hopkins University 13 – 10 , in front of a title game record crowd of 48 @,@ 970 fans .

 The Division I NCAA Men ’ s Lacrosse Committee was responsible for selecting the teams that competed in the championship tournament . The qualifying teams , along with the seeding for each team in the tournament , were announced on Sunday , May 4 , 2008 . Seven conferences received automatic bids to the tournament for its top team . The remaining nine teams were selected as " at large " bids by the committee . 
 Five conferences held a conference tournament championship to award the conferences ' bid . Canisius earned an automatic bid by winning the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference ( MAAC ) championship . This marks the first time that Canisius College has gained entry to the National Championship tournament . Colgate earned an automatic bid by winning its first @-@ ever Patriot League championship . Hofstra earned an automatic bid by winning Colonial Athletic Association ( CAA ) championship , Notre Dame earned an automatic bid by winning Great Western Lacrosse League ( GWLL ) championship , and UMBC earned an automatic bid by winning America East Conference championship . 
 Two conferences award their bids based on regular season conference records . Loyola earned an automatic bid by winning the Eastern College Athletic Conference ( ECAC ) championship with a 6 – 1 conference record . The Ivy League 's automatic bid was awarded to Cornell . Cornell and Brown had identical conference records , but due to a victory by Cornell in head to head competition earlier in the season the tiebreaker was given to Cornell . 
 The Atlantic Coast Conference ( ACC ) conference tournament champion was Duke . However , the ACC does not receive an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament because a conference must have at least six members competing ( for 2 years ) in order to be awarded an automatic bid . 
 The following teams were awarded at @-@ large bids by the NCAA Selection Committee : Duke ( ACC ) , Virginia ( ACC ) , Syracuse ( Independent ) , North Carolina ( ACC ) , Johns Hopkins ( Independent ) , Maryland ( ACC ) , Denver ( GWLL ) , Navy ( Patriot ) , and Ohio State ( GWLL ) .

The game remained in Virginia 's favor through the third quarter , prior to the Orange fourth quarter comeback . 
 Syracuse 's Mike Leveille scored five goals , including a goal with 3 : 00 remaining in the game to send the game into overtime , and the eventual game @-@ winner in the second overtime period to propel the Orange into the Championship game . Syracuse 's come @-@ from @-@ behind victory included scoring six of the final eight goals of the contest . 
 Syracuse 's Junior midfielder Matt Abbott , known more for his groundball and clearing game , tallied three goals in the second half for his first career hat trick to spark to second half rally .

 = Smyth Report = 
 The Smyth Report is the common name of an administrative history written by physicist Henry DeWolf Smyth about the Manhattan Project , the Allied effort to develop atomic bombs during World War II . The full title of the report is A General Account of the Development of Methods of Using Atomic Energy for Military Purposes . It was released to the public on August 12 , 1945 , just days after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9 . 
 Smyth was commissioned to write the report by Major General Leslie R. Groves , Jr . , the director of the Manhattan Project . The Smyth Report was the first official account of the development of the atomic bombs and the basic physical processes behind them . It also served as an indication as to what information was declassified ; anything in the Smyth Report could be discussed openly . For this reason , the Smyth Report focused heavily on information , such as basic nuclear physics , which was either already widely known in the scientific community or easily <unk> by a competent scientist , and omitted details about chemistry , metallurgy , and ordnance . This would ultimately give a false impression that the Manhattan Project was all about physics . 
 The Smyth Report sold almost 127 @,@ 000 copies in its first eight printings , and was on The New York Times best @-@ seller list from mid @-@ October 1945 until late January 1946 . It has been translated into over 40 languages . 
 = = Background = = 
 Henry D. Smyth was a professor of physics and chairman of the physics department of Princeton University from 1935 to 1949 . During World War II , he was involved in the Manhattan Project from early 1941 , initially as a member of the National Defense Research Committee ’ s S @-@ 1 Uranium Committee , and later as an associate director of the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago . In late 1943 , the President of Princeton University , Harold W. Dodds , began insisting that Smyth work part @-@ time at Princeton , where there was a shortage of physicists because so many of them were engaged in war work . Princeton had commitments to teach army and navy personnel , and he needed physicists like Smyth to meet those commitments . Smyth therefore became a consultant at Chicago , where he was in charge of designing a nuclear reactor that used heavy water as a neutron moderator , and commuted from Princeton , working in Chicago on alternate weeks . 
 In early 1944 , Smyth raised the possibility of producing an unclassified report for the general public on the achievements of the Manhattan Project . The director of the Metallurgical Laboratory , Arthur Compton , supported the idea . He arranged a meeting with James B. Conant , the President of Harvard University and one of the senior administrators of the Manhattan Project , who had similar thoughts . Conant took up the matter with the Manhattan Project 's director , Major General Leslie R. Groves , Jr .. In April , Smyth received a formal letter from Groves asking him to write such a report . Both the report and the choice of Smyth as its author were approved by the Manhattan Project ’ s governing body , the Military Policy Committee , in May 1944 . 
 The Report was to serve two functions . First , it was to be the public and official U.S. government account of the development of the atomic bombs , outlining the development of the then @-@ secret laboratories and production sites at Los Alamos , New Mexico , Oak Ridge , Tennessee , and Hanford , Washington , and the basic physical processes responsible for the functioning of nuclear weapons , in particular nuclear fission and the nuclear chain reaction . Second , it served as a reference for other scientists as to what information was declassified — anything said in the Smyth Report could be said freely in open literature . For this reason , the Smyth Report focused heavily on information already available in declassified literature , such as much of the basic nuclear physics used in weapons , which was either already widely known in the scientific community or could have been easily deduced by a competent scientist . 
 Smyth stated the purpose of the Smyth Report in the Preface : 
 The ultimate responsibility for our nation 's policy rests on its citizens and they can discharge such responsibilities wisely only if they are informed . The average citizen cannot be expected to understand clearly how an atomic bomb is constructed or how it works but there is in this country a substantial group of engineers and scientists who can understand such things and who can explain the potentialities of atomic bombs to their fellow citizens . The present report is written for this professional group and is a matter @-@ of @-@ fact , general account of work in the USA since 1939 aimed at the production of such bombs . It is neither a documented official history nor a technical treatise for experts . Secrecy requirements have affected both the detailed content and general emphasis so that many interesting developments have been omitted . 
 This contrasted somewhat with what Groves wrote in the foreword : 
 All pertinent scientific information which can be released to the public at this time without violating the needs of national security is contained in this volume . No requests for additional information should be made to private persons or organizations associated directly or indirectly with the project . Persons disclosing or securing additional information by any means whatsoever without authorization are subject to severe penalties under the Espionage Act . 
 = = Writing = = 
 Smyth passed security clearances necessary to visit project sites , access documents and to discuss the work with the research personnel . Groves approved Smyth 's request to hire another Princeton physicist , Lincoln G. Smith , as a research assistant . A letter to the Manhattan Project 's senior managers , Kenneth Nichols , Robert Oppenheimer , Ernest Lawrence , Harold Urey , and Franklin Matthias , explained : 
 The purpose is to give clearly and promptly recognition to those who have worked so long and necessarily so anonymously ... To accomplish his purpose , Dr. Smyth must have rather complete information concerning your phase of the project including access to necessary documents ... [ and ] information and advice from you and your principal assistants . 
 Since Smyth still had his commitments at Princeton and Chicago , he could only work on the report part @-@ time . He wrote the report in his office in Princeton 's Palmer Laboratory . Bars were installed on the windows of Smyth 's office and the one adjacent to it . The hallway door to his office was locked and blocked by a large safe so that the only access was through the adjacent office , where there was an armed guard . The guards worked in eight @-@ hour shifts , and one was present around the clock . When Smyth sent papers to Groves in Washington , D.C. , they went by military courier . 
 Smyth sent an outline and rough draft of the report to Groves for approval in August 1944 , followed in February 1945 by drafts of the first twelve chapters , leaving only the final chapter to be completed . Groves and Conant reviewed the drafts , and made several criticisms . They felt that it was too technical for general readers , did not mention the names of enough participants , and dwelt too much on the activities at the Los Alamos Laboratory . Groves was particularly anxious that deserving people be mentioned , as he felt that this would lessen the danger of security breaches . After Smyth made a series of changes in response to this , Groves sent the manuscript to his scientific adviser , Richard Tolman . Tolman was assisted by two physicists who were working in his office at the National Defense Research Committee as technical aides , Paul C. Fine from the University of Texas , and William <unk> from Harvard University . They had the dual task of editing and censoring the manuscript . 
 Smyth and Tolman accepted a set of criteria , agreeing that information could be released under the conditions : 
 I. ( A ) That it is important to a reasonable understanding of what had been done on the project as a whole or ( B ) That it is of true scientific interest and likely to be truly helpful to scientific workers in this country and 
 II . ( A ) That it is already generally known by competent scientists or ( B ) that it can be deduced or guessed by competent scientists from what is already known , combined with the knowledge that the project was in the overall successful or 
 III . ( A ) That it has no real bearing on the production of atomic bombs or ( B ) That it could be discovered by a small group ( 15 of whom not over 5 would be senior men ) of competent scientists working in a well @-@ equipped college lab in a year 's time or less . 
 Writing to Oppenheimer in April 1945 , Smyth noted that 
 All discussion of ordnance work is also to be removed . There is no objection to including the general statement of the ordnance problem and all the other parts of the problem , but the approaches to solution that have been made will be omitted . On the other hand , the feeling is that there is no objection to including the nuclear physics . The General believes that the metallurgical work and a considerable amount of the chemistry work should be excluded on the ground that it would be extremely difficult for the average scientist to carry out any of this work without supplies and material which would not be available to him . I am not entirely clear how this criterion should be applied , but it probably means the elimination of the metallurgical work on plutonium and at least of some of the chemistry . 
 Tolman and his assistants finished making their changes in July 1945 , and Groves had copies sent out by courier to selected personnel . Each submitted a written report , which was returned with the courier and the manuscript . These were busy people who sometimes only had a few days or even hours to look at the manuscript . Many , but not all , merely signed a statement saying that they were happy with it . Nichols , the commander of the Manhattan District , sent back a detailed review . He had concerns about the amount of credit being given to different people and organizations , and recommended that " full credit be given to H. D. Smyth for preparing it and that the statement be made that the Army has no responsibility for the report except for asking him to do it . " Smyth was given credit , but no such statement was issued . To prepare the final draft for the printer , Groves brought typists with the required security clearances to Washington , D.C. , from the Manhattan District 's headquarters in Oak Ridge . 
 Because the Manhattan Project was an Allied endeavor , Groves had to obtain permission from the British and American governments to publish the Smyth Report . A meeting was held on August 2 , 1945 in the office of the Secretary of War , Henry Stimson . Accompanying Stimson were his two assistants , Harvey Bundy and George L. Harrison , and his military aide , Colonel William H. Kyle . Groves , Conant , and Tolman represented the Manhattan Project . James Chadwick , the head of the British scientific mission to the Manhattan Project , and Roger Makins from the British Embassy represented Britain . The meeting went on for two hours , as Groves and Conant sought to reassure Stimson that the report would not give vital secrets away to the Soviet Union . 
 For his part , Chadwick , who had not yet read the manuscript , could not fathom why the Americans wanted to publish such a document . When he did read it , he became quite alarmed . His concerns were addressed in a meeting with Groves and Conant , and he accepted their point of view . " I am now convinced , " he wrote , " that the very special circumstances arising from the nature of the project , and of its organization , demand special treatment , and a report of this kind may well be necessary to maintain security of the really essential facts of the project . " 
 = = Publication = = 
 A thousand copies of the report were printed by lithography at the Pentagon , and deposited in Groves 's office in the New War Department Building in Washington , DC , where they were kept securely locked away . Final approval was sought from the President , Harry S. Truman , in a meeting at the White House on August 9 , 1945 , three days after the bombing of Hiroshima . Stimson , Harrison , Groves , Conant , Vannevar Bush , and Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy presented their views , and Truman authorized the immediate release of the report . The War Department released the thousand copies of the report that had been kept in Groves 's office to the media for use by the radio broadcasters with an embargo time of 9 : 00 pm on August 11 , 1945 , and for the newspapers of August 12 . 
 The original title of the report , before it was published in book form , was Nuclear Bombs : A General Account of the Development of Methods of Using Nuclear Energy for Military Purposes Under the <unk> of the United States Government , 1940 – 1945 . The word " nuclear " was changed to " atomic " because while the former was favoured by physicists , it was not in common use by the general public at that time . This was the title used on the copyright certificate . The book was copyrighted to Smyth but issued with the statement that " reproduction in whole or in part is authorized and permitted " . Groves had the report copyrighted by Smyth in order to prevent someone else from copyrighting it . 
 Groves was concerned about the security implications of the title , so instead of having " Atomic Bombs " on the cover , it was left blank , and a rubber stamp was made . The intention was for this to be used on each copy before it was distributed . This was done for the copyright deposit copies , but not those given to the press or the public . The lumbering subtitle therefore became the title . A side effect of this was that it became generally known as the " Smyth Report " . Over the years , the term " nuclear " gradually gained traction , and by 1960 it had become more common than " atomic " . 
 In mid @-@ 1945 , Smyth approached Datus C. Smith , the director of Princeton University Press , about the possibility of renting his printing plant to the government during a two @-@ week summer shutdown so that Smyth could produce 5 @,@ 000 copies of a top secret report . Smith ’ s response was that he found it hard to imagine anyone needing to print 5 @,@ 000 copies of a top secret report . He found it much easier to imagine delays due to unexpected printing problems , and his workers returning from summer vacation to find themselves locked out of a plant filled with top secret material . Under the circumstances , he felt that he could not risk this . 
 After the Smyth Report was officially released , Smith immediately offered to publish it . Smyth patiently explained that anyone was free to publish it , but Princeton University Press was only willing to do so on the understanding that this would be " Smyth 's edition " . Meanwhile , Smyth approached McGraw @-@ Hill about publishing it . The editors at McGraw @-@ Hill found the manuscript dull and somewhat technical for a general audience and suggested a rewrite . Smyth balked at this , as it would have meant going through the censorship process again . James S. Thompson , the president of McGraw @-@ Hill , pointed out the U.S. Government Printing Office would be putting out an edition , probably more cheaply than he could , and there would likely be little profit in a McGraw @-@ Hill edition . Smyth then turned back to Princeton University Press . He had only one condition : that he receive no royalties . Princeton University Press agreed , but added a stipulation of its own : that Groves 's approval be secured . Smyth obtained this in a letter dated August 25 , 1945 . 
 Princeton University Press received a copy of the typescript lithograph edition with hand corrections from Smyth on August 17 , 1945 . The typographers had already started work from another copy . Maple Press of York , Pennsylvania , was lined up to do the printing . Because of wartime shortages , one of a publisher ’ s biggest worries was finding adequate supplies of paper . Smith approached Manny and Leonard <unk> from Central Paper , told them about the Smyth Report and its significance , and asked them if they could deliver 30 short tons ( 27 t ) of paper to Maple Press in twelve days . They found a carload of paper on a siding in New England and sent it to York , providing enough paper for 30 @,@ 000 copies , only half what Princeton University Press wanted . The first edition of 30 @,@ 000 copies was printing when word was received that paper had been found for another 30 @,@ 000 copies . The presses were held for three hours while the train made its way to a siding in York , where the paper was unloaded and brought to the printing plant by trucks . 
 There were minor differences between the original text and the version published by Princeton . In the Princeton publication , first and middle names were added instead of the previous use of abbreviations . In response to public concerns about radioactivity , Groves had text added to paragraph 12 @.@ 18 explaining how the height of the explosions over Hiroshima and Nagasaki reduced fallout and allowed fission products to be drawn up into the upper atmosphere . He also had a one @-@ sentence allusion to a poisoning effect of fission products in the production reactors redacted . This deletion was soon noticed by the Russian translators , and only served to highlight its importance to the Soviet atomic bomb project . 
 Later editions also incorporated changes . Four typographical errors were found , and the word " photon " in paragraph 1 @.@ 44 aroused so much correspondence from readers who mistakenly believed that it should be " proton " that it was decided to re @-@ word the paragraph . The British government became concerned that the Smyth report did not cover the British part in the project , and issued its own 40 @-@ page report , which was incorporated into the fifth printing in November 1945 as Appendix 7 . A two @-@ page report by the Canadian government was added as Appendix 8 . 
 The Smyth Report was translated into over 40 different languages . In addition to Princeton University Press , it was also published by the Government Printing Office , the Infantry Journal , and His Majesty 's Stationery Office , and was reprinted in the October 1945 issue of Reviews of Modern Physics . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The first copies were delivered to bookstores on September 10 . Many were wary of it , due to its technical nature , and feared that sales would be low . An exception was Scribner 's Bookstores , which placed large early orders . At Oak Ridge , the Manhattan Project 's major production site , 8 @,@ 000 copies were sold through the employee welfare organization . Similar arrangements were made for Los Alamos and Richland , which were located in areas where bookstores were scarce . 
 The Smyth Report was on The New York Times bestseller list from October 14 , 1945 , until January 20 , 1946 . Between 1946 and when the Smyth Report went out of print in 1973 , it went through eight printings , and Princeton University Press sold 62 @,@ 612 paperback and 64 @,@ 129 hardback copies . 
 Groves did not intend the Smyth Report to be the last word on the project . It formed an addendum to the Manhattan District History , the official history of the project . This eventually consisted of 35 volumes with 39 appendices or supplements . It was written in the immediate postwar years by the chemists , metallurgists , physicists , and administrators who had worked on the project . Since there were no security restrictions , it covered every aspect of the Manhattan Project , but was itself classified . Most of it was declassified in the 1960s and 1970s and became available to scholars , except for some technical details on the construction of the bombs . 
 In her 2008 PhD dissertation , Rebecca Schwartz argued that Smyth 's academic background and the Smyth Report 's security @-@ driven focus on physics at the expense of chemistry , metallurgy , and ordnance promoted a public perception of the Manhattan Project as primarily the achievement of physics and physicists . According to Schwartz , postwar histories and popular writing tended to follow the Smyth report in this regard , creating a lasting historiographical legacy . " Ever since " , wrote Jon Agar , " the atomic bomb has been seen as an achievement of physics . " In particular , the prominence given to Einstein 's mass – energy equivalence equation indelibly associated it with the Manhattan Project . The Smyth Report , wrote Robert P. Crease , " more than any other single document made E = mc2 an emblem of atomic energy and weaponry . " 
 Groves felt that : 
 on the whole , and considering the rather difficult conditions under which it was prepared , the Smyth Report was extraordinarily successful in its efforts to distribute credit fairly and accurately . It would have been impossible to have prepared any document for publication covering the work of the Manhattan District that every reader would have found to his liking . But the fact is that all those who had the greatest knowledge of the subject were nearly unanimous in approving its publication as it was finally written . And there can be no question that it excellently served its purpose as an essential source of accurate information , particularly for a news @-@ hungry America in the early days after Nagasaki . 
 = Italian cruiser Francesco Ferruccio = 
 Francesco Ferruccio was a Giuseppe Garibaldi @-@ class armored cruiser built for the Royal Italian Navy ( Regia Marina ) in the first decade of the 20th century . The ship made several deployments to the Eastern Mediterranean and the Levant during her career . At the beginning of the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 she bombarded Tripoli and then Beirut in early 1912 before being transferred to Libya . During World War I , Francesco Ferruccio 's activities were limited by the threat of Austro @-@ Hungarian submarines and she became a training ship in 1919 . The ship was struck from the naval register in 1930 and subsequently scrapped . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Francesco Ferruccio had an overall length of 111 @.@ 8 meters ( 366 ft 10 in ) , a beam of 18 @.@ 2 meters ( 59 ft 9 in ) and a deep draft ( ship ) of 7 @.@ 3 meters ( 23 ft 11 in ) . She displaced 7 @,@ 350 metric tons ( 7 @,@ 230 long tons ) at normal load . The ship was powered by two vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one shaft , using steam from 24 coal @-@ fired Belleville boilers . The engines produced 14 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a speed of approximately 19 – 20 knots ( 35 – 37 km / h ; 22 – 23 mph ) . She had a cruising range of 5 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 200 km ; 6 @,@ 300 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Her complement ordinarily consisted of 555 officers and enlisted men and 578 when acting as a flagship . 
 Her main armament consisted of one 254 @-@ millimeter ( 10 in ) gun in a turret forward of the superstructure and two 203 @-@ millimeter ( 8 in ) guns in a twin turret aft . Ten of the 152 @-@ millimeter ( 6 in ) guns that comprised her secondary armament were arranged in casemates amidships ; the remaining four 152 @-@ millimeter guns were mounted on the upper deck . Francesco Ferruccio also had ten 76 @-@ millimeter ( 3 in ) and six 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) guns to defend herself against torpedo boats . She was fitted with four single 450 @-@ millimeter ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . 
 The ship 's waterline armor belt had a maximum thickness of 150 millimeters ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) amidships and tapered to 80 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) towards the ends of the ship . The conning tower , casemates , and gun turrets were also protected by 150 @-@ millimeter armor . Her protective deck armor was 37 millimeters ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) thick and the 152 @-@ millimeter guns on the upper deck were protected by gun shields 50 millimeters ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick .

 Francesco Ferruccio , named after the condottiere Francesco Ferruccio , was laid down at the Naval Dockyard in Venice on 19 August 1899 and launched on 23 April 1902 , when she was named by the Duchess of Genoa . She was completed on 1 September 1905 . During the 1905 fleet maneuvers , she was assigned to the " hostile " force blockading La Maddalena , Sardinia . Together with her sister ships Giuseppe Garibaldi and Varese , the ship was in Marseilles , France on 15 – 16 September 1906 to participate in a fleet review for Armand Fallières , President of France , on the latter date . Francesco Ferruccio made a cruise to the Levant in July 1909 and was deployed to Crete from 26 June 1910 to January 1911 , returning to Taranto on 25 January . 
 When the Italo @-@ Turkish War began on 29 September 1911 , Francesco Ferruccio assigned to the 4th Division of the 2nd Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet , together with her sisters Giuseppe Garibaldi and Varese . Francesco Ferruccio and Giuseppe Garibaldi bombarded Tripoli on 3 – 4 October while Varese stood offshore to watch for any Ottoman ships . The desultory bombardment killed 12 Ottoman soldiers and severely wounded 23 more in addition to 7 dead civilians . On 13 October , the three sisters sailed to Augusta , Sicily to recoal . Francesco Ferruccio and Giuseppe Garibaldi bombarded Beirut on 24 February 1912 , sinking the elderly Ottoman ironclad <unk> and forced the torpedo boat Ankara to scuttle itself . Varese is sometimes credited with participating also in the bombardment . The bombardment killed over 140 civilians and wounded more than 200 more . The ship was then transferred to Libya and remained there for the rest of the war . During the First Balkan War , she was deployed to Albania from 18 February to 5 June 1913 and then made another deployment there from 4 January to 7 February 1914 . 
 When Italy declared war on the Central Powers in May 1915 , she was assigned to the 5th Cruiser Division , based at Brindisi . On 5 June the division bombarded rail lines near Ragusa and departed Brindisi on the evening of 17 July to do the same near Ragusa Vecchia the following morning . Shortly after beginning the bombardment at 04 : 00 , Giuseppe Garibaldi was torpedoed by the Austro @-@ Hungarian submarine U @-@ 4 . Struck by a single torpedo , the cruiser sank within minutes , although only 53 crewmen were killed . The division immediately retreated to avoid further attacks , leaving three destroyers behind to rescue survivors . The loss of Giuseppe Garibaldi and the sinking of the armored cruiser Amalfi by another submarine on 7 July severely restricted the activities of the other ships based in the Adriatic Sea . Francesco Ferruccio was briefly stationed in the Levant from 19 November to 22 December before returning to Brindisi where she escorted convoys to Albania and patrolled the Albanian coast for the rest of the war . 
 Francesco Ferruccio became a cadet training ship in 1919 and was finally converted for the role in 1924 . She was stricken on 1 April 1930 and scrapped . 
 = Cold Feet ( series 5 ) = 
 The fifth series of the British comedy drama television series Cold Feet was broadcast on the ITV network from 23 February to 16 March 2003 . This was the final series of the drama and while the number of episodes was halved compared to the previous series , the running time was increased from 46 minutes to 72 minutes per episode , necessitating a 95 @-@ minute timeslot . The plot of the series follows three couples : Adam ( James Nesbitt ) and Rachel ( Helen Baxendale ) getting to grips with bringing up baby Matthew ( born in the final episode of the previous series ) , the return of Pete ( John Thomson ) and Jo ( Kimberley Joseph ) from their honeymoon , and the subsequent breakdown of their marriage , and the divorce proceedings between Karen ( Hermione Norris ) and David ( Robert Bathurst ) . 
 The producers had originally intended to end the programme in 2001 but pressure for another run meant it came back for one last series . Critics welcomed the decision to end the series and the final episode gained the highest viewing figure in the history of the programme , with 10 @.@ 7 million people watching Rachel 's funeral . Numerous accolades were endowed on the programme ( particularly for the final episode , which rated highly in viewer polls ) including the prestigious Best Comedy Award at the British Comedy Awards .

 Mike Bullen vowed that he would not write a fifth series after the fourth ended so well in 2001 , but was persuaded to write it when executive producer Andy Harries suggested he should kill off a character . James Nesbitt was not keen to return to do another series but Bullen persuaded him to by offering to have Adam 's cancer return with fatal consequences ( the character had recovered from a testicular cancer scare in the second series ) . Despite this , Bullen was unable to make Adam 's death funny and , following a meeting with Harries , decided it should be Rachel who died . Harries scheduled a meeting with Helen Baxendale at the Groucho Club , where they discussed the development . The scenes where Adam talks to Rachel 's spirit were inspired by Truly , Madly , Deeply and Ghost . Bullen co @-@ wrote the script of episode three with Matt Greenhalgh . 
 Richard Armitage secured the role of Lee when he arrived at his audition wearing a pair of old boots , something that greatly impressed producer Spencer Campbell . In order to match the scripted description of his character , Armitage began a heavy workout regimen and took aqua @-@ aerobics lessons to better understand Lee 's profession . His first scene was a sex scene with Ramona . Despite leaving the series in 2001 , Fay Ripley was persuaded to return to the programme for one last appearance as Jenny in the final episode . To make sure the rest of the cast agreed to return , their salaries were increased to £ 75 @,@ 000 per episode , a 50 % increase on their pay for the fourth series ( though Joseph earned less ) . 
 Episodes one and two were directed by Ciaran Donnelly , episode three by Simon Delaney and episode four by Tim Sullivan . Ripley was in the late stages of pregnancy and permitted to work for only a short amount of time , so the fourth episode was filmed before the third . Ripley did not travel to Portmeirion with the rest of the cast , so a make @-@ up artist stood in as Jenny in the beach ad clifftop scenes , wearing the prosthetic stomach originally made for Ripley in the first series . A close @-@ up of Jenny standing next to Jo was filmed in front of a similar backdrop in Manchester and edited into the location footage . The producers endeavoured to film on location once per series but the high cost of the Sydney episode and the rising salaries of the cast meant the budget could not permit travel any further than Portmeirion , a village most famous as the location in The Prisoner . Rachel 's car accident was filmed on location in Moston , Greater Manchester in the early hours of 6 October 2002 . Following the completion of filming , the sets were dismantled and moved to landfill sites . 
 Robert Bathurst was displeased with the development of David and Robyn 's relationship ; he told The Times , " I had a long run @-@ in with the producers . Here was an opportunity for the character to have his first friendship and they used the stock telly drama for friendship of having a shag . I said it 's shallow and it 's sordid . So they wrote a scene with a self @-@ disgusted David saying ' It 's shallow and it 's sordid . ' " 
 Mark Russell composed an extended score for the scenes depicting Rachel 's death and its aftermath , using music software to recreate the acoustics of the Cathedral of Chartres : " We decided what we wanted was quite an elegiac piece of music that becomes more and more emotional so it doesn 't reflect the frenzy of the hospital .

 The first and second episodes each secured overnights of 8 million , with the first taking a 33 % audience share .

Final figures took it to 10 @.@ 7 million , making it the eighth most @-@ watched drama and 15th most @-@ watched terrestrial programme of 2003 . During production of the series , tabloid newspapers published stories that four funeral scenes had been filmed and a final decision on which would air would be made close to the broadcast ; The Sun reported the original plot of Adam 's fatal cancer relapse and Rachel 's death in a car accident , though also suggested Karen could die from an alcohol @-@ related accident and that Pete might suffer a heart attack during sex . The Sunday Mirror quoted Andy Harries as being " undecided " over who would die in a report published in September 2002 , though by this time production on the last episodes was well under way . 
 Critical reviews were favourable and the decision to end the series was welcomed ; Paul Hoggart of The Times called the formula of the series " less surprising " and audiences had only " residual interest in the characters " . Writing in New Statesman , Andrew Billen compared the appearance of Rachel 's ghost to that of Gary Shepherd in thirtysomething , and its inspiration The Big Chill . Billen was unsurprised when Mark told Karen he was a " child hater " and that Jo married Pete solely to stay in the country , suggesting that viewers had seen the plots coming for a long time . Reviewing for BBC News Online , Darren Waters wrote that the finale had a " thankful lack of sentimentality " , though called the scenes in Portmeirion an " unnecessary coda " . The Spectator 's Simon Hoggart believed that Baxendale 's portrayal of Rachel as a " fraught and snippy woman " was detrimental to the character , causing him to have less sympathy for her and more for Matthew . He praised the strengths and flaws of all the female characters . 
 Tesco Personal Finance recorded a 20 % increase in calls from people wanting to take out life insurance policies . A spokesman attributed the surge to people watching Rachel 's death in a car accident . 
 The series secured the Best Comedy Drama award at the 2003 British Comedy Awards and Nesbitt was voted Most Popular Comedy Performer at the National Television Awards in the same year . Other viewer polls placed Rachel 's car crash as " Best Drama Moment " at the BBC 's annual " TV Moments " ceremony in 2004 and a poll conducted by cable provider NTL in the same year placed the finale as the fourth best of all time . Adam 's speech at Rachel 's funeral came 69th in the Channel 4 poll The 100 Greatest <unk> , broadcast in February 2005 . In 2008 , Rachel 's car crash was ranked at number three in Sky One 's 50 Greatest TV Endings .

 = French battleship Saint Louis = 
 Saint Louis was the last of the three Charlemagne @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the French Navy in the mid @-@ 1890s . She spent most of her career assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron ( escadre de la Méditerranée ) and usually was chosen to serve as a flagship . The ship was involved in two accidental ramming incidents with two other French warships in her career , one of which sank a submarine . 
 When World War I began , she escorted Allied troop convoys for the first two months . Saint Louis was ordered to the Dardanelles in November 1914 to guard against a sortie into the Mediterranean by the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben . In 1915 , she was transferred to the Eastern Mediterranean where she participated in bombarding Turkish positions in Palestine and the Sinai Peninsula . The ship returned to the Dardanelles in May and provided fire support during the Gallipoli Campaign . Saint Louis was transferred to the squadron assigned to prevent any interference by the Greeks with Allied operations on the Salonica front in May 1916 , after a lengthy refit in France . The ship was placed in reserve in April 1917 and briefly became a training ship in 1919 – 20 . She was converted to serve as an accommodation hulk in 1920 and listed for disposal as scrap in 1931 . Saint Louis did not find a buyer , however , until 1933 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 Saint Louis was 117 @.@ 7 metres ( 386 ft 2 in ) long overall and had a beam of 20 @.@ 3 metres ( 66 ft 7 in ) . At deep load , she had a draught of 7 @.@ 4 metres ( 24 ft 3 in ) forward and 8 @.@ 4 metres ( 27 ft 7 in ) aft . She displaced 11 @,@ 275 metric tons ( 11 @,@ 097 long tons ) at deep load . Her crew consisted of 30 officers and 702 sailors as a private ship , or 41 officers and 744 men as a fleet flagship . 
 The ship used three 4 @-@ cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines , one engine per shaft . Rated at 14 @,@ 500 PS ( 10 @,@ 700 kW ) , they produced 14 @,@ 900 metric horsepower ( 11 @,@ 000 kW ) during the ship 's sea trials using steam generated by 20 Belleville water @-@ tube boilers . Saint Louis reached a top speed of 18 @.@ 5 knots ( 34 @.@ 3 km / h ; 21 @.@ 3 mph ) on her trials . She carried a maximum of 1 @,@ 050 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 030 long tons ) of coal which allowed her to steam for 4 @,@ 200 miles ( 3 @,@ 600 nmi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 Saint Louis carried her main armament of four 40 @-@ calibre Canon de 305 mm Modèle 1893 guns in two twin @-@ gun turrets , one each fore and aft . The ship 's secondary armament consisted of ten 45 @-@ calibre Canon de 138 mm Modèle 1893 guns , eight of which were mounted in individual casemates and the remaining pair in shielded mounts on the forecastle deck amidships . She also carried eight 45 @-@ calibre Canon de 100 mm Modèle 1893 guns in shielded mounts on the superstructure . The ship 's anti @-@ torpedo boat defences consisted of twenty 40 @-@ calibre Canon de 47 mm Modèle 1885 Hotchkiss guns , fitted in platforms on both masts , on the superstructure , and in casemates in the hull . Saint Louis mounted four 450 @-@ millimetre ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes , two on each broadside . Two of these were submerged , angled 20 ° from the ship 's axis , and the other two were above the waterline . They were provided with twelve Modèle 1892 torpedoes . As was common with ships of her generation , she was built with a plough @-@ shaped ram . 
 The Charlemagne @-@ class ships carried a total of 820 @.@ 7 tonnes ( 807 @.@ 7 long tons ) of Harvey armour . They had a complete waterline armour belt that was 3 @.@ 26 metres ( 10 ft 8 in ) high . The armour belt tapered from its maximum thickness of 400 mm ( 15 @.@ 7 in ) to a thickness of 110 mm ( 4 @.@ 3 in ) at its lower edge . The armoured deck was 55 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) thick on the flat and was reinforced with an additional 35 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) plate where it angled downwards to meet the armoured belt . The main turrets were protected by 320 mm ( 12 @.@ 6 in ) of armour and their roofs were 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick . Their barbettes were 270 mm ( 10 @.@ 6 in ) thick . The outer walls of the casemates for the 138 @.@ 6 @-@ millimetre ( 5 @.@ 46 in ) guns were 55 mm thick and they were protected by transverse bulkheads 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick . The conning tower walls were 326 mm ( 12 @.@ 8 in ) thick and its roof consisted of 50 mm armour plates . Its communications tube was protected by armour plates 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) thick . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Saint Louis , named after King Louis IX , a Catholic saint , was authorised on 30 September 1895 as one of the three Charlemagne @-@ class battleships . The ship was laid down at the Arsenal de Lorient on 25 March 1895 and launched on 2 September 1896 . She was commissioned on 15 September 1900 after completing her sea trials at the cost of 26 @,@ 981 @,@ 000 francs . Even before Saint Louis was formally commissioned , she participated in a naval review conducted by the President of France , Émile Loubet , at Cherbourg in July 1900 . 
 The ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron and arrived in Toulon on 24 September . Saint Louis became the squadron flagship on 1 October and retained that duty until 24 February 1904 . She transported Louis André , the Minister of War and Jean de Lanessan , the Minister of Marine on their tours of Corsica and Tunisia later in October . The following year , Saint Louis and the Mediterranean Squadron participated in an international naval review by President Loubet in Toulon with ships from Spain , Italy and Russia . 
 On 25 June 1903 , the ship received King Alfonso XIII of Spain aboard while visiting Cartagena . In April 1904 , she was one of the ships that escorted President Loubet during his state visit to Italy . Saint Louis visited Morocco in December 1906 and did not return to Toulon until the following month . She became the flagship of the Second Battleship Division on 18 March and then became the flagship of the 4th Division on 17 April 1908 . The ship was briefly transferred to the Northern Squadron ( escadre du Nord ) , where she became its flagship , in October 1910 , and she participated in a large naval review by President Armand Fallières off Cap Brun on 4 September 1911 . Two days later , Saint Louis was struck by the destroyer Poignard during manoeuvers off Hyères . She was relieved as the Northern Squadron flagship on 11 November and began repairs , combined with a refit , at Cherbourg . This was completed in April 1912 and the ship resumed her role as the squadron flagship on 15 April . 
 Less than two months later , she accidentally rammed the submarine Vendémiaire on 8 June off the Casquets , killing all 24 of the submarine 's crew . Saint Louis was transferred to the Mediterranean Squadron a few months later and arrived in Toulon on 9 November . She became the flagship of the Second Division of the Third Squadron on 18 March 1913 and then was transferred to the Supplementary Division ( division de Complement ) and became its flagship on 10 February 1914 . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 Together with the older French pre @-@ dreadnoughts , the ship 's first mission in the war was to escort troop convoys from North Africa to France . On 23 September , Saint Louis was ordered to Port Said to escort a British convoy carrying troops from India . She remained on escort duties until November when she was ordered to the Dardanelles to guard against a sortie by the German battlecruiser Goeben . The ship remained on station there until January 1915 when she was given a brief refit at Bizerte . Upon its completion , Saint Louis was ordered to the Eastern Mediterranean where she became the flagship of the newly formed Syrian Squadron ( escadre de Syrie ) on 9 February . These ships were intended to attack Turkish positions and lines of communication in Syria , Lebanon , Palestine and the Sinai Peninsula . Saint Louis participated in the bombardment of Gaza and El Arish in April before she was transferred back to the Dardanelles in May . 
 By this time , however , naval operations were limited to bombarding Turkish positions in support of Allied troops . The ship became the flagship of the Dardanelles Squadron ( escadre des Dardanelles ) on 26 August until she was relieved for a major refit at Lorient in October . When the refit was completed in May 1916 , Saint Louis was ordered to Salonica where she joined the French squadron assigned to prevent any interference by the Greeks with Allied operations in Greece where she arrived on 22 May . She became flagship of the Eastern Naval Division ( division navale d 'Orient ) on 26 October until she was transferred to Bizerte in February 1917 . The ship was placed in reserve in April and remained there until January 1919 when she was transferred to Toulon . 
 Saint Louis was disarmed and decommissioned on 8 February and became a training ship for stokers and engineers in Toulon . The ship was condemned on 20 June 1920 , although she was converted into an accommodation hulk . Saint Louis listed for disposal on 29 June 1931 , but was not purchased , for 600 @,@ 230 francs , until 24 May 1933 . 
 = Rod Steiger = 
 Rodney Stephen " Rod " Steiger ( April 14 , 1925 – July 9 , 2002 ) was an American actor , noted for his portrayal of offbeat , often volatile and crazed characters . Cited as " one of Hollywood 's most charismatic and dynamic stars " , he is closely associated with the art of method acting , embodying the characters he played , which at times led to clashes with directors and co @-@ stars . He starred as Marlon Brando 's mobster brother Charlie in On the Waterfront ( 1954 ) , the title character Sol <unk> in The Pawnbroker ( 1964 ) , and as police chief Bill Gillespie opposite Sidney Poitier in the film In the Heat of the Night ( 1967 ) . His In the Heat of the Night performance won him the Academy Award for Best Actor . 
 Steiger was born in Westhampton , New York , the son of a vaudevillian . He had a difficult childhood , with an alcoholic mother from whom he ran away at the age of 16 . After serving in the South Pacific Theater during World War II , he began his acting career with television roles in 1947 , and went on to garner critical acclaim for his portrayal of the main character in the teleplay " Marty " ( 1953 ) . He made his stage debut in 1946 , in a production of Curse you , Jack Dalton ! at the Civic Repertory Theatre of Newark , and subsequently appeared in productions such as An Enemy of the People ( 1950 ) , Clifford Odets 's Night Music ( 1951 ) , Seagulls Over Sorrento ( 1952 ) and Rashomon ( 1959 ) . 
 Steiger made his film debut in Fred Zinnemann 's Teresa in 1951 , and subsequently appeared in films such as The Big Knife ( 1955 ) , Oklahoma ! ( 1955 ) , Across the Bridge ( 1957 ) and Al Capone ( 1959 ) . After Steiger 's performance in The Pawnbroker in 1964 , in which he played an embittered Jewish Holocaust survivor working as a pawnbroker in New York City , he portrayed an opportunistic Russian politician in David Lean 's Doctor Zhivago ( 1965 ) . In the Heat of the Night ( 1967 ) won five Academy Awards , including Best Picture and Best Actor for Steiger , who was lauded for his performance as a Mississippi police chief who learns to respect an African @-@ American officer ( Poitier ) as they search for a killer . The following year , he played a serial killer of many guises in No Way to Treat a Lady . 
 During the 1970s , Steiger increasingly turned to European productions in his search for more demanding roles . He portrayed Napoleon Bonaparte in Waterloo ( 1970 ) , a Mexican bandit in Sergio Leone 's Duck , You Sucker ! ( 1971 ) , Benito Mussolini in Last Days of Mussolini ( 1975 ) , and ended the decade playing a disturbed priest in The Amityville Horror ( 1979 ) . By the 1980s , heart problems and depression took its toll on Steiger 's career , and he found it difficult to find employment , agreeing to appear in low @-@ budget B movies . One of his final roles was as judge H. Lee Sarokin in the prison drama The Hurricane ( 1999 ) , which reunited him with In the Heat of the Night director Norman Jewison . Steiger was married five times , and had a daughter , opera singer Anna Steiger , and a son , Michael Steiger . He died of pneumonia and complications from surgery for a gall bladder tumor on July 9 , 2002 , aged 77 , in Los Angeles , and was survived by his fifth wife Joan Benedict Steiger . 
 = = Early life and acting background = = 
 Steiger was born on April 14 , 1925 in Westhampton , New York , the only child of Lorraine ( née Driver ) and Frederick Steiger , of French , Scottish and German descent . Rod was raised as a Lutheran . He never knew his father , a vaudevillian who had been part of a traveling song @-@ and @-@ dance team with Steiger 's mother , but was told that he was a handsome Latino @-@ looking man , who was a talented musician and dancer . Biographer Tom Hutchinson describes him as a " shadowy , fugitive figure " , one who " haunted " Rod throughout his life and was an " invisible presence and unseen influence " . 
 Hutchinson described Steiger 's mother as " plump , energetic and small , with long auburn hair " . She had a good singing voice and nearly became a Hollywood actress , but after a leg surgery permanently impaired her walking ability , she gave up acting and turned to alcohol . As a result , she quit show business and moved away from Westhampton to raise her son . They moved through several towns , including Irvington and Bloomfield , before settling in Newark , New Jersey . Her alcoholism caused Steiger much embarrassment , and the family was frequently mocked by other children and their parents within the community . At the age of five he was sexually abused by a pedophile who lured him in with a butterfly collection . Steiger said of his troubled family background : " If you had the choice of having the childhood you experienced , with your alcoholic mother and being the famous actor you are today , or having a loving , secure childhood and not being famous , which would you take ? A loving , secure childhood in a New York minute " . During the last 11 years of her life , Steiger 's mother stayed sober and regularly attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings . Steiger recalled : " I was so proud of her . She turned herself around . She came alive again " . 
 During his childhood , and owing to his considerable strength and bulk , Steiger became known as " The Rock " . Despite being mocked over his mother 's alcoholism , he was a popular figure at school and an able softball player . He displayed an interest in writing poetry and acting during his adolescent years , and appeared in several school plays while at West Side High School in Newark . Tired of fighting with his mother , he ran away from home at age sixteen to join the United States Navy during World War II . 
 He enlisted on May 11 , 1942 , and received his training at the U.S. Naval Training Station in Newport , Rhode Island . He joined the newly commissioned USS Taussig ( DD @-@ 746 ) on May 20 , 1944 . While serving as a <unk> on destroyers , he saw action in the South Pacific , including the Battle of Iwo Jima . Steiger later commented : " I loved the Navy . I was stupid enough to think I was being heroic " . His experiences during the war haunted him for the rest of his life , particularly the loss of Americans during the Battle of Iwo Jima , as well as the sinking of vessels by the Taussig which were known to have women and children aboard . On December 17 , 1944 , Steiger and the Taussig encountered a severe typhoon , which became known as Halsey 's Typhoon , that created winds reaching one hundred knots ( 115 mph ) and 80 foot ( 24 m ) waves off the coast of Luzon in the Philippines . As a result , three U.S. destroyers were lost , but the Taussig survived , with Steiger tying a rope to himself on deck and flattening himself as waves engulfed the ship . 
 After the war , the GI Bill of Rights paid for his rent at a room on West 81st Street in New York City , an income of just over $ 100 a month , and four years of schooling . He initially found a job oiling machines and washing floors . He decided to attend a drama class , primarily because of its membership of attractive young women . Known as the Civil Service Little Theater group , it was conducted by the Office of <unk> and <unk> , where he was employed at the time . This led him to start a two @-@ year course at the New School for Social Research , run by German émigré Erwin Piscator . During one audition , Steiger was cast after barely uttering a few words , the director exclaiming he had a " fresh , wonderful quality " . Another talented pupil at the time was Walter Matthau , who dubbed the institution " The Neurotic School for Sexual Research " . Steiger was surprised to discover his own talent as an actor , and he was encouraged to pursue further studies at the Dramatic Workshop . One of the main reasons he wanted to be an actor was to regain public respect for his family name , which had so humiliated him during childhood . Another important factor was his belief that he did not " have the temperament for a regular job " , and would have ended up a miserable , violent alcoholic . His only role model as an actor was Paul Muni , whom he thought was " the greatest " , though he also had a deep respect for French actor Harry Baur and , according to biographer Hutchinson , he admired Charlie Chaplin " to the point of adoration " .

 Steiger made his stage debut in a production of Curse you , Jack Dalton ! ( 1946 ) at the Civic Repertory Theatre of Newark . Subsequent to this , he received an invitation from one of his teachers , Daniel Mann , to attend the Actors Studio , established by Elia Kazan in October 1947 . It was here , along with Marlon Brando , Karl Malden and Eli Wallach , that he studied method acting , which became deeply engrained in him . Lacking matinée idol looks , much like Malden and Wallach , he began pursuing a career as a character actor rather than as a leading man . Steiger 's stage work continued in 1950 , with a minor role as a <unk> in a stage production of An Enemy of the People at the Music Box Theatre . His first major role on Broadway came in Clifford Odets 's production of Night Music ( 1951 ) , where he played A. L. Rosenberger . The play was held at the <unk> Playhouse . The following year , he played a <unk> in the play Seagulls Over Sorrento , performed at the John Golden Theatre beginning on September 11 , 1952 . 
 Steiger 's early roles , although minor , were numerous , especially in television series during the early 1950s , when he appeared in more than 250 live television productions over a five @-@ year period . He was spotted by Fred Coe , NBC 's manager of program development , who increasingly gave him bigger parts . Steiger considered television to be what repertory theatre had been for an earlier generation , and saw it as a place where he could test his talent with a plethora of different roles . Soon afterward he began receiving positive reviews from critics such as John Crosby , who noted that Steiger regularly gave " effortless persuasive performances " . Among Steiger 's credits were Danger ( 1950 – 53 ) , Lux Video Theatre ( 1951 ) , Out There ( 1951 ) , Tales of Tomorrow ( 1952 – 53 ) , The Gulf Playhouse ( 1953 ) , Medallion Theatre ( 1953 ) , Goodyear Television Playhouse ( 1953 ) , and as Shakespeare 's Romeo in " The First Command Performance of Romeo and Juliet ( 1957 ) " episode of You Are There in 1954 , under director Sidney Lumet . He continued to make appearances in various playhouse television productions , appearing in five episodes of Kraft Theatre ( 1952 – 54 ) , which earned him praise from critics , six episodes of The Philco Television Playhouse ( 1951 – 55 ) and two episodes of Schlitz Playhouse of Stars ( 1957 – 58 ) . Steiger made his big screen debut in 1953 , with a small role in Fred Zinnemann 's Teresa , shot in 1951 . Steiger , who described himself as " cocky " , won over Zinnemann by praising his direction . Zinnemann recalled that Steiger was " very popular , extremely articulate and full of remarkable memories " , and the two remained highly respectful of each other for life . 
 On May 24 , 1953 , Steiger played the title role in Paddy Chayefsky 's " Marty " episode of the Goodyear Television Playhouse . The role had originally been intended for Martin Ritt , who later became a director . " Marty " is the story of a lonely and homely butcher from the Bronx in search of love . The play was a critical success that increased Steiger 's public exposure ; Tom Stempel noted that he brought " striking intensity to his performance as Marty , particularly in giving us Marty 's pain " . As Steiger refused to sign a seven @-@ year studio contract , he was replaced with Ernest Borgnine in the film Marty ( 1955 ) , which won the Academy Award for Best Picture , as well as the Best Actor Oscar for Borgnine . 1953 proved to be Steiger 's breakthrough year ; he garnered Sylvania Awards for Marty and four other best performances of the year — as <unk> and Rudolph Hess in two episodes of You Are There , as gangster Dutch Schultz in a thriller , and as a radar operator in My Brother 's Keeper . 
 For his role as Charley " the Gent " , the brother of Marlon Brando 's character in Elia Kazan 's On the Waterfront ( 1954 ) , Steiger was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor . Film writer Leo <unk> wrote that the " incessantly repeated images of its taxicab confrontation between Brando and Rod Steiger have made the film iconic " . The taxicab scene took eleven hours to shoot and was heavily scripted , despite Brando fuelling the popular myth in his autobiography that the scene was improvised . Brando stated that seven takes were needed because Steiger could not stop crying , which Steiger found to be unfair and inaccurate . Though Steiger retained great respect for Brando as an actor , he disliked him as a person and frequently complained during the production of Brando 's " predilection for leaving the set " immediately after shooting his scenes . Steiger later remarked : " We didn 't get to know each other at all . He always flew solo and I haven 't seen him since the film . I do resent him saying he 's just a hooker , and that actors are whores " . Steiger also responded unfavorably when he learned that Kazan had been awarded an honorary Oscar by the Academy in 1999 . In a 1999 interview with BBC News , Steiger said he probably would not have done On the Waterfront if he had known at the time that Kazan provided the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee with names of performers suspected of being Communists . 
 Steiger played Jud Fry in the film version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Oklahoma ! ( 1955 ) , in which he performed his own singing . It was one of the biggest location film productions of the 1950s , shot near Nogales , Arizona with a crew of 325 people and some 70 trucks . Steiger portrayed a disturbed , emotionally isolated version of Jud , which television channel Turner Classic Movies ( TCM ) believed brought a " complexity to the character that went far beyond the stock musical villain " . Steiger observed that James Dean , who auditioned for the role that went to Gordon MacRae , was a " nice kid absorbed by his own ego , so much so that it was destroying him " , which he thought led to his death . Dean reportedly gave Steiger his prized copy of Ernest Hemingway 's book Death in the Afternoon , and had underlined every appearance of the word " death " . 
 Later in 1955 , Steiger played an obnoxious film tycoon , loosely based on Columbia boss Harry Cohn , opposite Jack Palance and Ida Lupino in Robert Aldrich 's film noir The Big Knife . Steiger bleached his hair for the part , sought inspiration for the role from Russian actor Vladimir Sokoloff , read a book about the Treblinka extermination camp to understand his character thoroughly , and visited the perfume department of a store in Beverly Hills , California , to try to understand his character 's contempt for women . Steiger and Palance did not get along during the production , and in one scene Palance threw several record albums at Steiger in frustration , feeling that he was trying to steal the scene . Steiger earned critical acclaim later that year for a role as a prosecuting major in Otto Preminger 's The Court @-@ Martial of Billy Mitchell , alongside Gary Cooper and Charles Bickford . 
 Steiger portrayed the character " Pinky " in Columbia Pictures ' western , Jubal ( 1956 ) , which co @-@ starred Glenn Ford and Ernest Borgnine . Steiger 's character is a rancher , a " sneering baddie " , who becomes jealous when his former mistress becomes attracted to Ford 's character .. Ford noted Steiger 's deep commitment to method acting during production , considering him to be a " fine actor but a real strange fellow " . Steiger disliked the experience and frequently clashed with director Delmer Daves , who was more favorable to Ford 's lighthearted take on the film . Upon its release in April 1956 , a writer for Variety was impressed with the " evil venom " displayed by his character , and remarked that there had not " been as hateful a screen heavy around in a long time " . In Mark Robson 's The Harder They Fall , Steiger played a crooked boxing promoter who hires a sports journalist ( Humphrey Bogart in his last role ) . Steiger referred to Bogart as " a professional " who had " tremendous authority " during filming .

 Steiger <unk> in three films released in 1957 . The first was John Farrow 's film noir The Unholy Wife , in which he played a wealthy Napa Valley vintner who marries a femme fatale named Phyllis ( Diana Dors ) . In its original review of the film , The New York Times described Steiger 's performance as " curious " further stating that the actor 's voice modulation " ranges from Marlon Brando to Ronald Colman and back . " During the production of Samuel Fuller 's Run of the Arrow , in which he played a confederate veteran who refuses to accept defeat following the surrender of General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox at the end of the American Civil War , Steiger badly sprained his ankle before shooting one of the battle scenes and was unable to walk , let alone run . Fuller instead got one of the Native American extras to run in Steiger 's place , which is why the scene was shot showing only the feet , instead of using close @-@ ups . Steiger had researched the history behind the film and decided to play the character as an Irishman , becoming " the first Irish cowboy " as he put it . Later that year , Steiger took the lead role in the British thriller Across the Bridge , in which he played a German conman with British citizenship who goes into hiding in Mexico after embezzling company funds . Film critic Dennis Schwartz stated that Steiger gave " one of his greatest performances " . 
 Steiger portrayed a mastermind criminal seeking to obtain a $ 500 @,@ 000 ransom , opposite James Mason and Inger Stevens , in Andrew L. Stone 's Cry Terror ! ( 1958 ) for Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer . Paul Beckley of the Herald Tribune had thought Steiger " superbly laconic " , but Dennis Schwartz dismissed the film as " an ill @-@ conceived attempt " with " too many coincidences and contrived plot points to sustain interest " . The following year , Steiger appeared with Claire Bloom ( whom he later married ) in a Fay and Michael Kanin stage production of Akira Kurosawa 's 1950 film , Rashomon , where he enacted the role of the bandit originally played by Toshiro Mifune . A major success , it was lauded by critics and nominated for three Tony awards . Robert Coleman of the Daily Mirror described Steiger 's performance as " magnificently <unk> " , while Kenneth Tynan of The New Yorker thought the acting helped set new standards for Broadway . The same year , Steiger portrayed iconic mobster Al Capone in the film of the same name . Steiger was particularly keen on demonstrating the <unk> of Capone , speaking thunderously , slinging a camel @-@ hair coat over his shoulders and wearing his hat at a jaunty angle . The film , noted for its <unk> portrayal of the subject , earned Steiger a Laurel Award for Best Male Dramatic Performance nomination . Though Hutchinson , author of Rod Steiger : Memoirs of a friendship , perceived Steiger 's portrayal of Capone to be more of a caricature , George Anastasia and Glen <unk> , authors of the book The Ultimate Book of Gangster Movies , described it as one of the best screen portrayals of Capone . 
 Following the success of Al Capone , Steiger played sophisticated thief Paul Mason , who masterminds a caper to steal $ 4 million in French francs from the underground vault of the casino of Monte Carlo , in the Henry Hathaway heist film Seven Thieves ( 1960 ) . Bosley Crowther of The New York Times gave a positive review of the film , praising the " nerve @-@ <unk> delicate plot " and the " most elaborate roles " of Steiger and his co @-@ star , Edward G. Robinson . The following year , he took the part of a prison psychiatrist who tries to cure the psychological demons of Stuart Whitman 's character in The Mark . Steiger 's performance was so convincing that , after the film was released , he received a call from a psychiatric institution asking him to attend one of their board meetings . The Mark was followed by a role in the European film production of World in My Pocket alongside Nadja Tiller . Steiger increasingly played in films in Italy and France during this period . Not only did he believe he had greater credibility and esteem as an actor in Europe , but he approved of the more relaxed filming schedule prevalent there at that time . 
 In 1962 , Steiger appeared on Broadway in Moby Dick — <unk> , at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre , as well as playing a detective searching for a scientist 's ( Alan Ladd 's ) mugger in Philip Leacock 's 13 West Street for Columbia Pictures . Steiger played the role of a destroyer commander in the large ensemble cast of The Longest Day , which included John Wayne , Richard Todd , Robert Mitchum , Richard Burton , Sean Connery and Henry Fonda . According to co @-@ star Richard Burton , Steiger had admitted to him that he was in financial trouble at the time and had had a face lift , which Burton thought made him look like " one half of a naked ass @-@ hole " . The following year , Steiger played ruthless Neapolitan land developer and city councilman Edoardo <unk> , who uses his political power to make personal profit in a large scale suburban real estate deal , in Francesco Rosi 's Italian production , Hands over the City ( 1963 ) . According to biographer Francesco <unk> , Rosi had cast Steiger in the Italian language film because he had wanted " a rich interpreter of great capacity " in the part of the land developer . 
 = = = Mainstream film acclaim ( 1964 – 1969 ) = = = 
 Shortly after Hands over the City , Steiger agreed to appear in another Italian film , Time of Indifference ( 1964 ) , in which he starred opposite Claudia Cardinale and Shelley Winters . Though Steiger 's powerful performance was unaffected , the production was marred by a dispute between director Francesco Maselli and producer Franco Cristaldi , with one wanting it to be a purely political film and the other wanting emphasis on the erotic subplot and his relationship with Cardinale . In Sidney Lumet 's gritty drama The Pawnbroker ( 1964 ) , Steiger played an embittered , emotionally withdrawn survivor of the Holocaust living in New York City . Richard Harland Smith of TCM notes that Steiger 's career was waning at the time , and he had to " scramble for paying gigs for a decade " . Steiger agreed to a reduced fee of $ 50 @,@ 000 . He read Lumet 's novel and the script many times to develop an intimate understanding of the character , and insisted on reducing his lines to make his character more realistic and alienated from society . Lumet noted that during the production Steiger had a tendency to be overly dramatic , stating : " Sure , Rod has weaknesses of rhetoric , but you can talk them through with him . I explained that this solitary Jew could not rise to heights of emotion ; he had been hammered by life and by people . The faith he had to find was in other people , because God had betrayed him . " Steiger remarked of the film : " I think my best work is in The Pawnbroker . The last scene , where I find the boy dead on the street . I think that 's the highest moment , whatever it may be , with my talent . " He drew upon inspiration for this climactic scene , in which he appears to show his frustration through a silent scream , from Picasso 's " Guernica " , which depicts war @-@ ravaged villagers . Cecil Wilson of the Daily Mail wrote that Steiger 's character " seems to encompass all the agony ever inflicted on man " . Although the film attracted controversy and was accused of anti @-@ Semitism , Steiger was widely acclaimed for his performance , which garnered him the prize for Best Actor at the Berlin International Film Festival and his second Best Actor nomination at the Oscars . Steiger was so certain that he had produced an Oscar @-@ winning performance that he was shocked when he lost to Lee Marvin . 
 In 1965 , Steiger played an effeminate embalmer in Tony Richardson 's comedy The Loved One , about the funeral business in Los Angeles , based on the 1948 short satirical novel by Evelyn Waugh . His curly @-@ haired appearance in the film was modeled on a bust of Apollo he once saw while meeting Richardson . Steiger offended Bosley Crowther of The New York Times , who found his character repellent . His next role , as <unk> , a Russian politician and " villainous opportunist " who rapes Julie Christie 's character in David Lean 's Doctor Zhivago ( 1965 ) , was one of his favorites . Steiger , one of only two Americans in the cast , was initially apprehensive about working with such great British actors as Ralph Richardson and Alec Guinness , and was pleased when the film was completed that he did not stand out as an American . The film was the biggest international box office draw of the 1960s , grossing $ 200 million worldwide . It has since been acclaimed as one of the greatest films ever made , and in 1998 was selected as the 39th best American film in the original AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Movies list by the American Film Institute . 
 Steiger had intended returning to the stage , and had signed on to play the title character in Bertolt Brecht 's Galileo , at the Lincoln Center Repertory Company in April 1967 , but the production was cancelled when he became ill . Steiger won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Chief of Police Bill Gillespie in In the Heat of the Night , opposite Sidney Poitier . He played a Southern police chief searching for a murderer . <unk> against blacks , he jumps to the conclusion that the culprit is Virgil Tibbs ( Poitier ) , an African @-@ American man passing through town after visiting his mother , who later turns out to be an experienced homicide detective from Philadelphia . The film deals with the way the two men interact and join forces in solving the crime , as Steiger 's Gillespie learns to greatly respect the black man he initially took to be a criminal . Steiger drew upon his experience in the Navy with a Southerner named " King " , remembering his accent . Poitier considered Steiger and Spencer Tracy to have been the finest actors he had ever worked with , remarking in 1995 , " He 's so good he made me dig into bags I never knew I had . " A. D. Murphy of Variety described Steiger 's performance as " outstanding " , writing : " Steiger 's transformation from a diehard Dixie bigot to a man who learns to respect Poitier stands out in smooth comparison to the wandering solution of the murder . " Steiger won a plethora of other awards , including a BAFTA , a Golden Globe , a Laurel Award and awards for Best Actor from the National Society of Film Critics and the New York Film Critics Circle . 
 In 1968 , Steiger played a deranged serial killer opposite George Segal in Jack <unk> 's black comedy thriller No Way to Treat a Lady . During the course of the film , he adopts various disguises , including those of a priest , a policeman , a plumber , and a hairdresser , to avoid being identified , and to put his victims at ease , before strangling them and painting a pair of lips on their foreheads with garish red lipstick . The film and Steiger 's performance were critically acclaimed , with Vincent Canby of The New York Times highlighting Steiger 's " beautifully uninhibited performance as a hammy " , and a writer for Time Out describing him as " brilliant as a sort of Boston strangler , son of a great actress who has left her boy with a mother fixation " . Later in 1968 , Steiger played a repressed gay non @-@ commissioned officer opposite John Phillip Law in John Flynn 's The Sergeant for Warner Bros.-Seven Arts , which earned him the David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Actor . Despite the award win , film critic Pauline Kael of The New Yorker was particularly critical of the casting of Steiger as a homosexual and felt that he was " totally outside his range " , to which Steiger concurred that he was ineffective . 
 Steiger was cast as a short @-@ tempered tattooed man with soon @-@ to @-@ be ex @-@ wife Claire Bloom in the science fiction picture The Illustrated Man ( 1969 ) . The film was a critical and commercial failure , and Ray Bradbury , who wrote the screenplay , said : " Rod was very good in it , but it wasn 't a good film ... the script was terrible " . Steiger had better luck alongside Bloom later that year in Peter Hall 's British drama Three into Two Won 't Go , playing an Irishman who cheats on his wife with a young hiker . It was entered into the Berlin International Film Festival and became the 19th most popular film at the UK box office in 1969 . 
 = = = Historical roles and declining fortunes ( 1970 – 1981 ) = = = 
 Steiger was offered the title role in Patton ( 1970 ) , but turned it down because he did not want to glorify war . The role was then given to George C. Scott , who won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance . Steiger called this refusal his " dumbest career move " , remarking , " I got on my high horse . I thought I was a pacifist . " Instead , he chose to portray Napoleon Bonaparte opposite Christopher Plummer in Sergei Bondarchuk 's Waterloo ( 1970 ) , a co @-@ production between the Soviet Union and Italy . One commentator wrote : " I watched with extraordinary respect , no , that is not the right word , with enthusiasm , the acting of Rod Steiger in the role of Napoleon in Waterloo , " while literary critic Daniel S. Burt describes Steiger 's Napoleon as an " unusual interpretation " , finding him less convincing than Plummer 's Wellington . 
 In 1971 , Steiger played a chauvinistic big game hunter , explorer and war hero opposite Susannah York in Mark Robson 's Happy Birthday , Wanda June , before agreeing to star alongside James Coburn as Mexican bandit Juan Miranda in Sergio Leone 's Duck , You Sucker ! , which was alternatively titled A Fistful of Dynamite . Leone was initially dissatisfied with his performance in that he played his character as a serious , Zapata @-@ like figure . As a result , tension grew between Steiger and Leone , including one incident that ended with Steiger walking off during the filming of the scene where Juan 's stagecoach is destroyed . After the film 's completion , Leone and Steiger were content with the final result , and Steiger praised Leone for his skills as a director . Steiger auditioned for the role of Michael Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola 's The Godfather ( 1972 ) , a film adaptation of Italian American author Mario Puzo 's 1969 novel of the same name , but Puzo felt that Steiger was too old for the part and rejected him . 
 Steiger played a rural Tennessee patriarch and brother of Jeff Bridges , at odds with Robert Ryan 's character , in Lolly @-@ Madonna XXX ( 1973 ) , which received mixed reviews . Later that year he was cast as the turban @-@ wearing German officer Guenther von Lutz in Duccio <unk> 's Italian war comedy The Heroes , opposite Rod Taylor , and appeared as " foul @-@ mouthed Sicilian mobster " Eugenio Giannini opposite Gian Maria Volontè 's Lucky Luciano in Francesco Rosi 's film of the same name . 
 In 1975 , Steiger portrayed Italian dictator Benito Mussolini in Carlo <unk> 's Last Days of Mussolini , which received a positive critical reception . He appeared in Claude Chabrol 's French picture Innocents with Dirty Hands , playing the role of Louis Wormser , the wealthy alcoholic husband of Romy Schneider 's character Julie Wormser . It was poorly received by critics , and Steiger found the director , whom he had admired , a bitter disappointment . He was highly critical of Chabrol 's lack of communication and aloofness from the production , and preference for playing chess on set instead of talking through scenes . Vincent Canby of The New York Times dismissed it as " little more than a soap opera " , writing : " The performances are of a piece — uniformly atrocious . Mr. Steiger surpasses his own earlier records for lumbering busyness . Within his first few minutes on screen he ( 1 ) gets drunk , ( 2 ) whines , ( 3 ) pleads for understanding , ( 4 ) weeps and ( 5 ) goes to bed alone . " Later that year , Steiger starred as an Irish Republican Army terrorist who plans to blow up the Houses of Parliament in Don Sharp 's British thriller Hennessy . John Simon of New York Magazine wrote : " This fellow Hennessy , as played by Rod Steiger , is about as interesting and likable as a Guy Fawkes dummy . " 
 The following year , Steiger portrayed the comic actor W. C. Fields in an Arthur Hiller biopic , W. C. Fields and Me , for Universal Pictures . The screenplay , which was based on a memoir by Carlotta Monti , who was Fields ' mistress for the last 14 years of his life , was penned by Bob Merrill . Steiger read extensively about Fields in preparation for the role , and developed an encyclopaedic knowledge of his career and personal life . He concluded that he would base his characterization around his performance in The Bank Dick ( 1940 ) . One day , Fields ' mistress Monti turned up on set , and watched the scene where he briefly thanks everybody . Nervous that she might not approve , he broke down in tears after Monti met him after the scene and fondly said " Woody , Woody , Woody , My Woody " , a nickname used only by those very close to Fields . Despite the energy Steiger put into the picture , like the actor 's previous recent films , it was poorly received by critics . Canby called it " dreadful " and described Steiger 's portrayal of Fields as a " wax dummy of a character " . Lucia Bozzola of The New York Times later referred to Steiger 's portrayal of Fields as " superb " , but noted that his Hollywood career had " undeniably fallen from his 1950s and ' 60s heights " . 
 Steiger played Pontius Pilate in Franco Zeffirelli 's TV miniseries Jesus of Nazareth ( 1977 ) . Stacy Keach , who portrayed Barabbas , expressed his joy at the opportunity to work with Steiger , describing him as " generous and opinionated " . In 1978 , Steiger played a senator in Norman Jewison 's F.I.S.T. , opposite Sylvester Stallone , who played a Cleveland warehouse worker involved in the labor union leadership of the fictional organisation named Federation of Inter @-@ State Truckers . Love and Bullets , later that year , in which Steiger appeared as a mafia boss , was poorly received ; Roger Ebert dismissed it as a " hopelessly confused hodgepodge of chases , killings , enigmatic meetings and separations , and insufferably overacted scenes by Steiger alternating with alarmingly <unk> scenes by [ Charles ] Bronson " . The following year , Steiger was cast as a general opposite Richard Burton and Robert Mitchum in Andrew V. McLaglen 's war film Breakthrough , set on the Western Front . In The Amityville Horror ( 1979 ) , Steiger appeared as a disturbed priest , who is invited to perform an exorcism on a haunted house . Again Steiger was accused of overacting ; Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote : " Mr. Steiger bellows and weeps and overdoes absolutely everything . He won 't even pick up the phone before it 's rung 12 or 15 times . " Pauline Kael thought that Steiger 's " spiritual agony was enough to shatter the camera lens " . 
 In 1980 , Steiger received two Genie Award for Best Performance by a Foreign Actor nominations for his roles in Klondike Fever and The Lucky Star , both Canadian productions . Klondike Fever is based on Jack London 's journey from San Francisco to the Klondike gold fields in 1898 . Steiger revisited his role as Mussolini in Lion of the Desert , a production that was financed by Muammar Gaddafi , and which co @-@ starred Anthony Quinn as Bedouin tribal leader Omar Mukhtar , fighting the Italian army in the years leading up to World War II . The Italian authorities reportedly banned the film in 1982 , as it was considered damaging to the army , and it was not shown on Italian television until a state visit by Gaddafi in 2009 . It received critical acclaim in Britain , where it was praised in particular for the quality of its battle scenes . Later in 1981 , Steiger won the Montréal World Film Festival Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of white @-@ bearded Orthodox rabbi Reb Saunders in Jeremy Kagan 's The Chosen . Janet Maslin commented that Steiger 's " slow , rolling delivery " was more " numbing than prepossessing " , though a critic from Variety thought it an " exceptional performance as the somewhat tyrannical but loving patriarch " .

 After his open @-@ heart surgery in 1979 , clinical depression and health problems during the 1980s directly impacted Steiger 's career , and he often turned to B @-@ movies , low @-@ budget , independent productions and TV miniseries . He admitted that during this period he accepted " everything I was offered " , and knew that many of the films he appeared in were not great , but wanted to demonstrate his strong work ethic despite his issues . He later regretted the poorer films in which he appeared during the 1980s , and wished he had done more stage work . He sank into an even deeper depression when he was not involved in acting , but it bothered him more that his acting career had taken a turn for the worse and was no longer challenging . The major studio producers were wary of his problems and considered him a liability . Steiger spoke about the experience to a younger colleague while advising : " Never tell anyone if you 've got heart problems , kid . Never . " His reputation as a fine character actor remained intact , and Joel Hirschhorn at the time considered his talent to be " as strong as ever " . 
 In 1984 , Steiger starred as a detective assigned to investigate the murder of a Chicago psychoanalyst ( Roger Moore ) , a man whom he detests from a previous case , in Bryan Forbes 's The Naked Face . Richard Christiansen of the Chicago Tribune referred to it as a " wimpy suspense movie shot in Chicago in the fall of 1983 , [ that ] doesn 't do much good for the city or for anyone connected with it " , and considered Steiger to be " acting in his high hysteria gear " , who " snarls and whines and <unk> " . Steiger took a break from cinema in the mid @-@ 1980s , during which he appeared in the Yorkshire Television mini @-@ series The Glory Boys ( 1984 ) with Anthony Perkins , and Hollywood Wives ( 1985 ) with Angie Dickinson . Steiger and Perkins were at loggerheads during the production of The Glory Boys . Perkins resented the fact that Steiger insisted on a bigger trailer and felt that Steiger was trying to steal scenes from him , while Steiger had thought Perkins " so jittery and jinxed by the chemicals he was taking " that he felt sorry for him and believed that he was jeopardizing the success of the film . Steiger also performed on Joni Mitchell 's 1985 album Dog Eat Dog , where he provided the voice of an evangelist in the song " Tax Free " . 
 Steiger appeared in the Argentine @-@ American film Catch the Heat ( 1987 ) , a martial arts picture about a Brazilian drug baroness who smuggles drugs into the United States inside her breast implants . According to director Fred Olen Ray , it was pulled from distribution within a week of release . In 1988 , Steiger and Yvonne De Carlo played a spooky elderly couple with developmentally delayed children in John Hough 's horror film American Gothic . Universally panned by the critics , Caryn James of The New York Times wrote : " Mr. Steiger addresses the camera as if he were reciting Shakespeare , he is truly , straightforwardly , hilariously bad . " During the last year of the decade he played authority figures , including a mayor in The January Man , and as Judge Prescott in Tennessee Waltz . Although Steiger admitted that his performance in The January Man was " way over the top " , he enjoyed the experience , thereby marking a positive turning point after a period of clinical depression . 
 In 1990 , Steiger starred in Men of Respect , a crime drama film adaptation of William Shakespeare 's play Macbeth . He played a character based on King Duncan , opposite John Turturro as Mike Battaglia ( Macbeth ) , who plays a Mafia hitman who climbs his way to the top by killing Steiger 's character . The film was critically panned , with Roger Ebert awarding it one star out of four , describing the concept as a " very , very bad idea " . Steiger played another mobster , Sam Giancana , two years later in the miniseries Sinatra ( 1992 ) . 
 Steiger portrayed a reverend living in a small town in the American South in the macabre Merchant Ivory film production The Ballad of the Sad Café ( 1991 ) , co @-@ starring Vanessa Redgrave and Keith Carradine . The film met with generally lukewarm reviews , though it was entered into the 41st Berlin International Film Festival . Steiger auditioned for the part of an elderly Irishman in Ron Howard 's Far and Away , starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman . Steiger , who had long been bald , was ordered by Howard to wear a wig to the audition . He resented the fact that Howard insisted on taping the audition , which he believed to be a form of humiliation for actors , serving as after @-@ dinner entertainment for the Hollywood executives . Steiger never forgave Howard , whom he referred to as a " <unk> " , for rejecting him for the part and giving it to Cyril Cusack . 
 In 1993 , Steiger portrayed an aging gynaecologist who terrorizes his urban neighbors in a rural community in Burlington , Vermont in The Neighbor . Dennis Schwartz considered it to have been one of Steiger 's creepiest roles , though he thought that the poor script had rendered the role awkward and " mildly entertaining in the sense that Steiger is asked to carry the film and hams it up " . The following year , Steiger agreed to play a Cuban mob boss opposite Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone in Luis Llosa 's thriller The Specialist , citing its purpose as a " $ 40 million commercial " to show a new generation that he existed . Critics panned the film , which has a four percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 27 reviews as of July 2015 . The role earned Steiger a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor nomination , and the film was listed in The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of " The 100 Most <unk> Bad Movies Ever Made " . 
 = = = Later work and final years ( 1995 – 2002 ) = = = 
 Following The Specialist ( 1994 ) , Steiger appeared in Tom Clancy 's Op Center ( 1995 ) , a film that was edited down into a TV miniseries , and featured in a Columbo television film , Strange Bedfellows . The following year , he took a minor role as Doc Wallace in the Dale Rosenbloom family drama Shiloh . He reprised the role three years later in the sequel . Also in 1996 , Steiger played a " jingoistic top general " who " petitions the president to go nuclear in the middle of a global crisis " in the ensemble production of Mars Attacks ! . 
 In 1997 , Steiger played Tony <unk> , the mob boss of Vincent Gallo 's character in Kiefer Sutherland 's Truth or Consequences , N.M. , a gritty noir about a drug heist gone wrong . Steiger played judges in Antonio Banderas 's comedy @-@ drama Crazy in Alabama and in the prison drama , The Hurricane , both in 1999 , the latter of which tells the story of former middleweight boxer Rubin Carter , who was wrongly convicted of a triple homicide in a bar in Paterson , New Jersey . The Hurricane reunited Steiger with Norman Jewison , who had directed him in In the Heat of the Night . Steiger portrayed H. Lee Sarokin , the judge responsible for freeing Carter . Sarokin thought it was a " marvellous film " that was Oscar @-@ worthy , but found Steiger 's portrayal as overacted and a " little arrogant and pompous " . 
 After a minor role as a " bombastic priest " in End of Days ( 1999 ) , Steiger was one of the lead actors in Burt Reynolds 's The Last Producer ( 2000 ) , a film about a washed @-@ up , veteran producer ( Reynolds ) who tries to re @-@ enter the movie business by producing a new film . Steiger 's last film role was as the billiard hall manager , Nick , in <unk> Junkies ( 2002 ) ; it was poorly received by critics .

 Steiger was married five times : he married actress Sally Gracie ( 1952 – 1958 ) , actress Claire Bloom ( 1959 – 1969 ) , secretary Sherry Nelson ( 1973 – 1979 ) , singer Paula Ellis ( 1986 – 1997 ) and actress Joan Benedict Steiger ( married 2000 until his death ) . He had a daughter , opera singer Anna Steiger ( born in 1960 ) by Bloom , and a son , Michael Steiger ( born in 1993 ) , from his marriage to Ellis . In an interview with journalist Kenneth Passingham , Steiger stated that Bloom was " all I ever wanted in a woman " , and that " maybe our marriage was better than most because we were both established when we met " . The couple bought a home in Malibu , California , a community that appealed to Steiger but which Bloom found boring . They also purchased an apartment in Manhattan and a cottage in County Galway , in close proximity to John Huston 's home . Financial considerations led Steiger to sell their New York apartment in the mid @-@ 1970s . It upset him greatly when his marriage with Bloom ended in 1969 and that she quickly remarried Broadway producer Hillard Elkins the same year , a man whom Steiger had entrusted to care for her while he was away shooting Waterloo . Steiger was also close friends with actress Elizabeth Taylor . 
 Steiger was outspoken on McCarthyism . He was particularly critical of Charlton Heston 's stance on weapons , and publicly referred to him as " America 's favorite fascist " . In one clash in a column in the Los Angeles Times , Steiger responded to a letter sent by Heston saying that he was shocked that the American Film Institute had not honored Elia Kazan because of his testimony to the Un @-@ American Activities Committee . Steiger wrote that he was " appalled , appalled , appalled " at actors and writers who had been forced to drive cabs because they were blacklisted and had even committed suicide as a result . Heston did not reply . 
 Steiger suffered from depression throughout much of his life . He described himself as " incapacitated for about eight years with clinical depression " before his Oscar win for In The Heat of the Night . His career problems from the 1970s onwards were often exacerbated by health issues . He underwent open @-@ heart surgery in 1976 and 1979 and struggled with obesity , though certain roles , such as Napoleon , required him to intentionally gain weight . After the decline of his third marriage in 1979 , a deep depression , partly a side effect of his surgery , during the 1980s negatively affected his career . He became increasingly reclusive during this period , often confining himself to his apartment , watching American football for several hours . He said of the experience : " You begin to lose self @-@ esteem . You don 't walk , you don 't shave and if no one was watching you 'd go to the bathroom right where you were sitting " . He would lie in bed at night thinking " You 'll never act again . Why bother ? You 're no good " . Despite these challenges , Steiger continued to act into the 1990s and early 2000s . In one of his final interviews , he stated that there was a stigma wrongfully attached to sufferers of depression and that it was caused by a chemical imbalance , not a mental disease . He commented : " Pain must never be a source of shame . It 's a part of life , it 's part of humanity . " 
 Steiger died of pneumonia and complications from surgery for a gall bladder tumor on July 9 , 2002 , in Los Angeles , and was buried in Forest Lawn – Hollywood Hills Cemetery . The film Saving Shiloh , released in 2006 , was dedicated to his memory .

 Steiger was one of Hollywood 's most respected character actors ; Hutchinson described him as " one of Hollywood 's most charismatic and dynamic stars " . Yet for Hutchinson , Steiger remained " out of sympathy with Hollywood " during his career , believing that accomplished actors often struggle to find challenging films as they got older . Steiger was an " effusive talent " according to Lucia Bozzola of The New York Times , and was particularly noted for his intense portrayal of offbeat , often volatile and crazed characters . After On the Waterfront ( 1954 ) , Steiger became somewhat typecast for playing tough characters and villains , and grew increasingly frustrated playing the " Mafia heavy or a near @-@ psychopath " during the 1970s , roles which he could play menacingly , but provided little opportunity for him to showcase his talent . Gossip columnist Louella Parsons hailed him as " the Screen 's No.1 Bad Man " , while the newspaper London Evening News referred to him as " the man you would love to hate if you had the coverage " . A 1960 publication by Dean Jennings of The Saturday Evening Post referred to Steiger as an " angry , hot @-@ tempered newcomer of prodigious acting talents , [ who ] works best only at emotional white heat " , and remarked that he found it " stimulating to carry theatrical fantasy into his private life " . Pauline Kael found his performances so powerful that she believed he " often seems to take over a picture even when he isn 't in the lead " . The journal Films and Filming , surveying his career in 1971 , noted that his talent " developed steadily through films good and bad " , and that the secret of his success was that he stayed grounded , citing a 1956 interview where he said " I pity the player who can 't keep his feet on the ground . It 's too easy to trade on success and forget that no performer can stand still . " 
 A product of the Actors Studio , Steiger is closely associated with method acting , embodying the characters he played . Writer James F. Scott notes that during his career , he " many times put aside his own personality to think his way into an alien psyche " . Steiger once said : 
 " I don 't like the term Method , but for the sake of argument method acting is a means to an end . It is something that helps you get involved in the part personally so that you can communicate with the audience . No matter what , the American actor of the fifties changed acting the world over . Montgomery Clift was perhaps the actor who started it , Brando caused the sensation and [ James ] Dean made it a cult " . 
 Steiger was so devoted to his craft that during the 1970s he turned to many foreign productions , especially in Italy , to obtain the sort of roles he desired , but often clashed with directors over his method acting techniques . In one of his last interviews , Steiger said : " What is the greatest thing an artist in any profession can give to a person ? — that would be a constructive , warm memory . Because that gets into your brain and therefore into your life , so to speak . And that 's it , when somebody says to me ' I 'll never forget ' , that 's worth more to me than five Academy Awards , I 'm in that person 's life " . 
 Film writer Paul Simpson notes how closely Steiger prepared for his roles , and how he " effortlessly " recreated the mannerisms of figures such as Mussolini , in a " compelling take on an enigmatic figure " . Judith Crist of New York Magazine , reviewing Duck , You Sucker ! , commented that Steiger was " totally without mannerisms , always with manner " , and noted that his " silences are stunningly effective " . Roger Ebert later echoed this statement , concurring that Steiger lacked mannerisms , writing , " When he gets a character worth playing with , he creates it new from the bottom up , out of whole cloth . I don 't know how he does it . It 's almost as if he gets inside the skin of the guy he 's playing and starts being that person for a while " . Steiger said : " I always tried to do things different . If I got a role which was similar to another I 'd try to do it a little different . " His explosive screen performances were an influence on many later actors , including Robert De Niro , who used Steiger 's portrayal of Al Capone as a reference for his own performance in The Untouchables ( 1987 ) . Elvis Presley was highly impressed with Steiger 's " powerful and wrenching performance " in The Pawnbroker . 
 Despite Steiger 's acclaim as an actor , he was frequently accused of overacting and won his fair share of critics , particularly during the 1970s and 1980s . His acting was so dynamic at times that critics found him excessive and overbearing , and even uncomfortable or laughable to watch . Steiger once clashed with Armenian director Rouben Mamoulian , during a theatrical production of Oklahoma ! , as he was intolerant of Steiger 's " unusual acting technique " . Steiger ignored the director 's concerns that he was mumbling his lines , and when he began chomping loudly on an apple during a scene with Gordon MacRae , Mamoulian exclaimed : " Get out of my theater . Get out of my life ! " , and fired him . Even Kazan found several of the Actors Studio 's techniques disagreeable , preferring " more humor and verve and less self @-@ indulgence , self @-@ pity and self @-@ awareness " . Kazan felt that Steiger often displayed a competitive edge as an actor and tried to steal scenes from his co @-@ stars . Steiger rejected these claims , insisting that he was merely " trying to take the medium of acting to as far as I can go , and that why I sometimes go over the edge " . 
 Several co @-@ stars found Steiger difficult ; Warren Oates , according to director Norman Jewison , viewed Steiger as " somebody who had a tendency to go over the top " during the making of In The Heat of the Night . Writer Richard Dyer highlights the contrast in the film between the acting styles of Steiger and Poitier , with " Poitier 's stillness and implied intensity " and " Steiger 's busy , <unk> method acting " . Humphrey Bogart , Steiger 's co @-@ star of The Harder They Fall , referred to Steiger 's method acting as the " scratch @-@ your @-@ ass @-@ and @-@ mumble school of acting " . Director Robert Aldrich notes that Steiger had a habit of changing his lines , which often confused his co @-@ stars . Aldrich stated : " Usually I lie awake at nights trying to think of ways to improve an actor 's performance . With Steiger , the problem is to try and contain him " . Steiger was particularly aggressive towards director Kenneth Annakin during the making of Across the Bridge , insisting on rewriting most of the script and changing many of the lines to better fit Steiger 's idea of the character . Annakin stated that he had " never known an actor to put so much thought and preparation into a performance " as Steiger . Hutchinson revealed that Steiger often suffered from panic during filming and that fear of failure haunted him throughout his life , but fear also provided him with a source of strength in his acting .

 = Live to Tell = 
 " Live to Tell " is a song by American singer Madonna from her third studio album True Blue ( 1986 ) . Originally composed by Patrick Leonard for the score of the film Fire with Fire , the song was shown to Madonna , who decided to use it for then @-@ husband Sean Penn 's film At Close Range . Madonna wrote the song 's lyrics and co @-@ produced it with Leonard . The song was released as the lead single from True Blue on March 26 , 1986 by Sire Records . It later appeared on compilation albums The Immaculate Collection ( 1990 ) , Something to Remember ( 1995 ) , and Celebration ( 2009 ) . 
 A pop ballad , the song includes instrumentation from guitars , keyboards , drums and a synthesizer , and its lyrics deal with deceit , mistrust and childhood scars . It is also about being strong , which Madonna recalled in an interview that she thought about her relationship with her parents , while writing the lyrics . The music video , directed by James Foley , shows Madonna 's first image makeover , featuring her with a cleaner look , shoulder @-@ length wavy golden blond hair , conservative wardrobe and subtle make @-@ up . This toned down blond appearance was again inspired by Marilyn Monroe . 
 " Live to Tell " was generally well received by music critics , who frequently referred to it as the best ballad of her career . It was also a commercial success , becoming Madonna 's third number @-@ one single on the Billboard Hot 100 and her first number @-@ one on the Adult Contemporary chart . The song faced controversy when Madonna performed it on her 2006 Confessions Tour wearing a crown of thorns while hanging on a giant mirrored cross . The performance at Rome 's Olympic Stadium was condemned as an act of hostility toward the Roman Catholic Church by religious leaders .

 After Madonna finished The Virgin Tour , she asked producers Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray to write some songs with her and produce her third studio album , True Blue ( 1986 ) . " Live to Tell " was originally composed by Leonard for the score of Paramount 's romantic drama film Fire with Fire . " My managers represented the guy who was directing the film ; it was his first film . I saw a little piece of the film , and I had the script . I wrote a theme and I said , ' What if I could get Madonna to write the lyrics for it ? ' " , said Leonard . 
 However , Paramount rejected the song , believing that Leonard was incapable of creating the score for the film . It was then that Leonard presented the track to Madonna . She decided to use it for At Close Range , the new film of her then @-@ husband , actor Sean Penn . Madonna wrote the lyrics of the song <unk> , and made a demo recording on a cassette . She presented the song to the film 's director James Foley , who after hearing the track , decided to enlist Leonard as the person to write the score for the film , as per suggestions by Madonna . 
 Leonard was working with Michael Jackson , on some transcriptions for his Bad album , when Penn called him at the home of Foley . There he got to know that Madonna had suggested he write the score for At Close Range , and had also asked who was going to sing " Live to Tell " , since the song was written from a man 's perspective . Leonard , although he had initially envisioned a male voice interpreting the song , decided to use Madonna as the main vocalist and used the demo version as the main vocal with backup drums only . He later recalled that " it was so innocent and so shy . It 's as naive , as raw , as raw can be and that 's part of what gave it all its charm . " In a 1986 interview , Madonna said that the mood on the song was inspired by a different facet of her image makeover and her desire to focus on something different . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Live to Tell " is a pop ballad , with background instrumentation from a keyboard , a synthesizer , a funk guitar and a mix of synthesized and real drumming . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing , the song is written in the key of F major , is set in common time and moves at a moderate tempo of 112 beats per minute . The song starts with an instrumental introduction , performed by a synthesizer with the bass pedals set on D minor . Then the key suddenly changes to its relative major , F. 
 Madonna 's vocal range spans two octaves , from G3 to G5 . As she begins to sing the first verse , the bass pedal changes to C major , changes back to F during the chorus , and back to D minor during the chorus closure . This process is repeated during the second verse and chorus , which abruptly ends in a silence , with only the low and lifeless sound of the synthesizer , set in D minor . Madonna then starts to sing the bridge ( or middle part ) — " If I ran away , I 'd never have the strength " — between the tonal keys of D and F , closing with the repetition of the chorus until the song gradually fades out . The original composition of the song did not have the background synths , instead Leonard created a basic structure on piano , and Madonna added the words on top of that melody . According to Leonard , Madonna came up with the bridge by herself , extending it from the music that he was playing . 
 Lyrically , " Live to Tell " portrays the complexity of deceit and mistrust . The song is also about childhood scars and had an extreme emotional pitch . According to the book The Heart of Rock & Soul by Dave Marsh , the archetype of songs like " Live to Tell " is The Platters ' song " The Great Pretender " . In an interview about the song , Madonna said , " I thought about my relationship with my parents and the lying that went on . The song is about being strong , and questioning whether you can be that strong but ultimately surviving . "

 " Live to Tell " was generally well received by music critics . In a review of the album True Blue , Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic called it a " tremendous ballad that rewrites the rules of adult contemporary crossover " . Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly called the song " her best ballad to date " . In a review of her compilation album The Immaculate Collection , David Browne from the same magazine called it " one of her few successful shots at being a balladeer " . Alfred Soto from Stylus Magazine felt that " the song 's set of lyrics remain her best " and that the vocals " seethes with a lifetime 's worth of hurts which she nevertheless refuses to share " . Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called the song " striking " adding that it " rewrote the rules of what a pop song was supposed to sound like " . Edna Gundersen from USA Today called the song " a moody heart @-@ <unk> , may be her best song ever . " 
 Adam Sexton , author of Desperately Seeking Madonna : In Search Of The Meaning Of The World 's Most Famous Woman , felt that " Live to Tell " made a provocative companion to " Papa Don 't Preach " , the second single from the album . He added that " Madonna appropriately measured the safety of silence against the urge to unburden herself . " Sexton also complimented the production , saying that the " music itself suggests a threatened annihilation , a fact that makes it more haunting . " Allen Metz and Carol Benson , authors of The Madonna Companion : Two Decades of Commentary , felt that the track expanded Madonna 's musical horizons . According to them " Live to Tell " was a compelling track which Madonna sang with moving conviction . J. Randy Taraborrelli , author of Madonna : An Intimate Biography , was pleased with the track , denoting it as a vehicle of growth for Madonna . Erica Wexler from Spin , while reviewing True Blue , called " Live to Tell " as " dark and moody , dense with dramatic mystery . In this mushy tale of lost innocence , Madonna very theatrically conveys a lost fatalism . Her fragile voice aches for reassurance and healing when she sings ' Will it grow cold ? The secret that I hide , Will I grow old ? " Rolling Stone called the song " as cutting as it is melancholic " and said that it was " arguably [ Madonna 's ] finest and most distinctive ballad . "

 " Live to Tell " was released in the United States in March 1986 .

The song was a crossover success , topping the Adult Contemporary chart for three weeks , and peaking at number three on the Hot Dance Singles Sales chart . In Canada the song debuted at number 79 of the RPM singles chart in April 1986 , and reached the top of the chart for two weeks in May 1986 , staying on the chart for a total of 23 weeks , It was ranked at the second position of the 1986 RPM Singles year @-@ end chart . The single also peaked at number 1 on the CHUM Chart on May 24 , 1986 , and became its final number @-@ one single . 
 In the United Kingdom , " Live to Tell " was released on April 21 , 1986 . The next week , the song debuted at number ten on the UK Singles Chart , peaked at number two , and stayed 13 weeks on the chart . It was held from the top spot by Falco 's " Rock Me Amadeus " .

 In December 1985 , Madonna starred in the film Shanghai Surprise , where she toned down her appearance , inspired again by Marilyn Monroe . Madonna held the look for the " Live to Tell " video . In it her make @-@ up was pale and subtle , her shoulder @-@ length hair was wavy and golden blond , and her clothes consisted of a simple 1930s @-@ style floral dress . In an interview with music critic Stephen Holden from The New York Times , she commented about her new look : 
 " After a while I got sick of wearing tons of jewelry — I wanted to clean myself off . I see my new look as very innocent and feminine and unadorned . It makes me feel good . Growing up , I admired the kind of beautiful glamorous woman — from Brigitte Bardot to Grace Kelly — who doesn 't seem to be around much anymore . I think it 's time for that kind of glamor to come back . In pop music generally , people have one image . You get pigeonholed . I 'm lucky enough to be able to change and still be accepted . If you think about it , that 's what they do in the movies ; play a part , change characters , looks and attitudes . I guess I do it to entertain myself . " 
 In addition to At Close Range , Foley also directed the song 's video . David Naylor and Sharon <unk> were in charge of the production . The video serves as a publicity campaign for the movie , as it includes brief scenes of the film that indicate the conflict the young man in the movie — played by Sean Penn — feels . 
 The locations in the film are separated visually from the shots of Madonna , who is singing in a darkened studio . Unlike her previous videos , Madonna portrays a narrator , whose song comments on the story , appearing in shots completely different from the narrative action . She appears to speak for the character , addressing his problems directly , like the chorus of a classical tragedy . 
 = = Live performances = = 
 Madonna premiered the song at a benefit concert at Madison Square Garden to raise money for medical research for AIDS . She dedicated the song to the memory of her friend , artist Michael Burgoyne . Madonna has since performed the song on three of her world tours . In 1987 , during the Who 's That Girl World Tour , she performed the song standing motionless in a single spotlight , wearing a black ensemble with tassels , golden tips and ribbing , designed by Marlene Stewart . Two different performances of the song on this tour can be found on the videos : Who 's That Girl : Live in Japan , filmed in Tokyo , Japan , on June 22 , 1987 , and Ciao Italia : Live from Italy , filmed in Turin , Italy , on September 4 , 1987 . 
 Three years later on her Blond Ambition World Tour , Madonna evoked Catholic images during the performance . She wore a black kaftan and a neon crucifix , while singing on a confession bench , with Roman columns and a platform full of votive candles in the background . Two different performances were taped and released on video , the Blond Ambition Japan Tour 90 , taped in Yokohama , Japan , on April 27 , 1990 , and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live , taped in Nice , France , on August 5 , 1990 . 
 Madonna 's performance of the song was the subject of controversy during the 2006 Confessions Tour . She was raised from the floor hanging on a mirrored cross wearing a red blouse and velvet pants , with a crown of Thorns on her head . During the performance , the number 12 million flashed above her on the stage 's backdrop screens , along with images of African children . This was intended to detail the estimated number of children who have been orphaned by the AIDS pandemic in Africa . 
 German prosecutors in Düsseldorf threatened to sue her for blasphemy , and Protestant bishop Margot <unk> said that " maybe the only way an aging superstar can attract attention is to offend people 's religious sentiments . " The Russian Orthodox Church and the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia ( <unk> ) described Madonna 's performance as amoral , and urged all members to boycott her upcoming concert in Moscow . The performance at Rome 's Olympic Stadium — located near the Vatican — was condemned as an act of hostility toward the Roman Catholic Church by religious leaders . Italian cardinal <unk> <unk> called the concert " a blasphemous challenge to the faith " and a " profanation of the cross " , also calling for Madonna to be excommunicated . Reverend Manfredo Leone described it as " disrespectful , in bad taste and provocative " . 
 Muslim and Jewish leaders also criticized the performance . Mario <unk> , the head of Italy 's Muslim League commented " I think her idea is in the worst taste and she 'd do better to go home . " Riccardo <unk> , the spokesman for Rome 's Jewish community said " It 's a disrespectful act , and to do it in Rome is even worse . " Madonna released a statement about the controversy : 
 I am very grateful that my show was so well received all over the world . But there seems to be many misinterpretations about my appearance on the cross and I wanted to explain it myself once and for all . 
 There is a segment in my show where three of my dancers ' confess ' or share harrowing experiences from their childhood that they ultimately overcame . My ' confession ' follows and takes place on a Crucifix that I ultimately come down from . This is not a mocking of the church . It is no different than a person wearing a Cross or ' Taking Up the Cross ' as it says in the Bible . My performance is neither anti @-@ Christian , sacrilegious or blasphemous . Rather , it is my plea to the audience to encourage mankind to help one another and to see the world as a unified whole . I believe in my heart that if Jesus were alive today he would be doing the same thing . 
 My specific intent is to bring attention to the millions of children in Africa who are dying every day , and are living without care , without medicine and without hope . I am asking people to open their hearts and minds to get involved in whatever way they can . The song ends with a quote from the Bible 's Book of Matthew : ' For I was hungry and you gave me food . I was naked and you gave me clothing . I was sick and you took care of me and God replied , " Whatever you did for the least of my brothers ... you did it to me.' 
 Please do not pass judgement without seeing my show .

 Eduard <unk> Streltsov ( Russian : <unk> ́ <unk> <unk> ́ <unk> <unk> ́ в ; IPA : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> ] , 21 July 1937 – 22 July 1990 ) was a footballer from the Soviet Union who played as a forward for Torpedo Moscow and the Soviet national team during the 1950s and 1960s . A powerful and skilful attacking player , he scored the fourth @-@ highest number of goals for the Soviet Union and has been called " the greatest outfield player Russia has ever produced " . He is sometimes dubbed " the Russian Pelé " . 
 Born and raised in east Moscow , Streltsov joined Torpedo at the age of 16 in 1953 and made his international debut two years later . He was part of the squad that won the gold medal at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics , and came seventh in the 1957 Ballon d 'Or . Early the next year his promising career was interrupted by a rape scandal . The 20 @-@ year @-@ old Streltsov was accused of raping a woman shortly before the 1958 World Cup ; told he could still play if he admitted his guilt , he confessed , despite inconclusive evidence against him . He was instead convicted and sentenced to twelve years in the Gulag system of forced labour camps . 
 Streltsov was released after five years in the camps and in 1965 he resumed his career with Torpedo Moscow . In the first season of his comeback , the club won the Soviet championship ; in 1968 Torpedo won the Soviet Cup . Streltsov was restored to the Soviet national team in 1966 , and in 1967 and 1968 named Soviet Footballer of the Year . By the time of his retirement in 1970 he had pioneered innovations such as the back @-@ heeled pass , which became known in Russia as " Streltsov 's pass " . He died in Moscow in 1990 . Six years later , Torpedo renamed their home ground " Eduard Streltsov Stadium " in his honour . In the 21st century , statues of Streltsov stand outside the stadium bearing his name and the Luzhniki Olympic Complex in Moscow . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Eduard <unk> Streltsov was born in <unk> , an eastern district of Moscow , on 21 July 1937 , the son of Anatoly Streltsov , a front @-@ line soldier and intelligence officer , and Sofia <unk> . Anatoly did not return to the family following the Second World War , instead choosing to settle alone in Kiev ; Sofia therefore raised her son on her own , working at the Fraser Cutting Instruments Factory to support Eduard and herself . As a result , Streltsov had a modest upbringing , the highlights of which were playing football and following his favoured team , Spartak Moscow . 
 The factory recognised his talent from a young age : Streltsov became the Fraser Factory football team 's youngest ever player when he was 13 years old . Three years later in 1953 , a friendly match was organised between Fraser and a youth team from Torpedo Moscow . Streltsov impressed the Torpedo coach , Vasily <unk> , and after befriending him , left Fraser to play for Torpedo .

 = = = Early career = = = 
 Aged 16 , Streltsov made his debut for Torpedo during the 1954 season , appeared in every league game and scored four goals . The team finished ninth in the league , a drop from third the previous year . In his second season Streltsov was the league 's most prolific goalscorer , scoring 15 goals in 22 games as his side rose to fourth place . Streltsov was selected for the Soviet national team for the first time in 1955 , halfway through the season ; his debut came in a friendly match against Sweden in Stockholm on 26 June , when he scored a hat @-@ trick within the first 45 minutes as the Swedish team was defeated 6 – 0 . On his second appearance , a friendly home game against India , he scored three goals again . A further game in Hungary and a goal against France meant that by the start of 1956 , Streltsov had scored seven goals for the Soviet Union in four matches . After scoring in a match against Denmark in April 1956 , he missed three international matches before returning in September with a goal after three minutes in a 2 – 1 away victory over West Germany . Streltsov continued to score regularly for Torpedo , managing 12 league goals during the 1956 season , but appeared in two successive defeats for the Soviets before they travelled in November 1956 to the Olympic Games in Melbourne . Streltsov scored three goals in a 16 – 2 victory over Australia in an unofficial match on 15 November before scoring a late winning goal in the first tournament match against the Unified Team of Germany nine days later . The Soviets required a replay to overcome Indonesia in the quarter @-@ finals and met Bulgaria in the semi @-@ final . 
 The match finished 0 – 0 after 90 minutes , and with defender Nikolai Tishchenko and Streltsov 's fellow Torpedo forward Valentin Ivanov both injured , the Soviet team had only nine fit players when Bulgaria scored early in extra time . Streltsov 's performance was later described by journalist Jonathan Wilson as " magnificent " ; he scored an equaliser after 112 minutes and then set up Boris Tatushin of Spartak Moscow four minutes later to score the winning goal . Streltsov missed the final against Yugoslavia as the team manager , Gavriil Kachalin , believed the two forward players should be club team @-@ mates ; as Ivanov was unfit , Streltsov was dropped as well . Nikita Simonyan , who took his place , offered Streltsov his gold medal following a 1 – 0 victory over the Yugoslavs , an offer which the Torpedo player refused , saying " Nikita , I will win many other trophies " . Streltsov received two votes in that year 's Ballon d 'Or . 
 Streltsov scored the first goal in a 2 – 0 win in a World Cup qualifying play @-@ off match in Poland which meant the Soviet Union qualified for the 1958 World Cup . At club level , he scored 12 goals in 15 league matches during the 1957 season . Torpedo , never league champions and traditionally overshadowed by local rivals such as CSKA , Dynamo and Spartak , finished as runners @-@ up of the Soviet Top League . At the end of that season , Streltsov came seventh in the 1957 Ballon d 'Or , gaining 12 votes ; by the start of the World Cup year , 1958 , his international record stood at 18 goals in 20 games . Streltsov scored five goals in the first eight league matches of the 1958 Top League season , and appeared in a 1 – 1 friendly draw with England in Moscow on 18 May 1958 .

 Streltsov was known for womanising , drinking heavily and leading an extravagant life outside of football , as well as for wearing his hair in the British " Teddy Boy " style . As a key player for his club and for the Soviet national side , these traits combined to create an impression in government circles that , in Wilson 's words , " Streltsov was becoming rather too much of a celebrity " . The problem was brought to a head by an alleged relationship between the footballer and Svetlana Furtseva , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old daughter of the first female Politburo member Ekaterina Furtseva . With the young Svetlana besotted by the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Torpedo forward , her mother first met him at a Kremlin ball held early in 1957 to celebrate the Olympic victory of 1956 . Furtseva suggested he might marry her daughter , to which Streltsov replied " I already have a fiancée and I will not marry her [ Svetlana ] . " While drunk , he was later heard to remark either " I would never marry that monkey " or " I would rather be hanged than marry such a girl " ( both quotes were reported ) , humiliating Furtseva , a minister close to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev . 
 Streltsov became secretly engaged to Alla <unk> before leaving for the Olympics , and the couple married on 25 February 1957 , halfway through preparations for the Soviet season . The Department of Soviet Football criticised both the player and his club over the timing of the ceremony . The Communist Party also seemed to distrust him , considering him a possible defector after he attracted the interest of French and Swedish clubs during tours overseas with Torpedo . His file in the party archives included the comment : " [ a ] <unk> to a verified source , Streltsov said to his friends in 1957 that he was always sorry to return to the USSR after trips abroad . " After he was sent off during a game in Odessa in April 1957 , the official government sports newspaper Sovetsky Sport published an article about him titled " This is not a hero " as well as letters purportedly written by members of the proletariat , which described Streltsov as an " example of the evils of western imperialism " . 
 A week after appearing against England in a warm @-@ up match in Moscow for the 1958 World Cup , Streltsov was invited to a party by a Soviet military officer , Eduard <unk> , to be held on 25 May . Streltsov and the rest of the Soviet squad were on a pre @-@ World Cup training camp at <unk> , just outside Moscow , but the team had been given the day as holiday . At the end of such days , the players had to report to the authorities at Dynamo Stadium at 4 : 30 pm , but Streltsov and two team @-@ mates , Spartak players Mikhail Ogonkov and Boris Tatushin , ignored this rule and went to the party anyway . Held at <unk> 's dacha , it was also attended by a 20 @-@ year @-@ old woman named Marina Lebedeva , whom Streltsov had never met . The following morning , Streltsov , Ogonkov and Tatushin were all arrested and charged with raping her . 
 Journalist Kevin O 'Flynn writes that since heavy drinking had taken place at the party , the evidence against Streltsov was " confused and contradictory " , even from Lebedeva herself . But the Soviet team coach , Gavriil Kachalin , claimed shortly before Streltsov 's death that influence from high up in the Communist Party dictated that the player could not be helped ; Kachalin said that police told him of Khrushchev 's personal involvement , fuelled by a grudge held by Furtseva . According to Soviet Union team @-@ mate Nikita Simonyan , speaking in 2006 , Streltsov wrote home to his mother " saying he was taking the blame for someone else " . Streltsov and Lebedeva did sleep together , Simonyan said , and he did not believe their meeting had been set up , but he was unsure about whether or not Streltsov had raped her . Simonyan proposed that consensual sex could have been twisted into a rape accusation by " the system " , which he said bore ill will towards the Torpedo forward . However , in the same interview Simonyan revealed incriminating photographs of both Lebedeva and Streltsov from the time of the trial , including one in which the Torpedo player 's face " was streaked from nose to cheekbone with three parallel scratches " . " [ T ] here is the possibility that the photographs were doctored or the injuries inflicted at a later date " , Wilson comments , " but Soviet justice rarely required such damning evidence . " Streltsov 's wife of just over a year , Alla , filed for divorce soon after the accusations were made . Apart from Streltsov himself , the only members of the team present at his trial were Ogonkov and Tatushin , who appeared as witnesses . 
 = = = = Conviction ; the Gulag = = = = 
 Streltsov confessed to the crime after being told this would allow him to keep his place in the Soviet team for the 1958 World Cup . This did not happen , however ; far from remaining in the national side , Streltsov was sentenced to twelve years in the forced labour camps of the Gulag , and barred from ever returning to professional football of any kind . Plans for a march by 100 @,@ 000 workers at Moscow 's ZiL car factory , the base of the Torpedo club , to show support during the trial , were abandoned when Streltsov was sentenced before the march could be arranged . Ogonkov and Tatushin , meanwhile , were banned from playing any kind of organised football for three years , and barred from representing the USSR for life . In the camp where he was incarcerated , Streltsov was initially victimised by a young criminal who inflicted so much physical harm on him that he spent four months in the prison hospital , suffering from injuries caused by blows from either an " iron bar or a shoe heel " . Camp authorities later started to include Streltsov in football matches to calm down the inmates in times of trouble ; one prisoner , Ivan Lukyanov , later said : " [ w ] e loved Streltsov , we believed he would return to football . And not only us . " 
 Meanwhile , the Soviet team travelled to Sweden for the World Cup without Streltsov , Ogonkov or Tatushin . The world 's press claimed that two of the competing teams were severely weakened : England by the Munich air disaster , and the Soviets by the loss of Streltsov . The Soviets reached the quarter @-@ finals , losing 2 – 0 to hosts Sweden , a team defeated 6 – 0 by the Soviet Union during Streltsov 's 1955 debut . Without Streltsov , Torpedo dropped from their second @-@ place finish in 1957 to seventh in 1958 , though the team also reached the Soviet Cup final before losing to Spartak . Streltsov 's place as the club 's leading scorer was taken by the 21 @-@ year @-@ old forward Gennadi Gusarov , who had turned professional with Torpedo during 1957 . The team rose to fifth in 1959 before winning the Double of Top League and Cup during the following year , with Gusarov leading the league in goals with 20 . Torpedo then finished as runners @-@ up in both competitions in 1961 , with Gusarov scoring 22 . Two mid @-@ table finishes followed as Gusarov was sold to city rivals Dynamo between the 1962 and 1963 seasons , but Torpedo once again came second in 1964 , losing a championship play @-@ off against Dinamo Tbilisi after the two clubs finished equal on points .

 Streltsov was released on 4 February 1963 , five years into his twelve @-@ year sentence , and owing to the ban from professional play began to split his time between work at the ZiL factory and the study of automotive engineering at the attached technical college . After failing to patch up his differences with Alla , he married Raisa <unk> in September 1963 . He started to play for the amateur factory team , which caused it to attract large crowds , both at home and away . When the ZiL side travelled to Gorky for an away match late in the 1964 season , the team 's coach received orders from above not to play Streltsov , something which spectators noticed immediately when the match started ; during the first half , they began to riot and threatened to burn down the stadium , chanting Streltsov 's name . Worried that the angry crowd might go through with this , the Gorky factory chief ordered the ZiL coach to send Streltsov out for the second half . On stepping onto the field , the former Gulag prisoner received a standing ovation . 
 With Streltsov in the team , ZiL topped the factory league after winning all 11 matches . Although he was not allowed to play for Torpedo , Streltsov attended matches at his old club throughout the season . In October 1964 , Khrushchev was replaced as the Communist Party 's First Secretary by Leonid Brezhnev , who shortly after taking office received a letter signed by tens of thousands of people , including heroes of Socialist Labour and national and regional Supreme Soviet members , requesting the reversal of Streltsov 's professional ban . Some party members were wary of a potential comeback , fearing that Streltsov 's inclusion in a Torpedo squad that regularly travelled to Western Europe could lead to an international incident , but Brezhnev repealed the ban , arguing that as a free man Streltsov should be able to use his trained profession . He was cleared to return to Torpedo before the 1965 season . 
 = = = = Return to professionalism = = = = 
 Streltsov was enthusiastically welcomed back by supporters . Although he had lost some of his strength and agility , his footballing intelligence was still intact ; his presence helped Torpedo to win the 1965 Soviet championship , with Streltsov scoring 12 goals from 26 league matches . At the end of the season , he came second in the voting for the Soviet Footballer of the Year behind Torpedo team @-@ mate Valery Voronin . It was the second time that Torpedo had won the league ; the club had won its first title five years earlier , during Streltsov 's imprisonment . Streltsov made his debut in continental club competition on 28 September 1966 , playing in a 1 – 0 defeat away to Inter Milan in the European Cup . He was recalled to the Soviet national team on 16 October 1966 in a 2 – 0 home defeat against Turkey , and scored the first international goal of his comeback a week later in a 2 – 2 draw with East Germany . An appearance in a 1 – 0 away defeat against Italy followed two weeks later . Torpedo reached the final of the Soviet Cup in 1966 , but lost 2 – 0 to Dynamo . Streltsov matched his previous seasonal tally of 12 league goals during the 1966 Top League season . 
 Streltsov successfully re @-@ established himself in the Soviet team over the following year , as he appeared in eight consecutive USSR matches , starting with a 2 – 0 friendly victory over Scotland in Glasgow in May 1967 . He scored two goals during this run in the national side : one each in a 4 – 2 win against France in Paris on 3 June 1967 and a 4 – 3 European Championship qualifying home victory over Austria eight days later . After losing his place for the 1968 European Championship qualifying match against Finland on 30 August 1967 , Streltsov missed three Soviet Union matches . He regained his place for an away friendly match against Bulgaria on 8 October , scoring a goal as the Soviets fought back from 1 – 0 to record a 2 – 1 win . He retained his place for the rest of the calendar year , and scored a hat @-@ trick away against Chile on 17 December . He was voted Soviet Footballer of the Year at the end of the season , although he scored a relatively low six league goals during 1967 , his lowest for a full season since his debut year of 1954 . 
 Streltsov was dropped from the Soviet team for the first three national team matches of 1968 . After featuring in a home friendly win over Belgium in April , he made his final appearance for the USSR in the 2 – 0 1968 European Championship quarter @-@ final first leg loss to Hungary on 4 May 1968 . The Soviets beat Hungary 3 – 0 in Moscow a week later , without Streltsov , to qualify for the final tournament on aggregate . Streltsov was left out of the tournament squad , and never played for the USSR again ; after his final appearance , his international tally stood at 25 goals in 38 matches . Torpedo won the Soviet Cup during the 1968 season , overcoming Uzbek side <unk> Tashkent 1 – 0 in the final . Streltsov retained his title of Soviet Footballer of the Year after scoring the highest seasonal total of his career , 21 ( in the league ) , but was moved back to midfield before the 1969 season and did not score in 23 league matches during his final two years . He retired from football in 1970 , at the age of 33 , leaving his final league record for Torpedo over both spells standing at 99 goals from 222 games . 
 = = Post @-@ retirement career = = 
 Following a footballing career spent exclusively with Torpedo , Streltsov , a supporter of Spartak Moscow , repeatedly complained about his failure to play for his favourite team . After his retirement , Torpedo continued to pay his salary to fund his study of football coaching at the Institute of Physical Culture . Streltsov returned to Torpedo in the capacity of youth team manager following his qualification ; he also spent a brief spell as manager of the first team before returning to the youth team in 1982 . He also took part in matches contested by former players before dying in 1990 from throat cancer , which his first wife Alla later claimed had been brought about by irradiated food served to him in the camps . Seven years later , Marina Lebedeva , the woman Streltsov had confessed to raping , was seen laying flowers at his grave in Moscow on the day after the anniversary of his death . 
 Olympic policy in 1956 was to award gold medals only to members of the winning football squad who had played in the final match . Since Streltsov did not play in the final , he did not receive a medal . He was posthumously given a gold medal in 2006 , after this policy was changed retroactively to allow all members of winning Olympic squads to receive medals . 
 = = Style of play and legacy = = 
 Many critics consider Streltsov to be one of the finest footballers ever from Russia or the Soviet Union : British journalist and author Jonathan Wilson describes him as " the greatest outfield player Russia has ever produced ... a tall , powerful forward , possessed of a fine first touch and extraordinary footballing intelligence " , while Russian author Aleksandr <unk> writes that " the boy came to us from the land of wonder " . Streltsov 's skilful , innovative style of play helped him to stand out in Soviet football , and his pioneering of the back @-@ heeled pass resulted in it becoming known in Russia as " Streltsov 's pass " . During his early career , this technical ability combined with considerable speed and physical presence to create a formidable all @-@ round forward player . In his later years , with his physical attributes reduced , he emphasised his skill and on @-@ field intelligence to become more of a playmaker , playing further back and setting up attacking moves for team @-@ mates rather than leading them himself . Indeed , for his final two seasons , Streltsov played in an attacking midfield role rather than up front . Despite the eight @-@ year gap between his two spells as a member of the Soviet national team , Streltsov , nicknamed " The Russian Pelé " , was the fourth highest international goalscorer in the country 's history . 
 Torpedo Moscow 's ground , Torpedo Stadium , was redubbed the " Eduard Streltsov Stadium " in 1996 . A year later , the Russian Football Union introduced the <unk> prizes as the most prestigious individual honours in Russian football , awarded annually to the best manager in the Russian league and the best players in each position until discontinued in 2003 . A statue of Streltsov was constructed within Moscow 's Luzhniki Olympic Complex in 1998 , and another was erected by Torpedo outside the stadium bearing his name during the following year . 
 The Streltsov Committee , formed in 2001 , was founded to attempt to have Streltsov 's conviction of rape posthumously overturned . The campaign 's leader , chess champion Anatoly Karpov , claimed in 2001 that the conviction had prevented Streltsov from becoming the world 's best player . The Central Bank of the Russian Federation paid tribute to Streltsov in 2010 , when it minted a commemorative two @-@ ruble coin bearing his likeness . The coin was one of three minted as part of the " Outstanding Sportsmen of Russia " series ; the other two pieces bore the faces of footballers Lev Yashin and Konstantin <unk> , respectively .

 The Doctor Who missing episodes are the portions of the long @-@ running British science @-@ fiction television programme Doctor Who no longer held by the BBC . Between 1967 and 1978 the BBC routinely deleted archive programmes , for various practical reasons ( lack of space , scarcity of materials , a lack of rebroadcast rights ) . As a result of the cull , 97 of 253 episodes from the programme 's first six years are currently missing , primarily from seasons 3 through 5 , leaving 26 serials incomplete . Many more were considered lost until recovered from various sources , mostly overseas broadcasters . 
 Doctor Who is not unique in its losses , as many broadcasters regularly cleared their archives in this manner . Until the BBC changed its archiving policy in 1978 , thousands of hours of programming , in all genres , were deleted . Other affected BBC series include Dad 's Army , Z @-@ Cars , The Wednesday Play , Steptoe and Son , and Not Only ... But Also . ITV regional franchises also deleted many programmes , including early videotaped episodes of The Avengers . 
 Doctor Who is unusual , however , in that each of its 97 missing episodes survives in audio form , recorded off @-@ air by fans at home . Most episodes are also represented by stills or short video clips . Furthermore , after careful restoration , all 1970s episodes exist in full colour , which is not always the case for other series . 
 Efforts to locate missing episodes continue , both by the BBC and by fans of the series . Recovered episodes have been extensively restored for release on VHS and DVD ; surviving soundtracks have been released on cassette and CD . Many missing episodes have had their visuals reconstructed , either through specially commissioned animation or use of surviving footage and photographs . 
 = = Background = = 
 Between approximately 1967 and 1978 , large quantities of videotape and film stored in the BBC 's Engineering department and film libraries , respectively , were wiped or destroyed to make way for newer programmes . This happened for several reasons , primarily the belief that there was no practical value to its retention . 
 The actors ' union Equity had actively fought against the introduction of TV recording since the 1950s , when it first became a practical proposition . Prior to the development of workable television recording , if a broadcaster wished to repeat a programme ( usually a one @-@ off play ) , they had to re @-@ hire the actors to perform it again , live , for additional fees . Equity 's concern was that if broadcasters kept recordings of the original performances , they would be able to re @-@ broadcast them indefinitely , which would reduce the amount of new production and threaten the livelihoods of its members . Although Equity could not prevent recording altogether , it added standard clauses to its members ' contracts that stipulated that recordings could only be repeated a limited number of times within a specific timeframe , and deliberately set the fees for further use so high that broadcasters would consider it unjustifiable to spend so much money repeating an old programme rather than making a new one . Consequently , recordings whose repeat rights had expired were considered to be of no further domestic use to the broadcasters . 
 Most Doctor Who episodes were made on two @-@ inch videotape for initial broadcast and then telerecorded onto 16 mm film by BBC Enterprises for further commercial exploitation . Enterprises used 16 mm for overseas sales as it was considerably cheaper to buy and easier to transport than videotape . It also circumvented the problem of different countries ' incompatible video standards , as film was a universal medium whereas videotape was not . The BBC had no central archive at the time ; the Film Library kept programmes that had been made on film , while the Engineering Department was responsible for storing videotapes . BBC Enterprises only kept copies of programmes they deemed commercially exploitable . They had little dedicated storage space , and tended to place piles of film canisters wherever they could find space for them at their Villiers House property . 
 The Engineering Department had no mandate to archive the programme videotapes they held , although typically they would not be wiped or junked until the relevant production department or BBC Enterprises indicated that they had no further use for the tapes . The first Doctor Who master videotapes to be junked were those for the serial The Highlanders , which were erased on 9 March 1967 , a mere two months after Episode 4 's original transmission . Further erasing and junking of Doctor Who master videotapes by the Engineering Department continued into the 1970s . Eventually , every master videotape of the programme 's first 253 episodes ( 1963 – 69 ) was destroyed or wiped . The final 1960s master tapes to be erased were those for the 1968 serial Fury from the Deep , in late 1974 . 
 Despite the destruction of these masters , BBC Enterprises held a near @-@ complete archive of the series in the form of their 16 mm film telerecording copies until approximately 1972 . From around 1972 to 1978 , BBC Enterprises also disposed of much of their older material , including many episodes of Doctor Who . 
 = = = The purge of the archives = = = 
 Enterprises ' episodes were usually junked because their rights agreements with the actors and writers to sell the programmes abroad had expired . With many broadcasters around the world now switching to colour transmission , it was not deemed worthwhile extending agreements to sell the older black @-@ and @-@ white material . 
 The BBC Film Library , meanwhile , had no responsibility for storing programmes that had not originated on film , and there were conflicting views between the Film Library and BBC Enterprises over which party held the responsibility for archiving programmes . As each body believed it the other 's responsibility to archive the material , each thought nothing of destroying its own copies as necessary . This lack of communication contributed to the erasure of much of the Corporation 's film archive of older black @-@ and @-@ white programming . While thousands of other programmes have been destroyed in this way around the world , the missing Doctor Who episodes are probably the best @-@ known example of how the lack of a consistent programme archiving policy risks permanent loss . 
 Following the purges and subsequent recoveries , gaps in the Doctor Who archive are spread unevenly through its first eleven seasons . Major losses mostly affect First and Second Doctor serials ; although two stories are missing just one episode each ( The Tenth Planet , Episode 4 and The Web of Fear Episode 3 ) , other stories are lost altogether . Patrick Troughton 's era as the Second Doctor is particularly affected ; of the fourteen stories comprising his first two seasons , only The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Enemy of the World are complete , and these only exist due to telerecordings later returned from Hong Kong and Nigeria , respectively . 
 All stories starring Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor are complete , though many episodes no longer survive on their original videotapes and have needed to be restored to colour using other methods . In order of original transmissions , the very last Doctor Who master videotapes to be wiped were the first episodes of the 1974 serials Invasion of the Dinosaurs and Death to the Daleks . The latter was recovered from overseas , initially from a tape in the NTSC format , and later in the original PAL format on a tape returned from Dubai . 
 For four years , Episode 1 of Invasion of the Dinosaurs was the only Pertwee episode to be entirely missing from the archives , until a black @-@ and @-@ white 16 mm copy was returned to the Corporation in June 1983 . The story was released on DVD with a partially <unk> version of Episode 1 , alongside a higher @-@ quality monochrome transfer of the episode , in The UNIT Files box set . With one exception , archival holdings from Death to the Daleks Episode 2 onwards are complete on the original broadcast videotapes . 
 Unrelated to the regular archive purges , the final shot of The Deadly Assassin Episode 3 ( 1976 ) has been excised from the master copy . The shot was removed after its initial UK transmission , following complaints from Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers ' and Listeners ' Association . Subsequent repeats and commercial releases have restored the shot from off @-@ air video copies . 
 = = = The end of the <unk> = = = 
 Internally , the wiping policy officially came to an end in 1978 , when the means to further exploit programmes by taking advantage of the new market for home videocassette recordings started to become apparent . The prevailing view had also begun to shift toward the attitude that archive programmes should , in any case , be preserved for posterity and historical and cultural reasons . 
 The BBC Film Library was turned into a combined Film & Videotape Library for the preservation of both media . The Film Library at the time held only 47 episodes of 1960s Doctor Who ; they had once held 53 , but six episodes had either been junked or gone missing . <unk> at BBC Enterprises , however , continued until the intervention of Ian Levine , a record producer and fan of the programme . Following the transfer of episodes still held by Enterprises , there were 152 episodes of Doctor Who no longer held by the BBC , although subsequent efforts have reduced that number to 97 . 
 Arguably the most sought @-@ after lost episode is Episode 4 of the final William Hartnell serial , The Tenth Planet , which ends with the First Doctor 's regeneration into the Second . The only portion of the episode still in existence , bar a few poor @-@ quality silent 8mm clips , is the final 27 seconds , comprising the regeneration itself and a few seconds leading up to it . The sequence had been shown in a 1973 episode of Blue Peter , and was retained in that show 's archive . 
 Even after the end of the purge , other archive issues persist . Serials from Seasons 22 – 26 were shown in Germany , with soundtracks dubbed into German language ; some of these episodes no longer exist in German television archives . 
 = = = Continuing search = = = 
 On 20 April 2006 it was announced on Blue Peter that a life @-@ sized Dalek would be given to anyone who found and returned one of the missing episodes . 
 In January 2007 ITV began a campaign called " Raiders of the Lost Archive " and although the campaign was run by ITV , they were also looking to find Doctor Who episodes and other BBC shows . One episode of the Raiders of the Lost Archive show aired in January 2007 and a further two episodes in July 2009 . 
 In December 2012 the Radio Times listings magazine announced it was launching the hunt for more Doctor Who episodes , to tie @-@ in with the show 's 50th anniversary . The Radio Times issued its own list of missing episodes . The magazine has also set up an email address specifically for Doctor Who missing episodes that the public can use to contact it if they have any information .
