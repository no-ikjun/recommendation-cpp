 Uranium is extracted from its ores in various ways . In one method , the ore is burned and then reacted with nitric acid to convert uranium into a dissolved state . Treating the solution with a solution of tributyl phosphate ( <unk> ) in kerosene transforms uranium into an organic form UO2 ( NO3 ) 2 ( <unk> ) 2 . The insoluble impurities are filtered and the uranium is extracted by reaction with hydroxides as ( NH4 ) <unk> or with hydrogen peroxide as <unk> · 2H2O . 
 When the uranium ore is rich in such minerals as dolomite , magnesite , etc . , those minerals consume much acid . In this case , the carbonate method is used for uranium extraction . Its main component is an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate , which converts uranium into a complex [ UO2 ( CO3 ) 3 ] 4 − , which is stable in aqueous solutions at low concentrations of hydroxide ions . The advantages of the sodium carbonate method are that the chemicals have low corrosivity ( compared to nitrates ) and that most non @-@ uranium metals precipitate from the solution . The disadvantage is that tetravalent uranium compounds precipitate as well . Therefore , the uranium ore is treated with sodium carbonate at elevated temperature and under oxygen pressure : 
 2 UO2 + O2 + 6 CO2 − 
 3 → 2 [ UO2 ( CO3 ) 3 ] 4 − 
 This equation suggests that the best solvent for the uranium carbonate processing is a mixture of carbonate with bicarbonate . At high pH , this results in precipitation of diuranate , which is treated with hydrogen in the presence of nickel yielding an insoluble uranium <unk> . 
 Another separation method uses polymeric resins as a <unk> . Ion exchange processes in the resins result in separation of uranium . Uranium from resins is washed with a solution of ammonium nitrate or nitric acid that yields uranyl nitrate , UO2 ( NO3 ) 2 · 6H2O . When heated , it turns into UO3 , which is converted to UO2 with hydrogen : 
 UO3 + H2 → UO2 + H2O 
 Reacting uranium dioxide with fluoric acid changes it to uranium tetrafluoride , which yields uranium metal upon reaction with magnesium metal : 
 4 HF + UO2 → <unk> + 2 H2O 
 To extract plutonium , neutron @-@ irradiated uranium is dissolved in nitric acid , and a reducing agent ( FeSO4 , or H2O2 ) is added to the resulting solution . This addition changes the oxidation state of plutonium from + 6 to + 4 , while uranium remains in the form of uranyl nitrate ( UO2 ( NO3 ) 2 ) . The solution is treated with a reducing agent and neutralized with ammonium carbonate to pH = 
 8 that results in precipitation of Pu4 + compounds . 
 In another method , Pu4 + and UO2 + 
 2 are first extracted with tributyl phosphate , then reacted with hydrazine washing out the recovered plutonium . 
 The major difficulty in separation of actinium is the similarity of its properties with those of lanthanum . Thus actinium is either synthesized in nuclear reactions from isotopes of radium or separated using ion @-@ exchange procedures . 
 = = Properties = = 
 Actinides have similar properties to lanthanides . The 6d and 7s electronic shells are filled in actinium and thorium , and the 5f shell is being filled with further increase in atomic number ; the 4f shell is filled in the lanthanides . The first experimental evidence for the filling of the 5f shell in actinides was obtained by McMillan and Abelson in 1940 . As in lanthanides ( see lanthanide contraction ) , the ionic radius of actinides monotonically decreases with atomic number ( see also Aufbau principle ) . 
 = = = Physical properties = = = 
 Actinides are typical metals . All of them are soft and have a silvery color ( but tarnish in air ) , relatively high density and plasticity . Some of them can be cut with a knife . Their electrical resistivity varies between 15 and 150 µOhm · cm . The hardness of thorium is similar to that of soft steel , so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire . Thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium , but is harder than either of them . All actinides are radioactive , paramagnetic , and , with the exception of actinium , have several crystalline phases : plutonium has seven , and uranium , neptunium and californium three . The crystal structures of protactinium , uranium , neptunium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the 3d @-@ transition metals . 
 All actinides are pyrophoric , especially when finely divided , that is , they spontaneously ignite upon reaction with air . The melting point of actinides does not have a clear dependence on the number of f @-@ electrons . The unusually low melting point of neptunium and plutonium ( ~ 640 ° C ) is explained by hybridization of 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in these metals . 
 = = = Chemical properties = = = 
 Like the lanthanides , all actinides are highly reactive with halogens and chalcogens ; however , the actinides react more easily . Actinides , especially those with a small number of 5f @-@ electrons , are prone to hybridization . This is explained by the similarity of the electron energies at the 5f , 7s and 6d shells . Most actinides exhibit a larger variety of valence states , and the most stable are + 6 for uranium , + 5 for protactinium and neptunium , + 4 for thorium and plutonium and + 3 for actinium and other actinides . 
 Chemically , actinium is similar to lanthanum , which is explained by their similar ionic radii and electronic structure . Like lanthanum , actinium has oxidation of + 3 , but it is less reactive and has more pronounced basic properties . Among other trivalent actinides <unk> + is least acidic , i.e. has the weakest tendency to hydrolyze in aqueous solutions . 
 Thorium is rather active chemically . Owing to lack of electrons on 6d and 5f orbitals , the tetravalent thorium compounds are colorless . At pH < 3 , the solutions of thorium salts are dominated by the cations [ Th ( H2O ) 8 ] 4 + . The Th4 + ion is relatively large , and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0 @.@ 95 and 1 @.@ 14 Å . As a result , thorium salts have a weak tendency to hydrolyse . The distinctive ability of thorium salts is their high solubility , not only in water , but also in polar organic solvents . 
 Protactinium exhibits two valence states ; the + 5 is stable , and the + 4 state easily oxidizes to protactinium ( V ) . Thus tetravalent protactinium in solutions is obtained by the action of strong reducing agents in a hydrogen atmosphere . Tetravalent protactinium is chemically similar to uranium ( IV ) and thorium ( IV ) . Fluorides , phosphates , <unk> , iodate and <unk> of protactinium ( IV ) are insoluble in water and dilute acids . Protactinium forms soluble carbonates . The hydrolytic properties of pentavalent protactinium are close to those of tantalum ( V ) and niobium ( V ) . The complex chemical behavior of protactinium is a consequence of the start of the filling of the 5f shell in this element . 
 Uranium has a valence from 3 to 6 , the last being most stable . In the hexavalent state , uranium is very similar to the group 6 elements . Many compounds of uranium ( IV ) and uranium ( VI ) are non @-@ stoichiometric , i.e. have variable composition . For example , the actual chemical formula of uranium dioxide is UO2 + x , where x varies between − 0 @.@ 4 and 0 @.@ 32 . Uranium ( VI ) compounds are weak oxidants . Most of them contain the linear " uranyl " group , UO2 + 
 2 . Between 4 and 6 ligands can be accommodated in an equatorial plane perpendicular to the uranyl group . The uranyl group acts as a hard acid and forms stronger complexes with oxygen @-@ donor ligands than with nitrogen @-@ donor ligands . NpO2 + 
 2 and PuO2 + 
 2 are also the common form of Np and Pu in the + 6 oxidation state . Uranium ( IV ) compounds exhibit reducing properties , e.g. , they are easily oxidized by atmospheric oxygen . Uranium ( III ) is a very strong reducing agent . Owing to the presence of d @-@ shell , uranium ( as well as many other actinides ) forms organometallic compounds , such as <unk> ( C5H5 ) 3 and <unk> ( C5H5 ) 4 . 
 Neptunium has valence states from 3 to 7 , which can be simultaneously observed in solutions . The most stable state in solution is + 5 , but the valence + 4 is preferred in solid neptunium compounds . Neptunium metal is very reactive . Ions of neptunium are prone to hydrolysis and formation of coordination compounds . 
 Plutonium also exhibits valence states between 3 and 7 inclusive , and thus is chemically similar to neptunium and uranium . It is highly reactive , and quickly forms an oxide film in air . Plutonium reacts with hydrogen even at temperatures as low as 25 – 50 ° C ; it also easily forms halides and intermetallic compounds . Hydrolysis reactions of plutonium ions of different oxidation states are quite diverse . Plutonium ( V ) can enter polymerization reactions . 
 The largest chemical diversity among actinides is observed in americium , which can have valence between 2 and 6 . Divalent americium is obtained only in dry compounds and non @-@ aqueous solutions ( acetonitrile ) . Oxidation states + 3 , + 5 and + 6 are typical for aqueous solutions , but also in the solid state . Tetravalent americium forms stable solid compounds ( dioxide , fluoride and hydroxide ) as well as complexes in aqueous solutions . It was reported that in alkaline solution americium can be oxidized to the <unk> state , but these data proved erroneous . The most stable valence of americium is 3 in the aqueous solutions and 3 or 4 in solid compounds . 
 Valence 3 is dominant in all subsequent elements up to lawrencium ( with the possible exception of nobelium ) . Curium can be tetravalent in solids ( fluoride , dioxide ) . Berkelium , along with a valence of + 3 , also shows the valence of + 4 , more stable than that of curium ; the valence 4 is observed in solid fluoride and dioxide . The stability of Bk4 + in aqueous solution is close to that of <unk> + . Only valence 3 was observed for californium , einsteinium and fermium . The divalent state is proven for mendelevium and nobelium , and in nobelium it is more stable than the trivalent state . Lawrencium shows valence 3 both in solutions and solids . 
 The redox potential <formula> increases from − 0 @.@ 32 V in uranium , through 0 @.@ 34 V ( Np ) and 1 @.@ 04 V ( Pu ) to 1 @.@ 34 V in americium revealing the increasing reduction ability of the <unk> + ion from americium to uranium . All actinides form <unk> hydrides of black color with salt @-@ like properties . Actinides also produce carbides with the general formula of <unk> or <unk> ( <unk> for uranium ) as well as sulfides <unk> and <unk> .

 Some actinides can exists in several oxide forms such as An2O3 , AnO2 , <unk> and <unk> . For all actinides , oxides <unk> are amphoteric and An2O3 , AnO2 and <unk> are basic , they easily react with water , forming bases : 
 An2O3 + 3 H2O → 2 An ( OH ) 3 . 
 These bases are poorly soluble in water and by their activity are close to the hydroxides of rare @-@ earth metals . The strongest base is of actinium . All compounds of actinium are colorless , except for black actinium sulfide ( Ac2S3 ) . <unk> of tetravalent actinides crystallize in the cubic system , same as in calcium fluoride . 
 Thorium reacting with oxygen exclusively forms dioxide : 
 <formula> 
 Thorium dioxide is a refractory material with the highest melting point among any known oxide ( 3390 ° C ) . Adding 0 @.@ 8 – 1 % ThO2 to tungsten stabilizes its structure , so the doped filaments have better mechanical stability to vibrations . To dissolve ThO2 in acids , it is heated to 500 – 600 ° C ; heating above 600 ° C produces a very resistant to acids and other reagents form of ThO2 . Small addition of fluoride ions catalyses dissolution of thorium dioxide in acids . 
 Two protactinium oxides were obtained : PaO2 ( black ) and Pa2O5 ( white ) ; the former is isomorphic with ThO2 and the latter is easier to obtain . Both oxides are basic , and Pa ( OH ) 5 is a weak , poorly soluble base . 
 Decomposition of certain salts of uranium , for example UO2 ( NO3 ) · 6H2O in air at 400 ° C , yields orange or yellow UO3 . This oxide is amphoteric and forms several hydroxides , the most stable being UO2 ( OH ) 2 . Reaction of uranium ( VI ) oxide with hydrogen results in uranium dioxide , which is similar in its properties with ThO2 . This oxide is also basic and corresponds to the uranium hydroxide ( U ( OH ) 4 ) . 
 Plutonium , neptunium and americium form two basic oxides : An2O3 and AnO2 . Neptunium trioxide is unstable ; thus , only <unk> could be obtained so far . However , the oxides of plutonium and neptunium with the chemical formula AnO2 and An2O3 are well characterized . 
 = = = Salts = = =

 * * Depending on the isotopes 
 Actinides easily react with halogens forming salts with the formulas <unk> and <unk> ( X = halogen ) . So the first berkelium compound , BkCl3 , was synthesized in 1962 with an amount of 3 nanograms . Like the halogens of rare earth elements , actinide chlorides , bromides , and iodides are water @-@ soluble , and fluorides are insoluble . Uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride , which sublimates at a temperature of 56 @.@ 5 ° C ; because of its volatility , it is used in the separation of uranium isotopes with gas centrifuge or gaseous diffusion . Actinide hexafluorides have properties close to anhydrides . They are very sensitive to moisture and hydrolyze forming <unk> . The pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized , but they are both unstable . 
 Action of acids on actinides yields salts , and if the acids are non @-@ oxidizing then the actinide in the salt is in low @-@ valence state : 
 U + 2 H2SO4 → U ( SO4 ) 2 + 2 H2 
 2 Pu + 6 HCl → 2 <unk> + 3 H2 
 However , in these reactions the regenerating hydrogen can react with the metal , forming the corresponding hydride . Uranium reacts with acids and water much more easily than thorium . 
 Actinide salts can also be obtained by dissolving the corresponding hydroxides in acids . Nitrates , chlorides , sulfates and perchlorates of actinides are water @-@ soluble . When crystallizing from aqueous solutions , these salts forming a hydrates , such as Th ( NO3 ) 4 · 6H2O , Th ( SO4 ) 2 · <unk> and <unk> ( SO4 ) 3 · 7H2O . Salts of high @-@ valence actinides easily hydrolyze . So , colorless sulfate , chloride , perchlorate and nitrate of thorium transform into basic salts with formulas Th ( OH ) <unk> and Th ( OH ) <unk> . The solubility and insolubility of trivalent and tetravalent actinides is like that of lanthanide salts . So phosphates , fluorides , oxalates , <unk> and carbonates of actinides are weakly soluble in water ; they precipitate as hydrates , such as <unk> · 3H2O and Th ( <unk> ) 2 · 3H2O . 
 Actinides with oxidation state + 6 , except for the <unk> + -type cations , form [ <unk> ] 2 − , [ <unk> ] 2 − and other complex anions . For example , uranium , neptunium and plutonium form salts of the <unk> ( uranate ) and ( NH4 ) <unk> ( diuranate ) types . In comparison with lanthanides , actinides more easily form coordination compounds , and this ability increases with the actinide valence . Trivalent actinides do not form fluoride coordination compounds , whereas tetravalent thorium forms <unk> , <unk> , and even <unk> complexes . Thorium also forms the corresponding sulfates ( for example Na2SO4 · Th ( SO4 ) 2 · <unk> ) , nitrates and <unk> . Salts with the general formula <unk> ( NO3 ) 6 · nH2O are of coordination nature , with the coordination number of thorium equal to 12 . Even easier is to produce complex salts of pentavalent and hexavalent actinides . The most stable coordination compounds of actinides – tetravalent thorium and uranium – are obtained in reactions with <unk> , e.g. <unk> . 
 = = Applications = = 
 While actinides have some established daily @-@ life applications , such as in smoke detectors ( americium ) and gas mantles ( thorium ) , they are mostly used in nuclear weapons and use as a fuel in nuclear reactors . The last two areas exploit the property of actinides to release enormous energy in nuclear reactions , which under certain conditions may become self @-@ sustaining chain reaction . 
 The most important isotope for nuclear power applications is uranium @-@ 235 . It is used in the thermal reactor , and its concentration in natural uranium does not exceed 0 @.@ 72 % . This isotope strongly absorbs thermal neutrons releasing much energy . One fission act of 1 gram of 235U converts into about 1 MW · day . Of importance , is that 235U emits more neutrons than it absorbs ; upon reaching the critical mass , 235U enters into a self @-@ sustaining chain reaction . Typically , uranium nucleus is divided into two fragments with the release of 2 – 3 neutrons , for example : 
 <formula> 
 Other promising actinide isotopes for nuclear power are thorium @-@ 232 and its product from the thorium fuel cycle , uranium @-@ 233 . 
 Emission of neutrons during the fission of uranium is important not only for maintaining the nuclear chain reaction , but also for the synthesis of the heavier actinides . Uranium @-@ 239 converts via β @-@ decay into plutonium @-@ 239 , which , like uranium @-@ 235 , is capable of spontaneous fission . The world 's first nuclear reactors were built not for energy , but for producing plutonium @-@ 239 for nuclear weapons . 
 About half of the produced thorium is used as the light @-@ emitting material of gas mantles . Thorium is also added into multicomponent alloys of magnesium and zinc . So the Mg @-@ Th alloys are light and strong , but also have high melting point and ductility and thus are widely used in the aviation industry and in the production of missiles . Thorium also has good electron emission properties , with long lifetime and low potential barrier for the emission . The relative content of thorium and uranium isotopes is widely used to estimate the age of various objects , including stars ( see radiometric dating ) . 
 The major application of plutonium has been in nuclear weapons , where the isotope plutonium @-@ 239 was a key component due to its ease of fission and availability . Plutonium @-@ based designs allow reducing the critical mass to about a third of that for uranium @-@ 235 . The " Fat Man " -type plutonium bombs produced during the Manhattan Project used explosive compression of plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal , combined with a central neutron source to begin the reaction and increase efficiency . Thus only 6 @.@ 2 kg of plutonium was needed for an explosive yield equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT . ( See also Nuclear weapon design . ) Hypothetically , as little as 4 kg of plutonium — and maybe even less — could be used to make a single atomic bomb using very sophisticated assembly designs . 
 Plutonium @-@ 238 is potentially more efficient isotope for nuclear reactors , since it has smaller critical mass than uranium @-@ 235 , but it continues to release much thermal energy ( 0 @.@ 56 W / g ) by decay even when the fission chain reaction is stopped by control rods . Its application is limited by the high price ( about 1000 USD / g ) . This isotope has been used in <unk> and water distillation systems of some space satellites and stations . So Galileo and Apollo spacecraft ( e.g. Apollo 14 ) had heaters powered by kilogram quantities of plutonium @-@ 238 oxide ; this heat is also transformed into electricity with <unk> . The decay of plutonium @-@ 238 produces relatively harmless alpha particles and is not accompanied by gamma @-@ irradiation . Therefore , this isotope ( ~ 160 mg ) is used as the energy source in heart pacemakers where it lasts about 5 times longer than conventional batteries . 
 Actinium @-@ 227 is used as a neutron source . Its high specific energy ( 14 @.@ 5 W / g ) and the possibility of obtaining significant quantities of thermally stable compounds are attractive for use in long @-@ lasting thermoelectric generators for remote use . 228Ac is used as an indicator of radioactivity in chemical research , as it emits high @-@ energy electrons ( 2 @.@ 18 MeV ) that can be easily detected . 228Ac @-@ 228Ra mixtures are widely used as an intense gamma @-@ source in industry and medicine . 
 Development of self @-@ glowing actinide @-@ doped materials with durable crystalline matrices is a new area of actinide utilization as the addition of alpha @-@ emitting radionuclides to some glasses and crystals may confer luminescence . 
 = = Toxicity = = 
 Radioactive substances can harm human health via ( i ) local skin contamination , ( ii ) internal exposure due to ingestion of radioactive isotopes , and ( iii ) external overexposure by β @-@ activity and γ @-@ radiation . Together with radium and transuranium elements , actinium is one of the most dangerous radioactive poisons with high specific α @-@ activity . The most important feature of actinium is its ability to accumulate and remain in the surface layer of skeletons . At the initial stage of poisoning , actinium accumulates in the liver . Another danger of actinium is that it undergoes radioactive decay faster than being excreted . Adsorption from the digestive tract is much smaller ( ~ 0 @.@ 05 % ) for actinium than radium . 
 Protactinium in the body tends to accumulate in the kidneys and bones . The maximum safe dose of protactinium in the human body is 0 @.@ 03 µCi that corresponds to 0 @.@ 5 micrograms of 231Pa . This isotope , which might be present in the air as aerosol , is 2 @.@ 5 × 108 times more toxic than <unk> acid . 
 Plutonium , when entering the body through air , food or blood ( e.g. a wound ) , mostly settles in the lungs , liver and bones with only about 10 % going to other organs , and remains there for decades . The long residence time of plutonium in the body is partly explained by its poor solubility in water . Some isotopes of plutonium emit ionizing α @-@ radiation , which damages the surrounding cells . The median lethal dose ( LD50 ) for 30 days in dogs after intravenous injection of plutonium is 0 @.@ 32 milligram per kg of body mass , and thus the lethal dose for humans is approximately 22 mg for a person weighing 70 kg ; the amount for respiratory exposure should be approximately four times greater . Another estimate assumes that plutonium is 50 times less toxic than radium , and thus permissible content of plutonium in the body should be 5 µg or 0 @.@ 3 µCi . Such amount is nearly invisible in under microscope . After trials on animals , this maximum permissible dose was reduced to 0 @.@ 65 µg or 0 @.@ 04 µCi . Studies on animals also revealed that the most dangerous plutonium exposure route is through inhalation , after which 5 – 25 % of inhaled substances is retained in the body . Depending on the particle size and solubility of the plutonium compounds , plutonium is localized either in the lungs or in the lymphatic system , or is absorbed in the blood and then transported to the liver and bones . Contamination via food is the least likely way . In this case , only about 0 @.@ 05 % of soluble 0 @.@ 01 % insoluble compounds of plutonium absorbs into blood , and the rest is excreted . Exposure of damaged skin to plutonium would retain nearly 100 % of it . 
 Using actinides in nuclear fuel , sealed radioactive sources or advanced materials such as self @-@ glowing crystals has many potential benefits . However , a serious concern is the extremely high radiotoxicity of actinides and their migration in the environment . Use of chemically unstable forms of actinides in MOX and sealed radioactive sources is not appropriate by modern safety standards . There is a challenge to develop stable and durable actinide @-@ bearing materials , which provide safe storage , use and final disposal . A key need is application of actinide solid solutions in durable crystalline host phases . 
 = Rodent = 
 Rodents ( from Latin rodere , " to gnaw " ) are mammals of the order Rodentia , which are characterized by a single pair of unremittingly growing incisors in each of the upper and lower jaws . About forty percent of all mammal species are rodents ; they are found in vast numbers on all continents except Antarctica . They are the most diversified mammalian order and live in a variety of terrestrial habitats , including human @-@ made environments . 
 There are species that are arboreal , fossorial ( burrowing ) , and semiaquatic . Well @-@ known rodents include mice , rats , squirrels , prairie dogs , porcupines , beavers , guinea pigs , hamsters , and capybaras . Other animals such as rabbits , hares and pikas were once included with them , but are now considered to be in a separate order , Lagomorpha . 
 Most rodents are small animals with robust bodies , short limbs and long tails . They use their sharp incisors to gnaw food , excavate burrows and defend themselves . Most eat seeds or other plant material , but some have more varied diets . They tend to be social animals and many species live in societies with complex ways of communicating with each other . Mating among rodents can vary from monogamy , to polygyny , to promiscuity . Many have litters of underdeveloped , altricial young , while others have precocial young that are relatively well developed at birth . 
 The rodent fossil record dates back to the Paleocene on the supercontinent of Laurasia . They greatly diversified in the Eocene , as they spread across continents , sometimes even finding means to cross oceans . Rodents reached both South America and Madagascar from Africa , and were the only terrestrial placental mammals to reach and colonize Australia . 
 Rodents have been used as food , for clothing , as pets and as laboratory animals in research . Some species , in particular the brown rat , the black rat , and the house mouse are serious pests , eating and spoiling food stored by humans , and spreading diseases . Accidentally introduced species of rodents are often considered to be invasive , and have caused the extinction of numerous species , such as island birds , previously isolated from land @-@ based predators . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 The distinguishing feature of the rodents is their single pair of continuously growing , razor @-@ sharp incisors . These incisors have thick layers of enamel on the front and little enamel on the back . Because they do not stop growing , the animal must continue to wear them down so that they do not reach and pierce the skull . As the incisors grind against each other , the softer dentine on the rear of the teeth wears away , leaving the sharp enamel edge shaped like the blade of a chisel . 
 Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior premolars . There is a gap , or diastema , between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species . This allows them to suck in their cheeks or lips to shield their mouth and throat from wood shavings and other inedible material , discarding this waste from the sides of their mouth . <unk> and guinea pigs have a high fiber diet ; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors . 
 In many species , the molars are relatively large , intricately structured and highly cusped or ridged , though some , such as <unk> , have smaller and simpler ones . Rodent molars are well equipped to grind food into small particles . The jaw musculature is strong . The lower jaw is thrust forward while gnawing and is pulled backwards during chewing . Rodent groups differ in the arrangement of the jaw muscles and associated skull structures , both from other mammals and amongst themselves . The Sciuromorpha , such as the eastern grey squirrel , have a large deep masseter , making them efficient at biting with the incisors . 
 The Myomorpha , such as the brown rat , have an enlarged temporalis muscle , making them able to chew powerfully with the molars . The Hystricomorpha , such as the guinea pig , have a larger superficial masseter muscle and a smaller deep masseter muscle than rats or squirrels , possibly making them less efficient at biting with the incisors , but their enlarged internal pterygoid muscle may allow them to move the jaw further sideways when chewing . 
 While the largest species , the capybara , can weigh as much as 66 kg ( 146 lb ) , most rodents weigh less than 100 g ( 3 @.@ 5 oz ) . The smallest rodent is the Baluchistan pygmy <unk> , which averages only 4 @.@ 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 7 in ) in head and body length , with adult females weighing only 3 @.@ 75 g ( 0 @.@ 132 oz ) . Rodents have wide @-@ ranging morphologies , but typically have squat bodies and short limbs . The forelimbs usually have five digits , including an opposable thumb , while the hindlimbs have three to five digits . The elbow gives the forearms great flexibility . The majority of species are plantigrade , walking on both the palms and soles of their feet , and have claw @-@ like nails . The nails of burrowing species tend to be long and strong , while arboreal rodents have shorter , sharper nails . Rodent species use a wide variety of methods of locomotion including quadrupedal walking , running , burrowing and climbing , bipedal hopping ( kangaroo rats and hopping mice ) , swimming and even gliding . Scaly @-@ tailed squirrels and flying squirrels , although not closely related , can both glide from tree to tree using parachute @-@ like membranes that stretch from the forelimbs to the hindlimbs . The agouti is fleet @-@ footed and antelope @-@ like , being digitigrade and having hoof @-@ like nails . The majority of rodents have tails , which can be of many shapes and sizes . Some tails are prehensile , as in the Eurasian harvest mouse , and the fur on the tails can vary from bushy to completely bald . The tail is sometimes used for communication , as when beavers slap their tails on the water surface or house mice rattle their tails to indicate alarm . Some species have vestigial tails or no tails at all . In some species , the tail is capable of regeneration if a part is broken off . 
 Rodents generally have well @-@ developed senses of smell , hearing and vision . Nocturnal species often have enlarged eyes and some are sensitive to ultraviolet light . Many species have long , sensitive whiskers or vibrissae for touch or " whisking " . Some rodents have cheek pouches , which may be lined with fur . These can be turned inside out for cleaning . In many species , the tongue cannot reach past the incisors . Rodents have efficient digestive systems , absorbing nearly 80 percent of ingested energy . When eating cellulose , the food is softened in the stomach and passed to the cecum , where bacteria reduce it to its carbohydrate elements . The rodent then practices coprophagy , eating its own fecal pellets , so that the nutrients can be absorbed by the gut . Rodents therefore often produce a hard and dry fecal pellet . In many species , the penis contains a bone , the baculum ; the testes can be located either <unk> or at the groin . 
 Sexual dimorphism occurs in many rodent species . In some rodents , males are larger than females while in others the reverse is true . Male @-@ bias sexual dimorphism is typical for ground squirrels , kangaroo rats , solitary mole rats and pocket gophers ; it likely developed due to sexual selection and greater male @-@ male combat . Female @-@ bias sexual dimorphism exists among chipmunks and jumping mice . It is not understood why this pattern occurs , but in the case of yellow @-@ pine chipmunks it may be that males selected larger females due to their greater reproductive success . In some species , like voles , sexual dimorphism can vary from population to population . In bank voles , females are typically larger than males , however male @-@ bias sexual dimorphism occurs in alpine populations , possibly because of the lack of predators and greater competition between males . 
 The diversity of characteristics of rodents is great , sometimes even in closely related species . Characteristics of several rodents are given in the table below . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 One of the most widespread groups of mammals , rodents can be found on every continent except Antarctica . They are the only terrestrial placental mammals that have colonized Australia and New Guinea without human intervention . Humans have also allowed the animals to spread to many remote oceanic islands ( e.g. , the Polynesian rat ) . Rodents have adapted to almost every terrestrial habitat , from cold tundra ( where they can live under snow ) to hot deserts . 
 Some species such as tree squirrels and New World porcupines are arboreal , while some , such as gophers , <unk> @-@ <unk> and mole rats , live almost completely underground , where they build complex burrow systems . Others dwell on the surface of the ground but may have a burrow into which they can retreat . Beavers and muskrats are known for being semiaquatic , but the rodent best @-@ adapted for aquatic life is probably the earless water rat from New Guinea . Rodents have also thrived in human @-@ created environments such as agricultural and urban areas . 
 Though some species are common pests for humans , rodents also play important ecological roles . Some rodents are considered keystone species and ecosystem engineers in their respective habitats . In the Great Plains of North America , the burrowing activities of prairie dogs play important roles in soil aeration and nutrient redistribution , raising the organic content of the soil and increasing the absorption of water . They maintain these grassland habitats , and some large herbivores like bison and pronghorn prefer to graze near prairie dog colonies due to the increased nutritional quality of forage . 
 Prairie dogs can , however , also contribute to regional and local biodiversity loss , increased seed <unk> and the establishment and spread of invasive shrubs . Burrowing rodents may eat the fruiting bodies of fungi and spread spores through their feces , thereby allowing the fungi to disperse and form symbiotic relationships with the roots of plants ( which usually cannot thrive without them ) . As such , these rodents may play a role in maintaining healthy forests . 
 In many temperate regions , beavers play an essential hydrological role . When building their dams and lodges , beavers alter the paths of streams and rivers and allow for the creation of extensive wetland habitats . One study found that engineering by beavers leads to a 33 percent increase in the number of herbaceous plant species in riparian areas . Another study found that beavers increase wild salmon populations .

 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Most rodents are herbivorous , feeding exclusively on plant material such as seeds , stems , leaves , flowers and roots . Some are omnivorous and a few are predators . The field vole is a typical herbivorous rodent and feeds on grasses , herbs , root tubers , moss and other vegetation , and gnaws on bark during the winter . It occasionally eats invertebrates such as insect larvae . The plains pocket gopher eats plant material found underground during tunneling , and also collects grasses , roots and tubers in its cheek pouches and caches them in underground larder chambers . 
 The Texas pocket gopher avoids emerging onto the surface to feed by seizing the roots of plants with its jaws and pulling them downwards into its burrow . It also practices coprophagy . The African pouched rat forages on the surface , gathering anything that might be edible into its capacious cheek pouches until its face bulges out sideways . It then returns to its burrow to sort through the material it has gathered and eats the nutritious items . 
 The agouti is one of the few animals that can break open the large capsules of the Brazil nut fruit . There are too many seeds inside to be consumed in one meal , so the agouti carries some off and caches them . This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate . Other nut @-@ bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn . These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees . In desert regions , seeds are often only available for short periods . The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow . 
 A strategy for dealing with seasonal plenty is to eat as much as possible and store the surplus nutrients as fat . Marmots do this , and may be 50 percent heavier in the autumn than in the spring . They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation . Beavers feed on the leaves , buds and inner bark of growing trees , as well as aquatic plants . They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond , sticking the end into the mud to anchor them . Here , they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over . 
 Although traditionally rodents have been regarded as herbivores , a number of species opportunistically include insects , fish or meat in their diet and more specialized forms rely on such foods . A functional @-@ morphological study of the rodent tooth system supports the idea that primitive rodents were omnivores rather than herbivores . Studies of the literature show that numerous members of the Sciuromorpha and Myomorpha , and a few members of Hystricomorpha , have either included animal matter in their diet or been prepared to eat such food when offered it in captivity . Examination of the stomach contents of the North American white @-@ footed mouse , normally considered to be herbivorous , showed 34 % animal matter . 
 More specialized carnivores include the <unk> rats of the Philippines , which feed on insects and soft @-@ bodied invertebrates , and the Australian water rat , which devours aquatic insects , fish , crustaceans , mussels , snails , frogs , birds ' eggs and water birds . The grasshopper mouse from dry regions of North America feeds on insects , scorpions , other small mice and only a small part of its diet is plant material . It has a chunky body with short legs and tail , but is agile and can easily overpower prey as large as itself . 
 = = = Social behavior = = = 
 Rodents exhibit a wide range of types of social behavior ranging from the first known mammalian caste system of the naked mole rat , the extensive " town " of the colonial prairie dog , through family groups to the independent , solitary life of the edible dormouse . Adult dormice may have overlapping feeding ranges , but they live in individual nests and feed separately , coming together briefly in the breeding season to mate . The pocket gopher is also a solitary animal outside the breeding season , each individual digging a complex tunnel system and maintaining a territory . 
 Larger rodents tend to live in family units where parents and their offspring live together until the youngsters disperse . Beavers live in extended family units typically with a pair of adults , this year 's kits , the previous year 's offspring and sometimes older young . Brown rats usually live in small colonies with up to six females sharing a burrow and one male defending a territory around the burrow . At high population densities , this system breaks down and males show a hierarchical system of dominance with overlapping ranges . Female offspring remain in the colony while male young disperse . The prairie vole is monogamous and forms a lifelong pair bond . Outside the breeding season , prairie voles live in close proximity with others in small colonies . A male is not aggressive towards other males until he has mated , after which time he defends a territory , a female and a nest against other males . The pair huddle together , groom one another , and share nesting and pup @-@ raising responsibilities . 
 Among the most social of rodents are the ground squirrels , which typically form colonies based on female kinship , males dispersing after weaning and becoming nomadic as adults . Cooperation in ground squirrels varies between species and typically includes making alarm calls , defending territories , sharing food , protecting nesting areas and preventing infanticide . The black @-@ tailed prairie dog forms large towns that may cover many hectares . The burrows do not interconnect but are excavated and occupied by territorial family groups known as coteries . A coterie often consists of an adult male , three or four adult females , several non @-@ breeding yearlings and this year 's offspring . Individuals within coteries are friendly with each other , but hostile towards outsiders . 
 Perhaps the most extreme examples of colonial behavior in rodents are the eusocial naked mole rat and Damaraland mole rat . The naked mole rat lives completely underground and can form colonies of up to eighty individuals . Only one female and up to three males in the colony reproduce , while the rest of the members are smaller , sterile and function as workers . Some individuals are of intermediate size . They help with the rearing of the young and can take the place of a reproductive if one dies . The Damaraland mole rat is characterized by having a single reproductively active male and female in a colony where the remaining animals are not truly sterile , but only become fertile if they establish a colony of their own . 
 = = = Communication = = = 
 = = = = Olfactory = = = = 
 Rodents use scent marking in many social contexts including inter- and intra @-@ species communication , the marking of trails and the establishment of territories . Their urine provides genetic information about individuals including the species , the sex and individual identity , and metabolic information on dominance , reproductive status and health . Compounds derived from the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) are bound to several urinary proteins . The odor of a predator depresses scent @-@ marking behavior . 
 Rodents are able to recognize close relatives by smell and this allows them to show nepotism ( preferential behavior toward their kin ) and also avoid inbreeding . This kin recognition is by olfactory cues from urine , feces and glandular secretions . The main assessment may involve the MHC , where the degree of relatedness of two individuals is correlated to the MHC genes they have in common . In non @-@ kin communication , where more permanent odor markers are required , as at territorial borders , then non @-@ volatile major urinary proteins ( MUPs ) , which function as pheromone transporters , may also be used . MUPs may also signal individual identity , with each male house mouse ( Mus musculus ) excreting urine containing about a dozen genetically encoded MUPs . 
 House mice deposit urine , which contains pheromones , for territorial marking , individual and group recognition , and social organization . This can occur in a range of ways : 
 The Bruce effect : Pheromones from strange adult males cause females to terminate their pregnancies 
 The Whitten effect : Pheromones from familiar males cause synchronous estrus in a female population 
 The Vandenbergh effect : Pheromones from mature male house mice cause an early induction of the first estrous cycle in prepubertal female mice 
 The Lee – Boot effect : Pheromones from mature females cause the suppression or prolongation of oestrous cycles of other female house mice ( and other rodents ) when they are housed in groups and isolated from males 
 Pheromones from males or from pregnant or lactating females can speed up or retard sexual maturation in juvenile females 
 Territorial beavers and red squirrels investigate and become familiar with the scents of their neighbors and respond less aggressively to intrusions by them than to those made by non @-@ territorial " floaters " or strangers . This is known as the " dear enemy effect " . 
 = = = = Auditory = = = = 
 Many rodent species , particularly those that are diurnal and social , have a wide range of alarm calls that are emitted when they perceive threats . There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this . A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected , or an alarm call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action . Several species , for example prairie dogs , have complex anti @-@ predator alarm call systems . These species may have different calls for different predators ( e.g. aerial predators or ground @-@ based predators ) and each call contains information about the nature of the precise threat . The urgency of the threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties of the call . 
 Social rodents have a wider range of vocalizations than do solitary species . Fifteen different call @-@ types have been recognized in adult <unk> mole rats and four in juveniles . Similarly , the degu , another social , burrowing rodent , exhibits a wide array of communication methods and has an elaborate vocal repertoire comprising fifteen different categories of sound . Ultrasonic calls play a part in social communication between dormice and are used when the individuals are out of sight of each other . 
 House mice use both audible and ultrasonic calls in a variety of contexts . Audible vocalizations can often be heard during agonistic or aggressive encounters , whereas ultrasound is used in sexual communication and also by pups when they have fallen out of the nest . 
 Laboratory rats ( which are brown rats , Rattus norvegicus ) emit short , high frequency , ultrasonic vocalizations during purportedly pleasurable experiences such as rough @-@ and @-@ tumble play , when anticipating routine doses of morphine , during mating , and when tickled . The vocalization , described as a distinct " chirping " , has been likened to laughter , and is interpreted as an expectation of something rewarding . In clinical studies , the chirping is associated with positive emotional feelings , and social bonding occurs with the tickler , resulting in the rats becoming conditioned to seek the tickling . However , as the rats age , the tendency to chirp declines . Like most rat vocalizations , the chirping is at frequencies too high for humans to hear without special equipment , so bat detectors have been used for this purpose . 
 It has been reported that brown rats use ultrasound for echolocation . The frequencies heard by rodents differ between species . The table below shows the hearing ranges of several species . 
 = = = = Visual = = = = 
 Rodents , like all placental mammals except primates , have just two types of light receptive cones in their retina , a short wavelength " blue @-@ UV " type and a middle wavelength " green " type . They are therefore classified as dichromats ; however , they are visually sensitive into the ultraviolet ( UV ) spectrum and therefore can see light that humans can not . The functions of this UV sensitivity are not always clear . In degus , for example , the belly reflects more UV light than the back . Therefore , when a degu stands up on its hind legs , which it does when alarmed , it exposes its belly to other degus and ultraviolet vision may serve a purpose in communicating the alarm . When it stands on all fours , its low UV @-@ reflectance back could help make the degu less visible to predators . Ultraviolet light is abundant during the day but not at night . There is a large increase in the ratio of ultraviolet to visible light in the morning and evening twilight hours . Many rodents are active during twilight hours ( crepuscular activity ) , and UV @-@ sensitivity would be advantageous at these times . Ultraviolet reflectivity is of dubious value for nocturnal rodents . 
 The urine of many rodents ( e.g. voles , degus , mice , rats ) strongly reflects UV light and this may be used in communication by leaving visible as well as olfactory markings . However , the amount of UV that is reflected decreases with time , which in some circumstances can be disadvantageous ; the common kestrel can distinguish between old and fresh rodent trails and has greater success hunting over more recently marked routes . 
 = = = = Tactile = = = = 
 Vibrations can provide cues to conspecifics about specific behaviors being performed , predator warning and avoidance , herd or group maintenance , and courtship . The Middle East blind mole rat was the first mammal for which vibrational communication was documented . These fossorial rodents bang their head against the walls of their tunnels . This behavior was initially interpreted as part of their tunnel building behavior , but it was eventually realized that they generate temporally patterned vibrational signals for long @-@ distance communication with neighboring mole rats . 
 <unk> is used widely as a predator warning or defensive action . It is used primarily by fossorial or semi @-@ fossorial rodents . The banner @-@ tailed kangaroo rat produces several complex <unk> patterns in a number of different contexts , one of which is when it encounters a snake . The <unk> may alert nearby offspring but most likely conveys that the rat is too alert for a successful attack , thus preventing the snake 's predatory pursuit . Several studies have indicated intentional use of ground vibrations as a means of intra @-@ specific communication during courtship among the Cape mole rat . <unk> has been reported to be involved in male @-@ male competition ; the dominant male indicates its resource holding potential by drumming , thus minimizing physical contact with potential rivals . 
 = = = Mating strategies = = = 
 Some species of rodent are monogamous , with an adult male and female forming a lasting pair bond . Monogamy can come in two forms ; obligate and facultative . In obligate monogamy , both parents care for the offspring and play an important part in their survival . This occurs in species such as California mice , oldfield mice , Malagasy giant rats and beavers . In these species , males usually mate only with their partners . In addition to increased care for young , obligate monogamy can also be beneficial to the adult male as it decreases the chances of never finding a mate or mating with an infertile female . In facultative monogamy , the males do not provide direct parental care and stay with one female because they cannot access others due to being spatially dispersed . Prairie voles appear to be an example of this form of monogamy , with males guarding and defending females within their vicinity . 
 In polygynous species , males will try to monopolize and mate with multiple females . As with monogamy , polygyny in rodents can come in two forms ; defense and non @-@ defense . Defense polygyny involves males controlling territories that contain resources that attract females . This occurs in ground squirrels like yellow @-@ bellied marmots , California ground squirrels , Columbian ground squirrels and Richardson 's ground squirrels . Males with territories are known as " resident " males and the females that live within the territories are known as " resident " females . In the case of marmots , resident males do not appear to ever lose their territories and always win encounters with invading males . Some species are also known to directly defend their resident females and the ensuing fights can lead to severe wounding . In species with non @-@ defense polygyny , males are not territorial and wander widely in search of females to monopolize . These males establish dominance hierarchies , with the high @-@ ranking males having access to the most females . This occurs in species like Belding 's ground squirrels and some tree squirrel species . 
 Promiscuity , in which both males and females mate with multiple partners , also occurs in rodents . In species such as the white @-@ footed mouse , females give birth to litters with multiple <unk> . Promiscuity leads to increased sperm competition and males tend to have larger testicles . In the Cape ground squirrel , the male 's testes can be 20 percent of its head @-@ body length . Several rodent species have flexible mating systems that can vary between monogamy , polygyny and promiscuity . 
 Female rodents play an active role in choosing their mates . Factors that contribute to female preference may include the size , dominance and spatial ability of the male . In the eusocial naked mole rats , a single female monopolizes mating from at least three males . 
 In most rodent species , such as brown rats and house mice , ovulation occurs on a regular cycle while in others , such as voles , it is induced by mating . During copulation , males of some rodent species deposit a mating plug in the female 's genital opening , both to prevent sperm leakage and to protect against other males inseminating the female . Females can remove the plug and may do so either immediately or after several hours . 
 = = = Birth and parenting = = = 
 Rodents may be born either altricial ( blind , hairless and relatively underdeveloped ) or precocial ( mostly furred , eyes open and fairly developed ) depending on the species . The altricial state is typical for squirrels and mice , while the precocial state usually occurs in species like guinea pigs and porcupines . Females with altricial young typically build elaborate nests before they give birth and maintain them until their offspring are weaned . The female gives birth sitting or lying down and the young emerge in the direction she is facing . The newborns first venture out of the nest a few days after they have opened their eyes and initially keep returning regularly . As they get older and more developed , they visit the nest less often and leave permanently when weaned . 
 In precocial species , the mothers invest little in nest building and some do not build nests at all . The female gives birth standing and the young emerge behind her . Mothers of these species maintain contact with their highly mobile young with maternal contact calls . Though relatively independent and weaned within days , precocial young may continue to nurse and be groomed by their mothers . Rodent litter sizes also vary and females with smaller litters spend more time in the nest than those with larger litters . 
 Mother rodents provide both direct parental care , such as nursing , grooming , retrieving and huddling , and indirect parenting , such as food caching , nest building and protection to their offspring . In many social species , young may be cared for by individuals other then their parents , a practice known as alloparenting or cooperative breeding . This is known to occur in black @-@ tailed prairie dogs and Belding 's ground squirrels , where mothers have communal nests and nurse unrelated young along with their own . There is some question as to whether these mothers can distinguish which young are theirs . In the Patagonian <unk> , young are also placed in communal warrens , but mothers do not permit youngsters other than their own to nurse . 
 Infanticide exists in numerous rodent species and may be practiced by adult conspecifics of either sex . Several reasons have been proposed for this behavior , including nutritional stress , resource competition , avoiding misdirecting parental care and , in the case of males , attempting to make the mother sexually receptive . The latter reason is well supported in primates and lions but less so in rodents . Infanticide appears to be widespread in black @-@ tailed prairie dogs , including infanticide from invading males and immigrant females , as well as occasional cannibalism of an individual 's own offspring . To protect against infanticide from other adults , female rodents may employ avoidance or direct aggression against potential perpetrators , multiple mating , territoriality or early termination of pregnancy . <unk> can also occur among rodents ; in Alpine marmots , dominant females tend to suppress the reproduction of subordinates by being antagonistic towards them while they are pregnant . The resulting stress causes the fetuses to abort . 
 = = = Cognition = = = 
 Rodents have advanced cognitive abilities . They can quickly learn to avoid poisoned baits , which makes them difficult pests to deal with . Guinea pigs can learn and remember complex pathways to food . Squirrels and kangaroo rats are able to locate caches of food by spatial memory , rather than just by smell . 
 Because laboratory mice ( house mice ) and rats ( brown rats ) are widely used as scientific models to further our understanding of biology , a great deal has come to be known about their cognitive capacities . Brown rats exhibit cognitive bias , where information processing is biased by whether they are in a positive or negative affective state . For example , laboratory rats trained to respond to a specific tone by pressing a lever to receive a reward , and to press another lever in response to a different tone so as to avoid receiving an electric shock , are more likely to respond to an intermediate tone by choosing the reward lever if they have just been tickled ( something they enjoy ) , indicating " a link between the directly measured positive affective state and decision making under uncertainty in an animal model . " 
 Laboratory ( brown ) rats may have the capacity for <unk> — to consider their own learning and then make decisions based on what they know , or do not know , as indicated by choices they make apparently trading off difficulty of tasks and expected rewards , making them the first animals other than primates to have this capacity , but these findings are disputed , since the rats may have been following simple operant conditioning principles , or a behavioral economic model . 
 Brown rats use social learning in a wide range of situations , but perhaps especially so in acquiring food preferences . Learning about suitable foods can be divided into four life stages . 
 Before birth : In utero , fetal rats detect odor @-@ bearing particles that come from their mother 's diet and cross the placental barrier . Shortly after birth , newborn rats respond positively to these foods . 
 During nursing : Nursing rats receive information about their mother 's diet through her milk . They prefer the foods she ate during lactation . 
 Weaning : When young rats are weaning and eating solid foods for the first time , they use adult rats as guides . They forage where the adults are foraging or where adults have previously scent @-@ marked . 
 Adolescence and adulthood : When rats forage on their own , their food choices are influenced by social interactions that may take place far away from foraging sites . They smell foods on the fur , whiskers and especially the breath of other rats and strongly prefer the foods those rats had previously eaten . This inclines them not to eat poisons avoided by older rats .

 Dentition is the key feature by which fossil rodents are recognized and the earliest record of such mammals comes from the Paleocene , shortly after the extinction of the non @-@ avian dinosaurs some 66 million years ago . These fossils are found in Laurasia , the supercontinent composed of modern @-@ day North America , Europe , and Asia . The divergence of Glires , a clade consisting of rodents and lagomorphs ( rabbits , hares and pikas ) , from other placental mammals occurred within a few million years after the Cretaceous @-@ Tertiary boundary ; rodents and lagomorphs then radiated during the Cenozoic . Some molecular clock data suggest modern rodents ( members of the order Rodentia ) had appeared by the late Cretaceous , although other molecular divergence estimations are in agreement with the fossil record . 
 Rodents are thought to have evolved in Asia , where local multituberculate faunas were severely affected by the Cretaceous – Paleogene extinction event and never fully recovered , unlike their North American and European relatives . In the resulting ecological vacuum , rodents and other Glires were allowed to evolve and diversify , taking the niches left by extinct multituberculates . The correlation between the spread of rodents and the demise of multituberculates is a controversial topic , not fully resolved . American and European multituberculate assemblages do decline in diversity in correlation with the introduction of rodents in these areas , but the remaining Asian multituberculates co @-@ existed with rodents with no observable replacement taking place , and ultimately both clades co @-@ existed for at least 15 million years . 
 The history of the colonization of the world 's continents by rodents is complex . The movements of the large superfamily Muroidea ( including hamsters , gerbils , true mice and rats ) may have involved up to seven colonizations of Africa , five of North America , four of Southeast Asia , two of South America and up to ten of Eurasia . 
 During the Eocene , rodents began to diversify . Beavers appeared in North America in the late Eocene before spreading to Eurasia . Late in the Eocene , hystricognaths invaded Africa , most probably having originated in Asia at least 39 @.@ 5 million years ago . From Africa , fossil evidence shows that some hystricognaths ( <unk> ) colonized South America , which was an isolated continent at the time , evidently making use of ocean currents to cross the Atlantic on floating debris . <unk> had arrived in South America by 41 million years ago ( implying a date at least as early as this for hystricognaths in Africa ) , and had reached the Greater Antilles by the early Oligocene , suggesting that they must have dispersed rapidly across South America . 
 <unk> rodents are thought to have rafted from Africa to Madagascar 20 – 24 million years ago . All 27 species of native Malagasy rodents appear to be descendents of a single colonization event . 
 By 20 million years ago , fossils recognizably belonging to the current families such as Muridae had emerged . By the Miocene , when Africa had collided with Asia , African rodents such as the porcupine began to spread into Eurasia . Some fossil species were very large in comparison to modern rodents and included the giant beaver , <unk> <unk> , which grew to a length of 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 ft 2 in ) and weight of 100 kg ( 220 lb ) . The largest known rodent was <unk> <unk> , a <unk> with an estimated body length of 3 m ( 10 ft ) . 
 The first rodents arrived in Australia via Indonesia around 5 million years ago . Although marsupials are the most prominent mammals in Australia , many rodents , all belonging to the subfamily <unk> , are among the continent 's mammal species . There are about fifty species of ' old endemics ' , the first wave of rodents to colonize the country in the Miocene and early Pliocene , and eight true rat ( Rattus ) species of ' new endemics ' , arriving in a subsequent wave in the late Pliocene or early Pleistocene . The earliest fossil rodents in Australia have a maximum age of 4 @.@ 5 million years , and molecular data is consistent with the colonization of New Guinea from the west during the late Miocene or early Pliocene followed by rapid diversification . A further wave of adaptive radiation occurred after one or more colonizations of Australia some 2 to 3 million years later . 
 Rodents participated in the Great American Interchange that resulted from the joining of the Americas by formation of the Isthmus of Panama , around 3 million years ago in the <unk> age . In this exchange , a small number of species such as the New World porcupines ( <unk> ) headed north . However , the main southward invasion of sigmodontines preceded formation of the land bridge by at least several million years , probably occurring via rafting . <unk> diversified explosively once in South America , although some degree of diversification may have already occurred in Central America before the colonization . Their " head start " has relegated other North American rodent groups ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> ) to a minor presence in the contemporary South American fauna . 
 = = = Standard classification = = = 
 The use of the order name " Rodentia " is attributed to the English traveler and naturalist Thomas Edward <unk> ( 1821 ) . The Modern Latin word " Rodentia " is derived from " <unk> " , present participle of " rodere " – " to gnaw " , " eat away " . The hares , rabbits and pikas ( order Lagomorpha ) have continuously growing incisors , as do rodents , and were at one time included in the order . However , they have an additional pair of incisors in the upper jaw and the two orders have quite separate evolutionary histories . The phylogeny of the rodents places them in the clades Glires , Euarchontoglires and <unk> . The cladogram below shows the inner and outer relations of Rodentia based on a 2012 attempt by Wu et al. to align the molecular clock with paleontological data : 
 The living rodent families based on the study done by Fabre et al . 2012 . 
 The order Rodentia may be divided into suborders , infraorders , superfamilies and families . There is a great deal of parallelism and convergence among rodents caused by the fact that they have tended to evolve to fill largely similar niches . This parallel evolution includes not only the structure of the teeth , but also the infraorbital region of the skull ( below the eye socket ) and makes classification difficult as similar traits may not be due to common ancestry . Brandt ( 1855 ) was the first to propose dividing Rodentia into three suborders , Sciuromorpha , Hystricomorpha and Myomorpha , based on the development of certain muscles in the jaw and this system was widely accepted . Schlosser ( 1884 ) performed a comprehensive review of rodent fossils , mainly using the cheek teeth , and found that they fitted into the classical system , but <unk> ( 1899 ) proposed just two sub @-@ orders , <unk> and <unk> . These were based on the degree of inflection of the lower jaw and were to be further subdivided into Sciuromorpha , Myomorpha , Hystricomorpha and <unk> . Matthew ( 1910 ) created a phylogenetic tree of New World rodents but did not include the more problematic Old World species . Further attempts at classification continued without agreement , with some authors adopting the classical three suborder system and others <unk> 's two suborders . 
 These disagreements remain unresolved , nor have molecular studies fully resolved the situation though they have confirmed the monophyly of the group and that the clade has descended from a common Paleocene ancestor . Carleton and Musser ( 2005 ) in Mammal Species of the World have provisionally adopted a five suborder system : Sciuromorpha , <unk> , Myomorpha , <unk> , and Hystricomorpha . These include 33 families , 481 genera and 2277 species :

 While rodents are not the most seriously threatened order of mammals , there are 168 species in 126 genera that are said to warrant conservation attention in the face of limited appreciation by the public . Since 76 percent of rodent genera contain only one species , much phylogenetic diversity could be lost with a comparatively small number of extinctions . In the absence of more detailed knowledge of species at risk and accurate taxonomy , conservation must be based mainly on higher taxa ( such as families rather than species ) and geographical hot spots . Several species of rice rat have become extinct since the 19th century , probably through habitat loss and the introduction of alien species . In Colombia , the brown hairy dwarf porcupine was recorded from only two mountain localities in the 1920s , while the red crested soft @-@ furred spiny rat is known only from its type locality on the Caribbean coast , so these species are considered vulnerable . The IUCN Species Survival Commission writes " We can safely conclude that many South American rodents are seriously threatened , mainly by environmental disturbance and intensive hunting " . 
 The " three now cosmopolitan commensal rodent pest species " ( the brown rat , the black rat and the house mouse ) have been dispersed in association with humans , partly on sailing ships in the Age of Exploration , and with a fourth species in the Pacific , the Polynesian rat ( Rattus exulans ) , have severely damaged island biotas around the world . For example , when the black rat reached Lord Howe Island in 1918 , over 40 percent of the terrestrial bird species of the island , including the Lord Howe fantail , became extinct within ten years . Similar destruction has been seen on Midway Island ( 1943 ) and Big South Cape Island ( 1962 ) . Conservation projects can with careful planning completely eradicate these pest rodents from islands using an anticoagulant rodenticide such as brodifacoum . This approach has been successful on the island of Lundy in the United Kingdom , where the eradication of an estimated 40 @,@ 000 brown rats is giving populations of Manx shearwater and Atlantic puffin a chance to recover from near @-@ extinction .

 Humanity has long used animal skins for clothing , as the leather is durable and the fur provides extra insulation . The native people of North America made much use of beaver pelts , tanning and sewing them together to make robes . Europeans appreciated the quality of these and the North American fur trade developed and became of prime importance to early settlers . In Europe , the soft underfur known as " beaver wool " was found to be ideal for felting and was made into beaver hats and trimming for clothing . Later , the coypu took over as a cheaper source of fur for felting and was farmed extensively in America and Europe ; however , fashions changed , new materials became available and this area of the animal fur industry declined . The chinchilla has a soft and silky coat and the demand for its fur was so high that it was nearly wiped out in the wild before farming took over as the main source of pelts . The quills and <unk> of porcupines are used for traditional decorative clothing . For example , their <unk> are used in the creation of the Native American " <unk> roach " headdress . The main quills may be dyed , and then applied in combination with thread to embellish leather accessories such as knife sheaths and leather bags . Lakota women would harvest the quills for <unk> by throwing a blanket over a porcupine and retrieving the quills it left stuck in the blanket . 
 At least 89 species of rodent , mostly Hystricomorpha such as guinea pigs , agoutis and capybaras , are eaten by humans ; in 1985 , there were at least 42 different societies in which people eat rats . Guinea pigs were first raised for food around 2500 B.C. and by 1500 B.C. had become the main source of meat for the Inca Empire . <unk> were raised by the Romans in special pots called " <unk> " , or in large outdoor enclosures , where they were fattened on walnuts , chestnuts , and acorns . The dormice were also caught from the wild in autumn when they were fattest , and either roasted and dipped into honey or baked while stuffed with a mixture of pork , pine nuts , and other flavorings . Researchers found that in Amazonia , where large mammals were scarce , pacas and common agoutis accounted for around 40 percent of the annual game taken by the indigenous people , but in forested areas where larger mammals were abundant , these rodents constituted only about 3 percent of the take . 
 Guinea pigs are used in the cuisine of Cuzco , Peru , in dishes such as cuy al <unk> , baked guinea pig . The traditional Andean stove , known as a <unk> or a <unk> , is made from mud and clay reinforced with straw and hair from animals such as guinea pigs . In Peru , there are at any time 20 million domestic guinea pigs , which annually produce 64 million edible carcasses . This animal is an excellent food source since the flesh is 19 % protein . In the United States , mostly squirrels , but also muskrats , porcupines , and ground hogs are eaten by humans . The Navajo people ate prairie dog baked in mud , while the Paiute ate gophers , squirrels , and rats . 
 Rodents including guinea pigs , mice , rats , hamsters , gerbils , chinchillas , degus and chipmunks make convenient pets able to live in small spaces , each species with its own qualities . Most are normally kept in cages of suitable sizes and have varied requirements for space and social interaction . If handled from a young age , they are usually docile and do not bite . Guinea pigs have a long lifespan and need a large cage . Rats also need plenty of space and can become very tame , can learn tricks and seem to enjoy human companionship . Mice are short @-@ lived but take up very little space . Hamsters are solitary but tend to be nocturnal . They have interesting behaviors , but unless handled regularly they may be defensive . Gerbils are not usually aggressive , rarely bite and are sociable animals that enjoy the company of humans and their own kind . 
 Rodents are used widely as model organisms in animal testing . Albino mutant rats were first used for research in 1828 and later became the first animal domesticated for purely scientific purposes . Nowadays , the house mouse is the most commonly used laboratory rodent , and in 1979 it was estimated that fifty million were used annually worldwide . They are favored because of their small size , fertility , short gestation period and ease of handling and because they are susceptible to many of the conditions and infections that afflict humans . They are used in research into genetics , developmental biology , cell biology , oncology and immunology . Guinea pigs were popular laboratory animals until the late 20th century ; about 2 @.@ 5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the United States for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375 @,@ 000 by the mid @-@ 1990s . In 2007 , they constituted about 2 % of all laboratory animals . Guinea pigs played a major role in the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century , through the experiments of Louis Pasteur , Émile Roux , and Robert Koch . They have been launched into orbital space flight several times — first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9 , 1961 , with a successful recovery . The naked mole rat is the only known mammal that is poikilothermic ; it is used in studies on thermoregulation . It is also unusual in not producing the neurotransmitter substance P , a fact which researchers find useful in studies on pain . 
 Rodents have sensitive olfactory abilities , which have been used by humans to detect odors or chemicals of interest . The Gambian pouched rat is able to detect tuberculosis bacilli with a sensitivity of up to 86 @.@ 6 % , and specificity ( detecting the absence of the bacilli ) of over 93 % ; the same species has been trained to detect land mines . Rats have been studied for possible use in hazardous situations such as in disaster zones . They can be trained to respond to commands , which may be given remotely , and even persuaded to venture into brightly lit areas , which rats usually avoid . 
 = = = As pests and disease vectors = = = 
 Some rodent species are serious agricultural pests , eating large quantities of food stored by humans . For example , in 2003 , the amount of rice lost to mice and rats in Asia was estimated to be enough to feed 200 million people . Most of the damage worldwide is caused by a relatively small number of species , chiefly rats and mice . In Indonesia and Tanzania , rodents reduce crop yields by around fifteen percent , while in some instances in South America losses have reached ninety percent . Across Africa , rodents including Mastomys and <unk> damage cereals , groundnuts , vegetables and cacao . In Asia , rats , mice and species such as Microtus <unk> , Meriones <unk> and <unk> baileyi damage crops of rice , sorghum , tubers , vegetables and nuts . In Europe , as well as rats and mice , species of Apodemus , Microtus and in occasional outbreaks Arvicola terrestris cause damage to orchards , vegetables and pasture as well as cereals . In South America , a wider range of rodent species , such as Holochilus , Akodon , Calomys , Oligoryzomys , Phyllotis , Sigmodon and Zygodontomys , damage many crops including sugar cane , fruits , vegetables , and tubers . 
 Rodents are also significant vectors of disease . The black rat , with the fleas that it carries , plays a primary role in spreading the bacterium Yersinia pestis responsible for bubonic plague , and carries the organisms responsible for typhus , Weil 's disease , toxoplasmosis and trichinosis . A number of rodents carry hantaviruses , including the <unk> , Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses , which can infect humans . Rodents also help to transmit diseases including <unk> , cutaneous leishmaniasis , human <unk> anaplasmosis , Lyme disease , Omsk hemorrhagic fever , <unk> virus , <unk> , relapsing fever , Rocky Mountain spotted fever , and West Nile virus . 
 Because rodents are a nuisance and endanger public health , human societies often attempt to control them . Traditionally , this involved poisoning and trapping , methods that were not always safe or effective . More recently , integrated pest management attempts to improve control with a combination of surveys to determine the size and distribution of the pest population , the establishment of tolerance limits ( levels of pest activity at which to intervene ) , interventions , and evaluation of effectiveness based on repeated surveys . Interventions may include education , making and applying laws and regulations , modifying the habitat , changing farming practices , and biological control using pathogens or predators , as well as poisoning and trapping . The use of pathogens such as Salmonella has the drawback that they can infect man and domestic animals , and rodents often become resistant . The use of predators including ferrets , mongooses and monitor lizards has been found unsatisfactory . Domestic and feral cats are able to control rodents effectively , provided the rodent population is not too large . In the UK , two species in particular , the house mouse and the brown rat , are actively controlled to limit damage in growing crops , loss and contamination of stored crops and structural damage to facilities , as well as to comply with the law . 
 = 1962 National League tie @-@ breaker series = 
 The 1962 National League tie @-@ breaker series was a three @-@ game playoff series at the conclusion of Major League Baseball 's ( MLB ) 1962 regular season to determine the winner of the National League ( NL ) pennant . The games were played from October 1 to 3 , 1962 , between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants . The Giants won the series , two games to one . The first game took place at Candlestick Park and the second and third were played at Dodger Stadium . The playoff series was necessary after both teams finished the season with identical win – loss records of 101 – 61 . The Dodgers won a coin flip late in the season , which gave them home field advantage for the series . 
 The Giants won the first game in an 8 – 0 shutout by starting pitcher Billy Pierce over Sandy Koufax . The Dodgers evened the series with an 8 – 7 victory in Game 2 , breaking their 35 @-@ inning scoreless streak in what was then the longest nine @-@ inning game in MLB history . However , the Giants closed out the series in Game 3 with a 6 – 4 victory to clinch the NL pennant . This victory advanced the Giants to the 1962 World Series in which the defending champion New York Yankees defeated them in seven games . In baseball statistics , the tie @-@ breaker series counted as the 163rd , 164th , and 165th regular @-@ season games for both teams , with all events in the series added to regular @-@ season statistics . The 1962 series was the last MLB tie @-@ breaker to use a three @-@ game format , as the NL subsequently adopted the single @-@ game style used in the American League ( AL ) . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Dodgers and the Giants finished the 1961 season second and third respectively in the NL , with records of 89 – 65 and 85 – 69 . In an offseason trade with the Chicago White Sox the Giants acquired Billy Pierce and Don Larsen for Bob Farley , Eddie Fisher , Dom Zanni , and Verle <unk> . The Dodgers moved to a new home field , Dodger Stadium , for the 1962 season . 
 The Giants opened the 1962 season by establishing an early lead and , though they fell back by mid @-@ April , held at least a share of that lead continuously from April 28 to June 7 . At that point the Dodgers overtook the Giants , and for the next month the lead was traded between the two sides five times . The Giants held the lead for the last time on July 7 . The Dodgers went 20 – 6 in July while the Giants went 16 – 11 , allowing the Dodgers to take the league lead on July 8 and hold it until season 's last regular game . The Los Angeles Times described the Dodgers ' season as a " gamut of sublime " and " ridiculous " , noting their successes — such as Maury Wills ' 100 stolen bases breaking Ty Cobb 's single @-@ season record , Don Drysdale 's 25 wins , and Sandy Koufax 's no @-@ hitter on June 30 — together with problems such as the 18 unearned runs the defense had allowed for the season behind Drysdale , and other fielding issues . 
 The Dodgers lost 10 of their final 13 games from September 16 to 30 , while the Giants lost just 6 over the same span . However , with seven games remaining the Dodgers were still ahead in the league by four games , and held a two @-@ game lead with three left to play . They entered their final game with a one @-@ game lead over the Giants , but fell 1 – 0 to the St. Louis Cardinals . Meanwhile , the Giants won 2 – 1 over the Houston Colt .45 's , after an eighth @-@ inning home run by Willie Mays . These results left the Dodgers and Giants tied in the league at 101 – 61 , necessitating a tie @-@ breaker to decide the NL pennant . The two teams had also played closely against one another during the regular season to this point , with each winning 9 of their 18 match @-@ ups prior to the tie @-@ breaker . Dodgers ' manager Walt Alston and Giants ' manager Alvin Dark could not agree on dates and sites for the tie @-@ breaker , so they flipped a coin to decide home field advantage . Alston won the flip , opting to play the first game in San Francisco and the remaining two games in Los Angeles . The Dodgers had been more successful at home in the season , holding a 53 – 28 ( .654 winning percentage ) record there while going 47 – 34 ( <unk> ) on the road . Alston had also won the flip for the 1959 tie @-@ breaker , which the Dodgers had gone on to win , and had chosen the same format .

 Sandy Koufax had missed two months of the season , not starting from July 17 until September 21 . He started three games in his return prior to the tie @-@ breaker , losing all three and pitching just seven @-@ and @-@ two @-@ thirds innings across the three starts . The night before the first game of the tiebreaker , Walt Alston asked Koufax to start the game , as Don Drysdale and Johnny Podres , the Dodgers ' two front line starting pitchers , had pitched the prior two days ; Koufax agreed . In the game the Giants were the first to score , on a double by Felipe Alou in the bottom of the first inning , followed by a home run by Willie Mays to make the score 2 – 0 . Billy Pierce quickly retired three Dodgers in order for the second consecutive inning and the Giants continued to hit in the bottom of the second inning .

Koufax was then relieved by Ed Roebuck , having allowed three runs in the game without recording an out in the second inning . 
 Roebuck recorded three straight outs to end the inning without further scoring . The Dodgers and the Giants each managed a single in their halves of the third inning . Neither Pierce nor Roebuck allowed a baserunner in the fourth or fifth innings , though the Giants further added to their lead in the sixth . The Dodgers pinch hit for Roebuck to lead off the top of the inning with Ken McMullen and although he singled he did not score . Larry Sherry entered to pitch for the Dodgers in the bottom of the inning and after recording the first out he allowed back @-@ to @-@ back home runs to Mays and Orlando Cepeda to give the Giants a 5 – 0 lead . Davenport then singled and Sherry was relieved by Jack Smith who finished the inning without further damage . 
 The game continued without scoring until the eighth inning . The Dodgers managed to get their second runner in scoring position as Doug Camilli pinch hit for Smith , but they did not score . Phil Ortega entered to pitch for the Dodgers in the bottom of the eighth and the Giants continued their offensive performance . Willie Mays walked to open the inning and then stole second base with one out . Davenport and Bailey both walked to load the bases and José Pagán doubled to empty the bases and make the game 8 – 0 . Pierce remained in the game to pitch the ninth , finishing his complete game shutout . Koufax later said of his Game 1 performance , " I had nothing at all . "

 The Giants scored first for the second consecutive game , as Orlando Cepeda singled with one out in the second inning and scored on a double by Felipe Alou against Dodgers ' starter Don Drysdale . The Giants then extended their lead in the top of the sixth inning . Alou struck out to open the inning but Tom Haller then walked and advanced to third base on a double by José Pagán . Giants ' starter Jack Sanford then reached based on a throwing error by Drysdale , which also allowed Haller to score and advanced Pagán to third base . Chuck Hiller and Jim Davenport followed this with successive singles which scored Pagán and Sanford respectively . This made the score 4 – 0 in favor of the Giants with Hiller on second and Sanford on first , still with only one out in the inning . Ed Roebuck entered in relief of Drysdale , inducing an out at second base on a groundball by Willie Mays , to leave runners at the corners with two outs . Willie McCovey singled , allowing Hiller to score and make the game 5 – 0 ; Cepeda was then retired to end the inning . 
 Jack Sanford had allowed just four baserunners through his first five innings , only one of whom reached scoring position . However , after he walked Jim Gilliam to open the bottom of the sixth inning , Giants ' manager Alvin Dark double switched to bring Stu Miller in to relieve Sanford , and replaced McCovey in left field with Matty Alou . After the game Dark explained his decision to remove his thus far successful pitcher : " Sanford was suffering from a cold and he was pooped . " Duke Snider doubled , advancing Gilliam to third . Tommy Davis then hit a sacrifice fly , scoring Gilliam and advancing Snider . This run made the game 5 – 1 and ended what had been a 35 consecutive scoreless inning stretch by the Dodgers . The Dodgers increased their score as Wally Moon walked and Frank Howard singled , to bring Snider home and make the game 5 – 2 . Billy O 'Dell relieved Miller and Doug Camilli , who was pinch hitting for John Roseboro , singled to load the bases . Andy Carey then pinch hit for Willie Davis and was hit by a pitch to score Moon . The Dodgers continued substituting players , pinch hitting Lee Walls for Roebuck and bringing in Larry Burright to pinch run for Carey . Walls then hit a double which emptied the bases , giving the Dodgers a 6 – 5 lead in the game , and advanced to third base on the throw . 
 Walls ' double continued his success as a pinch hitter , making him 13 @-@ for @-@ 26 with 12 runs batted in in such situations for the season . Don Larsen entered to relieve O 'Dell , who had not recorded an out but had earned a blown save for his performance . Maury Wills hit a ground ball to the first baseman , who threw home in an attempt to put out Walls who slid hard into the Giants ' catcher Haller . The slide , which cut Haller 's arm deep enough to later require six stitches , caused him to drop the ball , leaving Walls safe on Haller 's error and extending the Dodgers ' lead to 7 – 5 . John Orsino entered as the new catcher to replace the injured Haller . Wills then stole second , his 101st stolen base of the season , before the batter Gilliam saw a single pitch . Orsino 's throw to try to catch Wills went past second base and into center field . Wills attempted to advance to third , but was thrown out by Willie Mays . Larsen then induced a flyball out by Gilliam and the inning was over . Between the two halves of the sixth the two teams had scored a combined 11 runs and used six pitchers , three pinch hitters , two defensive replacements , and a pinch runner . 
 Ron Perranoski entered as the new pitcher for the seventh , Camilli took his place as the new catcher , and Ron Fairly replaced Wally Moon at first base . Burright became the new second baseman , replacing Gilliam who moved to third base while the previous third baseman , Tommy Davis , moved to center field . Perranoski allowed singles to Orsino and Pagán after a ground out by Felipe Alou . The Giants pinch hit Harvey Kuenn for Matty Alou and Bob Nieman for Hiller , but both recorded outs to end the top of the seventh . Ernie Bowman replaced Nieman at second base for the Giants in the bottom of the inning and no runs scored in the frame . The Giants continued to hit Perranoski in the top of the eighth , with singles by Davenport and Mays to open the inning . Jack Smith entered in relief but allowed a single to Ed Bailey pinch hitting for Larsen which scored Davenport to cut the Dodgers ' lead to 7 – 6 . Mays attempted to advance to third on the play but was called out . The play drew arguments from Mays , Alvin Dark , and third base coach Whitey Lockman as third base umpire Jocko Conlan appeared to call Mays safe before changing it to out . Carl Boles pinch ran for Bailey , and Cepeda reached on an error on his fly ball which allowed Boles to move to third . Stan Williams relieved Smith and walked Felipe Alou to load the bases . Orsino hit a sacrifice fly to tie the game at seven runs apiece and Pagán grounded out to end the inning . 
 Bobby Bolin entered as the new pitcher for the Giants in the bottom of the eighth . Bolin kept the game tied , as did Williams who pitched a perfect top of the ninth inning . Wills walked to leadoff the bottom of the ninth , however , and Dick LeMay relieved Bolin . Gilliam then also walked , advancing Wills to second . The Dodgers announced Daryl Spencer as a pinch hitter for Snider and the Giants countered by bringing Gaylord Perry in relief of LeMay . Spencer laid down a successful sacrifice bunt , advancing the two runners to second and third base . The play drew comment after the game , as some writers believed Perry had a chance to throw to third base to put out the lead runner Wills . He threw to first instead , allowing the sacrifice . Mike McCormick relieved Perry , intentionally walked Tommy Davis , and then allowed a game @-@ winning walk @-@ off sacrifice fly to Fairly driving in Wills . Game 2 lasted 4 hours and 18 minutes , breaking the previous record of 4 hours and 2 minutes for the longest 9 @-@ inning game in major league history . Coincidentally Wills , who scored the winning run , celebrated his 30th birthday on the same day as Game 2 .

 Game 3 matched the Giants ' Juan Marichal against Johnny Podres , though Dodgers ' manager Walt Alston had considered starting reliever Larry Sherry . The pair kept the game scoreless through two innings before the Giants opened the scoring in the top of the third . José Pagán singled to lead off the inning , Marichal reached on a throwing error by the pitcher on a throw to second base which allowed Pagán to move to third , and Pagán scored on a Harvey Kuenn single . Then , while Chuck Hiller was batting , John Roseboro made an error in attempting to pickoff Marichal on second base , allowing him to advance to third . Hiller hit a fly ball to shallow left field and Marichal held at third base . Left fielder Duke Snider threw home but the ball was cut off by the third baseman , who threw to second to try to catch Kuenn in a rundown between first and second . However , the second baseman 's throw to first hit Kuenn in the back , leaving him safe at first and allowing Marichal to score , to make the game 2 – 0 . Felipe Alou then singled , Kuenn went to third , and Alou advanced to second on the throw . Podres intentionally walked Willie Mays to load the bases with one out , and induced a double play from Orlando Cepeda to end the inning . 
 The Dodgers cut into the lead in the fourth , as Snider doubled to leadoff , advanced to third on a Tommy Davis single , and scored on a groundout by Frank Howard . The Giants threatened against Podres in the top of the sixth with singles by Cepeda , Ed Bailey , and Jim Davenport on a bunt to load the bases . However , Ed Roebuck relieved Podres and escaped the inning without allowing a run . The Dodgers took a 3 – 2 lead in the bottom of the inning as Snider singled and scored on a home run by Tommy Davis . They extended this lead in the bottom of the seventh as Wills singled and then stole second as Jim Gilliam batted . Manager Alvin Dark had chosen not to try to hold Wills to the first base bag as Dark did not believe his Giants ' defense could stop Wills from stealing regardless of their positioning . Gilliam was put out for the second out of the inning , but Wills stole third base and then scored on a throwing error by the catcher trying to catch him . This extended the Dodgers ' lead to 4 – 2 . The Dodgers further threatened in the bottom of the eighth . Don Larsen entered in relief of Marichal midway through Davis ' at bat but Davis walked to lead off the inning regardless . Ron Fairly sacrificed him to second base and Davis then stole third as Howard struck out . However , Larsen intentionally walked both Roseboro and Willie Davis to load the bases and induced a ground out by Roebuck to end the inning . 
 The Giants took the decisive lead in the top of the ninth inning . Matty Alou pinch hit for Larsen and singled to lead off the inning and Kuenn grounded into a force out at second base . Willie McCovey pinch hit for Hiller and walked to advance Kuenn . Ernie Bowman pinch ran for McCovey and Felipe Alou walked to load the bases . Mays hit a line drive single scoring Kuenn . Roebuck barely managed to knock the ball down to hold Mays to a single and Mays said he was " still mad " after the game because he had expected more off of the hit . Stan Williams relieved Roebuck and Cepeda hit a sacrifice fly to tie the game at 4 – 4 and advance Alou to third . Mays moved to second on a wild pitch to Bailey and Williams intentionally walked him to reload the bases . Williams walked Davenport to give the Giants a 5 – 4 lead , and they added to it as Pagán reached on an error by second baseman Larry Burright allowing Mays to score and extend the lead to 6 – 4 . Billy Pierce pitched a perfect bottom of the ninth to end the game , earning his only save of the season . Had the Dodgers not yielded the lead in the final inning they instead would have earned a postseason berth , their first since winning the pennant via a tie @-@ breaker in 1959 .

 The Giants ' win earned the franchise its 17th playoff berth , the first since moving to San Francisco from New York in 1958 . In the playoffs they faced the New York Yankees in the 1962 World Series which they lost in seven games , ending the Giants ' season . They returned to the playoffs in 1971 and the World Series in 1989 and 2002 . In 2010 , the Giants won their first World Series since moving to San Francisco . The Dodgers returned to the World Series in 1963 and swept the Yankees . The Dodgers set a new attendance record in 1962 , topping the previous mark of 2 @,@ 641 @,@ 845 set by the Cleveland Indians in 1948 with a total of 2 @,@ 755 @,@ 184 fans . Game 2 was the longest nine @-@ inning game in MLB history with a time of 4 hours and 18 minutes , a record which stood until April 30 , 1996 when a game between the Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles lasted 4 hours and 21 minutes . The record was again broken on August 18 , 2006 during a game in which the Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox 14 – 11 in 4 hours and 45 minutes . 
 In baseball statistics tie @-@ breakers count as regular season games , with all events in them added to regular season statistics . For example , Willie Mays extended his league @-@ leading home run total to 49 and Maury Wills raised his record @-@ breaking stolen base total from 100 to 104 , the most since 1900 . Additionally Wills , José Pagán , and Tommy Davis played in 165 , 164 , and 163 games respectively , totals which could not have been matched by players not on the Dodgers or Giants . Wills also won the NL Most Valuable Player Award narrowly over Mays , with Davis placing third in the voting . Don Drysdale won both the Cy Young and Sporting News Pitcher of the Year awards and Jim Davenport , Wills , and Mays each won Rawlings Gold Glove Awards . MLB played two All @-@ Star Games in 1962 . Four Dodgers and five Giants were named to the first while four Dodgers and four Giants played in the second . Five future Hall of Famers were on the Giants roster in 1962 ( Cepeda , Marichal , Mays , McCovey , and Perry ) while the Dodgers had three ( Drysdale , Koufax , and Snider ) . Dodgers ' manager Walt Alston was also inducted to the Hall as a manager in 1983 . Additionally , this 1962 series was the last MLB tie @-@ breaker to use the three @-@ game series format . The AL had always used a one @-@ game format and all future NL tie @-@ breakers were played in that format as well .

 " Mars , Bars " features a story by Phil Klemmer , John Enbom , and Joe Voci and a teleplay by Klemmer and Enbom , marking Klemmer 's fourteenth installment of the series , Enbom 's fifteenth episode for the show , and Voci 's second and final writing credit ( after " Postgame Mortem " ) . It was directed by Harry Winer , marking his fifth and final directing credit for Veronica Mars , after " Meet John Smith " , " Blast from the Past " , " Wichita Linebacker " , and " Of Vice and Men " . The scene on the beach was the work of Winer , whom Thomas referred to as a " visual stylist " . He enjoyed the scene for showing Neptune as a California beach town while distinguishing itself due to the cold weather , a visual characteristic that he felt was not portrayed often enough . 
 " Mars , Bars " features the reappearance of the character of Bronson , who had previously appeared in " Show Me the Monkey " . Mac loses her virginity to Bronson in the episode . However , the writers had initially planned a storyline in which Mac would be taken advantage of by a professor due to her fragile emotional state following her romance with Beaver ( Kyle Gallner ) . However , the storyline was removed , partially due to the fact that Thomas and the crew wanted Mac to have something positive happen to her . Prior to the filming of this episode , Thomas counseled Jason Dohring and Julie Gonzalo , who play Logan and Parker , respectively , on the two characters ' interpersonal chemistry in the episode . Specifically , he did not want them to make their flirting obvious , but rather give " a whiff of connection " .

 This episode marks the final appearance of series regular Michael Muhney , who plays Don Lamb on the show , after his character is bludgeoned to death by Steve Botando , played by Richard Grieco . Muhney did not know about his character 's death until receiving the script for the episode . This was roughly six weeks before the episode 's airing and during filming . Muhney did not know the rationale for killing the character , but when he found out , he stated that " I felt like a piece of me was dying as well . " He also stated that he was also heartbroken because he had grown attached to the character over the course of three years playing him . Muhney also expressed surprise over the writing decision . 
 Because the crew shoots scenes out of order , the last scene that Muhney filmed was the one in which Keith offers to help Lamb in investigating the break @-@ in at the O 'Dell residence . He enjoyed acting with Grieco , calling him " very approachable . " He was also pleased with the character 's sendoff , stating that it was appropriate . He wished that he had more time to say farewells to each cast and crew member individually . Lamb 's last words were " I smell bread " ; Muhney explained that it was a reference to a minor character death on M * A * S * H. He stated that it was an in @-@ joke among the crew and that the words had " no significance within the borders of Neptune . " However , Muhney thought of it as his character 's last burst of sarcasm . 
 The reveal of Sheriff Lamb 's death was not leaked anywhere online prior to the airing of " Mars , Bars " , something about which Muhney was happy . He stated that " the surprise was the best part " and that he disliked it when spoilers from other series were released early . After the episode 's initial airing , Muhney reported that his inbox was flooded with emails from press members seeking interviews , stating that new messages came after the airing in each U.S. time zone . Some fans were upset about his death , and debate occurred online . However , Muhney also received messages of support for the character , commenting " it 's nice to know that he will be missed . " With the announcement of the Veronica Mars film in 2013 , Zap2it speculated that Muhney might return ; however , this was later revealed not to be the case when the official casting was announced . Thomas praised Daran Norris 's performance in the episode , particularly his voice in the scene in which he defends Steve Botando in front of Sheriff Lamb . Thomas noted that Norris was also a voice actor and that he was particularly well @-@ liked on the set for his humorous performances .

 The episode received generally positive reviews from television critics . Eric Goldman , writing for IGN , gave the episode an 8 @.@ 8 out of 10 , indicating that it was " great " . He referred to " Mars , Bars " as one of the finest episodes of season three , praising the Valentine 's Day subplot , the development of the mystery of Dean O 'Dell 's death , and Muhney 's performance . Regarding Logan , he opined that although he did not like him moping after his breakup with Veronica , this episode fixed that by including him in the Valentine 's Day subplot and setting up a romantic relationship with Parker : " it 's just a huge relief to see Logan in a different light and interacting with different people , finally . " He also praised Lamb 's death scene as being devoid of clichés by not giving him an act of heroism for his dying moments . Reviewer Alan Sepinwall , on his blog What 's Alan Watching ? , lauded the episode . He saw the episode and the previous episode as a return to form for Veronica Mars , writing , " it 's episodes like these last two that remind me of what this show looks like when it 's really cooking . " He also enjoyed the lack of a redemptive moment for Lamb at the end of his life as well as the comedic value of some scenes in the episode . 
 BuddyTV wrote that " Mars , Bars " was an example of the best the series could get . The reviewer praised all of the interconnecting subplots , Jason Dohring 's performance , and the episode 's pacing , writing , " Anybody who was <unk> over the slow pace of the last few weeks of Veronica Mars got a huge payoff tonight . " Rowan Kaiser , writing for The A.V. Club , gave a mixed review . While he was positive towards Lamb 's death , he criticized the subplot involving Mac , Logan , Parker , and Bronson . Regarding Lamb , he opined that it made him realize how much he had enjoyed the role ; however , he thought that " knowing that the show is almost finished limits its impact . " He was positive towards Keith 's role in the episode but referred to the Valentine 's Day plot as out of character for the show for its happy feel . " It 's cute . And cuteness in an episode with the shocking death of a recurring character seems out of place . " Television Without Pity graded the episode a " B " . 
 BuddyTV also ranked Sheriff Lamb 's death 7th on its list of the seven saddest TV deaths of 2007 . On a ranking of all 64 Veronica Mars episodes , Anais <unk> of BuzzFeed ranked the episode 13th . After the series was announced as being cancelled by The CW , fans collectively sent nearly 10 @,@ 000 Mars bars to Dawn Ostroff , the president of the network as a reference to the show , but the attempt was futile . 
 = Disintegration ( The Cure album ) = 
 Disintegration is the eighth studio album by British alternative rock band The Cure , released on 2 May 1989 by Fiction Records . The record marks a return to the introspective and gloomy gothic rock style the band had established in the early 1980s . As he neared the age of thirty , vocalist and guitarist Robert Smith had felt an increased pressure to follow up on the group 's pop successes with a more enduring work . This , coupled with a distaste for the group 's newfound popularity , caused Smith to lapse back into the use of hallucinogenic drugs , the effects of which had a strong influence on the production of the album . The Cure recorded Disintegration at Hookend Recording Studios in <unk> , Oxfordshire , with co @-@ producer David M. Allen from late 1988 to early 1989 . During production , founding member Lol Tolhurst was fired from the band . 
 Disintegration became the band 's commercial peak , charting at number three in the United Kingdom and at number twelve in the United States , and producing several hit singles including " Lovesong " , which peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 . It remains The Cure 's highest selling record to date , with more than three million copies sold worldwide . It was greeted with a warm critical reception before later being acclaimed , eventually being placed at number 326 on Rolling Stone magazine 's list of the " 500 Greatest Albums of All Time " . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it the " culmination of all the musical directions The Cure were pursuing over the course of the ' 80s " . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Cure 's second album Seventeen Seconds ( 1980 ) established the group as a prominent gothic rock band characterised by what Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described as " slow , gloomy dirges and Smith 's ghoulish appearance " . Three singles were released during 1982 and 1983 that were a significant divergence in style for The Cure ; essentially , pop hits . " The Love Cats " became The Cure 's first single to infiltrate the top ten in the United Kingdom , peaking at number seven . This shift is attributed to Smith 's frustration over the band 's labeling as a predictable gothic rock band : " My reaction to all those people ... was to make a demented and calculated song like ' Let 's Go to Bed ' . " Following the return of guitarist Porl Thompson and bassist Simon Gallup in 1984 and the addition of drummer Boris Williams in 1985 , Smith and keyboardist Lol Tolhurst continued to integrate more pop @-@ oriented themes with the release of the group 's sixth studio album The Head on the Door ( 1985 ) . With the singles " In @-@ Between Days " and " Close to Me " , The Cure became a viable commercial force in the United States for the first time . 
 The band 's 1987 double album Kiss Me , Kiss Me , Kiss Me resulted in further commercial success , with a sold @-@ out world tour booked in its wake . Despite the success , internal friction became prevalent . Tolhurst began to consume heavy amounts of alcohol , rendering him useless . Roger O 'Donnell was hired as a second keyboardist to pick up the slack . O 'Donnell quickly realised that Tolhurst was essentially dead weight : " I couldn 't see why [ Tolhurst ] was in the band . He could have afforded to hire a tutor and have daily lessons , but he wasn 't interested in practicing . He just liked being in the group . " The rest of the band was equally unimpressed . As Tolhurst 's alcohol consumption increased , Smith recalled that his behaviour was similar to that of " some kind of handicapped child being constantly poked with a stick " . At the end of the Kissing Tour in support of Kiss Me , Kiss Me , Kiss Me , Smith became uncomfortable with the side effects of being a pop star and moved to Maida Vale ( in West London ) with fiancée Mary Poole . Regularly taking LSD to cope with his depression , Smith once again felt The Cure was being misunderstood and sought to return to the band 's dark side with their next record . 
 = = Recording and production = = 
 Robert Smith 's depression prior to the recording of Disintegration gave way to the realisation on his twenty @-@ ninth birthday that he would turn thirty in one year . This realisation was frightening to him , as he felt all the masterpieces in rock and roll had been completed well before the band members reached such an age . Smith consequently began to write music without the rest of the band . The material he had written instantly took a dismal , depressing form , which he credited to " the fact that I was gonna be thirty " . The Cure convened at Boris Williams ' home in the summer of 1988 where Smith played his bandmates the demos he had recorded . If they had not liked the material , he was prepared to record them as a solo album : " I would have been quite happy to have made these songs on my own . If the group hadn 't thought it was right , that would have been fine . " His bandmates liked the demos and began playing along . The group recorded thirty two songs at Williams ' house with a 16 @-@ track recorder by the end of the summer . 
 When the band entered Hook End Manor Studios in Oxfordshire , their attitude had turned sour towards Tolhurst 's escalating alcohol abuse , although Smith insisted that his displeasure was caused by a meltdown in the face of recording The Cure 's career @-@ defining album and reaching thirty . Displeased with the swollen egos he believed his bandmates possessed , Smith entered what he considered to be " one of my non @-@ talking modes " deciding " I would be monk @-@ like and not talk to anyone . It was a bit pretentious really , looking back , but I actually wanted an environment that was slightly unpleasant " . He sought to abandon the mood present on Kiss Me , Kiss Me , Kiss Me and the pop singles they had released , and rather recreate the atmosphere of the band 's fourth album Pornography ( 1982 ) . 
 Tolhurst , meanwhile , was becoming a nuisance . The band found him impossible to work with , and he spent most of the recording process drunk and watching MTV . The members of the band , except for Smith , would taunt and physically abuse Tolhurst simply to get a reaction . Smith recalls that Tolhurst turned into someone he did not recognise : " I didn 't know who he was any more and he didn 't know who he was either . I used to despair and scream at the others because it was fucking insane the way we were treating him . " At that point , Smith was allowing Tolhurst to remain in The Cure simply because he felt an obligation as an old friend . The other band members , finally , threatened to quit if Tolhurst was not fired before the end of the recording session . When Tolhurst arrived to the mixing of the album excessively drunk , a shouting match ensued and he left the building furious ; this effectively terminated his tenure with The Cure . Smith and the rest of the group confirm he contributed nothing to the record . Thereafter , O 'Donnell became an integral member of The Cure , instead of simply a touring musician . Despite Tolhurst 's ejection from the group , Smith told NME in April 1989 , " He 'll probably be back by Christmas . He 's getting married , maybe that 's his comeback . " Tolhurst only returned briefly around 2011 .

 Disintegration was Robert Smith 's thematic return to a dark and gloomy aesthetic that The Cure had explored in the early 1980s . Smith deliberately sought to record an album that was depressing , as it was a reflection of the despondency he felt at the time . The sound of the album was a shock to the band 's American label Elektra Records ; the label requested Smith shift the release date back several months . Smith recalled " they thought I was being ' wilfully obscure ' , which was an actual quote from the letter [ Smith received from Elektra ] . Ever since then I realised that record companies don 't have a fucking clue what The Cure does and what The Cure means . " Despite rumours that Smith was one of the only contributors to the record , he confirmed that more than half of the dozen tracks on Disintegration had substantial musical input from the rest of the band . 
 Disintegration is characterized by a significant usage of synthesizers and keyboards , slow , " droning " guitar progressions and Smith 's introspective vocals . " Plainsong " , the album 's opener , " set the mood for Disintegration perfectly " , according to journalist Jeff Apter , by " unravelling ever so slowly in a shower of synths and guitars , before Smith steps up to the mic , uttering snatches of lyrics ( ' I 'm so cold ' ) as if he were reading from something as sacred as the Dead Sea Scroll . " Smith felt the song was a perfect opener for the record , describing it as " very lush , very orchestral " . The album 's third track , " Closedown " , contains layers of keyboard texture complemented with a slow , gloomy guitar line . The track was written by Smith as a means to list his physical and artistic shortcomings . Despite the dark mood present throughout Disintegration , " Lovesong " was an upbeat track that became a hit in the United States . Ned Raggett of AllMusic noted the difference from other songs : " the Simon Gallup / Boris Williams rhythm section create a tight , serviceable dance groove , while Smith and Porl Thompson add further guitar fills and filigrees as well , adding just enough extra bite to the song . Smith himself delivers the lyric softly , with gentle passion . " 
 Much of the album made use of a considerable amount of guitar effects . " Prayers for Rain " , a depressing track ( Raggett noted : " the phrase ' savage torpor ' probably couldn 't better be applied anywhere else than to this song " ) sees Thompson and Smith " treating their work to heavy duty flanging , delay , backwards @-@ run tapes and more to set the slow , moody crawl of the track . " Others , like the title track , are notable for " Smith 's commanding lead guitar lines [ that are ] scaled to epic heights while at the same time buried in the mix , almost as if they 're trying to burst from behind the upfront rhythm assault . Roger O 'Donnell 's keyboards add both extra shade and melody , while Smith 's singing is intentionally delivered in a combination of cutting clarity and low resignation , at times further distorted with extra vocal treatments . " 
 While Disintegration mainly consists of sombre tracks , " Lovesong " , " Pictures of You " and " Lullaby " were equally popular for their accessibility . Smith wanted to create a balance on the album by including songs that would act as an equilibrium with those that were unpleasant . Smith wrote " Lovesong " as a wedding present for Mary Poole . The lyrics had a noticeably different mood than the rest of the record , but Smith felt it was an integral component of Disintegration : " It 's an open show of emotion . It 's not trying to be clever . It 's taken me ten years to reach the point where I feel comfortable singing a very straightforward love song . " The lyrics were a notable shift in his ability to reveal affection . In the past , Smith felt it necessary to disguise or mask such a statement . He noted that without " Lovesong " , Disintegration would have been radically different : " That one song , I think , makes many people think twice . If that song wasn 't on the record , it would be very easy to dismiss the album as having a certain mood . But throwing that one in sort of upsets people a bit because they think , ' That doesn 't fit ' . " " Pictures of You " , while upbeat , contained poignant lyrics ( " Screamed at the make @-@ believe / Screamed at the sky / You finally found all your courage to let it all go " ) with a " two @-@ chord cascade of synthesizer slabs , interweaving guitar and bass lines , passionate singing and romantic lyrics . " " Lullaby " is composed of what Apter calls " sharp stabs " of rhythmic guitar chords with Smith whispering the words . The premise for the song came to Smith after remembering lullabies his father would sing him when he could not sleep : " [ My father ] would always make them up . There was always a horrible ending . They would be something like ' sleep now , pretty baby or you won 't wake up at all . ' "

 Disintegration was released in May 1989 and peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart , the highest position the band had placed on the chart at that point . In the UK , the lead single " Lullaby " became The Cure 's highest charting hit in their home country when it reached number five . In the US , due to its appearance in the film Lost Angels , the band 's American label Elektra Records released " Fascination Street " as the first single . The international follow @-@ up single to " Lullaby " , " Lovesong " , became The Cure 's highest charting hit in the United States , when it reached number two on the Billboard charts . The success of Disintegration was such that the March 1990 final single " Pictures of You " reached number 24 on the British charts , despite the fact that the album had been released a year earlier . Disintegration was certified silver ( 60 @,@ 000 copies shipped ) in the United Kingdom , and by 1992 had sold more than three million copies worldwide . 
 In a contemporary review for Rolling Stone , music critic Michael Azerrad gave the album three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of five stars and felt that , " while Disintegration doesn 't break new ground for the band , it successfully refines what the Cure does best " . He concluded , " Despite the title , Disintegration hangs together beautifully , creating and sustaining a mood of thoroughly self @-@ absorbed gloom . If , as Smith has hinted , the Cure itself is about to disintegrate , this is a worthy summation . " Melody Maker reviewer Chris Roberts dismissed the claims that Disintegration was not a miserable record and , noting the tone of the album and its lack of melody ( " You 'll be lucky to find a tune on here . Or a gag " ) , he commented that " The Cure have almost invisibly stopped making pop records " . Roberts summarised the album as " challenging and claustrophobic , often poignant , often tedious . It 's nearly surprising . " NME praised Disintegration for its tunes , " from the first track ' Plainsong ' , a swaying , slow narrative , paralysing the listener with sex @-@ poison , to Disintegration 's last ' Untitled ' Smith 's lyrical agony of indecision is remorseless " . Reviewer Barbara Ellen noted the large range of emotions in Smith 's lyrics , " from deep , loving pink to an ugly , violent maroon and almost back again " . Although she found the two extra @-@ tracks superfluous , Ellen hailed Disintegration as " a mindblowing and stunningly complete album " . Q gave the album a three @-@ star rating out of five , mainly comparing it to Joy Division 's work . Writer Mat Snow observed : " The Cure have studied well the art of the tragic bass line , the hesitant and melancholy guitar lick , the funereal keyboard coloration " . He concluded : " Disintegration is thus well @-@ crafted [ ... ] , just don 't tell me it 's original " . Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album a " C + " grade and felt that Smith attempts to appease a larger audience by broadening " gothic clichés " and " pumping his bad faith and bad relationship into depressing moderato play @-@ loud <unk> anthems far more tedious than his endless vamps " . 
 In a retrospective review for AllMusic , Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave Disintegration four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of five stars , and applauded the band by saying , " The Cure 's gloomy soundscapes have rarely sounded so alluring [ and ] the songs – from the pulsating , ominous ' Fascination Street ' to the eerie , string @-@ laced ' Lullaby ' – have rarely been so well @-@ constructed and memorable . " Erlewine went on to praise Disintegration for being " darkly seductive " , and " a hypnotic , mesmerizing record " . Pitchfork praised the record , admitting " Disintegration stands unquestionably as Robert Smith 's magnum opus . " Writer Chris Ott noted that " scant few albums released in the 1980s can boast an opener as grand as ' Plainsong ' , the most breathtaking , shimmering anthem the band ever recorded . " 
 Disintegration has been included in numerous " Best Of " lists . Rolling Stone placed the record at number 326 on its 2003 compilation of the " 500 Greatest Albums of All Time " . The magazine 's German counterpart placed Disintegration at number 184 on the same list . The album was considered to be the best album of 1989 by Melody Maker , 17th on Q magazine 's " 40 Best Albums of the 80s " , and 38th on Pitchfork 's " Best Albums of the 80s " . The album placed at number 14 in Entertainment Weekly 's " New Classics : The 100 Best Albums from 1983 to 2008 . " In 2012 , Slant Magazine listed the album at number 15 on its list of " Best Albums of the 1980s " . In a 2001 article in Rolling Stone , readers selected Disintegration as number 9 in of " the 10 Best Albums of the Eighties " . The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die .

 Following completion of Disintegration , Smith noted that The Cure had " despite my best efforts , actually become everything that I didn 't want us to become : a stadium rock band . " Furthermore , Smith claimed the album 's title was the most appropriate one he could think of : " Most of the relationship with the band outside of the band fell apart . Calling it Disintegration was kind of tempting fate , and fate retaliated . The family idea of the group really fell apart too after Disintegration . It was the end of a golden period . " 
 The Prayer Tour began in Europe shortly after the release of the album . The band performed numerous high @-@ profile concerts , including shows in front of more than 40 @,@ 000 fans over two nights in Paris and their first performances in Eastern Europe . Following the European leg , the band elected to travel to North America for their upcoming US leg by boat , instead of plane . Smith and Gallup shared a fear of flight , and ultimately lamented the upcoming dates , wishing to reduce the number of concerts they booked . The record label and tour promoters strongly disagreed , and even proposed to add several new shows to the itinerary because of the success of Disintegration in the US . The first concert in the United States was at New Jersey 's Giants Stadium , where 44 @,@ 000 people attended ; 30 @,@ 000 tickets were purchased on the first day alone . The opening acts at Giant Stadium were : Pixies , Shelleyan Orphan and Love and Rockets along with a special appearance by The <unk> . The band were extremely displeased with the massive turnout ; according to Roger O 'Donnell : " We had been at sea for five days . The stadium was too big for us to take it all in . We 've decided that we don 't like playing stadiums that large . " Smith recalls that " it was never our intention to become as big as this " . 
 The band 's show at Dodger Stadium attracted roughly 50 @,@ 000 attendees , grossing over US $ 1 @.@ 5 million . The band 's notably greater popularity in the United States — virtually every concert in the leg was sold out — caused Smith to break down , and threatened the band 's future : " It 's reached a stage where I personally can 't cope with it , " he said , " so I 've decided this is the last time we 're gonna tour . " Backstage , there were ongoing feuds between band members owing to the strife onset by Smith . He recalled that towards the end of the tour " I was tearing my hair out ... It was just a difficult tour . " Cocaine use was prevalent , and only ended up distancing Smith from his fellow band members . 
 Upon returning to the United Kingdom in early October , Smith wanted nothing more to do with recording , promoting and touring for an album . In 1990 " Lullaby " won " Best Music Video of 1989 " at the BRIT Awards . The Cure also released a live album titled <unk> ( 1991 ) , which compiled songs entirely off Disintegration from their performance at Wembley Arena , and despite claims that The Cure would never tour again , Smith accepted an invitation to headline the Glastonbury Festival . O 'Donnell , after two years with the group , left to pursue a solo career , and was replaced by the band 's guitar technician Perry Bamonte . Smith , who was influenced by the acid house movement that had exploded in London that summer , released a predominantly electronic remix album , Mixed Up , in 1990 .

 = Samuel J. Randall = 
 Samuel Jackson Randall ( October 10 , 1828 – April 13 , 1890 ) was a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania in the late 19th century . He served as the 29th Speaker of the House and was twice a contender for his party 's nomination for President of the United States . 
 Born in Philadelphia to a family active in Whig politics , Randall shifted to the Democratic Party after the Whigs ' demise . His rise in politics began in the 1850s with election to the Philadelphia Common Council and then to the Pennsylvania State Senate . Randall served in a Union cavalry unit in the American Civil War before winning a seat in the federal House of Representatives in 1862 . He was reelected every two years thereafter until his death . The representative of an industrial region , Randall became known as a staunch defender of protective tariffs designed to assist domestic producers of manufactured goods . While often siding with Republicans on tariff issues , he differed with them in his resistance to Reconstruction and the growth of federal power . 
 Randall 's defense of smaller , less centralized government raised his profile among House Democrats , and they elevated him to Speaker in 1876 . He held that post until the Democrats lost control of the House in 1881 , and was considered a possible nominee for President in 1880 and 1884 . Randall 's support for high tariffs began to alienate him from most Democrats , and when that party regained control of the House in 1883 , he was denied another term as Speaker . Randall continued to serve in Congress as head of the Appropriations Committee . He remained a respected party leader , but gradually lost influence as the Democrats became more firmly wedded to free trade . Worsening health also curtailed his power until his death in 1890 . 
 = = Early life and family = = 
 Randall was born on October 10 , 1828 in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , the eldest son of Josiah and Ann Worrell Randall . Three younger brothers soon followed : William , Robert , and Henry . Josiah Randall was a leading Philadelphia lawyer who had served in the state legislature in the 1820s . Randall 's paternal grandfather , Matthew Randall , was a judge on the Pennsylvania Courts of Common Pleas and county prothonotary in that city in the early 19th century . His maternal grandfather , Joseph Worrell , was also a prominent citizen , active in politics for the Democratic Party during Thomas Jefferson 's presidency . Josiah Randall was a Whig in politics , but drifted into the Democratic fold after the Whig Party dissolved in the 1850s . 
 When Randall was born , the family lived at Seventh and Walnut Streets in what is now Center City Philadelphia . Randall was educated at the University Academy , a school affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania . On completing school at age 17 , he did not follow his father into the law , but instead took a job as a bookkeeper with a local silk merchant . Shortly thereafter , he started a coal delivery business and , at age 21 , became a partner in a scrap iron business named Earp and Randall . 
 Two years later , in 1851 , Randall married Fannie Agnes Ward , the daughter of Aaron and Mary Watson Ward of Sing Sing , New York . Randall 's new father @-@ in @-@ law was a major general in the New York militia and had served in Congress as a Jacksonian Democrat for several terms between 1825 and 1843 . Randall and Fannie went on to have three children : Ann , Susan , and Samuel Josiah . 
 = = Local politics and military service = = 
 In 1851 , Randall assisted his father in the election campaign for a local judge . The judge , a Whig , was elected despite considerable opposition from a candidate of the nativist American Party ( commonly called the " Know @-@ Nothing Party " ) . The strength of this group , combined with the Whigs ' declining fortunes , led Samuel Randall to call himself an " American Whig " when he ran for Philadelphia Common Council the following year . He was elected , holding office for four one @-@ year terms from 1852 to 1856 . The period was one of significant change in Philadelphia 's governance , as all of Philadelphia County 's townships and boroughs were consolidated into one city in 1854 . 
 As the Whig Party fell apart , Randall and his family became Democrats . Josiah Randall was friendly with James Buchanan , a Pennsylvania Democrat then serving as the United States ' envoy in Great Britain . Both Randall and his father attended the Democratic National Convention in 1856 to work for Buchanan 's nomination for president , which was successful . When , in 1858 , a vacancy occurred in Randall 's state Senate district , he ran for election ( as a Democrat ) for the remainder of the term , and was elected . Still only 30 years old , Randall had risen rapidly in politics . Much of his term in the state Senate was spent dealing with the incorporation of street railway companies , which he believed would benefit his district . Randall also supported legislation to reduce the power of banks , a policy that he would continue to advocate for his entire political career . In 1860 , he ran for election to a full term in the state Senate while his brother Robert ran for a seat in the state House of Representatives . Ignoring their father 's advice that it meant " too much Randall on the ticket , " both brothers were unsuccessful . 
 In 1861 , the Civil War began as eleven Southern states seceded from the Union to form the Confederate States of America . Randall joined the First Troop Philadelphia City Cavalry in May of that year as a private . The unit was stationed in central Pennsylvania and eastern Virginia during Randall 's 90 @-@ day enlistment , but saw no action during that time . In 1863 , he re @-@ joined the unit , this time being elected captain . The First Troop was sent back to central Pennsylvania during the Gettysburg campaign that summer , when Confederate forces under Robert E. Lee invaded Pennsylvania . He served as provost marshal at Gettysburg , Pennsylvania in the days before the battle there , and had the same role at Columbia , Pennsylvania during the battle , but did not see combat . As historian Albert V. House explained , " [ h ] is military career was respectable , but far from arduous , most of his duties being routine reconnoitering which seldom led him under fire . " 
 = = House of Representatives = = 
 = = = Election to the House = = = 
 In 1862 , before rejoining his cavalry unit , Randall was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania 's 1st congressional district . The city had been gerrymandered by a Republican legislature to create four solidly Republican districts , with the result that as many Democrats as possible were lumped into the 1st district . Gaining the Democratic nomination was , thus , tantamount to election ; Randall defeated former mayor Richard Vaux for their party 's endorsement and won easily over his Republican opponent , Edward G. Webb . He won with the help of William " Squire " McMullen , the Democratic boss of the fourth ward , who would remain a lifelong Randall ally . 
 Under the congressional calendar of the 1860s , members of the 38th United States Congress , elected in November 1862 , did not begin their work until December 1863 . Randall arrived that month , after being discharged from his cavalry unit , to join a Congress dominated by Republicans . As a member of the minority , Randall had little opportunity to author legislation , but quickly became known as a hard @-@ working and conscientious member . James G. Blaine , a Republican also first elected in 1862 , later characterized Randall as " a strong partisan , with many elements of leadership . He ... never neglects his public duties , and never forgets the interests of the Democratic Party . " 
 Randall was known as a friend to the manufacturers in his district , especially as it concerned protective tariffs . Despite being in the minority , Randall spoke often in defense of his constituents ' interests . As House described him , 
 He had a tongue that could snap out sarcastic quips with lightning speed . His voice was pitched rather high , and in moments of excitement , its metallic ring approached a shrill screech . His countenance was usually very attractive ... but this face became a thundercloud when he was in a defiant mood . 
 With his party continually in the minority , Randall gained experience in the functioning of the House , but his tenure left little evidence in the statute book . He attracted little attention , but kept his constituents happy and was repeatedly reelected . 
 = = = War and Reconstruction = = = 
 When the 38th Congress convened in December 1863 , the Civil War was approaching its end . Randall was a War Democrat , sometimes siding with his Republican colleagues to support measures in pursuit of victory over the Confederates . When a bill was proposed to allow President Abraham Lincoln to promote Ulysses S. Grant to lieutenant general , Randall voted in favor , unlike most in his party . He voted with the majority of Democrats , however , to oppose allowing black men to serve in the Union Army . 
 When it came to political plans for the post @-@ war nation , he was strictly opposed to most Republican @-@ proposed measures . Republicans proposed the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865 , which would abolish slavery , and Randall spoke against it . Claiming opposition to slavery , Randall said his objections stemmed instead from a belief that the amendment was " a beginning of changes in the Constitution and the forerunner of usurpation . " After Andrew Johnson became president following Lincoln 's assassination , Randall came to support Johnson 's policies for Reconstruction of the defeated South , which were more lenient than those of the Republican majority in Congress . In 1867 , the Republicans proposed requiring an ironclad oath from all Southerners wishing to vote , hold office , or practice law in federal courts , making them swear they had never borne arms against the United States . Randall led a 16 @-@ hour filibuster against the measure ; in spite of his efforts , it passed . 
 Randall began to gain prominence in the small Democratic caucus by opposing Reconstruction measures . His delaying tactics against fellow Pennsylvanian Thaddeus Stevens 's military Reconstruction bill in February 1867 kept the bill from being considered for two weeks — long enough to prevent it from being voted on until the next session . He likewise spoke against what would become the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution . Although he opposed the amendment , Randall did favor the idea behind part of it : section 4 , which guarantees that Congress may not repudiate the federal debt , nor may it assume debts of the Confederacy , nor debt that the individual Confederate states incurred during the rebellion . Many Republicans claimed that if the Democrats were to regain power , they would do exactly that , repudiating federal debt and assuming that of the rebels . Despite disagreement on other facets of Reconstruction , Randall stood firmly with the Republicans ( and most Northern Democrats ) on the debt . 
 As impeachment proceedings began against President Johnson , Randall became one of his leading defenders in the House . Once the House determined to impeach Johnson , Randall worked to direct the investigation to the Judiciary Committee , rather than a special committee convened for the purpose , which he believed would be stacked with pro @-@ impeachment members . His efforts were unsuccessful , as were his speeches in favor of the president : Johnson was impeached by a vote of 128 to 47 . Johnson was not convicted after his Senate trial , and Randall remained on good terms with him after the president left office . 
 = = = Financial legislation = = = 
 With Grant , a Republican , elected president in 1868 , and the 41st Congress as Republican @-@ dominated as its immediate predecessors , Randall faced several more years in the minority . He served on the Banking and Currency Committee and began to focus on financial matters , resuming his long @-@ standing policy against the power of banks . This placed Randall in the growing fight over the nature of the nation 's currency — those who favored the gold @-@ backed currency were called " hard money " supporters , while the policy of encouraging inflation through coining silver or issuing dollars backed by government bonds ( " greenbacks " ) was known as " soft money " . Although he believed in a gold @-@ backed dollar , Randall was friendly to greenbacks ; in general , he favored allowing the amount of currency to remain constant , while replacing bank @-@ issued dollar bills with greenbacks . He also believed the federal government should sell its bonds directly to the public , rather than selling them only to large banks , which then re @-@ sold them at a profit . He was unsuccessful in convincing the Republican majority to adopt any of these measures . 
 Randall worked with Republicans to shift the source of federal funds from taxes to tariffs . He believed the taxation of alcohol spread the burdens of taxation unfairly , especially as concerned his constituents , who included several distillers . He also believed the income tax , first enacted during the Civil War , was being administered unfairly , with large refunds often accruing to powerful business interests . On this point , Randall was successful , and the House accepted an amendment that required all cases for refunds over $ 500 to be tried before a federal district court . He also worked toward the elimination of taxation on tea , coffee , cigars , and matches , all of which Randall believed fell disproportionately on the poor . Relief from taxation made these items cheaper for the average American , while increasing reliance on tariffs helped the industrial owners and workers in Randall 's district , as it made foreign products more expensive . 
 Tariff legislation generally found favor with Randall , which put him more often in alliance with Republicans than Democrats . In the late 1860s and early 1870s , Randall worked to raise tariffs on a wide variety of imported goods . Even so , he sometimes differed with the Republicans when he believed the tariff proposed was too high ; biographer Alfred V. House describes Randall 's attitude as supporting " higher tariff rates ... largely because he believed that the benefits of such high rates were passed on to the labor population . " In 1870 , he opposed the pig iron tariff as too high , against the wishes of fellow Pennsylvanian William " Pig Iron " Kelley . Randall called his version of protectionism " incidental protection " : he believed that tariffs should be high enough to support the cost of running the government , but only applied to those industries that needed tariff protection to survive foreign competition . 
 = = = Appropriations and investigations = = = 
 While the Democrats were in the minority , Randall spent much of his time scrutinizing the Republicans ' appropriations bills . During the Grant administration , he questioned thousands of items in the appropriation bills , often gaining the support of Republicans in excising expenditures that were in excess of the departments ' needs . He proposed a bill that would end the practice , common at the time , of executive departments spending beyond what they had been appropriated , then petitioning Congress to retroactively approve the spending with a supplemental appropriation ; the legislation passed and became law . The supplemental appropriations were typically rushed through at the end of a session with little debate . Reacting to the large grants of land given to railroads , he also sought unsuccessfully to ban all land grants to private corporations . 
 Investigating appropriations led Randall to focus on financial impropriety in Congress and the Grant administration . The most famous of these was the Crédit Mobilier scandal . In this scheme , the Union Pacific Railroad bankrupted itself by overpaying its construction company , the Crédit Mobilier of America . Crédit Mobilier was owned by the railroad 's principal shareholders and , as the investigation discovered , several congressmen also owned shares that they had been allowed to purchase at discounted prices . Randall 's role in the investigation was limited , but he proposed bills to ban such frauds and sought to impeach Vice President Schuyler Colfax , who had been implicated in the scandal . Randall was involved with the investigation of several other scandals , as well , including tax fraud by private tax collection contractors ( known as the Sanborn incident ) and fraud in the awarding of postal contracts ( the star route scandal ) . 
 Randall was caught on the wrong side of one scandal in 1873 when Congress passed a retroactive pay increase . On the last day of the term , the 42nd Congress voted to raise its members ' pay by 50 % , including a raise made retroactive to the beginning of the term . Randall voted for the pay raise , and against the amendment that would have removed the retroactive provision . The law , later known as the Salary Grab Act , provoked outrage across the country . Randall defended the Act , saying that an increased salary would " put members of Congress beyond temptation " and reduce fraud . Seeing the unpopularity of the Salary Grab , the incoming 43rd Congress repealed it almost immediately , with Randall voting for repeal . 
 = = = Rise to prominence = = = 
 Democrats remained in the minority when the 43rd Congress convened in 1873 . Randall continued his opposition to measures proposed by Republicans , especially those intended to increase the power of the federal government . That term saw the introduction of a new civil rights bill with farther @-@ reaching ambitions than any before it . Previous acts had seen the use of federal courts and troops to guarantee that black men and women could not be deprived of their civil rights by any state . Now Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts proposed a new bill , aimed at requiring equal rights in all public accommodations . When Sumner died in 1874 , his bill had not passed , but others from the radical wing of the Republican Party , including Representative Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts , continued to work for its enactment . 
 Randall stood against this measure , as he had against nearly all Reconstruction laws . A lack of consensus delayed the bill from coming to a vote until the lame @-@ duck session beginning in December 1874 . By that time , disillusionment with the Grant administration and worsening economic conditions had translated into a Democratic victory in the mid @-@ term elections . When the 44th Congress gathered in March 1875 , the House would have a Democratic majority for the first time since the Civil War . In the meantime , the outgoing Republicans made one last effort to pass Sumner 's civil rights bill ; Randall and other Democrats immediately used parliamentary maneuvers to bring action to a stand @-@ still , hoping to delay passage until the Congress ended . Randall led his caucus in filibustering the bill , at one point remaining on the floor for 72 hours . In the end , the Democrats peeled away some Republican votes , but not enough to defeat the bill , which passed by a vote of 162 to 100 . Despite the defeat , Randall 's filibuster increased his prominence in the eyes of his Democratic colleagues . 
 As Democrats took control of the House in 1875 , Randall was considered among the candidates for Speaker of the House . Many in the caucus hesitated , however , believing Randall to be too close to railroad interests and uncertain on the money question . His leadership in the Salary Grab may have harmed him , as well . Randall was also occupied by an intra @-@ party battle with William A. Wallace for control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party . Wallace , who had been elected to the United States Senate in 1874 , was weakened by rumors that he had taken bribes from the railroads while a member of the State Senate . Randall wanted control of the Democratic machine statewide , and the Wallace faction 's vulnerability on the bribery rumors provided the opportunity . In January 1875 , he had friends in the state legislature begin an investigation into Wallace 's clique , which ultimately turned state Democratic leaders against the senator . At the state Democratic convention in September 1875 , Randall ( with the help of his old ally , Squire McMullen ) triumphed , putting his men in control of the state party . 
 In the meantime , the divisions in the state party proved ruinous for Randall 's chances at the Speaker 's chair . Instead , the Democrats decided on Michael C. Kerr of Indiana , who was elected . Randall was instead named chairman of the Appropriations Committee . In that post , he focused on reducing the government 's spending , and cut the budget by $ 30 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 , despite opposition from the Republican Senate . Kerr 's health was fragile , and he was often absent from sessions , but Randall refused to take his place as speaker on a temporary basis , preferring to concentrate on his appropriations work . Kerr and Randall began to work more closely together through 1876 , but Kerr died in August of that year , leaving the Speakership vacant once again . 
 = = Speaker of the House = = 
 = = = Hayes and Tilden = = = 
 After Kerr 's death , Randall was the consensus choice of the Democratic caucus , and was elected to the Speakership when Congress returned to Washington on December 2 , 1876 . He assumed the chair at a tumultuous time , as the presidential election had just concluded the previous month with no clear winner . The Democratic candidate , Samuel J. Tilden of New York , had 184 electoral votes , just shy of the 185 needed for victory . Rutherford B. Hayes , the Republican , had 163 ; the remaining 22 votes were in doubt . 
 Randall spent early December in conference with Tilden while committees examined the votes from the disputed states . The counts of the disputed ballots were inconclusive , with each of the states in question producing two sets of returns : one signed by Democratic officials , the other by Republicans , each claiming victory for their man . By January 1877 , with the question still unresolved , Congress and President Grant agreed to submit the matter to a bipartisan Electoral Commission , which would be authorized to determine the fate of the disputed electoral votes . 
 Randall supported the idea , believing it the best solution to an intractable problem . The bill passed , providing for a commission of five representatives , five senators , and five Supreme Court justices . To ensure partisan balance , there would be seven Democrats and seven Republicans ; the fifteenth member was to be a Supreme Court justice chosen by the other four on the commission ( themselves two Republicans and two Democrats ) . Justice David Davis , an independent respected by both parties , was expected to be their choice , but he upset the careful planning by accepting election to the Senate by the state of Illinois and refusing to serve on the commission . The remaining Supreme Court justices were all Republicans and , with the addition of Justice Joseph P. Bradley to the place intended for Davis , the commission had an 8 – 7 Republican majority . Randall nevertheless favored the compromise , even voting in favor of it in the roll call vote ( the Speaker usually does not vote ) . The commission met and awarded all of the disputed ballots to Hayes by an 8 – 7 party @-@ line vote . 
 Democrats were outraged , and many demanded that they filibuster the final count in the House . Randall did not commit , but permitted the House to take recesses several times , delaying the decision . As the March 4 inauguration day approached , leaders of both parties met at Wormley 's Hotel in Washington to negotiate a compromise . Republicans promised that , in exchange for Democratic acquiescence in the Commission 's decision , Hayes would order federal troops to withdraw from the South and accept the election of Democratic governments in the remaining " unredeemed " states there . The Democratic leadership , including Randall , agreed and the filibuster ended . 
 = = = Monetary disputes = = = 
 Randall returned to Washington in March 1877 at the start of the 45th Congress and was reelected Speaker . As the session began , many in the Democratic caucus were determined to repeal the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875 . That Act , passed when Republicans last controlled the House , was intended to gradually withdraw all greenbacks from circulation , replacing them with dollars backed in specie ( i.e. , gold or silver ) . With the elimination of the silver dollar in 1873 , this would effectively return the United States to the gold standard for the first time since before the Civil War . Randall , who had voted against the act in 1875 , agreed to let the House vote on its repeal , which narrowly passed . The Senate , still controlled by Republicans , declined to act on the bill . 
 The attempt at repeal did not end the controversy over silver . Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri proposed a bill that would require the United States to buy as much silver as miners could sell the government and strike it into coins , a system that would increase the money supply and aid debtors . In short , silver miners would sell the government metal worth fifty to seventy cents , and receive back a silver dollar . Randall allowed the bill to come to the floor for an up @-@ or @-@ down vote during a special session in November 1877 : the result was its passage by a vote of 163 to 34 ( with 94 members absent ) . The pro @-@ silver idea cut across party lines , and William B. Allison , a Republican from Iowa led the effort in the Senate . Allison offered an amendment in the Senate requiring the purchase of two to four million dollars per month of silver , but not allowing private deposit of silver at the mints . Thus , the seignorage , or difference between the face value of the coin and the worth of the metal contained within it accrued to the government 's credit , not private citizens . President Hayes vetoed the bill , but Congress overrode the veto , and the Bland – Allison Act became law . 
 = = = Potter committee = = = 
 As the 1880 presidential elections approached , many Democrats remained convinced Tilden had been robbed of the presidency in 1876 . In the House , Tilden supporter Clarkson Nott Potter of New York sought an investigation into the 1876 election in Florida and Louisiana , hoping that evidence of Republican malfeasance would harm that party 's candidate in 1880 . The Democratic caucus , including Randall , unanimously endorsed the idea , and the committee convened in May 1878 . Some in the caucus wished to investigate the entire election , but Randall and the more moderate members worked to limit the committee 's reach to the two disputed states . 
 Randall left no doubt about his sympathies when he assigned members to the committee , stacking it with Hayes 's enemies from both parties . The committee 's investigation had the opposite of the Democrats ' intended effect , uncovering telegrams from Tilden 's nephew , William Tilden Pelton , offering bribes to Southern Republicans in the disputed states to help Tilden claim their votes . The Pelton telegrams were in code , which the committee was able to decode ; Republicans had also sent ciphered dispatches , but the committee was unable to decode them . The ensuing excitement fizzled out by June 1878 as the Congress went into recess . 
 = = = <unk> Speaker = = = 
 As the 46th Congress convened in 1879 , the Democratic caucus was reduced , but they still held a plurality of seats . The new House contained 152 Democrats , 139 Republicans , and 20 independents , most of whom were affiliated with the Greenback Party . Many of Randall 's fellow Democrats differed with him over protectionism and his lack of support for Southern railroad subsidies , and considered choosing Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn of Kentucky as their nominee for Speaker , instead . Several other Southerners ' names were floated , too , as anti @-@ Randall Democrats tried to coalesce around a single candidate ; in the end , none could be found and the caucus chose Randall as their nominee with 107 votes out of 152 . With some Democrats not yet present , however , the Democrats began to fear that the Republicans and Greenbackers would strike a deal to combine their votes to elect James A. Garfield of Ohio as Speaker . When the time for the vote came , however , Garfield refused to make any compromises with the third @-@ party men , and Randall and the Democrats were able to organize the House once more . 
 = = = Civil rights and the army = = = 
 Randall 's determination to cut spending , combined with Southern Democrats ' desire to reduce federal power in their home states , led the House to pass an army appropriation bill with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts , which had been used to suppress the Ku Klux Klan . The Enforcement Acts , passed during Reconstruction over Democratic opposition , made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race . Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters , and he vetoed the appropriation . The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto , but they passed a new bill with the same rider . Hayes vetoed this as well , and the process was repeated three times more . Finally , Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider , but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals , who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts . The election laws remained in effect , but the funds to enforce them were curtailed . Randall 's role in the process was limited , but the Democrats ' failure to force Hayes 's acquiescence weakened his appeal as a potential presidential candidate in 1880 . 
 = = = 1880 presidential election = = = 
 As the 1880 elections approached , Randall had two goals : to increase his control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party , and to nominate Tilden for president . His efforts at the former in 1875 had been successful , but Senator William Wallace 's faction was again growing powerful . If he wanted to hold the Speakership , as well as to wield influence in the next presidential canvass , Randall believed he must have a united state party behind him . To that end , Randall spent much of his time outside of Congress travelling around his home state to line up support at the state convention in 1880 . Some of his allies ' enthusiasm backfired against him , however , after McMullen and some supporters broke up an anti @-@ Randall meeting in Philadelphia 's 5th ward with such violence that one man was left dead . 
 When the state convention gathered in April 1880 , Randall was confident of victory , but soon found that the Wallace faction outnumbered his . Wallace 's majority scrambled the party 's organization in Philadelphia and , although some Randall supporters received seats , the majority owed allegiance to the senator . Despite the defeat , Randall pressed on for Tilden , both in Pennsylvania and elsewhere . As rumors circulated that Tilden 's health would keep him from running again , Randall remained a loyal Tilden man up to the national convention that June . After the first ballot , the New York delegation released a letter from Tilden in which he withdrew from consideration . Randall hoped for the ex @-@ Tilden delegates to rally to him . Many did so , and Randall surged to second place on the second ballot , but the momentum had shifted to another candidate , Major General Winfield Scott Hancock . Nearly all of the delegates shifted to Hancock , and he was nominated . 
 Randall believed he had been betrayed by many he had thought would support him , but carried on regardless in support of his party 's nominee . Hancock ( who remained on active duty ) and the Republican nominee , James A. Garfield , did not campaign directly , in keeping with the customs of that time , but campaigns were conducted by other party members , including Randall . Speaking in Pennsylvania and around the Midwest , Randall did his best to rally the people to Hancock against Garfield , but without success . Garfield was elected with 214 electoral votes — including those of Pennsylvania . Worse still for Randall , Garfield 's victory had swept the Republicans back into a majority in the House , meaning Randall 's time as Speaker was at an end . 
 = = Later House service = = 
 = = = Tariffs = = = 
 When Randall returned to Washington in 1881 to begin his term in the 47th Congress , the legislature was controlled by Republicans . After Garfield 's assassination later that year , Vice President Chester A. Arthur assumed the presidency . Arthur , like most Republicans , favored high tariffs , but he sought to simplify the tariff structure and to reduce excise taxes . Randall , who had returned to his seat on the Appropriations Committee , favored the president 's plan , and was among the few Democrats in the House to support the it . The bill that emerged from the Ways and Means Committee , dominated by protectionists , provided for only a 10 percent reduction . After conference with the Senate , the resulting bill had an even smaller effect , reducing tariffs by an average of 1 @.@ 47 percent . It passed both houses narrowly on March 3 , 1883 , the last full day of the 47th Congress ; Arthur signed the measure into law . Toward the end , Randall took less part in the debate , feeling the tension between his supporters in the House , who wanted more reductions , and his constituents at home , who wanted less . 
 The Democrats recaptured the House after the 1882 elections , but the incoming majority in the 48th Congress was divided on tariffs , with Randall 's protectionist faction in the minority . The new Democratic caucus was more Southern and Western than in previous Congresses , and contained many new members who were unfamiliar with Randall . This led many to propose selecting a Speaker more in line with their own views , rather than returning Randall to the office . Randall 's attempt to canvass the incoming representatives was further hampered by an attack of the gout . In the end , John G. Carlisle of Kentucky , an advocate of tariff reform , bested Randall in a poll of the Democratic caucus by a vote of 104 to 53 . 
 Carlisle selected William Ralls Morrison , another tariff reformer , to lead the Ways and Means committee , but allowed Randall to take charge of Appropriations . Morrison 's committee produced a bill proposing tariff reductions of 20 % ; Randall opposed the idea from the start , as did the Republicans . Another bout of illness kept Randall away from Congress at a crucial time in April 1884 , and the tariff bill passed a procedural hurdle by just two votes . Two days later , Randall 's Appropriations committee reported several funding bills with his support . Many Democrats who had voted for Morrison 's tariff were thereby reminded that Randall had the power to defeat spending that was important to them ; when the final vote came , enough switched sides to join with Republicans in defeating the reform 156 to 151 . 
 = = = Presidential election of 1884 = = = 
 As in 1880 , the contest for the Democratic nomination for president in 1884 began under the shadow of Tilden . Declining health forced Tilden 's withdrawal by June 1884 , and Randall felt free to pursue his own chance at the presidency . He gathered some of the Pennsylvania delegates to his cause , but by the time the convention assembled in July , most of the former Tilden adherents had gathered around New York governor Grover Cleveland . Early in the convention , Randall met with Daniel Manning , Cleveland 's campaign manager , and soon thereafter Randall 's delegates were instructed to cast their votes for Cleveland . As his biographer , House , wrote , the " actual bargain struck between Randall and Manning is not known , but ... events would seem to show that Randall was promised control of federal patronage in Pennsylvania . " 
 Cleveland 's campaign made extensive use of Randall , as he made speeches for Cleveland in New England , Pennsylvania , Ohio , Virginia , New York , and Connecticut , mainly in places where potential voters needed to be reassured that the Democrats did not want to lower the tariff so much that they would lose their jobs . In a close election , Cleveland was elected over his Republican opponent , James G. Blaine . Randall also took two tours of the South in 1884 after the election . Although , he claimed the trips to be of a personal nature , they generated speculation that Randall was gathering support for another run at the Speakership in 1885 . 
 = = = Resisting tariff reform = = = 
 As the 49th Congress gathered in 1885 , Cleveland 's position on the tariff was still largely unknown . Randall declined to challenge Carlisle for Speaker , busying himself instead with the federal patronage in Pennsylvania and continued leadership of the Appropriations committee . In February 1886 , Morrison , still the chairman of Ways and Means , proposed a bill to decrease the surplus by buying and cancelling $ 10 million worth of federal bonds each month . Cleveland opposed the plan , and Randall joined 13 Democrats and most Republicans in defeating it . Later that year , however , Cleveland supported Morrison 's attempt to reduce the tariff . Again , Republicans and Randall 's protectionist bloc combined to sink the measure . In the lame @-@ duck session of 1887 , Randall attempted a compromise tariff that would eliminate duties on some raw materials while also dispensing with excises on tobacco and some liquors . The bill attracted some support from Southern Democrats and Randall 's protectionists , but Republicans and the rest of the Democratic caucus rejected it . 
 = = = Declining influence = = = 
 The tariff fight continued into the 50th Congress , which opened in 1887 , in which Democrats retained control of the House , with a reduced majority . By that time , Cleveland had openly sided with the tariff reformers and backed the proposals introduced in 1888 by Representative Roger Q. Mills of Texas . Mills had replaced Morrison at Ways and Means after the latter 's defeat for reelection , and was as much in favor of tariff reform as the Illinoisan had been . Mills 's bill would make small cuts to tariffs on raw materials , but relatively deeper cuts to those on manufactured goods ; Randall , representing a manufacturing district , opposed it immediately . Randall was again ill and absent from the House when the Mills tariff passed by a 162 to 149 vote . The Senate , now Republican @-@ controlled , refused to consider the bill , and it died with the 50th Congress in 1889 . 
 Mills 's and Cleveland 's defeat on the tariff bill could be considered a victory for Randall , but the vote showed how isolated the former Speaker 's protectionist ideas now made him in his party : only four Democrats voted against the tariff reductions . The state party likewise turned against Randall and toward free trade , adopting a pro @-@ tariff revision platform at the 1888 state Democratic convention . At the same time , Randall seemingly reversed his long @-@ standing commitment to fiscal economy by voting with the Republicans to override Cleveland 's veto of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act . The Act would have given a pension to every Union veteran ( or their widows ) who claimed he could no longer perform physical labor , regardless of whether his disability was war @-@ related . Cleveland 's veto was in line with his record of small @-@ government cost @-@ cutting , with which Randall would normally have sympathized . Randall , perhaps in an effort to gain favor with veterans in his district , joined the Republicans in an unsuccessful attempt to override Cleveland 's veto . Another possibility proposed by biographer House is that Randall saw the federal budget surplus as reason to cut tariffs ; by increasing federal spending , he hoped to decrease the surplus and maintain the need for high tariffs . Whatever the reason , the attempt failed and left Randall further alienated from his fellow Democrats . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 Randall 's positions on tariffs and pensions had made him , according to The New York Times , " a practical Republican " by 1888 . Voting with the opposing party so frequently was an effective tactic , as he faced only token Republican opposition for reelection that year . Randall 's health continued to decline . When the new congress began in 1889 , he received special permission to be sworn into office from his bed , where he was confined . The new Speaker , Republican Thomas Brackett Reed of Maine , appointed Randall to the Rules and Appropriations committees , but he had no impact during that term . 
 On April 12 , 1890 , Randall died of colon cancer in his Washington home . He had recently joined the First Presbyterian Church in the capital , and his funeral was held there . He was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia . Elected every two years from 1862 to 1888 , Randall was the only prominent Democrat continuously on the national scene between those years . In an obituary , the Bulletin of the American Iron and Steel Association described the congressman who had consistently protected their industry : " Not a great scholar , nor a great orator , nor a great writer , Samuel J. Randall was nevertheless a man of sterling common sense , quick perceptions , great courage , broad views and extraordinary capacity for work . " The only scholarly works on his life are a master 's thesis by Sidney I. Pomerantz , written in 1932 , and a doctoral dissertation by Albert V. House , from 1934 ; both are unpublished . His papers were collected by the University of Pennsylvania library in the 1950s and he has been the subject of several journal articles ( many by House ) , but , as of 2015 , awaits a full scholarly biography .

 = Hurricane Ella ( 1958 ) = 
 Hurricane Ella brought flooding to the Greater Antilles and Texas in September 1958 . The fifth named storm and third hurricane of the annual season , Ella developed from a tropical wave located just east of the Lesser Antilles on August 30 . Initially a tropical depression , it strengthened into Tropical Storm Ella six hours later . The system crossed the Leeward Islands and entered the Caribbean Sea late on August 30 . Ella headed westward and by August 31 , intensified into a Category 1 hurricane . Hours later , it strengthened into a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . The storm curved northwestward while south of Hispaniola and as a result , struck the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti on September 1 . Flooding in that country killed 30 people in Aux Cayes and left 3 other missing . Additionally , thousands were left homeless , about one @-@ third of crops were washed out , and numerous cattle were killed . 
 After re @-@ emerging into the Caribbean Sea , Ella deepened further and peaked as 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) Category 3 hurricane on September 2 , while it was making landfall near Santiago de Cuba , Cuba . Heavy rainfall lead to flooding , which in turn caused hundreds to flee their homes , and resulted in 5 fatalities . Hundreds of livestock drowned , and telephone and telegraph services were disrupted in many areas . The storm became disorganized while moving across the southern coast of Cuba and weakened to a tropical storm by later on September 2 . Ella reached the Gulf of Mexico on September 4 and briefly re @-@ strengthened . However , it began to weaken again while approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States . The storm made landfall as a weak tropical storm near Corpus Christi , Texas on September 6 . It rapidly weakened inland and dissipated later that day . Rainfall and rough surf caused both inland and coastal flooding in Texas . Offshore , the captain of a snapper boat fell overboard and went missing ; he was later presumed to have drowned .

 A tropical wave was first observed near 50 ° W on August 29 . Later that day , reconnaissance aircraft flight reported a wind shirt and above average shower and thunderstorm activity , but no low @-@ level circulation . At 0600 UTC on August 30 , a tropical depression developed just east of the Lesser Antilles . Six hours later , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Ella . The storm moved through the Leeward Islands and entered the Caribbean Sea late on August 30 . A reconnaissance aircraft into Ella reported sustained winds between 55 and 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . It was around that time that the Weather Bureau Office in San Juan , Puerto Rico began issuing bulletins and advisories . Ella strengthened into a Category 1 hurricane at 1200 UTC on August 31 , six hours later , before becoming a Category 2 hurricane . On September 1 , Ella curved west @-@ northwestward , and by later that day , made landfall on the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti with winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) . However , the storm was operationally thought to have remained offshore . 
 Ella re @-@ emerged into the Caribbean Sea on September 1 and immediately resumed strengthening . While becoming a Category 3 hurricane at 0000 UTC on September 2 , Ella attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 989 mbar ( 29 @.@ 2 inHg ) . Around that time , the storm made landfall near Santiago de Cuba , Cuba at the same intensity . Rough terrain over the island caused Ella to weaken to a Category 1 hurricane on September 2 . Later that day , it further weakened to a tropical storm . The storm re @-@ strengthened to a 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) before reaching the Gulf of Mexico on September 4 . Ella maintained this intensity for approximately 48 hours while moving west @-@ northwestward , but began to weaken again on September 6 . Hours later , the storm made landfall near Corpus Christi , Texas with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) . It weakened back to a tropical depression and dissipated by late on September 6 . 
 = = Preparations and Impact = = 
 Wind gusts in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands were between 40 and 50 mph ( 64 and 80 km / h ) . Heavy rainfall in the former caused local flooding . Damage was minor in both locations , confined mostly to crops . In preparation for Ella on the island of Hispaniola , a hurricane warning was issued from Barahona , Dominican Republic , and along the Haitian coastline to Saint @-@ Marc . Ella brought heavy rains , peaking at 9 @.@ 63 in ( 245 mm ) in Polo , Barahona . Damage from the resultant flooding in southwestern Dominican Republic reached $ 100 @,@ 000 . Additionally , wind gusts up to 37 mph ( 60 km / h ) were reported in Santo Domingo . Heavy precipitation in Haiti caused flash floods that killed 30 people near Aux Cayes , and three other people were listed as missing . As much as 5 to 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 5 to 1 @.@ 8 m ) of water covered roads in low @-@ lying areas . A combination of strong winds and flooding also rendered thousands homeless . Damage to agriculture was heavy , with numerous cattle killed and about one @-@ third of crops washed out , mostly to bananas and sugar cane . There was no monetary damage estimate , though losses in Haiti were noted to have been " considerable " . 
 Flooding also occurred in Cuba . Hundreds were evacuated their homes in four different provinces in Cuba , including 400 peasant families in Oriente Province . Near Santiago de Cuba , 25 houses were swept away after the Bayamo River overflowed . In the same area , a woman and her four sons drowned due to the swollen river . Additionally , a body of a man was recovered near Santa Cruz del Sur . Hundreds of livestock drowned , and telephone and telegraph services were disrupted in many areas . Losses in Cuba were estimated to have reached $ 100 @,@ 000 . Ella had a role in the Cuban Revolution as the government troops of Fulgencio Batista y <unk> stayed in their barracks during the storm while the rebels made progress under cover of Ella . Later , when the guerrillas heard about Hurricane Fifi on the radio , Che Guevara taught his illiterate comrades that entities like tropical cyclones are named in alphabetical order . 
 The outerbands of Ella produced gale force winds in the Florida Keys , causing damage mainly to antennas , fences , shrubbery , and signs . Winds on Stock Island damaged and overturned 4 trailers . Further north in Miami , a freighter was disabled and had to be towed in to port by the United States Coast Guard . Due to fears of a storm similar to Hurricane Audrey in the previous year , some residents evacuated southwestern Louisiana . An estimated 1 @,@ 500 fled inland as Ella approached , leaving only 100 people to ride out the storm . In Louisiana , squalls from Ella caused the collision of two ocean @-@ bound freighters along the Mississippi River near New Orleans . Impact elsewhere in Louisiana was limited to minor damage to rice crops in the southwestern portion of the state . On 35 oil platforms offshore of Houston , Texas , 1 @,@ 400 people were alerted about possible evacuations if Ella were to approach the area . Along the coast , there were evacuations in Indianola , Port Alto , Port O 'Connor , and Sabine Pass . Ella brought heavy rains to eastern and southern Texas , including 13 @.@ 1 in ( 330 mm ) in Galveston . Precipitation brought minor flooding to low lying areas of the Bolivar Peninsula , Galveston Island , Kemah , La Marque , the Matagorda Peninsula , Seabrook , and Texas City . Ella also brought swells to the coast of Texas . A portion of Texas State Highway 87 was closed due to inundation between Sabine Pass and High Island . Further south , tidal flooding along Texas State Highway 316 caused the closure of the portion near Indianola . Offshore , a 65 ft ( 20 m ) shrimp trawler sank during the storm , after being smashed against the rocks near Galveston . The crew fled to the life boats and were later rescued by a United States Coast Guard Patrol Vessel . The captain of the snapper boat E. W. Fowler went missing after he was washed overboard ; the man was later presumed to have drowned . 
 = The Story of Miss Moppet = 
 The Story of Miss Moppet is a tale about teasing , featuring a kitten and a mouse , that was written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter . It was published by Frederick Warne & Co for the 1906 Christmas season . Potter was born in London in 1866 , and between 1902 and 1905 published a series of small format children 's books with Warne . In 1906 , she experimented with an atypical panorama design for Miss Moppet , which booksellers disliked ; the story was reprinted in 1916 in small book format . 
 Miss Moppet , the story 's eponymous main character , is a kitten teased by a mouse . While pursuing him she bumps her head on a cupboard . She then wraps a duster about her head , and sits before the fire " looking very ill " . The curious mouse creeps closer , is captured , " and because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppet — Miss Moppet thinks she will tease the Mouse ; which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet " . She ties him up in the duster and tosses him about . However , the mouse makes his escape , and once safely out of reach , dances a jig atop the cupboard . 
 Although , critically , The Story of Miss Moppet is considered one of Potter 's lesser efforts , for young children it is valued as an introduction to books in general , and to the world of Peter Rabbit . The character of Miss Moppet was released as a porcelain figurine in 1954 and a plush toy in 1973 . The book has been published in a Braille version , translated into seven languages , and was released in an electronic format in 2005 . First editions in the original format are available through antiquarian booksellers . 
 = = Background = = 
 Helen Beatrix Potter was born on July 28 1866 to barrister Rupert William Potter and his wife Helen ( Leech ) Potter in London . She was educated by governesses and tutors , and passed a quiet childhood reading , painting , drawing , tending a nursery menagerie of small animals , and visiting museums and art exhibitions . Her interests in the natural world and country life were nurtured with holidays in Scotland , the Lake District , and Camfield Place , the Hertfordshire home of her paternal grandparents . 
 Potter 's adolescence was as quiet as her childhood . She matured into a spinsterish young woman whose parents groomed her to be a permanent resident and housekeeper in their home . She continued to paint and draw , and experienced her first professional artistic success in 1890 when she sold six illustrations of her pet rabbit to a greeting card publisher . She hoped to lead a useful life independent of her parents , and tentatively considered a career in mycology , but the all @-@ male scientific community regarded her as nothing more than an amateur and she abandoned fungi . 
 In 1900 , Potter revised a tale that she had written for a child in 1893 , fashioning it into a dummy book similar to the size and style of Helen Bannerman 's The Story of Little Black Sambo . Unable to find a buyer for her book , partially because the children 's book market of the time depended on brightly coloured illustrations unlike Potter 's line drawings , she decided to publish it privately in December 1901 . Frederick Warne & Co had once rejected the tale but , to maintain their position in the small format children 's book market , reconsidered and accepted the " bunny book " ( as the firm called it ) following the recommendation of their prominent children 's book artist L. Leslie Brooke . Potter agreed to colour her pen and ink illustrations according to Warne 's requirements , and she suggested Warne use the new Hentschel three @-@ colour printing technique in the printing process for The Tale of Peter Rabbit . 
 Potter continued to publish children 's books with Warne , and by 1905 she found herself financially independent . Her books were selling well , and her income , combined with a small inheritance , allowed her to buy Hill Top , a farm of 34 acres ( 14 ha ) at Near Sawrey in the Lake District in July of that year . When her longtime editor and fiancé Norman Warne died a few weeks after their secret engagement , she became depressed , but went on to devote herself to her stories . 
 = = Development and publication = = 
 In 1906 , as Potter was finishing The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher , she considered developing books for a younger audience . Three stories were the result : The Story of Miss Moppet , The Story of A Fierce Bad Rabbit and The Sly Old Cat . Inspired by George Cruikshank 's illustrations , she intended to have the stories published in " panoramic format in the style of Cruikshank 's Comic Alphabet " , as explained by Taylor . The panorama format consisted of " long strips of paper , on which the individual pages of pictures and text were arranged in order from left to right . " 
 Potter was at Hill Top in July 1906 during the development of Miss Moppet , and the kitten she borrowed as a model from a mason from Windermere was a difficult subject . " [ A ] n exasperating model , " Potter wrote , " I have borrowed a Kitten and I am rather glad of the opportunity of working at the drawings . It is very young and pretty and a most fearful pickle . " Biographer Linda Lear explains that " pickle " was a word Potter used to describe " free @-@ thinking exuberant people , like her cousin Caroline , or mischievous kittens and small children . " Potter used the same drawings of the kitten as a model for her next book , The Tale of Tom Kitten , which she dedicated in 1907 " to all Pickles — especially those that get upon my garden wall " . Miss Moppet is one of Tom Kitten 's sisters , and appears as a character in both books featuring him : The Tale of Tom Kitten and The Tale of Samuel Whiskers or The Roly @-@ Poly Pudding ( 1908 ) . 
 Potter was an admirer of American author Joel Chandler Harris and created a series of plates in the 1890s for his Uncle Remus stories , possibly in an attempt to find career direction . So deep was her admiration , Lear speculates the scene of Miss Moppet wrapping her head in the duster comes from a similar scene in an Uncle Remus tale in which Br 'er Fox " feigns illness in a rocking chair , wrapped up with flannel " . Potter was modeling her sketches from a young kitten and , wanting not to show cruelty , she wrote of the kitten : " She should catch him by the tail / less unpleasant " . Children 's literature scholar Peter Hunt writes that Potter was careful to protect her young audience from graphic details and she refused to depict death in her stories . 
 Ten thousand copies of The Story of Miss Moppet were released in a panorama format priced at a shilling in November 1906 , and another 10 @,@ 000 copies in December 1906 . There were no subsequent printings in the panorama format . The strip folded accordion @-@ fashion into a grey cloth wallet measuring 108 by 89 millimetres ( 4 @.@ 3 in × 3 @.@ 5 in ) . When opened , the panorama strip measured 108 by 2 @,@ 492 millimetres ( 4 @.@ 3 in × 98 @.@ 1 in ) . As Lear writes , Potter " experimented with a panorama format of fourteen pictures on one long strip of paper which folded into a wallet tied with a ribbon " . Lear explains that the format " although popular with readers was ultimately unsuccessful , because shopkeepers found them difficult to keep folded " . Potter referred to this fact late in life when she said , " Bad Rabbit and Moppet were originally printed on long strips — The shops sensibly refused to stock them because they got unrolled and so bad to fold up again " . MacDonald points out that the fragile panorama format was inappropriate for very young children . 
 Twenty thousand copies of The Story of A Fierce Bad Rabbit were published in panorama format in November and December 1906 in exactly the same measurements as Miss Moppet . Both were later published in a small book 122 by 103 millimetres ( 4 @.@ 8 in × 4 @.@ 1 in ) format . The Sly Old Cat was scheduled for publication in 1907 but fell victim to the pressures exerted by booksellers . It was set aside , but was proposed for publication in 1916 as The Story of the Sly Old Cat . Potter 's eyesight was failing and she refused to develop it . The story was published in book format with Potter 's 1906 rough sketches for the first time in 1971 . It is not included in the standard 23 @-@ volume Peter Rabbit library . 
 By 1916 Frederick Warne & Co had discontinued Miss Moppet in its panorama format , and republished the story in a book format that year . Potter illustrated a frontispiece of the kitten and mouse seated in profile , and a title page vignette of a mouse on all fours facing the reader for the book format . At 113 by 92 millimetres ( 4 @.@ 4 by 3 @.@ 6 in ) , the book 's dimensions were smaller than other Peter Rabbit books . In 1917 , she suggested to her publisher that <unk> <unk> 's Nursery Rhymes be published in the smaller Miss Moppet format . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The tale opens with an illustration of a wide @-@ eyed kitten : " This is a Pussy called Miss Moppet , she thinks she has heard a mouse ! " The following illustration depicts a mouse wearing a pink bowtie and green jacket " peeping out behind the cupboard , and making fun of Miss Moppet . He is not afraid of a kitten . " Miss Moppet darts at him , but misses and bumps her head on the cupboard . She hits the cupboard very hard and rubs her nose . The mouse <unk> to the top of the cupboard and watches her . 
 Miss Moppet ties a duster about her head and sits before the fire on a red <unk> . The mouse 's curiosity is piqued ; he thinks she looks very ill and comes sliding down the bell @-@ pull . " Miss Moppet looks worse and worse . " The mouse creeps nearer . Miss Moppet holds her head in her paws and peeks at the mouse through a hole in the duster . " The Mouse comes very close . " Miss Moppet jumps and snags him by the tail . 
 " And because the Mouse has teased Miss Moppet — Miss Moppet thinks she will tease the Mouse ; which is not at all nice of Miss Moppet . " The kitten ties the mouse up in the duster then tosses it about like a ball . The mouse peeks from the hole in the duster . In the last illustration but one , Miss Moppet is seated upright on her rump and staring at the reader . The duster lies opened and empty in her paws . " She forgot about that hole in the duster " , and the mouse has escaped . He dances a jig safely out of Miss Moppet 's reach atop the cupboard . 
 = = Scholarly commentaries = = 
 James M. Redfield , a classics professor at the University of Chicago , in his article " An Aristotelian Analysis of Miss Moppet " finds the story follows the tenets of Aristotle 's Poetics , with a definite beginning ( the unsuccessful attempt to catch the mouse ) , middle ( Miss Moppet pretending to be hurt and catching the mouse ) , and end ( Miss Moppet teasing the mouse and his escape ) . Redfield notes that Potter makes the outcome of the plot uncertain and creates parity between the characters , which are naturally predator and prey ; Potter makes Miss Moppet " young , inexperienced , female , and a pet " , while the mouse is " mature , courageous , male , and independent " . Redfield praises Potter 's skill as an author ; she uses the hole in the duster twice — to allow Miss Moppet to catch the mouse , but then for him to escape her — and uses phrases particularly suited for a parent to read aloud to a child ( " This is the mouse ... " ) . Redfield concludes that while teasing is bad in the story — dangerous for the mouse , and cruel for the cat — Potter herself teases the reader in a good way , showing " us that teasing is a kind of loving when it is a kind of teaching . The poet plays with us , and by taking us through an unreal experience , teaches us what it is to live in the real world . " 
 In her essay " Thoroughly Post @-@ Victorian , Pre @-@ Modern Beatrix " professor of English Katherine Chandler points out that Potter , unlike most Victorian writers of children 's books , wrote original stories based on the realism of animal behaviour . Chandler notes that Potter avoids moralizing in her tales , making Miss Moppet nothing more than a story describing the natural behaviour of kittens . Potter 's anthropomorphized animals are in fact slightly naughty , yet in their naughtiness the punishment is never the moral of the tale . At the end of Miss Moppet , the kitten is not punished and the mouse dances on the cupboard . This leads Chandler to quote literary scholar of modernism Humphrey Carpenter , " there is nothing in [ Potter 's ] work that resembles the moral tale . In fact if might be argued that she is writing something pretty close to a series of immoral tales " . In addition Chandler notes that Potter 's economic use of prose presages modernism , comparing her writing to that of Ernest Hemingway . 
 Ruth K. MacDonald , English and children 's literature professor at New Mexico State University , agrees , writing in Beatrix Potter that Miss Moppet demonstrates Potter 's ability to pare text and illustrations to essentials noting that she worked best with more complicated plots , more complicated characters , and stories with specific settings rather than generalized backgrounds . Miss Moppet is a vignette , she indicates , rather than the typical Potter tale of causality , extended plot , and variety of character , and depends upon the archetypal animosity between cat and mouse with the cat being the dominant character . 
 Miss Moppet was more successful than its companion piece The Story of A Fierce Bad Rabbit according to M. Daphne Kutzer , an English professor at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh and author of Beatrix Potter : Writing in Code ( 2003 ) . Kutzer writes : " the illustrations are more fluid and the storyline more humorous and less moralistic " . Potter was never at her best when writing for a clearly defined audience , Kutzer observes , and in writing a Victorian moral tale about teasing , Potter failed to completely engage the reader 's imagination in either the story or the illustrations . Though , as MacDonald notes , Miss Moppet remains in the Potter canon , and serves as a good initial approach to Potter 's literature . 
 = = Merchandise = = 
 Potter asserted her tales would one day be nursery classics , and part of the " longevity of her books comes from strategy " , writes Potter biographer Ruth MacDonald . She was the first to exploit the commercial possibilities of her characters and tales ; between 1903 and 1905 these included a Peter Rabbit stuffed toy , an unpublished board game , and nursery wallpaper . Similar " side @-@ shows " ( as she termed the ancillary merchandise ) were produced throughout her life . For a number of years Potter designed Christmas cards with characters from her books that were sold to raise money for charities . 
 Potter died on December 22 , 1943 , and left her home and the original illustrations for almost all of her books , including Miss Moppet , to the National Trust . Hilltop was opened to visitors in 1946 , and displayed her original artwork there until 1985 . After Potter 's death , Frederick Warne & Co granted licences to various firms for the production of merchandise based on her characters . Beswick Pottery of Longton , Staffordshire released a porcelain figurine of Miss Moppet in 1954 ; the firm was eventually acquired by Royal Doulton which continued to issue the figurine under the " Royal Albert " brand until it was discontinued in 2002 . From 1980 to 1995 when it went out of business , Schmid & Co. of Toronto and Randolph , Massachusetts produced a Miss Moppet music box figurine . From 1983 to 1991 , Schmid distributed two Miss Moppet Christmas ornaments ( 3 and 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 76 and 38 mm ) tall ) , made by the Italian firm ANRI . Stuffed toy manufacturers requested licensing for Potter 's figures early in the 20th century ; however she refused to grant permission , having been disappointed with the quality of the proposed stuffed toys . Frederick Warne & Co retained rights to all Potter merchandise and in 1973 granted a license to the Eden Toys company of Jersey City , New Jersey to manufacture stuffed animals based on Potter 's characters . Beginning in 1975 these included a plush Miss Moppet , which was discontinued in 2001 when Eden Toys went out of business . 
 = = Reprints and translations = = 
 As of 2010 , all 23 of Potter 's small format books , including Miss Moppet , remain in print , and are available as a complete set in a presentation box . A 400 @-@ page omnibus edition is also available , as is an electronic format , released in 2005 . First edition and early edition Potter books are offered by antiquarian booksellers . 
 Although sold to Penguin Books in 1984 , Frederick Warne & Co remained a subsidiary company and continues to publish Potter 's books . A 2002 Publishers Weekly article , written for the centennial of the publication of The Tale of Peter Rabbit , reported that Potter was considered one of the most popular classic writers , that anniversary editions of her work were published in 1993 and 2002 , and the artwork has been " re @-@ scanned to make the illustrations look fresher and brighter " . The Frederick Warne name still appears on editions of Potter 's books in English . 
 Languages that Miss Moppet has been translated into include Chinese , French , German , Italian , Japanese , Spanish , and Vietnamese , and a Braille edition in English has been prepared . Miss Moppet was parodied by Nicholas Garland in a <unk> cartoon in the 11 June 1976 issue of the New Statesman . Margaret Thatcher had lost a motion of no confidence in the government of Prime Minister James Callaghan , and Garland 's cartoon copied the text and parodied four panels of the story , with Callaghan as the mouse who escapes Thatcher the kitten . In 1986 , MacDonald observed that Potter 's books had become a " traditional part of childhood in most only English @-@ speaking countries and in many of the countries into whose languages Potter 's books have been translated " . 
 = 1907 Tiflis bank robbery = 
 The 1907 Tiflis bank robbery , also known as the Yerevan Square expropriation , was an armed robbery on 26 June 1907 in the city of Tiflis ( now Georgia 's capital , Tbilisi ) . A bank cash shipment was stolen by Bolsheviks to fund their revolutionary activities . The robbers attacked a bank stagecoach and surrounding police and military using bombs and guns while the stagecoach was transporting money through Yerevan Square ( now Freedom Square ) between the post office and the Tiflis branch of the State Bank of the Russian Empire . The attack killed forty people and injured fifty others , according to official archive documents . The robbers escaped with 341 @,@ 000 rubles ( equivalent to around US 3 @.@ 4 million in 2008 ) . 
 The robbery was organized by a number of top @-@ level Bolsheviks , including Vladimir Lenin , Joseph Stalin , Maxim Litvinov , Leonid Krasin , and Alexander Bogdanov , and executed by a gang of revolutionaries led by Stalin 's early associate Ter @-@ Petrosian ( Kamo ) . Because such activities were explicitly prohibited by the 5th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party ( RSDLP ) , the robbery and the killings caused outrage within the party against the Bolsheviks ( a faction within the RSDLP ) . As a result , Lenin and Stalin tried to distance themselves from the robbery . The events surrounding the incident and similar robberies split the Bolshevik leadership , with Lenin against Bogdanov and Krasin . Despite the success of the robbery and the large sum involved , the Bolsheviks could not use most of the large bank notes obtained from the robbery because their serial numbers were known to the police . Lenin conceived of a plan to have various individuals cash the large bank notes at once at various locations throughout Europe in January 1908 , but this strategy failed , resulting in a number of arrests , worldwide publicity , and negative reaction from European social democrats . 
 Kamo was caught in Germany shortly after the robbery but successfully avoided a criminal trial by feigning insanity for more than three years . He managed to escape from his psychiatric ward but was captured two years later while planning another robbery . Kamo was then sentenced to death for his crimes including the 1907 robbery , but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment ; he was released after the 1917 Revolution . None of the other major participants or organizers of the robbery were ever brought to trial . After his death , a grave and monument to Kamo was erected near Yerevan Square in Pushkin Gardens . This monument was later removed , and Kamo 's remains moved elsewhere .

 The RSDLP , the predecessor to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union , was formed in 1898 . The goal of the RSDLP was to change the economic and political system in the Russian Empire through a proletarian revolution in accordance with Marxist doctrine . Alongside their political activities , the RSDLP and other revolutionary groups ( such as anarchists and Socialist Revolutionaries ) practised a range of militant operations , including " expropriations " , a euphemism for armed robberies of government or private funds to support revolutionary activities . 
 From 1903 onwards , the RSDLP were divided between two major groups : the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks . After the suppression of the 1905 Revolution by the Russian Empire , the RSDLP held its 5th Congress in May – June 1907 in London with the hopes of resolving differences between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks . One issue that still separated the two groups was the divergence of their views on militant activities , and in particular , " expropriations " . The most militant Bolsheviks , led at the 5th Congress by Vladimir Lenin , supported continuation of the use of robberies , while Mensheviks advocated a more peaceful and gradual approach to revolution , and opposed militant operations . At the 5th Congress , a resolution was passed condemning participation in or assistance to all militant activity , including " expropriations " as " disorganizing and demoralizing " , and called for all party militias to be disbanded . This resolution passed with 65 per cent supporting and 6 per cent opposing ( others abstained or did not vote ) with all Mensheviks and even some Bolsheviks supporting the resolution . 
 Despite the unified party 's prohibition on separate committees , during the 5th Congress the Bolsheviks elected their own governing body , called the Bolshevik Centre , and kept it secret from the rest of the RSDLP . The Bolshevik Centre was headed by a " Finance Group " consisting of Lenin , Leonid Krasin and Alexander Bogdanov . Among other party activities , the Bolshevik leadership had already planned a number of " expropriations " in different parts of Russia by the time of the 5th Congress and was awaiting a major robbery in Tiflis , which occurred only weeks after the 5th Congress ended . 
 = = Preparation = = 
 Before the 5th Congress met , high @-@ ranking Bolsheviks held a meeting in Berlin in April 1907 to discuss staging a robbery to obtain funds to purchase arms . Attendees included Lenin , Krasin , Bogdanov , Joseph Stalin , and Maxim Litvinov . The group decided that Stalin , then known by his earlier nom de guerre Koba , and the Armenian Simon Ter @-@ Petrossian , known as Kamo , should organize a bank robbery in the city of Tiflis . 
 The 29 @-@ year @-@ old Stalin was living in Tiflis with his wife Ekaterina and newborn son Yakov . Stalin was experienced at organizing robberies , and these exploits had helped him gain a reputation as the Centre 's principal financier . Kamo , four years younger than Stalin , had a reputation for ruthlessness ; later in his life he cut a man 's heart from his chest . At the time of the conspiracy , Kamo ran a criminal organization called " the Outfit " . Stalin said that Kamo was " a master of disguise " , and Lenin called Kamo his " Caucasian bandit " . Stalin and Kamo had grown up together , and Stalin had converted Kamo to Marxism . 
 After the April meeting , Stalin and Litvinov travelled to Tiflis to inform Kamo of the plans and to organize the raid . According to Roman Brackman 's The Secret File of Joseph Stalin : A Hidden Life , while Stalin was working with the Bolsheviks to organize criminal activities , he was also acting as an informant for the Okhrana , the Russian secret police . Brackman alleges that once the group returned to Tiflis , Stalin informed his Okhrana contact , Officer Mukhtarov , about the bank robbery plans and promised to provide the Okhrana with more information at a later time . 
 In Tiflis , Stalin began planning for the robbery . He established contact with two individuals with inside information about the State Bank 's operations : a bank clerk named <unk> <unk> and an old school friend of Stalin 's named Voznesensky who worked at the Tiflis banking mail office . Voznesensky later stated that he had helped out in the theft out of admiration for Stalin 's romantic poetry . Voznesensky worked in the Tiflis banking mail office , giving him access to a secret schedule that showed the times that cash would be transferred by stagecoach to the Tiflis branch of the State Bank . Voznesensky notified Stalin that the bank would be receiving a large shipment of money by horse @-@ drawn carriage on 26 June 1907 . 
 Krasin helped manufacture bombs to use in the attack on the stagecoach . Kamo 's gang smuggled bombs into Tiflis by hiding them inside a sofa . Only weeks before the robbery , Kamo accidentally detonated one of Krasin 's bombs while trying to set the fuse . The blast severely injured him in the eye , leaving a permanent scar . Kamo was confined to his bed for a month owing to intense pain , and had not fully recovered by the time of the robbery . 
 = = Day of the robbery = = 
 On the day of the robbery , 26 June 1907 , the 20 organizers , including Stalin , met near Yerevan Square ( just 2 minutes from the seminary , bank and viceroy 's palace ) to finalize their plans , and after the meeting , they went to their designated places in preparation for the attack . The Russian authorities had become aware that some large action was being planned by revolutionaries in Tiflis , and had increased the security presence in the main square ; just prior to the robbery , they had been tipped off and were guarding every street corner in Yerevan Square . To deal with the increased security , gang members spotted patrolling gendarmes and police prior to the robbery and lookouts were posted looking down on the square from above . 
 The gang members mostly dressed themselves as peasants and waited on street corners with revolvers and grenades . In contrast to the others , Kamo was disguised as a cavalry captain and came to the square in a horse @-@ drawn phaeton , a type of open carriage . 
 The conspirators took over the <unk> tavern facing the square in preparation for the robbery . A witness , David <unk> , later stated that he had been walking in Yerevan Square when a friend named <unk> Kupriashvili , who later turned out to be one of the robbers , invited him into a tavern and asked him to stay . Once inside the tavern , <unk> realized that armed men were stopping people from leaving . When they received a signal that the bank stagecoach was nearing the square , the armed men quickly left the building with pistols drawn . 
 The Tiflis branch of the State Bank of the Russian Empire had arranged to transport funds between the post office and the State Bank by horse @-@ drawn stagecoach . Inside the stagecoach was the money , two guards with rifles , a bank cashier , and a bank accountant . A phaeton filled with armed soldiers rode behind the stagecoach , and mounted cossacks rode in front , next to , and behind the carriages . 
 = = = Attack = = = 
 The stagecoach made its way through the crowded square at about 10 : 30 am . Kupriashvili gave the signal , and the robbers hit the carriage with grenades , killing many of the horses and guards , and began shooting security men guarding the stagecoach and the square . Bombs were thrown from all directions . The Georgian newspaper <unk> reported : " No one could tell if the terrible shooting was the boom of cannons or explosion of bombs ... The sound caused panic everywhere ... almost across the whole city , people started running . Carriages and carts were galloping away " . The blasts were so strong that they knocked over nearby chimneys and broke every pane of glass for a mile around . Ekaterina <unk> , Stalin 's wife , was standing on a balcony at their home near the square with her family and young child . When they heard the explosions , they rushed back into the house terrified . 
 One of the injured horses harnessed to the bank stagecoach bolted , pulling the stagecoach with it , chased by Kupriashvili , Kamo , and another robber , <unk> <unk> . Kupriashvili threw a grenade that blew off the horse 's legs , but Kupriashvili was caught in the explosion , landing stunned on the ground . He regained consciousness and sneaked out of the square before police and military reinforcements arrived . <unk> snatched the sacks of money from the stagecoach while Kamo rode up firing his pistol , and they and another robber threw the money into Kamo 's phaeton . Pressed for time , they inadvertently left twenty thousand rubles behind , some of which was pocketed by one of the stagecoach drivers who was later arrested for the theft . 
 = = = Escape and aftermath = = = 
 After securing the money , Kamo quickly rode out of the square ; encountering a police carriage , he pretended to be a captain of the cavalry , shouting , " The money 's safe . Run to the square . " The deputy in the carriage obeyed , realizing only later that he had been fooled by an escaping robber . Kamo then rode to the gang 's headquarters where he changed out of his uniform . All of the robbers quickly scattered , and none were caught . 
 One of the robbers , <unk> <unk> , stole a teacher 's uniform to disguise himself and came back to the square , gazing at the carnage . Fifty casualties lay wounded in the square along with the dead people and horses . The authorities stated that only three people had died , but documents in the Okhrana archives reveal that the true number was around forty . 
 The State Bank was not sure how much it actually lost from the robbery , but the best estimates were around 341 @,@ 000 rubles , worth around 3 @.@ 4 million US dollars as of 2008 . About 91 @,@ 000 rubles were in small untraceable bills , with the rest in large 500 @-@ ruble notes that were difficult to exchange because their serial numbers were known to the police . 
 = = = Stalin 's role = = = 
 Stalin 's exact actions on the day of the robbery are unknown and disputed . One source , P. A. Pavlenko , claimed that Stalin attacked the carriage itself and had been wounded by a bomb fragment . Kamo later stated that Stalin took no active part in the robbery and had watched it from a distance . Another source stated in a police report that Stalin " observed the ruthless bloodshed , smoking a cigarette , from the courtyard of a mansion . " Another source claims that Stalin was actually at the railway station during the robbery and not at the square . Stalin 's sister @-@ in @-@ law stated that Stalin came home the night of the robbery and told his family about its success . 
 Stalin 's role was later questioned by fellow revolutionaries Boris Nicolaevsky and Leon Trotsky . The latter , Stalin 's rival , was later assassinated on orders from Stalin . In his book Stalin – An Appraisal of the Man and his Influence , Trotsky analyzed many publications describing the Tiflis expropriation and other Bolshevik militant activities of that time , and concluded , " Others did the fighting ; Stalin supervised them from afar " . In general , according to Nicolaevsky , " The role played by Stalin in the activities of the Kamo group was subsequently exaggerated " . Kun later discovered official archive documents however clearly showing that " from late 1904 or early 1905 Stalin took part in drawing up plans for expropriations " , adding , " It is now certain that [ Stalin ] controlled from the wings the initial plans of the group " that carried out the Tiflis robbery .

 The robbery featured in headlines worldwide : " Rain of Bombs : Revolutionaries Hurl Destruction among Large Crowds of People " in the London Daily Mirror , " Tiflis Bomb Outrage " in The Times of London , " Catastrophe ! " in Le Temps in Paris , and " Bomb Kills Many ; $ 170 @,@ 000 Captured " in The New York Times . 
 Authorities mobilized the army , closed roads , and surrounded the square hoping to secure the money and capture the criminals . A special detective unit was brought in to lead the police investigation . Unfortunately for the investigators , witness testimony was confusing and conflicting , and the authorities did not know which group was responsible for the robbery . Polish socialists , Armenians , anarchists , Socialist @-@ Revolutionaries , and even the Russian State itself were blamed . 
 According to Brackman , several days after the robbery the Okhrana agent Mukhtarov questioned Stalin in a secret apartment . The agents had heard rumors that Stalin had been seen watching passively during the robbery . Mukhtarov asked Stalin why he had not informed them about it , and Stalin stated that he had provided adequate information to the authorities to prevent the theft . The questioning escalated into a heated argument ; Mukhtarov hit Stalin in the face and had to be restrained by other Okhrana officers . After this incident , <unk> was suspended from the Okhrana , and Stalin was ordered to leave Tiflis and go to Baku to await a decision in the case . Stalin left Baku with 20 @,@ 000 rubles in stolen money in July 1907 . While Brackman claims to have found evidence of this incident , whether Stalin cooperated with the Okhrana during his early life has been a subject of debate among historians for many decades and has yet to be resolved . 
 = = Moving the money and Kamo 's arrest = = 
 The funds from the robbery were originally kept at the house of Stalin 's friends in Tiflis , Mikha and Maro <unk> . The money was sewn into a mattress so that it could be moved and stored easily without arousing suspicion . The mattress was moved to another safe house , then later put on the director 's couch at the Tiflis Meteorological Observatory , possibly because Stalin had worked there . Some sources claim that Stalin himself helped put the money in the observatory . The director stated that he never knew that the stolen money had been stored under his roof . 
 A large portion of the stolen money was eventually moved by Kamo , who took the money to Lenin in Finland , which was then part of the Russian Empire . Kamo spent the remaining summer months staying with Lenin at his dacha . That autumn , Kamo traveled to Paris , to Belgium to buy arms and ammunition , and to Bulgaria to buy 200 detonators . He next traveled to Berlin and delivered a letter from Lenin to a prominent Bolshevik physician , Yakov Zhitomirsky , asking him to treat Kamo 's eye , which had not completely healed from the bomb blast . Unknown to Lenin , Zhitomirsky had been secretly working as an agent of the Russian government and quickly informed the Okhrana , who asked the Berlin police to arrest Kamo . When they did so , they found a forged Austrian passport and a suitcase with the detonators , which he was planning to use in another large bank robbery . 
 = = Cashing the marked notes = = 
 After hearing of Kamo 's arrest , Lenin feared that he too might be arrested and fled from Finland with his wife . To avoid being followed , Lenin walked three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) across a frozen lake at night to catch a steamer at a nearby island . On his trek across the ice , Lenin and his two companions nearly drowned when the ice started to give way underneath them ; Lenin later admitted it seemed like it would have been a " stupid way to die " . Lenin and his wife escaped and headed to Switzerland . 
 The unmarked bills from the robbery were easy to exchange , but the serial numbers of the 500 @-@ ruble notes were known to the authorities , making them impossible to exchange in Russian banks . By the end of 1907 , Lenin decided to exchange the remaining 500 @-@ ruble notes abroad . Krasin had his forger try to change some of the serial numbers . Two hundred of these notes were transported abroad by Martyn Lyadov ( they were sewn into his vest by the wives of Lenin and Bogdanov at Lenin 's headquarters in <unk> ) . Lenin 's plan was to have various individuals exchange the stolen 500 @-@ ruble notes simultaneously at a number of banks throughout Europe . Zhitomirsky heard of the plan and reported it to the Okhrana , who contacted police departments throughout Europe asking them to arrest anyone who tried to cash the notes . 
 In January 1908 , a number of individuals were arrested while attempting to exchange the notes . The New York Times reported that one woman who had tried to cash a marked 500 @-@ ruble note later tried to swallow evidence of her plans to meet her accomplices after the police were summoned , but the police stopped her from swallowing the paper by grabbing her throat , retrieved the paper , and later arrested her accomplices at the train station . Most prominent among those arrested was Maxim Litvinov , caught while boarding a train with his mistress at Paris 's Gare du Nord with twelve of the 500 @-@ ruble notes he intended to cash in London . The French Minister of Justice expelled Litvinov and his mistress from French territory , outraging the Russian government , which had requested his extradition . Officially the French government stated that Russia 's request for extradition had been submitted too late , but by some accounts , they denied the extradition because French socialists had applied political pressure to secure his release . 
 Nadezhda Krupskaya , Lenin 's wife , discussed these events in her memoirs : 
 The money obtained in the Tiflis raid was handed over to the Bolsheviks for revolutionary purposes . But the money could not be used . It was all in 500 @-@ ruble notes , which had to be changed . This could not be done in Russia , as the banks always had lists of the note numbers in such cases ... The money was badly needed . And so a group of comrades made an attempt to change the 500 @-@ ruble notes simultaneously in various towns abroad , just a few days after our arrival ... Zhitomirsky had warned the police about the attempt to change the ruble notes , and those involved in it were arrested . A member of the Zurich group , a Lett , was arrested in Stockholm , and Olga <unk> , a member of the Geneva group , who had recently returned from Russia , was arrested in Munich with <unk> and <unk> . In Geneva N. A. <unk> was arrested after a postcard addressed to one of the arrested men was delivered to his house . 
 Brackman claims that despite the arrests , Lenin continued his attempts to exchange the 500 @-@ ruble notes and did manage to trade some of them for 10 @,@ 000 rubles from an unknown woman in Moscow . According to Nicolaevsky , however , Lenin abandoned attempts to exchange the notes after the arrests , but Bogdanov tried ( and failed ) to exchange some notes in North America , while Krasin succeeded in forging new serial numbers and managed to exchange several more notes . Soon after , Lenin 's associates burned all the 500 @-@ ruble notes remaining in their possession .

 [ R ] <unk> to death , absolutely calm . On my grave there should already be grass growing six feet high . One can 't escape death forever . One must die some day . But I will try my luck again . Try any way of escape . Perhaps we shall once more have the laugh over our enemies ... I am in irons . Do what you like . I am ready for anything . " 
 After Kamo was arrested in Berlin and awaiting trial , he received a note from Krasin through his lawyer Oscar Kohn telling him to feign insanity so that he would be declared unfit to stand trial . To demonstrate his insanity , he refused food , tore his clothes , tore out his hair , attempted to hang himself , slashed his wrists , and ate his own excrement . To make sure that he was not faking his condition , German doctors stuck pins under his nails , struck him in the back with a long needle , and burned him with hot irons , but he did not break his act . After all of these tests , the chief doctor of the Berlin asylum wrote in June 1909 that " there is no foundation to the belief that [ Kamo ] is feigning insanity . He is without doubt mentally ill , is incapable of appearing before a court , or of serving sentence . It is extremely doubtful that he can completely recover . " 
 In 1909 Kamo was extradited to a Russian prison , where he continued to feign insanity . In April 1910 , he was put on trial for his role in the Tiflis robbery , where he ignored the proceedings and openly fed a pet bird that he had hidden in his shirt . The trial was suspended while officials determined his sanity . The court eventually found that he had been sane when he committed the Tiflis robbery , but was presently mentally ill and should be confined until he recovered . In August 1911 , after feigning insanity for more than three years , Kamo escaped from the psychiatric ward of a prison in Tiflis by sawing through his window bars and climbing down a homemade rope . 
 Kamo later discussed these experiences : 
 What can I tell you ? They threw me about , hit me over the legs and the like . One of the men forced me to look into the mirror . There I saw − not the reflection of myself , but rather of some thin , ape @-@ like man , gruesome and horrible looking , grinding his teeth . I thought to myself , " Maybe I 've really gone mad ! " It was a terrible moment , but I regained my bearings and spat upon the mirror . You know I think they liked that ... I thought a great deal : " Will I survive or will I really go mad ? " That was not good . I did not have faith in myself , see ? ... [ The authorities ] , of course , know their business , their science . But they do not know the Caucasians . Maybe every Caucasian is insane , as far as they are concerned . Well , who will drive whom mad ? Nothing developed . They stuck to their guns and I to mine . In Tiflis , they didn 't torture me . Apparently they thought that the Germans can make no mistakes . 
 After escaping , Kamo met up with Lenin in Paris , and was distressed to hear that a " rupture had occurred " between Lenin , Bogdanov , and Krasin . Kamo told Lenin about his arrest and how he had simulated insanity while in prison . After leaving Paris , Kamo eventually met up with Krasin and planned another armed robbery . Kamo was caught before the robbery took place and was put on trial in Tiflis in 1913 for his exploits including the Tiflis bank robbery . This time , Kamo did not feign insanity while imprisoned , but he did pretend that he had forgotten all that happened to him when he was previously " insane " . The trial was brief and Kamo was given four death sentences . 
 Seemingly doomed to death , Kamo then had the good luck along with other prisoners to have his sentence commuted to a long prison term as part of the celebrations of the Romanov dynasty tricentennial in 1913 . Kamo was released from prison after the February Revolution in 1917 .

 = = = Effect on Bolsheviks = = = 
 Apart from Kamo , none of the organizers of the robbery were ever brought to trial , and initially it was not clear who was behind the raid , but after the arrest of Kamo , Litvinov and others , the Bolshevik involvement became obvious . The Mensheviks felt betrayed and angry ; the robbery proved that the Bolshevik Centre operated independently from the unified Central Committee and was taking actions explicitly prohibited by the party congress . The leader of the Mensheviks , Georgi Plekhanov , called for separation from the Bolsheviks . Plekhanov 's colleague , Julius Martov , said the Bolshevik Centre was something between a secret factional central committee and a criminal gang . The Tiflis Committee of the party expelled Stalin and several members for the robbery . The party 's investigations into Lenin 's conduct were thwarted by the Bolsheviks . 
 The robbery made the Bolsheviks even less popular in Georgia and left the Bolsheviks in Tiflis without effective leadership . After the death by natural causes of his wife Ekaterina <unk> in November 1907 , Stalin rarely returned to Tiflis . Other leading Bolsheviks in Georgia , such as Mikhail <unk> and <unk> <unk> , were largely absent from Georgia after 1907 . Another prominent Tiflis Bolshevik , Stepan Shahumyan , moved to Baku . The Bolsheviks ' popularity in Tiflis continued to fall , and by 1911 , there were only about 100 Bolsheviks left in the city . 
 The robbery also made the Bolshevik Centre unpopular more widely among European social democrat groups . Lenin 's desire to distance himself from the legacy of the robbery may have been one of the sources of the rift between him and Bogdanov and Krasin . Stalin distanced himself from Kamo 's gang and never publicized his role in the robbery . 
 = = = Later careers = = = 
 After the Russian Revolution of 1917 , many of the Bolsheviks who had been involved in the robbery gained political power in the new Soviet Union . Lenin went on to become its first premier until his death in 1924 , followed by Stalin until his death in 1953 . Maxim Litvinov became a Soviet diplomat , serving as People 's Commissar for Foreign Affairs ( 1930 – 1939 ) . Leonid Krasin initially quit politics after the split from Lenin in 1909 , but rejoined the Bolsheviks after the 1917 Revolution and served as the Soviet trade representative in London and as People 's Commissar for Foreign Trade until his death in 1926 . 
 After Kamo 's release from prison , he worked in the Soviet customs office , by some accounts because he was too unstable to work for the secret police . He died in 1922 when a truck hit him while he was cycling . Although there is no proof of foul play , some have theorized that Stalin ordered his death to keep him quiet . 
 Bogdanov was expelled from the party in 1909 , ostensibly over philosophical differences . After the Bolshevik Revolution , he became the leading ideologist of <unk> , an organization designed to foster a new proletarian culture . 
 = = = Monument = = = 
 Yerevan Square , where the robbery took place , was renamed Lenin Square by the Soviet authorities in 1921 , and a large statue of Lenin was erected in his honor in 1956 . Despite being convicted of the bloody robbery , Kamo was originally buried and had a monument erected in his honor in Pushkin Gardens , near Yerevan Square . Created by the sculptor <unk> <unk> , it was removed during Stalin 's rule , and Kamo 's remains were moved to another location . The statue of Lenin was torn down in August 1991 — one of the final moments of the Soviet Union — and replaced by the Liberty Monument in 2006 . The name of the square was changed from Lenin Square to Freedom Square in 1991 . 
 = Park Crescent , Brighton = 
 Park Crescent is a mid @-@ 19th @-@ century residential development in the Round Hill area of Brighton , part of the English city of Brighton and Hove . The horseshoe @-@ shaped , three @-@ part terrace of 48 houses was designed and built by one of Brighton 's most important architects , Amon Henry Wilds ; by the time work started in 1849 he had 35 years ' experience in the town . Wilds used the Italianate style rather than his ( and Brighton 's ) more common Regency motifs . Three houses were replaced after the Second World War because of bomb damage , and another was the scene of one of Brighton 's notorious " trunk murders " of the 1930s . The three parts of the terrace , which encircle a private garden formerly a pleasure ground and cricket pitch , have been listed at Grade II * by English Heritage for their architectural and historical importance . 
 = = History = = 
 The fishing village of Brighthelmston , on the English Channel coast , was built around the point at which the Wellesbourne , a <unk> flowing off the South Downs , entered the sea . It formed a north – south valley along which the road and railway line to London were built . The road to London diverged from the road to Lewes , which also followed a valley northeastwards , at an area of marshy , intermittently flooded ground called The Level . By the 18th century , when the village started developing into the fashionable resort of Brighton , this had become a popular site for fairs , sports and general recreation . In 1791 , the northernmost part became the Prince of Wales Ground , a cricket ground which hosted early first @-@ class matches and served as the home of Brighton Cricket Club , one of the principal founders of Sussex County Cricket Club 50 years later . 
 Major changes happened in 1822 after the Prince Regent — the most enthusiastic player and supporter of cricket among Brighton 's high society — became king and retired from the sport . The Prince of Wales Ground fell into disuse at this time . Meanwhile , The Level was granted to the town by its landowners , who included influential local clergyman , politician , property speculator and Lord of the Manor Thomas Read Kemp . Union Road was built from east to west connecting the London and Lewes Roads , and the 8 @-@ acre ( 3 @.@ 2 ha ) area to its south was landscaped by Amon Henry Wilds and landscape gardener Henry Phillips . The 10 @-@ acre ( 4 @.@ 0 ha ) part to the north was bought by a speculator , James Ireland , who built the Royal Gardens — a multi @-@ purpose pleasure garden with a new cricket ground ( the Royal New Ground ) . The gardens opened on 1 May 1823 . 
 Cricket remained the most popular attraction throughout the gardens ' existence , but there was a range of activities : bowling greens , a " noble and conspicuous building " with ground @-@ floor billiard rooms , refreshment facilities and reading rooms and a walking area on the roof , lawns , a grotto , an aviary , fairground activities , and an artificial lake with a path leading to a maze whose centrepiece was a special swinging chair . A bizarre flying demonstration took place on one occasion , during which a businessman and associate of Ireland claimed he would fly from the roof of the main building to the far side of the gardens . When he merely sailed down a rope wearing a pair of wings and attached to a pulley , the spectators were so unimpressed that he had to escape into the maze to get away from them . The gardens soon began to decline in popularity , and Ireland sold them in 1826 . Under later owners ' oversight , they became overgrown , and the main building soon became unusable . Only the ornamental gate piers and the south boundary wall ( on the north side of Union Road ) remain . 
 The gardens and the land surrounding then came up for sale again in the late 1840s . After the opening of the railway line and Brighton railway station nearby in 1841 , the surrounding area developed as a largely working @-@ class area of small terraced houses . In about 1849 Amon Henry Wilds attempted to introduce some higher @-@ class housing with his Park Crescent development . It was envisaged as a long , horseshoe @-@ shaped crescent facing inwards towards the former cricket ground part of the Royal Gardens , which would be a private garden for residents . Work started on the 48 @-@ house development , described as Wilds 's " most ambitious scheme " , in 1849 . 
 The crescent was complete in 1854 , one of Wilds 's final works before his death in 1857 . At first the gardens were managed by a private agent on behalf of the residents , but a committee of residents took over <unk> in 1872 . The 19th @-@ century German philosopher Arnold Ruge lived at number 7 and was chairman of the Park Crescent Residents ' Association . Lewis Carroll 's sister Henrietta moved to number 4 Park Crescent in 1885 and lived a hermit @-@ like existence with several cats for company . She died in 1922 . In 1934 , number 44 was the site of the second notorious " Brighton trunk murder " in the space of a few weeks . On 15 July that year , the body of Violet Kaye , a prostitute , was found in a suitcase in a house in Kemp Street in the North Laine area . Her pimp , Tony Mancini , alleged that he found her dead in bed in the Park Crescent house and transported her to lodgings in Kemp Street out of fear . Remarkable work by defence counsel Norman Birkett <unk> acquitted Mancini , but he confessed to the murder in 1976 . 
 Wartime damage to Brighton 's grand squares , terraces and crescents was minimal , and much less than expected ; nevertheless , three houses ( numbers 24 , 25 and 26 ) in the centre of the northern part of the crescent were destroyed by a bomb in 1942 . They were not replaced until 1983 , when the three houses were rebuilt as two , omitting number 25 . The replacements were built in the same style as the rest of the terrace . 
 The west , north and east sides of the crescent were each listed separately at Grade II * on 13 October 1952 . Such buildings are defined as being " particularly important ... [ and ] of more than special interest " . As of February 2001 , they were three of the 70 Grade II * -listed buildings and structures , and 1 @,@ 218 listed buildings of all grades , in the city of Brighton and Hove . 
 = = Associated buildings = = 
 Park Crescent Terrace was built adjacent to the crescent on its west side . Numbers 1 to 16 Park Crescent back on to the terrace . At its south end , a Salvation Army Congress Hall was built in 2000 by David Greenwood of the Salvation Army Architects Department . The new octagonal building , whose gables resemble those on Park Crescent 's houses , replaced a 1 @,@ 400 @-@ capacity predecessor of 1883 on the same site . Another important local building , demolished in 1930 , was the Gaiety Theatre on Park Crescent Place , which runs northwards from Park Crescent to Trinity Street . It was the Royal Hippodrome from 1876 until 1889 , and held a popular circus . After a short closure , it reopened in 1890 as a theatre specialising in melodrama and music hall performances . It was demolished in 1930 and replaced by flats . 
 The wall along the north side of Union Road , which cuts off Park Crescent and the gardens from The Level , retains its original ( 1822 ) gate piers . It was badly damaged by falling trees in the Great Storm of 1987 , but has been repaired . The original stone lions on top of the gate piers have been removed and replaced with copies . The piers themselves are stuccoed , and consist of a square plinth with <unk> , a square body with arched niches , a prominent gutta above a triglyph , and a cornice with stone lions on top . The gate piers were listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 24 July 1969 ; this defines them as " nationally important [ and ] of special interest " . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Wilds adopted the then @-@ popular Italianate style for his design of Park Crescent , which has been described as the most ambitious development of his architectural career . It has been criticised for being an unsuccessful composition , " showing ... his limitations as an architect " with the " muddled and disappointing " proportions of the interior ( garden @-@ facing ) façades . The gabled roofs on each house are large in proportion to the rest of the exterior , giving a " top @-@ heavy " , " busy and awkward " appearance . This contrasts with the simple curves of the rear elevations , facing the streets on the outside . The gables form part of an attic storey which extends from the top of the two- and three @-@ storey houses in the terrace . They are treated as 24 semi @-@ detached villas at the front , but the rear resembles a plain terrace on all three sides . The linking element between the pairs of villas is a series of three @-@ storey towers topped with pediments . These also provide a unifying element between houses of different heights , which has been described as a mark of Wilds 's ingenuity . 
 The west and east sides match each other . Most houses have two storeys , but some rise to three ; all have a basement and a three @-@ window range with sash windows . The entrances are in the rear elevation and are paired under single doorcases with cornices , architraves and fanlights . The windows are topped by similar architraves . At the front , facing the garden , the hipped roofs of the main sections have prominent eaves , and the roofs of the tower sections have similar treatment . Number 1 , at the southwest corner , has ground @-@ floor rustication carried round on to its south @-@ facing wall , and its windows are different . Similarly , number 48 — the end house at the southeast corner — has a hipped @-@ roofed south @-@ facing wing with a hipped roof , in which the entrance is set in a doorcase flanked by antae . The corner of the house is chamfered and has a blank two @-@ window range . Several houses in the east side of the crescent have dormer windows in their attic space . 
 The curved north side of the " horseshoe " consists of three @-@ storey houses with three @-@ window ranges . The entrances are again paired , and the windows are sashes with architraves above . Three @-@ storey tower bays separate the houses .
