 The Frighteners is a 1996 New Zealand @-@ American horror comedy film directed by Peter Jackson and co @-@ written with his wife , Fran Walsh . The film stars Michael J. Fox , Trini Alvarado , Peter Dobson , John Astin , Dee Wallace Stone , Jeffrey Combs , and Jake Busey . The Frighteners tells the story of Frank Bannister ( Fox ) , an architect who develops psychic abilities allowing him to see , hear , and communicate with ghosts after his wife 's murder . He initially uses his new abilities to befriend ghosts , whom he sends to haunt people so that he can charge them handsome fees for " exorcising " the ghosts . However , the spirit of a mass murderer appears able to attack the living and the dead , posing as the ghost of the Grim Reaper , prompting Frank to investigate the supernatural presence . 
 Jackson and Walsh conceived the idea for The Frighteners during the script @-@ writing phase of Heavenly Creatures . Executive producer Robert Zemeckis hired the duo to write the script , with the original intention of Zemeckis directing The Frighteners as a spin @-@ off film of the television series , Tales from the Crypt . With Jackson and Walsh 's first draft submitted in January 1994 , Zemeckis believed the film would be better off directed by Jackson , produced by Zemeckis and funded / distributed by Universal Studios . The visual effects were created by Jackson 's Weta Digital , which had only been in existence for three years . This , plus the fact that The Frighteners required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made until that time , resulted in the eighteen @-@ month period for effects work by Weta Digital being largely stressed . 
 Despite a rushed post @-@ production schedule , Universal was so impressed with Jackson 's rough cut on The Frighteners , the studio moved the theatrical release date closer by four months . The film was not a box office success , but received generally positive reviews from critics . Despite its lackluster performance at the box office , the film has gained a cult following in more recent years . 
 The Frighteners is also Fox 's last leading role in a live @-@ action feature film ; Fox then went on to a four @-@ year run on the television series Spin City before semi @-@ retiring in 2000 due to the effects of Parkinson 's disease . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In 1990 , architect Frank Bannister 's ( Michael J. Fox ) wife , Debra , dies in a car accident . He abandons his profession , and his unfinished " dream house " sits incomplete . Following the accident , Frank gained the power to see ghosts and befriends three : 1970s street gangster Cyrus ( Chi McBride ) , 1950s nerd Stuart ( Jim Fyfe ) , and The Judge ( John Astin ) , a gunslinger from the Old West . The ghosts haunt houses so Frank can then " exorcise " them for a fee . Most locals consider him a con man . 
 Soon after Frank cons local health nut Ray Lynskey ( Peter Dobson ) and his wife Lucy ( Trini Alvarado ) , a physician , Ray dies of a heart attack . Frank discovers there is an entity , appearing as the Grim Reaper , killing people , first marking numbers on their foreheads that only Frank sees . Frank 's late wife Debra had a similar number when she was found . 
 Frank 's ability to foretell the murders puts him under suspicion with the police and FBI agent Milton Dammers ( Jeffrey Combs ) , who is convinced Frank is responsible . Frank is arrested for killing newspaper editor Magda Rees @-@ Jones ( Elizabeth Hawthorne ) , who had attacked him in the press . 
 Lucy investigates the murders and becomes a target of the Grim Reaper . She is attacked while visiting Frank in jail ; but they escape with the help of Cyrus and Stuart , who are both dissolved in the process . Frank wants to commit suicide to stop the Grim Reaper . Lucy helps Frank have a near @-@ death experience by putting him into hypothermia and using barbiturates to stop his heart . Dammers abducts Lucy , revealing that he had been a victim of Charles Manson and his " Family " in 1969 . 
 In his ghostly form , Frank confronts the Grim Reaper and discovers that he is the ghost of Johnny Bartlett ( Jake Busey ) , a psychiatric hospital orderly who killed twelve people 32 years earlier , before being captured , convicted , and executed . Newspaper reports reveal that his greatest desire was to become the most prolific serial killer ever , showing pride at killing more than contemporaries like Charles Starkweather . Patricia Bradley ( Dee Wallace @-@ Stone ) , then a teenager , was accused as his accomplice , although she escaped the death penalty due to her underage status . Lucy resuscitates Frank and they visit Patricia . Unknown to them , Patricia is still in love with Bartlett and on friendly , homicidal terms with Bartlett 's ghost , and eventually kills her own mother , who had been trying to monitor her daughter 's behavior . Lucy and Frank trap Bartlett 's spirit in his urn , which Patricia has kept . The pair make for the chapel of the now @-@ abandoned psychiatric hospital hoping to send Bartlett 's ghost to Hell . 
 Patricia and Dammers chase them through the ruins . Dammers throws the ashes away , releasing Bartlett 's ghost again before Patricia kills him . Bartlett 's ghost and Patricia hunt down Frank and Lucy . Frank realizes that Bartlett 's ghost , with Patricia 's help , was responsible for his wife 's death and the number on her brow , and that he is still trying to add to his body count ( and infamy ) even after his death . 
 Out of bullets , Patricia strangles Frank to death , but Frank in spirit form rips Patricia 's spirit from her body , forcing Bartlett to follow them . Bartlett grabs Patricia 's ghost , while Frank makes it to Heaven , where he is reunited with Cyrus and Stuart along with his wife Debra . Bartlett and Patricia 's spirits claim they will now go back to claim more lives , but the portal to Heaven quickly changes to a demonic looking appearance , and they are both dragged to Hell by a giant worm @-@ like creature . Frank learns it is not yet his time and is sent back to his body , as Debra 's spirit tells him to " be happy . " 
 Frank and Lucy fall in love . Lucy is now able to see ghosts as well . Frank later begins demolishing the unfinished dream house and building a life with Lucy while the morose @-@ looking ghost of Dammers is riding around in the sheriff 's car . Frank and Lucy then enjoy their picnic . 
 = = Cast = = 
 Michael J. Fox as Frank Bannister : Although Jackson and Walsh envisioned The Frighteners as a low @-@ budget film with unknown actors , Zemeckis suggested casting his Back to the Future star Fox in the lead role . Fox became enthusiastic about working with Jackson when he saw Heavenly Creatures at the Toronto International Film Festival . 
 Trini Alvarado as Dr. Lucy Lynskey : The character is named after Heavenly Creatures star Melanie Lynskey ( who also cameos in The Frighteners ) .

 = = Development = = 
 Peter Jackson and wife / co @-@ writer Fran Walsh conceived the idea for The Frighteners in 1992 , during the script @-@ writing phase of Heavenly Creatures . Together , they wrote a three @-@ page film treatment and sent it to their talent agent in Hollywood . Robert Zemeckis viewed their treatment with the intention of directing The Frighteners as a spin @-@ off film of the television series , Tales from the Crypt ( which he helped produce ) . Zemeckis hired Jackson and Walsh to turn their treatment into a full @-@ length screenplay in January 1993 . The husband and wife duo completed their first draft for The Frighteners in early @-@ January 1994 . Zemeckis was so impressed with their script , he decided The Frighteners would work better directed by Jackson , executive produced by Zemeckis and funded / distributed by Universal Pictures . Universal greenlighted the film to commence pre @-@ production on a $ 26 million budget in April 1994 . The studio also granted Jackson and Zemeckis total artistic control and the right of final cut privilege . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 Jackson decided to film The Frighteners entirely in New Zealand . Zemeckis and Universal agreed on the condition that Jackson made New Zealand look similar to the Midwestern United States . Principal photography began on May 14 , 1995 and lasted until November 16 , which is one of the longest shooting schedules ever approved by Universal Pictures . Six weeks into the shoot , cinematographer Alun Bollinger had a serious car accident . His replacement , John Blick , later alternated duties with Bollinger for much of the rest of the shoot . Location shooting primarily included Wellington and three weeks spent in Lyttelton . Interior scenes were compiled at Camperdown Studios in Miramar . 
 = = = Visual effects = = = 
 Jackson 's Weta Digital created the visual effects , which included computer @-@ generated imagery , as well as scale models ( which were necessary to make Wellington look American ) , prosthetic makeup and practical effects with help from Weta Workshop . Visual effects supervisor Richard Taylor explained that effects work on The Frighteners was complex due to Weta 's inexperience with computer technology in the mid @-@ 1990s . Prior to this film , Weta worked largely with physical effects . With so many ghosts among its main cast , The Frighteners required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made up till that time . For a special effects company that had been in existence less than three years , the eighteen @-@ month period for completing The Frighteners was largely stressful . Some shots were handled by a small New Zealand company called Pixel Perfect , many of whose employees would eventually join Weta Digital . Rick Baker was hired to design the prosthetic makeup for The Judge , portrayed by John Astin ( the detachable jawbone was later added digitally ) . However , Baker was not able to apply Astin 's five hours of makeup himself due to his commitment on The Nutty Professor . Makeup artist Brian <unk> ( Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy , Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull ) fulfilled Baker 's duties . 
 The extended shooting schedule owed much to the fact that scenes where ghosts and human characters interacted had to be filmed twice ; once with human characters acting on set , and then with the ghost characters acting against a blue screen . The two elements would later be digitally composited into one shot with the use of split screen photography . Such sequences required precise timing from the cast as they traded dialogue with characters who were merely blank air . The hardest challenge for the digital animators at Weta was creating the Grim Reaper , which went through many transformations before finding physical form . " We set out with the intention of doing the Reaper as a rod puppet , maybe shooting it in a water tank , " Jackson commented . " We even thought of filming someone , dressed in costume , at different camera speeds . " Test footage was shot with puppets and a man in a Reaper suit , but in the end , it was decided that using computer animation would be the easiest task . Another entirely computerized character called " the Gatekeeper " , a winged cherub who helps guard the cemetery , was deleted from the final cut . 
 With digital effects work running behind schedule , Zemeckis convinced Wes Takahashi , an animation supervisor from visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic , to help work on The Frighteners . " The shots Zemeckis showed me were pretty remarkable , " Takahashi reflected , " but there were still about 400 shots to do , and everyone was kind of worried . " Takahashi was quickly drafted as a visual effects supervisor , and began looking at the schedule , trying to work out whether The Frighteners could be finished in time . " There was no way we 'd make the deadline . I figured out a concerted plan involving Jackson and Zemeckis to convince Universal it was worthy of asking for more money . " The executives at Universal proposed splitting some of the shots to visual effects companies in the United States , but Jackson , for whom the film was a chance to show New Zealand filmmaking could stand alongside Hollywood , convinced Universal otherwise . Instead , The Frighteners received an accelerated release date , four months earlier than planned , and an additional $ 6 million in financing , with fifteen digital animators and computer workstations ( some were borrowed from Universal and other effects companies in the US ) . Andrew Adamson was hired as a digital effects supervisor .

 The film score was written and composed by Danny Elfman . It was released in 1996 on cassette and compact disc by Universal Records . The closing credits play a cover of Blue Öyster Cult 's " ( Don 't Fear ) The Reaper " performed by New Zealand alternative rock band The Mutton Birds . The Mutton Birds version of the song had been previously released as a B @-@ side to their single " She 's Been Talking " released in 1996 . It plays also " Superstar " , written by Bonnie Bramlett + Leon Russell and performed by Sonic Youth 
 Critical reception was average ; Jason Ankeny of album database Allmusic described the soundtrack as " imaginative " giving it three stars out of five . This was a lower rating on the site than Elfman 's other scores of the era , such as Mission : Impossible , Mars Attacks ! and <unk> . The soundtrack review website Filmtracks referred to the album as " lacking much cohesion or singular creativity " . 
 = = Release = = 
 The original release date was October 31 , 1996 , but after Universal studio executives viewed a rough cut of The Frighteners , they were impressed enough to move the release date to their " summer blockbuster slot " on July 19 , 1996 . In addition , Universal offered the filmmaker the opportunity to make King Kong , which was not released until 2005 . Jackson often disputed over the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) over the film 's rating . Aware that he was meant to be delivering Universal a PG @-@ 13 rating , Jackson tried his best to omit the amount of graphic violence as much as possible , but the MPAA still believed The Frighteners deserved an R rating .

 The Frighteners was released in the United States in 1 @,@ 675 theaters , and opened at # 5 , earning $ 5 @,@ 565 @,@ 495 during its opening weekend , averaging $ 3 @,@ 335 per theater . The film eventually grossed a worldwide total of $ 29 @,@ 359 @,@ 216 . The Frighteners ended up being a box office disappointment , mostly due to competition from Independence Day ; in interviews conducted years after The Frighteners ' release , Jackson commented he was disappointed by Universal 's ubiquitous marketing campaign , including a poster which " didn 't tell you anything about the picture " , which he believed was the primary reason the film was not a financial success . Additionally , the film opened on the same day the Atlanta Summer Olympics began ; when Jackson realized this and told the studio , they answered " ' We don 't think so ; our research indicates that 's not the case ... ' And I just thought how the hell do they know ? There had only ever been three Olympic Games held in the United States in one hundred years ! " Jackson acknowledged The Frighteners ' tone made it hard to pigeon @-@ hole and sell , and his experience on the film made him understand the importance of marketing . 
 = = = Critical reception = = = 
 The Frighteners received generally positive reviews from film critics . As of June 2014 , 64 % of the 36 reviewers selected by review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a positive review , certifying it " Fresh " with an average score of 6 @.@ 2 / 10 ; the consensus states : " Boasting top @-@ notch special effects and exuberant direction from Peter Jackson , The Frighteners is visually striking but tonally uneven . " 
 Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times stated " Director Peter Jackson , at home with all kinds of excess in New Zealand , keeps everything spinning nicely , not even losing a step when the mood turns increasingly disturbing . " Janet Maslin from The New York Times enjoyed The Frighteners , but " walked out the theater with mixed emotions , " she commented that " Peter Jackson deserves more enthusiasm for expert , imaginative effects than for his live actors anyhow . These lively touches would leave The Frighteners looking more like a more frantic Beetlejuice if Jackson 's film weren 't so <unk> overcrowded . The Frighteners is not immune to overkill , even though most of its characters are already dead . " Jeff Vice of the Deseret News praised the acting in the film , with the performances of Fox and Alvarado in particular , but said that there were also " bits that push the taste barrier too far and which grind things to a screeching halt " , and that if " Jackson had used the restraint he showed in Heavenly Creatures , the movie could have " been the best of its kind " . Critic Christopher Null praised the film , as he described it as a mixture between Ghostbusters and Twin Peaks . Michael Drucker of IGN said that although the film wouldn 't make Jackson 's top five of movies , it " is a harmless and fun dark comedy that you 'll enjoy casually watching from time to time " . The Frighteners received mixed reviews from critics from Jackson 's native country , New Zealand . 
 Conversely , Todd McCarthy of Variety thought that the film should have remained an episode of Tales from the Crypt . Critic James Berardinelli believed that although The Frighteners wasn 't " a bad film " , it was " a disappointment , following Jackson 's powerful , true @-@ life matricide tale , Heavenly Creatures " , and because of that " The Frighteners fell short of expectations by being just one of many in the long line of 1996 summer movies . " Chicago Sun @-@ Times ' Roger Ebert , felt that Jackson was more interested in prosthetic makeup designs , computer animation , and special effects than writing a cohesive storyline . Ebert and critic Gene Siskel gave it a " two thumbs down " rating on their TV show At the Movies with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert . Chicago Reader critic Jonathan Rosenbaum , described the film 's special effects as " ugly , aggressive " and " proliferating " , saying that " trying to keep interested in [ the special effects ] was like trying to remain interested in a loudmouth shouting in [ his ] ear " . Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle stated that " instead of moving the horror genre in new directions , The Frighteners simply falls apart from its barrage of visual effects and the <unk> onslaught of Danny Elfman 's music score " . The Austin Chronicle 's Joey O 'Brien , said that although the screenplay was " practically loaded with wild ideas , knowingly campy dialogue and offbeat characterizations " , it " switched gears " too fast and too frequently that " the audience is left struggling to catch up as [ The Frighteners ] twists and turns its way unmercifully towards a literally out @-@ of @-@ this @-@ world finale " . 
 At the 23rd Saturn Awards , the Academy of Science Fiction , Fantasy & Horror Films honored Jackson with nominations for Best Direction and Best Writing , the latter he shared with wife Fran Walsh . The Frighteners also was nominated the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film , and for its Special Effects , Make @-@ up ( Rick Baker ) and Music ( Danny Elfman ) . Michael J. Fox and Jeffrey Combs were also nominated for their work .

 The Frighteners was first released on DVD in August 1998 , but included no special features . 
 To coincide with the release of Jackson 's King Kong , Universal Studios Home Entertainment issued a double @-@ sided director 's cut DVD of the film in November 2005 , which featured a version of The Frighteners that was 12 minutes longer . The other side includes a documentary prepared by Jackson and <unk> Films originally for the Laserdisc release . The director 's cut was also made available in HD DVD and Blu @-@ ray . 
 = Dragonfly = 
 A dragonfly is an insect belonging to the order Odonata , suborder Anisoptera ( from Greek <unk> <unk> " uneven " and πτερόν pteron , " wing " , because the hindwing is broader than the forewing ) . Adult dragonflies are characterized by large multifaceted eyes , two pairs of strong transparent wings , sometimes with coloured patches and an elongated body . Dragonflies can be mistaken for the related group , damselflies ( Zygoptera ) , which are similar in structure , though usually lighter in build ; however , the wings of most dragonflies are held flat and away from the body , while damselflies hold the wings folded at rest , along or above the abdomen . Dragonflies are agile fliers , while damselflies have a weaker , fluttery flight . Many dragonflies have brilliant iridescent or metallic colours produced by structural coloration , making them conspicuous in flight . An adult dragonfly eye has nearly 24 @,@ 000 ommatidia . 
 Fossils of very large dragonfly ancestors in the <unk> are found from 325 million years ago ( Mya ) in Upper Carboniferous rocks ; these had wingspans up to about 750 mm ( 30 in ) . About 3000 species of Anisoptera are in the world today . Most are tropical , with fewer species in temperate regions . 
 Dragonflies are predators , both in their aquatic larval stage , when they are known as nymphs or naiads , and as adults . Several years of their lives are spent as nymphs living in fresh water ; the adults may be on the wing for just a few days or weeks . They are fast , agile fliers , sometimes migrating across oceans , and are often found near water . They have a uniquely complex mode of reproduction involving indirect insemination , delayed fertilization , and sperm competition . During mating , the male grasps the female at the back of the head or on the prothorax , and the female curls her abdomen under her body to pick up sperm from the male 's secondary genitalia at the front of his abdomen , forming the " heart " or " wheel " posture . 
 Loss of wetland habitat threatens dragonfly populations around the world . Dragonflies are represented in human culture on artifacts such as pottery , rock paintings , and Art Nouveau jewellery . They are used in traditional medicine in Japan and China , and caught for food in Indonesia . They are symbols of courage , strength , and happiness in Japan , but seen as sinister in European folklore . Their bright colours and agile flight are admired in the poetry of Alfred , Lord Tennyson and the prose of H. E. Bates . 
 = = Phylogeny = = 
 Dragonflies and their relatives are an ancient group . The oldest fossils are of the <unk> from the 325 Mya Upper Carboniferous of Europe , a group that included the largest insect that ever lived , <unk> <unk> from the early Permian , with a wingspan around 750 mm ( 30 in ) ; their fossil record ends with the Permian – Triassic extinction event ( about 247 Mya ) . The <unk> , another ancestral group which lacks certain wing vein characters found in modern Odonata , lived from the Early to Late Permian age until the end Permian event , and are known from fossil wings from current day United States , Russia , and Australia , suggesting they might have been cosmopolitan in distribution . The forerunners of modern Odonata are included in a clade called the <unk> , which include the basal Zygoptera ( damselflies ) and the Anisoptera ( true dragonflies ) Today there are some 3000 species extant around the world . 
 The relationships of <unk> families are not fully resolved as of 2013 , but all the families are monophyletic except the Corduliidae ; the Gomphidae are a sister taxon to all other Anisoptera , the <unk> are a sister to the <unk> , and the <unk> are a sister to a clade that includes the <unk> and Libellulidae . On the cladogram , dashed lines indicate unresolved relationships ; English names are given ( in parentheses ) : 
 = = Distribution and diversity = = 
 About 3012 species of dragonflies were known in 2010 ; these are classified into 348 genera in 11 families . The distribution of diversity within the biogeographical regions are summarised below ( the world numbers are not ordinary totals , as overlaps in species occur ) . 
 Dragonflies are found on every continent except Antarctica . In contrast to the damselflies ( Zygoptera ) , which tend to have restricted distributions , some genera and species are found across continents . For example , the blue @-@ eyed darner <unk> multicolor is found all across North America , and in Central America ; emperors Anax are found throughout the Americas from as far north as Newfoundland to as far south as Bahia Blanca in Argentina , across Europe to central Asia , North Africa , and the Middle East . The globe skimmer Pantala flavescens is probably the most widespread dragonfly species in the world ; it is cosmopolitan , occurring on all continents in the warmer regions . Most Anisoptera species are tropical , with far fewer species in temperate regions . 
 Dragonflies including <unk> and aeshnids are found in desert pools , for example in the Mojave Desert , where they are active in shade temperatures between 18 and 45 ° C ( 64 @.@ 4 to 113 ° F ) ; these insects were able to survive body temperatures above the thermal death point of insects of the same species found in cooler places . 
 Dragonflies can be found from sea level up to the mountains , decreasing in species diversity with altitude . Their altitudinal limit is about 3700 m , represented by a species of Aeshna in the Pamirs . 
 Dragonflies become scarce at higher latitudes . They are not native to Iceland , but individuals are occasionally swept in by strong winds , including a <unk> <unk> native to North Africa , and an unidentified darter species . In Kamchatka , only a few species of dragonfly including the treeline emerald <unk> arctica and some aeshnids such as Aeshna <unk> are found , possibly because of the low temperature of the lakes there . The treeline emerald is also found in northern Alaska , within the Arctic Circle , making it the most northerly of all dragonflies . 
 = = General description = = 
 Dragonflies ( suborder Anisoptera ) are heavy @-@ bodied , strong @-@ flying insects that hold their wings horizontally both in flight and at rest . By contrast , damselflies ( suborder Zygoptera ) have slender bodies and fly more weakly ; most species fold their wings over the abdomen when stationary , and the eyes are well separated on the sides of the head . 
 An adult dragonfly has three distinct segments , the head , thorax , and abdomen as in all insects . It has a chitinous exoskeleton of hard plates held together with flexible membranes . The head is large with very short antennae . It is dominated by the two compound eyes , which cover most of its surface . The compound eyes are made up of ommatidia , the numbers being greater in the larger species . Aeshna <unk> has <unk> ommatidia of two varying sizes , 4500 being large . The facets facing downward tend to be smaller . <unk> gigantea has <unk> ommatidia of just one size . These facets provide complete vision in the frontal hemisphere of the dragonfly . The compound eyes meet at the top of the head ( except in the Gomphidae , as also in the genus <unk> ) . Also , they have three simple eyes or ocelli . The mouthparts are adapted for biting with a toothed jaw ; the flap @-@ like labrum , at the front of the mouth , can be shot rapidly forward to catch prey . The head has a system for locking it in place that consists of muscles and small hairs on the back of the head that grip structures on the front of the first thoracic segment . This arrester system is unique to the Odonata and is activated when feeding and during tandem flight . 
 The thorax consists of three segments as in all insects . The prothorax is small and is flattened dorsally into a shield @-@ like disc which has two transverse ridges . The mesothorax and metathorax are fused into a rigid , box @-@ like structure with internal bracing , and provides a robust attachment for the powerful wing muscles inside it . The thorax bears two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs . The wings are long , veined , and membranous , narrower at the tip and wider at the base . The hindwings are broader than the forewings and the venation is different at the base . The veins carry haemolymph which is pumped in at the time of emergence from the nymphal stage to expand the wings . The leading edge of each wing has a node where other veins join the marginal vein , and the wing is able to flex at this point . In most large species of dragonflies , the wings of females are shorter and broader than those of males . The legs are not used for walking , but are used to catch and hold prey , for perching , and for climbing on plants . Each has two short basal joints , two long joints , and a three @-@ jointed foot , armed with a pair of claws . The long leg joints bear rows of spines , and in males , one row of spines on each front leg is modified to form an " <unk> " , for cleaning the surface of the compound eye . 
 The abdomen is long and slender and consists of 10 segments and a terminal appendage @-@ bearing segment . The second and third segments are enlarged , and in males , a cleft on the underside of the second segment contains a pair of claspers and the penis . The <unk> open on the 9th segment . In females , the genital opening is on the underside of the eighth segment and is covered by a simple flap or an ovipositor , depending on species and the method of egg @-@ laying . 
 Dragonfly nymphs vary in form with species and are loosely classed into claspers , <unk> , <unk> , and burrowers . The first instar is known as a <unk> , a relatively inactive stage from which it quickly moults into the more active nymphal form . The general body plan is similar to that of an adult , but the nymph lacks wings and reproductive organs . The lower jaw has a huge , extensible labium , armed with hooks and spines , which is used for catching prey . This labium is folded under the body at rest and struck out at great speed by hydraulic pressure created by the abdominal muscles . Whereas damselfly nymphs have three feathery external gills , dragonfly nymphs have internal gills , located around the fourth and fifth abdominal segments . Water is pumped in and out of the abdomen through an opening at the tip . The naiads of some clubtails ( Gomphidae ) that burrow into the sediment , have a snorkel @-@ like tube at the end of the abdomen enabling them to draw in clean water while they are buried in mud . Naiads can forcefully expel a jet of water to propel themselves with great rapidity . 
 = = = Coloration = = = 
 Many adult dragonflies have brilliant iridescent or metallic colours produced by structural coloration , making them conspicuous in flight . Their overall coloration is often a combination of yellow , red , brown , and black pigments , with structural colours . Blues are typically created by microstructures in the cuticle that reflect blue light . Greens often combine a structural blue with a yellow pigment . Freshly emerged adults , known as <unk> , are often pale @-@ coloured and obtain their typical colours after a few days , some have their bodies covered with a pale blue , waxy <unk> called <unk> ; it wears off when scraped during mating , leaving darker areas . 
 Some dragonflies , such as the green darner , Anax <unk> , have a <unk> blue which is produced structurally by scatter from arrays of tiny spheres in the endoplasmic reticulum of epidermal cells underneath the cuticle . 
 The wings of dragonflies are generally clear , apart from the dark veins and <unk> . In the chasers ( Libellulidae ) , however , many genera have areas of colour on the wings : for example , groundlings ( <unk> ) have brown bands on all four wings , while some scarlets ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( <unk> ) have bright orange patches at the wing bases . Some aeshnids such as the brown hawker ( Aeshna grandis ) have translucent , pale yellow wings . 
 Dragonfly nymphs are usually a well @-@ camouflaged blend of dull brown , green , and grey .

 = = = Ecology = = = 
 Dragonflies and damselflies are predatory both in the aquatic nymphal and adult stages . Nymphs feed on a range of freshwater invertebrates and larger ones can prey on tadpoles and small fish . Adults capture insect prey in the air , making use of their acute vision and highly controlled flight . The mating system of dragonflies is complex and they are among the few insect groups that have a system of indirect sperm transfer along with sperm storage , delayed fertilization , and sperm competition . 
 Adult males vigorously defend territories near water ; these areas provide suitable habitat for the larvae to develop , and for females to lay their eggs . Swarms of feeding adults aggregate to prey on swarming prey such as emerging flying ants or termites . 
 Dragonflies as a group occupy a considerable variety of habitats , but many species , and some families , have their own specific environmental requirements . Some species prefer flowing waters , while others prefer standing water . For example , the Gomphidae ( clubtails ) live in running water , and the Libellulidae ( skimmers ) live in still water . Some species are found in temporary water pools and are capable of tolerating changes in water level , desiccation , and the resulting variations in temperature , but some genera such as Sympetrum ( darters ) have eggs and larvae that can resist drought and are stimulated to grow rapidly in warm , shallow pools , also often benefiting from the absence of predators there . Vegetation and its characteristics including submerged , floating , emergent , or waterside are also important . Adults may require emergent or waterside plants to use as perches ; others may need specific submerged or floating plants on which to lay eggs . Requirements may be highly specific , as in Aeshna viridis ( green hawker ) , which lives in swamps with the water @-@ soldier , <unk> <unk> . The chemistry of the water , including its trophic status ( degree of enrichment with nutrients ) and pH can also affect its use by dragonflies . Most species need moderate conditions , not too eutrophic , not too acid ; a few species such as Sympetrum <unk> ( black darter ) and Libellula <unk> ( four @-@ spotted chaser ) prefer acidic waters such as peat bogs , while others such as Libellula fulva ( scarce chaser ) need slow @-@ moving , eutrophic waters with reeds or similar waterside plants . 
 = = = Behaviour = = = 
 Many dragonflies , particularly males , are territorial . Some defend a territory against others of their own species , some against other species of dragonfly and a few against insects in unrelated groups . A particular perch may give a dragonfly a good view over an insect @-@ rich feeding ground , and the blue <unk> ( <unk> longipennis ) jostles other dragonflies to maintain the right to alight there . 
 Defending a breeding territory is fairly common among male dragonflies , especially among species that congregate around ponds in large numbers . The territory contains desirable features such as a sunlit stretch of shallow water , a special plant species , or a particular substrate necessary for egg @-@ laying . The territory may be small or large , depending on its quality , the time of day , and the number of competitors , and may be held for a few minutes or several hours . Some dragonflies signal ownership with striking colours on the face , abdomen , legs , or wings . The common whitetail ( <unk> <unk> ) dashes towards an intruder holding its white abdomen aloft like a flag . Other dragonflies engage in aerial dogfights or high @-@ speed chases . A female must mate with the territory holder before laying her eggs . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Mating in dragonflies is a complex , precisely choreographed process . First , the male has to attract a female to his territory , continually driving off rival males . When he is ready to mate , he transfers a packet of sperm from his primary genital opening on segment 9 , near the end of his abdomen , to his secondary genitalia on segments 2 – 3 , near the base of his abdomen . The male then grasps the female by the head with the claspers at the end of his abdomen ; the structure of the claspers varies between species , and may help to prevent interspecific mating . The pair flies in tandem with the male in front , typically perching on a twig or plant stem . The female then curls her abdomen downwards and forwards under her body to pick up the sperm from the male 's secondary genitalia , while the male uses his " tail " claspers to grip the female behind the head : this distinctive posture is called the " heart " or " wheel " ; the pair may also be described as being " in cop " . 
 Egg @-@ laying ( ovipositing ) involves not only the female darting over floating or waterside vegetation to deposit eggs on a suitable substrate , but also the male hovering above her or continuing to clasp her and flying in tandem . The male attempts to prevent rivals from removing his sperm and inserting their own , something made possible by delayed fertilisation and driven by sexual selection . If successful , a rival male uses his penis to compress or scrape out the sperm inserted previously ; this activity takes up much of the time that a copulating pair remains in the heart posture . Flying in tandem has the advantage that less effort is needed by the female for flight and more can be expended on egg @-@ laying , and when the female submerges to deposit eggs , the male may help to pull her out of the water . 
 Egg @-@ laying takes two different forms depending on the species . The female in some families has a sharp @-@ edged ovipositor with which she slits open a stem or leaf of a plant on or near the water , so she can push her eggs inside . In other families such as clubtails ( Gomphidae ) , cruisers ( <unk> ) , emeralds ( Corduliidae ) , and skimmers ( Libellulidae ) , the female lays eggs by tapping the surface of the water repeatedly with her abdomen , by shaking the eggs out of her abdomen as she flies along , or by placing the eggs on vegetation . In a few species , the eggs are laid on emergent plants above the water , and development is delayed until these have withered and become immersed . 
 = = = Life cycle = = = 
 Dragonflies are hemimetabolous insects ; they do not have a pupal stage and undergo an incomplete metamorphosis with a series of nymphal stages from which the adult emerges . Eggs laid inside plant tissues are usually shaped like grains of rice , while other eggs are the size of a pinhead , ellipsoidal , or nearly spherical . A clutch may have as many as 1500 eggs , and they take about a week to hatch into aquatic nymphs or naiads which moult between six and 15 times ( depending on species ) as they grow . Most of a dragonfly 's life is spent as a nymph , beneath the water 's surface . The nymph extends its labium ( a toothed mouthpart ) to catch animals such as mosquito larvae , tadpoles , and small fish . They breathe through gills in their rectum , and can rapidly propel themselves by suddenly expelling water through the anus . Some naiads , such as the later stages of <unk> <unk> , hunt on land . 
 The larval stage of dragonflies lasts up to five years in large species , and between two months and three years in smaller species . When the <unk> is ready to metamorphose into an adult , it stops feeding and makes its way to the surface , generally at night . It remains stationary with its head out of the water , while its respiration system adapts to breathing air , then climbs up a reed or other emergent plant , and moults ( ecdysis ) . Anchoring itself firmly in a vertical position with its claws , its skin begins to split at a weak spot behind the head . The adult dragonfly crawls out of its larval skin , the exuvia , arching backwards when all but the tip of its abdomen is free , to allow its exoskeleton to harden . Curling back upwards , it completes its emergence , swallowing air , which <unk> out its body , and pumping haemolymph into its wings , which causes them to expand to their full extent . 
 Dragonflies in temperate areas can be categorized into two groups , an early group and a later one . In any one area , individuals of a particular " spring species " emerge within a few days of each other . The springtime darner ( <unk> <unk> ) , for example , is suddenly very common in the spring , but has disappeared a few weeks later and is not seen again until the following year . By contrast , a " summer species " emerges over a period of weeks or months , later in the year . They may be seen on the wing for several months , but this may represent a whole series of individuals , with new adults hatching out as earlier ones complete their short lifespans . 
 = = = Sex ratios = = = 
 The sex ratio of male to female dragonflies varies both temporally and spatially . Adult dragonflies have a high male @-@ biased ratio at breeding habitats . The male @-@ bias ratio has contributed partially to the females using different habitats to avoid male harassment . As seen in Hine ’ s emerald dragonfly ( <unk> <unk> ) , male populations use wetland habitats , while females use dry meadows and marginal breeding habitats , only migrating to the wetlands to lay their eggs or to find mating partners . Unwanted mating is energetically costly for females because it affects the amount of time that they are able to spend foraging . 
 = = = Flight = = = 
 Dragonflies are powerful and agile fliers , capable of migrating across oceans , moving in any direction , and changing direction suddenly . In flight , the adult dragonfly can propel itself in six directions : upward , downward , forward , back , to left and to right . They have four different styles of flight : A number of flying modes are used that include counter @-@ stroking , with forewings beating 180 ° out of phase with the hindwings , is used for hovering and slow flight . This style is efficient and generates a large amount of lift ; phased @-@ stroking , with the hindwings beating 90 ° ahead of the forewings , is used for fast flight . This style creates more thrust , but less lift than counter @-@ stroking ; synchronised @-@ stroking , with forewings and hindwings beating together , is used when changing direction rapidly , as it maximises thrust ; and gliding , with the wings held out , is used in three situations : free gliding , for a few seconds in between bursts of powered flight ; gliding in the updraft at the crest of a hill , effectively hovering by falling at the same speed as the updraft ; and in certain dragonflies such as darters , when " in cop " with a male , the female sometimes simply glides while the male pulls the pair along by beating his wings . 
 The wings are powered directly , with the flight muscles attached to the wing bases . Dragonflies have a high power / weight ratio , and have been documented accelerating at 4 G linearly and 9 G in sharp turns while pursuing prey . 
 Dragonflies generate lift in at least four ways at different times , including classical lift like an aircraft wing ; supercritical lift with the wing above the critical angle , generating high lift and using very short strokes to avoid stalling ; creating vortices ; and vortex shedding . Some families appear to use special mechanisms , as for example the Libellulidae which take off rapidly , their wings beginning pointed far forward and twisted almost vertically . Dragonfly wings behave highly dynamically during flight , flexing and twisting during each beat . Among the variables are wing curvature , length and speed of stroke , angle of attack , forward / back position of wing , and phase relative to the other wings . 
 = = = = Flight speed = = = = 
 Old and unreliable claims are made that dragonflies such as the southern giant darner can fly up to 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) . However , the greatest reliable flight speed records are for other types of insects . In general , large dragonflies like the hawkers have a maximum speed of 10 – 15 metres per second ( 22 – 34 mph ) with average cruising speed of about 4 @.@ 5 metres per second ( 10 mph ) . Dragonflies can fly at 100 body @-@ lengths per second , and three lengths per second backwards . 
 = = = = Motion camouflage = = = = 
 In high @-@ speed territorial battles between male Australian emperors ( <unk> papuensis ) , the fighting dragonflies adjust their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals , minimizing the chance of being detected as they approach . To achieve the effect , the attacking dragonfly flies towards his rival , choosing his path to remain on a line between the rival and the start of his attack path . The attacker thus looms larger as he closes on the rival , but does not otherwise appear to move . Researchers found that six of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage . 
 = = = Temperature control = = = 
 The flight muscles need to be kept at a suitable temperature for the dragonfly to be able to fly . Being cold @-@ blooded , they can raise their temperature by basking in the sun . Early in the morning , they may choose to perch in a vertical position with the wings outstretched , while in the middle of the day , a horizontal stance may be chosen . Another method of warming up used by some larger dragonflies is wing @-@ whirring , a rapid vibration of the wings that causes heat to be generated in the flight muscles . The green darner ( Anax <unk> ) is known for its long @-@ distance migrations , and often resorts to wing @-@ whirring before dawn to enable it to make an early start . 
 Becoming too hot is another hazard , and a sunny or shady position for perching can be selected according to the ambient temperature . Some species have dark patches on the wings which can provide shade for the body , and a few use the obelisk posture to avoid overheating . This behaviour involves doing a " handstand " , perching with the body raised and the abdomen pointing towards the sun , thus minimising the amount of solar radiation received . On a hot day , dragonflies sometimes adjust their body temperature by skimming over a water surface and briefly touching it , often three times in quick succession . This may also help to avoid desiccation . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Adult dragonflies hunt on the wing using their exceptionally acute eyesight and strong , agile flight . They are almost exclusively carnivorous , eating a wide variety of insects ranging from small midges and mosquitoes to butterflies , moths , damselflies , and smaller dragonflies . A large prey item is subdued by being bitten on the head and is carried by the legs to a perch . Here , the wings are discarded and the prey usually ingested head first . A dragonfly may consume as much as a fifth of its body weight in prey per day . 
 The larvae are voracious predators , eating most living things that are smaller than they are . Their staple diet is mostly <unk> and other insect larvae , but they also feed on tadpoles and small fish . A few species , especially those that live in temporary waters , are likely to leave water . Nymphs of <unk> bidentata sometimes hunt small arthropods on the ground at night . 
 = = Predators and parasites = = 
 Although dragonflies are swift and agile fliers , some predators are fast enough to catch them . These include falcons such as the American kestrel , the merlin , and the hobby ; nighthawks , swifts , flycatchers and swallows also take some adults ; some species of wasps , too , prey on dragonflies , using them to provision their nests , laying an egg on each captured insect . In the water , various species of ducks and herons eat dragonfly larvae and they are also preyed on by newts , frogs , fish , and water spiders . Amur falcons , which migrate over the Indian Ocean at a period that coincides with the migration of the globe skimmer dragonfly , Pantala flavescens , may actually be feeding on them while on the wing . 
 Dragonflies are affected by three major parasites : water mites , gregarine protozoa , and trematode flatworms ( flukes ) . Water mites , <unk> , can kill smaller dragonfly larvae , and may also be seen on adults . <unk> infect the gut and may cause blockage and secondary infection . Trematodes are parasites of vertebrates such as frogs , with complex lifecycles often involving a period as a stage called a <unk> in a secondary host , a snail . Dragonfly nymphs may swallow <unk> , or these may tunnel through a nymph 's body wall ; they then enter the gut and form a cyst or <unk> , which remains in the nymph for the whole of its development . If the nymph is eaten by a frog , the amphibian becomes infected by the adult or fluke stage of the trematode .

 = = = Conservation = = = 
 Most <unk> live in temperate areas and the dragonflies of North America and Europe have been the subject of much research . However , the majority of species live in tropical areas and have been little studied . With the destruction of rainforest habitats , many of these species are in danger of becoming extinct before they have even been named . The greatest cause of decline is forest clearance with the consequent drying up of streams and pools which become clogged with silt . The damming of rivers for hydroelectric schemes and the drainage of low @-@ lying land has reduced suitable habitat , as has pollution and the introduction of alien species . 
 In 1997 , the International Union for Conservation of Nature set up a status survey and conservation action plan for dragonflies . This proposes the establishment of protected areas around the world and the management of these areas to provide suitable habitat for dragonflies . Outside these areas , encouragement should be given to modify forestry , agricultural , and industrial practices to enhance conservation . At the same time , more research into dragonflies needs to be done , consideration should be given to pollution control and the public should be educated about the importance of biodiversity . 
 Habitat degradation has reduced dragonfly populations across the world , for example in Japan . Over 60 % of Japan 's wetlands were lost in the 20th century , so its dragonflies now depend largely on rice fields , ponds , and creeks . Dragonflies feed on pest insects in rice , acting as a natural pest control . Dragonflies are steadily declining in Africa , and represent a conservation priority . 
 The dragonfly 's long lifespan and low population density makes it vulnerable to disturbance , such as from collisions with vehicles on roads built near wetlands . Species that fly low and slow may be most at risk . 
 Dragonflies are attracted to shiny surfaces that produce polarization which they can mistake for water , and they have been known to aggregate close to polished gravestones , solar panels , automobiles , and other such structures on which they attempt to lay eggs . These can have a local impact on dragonfly populations ; methods of reducing the attractiveness of structures such as solar panels are under experimentation . 
 = = = In culture = = = 
 A blue @-@ glazed faience dragonfly amulet was found by Flinders Petrie at Lahun , from the Late Middle Kingdom of ancient Egypt . 
 For some Native American tribes , dragonflies represent swiftness and activity ; for the Navajo , they symbolize pure water . They are a common motif in Zuni pottery ; stylized as a double @-@ barred cross , they appear in Hopi rock art and on Pueblo necklaces . They have been used in traditional medicine in Japan and China . In Indonesia , adults are caught on poles made sticky with birdlime , then fried in oil as a delicacy . 
 In the United States , dragonflies and damselflies are sought out as a hobby similar to birding and <unk> , known as <unk> , from the Latin name of the dragonfly order , Odonata . <unk> is especially popular in Texas , where 225 different species of <unk> have been observed . With care , and with dry fingers , dragonflies can be handled and released by <unk> , as can be done with butterflies , though it is not encouraged . 
 Images of dragonflies are common in Art Nouveau , especially in jewellery designs . They have also been used as a decorative motif on fabrics and home furnishings . Douglas , a British motorcycle manufacturer based in Bristol , named its innovatively designed postwar 350 @-@ cc flat @-@ twin model the Dragonfly . 
 Among the classical names of Japan are <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , Toyo @-@ <unk> ( <unk> ) . <unk> or <unk> are archaic or dialectal Japanese words for dragonfly , so one interpretation of <unk> is " Dragonfly Island " . This is attributed to a legend in which Japan 's mythical founder , Emperor <unk> , was bitten by a mosquito , which was then eaten by a dragonfly . 
 As a seasonal symbol in Japan , the dragonfly is associated with autumn . More generally , dragonflies are symbols of courage , strength , and happiness , and they often appear in art and literature , especially haiku . Japanese children catch large dragonflies as a game , using a hair with a small pebble tied to each end , which they throw into the air . The dragonfly mistakes the pebbles for prey , gets tangled in the hair , and is dragged to the ground by the weight . 
 In Europe , dragonflies have often been seen as sinister . Some English vernacular names , such as " horse @-@ stinger " , " devil 's darning needle " , and " ear cutter " , link them with evil or injury . Swedish folklore holds that the devil uses dragonflies to weigh people 's souls . The Norwegian name for dragonflies is <unk> ( " eye @-@ poker " ) , and in Portugal , they are sometimes called <unk> @-@ <unk> ( " eyes @-@ snatcher " ) . They are often associated with snakes , as in the Welsh name gwas @-@ y @-@ <unk> , " adder 's servant " . The Southern United States term " snake doctor " refers to a folk belief that dragonflies follow snakes around and stitch them back together if they are injured . 
 The watercolourist Moses Harris ( 1731 – 1785 ) , known for his The Aurelian or natural history of English insects ( 1766 ) , published in 1780 , the first scientific descriptions of several Odonata including the banded demoiselle , <unk> splendens . He was the first English artist to make illustrations of dragonflies accurate enough to be identified to species ( Aeshna grandis at top left of plate illustrated ) , though his inaccurate drawing of a larva ( at lower left ) appears to be plagiarised . 
 = = = In poetry and literature = = = 
 Lafcadio Hearn wrote in his 1901 book A Japanese Miscellany that Japanese poets had created dragonfly haiku " almost as numerous as are the dragonflies themselves in the early autumn . " The poet Matsuo Bashō ( 1644 – 1694 ) wrote haiku such as " Crimson pepper pod / add two pairs of wings , and look / darting dragonfly " , relating the autumn season to the dragonfly . Hori <unk> ( 1718 – 1783 ) similarly wrote " <unk> he is with the / Colour of autumnal days , / O red dragonfly . " 
 The poet Alfred , Lord Tennyson , described a dragonfly splitting its old skin and emerging shining metallic blue like " sapphire mail " in his 1842 poem " The Two Voices " , with the lines " An inner impulse rent the veil / Of his old husk : from head to tail / Came out clear plates of sapphire mail . " 
 The novelist H. E. Bates described the rapid , agile flight of dragonflies in his 1937 nonfiction book Down the River : 
 I saw , once , an endless procession , just over an area of water @-@ lilies , of small sapphire dragonflies , a continuous play of blue gauze over the snowy flowers above the sun @-@ glassy water . It was all confined , in true dragonfly fashion , to one small space . It was a continuous turning and returning , an endless darting , <unk> , striking and hovering , so swift that it was often lost in sunlight . 
 = Big King = 
 The Big King sandwich is one of the major hamburger products sold by the international fast @-@ food restaurant chain Burger King , and has been part of its menu for more than twenty years . During its testing phase in 1996 – 1997 , it was originally called the Double Supreme and was configured similarly to the McDonald 's Big Mac — including a three piece roll . It was later reformulated as a more standard double burger during the latter part of product testing in 1997 . It was given its current name when the product was formally introduced in September 1997 , but maintained the more conventional double cheeseburger format . Its introduction capped a period of sales success for Burger King , when the company successfully took on its rival McDonald 's . 
 The product was renamed King Supreme in 2001 when it was slightly reformulated as part of a menu restructuring during a period of corporate decline . A later restructuring eliminated the King Supreme in favor of its new BK Stacker line of sandwiches . When the Stacker line was discontinued in the United States shortly after , the Big King returned in November 2013 as a permanent product . 
 Despite being off the menu in the United States for several years , the product was still sold in several other countries under several names during the interim of its unavailability in the United States . One such example sold by BK 's European arm of the company is a larger version of the sandwich called the Big King XXL , based on the company 's Whopper sandwich . The Big King XXL is part of a line of larger double cheeseburgers known as the BK XXL line ; the XXL line was the center of controversy over product health standards and advertising in Spain when first introduced . 
 There is a chicken variant of the sandwich in the United States and Canada . To promote continuing interest in the product , Burger King occasionally releases limited @-@ time variants on the Big King . As one of the company 's major offerings , the Big King sandwich is sometimes at the center of advertising promotions and product tie @-@ ins . Additionally , as a major product in the company 's portfolio , Burger King has registered many global trademarks to protect its investment in the product . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Initial product run = = = 
 The sandwich that would eventually become the Big King was preceded by a similar sandwich called the Double Supreme cheeseburger . Burger King 's take on rival McDonald 's well @-@ known Big Mac sandwich was released as a test product in January 1996 when McDonald 's was having difficulties within the American market . Hoping to build on improving sales of Burger King and take advantage of perceived market weakness of McDonald 's , the chain introduced the Double Supreme as part of an advertising blitz against its competitor . Originally , the burger had a look and composition that resembled the Big Mac : it had two beef patties , " King " sauce , lettuce , cheese , pickles and onions on a three @-@ part sesame seed bun . Because its patties are flame @-@ broiled and larger than McDonald 's grill fried and seasoned patties , and the formulation of the " King Sauce " was different from McDonald 's " Special sauce " , the sandwich had a similar , but not exact , taste and different caloric content . The sandwich was reformulated after the initial test run , removing the center roll . The Double Supreme was advertised with a direct attack on the Big Mac , using the claims that it had 75 % more beef and less bread than the McDonald 's sandwich . A review of the Burger King sandwich by the Chicago Tribune verified these claims and also stated that the ingredients of the newer sandwich were of better quality than those of the McDonald 's product . 
 After the initial testing period , the sandwich was renamed the Big King and added to the national menu at the end of the summer of 1997 — the first major product introduction since the company added its BK Broiler chicken sandwich in 1990 . Unlike the Double Supreme , the new Big King lacked the interior bread piece the Big Mac had , and the advertising used to promote the Big King continued to utilize the 75 % more beef claim . However , the new sandwich was introduced while the company was dealing with a highly publicized beef recall from one of its key suppliers , Hudson Foods , and had to deal with accusations that the introduction was designed to distract the public and media from the recall . The sandwich was initially introduced in the United States at a 99 ¢ ( USD ) price point , which helped propel sales to nearly twice the estimated volume and causing many locations to sell out of the burger patties used to produce the sandwich . 
 McDonald 's initially downplayed the new sandwich , with a spokesman stating that there was only one place to get the real Big Mac . Despite McDonald 's claims that the sandwich was not a major issue for the company , its highly promoted Arch Deluxe sandwich was not a success and its " Campaign 55 " promotion , which reduced the price of certain sandwiches to 55 ¢ ( USD ) , was eliminated after franchisees complained that it had failed to boost sales . Against McDonald 's struggles , Burger King 's successful introduction of the Big King was later paired with a newly introduced , improved type of french fry in November of the same year . Along with these two product introductions , the company began a massive financial investment in product development across all parts of its menu which , in total , provided a boost in the chain 's market performance . The mirrored failure and success for the two companies showed itself in the market share of the United States fast @-@ food market : Burger King 's share rose a percentage point , to 19 @.@ 2 % , while McDonald 's share slipped 0 @.@ 4 points , to 41 @.@ 9 % by the end of 1997 . The McDonald 's drop capped a three @-@ year decline in the larger chain 's market share in the United States , which stood at 42 @.@ 3 % at the start of 1995 . 
 By 2001 , Burger King 's chain @-@ wide sales were lagging . Corporate indifference from parent Diageo coupled with lagging sales at larger franchises caused by declining consumer demand for its products led the company to initiate a menu redesign to try to lure customers back into stores . The company decided to introduce a series of new product launches in a planned menu revamp . Along with a new Whopper @-@ based burger designed to compete with McDonald 's Quarter Pounder , a new breakfast sandwich designed to compete with the McMuffin sandwich , and other new products , Burger King introduced a reformulated Big King replacement called the King Supreme . The new sandwich 's ingredients were basically the same as the Big King , but the King Sauce used in the sandwich was reformulated to , according to company claims , enhance the savory nature of the grilled burger patties Burger King uses in its sandwiches . This knock @-@ off driven menu reorganization was designed to better compete with a similar menu expansion at McDonald 's , called the New Tastes Menu , introduced earlier the same year . 
 = = = BK Stackers = = = 
 Burger King changed ownership in 2002 when Diageo sold its interest in the company to a group of investment firms led by TPG Capital . After assuming ownership , TPG 's newly appointed management team began focusing menu development and advertising on a very narrow demographic group , young men aged 20 – 34 who routinely ate at fast food restaurants several times per month which the chain identified as the " super fan " . Amid this new super @-@ fan focused menu expansion the chain introduced its new BK Stacker sandwich in late 2006 , a family of sandwiches featuring the same set of toppings served as a single , double , triple or quadruple hamburger . The Stacker line was part of a series of larger , more calorie @-@ laden products introduced by the company to entice the super @-@ fan into the chain 's restaurants . These new additions helped propel same store profits for more than sixteen quarters . 
 The Stacker consisted of anywhere from one to four 1 @.@ 7 oz ( 48 g ) beef patties , American cheese , bacon and a Thousand @-@ Island dressing variant called Stacker sauce served on a sesame seed bun . The new sandwiches had a muted reaction in several reviews — <unk> readers rated the Quad Stacker as one of the most over @-@ the @-@ top gluttonous burgers in a poll , while the Impulsive Buy stated that the sandwich was much like any other bacon cheeseburger but meatier . Despite its lukewarm reception , an internet meme relating to the sandwich developed rather quickly . Customers would create an " Octo @-@ Stacker " sandwich by purchasing two quad Stackers and mashing the two together sandwiches to create a sandwich with eight patties , eight slices of cheese and sixteen half pieces of bacon . They would then film themselves trying to eat the 1 lb ( 0 @.@ 45 kg ) sandwich in under five minutes . 
 With the onset of the Great Recession in 2008 – 2009 , this narrowly @-@ defined demographic @-@ based sales plan faltered and sales and profits for the chain declined ; Burger King 's same @-@ store comparable sales in the United States and Canada declined 4 @.@ 6 % in the three months ended September 30 , while McDonald 's posted same @-@ store comparable sales growth of 2 @.@ 5 % within the United States . The Stacker line underwent a minor reformulation in 2011 that involved deleting the top layer of cheese and changing the amount of bacon in the sandwiches , and moving the sandwiches from the core section of its menu to the company 's value menu . The changed ingredient list and pricing structure created a situation such that the distribution of ingredients did not scale at the same rate as increasing numbers of burger patties . Consumer Reports ' blog The Consumerist noted that two single Stackers at $ 1 @.@ 00 included more cheese and more bacon than one double Stacker for $ 2 @.@ 00 . Three single Stackers had 50 % more cheese and double the bacon of one triple Stacker . The Stacker line and other related calorie @-@ heavy menu items were dropped in 2012 when 3G Capital of Brazil bought the company and initiated a menu restructuring focusing on a broader demographic base . 
 = = = BK Toppers = = = 
 The BK Toppers line was a line of cheeseburgers introduced by Burger King in October 2011 as a limited time offer in North America . The sandwiches featured a new 3 @.@ 2 oz ( 91 g ) chopped beef patty made with a coarser grind than the company 's 2 oz ( 57 g ) hamburger patty . The three sandwiches included a larger version of Burger King 's Rodeo Cheeseburger , one made with sautéed mushrooms and processed Swiss cheese and the Cheeseburger Deluxe . The cheeseburger deluxe consisted of lettuce , pickles , onions , American cheese and Stacker sauce in a combinations similar to the King Supreme . 
 The sandwiches were a part of the new ownership 's plans to expand its customer base beyond the 18- to 34 @-@ year @-@ old demographic which it had been targeting over the previous several years . The product resurrected a previous name from the BK Hot Toppers line of sandwiches from the 1980s . 
 = = = Reintroduction = = = 
 The TPG @-@ led group of owners divested itself of Burger King in 2012 when the chain was sold to 3G Capital of Brazil . After 3G purchased Burger King , its new management team refocused on a broader menu strategy to lure a more diverse customer base . The first major change to the product base was a reformulation and name change of the company 's chicken nuggets in January 2013 . Along with other new products such as smoothies , wraps and chicken strips that broadly copied McDonald 's menu once again , the chain reintroduced the Big King as a permanent menu item in November of the same year . 
 The new version of the sandwich was originally made with two of the chain 's 1 @.@ 7 oz ( 48 g ) hamburger patties , but after negative consumer response regarding the size of the patties the sandwich was reformulated to use two 2 oz ( 57 g ) Whopper Jr. patties instead . A chicken variant was introduced in May 2014 . The new chicken variant swapped out the burger patties with two chicken patties used for the chain 's value menu chicken sandwiches and added a third layer of sauce to increase the moisture content of the sandwich . The sandwich was introduced nationwide in the U.S. after a period of testing in Indiana . While the chicken version of the sandwich was new to Burger King , it again copied a product from McDonald 's — in the Middle East the competing chain offers a Chicken Big Mac sandwich . 
 A primary reason the product was brought back was because of a new approach the company was taking regarding new and limited time offering ( LTO ) products . Instead of putting out large numbers of products that may only appeal to a small audience , it would only add a smaller amount of products that have broader market appeal . Along with its BK Chicken Fries product , the Big King was part of that goal , with the reintroduction utilizing a three prong approach : its stated intention to introduce products to those that will have most impact , a bid to appeal to Millennials utilizing social media focused campaigns , and to utilize a former product from its portfolio that the company probably should have thought about before discontinuing . The idea of reintroducing older , possibly discontinued products is appealing to companies such as Burger King and McDonald 's because it is operationally easier than launching a completely new product . In many cases the reintroduction allows these companies to utilize older advertising along with its existing supply chain which is already established to deliver the product ingredients while catering to the public 's feelings of nostalgia for these products . The limited @-@ time offers allow chains to bring " new " products to the menu without adding permanent complexity to their kitchen operations . The Chicken Big King was introduced because of an increased spike in demand for chicken @-@ based products , coupled with the success of the Big King 's reintroduction . 
 Burger King accredited the reintroduction of the Big King as helping the company regain a limited domestic same @-@ store comparable sales rise of .1 % in 2014 over a .9 % loss the previous fiscal year . At the same time the company 's total sales were up 2 % , with adjusted earnings per share increasing 19 @.@ 7 % to $ 0 @.@ 20 per share . This contrasted with main competitor McDonald 's only reporting a 3 % increase in global system @-@ wide sales , a 0 @.@ 5 % rise in same @-@ store sales , and a 1 @.@ 7 % decrease in same @-@ store sales in the U.S. and Canada which the competitor attributed to " challenging industry dynamics and severe winter weather . "

 As noted , the Big King sandwich was introduced to compete directly with the McDonald 's Big Mac sandwich . It joins a group of sandwiches from other vendors that are designed as counters to the more well @-@ known McDonald 's sandwich . This includes the Big <unk> sandwich originally from now @-@ defunct chain Burger Chef and occasionally produced as a LTO from current trademark owner <unk> . 
 The Big King was introduced at a time when McDonald 's was planning a similar move with a direct competitor to Burger King 's signature Whopper sandwich . The Big N ' Tasty was introduced in California at approximately the same time Big King was being nationally introduced in 1997 . Other similar products from McDonald 's were also undergoing testing at the same time ; either called the Big Xtra or the <unk> , these other two sandwiches were being test marketed in the Northeastern United States . The Big N ' Tasty eventually won out in testing , however its national roll @-@ out was delayed due to a corporate reorganization at McDonald 's . 
 = = Product description = = 
 The Big King is a hamburger , consisting of two 2 oz ( 57 g ) grilled beef patties , sesame seed bun , King Sauce ( a Thousand Island dressing variant ) , iceberg lettuce , onions , pickles and American cheese . When first reintroduced in 2013 , the sandwich was made with two of the company 's 1 @.@ 7 oz ( 48 g ) hamburger patties , but was modified in February 2014 to use two of the larger 2 @.@ 0 oz ( 57 g ) Whopper Jr. patties . 
 = = = Notable variants = = = 
 The Chicken Big King was added April 2014 . This new variation on the original Big King sandwich was part of a corporate menu restructuring that began the previous year . This was part of Burger King CEO Alex Macedo 's plan to introduce simpler products that require few or no new ingredients in order to simplify operations . This new sandwich uses the company 's existing Crispy Chicken Jr patty in place of the beef and adds an extra layer of King sauce to ensure that the product stays moist . 
 The Big King XXL is part of a line of sandwiches consisting of larger , 8 oz ( 230 g ) double cheeseburgers sold by Burger King in the European and Middle Eastern markets . It is one of their late @-@ teen to young @-@ adult male @-@ oriented products . Besides the Big King XXL , there are double cheeseburger and bacon double cheeseburger variants . 
 = = Advertising = = 
 = = = Double Supreme = = = 
 The Double Supreme was promoted in a series of advertisements created by the New York firm of Ammirati <unk> Lintas ( APL ) . The first ad compared the Double Supreme cheeseburger to the Big Mac , with one 30 @-@ second television spot touting the Burger King product contained 75 % more beef than the McDonald 's one and asked the viewer if Big Mac lovers were " ready for a new relationship ? " A second advertisement featured actors playing McDonald 's employees going to Burger King to get the new sandwich because they had realized that they preferred the Burger King product over the sandwich they normally sold . The attack ads were the result of the comparatively strong sales year for Burger King in 1996 coupled with domestic sales problems for McDonald 's , leaving BK acting in a " cocky " manner towards its main rival . 
 While Burger King 's advertising programs were highly focused on its new product , most of the company 's sales gains were the result of aggressive price cutting by Burger King , specifically pricing its signature Whopper sandwich at 99 ¢ , according to analysts at Salomon Brothers . The price cutting promotions by Burger King , and number @-@ three chain Wendy 's , forced McDonald 's into its own price cutting program . According to Salomon , the burger segment 's price wars would have a detrimental effect on the profits of segment leaders , allowing other smaller chains such as Sonic Drive @-@ In , Jack in the Box and Carl 's Jr to position themselves as attractive alternatives to the big three chains . 
 = = = 1997 Big King = = = 
 Advertising for the Big King was spearheaded by a national television program from APL that debuted on September 1 , 1997 . The television ads were part of a US $ 30 million program to promote the sandwich . It was introduced with a promotional price of 99 ¢ for the first two weeks of sales , which helped drive sales for the product . The advertisements featured the company 's new " Get Your Burger 's Worth " tagline and they attacked the Big Mac with the claim " Get ready for a new taste that beats the Big Mac . " Additional ads continued the attacks , stating " just like a Big Mac , except it 's got 75 % more beef . And it 's flame @-@ broiled . " 
 = = = King Supreme = = = 
 The King Supreme debuted with an advertising campaign created by the McCaffery Ratner Gottlieb & Lane agency and commercials produced by Aspect Ratio which featured blues legend B.B. King . The ads pushed the company 's lunch and dinner periods as the best time to have the sandwich and had King doing a voice over in which he alternately talked or sang about the sandwiches . The advertisements featured 15- and 30 @-@ second television spots in which King is shown sitting on a crescent moon , playing his guitar Lucille while speaking about the products and singing the company 's slogan . The 30 @-@ second ads were for both the King Supreme and the company 's other copycat product , the Egg McMuffin clone called the Egg 'Wich Muffin sandwich , while the 15 @-@ second ads were for each product individually . On the radio side , 30- and 60 @-@ second spots had King discussing the new sandwiches and singing their praise . The tag line for the ads was " BK and BB let you have it your way , " a variation on the company 's motto " Have it your way . " 
 Shortly after their debut , the ads came under fire from several fronts . Fans complained that the legendary musician was debasing himself by doing the commercials , that he was selling out by allowing his image to be used to peddle fast food . Other groups such as the American Diabetes Association pointed out that King , known for having weight issues and poorly controlled diabetes , was a questionable spokesperson for a burger chain that sells products that are not part of a healthier diet . Finally , several firms complained off the record that King was inconsistent in his endorsements , selling a highly fattening product while similarly endorsing diabetic products manufactured by the Johnson & Johnson company .

 The ads for the XXL bacon double cheeseburger described the XXL as a Whopper " with two enormous portions of flame @-@ broiled meat that will give you all the energy you need to take the world by storm , " and used the tag line of " It 's awful being a vegetarian , right ? " . 
 The British and German ad program for an LTO variant called the Cheesy Bacon XXL featured an edited version of the <unk> commercial created by Crispin Porter + Bogusky that was originally used for the company 's LTO Texas Double Whopper . The line mentioning the Whopper was edited out and replaced and the picture of the product was digitally replaced with one of the Cheesy Bacon XXL . The ad was sung entirely in English ; all signage , including road signs license plates on vehicles , etc . , was not translated into German .

 The company 's online advertising program in Spain described the BK XXL line as being made " with two enormous portions of flame @-@ broiled meat that will give you all the energy you need to take the world by storm . " This claim combined with the television advertising were the prime motivators behind the Spanish government 's concerns with the XXL sandwich line . The government claimed that campaign violated an agreement with the government to comply with an initiative on curbing obesity by promoting such a large and unhealthy sandwich . In response to the government 's claims , Burger King replied in a statement : " In this campaign , we are simply promoting a line of burgers that has formed part of our menu in recent years . Our philosophy can be summed up with the motto ' As you like it , ' in which our customers ' taste trumps all . " The company went on to say that it offers other healthier items such as salads and that customers are free to choose their own foods and modify them as they desire .

 = 2002 Gator Bowl = 
 The 2002 Gator Bowl was a post @-@ season American college football bowl game between the Virginia Tech Hokies and the Florida State Seminoles at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville , Florida on January 1 , 2002 . The game was the final contest of the 2001 NCAA Division I @-@ A football season for both teams , and ended in a 30 @-@ 17 victory for Florida State . 
 Virginia Tech was selected to play in the 2002 Gator Bowl with an 8 – 3 regular @-@ season record despite having just played in Jacksonville at the end of the previous year . The selection of Virginia Tech over the Syracuse Orangemen ( now just the " Orange " ) despite losing head @-@ to @-@ head and Syracuse having better conference and overall records was controversial . Florida State , who had failed to win at least a share of the Atlantic Coast Conference title for the first time since joining the league in 1992 , and who had played in all three BCS National Championship games held to that point , was selected as the opponent . 
 The 2002 Gator Bowl kicked off on January 1 , 2002 at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville , Florida , exactly one year since the Hokies had last played in the game . The game 's early going seemed promising for the defense @-@ minded Hokies . In the first quarter , Tech held Florida State scoreless despite only managing a single field goal on offense . In the second quarter , however , Florida State began to find gaps in the Hokie defense and scored 10 points . At halftime , Florida State held a 10 – 3 lead . 
 In the third quarter , Tech struck back . The Hokies scored 14 points in the quarter , while Florida State managed just a field goal . The Hokies ' All @-@ American tailback Lee Suggs had suffered a season @-@ ending injury in the first game of the season , but freshman Kevin Jones had carried the offense for the season , and continued to perform well in the post @-@ season Gator Bowl game . With a 5 @-@ yard run from Jones and a 55 @-@ yard pass from Grant Noel to André Davis , Tech took a 17 – 13 lead going into the fourth quarter . But the lead quickly evaporated on a 77 @-@ yard catch and run from Chris Rix to Javon Walker . 
 Florida State added ten more points after the long touchdown pass , and the Seminoles went on to win the game , 30 – 17 . 
 = = Team selection = = 
 At the start of the 2001 college football season , the Gator Bowl Committee held contracts with the Atlantic Coast Conference , Big East Conference , and Notre Dame , allowing the committee to select either Notre Dame or a team from each of the conferences to fill the two available slots . According to contract , the committee had the first selection of teams from each of the two conferences after the conferences ' champions were given automatic bids to a Bowl Championship Series game . 
 According to contract , the Gator Bowl was allowed to select any bowl @-@ eligible Big East team as long as it was within two wins of the second @-@ place team in the conference . This clause generated controversy when Virginia Tech ( 8 – 3 record ) received the Big East 's Gator Bowl spot instead of Syracuse ( 9 – 2 record ) . Syracuse fans , coaches , and players protested the selection of the third @-@ place Hokies ahead of second @-@ place Syracuse . Representing the Atlantic Coast conference was Florida State , which finished second in its conference with a record of 7 – 4 . 
 = = = Florida State = = = 
 Florida State entered the 2001 college football season after a 13 – 2 loss to Oklahoma in the national championship game . The loss was just the second for the Seminoles that season , and they finished with an 11 – 2 record . Despite their appearance in the previous year 's national championship game , the Seminoles were ranked as the No. 5 team in the country in the USA Today college football preseason poll . Florida State , which had a 70 – 2 record in Atlantic Coast Conference games since joining the conference , was again favored to win the ACC , but the Seminoles faced challenges replacing Heisman Trophy @-@ winning quarterback Chris Weinke and 14 other starters from the previous year 's team . Adding to the Seminoles ' challenges in the 2001 season was the loss of two starting wide receivers : Robert Morgan and Anquan Boldin , both of whom suffered season @-@ ending injuries before the first game of the season . 
 The bad omens of the preseason were discarded in the Seminoles ' first two games of the season : a 55 – 13 win against Duke and a 29 – 7 victory over Alabama @-@ Birmingham . In their third game of the season , however , Florida State suffered what was then the worst defeat in its history of play as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference , a 41 – 9 loss to North Carolina . Florida State recovered from the loss by beating Wake Forest , 48 – 24 , but lost to No. 2 Miami in the following week , 49 – 27 . 
 Three wins followed the loss to Miami , but two losses followed the brief winning streak : to Atlantic Coast Conference rival NC State , 34 – 28 , and in @-@ state rival Florida , 37 – 13 . The loss to NC State was the Seminoles ' first home defeat at the hands of an ACC opponent and dropped the Seminoles out of contention for the ACC championship . Following the loss to Florida , the Seminoles accepted a bid to the Gator Bowl . Florida State 's final game , a win against ACC opponent Georgia Tech , had no effect other than to improve Florida State 's regular @-@ season record , and the Seminoles began to prepare for the Gator Bowl . 
 = = = Virginia Tech = = = 
 The Virginia Tech Hokies began the 2001 season having gone 11 – 1 the previous season , ending with a 41 – 20 victory in the 2001 Gator Bowl against Clemson . Fans ' hopes for the new season were not as high as the previous year , however . Star quarterback Michael Vick was selected with the first pick in the 2001 NFL Draft , and there were questions about how well the team would cope with the loss of Vick and several other important players . Despite those fears , the Hokies began the 2001 season ranked No. 9 in the coaches ' poll and were picked in the annual poll of media covering the Big East to finish second in that conference . 
 In the opening game of the season , Virginia Tech defeated Connecticut , 52 – 10 , but lost starting running back Lee Suggs , who tore his anterior cruciate ligament during the game . Suggs ' absence did not affect the Hokies in their next game , as they defeated Western Michigan , 31 – 0 . The Hokies continued their winning streak through the first Virginia Tech games of the season , heading into a conference contest against Syracuse with a 6 – 0 record and ranked No. 5 in the country . On October 27 , however , Syracuse ended Tech 's 16 @-@ game home winning streak by defeating the Hokies , 22 – 14 , in Lane Stadium . 
 The loss to Syracuse was followed by another to Pittsburgh in the following week . The twin losses effectively knocked Tech out of contention for the Big East championship , as the Hokies were then two games behind first @-@ place Miami . Tech won its next two games of the season , but because Miami remained undefeated , the matchup between No. 1 Miami and No. 14 Virginia Tech was played without conference title implications . Before the Miami game , Virginia Tech accepted a bid to the Gator Bowl , which had the first pick of Big East teams after the Bowl Championship Series gave an automatic bid to the Big East champion . Miami defeated Tech in the final regular @-@ season game for both teams , 26 – 24 , and the Hokies began preparations for the Gator Bowl . 
 = = = Controversy = = = 
 Virginia Tech 's selection for the Gator Bowl was not without controversy . The Hokies ' three Big East losses pushed them to third place in the conference , behind Miami ( which earned an automatic bid to the national championship game ) and Syracuse , which lost only one Big East Conference game . Instead of attending the Gator Bowl , Syracuse earned a bid to the 2002 Insight Bowl , considered to be a less prestigious game due to its lesser payout and shorter history . Syracuse fans , coaches , and players were offended that Virginia Tech was awarded a bid to the Gator Bowl despite Syracuse 's better record due to Tech 's reputation for bringing large numbers of fans to bowl games . In the wake of Tech 's selection , Syracuse athletic director Jake <unk> vowed to lobby for changes in the way the Gator Bowl 's Big East selection was made . 
 = = Pregame buildup = = 
 The Florida State / Virginia Tech matchup was the 31st game between the two teams since they first met in 1955 . At the time , Florida State held the advantage in wins , with a 19 – 10 – 1 record against Virginia Tech . Heading into the 2002 Gator Bowl , however , spread bettors predicted a reversal of that trend as Virginia Tech was favored to win by two points on Dec. 10 . This was reflective of an overall feeling of pessimism toward the Seminoles , who hadn 't finished out of first place in the ACC since joining the league in 1992 , and would not participate in the national championship game for the first time in four years . Because of this decline in stature , the fact that the game was a rematch of the 2000 national championship game received less coverage than it would have otherwise . 
 Ticket sales for the game were relatively rapid . By Dec. 7 , Virginia Tech had sold almost its entire initial allotment of 12 @,@ 500 tickets , Florida State fans had purchased approximately 6 @,@ 800 tickets , and total ticket sales neared the 50 @,@ 000 mark . Tech 's sales increased to more than 13 @,@ 000 by Dec. 14 , and Virginia Tech officials requested an initial allotment from the Gator Bowl . Four days later , more than 60 @,@ 000 tickets had been sold , and there were expectations that the game would be a sellout . The growing demand for tickets was demonstrated by an incident in which nearly 200 all @-@ access passes to the game were stolen in transit from the printer and resold , causing a police search for the culprits .

Rix 's preferred passing target was wide receiver Javon Walker , who led the team by catching 45 passes for 944 yards and seven touchdowns . Fellow wide receiver Talman Gardner outpaced Walker in touchdowns , catching 11 during the season , enough for No. 5 in Florida State history to that point . 
 The Seminoles ' ground offense was led by running back Greg Jones , who finished the regular season with 713 yards and six rushing touchdowns . Florida State 's rushing game also was assisted by the mobility of Chris Rix , who gained 389 yards during the regular season , enough for No. 3 on the team in rushing yards . The Seminoles ' kicking game was run by placekicker Xavier Beitia , who successfully kicked 13 of 14 field goals and 44 of 48 extra points during the season for a total of 83 points .

 Virginia Tech 's offense was slightly worse than the national average during the regular season . The Hokies were ranked No. 64 in total offense , averaging 374 @.@ 09 yards per game . In particular , Tech 's passing offense was lacking . That segment of the offense was ranked No. 86 , averaging 179 @.@ 36 yards . This figure was somewhat balanced by the Hokies ' rushing attack , which was ranked No. 55 ( 194 @.@ 73 ypg ) . Despite the worse @-@ than @-@ average yardage totals , Tech was ranked No. 25 in scoring offense , or 32 @.@ 64 points per game . Prior to the Gator Bowl , it was announced that Virginia Tech offensive coordinator Rickey Bustle would be leaving the team to take the same position at the Louisiana @-@ Lafayette . Despite the move , he confirmed he would coach the Hokies during the bowl game in his last act as a Virginia Tech coach . 
 On the field , the Hokies were led by quarterback Grant Noel , who completed 146 of his 254 pass attempts for 1 @,@ 826 passing yards , 16 touchdowns , and 11 interceptions . Noel 's favorite passing target was André Davis , who caught 39 passes for 623 yards and seven touchdowns .

Fullback Jarrett Ferguson also set three single @-@ season receiving records by catching 25 passes for 256 yards and three touchdowns , all of which were school records for a fullback . Despite those numbers , most of Virginia Tech 's offense was gained on the ground . At the beginning of the season , running back Lee Suggs was the leader of the Hokies ' rushing offense . He set Virginia Tech records for career rushing touchdowns and career touchdowns before suffering a season @-@ ending injury in the Hokies ' game against Connecticut . Following Suggs ' injury , his role was taken up by freshman running back Kevin Jones , who set a Tech freshman running record by accumulating 957 yards .

The rule has since been rescinded . 
 Virginia Tech 's second drive of the game started at its 28 @-@ yard line after the penalty . Jones was stopped for little or no gain on the first two plays of the drive , then Noel completed a long pass to wide receiver Andre Davis , who dodged defenders and advanced the ball to the Florida State 17 @-@ yard line , a gain of 55 yards and a first down .

 The second quarter of the Gator Bowl began with the Seminoles facing third down and 12 from the Virginia Tech 30 @-@ yard line .

The ball rolled into the end zone , and Tech 's offense began a drive at its 20 @-@ yard line with 7 : 43 remaining in the first quarter . 
 Two incomplete passes and a one @-@ yard run later , Tech prepared to punt the ball away .

 On the first play of the drive , Rix completed a 42 @-@ yard pass to <unk> Thorpe . On the next play , the Seminoles advanced the ball 11 more yards on a running play . From the Tech 18 @-@ yard line , the Seminoles were stopped for no gain , endured a sack of Rix , then committed a five @-@ yard false start penalty . After being pushed back to the Tech 34 @-@ yard line , the Seminoles were unable to get a first down and elected to try a long field goal kick . Florida State placekicker Xavier Beitia entered the game to attempt a 50 @-@ yard kick . The kick was successful , and with 1 : 27 remaining in the first half , Florida State extended its lead to 10 – 3 . 
 After Virginia Tech went three @-@ and @-@ out , the Hokies punted to Florida State , who proceeded to run out the remaining seconds on the clock . The first half ended with Florida State leading , 10 – 3 .

 Because Florida State received the ball to begin the game , Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half . Florida State 's kickoff was returned to their 29 @-@ yard line , and Virginia Tech 's offense had the first possession of the second half . Jones rushed for six yards , then Noel completed a first @-@ down pass to Andre Davis at the Florida State 45 @-@ yard line . The Seminoles sacked Noel , but Noel regained the lost yardage and earned a first down with a completed pass to the 20 @-@ yard line . Three Tech rushes advanced the ball to the nine @-@ yard line and earned a first down . Two plays later , Jones dashed across the goal line for the first Tech touchdown of the game . The extra point kick was good , and Tech tied the score , 10 – 10 , with 10 : 02 remaining in the third quarter . 
 Florida State received the Tech kickoff and returned it to their 23 @-@ yard line . After an incomplete pass from Rix , Virginia Tech 's defense was caught offsides , resulting in a five @-@ yard gain for Florida State . A short run after the penalty gained a first down , but on the first play after the first down , the Seminoles fumbled the ball . The loose ball was recovered by Virginia Tech 's defense , and the Hokies began their second possession of the second half at the State 31 @-@ yard line . Tech was unable to capitalize on the field position , however . Noel threw an incomplete pass , was sacked , then threw a pass for a loss of yardage . Tech punted the ball , which was downed at the Florida State 12 @-@ yard line . 
 The Seminoles ' second possession of the second half began with more success than their first possession . State gained a first down on two running plays , then Rix completed a 14 @-@ yard pass for another first down . Now at their 36 @-@ yard line , the Seminoles advanced the ball for short ground gains on the next two plays , then Rix completed a 30 @-@ yard pass to Bell . Following the pass and first down , the Seminoles were at the Tech 34 @-@ yard line . Two short gains and an incomplete pass failed to gain another first down , so State head coach Bobby Bowden ordered kicker Beitia into the game to attempt a 47 @-@ yard field goal . The kick attempt was successful , and Beitia gave Florida State a 13 – 10 lead with 1 : 42 remaining in the quarter . 
 Following Florida State 's kickoff and a 38 @-@ yard return , Virginia Tech 's offense began work at its 45 @-@ yard line . On the second play of the drive , Noel completed a 55 @-@ yard pass to Andre Davis , who ran into the end zone for Virginia Tech 's second touchdown of the game . The extra point kick was good , and Virginia Tech regained the lead , 17 – 13 , with 40 seconds remaining in the quarter . 
 Virginia Tech kicked the ball off , and Florida State returned the kick 12 yards to its 18 @-@ yard line . The Seminoles gained five yards on two rushing plays before time ran out on the quarter , which ended with Virginia Tech leading , 17 – 13 . 
 = = = Fourth quarter = = = 
 The fourth quarter began with Florida State in possession of the ball and facing a third down and five yards . On the first play of the quarter , Rix was hit by a Virginia Tech defender , but not before he released a 77 @-@ yard pass to Walker , who ran into the end zone for a touchdown . The extra point try was good , and Florida State regained the lead , 20 – 17 , with 14 : 48 remaining in the game . 
 Florida State 's post @-@ score kickoff sailed through the end zone for a touchback , and Tech 's offense began its first drive of the quarter from its 20 @-@ yard line . Tech 's first play of the quarter was a 15 @-@ yard completed pass by Noel for a first down . That was followed by an 11 @-@ yard run by Jones for another first down . After an incomplete pass , Noel ran for a first down at the State 41 @-@ yard line . Inside Florida State territory , gaining ground became much more difficult . The next three plays netted Tech only nine yards , setting up a critical fourth @-@ and @-@ one play . With Virginia Tech outside field goal range and trailing , the Hokies needed another first down to move within potential scoring range . But on fourth down , Jones was stopped for no gain on a running play , and the Hokies turned the ball over on downs . The play later was cited as the game 's turning point . 
 After the turnover , Florida State received the ball at its 32 @-@ yard line with a 20 – 17 lead and 12 : 08 remaining in the game . On the first play after the turnover , Rix completed a 51 @-@ yard pass to Walker for a first down at the Tech 18 @-@ yard line . The three plays that followed netted only three yards , and Beitia was sent into the game to attempt a 35 @-@ yard field goal . The kick ricocheted off one of the uprights but through the goal posts , extending the Seminoles ' lead to 23 – 17 with 10 : 13 remaining in the game . 
 Florida State 's kickoff was fielded inside the Virginia Tech five @-@ yard line and returned to the Tech eight @-@ yard line . Tech gained five yards on two running plays , then Noel completed a 15 @-@ yard pass to Davis for a first down at the Tech 28 @-@ yard line . Noel and Jones each carried the ball , together gaining enough for a first down at the Tech 39 @-@ yard line . A completed pass and a short run by Jones resulted in another first down , this time at the 50 @-@ yard line . Florida State committed a five @-@ yard offsides penalty , but the Hokies were unable to gain a first down on the Seminoles ' side of the field . Rather than attempt to convert another fourth down , the Hokies punted the ball . 
 The kick was downed by Virginia Tech at the State 22 @-@ yard line with 5 : 22 remaining in the game . On the first play of the drive , Jones gained 13 yards and a first down at the 45 @-@ yard line of Florida State . This was followed by a 22 @-@ yard run and a first down by Jones at the Tech 33 @-@ yard line . Three more runs by Jones gained another nine yards , but rather than attempt a field goal , Bowden ordered his offense to attempt to convert the first down . A quarterback sneak resulted in just enough of a gain for a first down , and State 's drive continued . On the first play after the conversion , Rix completed a 23 @-@ yard pass to Walker for a touchdown . The score and subsequent extra point gave State a 30 – 17 lead with 2 : 14 remaining in the game . 
 Virginia Tech returned Florida State 's kickoff to their 23 @-@ yard line . After an incomplete pass , the Hokies gained a first down at their 33 @-@ yard line with a short pass . After the first down , Noel was sacked on successive plays . During the second sack , Florida State lineman Darnell Dockett collided with Noel 's helmet , twisting Dockett 's knee . Following the injury , Tech sent in backup quarterback Bryan Randall to attempt a long pass . The pass was intercepted by Florida State with 19 seconds remaining in the game . Following the interception , the Seminoles ran out the clock and secured a 30 – 17 win .

 = Ian Gillan = 
 Ian Gillan ( born 19 August 1945 ) is an English singer and songwriter . He originally found commercial success as the lead singer and lyricist for Deep Purple . 
 Initially influenced by Elvis Presley , Gillan started and fronted several local bands in the mid @-@ sixties , and eventually joined Episode Six when their original singer left . He first found widespread commercial success after joining Deep Purple in 1969 . After an almost non @-@ stop workload , during which time he recorded six albums in four years , and problematic relationships with other band members , particularly guitarist Ritchie Blackmore , Gillan resigned from the band in June 1973 , having given a lengthy notice period to their managers . 
 After a short time away from the music business , he resumed his music career with solo bands the Ian Gillan Band and Gillan , before a year @-@ long stint as the vocalist for Black Sabbath . He rejoined a reformed Deep Purple in 1984 , but was fired in 1989 . He rejoined the band for a second time in 1992 for their twenty @-@ fifth anniversary , and following the recruitment of guitarist Steve Morse in 1994 , has helped transform the group into a regular touring outfit , which he has fronted ever since . 
 In addition to his main work — performing with Deep Purple and other bands during the 1970s and 1980s — he sang the role of Jesus in the original recording of Andrew Lloyd Webber 's rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar , performed in the charity supergroup Rock Aid Armenia , and engaged in a number of business investments and ventures , including a hotel , a motorcycle manufacturer , and music recording facilities at Kingsway Studios . More recently , he has performed solo concerts concurrently with his latter career in Deep Purple , and his work and affinity with Armenia , combined with his continued friendship with Tony Iommi since his brief time in Black Sabbath , has led him to form the supergroup WhoCares with Iommi . His solo career outside of Deep Purple was given a comprehensive overview with the Gillan 's Inn box set in 2006 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Gillan was born on 19 August 1945 at Chiswick Maternity Hospital . His father , Bill , was a storekeeper at a factory in London , who came from Govan , Glasgow and left school at 13 , while his mother , Audrey , came from a family where she was the eldest of four children , who all enjoyed music and singing , and whose father ( Gillan 's grandfather ) had been an opera singer and amateur pianist . His sister , Pauline , was born in 1948 . One of Gillan 's earliest musical memories was of his mother playing " Blue Rondo a la Turk " on the piano . 
 He grew up moving between council flats before settling in a three @-@ bedroom semi @-@ detached on a council estate in Cranford , Hounslow , he was fond of animals in his early life , and enjoyed reading the comic strips of Dan Dare . His parents separated after Audrey discovered Bill had had an affair that started while he was stationed in the army during World War II . He began attending Hounslow College and stayed there through his early teenage years . He was influenced by Elvis Presley by hearing his records at home and at the local youth club . He switched to go to Acton County Grammar School ( now Acton High School ) to take his O Levels , where he was in the same class as Pete Townshend , but became distracted from studies after leaving the local cinema having watched a Presley film , deciding that he wanted to be a rock 'n'roll singer . He subsequently took a job manufacturing ice machines in Hounslow . 
 = = Career = = 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 Gillan 's first attempt at a band was called Garth Rockett and the <unk> , and consisted of himself on vocals and drums , alongside guitarist Chris Aylmer , who later went on to work with Bruce Dickinson . The band covered songs such as Tommy Roe 's Sweet Little Sheila and the Shadows ' Apache . He discovered he couldn 't sing and play drums at the same time , so settled on the role of lead vocalist , performing regularly at St Dunstan 's Hall , the local youth club . He soon switched to another local band who also played at Dunstan 's Hall , Ronnie and the <unk> , who renamed themselves as the Javelins after he joined . The band played covers of Sonny Boy Williamson , Chuck Berry , Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard , and were early customers of then @-@ local music shop owner Jim Marshall . The Javelins disbanded in March 1964 , with guitarist Gordon <unk> leaving to join what eventually became the Sweet . 
 After the Javelins , Gillan joined a soul band , Wainwright 's Gentlemen , which included another future Sweet member , drummer Mick Tucker . The band recorded a number of tracks including a cover of The Hollies hit " Ain 't That Just Like Me " . Although the band played several local popular music venues , they did not find success , so in April 1965 , he decided to join Hatch End based Episode Six . 
 = = = Episode Six = = = 
 Gillan had been contacted by Episode Six 's manager Gloria Bristow , who worked for Helmut Gordon , original manager of The Detours , later to become the Who . He replaced original lead singer Andy Ross , who left to get married , and joined keyboardist and singer Sheila Carter , guitarists Graham Carter and Tony Lander , bassist Roger Glover and drummer Harvey Shields . Gillan considers Episode Six to be his first truly professional band , and in their early days were sponsored and championed by Tony Blackburn , who occasionally accompanied Gillan on stage . Later , as well as performing concerts in the UK , Episode Six also toured Germany and Beirut . , and had regular appearances on the BBC Light Programme . During his time with Episode Six , Gillan began writing songs together with Glover , forming an ultimately long lasting partnership . After a strained tour of Beirut , Shields left the band and was replaced first by John <unk> , then by Mick Underwood . Underwood had previously played in The Outlaws with Ritchie Blackmore , and it was via him that Ian was put in touch with to form Deep Purple in 1968 . Gillan originally declined the position of lead singer in the band , though by 1969 , after having released nine singles , none of which charted in the UK , and finding their style of music too restrictive for him , he decided to leave Episode Six . 
 = = = Deep Purple , 1969 – 73 = = = 
 By spring 1969 , Deep Purple had had a top 5 US hit with " Hush " , but the band , particularly Ritchie Blackmore , Jon Lord and Ian Paice , decided their future lay in hard rock , rather than the psychedelic pop sound of the early band . On 4 June 1969 , Blackmore , Lord and Paice went to see Episode Six perform at the Ivy Lodge Club in Woodford , and subsequently offered Gillan the job as new lead singer , asking him if he also knew any good bassists . Since Glover was by this point a reasonably experienced songwriter , having penned several Episode Six B sides , he was also recruited . They were both accepted into the band on 16 June 1969 , replacing singer Rod Evans and bassist Nic Simper respectively . The old line up of Deep Purple continued to do several concerts until the end of the month , whereupon Evans and Simper were both fired by managers Tony Edwards and John Colletta after their last show on 4 July . 
 Gillan made his first onstage appearance with Deep Purple at the Speakeasy in London 's West End on 10 July . As the band had only been rehearsing for a few weeks , they relied on older instrumentals such as " Wring That Neck " and " Mandrake Root " to fill in a set . Unsure of what to do , Gillan found a pair of congas onstage , and decided to play them during these instrumental sections . The congas would subsequently become a trademark of his live performances with the band . 
 Deep Purple Mk.II continued rehearsing at Hanwell Community Centre . One of Gillan 's first notable contributions to the band during these rehearsals was the vocal melody and lyrics to " Child in Time " . At Hanwell , the band wrote what would eventually become most of In Rock during 1969 , though were interrupted in September to perform Lord 's Concerto for Group and Orchestra , a one off performance in September at the Royal Albert Hall with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra . Gillan , along with Blackmore , was initially unhappy at having to perform the concerto , and wrote the lyrics to the second movement on the afternoon of the performance on a napkin in an Italian restaurant . 
 In 1970 , Gillan received a call from Tim Rice , asking him to perform the part of Jesus on the original 1970 album recording of Jesus Christ Superstar , having been impressed with his performance on " Child in Time " . After rehearsing a few times with Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber , he recorded his entire vocal contributions in three hours . He was subsequently offered the lead role in the 1973 film adaptation . Gillan demanded to not only be paid £ 250 @,@ 000 for his role in the movie , but also insisted , without the consent of his manager , that the entire band be paid because filming would conflict with a scheduled tour . The producers declined , instead casting Ted Neeley in the Jesus role , and Gillan continued on in the band . 
 After 1971 , particularly after the release of Fireball , Gillan started to become disillusioned with the workload of the band , who had not had any holiday since their initial rehearsals at Hanwell . He started drinking , and relationships between him and the rest of the band became strained , particularly with Blackmore . On 6 November 1971 , he collapsed with hepatitis while waiting to board a plane in Chicago , cancelling the remainder of a US tour . 
 By December 1972 , having recorded Machine Head , Made in Japan and the yet to be released Who Do We Think We Are with Deep Purple , Gillan finally decided the workload had driven him to exhaustion . Unlike some band members , he was unhappy about Made in Japan , and disliked live albums in general . He tended to go into the studio after the rest of the band had recorded and finished the backing tracks , particularly for Who Do We Think We Are , to lay down his vocals separately . He had been continually at loggerheads with Blackmore , disagreeing about music regularly , which culminated in Gillan writing " Smooth Dancer " about him . While on tour in Dayton , Ohio , he sat down and wrote a resignation letter to the band 's managers , stating he intended to leave the band , effective from 30 June 1973 . He was replaced by David Coverdale . 
 = = = Post @-@ Purple = = = 
 After his departure from Deep Purple , Gillan retired from performing to pursue various unsuccessful business ventures . These included a £ 300 @,@ 000 investment in a hotel near Oxford . A second was the Mantis Motor Cycles project , which suffered from the collapse of the British motorcycle industry in the mid @-@ 1970s , culminating in Gillan being forced to file for liquidation . A more successful opportunity , however , came with his investment in Kingsway Studios in 1974 , This led to a live performance at the Butterfly Ball on 16 October 1975 , replacing Ronnie James Dio at the last minute . Encouraged by his reception there , he decided to resume his musical career . 
 = = = Ian Gillan Band = = = 
 In 1975 , Gillan formed the Ian Gillan Band with guitarist Ray Fenwick , keyboardist Mike Moran , quickly replaced with Mickey Lee Soule and then Colin Towns on keyboards , Mark Nauseef on drums and John Gustafson on bass . Their first album , Child in Time was released in July 1976 , followed by Clear Air Turbulence in April 1977 and <unk> in October . The sound of the band had a distinct jazz @-@ rock aspect which , although interesting to Gillan , proved unpopular , particularly since punk rock was in vogue at that time . 
 = = = Gillan = = = 
 Gillan then formed a new band , simply called Gillan , retaining Towns ( who would co @-@ write most of the material ) , and adding guitarist Steve Byrd , bassist John McCoy and drummer Pete Barnacle . Byrd and Barnacle were quickly replaced by Bernie Torme and by former Episode Six bandmate Mick Underwood , after Gillan saw Torme playing with his punk trio . This band had a more high powered hard rock sound , and the release of Mr. Universe in October 1979 saw Ian Gillan back in the UK charts , although the independent record company the album came out on – Acrobat Records – folded soon after the album was released , prompting a contract with Richard Branson 's Virgin Records . 
 In Christmas 1979 , Gillan was visited by Blackmore , who offered him the position of lead vocalist in Rainbow . Gillan declined due to the smaller workload the band had compared to his own . However , the pair did jam together for three nights at Marquee Club – the first time the two men had shared a stage since 1973 . 
 Gillan continued , releasing Glory Road in 1980 , which contained the hit single " Trouble " , and resulted in the band making the first of several appearances on Top of the Pops . He considered the album to be his best work since Machine Head nearly a decade earlier . Following subsequent album Future Shock , Torme was fired after missing an appearance on Top of the Pops , and was replaced by Janick Gers . Gers appeared on the band 's next two albums , Double Trouble and Magic . 
 In 1982 Ian Gillan announced the band would fold , as he needed to rest his damaged vocal cords . The tone and style of his singing changed considerably when he eventually returned . His voice had a more nasal tone and this can be heard on albums he has made from 1983 to the present day . His use of multi @-@ tracked backing vocals also became highly prominent . The rest of the band Gillan , particularly McCoy and Towns , were not happy at the sudden disbanding of the group so soon after the success of Magic , and sued Gillan for royalties . 
 = = = Black Sabbath = = = 
 In 1983 , manager Don Arden invited Gillan to join Tony Iommi , Geezer Butler and Bill Ward , all founding members of Black Sabbath , to form a supergroup . Although the band had reservations , on 6 April 1983 , it was formally announced that Gillan had replaced Ronnie James Dio in Black Sabbath . The group recorded the album Born Again at the Manor Studios in Oxfordshire . Citing health problems , Ward decided not to accompany the others during the subsequent tour , and was replaced by Bev Bevan . 
 As a member of Black Sabbath , Gillan was required to learn their old repertoire , but had difficulty remembering the words . He eventually came up with a solution of writing the lyrics out on a perspex folder , and balancing it on a wedge monitor , turning the pages with his feet . Unfortunately , the dry ice on stage made it impossible to read the words , resulting the audience witnessing glimpses of him peering over the microphone to sing a few lines , then disappearing below the dry ice to read the next set . As well as material from Born Again , and older Sabbath numbers , the band regularly played Deep Purple 's " Smoke on the Water " as an encore . 
 Gillan was largely dissatisfied with his brief stint in Sabbath , notably the final mix of Born Again ( though he liked the songs and their original mixes ) , and its cover , which featured a demonic @-@ looking baby . He was quoted in Kerrang ! in 1984 as saying , " I looked at the cover and puked . " In an interview supporting Deep Purple 's reformation in 1984 , he stated of Born Again , " They had sent me a box of records . And , when I saw the cover , and heard the mix , I smashed every single one of them to pieces . " Born Again also received mostly negative reviews from the critics upon its release but was appreciated by several fans and other musicians who covered some songs from the album . 
 = = = Reunion of Deep Purple , 1984 – 89 and 1992 – present = = = 
 After the disappointment of Black Sabbath , Gillan joined a reunited Deep Purple in April 1984 , announcing their comeback on Tommy Vance 's radio show . The reformed band rehearsed in Stowe , Vermont , and recorded the album Perfect Strangers , followed by a world tour . Another studio album with this formation , The House of Blue Light followed in 1987 , but Gillan was concerned with the final results , stating " There 's something missing in the overall album . I can 't feel the spirit of the band . " 
 This was followed by the live album Nobody 's Perfect in 1988 . The live album also featured a studio re @-@ recording of the 1968 hit " Hush " with Gillan on vocals , to commemorate Deep Purple 's 20th anniversary . ( The original 1968 release had been sung by Rod Evans ) . Gillan later remarked that the album was " the embodiment of all the things wrong with Purple . " 
 In contrast to his experiences with Deep Purple in the 1970s , Gillan felt frustrated that the band were no longer working enough . To fulfil his contract with Virgin , he formed a side project with Glover , writing and recording songs which didn 't fit Purple 's established hard rock style , which resulted in the album Accidentally on Purpose . By 1989 , tensions between Gillan and Blackmore had resurfaced , due to the former 's greater enthusiasm for touring and differences over the music – the song " Mitzi Dupree " on The House of Blue Light is the original demo as Blackmore refused to re @-@ record it . This culminated in Blackmore calling a rehearsal session without Gillan . After an acrimonious argument , Glover told Gillan , " Ian , you 've gone too far this time , " and he was fired , to be replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Joe Lynn Turner for one Deep Purple studio album . 
 Gillan , meanwhile formed a new version of Garth Rockett and the <unk> with keyboardist Mark Buckle , bassist Keith Mulholland , drummer Louis Rosenthal and guitarists Harry Shaw and Steve Morris . The band toured regularly through 1989 , and recorded the album Naked Thunder . Gillan later expressed dissatisfaction with the album , calling it " rather hum @-@ de @-@ dum " . During this time , Gillan also made an appearance on a re @-@ recording of " Smoke on the Water " with Rock Aid Armenia , consisting of himself , Bryan Adams , Tony Iommi , David Gilmour , Roger Taylor , Brian May , Bruce Dickinson and Paul Rodgers as a charity record for aid relief in Armenia following the then @-@ recent earthquake . He continued to tour with his solo band , albeit with several line up changes throughout Europe , the US and Russia . 
 At the urging of Glover , Lord and Paice , who wanted him in the fold for the band 's 25th anniversary tour , Gillan rejoined Deep Purple in 1992 to record the album The Battle <unk> On . Gillan was unhappy with working on the album , as it had already been partially completed with Joe Lynn Turner , and he was only required to write replacement lyrics and vocal melodies , which , unsurprisingly , drew criticism from Blackmore . Part @-@ way through the tour for this album , Ritchie Blackmore left the band for good in November 1993 . 
 Gillan was especially enthusiastic about carrying on after Blackmore 's departure , and after a brief stint with Joe Satriani , Deep Purple recruited Dixie Dregs / Kansas guitarist Steve Morse . He was keen to make changes to the live set immediately , adding the then @-@ seldom played " Maybe I 'm a Leo " ( named after Gillan 's birth sign ) and " When a Blind Man Cries " – the latter becoming a mainstay in the band 's setlist ever since . He said that their first album with Morse , <unk> , " was a such important record for Deep Purple that without that [ other records ] couldn 't have been possible . " . Although the band has found more success touring than with producing records , Gillan remains the band 's singer to this day . 
 Gillan pays particular interest to the lyrics in Deep Purple , and considers it his prime composing role within the band . Discussing the importance of lyrics , he said " Words have to sound good . They have to sound like an instrument , they have to have the right percussive value . " He described the words of 2003 's Bananas as " politics mostly . " Since 2005 's Rapture of the Deep , Deep Purple has been touring continually . Gillan is particularly motivated to keeping the band touring , as he feels that regular live performance is required to keep his voice in shape , and enjoys the band 's improvisational skills , feeling that it keeps the performance " fresh " for fans . 
 " I haven 't ever had any ambition in my life . I just drift from day to day with a stupid grin on my face . " 
 = = = Later Solo Activity = = = 
 Though Gillan has kept touring with Deep Purple regularly since 1994 , he has found time to commit to other projects . 
 On 31 March 2006 Gillan appeared at the Tommy Vance tribute concert in London . He was accompanied by Roger Glover , Steve Morris , Dean Howard , Michael Lee Jackson , Harry James , Sim Jones and Richard Cottle . 
 In April 2006 Gillan released a CD / multimedia project to document his 44 @-@ year career called Gillan 's Inn .

 Gillan has expressed particular fondness for Armenia and has maintained popularity there since Rock Aid Armenia in 1989 , which has led to him forming the supergroup WhoCares as a side @-@ project to Deep Purple . 
 In May 1990 Gillan visited Armenia and played four concerts at the Karen Demirchyan Complex . 
 On 2 October 2009 , in honour of the 20th anniversary of Rock Aid Armenia , Gillan together with Tony Iommi , Geoff Downes , and the project organiser Jon Dee were received by the Prime Minister of Armenia who awarded them with the republic 's Orders of Honour . 
 On 26 and 27 March 2010 , in Yerevan , Gillan performed with State Philharmonic Orchestra of Armenia . At a press conference in Yerevan on 27 March , Gillan said he considers Armenia his spiritual motherland . 
 In 2010 , Ian Gillan met Tony Iommi , Nicko McBrain and Jon Lord , Mikko Lindström from HIM and Jason Newsted at a studio in London to finish recording a song called " Out of my Mind " , which was released 6 May 2011 . This is for the benefit of the music school to be built in Gyumri , Armenia – a project Ian Gillan has been working on with others since his 1990 solo concerts in Yerevan . 
 On the flight back from Armenia in 2011 , after each receiving the Armenian Presidential medal of Honour , Gillan and Iommi decided to form the side project WhoCares for ad hoc recordings ( and possible performances ) dedicated to raising money for specific causes . 
 On 20 September 2013 Ian Gillan participated in the opening of the Octet Music School in Gyumri . The Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America named Ian Gillan as its 2014 " Friend of the Armenians " and presented him the award at the 112th Diocesan Assembly in New York City .

 Gillan was in a relationship with Zoe Dean from 1969 to 1978 . They had known each other since his time in Episode Six . 
 In 1984 , Gillan married his girlfriend Bron , to whom he had dedicated " Keep It Warm " from Black Sabbath 's 1983 album Born Again . They have twice since renewed their marriage vows . Gillan has two children and three grandchildren , all of whom were brought up in Scotland . Gillan moved to southern Portugal in the late 2000s . 
 Gillan is a passionate football fan , supporting Queens Park Rangers . He is also a big fan of cricket . He is also known for his intolerance of aggressive crowd security personnel at concerts . On 15 August 1998 , he was charged with assault after striking a security guard on the head with a microphone . 
 His surname is sometimes misspelled as " Gillian " . Gillan himself made light of this in the lyrics to " MTV " , a track from Deep Purple 's 2005 album Rapture of the Deep , when he sang about " Mr. Grover ' n ' Mr Gillian " . 
 = = = Professional relationship with Blackmore = = = 
 Gillan was room @-@ mates with Ritchie Blackmore in the 1970s , but left the band in 1973 amid tensions with Blackmore and overall exhaustion . In a 2006 interview , Gillan said of Blackmore 's final 1993 departure from Deep Purple , " he turned into a really weird guy , and the day he walked out of the tour was the day the clouds disappeared and the day the sunshine came out and we haven 't looked back since . " He added that " there are certain personal issues that I have with Ritchie , which means that I will never speak to him again . Nothing I 'm going to discuss publicly , but deeply personal stuff . " 
 In March 2009 , Gillan claimed that prior to the 1993 reunion of the band , Blackmore had requested $ 250 @,@ 000 be deposited in his bank account in order for him to continue with the reunion . The other members of the band did not receive anything . This claim was subsequently denied by Blackmore 's solicitor in a statement released soon after . 
 In August 2014 , he was quoted in Rolling Stone magazine as saying : " I don 't have an issue with Ritchie , nor does anyone . I 've been in touch with Ritchie recently and everything 's cool , so there 's no bitter , personal problem . We 're too old for that and everything 's in the past . " He did however add that if Deep Purple was chosen as one of the inductees of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , it would be out of the question to have Blackmore play with the band again due to it being " disrespectful " to the current lineup of the band .

 = Glarentza = 
 Glarentza ( Greek : Γλαρέντζα ) is a medieval town located near the site of modern Kyllini in Elis , at the westernmost point of the Peloponnese peninsula in southern Greece . Founded in the mid @-@ 13th century by William II of Villehardouin , the town served as the main port and mint of the Frankish Principality of Achaea , being located next to the Principality 's capital , Andravida . Commerce with Italy brought great prosperity , but the town began to decline in the early 15th century as the Principality itself declined . In 1428 , Glarentza was ceded to the Byzantine Despotate of the Morea , and served as its co @-@ capital , being the residence of one of the Palaiologos despots , until the Ottoman conquest in 1460 . Under Ottoman rule , Glarentza declined rapidly as the commercial links with Italy were broken , and by the 16th century was abandoned and falling into ruin . Little remains of the town today : traces of the city wall , of a church and a few other buildings , as well as the silted @-@ up harbour . 
 = = History = = 
 Glarentza was founded in the mid @-@ 13th century by William II of Villehardouin ( ruled 1246 – 78 ) , the ruler of the Principality of Achaea , a Frankish state established after the Fourth Crusade and encompassing the Peloponnese or Morea peninsula in southern Greece . Its Frankish foundation is evident in its name , Clarence or <unk> in French , Chiarenza or <unk> in Italian , <unk> or <unk> in Latin , rendered <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , or Γλαρέντζα ( Glarentza ) in contemporary Greek documents . 
 The medieval town was located a bit further west of the modern village of Kyllini , on the northern tip of a headland that forms the westernmost point of the Peloponnese . This was a site known since Antiquity as the best anchorage in all of Elis , and was likely the site of the ancient city of Cyllene . Glarentza was established as the haven for the Principality 's capital , located inland at Andravida , some 13 kilometres ( 8 @.@ 1 mi ) away . Along with Andravida and the fortress of Clermont or Chlemoutsi , some 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) from the port , Glarentza formed the administrative heart of the Principality of Achaea . 
 Glarentza profited from its location and became the main port for communication and traffic between the Morea and Italy . As described in the town 's Greek Ministry of Culture website , Glarentza " rapidly established itself as the most important financial and urban centre of the Crusader principality , with an international renown " , while according to the medievalist Antoine Bon , it was " the agglomeration which should most resemble , by its activity , a city in the modern sense of the word " . It was a cosmopolitan city , frequented by emissaries from Italy , soldiers and merchants , chiefly Venetians . Trade brought great prosperity , as evidenced by the fact that it used its own system of weights and measures in the 14th century . It featured a hospital as well as banks , lodgings for the mariners , and a Franciscan monastery . Based on a 1391 list of fiefs , the town counted ca . 300 hearths , making it among the largest in the Principality . 
 The town was also the site of the princely mint , which from the 13th century until its cessation , in 1353 , struck denier <unk> or <unk> coins , inscribed initially with [ DE ] <unk> , and , from the reign of Florent of Hainaut ( ruled 1289 – 97 ) onwards , with DE <unk> . Although Andravida was the main residence of the princely court , Glarentza too was a location of political significance , and several parliaments and assemblies took place there , such as the adjudication on the inheritance of the Barony of Akova in 1276 , or the parliament and oath of allegiance to Isabella of Villehardouin and Florent of Hainaut in 1289 . Glarentza was surrounded by a set of walls , but scholars have long disputed exactly when this was done . The debate concerns the relation between Glarentza and the nearby fortress of Clermont / Chlemoutsi , which in the view of those who consider Glarentza to have originally been unfortified served as the town 's citadel , in which case this was probably the original site of the mint , whence its alternative name of " Castel <unk> " . 
 In June 1315 , Glarentza was captured by the Aragonese troops of the infante Ferdinand of Majorca , who claimed the princely title of Achaea for himself by virtue of his marriage to Isabella of <unk> , granddaughter of William II of Villehardouin . Ferdinand made Glarentza his residence , and soon seized all of Elis , aided by the defection of several Achaean barons dissatisfied with the Principality 's rule by the Angevins of Naples . Ferdinand began minting coins with his name — the rarest issues of the Glarentza mint — but his reign was cut short with the arrival of the legitimate claimants , Matilda of Hainaut and Louis of Burgundy . In the Battle of <unk> , fought to the northeast of Glarentza on 5 July 1316 , the Aragonese were defeated and Ferdinand was killed . The remainder of his army fled to Glarentza , and soon handed over the town and the other fortresses they had occupied and departed the Peloponnese , taking the corpse of Ferdinand with them . 
 The town 's decline began in the early 15th century , following the worsening fortunes of the Principality itself . At that time , Achaea , under Prince Centurione II Zaccaria ( ruled 1404 – 30 ) , found itself endangered by the attacks of the Byzantines of the Despotate of the Morea on the one hand and the expansionist designs of the Tocco family of Cephalonia and Zakynthos on the other . In late 1407 , Centurione 's own brother @-@ in @-@ law Leonardo II Tocco seized Glarentza and reaped an enormous booty , as recorded in the Chronicle of the Tocco . It took several years of conflicts and diplomatic manoeuvrings before a Venetian @-@ mediated deal restored the city to Centurione in July 1414 . In 1417 , the Byzantines under the Despot Theodore II Palaiologos and his brother John VIII Palaiologos , launched another attack on the remains of the Principality . The brothers made swift progress , forcing Prince Centurione to retire to Glarentza , which was unsuccessfully attacked by the Byzantines . A truce was concluded in 1418 , but in the same year , an Italian adventurer , Olivier Franco , seized the town , which in 1421 he sold to Carlo I Tocco , Leonardo 's elder brother . 
 With Glarentza in their hands , the <unk> now began to openly pursue their aspirations in the Peloponnese , and attacked the territories of the Latin Archbishop of Patras Stephen Zaccaria , Centurione 's brother . In 1427 , the Byzantines , led by emperor John VIII in person , attacked the Tocco lands in the Peloponnese . After the Byzantine fleet defeated his navy , Carlo was forced to submit , and in 1428 , Glarentza was handed over as part of the dowry of his niece , Maddalena , who was married to the Despot Constantine Palaiologos ( the future last Byzantine emperor ) . When Constantine besieged Patras in 1429 , a Catalan fleet that came to the city 's aid captured Glarentza , forcing Constantine to ransom it back . He then destroyed its fortifications , so that it could no longer be seized and used by a western power . 
 In 1430 , following the final subjugation of the Principality of Achaea by the Byzantines , the Peloponnese was divided into appanages among the various Palaiologos princes . Glarentza became the residence of Thomas Palaiologos until 1432 , when he exchanged his portion with Constantine , who had originally settled at Kalavryta . In 1446 , Glarentza and its surrounding region were raided by the Ottoman Turks under Sultan Murad II , and in 1460 , it fell to the Ottomans along with the remainder of the Byzantine Peloponnese . Although nearby Chlemoutsi continued to play a role as a military stronghold until the 19th century — it was garrisoned by the Venetians during the Ottoman – Venetian War of 1463 – 79 , and attacked by the Knights of Malta in 1620 — Glarentza itself seems to have rapidly fallen into obscurity under the Ottomans , apparently declining as the maritime links with Italy were severed . By the 16th century , it was already abandoned and half @-@ ruined . The ruins were described by successive travellers until the 19th century , and photographs were also taken later . During the German occupation of Greece in World War II , the German Army demolished many of the remains . 
 In the early 19th century , several authors and travellers , like Robert Byron , contended that Glarentza ( in its Latin form , <unk> / <unk> ) gave its name to the royal English title of the " Duke of Clarence " , via Princess Matilda of Hainaut and her cousin Philippa of Hainaut , a claim that has been repeated by reputable publications like the Meyers <unk> @-@ <unk> encyclopedia into the 20th century . However , this view was conclusively rejected already in 1846 by the military officer and antiquarian William Martin Leake , who pointed out that at no time did English royalty hold <unk> titles , and that " Clarence " originates from Clare , Suffolk , and not Glarentza . 
 = = Location and archaeological remains = = 
 The town of Glarentza was situated on a small plateau , sloping slightly downwards from west to east , at the extreme northwestern end of the peninsula known in Antiquity as <unk> . The town occupied an irregular shape of ca . 450 metres ( 1 @,@ 480 ft ) from east to west and 350 metres ( 1 @,@ 150 ft ) from north to south , i.e. a surface of ca . 8 @,@ 800 square metres ( 95 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . The northern and western sides of the town bordered on the sea and were protected by a cliff of some 50 m in height descending to the sea . The port was located in the north , shielded from the dangerous western and southwestern winds . 
 There are very few material remains of the medieval town today . The city wall that surrounded the settlement has largely disappeared and is difficult to trace today , but from the remains of its foundations it does not appear to have been a substantial fortification . It was lightly built , with a thickness of perhaps 1 @.@ 8 – 2 metres ( 5 @.@ 9 – 6 @.@ 6 ft ) , reinforced by rectangular towers . The three gates have left far more substantial remains . The eastern , southeastern and southern sides were fronted by a ditch of some 20 – 22 metres ( 66 – 72 ft ) , with the excavated soil dumped on the inner side and used to elevate the city wall . A small citadel was located in the southwestern corner of the town . The port was separated from the main town by a wall , and was situated in an excavated basin ( today a swamp ) and probably separated from the sea by an artificial mole and protected by extensions of the city walls . The entrance to the harbour was from the west , offering protection from both the wind and the coast 's shoals . 
 Among the few remains of buildings from the interior of the town , most notable are a large monumental staircase and a large church , with dimensions of some 43 by 15 metres ( 141 ft × 49 ft ) , in the northeast . The church was of relatively simple construction , but of unusual size , and A. Bon proposes its identification with the church of the Franciscans , where assemblies of the nobles of Achaea were held in 1276 and 1289 . The remaining portions of the church 's walls were completely destroyed by the German Army during the Occupation . 
 The site is currently managed by the 6th <unk> of Byzantine Antiquities . It is accessible by car , and is open for visitors .

 Band Hero is a spinoff video game as part of the Guitar Hero series of music rhythm games , released by Activision on November 3 , 2009 , for the PlayStation 2 , PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 , Wii and Nintendo DS consoles . The game is structurally similar to Guitar Hero 5 , and supports full band play ( lead and bass guitar , drums , and vocals ) including the drop @-@ in / drop @-@ out and in @-@ song instrument and difficulty change menus , and additional multiplayer modes as Guitar Hero 5 . The console versions use instrument @-@ shaped game controllers , while the DS version uses either the " Guitar Grip " introduced with the Guitar Hero : On Tour series or a new Drum Skin that comes with the game . Like previous games , virtual avatars of Taylor Swift , Adam Levine , and the band No Doubt are presented in the game . 
 Band Hero received mixed reviews from journalists . Some considered the game to be an appropriately flavored version of Guitar Hero 5 for the " Top 40 " pop rock hits , while others felt the game was strictly aimed at teenagers . They also contested the cost of the full game , featuring only 65 songs compared with 85 songs in Guitar Hero 5 , and considered if the content would have been better in downloadable form . A day after the game 's release , the band No Doubt sued Activision , citing similar misuse of their avatars as the Kurt Cobain avatar in Guitar Hero 5 .

 The game is functionally similar to the features of Guitar Hero 5 , including bands composed of any combination of four instruments , drop @-@ in / drop @-@ out play , in @-@ song menus to change difficulty and instrument , and additional multiplayer modes compared to Guitar Hero 5 's " Rockfest " . Band Hero also retains the Band Moment and the Band Revival feature from Guitar Hero 5 . Taylor Swift , Adam Levine ( of Maroon 5 ) , and the band No Doubt have been confirmed to be playable avatars in the game . Artists performed motion capture for their in @-@ game avatars . 
 Band Hero also introduced an updated revision of the drum kit that shipped with Guitar Hero World Tour . Many changes were made to address weight and size concerns that made assembly difficult , and the stand 's crossbar was moved to the bottom to improve leg room and allow the bass pedal to be supported by it . The cymbals were changed to a circular shape from the previous triangular design , and the sensitivity of the drums themselves were adjusted . An in @-@ game sensitivity adjustment feature is also supported . In the United States , the new controller was , for a limited time , exclusive to the game and instrument bundles of Band Hero on Wii . The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the controller were released at a later date ; Band Hero bundles for these platforms in the U.S. included the World Tour drum controller . 
 = = = DS version = = = 
 Band Hero for the Nintendo DS features the ability to play the same instruments as the console @-@ based versions . Though the game is compatible with the DS , DS Lite , and DSi , only players on the DS Lite will receive the " full band " experience due to the nature of the hardware extensions for the unit . 
 Guitar and bass parts are played with the same " Guitar Grip " previously created for the Guitar Hero : On Tour series , though this unit will not work on the Nintendo DSi and Nintendo 3DS due to lack of a GBA slot . The gameplay for guitar and bass is considered to be the fourth iteration of the Guitar Hero On Tour design by developers Vicarious Visions , and have further improvements to meet with different strumming styles . 
 A new " drum skin " that fits over the bottom half of the DS unit provides four " pads " for drumming that map to the unit 's directional pad and face buttons ; this design was selected over use of the touch screen due to the inability of the touch screen to recognize near @-@ simultaneous taps , a factor that would have interfered with the drumming experience . The drum skin is limited to the Nintendo DS Lite due to the skin 's form factor . The decision to design towards the DS Lite rather than the newer DSi was due to the much larger volume of DS Lite units that have been sold relative to the DSi . 
 The DS microphone is used for vocal parts . The DS has 30 of the songs from console versions . The game also supports up to four player multiplayer in a similar manner as Guitar Hero 5 using the DS 's local wireless connections , allowing any combination of instruments . However , there is no support for the Nintendo Wi @-@ Fi Connection nor plans for additional downloadable content for the DS game .

 A television advertisement , featuring Taylor Swift , Pete Wentz ( Fall Out Boy ) , Travis Barker ( Blink @-@ 182 ) , and Rivers Cuomo ( Weezer ) , was created for the game by director Brett Ratner in the same manner as previous ads for other recent Guitar Hero games , initially paying tribute to the scene in Risky Business with Tom Cruise dancing in his underwear to the song " Old Time Rock and Roll " . Though it appears as if all four performed together , Wentz stated that Swift performed her parts separately using a green screen to impose her into the footage of the other musicians . 
 A three @-@ song demo was made available on Xbox Live on October 15 , 2009 , and included " <unk> " by Finger Eleven , " Picture to Burn " by Taylor Swift and " Walking on Sunshine " by Katrina and the Waves . The demo was solely the Party Mode , with the three songs playable in random order .

In addition , some on @-@ disc songs from Guitar Hero World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits will be importable into Band Hero and Guitar Hero 5 for an undetermined fee , with music licensing limiting those that can be transferred .

 On release of Band Hero , 35 of the songs from World Tour and 21 from Smash Hits are importable into Band Hero for a small fee ( approximately $ 0 @.@ 10 per song ) , and are treated as downloadable content for the game playable in all game modes . Furthermore , 69 of the 85 tracks from Guitar Hero 5 will be importable into Band Hero . All transferred songs will also be playable in the Guitar Hero 5 and will be free if downloaded in either games . However , Guitar Hero 5 or Band Hero is not backwards @-@ compatible with World Tour nor any other Guitar Hero game . The transfer process requires the player to enter a unique code from the World Tour or Smash Hits manual to be able to <unk> available songs in a pack ( on the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 ) or individual songs ( on the Wii ) that have been updated to include the new features . Players on the Xbox 360 can delete individual songs after downloading the pack . Some songs are not transferable because of licensing issues — not technical issues — according to Bright . Tim Riley , the head of music licensing at Activision , stated that the company will continue to seek licenses for more songs from previous games and downloadable content to be exported into Band Hero , but cannot guarantee that these songs will be licensed for future Guitar Hero games . 
 = = = Downloadable content = = = 
 While Band Hero does not have its own separate library of downloadable content , it supports downloadable content from the Guitar Hero 5 DLC library . In addition , 152 of the 158 available downloadable songs for Guitar Hero World Tour are forward @-@ compatible with Guitar Hero 5 and Band Hero ; the existing content is automatically upgraded to include all features new to these games and was immediately available to players upon release of Band Hero . Downloaded songs can be used in all game modes , provided all participating players have the song , including in the game 's Career mode when players are given the option to select any song to play . The entire Band Hero DLC library is also available in Guitar Hero 5 , and vice versa , so both games embrace the same DLC library . Some DLC songs have specific focus on Band Hero , like the " Celebrity New Years Track Pack " which includes Taylor Swift , Maroon 5 and No Doubt songs , and the " Band Hero Track Pack " with Miley Cyrus , Demi Lovato , and Selena Gomez & the Scene songs . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Band Hero has received mixed to positive reviews from gaming critics . Most recognized the game as having the same feature sets as Guitar Hero 5 , including any benefits or flaws that may come from that . Reviewers praised the reuse of the Guitar Hero 5 features such as the Party Play mode that allows for players to jump in and out , the improved Career mode , and the improved GHTunes . Some identified that the target market of the game appears to be towards teenage girls , such as the featuring of Taylor Swift , the color schemes used in the game , and other parts of the song selection . Reviewers noted that setlist would be the strongest measure of whether players should purchase the game . The reviewers also commented on the smaller setlist , which contains only 65 songs compared to Guitar Hero 5 's 85 . 
 Review did note that the " Top 40 " songs do not always make for challenging songs , as many featured simple chord repetition throughout the song or simply following pre @-@ programmed electronic keyboard or drum beats . However , most songs were found to feature at least one difficult instrument portion that would be fun to play . Reviews also noted that the censoring of songs in order to affirm a family @-@ friendly rating is awkward , such as censoring the word " whiskey " from Don McLean 's " American Pie " ( 8 times ) , and can ruin the enjoyment of some songs . Greg Miller of IGN further noted that these censoring are at odds with the straight @-@ up inclusion of other songs such as " Gasoline " by The Airborne Toxic Event which , Miller claims , is about sex . 
 Some reviews saw Band Hero as a good addition to the Guitar Hero franchise , and pointed out the strength of the game is improved in part due to the ability to import and export songs between Band Hero , Guitar Hero 5 , and content . Justin Haywald of 1UP.com , in consideration of the equivalent nature of featured , considered that players now had a choice of " ' Top 40 ' Band Hero or ' Hard Rock ' [ Guitar Hero 5 ] " skins to select for playing the music on , and positive direction for the series . However , others saw the simple rebranding of the game , and that some may see the product as little more than a " full @-@ price track pack " . 
 The game has sold 596 @,@ 000 units in North America through January 2010 , according to data from NPD Group . Prior to the end of 2009 , Activision had expressed plans to publish a sequel to Band Hero in 2010 . However , as a result of overall decline in music game sales , in part due to the large number of SKUs released by Activision during 2009 , such plans have been shelved , as Activision only plans to release continuing sequels to Guitar Hero and DJ Hero in 2010 . 
 = = = Lawsuit by No Doubt = = = 
 A day following Band Hero 's release , the band No Doubt filed a lawsuit against Activision . In a similar manner as Guitar Hero 5 , where the avatar of Kurt Cobain could be used to play any of the songs in the game and leading to questionable virtual performances , the same was found to be true for the No Doubt avatars in Band Hero . No Doubt 's lawsuit claimed their contract limited their performance to the three songs within the game and that they were never told their avatars would be used in that manner . Activision argued that it believes that the manner of use of the band 's avatars in the game is within the bounds of the contract . Activision subsequently filed a counter @-@ suit against the band , alleging contract breaches ; Activision claimed that it was " publicly known " that in @-@ game characters in the Guitar Hero series , once unlocked , could be used for all game modes , and that No Doubt 's request came well after the game 's code was finalized . Courtney Love , who has expressed an intention to follow legal action for Cobain 's appearance in Guitar Hero 5 , said to NME that she will join No Doubt in their lawsuit against Activision . 
 In April 2010 , the Los Angeles County Superior Court denied Activision 's motion to dismiss No Doubt 's rights of publicity claims under California 's anti @-@ <unk> law . In February 2011 , the 2nd District Court of Appeal upheld the Superior Court 's ruling , allowing No Doubt 's case to proceed against Activision . In May 2012 , the Superior Court denied Activision 's motion for summary judgment , though it also denied a preliminary injunction sought by the band . In October 2012 , on the eve of trial , the case was settled for undisclosed terms . 
 = 2003 Pacific hurricane season = 
 The 2003 Pacific hurricane season was a season to feature no major hurricanes Category 3 or higher since 1977 . It Produced an unusually large number of tropical cyclones which affected Mexico . The most notable cyclones during the year were Hurricanes Ignacio and Marty , which killed 2 and 12 people in Mexico , respectively , and were collectively responsible for about US $ 1 billion ( 2003 USD ) in damage . Three other Pacific storms , two of which were hurricanes , and three Atlantic storms also had a direct impact on Mexico . The only other significant storm of the season was Hurricane Jimena , which passed just to the south of Hawaii , the first storm to directly threaten Hawaii for several years . 
 The season officially started on May 15 , 2003 , in the eastern Pacific Ocean , and on June 1 , 2003 , in the central Pacific , and lasted until November 30 , 2003 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean . The season saw 16 tropical storms form , of which 7 became hurricanes , which is about average . However , this season was the first Pacific hurricane season since 1977 to have no systems become major hurricanes by reaching Category 3 or higher on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane scale .

 = = = Preseason forecasts = = = 
 On June 12 , 2003 , NOAA published a forecast for the East Pacific hurricane season , the first time it had done so . The scientists predicted a 50 % chance of below normal activity this season , due to the expectation that La Niña conditions would develop . La Niña conditions generally restrict tropical cyclone development in the northeast Pacific , which is the opposite of its effect in the Atlantic . 
 On May 19 , 2003 , NOAA published its forecast for the Central Pacific hurricane season . The forecast called for a slightly below @-@ average level of activity in 2003 , due to the same forecast of the onset of La Niña which would later prompt the low forecast for the Eastern Pacific . 
 = = = Seasonal activity = = = 
 There were 16 named storms and 7 hurricanes during the 2003 Pacific hurricane season , which is comparable with the long @-@ term averages . However , there were no major hurricanes ( Category 3 or higher on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane scale ) ; this was the first time this had happened in the eastern Pacific since 1977 , and is well below the long @-@ term average of four . The first hurricane , Ignacio , formed on August 24 . This is the latest formation of the first hurricane of a season recorded in the east Pacific since reliable satellite observation began in 1966 . 
 Whilst the total activity was below average , there was an unusually high number of landfalls in Mexico . A total of eight Pacific and North Atlantic tropical cyclones had a direct impact in Mexico in 2003 , second only to 1971 , when 9 did so . This is well above the long @-@ term average of 4 @.@ 2 Atlantic and east Pacific storms affecting Mexico . Five Pacific storms impacted Mexico , of which Hurricanes Ignacio and Marty both hit the state of Baja California Sur as hurricanes . The combined damage from the two hurricanes totaled about US $ 1 billion ( 2003 USD ) . Two other storms hit mainland Mexico as tropical storms and a third as a tropical depression . Three storms hit Mexico within a very short space of time , the Pacific hurricanes Nora and Olaf , and the Atlantic Tropical Storm Larry . As a result of the flooding caused by these storms , disaster areas were declared in 14 states . 
 Activity in the Central Pacific was below average , with only one tropical depression forming in the basin and one hurricane entering the basin from the east Pacific . In addition , a third system , Tropical Storm Guillermo , weakened to a remnant low just to the east of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility . Although activity was generally low , Hurricane Jimena was the first direct threat to the Hawaiian Islands for several years and a hurricane watch was issued for the island of Hawaii . Jimena passed to the south , but still brought tropical @-@ storm @-@ force gusts and heavy rain to the island . 
 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Tropical Storm Andres = = = 
 A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression on May 19 well to the south of Mexico as it moved west . A good outflow developed and it became a tropical storm the next day , before reaching its peak strength with winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . Increasing shear prevented any further development as the storm moved quickly west @-@ northwest . On May 25 , the shear and a reduction in water temperatures weakened Andres to a tropical depression , and it dissipated soon after . The storm did not approach land . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Blanca = = = 
 Tropical Depression Two @-@ E formed when an organized tropical wave interacted with another disturbance near the southwestern Mexican coast early on June 17 . The storm strengthened and became Tropical Storm Blanca 12 hours later . The storm moved slowly to the west and reached its peak on June 18 with 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) winds . Although Blanca never developed a true eye , at its peak there was a ring of convection resembling one . Under the influence of strong shear from the southeast , Blanca began to weaken and move erratically . The storm degenerated to a remnant low on June 22 and lasted a further two days . There were no effects from Blanca on land . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Carlos = = = 
 Tropical Storm Carlos formed on June 26 from a tropical wave to the south of Mexico . It quickly strengthened as it approached the coast , and early on June 27 Carlos moved ashore in Oaxaca with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) . The storm rapidly deteriorated to a remnant low , which persisted until dissipating on June 29 . Carlos brought heavy rainfall to portions of southern Mexico , peaking at 337 mm ( 13 @.@ 3 in ) in two locations in Guerrero . Throughout its path , the storm damaged about 30 @,@ 000 houses , with a monetary damage total of $ 86 @.@ 7 million pesos ( 2003 MXN , US $ 8 million 2003 USD ) . At least nine people were killed throughout the country , seven due to mudslides and two from river flooding ; there was also a report of two missing fishermen . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Dolores = = = 
 Convection developed within an area of low pressure embedded in a tropical wave as it moved west . The disturbance organized into Tropical Depression Four @-@ E on July 6 well to the south @-@ southwest of the tip of the Baja California Peninsula . It soon strengthened further into Tropical Storm Dolores as it moved to the northwest and reached its peak as a minimal tropical storm with winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . However , wind shear had an adverse effect on Dolores , and it weakened back into a depression 12 hours after becoming a tropical storm . The northwest motion brought it over colder water and it dissipated on July 9 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Enrique = = = 
 On July 10 , a tropical wave formed into Tropical Depression Five @-@ E. The storm became more organized and was named Tropical Storm Enrique the next day at an unusually high latitude . The storm continued to strengthen and at one point was forecast to briefly become a hurricane . This did not occur as the storm reached its peak strength with 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) winds . It maintained this strength before moving over significantly cooler water late on July 12 . Due to the cold water temperatures Enrique rapidly weakened , despite favorable atmospheric conditions . The storm degenerated into a remnant low late on July 13 and continued to move west before dissipating after a further 3 days . Enrique had no effects on land , but there were two ship reports of tropical storm force winds . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Felicia = = = 
 A tropical wave passed over Central America on July 12 and started to become more organized two days later . It formed into a tropical depression on July 17 as it continued to move to the west . The depression became Tropical Storm Felicia the next day and as there was low shear over the system , the NHC predicted that it would become a minimal hurricane . However , the storm remained disorganized and peaked with 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) winds late on July 18 . The storm gradually weakened under increasing shear as it headed west , weakening back to a tropical depression on July 20 . The remnant low entered the central Pacific before dissipating on July 24 well to the east of Hawaii . Felicia had no effect on land . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Guillermo = = = 
 A weak surface low developed within a tropical wave on August 6 and the convection associated with it became isolated from that of the wave . The circulation of the system became better defined and a Tropical Depression , Seven @-@ E , formed early the next day . Although the depression was initially forecast to dissipate quickly , it became more organized as it moved to the west . On August 8 it became Tropical Storm Guillermo and it reached its peak strength with 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) winds that day . It maintained this strength for a full day , until outflow from the developing Tropical Storm Hilda to its east disrupted its convection . The remnant low entered the central Pacific shortly before dissipating on August 13 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Hilda = = = 
 A tropical wave developed persistent thunderstorm activity on August 5 , which soon became more organized , forming into Tropical Depression Eight @-@ E to the south of Cabo San Lucas . An impressive outflow pattern caused the NHC to predict an intensification to hurricane strength , but strong easterly shear affected the system . The depression became Tropical Storm Hilda on August 10 but did not get any stronger than a minimal tropical storm with winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . Hilda moved west @-@ northwest before it moved over colder waters , which caused it to weaken . Low @-@ level flow forced the weakening cyclone westwards and it dissipated on August 13 , having never approached land . 
 = = = Tropical Depression One @-@ C = = = 
 The only tropical cyclone to form in the central Pacific in 2003 developed on August 15 , and resulted from an interaction between remnants of Tropical Storm Guillermo and a non @-@ tropical low . Unfavorable wind shear prevented the development of the depression and weakened as it drifted to the west . It weakened to a remnant low on August 17 and never regained depression strength . The remnant passed just south of Johnston Atoll before it crossed the International Date Line on August 20 . The storm had a minimal effect on the weather of the Hawaiian Islands . 
 = = = Hurricane Ignacio = = = 
 A tropical wave organized into a distinct area of disturbed weather just south of the Mexican port of Manzanillo , Colima , on August 22 and gradually moved to the northwest . It became Tropical Depression Nine @-@ E off Cabo Corrientes in the state of Jalisco two days later and under the influence of favorable atmospheric conditions rapidly strengthened . It was named Tropical Storm Ignacio on August 25 before it peaked as a 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) hurricane on August 26 , the first of the season . Ignacio entered the southern Gulf of California before it made landfall just to the east of La Paz , Baja California Sur . Ignacio weakened overland and dissipated early on August 28 over central Baja California . 
 Due to the storm 's slow movement , rainfall was high and the resulting flooding was severe , and Ignacio was responsible for approximately US $ 21 million of damage . Two rescue workers drowned in the flood waters brought by the storm and some 10 @,@ 000 people were evacuated to shelters . 
 = = = Hurricane Jimena = = = 
 On August 28 , an area of disturbed weather within the Intertropical Convergence Zone developed into Tropical Depression Ten @-@ E , some 1725 miles ( <unk> km ) east of the Hawaiian Islands . The storm rapidly developed over warm ocean waters , gaining an eye shortly before it became Hurricane Jimena on August 29 . The storm moved to the west , entering the central Pacific as it continued to strengthen . After reaching its peak strength with 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) winds 800 miles ( 1300 km ) to the east of Hawaii it began to weaken as a result of increased shear . The storm passed about 120 miles ( 195 km ) to the south of the southern tip of Hawaii on September 1 , just after losing hurricane strength . The storm then moved west , south of the archipelago , becoming a tropical depression on September 3 . The weakening Jimena crossed the International Date Line before dissipating on September 5 . 
 The storm brought 6 to 10 inches ( 150 to 250 mm ) of rain and 11 foot ( 3 @.@ 3 m ) surf to the island of Hawaii . There were also tropical storm force winds recorded on several of the Hawaiian Islands , but there was no significant damage . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Kevin = = = 
 A large low pressure area developed within a tropical wave and organized slowly into Tropical Depression Eleven @-@ E on September 3 south @-@ southwest of the tip of Baja California . The broad wind field prevented rapid intensification and the system reached tropical storm strength on September 4 . Although wind shear was light , Kevin weakened into a depression after just six hours , as it moved over colder waters . On September 6 the system degenerated to a non @-@ convective low pressure area , which managed to survive for four days before finally dissipating . Tropical Storm Kevin had no effects on land . 
 = = = Hurricane Linda = = = 
 Convection began to increase in a tropical wave on September 9 and a few days later a surface low developed . On September 12 it organized into Tropical Depression Twelve @-@ E to the southwest of the Mexican port of Manzanillo , Colima . The cyclone moved to the northwest , becoming a tropical storm on September 14 before reaching its peak strength as a Category 1 hurricane with 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) winds . The National Hurricane Center predicted further strengthening , but this did not occur and Linda weakened back to a tropical storm after just 12 hours as a hurricane . As the storm continued to weaken it turned to the west and then to the southwest , becoming a tropical depression on September 17 . The remnant drifted to the southwest and finally dissipated on September 26 . There were no reports of any effects from this storm . 
 = = = Hurricane Marty = = = 
 A tropical wave moved into the Pacific Ocean on September 10 and the convection associated with it gradually increased . By September 16 , while the system was south @-@ southeast of Cabo San Lucas , it organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen @-@ E. The depression strengthened as it headed towards the Baja California Peninsula , becoming a tropical storm on September 19 and a hurricane two days later . Hurricane Marty reached its peak strength on September 22 , just before it made landfall at Cabo San Lucas , when it was packing winds of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) . After moving over the southern tip of the peninsula Marty moved up the western coast of the Gulf of California , gradually weakening as it did so . The storm weakened to a tropical depression on September 23 and dissipated two days later after meandering over the northern Gulf . 
 Hurricane Marty was the deadliest storm of the 2003 Pacific hurricane season and was responsible for 12 deaths and either damaged or destroyed over 4 @,@ 000 homes . It brought heavy rainfall to the entire region and some rain affected the Southwest United States . A 5 foot ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) storm surge flooded parts of La Paz , Baja California Sur , and sank 35 yachts moored in various ports . Marty was also the costliest east Pacific storm of the year and was responsible for US $ 50 million of damage in western Mexico . 
 = = = Hurricane Nora = = = 
 A tropical wave moved over Central America on September 25 and moved parallel to the south Mexican coast . It became more organized on October 1 and developed into Tropical Depression Fourteen @-@ E to the south of the Baja California Peninsula . It continued to strengthen as it moved northwest in favorable conditions , becoming a tropical storm the next day . On October 4 it became a hurricane and reached its peak that day with 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) winds . Nora made a sharp turn to the east and began to weaken , as the result of the influence of a mid @-@ level trough and the outflow from Hurricane Olaf to the southeast . The cyclone rapidly weakened before it made landfall just north of Mazatlán , Sinaloa , on October 9 . Nora dissipated over land soon after landfall . Hurricane Nora was the strongest storm of the season and brought heavy rain to the state of Sinaloa , but there was no significant damage or casualties . 
 = = = Hurricane Olaf = = = 
 A tropical wave became increasingly organized on October 2 to the south @-@ southeast of Acapulco and developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen @-@ E the next day . The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Olaf six hours after forming as it moved to the northwest in a low shear environment . Olaf reached its peak strength as a minimal hurricane with 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) winds on October 5 and developed a partial eyewall . The storm soon became disorganized and was only a hurricane for a few hours , before turning towards the Mexican coast . Olaf made landfall near Manzanillo , Colima , on October 7 and soon dissipated overland . 
 The storm caused severe flooding in the states of Jalisco and Guanajuato which damaged crops , roads and over 12 @,@ 000 houses . However , there were no deaths as a result of Hurricane Olaf . 
 = = = Hurricane Patricia = = = 
 On October 20 the convection associated with a tropical wave became more organized , and Tropical Depression Sixteen @-@ E formed to the south of Acapulco . It soon became Tropical Storm Patricia and reached hurricane strength on October 21 , as it moved further west . 12 hours later , its winds had increased to 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) and the NHC forecast further strengthening . However , on October 22 , increasing westerly shear caused Patricia to weaken to below hurricane strength . The storm weakened further to a depression on October 25 , and it dissipated the next day , ending the season . Hurricane Patricia had no effects on land .

 The following list of names was used to name storms that formed in the northeast Pacific in 2003 . Names that were not assigned are marked in gray . No names were retired by the World Meteorological Organization , therefore this list was used again in the 2009 season . This is the same list which was used for the 1997 season except for Patricia , which replaced Pauline . The name Patricia was previously used in 1970 and 1974 . 
 For storms that form in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility , encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the International Date Line , all names are used in a series of four rotating lists . The next four names that were slated for use in 2003 are shown below ; however , none of them were used . 
 = Ayers Rock ( band ) = 
 Ayers Rock were an Australian jazz fusion , progressive rock band which formed in August 1973 . Ray Burton ( guitar and vocals ) , Mark Kennedy ( drums ) , and Duncan McGuire ( bass ) , members of Leo de Castro and Friends , left to form the eponymous trio of Burton , McGuire & Kennedy . They added a guitarist , Jimmy Doyle , changed their name to Ayers Rock and invited Col Loughnan ( saxophones and flutes ) to join . The group signed with independent label Mushroom Records in December 1973 . Burton left the following March , and was replaced by Chris Brown ( guitar , vocals ) . With live appearances , coverage in print media and word of mouth the group had a high national profile despite little radio airplay , and journalists praised their musicianship , music , and live energy . 
 The band 's first album , Big Red Rock ( November 1974 ) , received positive reviews and peaked at number 32 on the Australian Kent Music Report album chart . It featured mainstream rock and three longer , instrumental tracks which introduced progressive styles , including jazz fusion . Label owner Michael Gudinski promoted Ayers Rock in Los Angeles and they signed with A & M Records , the first Mushroom Records artists to sign with an international label . The United States release of Big Red Rock in February 1975 was followed by a tour there , later that year . The band played to large crowds , supporting major international artists ( including Bachman – Turner Overdrive ) before 35 @,@ 000 people – the first Australian band to perform in large US stadiums . Ayers Rock were named 1975 Musicians of the Year on RAM 's " New Year 's Honors List " . Kennedy left before their second album , Beyond ( April 1976 , recorded at the Record Plant in Los Angeles ) , was released . The album blended a number of music genres and had a positive critical reception , charting at number 50 . The band toured the US again ; Loughnan remained there , and Ayers Rock temporarily broke up in August 1976 . 
 A year later Doyle and Brown recruited members for a new lineup , including Andy Cowan ( keyboards and vocals ) and Hamish Stuart ( drums ) . In 1980 they released their third album , Hotspell , on their own Red Rock Records label . This album had a soft @-@ rock style , with sophisticated arrangements and featured keyboards . It failed to chart , and the group permanently disbanded in 1981 . Although Ayers Rock 's first two albums were successful in Australia , none of their six singles charted . During their early years ( from 1973 to 1976 ) , the group were praised by local media for their music , stylistic diversity , use of technology , and the energy of their live performances . Ayers Rock received positive reviews in Billboard and Cashbox . Late @-@ 1990s music historians recognised the band 's talent but considered their music over @-@ indulgent at times , failing to bridge the gap between artistic and commercial success . Duncan Kimball of <unk> wrote " that they never really got the chance to reach their full potential . " 
 = = Australian music scene = = 
 Ayers Rock were formed in the Australian pop @-@ music scene of the early 1970s , which included artists in a number of genres : mainstream pop ( Zoot and Liv <unk> ) , blues rock ( Chain ) , heavy rock ( Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs ) , and boogie ( Carson ) . Bands such as <unk> and Madder Lake combined mainstream and progressive rock . Most pop and rock listeners had never heard jazz fusion ; when Ayers Rock incorporated the music into their sets , it was rarely performed by fellow Australian artists . 
 At that time , the Australian music media expressed frustration that few local musicians were successful overseas . Many artists ( such as The Twilights , The Masters Apprentices , The <unk> and Axiom ) had gone to the United Kingdom with little commercial success , and music papers such as Go @-@ Set regularly addressed the situation . The " third wave " of Australian rock , from 1970 to 1975 , saw an increase in pub rock venues in the southern and eastern states .

 Ayers Rock formed in Melbourne in August 1973 . Ray Burton , Mark Kennedy , and Duncan McGuire , members of Leo de Castro and Friends , left in June to form the eponymous trio of Burton McGuire & Kennedy . Burton had played guitar with the Dave Bridge Quartet , the Delltones and the Executives , and co @-@ wrote " I Am Woman " ( May 1972 ) in the United States with Australian singer Helen Reddy . McGuire , on bass , was a recording engineer , producer , and a member of Australian groups since the late 1950s ( including the Phantoms , the Epics , the Questions – which later became Doug Parkinson in Focus ; see Doug Parkinson – and King Harvest ) . Kennedy , on drums , had played in Spectrum , Doug Parkinson in Focus , King Harvest , and Leo de Castro and Friends . 
 Burton McGuire & Kennedy were joined in August 1973 by Jimmy Doyle on guitar . Doyle had worked for the Delltones and Dig Richards , was musical director for pianist Winifred Atwell on her Australian tours , and was a session player in Sydney on Neil Sedaka 's 1969 album Workin ' on a Groovy Thing . In September 1973 Burton McGuire & Kennedy changed their name to Ayers Rock , using the European name for the sandstone rock formation sacred to local indigenous Australians . The group were nicknamed " the Rock " by the Australian press . Since 1993 the sandstone monolith has been called by its <unk> name , Uluru . 
 Doyle had worked sporadically for several years with multi @-@ instrumentalist and arranger Col Loughnan , who joined London @-@ based blues @-@ pop group Kala in late 1972 . Doyle invited his former bandmate to join in October 1973 . With Ayers Rock , Loughnan played saxophones , flute , and electric piano . He had begun his career as lead vocalist for the Crescents in 1958 , joining the Delltones in 1962 . Loughnan diversified into arranging and playing jazz tenor saxophone with the Daly @-@ Wilson Big Band . By December 1973 Ayers Rock had signed with Mushroom Records , which released their first single – " Rock ' n Roll Fight ( Going On ) " , one of the label 's early records . Mushroom Records co @-@ owner Michael Gudinski became their manager . 
 In January 1974 Ayers Rock performed at the Sunbury Pop Festival and " Morning Magic " ( written by Burton ) appeared on the live album , Highlights of Sunbury ' 74 Part 2 , released by Mushroom Records later that year . In March Burton returned to the US and was replaced on guitar and lead vocals by Chris Brown , formerly of Python Lee Jackson . Loughnan and Brown had played together in London as members of Kala . The band traced their origins to rock or pop bands from Sydney , except for Kennedy ( who was from Melbourne ) . 
 = = = 1974 – 75 : Big Red Rock = = = 
 In 1974 Ayers Rock began recording their debut album , Big Red Rock , at Festival Records ' 24 @-@ track studio in Sydney . They were dissatisfied with the sound , which failed to capture their music 's " live " essence , and recorded it live @-@ in @-@ the @-@ studio at Armstrong 's in Melbourne that September . Kennedy told Margaret MacIntyre of Rolling Stone Australia , " Doing the album live was an experiment really and it seemed to work . " Big Red Rock , released in November , peaked at number 32 on the Kent Music Report album chart . The album had " a more jazz @-@ rock edge " and its single , " Lady Montego " ( written by McGuire ) , was a new version of a song originally performed by Leo de Castro and Friends . According to Juke Magazine , " the single lifted to push the album , ' Lady Montego ' ... received three weeks airplay and was then dumped . " " Lady Montego " was Ayers Rock 's most @-@ aired single in Australia , and Kennedy said : " Without AM radio support you can 't sell too well in this country . " Juke called their songs " lyrically banal " but said the group compensated with " sheer talent " , instrumentally and electronically . 
 A song from Ayers Rock 's live set was a cover of " Boogie Woogie Waltz " , written by Joe Zawinul of Weather Report for the US group 's album <unk> ( April 1973 ) . In November 1974 Loughnan temporarily stopped performing live due to back pain , and the band continued with four members . He returned after surgery , and contemporary photos and video show him playing sitting down during his convalescence . 
 Manager and label owner Gudinski visited the US in December 1974 to promote his recording artists , including Skyhooks , Daddy Cool , and Madder Lake , to major labels there . At that time only Ayers Rock were successful , with Gudinski signing them to A & M Records within days . He told Tony Wilson of The Sun , " Jerry Moss , the president of A & M Records USA , flipped when he heard it , so A & M will release it ( Big Red Rock ) world @-@ wide . " This was a surprise to the Australian media , since many other artists were more commercially successful locally than Ayers Rock . Skyhooks were Australia 's most popular band ; their first album ( Living in the 70 's , released in October 1974 ) sold 226 @,@ 000 units , the best @-@ selling album by a local artist in Australia to date . However , Living in the 70 's was rejected by A & M and not released outside Australia . Ayers Rock were the first Mushroom Records artists to sign a recording contract with an international label . From the mid @-@ 1970s , and into the 1990s , Mushroom were successful with many other artists including Split Enz , Kylie Minogue , and Yothu Yindi , turning the label into Australia 's largest independent record company . 
 In January 1975 the group performed at the fourth Sunbury Pop Festival , and Big Red Rock and " Lady Montego " were released in the US on 28 February . On 20 April , they performed at a benefit concert for Bangladesh at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl with the La De Das , Jim Keays , AC / DC , Phil Manning , Daddy Cool , Toulouse & Too Tight , the Dingoes , and the Moir Sisters . 
 From July to September , they promoted Big Red Rock in the US and Vancouver . The band played to an audience of 35 @,@ 000 at a stadium concert in Seattle , supporting Bachman – Turner Overdrive , on 27 July and opened for Status Quo , the J. Geils Band , Lynyrd Skynyrd , and Nils Lofgren . According to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane , " Ayers Rock was the first Australian band to play to massive crowds on the USA touring circuit " , years before fellow Australians the Little River Band , AC / DC , and Air Supply made their first US tours . 
 = = = 1975 – 76 : Beyond = = = 
 At the end of their US tour in September 1975 Ayers Rock recorded their second album , Beyond , at the Record Plant in Los Angeles . The album , produced by the group and John Stronach , received a $ 60 @,@ 000 advance from A & M Records . 
 On 18 October , The Sun reported that McGuire had left the band . At a reception when Ayers Rock returned to Australia , he said : " The pressure of the tour was just too much . We were on the road all the time and I guess I wasn 't as strong as the rest of the band . When we got into the studio I had the shakes . I mean I was playing the right notes , but not in the right places . " To finish the album McGuire 's friend Les Young played some of the bass guitar parts , and American Jeff Castleman played bass on " <unk> " . Young also briefly played live with Ayers Rock in Australia , including an October 1975 show at the State Theatre in Sydney . McGuire returned to the group at the Dallas Brooks Hall on 21 October 1975 , to warm applause . 
 In late November Ayers Rock appeared at the final Reefer Cabaret event , at Ormond Hall in Prahran . The performance was recorded for a double album , A @-@ Reefer @-@ <unk> ( 1976 ) . In January 1976 , Rock Australia Magazine named Ayers Rock Musicians of the Year for 1975 in their " New Year 's Honors List " . Kennedy left to join Marcia Hines ' backing band in February 1976 , and they reportedly married late in the decade . In Ayers Rock , Kennedy was temporarily replaced by Doug Gallacher . In April 1976 Beyond was released in Australia and the US , making the Kent Music Report top 50 . Two singles from the album were released : " Little Kings " ( October 1975 ) and " Song for Darwin " ( May 1976 ) , but neither charted . 
 The US cover for Beyond features a rock in the distance , which becomes the face of an Aboriginal man with eyes closed when the cover is rotated 90 ° to the right . Artist and Mushroom Records art director Ian McCausland also designed The Rolling Stones ' 1973 Australian tour poster . The album cover illustrates a central principle of Aboriginal spirituality : the deep connection between the land and the Aboriginal peoples . In an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission publication , " Our Land Our Life " , S. Knight described the Aboriginal position : " We don 't own the land , the land owns us . The land is my mother , my mother is the land . Land is the starting point to where it all began . " According to the Australian government webpage , The Dreaming : " Once the ancestor spirits had created the world , they changed into trees , the stars , rocks , watering holes or other objects . These are sacred places of Aboriginal culture . " 
 In May 1976 Gallacher was replaced by Russell Dunlop , formerly of Aesop 's Fables , Levi Smith 's <unk> , <unk> , Mother Earth , and the Johnny Rocco Band . In an interview with Greg Kelton of The Advertiser , Loughnan outlined the band 's future : " If Beyond doesn 't make it for us in the States we might as well forget all about Ayers Rock . " From May to July they toured the US again , " only <unk> [ ing ] limited success overseas . " After the tour Dunlop and Loughnan left , and on 25 August Mushroom Records announced that Ayers Rock had broken up after Loughnan decided to remain in the US to study . Brown , Doyle , and McGuire indicated that they would revive the group with new members .

 In 1977 Brown and Doyle re @-@ formed Ayers Rock with Bermuda @-@ born Keith Caisey on percussion , Joe Tattersall ( formerly of Healing Force and the Barry <unk> Band ) on drums , and John Young ( formerly of Leo de Castro 's eponymous group ) on bass guitar . By 1978 Brown , Caisey and Doyle were joined by Andy Cowan ( formerly of Madder Lake ) on keyboards and vocals , Steve Hogg ( formerly of Bakery ) on bass guitar , and Hamish Stuart on drums . In March 1980 the band released another single , " On the Avenue " , followed in May by their third LP – Hotspell – on their own Red Rock Records ( distributed by RCA Records ) . Recorded at the Music Farm in Byron Bay , it was engineered by former member Duncan McGuire . 
 In The Canberra Times , Luis Feliu noted the " new @-@ sounding " Ayers Rock and their " laid @-@ back " style . There had been a major change in songwriting , with Brown contributing less ; Cowan was the most active ( writing five tracks ) , and Stuart and Doyle co @-@ wrote two . Doyle , with no writing credits on previous albums , wrote " On the Road " ( which was included in the band 's live sets from 1978 ) . Jillian Burt of Juke Magazine described it as " reminiscent of the cool , calm , <unk> that typifies Steely Dan " . Hotspell featured soft @-@ rock songs with sophisticated , keyboard @-@ centred arrangements . 
 According to Feliu 's review of the album and a July 1980 performance in Sydney , Ayers Rock were " once Australia 's hottest progressive rock " group . Feliu wrote that most of the audience seemed to appreciate the band 's new direction : " the capacity audience showed hearty approval ... probably old allegiance , and only a few comments of dissatisfaction , like ' boring ' , were heard , then that was at the bar up the back " . Hotspell did not reach the Kent Music Report album top 100 , and has not been released on CD . In July 1981 the group released a final single , " Lies " , before disbanding later that year .

 In late 1974 Ayers Rock members Brown , McGuire , Kennedy and Loughnan played on several tracks of Jim Keays ' debut solo album , The Boy from the Stars . At the January 1975 Sunbury Pop Festival Keays performed most of the album live , with three Ayers Rock members ( Brown , McGuire and Kennedy ) joining the ensemble to record " Nothing Much Left " and " Urantia " . Returning to the US , Burton was a session player for Billy Joel and Jimmy Webb and wrote " Best Friend " for the film Airport 1975 ( 1974 ) . In 1976 , he formed the Ray Burton Band with Rex Bullen , Terry Gascoine , Steve Hogg and Tim Piper . From 1977 to 1980 , McGuire was bass guitarist for the Southern Star Band with Doug Parkinson on vocals , Tommy Emmanuel on guitar and Kennedy on drums . In 1978 Burton released a solo album , Dreamers and <unk> , which spawned the singles " Too Hard to Handle " and " Paddington Green " . After touring with Crossfire in 1979 , he returned to the US as a songwriter . 
 Cowan was later a member of Kevin Borich Express , Ian Moss Band and Renée Geyer Band before pursuing a solo music career . Georgie Fame 's album No Worries ( 1988 ) included Ayers Rock alumni Loughnan , Doyle , and Dunlop . McGuire died in July 1989 of a brain tumour . During the late 1980s , Hogg formed The Rhythm Snakes with Clayton Black on drums , Howie Smallman on harmonica , and Bob Thorne on guitar . In 1989 , Hogg assembled a studio band to record a solo album with Thorne , Mark Alderman on harmonica , Ian Ironside on drums , Bob Patient on piano , and Bernie Payne on saxophone . Steve Hogg died on 20 July 1990 and his album , Various Fools & Vices , was released in 1992 . 
 In 1993 , Kennedy drummed for The Blazing Salads with Brian <unk> , Glenn Shorrock , Rex Goh , and Kirk <unk> . Hamish Stuart played drums on Chris Abrahams and Melanie Oxley 's 1998 album , Jerusalem Bay . Doyle died on 5 May 2006 , and on 28 May the Jim Doyle Tribute Concert was played at the Basement in Sydney . Musicians included Renée Geyer , Billy Field , bandmate Loughnan , and Barry <unk> , with proceeds benefiting Doyle 's family . Dunlop died on 16 May 2009 ; he had collapsed after drumming at his son 's wedding in Sydney . As of 2015 , Loughnan is a lecturer in jazz saxophone at the University of Sydney 's Conservatorium of Music and has been a member of its Jazz Faculty since 1978 . In 2007 he released a solo album , Ellen St.

 Although Ayers Rock 's music is described as jazz @-@ rock , this is a simplification . In the 2011 radio documentary " Rare Collections " , presented by David and Jordie Kilby on Jazz @-@ Rock in Australia for 666 ABC Canberra , Loughnan described other Mushroom Records artists as playing pop rock styles and Ayers Rock playing some jazz : " We were a bit of both " . Critics called Big Red Rock 's side one its " song " side and side two its " jazz " side . " Lady Montego " , " Talkin ' ' Bout You " , " Goin ' Home " and " Nostalgic Blues " are rock songs ; the first three were written by McGuire , and the fourth by Brown . 
 Loughnan 's " Crazy Boys " highlighted the band 's <unk> side , with working @-@ class men talking at a hamburger shop ; each used local slang or spoke in a stereotypical ethnic accent , poking fun at Australians from a variety of backgrounds . At one point " Hey , listen mate , give me one ' <unk> ' , please , hold the bacon , please " is heard ; Michael Gudinski , whose parents are Jewish immigrants , does not eat pork and went along with the joke . Another voice mentions " Dr. <unk> , the Greek gynaecologist " . More slang is heard later in the track , including " Who yer sayin ’ that to , yer drongo ? " 
 Although " Crazy Boys " has two lines of lyrics , most of the track is instrumental . Described by a Juke Magazine reviewer as " free form jazz " , it features solos by Brown , Doyle , and Loughnan and heavily @-@ processed guitars , electric saxophone , and vocals . Asked about the group 's use of electronics by <unk> <unk> of RAM , Loughnan answered : " You 've got to be able to use them well in order to sound good . We use them to colour the sounds as much as possible . " 
 The title track , Loughnan 's " Big Red Rock " , is an eight @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minute instrumental described by Juke Magazine as " expertly capturing the stark loneliness and cosmic tranquility one gets standing before their namesake rock " . According to Loughnan , the atmosphere they wanted to create was " that spacey sort of feeling — like desert [ ... ] and we wanted to get the sound of the didgeridoo — which we did electronically " . Doyle imitated a didgeridoo by playing guitar with a wah @-@ wah pedal . Tony Catterall of The Canberra Times praised " Big Red Rock " , saying that it " suggests the huge expanse of the outback , then takes you [ ... ] to the Aboriginal secrets [ ... ] [ and evokes ] the power surrounding the area [ of Uluru ] in a burst of truly inspired musicianship " . 
 Gil <unk> of The Sydney Morning Herald called the album " heavily accented towards jazz . " It has changing moods , with quiet moments which are " eerie , <unk> , and evocative . " Aboriginal clapsticks and the imitation didgeridoo allude to the indigenous character of Uluru and the surrounding area . Another section is double @-@ tempo jazz fusion with guitar and saxophone solos , complemented by a rhythm section driving to a crescendo . The section concludes with a rapid <unk> ( slowing of tempo ) to another gentle phase . Changes in tempo and volume are heard throughout the title track , in contrast to disco ( featuring one tempo and volume , which was becoming more popular ) . 
 Like Big Red Rock , the vastness of rural and outback landscapes were reflected in the artwork and music of Beyond . According to a review by Forester in The Age , the band and album have " titles to suggest space , time and distance " and some tracks had an " indigenous appeal " . The lead track 's title , " <unk> " , translates into English as " beyond " . In April 1976 Loughnan , who wrote the song , said in a TV Times interview : " The aborigines have had a raw deal in the past . The song expresses the hope that they get better treatment in the future " . " <unk> ( beyond ) " begins with clapsticks , log drum , imitation didgeridoo , and sounds evocative of indigenous singing . 
 This combination creates sounds similar to indigenous Australian music , which later segues into a European style before returning to its original theme . The overall effect is a fusion of indigenous Australian music , rock , and improvisational jazz by European Australians , before indigenous rock artists Yothu Yindi and No Fixed Address created their own fusions of indigenous and rock music . 
 Beyond featured a 23 @-@ piece string section , arranged and conducted by Loughnan , on " Place to Go " , " Song for Darwin " and " Angel in Disguise " . Loughnan had originally written " Angel in Disguise " years before for his wife , expanding it into an instrumental . According to Derek Johnson 's RAM review , " The violin tones and guitar sounds are particularly well produced , dissolving into each other one moment , separating and circling around each other the next . " 
 = = = Airplay = = = 
 Ayers Rock 's treatment by Australian radio stations during the 1970s was related to the popularity of AM . Unlike the US , which had a vibrant FM radio scene , in 1976 Australia only had ABC FM and a few community FM stations which primarily played classical music . Commercial AM stations , playing pop and rock music , dominated the local airwaves . The group established their reputation with live performances , exposure in print media , and word of mouth , with minimal Australian radio promotion . 
 Kennedy told a Juke interviewer , " Radio airplay has never happened for us here — except <unk> and the occasional Album Shows " . Australian Broadcasting Corporation ( ABC ) youth @-@ oriented AM radio station <unk> was limited to Sydney during the 1970s , with poor reception in some areas . The US attitude toward the band 's music was different ; according to Greg Kelton of The Advertiser , Beyond had " been played by about 50 radio stations in the ( U.S. ) . ' It is being played on two [ stations ] in Australia ' , said Jimmy Doyle . "

 Ayers Rock began incorporating rock @-@ jazz fusion into their sets , increasing the jazz aspect of their music . In his review of a concert on 19 October 1975 , Paul Gardiner wrote for Rolling Stone : " Big Red Rock was still tied quite closely to existing American styles . " According to Gardiner , at the State Theatre " evidence " of jazz @-@ rock " came through loud and clear " . This was their first major Australian concert after their first US tour and recording sessions . 
 The group were fundamentally a high @-@ volume rock band . In the smoke @-@ filled bar of Martinis in Carlton , Juke Magazine collected a vox populi of the " packed to the rafters " audience . One person said , " I don 't mind a bit of volume with my improvisation but this is so goddamn heavy . " Gardiner 's review described the group 's live show : 
 The band ... have cut their teeth on pure rock and roll and have , [ as of ] Ayers Rock , moved on to what amounts to a rock @-@ jazz fusion . The inversion of the term is becoming important ; unlike the bands to which they are compared in America , which have all lived and breathed jazz in its purer , more traditional forms , ... [ the ] Rock is made up of rock musicians . 
 In a Rolling Stone interview by Margaret MacIntyre , Kennedy explained : " Ayers Rock was getting a live response that , to speak for myself , I hadn 't seen happen with a crowd ... for a long time " . In the same interview , Doyle described the key to their success : " This band is going somewhere ... it 's not the same thing every night , unlike many bands , the arrangements change . " Reviewers were enthusiastic about the band 's performances ; according to Gardiner , " The impression they now generate on stage is one of total energy ... energy which sets them apart . " Juke Magazine called them " a band that could reward its audiences with ( the ) sheer exhilaration of seeing real master musicians ... taking their audiences to virgin territory that other explorers had only dreamed about . " 
 <unk> <unk> of RAM focussed on another aspect : 
 Unlike many groups they were able to capture the ethereal quality of their recorded sound on stage ... On being asked how live gigs compared to studio work , they all declared that the straight atmosphere of the studio was too clinical .

 Big Red Rock received positive reviews in Australia and the US . The Canberra Times quoted a Cashbox review praising their music which ended : " It was something different and something beautiful . " Billboard magazine gave the album a good review , saying that it featured " excellent sax work throughout and top @-@ notch lead guitar and drum work " . Australian reviewers called the album " an extremely good record , well worth owning " , " a classic record in Australian rock " and " an inspiring success " . 
 Critical response to their second album , Beyond , was generally positive . Sean Hanrahan wrote for the Melbourne Sunday Press : " Beyond to me stands as something of a crowning achievement for a band that has already been described as the high @-@ water mark in Australian rock . " According to Pat Bowring of the Melbourne Sun , " it is one of the best records from an Australian band " and " better than ... Big Red Rock . " The band emphasised that their music was " essentially Australian " , despite being recorded in Los Angeles , and critics noted their music 's Australian character . Tony Catterall of The Canberra Times wrote that the group " has absorbed its influences so well that they 're almost unrecognisable in the final product . And into this synthesis the band has infused some things peculiarly Australian . "

 In February 1998 Billboard 's Christie Eliezer interviewed Gudinski , he recalled that signing Ayers Rock had " allowed the band to tour the US and record their second album there . " He explained that they " were a fantastic jazz @-@ fusion band , a real <unk> 's band , but ultimately they didn 't have that something unique to cross over . " In his 1999 encyclopaedia Dreams , Fantasies , and Nightmares From Far Away Lands , American author Vernon Joynson called Big Red Rock " an excellent example of jazz rock fusion Australian style . The musicianship is of high quality although it tends to become a little over @-@ indulgent in places " . According to Joynson the album had " radio friendly " material and three tracks " filled with fine virtuoso guitar and saxophone " , but despite being " quite a popular live act , [ Ayers Rock 's ] recordings were hampered by a dilemma over whether to opt for a more serious pursuit of expanding the horizons or for a commercial sound " . 
 On <unk> in 2006 , Duncan Kimball wrote : " The group 's relatively short lifespan and small catalogue meant that they never really got the chance to reach their full potential . " According to Ian McFarlane in his 1999 Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop , the members of Ayers Rock " were seen as ' musician 's musicians ' . The band issued a series of technically proficient recordings , but in the long run any quest for commercial acceptance was marred by the seriousness of the music " . In December 2011 , Jordie Kilby called Big Red Rock " a great record ; quite an influential ( album ) ... now one that 's held in quite high regard . "

 = Cleveland Railway ( England ) = 
 The Cleveland Railway was a railway line in north @-@ east England running from Normanby Jetty on the River Tees , near Middlesbrough , via Normanby and then via Guisborough through the Eston Hills , to Loftus in East Cleveland . It carried minerals from numerous iron ore mines along its route to the River Tees for shipment to Tyneside and elsewhere . The line was jointly proposed by the West Hartlepool Harbour and Railway ( WHH & R ) , who provided half its capital , together with various landowners . The WHH & R lay on the north bank of the Tees , to which it had a cross @-@ river connection via a jetty at Normanby . 
 The Cleveland Railway was built as a freight railway and provided no passenger services during its brief existence as an independently owned railway . It was built in a number of stages , bypassing the centre of Guisborough , and opened in November 1861 . Its construction was repeatedly held up by disputes with its main rival , the Stockton and Darlington Railway , which attempted unsuccessfully to use all means at its disposal to maintain its rail monopoly south of the Tees . However , the Cleveland Railway remained independent only until 1865 , when the company and its rivals were bought out by the North Eastern Railway ( NER ) . The new management linked the line with an existing coastal railway via Saltburn , running north of the Eston Hills , and closed the line west of Guisborough in 1873 after only twelve years of service , though part of the line continued in service until 1966 as a freight route for a brickworks and carried passengers to Eston between 1902 and 1929 . The NER constructed four passenger stations at the eastern end of the line in the 1870s . These were closed between 1958 – 1964 along with the section of the line from Guisborough to Brotton , but the easternmost part of the line is still in use today as a mineral railway . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins of the line = = = 
 The construction of the line was prompted by the need of mine owners around Guisborough and East Cleveland to transport their iron ore to the River Tees . Guisborough was already served by the Middlesbrough and Guisborough Railway ( M & GR ) , a subsidiary of the Stockton and Darlington ( S & D ) , which had built a line ( opened in 1854 ) running along the south of the valley in which Guisborough sits . However , the line was an inconveniently long distance from the lucrative iron ore mines in the north of the valley , along the south flank of the Eston Hills , and provided no connection at all for mines east of Guisborough . The M & GR had been built by a group of industrialists based in Stockton and Darlington who used it to service their own mines , deliberately avoiding the estates of their rivals . It only provided a minimal passenger service to Middlesbrough – one train a day each way – and the line had originally not even been planned to have a passenger station in Guisborough . 
 The M & GR was unpopular with local people and mine owners who saw it as a would @-@ be monopolist that served narrow commercial interests rather than the wider public good . During Parliamentary discussions into the Cleveland Railway 's proposed route , a Select Committee of the House of Commons was told that the M & GR was " unwilling to give facility for people carrying traffic not connected with the furnaces with which they are connected . " The M & GR 's attitude aroused strong local resentment . When one of those testifying to the Select Committee was asked what the local landowners would think of a new railway independent of the S & D , he replied that " they would all jump at having such a proposal made to them . " 
 The West Hartlepool Harbour and Railway ( WHH & R ) and a number of landowners struck an agreement to construct a line from the Tees at Cargo Fleet via Normanby , Upsall and Guisborough to Skinningrove , with connecting links and branches to Staithes and Skelton @-@ in @-@ Cleveland . The line would connect to the WHH & R 's own route north of the river via a crossing of the Tees . Several local landowners through which the proposed line ran were key to the scheme – Captain Thomas Chaloner of Guisborough , J.T. Wharton of Skelton Castle , Anthony Lax Maynard of Skinningrove and Ralph Ward Jackson of Greatham Hall , Normanby . Ward Jackson , who was the chairman of the WHH & R , was the driving force behind the project and envisaged making West Hartlepool into the industrial heart of Teesside . 
 The construction of the line was strongly opposed by the S & D , which put forward a rival proposal that led to a Parliamentary enquiry . The two companies each had part of their schemes accepted and part rejected . The Ward Jackson group was allowed to build a railway east from Guisborough to Skinningrove with a branch at Slapewath to reach the mine at Skelton . They were not permitted to build their own separate line to Middlesbrough and had to rely instead on the M & GR for their connection to the Tees . The S & D was allowed to build an extension from Redcar to Saltburn but was not allowed to build a new bridge across the Tees . An Act permitting the construction of the railway was passed in July 1858 . The company was capitalised with £ 120 @,@ 000 , half of which came from the WHH & R , with Ward Jackson as its first chairman . 
 = = = Extension of the line to Normanby = = = 
 Ward Jackson continued to seek independence from the M & GR and put forward a fresh proposal in 1859 to extend the line from Guisborough to the Tees at Cargo Fleet , so that the increasing demand for iron ore shipments to Tyneside could more easily be met . The S & D again opposed it . Although the House of Commons unanimously approved the Cleveland Extension Bill , it was rejected by the House of Lords . However , this left the door open for a private railway on the lands owned by Ward Jackson and his supporters . They began to construct it in 1860 under the auspices of the " Upsall , Normanby and <unk> Railway " . Once again , the S & D opposed it , this time on the grounds that the new line had to cross the S & D 's Redcar branch line , but it eventually gave permission for the construction of a bridge to cross its line . 
 A more serious problem was raised by the need to construct a new river crossing at the end of the line in Normanby . The WHH & R had sought to build a bridge across the Tees at that point but had been blocked by the Tees Conservancy Commission , at the prompting of the S & D. The WHH & R instead resolved to build a jetty that would enable loaded iron ore wagons to be transported across the river on barges . The S & D used its influence with the Commissioners to stop the jetty as well . They undertook legal action in the Court of Chancery to stop it but construction proceeded regardless . The dispute led to violent clashes between the two sides on 10 September 1860 in an event dubbed the " Battle of the Tees " , when Tees Conservancy barges sent to blockade the jetty were forcibly removed by West Hartlepool steam tugs . The police had to intervene to restore order . The WHH & R was the clear winner of the confrontation and was able to complete its jetty . 
 The line was substantially completed by the spring of 1861 . It consisted of two linked private railways running through the estates of Ward Jackson and Captain Chaloner of Guisborough . A bridge was constructed in March 1861 to carry Chaloner 's section of the line over the M & GR just outside Guisborough station , bypassing the town to connect with the Cleveland Railway 's existing eastbound line to Skinningrove . A fresh Act of Parliament , the Cleveland Railway Act , was passed in July 1861 to authorise the Cleveland Railway Company to operate the new line . Although the S & D was still vehemently opposed , Parliament had by now tired of the disputes between the companies and passed the Act over the objections of the S & D. 
 The line was opened on 23 November 1861 , with a total length of 13 miles ( 21 km ) running from Skelton Mine to Normanby Jetty . Crossing the gorge at Slapewath on the eight @-@ arched Waterfall Viaduct , which still stands today , it skirted the south @-@ west of Guisborough and crossed Chapel Beck on wooden viaducts . From there it ran on a nearly straight embankment across the fields west of Guisborough before curving northwards to Normanby through a gap in the Eston Hills . Branch lines and tramways connected the line to a number of mines along its route . It had no passenger stations and did not offer any passenger services , despite the poor connections from Guisborough that had caused so much discontent with the M & GR . 
 = = = Mergers , onward connections and closures = = = 
 Financial irregularities at the WHH & R led in 1862 to the company suffering severe financial difficulties , resulting in the resignation of Ward Jackson from the boards of the WHH & R and the Cleveland Railway . Parliament refused to authorise further contributions from the WHH & R to the Cleveland Railway . Nonetheless , funds were raised to construct new extensions via Boosbeck and Loftus . 
 The Cleveland Railway , the M & GR and the S & D were all taken over in 1865 by the North Eastern Railway ( NER ) . The new management authorised the construction of a link from Saltburn ( which the S & D had reached in 1861 ) via Skelton to the Cleveland Railway 's route at Brotton , forking south to reach Guisborough . This connection , completed in 1872 , provided a new connection between Teesside and the East Cleveland mines , running north of the Eston Hills . Further capacity was provided by doubling the tracks on the line running east of Guisborough . This made the former Cleveland Railway 's line west of Guisborough redundant and it was closed in 1873 after only twelve years of service , though the parallel MG & R line to Middlesbrough remained open for a further 90 years . 
 Although the old Cleveland Railway had not provided any passenger services , during the 1870s the NER built a number of stations at the eastern end of the line . Passenger services began from Brotton , Skinningrove and Loftus in 1875 , plus Boosbeck in 1878 . The tortuous history of the Cleveland Railway had a lasting effect on the provision of rail services to Guisborough . It did not at any time offer a passenger service to the town , leaving that instead to the M & GR , which provided only a single @-@ platform station at the end of its line into the town . This line was bypassed by the Cleveland Railway en route to Skinningrove . After the westbound Cleveland Railway was closed , the eastbound line was joined with the M & GR line , leaving Guisborough railway station at the end of a spur . Trains thus had to reverse out of the station before continuing along the line to Loftus . It remained this way until the line was closed in 1964 . 
 = = Cleveland Railway today = = 
 The east end of the Cleveland Railway , from Loftus to Brotton plus the connection to the Tees Valley Line west of Saltburn , is still in use as a mineral railway serving <unk> Mine . There are no passenger services . The short connection from the Tees Valley Line to Normanby Jetty survived until 1966 as the Normanby Branch of the Tees Valley Line , serving the Normanby brickworks and Eston railway station . It is now a public footpath , the South Bank Walkway , which links Flatts Lane Country Park to South Bank . The middle section of the line from Normanby to Guisborough is in private ownership or has been built on , though the former railway 's embankment can still be clearly seen running alongside the A171 Middlesbrough Road . The section from Guisborough to Slapewath has been converted into a public footpath , the Guisborough Branch Walkway .

 = Astrology and science = 
 Astrology consists of a number of belief systems that hold that there is a relationship between astronomical phenomena and events or descriptions of personality in the human world . Astrology has been rejected by the scientific community as having no explanatory power for describing the universe . Scientific testing of astrology has been conducted , and no evidence has been found to support the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions . 
 Where astrology has made falsifiable predictions , it has been falsified . The most famous test was headed by Shawn Carlson and included a committee of scientists and a committee of astrologers . It led to the conclusion that natal astrology performed no better than chance . Astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin claimed to have found statistical support for " the Mars effect " in the birth dates of athletes , but it could not be replicated in further studies . The organisers of later studies claimed that Gauquelin had tried to influence their inclusion criteria for the study by suggesting specific individuals be removed . It has also been suggested , by Geoffrey Dean , that the reporting of birth times by parents ( before the 1950s ) may have caused the apparent effect . 
 Astrology has not demonstrated its effectiveness in controlled studies and has no scientific validity , and as such , is regarded as pseudoscience . There is no proposed mechanism of action by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth that does not contradict well @-@ understood , basic aspects of biology and physics . 
 = = Introduction = = 
 The majority of professional astrologers rely on performing astrology @-@ based personality tests and making relevant predictions about the <unk> 's future . Those who continue to have faith in astrology have been characterised as doing so " in spite of the fact that there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs , and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary " . Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson commented on astrological belief , saying that " part of knowing how to think is knowing how the laws of nature shape the world around us . Without that knowledge , without that capacity to think , you can easily become a victim of people who seek to take advantage of you " . 
 The continued belief in astrology despite its lack of credibility is seen as one demonstration of low scientific literacy . 
 = = Historical relationship with astronomy = = 
 The foundations of the theoretical structure used in astrology originate with the Babylonians , although widespread usage did not occur till the start of the Hellenistic period after Alexander the great swept through Greece . It was not known to the Babylonians that the constellations are not on a celestial sphere and are very far apart . The appearance of them being close is illusory . The exact demarcation of what a constellation is , is cultural , and varied between civilisations . Ptolemy 's work on astronomy was driven to some extent by the desire , like all astrologers of the time , to easily calculate the planetary movements . Early western astrology operated under the ancient Greek concepts of the <unk> and microcosm ; and thus medical astrology related what happened to the planets and other objects in the sky to medical operations . This provided a further motivator for the study of astronomy . While still defending the practice of astrology , Ptolemy acknowledged that the predictive power of astronomy for the motion of the planets and other celestial bodies ranked above astrological predictions . 
 During the Islamic Golden Age , astronomy was funded so that the astronomical parameters , such as the eccentricity of the sun 's orbit , required for the Ptolemaic model could be calculated to a sufficient accuracy and precision . Those in positions of power , like the Fatimid Caliphate vizier in 1120 , funded the construction of observatories so that astrological predictions , fuelled by precise planetary information , could be made . Since the observatories were built to help in making astrological predictions , few of these observatories lasted long due to the prohibition against astrology within Islam , and most were torn down during or just after construction . 
 The clear rejection of astrology in works of astronomy started in 1679 , with the yearly publication La <unk> des temps . Unlike the west , in Iran , the rejection of heliocentrism continued up towards the start of the 20th century , in part motivated by a fear that this would undermine the widespread belief in astrology and Islamic cosmology in Iran . The first work , <unk> al @-@ sa 'ada by <unk> al @-@ <unk> , aimed at undermining this belief in astrology and " old astronomy " in Iran was published in 1861 . On astrology , it cited the inability of different astrologers to make the same prediction about what occurs following a conjunction , and described the attributes astrologers gave to the planets as implausible . 
 = = Philosophy of science = = 
 Astrology provides the quintessential example of a pseudoscience since it has been tested repeatedly and failed all the tests . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Science and non @-@ science are often distinguished by the criterion of falsifiability . The criterion was first proposed by philosopher of science Karl Popper . To Popper , science does not rely on induction , instead scientific investigations are inherently attempts to falsify existing theories through novel tests . If a single test fails , then the theory is falsified . 
 Therefore , any test of a scientific theory must prohibit certain results that falsify the theory , and expect other specific results consistent with the theory . Using this criterion of falsifiability , astrology is a pseudoscience . 
 Astrology was Popper 's most frequent example of pseudoscience . Popper regarded astrology as " pseudo @-@ empirical " in that " it appeals to observation and experiment " , but " nevertheless does not come up to scientific standards " . 
 In contrast to scientific disciplines , astrology does not respond to falsification through experiment . According to Professor of neurology Terence Hines , this is a hallmark of pseudoscience . 
 = = = " No puzzles to solve " = = = 
 In contrast to Popper , the philosopher Thomas Kuhn argued that it was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific , but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non @-@ empirical . To Kuhn , although astrologers had , historically , made predictions that " categorically failed , " this in itself does not make it unscientific , nor do the attempts by astrologers to explain away the failure by claiming it was due to the creation of a horoscope being very difficult ( through subsuming , after the fact , a more general horoscope that leads to a different prediction ) . 
 Rather , in Kuhn 's eyes , astrology is not science because it was always more akin to medieval medicine ; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings , but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research , and so , " They had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise . " 
 While an astronomer could correct for failure , an astrologer could not . An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological hypothesis in a meaningful way . As such , to Kuhn , even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific . 
 = = = Progress , practice and consistency = = = 
 Philosopher Paul Thagard believed that astrology can not be regarded as falsified in this sense until it has been replaced with a successor . In the case of predicting behaviour , psychology is the alternative . To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience was that the state of the art must progress and that the community of researchers should be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives , and not be " selective in considering confirmations and <unk> " . 
 Progress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems , yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years . To Thagard , astrologers are acting as though engaged in normal science believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the " many unsolved problems " , and in the face of better alternative theories ( Psychology ) . For these reasons Thagard viewed astrology as pseudoscience . 
 To Thagard , astrology should not be regarded as a pseudoscience on the failure of Gauquelin 's to find any correlation between the various astrological signs and someone 's career , twins not showing the expected correlations from having the same signs in twin studies , lack of agreement on the significance of the planets discovered since Ptolemy 's time and large scale disasters wiping out individuals with vastly different signs at the same time . Rather , his demarcation of science requires three distinct foci ; " theory , community [ and ] historical context " . 
 While verification and falsifiability focused on the theory , Kuhn 's work focused on the historical context , but the astrological community should also be considered . Whether or not they : 
 are focused on comparing their approach to others . 
 have a consistent approach . 
 try to falsify their theory through experiment . 
 In this approach , true falsification rather than modifying a theory to avoid the falsification only really occurs when an alternative theory is proposed . 
 = = = Irrationality = = = 
 For the philosopher Edward W. James , astrology is irrational not because of the numerous problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments , but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with fallacious logic and poor reasoning . 
 What if throughout astrological writings we meet little appreciation of coherence , blatant insensitivity to evidence , no sense of a hierarchy of reasons , slight command over the contextual force of <unk> , stubborn unwillingness to pursue an argument where it leads , stark naivete concerning the efficacy of explanation and so on ? In that case , I think , we are perfectly justified in rejecting astrology as irrational . ... Astrology simply fails to meet the multifarious demands of legitimate reasoning . " 
 This poor reasoning includes appeals to ancient astrologers such as Kepler despite any relevance of topic or specific reasoning , and vague claims . The claim that evidence for astrology is that people born at roughly " the same place have a life pattern that is very similar " is vague , but also ignores that time is reference frame dependent and gives no definition of " same place " despite the planet moving in the reference frame of the solar system . Other comments by astrologers are based on severely <unk> interpretations of basic physics , such as a claim by one astrologer that the solar system looks like an atom . Further , James noted that response to criticism also relies on faulty logic , an example of which was a response to twin studies with the statement that coincidences in twins are due to astrology , but any differences are due to " heredity and environment " , while for other astrologers the issues are too difficult and they just want to get back to their astrology . Further , to astrologers , if something appears in their favour , they latch upon it as proof , while making no attempt to explore its implications , preferring to refer to the item in favour as definitive ; possibilities that do not make astrology look favourable are ignored . 
 = = = <unk> dichotomy = = = 
 From the <unk> web of knowledge , there is a dichotomy where one must either reject astrology or accept astrology but reject all established scientific disciplines that are incompatible with astrology . 
 = = Tests of astrology = = 
 <unk> often avoid making verifiable predictions , and instead rely on vague statements that let them try to avoid falsification . Across several centuries of testing , the predictions of astrology have never been more accurate than that expected by chance alone . One approach used in testing astrology quantitatively is through blind experiment . When specific predictions from astrologers were tested in rigorous experimental procedures in the Carlson test , the predictions were falsified . All controlled experiments have failed to show any effect . 
 = = = Carlson 's experiment = = = 
 The Shawn Carlson 's double @-@ blind chart matching tests , in which 28 astrologers agreed to match over 100 natal charts to psychological profiles generated by the California Psychological Inventory ( CPI ) test , is one of the most renowned tests of astrology , and was published in a highly prestigious journal , Nature . Double blinding helps to practically eliminate all bias from a study , including from participants as well as the person performing the study . The experimental protocol used in Carlson 's study was agreed to by a group of physicists and astrologers prior to the experiment . <unk> , nominated by the National Council for <unk> Research , acted as the astrological advisors , and helped to ensure , and agreed , that the test was fair . They also chose 26 of the 28 astrologers for the tests , the other 2 being interested astrologers who volunteered afterwards . The astrologers came from Europe and the United States . The astrologers helped to draw up the central proposition of natal astrology to be tested . Published in Nature in 1985 , the study found that predictions based on natal astrology were no better than chance , and that the testing " clearly refutes the astrological hypothesis " . 
 = = = Dean and Kelly = = = 
 Scientist and former astrologer Geoffrey Dean and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted a large @-@ scale scientific test , involving more than one hundred cognitive , behavioural , physical and other variables , but found no support for astrology . A further test involved 45 confident astrologers , with an average of 10 years experience and 160 test subjects ( out of an original sample size of 1198 test subjects ) who strongly favoured certain characteristics in the <unk> Personality Questionnaire to extremes . The astrologers performed much worse than merely basing decisions off the individuals ' ages , and much worse than 45 control subjects who did not use birth charts at all . 
 = = = Other tests = = = 
 A meta @-@ analysis was conducted , pooling 40 studies consisting of 700 astrologers and over 1 @,@ 000 birth charts . Ten of the tests , which had a total of 300 participating , involved the astrologers picking the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others that were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation ( usually three to five others ) . When the date and other obvious clues were removed , no significant results were found to suggest there was any preferred chart . 
 In 10 studies , participants picked horoscopes that they felt were accurate descriptions , with one being the " correct " answer . Again the results were no better than chance . 
 In a study of 2011 sets of people born within 5 minutes of each other ( " time twins " ) to see if there was any discernible effect , no effect was seen . 
 Quantitative sociologist David <unk> examined the census data for more than 20 million individuals in England and Wales to see if star signs corresponded to marriage arrangements . No effect was seen . 
 = = = Mars effect = = = 
 In 1955 , astrologer and psychologist Michel Gauquelin stated that although he had failed to find evidence to support such indicators as the zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology , he had found positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some of the planets and success in professions ( such as doctors , scientists , athletes , actors , writers , painters , etc . ) , which astrology traditionally associates with those planets . The best @-@ known of Gauquelin 's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the " Mars effect " . A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to replicate the claim , but found no statistical evidence . They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin 's part , accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study . 
 Geoffrey Dean has suggested that the effect may be caused by self @-@ reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin . The suggestion is that a small subset of the parents may have had changed birth times to be consistent with better astrological charts for a related profession . The sample group was taken from a time where belief in astrology was more common . Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in more recent populations , where a nurse or doctor recorded the birth information . The number of births under astrologically undesirable conditions was also lower , indicating more evidence that parents choose dates and times to suit their beliefs . 
 = = <unk> obstacles = = 
 Beyond the scientific tests astrology has failed , proposals for astrology face a number of other obstacles due to the many theoretical flaws in astrology including lack of consistency , lack of ability to predict missing planets , lack of any connection of the zodiac to the constellations , and lack of any plausible mechanism . The underpinnings of astrology tend to disagree with numerous basic facts from scientific disciplines . 
 = = = Lack of consistency = = = 
 Testing the validity of astrology can be difficult because there is no consensus amongst astrologers as to what astrology is or what it can predict . Dean and Kelly documented 25 studies , which had found that the degree of agreement amongst astrologers was measured as a low 0 @.@ 1 . Most professional astrologers are paid to predict the future or describe a person 's personality and life , but most horoscopes only make vague untestable statements that can apply to almost anyone . 
 Georges Charpak and Henri Broch dealt with claims from western astrology in the book <unk> ! ESP , <unk> , and other <unk> . They pointed out that astrologers have only a small knowledge of astronomy and that they often do not take into account basic features such as the precession of the equinoxes , which would change the position of the sun with time . They commented on the example of Elizabeth <unk> who claimed that " the sun ends up in the same place in the sky on the same date each year " as the basis for claims that two people with the same birthday but a number of years apart should be under the same planetary influence . Charpak and Broch noted that " there is a difference of about twenty @-@ two thousand miles between Earth 's location on any specific date in two successive years " and that thus they should not be under the same influence according to astrology . Over a 40 years period there would be a difference greater than 780 @,@ 000 miles . 
 = = = Lack of physical basis = = = 
 Edward W. James , commented that attaching significance to the constellation on the celestial sphere the sun is in at sunset was done on the basis of human factors — namely , that astrologers didn 't want to wake up early , and the exact time of noon was hard to know . Further , the creation of the zodiac and the disconnect from the constellations was because the sun is not in each constellation for the same amount of time . This disconnection from the constellations led to the problem with precession separating the zodiac symbols from the constellations that they once were related to . Philosopher of science , Massimo <unk> commenting on the movement , opined " Well then , which sign should I look up when I open my Sunday paper , I wonder ? " 
 The tropical zodiac has no connection to the stars , and as long as no claims are made that the constellations themselves are in the associated sign , astrologers avoid the concept that precession seemingly moves the constellations because they don 't reference them . Charpak and Broch , noting this , referred to astrology based on the tropical zodiac as being " ... empty boxes that have nothing to do with anything and are devoid of any consistency or correspondence with the stars . " Sole use of the tropical zodiac is inconsistent with references made , by the same astrologers , to the Age of Aquarius , which depends on when the vernal point enters the constellation of Aquarius . 
 = = = Lack of predictive power = = = 
 Some astrologers make claims that the position of all the planets must be taken into account , but astrologers were unable to predict the existence of Neptune based on mistakes in horoscopes . Instead Neptune was predicted using Newton 's law of universal gravitation . The grafting on of Uranus , Neptune and Pluto into the astrology discourse was done on an ad hoc basis . 
 On the demotion of Pluto to the status of dwarf planet , Philip <unk> of the Paris Observatory in Meudon , France wondered how astrologers should respond : 
 Should astrologers remove it from the list of <unk> [ Sun , Moon and the 8 planets other than earth ] and confess that it did not actually bring any improvement ? If they decide to keep it , what about the growing list of other recently discovered similar bodies ( Sedna , <unk> etc ) , some of which even have satellites ( Xena , <unk> ) ? 
 = = = Lack of mechanism = = = 
 Astrology has been criticised for failing to provide a physical mechanism that links the movements of celestial bodies to their purported effects on human behaviour . In a lecture in 2001 , Stephen Hawking stated " The reason most scientists don 't believe in astrology is because it is not consistent with our theories that have been tested by experiment . " In 1975 , amid increasing popular interest in astrology , The Humanist magazine presented a rebuttal of astrology in a statement put together by Bart J. Bok , Lawrence E. Jerome , and Paul Kurtz . The statement , entitled ' Objections to Astrology ' , was signed by 186 astronomers , physicists and leading scientists of the day . They said that there is no scientific foundation for the tenets of astrology and warned the public against accepting astrological advice without question . Their criticism focused on the fact that there was no mechanism whereby astrological effects might occur : 
 We can see how infinitesimally small are the gravitational and other effects produced by the distant planets and the far more distant stars . It is simply a mistake to imagine that the forces exerted by stars and planets at the moment of birth can in any way shape our futures . 
 Astronomer Carl Sagan declined to sign the statement . Sagan said he took this stance not because he thought astrology had any validity , but because he thought that the tone of the statement was authoritarian , and that dismissing astrology because there was no mechanism ( while " certainly a relevant point " ) was not in itself convincing . In a letter published in a follow @-@ up edition of The Humanist , Sagan confirmed that he would have been willing to sign such a statement had it described and refuted the principal tenets of astrological belief . This , he argued , would have been more persuasive and would have produced less controversy . 
 The use of poetic imagery based on the concepts of the macrocosm and microcosm , " as above so below " to decide meaning such as Edward W. James ' example of " Mars above is red , so Mars below means blood and war " , is a false cause fallacy . 
 Many astrologers claim that astrology is scientific . If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically , there are only four fundamental forces ( conventionally ) , limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms . Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity . The strength of these forces drops off with distance . Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since , for example , the magnetic field , when measured from earth , of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances . Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude , the sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note , but astrology isn 't based just off the sun alone . While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force , this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of Electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force . If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics , that would be an extraordinary claim . It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance . If distance is irrelevant , then , logically , all objects in space should be taken into account . 
 Carl Jung sought to invoke synchronicity , the claim that two events have some sort of acausal connection , to explain the lack of statistically significant results on astrology from a single study he conducted . However , synchronicity itself is considered neither testable nor falsifiable . The study was subsequently heavily criticised for its non @-@ random sample and its use of statistics and also its lack of consistency with astrology . 
 = = Psychology = = 
 It has also been shown that confirmation bias is a psychological factor that contributes to belief in astrology . Confirmation bias is a form of cognitive bias . 
 From the literature , astrology believers often tend to selectively remember those predictions that turned out to be true , and do not remember those that turned out false . Another , separate , form of confirmation bias also plays a role , where believers often fail to distinguish between messages that demonstrate special ability and those that do not . 
 Thus there are two distinct forms of confirmation bias that are under study with respect to astrological belief . 
 The Barnum effect is the tendency for an individual to give a high accuracy rating to a description of their personality that supposedly is tailored specifically for them , but is in fact vague and general enough to apply to a wide range of people . If more information is requested for a prediction , the more accepting people are of the results . 
 In 1949 Bertram <unk> conducted a personality test on students in his classroom . Each student was given a supposedly individual assessment but actually all students received the same assessment . The personality descriptions were taken from a book on astrology . When the students were asked to comment on the accuracy of the test , more than 40 % gave it the top mark of 5 out of 5 , and the average rating was 4 @.@ 2 . The results of this study have been replicated in numerous other studies . 
 The study of the Barnum / <unk> effect has been focused mostly on the level of acceptance of fake horoscopes and fake astrological personality profiles . Recipients of these personality assessments consistently fail to distinguish common and uncommon personality descriptors . In a study by Paul Rogers and Janice Soule ( 2009 ) , which was consistent with previous research on the issue , it was found that those who believed in astrology are generally more susceptible to giving more credence to the Barnum profile than skeptics . 
 By a process known as self @-@ attribution , it has been shown in numerous studies that individuals with knowledge of astrology tend to describe their personalities in terms of traits compatible with their astrological signs . The effect is heightened when the individuals were aware that the personality description was being used to discuss astrology . Individuals who were not familiar with astrology had no such tendency . 
 = = Sociology = = 
 In 1953 , sociologist Theodor W. Adorno conducted a study of the astrology column of a Los Angeles newspaper as part of a project that examined mass culture in capitalist society . Adorno believed that popular astrology , as a device , invariably led to statements that encouraged conformity — and that astrologers who went against conformity with statements that discouraged performance at work etc. risked losing their jobs . Adorno concluded that astrology was a large @-@ scale manifestation of systematic irrationalism , where flattery and vague generalisations subtly led individuals to believe the author of the column addressed them directly . Adorno drew a parallel with the phrase opium of the people , by Karl Marx , by commenting , " <unk> is the <unk> of the dopes . " 
 False balance is where a false , <unk> or spurious viewpoint is included alongside a well reasoned one in media reports and TV appearances and as a result the false balance implies " there were two equal sides to a story when clearly there were not " . During Wonders of the Solar System , a TV programme by the BBC , the physicist Brian Cox said " Despite the fact that astrology is a load of rubbish , Jupiter can in fact have a profound influence on our planet . And it ’ s through a force . . . gravity . " This upset believers in astrology who complained that there was no astrologer to provide an alternative viewpoint . Following the complaints of astrology believers , Cox gave the following statement to the BBC : " I apologise to the astrology community for not making myself clear . I should have said that this new age drivel is undermining the very fabric of our civilisation . " In the programme <unk> Live , Cox further commented by saying : " in the interests of balance on the BBC , yes astrology is nonsense . " In an editorial in the medical journal BMJ , editor Trevor Jackson cited this incident showing where false balance could occur . 
 Studies and polling has shown that the belief in astrology is higher in western countries than might otherwise be expected . In 2012 , in polls 42 % of Americans said they thought astrology was at least partially scientific . This belief decreased with education and education is highly correlated with levels of scientific knowledge . 
 Some of the reported belief levels are due to a confusion of astrology with astronomy ( the scientific study of celestial objects ) . The closeness of the two words varies depending on the language . A plain description of astrology as an " occult influence of stars , planets etc. on human affairs " had no impact on the general public 's assessment of whether astrology is scientific or not in a 1992 <unk> poll . This may partially be due to the implicit association amongst the general public , of any wording ending in " <unk> " with a legitimate field of knowledge . In <unk> 224 and 225 performed in 2004 , a split poll was used to isolate confusion over wording . In half of the polls , the word " astrology " was used , while in the other the word " horoscope " was used . Belief that astrology was at least partially scientific was 76 % , but belief that horoscopes were at least partially scientific was 43 % . In particular , belief that astrology was very scientific was 26 % while that of horoscopes was 7 % . This appeared to indicate that the high level of apparent polling support for astrology in the EU was indeed due to confusion over terminology .

 Escape from Woomera is an unfinished point @-@ and @-@ click adventure video game , intended to criticise the treatment of <unk> detained asylum seekers in Australia as well as the Australian government 's attempt to impose a media blackout on the detention centres . In the game , the player assumes the role of Mustafa , an Iranian asylum seeker being held at Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre . Mustafa 's request for asylum has been denied , and , fearing that he will be killed by the Iranian government upon his repatriation to Iran , he decides to attempt to escape Woomera . Mustafa must explore Woomera and speak with other individuals at the centre to devise and execute an escape plan . 
 The game was developed in 2003 and 2004 by a team of Australian video game industry professionals and an investigative journalist , using Half @-@ Life 's GoldSrc engine . The developers received an AU $ 25 @,@ 000 grant from the Australia Council to make the game , propelling the project to national attention , where the idea received a predominantly negative reception . The Australia Council 's decision to fund the game drew condemnation from both Minister for Immigration Philip Ruddock and Australian Human Rights Commission leader Dr. Sev <unk> . Unable to secure further funding , a full game was never developed , and the playable prototype was made available free of charge online .

 Escape from Woomera opens with three screens of text that explain the game 's background . Players assume the role of Mustafa , who paid smugglers to bring him to Australia after his parents were killed by the Iranian secret police . After the boat transporting him crashed in the Ashmore Reef , Mustafa was brought to the Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre , where he was given the identification number " RAR @-@ 124 " . After three months , Mustafa was informed that his request for asylum was denied , and that he would be repatriated to Iran . Believing that he would be tortured and killed upon his return , Mustafa decided to escape Woomera .
