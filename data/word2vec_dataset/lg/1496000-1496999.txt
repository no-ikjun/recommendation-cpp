 = Missouri Route 108 = 
 Route 108 is a short highway in the Bootheel of southeastern Missouri . Its eastern terminus is the Arkansas state line at Arkansas Highway 77 , about six miles ( 10 km ) south of Arbyrd , the only town on the route . Its western terminus is at U.S. Route 412 ( US 412 ) about two miles ( 3 km ) north of Arbyrd . Although signed as an east – west route , the route follows mostly north – south roadways . The route was designated in 1930 , and was extended east in 1972 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Route 108 begins at the Arkansas state line in <unk> , Dunklin County , where the road continues south into that state as Highway 77 . From the Arkansas @-@ Missouri state line , the route heads north as a two @-@ lane undivided road , passing a few homes and businesses in <unk> before running through farmland . The road continues through rural areas to the southern edge of Arbyrd , where it reaches an intersection with Route 164 . At this point , Route 108 turns east to form a concurrency with Route 164 , with the two routes passing through more fields before running to the south of industry . Route 108 splits from Route 164 by heading north on East Frisco Street , passing homes and a few businesses . Route 108 leaves Arbyrd and heads through more agricultural areas before reaching its eastern terminus at US 412 . In 2012 , Missouri Department of Transportation ( MoDOT ) calculated 1 @,@ 057 vehicles traveling north of the state line . This is expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) , a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year .

 Route 108 was designated in 1930 , connecting from the state line to Route 25 . The road was already paved in gravel . Three years later , Route Y was designated , and it connected from Route 108 in <unk> to Caruth . In 1936 , Route 108 was repaved in concrete . By 1953 , Route 25 was rerouted into Arbyrd , becoming the terminus of Routes 108 and Y there . Route 164 was designated in 1956 , replacing a large section of Route Y from Route 108 to Route N. Fifteen years later , Route 25 was rerouted to the west , and the old alignment , from Route 246 , through Arbyrd , became part of Route 108 . Around 1983 , US 412 was designated , replacing Route 25 from Kennett to the state line .

 Dark Angel is an American <unk> / cyberpunk science fiction television series . It was created by James Cameron and Charles H. Eglee and starred Jessica Alba in her breakthrough role . The series chronicles the life of Max Guevara , a genetically @-@ enhanced super @-@ soldier who escapes from a covert government military facility as a child . In a post @-@ apocalyptic Seattle , she tries to lead a normal life , while eluding capture by government agents and searching for her genetically @-@ enhanced brothers and sisters scattered in the aftermath of their escape . The series was filmed in Vancouver , British Columbia , at Lions Gate Studios . 
 The show premiered in the United States on the Fox network on October 3 , 2000 . The high @-@ budget pilot episode was Cameron 's television debut and was heavily promoted by Fox . The first season , which was shown on Tuesday nights in the U.S. , received mainly positive reviews and won several awards . Alba 's portrayal of Max also received mostly positive reviews . For the second season the show was moved to Friday nights , received some criticism for new plot elements and suffered from a ratings drop . It was subsequently cancelled . The storyline was continued in a series of novels ; a video game adaptation was also released after the show 's cancellation .

 = = = Season one = = = 
 In 2009 , a genetically enhanced , nine @-@ year @-@ old female supersoldier designated as X5 @-@ 452 ( Geneva Locke ) escapes along with eleven others from a secret government institution , codenamed Manticore , where they were born , raised and trained to be soldiers and assassins . On June 1 , 2009 , months after X5 @-@ 452 's escape , terrorists detonate an electromagnetic pulse weapon in the atmosphere over the U.S. , which destroys the vast majority of computer and communication systems , throwing the country into chaos . 
 Ten years later in 2019 , the now 19 @-@ year @-@ old X5 @-@ 452 ( Jessica Alba ) , who calls herself Max Guevara , struggles to search for her Manticore brothers and sisters . In a recovering United States , which is now barely more than a Third World nation , she tries to live a relatively normal life and evade capture from Manticore , who wish to recover their lost asset . She joins forces and develops a romantic interest with Logan Cale ( Michael Weatherly ) , an underground cyber @-@ journalist with the alias Eyes Only . Logan recruits her to help fight corruption in the post @-@ Pulse world ; at the same time she makes a living as a bicycle messenger at Jam Pony , a courier company , along with her friends Original Cindy ( <unk> Rae Miller ) , Herbal Thought ( Alimi Ballard ) , and Sketchy ( Richard Gunn ) . Other <unk> are periodically introduced , most significantly Zack ( William Gregory Lee ) , the unit leader . The Manticore hunt for the escaped <unk> is led by Colonel Donald Lydecker ( John Savage ) . Near the end of the season , Lydecker is betrayed by his superior , the even more ruthless Elizabeth Renfro ( Nana Visitor ) , and subsequently defects from Manticore . He aids Max and Zack in an assault on the Manticore headquarters , though Max is badly wounded and captured . Zack , who has also been captured , commits suicide to provide Max with his heart , as she needs an X5 heart transplant to survive . 
 = = = Season two = = = 
 Aided by Alec ( Jensen Ackles ) , a fellow X5 who later joins Jam Pony , and Joshua ( Kevin Durand ) , a transgenic with canine DNA , Max escapes the facility . When Max is reunited with Logan he immediately becomes ill and almost dies . Max discovers that Manticore infected her with a virus specifically designed to kill Logan , and the two must avoid all physical contact to keep him alive . Alec follows her to Logan 's and informs her that she needs to take Logan and return to Manticore in order to save him . Instead , Max uses Logan 's Eyes Only setup and exposes Manticore to the world . Renfro decides to burn the facility in an attempt to cover up the evidence , though she is killed in the process when Max returns to retrieve the life @-@ saving serum Logan needs . Max takes this opportunity to save numerous transgenics , releasing them out into the world . Max learns that Joshua was the first transgenic created by Sandeman , Manticore 's founder . It is revealed that a millennia @-@ old breeding cult , similar in structure to the Illuminati , has bred their own super @-@ soldiers that rival the Manticore @-@ produced transgenics . Ames White ( Martin Cummins ) , a government agent tasked with eliminating the freed transgenics , is revealed to be a member of the cult . When a strange message written in Max 's genetic code makes an appearance on her skin , it is revealed that Sandeman is a renegade from the breeding cult and Ames White is his son . White is still loyal to the cult and hates his father 's transgenic creations with a passion . Believing that Max is a threat to their plans , the breeding cult attempt to kill her , though she escapes to Terminal City , an abandoned part of Seattle where hundreds of outcast transgenics have been hiding . When the police begin to surround Terminal City , Max convinces the other transgenics to stand their ground rather than run . The series ends with the military surrounding and possibly preparing to invade Terminal City , as the residents raise their newly designed flag from one of their buildings . 
 = = = Storyline for season three = = = 
 In the DVD commentary for " Freak Nation " , the series finale , Charles H. Eglee , the executive producer and co @-@ creator , explained what was planned for season three . The intention was to bring together the storylines of seasons one ( Manticore ) and two ( breeding cult ) and reveal the mythology of Dark Angel . 
 The show 's mythology was planned to be that , thousands of years ago , Earth passed through a comet 's tail which deposited viral material that killed 97 % of the human race . The great pyramids in Egypt were actually genetic repositories , preserving the DNA of the survivors , built by the breeding cult to pass on this genetic immunity so that when the comet returned only members of the cult would survive . Sandeman , a cult member and Max 's creator , betrayed the cult and decided to give this genetic immunity to the rest of humanity , believing that everybody deserved the cure . The other cult members deemed Sandeman a heretic and a threat , undermining their goals of rebuilding humanity in their own image . Sandeman found a way to spread this genetic immunity to everyone through Max , who would be the savior of the human race . There were multiple ideas of how to spread Max 's immunity to humanity , including an air burst that would disperse the antibody through the atmosphere , or attaching the immunity to a common cold virus ( Eglee detailed how a scene would show Original Cindy sneezing as part of the beginning of the immunity spread ) . This intended storyline is expanded on in the final Dark Angel novel " After the Dark " , though when the comet returns nobody falls ill , and it is believed that the cult simply had a false prediction . 
 = = Cast and characters = = 
 The first season introduced Jessica Alba as the main character Max Guevara ( X5 @-@ 452 ) , a genetically enhanced transgenic super @-@ soldier who escaped from the government facility Manticore and now works as a bike messenger for courier company Jam Pony and as a cat burglar . Michael Weatherly played Logan Cale ( " Eyes Only " ) , the second most prominent character . Cale is a wealthy cyber @-@ journalist and vigilante who recruits Max to aid his campaign against corruption and crime in return for helping her find information on her fellow Manticore escapees . Main roles were given to several of the staff at Jam Pony , including J. C. MacKenzie as Reagan " Normal " Ronald , the company 's boss , <unk> Rae Miller as Cynthia " Original Cindy " <unk> , Richard Gunn as Calvin " Sketchy " Theodore and Alimi Ballard as Herbal Thought , all of whom worked as couriers .

 Following his success with the film Titanic , the director James Cameron teamed up with Eglee , with whom he had previously worked on projects including Piranha II : The Spawning . The two formed a production company and began working on ideas for a television series , considering several options including a family drama before deciding on the idea of Dark Angel . Cameron said they began with the idea that Max would be genetic construct who " looked normal on the outside but was different on the cellular , genetic level . We explore what that could mean . " Max followed a long line of strong female characters in Cameron 's work , including Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley . Cameron said " it 's a win / win situation " as " women respond to characters who appear strong and capable " and young male audiences " want to see girls kick ass " . Later they decided to set the series in a post @-@ social collapse world , saying that the hysteria surrounding Y2K served as inspiration for the ' Pulse ' in the series which has destroyed all computers in the United States . Working titles for the series included " Experimental Girl " and " Maximum Girl " . The project marked Cameron 's debut into television ; Cameron would be working as a writer and executive producer , rather than directing . 
 = = = Casting and filming = = = 
 More than 1000 young actresses were considered for the part of Max , and Cameron started reviewing audition tapes when it had been narrowed down to 20 or 30 applicants . Cameron was not impressed with Alba 's audition tape , saying " she had her head down , she was reading out of the script ... she didn 't present herself all that well . But there was something about the way she read the script that copped an attitude that I liked . " Cameron continually reviewed the audition tapes but kept coming back to Alba 's , eventually deciding that he needed to meet her . Alba was hired for the role before the script was written . Eglee said " We had the benefit of being able to write a script kind of backwards , we were writing for this actress , with her cadences and her rhythms and her sensibilities and her attitude and her slang . " In order to train for the role , Alba spent a year doing martial arts and gymnastics and riding motorcycles . 
 The two @-@ hour premiere episode cost up to $ 10 million to produce , and Cameron reportedly " brought the pilot in on time and on budget " . Subsequent episodes had a considerably lower budget . Fox spent heavily on the promotional campaign for the premiere , paying for theatrical trailers , billboards and guerilla marketing . Cameron took a " very basic view " of the show 's chance of success , saying " If it flies , it flies . If it doesn 't , it doesn 't ... If people connect with it , which I hope they will , fine . If we don 't find an audience , we deserve to be off the air . It 's that simple . " Eglee admitted the series had been " routinely overbudget " for the first season , and feared that this would be a factor in whether the show was renewed for a second season , though Cameron downplayed the concerns . 
 Fox " just barely " renewed the series for a second season . The cost of episodes in season two was $ 1 @.@ 3 million each . After the planned director for the final episode fell through , Cameron decided to step in and fill the position . He did this partially for the experience but also to show the network the potential for the third season . It was his first experience directing a TV drama . The producers were initially told a third season had been approved , but two days later Fox informed them that the series had actually been cancelled . 
 They called us on Saturday and told us we were on schedule and we 'd been picked up . We got together Saturday night and celebrated . Sunday goes by , and Monday morning we get a call saying , ' No , you 're not on the schedule ! It 's been changed . ' I 've never heard of that happening . But then , I 'd never been around television . ... We were supposed to be on a plane on Monday to go to the [ network ] upfront in New York on Tuesday . They called us that day and told us not to go ! I was pissed ! 
 While Dark Angel was set in Seattle , filming took place in Vancouver , British Columbia , at Lions Gate Studios . Other filming locations included the Vancouver Art Gallery , as well as Buntzen Lake and Riverview Hospital , also in British Columbia .

 The first season premiered in the United States on Tuesday , October 3 , 2000 , from 9 : 00 pm until 11 : 00 pm . Fox had to obtain agreements from its affiliates to broadcast past 10 : 00 pm , as most of them air local news programs at this time . For the second season Fox moved the airing time from Tuesdays at 9 : 00 pm , where it had been competing with Angel on The WB , to at 8 : 00 pm on Fridays , where it preceded the new series Pasadena . 
 The final episode of the series aired on May 3 , 2002 as a special 90 @-@ minute episode . Dark Angel has been syndicated on the Syfy and the El Rey Network in the United States and on E4 and the Horror Channel in the UK .

 The score for the Dark Angel pilot was composed and conducted by Joel McNeely . The score track " Bicycle Ride " was used in the end credits for the duration of the series . The pilot score was released in full as part of the original publicity press kit , titled Dark Angel : Complete Score from the Dark Angel Pilot . The 37 @-@ track CD was for promotional use only and not for resale . 
 A soundtrack album consisting of hip hop and R & B songs was released on April 23 , 2002 through Artemis Records . It peaked at No. 50 on the Top Independent Albums chart . Jason Birchmeier from AllMusic gave the soundtrack three out of five stars , calling it " impressive " and adding that it " exceeds your expectations for a television show soundtrack " . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Initial reaction to the series and the character of Max was mostly positive , with favorable reviews in Rolling Stone and Time . Hal Boedeker from the Orlando Sentinel said " Television 's newest warrior woman possesses skills worthy of Catwoman , Xena , Emma Peel and Wonder Woman . " Howard Rosenberg said " If pouty faces and sexy walks could destroy , the highly arresting Max would be wiping out the entire planet . " However Joyce Millman said Max was " little more than lips and ass " and that the series was " the most expensive Britney Spears video ever made . " People gave a negative review of the Pilot episode in October 2000 , though in December they listed Alba 's portrayal of Max as among the " breakthrough " performances of 2000 . 
 The first episode was only behind CSI : Crime Scene Investigation as the most watched new show of the week , albeit in a week with fewer new shows due to presidential debate coverage . Fox chose to debut Dark Angel instead of airing the first presidential debate , a move which TV analyst Marc Berman praised , saying " The people who watch the debates aren 't the people who 'll tune into Dark Angel anyway " , though he predicted that the high ratings of the premiere would not hold up as the show competed against more various competition in subsequent weeks . It was the tenth most popular show overall that week , attracting 17 @.@ 4 million viewers . Cameron said he did not know if the airing time change for the second season would have a positive or negative effect on the shows ratings , though R. D. Heldenfels from the Sun Journal noted the poor ratings of Friday night television , especially the low viewing rates among 18- to 24 @-@ year @-@ olds , the age @-@ group that Dark Angel was most popular with . The new time slot saw a ratings drop ; for the 2001 – 02 season Dark Angel averaged 6 million viewers , ranking at No. 114 in Nielsen ratings . 
 Commenting at the release of the second season , Cynthia Fuchs from PopMatters said the first season of Dark Angel was one of the " few straight @-@ up successes , a ratings hit among the coveted ' youth ' demographic " . She praised the series but clarified " I 'm not getting carried away : Jim Cameron is not going to be making revolutionary art anytime soon . " Michael Sauter from Entertainment Weekly gave the first season a B + and spoke highly of Alba , saying that " for a while [ she was ] TV 's hottest kick @-@ butt heroine . " Elka Karl from Common Sense Media gave the entire series 3 out of 5 stars , saying " While the dialogue sometimes falls flat , overall the show is well @-@ scripted and well acted , and Alba does an excellent job of carrying the series . Dark Angel isn 't perfect by any stretch of the imagination , but it is compelling television that teen sci @-@ fi fans will enjoy . " While praising the first season , Randy <unk> from TVOvermind labelled the second season as " silly " , criticizing " dumb stories " like Max 's dream episode " Boo " , the virus that prevents Logan and Max having physical contact , and the various half @-@ animal Manticore experiments that are revealed . 
 Writing in his book The Encyclopedia of Superheroes on Film and Television , John Kenneth Muir said it was necessary for Cameron to set Dark Angel in the future because the prosperity of the U.S. in 2000 " offered little possibility for crime , squalor and other societal problems . " While criticizing certain plot elements in the second season as contributing to the show 's downfall , Muir said a larger factor in the ratings drop was the change of life in the U.S. following events including the September 11 attacks , the Enron scandal , as well as the government losing their financial surplus , which changed Dark Angel 's " futuristic vision of recession in a Third @-@ World America " from an interesting far @-@ fetched premise to a " depressing reminder that things could still get worse " . 
 In 2004 , Max was ranked at No. 17 in TV Guide 's list of the " 25 Greatest Sci @-@ Fi Legends " , and in 2012 , Dave Golder from GamesRadar ranked her at No. 49 on his list of the 100 sexiest women in sci @-@ fi . 
 The 2007 film Hitman re @-@ used footage from Dark Angel of Max and other Manticore children in training . The footage was used to portray the Hitman protagonist Agent 47 , a cloned assassin who like the Manticore children , has a barcode on the back of his head .

 Written by Max Allan Collins , three original novels expand upon the Dark Angel television series , with two picking up directly where the series ended . 
 Dark Angel : Before the Dawn ( 2002 ) is a prequel to the television series , detailing Max 's life after her escape from Manticore in 2009 . After witnessing footage taken in Seattle of a man she believes to be one of her X5 siblings , Max moves from Los Angeles to Seattle , meeting Original Cindy and Kendra on the way , before finding employment at Jam Pony . Max eventually discovers the man in the footage is her brother Seth , who unbeknown to her has been working for Logan as a personal agent . Shortly after being reunited with him at the Space Needle , Seth , who has been injured , commits suicide by falling from the building to avoid being captured by Lydecker . Max subsequently begins returning to the Space Needle to think and " to be with Seth . " 
 Dark Angel : Skin Game ( 2003 ) immediately follows the events of " Freak Nation , " the final episode of season two , describing days in May 2021 . Skin Game focuses on a killer terrorizing the streets of Seattle and the growing suspicion and evidence that the killer could be a transgenic . As the killings escalate , the U.S. Army and National Guard prepare themselves for an invasion of Terminal City . Max uncovers that the killer is a shapeshifting transgenic named Kelpy , though he has been unwillingly given a drug by Ames White that is causing his psychosis . When Max reveals this information to the public through Eyes Only , Ames White goes into hiding , and the invasion of Terminal City is called off . When Kelpy takes on Logan 's form he is killed by the virus Max carries which was designed to kill Logan . 
 Dark Angel : After the Dark ( 2003 ) follows Skin Game . It is revealed that Max 's virus is gone , the most likely explanation being that when the virus killed Kelpy it went dormant as it believed its mission to kill Logan was accomplished . The relationship between Logan and Max , however , is thrown into turmoil when he reveals his secret that he inadvertently caused Seth 's death by sending him on an assignment . Just as Max is ready to forgive him , Logan is kidnapped by Ames White and the breeding cult , who are preparing for the coming of a comet they believe will destroy everyone except cult @-@ members and transgenics through depositing viral material into Earth 's atmosphere . They are trying to kill Max as they believe she possesses a genetic code that will save ordinary humans from the comet 's viral material . With the aid of a team of transgenics , Max eventually rescues Logan , destroys the headquarters of the breeding cult , and Joshua kills Ames White . When the comet arrives nobody falls ill , and it is believed the cult 's prediction was false . Max finds Lydecker in a prison cell at the cult 's headquarters . He promises to help her find her mother if she saves him , and she agrees . The book ends with Logan and Max finally consummating their relationship . 
 A companion book , Dark Angel : The Eyes Only Dossier , was also published in 2003 . It is attributed to Logan Cale and was supposedly compiled by D. A. Stern . The book begins with a letter written by Logan during the stand @-@ off at Terminal City . It is addressed to Detective Matt Sung , a recurring character from the series who aides Logan , instructing him that the package he is sending him contains documents pertaining to the four most critical Eyes Only investigations . In the event that Logan is killed by the potential invasion of Terminal City , he wants Sung to carry on the investigations . The rest of the book contains said documents relating to the four investigations .

 After the show 's release the Argentine artists Carlos Trillo and Carlos Meglia , creators of the Argentine comic book series Cybersix , filed a lawsuit against Cameron and Fox for plagiarism . Cybersix was created by Trillo ( writer ) and Meglia ( penciler ) in the early 90s for the European market , and appeared in Spanish in November 1993 ; an animated TV series based on the comic strip was released in 1999 . Trillo and Meglia accused Dark Angel of stealing most of the comic 's plot and its most recognizable elements . In a 2007 interview Trillo stated that he and Meglia were not able to carry on with the lawsuit due to lack of financial resources , so they dropped it , although the issue is still a matter of controversy : 
 Meglia and I were sure we had been plagiarized . Cybersix readers who watched Cameron 's TV series were sure as well . We tried to move forward with a lawsuit against Cameron and Fox . It wasn 't possible for us to continue because the comic book world does not give you the financial possibility [ in Argentina ] of confronting a showbusiness multinational company . We couldn 't afford lawyers in LA to carry on with the attempt to claim our original story .

Kieftenbeld was sent off in the first leg of the semi @-@ final , so was suspended for the second . He was replaced at half @-@ time in the first leg of the final , which Groningen lost 5 – 1 to ADO Den Haag , and was an unused substitute in the second leg as they recovered from the four @-@ goal deficit only to lose out on penalties . 
 In his second season , Kieftenbeld played regularly in his preferred position in midfield . He scored his first goal for Groningen on 30 October 2011 in what finished up as their biggest win ever against Feyenoord , by six goals to nil . Kieftenbeld 's goal was the second of the six , a powerful drive from 30 metres ( 33 yd ) . In the January transfer window , Groningen turned down what was described as a substantial bid for him from Belgian Pro League club Club Brugge ; having let Danny Holla join VVV @-@ Venlo on loan , they were not prepared to lose another midfielder . His performances over the season earned him the supporters ' vote as Player of the Year . 
 Kieftenbeld was more often substitute than starter in the first few weeks of 2012 – 13 under new manager Robert <unk> , but went on to re @-@ establish himself in the side . A minor knee injury sustained during the mid @-@ season training camp meant he missed a couple of matches , and thereafter his appearances in the starting eleven were intermittent , whether through suspension or just not being selected . Groningen finished in seventh place , albeit 19 points behind Twente whom they faced in the play @-@ offs . Kieftenbeld put in a strong performance in the first leg in a 1 – 0 defeat at home , but a 3 – 2 loss in the second leg confirmed that Groningen would not qualify for the Europa League .

 Ahead of the 2013 – 14 season , <unk> 's replacement Erwin van de <unk> appointed Kieftenbeld vice @-@ captain , with Rasmus Lindgren as captain . He began the season on the bench , but soon came back into the starting eleven , frequently wore the captain 's armband in Lindgren 's absence , and reduced his yellow @-@ card count in the first half of the season from his usual five or six to just one . Towards the end of the season , he captained the side even when Lindgren played – at the latter 's recommendation – and according to the club 's website , he was the inspiration for a ten @-@ match unbeaten finish that meant Groningen qualified for European football for the first time in seven years . Technical director Henk <unk> said he was a " worthy ambassador " for the club both on and off the field . Amid interest both from other Eredivisie clubs and from abroad , including Club Brugge , Kieftenbeld signed a new two @-@ year contract . The negotiations were lengthy , but the player said he was happy staying where he was appreciated , and the prospect of European football played a part . According to the club , the player insisted on a release clause being included in the contract . 
 Groningen entered the 2014 – 15 Europa League in the second <unk> round . After a goalless draw in the away leg , opponents Aberdeen took a two @-@ goal lead in the second leg . Kieftenbeld scored a headed goal just before half @-@ time to reduce the deficit , but Aberdeen held out and Groningen were eliminated . Afterwards , Aberdeen 's Jonny Hayes spoke of the motivation they drew from over @-@ confident remarks reportedly made by Kieftenbeld and others ahead of the second leg which they perceived as disrespectful . Domestically , Kieftenbeld missed only one match in all competitions , through suspension , and played every minute of Groningen 's 2014 – 15 KNVB Cup run . In the quarter @-@ final , he " hammered in the fourth from the edge of the box " in a 4 – 0 defeat of Eredivisie club Vitesse Arnhem , and Groningen beat another top @-@ flight club , Excelsior , 3 – 0 in the semi @-@ final . In the final , Albert <unk> 's two goals were enough to beat cup @-@ holders PEC Zwolle , and Kieftenbeld as captain lifted the first major trophy in the club 's history . 
 Kieftenbeld was twice shortlisted for the Eredivisie 's annual <unk> <unk> ( Community Player ) award , which brings with it a € 50 @,@ 000 prize to be donated to a social project of the winner 's choice . He was actively involved with Kids United , a football team for children with disabilities . Although he did not win on either occasion , his charity still benefited when the 2015 winner , Jeroen <unk> , shared the prize money with the other two nominees . In late July 2015 , English club Birmingham City made a bid for Kieftenbeld 's services that triggered the release clause in his contract . Although Groningen accepted they could not stop him leaving , they were disappointed not just at losing their captain so soon before the start of the new season , but at losing a player who did so much for the club in the community . 
 = = = Birmingham City = = = 
 On 27 July , Kieftenbeld signed a three @-@ year contract with Football League Championship ( second @-@ tier ) club Birmingham City . The fee was officially undisclosed , but the release clause figure was widely reported as € 250 @,@ 000 . He went straight into the starting eleven for the opening game of the season , playing alongside Stephen Gleeson in a 4 – 2 – 3 – 1 formation , " clattered around midfield breaking up play , putting in tackles and generally making it uncomfortable " for the opponents , and kept his place for the next few league matches . After David Davis 's fine performance in the League Cup tie against Aston Villa was followed by mistakes in midfield in a poor defeat at home to Rotherham United , manager Gary Rowett included Davis alongside Kieftenbeld and Gleeson as Birmingham won 2 – 0 at Brentford . Minor injury restricted Kieftenbeld to a seat on the bench against Blackburn Rovers in early November , and Davis took over his role as Rowett reverted to a two @-@ man central midfield . Although Rowett said Davis was unlucky not to start the visit to Brighton & Hove Albion at the end of the month , Kieftenbeld returned to the side to provide " a bit more control " ; he was involved in an incident when Liam Rosenior suffered knee damage in what Brighton manager Chris Hughton described as a " just a whole @-@ hearted challenge " . 
 Having scored just five times in more than 200 league matches in the Netherlands , Kieftenbeld registered three goals in 22 days in January 2016 . In the 89th minute of the match at home to Brentford , he won the ball in midfield , played it through to James Vaughan , and kept running ; when Vaughan shot across goal , Kieftenbeld arrived at the far post just in time to slide the ball home for the winner . At Derby County two weeks later , he ran on to a clearance and hit a powerful volley from outside the penalty area wide of the goalkeeper to complete a 3 – 0 victory , and repeated the feat in the next match , at home to Ipswich Town . The goals earned him a nomination for January 's Championship Player of the Month , but he lost out to Hull City 's Abel Hernández .

 Kieftenbeld made his first appearance in international football for the Netherlands Beloftenelftal ( Promises Team ) , an under @-@ 21 team providing a stepping @-@ stone between the under @-@ 19 team and the full under @-@ 21 team , in March 2010 . He played the first half of a 2 – 1 defeat in a friendly match against Slovenia U21 . After Leroy Fer and Dirk <unk> were requisitioned for the senior squad in August 2010 , Kieftenbeld received his first under @-@ 21 call @-@ up , and made his debut as a second @-@ half substitute in a 2011 European Championship qualifier against Liechtenstein , He also played against Spain in September with the group already won : taking the field after 66 minutes , he was sent off 12 minutes later for a foul on Ander Herrera . He made his first start for the under @-@ 21s in a friendly against Denmark in November 2010 , playing at right back in a 3 – 1 win ; his through ball set up Bas Dost for the third goal . He played in two more U21 friendlies , against the Czech Republic and Germany , and was an unused substitute in four Euro 2013 qualifiers in 2011 and 2012 . His last international appearances were at the 2012 Toulon Tournament , at which the Netherlands were represented by the Beloftenelftal ; he played in four of their five matches . 
 = = Style of play = = 
 Dutch journalist Michiel <unk> suggests that Kieftenbeld 's position of choice is as a holding midfielder in front of the defence , where he can best use his energy in recovering the ball . He is comfortable on the ball and able to distribute it , but can be careless in possession , and " he really tries to shake up things when the play has gone dormant . In that lies his weakness as well – he can pick up silly fouls and cards from time to time . " With Groningen , he averaged eight yellow cards a season . According to Groningen 's technical director Henk <unk> , speaking in 2014 , his battling style and never @-@ say @-@ die attitude made him the sort of player with whom supporters could identify . In a 2011 interview , Kieftenbeld described himself as a perfectionist who always wanted to improve , and said that he sometimes put too much pressure on himself .

 = Njörðr = 
 In Norse mythology , Njörðr is a god among the Vanir . Njörðr , father of the deities Freyr and Freyja by his unnamed sister , was in an ill @-@ fated marriage with the goddess Skaði , lives in Nóatún and is associated with sea , seafaring , wind , fishing , wealth , and crop fertility . 
 Njörðr is attested in the Poetic Edda , compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources , the Prose Edda , written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson , in euhemerized form as a beloved mythological early king of Sweden in Heimskringla , also written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century , as one of three gods invoked in the 14th century Hauksbók ring oath , and in numerous Scandinavian place names . Veneration of Njörðr survived into 18th or 19th century Norwegian folk practice , where the god is recorded as <unk> and thanked for a bountiful catch of fish . 
 Njörðr has been the subject of an amount of scholarly discourse and theory , often connecting him with the figure of the much earlier attested Germanic goddess Nerthus , the hero Hadingus , and theorizing on his formerly more prominent place in Norse paganism due to the appearance of his name in numerous place names . Njörðr is sometimes modernly anglicized as Njord , <unk> , or <unk> . 
 = = Name and eponyms = = 
 The name Njörðr corresponds to that of the older Germanic fertility goddess Nerthus , and both derive from the Proto @-@ Germanic * Nerþuz . The original meaning of the name is contested , but it may be related to the Irish word <unk> which means " force " and " power " . It has been suggested that the change of sex from the female Nerthus to the male Njörðr is due to the fact that feminine nouns with u @-@ stems disappeared early in Germanic language while the masculine nouns with u @-@ stems prevailed . However , other scholars hold the change to be based not on grammatical gender but on the evolution of religious beliefs ; that * Nerþuz and Njörðr appear as different genders because they are to be considered separate beings . The name Njörðr may be related to the name of the Norse goddess <unk> . 
 Njörðr 's name appears in various place names in Scandinavia , such as <unk> ( now <unk> ) , <unk> ( now <unk> ) , <unk> ( now <unk> ) , <unk> ( now <unk> ) in Sweden , <unk> in southwest Iceland , <unk> and <unk> ( now Nærøy ) in Norway . Njörðr 's name appears in a word for sponge ; <unk> ( Old Norse " Njörðr 's glove " ) . Additionally , in Old Icelandic translations of Classical mythology the Roman god Saturn 's name is glossed as " Njörðr . " 
 = = Attestations = = 
 Njörðr is attested in the following works : 
 = = = Poetic Edda = = = 
 Njörðr is described as a future survivor of Ragnarök in stanza 39 of the poem Vafþrúðnismál . In the poem , the god Odin , disguised as " Gagnráðr " faces off with the wise jötunn Vafþrúðnir in a battle of wits . While Odin states that Vafþrúðnir knows all the fates of the gods , Odin asks Vafþrúðnir " from where Njörðr came to the sons of the Æsir , " that Njörðr rules over quite a lot of temples and <unk> ( a type of Germanic altar ) , and further adds that Njörðr was not raised among the Æsir . In response , Vafþrúðnir says : 
 " In Vanaheim the wise Powers made him 
 and gave him as hostage to the gods ; 
 at the doom of men he will come back 
 home among the wise Vanir . " 
 In stanza 16 of the poem Grímnismál , Njörðr is described as having a hall in Nóatún made for himself . The stanza describes Njörðr as a " prince of men , " that he is " lacking in malice , " and that he " rules over the " high @-@ timbered temple . " In stanza 43 , the creation of the god Freyr 's ship <unk> is recounted , and Freyr is cited as the son of Njörðr . In the prose introduction to the poem Skírnismál , Freyr is mentioned as the son of Njörðr , and stanza 2 cites the goddess Skaði as the mother of Freyr . Further in the poem , Njörðr is again mentioned as the father of Freyr in stanzas 38 , 39 , and 41 . 
 In the late flyting poem Lokasenna , an exchange between Njörðr and Loki occurs in stanzas 33 , 34 , 35 , and 36 . After Loki has an exchange with the goddess Freyja , in stanza 33 Njörðr states : 
 " That 's harmless , if , beside a husband , a woman has 
 a lover or someone else ; 
 what is surprising is a pervert god coming in here , 
 who has borne children . " 
 Loki responds in the stanza 34 , stating that " from here you were sent east as hostage to the gods " ( a reference to the Æsir @-@ Vanir War ) and that " the daughters of Hymir used you as a <unk> , and pissed in your mouth . " In stanza 35 , Njörðr responds that : 
 " That was my reward , when I , from far away , 
 was sent as a hostage to the gods , 
 that I fathered that son , whom no one hates 
 and is thought the prince of the Æsir . 
 Loki tells Njörðr to " stop " and " keep some moderation , " and that he " won 't keep it a secret any longer " that Njörðr 's son Freyr was produced with his unnamed sister , " though you 'd expect him to be worse than he is . " The god Tyr then interjects and the flyting continues in turn . 
 Njörðr is referenced in stanza 22 of the poem Þrymskviða , where he is referred to as the father of the goddess Freyja . In the poem , the jötunn Þrymr mistakenly thinks that he will be receiving the goddess Freyja as his bride , and while telling his fellow jötunn to spread straw on the benches in preparation for the arrival of Freyja , he refers to her as the daughter of Njörðr of Nóatún . Towards the end of the poem <unk> , Njörðr is cited as having nine daughters . Two of the names of these daughters are given ; the eldest <unk> and the youngest <unk> . 
 = = = Prose Edda = = = 
 Njörðr is mentioned in the Prose Edda books Gylfaginning and Skáldskaparmál . 
 = = = = Gylfaginning = = = = 
 In the Prose Edda , Njörðr is introduced in chapter 23 of the book Gylfaginning . In this chapter , Njörðr is described by the enthroned figure of High as living in the heavens at Nóatún , but also as ruling over the movement of the winds , having the ability to calm both sea and fire , and that he is to be invoked in seafaring and fishing . High continues that Njörðr is very wealthy and prosperous , and that he can also grant wealth in land and valuables to those who request his aid . Njörðr originates from <unk> and is devoid of Æsir stock , and he is described as having been traded with Hœnir in hostage exchange with between the Æsir and Vanir . 
 High further states that Njörðr 's wife is Skaði , that she is the daughter of the jötunn Þjazi , and recounts a tale involving the two . High recalls that Skaði wanted to live in the home once owned by her father called Þrymheimr ( " Thunder Home " ) . However , Njörðr wanted to live nearer to the sea . Subsequently , the two made an agreement that they would spend nine nights in Þrymheimr and then next three nights in Nóatún ( or nine winters in Þrymheimr and another nine in Nóatún according to the Codex Regius manuscript ) . However , when Njörðr returned from the mountains to Nóatún , he says : 
 " Hateful for me are the mountains , 
 I was not long there , 
 only nine nights . 
 The howling of the wolves 
 sounded ugly to me 
 after the song of the swans . " 
 Skaði then responds : 
 " Sleep I could not 
 on the sea beds 
 for the screeching of the bird . 
 That gull wakes me 
 when from the wide sea 
 he comes each morning . " 
 High states that afterward Skaði went back up to the mountains to Þrymheimr and recites a stanza where Skaði skis around , hunts animals with a bow , and lives in her fathers old house . Chapter 24 begins , which describes Njörðr as the father of two beautiful and powerful children : Freyr and Freyja . In chapter 37 , after Freyr has spotted the beautiful jötunn Gerðr , he becomes overcome with sorrow , and refuses to sleep , drink , or talk . Njörðr then sends for Skírnir to find out who he seems to be so angry at , and , not looking forward to being treated roughly , Skírnir reluctantly goes to Freyr . 
 = = = = Skáldskaparmál = = = = 
 Njörðr is introduced in Skáldskaparmál within a list of 12 Æsir attending a banquet held for Ægir . Further in Skáldskaparmál , the skaldic god Bragi <unk> the death of Skaði 's father Þjazi by the Æsir . As one of the three acts of reparation performed by the Æsir for Þjazi 's death , Skaði was allowed by the Æsir to choose a husband from amongst them , but given the stipulation that she may not see any part of them but their feet when making the selection . Expecting to choose the god Baldr by the beauty of the feet she selects , Skaði instead finds that she has picked Njörðr . 
 In chapter 6 , a list of kennings is provided for Njörðr : " God of chariots , " " Descendant of Vanir , " " a Van , " father of Freyr and Freyja , and " the giving god . " This is followed by an excerpt from a composition by the 11th century skald Þórðr Sjáreksson , explained as containing a reference to Skaði leaving Njörðr : 
 <unk> became her son 's slayer ; the wise god @-@ bride [ Skadi ] could not love the Van ; <unk> [ Odin ] trained horses pretty well ; <unk> is said not to have held back sword @-@ play . 
 Chapter 7 follows and provides various kennings for Freyr , including referring to him as the son of Njörðr . This is followed by an excerpt from a work by the 10th century skald Egill Skallagrímsson that references Njörðr ( here anglicized as " <unk> " ) : 
 For Freyr and <unk> have endowed <unk> with a power of wealth . 
 In chapter 20 , " daughter of Njörðr " is given as a kenning for Freyja . In chapter 33 , Njörðr is cited among the gods attending a banquet held by Ægir . In chapter 37 , Freyja is again referred to as Njörðr 's daughter in a verse by the 12th century skald Einarr Skúlason . In chapter 75 , Njörðr is included in a list of the Æsir . Additionally , Njörðr is used in kennings for " warrior " or " warriors " various times in Skáldskaparmál . 
 = = = Heimskringla = = = 
 Njörðr appears in or is mentioned in three Kings ' sagas collected in Heimskringla ; Ynglinga saga , the Saga of Hákon the Good and the Saga of Harald <unk> . In chapter 4 of Ynglinga saga , Njörðr is introduced in connection with the Æsir @-@ Vanir War . When the two sides became tired of war , they came to a peace agreement and exchanged hostages . For their part , the Vanir send to the Æsir their most " outstanding men " ; Njörðr , described as wealthy , and Freyr , described as his son , in exchange for the Æsir 's Hœnir . Additionally , the Æsir send Mímir in exchange for the wise Kvasir . 
 Further into chapter 4 , Odin appoints Njörðr and Freyr as priests of sacrificial offerings , and they became gods among the Æsir . Freyja is introduced as a daughter of Njörðr , and as the priestess at the sacrifices . In the saga , Njörðr is described as having once wed his unnamed sister while he was still among the Vanir , and the couple produced their children Freyr and Freyja from this union , though this custom was forbidden among the Æsir . 
 Chapter 5 relates that Odin gave all of his temple priests dwelling places and good estates , in Njörðr 's case being Nóatún . Chapter 8 states that Njörðr married a woman named Skaði , though she would not have intercourse with him . Skaði then marries Odin , and the two had numerous sons . 
 In chapter 9 , Odin dies and Njörðr takes over as ruler of the Swedes , and he continues the sacrifices . The Swedes recognize him as their king , and pay him tribute . Njörðr 's rule is marked with peace and many great crops , so much so that the Swedes believed that Njörðr held power over the crops and over the prosperity of mankind . During his rule , most of the Æsir die , their bodies are burned , and sacrifices are made by men to them . Njörðr has himself " marked for " Odin and he dies in his bed . Njörðr 's body is burnt by the Swedes , and they weep heavily at his tomb . After Njörðr 's reign , his son Freyr replaces him , and he is greatly loved and " blessed by good seasons like his father . " 
 In chapter 14 of Saga of Hákon the Good a description of the pagan Germanic custom of Yule is given . Part of the description includes a series of toasts . The toasts begin with Odin 's toasts , described as for victory and power for the king , followed by Njörðr and Freyr 's toast , intended for good harvests and peace . Following this , a beaker is drank for the king , and then a toast is given for departed kin . Chapter 28 quotes verse where the kenning " Njörðr @-@ of @-@ roller @-@ horses " is used for " sailor " . In the Saga of Harald <unk> , a stanza is given of a poem entitled <unk> ( " Lack of Gold " ) by the 10th century Icelandic skald Einarr <unk> that mentions Njörðr in a kenning for " warrior . " 
 = = = Egils saga = = = 
 In chapter 80 of the 13th century Icelandic saga Egils saga , Egill Skallagrímsson composes a poem in praise of <unk> ( <unk> ) . In stanza 17 , Egill writes that all others watch in marvel how <unk> gives out wealth , as he has been so endowed by the gods Freyr and Njörðr . 
 = = Modern folk practice = = 
 Veneration of Njörðr survived into 18th or 19th century Norwegian folk practice , as recorded in a tale collected by <unk> O. Opedal from an informant in Odda , Hordaland , Norway . The informant comments on a family tradition in which the god is thanked for a bountiful catch of fish : 
 The old folk [ folk in the olden days ? ] were always rather lucky when they went fishing . One night old Gunnhild <unk> ( born in 1746 ) and Johannes <unk> were fishing in the <unk> . They had taken a torch and were fishing with live bait . The fish bit well , and it wasn 't long before Gunnhild had a week 's supply of fish for her pot . So she wound her line around her rod with the words : " Thanks be to him , to <unk> , for this time . " 
 Scholar Georges Dumézil further cites various tales of <unk> ( Norwegian " sea people " ) who govern over sea weather , wealth , or , in some incidents , give magic boats are likely connected to Njörðr . 
 = = Theories = = 
 = = = Nerthus = = = 
 Njörðr is often identified with the goddess Nerthus , whose reverence by various Germanic tribes is described by Roman historian Tacitus in his 1st CE century work Germania . The connection between the two is due to the linguistic relationship between Njörðr and the reconstructed * Nerþuz , " Nerthus " being the feminine , Latinized form of what Njörðr would have looked like around 1 CE . This has led to theories about the relation of the two , including that Njörðr may have once been a hermaphroditic god or , generally considered more likely , that the name may indicate an otherwise unattested divine brother and sister pair such as Freyr and Freyja . Consequently , Nerthus has been identified with Njörðr 's unnamed sister with whom he had Freyja and Freyr , which is mentioned in Lokasenna . 
 = = = Bieka @-@ Galles = = = 
 In Saami mythology , Bieka @-@ Galles ( or <unk> , <unk> @-@ Galles , depending on dialect ; " The Old Man of the Winds " ) is a deity who rules over rain and wind , and is the subject of boat and wooden shovel ( or , rather , oar ) offerings . Due to similarities in between descriptions of Njörðr in Gylfaginning and descriptions of Bieka @-@ Galles in 18th century missionary reports , Axel <unk> identified this deity as the result of influence from the seafaring North Germanic peoples on the <unk> Saami . 
 = = = Hadingus = = = 
 Parallels have been pointed out between Njörðr and the figure of Hadingus , attested in book I of Saxo Grammaticus ' 13th century work Gesta Danorum . Some of these similarities include that , in parallel to Skaði and Njörðr in Skáldskaparmál , Hadingus is chosen by his wife <unk> after selecting him from other men at a banquet by his lower legs , and , in parallel to Skaði and Njörðr in Gylfaginning , Hadingus complains in verse of his displeasure at his life away from the sea and how he is disturbed by the howls of wolves , while his wife <unk> complains of life at the shore and states her annoyance at the screeching sea birds . Georges Dumézil theorized that in the tale Hadingus passes through all three functions of his trifunctional hypothesis , before ending as an Odinic hero , paralleling Njörðr 's passing from the Vanir to the Æsir in the Æsir @-@ Vanir War . 
 = = = Svafrþorinn = = = 
 In stanza 8 of the poem Fjölsvinnsmál , Svafrþorinn is stated as the father of Menglöð by an unnamed mother , who the hero Svipdagr seeks . Menglöð has often been theorized as the goddess Freyja , and according to this theory , Svafrþorinn would therefore be Njörðr . The theory is complicated by the etymology of the name Svafrþorinn ( <unk> meaning " brave " and <unk> means " gossip " ) ( or possibly connects to sofa " sleep " ) , which Rudolf Simek says makes little sense when attempting to connect it to Njörðr . 
 = = Modern influence = = 
 Njörðr has been the subject of an amount of artistic depictions . Depictions include " Freyr und Gerda ; Skade und Niurd " ( drawing , 1883 ) by K. Ehrenberg , " Njörðr " ( 1893 ) by Carl Frederick von <unk> , " Skadi " ( 1901 ) by E. Doepler d . J. , and " <unk> 's desire of the Sea " ( 1908 ) by W. G. Collingwood . 
 Njörðr is one of the incarnated gods in the New Zealand comedy / drama " The Almighty Johnsons " . The part of " Johan Johnson / Njörðr " is played by Stuart <unk> . 
 = Psilocybin = 
 Psilocybin ( / <unk> / SIL @-@ ə @-@ SY @-@ bin ) is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound produced by more than 200 species of mushrooms , collectively known as psilocybin mushrooms . The most potent are members of the genus Psilocybe , such as P. azurescens , P. semilanceata , and P. cyanescens , but psilocybin has also been isolated from about a dozen other genera . As a prodrug , psilocybin is quickly converted by the body to psilocin , which has mind @-@ altering effects similar , in some aspects , to those of LSD , mescaline , and DMT . In general , the effects include euphoria , visual and mental hallucinations , changes in perception , a distorted sense of time , and spiritual experiences , and can include possible adverse reactions such as nausea and panic attacks . 
 Imagery found on prehistoric murals and rock paintings of modern @-@ day Spain and Algeria suggests that human usage of psilocybin mushrooms dates back thousands of years . In Mesoamerica , the mushrooms had long been consumed in spiritual and divinatory ceremonies before Spanish chroniclers first documented their use in the 16th century . In a 1957 Life magazine article , American banker and ethnomycologist R. Gordon Wasson described his experiences ingesting psilocybin @-@ containing mushrooms during a traditional ceremony in Mexico , introducing the substance to popular culture . Shortly afterward , the Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann isolated the active principle psilocybin from the mushroom Psilocybe mexicana . Hofmann 's employer Sandoz marketed and sold pure psilocybin to physicians and clinicians worldwide for use in psychedelic psychotherapy . Although the increasingly restrictive drug laws of the late 1960s curbed scientific research into the effects of psilocybin and other hallucinogens , its popularity as an entheogen ( spirituality @-@ enhancing agent ) grew in the next decade , owing largely to the increased availability of information on how to cultivate psilocybin mushrooms . 
 Some users of the drug consider it an entheogen and a tool to supplement practices for transcendence , including meditation and <unk> . The intensity and duration of the effects of psilocybin are variable , depending on species or cultivar of mushrooms , dosage , individual physiology , and set and setting , as was shown in experiments led by Timothy Leary at Harvard University in the early 1960s . Once ingested , psilocybin is rapidly metabolized to psilocin , which then acts on serotonin receptors in the brain . The mind @-@ altering effects of psilocybin typically last from two to six hours , although to individuals under the influence of psilocybin , the effects may seem to last much longer , since the drug can distort the perception of time . Psilocybin has a low toxicity and a relatively low harm potential , and reports of lethal doses of the drug are rare . Several modern <unk> methods have been adapted to rapidly and accurately screen the levels of psilocybin in mushroom samples and body fluids . Since the 1990s , there has been a renewal of scientific research into the potential medical and psychological therapeutic benefits of psilocybin for treating conditions including obsessive @-@ compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , cluster headaches , and anxiety related to terminal cancer . Possession of psilocybin @-@ containing mushrooms has been outlawed in most countries , and it has been classified as a scheduled drug by many national drug laws . 
 = = Effects = = 
 The effects of psilocybin are highly variable and depend on the mindset and environment in which the user has the experience , factors commonly referred to as set and setting . In the early 1960s , Timothy Leary and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of psilocybin . They administered the drug to 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room . Ninety @-@ eight of the subjects were given questionnaires to assess their experiences and the contribution of background and situational factors . Individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom the drug was novel . Group size , dosage , preparation , and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response . In general , those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that the groups were less supportive , and their experiences were less pleasant . Conversely , smaller groups ( fewer than six individuals ) were seen as more supportive . Participants also reported having more positive reactions to the drug in those groups . Leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens suggestibility , making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli . These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge ( 1999 ) , who concluded that dosage , set , and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists ' creativity . 
 After ingesting psilocybin , a wide range of subjective effects may be experienced : feelings of disorientation , lethargy , giddiness , euphoria , joy , and depression . About a third of users report feelings of anxiety or paranoia . Low doses of the drug can induce hallucinatory effects . Closed @-@ eye hallucinations may occur , in which the affected individual sees multicolored geometric shapes and vivid imaginative sequences . Some individuals report experiencing synesthesia , such as tactile sensations when viewing colors . At higher doses , psilocybin can lead to " Intensification of affective responses , enhanced ability for introspection , regression to primitive and childlike thinking , and activation of vivid memory traces with pronounced emotional undertones " . Open @-@ eye visual hallucinations are common , and may be very detailed although rarely confused with reality . 
 A 2011 prospective study by Roland R. Griffiths and colleagues suggests that a single high dosage of psilocybin can cause long @-@ term changes in the personality of its users . About half of the study participants — described as healthy , " spiritually active " , and many possessing postgraduate degrees — showed an increase in the personality dimension of openness ( assessed using the Revised NEO Personality Inventory ) , and this positive effect was apparent more than a year after the psilocybin session . According to the study authors , the finding is significant because " no study has prospectively demonstrated personality change in healthy adults after an experimentally manipulated discrete event . " Although other researchers have described instances of psychedelic drug usage leading to new psychological understandings and personal insights , it is not known whether these experimental results can be generalized to larger populations .

 Common responses include : pupil dilation ( 93 % ) ; changes in heart rate ( 100 % ) , including increases ( 56 % ) , decreases ( 13 % ) , and variable responses ( 31 % ) ; changes in blood pressure ( 84 % ) , including hypotension ( 34 % ) , hypertension ( 28 % ) , and general instability ( 22 % ) ; changes in stretch reflex ( 86 % ) , including increases ( 80 % ) and decreases ( 6 % ) ; nausea ( 44 % ) ; tremor ( 25 % ) ; and <unk> ( 16 % ) ( inability to properly direct or limit motions ) . The temporary increases in blood pressure caused by the drug can be a risk factor for users with pre @-@ existing hypertension . These qualitative somatic effects caused by psilocybin have been corroborated by several early clinical studies . A 2005 magazine survey of club goers in the UK found that nausea or vomiting was experienced by over a quarter of those who had used hallucinogenic mushrooms in the last year , although this effect is caused by the mushroom rather than psilocybin itself . In one study , administration of gradually increasing dosages of psilocybin daily for 21 days had no measurable effect on electrolyte levels , blood sugar levels , or liver toxicity tests . 
 = = = Perceptual distortions = = = 
 Psilocybin is known to strongly influence the subjective experience of the passage of time . Users often feel as if time is slowed down , resulting in the perception that " minutes appear to be hours " or " time is standing still " . Studies have demonstrated that psilocybin significantly impairs subjects ' ability to gauge time intervals longer than 2 @.@ 5 seconds , impairs their ability to synchronize to inter @-@ beat intervals longer than 2 seconds , and reduces their preferred tapping rate . These results are consistent with the drug 's role in affecting prefrontal cortex activity , and the role that the prefrontal cortex is known to play in time perception . However , the neurochemical basis of psilocybin 's effects on the perception of time are not known with certainty . 
 Users having a pleasant experience can feel a sense of connection to others , nature , and the universe ; other perceptions and emotions are also often intensified . Users having an unpleasant experience ( a " bad trip " ) describe a reaction accompanied by fear , other unpleasant feelings , and occasionally by dangerous behavior . In general , the phrase " bad trip " is used to describe a reaction that is characterized primarily by fear or other unpleasant emotions , not just transitory experience of such feelings . A variety of factors may contribute to a psilocybin user experiencing a bad trip , including " tripping " during an emotional or physical low or in a non @-@ supportive environment ( see : set and setting ) . Ingesting psilocybin in combination with other drugs , including alcohol , can also increase the likelihood of a bad trip . Other than the duration of the experience , the effects of psilocybin are similar to comparable dosages of LSD or mescaline . However , in the <unk> Encyclopedia , author Peter Stafford noted , " The psilocybin experience seems to be warmer , not as forceful and less isolating . It tends to build connections between people , who are generally much more in communication than when they use LSD . "

 Psilocybin mushrooms have been and continue to be used in indigenous New World cultures in religious , divinatory , or spiritual contexts . Reflecting the meaning of the word entheogen ( " the god within " ) , the mushrooms are revered as powerful spiritual sacraments that provide access to sacred worlds . Typically used in small group community settings , they enhance group cohesion and reaffirm traditional values . Terence McKenna documented the worldwide practices of psilocybin mushroom usage as part of a cultural ethos relating to the Earth and mysteries of nature , and suggested that mushrooms enhanced self @-@ awareness and a sense of contact with a " Transcendent Other " — reflecting a deeper understanding of our connectedness with nature . 
 Psychedelic drugs can induce states of consciousness that have lasting personal meaning and spiritual significance in individuals who are religious or spiritually inclined ; these states are called mystical experiences . Some scholars have proposed that many of the qualities of a drug @-@ induced mystical experience are indistinguishable from mystical experiences achieved through non @-@ drug techniques , such as meditation or <unk> <unk> . In the 1960s , Walter Pahnke and colleagues systematically evaluated mystical experiences ( which they called " mystical consciousness " ) by categorizing their common features . These categories , according to Pahnke , " describe the core of a universal psychological experience , free from culturally determined philosophical or theological interpretations " , and allow researchers to assess mystical experiences on a qualitative , numerical scale . 
 In the 1962 Marsh Chapel Experiment , which was run by Pahnke at the Harvard Divinity School under the supervision of Timothy Leary , almost all of the graduate degree divinity student volunteers who received psilocybin reported profound religious experiences . One of the participants was religious scholar Huston Smith , author of several textbooks on comparative religion ; he later described his experience as " the most powerful cosmic homecoming I have ever experienced . " In a 25 @-@ year followup to the experiment , all of the subjects given psilocybin described their experience as having elements of " a genuine mystical nature and characterized it as one of the high points of their spiritual life " . Psychedelic researcher Rick Doblin considered the study partially flawed due to incorrect implementation of the double @-@ blind procedure , and several imprecise questions in the mystical experience questionnaire . Nevertheless , he said that the study cast " a considerable doubt on the assertion that mystical experiences catalyzed by drugs are in any way inferior to non @-@ drug mystical experiences in both their immediate content and long @-@ term effects " . This sentiment was echoed by psychiatrist William A. Richards , who in a 2007 review stated " [ psychedelic ] mushroom use may constitute one technology for evoking revelatory experiences that are similar , if not identical , to those that occur through so @-@ called spontaneous alterations of brain chemistry . " 
 A group of researchers from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine led by Griffiths conducted a study to assess the immediate and long @-@ term psychological effects of the psilocybin experience , using a modified version of the mystical experience questionnaire and a rigorous double @-@ blind procedure . When asked in an interview about the similarity of his work with Leary 's , Griffiths explained the difference : " We are conducting rigorous , systematic research with psilocybin under carefully monitored conditions , a route which Dr. Leary abandoned in the early 1960s . " The National Institute of Drug Abuse @-@ funded study , published in 2006 , has been praised by experts for the soundness of its experimental design . In the experiment , 36 volunteers without prior experience with hallucinogens were given psilocybin and methylphenidate ( Ritalin ) in separate sessions ; the methylphenidate sessions served as a control and psychoactive placebo . The degree of mystical experience was measured using a questionnaire developed by Ralph W. Hood ; 61 % of subjects reported a " complete mystical experience " after their psilocybin session , while only 13 % reported such an outcome after their experience with methylphenidate . Two months after taking psilocybin , 79 % of the participants reported moderately to greatly increased life satisfaction and sense of well @-@ being . About 36 % of participants also had a strong to extreme " experience of fear " or dysphoria ( i.e. , a " bad trip " ) at some point during the psilocybin session ( which was not reported by any subject during the methylphenidate session ) ; about one @-@ third of these ( 13 % of the total ) reported that this dysphoria dominated the entire session . These negative effects were reported to be easily managed by the researchers and did not have a lasting negative effect on the subject 's sense of well @-@ being . 
 A follow @-@ up study conducted 14 months after the original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience . Almost one @-@ third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives , and over two @-@ thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events . About two @-@ thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well @-@ being or life satisfaction . Even after 14 months , those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of Openness / Intellect ; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults . Likewise , in a recent ( 2010 ) web @-@ based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the benefits and harms of hallucinogenic drug use , 60 % of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long @-@ term positive impact on their sense of well @-@ being . 
 In 2011 , Griffiths and colleagues published the results of further studies designed to learn more about the optimum psilocybin doses needed for positive life @-@ changing experiences , while minimizing the chance of negative reactions . In a 14 @-@ month followup , the researchers found that 94 % of the volunteers rated their experiences with the drug as one of the top five most spiritually significant of their lives ( 44 % said it was the single most significant ) . None of the 90 sessions that took place throughout the study were rated as decreasing well @-@ being or life satisfaction . Moreover , 89 % reported positive changes in their behaviors as a result of the experiences . The conditions of the experimental design included a single drug experience a month , on a couch , in a living @-@ room @-@ like setting , with eye shades and carefully chosen music ( classical and world music ) . As an additional precaution to guide the experience , as with the 2006 study , the 2011 study included a " monitor " or " guide " whom the volunteers supposedly trusted . The monitors provided gentle reassurance when the volunteers experienced anxiety . The volunteers and monitors all remained blind to the exact dosages for the purpose of the experiment . 
 = = = Available forms = = = 
 Although psilocybin may be prepared synthetically , outside of the research setting , it is not typically used in this form . The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways : by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies , by preparing a herbal tea , or by combining with other foods to mask the bitter taste . In rare cases people have injected mushroom extracts intravenously . 
 = = Adverse effects = = 
 Most of the comparatively few fatal incidents reported in the literature that are associated with psychedelic mushroom usage involve the simultaneous use of other drugs , especially alcohol . Probably the most common cause of hospital admissions resulting from psychedelic mushroom usage involve " bad trips " or panic reactions , in which affected individuals become extremely anxious , confused , agitated , or disoriented . Accidents , self @-@ injury , or suicide attempts can result from serious cases of acute psychotic episodes . Although no studies have linked psilocybin with birth defects , it is recommended that pregnant women avoid its usage . 
 = = = Toxicity = = = 
 The toxicity of psilocybin is low . In rats , the median lethal dose ( LD50 ) when administered orally is 280 milligrams per kilogram ( mg / kg ) , approximately one and a half times that of caffeine . When administered intravenously in rabbits , psilocybin 's LD50 is approximately 12 @.@ 5 mg / kg . Psilocybin comprises approximately 1 % of the weight of Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms , and so nearly 1 @.@ 7 kilograms ( 3 @.@ 7 lb ) of dried mushrooms , or 17 kilograms ( 37 lb ) of fresh mushrooms , would be required for a 60 @-@ kilogram ( 130 lb ) person to reach the 280 mg / kg LD50 value of rats . Based on the results of animal studies , the lethal dose of psilocybin has been extrapolated to be 6 grams , 1000 times greater than the effective dose of 6 milligrams . The Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances assigns psilocybin a relatively high therapeutic index of 641 ( higher values correspond to a better safety profile ) ; for comparison , the therapeutic indices of aspirin and nicotine are 199 and 21 , respectively . The lethal dose from psilocybin toxicity alone is unknown at recreational or medicinal levels , and has rarely been documented — as of 2011 , only two cases attributed to overdosing on hallucinogenic mushrooms ( without concurrent use of other drugs ) have been reported in the scientific literature and may involve other factors aside from psilocybin . 
 = = = Psychiatric = = = 
 Panic reactions can occur after consumption of psilocybin @-@ containing mushrooms , especially if the ingestion is accidental or otherwise unexpected . Reactions characterized by violent behavior , suicidal thoughts , schizophrenia @-@ like psychosis , and convulsions have been reported in the literature . A 2005 survey conducted in the United Kingdom found that almost a quarter of those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the past year had experienced a panic attack . Other adverse effects less frequently reported include paranoia , confusion , prolonged derealization ( disconnection from reality ) , and mania . Psilocybin usage can temporarily induce a state of depersonalization disorder . Usage by those with schizophrenia can induce acute psychotic states requiring hospitalization . 
 Recent evidence , however , has suggested against the contention that the use of psilocybin puts one at risk for developing long lasting mental disorders . An analysis of information from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health showed that the use of psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin is associated with significantly reduced odds of past month psychological distress , past year suicidal thinking , past year suicidal planning , and past year suicide attempt . 
 The similarity of psilocybin @-@ induced symptoms to those of schizophrenia has made the drug a useful research tool in behavioral and neuroimaging studies of this psychotic disorder . In both cases , psychotic symptoms are thought to arise from a " deficient gating of sensory and cognitive information " in the brain that ultimately lead to " cognitive fragmentation and psychosis " . Flashbacks ( spontaneous recurrences of a previous psilocybin experience ) can occur long after having used psilocybin mushrooms . <unk> persisting perception disorder ( HPPD ) is characterized by a continual presence of visual disturbances similar to those generated by psychedelic substances . Neither flashbacks nor HPPD are commonly associated with psilocybin usage , and correlations between HPPD and psychedelics are further obscured by <unk> use and other variables . 
 = = = Tolerance and dependence = = = 
 Tolerance to psilocybin builds and dissipates quickly ; ingesting psilocybin more than about once a week can lead to diminished effects . Tolerance dissipates after a few days , so doses can be spaced several days apart to avoid the effect . A cross @-@ tolerance can develop between psilocybin and the pharmacologically similar LSD , and between psilocybin and phenethylamines such as mescaline and DOM . 
 Repeated use of psilocybin does not lead to physical dependence . A 2008 study concluded that , based on US data from the period 2000 – 2002 , adolescent @-@ onset ( defined here as ages 11 – 17 ) usage of hallucinogenic drugs ( including psilocybin ) did not increase the risk of drug dependence in adulthood ; this was in contrast to adolescent usage of cannabis , cocaine , <unk> , anxiolytic medicines , and stimulants , all of which were associated with " an excess risk of developing clinical features associated with drug dependence " . Likewise , a 2010 Dutch study ranked the relative harm of psilocybin mushrooms compared to a selection of 19 recreational drugs , including alcohol , cannabis , cocaine , ecstasy , heroin , and tobacco . Psilocybin mushrooms were ranked as the illicit drug with the lowest harm , corroborating conclusions reached earlier by expert groups in the United Kingdom . 
 = = Interactions = = 
 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOI ) have been known to prolong and enhance the effects of psilocybin . Alcohol consumption may enhance the effects of psilocybin , because acetaldehyde , one of the primary breakdown metabolites of consumed alcohol , reacts with biogenic amines present in the body to produce MAOIs related to <unk> and β @-@ carboline . Tobacco smokers may also experience more powerful effects with psilocybin , because tobacco smoke exposure decreases levels of MAO in the brain and peripheral organs .

 = = = Pharmacodynamics = = = 
 Psilocybin is rapidly <unk> in the body to psilocin , which is a partial agonist for several serotonergic receptors . Psilocin has a high affinity for the 5 @-@ HT2A serotonin receptor in the brain , where it mimics the effects of serotonin ( 5 @-@ <unk> , or 5 @-@ HT ) . Psilocin binds less tightly to other serotonergic receptors 5 @-@ HT1A , 5 @-@ <unk> , and 5 @-@ <unk> . Serotonin receptors are located in numerous parts of the brain , including the cerebral cortex , and are involved in a wide range of functions , including regulation of mood and motivation . The psychotomimetic ( psychosis @-@ mimicking ) effects of psilocin can be blocked in a dose @-@ dependent fashion by the 5 @-@ HT2A antagonist drugs <unk> and risperidone . Although the 5 @-@ HT2A receptor is responsible for most of the effects of psilocin , various lines of evidence have shown that interactions with non @-@ 5 @-@ HT2A receptors also contribute to the subjective and behavioral effects of the drug . For example , psilocin indirectly increases the concentration of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the basal ganglia , and some psychotomimetic symptoms of psilocin are reduced by haloperidol , a non @-@ selective dopamine receptor antagonist . Taken together , these suggest that there may be an indirect dopaminergic contribution to psilocin 's psychotomimetic effects . In contrast to LSD , which binds to dopamine receptor D2 , psilocybin and psilocin have no affinity for the dopamine D2 receptors . 
 = = = Pharmacokinetics = = = 
 The effects of the drug begin 10 – 40 minutes after ingestion , and last 2 – 6 hours depending on dose , species , and individual metabolism . The half life of psilocybin is 163 ± 64 minutes when taken orally , or 74 @.@ 1 ± 19 @.@ 6 minutes when injected intravenously . A dosage of 4 – 10 mg , corresponding roughly to 50 – 300 micrograms per kilogram ( µg / kg ) of body weight , is required to induce psychedelic effects . A typical recreational dosage is 10 – 50 mg psilocybin , which is roughly equivalent to 10 – 50 grams of fresh mushrooms , or 1 – 5 grams of dried mushrooms . A small number of people are unusually sensitive to psilocybin , such that a normally threshold @-@ level dose of about 2 mg can result in effects usually associated with medium or high doses . In contrast , there are some who require relatively high doses to experience noticeable effects . Individual brain chemistry and metabolism play a large role in determining a person 's response to psilocybin . 
 Psilocybin is metabolized mostly in the liver . As it becomes converted to psilocin , it undergoes a first @-@ pass effect , whereby its concentration is greatly reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation . Psilocin is broken down by the enzyme monoamine oxidase to produce several metabolites that can circulate in the blood plasma , including 4 @-@ hydroxyindole @-@ 3 @-@ acetaldehyde , 4 @-@ <unk> , and 4 @-@ hydroxyindole @-@ 3 @-@ acetic acid . Some psilocin is not broken down by enzymes and instead forms a glucuronide ; this is a biochemical mechanism animals use to eliminate toxic substances by linking them with glucuronic acid , which can then be excreted in the urine . Psilocin is <unk> by the <unk> enzymes <unk> in the liver , and by <unk> in the small intestine . Based on studies using animals , about 50 % of ingested psilocybin is absorbed through the stomach and intestine . Within 24 hours , about 65 % of the absorbed psilocybin is excreted into the urine , and a further 15 – 20 % is excreted in the bile and feces . Although most of the remaining drug is eliminated in this way within 8 hours , it is still detectable in the urine after 7 days . Clinical studies show that psilocin concentrations in the plasma of adults average about 8 µg / liter within 2 hours after ingestion of a single 15 mg oral psilocybin dose ; psychological effects occur with a blood plasma concentration of 4 – 6 µg / liter . Psilocybin is about 100 times less potent than LSD on a weight per weight basis , and the physiological effects last about half as long .

 Psilocybin ( O @-@ phosphoryl @-@ 4 @-@ hydroxy @-@ N , N @-@ dimethyltryptamine or 4 @-@ PO @-@ DMT ) is a prodrug that is converted into the pharmacologically active compound psilocin in the body by a <unk> reaction . This chemical reaction takes place under strongly acidic conditions , or under physiological conditions in the body , through the action of enzymes called alkaline phosphatases . 
 Psilocybin is a tryptamine compound with a chemical structure containing an indole ring linked to an <unk> substituent . It is chemically related to the amino acid tryptophan , and is structurally similar to the neurotransmitter serotonin . Psilocybin is a member of the general class of tryptophan @-@ based compounds that originally functioned as antioxidants in earlier life forms before assuming more complex functions in multicellular organisms , including humans . Other related indole @-@ containing psychedelic compounds include dimethyltryptamine , found in many plant species and in trace amounts in some mammals , and <unk> , found in the skin of psychoactive toads . <unk> , the biochemical transformation from tryptophan to psilocybin involves several enzyme reactions : decarboxylation , methylation at the N9 position , 4 @-@ hydroxylation , and O @-@ phosphorylation . Isotopic labeling experiments suggest that tryptophan decarboxylation is the initial biosynthetic step and that O @-@ phosphorylation is the final step . The precise sequence of the intermediate enzymatic steps is not known with certainty , and the biosynthetic pathway may differ between species . 
 Psilocybin is an alkaloid that is soluble in water , methanol and aqueous ethanol , but insoluble in organic solvents like chloroform and petroleum ether . Its pKa values are estimated to be 1 @.@ 3 and 6 @.@ 5 for the two successive phosphate OH groups and 10 @.@ 4 for the dimethylamine nitrogen , so in general it exists as a <unk> structure . Exposure to light is detrimental to the stability of aqueous solutions of psilocybin , and will cause it to rapidly oxidize — an important consideration when using it as an analytical standard . Osamu <unk> and colleagues reported a method for the large @-@ scale synthesis of psilocybin without chromatographic purification in 2003 . Starting with 4 @-@ hydroxyindole , they generated psilocybin from psilocin in 85 % yield , a marked improvement over yields reported from previous syntheses . Purified psilocybin is a white , needle @-@ like crystalline powder with a melting point between 220 – 228 ° C ( 428 – 442 ° F ) , and a slightly ammonia @-@ like taste . 
 = = = Analytical methods = = = 
 Several relatively simple chemical tests — commercially available as reagent testing kits — can be used to assess the presence of psilocybin in extracts prepared from mushrooms . The drug reacts in the Marquis test to produce a yellow color , and a green color in the Mandelin test . Neither of these tests , however , is specific for psilocybin ; for example , the Marquis test will react with many classes of controlled drugs , such as those containing primary amino groups and unsubstituted benzene rings , including amphetamine and methamphetamine . Ehrlich 's reagent and <unk> reagent are used as chemical sprays to detect the drug after thin layer chromatography . Many modern techniques of analytical chemistry have been used to quantify psilocybin levels in mushroom samples . Although the earliest methods commonly used gas chromatography , the high temperature required to vaporize the psilocybin sample prior to analysis causes it to spontaneously lose its phosphoryl group and become psilocin — making it difficult to chemically discriminate between the two drugs . In forensic toxicology , techniques involving gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry ( GC – MS ) are the most widely used due to their high sensitivity and ability to separate compounds in complex biological mixtures . These techniques include ion mobility spectrometry , capillary zone electrophoresis , ultraviolet spectroscopy , and infrared spectroscopy . High performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) is used with ultraviolet , fluorescence , electrochemical , and electrospray mass <unk> detection methods . 
 Various chromatographic methods have been developed to detect psilocin in body fluids : the rapid emergency drug identification system ( <unk> HS ) , a drug screening method based on HPLC ; HPLC with electrochemical detection ; GC – MS ; and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry . Although the determination of psilocin levels in urine can be performed without sample clean @-@ up ( i.e. , removing potential contaminants that make it difficult to accurately assess concentration ) , the analysis in plasma or serum requires a preliminary extraction , followed by <unk> of the extracts in the case of GC – MS. A specific immunoassay has also been developed to detect psilocin in whole blood samples . A 2009 publication reported using HPLC to quickly separate forensically important illicit drugs including psilocybin and psilocin , which were identifiable within about half a minute of analysis time . These analytical techniques to determine psilocybin concentrations in body fluids are , however , not routinely available , and not typically used in clinical settings .

 Psilocybin is present in varying concentrations in over 200 species of Basidiomycota mushrooms . In a 2000 review on the worldwide distribution of hallucinogenic mushrooms , Gastón Guzmán and colleagues considered these to be distributed amongst the following genera : Psilocybe ( 116 species ) , Gymnopilus ( 14 ) , Panaeolus ( 13 ) , <unk> ( 12 ) , Hypholoma ( 6 ) , Pluteus ( 6 ) , Inocybe ( 6 ) , Conocybe ( 4 ) , <unk> ( 4 ) , Gerronema ( 2 ) and <unk> , Galerina and Mycena ( 1 species each ) . Guzmán increased his estimate of the number of psilocybin @-@ containing Psilocybe to 144 species in a 2005 review . The majority of these are found in Mexico ( 53 species ) , with the remainder distributed in the US and Canada ( 22 ) , Europe ( 16 ) , Asia ( 15 ) , Africa ( 4 ) , and Australia and associated islands ( 19 ) . In general , psilocybin @-@ containing species are dark @-@ spored , gilled mushrooms that grow in meadows and woods of the subtropics and tropics , usually in soils rich in humus and plant debris . Psilocybin mushrooms occur on all continents , but the majority of species are found in subtropical humid forests . Psilocybe species commonly found in the tropics include P. cubensis and P. subcubensis . P. semilanceata — considered by Guzmán to be the world 's most widely distributed psilocybin mushroom — is found in Europe , North America , Asia , South America , Australia and New Zealand , but is entirely absent from Mexico . Although the presence or absence of psilocybin is not of much use as a <unk> marker at the familial level or higher , it is used to classify taxa of lower taxonomic groups . 
 Both the caps and the stems contain the psychoactive compounds , although the caps consistently contain more . The spores of these mushrooms do not contain psilocybin or psilocin . The total potency varies greatly between species and even between specimens of a species collected or grown from the same strain . Because most psilocybin biosynthesis occurs early in the formation of fruit bodies or sclerotia , younger , smaller mushrooms tend to have a higher concentration of the drug than larger , mature mushrooms . In general , the psilocybin content of mushrooms is quite variable ( ranging from almost nothing to 1 @.@ 5 % of the dry weight ) and depends on species , strain , growth and drying conditions , and mushroom size . Cultivated mushrooms have less variability in psilocybin content than wild mushrooms . The drug is more stable in dried than fresh mushrooms ; dried mushrooms retain their potency for months or even years , while mushrooms stored fresh for four weeks contain only traces of the original psilocybin . The psilocybin contents of dried herbarium specimens of Psilocybe semilanceata in one study were shown to decrease with the increasing age of the sample : collections dated 11 , 33 , or 118 years old contained 0 @.@ 84 % , 0 @.@ 67 % , and 0 @.@ 014 % ( all dry weight ) , respectively . Mature mycelia contain some psilocybin , while young mycelia ( recently germinated from spores ) lack appreciable amounts . Many species of mushrooms containing psilocybin also contain lesser amounts of the analog compounds baeocystin and <unk> , chemicals thought to be biogenic precursors . Although most species of psilocybin @-@ containing mushrooms bruise blue when handled or damaged due to the <unk> of phenolic compounds , this reaction is not a definitive method of identification or determining a mushroom 's potency .

 There is evidence to suggest that psychoactive mushrooms have been used by humans in religious ceremonies for thousands of years . Murals dated 9000 to 7000 BCE found in the Sahara desert in southeast Algeria depict horned beings dressed as dancers , clothed in garb decorated with geometrical designs , and holding mushroom @-@ like objects . Parallel lines extend from the mushroom shapes to the center of the dancers ' heads . 6 @,@ 000 @-@ year @-@ old pictographs discovered near the Spanish town of Villar del Humo illustrate several mushrooms that have been tentatively identified as Psilocybe hispanica , a hallucinogenic species native to the area . 
 Archaeological artifacts from Mexico , as well as the so @-@ called Mayan " mushroom stones " of Guatemala have also been interpreted by some scholars as evidence for ritual and ceremonial usage of psychoactive mushrooms in the Mayan and Aztec cultures of Mesoamerica . In Nahuatl , the language of the Aztecs , the mushrooms were called teonanácatl , or " God 's flesh " . Following the arrival of Spanish explorers to the New World in the 16th century , chroniclers reported the use of mushrooms by the natives for ceremonial and religious purposes . According to the Dominican friar Diego Durán in The History of the Indies of New Spain ( published c . 1581 ) , mushrooms were eaten in festivities conducted on the occasion of the accession to the throne of Aztec emperor Moctezuma II in 1502 . The Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún wrote of witnessing mushroom usage in his Florentine Codex ( published 1545 – 1590 ) , and described how some merchants would celebrate upon returning from a successful business trip by consuming mushrooms to evoke revelatory visions . After the defeat of the Aztecs , the Spanish forbade traditional religious practices and rituals that they considered " pagan idolatry " , including ceremonial mushroom use . For the next four centuries , the Indians of Mesoamerica hid their use of <unk> from the Spanish authorities . 
 Although dozens of species of psychedelic mushrooms are found in Europe , there is little documented usage of these species in Old World history . The few existing historical accounts about psilocybin mushrooms typically lack sufficient information to allow species identification , and usually refer to the nature of their effects . For example , Flemish botanist Carolus Clusius ( 1526 – 1609 ) described the <unk> <unk> ( crazy mushroom ) , used in rural Hungary to prepare love potions . English botanist John Parkinson included details about a " foolish mushroom " in his 1640 herbal <unk> Botanicum . The first reliably documented report of intoxication with Psilocybe semilanceata — Europe 's most common and widespread psychedelic mushroom — involved a British family in 1799 , who prepared a meal with mushrooms they had picked in London 's Green Park .

 American banker and amateur ethnomycologist R. Gordon Wasson and his wife Valentina studied the ritual use of psychoactive mushrooms by the native population in the Mazatec village Huautla de Jiménez . In 1957 , Wasson described the psychedelic visions that he experienced during these rituals in " Seeking the Magic Mushroom " , an article published in the popular American weekly Life magazine . Later the same year they were accompanied on a follow @-@ up expedition by French mycologist Roger Heim , who identified several of the mushrooms as Psilocybe species . Heim cultivated the mushrooms in France , and sent samples for analysis to Albert Hofmann , a chemist employed by the Swiss multinational pharmaceutical company Sandoz ( now Novartis ) . Hofmann , who had in 1938 created LSD , led a research group that isolated and identified the psychoactive compounds from Psilocybe mexicana . Hofmann was aided in the discovery process by his willingness to ingest mushroom extracts to help verify the presence of the active compounds . He and his colleagues later synthesized a number of compounds chemically related to the naturally occurring psilocybin , to see how structural changes would affect psychoactivity . The new molecules differed from psilocybin in the position of the phosphoryl or hydroxyl group at the top of the indole ring , and in the numbers of methyl groups ( CH3 ) and other additional carbon chains . 
 Two diethyl analogs ( containing two ethyl groups in place of the two methyl groups ) of psilocybin and psilocin were synthesized by Hofmann : 4 @-@ <unk> @-@ N , N @-@ <unk> , called <unk> @-@ 19 , and 4 @-@ hydroxy @-@ N , N @-@ <unk> , called CZ @-@ 74 . Because their physiological effects last only about three and a half hours ( about half as long as psilocybin ) , they proved more manageable in European clinics using " <unk> therapy " — a form of psychotherapy involving the controlled use of psychedelic drugs . Sandoz marketed and sold pure psilocybin under the name <unk> to physicians and clinicians worldwide . There were no reports of serious complications when psilocybin was used in this way . 
 In the early 1960s , Harvard University became a testing ground for psilocybin , through the efforts of Timothy Leary and his associates Ralph Metzner and Richard Alpert ( who later changed his name to Ram Dass ) . Leary obtained synthesized psilocybin from Hofmann through Sandoz pharmaceutical . Some studies , such as the Concord Prison Experiment , suggested promising results using psilocybin in clinical psychiatry . According to a 2008 review of safety guidelines in human hallucinogenic research , however , Leary and Alpert 's well @-@ publicized termination from Harvard and later advocacy of hallucinogen use " further undermined an objective scientific approach to studying these compounds " . In response to concerns about the increase in unauthorized use of psychedelic drugs by the general public , psilocybin and other hallucinogenic drugs suffered negative press and faced increasingly restrictive laws . In the United States , laws were passed in 1966 that prohibited the production , trade , or ingestion of hallucinogenic drugs ; Sandoz stopped producing LSD and psilocybin the same year . Further backlash against LSD usage swept psilocybin along with it into the Schedule I category of illicit drugs in 1970 . Subsequent restrictions on the use of these drugs in human research made funding for such projects difficult to obtain , and scientists who worked with psychedelic drugs faced being " professionally marginalized " . 
 Despite the legal restrictions on psilocybin use , the 1970s witnessed the emergence of psilocybin as the " entheogen of choice " . This was due in large part to a wide dissemination of information on the topic , which included works such as those by author Carlos Castaneda , and several books that taught the technique of growing psilocybin mushrooms . One of the most popular of this latter group was published in 1976 under the pseudonyms O.T. Oss and <unk> Oeric by Jeremy <unk> , Dennis J. McKenna , K. Harrison McKenna , and Terence McKenna , entitled Psilocybin : Magic Mushroom Grower 's Guide . Over 100 @,@ 000 copies were sold by 1981 . As <unk> Jonathan Ott explains , " These authors adapted San Antonio 's technique ( for producing edible mushrooms by casing mycelial cultures on a rye grain substrate ; San Antonio 1971 ) to the production of Psilocybe [ Stropharia ] cubensis . The new technique involved the use of ordinary kitchen implements , and for the first time the layperson was able to produce a potent entheogen in his own home , without access to sophisticated technology , equipment or chemical supplies . " 
 Because of a lack of clarity about laws about psilocybin mushrooms , retailers in the late 1990s and early 2000s ( decade ) commercialized and marketed them in <unk> in the Netherlands and the UK , and online . Several websites emerged that have contributed to the accessibility of information on description , use , effects and exchange of experiences among users . Since 2001 , six EU countries have tightened their legislation on psilocybin mushrooms in response to concerns about their prevalence and increasing usage . In the 1990s , hallucinogens and their effects on human consciousness were again the subject of scientific study , particularly in Europe . Advances in <unk> and neuropsychology , and the availability of brain imaging techniques have provided impetus for using drugs like psilocybin to probe the " neural underpinnings of psychotic symptom formation including ego disorders and hallucinations " . Recent studies in the United States have attracted attention from the popular press and thrust psilocybin back into the limelight .

 = = = Legal status = = = 
 In the United States , psilocybin ( and psilocin ) were first subjected to federal regulation by the Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 , a product of a bill sponsored by Senator Thomas J. Dodd . The law — passed in July 1965 and effected on February 1 , 1966 — was an amendment to the federal Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act and was intended to regulate the unlicensed " possession , manufacture , or sale of depressant , stimulant and hallucinogenic drugs " . The statutes themselves , however , did not list the " hallucinogenic drugs " that were being regulated . Instead , the term " hallucinogenic drugs " was meant to refer to those substances believed to have a " hallucinogenic effect on the central nervous system " . 
 Despite the seemingly strict provisions of the law , many people were exempt from prosecution . The statutes " permit [ ted ] … people to possess such drugs so long as they were for the personal use of the possessor , [ for ] a member of his household , or for administration to an animal " . The federal law that specifically banned psilocybin and psilocin was enacted on October 24 , 1968 . The substances were said to have " a high potential for abuse " , " no currently accepted medical use , " and " a lack of accepted safety " . On October 27 , 1970 , both psilocybin and psilocin became classified as Schedule I drugs and were simultaneously labeled " hallucinogens " under a section of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act known as the Controlled Substances Act . Schedule I drugs are illicit drugs that are claimed to have no known therapeutic benefit . 
 The United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances ( adopted in 1971 ) requires its members to prohibit psilocybin , and parties to the treaty are required to restrict use of the drug to medical and scientific research under strictly controlled conditions . However , the mushrooms containing the drug were not specifically included in the convention , due largely to pressure from the Mexican government . 
 Most national drug laws have been amended to reflect the terms of the convention ; examples include the UK Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 , the US Psychotropic Substances Act of 1978 , Australia Poisons Standard ( October 2015 ) , the Canadian Controlled Drugs and Substances Act of 1996 , and the Japanese Narcotics and <unk> Control Law of 2002 . The possession and use of psilocybin is prohibited under almost all circumstances , and often carries severe legal penalties . 
 Possession and use of psilocybin mushrooms , including the bluing species of Psilocybe , is therefore prohibited by extension . However , in many national , state , and provincial drug laws , there has been a great deal of ambiguity about the legal status of psilocybin mushrooms , as well as a strong element of selective enforcement in some places . Most US state courts have considered the mushroom a ' container ' of the illicit drugs , and therefore illegal . A loophole further complicates the legal situation — the spores of psilocybin mushrooms do not contain the drugs , and are legal to possess in many areas . Jurisdictions that have specifically enacted or amended laws to criminalize the possession of psilocybin mushroom spores include Germany ( since 1998 ) , and California , Georgia , and Idaho in the United States . As a consequence , there is an active underground economy involved in the sale of spores and cultivation materials , and an internet @-@ based social network to support the illicit activity . 
 = = = Usage = = = 
 A 2009 national survey of drug use by the US Department of Health and Human Services concluded that the number of first @-@ time psilocybin mushroom users in the United States was roughly equivalent to the number of first @-@ time users of cannabis . In European countries , the lifetime prevalence estimates of psychedelic mushroom usage among young adults ( 15 – 34 years ) range from 0 @.@ 3 % to 14 @.@ 1 % . 
 In modern Mexico , traditional ceremonial use survives among several indigenous groups , including the Nahuas , the <unk> , the <unk> , the Mazatecs , Mixes , <unk> , and the <unk> . Although hallucinogenic Psilocybe species are abundant in low @-@ lying areas of Mexico , most ceremonial use takes places in mountainous areas of elevations greater than 1 @,@ 500 meters ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) . Guzmán suggests this is a vestige of Spanish colonial influence from several hundred years earlier , when mushroom use was persecuted by the Catholic Church . 
 = = Research and potential for use in medicine = = 
 After a long interruption in the use of psilocybin in research , there has been a general shift in attitudes regarding research with hallucinogenic agents . Many countries are revising their positions and have started to approve studies to test the physiological and therapeutic effects of hallucinogens . 
 Psilocybin has been a subject of medical research since the 1960s , when Leary and Alpert ran the Harvard Psilocybin Project , in which they carried out a number of experiments to evaluate the therapeutic value of psilocybin in the treatment of personality disorders , or to augment psychological counseling . In the 2000s ( decade ) , there was a renewal of research concerning the use of psychedelic drugs for potential clinical applications , such as to address anxiety disorders , major depression , and various addictions . In 2008 , the Johns Hopkins research team published guidelines for responsibly conducting medical research trials with psilocybin and other hallucinogens in humans . These included recommendations on how to screen potential study volunteers to exclude those with personal or family psychiatric histories that suggest a risk of adverse reactions to hallucinogens . A 2010 study on the short- and long @-@ term subjective effects of psilocybin administration in clinical settings concluded that despite a small risk of acute reactions such as dysphoria , anxiety , or panic , " the administration of moderate doses of psilocybin to healthy , high @-@ functioning and well @-@ prepared subjects in the context of a carefully monitored research environment is associated with an acceptable level of risk " ; the authors note , however , that the safety of the drug " cannot be generalized to situations in which psilocybin is used recreationally or administered under less controlled conditions . " 
 The first clinical study of psilocybin approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) since 1970 — led by Francisco Moreno at the University of Arizona and supported by the <unk> Research Institute and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies — studied the effects of psilocybin on patients with obsessive – compulsive disorder ( OCD ) . The pilot study found that , when administered by trained professionals in a medical setting , the use of psilocybin was associated with substantial reductions in OCD symptoms in several of the patients . This effect is caused largely by psilocybin 's ability to reduce the levels of the 5 @-@ HT2A receptor , resulting in decreased responsiveness to serotonin . Psilocybin has additionally shown promise to ease the pain caused by cluster headaches , " one of the worst pain syndromes known to mankind . " In a 2006 study , half of cluster headache patients reported that psilocybin aborted the attacks , and most reported extended remission periods ; similar results were reported for LSD . A 2011 review of alternative headache treatments concluded that , despite flaws in the study design , these results suggest that LSD and psilocybin may warrant further study for use in the prevention of cluster headaches — only <unk> doses of the drugs are required for effective treatment , and no other medications have been reported to stop a cluster headache cycle . 
 Several modern studies have investigated the possibility that psilocybin can ease the psychological suffering associated with end @-@ stage cancer . Preliminary results indicate that low doses of psilocybin can improve the mood and reduce the anxiety of patients with advanced cancer , and that the effects last from two weeks to six months . These results are comparable to those obtained from early studies that explored the use of LSD to improve the psychological well @-@ being of terminally ill patients , but without the experimental rigor employed in modern clinical <unk> research . 
 A pilot study conducted by Johnson et al. demonstrated that psilocybin may potentially have use in treating nicotine dependence . According to the abstract of the study , " 12 of 15 participants ( 80 % ) showed seven @-@ day point prevalence abstinence at 6 @-@ month follow @-@ up " and " the observed smoking cessation rate substantially exceeds rates commonly reported for other behavioral and / or pharmacological therapies ( typically < 35 % ) . " 
 In 2016 , when administered in high doses , psilocybin showed significant promise for ameliorating the effects of treatment @-@ resistant depression in an open @-@ label study

 = Battle of Ampfing ( 1800 ) = 
 At the Battle of Ampfing on 1 December 1800 , Paul Grenier 's two divisions of the First French Republic opposed against the Austrian army southwest of the town of Ampfing during the French Revolutionary Wars . The Austrians , under the leadership of Archduke John of Austria , forced their enemies to retreat , though they sustained greater losses than the French . Ampfing is located 63 kilometers ( 39 miles ) east of Munich and 8 km ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) west of <unk> am Inn . 
 In Spring 1800 , while Moreau wrecked Austrian defenses in Germany , Generals Massena and Desaix ran into stiff Austrian offensives in Northern Italy . In June , Napoleon brought in the reserve corps and defeated the Austrians at Marengo . On the Danube , the decisive Battle of Höchstädt , followed by success at Battle of Neuburg a few days later , allowed the French to take Munich and to control the Danube and its tributaries as far as Ingolstadt . With the French pressing on Austria from the north and through Italy , a truce ended hostilities for the rest of the summer . Despite these significant losses — both of them decisive — the Austrians were reluctant to accept disadvantageous peace terms . After the expiration of the summer truce in November 1800 , both the Austrian and French armies rushed to come to grips with each other in the terrain east of Munich . The newly appointed commander of Austrian forces , Archduke John , managed to bring the bulk of his army against Grenier 's left wing of Jean Moreau 's French army near Ampfing . Outnumbered , two French divisions fought a stubborn rear guard action for six hours before retreating in good order . 
 Instead of being sobered by their 3 @,@ 000 casualties , Archduke John and his staff became convinced that the enemy was on the run . The Austrian general ordered a pursuit of the French through forested terrain . But , instead of fleeing , Moreau and his troops were waiting for the Austrians . The two armies met in the decisive Battle of Hohenlinden two days later . 
 = = Background = = 
 Although the First Coalition forces achieved several initial victories , the efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the Peace of Leoben ( 17 April 1797 ) and the subsequent Treaty of Campo Formio ( October 1797 ) . This treaty proved difficult to administer . Austria was slow to give up some of the Venetian territories . A Congress convened at Rastatt for the purposes of deciding which southwestern German states would be mediatized to compensate the dynastic houses for territorial losses , but was unable to make any progress . Supported by French republican forces , Swiss insurgents staged several uprisings , ultimately causing the overthrow of the Swiss Confederation after 18 months of civil war . By early 1799 , the French Directory had become impatient with stalling tactics employed by Austria . The uprising in Naples raised further alarms , and recent gains in Switzerland suggested the timing was fortuitous to venture on another campaign in northern Italy and southwestern Germany . 
 At the beginning of 1800 , the armies of France and Austria faced each other across the Rhine . Pál Kray led approximately 120 @,@ 000 troops . In addition to his Austrian regulars , his force included 12 @,@ 000 men from the Electorate of Bavaria , 6 @,@ 000 troops from the Duchy of Württemberg , 5 @,@ 000 soldiers of low quality from the Archbishopric of Mainz , and 7 @,@ 000 militiamen from the County of Tyrol . Of these , 25 @,@ 000 men were deployed east of Lake Constance ( Bodensee ) to protect the Vorarlberg . Kray posted his main body of 95 @,@ 000 soldiers in the L @-@ shaped angle where the Rhine changes direction from a westward flow along the northern border of Switzerland to a northward flow along the eastern border of France . Unwisely , Kray set up his main magazine at Stockach , near the northwestern end of Lake Constance , only a day 's march from French @-@ held Switzerland . 
 Jean Victor Marie Moreau commanded a modestly @-@ equipped army of 137 @,@ 000 French troops . Of these , 108 @,@ 000 troops were available for field operations while the other 29 @,@ 000 watched the Swiss border and held the Rhine fortresses . First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte offered a plan of operations based on outflanking the Austrians by a push from Switzerland , but Moreau declined to follow it . Rather , Moreau planned to cross the Rhine near Basel where the river swung to the north . A French column would distract Kray from Moreau 's true intentions by crossing the Rhine from the west . Bonaparte wanted Claude Lecourbe 's corps to be sent to Italy after the initial battles on the Danube plain , but Moreau had other plans . Through a series of complicated maneuvers in which he flanked , double flanked , and <unk> Kray 's army , Moreau 's army lay on the eastern slope of the Black Forest , while portions of Kray 's army still guarded the passes on the other side . Battles at Engen and Stockach were fought on 3 May 1800 between the army of the First French Republic under Jean Victor Marie Moreau and the army of Habsburg Austria led by Pál Kray . The fighting near Engen resulted in a stalemate with heavy losses on both sides . However , while the two main armies were engaged at Engen , Claude Lecourbe captured Stockach from its Austrian defenders under the Joseph , Prince of Lorraine @-@ Vaudemont . The loss of this main supply base at Stockach compelled Kray to retreat to Messkirch , where they enjoyed a more favorable defensive position . It also meant , however , that any retreat by Kray into Austria via Switzerland and the <unk> was cut off . 
 On 4 and 5 May , the French launched repeated and fruitless assaults on the Messkirch . At nearby <unk> , where the Austrians also had the superiority of position and force , the 1st Demi @-@ brigade took the village and the heights around it , which gave them a commanding aspect over Messkirch . Subsequently , Kray withdrew his forces to Sigmaringen , followed closely by the French . Fighting at nearby Biberach ensued on 9 May ; action principally consisted of the 25 @,@ 000 man @-@ strong French center 's ( commanded by Laurent de Gouvion Saint @-@ Cyr ) , assault on the Austrian force . Again , on 10 May , the Austrians withdrew with heavy losses , this time to Ulm . 
 = = = Strategic importance of Danube valley = = = 
 The French war goal , to occupy Vienna and force the Habsburgs to accept and comply with peace terms established in 1798 , required a double @-@ pronged invasion through northern Italy , which First Consul Napoleon commanded , and through southern Germany , a campaign that fell to Moreau . To secure access into Bavaria and , eventually , to Vienna , the French needed to control the Danube riverway . This was not a new tactic : this stretch of the river had been the site of major battles of the Thirty Years War and War of Spanish Succession . Between Ulm and Ingolstadt , the Danube grows significantly in volume , making it a wide and swift waterway . The Iller joins the Danube at Ulm , dumping massive amounts of water into the stream ; at Donauwörth , the Lech enters the Danube . Neuburg , the first significant city on the river after Donauwörth , had been the family seat of the princes of Pfalz @-@ Neuburg ; taking it from a princely family of the Holy Roman Empire would be a blow to the morale and prestige of the Habsburgs , whose role it was to protect the small princely domains . Control of the bridges and passages between Ulm and Donauwörth , Neuburg , then Ingolstadt offered an advantage of both transport and prestige . There followed a series of battles and clashes along the Danube between Ulm and Ingolstadt . Once Höchstädt and its nearby bridges fell on 19 June , the French controlled the Danube crossings between Ulm and Donauwörth . Kray abandoned Ulm , and withdrew further downstream . The next French target would be Neuburg . After a day @-@ long battle for control of the river by Neuburg , the Austrians withdrew . Lecourbe ordered his troops not to pursue , as nightfall was on them . The French now controlled access to the Danube , its tributaries as far south as Pöttmes , and the banks on the north side of the river . 
 The loss of Neuburg broke the Austrian control along the strategic Danube . Similarly , in Italy , French successes at the battles at Montebello and Marengo forced Austrian withdrawal to the east . With France threatening Habsburg Austria from the northwest and southwest , the Austrians agreed to a cease fire . Subsequent peace negotiations were complicated by the alliance Austria had made with Britain , and which prevented her from signing any separate peace . Consequently , the British , although they had been successful in blockading French ports , entered the negotiations to bolster their weakened ally . Initially Britain refused the French terms and offered counter terms in September 1800 . Negotiations continued ; Napoleon later claimed that the Austrians did not negotiate in good faith , and sought only to gain time until " the rainy season " ( winter ) , when army movements would be difficult , and the Habsburgs would have an entire season to recruit . 
 = = = Truce = = = 
 On 15 July 1800 , France and Austria agreed to a truce that ended the summer campaign in southern Germany . Emperor Francis II dismissed Pál Kray and appointed his brother , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Archduke John , to command the Austrian army . To compensate for the young man 's inexperience , the emperor named Franz von Lauer as deputy commander and Oberst ( Colonel ) Franz von Weyrother became Chief of Staff . Both armies prepared for a renewal of hostilities , but an extension of the truce was signed on 20 September . At this time , the Bavarian fortresses of Ingolstadt , Ulm , and Philippsburg were ceded to the French , but these concessions allowed Austria to augment their field forces with 20 @,@ 000 line infantry belonging to the garrisons . In the meantime , peace negotiations were continued . 
 = = = Resumption of hostilities = = = 
 The summer armistice held until 12 November 1800 , when the French notified their enemies of their intention to end the truce in two weeks . The Austrians distributed 124 @,@ 000 soldiers in an arc from Würzburg in the north to Innsbruck in the south . Joseph @-@ Sebastien von <unk> held Würzburg with 12 @,@ 000 troops . Johann von Klenau and 14 @,@ 000 soldiers defended the north bank of the Danube near Regensburg . Archduke John 's main army , with 49 @,@ 000 infantry and 16 @,@ 500 cavalry , lay behind the Inn River near Braunau am Inn and Passau . Christian von Zweibrücken 's 16 @,@ 000 Bavarians , Württembergers , Austrians , and French <unk> of the Army of Condé lay to the southwest of the main army , guarding the line of the Inn . Farther to the southwest , Johann von Hiller occupied Innsbruck with 16 @,@ 000 troops . 
 To counter the Austrians , the French fielded an even larger array of forces . From Frankfurt am Main , Pierre Augereau and 16 @,@ 000 troops threatened <unk> 's northern wing . Moreau controlled 107 @,@ 000 of the main army , deployed in four wings . <unk> de Saint @-@ Suzanne 's 24 @,@ 000 @-@ strong detached force occupied the north bank of the Danube near Ingolstadt , Grenier 's 24 @,@ 000 @-@ man Left Wing deployed on the west bank of the Isar River near Landshut . Moreau massed the 36 @,@ 000 soldiers of the Center around Munich under his personal control . The Right Wing of Lecourbe defended the line of the upper Lech River farther west . Lastly , Jacques MacDonald with the 18 @,@ 000 @-@ strong Army of the Grisons threatened Hiller 's force from Switzerland . 
 Unlike most French armies of the Revolutionary period , Moreau 's troops in late 1800 enjoyed a well @-@ organized supply service . Though the onset of winter lengthened the army sick list , the months @-@ long truce allowed many units to approach their full strength . Many French officers were confident of success . Moreau planned a broad @-@ front advance eastward to the Inn , fighting any enemies as he found them . He would lead with his left to allow Lecourbe 's Right Wing to advance unmolested , since it had a greater distance to cover . Once the French wings closed up to the Inn River , his troops would look for crossing sites . 
 The aggressive Weyrother persuaded Archduke John and Lauer to launch an offensive . The Austrian chief of staff planned to strike in the direction of Landshut . From there , the Austrians would either wheel left to smash the French left flank or possibly get across their enemies ' line of communications to the west of Munich . However , in the last days of November , the Austrian army proved unable to advance with the necessary speed to turn the French north flank . Aware that their adversaries were also advancing , Lauer convinced the archduke to convert the flank march into a direct advance on Munich . 
 = = Battle = = 
 By the evening of 30 November , the Austrian advance guard occupied Ampfing . At dawn on 1 December , Johann Riesch left the town with 12 battalions of infantry and 12 squadrons of cavalry , or approximately 14 @,@ 000 men . Ludwig Baillet de Latour @-@ Merlemont led nine battalions and 18 squadrons , or 12 @,@ 000 soldiers , on Riesch 's right flank . Latour quickly overran the French outposts and nearly surprised Michel Ney 's division in its camp . Despite odds of four @-@ to @-@ one , the ( French ) 19th Cavalry Regiment charged their attackers , which included the Latour Dragoon Regiment # 11 . 
 The cavalry charge gave Ney enough time to place <unk> ' brigade in line of battle to meet the first shock . Ney 's division included 8 @,@ 200 infantry , 1 @,@ 100 cavalry , and 14 cannons , but one of his three brigades was detached to the south at Wasserburg am Inn . <unk> conducted an able defense , counterattacking when the 13th Dragoons rode to his support . Meanwhile , Ney directed the fighting on a second brigade front . At noon , a horse artillery battery led by Jean Baptiste Eblé arrived and its accurate fire quickly dismounted four Austrian guns and destroyed three caissons . Later , two pieces were overrun by Austrian hussars , but the French gunners rallied and recaptured the pieces in a horseback charge . 
 While Latour battered against Ney , Riesch launched attacks against the 4 @,@ 100 foot soldiers , 2 @,@ 000 horsemen , and 16 guns belonging to Jean Hardy 's division . A brigade belonging to Claude Legrand 's division marched up and helped block Riesch 's attempt to turn Hardy 's flank . During the fighting , a shellburst wounded Hardy and caused him to hand over command to BG <unk> . With both French divisions being slowly pressed back by superior numbers , Grenier gave orders for a withdrawal . 
 Grenier directed his well @-@ managed retreat along the road toward Haag , with all the units falling back in an orderly echelon . To save some artillery from capture , the 2nd Dragoons charged their pursuers and captured 100 Austrians . After falling back 8 km ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) , the French soldiers reached the open ground around Haag , where they assumed a defensive position . All told , the battle lasted six hours . In addition to the Latour Dragoons , the most heavily engaged Austrian units were the Archduke Charles Infantry Regiment ( IR ) # 3 and the Waldeck Dragoons # 7 from Riesch 's column , plus IR # 60 and the Vecsey Hussars # 4 from Johann Kollowrat 's column . 
 = = Result = = 
 The Austrians suffered 303 killed , 1 @,@ 690 wounded , and 1 @,@ 077 captured . The French lost 193 killed , 817 wounded , and 697 captured . Expecting to fight a major battle the following day , the Austrian generals were surprised to find that the French evacuated Haag and vanished into the deep woods . Though Lauer counseled caution , the victory elated the inexperienced Archduke John , the aggressive Weyrother , and the army staff . They became convinced that they only faced French rear guards . " This erroneous idea prompted Austrian headquarters to ignore all normal precautions in the haste to come to grips [ with the French force ] . " John ordered a pursuit toward Hohenlinden by the columns of Riesch , Latour , and Kollowrat , while drawing in <unk> Michael von Kienmayer 's 16 @,@ 000 @-@ strong column to form his northern flank . They chased after the French into the <unk> forest , but Moreau waited for the Austrian and Bavarian force in the Hohenlinden plain with four divisions and his cavalry reserve and ambushed them as they emerged from the forest . To complete the victory at Hohenlinden , MG Antoine Richepanse 's division accomplished a surprise envelopment of the Austrian left flank . 
 This crushing victory , followed by several skirmishes and clashes along the Danube and in Bavaria , demoralized the Habsburg force . These , Coupled with First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte 's victory at the Battle of Marengo on 14 June 1800 , ended the War of the Second Coalition . In February 1801 , the Austrians signed the Treaty of Lunéville , accepting French control up to the Rhine and the French puppet republics in Italy and the Netherlands . The subsequent Treaty of Amiens between France and Britain began the longest break in the wars of the Napoleonic period .

Mary Kay Place , Erik Palladino , Amber Benson , and Jacqueline Bisset have supporting roles . 
 Latter Days premiered at the Philadelphia International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival on July 10 , 2003 and was released in various states of USA over the next 12 months . Later the film was released in a few other countries and shown at several gay film festivals . It was the first film to portray openly the clash between the principles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter @-@ day Saints and homosexuality , and its exhibition in some U.S. states was controversial . Various religious groups demanded that the film be withdrawn from theaters and video stores under boycott threats . 
 The film was met with mixed reactions from film critics , but was popular with most film festival attendees .

 = = Themes = = 
 Cox has stated that the film is primarily about a love story between two characters . There is also an exploration of religious attitudes towards homosexuality , and the dilemma of religious homosexuals , torn between who they are and what they believe . A non @-@ fiction film with similar themes that has been contrasted with Latter Days is Trembling Before G @-@ d . 
 Cox has also said that there is a massive irony , both in the film and in real life , that a religion so focused on the family and its importance is ripping families apart through its teaching on homosexuality . In fact , Cox believes one cannot be Mormon and gay . Nevertheless , a major theme of Latter Days is that there is an underlying spirituality in the world that goes beyond the rituals and dogmas of religion . 
 = = Production = = 
 Latter Days was written and directed by C. Jay Cox after the success of his previous screenplay , Sweet Home Alabama , gave him the financial resources and critical credit to write a more personal love story . Cox based both characters – Christian and Aaron – on himself . He was raised as a Mormon and served a mission before coming out as gay , and had wondered what the two halves of himself would have said to each other if they had ever met . Latter Days was filmed in several locations in Los Angeles in 24 days on an estimated $ 850 @,@ 000 budget . After Cox had financed the search for initial backing , funding was acquired from private investors who wanted to see the film made . However producer Kirkland <unk> still faced several bottlenecks , as financing the whole film remained difficult . It was distributed through TLA Releasing , an independent film distributor , who picked it up through its partnership with production company Funny Boy Films , which specializes in gay @-@ themed media . 
 Despite coming from a Mormon background , Cox had to research details of the excommunication tribunal , which is held after Aaron is sent back to Idaho . Former Mormons told him about their experiences and provided Cox with " a pretty accurate representation , right down to the folding tables . " According to Cox experienced actress Jacqueline Bisset also added valuable suggestions for improvements to the story . 
 Casting for the two main characters did not focus on their sexuality , but their ability " to show vulnerability " . In a behind @-@ the @-@ scenes commentary , Steve Sandvoss explains that he did not want to play his character as a gay character , and Wes Ramsey emphasizes that the love story aspect of the film to him was detached from the character 's gender . Due to several nude and kissing scenes , Latter Days was released unrated .

 Latter Days premiered at the Philadelphia International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival on July 10 , 2003 . The audience enjoyed the film so much that they gave it a standing ovation . When the cast came on stage , they received another standing ovation . The film had a similar reception both at <unk> a week later , and at the Palm Springs International Film Festival . The film also screened at the Seattle and Washington film festivals before being released across the United States over the following 12 months . Later the film was released in several other countries and shown at numerous gay film festivals , namely in Barcelona and Madrid ( where it was also a popular pick ) and Mexico City . Since its initial release it had received nine best film awards , as Cox mentioned in 2005 on a featurette included on the UK DVD . 
 The film was banned by <unk> Theaters , an arthouse cinema chain with nine theaters across the country , which claimed it was " not up to [ our ] artistic quality . " The company was pressured with threatened boycotts and protests by conservative groups to withdraw their planned release . At the North American box office , Latter Days made $ 834 @,@ 685 from a maximum of 19 theaters . As of January 2011 , the film is the top @-@ grossing film from its distributor TLA Releasing .

 Critics ' reviews have been mixed ; film review website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 45 % of critics gave the film positive write @-@ ups , based upon a sample of 44 reviews , with an average score of 5 @.@ 4 / 10 . Frank Scheck , reviewer for The Hollywood Reporter , wrote : " Cox 's screenplay , while occasionally lapsing into the sort of clichés endemic to so many gay @-@ themed films , generally treats its unusual subject matter with dignity and complexity . " Film critic Roger Ebert gave it two and a half stars out of four , declaring that the script was peopled from the " Stock Characters Store " and " the movie could have been ( a ) a gay love story , or ( b ) an attack on the Mormon Church , but is an awkward fit by trying to be ( c ) both at the same time " . Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune commented " this movie is often as kitschy and artificial as ... ' Sweet Home Alabama ' " , another film written by Cox . 
 Other reviewers were more favourable , such as Toronto Sun critic Liz Braun , who said Latter Days was " the most important gay male movie of the past few years . " Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times commented : " At once romantic , earthy and socially critical , Latter Days is a dynamic film filled with humor and pathos . " Gary <unk> , an editor for the LGBT Mormon organization <unk> , said " It was so realistic that it was scary . I felt exposed as the particulars of my experience and of others I know was brazenly spread across the big screen for all to behold . "

 Eric <unk> scored the soundtrack to the film after shooting wrapped , and composed much of the score himself . Several scenes featuring the rapid passing of time , such as Christian 's desperate search for Aaron at Salt Lake City Airport , were scored with techno style beats , and scenes with emotional content were given a more " ambient ' <unk> feel " . A total of three songs were written by C. Jay Cox for Rebekah Johnson to sing : " More " , " Another Beautiful Day " , and " Tuesday 3 : 00 a.m. " . <unk> was very impressed with Cox 's musical ability , and both men composed more songs as background music . 
 The official soundtrack album was released on October 26 , 2004 . Due to contractual reasons , Johnson did not appear on the album , and her character 's songs were performed by Nita Whitaker instead . 
 = = Novelization and other releases = = 
 In 2004 , the Latter Days screenplay was adapted into a novel by freelance writer T. <unk> , which was published by Alyson Publications . The book was faithful to the film , but added several extra scenes that explained confusing aspects of the film and gave more about the characters ' backgrounds . For example , the reason Ryder tells Christian where to find Aaron is his own broken heart over a girl he fell in love with while on his mission training . The novel also added dialogue that had been cut out of the film : finishing , for example Christian 's cry – in the film – of " That 's the hand I use to ... " with " masturbate with . " 
 In France , Latter Days has been titled La Tentation d <unk> ( " The Temptation of Aaron " ) , and the DVD given a cover showing Aaron in a nude and suggestive pose . A new trailer was also released , which is considerably more sexual than the original . In Italy , Latter Days is distributed by <unk> . The film has also been titled " <unk> <unk> " , shown on pay @-@ TV on Sky Show in December 2006 , and then released on DVD by <unk> 's gay @-@ themed label " <unk> ! " . The film is also available in an Italian @-@ language @-@ dubbed version . 
 = Battle of Taegu = 
 The Battle of Taegu was an engagement between UN and North Korean forces early in the Korean War , with fighting continuing from August 5 – 20 , 1950 around the city of Taegu , South Korea . It was a part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously . The battle ended in a victory for the United Nations after their forces were able to drive off an offensive by North Korean divisions attempting to cross the Naktong River and assault the city . 
 Five North Korean Army divisions massed around the city preparing to cross the Naktong River and assault it from the north and west . Defending the city were the 1st Cavalry Division and the ROK II Corps . In a series of engagements , each of the North Korean divisions attempted to cross the Naktong and attack the defending forces . The success of these attacks varied by region , but attacks in the 1st Cavalry Division sector were repulsed and the attacks in the South Korean sector were more successful . 
 During the battle , however , North Korean troops were able to surprise US troops on Hill 303 and capture them . Late in the battle , these troops were machine gunned in the Hill 303 massacre . Despite these setbacks , the UN forces were successful in driving most of the North Koreans off , but the decisive battle to secure the city would occur during the Battle of the Bowling Alley . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Outbreak of war = = = 
 Following the invasion of the Republic of Korea ( South Korea ) by its northern neighbor , the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea ( North Korea ) and the outbreak of the Korean War on June 25 , 1950 , the United Nations Security Council voted to send armed forces to defend South Korea . The United States , a permanent member of the Security Council , immediately deployed armed forces ( U.S. Army , U.S. Navy , and U.S. Air Force units ) to southeastern South Korea because of their immediate availability from their bases in Japan and Okinawa , where the military occupation of Japan was still in effect ( through 1952 ) . ( Reinforcements from such countries as Australia , Canada , Greece , New Zealand , Turkey , and the United Kingdom took much longer to arrive from overseas . ) 
 The goal of American armed forces was to reinforce the remnants of the South Korean Army in fighting back the North Korean invasion ( but only in the southeastern part of South Korea , around the major seaport of Pusan ) to prevent the complete collapse of the South Korean Army and of the South Korean Government . However , the American armed forces in the Orient had been decreasing steadily since the end of World War II ( in August 1945 ) . Under the orders of Emperor Hirohito , the Japanese people had presented no trouble to the American occupation forces , and the Japanese set about peacefully rebuilding their devastated country . By mid @-@ 1950 , there were no American troops in South Korea , and the American force in Japan had dwindled drastically . 
 At the time of the North Korean invasion , the closest American ground force was the 24th Infantry Division , which was based in Japan . This division had fewer than its normal contingent of soldiers , and most of its equipment was rather old due to the U.S. Congress 's reductions in military spending . In any case , the 24th Infantry Division was the only part of the U.S. Army that was available to quickly reinforce South Korea . 
 Thus , the 24th Infantry Division was the first American armed force sent to South Korea with the mission to blunt the advance of the North Korean Army and to set up a defensive perimeter around Pusan ( the Pusan Perimeter ) with the aid of Air Force , U.S. Navy , and Marine Corps aviation forces . The Supreme United Nations military commander in the area , General Douglas MacArthur , decided to have his American and South Korean troops to dig in around Pusan and hold on until he could assemble a powerful force ( the American 10th Corps ) to make an amphibious counterattack at Inchon on the northwestern coast of South Korea , near Seoul , later on in 1950 . The 24th Infantry Division , along with its South Korean allies , was hence nearly alone for several weeks while the Americans and South Koreans held out inside the Pusan Perimeter and awaited reinforcements and counterattacks against the North Koreans . 
 Among the American units that reinforced the Pusan Perimeter as soon as they could arrive were the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division ( horseless , of course ) , the 7th Infantry Division , and the 25th Infantry Divisions , along with other units of the U.S. Eighth Army that provided logistical , medical , and intelligence support . Advance units of the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5 in the first encounter between American and North Korean troops . For the first month after the defeat at Osan , the 24th Infantry were repeatedly pushed back and forced southeastward by larger numbers of North Korean troops equipped with rugged Soviet @-@ made T @-@ 34 tanks . ( The heavily armored T @-@ 34 had been a primary Soviet weapon against the Nazi German invasion of the U.S.S.R. in 1942 – 1945 . ) 
 The troops of the 24th Infantry were systematically pushed southeast in the Battle of Chochiwon , the Battle of Chonan , and the Battle of Pyongtaek , as well as in smaller <unk> . The 24th Infantry made a desperate stand against the North Koreans in the Battle of Taejon , where it was heavily decimated , but it delayed the North Korean advance until July 20 . By that time , the Eighth Army 's force of combat troops were roughly equal in numbers to North Korean forces attacking the Pusan Perimeter , with new U.N. forces arriving from America , Australia , New Zealand , etc . , nearly every day . 
 = = = North Korean advance = = = 
 With the city of Taejon captured , the Korean People 's Army ( KPA ) began surrounding the Pusan Perimeter on the north and the west in an attempt to crush it . The 4th and 6th North Korean Infantry Divisions advanced south in a wide flanking maneuver . These two North Korean divisions attempted to turn the American 's and South Korean 's left flank in order to capture Pusan from the southwest , but the North Koreans became dispersed out in the process . They were also exposed to repeated air attacks from the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy . The North Koreans attacked the U.S. troops with superior numbers at first , and with the rugged T @-@ 34 tanks , but despite local defeats , the U.N. troops , with the help of aviation and naval units were able to extend the Pusan Perimeter all the way south to the East China Sea and to blunt all North Korean attacks toward Pusan . American air supremacy using airfields in Japan and the aircraft carriers of the 7th Fleet in the Sea of Japan were probably the decisive ingredient in enabling the Pusan Perimeter to hold out . 
 American forces were pushed back repeatedly before finally halting the North Korean advance in a series of battles around the edges of the Pusan Perimeter . Forces of the 3rd Battalion , 29th Infantry , newly arrived in the country , were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by North Korean forces on July 27 , opening a pass to the Pusan area . Soon after , North Korean forces took Chinju to the west , pushing back the US 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving routes to the Pusan open for more North Korean attacks . US formations were subsequently able to defeat and push back the North Koreans on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2 . Suffering mounting losses , the KPA force in the west withdrew for several days to re @-@ equip and receive reinforcements . This granted both sides a reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter . 
 = = = Taegu = = = 
 In the meantime , Eighth Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker had established Taegu as the Eighth Army 's headquarters . Right at the center of the Pusan Perimeter , Taegu stood at the entrance to the Naktong River valley , an area where North Korean forces could advance in large numbers in close support . The natural barriers provided by the Naktong River to the south and the mountainous terrain to the north converged around Taegu , which was also the major transportation hub and last major South Korean city aside from Pusan itself to remain in UN hands . From south to north , the city was defended by the US 1st Cavalry Division , and the ROK 1st Division and ROK 6th Division of ROK II Corps . 1st Cavalry Division was spread out along a long line along the Naktong River to the south , with its 5th Cavalry and 8th Cavalry regiments holding a 24 @,@ 000 metres ( 79 @,@ 000 ft ) line along the river south of Waegwan , facing west . The 7th Cavalry held position to the east in reserve , along with artillery forces , ready to reinforce anywhere a crossing could be attempted . The ROK 1st Division held a northwest @-@ facing line in the mountains immediately north of the city while the ROK 6th Division held position to the east , guarding the narrow valley holding the Kunwi road into the Pusan Perimeter area . 
 Five North Korean divisions amassed to oppose the UN at Taegu . From south to north , the 10th , 3rd , 15th , 13th , and 1st Divisions occupied a wide line encircling Taegu from Tuksong @-@ dong and around Waegwan to Kunwi . The North Korean army planned to use the natural corridor of the Naktong valley from Sangju to Taegu as its main axis of attack for the next push south , so the divisions all eventually moved through this valley , crossing the Naktong at different areas along the low ground . Elements of the DPRK 105th Armored Division also supported the attack .

 On the night of 4 to 5 August , the North Korean 13th Division began crossing the Naktong River at Naktong @-@ ni , 40 miles ( 64 km ) northwest of Taegu . The crossing was not discovered until 5 August when ROK artillery and mortar fire was called on the crossing . Over the course of three nights , DPRK soldiers from the division 's three regiments crossed the river on rafts or by wading , carrying their weapons and equipment over their heads . The entire division was across by 7 August , and assembling several miles from the ROK 1st Division 's prepared defenses . 
 At the same time , the DPRK 1st Division crossed the river on barges between Hamch 'ang and Sangju , in the ROK 6th Division 's sector from 6 to 8 August . This attack was discovered quickly by American reconnaissance planes and the DPRK 1st Division was immediately engaged by the ROK forces . The two divisions locked in battle around Kunwi until 17 August , with the North Korean division facing stubborn resistance , heavy air attacks , and heavy casualties . 
 = = = Opening moves = = = 
 ROK troops attacked the 13th Division immediately after it completing its crossing , forcing scattered North Korean troops into the mountains . The division reassembled to the east and launched a concerted night attack , broke the ROK defenses , and began an advance that carried it twenty miles southeast of Naktong @-@ ni on the main road to Taegu . Within a week , the DPRK 1st and 13th divisions were converging on the Tabu @-@ dong area , about 15 miles ( 24 km ) north of Taegu . 
 The DPRK 15th Division , the next of the DPRK divisions in the line to the south , received 1 @,@ 500 replacements at Kumch 'on on 5 August , which brought its strength to about 6 @,@ 500 troops . On the next day , its 45th Regiment marched northeast toward the Naktong River . This regiment passed through <unk> on 7 August and crossed the river southeast of that town while under attack by American warplanes . Once across the river , this regiment headed into the mountains , initially encountering no opposition . Its other two regiments , the 48th and 50th , departed from Kumch 'on later and began crossing the Naktong between <unk> and Waegwan before dawn of 8 August , constructing underwater bridges for their vehicles . The North Koreans supported this crossing by direct tank fire from the western side of the river . These tanks next carried out their own river crossing during the day . The DPRK 15th Division seized Hills 201 and 346 on the east side of the river at the crossing site before advancing eastward into the mountains toward Tabu @-@ dong , 7 miles ( 11 km ) away . On the next day , the ROK 1st Division regained the high ground at the crossing sites , driving the DPRK forces further eastward into the mountains . From 12 through 16 August , the three regiments of the DPRK 15th Division united on the east side of the Naktong River in the vicinity of Yuhak @-@ san , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) east of the crossing site and 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) northwest of Tabu @-@ dong . The DPRK 13th Division quickly locked in combat on Yuhak @-@ san with the ROK 1st Division . 
 South of Waegwan , two more enemy divisions stood ready to cross the Naktong in a coordinated attack with the divisions to the north . The experienced DPRK 3rd Division , concentrated in the vicinity of Songju , and the untested DPRK 10th Division , concentrated in the Koryong area , and both mobilized for an attack . These two divisions crossed in the American 1st Cavalry Division 's sector . The DPRK 3rd Division 's 7th Regiment started crossing the Naktong at about 0300 hours on 9 August near Noch 'on , two miles ( three km ) south of the Waegwan bridge . After discovering this crossing , units of the American 5th Cavalry Regiment directed automatic @-@ weapon fire against the North Korean units and also called in pre @-@ registered artillery fire on the crossing site . Although the enemy regiment suffered some casualties , the bulk of it reached the east bank and then moved inland into the hills . About 30 minutes later , the 8th and 9th Regiments began crossing the river to the south . The 5th Cavalry Regiment and all its supporting mortars and artillery , now fully alerted , spotted and decimated the troops of the two regiments and turned them back to the west bank . Only a small number of North Koreans reached the eastern side . From there , they were either captured by the U.N. troops or hid out until the next night – when they retreated across the river . 
 = = = Triangulation Hill = = = 
 At dawn on 9 August , the division commander Major General Hobart R. Gay at the 1st Cavalry Division headquarters in Taegu learned of the enemy 's river crossing in the area of his division south of Waegwan . Since the first reports were vague , Gen. Gay decided to withhold counterattack until he learned more about the situation . He quickly learned that around 750 DPRK infantry troops had gathered on Hill 268 , also known as " Triangulation Hill " , which was 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) southeast of Waegwan and 10 miles ( 16 km ) northwest of Taegu . Gen. Gay ordered his division to counterattack the enemy gathering to force them across the river . He and Gen. Walker thought that this attack could be a feint , and that the North Koreans could be planning a larger attack to their north . Furthermore , the hill was important because of its proximity to the lines of supply . The main Korean north @-@ south highway and the main Seoul @-@ Pusan railroad skirted the base of Triangulation Hill . 
 At about 09 : 30 , Gen. Gay ordered the 1st Battalion of the 7th Cavalry , to counter the DPRK army penetration . This battalion moved from its bivouac area just outside Taegu , accompanied by five tanks of A Company , 71st Heavy Tank Battalion . This motorized force proceeded to the foot of Hill 268 . Meanwhile , the 61st Field Artillery Battalion shelled the hill heavily . 
 At about 12 : 00 the artillery fired a preparation on Hill 268 , and the 1st Battalion next attacked it with orders to continue on southwest to Hill 154 . Hill 268 was covered with thick brush from about 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) and trees eight to 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) high . The day was very hot , and many of the American soldiers collapsed from heat exhaustion during the attack , which was not well @-@ coordinated with the artillery fire . The North Koreans repulsed the attack . 
 On the next morning , 10 August , air raids and artillery bombardments rocked Hill 268 , devastating the North Korean battalion . That afternoon , Gen. Gay ordered the five American tanks to move along the Waegwan road until they could fire onto the hill from the northwest into its reverse slope . This tank @-@ gun fire caught the DPRK troops unprepared while they were hiding from the artillery fire . Trapped between the two barrages , they started to vacate their positions . An American infantry attack next reached the crest of the Triangulation Hill without much trouble , and this battle was over by about 16 : 00 . American artillery and mortar fire was now shifted westward , and this cut off the retreat of the DPRK troops . White phosphorus shells fired from the 61st Field Artillery Battalion caught North Korean troops in a village while they attempted to retreat , and the DPRK troops were then routed by American infantry , suffering over 200 killed . That evening the 1st Battalion , 7th Cavalry , returned to the serve as the division reserve , and elements of the 5th Cavalry finished securing Hill 268 . 
 The 7th Regiment of the DPRK 3rd Division had been destroyed on the hill . The 1st Battalion , 7th Cavalry suffered 14 men killed and another 48 wounded in the two @-@ day battle . About 1 @,@ 000 men of the 7th Regiment had crossed the Naktong to Hill 268 , and about 700 of at them became casualties . Artillery and mortars had inflicted most of the crippling casualties on the regiment . After crossing to the east side of the Naktong , the enemy regiment had received no food or ammunition supply . An estimated 300 survivors retreated across the river the night of 10 – 11 August . The DPRK 3rd Division 's attempted crossing of the Naktong south of Waegwan had ended in catastrophe . When the survivors of the 7th Regiment rejoined the division on or about 12 August , the once powerful 3rd Division was reduced to a disorganized unit of only about 2 @,@ 500 troops . The DPRK Army placed this division in reserve to be rebuilt by replacements . 
 = = = Yongp 'o crossing = = = 
 The North Korean plan for the attack against Taegu from the west and southwest demanded that the DPRK 10th Division make a coordinated attack with the DPRK 3rd Division . The 10th Division , so far untested in combat , had started from <unk> 'on for the front by rail on July 25 . At Chonan it left the trains and continued south on foot through Taejon , arriving at the Naktong opposite Waegwan around 8 August . The division was ordered to cross the Naktong River in the vicinity of Tuksong @-@ dong , penetrate east , and cut the main supply route of the U.N. troops from Pusan to Taegu . The division assembled in the Koryong area on 11 August . 
 Two regiments of the DPRK 10th Division , the 29th to the south and the 25th to the north , were to make the assault crossing with the 27th Regiment in reserve . The 2nd Battalion , 29th Regiment , was the first unit of the division to cross the river . Its troops waded across undetected during the night of August 11 / 12 , west of Hyongp 'ung . It then occupied Hill 265 , a northern spur of Hill 409 , 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) southwest of Hyongp 'ung , and set up machine gun positions . The other two battalions followed it and occupied Hill 409 . The North Koreans on Hill 409 soon ambushed a patrol from the 21st Infantry Regiment of the US 24th Infantry Division , which was moving north and trying to establish contact with the 7th Cavalry Regiment during the Battle of the Naktong Bulge occurring simultaneously to the south . 
 Further north , the 25th Regiment started crossing the Naktong around 03 : 00 on August 12 , in the vicinity of Tuksong @-@ dong , on the Koryong @-@ Taegu road . The 2nd Battalion , 7th Cavalry Regiment , covered this crossing site , which was 14 miles ( 23 km ) southwest of Taegu . By daylight , a North Korean force of 300 to 400 had penetrated to Wich 'on @-@ dong and 2nd Battalion 's H Company engaged it in close combat . In a grenade and automatic weapons attack , the North Koreans overran the advance positions of the company , the mortar observation post , and the heavy machine gun positions . The North Koreans were apparently attempting to control high ground east of Yongp 'o in order to provide protection for the main crossing that was to follow . By 09 : 00 , however , the 2nd Battalion , supported by the 77th Field Artillery Battalion and air strikes , drove the North Koreans troops back through Yongp 'o and dispersed them . 
 = = = Second Yongp 'o attack = = = 
 In the three days from 10 to 12 August , the Naktong River had dropped three feet in depth and it was only shoulder @-@ deep at many places due to the lack of rain and the torrid weather . This made any attempt at crossing the river considerably easier . 
 A more determined North Korean crossing of the Naktong in the vicinity of the blown bridge between Tuksong @-@ dong and Yongp 'o began early in the morning on 14 August . By 06 : 20 , about 500 North Korean soldiers had penetrated as far as Yongp 'o . Fifteen minutes later , 2nd Battalion , 7th Cavalry soldiers engaged the North Koreans at Wich 'on @-@ dong , a mile east of the crossing site . At 08 : 00 , General Gay ordered 1st Battalion , 7th Cavalry to move to the Yongp 'o area to support the 2nd Battalion . 
 North Korean artillery and tank fire from the west side of the river supporting the infantry crossing . A large number of North Korean reinforcements were crossing in barges near the bridge , while under fire from American air strikes and artillery . This attack also stalled , with the deepest North Korean penetration reaching <unk> @-@ dong , 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) beyond the blown @-@ up bridge . From there the combined fire of US light weapons , mortars , and artillery drove them back to the river . By noon , large groups of North Koreans were trying to recross the river to the west side as American artillery continued hammering them , causing heavy casualties . 
 By nightfall , the 7th Cavalry Regiment had eliminated the North Korean bridgehead at Yongp 'o . In the fight , the only major one to take place along the Naktong at a prefabricated crossing site , the 25th and 27th Regiments of the DPRK 10th Division suffered crippling losses . The 7th Cavalry estimated that of 1 @,@ 700 North Korean troops that had succeeded in crossing the river , 1 @,@ 500 had been killed . Two days after the battle , H Company reported it had buried 267 enemy dead behind its lines . In front of its position , G Company counted 150 enemy dead . In contrast , G Company suffered only two men killed and three wounded during the battle . In its first combat mission , the crossing of the Naktong , the 10th Division suffered 2 @,@ 500 casualties .

 Almost simultaneously with the DPRK 10th Division 's crossing in the southern part of the 1st Cavalry Division sector at Tuksong @-@ dong and Yongp 'o , another was taking place northward above Waegwan near the boundary between the division 's sector and the ROK 1st Division 's sector . The northernmost unit of the 1st Cavalry Division was G Company of the 5th Cavalry Regiment . It held Hill 303 , the furthest position on the Eighth Army 's extreme right flank . 
 For several days UN intelligence sources had reported heavy North Korean concentrations across the Naktong opposite the ROK 1st Division . Early in the morning on August 14 , a North Korean regiment crossed the Naktong 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) north of Waegwan into the ROK 1st Division sector through an underwater bridge . Shortly after midnight that night , ROK forces on the high ground just north of the <unk> Army boundary were attacked by this force . After daylight an air strike partially destroyed the underwater bridge . The North Korean attack spread south and by 1200 North Korean small arms fire fell on G Company , 5th Cavalry Regiment , on Hill 303 . Instead of moving east into the mountains as other landings had , this force turned south and headed for Waegwan . 
 Early in the morning on August 15 , G Company men on Hill 303 spotted 50 North Korean infantry supported by two T @-@ 34 tanks moving south along the river road at the base of the hill . They also spotted another column moving to their rear which quickly engaged F Company with small arms fire . In order to escape the enemy encirclement , F Company withdrew south , but G Company did not . By 08 : 30 , North Koreans had completely surrounded it and a supporting platoon of H Company mortarmen on Hill 303 . A relief column , composed of B Company , 5th Cavalry , and a platoon of US tanks tried to reach G Company , but was unable to penetrate the North Korean force that was surrounding Hill 303 . 
 Later that day , B Company and the tanks tried again to retake the hill , now estimated to contain a 700 @-@ man battalion . The 61st Field Artillery Battalion and elements of the 82nd Field Artillery Battalion , fired on the hill during the day . During the night , G Company succeeded in escaping from Hill 303 . Before dawn on the 17th , troops from both the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 5th Cavalry Regiment , supported by A Company of the 70th Tank Battalion , attacked Hill 303 , but heavy North Korean mortar fire stopped them at the edge of Waegwan . During the morning , heavy artillery preparations pounded the North Korean positions on the hill . 
 At 14 : 00 , an air strike came in , with planes bombarded the hill with napalm , conventional bombs , rockets , and machine guns . The strike and artillery preparation , were successful in pushing North Korean forces off the hill . After the strike , the infantry attacked up the hill at 15 : 30 unopposed and secured it by 16 : 30 . The combined strength of E and F Companies on top of the hill was about sixty men . The artillery preparations and the air strike killed and wounded an estimated 500 enemy troops on Hill 303 , with survivors had fleeing in complete rout after the air strike . 
 In regaining Hill 303 on August 17 , the 5th Cavalry Regiment discovered the bodies of 26 mortarmen of H Company , hands tied in back , with gunshot wounds to the back . First knowledge of the event came in the afternoon when scouts brought in a man from Hill 303 , Pvt. Roy Manring of the Heavy Mortar Platoon , who had been wounded by automatic weapons fire . Manring had crawled down the hill until he saw scouts of the attacking force . In all about 45 men were shot by the North Koreans in the event , of which only five survived . The total number of men executed around Hill 303 is unclear , as several more men were subsequently discovered in other locations around the hill with evidence of execution . Angered , General of the Army Douglas MacArthur , commander of all UN forces in Korea , broadcast a warning to North Korean leaders they would be held accountable for the atrocity . However intercepted documents show the North Korean command was also concerned with the conduct of its troops and issued orders to limit killing of Prisoners of War .

 In the mountains northeast of Waegwan and Hill 303 , the ROK 1st Division continued to suffer North Korean attacks throughout mid @-@ August . North Korean pressure against the ROK division never ceased for long . Under the command of Brigadier General Paik Sun Yup , this division fought an extremely bloody defense of the mountain approaches to Taegu . US planners believed the main North Korean attack would come from west , and so the US command massed its forces to the west of Taegu . The US command mistakenly believed up to 40 @,@ 000 North Korean troops were near Taegu . This number was above the actual troop numbers for North Korea , which had only 70 @,@ 000 men along the entire perimeter . American artillery fire from the 1st Cavalry Division sector supported the South Koreans in this area . The division 's 13th Regiment still held some positions along the river , while the 11th and 12th Regiments battled the North Koreans in the high mountain masses of <unk> @-@ san and Yuhak @-@ san , west and northwest of Tabu @-@ dong and 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) to 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) east of the Naktong River . The North Koreans continued to use the underwater bridge across the Naktong 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) north of Waegwan as their major route for supply and reinforcements . UN forces continued to target this bridge , even scoring a direct hit with a 155mm howitzer , but it was not seriously damaged . 
 Through the middle of August , North Korean forces relentlessly attacked the sectors occupied by the ROK 13th Regiment and the US 5th Cavalry . This assault , together with increasingly heavy pressure against the main force of the ROK 1st Division in the Tabu @-@ dong area , began to endanger the UN control of Taegu . On August 16 , 750 Korean police were stationed on the outskirts of the city to reinforce faltering military lines . Refugees had swollen Taegu 's normal population of 300 @,@ 000 to 700 @,@ 000 . A crisis seemed to be developing among the people on August 18 when several North Korean artillery shells landed in Taegu . The shells , falling near the railroad station , damaged the roundhouse , destroyed one yard engine , killed one Korean civilian , and wounded eight others . The Korean Provincial Government subsequently ordered the evacuation of Taegu , and President Syngman Rhee moved the national leaders to Pusan . Following the ordered evacuation , swarms of panicked Korean refugees began to pour out on the roads leading from the city , threatening to stop all military traffic , but Eighth Army eventually halted the evacuations . 
 On August 14 , General MacArthur ordered Lieutenant General George E. Stratemeyer to conduct a carpet bombing of a 27 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 70 km2 ) rectangular area on the west side of the Naktong River opposite the ROK 1st Division . Intelligence estimates placed the greatest concentrations of enemy troops in this area , some estimates being as high as four enemy divisions and several armored regiments , all of 40 @,@ 000 men , who were reportedly using the area to stage their attack on Taegu . General Gay , commanding the 1st Cavalry Division , repeatedly requested that the bombing include the area northeast of Waegwan . This request was denied because of fear that bombing there might cause casualties among the 1st Cavalry and ROK 1st Division troops . Stratemeyer did not think his aircraft could successfully carpet bomb an area larger than 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) square but he complied with MacArthur 's order anyway . 
 At 11 : 58 , on August 16 , the first of the 98 B @-@ 29 Superfortresses of the 19th , 22nd , 92nd , 98th , and 307th Bomber Groups arrived over the target area from their Far East Air Force bases in Japan and Okinawa . The last planes cleared the target at 1224 . The bombers from 10 @,@ 000 feet dropped approximately 960 tons of 500- and 1 @,@ 000 @-@ pound bombs . The attack had required the entirety of the FEAF bombing component , and they had dropped 3 @,@ 084 500 pounds ( 230 kg ) bombs and 150 1 @,@ 000 pounds ( 450 kg ) bombs . This comprised the largest Air Force operation since the Battle of Normandy in World War II . 
 General Walker reported to General MacArthur the next day that the damage done to the North Koreans by the bombing could not be evaluated because of smoke and dust , and ground forces could not reach it because of North Korean fire . Information obtained later from North Korean prisoners revealed the enemy divisions the Far East Command thought to be still west of the Naktong had already crossed to the east side and were not in the bombed area . No evidence was found that the bombing killed a single North Korean soldier . However , the bombing seems to have destroyed a significant number of North Korean artillery batteries . The UN ground and air commanders opposed future massive carpet bombing attacks against enemy tactical troops unless there was precise information on an enemy concentration and the situation was critical . Instead , they recommended fighter @-@ bombers and dive bombers would better support ground forces . They subsequently canceled a second bombing of an area east of the Naktong scheduled for August 19 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The battles around Taegu saw repeated attempts on the part of the DPRK divisions to attack the city . However , the DPRK troops repeatedly stopped or slowed by American and ROK troops and air attacks . The five North Korean divisions each suffered heavy casualties , and each of them finally collapsed under the strain of both mounting losses and lack of supplies . However , some of these division 's troops were able to disperse into the mountains . Some of these troops later assembled for different battles . These final elements of the DPRK Army were finally defeated in the Battle of the Bowling Alley . 
 Casualties among the American 1st Cavalry Division were relatively light . This division suffered a total of about 600 casualties , with around 200 killed in action , including those at Hill 303 . American forces in established positions were able to decimate North Korean units crossing the Naktong in the open with their artillery fire and air attacks . The exact numbers of soldiers captured and executed compared with those killed in combat are difficult to determine , because of conflicting accounts of how many prisoners were actually held on Hill 303 . The DPRK troops suffered much higher casualties , and also a much higher percentage of them killed in action ( KIA ) . This included 2 @,@ 500 at Yongp 'o , 500 at Hill 303 , and 700 on Triangulation Hill . This places the total KIA at over 3 @,@ 700 troops , though the exact number of casualties is unknown in the carpet @-@ bombing operation because the patrols of the U.N. troops were unable to <unk> this area until much later . 
 = SMS Frankfurt = 
 SMS Frankfurt was a light cruiser of the Wiesbaden class built by the German Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial Navy ) . She had one sister ship , SMS Wiesbaden ; the ships were very similar to the previous Karlsruhe @-@ class cruisers . The ship was laid down in 1913 , launched in March 1915 , and completed by August 1915 . Armed with eight 15 cm SK L / 45 guns , Frankfurt had a top speed of 27 @.@ 5 knots ( 50 @.@ 9 km / h ; 31 @.@ 6 mph ) and displaced 6 @,@ 601 t ( 6 @,@ 497 long tons ; 7 @,@ 276 short tons ) at full load . 
 Frankfurt saw extensive action with the High Seas Fleet during World War I. She served primarily in the North Sea , and participated in the Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft and the battles of Jutland and Second Heligoland . At Jutland , she was lightly damaged by a British cruiser and her crew suffered minor casualties . At the end of the war , she was interned with the bulk of the German fleet in Scapa Flow . When the fleet was scuttled in June 1919 , Frankfurt was one of the few ships that were not successfully sunk . She was ceded to the US Navy as a war prize and ultimately expended as a bomb target in tests conducted by the US Navy and Army Air Force in July 1921 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Frankfurt was ordered under the contract name " Ersatz Hela " and was laid down at the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel in 1913 and launched on 20 March 1915 , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 20 August 1915 , after being rushed through trials . The ship was 145 @.@ 3 meters ( 477 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 13 @.@ 9 m ( 46 ft ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 76 m ( 18 @.@ 9 ft ) forward . She displaced 6 @,@ 601 t ( 6 @,@ 497 long tons ; 7 @,@ 276 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of Marine steam turbines driving two 3 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 11 ft ) propellers . They were designed to give 31 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 23 @,@ 000 kW ) . These were powered by twelve coal @-@ fired Marine @-@ type water @-@ tube boilers and two oil @-@ fired double @-@ ended boilers . These gave the ship a top speed of 27 @.@ 5 knots ( 50 @.@ 9 km / h ; 31 @.@ 6 mph ) . Frankfurt carried 1 @,@ 280 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 260 long tons ) of coal , and an additional 470 tonnes ( 460 long tons ) of oil that gave her a range of 4 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 900 km ; 5 @,@ 500 mi ) at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . Frankfurt had a crew of 17 officers and 457 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with eight 15 cm SK L / 45 guns in single pedestal mounts . Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle , four were located amidships , two on either side , and two were placed in a superfiring pair aft . The guns could engage targets out to 17 @,@ 600 m ( 57 @,@ 700 ft ) . They were supplied with 1 @,@ 024 rounds of ammunition , for 128 shells per gun . The ship 's antiaircraft armament initially consisted of four 5 @.@ 2 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) L / 44 guns , though these were replaced with a pair of 8 @.@ 8 cm SK L / 45 anti @-@ aircraft guns . She was also equipped with four 50 cm ( 19 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes with eight torpedoes . Two were submerged in the hull on the broadside and two were mounted on the deck amidships . She could also carry 120 mines . The ship was protected by a waterline armored belt that was 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick amidships . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides , and the deck was covered with up to 60 mm thick armor plate . 
 = = Service history = = 
 The first operation in which Frankfurt saw action was the Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft on 24 April 1916 . Frankfurt was assigned to the reconnaissance screen for the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group , temporarily under the command of Konteradmiral Friedrich Boedicker 's . During the raid , Frankfurt attacked and sank a British armed patrol boat off the English coast . Due to reports of British submarines and torpedo attacks , Boedicker broke off the chase , and turned back east towards the High Seas Fleet . At this point , Scheer , who had been warned of the Grand Fleet 's sortie from Scapa Flow , turned back towards Germany . 
 = = = Battle of Jutland = = = 
 At the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 , Frankfurt served as Boedicker 's flagship , the commander of the II Scouting Group . The II Scouting Group was again screening for the I Scouting Group battlecruisers , again commanded by Vizeadmiral Franz von Hipper . Frankfurt was engaged in the first action of the battle , when the cruiser screens of the German and British battlecruiser squadrons encountered each other . Frankfurt , Pillau , and Elbing briefly fired on the British light cruisers at 16 : 17 until the British ships turned away . Half an hour later , the fast battleships of the 5th Battle Squadron had reached the scene and opened fire on Frankfurt and the other German cruisers , though the ships quickly fled under a smokescreen and were not hit . 
 Shortly before 18 : 00 , the British destroyers Onslow and Moresby attempted to attack the German battlecruisers . Heavy fire from Frankfurt and Pillau forced the British ships to break off the attack . At around 18 : 30 , Frankfurt and the rest of the II Scouting Group encountered the cruiser HMS Chester ; they opened fire and scored several hits on the ship . Rear Admiral Horace Hood 's three battlecruisers intervened , however , and scored a hit on Wiesbaden that disabled the ship . About an hour later , Chester scored four hits on Frankfurt in quick succession : two 6 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) hits in the area of Frankfurt 's mainmast and a pair of 4 @-@ inch ( 100 mm ) hits . One of the 4 @-@ inch shells hit forward , well above the waterline , and the second exploded in the water near the stern and damaged both screws . 
 Frankfurt and Pillau spotted the cruiser Castor and several destroyers shortly before 23 : 00 . They each fired a torpedo at the British cruiser before turning back toward the German line without using their searchlights or guns to avoid drawing the British toward the German battleships . Almost two hours later , Frankfurt encountered a pair of British destroyers and fired on them briefly until they retreated at full speed . By 04 : 00 on 1 June , the German fleet had evaded the British fleet and reached Horns Reef . Frankfurt had three men killed and eighteen wounded in the course of the engagement . She had fired 379 rounds of 15 cm ammunition and a pair of 8 @.@ 8 cm shells , and launched a single torpedo . 
 = = = Subsequent operations = = = 
 The ship participated in Operation Albion in October 1917 , an operation to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the Gulf of Riga . The ship was part of the II Scouting Group , commanded by Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter . The following month , Frankfurt and the rest of the II Scouting Group were engaged during the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight . Along with three other cruisers from the II Scouting Group , Königsberg escorted minesweepers clearing paths in minefields laid by the British . The dreadnought battleships Kaiser and Kaiserin stood by in distant support . During the battle , Frankfurt fired torpedoes at the attacking British cruisers , but failed to score any hits . The British broke off the attack when the German battleships arrived on the scene , after which the Germans also withdrew . 
 At 19 : 08 on 21 October 1918 , Frankfurt accidentally rammed and sank the U @-@ boat UB @-@ 89 in Kiel @-@ Holtenau , killing seven of her crew . Twenty @-@ seven survivors were pulled from the water . UB @-@ 89 was raised by the salvage tug <unk> on 30 October but with the war almost over , she was not repaired and did not see further service . 
 In the final weeks of the war , Großadmiral Reinhard Scheer and Hipper intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy , in order to secure a better bargaining position for Germany , whatever the cost to the fleet . On the morning of 29 October 1918 , the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day . Starting on the night of 29 October , sailors on Thüringen and then on several other battleships mutinied . The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation . Most of the High Seas Fleet 's ships , including Frankfurt , were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow , under the command of Reuter . 
 = = = Fate = = = 
 The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Versailles Treaty . Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919 , which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty . Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd , Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity . On the morning of 21 June , the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers , and at 11 : 20 Reuter transmitted the order to scuttle his ships . British sailors boarded Frankfurt and beached her before she could sink . 
 She was raised the following month and thereafter transferred to the United States Navy as a war prize . She was formally taken over on 11 March 1920 in England and commissioned into the US Navy on 4 June . Frankfurt was towed to the United States . The ship was ultimately expended as a bomb target on 18 July 1921 for United States Army Air Service and U.S. Navy bombers off Cape Henry , Virginia . The attacks started with small 250 @-@ pound ( 110 kg ) and 300 lb ( 140 kg ) bombs , which caused minor hull damage . The bombers then changed over to larger 550 lb ( 250 kg ) and 600 lb ( 270 kg ) bombs ; Army Air Service Martin MB @-@ 2 bombers hit Frankfurt with several of the 600 lb bombs and sank the ship at 18 : 25 . 
 = The Mega Bucks = 
 The Mega Bucks was a professional wrestling tag team that competed in the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) in 1988 . The team , consisting of " The Million Dollar Man " Ted DiBiase and André the Giant , was formed in a storyline that saw DiBiase purchase André 's contract from fellow manager Bobby Heenan . André was to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Hulk Hogan , but then he attempted to sell the belt to DiBiase . The title was vacated , but DiBiase and André were then scheduled to face Hogan and Macho Man Randy Savage in a match at SummerSlam , which Hogan and Savage won . After the match , DiBiase and André went their separate ways and the team was dissolved .

 Prior to the formation of the team , André the Giant had been engaged in a feud with Hulk Hogan . According to the storyline , André was tired of Hogan being the top wrestler in the WWF and was jealous of Hogan 's reign as WWF World Heavyweight Champion . On an episode of Piper 's Pit , André turned on Hogan by attacking him and challenging him to a match for the championship . Hogan and André faced each other in the main event of WrestleMania III on March 29 , 1987 . Hogan won the match , but the feud remained unsettled . 
 In November 1987 , " The Million Dollar Man " Ted DiBiase announced his intention to buy the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from reigning champion Hulk Hogan . Hogan refused and faced DiBiase in a series of matches instead . After DiBiase lost these matches , he purchased the contract of André the Giant from Bobby " The Brain " Heenan in January 1988 . He planned to help André win the title , after which André would present the belt to DiBiase as a gift . 
 André faced Hogan for the title on the February 5 , 1988 broadcast of The Main Event , with Dave Hebner as the scheduled referee . André pinned Hogan to win the championship and handed the belt to DiBiase . The pinfall was controversial , however , as Hogan 's shoulders were not on the mat when the referee made the three count . After the match , the real Dave Hebner , who looked identical to referee that had officiated the match , ran to the ring to attack the impostor referee . Hulk Hogan then threw the impostor out of the ring onto DiBiase and his bodyguard Virgil . According to the storyline , DiBiase had paid an unnamed referee to get plastic surgery to look exactly like Dave Hebner . In reality , the second referee was Dave 's twin brother Earl Hebner , who was making his on @-@ screen debut with the WWF . 
 = = = Feud with The Mega Powers = = = 
 The controversy resulted in WWF President Jack Tunney declaring the WWF World Heavyweight Championship vacant and booking a 14 @-@ man tournament at WrestleMania IV to determine the new champion . In the tournament , André and Hogan were booked to face each other . Their match ended in a double disqualification , and both men were eliminated from the tournament . Meanwhile , André interfered in DiBiase 's matches , which helped DiBiase make it to the final match , in which he faced " Macho Man " Randy Savage . After André got involved to help DiBiase , Hogan came to the ring to even the odds . Savage won the match and the championship , and the rivalry led to a match being booked between The Mega Powers ( Hogan and Savage ) and The Mega Bucks ( DiBiase and André ) . After WrestleMania IV , Andre returned to The Heenan Family , with the explanation that Heenan purchased his contract back at a profit , but his association with DiBiase continued . 
 At the inaugural SummerSlam , the two teams faced off . Jesse Ventura had been appointed as a supposedly impartial guest referee by Jack Tunney . It was strongly hinted leading up the event that Ventura , who provided commentary for many WWF events and was a strong critic of Hulk Hogan , had been paid an undisclosed amount by DiBiase . Near the end of the SummerSlam match , Elizabeth , the manager of The Mega Powers , got involved to help her team . She stripped off her skirt to expose her skimpy panties to the stunned Mega Bucks , which allowed The Mega Powers to make a comeback and win the match . While counting the pinfall , Ventura stopped counting at two and hesitated until Savage pushed Ventura 's hand to the mat to complete the three count .

 This match marked the end of the feud between Hulk Hogan and André the Giant that had dominated WWF programming for over 18 months .

 Velvet Revolver was an American hard rock supergroup consisting of former Guns N ' Roses members Slash ( lead guitar ) , Duff McKagan ( bass , backing vocals ) , and Matt Sorum ( drums , backing vocals ) , alongside Dave Kushner ( rhythm guitar ) formerly of punk band Wasted Youth . Original vocalist Scott Weiland formerly of Stone Temple Pilots left the band in 2008 . In 2004 , the band achieved commercial success with their debut album , Contraband . Despite positive reviews , some critics initially described Velvet Revolver as a mere combination of Stone Temple Pilots and Guns N ' Roses , criticizing them for a " disconnection " between Scott Weiland and the rest of the band . With their single " Slither " , they won the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance . 
 The band released Libertad in 2007 , driven by the release of the single " She Builds Quick Machines " , and embarked on a tour with Alice in Chains . In April 2008 , Weiland left Velvet Revolver and reunited with Stone Temple Pilots . Velvet Revolver was put on indefinite hiatus in April 2008 , and in November of that year , the band was released by their record label RCA Records at their request to allow them " complete freedom to go through whatever process it would take to accomplish " replacing Weiland . 
 The release of Slash 's self @-@ titled debut solo album and Duff McKagan 's addition to the Jane 's Addiction lineup seemed to put the future of the band in doubt . However , McKagan left Jane 's Addiction a few months after joining . Velvet Revolver then wrote new songs and briefly auditioned singers before once again resuming their hiatus , although reunited with Scott Weiland for a one @-@ off reunion show on January 12 , 2012 at a benefit concert , which proved to be their last performance together before Weiland 's death in 2015 .

 Slash , Duff McKagan , and Matt Sorum were members of hard rock band Guns N ' Roses . However , a distancing relationship with singer Axl Rose resulted in Slash , in 1996 , and McKagan , in 1997 , leaving the band while Sorum was fired the same year . Following their departures , the trio focused on separate projects with Slash reforming Slash 's Snakepit and McKagan reforming 10 Minute Warning , as well as recording his second solo album while Sorum rejoined The Cult . 
 By 2001 , Slash 's Snakepit had disbanded for the second time . Slash began working with The Black Crowes drummer Steve Gorman and an unnamed bassist on a new project : writing the music for what would become " Fall to Pieces " . McKagan reformed Loaded , previously his band for the tour in support of Beautiful Disease , with Geoff Reading . McKagan also added both Mike Squires and Jeff Rouse to the lineup . Following a tour of Japan in 2002 , former Zilch , Wasted Youth , Electric Love Hogs , and Dave Navarro guitarist Dave Kushner joined Loaded in place of Mike Squires .

 When musician Randy Castillo died from cancer in 2002 , Slash , McKagan , and Sorum performed at a benefit concert to raise money and commemorate Castillo with Josh Todd and Keith Nelson of Buckcherry as well as B @-@ Real and Sen Dog of Cypress Hill . Recognizing that their musical relationship was still intact , the trio began rehearsing with Todd and Nelson , working on material that would become " Dirty Little Thing " , but eventually decided against forming a group with them . During a Loaded show at West Hollywood 's Viper Room , McKagan introduced Kushner to Slash , who were previously friends in junior high and high school . Kushner was invited to jam with the group and was soon invited to join with Slash , stating that " Dave brought a cool vibe to what [ they ] were doing . There was no deliberation ; that was it , it was a perfect fit . " Their former Guns N ' Roses band mate Izzy Stradlin also joined them for two weeks , eventually suggesting that " Duff and [ Stradlin ] will sing and [ they ] will just do a club tour in a van . " Slash states in his autobiography that it was hard to tell if Stradlin was serious or kidding . After auditioning Kelly Shaefer of Atheist and Neurotica , Stradlin left the group . 
 While Shaefer 's audition was unsuccessful , the quartet continued auditioning for a lead singer , with VH1 filming the recruitment process while being referred to as the temporary name " The Project " . The resulting documentary was aired as VH1 Inside Out : The Rise of Velvet Revolver . A number of lead singers auditioned for the band , including Steve Ludwin , of Carrie and Little Hell , Todd Kerns , formerly of Age of Electric , Sebastian Bach , formerly of Skid Row , Shawn Albro of <unk> , and Travis Meeks of Days of the New . Myles Kennedy , formerly of The Mayfield Four , declined an invitation from Sorum to audition . Ian Astbury of The Cult and Mike Patton of Faith No More also declined audition offers . The band were also interested in auditioning Stone Temple Pilots singer Scott Weiland , who had become friends with McKagan after attending the same gym . Weiland once played on the same bill as Kushner , and was in rehab at the same time as Sorum . Weiland was sent two discs of material , and felt that the first disc " sounded like Bad Company gone wrong . " When he was sent the second disc , Weiland was more positive , comparing it to Core @-@ era Stone Temple Pilots , though he turned them down because Stone Temple Pilots were still together . 
 When Stone Temple Pilots disbanded in 2003 , the band sent Weiland new music , which he took into his studio and added vocals . This music eventually becoming the song " Set Me Free " . Weiland was still unsure whether or not he wanted to join , despite delivering the music to the band himself and performing at an industry showcase at Mates . They recorded two songs with producer Nick Raskulinecz , a recorded version of " Set Me Free " and a cover of Pink Floyd 's " Money " , for the soundtracks to the movies The Hulk and The Italian Job , respectively . Weiland joined the band soon after . " Set Me Free " managed to peak at number 17 on the Mainstream Rock Chart without any radio promotion or a record label . It was prior to a screening of The Hulk at Universal Studios that the band chose a name . After seeing a movie by Revolution Studios , Slash liked the beginning of the word , eventually thinking of Revolver because of its multiple meanings ; the name of a gun , subtext of a revolving door which suited the band as well as the name of a Beatles album . When he suggested Revolver to the band , Weiland suggested back Black Velvet Revolver , liking the idea of " something intimate like velvet juxtaposed with something deadly like a gun . " They eventually arrived at Velvet Revolver , announcing it at a press conference and performance showcase at the El Rey Theatre while also performing the songs " Set Me Free " and " Slither " as well as covers of Nirvana 's " Negative Creep " , Sex Pistols ' " Pretty Vacant " , and Guns N ' Roses ' " It 's So Easy " .

 Prior to the recording of their debut album , Weiland took material that the band had previously written to his studio , Lavish , in Toluca Lake . With engineer Doug Grean , Weiland rearranged the music to fit his vocals , eventually coming out with the songs " Big Machine " and " Dirty Little Thing " . The band worked on new material for songs such as " You Got No Right " , " Slither " , " Sucker Train Blues " , and " Do It for the Kids " , among others . It was during this time that Weiland was arrested at the parking lot of his studio for drug possession . Upon release from jail , he wrote lyrics to material he was given previously , writing the lyrics to the song " Fall to Pieces " . Velvet Revolver soon began recording their debut album . Initially , they recorded " Slither " with producer Bob Ezrin at Henson Studios , but were dissatisfied with the result . After recording " Headspace " with Josh Abraham , the band liked the track enough to do the rest of the album with him . 
 Velvet Revolver soon gained major label attention with Warner Bros. and Chrysalis . RCA and Elektra were also interested in signing the band . They eventually signed with RCA Records . They recorded their album at NRG Recording Studios , while Slash recorded his guitar parts at a smaller studio on the southern corner between Highland Avenue and Sunset Boulevard . During recording , Weiland could only work for three hours a day due to a court order mentioning that he was to stay in a halfway house . The marketing campaign for Velvet Revolver in the run @-@ up to the release of the first album was profiled as part of the Frontline program The Way the Music Died , which included interviews with the band members and producers . 
 The resulting album , titled Contraband , was released on June 8 , 2004 , and , helped by the success of the single " Slither " , debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 , selling over 250 @,@ 000 copies in the first week . Contraband went on to sell four million copies worldwide , 2 @.@ 9 million of which were sold in the United States , and was certified 2x platinum by the RIAA . Both " Slither " and " Fall to Pieces " managed to peak at number one on the Mainstream Rock Chart as well as number 56 and 67 on the Billboard Hot 100 , respectively . " Slither " also peaked at number one on the Modern Rock Chart and number 35 on the UK Singles Chart . The album 's third single , " Dirty Little Thing " , peaked at number eight on the Mainstream Rock chart . 
 Critically , the album was generally well received . Despite being praised for its hedonism and maturity , critics noted a disconnection between " singer and band " . Velvet Revolver won the Kerrang ! Award for Best International Newcomer in 2004 , and the following year they won the Best Hard Rock Performance Grammy Award for " Slither " . They also received a nomination for Rock Artist of the Year at the Billboard Music Awards while " Fall to Pieces " was nominated for a Song of the Year / Rock Radio Radio Music Award . They recorded a new song entitled " Come On , Come In " for the movie Fantastic Four in 2005 , which peaked at number 14 on the Mainstream Rock Chart . " Fall to Pieces " then re @-@ entered the charts , peaking at number twenty @-@ five on the Adult Top 40 the same year . 
 Velvet Revolver toured extensively for nineteen months in support of Contraband . They toured both the United States and Europe twice , while also performing in Australia , New Zealand , and Japan . They performed at Live 8 and various festivals including Download Festival and Ozzfest . It was during the tour that the band members , with the exception of Kushner , began to relapse on alcohol and drugs . Though they managed to get clean in time for the recording of their new album , Slash felt that " [ the band ] lost [ Weiland ] " and " thought the overall spirit of everything was declining at that point . " 
 = = = Libertad and departure of Scott Weiland ( 2005 – 2008 ) = = = 
 Weiland announced in 2005 that Velvet Revolver 's next album would be titled Libertad and would be a concept album . When they started writing material , they decided against the concept idea . Initially , the band started working with producer Rick Rubin on the album . However , due to his methods , such as having a crew to do the work and engineering while only popping in occasionally , and due to the fact that he was also working with other bands at the same time , they decided against continuing with Rubin . At the suggestion of Weiland , Velvet Revolver began working with Brendan O 'Brien . Slash stated that O ' Brien " brought more than just discipline to the equation , he brought a musicality that stems from the fact that he plays guitar , bass and drums . At any given moment he could play along [ with the band ] and it really helped the process . " He also said that the " sessions were consistent , everyone was there , everyone contributed , and everyone appreciated what each player was doing " and that the " mutual participation surpassed the first Guns sessions . " While writing for the album , Weiland believed that his band mates were going to reunite with Guns N ' Roses when the band 's manager was talking to Axl Rose about switching management companies , and were not going to record their second album . He was later convinced by the band that this was not the case . 
 Following the completion of the album , Velvet Revolver performed for and inducted Van Halen into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , with Weiland and Slash speaking on the band 's behalf , on March 12 , 2007 . The band played a medley of " Ain 't Talkin ' ' bout Love " and " Runaround " . Shows in South America with Aerosmith followed in April . They released the EP Melody and the Tyranny on June 1 to serve as a precursor to the release of their new album , which featured two songs from Libertad , a cover of Talking Heads song " Psycho Killer " and a video documentary about the making of Libertad as well as a live video of the band performing " Do It for the Kids " . 
 Libertad was released on July 3 , 2007 , peaking at number five on the Billboard 200 . The album 's first single " She Builds Quick Machines " peaked at 74 on the Hot Canadian Digital Singles . The second and third singles , " The Last Fight " and " Get Out the Door " , both peaked at number 16 and 34 on the Mainstream Rock Chart , respectively . Critical reception to the album was mixed . Though some critics praised the album and felt that Libertad gave the band an identity of their own , outside of the Guns N ' Roses and Stone Temple Pilots comparisons , others described the album as " bland " and noted that the band have still to gel with them " play [ ing ] to their strengths instead of finding a collective sound . " 
 In support of Libertad , Velvet Revolver toured North America with Alice in Chains from August 2007 to October . They also performed at the Virgin Festival , Gods of Metal , and Download in 2007 . A November tour of Japan was canceled after they were denied visas , and in 2008 , a tour of Australia was postponed , due to health issues , and later canceled following Weiland 's decision to voluntarily enter a rehab facility . On November 21 , 2007 , Weiland was arrested after crashing his car while driving on an L.A. highway . He was charged with driving under the influence of drugs with a prior conviction and later released on $ 40 @,@ 000 bail . Velvet Revolver then toured both the US and the UK , as well as some European shows , on the Rock n ' Roll as It Should Be tour from January 24 to April 1 , 2008 . They also played at the Dubai Desert Rock Festival on March 8 the same year . It was during the tour that Weiland " got back into his old ways " , which started to take their toll on the rest of the band with the cancellation of the Australian tour seen as the " final blow " . 
 On the UK tour , the band members never spoke with Weiland , with the exception of a few arguments around the stage . Tensions came to a head during Velvet Revolver 's Glasgow show on March 20 , 2008 , where Weiland announced to the crowd that it was the band 's last tour , unaware that the band were already planning on firing him . After Sorum posted a message about the show on his website , Weiland issued a statement through Blabbermouth.net in response , saying he " made many attempts to remain cordial with the members of [ Velvet Revolver ] , but mainly , the likes of [ Sorum ] " and that " [ the band ] were a gang . But ego and jealousy can get the better of anyone . " Slash later stated that it would not be Velvet Revolver 's last tour . Weiland 's departure was announced on April 1 . Weiland also departed the cover band Camp Freddy , which also featured Sorum , and has since reunited with Stone Temple Pilots , before being fired in 2012 . 
 = = = Search for a new singer and solo careers ( 2008 – 2015 ) = = = 
 After Weiland 's departure , the band began recording and searching for a new singer . The search was sporadic with the band spending some time auditioning singers , then turning into solo projects , returning to the band , then abandoning it again . Several names were rumoured to be auditioning for the band through the years . Myles Kennedy ( Alter Bridge ) was strongly rumoured due to his collaborations with Slash ; Lenny Kravitz , Chester Bennington of Linkin Park , Steve Isaacs formerly of <unk> and The Panic Channel , Royston Langdon of Spacehog , Donovan Leitch of Camp Freddy , Ours singer Jimmy <unk> and Scars on Broadway guitarist Franky Perez , as well as previous <unk> Sebastian Bach . Slipknot and Stone Sour singer Corey Taylor reportedly recorded an album with the band , which was shelved . 
 Slash , McKagan , and Sorum all contributed to the song " Kissed It " for the Macy Gray album The Sellout , which was released on June 22 , 2011 . Despite not featuring Kushner , the trio were credited as Velvet Revolver on the album . The band released their first concert DVD on November 16 , 2010 entitled Live In Houston , which was filmed June 18 , 2004 at the Verizon Wireless Theater while the band was touring in support of Contraband . Slash , McKagan and Sorum made a performance at the Road Recovery benefit concert on September 13 with a guest appearance from Kushner . 
 Instigated by Kushner 's wife , Velvet Revolver reunited for a one @-@ off performance with Scott Weiland at a benefit concert for the late John O 'Brien , on January 12 , 2012 . Following a benefit show for the Road Recovery in 2011 with the other VR members , each one agreed to a one @-@ off reunion before Kushner invited Weiland , who also agreed . Kushner also stated it is currently unknown what Velvet Revolver 's plans are for the future after the reunion show ; " I know everyone ’ s got other commitments , but I think everyone ’ s like , ' Let ’ s get this thing done and get through this and then we ’ ll see . ' " . 
 In April 2012 , Scott Weiland remarked that he would like to reunite permanently with Velvet Revolver , saying that " if Maynard James Keenan can do it with A Perfect Circle and Tool , then there ’ s no reason why I shouldn ’ t go and do it with both bands " . Further in May in an interview with ABC Radio Weiland said that he has reunited with the band permanently for a tour and an album , which however was denied a few days later by Slash in an interview with <unk> . 
 On May 12 , 2014 , in an interview at the MusiCares benefit concert , Slash told journalist Lucas H. Gordon that he " think [ s ] [ they 're ] gonna audition a singer " in the future . However , he also stated that he would be touring with his solo band " for the next year and a half . " 
 On June 29 , 2014 , in an interview to <unk> radio Duff McKagan talked to Hayley <unk> in Clisson France about the subject of a new lead vocalist for Velvet Revolver and revealed that there has been at least one audition for the role of lead vocalist , but said that the person that they auditioned did not properly impress the remaining members of the band . He also ruled himself out of being the lead vocalist of Velvet Revolver due to the experiences he has had of being the vocalist of his own band Loaded , saying that being the lead vocalist and being a bass player at the same time was not as appealing to him because of the fact that it would require him to be a lot more static in his stage presence , saying that he prefers moving around on stage during live performances . In the same interview , Duff McKagan talked about his new book which is currently in the writing stages . 
 On December 3 , 2015 Scott Weiland was found dead on his tour bus around 9 pm , one day before he was to perform in Minnesota with his band The <unk> . Both Slash and Duff have since rejoined Guns N ' Roses . 
 = = Musical style = = 
 Velvet Revolver 's first album Contraband was described by Johnny Loftus of Allmusic as an " updated version of Guns N ' Roses swagger behind Scott Weiland 's glammy , elastic vocals . " David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that " [ a ] nyone expecting Use Your Illusion III , though , will be in for a slight buzzkill " and that " [ t ] he songs suggest the pop grunge of Weiland 's old band more than the careening overdrive of GN <unk> . " A number of reviewers made some comparisons to the members previous bands with PopMatters reviewer David Powell stating that " Contraband is a pretty good record of unpretentious rock and roll that suffers from inevitable comparison with the best efforts of its parent bands . " He went on to state that while Velvet Revolver 's " heritage is evident on most of the songs " , Contraband " improves with repeat listening , which is encouraging . " Velvet Revolver 's second album Libertad saw the band 's style change with the presence of producer Brendan O 'Brien , noted by Allmusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine . Erlewine also stated that " too often , there are concessions between Weiland and the others during the course of a song . " Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that Libertad " feels both <unk> familiar and vaguely exotic . " Songs such as " Let it Roll " and " She Mine " have seen some comparisons to The Doors , The Rolling Stones and The Stooges , as noted by San Francisco Chronicle reviewer Jaan Uhelszki . The New York Post commented that " Slash 's guitar riffs throughout this new record are as aggressive as a caged cat " and " singer Scott Weiland 's vocals are crisp and controlled yet passionate .

 Yoshi 's Island DS , later released in Japan as Yoshi Island DS ( <unk> <unk> DS , <unk> Airando Dī Esu ) , is a platforming video game developed by Artoon for the Nintendo DS . Published by Nintendo , it was released in North America and Australasia in November 2006 , in Europe in December 2006 , and in Japan in March 2007 . It is the sequel to the 1995 SNES game , Super Mario World 2 : Yoshi 's Island . Announced at Nintendo 's E3 press conference in May 2006 , the game was well received by critics , scoring an average of 81 % on Metacritic 's aggregate . The game was originally to be titled Yoshi 's Island 2 , though its name was changed two weeks before its North American release . On April 1 , 2015 , the game was made available for the Wii U via the Virtual Console service shortly after a Nintendo Direct presentation . 
 The game 's story focuses on the Yoshi clan as they attempt to rescue newborn children who have been kidnapped by Kamek . Yoshi 's Island DS uses the same updated graphical style as Yoshi Touch & Go but retains the same core gameplay as its Super Nintendo Entertainment System predecessor ; but whereas the SNES game featured only Baby Mario , DS introduces Baby Peach , Baby Donkey Kong , and Baby Wario , while allowing the player to control Baby Bowser . Each baby bestows a different ability upon Yoshi . The objective of the game is to use these abilities to progress through various themed worlds . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Yoshi 's Island DS 's gameplay is the same as the previous game , with some additions . Just like in Super Mario World 2 : Yoshi 's Island the player guides various colored Yoshis through side scrolling stages . Yoshi can jump and hover ( flutter jump ) for a short time , eat enemies and turn them into eggs ( which can be used for things like hitting switches and defeating distant enemies ) and pound the ground ( to smash crates , for example ) . Some stages offer Yoshi the ability to morph into vehicles for a short time . Like the original Yoshi 's Island , the DS game differs from many platforming series in that Yoshi does not have a life bar ; when Yoshi is hit , the baby he is carrying falls off his back and Yoshi must retrieve him or her before a timer expires . ( unless Yoshi falls on something that kills him instantly , such as a lava pit or spike field ) 
 What makes Yoshi 's Island DS different is the addition of five babies for Yoshi to carry , each bestowing a different ability — Baby Mario allows Yoshi to dash and makes special ' M ' blocks appear , and can grab Super Stars to become Super Baby Mario , and grants ricocheting eggs ; Baby Peach allows Yoshi to float and fly on wind currents and grants a more forgiving timing to use Yoshi 's flutter jumping abilities effectively ; Baby Donkey Kong can grab and swing on vines and ropes , grants a special dash attack , allows Yoshi 's eggs to explode as per Yoshi 's Story ( but they do so on impact ) and allows Yoshi to push objects faster ; Baby Wario uses his magnet to attract metal objects and allows Yoshi 's eggs to bounce ; and Baby Bowser spits fireballs , but the Yoshi carrying him cannot make eggs , though the eggs Yoshi already carries can bounce . The last three babies tend to make the timing for Yoshi 's flutter jumping less forgiving and slow down his movement a little bit . The need to switch babies at key points adds a puzzle element to the game . 
 The Nintendo DS 's two screens act as one tall screen ; however , in practice , this essentially just gives the player a better view of the surroundings and , save for one boss battle , ( Hector the Reflector , where the bottom screen acts as a mirror through which to see Hector during the battle ) only provides the benefit of being able to see more ( above ) and , when the player is on the top screen , below . The game does not make use of the bottom screen 's touch sensitivity for basic gameplay , though it is an option for selecting levels and in some mini @-@ games . Each of DS 's five worlds has two bosses , each with a weakness that must be identified and exploited . Most of the time , these are simply giant @-@ sized versions of normal enemies , though some are more inventive . 
 Flowers and coins , as well as stars , are scattered about the game 's stages . These are totaled at the end of each stage and a score is given depending how many of each were collected ( a maximum of 30 stars , 20 red coins and 5 flowers ) . Sufficiently high scores are required to unlock one of the two sets of secret levels . ( the other set being unlocked upon completing the game , similar to the GBA remake of the original game ) Special character coins are also introduced . Missing from the game are the power @-@ ups of sorts — like the ability to spit seeds by eating watermelons — which were present in the original . The fire breathing ability is retained though : Yoshi can use it when he snags a torch or fireball with his tongue . This allows him to shoot streams of fire up to three times . Keys found in the stages unlock mini @-@ games and doors that would be closed otherwise .

 As in Super Mario World 2 : Yoshi 's Island , Baby Mario and the Yoshi clan must rescue Baby Luigi , who was snatched by Bowser 's minion , Kamek , who also wanted to kidnap every baby around the world . However , this time the Yoshis have the combined assistance of both Baby Peach and Baby Donkey Kong , as well as the stork , who escaped the botched capture by the Magikoopa . They later join with Baby Wario and Baby Bowser , who offer their specialized abilities so that the group may proceed . However , Baby Wario 's lust for treasure leads him to abandon his duties while Baby Bowser was captured by Kamek ( who is actually the future Kamek that appears throughout the forts and castles ) , and later kicked out by the Adult Bowser , who came from the future , for his baby counterpart insults him . Baby Bowser then joined the group until he noticed Kamek and after him , leaving Yoshi and the other babies to continue their journey . Much later in the game , Kamek 's sinister plan for kidnapping the babies around the world has been revealed . He and Bowser travels back in time in search of the star children — seven babies whose hearts possess unimaginable power necessary for him to conquer the universe . Despite kidnapping all of the babies , they couldn 't find a single star child . Yoshi 's group later arrives at Bowser 's castle and Baby Wario and Baby Bowser , arguing for after the treasure from Bowser 's castle . They later joined the group and as they arrived at the final room , Baby Bowser betrays them , claiming that Yoshi and the other babies wanted Bowser 's treasure in his castle . Yoshi easily defeated him and Kamek arrives , along with Bowser , angered at what Yoshi did to his infant self . Despite this , the babies and Yoshis prevail , in both defeating Bowser , forces Kamek and Bowser retreats to their present time . Yoshi and the babies then retrieving Baby Luigi and the other babies . Bowser 's castle then self @-@ destructs but Yoshi and the other babies ( with the help of the other storks carrying all of the babies ) escaped unharmed and the storks continues to bring all the babies back to their respective home . 
 In post @-@ credit scene , the seven star children are revealed to be Baby Mario , Baby Luigi , Baby Peach , Baby Donkey Kong , Baby Wario and Baby Bowser as well as Baby Yoshi , who just hatched from an egg . 
 = = Development = = 
 Yoshi 's Island DS was announced at E3 2006 under the name Yoshi 's Island 2 , originally featuring only baby versions of Mario , Peach , and DK . The developer , Artoon , has made one other Yoshi game — Yoshi 's Universal Gravitation — for the GBA . Universal Gravitation veered away from the " Nintendo " design ; but for DS , Artoon stuck close to the original concept . 
 The game retains the classic pastel / crayon visuals from its predecessor . Small changes are noticeable — water animation has been improved , the black outlines around objects are not as thick and the backgrounds are less cluttered ; but the visuals are still tightly @-@ centered on those of the SNES game . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Yoshi 's Island DS received critical praise , being given high scores by some of the most prominent video game critics . These include gaming websites IGN and GameSpot , who gave it 8 / 10 and 9 @.@ 1 / 10 respectively . GameSpot 's review commented that the developers have " produced a sequel that seems fresh and new while remaining every bit as awesome as the original . " Multimedia website IGN called it " a solid recreation of the Yoshi 's Island elements in a two @-@ screen @-@ high format , " and GamePro in their review said that " it 's fun and light @-@ hearted play . " Reviewers were particularly pleased with how the core gameplay elements are the same as in the previous game . GamePro hails it as having " the classical 2D side @-@ scrolling action and colorful pastel artwork that brought Nintendo to prominence , " while IGN — although impressed with the game in general — wonders whether or not the developers " stuck too close to the established design in this new game , " because having played the previous game " ruins a lot of the surprises . " Other critics regard this as the best portable Yoshi 's game , with the exception of the Super Mario Advance remake of the original Yoshi 's Island because , in their context , " ( Yoshi ) Topsy @-@ Turvy was not there and ( Yoshi ) Touch & Go was incomplete . " 
 One problem critics identified is the blind spot created by the gap between the Nintendo DS 's two screens . IGN accepts that this blind spot is necessary for aiming eggs properly but still describe it as " bothersome . " GameSpy 's reviewer calls it " a pain " and expresses frustration at being hit by an enemy hiding in this gap . On the whole , reviewers were pleased with the way the extra babies have been implemented , but IGN felt that Baby Wario was " a last minute addition that wasn 't tested properly . " They call his magnet " wonky , " and says it " misses items that are right next to him . " 
 Yoshi 's Island DS was given GameSpot 's " Editor 's Choice " rating , and reached the final round for " Best Nintendo DS game . " The game sold more than 300 @,@ 000 copies in its first week of release in Japan . As of March 31 , 2008 , Yoshi 's Island DS has sold 2 @.@ 91 million copies worldwide . 
 = Izz ad @-@ Din al @-@ Qassam = 
 Izz ad @-@ Din Abd al @-@ <unk> ibn Mustafa ibn Yusuf ibn Muhammad al @-@ Qassam ( 1881 or 1882 – 1935 ) ( Arabic : <unk> الدين بن عبد <unk> بن <unk> بن <unk> بن محمد <unk> / ALA @-@ LC : <unk> ad @-@ Dīn ibn Abd al @-@ <unk> ibn Mustafa ibn Yūsuf ibn Muhammad al @-@ <unk> ) was a Syrian Muslim preacher and a leader in the local struggles against British and French Mandatory rule in the Levant , and a militant opponent of Zionism in the 1920s and 1930s . 
 Al @-@ Qassam studied at Al @-@ Azhar University in Egypt and afterward became an Islamic revivalist preacher in his hometown of Jableh in Syria during the last years of Ottoman rule . Following his return , he became an active supporter of the Libyan resistance to Italian rule , raising funds and fighters to aid the Libyans and penning an anthem for them . He would later lead his own group of rebels in alliance with Ibrahim Hananu to fight against French Mandatory forces in northern Syria in 1919 – 20 . 
 Following the rebels ' defeat , he immigrated to Palestine , where he became a Muslim waqf ( religious endowments ) official and grew incensed at the plight of Palestinian Arab peasants . In the 1930s , he formed bands of local fighters and launched attacks against British and Jewish targets . He was eventually killed in a manhunt following his alleged role in the killing of a British policeman . Israeli historian Tom Segev has called him ' the Arab Joseph <unk> ' . His campaign and death were factors that led to the 1936 – 39 Arab revolt in Palestine . 
 = = Early life and Muslim scholarship = = 
 Al @-@ Qassam was born in Jableh , northwestern Syria , to father Abd al @-@ <unk> , a Sharia court official during Ottoman rule and a local leader of the Qadariyya Sufi order . His grandfather had been a leading sheikh of the Qadariyya order and moved to Jableh from Iraq . Al @-@ Qassam also followed the Hanafi fiqh ( school of jurisprudence ) of Sunni Islam and studied at the local <unk> Mosque under the teaching of well @-@ known ′ <unk> ( scholar ) Sheikh Salim <unk> . 
 Sometime between 1902 and 1905 , al @-@ Qassam left for Cairo to study at the al @-@ Azhar Mosque . Who he studied with is disputed by sources ; some accounts say he studied under the Muslim reformist scholar Muhammad Abduh and came into contact with the prominent proto @-@ Salafist , Rashid Rida , who himself studied under Abduh , while others are skeptical of al @-@ Qassam 's relationships with either . However , the attitude al @-@ Qassam later adopted toward the political issues in the Arab world suggests he was well @-@ acquainted with the ideas Abduh and Rida espoused . At al @-@ Azhar , al @-@ Qassam developed the thinking that would guide his future activism . Critical of a stagnant Islam , he preached among the ranks of farmers and other locals about the necessity for a modern Islam , one capable of defending itself from Western colonialism through jihad ( holy struggle ) . He returned to Jableh in 1909 as an ′ <unk> and worked as a teacher at a Qadariyya madrasa ( Islamic school ) where he taught both the mystical practices of the Qadariyya Sufi order and the jurisprudence and commentary of the Qur 'an . In addition he preached as the imam of the Ibrahim Ibn <unk> Mosque . 
 Following his return to Jableh , al @-@ Qassam commenced a program of Islamic revival based on moral reforms which included the encouragement of maintaining regular <unk> ( prayer ) and the <unk> ( fasting ) during Ramadan as well as advocating an end to gambling and alcohol consumption . Al @-@ Qassam 's campaign highly influenced Jableh 's residents who increasingly adopted his reforms . He developed amiable relations with the local Ottoman police who he would call upon to enforce Sharia law on rare cases of major violations . In some occasions , he would send disciples as vigilantes to intercept caravans transporting alcohol which would then be disposed of . Despite the support for Arab nationalism from some of his fellow alumni at al @-@ Azhar and among Syrian notables , al @-@ Qassam 's loyalties most likely laid with the Ottoman Empire as his relationship with the authorities would indicate . He was well @-@ regarded among much of Jableh 's population where he gained a reputation for piety , simple manners and good humor . 
 = = Support for Libyan resistance = = 
 Following Italy 's September 1911 invasion of Libya , al @-@ Qassam began collecting funds in Jableh for the joint Ottoman @-@ Libyan resistance movement and composed a victory anthem . Jableh 's district governor sought to gain control over the fundraiser and when locals nevertheless continued to send their donations to al @-@ Qassam , he attempted to have him jailed . The district governor alleged that al @-@ Qassam was working against the Ottoman state , but an official investigation found him not guilty and the governor was consequently dismissed . 
 In June 1912 , during one of his Friday prayer sermons , he called for volunteers to engage in a jihad against the Italians . Accepting only volunteers with prior Ottoman military training , al @-@ Qassam enlisted dozens of volunteers and set up a fund for the expedition to Libya as well as a small pension for the families of volunteers while they were abroad . Although accounts vary , al @-@ Qassam was accompanied by 60 to 250 volunteers known as mujahideen ( those who engage in jihad ) when he arrived in Alexandretta in the latter part of that year . Intending to gain sea transportation from the Ottomans , al @-@ Qassam 's request was rejected by the authorities who ordered him and his men back to Jableh . A new Ottoman government in Istanbul had gained power and shifted the state 's focus to the Balkan front in October , abandoning the Libyan resistance . Part of the money that was raised was then used to establish a madrasa in Jableh while the remainder was saved for future efforts .

 He later enlisted in the Ottoman army when World War I broke out , where he received military training and was attached as a chaplain to a base near Damascus . Returning to Jableh before the war 's end , al @-@ Qassam used funds from his planned expedition to Libya to organize a local defense force to fight the French occupation . His principal role in the local resistance was financing the acquisition of weapons for Jableh 's militia . By 1919 , French forces moved into the coastal area of northern Syria while Faisal I established the Kingdom of Syria in Damascus as an independent Arab state . During this period , al @-@ Qassam 's Jableh militia fought against local French @-@ backed Alawite militiamen who occupied areas around the city . The Alawites were eventually repelled , but French forces moved in soon after to consolidate their control . Consequently , al @-@ Qassam and many of his disciples left Jableh for Mount Sahyun where he established a base near the village of <unk> to launch guerrilla raids against the French Army . 
 Al @-@ Qassam 's militia grew when it was joined by another militia based in the mountains following the death of its commander Umar al @-@ Bitar . However , as the French tightened their control of the area , they were able to successfully pressure several of Jableh 's major landowners to drop their financial support for al @-@ Qassam and pay taxes to the French Mandate government . This further isolated al @-@ Qassam who decided to flee Mount Sahyun for Aleppo in May 1920 . There he and his fighters joined ranks with Ibrahim Hananu who was leading attacks against the French Army until the latter captured Jisr ash @-@ <unk> in July . As a result of this French victory and the impending capitulation of Aleppo , al @-@ Qassam and members of his unit fled past French Army lines with forged passports to Tartus .

 From Tartus , al @-@ Qassam traveled to Beirut by boat and then to Haifa , then under the British Mandate , where his wife and daughters later joined him . During the early 1920s , al @-@ Qassam taught at the Madrasa <unk> , an Islamic educational institution with many schools in Haifa and its periphery . It was funded by the Jamiat <unk> , a waqf ( religious endowments ) administered by prominent Muslims from the city . Unlike other Muslim scholars , al @-@ Qassam made himself easily accessible to the public and often arrived late to teach his classes because he was frequently stopped by passersby for advice . He resigned from his teaching career due to the school 's insistence that he maintain consistent hours . As part of his Islamic revivalist teaching , he denounced and discouraged some local Palestinian traditions , including unorthodox funeral rituals , mothers ' visitation to the al @-@ Khidr shrine near Mount Carmel to give thanks for their children 's well @-@ being or achievements and tribal dances around religious sites , as superstitious innovations to Islam . 
 Al @-@ Qassam concentrated his activities on the lower classes , setting up a night school for casual laborers and preaching to them as an imam , first in the <unk> Mosque , and later in the Istiqlal Mosque . He would seek them out on the streets , in brothels and hashish dens . His greatest following came from the landless ex @-@ tenant farmers drifting into Haifa from the Upper Galilee where purchases of agricultural land by the Jewish National Fund and Hebrew labor policies excluding Arabs had dispossessed many of their traditional livelihoods . Al @-@ Qassam grew increasingly popular with northern Palestine 's poorer Muslims and was frequently sought out to preach at <unk> celebrations . 
 In 1929 he was appointed the marriage registrar at the sharia court in Haifa by the Waqf authorities in Jerusalem , a role that allowed him to tour the northern villages , whose inhabitants he encouraged to set up agricultural cooperatives . According to the American historian Edmund Burke , al @-@ Qassam was : 
 An individual deeply imbued with the Islamic social gospel and who was struck by the plight of Palestinian peasants and migrants . Al @-@ Qassam 's pastoral concern was linked to his moral outrage as a Muslim at the ways in which the old implicit social compact was being violated in the circumstances of British mandatory Palestine . This anger fueled a political radicalism that drove him eventually to take up arms and marks him off from the Palestinian notable politicians . 
 He also took advantage of his travels to deliver fiery political and religious sermons in which he encouraged villagers to organize resistance units to attack the British and Jews . He intensified his agitation and obtained a fatwa from Shaykh Badr al @-@ Din al @-@ Taji al @-@ Hasani , the Mufti of Damascus , which ruled that the struggle against the British and the Jews was permissible . 
 = = = Relationship with local leaders = = = 
 According to Israeli historian Shai Lachman , between 1921 and 1935 al @-@ Qassam often cooperated with Hajj Amin al @-@ Husseini , the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem . They were initially on good terms , and al @-@ Qassam 's various official appointments required the mufti 's prior consent . He suggests their cooperation increased after the 1929 riots , in which one source claims al @-@ Qassam 's men were active . The two fell out in the mid @-@ 1930s , perhaps due to al @-@ Qassam 's independent line of activism . In 1933 , al @-@ Qassam sent an emissary to al @-@ Husseini , requesting the latter 's participation in a revolt against the British . At the time , al @-@ Husseini refused , preferring a political solution . 
 Between 1928 until his death , al @-@ Qassam served as the president of the Young Men 's Muslim Association ( YMMA ) in Haifa . While he focused his activism with the lower classes , his position in the YMMA afforded him access with the middle and educated classes of the city who were attracted to Hizb al @-@ Istiqlal ( Independence Party ) , an Arab nationalist political party . In particular , he developed a strong relationship with leading local party member Rashid al @-@ Hajj Ibrahim , the previous president of the Haifa YMMA . A wide ideological gap between the secularist al @-@ Istiqlal and al @-@ Qassam was bridged by a convergence in the view that the struggle against Zionist expansion in Palestine was inseparable from active opposition to British rule . This view separated al @-@ Qassam and al @-@ Istiqlal from the mainstream political forces in Palestine at the time . While men from al @-@ Istiqlal and the YMMA generally refrained from joining al @-@ Qassam 's cause , his association with them helped protect him from political figures who opposed his activism . His activities were also financed by several well @-@ off businessmen associated with al @-@ Istiqlal due to his spreading reputation . 
 = = = Organization of armed struggle = = = 
 In 1930 or 1931 , al @-@ Qassam had recruited numerous hand @-@ picked followers and organized them into about a dozen different circles , each group of supporters unaware of the existence of the other groups . The majority of his men were peasants and urban laborers . The majority of al @-@ Qassam 's circles were based in northern Palestine , but he had disciples throughout the country , including in Gaza in the south . In contrast to traditional Palestinian leaders who campaigned against Zionist settlement while avoiding confrontation with the British authorities , al @-@ Qassam saw it as a priority to fight against both . He also saw the brewing conflict in Palestine as a religious struggle , unlike most Palestinian leaders who advocated a secular and nationalist response . Al @-@ Qassam advocated a moral , political and military jihad as the solution to end British rule and Zionist aspirations in Palestine . 
 In training his men , al @-@ Qassam stressed that maintaining good character was of paramount importance . As such , fighters should provide for the needy , aid people with illness , maintain good ties with their families and pray regularly to God . These virtues , he claimed , were perquisites to being disciplined and fearless fighters . The moral component of al @-@ Qassam 's teachings were especially geared towards the young men of Haifa 's labor slums who lived away from their families and who were exposed to activities considered immoral in Islam . He viewed marriage as key to preventing the moral corruption of young men and managed to financially aid his more destitute supporters with their wedding expenses . He encouraged his men to grow beards as a sign of their commitment to jihad and to carry a Qur 'an with them wherever they went . Although many of his followers had been illiterate , he taught them how to read and write using the Qur 'an as their basis for learning . Al @-@ Qassam also asked his fighters to engage in the spiritual exercises practiced by the <unk> Sufi order and to recite Sufi chants before battle . 
 The guerrilla bands became known as the Black Hand ( al @-@ kaff al @-@ <unk> ) , an anti @-@ Zionist and anti @-@ British militant organization . The idea for such a group appeared to have crystallized after the 1929 riots . From the outset , a split occurred in the movement . One faction led by Abu Ibrahim al @-@ Kabir argued for immediate attacks against British and Jewish targets , while the other faction , headed by al @-@ Qassam , thought than an armed revolt was premature and risked exposing the group 's preparations . According to Subhi Yasin , a comrade of al @-@ Qassam , the group 's attacks in the north were executed by Abu Ibrahim 's group in defiance of al @-@ Qassam , though in 1969 , Abu Ibrahim denied this allegation . The Black Hand 's ensuing campaign began with the ambush and killing of three members of Kibbutz <unk> on 11 April 1931 , a failed bomb attack on outlying Jewish homes in Haifa in early 1932 , and several operations that killed or wounded four members of northern Jewish settlements . The campaign climaxed with the deaths of a Jewish father and son in <unk> , from a bomb thrown into their home , on 22 December 1932 . 
 By 1935 , al @-@ Qassam had recruited several hundred men — the figures range from 200 to 800 — organized in cells of five men , and arranged military training for peasants . The cells were equipped with bombs and firearms , which they used to raid Jewish settlements and sabotage British @-@ constructed rail lines . Though striking a responsive chord among the rural poor and urban underclass , al @-@ Qassam 's movement deeply perturbed the Muslim urban elite as it threatened their political and patronage connections with the British Mandatory authorities . Following the October 1935 discovery of a clandestine cache of arms in the port of Jaffa apparently originating from Belgium and destined for the Haganah , a Jewish paramilitary force , Palestinian Arab indignation broke out in two general strikes . The arms shipment to the Haganah , known as the " Cement Incident " , served as the final impetus for al @-@ Qassam to launch a revolt against the authorities . 
 = = Death = = 
 On 8 November the body of a British constable , Moshe Rosenfeld , was discovered near Ein <unk> . Al @-@ Qassam and his followers were believed to have been responsible and search parties set out to capture him . In this context , al @-@ Qassam and twelve of his men decided to go underground and , leaving Haifa , took to the hills between Jenin and Nablus . There they spent ten days on the move , during which they were fed by the residents of villages in the area . The British police manhunt eventually surrounded al @-@ Qassam in a cave near Ya <unk> , in the village of Sheikh Zeid . In the long ensuing firefight , al @-@ Qassam and three of his followers were killed , and five captured on 20 November . 
 The manner of his last stand galvanized Palestinians at the time , according to American historian Abdallah Schleifer : 
 Surrounded , he told his men to die as martyrs , and opened fire . His defiance and manner of his death ( which stunned the traditional leadership ) electrified the Palestinian people . Thousands forced their way past police lines at the funeral in Haifa , and the secular Arab nationalist parties invoked his memory as the symbol of resistance . It was the largest political gathering ever to assemble in mandatory Palestine . 
 To the surprise of the Palestine Police Force , al @-@ Qassam 's funeral , which was held at the <unk> Mosque , attracted at least 3 @,@ 000 mourners , mostly members of the peasant and working classes . His coffin and those of his slain comrades were draped in the flags of Yemen , Saudi Arabia , and Iraq , the only three independent Arab countries at the time . In reaction to al @-@ Qassam 's death , strikes were held in Haifa and several Palestinian and Syrian cities . Al @-@ Qassam is buried at the Muslim cemetery at the former Palestinian village of Balad al @-@ Sheikh , now Nesher , a Jewish suburb of Haifa . An obituary for al @-@ Qassam was published in the Egyptian newspaper Al @-@ Ahram on 22 November , eulogizing him as a " martyr " with the following statement : " I heard you preaching from up in the pulpit , summoning to the sword ... Through your death you are more eloquent than ever you were in life . " 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Five months following al @-@ Qassam 's death , members of his movement , known as " Qassamiyun " or " <unk> " , under the leadership of Farhan al @-@ Sa 'di , al @-@ Qassam 's spiritual heir , shot and killed two Jewish passengers on a bus . This act became a major contributing factor to the start of the 1936 – 39 Arab revolt in Palestine . Peasant and urban guerrilla factions ( fasa 'il ) led by the Qassamiyun played a significant role in commencing the countrywide revolt . At the start of the revolt , al @-@ Qassam 's close disciples al @-@ Sa 'di , Abu Ibrahim al @-@ Kabir , and <unk> Ahmad Awad led fasa 'il in the Jenin region , the Upper Galilee and Balad al @-@ Sheikh , respectively . 
 Al @-@ Qassam , according to Palestinian @-@ American Rashid Khalidi , 
 played a crucial role in winning the populace away from the elite @-@ brokered politics of compromise with the British , and in showing them the " correct " path of popular armed struggle against the British and the Zionists . 
 The first Israeli prime minister , David Ben @-@ Gurion , compared the glory that al @-@ Qassam 's actions aroused in the 1930s to the fame won in Zionist discourse by Zionist activist Joseph <unk> who died in a battle with Arab forces . Recalling this , Israeli historian Tom Segev has argued that " The terrorists that al @-@ Qassam led and the intifada fighters , more recently , may also be likened to the terrorists that Menachem Begin led . " 
 Although al @-@ Qassam 's revolt was unsuccessful in his lifetime , militant organizations gained inspiration from his example . His funeral drew thousands , which turned into a mass demonstration of national unity . The Palestinian fedayeen who emerged in the 1960s saw al @-@ Qassam as their originator . The founders of the Palestinian nationalist armed movement Fatah had initially considered naming their group the " Qassamiyun " . Leila Khaled , a well @-@ known member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine , once stated that her organization began " where al @-@ Qassam left off : his generation started the revolution , my generation intends to finish it . " 
 The military wing of the Palestinian Islamist armed movement Hamas , the Izz ad @-@ Din al @-@ Qassam Brigades , bears his name as does the Qassam rocket , a short @-@ range rocket the group produces and uses . 
 = 3rd Sustainment Brigade ( United States ) = 
 The 3rd Sustainment Brigade is a sustainment brigade of the United States Army headquartered at Fort Stewart , Georgia . The 3rd Sustainment Brigade is responsible for providing logistical support to the 3rd Infantry Division , however the modular nature of the brigade means that it takes on other roles while deployed . Personnel serving under this brigade wear the Shoulder Sleeve Insignia exclusive to this brigade , rather than the insignia designated for the 3rd Infantry Division . 
 Though its lineage dates back to 1957 , the unit was not designated as a separate unit until 2005 . The 3rd Sustainment Brigade has served three tours in Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom , its first tour being the initial invasion and securing of the country , followed by a second tour of duty as logistics support for units around Baghdad , and finally as the multinational division supply lines in the northern division of the country . 
 The Brigade left for a planned nine @-@ month deployment to Afghanistan in late November 2012 .

 The 3rd Sustainment Brigade has a permanent organization of two attached battalions , however this number can be changed when the unit is deployed in a theater of operations . These permanent attachments include the 87th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion , and a Special Troops Battalion . The units are headquartered at Fort Stewart . Georgia , along with the brigade 's Headquarters and Headquarters Company . Under non @-@ deployment circumstances , the HHC of the Brigade would , in turn , be directly subordinate to the 3rd Infantry Division . 
 = = History = = 
 The unit was constituted 1 July 1957 in the regular army as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment , 3rd Infantry Division Trains , and activated at Fort Benning , Georgia . On 20 March 1963 , the unit was consolidated with the 3rd Infantry Division Band , which has previously been organized in 1943 as the band , 3rd Infantry Division . On 15 March 1968 , the unit was re @-@ organized and re @-@ designed as Headquarters and Headquarters Company and Band , 3rd Infantry Division Support Command . On 21 May 1972 , the unit was re @-@ organized and re @-@ designed as Headquarters and Headquarters Company , 3rd Infantry Division Support Command . It was deployed to as part of the Cold War buildup , should hostilities arise in the region with the Soviet Union . Though the unit was placed on alert constantly , it never saw action during its time in the region , which lasted from its activation until 1991 . 
 In the fall of 2002 , the Division Support Command deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom I , earning the Presidential Unit Citation along with the rest of the 3rd Infantry Division . The Brigade and its division had spearheaded the invasion into the nation of Iraq , supporting the four brigades as they pushed through southern Iraq and into the capital of Baghdad . After the initial invasion and capture of Baghdad , the brigade remained in the city , supporting the 3rd Infantry Division as the unit conducted counterinsurgency and infrastructure activities in the area . It returned home to Fort Stewart in August 2003 . 
 The Division Support Command was renamed the Division Support Brigade and deployed to Iraq in the fall of 2004 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom III , leading coalition troops in control of the Baghdad area . Under Multinational Division , Baghdad . It returned home again in January 2006 . The Division Support Brigade was reorganized as the 3rd Support Brigade on 15 June 2005 , and re @-@ designated as the 3rd Sustainment Brigade on 21 April 2006 . 
 In 2007 , the Brigade saw its third deployment to Iraq during the Iraq War , relieving the 45th Sustainment Brigade of its areas of responsibility of Multinational Division , North , comprising over a dozen Forward Operating Bases . The Brigade deployed to Iraq in fall of 2007 following the Brigade Combat Teams and aviation brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division , however , for this deployment , the unit did not support the Division directly , as its mission in Multinational Division , North covered facilities management , not unit logistics . Brigade projects focused on building infrastructure throughout northern Iraq . The brigade served a total of 15 months in the country , headquartered at Contingency Operating Base Q @-@ West in Northern Iraq under the command of the 316th Expeditionary Support Command . It was relieved during a change of command ceremony on 9 August 2008 , at which time it returned to Fort Stewart . It was replaced by the 16th Sustainment Brigade . Since its return , the brigade participated in an intramural soccer tournament at Fort Benning , something many of its members enjoyed doing , even while deployed . 
 In late November 2012 the Brigade deployed to Afghanistan for its first tour in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan .

 = Convict cichlid = 
 The convict cichlid ( Amatitlania nigrofasciata ) is a fish species from the family <unk> , native to Central America , also known as the zebra cichlid . Convict cichlids are popular aquarium fish and have also been the subject of numerous studies on fish behaviour . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Albert Günther originally described the species in 1867 after Frederick <unk> Godman and Osbert Salvin collected specimens in Central America . In 2007 , the species was moved from the genus <unk> to a new genus , Amatitlania , based on Juan <unk> @-@ Soto 's study of <unk> species . However , a 2008 study led by Oldrich Rican proposed moving the species in <unk> and Amatitlania , including Amatitlania nigrofasciata into the genus <unk> . 
 The convict cichlid displays significant color across its range . Some of these regional variants are now considered different species . In the cichlid @-@ keeping hobby , Rusty Wessel collected one such fish , the Honduran Red Point <unk> ( Amatitlania sp . ) from a stream in Honduras . The Honduran Red Point Convict ranges from Atlantic Honduras south to Costa Rica . Other new species formerly included in A. nigrofasciata are Amatitlania <unk> , from Lake Coatepeque in El Salvador , and Amatitlania <unk> , from Panama 's Atlantic coast . 
 The type species , A. nigrofasciata , which used to cover all these species , is restricted to the northern population ranging from El Salvador to Guatemala on the Pacific coast and from Honduras to Guatemala on the Atlantic coast . 
 A number of synonyms exist for this species including : <unk> nigrofasciatus , <unk> <unk> , <unk> nigrofasciatus and <unk> nigrofasciatus . 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 The common name convict cichlid is , like the species name , derived from the vertical black stripes on the body which are reminiscent of the striped prison uniforms of British convicts . Similarly , the species epithet nigrofasciatus literally means " black @-@ striped " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The wild @-@ type of the species has 8 or 9 black vertical bars on a blue @-@ grey body , along with a dark blotch on the operculum . Juvenile convict cichlids are monomorphic until they reach sexual maturity . The male is mostly gray with light black stripes along the body . Males are larger than females , and they have more pointed ventral , dorsal and anal fins which often extend into filaments . In addition , older males frequently develop vestigial fatty lumps on their foreheads . Unusually for fish , the female is more highly coloured . She has more intense black bands across the body , and pink to orange colouration in the ventral region and on the dorsal fin . Mature males in the wild have a standard length of 6 @.@ 3 to 6 @.@ 6 centimeters , and breeding females are 4 @.@ 2 to 5 @.@ 5 centimeters long . The maximum standard length has been reported to be 10 centimeters , with total length near 12 centimeters ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) . The body weight of the fish is about 34 – 36 grams ( 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 3 oz ) . Selective breeding has resulted in a leucistic strain , which lacks the dark barring of the wild type . These are known commonly as white convicts , pink convicts , gold convicts , and A. nigrofasciata " Kongo " . The leucistic colouration is caused by a mutation in an autosomal gene and is recessively inherited . 
 = = Range and habitat = = 
 Convict cichlids are native to the lakes and streams of Central America . In particular , the species occurs along the eastern coast of Central America from Guatemala to Costa Rica , and on the western coast from Honduras to Panama . Convict cichlids prefer moving water , and are most frequently found in habitats with cover in the form of rocks or sunken branches . At four natural habitats of the convict cichlid in Costa Rica , the pH was found to range from 6 @.@ 6 – 7 @.@ 8 , while GH ranged from 63 to 77 ppm <unk> 
 3 . The daily water temperature ranged from 26 – 29 ° C ( 79 – 84 ° F ) . Convict cichlids can be relatively tolerant of cool water , allowing them to colonise volcanic lakes at elevations of 1 @,@ 500 meters ( 4 @,@ 900 ft ) .

 The species also occurs outside its natural range in Australia , where it can be found in the warm effluent of power stations in Victoria , and in tropical Queensland . It has also been captured in Perth , Western Australia , although this initial capture also resulted in its eradication . In addition to Australia , the species has been introduced to Réunion , Japan , Mexico , Colombia , Taiwan , and the USA . 
 = = Feeding = = 
 In natural habitats , the species has a diet composed of various prey , including crustaceans , small fish , insects , worms , plants and algae . The fish can protrude its jaw 4 @.@ 2 % of its standard length , allowing it to have a varied diet . Inferior social status and associated stress can affect digestive function in convict cichlids . 
 = = Reproduction = = 
 = = = Life cycle = = = 
 The convict cichlid can reach sexual maturity as young as 16 weeks , though sexual maturity more commonly occurs at 6 months . Sexually mature convicts form monogamous pairs and spawn in small caves or crevices . In the wild , the fish excavate caves by moving earth from underneath large stones . Females adhere eggs to the walls of the cave . 
 Like most cichlids , such as Oreochromis mossambicus , convicts brood ( exhibit parental care of ) both eggs and free @-@ swimming fry . The eggs hatch approximately 72 hours after fertilization . Until that time the parents expel intruders and potential egg predators from around the nest . They also fan the eggs , moving water with their fins over the clutch to provide oxygenation . They fan the eggs both day and night ; at night they use their sense of smell to recognize the presence of the eggs in the dark , and they keep their pelvic fins in contact with the eggs to remain at the right distance for fanning . In darkness the pair recognizes each other and detect predators using their sense of smell . 
 After hatching , the larvae spend another 72 hours absorb their yolk sacs and developing their fins before they become free @-@ swimming fry . The fry forage during daylight in a dense school and return to the cave or crevice for the night . Like other cichlids , the parents retrieve their young just before dark , sucking up three or four at a time and delivering them into the nest . The parents anticipate night , using a sense of time ; in laboratory experiments convict cichlids continued to retrieve young as night approached even in the absence of any signal , such as dimming light . During the night , the fry bunch up at the bottom of the cave or nest , where the parents fan them . 
 Both parents remain involved in guarding the fry from brood predators and engage in behaviors to assist feeding such as moving leaves or fin digging ( digging up the substrate with their fins ) . Brood care of eggs , larvae and free @-@ swimming juveniles in the wild can last 4 to 6 weeks , and occurs only once per season for the majority of females . In contrast , females in aquaria are known to breed many times per year with short intervals of 12 or 13 days between broods , as long as suitable rocks or similar surfaces are available for them to lay their eggs on . 
 = = = Mating system = = = 
 Convict cichlids are serially monogamous , so pair bonds may form first before they establish a territory together , or the male and female may each obtain a territory before pairing with each other . Because the convict cichlids are also substrate @-@ brooding , this territory will include a breeding site for the deposition of eggs . 
 = = = Sexual selection = = = 
 The effect of population density on sexual selection for convict cichlids has been studied . When nest density was greater , the females tended to be larger , which is more accurately explained by density @-@ dependent mate preference and mating competition , as opposed to predation and resource competition . Moreover , as the two nest density regimes were compared , with one high and one low , there was no significant difference in brood survival between the two ; however , the convict cichlids did prefer to breed farther away from each other , not in close proximity . This indicates that there are some other costs with breeding in an environment with high population density , an example being energy loss because of the resulting increased aggression when guarding territory . 
 The female 's preference for the male mate has also been examined , in accordance to the male 's size and fighting ability . The female cichlid always chooses the larger of the two males if the smaller male is next to the larger male , and if the larger male defeats the smaller male in a fight . If the males are not viewed together at the same time for a comparison to be drawn by the female , the female has no particular preference . Females do benefit by mating with a larger male , as it has been shown that larger males can raise more offspring to independence , are better at chasing predators that might attack offspring , and are better at competing for breeding sites . Male size may act as a more effective indicator of aggression , which may thus repel intruders before they can come closer to the offspring . It has been shown that individuals of significantly greater size relative to their opponent often win fights without much physical <unk> convict cichlid are one of easiest cichlid to breed and keep 
 = = = Parental roles = = = 
 Convict cichlids are a biparental species , so the parents will usually cooperate by carrying out tasks specific to their individual parental roles when raising their offspring . This is common in cichlid fish , and studies have shown coordination between the female and male . The female tends to remain with the brood and perform activities involving the brood , whether it be fanning the eggs or mouth @-@ brooding the larvae , whereas the male tends to patrol the area to chase intruders and defend from predators . Both parents are able to carry out all of the parental care tasks to a certain extent . However , because they are <unk> custodial , each sex will still focus on a specific set of behaviors in particular , which is susceptible to change during the brood cycle . In fact , it is observed that when one of the mates is removed , either parent is still able to raise the offspring independently by having the capacity for all the parental behaviors . As the young offspring grow and become free @-@ swimming fry , the parental activities are distributed more equally between the parents , which appears to be typical behavior in other types of cichlids as well . 
 The different ways in which this biparental sex role specialization can be influenced was studied by manipulating the presence and absence of the mate as well as the presence and absence of an intruder . The former variable was considered because the specialization of parental roles only occurs when both parents are present , while the latter variable was considered because it is thought that biparental care in these cichlids was an evolutionary consequence of the protection of offspring from intruders . When both mates are present with no intruder , both parents may stay with the offspring by resembling single parents because each parent is addressing only the offspring and not its mate , or one parent may be concentrated on activities associated with the offspring while the other parent concentrates on patrolling and defending the area . Under these isolated conditions , a more equal sharing of parental behaviors tends to occur . However , when both mates are present and an intruder is introduced , the male spends more time chasing intruders while the female remains with the offspring more . When the intruder is present but a parent is by itself , the widowed male tends to leave the offspring unattended and instead attacks the intruder or predator . Therefore , the conclusive finding is that the male rarely remains with the offspring when the female is absent , and the female rarely confronts the intruder when the male is absent . 
 = = = Brood adoption = = = 
 Convict cichlids may show extended biparental care and adopt unrelated young of the same species of similar or smaller body size compared to their own biological offspring . The parents may benefit by adopting smaller young by taking advantage of the dilution effect , which is when the risk of predation for an individual is reduced because the group size is larger . Another reason that has been considered is that foreign young that are larger than the biological offspring may be a direct predatory threat to them . However , it has been shown that as the biological offspring develop and become stronger swimmers , the parents are less active about rejecting larger foreign young , but when they do reject , often foreign young are rejected before they are large enough to be perceived as a direct threat to the biological offspring . Thus , it can be concluded that the brood adoption and rejection rely more heavily on the protection of the biological offspring from differential predator instead of from larger adopted cichlids . 
 = = Aggressive behavior = = 
 Convict cichlids are known to be highly aggressive and territorial when breeding , possessing a variety of complex behaviors and adaptations , which have been suggested to be a result of environmental conditions , individual development , and trait variation . Due to their aggressive nature , cichlids are popularly studied to investigate the factors that may potentially cause their behavior . Convict cichlids usually demonstrate their aggressive behavior by biting and chasing , which entails bursts of high speed targeted at the intruder , and also show their aggression via their body size . 
 It has been shown that environmental parameters like changes in temperature and prior residence may affect the cichlid 's territorial aggression . The convict cichlids are more aggressive at 30 ° C as opposed to 26 ° C , which may be explained by the fact that convict cichlids tend to set up their breeding sites and spawn at 30 ° C. 
 = = Aquarium care = = 
 The aquarium should be decorated to mimic the natural environment and include rocks and artificial caves for breeding . Most experts agree that a pair of convicts should be kept in a 20 @-@ gallon aquarium or larger . The species is an unfussy omnivore and most types of prepared fish foods are readily accepted . The species also consumes aquatic plants so plastic plants or robust plants such as java fern are recommended . Convict cichlids are aggressively territorial during breeding and pairs are best kept alone . Brood care is reduced in aquarium strains . Due to the species ' tendency to dig , external filtration is superior to <unk> filter systems . Its relatively small size , along with ease of keeping and breeding , make the convict an ideal cichlid for beginners and advanced aquarists alike interested in observing pair bonds and brood care . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Breeding convicts is as simple as having a male and a female in the same tank with adequate water quality and feeding . There is no special conditioning required . Due to their prolific breeding in captivity , there is a very low demand for Convict fry , and one may easily find their aquarium overstocked with an inbreeding population of Convicts without any avenues for adoption . 
 = = = Tank mates = = = 
 Ideal tank mates for convict cichlids consists of robust similar sized fish . Such fish include T @-@ Bar cichlids , Honduran red points , Green Terrors , Jewel cichlids , Salvini , Jack Dempsey , ( Keep in mind as <unk> outgrow the convicts territorial issues will become a problem . ) <unk> catfish , <unk> , as well as other convicts . Other fast moving fish such as Giant <unk> can be used as dither fish . Also remember , if you have a breeding pair Convicts in a 40 @-@ gallon or smaller you will be most likely be unable to keep the convicts with any tank mates . But if your tank mates have established any type of dominance they will however breed and live together ..... 
 = Creation of express trusts in English law = 
 The creation of express trusts in English law must involve four elements for the trust to be valid : capacity , certainty , constitution and formality . Capacity refers to the settlor 's ability to create a trust in the first place ; generally speaking , anyone capable of holding property can create a trust . There are exceptions for statutory bodies and corporations , and minors who usually cannot hold property can , in some circumstances , create trusts . Certainty refers to the three certainties required for a trust to be valid . The trust instrument must show certainty of intention to create a trust , certainty of what the subject matter of the trust is , and certainty of who the beneficiaries ( or objects ) are . Where there is uncertainty for whatever reason , the trust will fail , although the courts have developed ways around this . Constitution means that for the trust to be valid , the property must have been transferred from the settlor to the trustees .
