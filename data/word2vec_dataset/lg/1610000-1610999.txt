 On September 27 , PAGASA issued Storm Signal Number 3 , a warning for winds of 100 – 185 km / h ( 62 – 115 mph ) , for areas of southern Luzon . Storm Signal Number 2 , for winds of 60 – 100 km / h ( 37 – 62 mph ) , was raised for northern Samar Island and central Luzon . Storm Signal Number 1 ( 30 – 60 km / h , 20 – 37 mph ) was issued for northwestern Luzon , including Metro Manila , and northern Visayas , including the rest of Samar Island . Schools in the warned area were suspended , and airports and seaports were closed . Philippine Airlines cancelled over half of its flights to and from Ninoy Aquino International Airport for September 28 , and various transit services also suspended service . Metro Manila and the Tagalog provinces were warned of possible flooding and strong winds . 
 When it became clear that Xangsane would approach the Capital , PAGASA upgraded the warning for Manila and central Luzon to Storm Signal Number 3 on September 28 . All the storm signals were discontinued later that day .

 Prior to Xangsane 's final landfall , the Vietnamese government set up a steering committee headed by Deputy Prime Minister Nguyễn Sinh Hùng to oversee evacuations and storm preparations throughout central Vietnam . Provincial and local authorities evacuated over 300 @,@ 000 people from low @-@ lying areas along the coast from Hà Tĩnh to Phú Yên , as well as hilly areas prone to landslides . The Vietnamese government also ordered about 2 @,@ 400 boats , including 273 fishing boats , to return to port . Vietnam Airlines , the national airline , cancelled or diverted all flights on September 30 and October 1 . These efforts were carried out in order to prevent a repeat of the damage and fatalities caused by Typhoon Chanchu earlier in the season .

 Although Xangsane had weakened considerably over land , residents of northern Thailand were advised of the threat of flooding from the remnant low of Xangsane as it approached . The Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation alerted its provincial offices throughout the country to be prepared for strong winds , flash flooding , and landslides . Residents in highland areas were also warned of possible mudslides , and the army was dispatched to aid in regional storm preparations .

 Damage was widespread in the Philippines , particularly in Metro Manila , where the typhoon passed almost directly over . Power and water was lost in several provinces , while overflowing rivers caused flooding , landslides and made roads impassable . In some parts of the country , electricity was cut off for up to six days straight . Many trees and billboards were toppled by Xangsane , while Luzon suffered an island @-@ wide power outage . Rough waters and seaport closures left at least 3 @,@ 400 people and nearly 270 vehicles stranded in ports and terminals , mainly at the primary ferry crossing between Samar Island and Bicol Region . Local and provincial officials described Xangsane as the worst typhoon to directly impact Manila since Typhoon Angela passed over the city eleven years ago . 
 The Philippine government estimated that approximately 2 million people in 19 provinces were affected by Xangsane , which destroyed many homes and farms on its path through the islands . The local and regional Philippine National Red Cross chapters reported major damage in at least 116 municipalities , 12 cities , and a total of 1 @,@ 295 barangays across the country . Torrential rains from Milenyo also caused flooding and landslides in Laguna , Cavite , and Quezon . Xangsane caused the destruction of the <unk> Dam in the Municipality of <unk> , which channeled water to irrigation canals around the area . In all , Milenyo was responsible for 197 deaths and 5 @.@ 9 billion Philippine pesos ( $ 118 million , 2006 USD ) in damage , mostly to personal property and agriculture .

 Xangsane made its second and final landfall in central Vietnam , causing severe flooding and strong winds that caused nearly 10 trillion Vietnamese dong ( $ 629 million , 2006 USD ) in damage and killed 71 people . The worst structural damage occurred in the city of Da Nang , where 26 people were killed . The provinces of Quảng Nam and Nghệ An were also hard hit , with a total of 25 people killed . The storm damaged or destroyed around 320 @,@ 000 homes , downed thousands of trees and power lines , and flooded major streets . 
 Significant agricultural damage was reported , especially in Quảng Bình Province . More than 3 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 1 @,@ 200 sq mi ) of crops , mostly rice , were damaged or washed away by the floodwaters . There were also reports of heavy losses of poultry and livestock , and nearly 13 km ² ( 5 sq mi ) of aquaculture and 786 fishing boats were lost . 
 = = = Thailand = = = 
 The remnants of Xangsane moved over Thailand on October 2 and combined with monsoonal moisture over the north central part of the country , causing torrential rains and severe flooding in over 35 provinces . Floodwaters broke through levees and barriers and flooded or damaged nearly 1 @.@ 3 million <unk> ( 2 @,@ 100 km ² , 520 @,@ 000 acres ) of farmland and local infrastructure . Many municipalities reported flooding of up to three meters ( 10 ft ) , and the municipality of <unk> reported flooding of 60 cm ( 2 ft ) . The Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation reported 47 deaths , and villages in several provinces reported significant levels of water pollution and waterborne illnesses from stagnant waters .

 Following the passage of Xangsane , the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies ( IFRC ) issued an emergency request for 5 @.@ 7 million Swiss francs ( $ 4 @.@ 6 million , 2006 USD ) to aid the Philippine Red Cross in its relief effort . In addition , the movement dispatched 3 @,@ 000 workers and three disaster response teams to affected areas for search and rescue missions , damage assessments , and assistance to people affected by the typhoon . The Philippine Red Cross provided canned goods , rice , clothing , and personal hygiene items to over 6 @,@ 300 families , and local volunteers provided assistance to people in shelters . The Spanish Red Cross , present since 1998 as a backup to the Philippine Red Cross , also sent officials , logistics equipment , and water purification systems to the more heavily areas to aid in disaster relief and damage assessments . 
 In Manila , fallen billboards killed several people and caused traffic delays along EDSA , the main highway of the metropolis . This prompted some members of the Senate of the Philippines to push for the removal and banning of billboard advertising in the Manila area , which had been an issue for some time . Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago wrote an appeal to President Gloria Macapagal @-@ Arroyo , asking her to approve the " Anti @-@ Billboard Blight Act of 2006 " , which would ban billboard advertising on major thoroughfares within Metro Manila .

 On October 3 , the IFRC released 100 @,@ 000 Swiss francs ( $ 80 @,@ 300 , 2006 USD ) from its disaster relief fund to support the Red Cross of Vietnam , and issued an emergency appeal for 1 million Swiss francs ( $ 810 @,@ 000 , 2006 USD ) in aid the next day . The Vietnamese government also released 100 billion Vietnamese dong ( $ 6 @.@ 2 million , 2006 USD ) and 1 @,@ 500 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 650 short tons ) of rice from the national food security stock to help the recovery effort in central Vietnam . The National Fatherland Front also issued an appeal to national and international organizations for donations and aid . 
 On October 13 , a minivan carrying a relief team from a local government in Ho Chi Minh city was caught in an accident , killing 12 aid workers . [ 1 ]

 As a result of the deaths and damage caused , it was decided at the 39th annual meeting of the ESCAP / WMO Typhoon Committee in Manila in December 2006 that the name Xangsane , along with four others , would be retired from the name list . Its PAGASA name , Milenyo , was also retired by PAGASA . In December 2007 , the committee selected the name <unk> to replace Xangsane on the Western Pacific basin name lists beginning in 2008 . In 2010 the name selected by PAGASA to replace Milenyo was Mario , but the name itself was retired and was replaced with <unk> after devastating Metro Manila and Northern Luzon .

 The 136th Boat Race took place on 31 March 1990 . Held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . Oxford won by two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ quarter lengths . The race featured the heaviest oarsman ever to have rowed in the event in Oxford 's Chris Heathcote , and the lightest Cambridge crew for nearly 30 years . 
 In the reserve race , Cambridge 's Goldie won as Oxford 's Isis was disqualified . Cambridge won the Women 's Boat Race .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . First held in 1829 , the race takes place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1989 race by two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths , with Cambridge leading overall with 69 victories to Oxford 's 65 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the Tideway , prior to the main Boat Race . 
 The race was umpired by former Cambridge Blue Mike Sweeney , his fourth appearance in the role . He had advised the coxes that he would not be afraid to disqualify either crew should he need to : " If I warn them , it 's irrelevant what their opinion is . If they respond , fine . If not , they 're in trouble . " The race was sponsored by Beefeater Gin who , prior to the race , had signed a three @-@ year contract to continue their involvement in the race , worth £ 250 @,@ 000 . The BBC also extended their deal with a new five @-@ year contract to broadcast the race in the United Kingdom .

 The Oxford crew weighed an average of 14 st 12 lb ( 94 @.@ 1 kg ) per rower , 2 stone 1 @.@ 5 lb ( 13 @.@ 3 kg ) more than Cambridge whose crew was the lightest since 1963 . The race featured the heaviest oarsman ever to have rowed in the event , with Oxford 's Chris Heathcote weighing 17 st 5 lb ( 114 @.@ 5 kg ) . Oxford 's crew were also older and more experienced , with three world championship bronze medal winners in Jonathan Searle , Matthew Pinsent and Rupert Obholzer . Three of Oxford 's crew had won two Boat Races each , while Cambridge featured two former Blues who had won none . Cambridge 's cox Lisa Ross @-@ <unk> had won with both the women 's lightweight race in 1987 and Goldie in 1988 , her counterpart Martin Watts was educated at Westminster School and " spent hours on the Tideway " .

 Cambridge were underdogs for the race , having lost all but one of the previous fourteen Boat Races . Cambridge president Paddy Mant won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station . A minute into the race , Cambridge held a third @-@ of @-@ a @-@ length advantage , but as the crews approached the Fulham bend , Oxford drew alongside . Intelligent coxing from Oxford 's Watts gained Oxford a lead of a length after three minutes . With clear water at Harrods Furniture Depository , Watts attempted to steer in front of Cambridge but was warned off by umpire Sweeney . Oxford passed below Hammersmith Bridge holding a four @-@ second advantage and made a push , taking the lead out to six seconds by Chiswick Steps . Settling for a lower rating , Oxford were eight seconds clear by Barnes Railway Bridge , and despite a late surge by Cambridge , Oxford passed the finishing post seven seconds and two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ quarter lengths ahead . The crews recorded the fourth- and fifth @-@ fastest times in Boat Race history . 
 In the reserve race , Cambridge 's Goldie won as Oxford 's Isis were disqualified . After Isis had taken a three @-@ quarter @-@ length lead , a clash of blades resulted in irreparable damage to the Cambridge boat and a red flag from umpire John Garrett . Cambridge won the 45th Women 's Boat Race by three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ quarter lengths in a time of 7 minutes and 17 seconds , their third victory in four years .

 The Simpsons creator Matt Groening conceived of the idea for the Simpsons in the lobby of James L. Brooks 's office . Brooks , the producer of the sketch comedy program The Tracey Ullman Show , wanted to use a series of animated shorts as bumpers between sketches . He had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts , which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series . However , when Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life 's work , he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family . 
 The Simpson family first appeared as shorts in The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19 , 1987 . Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production . However , the animators merely re @-@ traced his drawings , which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial short episodes . In 1989 , a team of production companies adapted The Simpsons into a half @-@ hour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company . Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show 's content . Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called " the mainstream trash " that they were watching . The half @-@ hour series premiered on December 17 , 1989 , with " Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire " . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 " Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire " is the first episode of The Simpsons and the Fox network was nervous about the show because they were unsure if it could sustain the audience 's attention for the duration of the episode . They proposed doing three seven @-@ minute shorts per episode and four specials until the audience adjusted , but in the end , the producers gambled by asking Fox for 13 full @-@ length episodes . The series was originally planned to premiere earlier in the fall of 1989 with the episode " Some Enchanted Evening " , but due to major problems with the animation of that episode , the series began on December 17 with this episode . " Some Enchanted Evening " instead aired as the season finale . The episode , being the first to air , lacked the opening sequence which was later added in the second episode , " Bart the Genius " , when Groening realized that a longer opening sequence resulted in less animation . 
 The " Santas of many lands " portion of the Christmas pageant is based on Groening 's experience in the second grade when he did a report on Christmas in Russia . Groening also used that reference in his comic strip " Life in Hell " when he spoofed himself as a young man , being told that it is too bad his grandmother is from Russia , because Christmas is against the law there . Also , Groening claims that this episode has been incorrectly credited with creating the " alternate version " of " Jingle Bells " that has become a well @-@ known children 's playground song . 
 Mimi Pond wrote the episode and staff writer Al Jean came up with the title , which alludes to " The Christmas Song " , also known as " Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire . " David Silverman directed this episode , while Rich Moore storyboarded it and designed Ned Flanders . Several of the scenes were laid out by Eric Stefani , brother of Gwen Stefani . In this episode , Barney had blonde hair which was the same color as his skin , but that was later dropped because of the belief that only the Simpson family should have such hair . Seymour Skinner , Milhouse Van Houten , Sherri and Terri , Moe Szyslak , Mr. Burns , Barney Gumble , Patty and Selma , Ned and Todd Flanders , Santa 's Little Helper , Snowball II , Dewey Largo , and Lewis all make their first appearances in this episode . Snowball I is mentioned for the first time and Waylon Smithers can be heard over the speaker at the power plant , but he is not seen .

It was the second highest rated show on the Fox network up to that point . Since airing , the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics . IGN 's Robert Canning in a 2008 review of the episode noted , " though not the funniest of episodes , it certainly was groundbreaking . [ ... ] With this episode , The Simpsons had its premise down , and it certainly had its edge . " Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , the authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , said of the episode : " pretty standard early fare , with the series not quite hitting its stride . " They went on to say , " the realism of the first season is much apparent , with only the laser used to remove Bart 's tattoo hinting at what the series will become . " In a DVD review of the first season , David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 3 ½ / 5 and commented : " Surprisingly , this early episode has a lot of the zest of the later shows , despite fairly odd looking art and a very Walter Matthau voice for Homer , still has some laughs " . Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that the episode " is good but not great early Simpsons " and further commented : " For many years I thought of “ Roasting ” as a terrible episode , but it ’ s not . While I don ’ t feel it ’ s anything special , it remains a fairly entertaining show that has a few entertaining moments . " 
 The episode was nominated for two Emmy Awards in 1990 : " Outstanding Animated Program " and " Outstanding Editing for a Miniseries or Special . " Because " Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire " was considered a separate special , The Simpsons was nominated twice in the Animated Program category . This episode lost to fellow The Simpsons episode " Life on the Fast Lane " . In 2009 , the website named the episode number 4 on its " Top 10 Holiday Specials " list , writing " With the off @-@ beat sense of humor that we have learned to love from The Simpsons and a story showing the value of family on the Christmas holiday , we can 't help but watch this great special every year .

 = Ctenosaura bakeri = 
 Ctenosaura bakeri , also known as the Utila iguana , Baker 's <unk> iguana , <unk> or <unk> del <unk> , is a critically endangered species of <unk> iguana endemic to the island of Utila , one of the Islas de la Bahía off the coast of Honduras . 
 The Utila iguana is the only species of iguana and one of only two species of lizard to exclusively inhabit brackish mangrove swamps , forced there due to competition from larger species . It is the smallest of the three species of iguana found on Utila , and unique among spiny @-@ tailed iguanas as it is born a dark color as opposed to bright green or yellow . It is arboreal and primarily herbivorous , although it can be an opportunistic carnivore . Males may grow up to 76 centimeters ( 30 in ) in length , while females are smaller , with a length of up to 56 centimeters ( 22 in ) . Eggs are laid in sandy beaches and hatch about 60 – 76 days later , with the hatchlings returning to live in the mangrove forests . 
 Brought to the brink of extinction by the 1990s due to hunting , it was brought back to international attention by German herpetologist Dr. Gunther Köhler and his book Reptiles of Central America . Although several zoos and wildlife associations have instituted programs for the iguanas on Utila , the species still finds itself threatened due to overhunting and may face more of a threat in the form of habitat loss . Extreme conservation efforts are in place to try to prevent this species from going extinct . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Ctenosaura bakeri was first described by Norwegian @-@ born American zoologist Leonhard Hess Stejneger in 1901 , while working for the Smithsonian Institution . The generic name , Ctenosaura , is derived from two Greek words : <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " comb " ( referring to the comblike spines on the lizard 's back and tail ) , and <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " lizard " . Its specific name , bakeri , is the Latinized form of Stejneger 's friend and colleague Frank Baker , who was a former director of the National Zoo in Washington , D.C .. 
 The species is believed to have evolved from mainland @-@ based ancestors , and may share ancestors with C. <unk> and C. <unk> , as it is phylogenetically closer to these two than it is to C. similis . Access to Utila may have involved over @-@ water dispersal during hurricanes , as is known for Iguana iguana in the Lesser Antilles or a land bridge to the mainland lost during the close of the last ice age . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Endemic to Utila , an island off the northern Honduras coast , Ctenosaura bakeri is an inhabitant of 8 square kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 sq mi ) of mangrove forests . Unique among iguanids and rare among reptiles , it is believed that C. bakeri was pushed into the mangrove swamps due to competition from the larger , more aggressive C. similis , which typically inhabits the drier habitats on Utila . It has interbred with this very species and produced viable offspring . From evolutionary and ecological perspectives , inhabiting brackish mangrove forests entails very specific adaptations of diet , behavior , and resource utilization . It is one of only two known species of lizard , the other being a species of anole , Anolis <unk> , that lives solely in mangrove forests . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Utila iguana has a grey @-@ brown to black coloring when young , the only species of spiny @-@ tail iguana with such a dark color when young . Other members of the genus have a green or yellow coloring when young and turn darker with age . As this animal matures it can be a blue or light gray in color , depending on heat conditions or even the animal 's temper . 
 Males achieve a maximum length of 76 centimeters ( 30 in ) , while females are typically 30 % smaller at 56 centimeters ( 22 in ) . Males have a small dewlap and a dorsal crest made up of 56 large dorsal spines , making the animal sexually dimorphic . This dorsal crest consists of white and black spines arranged in alternating groups of two or three of the same color . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Like most iguanids , Ctenosaura bakeri is primarily herbivorous , eating flowers , leaves , stems , and fruit , but they will opportunistically eat smaller animals , eggs , and arthropods that inhabit the mangroves . It has been observed eating smaller green iguanas ( Iguana iguana ) and geckos such as Hemidactylus frenatus . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Adults make their homes within holes in various mangrove trees and maintain an arboreal existence whereas the young are strictly terrestrial for the first year of their lives . As the Utila iguana cannot successfully lay its eggs in the mangrove swamps , the gravid females are forced to migrate to nearby sandy beaches in order to bury their clutches of eggs so they can incubate in the hot sun . After digging their nest burrows and laying their eggs , the females abandon the nests and return to the mangroves . Sixty to seventy @-@ four days later the hatchlings emerge and move back to the swamps . 
 The hatchlings are 15 centimeters ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) long , the body length being a mere 3 centimeters ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) with the tail accounting for 12 centimeters ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) of its total length . The hatchlings ' dark skin color enables them to blend in with the dark floor of the mangrove forests to help elude predators . 
 = = Conservation status = = 
 Gunther Köhler found the species at the brink of extinction , perhaps even functionally extinct in the wild as of 1994 due to overhunting and its restricted habitat . As a result , the Iguana Research and Breeding Station was built in April 1997 with the help and funds of various organizations such as the Frankfurt Zoological Society , the Senckenberg Nature Research Society , AFE @-@ <unk> ( State Forestry Administration @-@ Honduran Forestry Development Corporation ) , <unk> ( Bay Islands Conservation Association ) and the National Autonomous University of Honduras . 
 This species currently has an estimated wild population of 10 @,@ 000 animals in 2 – 3 subpopulations , but is greatly threatened by loss of habitat , as mangrove forests are being used as garbage dump sites and deforested for the construction of homes , resorts , and marinas . Beach habitat is being lost as natural vegetation is removed in preparation for hotel and road construction . According to a survey conducted by the IUCN , exotic invasive plants cover the ground near the mangroves and make the area inappropriate for nesting sites . The iguana is locally hunted for meat , although efforts to educate locals have helped reduce this somewhat in recent years . 
 In 2004 , as a result of Köhler 's expedition and subsequent book , Reptiles of Central America , the Conservation Project of the Utila Iguana ( <unk> ) was founded . The International Iguana Society and the <unk> have sought to purchase land to preserve habitats for the iguanas and plan to establish an outpost manned by Iguana Research and Breeding station personnel , who will aid in monitoring the property and work with developers to select building sites that preserve as much undisturbed beach area as possible . 
 The Iguana Research and Breeding station employs a " head @-@ starting " program for newly hatched iguanas . " Head @-@ starting " , originally used to protect hatching sea turtles , is a process by which iguana eggs are hatched in an incubator and the animals are protected and fed until they are large enough to be protected from predation upon them . In the case of the Utila iguana , 50 % of the animals hatched at the Center are maintained for the head @-@ start program and the rest are released into mangrove forests after hatching . The purpose is to get the animals to a size where they are more capable of fleeing from or fighting off predators . The program has proven successful , as the iguanas behave like their wild @-@ born counterparts . The success of the Utila program serves as a blueprint for other such programs in the Caribbean , particularly with Cyclura species such as the Cuban Iguana and Blue Iguana . They employ volunteers and their best volunteer was Ronan McGrath . 
 = = = Zoological institutions = = = 
 The Utila iguana is maintained in a number of zoos throughout Europe , as well as two in the United States ( Fresno Chaffee Zoo and the Fort Worth Zoo ) , each institution serving as an ex @-@ situ breeding center . In September , 2007 , the London Zoo successfully managed to breed Ctenosaura bakeri for the first time outside of Utila , an important step to ensure their survival if the species is lost from its natural habitat by hurricanes or over @-@ hunting . The population is currently stable , but future declines are expected as a result of the threats mentioned above . 
 According to the International Species Information System , the following zoological parks maintain Ctenosaura bakeri in their exhibits .

In the ride , patrons are introduced to a cartoon theme park called Krustyland built by Krusty the Clown . Sideshow Bob , however , is loose from prison to get revenge on Krusty and the Simpson family . At least 24 regular characters from the series make an appearance , all voiced by their original actors . Along with the attraction is a gift shop modeled after the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart , which opened in late 2007 . 
 On June 1 , 2013 , Universal Studios began selling a real version of Duff Beer at the expanded Duff Beer Garden in the new Springfield section of the park .

 To enter the ride 's queue area , visitors must walk through a 32 @-@ foot ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) Krusty the Clown head which leads them into a pavilion under various circus tents themed to carnival stalls . Various posters in the queue display advertisements for the attractions at the park , while various television monitors display clips from the TV show billed as moments from Krusty 's past , as well as live animated footage from Krustyland . The queue area ends with a sign instructing guests to wait for a short time before entering " Krusty 's Carnival Midway " .

 In the midway , riders line @-@ up into rows to wait for a confirmation from Krusty . TV screens posted inside the walls on the left and right sides of the room display the residents of Springfield running the midway booths at the park . Soon , Krusty appears on another screen in front of guests and prepares to pick the first family to ride his " <unk> : <unk> @-@ <unk> Spins @-@ <unk> Teen @-@ Operated <unk> " , the most extreme ride at the park . While Krusty is not looking , Sideshow Bob appears in a Scratchy costume and steps on Homer Simpson 's foot causing him to yell " D 'oh ! " and Krusty picks the Simpson family . Krusty asks them to pick another group to go with them , and Bart chooses the riders . While Krusty leads them into a waiting room , Sideshow Bob bursts out into evil laughter . 
 = = = Pre @-@ show 2 = = = 
 Riders are then ushered into the pre @-@ flight " Funhouse " room by a team member . Here , Krusty leads the Simpsons into a backstage area where Grampa and Maggie Simpson are told not to ride due to certain safety restrictions ( Maggie didn 't meet the 40 in height requirement , and Grampa had certain heart conditions that could been aggravated ) . Grampa falls asleep while Maggie crawls into a nuclear reactor room , causing her to grow larger . Meanwhile , Krusty leads the Simpsons into a ride room where he tells them to enjoy the ride , before Sideshow Bob appears , knocks Krusty out and tells the Simpsons Family to enter the ride vehicle . Homer enters , followed by the rest of the family . Sideshow Bob then tells the Simpsons and the riders that they must watch a safety <unk> from Itchy and Scratchy . The screen then displays a recap of the safety reminders while riders are ushered into the main ride room . 
 = = = Ride = = = 
 The ride portion is four and a half minutes long . Riders with heart conditions , motion sickness , claustrophobia or similar conditions are not recommended to ride . 
 After riders enter a Krusty themed ride car vehicle , Jeremy Freedman appears on a TV screen in the ride cabin and tells the guests that they are with him . He then says to keep the screaming down so he can study for a math test , because if he does not get a C or higher , he will get kicked out of the audio @-@ visual club . Eventually after a minute or so , Sideshow Bob cuts off his signal and takes control of the screen , the riders get startled , telling them that he has taken over Krustyland and flips a switch from thrilling to killing which activates the vehicles and lifts out of the room , starting the ride with the Simpsons in front of them . The coaster begins going down various drops before Homer gets hit by the wrecking " steel " ball controlled by Sideshow Bob before it smashes into the track , breaking it . Homer and the riders fly into a different part of the roller coaster track before the wrecking ball starts chasing them . Soon , the riders fly off the coaster and into the " Happy Little Elves in Panda Land " attraction with Bart and Lisa , where Bob takes control of an evil panda and sends the vehicles crashing through the attraction . The ride then flies off the attraction and enters " Captain Dinosaur 's Pirate Rip @-@ Off " with Homer and Marge . Sideshow Bob appears in a projection on the waterfall in the attraction and tells Homer to resist temptations inside . ( This is a parody from Pirates of the Caribbean ( attraction ) ) As riders pass through the waterfall , they get sprayed with water effects . Homer grabs a barrel of beer in the ride which soon triggers a trap that causes them to exit out of the attraction and arrive at " Krusty 's Wet and Smoky Stunt Show " where they are taken racing in circles while tied to a killer whale before Bob corners them at the attractions exit . Maggie , still giant @-@ sized , appears and grabs and bangs him into the vehicle , which almost falls into Hell before it is saved by Professor Frink . Bob then steals Maggie 's pacifier and tells her that she must destroy Springfield to get it back . Riders then take a ride through Springfield before encountering Maggie again , who mistakes their car for a new pacifier , and sucks on them repeatedly , before spitting them out ( getting riders wet ) , onto overhead power lines and catapulting them into the Simpsons ' house . While Maggie is sucking on the riders , the aroma of baby powder is released . The family is sitting on their couch when Kang and Kodos turns the house into Krusty 's " Death Drop " ride . The riders are then dropped down from the sky , encountering various Simpsons characters along the way . They land back at the entrance to Krustyland , where Bob prepares to kill them , before the couch the Simpsons are sitting on drops onto him . Maggie then appears and pushes down the Krusty head over the Simpsons . The vehicle is then calmly lowered back down to the ground while mist , fire , electricity and smoke effects spray , and Krusty appears on the TV screen in the loading room . For the Orlando attraction , Krusty is sitting in a control room and pushes an emergency button on the camera , causing the vehicle to vibrate , the riders get startled again , ending the ride . In the Hollywood version , Krusty is sitting in a control room and takes a picture of the guests ( The on @-@ ride photo is taken here for the Hollywood attraction ) . After the gullwing doors on the car lift up , guests exit the ride .

 Planning for The Simpsons Ride started two years prior to its opening . The Simpsons creators James L. Brooks and Matt Groening , as well as executive producer Al Jean , collaborated with the Universal Studios creative team , Universal Creative , to help develop the ride . Music for the ride was composed by Jim Dooley , who worked with composer Hans Zimmer on the feature film The Simpsons Movie . The ride is located at both Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood in the former Back to the Future : The Ride buildings at both locations . The Back to the Future opened in Florida in 1991 and closed March 30 , 2007 , while the Hollywood version opened in 1993 and closed on September 3 , 2007 . 
 The construction began at Universal Studios Florida in May 2007 , and the original concrete on the ground from Back to the Future : The Ride was dismantled and replaced by a red and blue ground holding trees and benches . The building was given a complete overhaul ; the cars were changed and the original Intamin mechanics system was updated by Oceaneering International . The construction began at Universal Studios Hollywood in mid @-@ September 2007 , with the disposal of the building 's Back to the Future insignia . Outdoor painting on the building began in January 2008 .

 The four @-@ minute ride uses 85 @-@ foot IMAX Dome screens and Sony Projectors . There are 24 ride cars , each seating eight people , and approximately 2000 people can ride it per hour . The projection system uses four overlapping Sony <unk> 4K resolution projectors on each dome , using custom @-@ made semi @-@ circular fisheye lenses to project undistorted images at a rate of 60 frames per second ( in comparison , most feature films project at 24 frames per second ) . The video is projected onto two dome screens which are made of 416 panels ( each 4 feet by two feet ) and are approximately 80 feet tall and 85 feet wide . The animation in the ride uses computer generated 3D animation rendered by Blur Studio and Reel FX , rather than the traditional 2 @-@ D animation seen on The Simpsons and the queue and pre @-@ show of the ride . The animation reference was provided by Film Roman , the animation studio that animates the series . Each car contains 12 speakers and a Dolby 6 @.@ 1 surround sound , while the domes contain an additional 90 speakers . 
 The ride vehicles are themed to look like cars from a classic dark ride , and like the previous Back to the Future attraction , the vehicles feature fake wheels and gull @-@ wing doors . Each dome features 12 8 @-@ passenger ride vehicles arranged in three tiered rows of four . Each vehicle is mounted on a motion platform atop a scissor lift , which raises the vehicle 9 feet into the dome . The motion platforms are capable of a total motion of three feet . In addition to the motion @-@ based ride vehicles , riders also feel water effects , smoke , mist , and experience lighting effects and scents . 
 The Simpsons Ride uses new technology that cuts down on its energy consumption . According to Universal Studios , the ride is able to save over 55 @,@ 000 watts on average and 662 @,@ 000 watt @-@ hours per day . The ride includes over 2 @,@ 500 LEDs , the largest number in theme park history , which allows the ride to cut down on lighting energy by almost one quarter when compared to incandescent lighting . 
 = = = Voice cast = = = 
 The ride features more than 24 regular characters from The Simpsons and features the voices of the regular cast members , as well as Pamela Hayden , Russi Taylor and Kelsey Grammer . Harry Shearer , however , decided not to participate in the ride , so none of his characters have vocal parts and many do not appear in the ride at all . In homage to the Back to the Future ride that it has replaced , The Simpsons Ride 's queue video features a brief animated cameo from Doc Brown who is voiced by Christopher Lloyd .

 At Universal Studios Florida and Universal Studios Hollywood , the park converted much of the World Expo and some of the Upper Lot in Universal Studios Hollywood into one based on Springfield . The new area includes some iconic landmarks from The Simpsons such as Krusty Burger , Frying Dutchman , Luigi 's Pizza , Lard Lad Donuts , Bumblebee Man 's Taco Truck , Moe 's Tavern , The Android 's Dungeon & Baseball Card Shop and a Duff Brewery . The park also added one amusement ride named " Kang & Kodos ' Twirl ' n ' Hurl "

 The Simpsons Ride was well received by fans after it opened . Seth <unk> of Orlando Weekly described the ride as " a more than worthy successor " to Back to the Future : The Ride . Brady MacDonald of the Los Angeles Times described the ride as " visually stunning " and said it " truly delivers — with loads of in @-@ jokes and satire for serious fanatics and tons of thrills and fun for casual fans . " Elise Thompson of the <unk> said " the ride is a total blast , with plenty of laughs as well as thrills . " 
 Jay Cridlin of the St. Petersburg Times wrote that " the ride is packed with more original , funny material than you 'd expect to see in a sitcom , much less a theme park . " However , he admitted that the ride was " a little <unk> " . 
 The Universal Studios Florida version of the ride hosted its one millionth rider on 14 July 2008 , reaching the milestone faster than any other attraction in the resort . The ride was named the best new attraction of 2008 by the website <unk>

 Saint Young Men ( Japanese : <unk> ( <unk> ) ☆ <unk> , Hepburn : <unk> <unk> ) is a Japanese slice of life comedy manga series written and illustrated by Hikaru Nakamura . Its plot involves Jesus Christ and Gautama Buddha , who are living as roommates in an apartment in Tokyo . It has been serialized by Kodansha in the monthly seinen manga magazine Morning 2 since September 2006 , with chapters collected in twelve tankōbon volumes as of November 2015 . A @-@ 1 Pictures adapted the manga series into two original animation DVDs ( OADs ) and an anime film which was released on May 10 , 2013 . 
 In Japan , the Saint Young Men manga has sold over 10 million copies . Individual volumes of the series have frequently appeared on lists of the weekly and annual best @-@ seller manga in Japan . It received a Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize and was nominated at the Angoulême International Comics Festival . Its film adaptation has been well received by the Japanese public . 
 = = Overview = = 
 Jesus Christ ( <unk> ・ <unk> , Iesu <unk> , voiced by Mirai Moriyama in the anime ) and Gautama Buddha ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> , voiced by Gen Hoshino in the anime ) , the founders of Christianity and Buddhism respectively , are living together as roommates in an apartment in Tachikawa , part of the suburbs of Tokyo . While taking a vacation on Earth , they attempt to hide their identities and understand modern Japanese society . Each chapter shows their lives during an average day , when they are sightseeing , drinking beer , blogging , or playing video games . 
 While Jesus is portrayed as an impassioned person for his love for all ( even for shopping ) , Buddha tends to be calm and thrifty , and also likes manga . The comedy often involves visual gags and puns , as well as jokes in reference to elements of Christianity and Buddhism ; for example , Jesus creates wine from water in a public bath and Buddha shines when excited .

 Before writing Saint Young Men , Hikaru Nakamura was working on Arakawa Under the Bridge , which started to be serialized on December 3 , 2004 , in the first issue of Square Enix 's manga magazine Young Gangan . It attracted the attention of an editor of the magazine Weekly Morning , who wanted Nakamura to publish a series for the magazine . She accepted the offer because of her admiration for <unk> Kawaguchi 's works , such as <unk> and The Silent Service , that were serialized in Weekly Morning . The series ' title is derived from a song by Denki Groove and <unk> Dara Parr called " Saint Ojisan " ( <unk> ☆ <unk> , <unk> Ojisan , literally " Saint Old Man " ) . Starting from sketches of two friends wearing casual shirts , she conceived the idea of portraying Jesus and Buddha as average people . 
 Nakamura envisioned a comedy manga in which the protagonist would be a " very very powerful character " , and realized a divine character would fit this premise . She first planned Jesus to be a character in the series , but to make the gags work well , Buddha was added to the series . Their opposing personalities was inspired by Nakamura 's sister and her sister 's husband ; by observing their relationship , she saw some amusing situations . She also saw a resemblance between her version of Buddha and Osamu Tezuka 's version . 
 Despite the religious references in the series , Nakamura stated she used only her personal knowledge and some aspects of modern society , such as yakuza and blogging , which were not intended to be critical but were added because they fit the story . Similarly , secondary characters were only introduced in the series if a chapter needed a new character to introduce a topic . The themes of the chapters were created before the situations and jokes . However , if Nakamura had a specific theme , she created several jokes and then connected them to form a story . When creating a simpler chapter as compared to the more elaborate , thematic ones , she wrote without worrying about creating jokes and situations in advance . With the help of her four assistants , on average she took between ten days and two weeks to make a complete chapter .

 Saint Young Men , written and illustrated by Hikaru Nakamura , began its serialization in Kodansha 's seinen manga magazine Morning 2 on September 26 , 2006 . The series was put on hiatus between September 22 , 2011 , and March 22 , 2012 , because of Nakamura 's pregnancy . Its first tankōbon ( collected volume ) was released by Kodansha on January 23 , 2008 , and the twelfth volume was published on November 20 , 2015 . A guidebook was released on April 23 , 2013 . 
 The series has been translated in other languages , including Chinese by Tong Li Publishing , French by Kurokawa , Italian by J @-@ Pop , and Spanish by Norma Editorial . Ed Chavez , editor of the American publisher Vertical , contacted the Japanese licensor of the series to request its publishing in North America . The Japanese licensor of the series refused to allow it to be published in North America , because it was thought that Americans might take offense to it .

 In an interview with NHK World , the staff for the anime noted that they wanted to stay loyal to the artwork of the manga while creating the movie . They decided to focus more on the art and character designs , and decided to give it a " sketched " look , instead of the traditional " bold , dark lines " typically used . All the shadows were colored by pencils , sometimes even scribbled to make sure that the " sketched " look came through . Like the manga , the anime film also recreates various attractions of Tachikawa , including the Showa Memorial Park .

 Saint Young Men received the 2009 Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize for Short Work Manga . The 2009 edition of <unk> 's guidebook Kono Manga ga Sugoi ! , which surveys people in the manga and publishing industry , named it the best manga series for male readers . It was nominated for the category " Best Comic " at the Angoulême International Comics Festival . As the result of its popularity , issues of Morning 2 started selling out on newsstands ; because of this , in May 2009 Kodansha began making the magazine available online the day it is published . It has been among the top 20 of best @-@ selling manga series in Japan in 2009 , 2011 and 2013 . All individual volumes except for the 12th appeared on lists of the 50 best @-@ selling manga of their respective year in Japan . By May 2013 , the manga had sold about 10 million copies in Japan . The manga was also displayed at the British Museum in 2011 . In 2014 , The Daily Dot reported a growing Western fandom that spread various Tumblr GIFs of the series . 
 Comics writer Paul Gravett chose it as one of the best comics of Japan in 2008 , while writers Shaenon Garrity and Jason Thompson elected it as one of the most wanted titles for licensing in 2010 . Japanese manga critic Kaoru Nagayama has noted that the manga is " fun to read " and commended Arakawa for keeping Jesus and Buddha faithful to their real character — of kindness — even when confronted by evil . Carlo Santos from Anime News Network criticized it for its art and questioned its capacity to evolve into something other than " Jesus and Buddha hanging out , while normal people do embarrassing things to them " . Santos complained that Jesus ' and Buddha 's philosophical differences and personalities are not explored . However , Santos praised the series ' comedy , noting its simplicity and saying , " its brilliance comes not from purposely trivializing two of the world 's great religions , but by highlighting the quirks of the secular world when these famous religious figures are placed in it " . According to him , the series does not lose its capacity of making readers laugh as it progress , unlike other manga . Jolyon Baraka Thomas of The Guardian praised the constancy of " visual gags and puns " , and wrote : " Her story is not an introduction to abstruse religious doctrines , nor does it feature much overt commentary on the role of religions in contemporary society .

 = Russian battleship Oslyabya = 
 Oslyabya ( Russian : <unk> ) was the second of the three Peresvet @-@ class second @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy at the end of the nineteenth century , although construction delays meant that she was the last to be completed . The ship was part of the Second Pacific Squadron sent to the Far East during the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 , and served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Baron Dmitry von Fölkersam . Oslyabya was sunk on 27 May 1905 at the Battle of Tsushima , and was the first all @-@ steel battleship to be sunk by naval gunfire alone . Sources differ on the exact number of casualties , but over half her crew went down with the ship . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The design of the Peresvet class was inspired by the British second @-@ class battleships of the Centurion class . The British ships were intended to defeat commerce @-@ raiders like the Russian armored cruisers Rossia and Rurik ; the Peresvet @-@ class ships were designed to support the Russian cruisers . This role placed a premium on high speed and long range at the expense of heavy armament and armor . 
 Oslyabya had a length of 434 feet 5 inches ( 132 @.@ 4 m ) overall , a beam of 71 feet 6 inches ( 21 @.@ 79 m ) and a draft of 26 feet 3 inches ( 8 @.@ 0 m ) . Designed to displace 12 @,@ 674 long tons ( 12 @,@ 877 t ) , she was almost 2 @,@ 000 long tons ( 2 @,@ 000 t ) overweight and displaced 14 @,@ 408 long tons ( 14 @,@ 639 t ) when built . Her crew consisted of 27 officers and 744 enlisted men . The ship was powered by three vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines using steam generated by 30 Belleville boilers . The engines were rated at 14 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ 800 kW ) , using forced draft , and designed to reach a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . Oslyabya , however , reached a top speed of 18 @.@ 33 knots ( 33 @.@ 95 km / h ; 21 @.@ 09 mph ) from 15 @,@ 051 indicated horsepower ( 11 @,@ 224 kW ) during her sea trials in September 1902 . She carried a maximum of 2 @,@ 060 long tons ( 2 @,@ 090 t ) of coal which allowed her to steam for 6 @,@ 200 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 500 km ; 7 @,@ 100 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The ship 's main battery consisted of four 10 @-@ inch ( 254 mm ) guns mounted in two twin @-@ gun turrets , one forward and one aft of the superstructure . The secondary armament consisted of eleven Canet 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns , mounted in casemates on the sides of the hull and in the bow , underneath the forecastle . Smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats . These included twenty 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) QF guns , twenty 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns and eight 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns . She was also armed with five 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) torpedo tubes , three above water and two submerged . The ship carried 45 mines to be used to protect her anchorage . 
 Oslyabya 's waterline armor belt consisted of Harvey armor and was four to nine inches ( 102 to 229 mm ) thick . The belt was 7 feet 9 inches ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) high , of which the upper 36 inches ( 910 mm ) was intended to be above the waterline , but the ship was significantly overweight and only had three inches ( 76 mm ) showing at normal load . At full load , the belt was completely submerged and her only protection was the four @-@ inch upper belt . The Krupp cemented armor of her gun turrets had a maximum thickness of nine inches and her deck ranged from two to three inches ( 51 to 76 mm ) thick . 
 = = Construction and career = = 
 Oslyabya , named for Rodion Oslyabya , a 14th @-@ century monk of the <unk> @-@ <unk> Lavra and a hero of the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380 , was laid down on 21 November 1895 by the New Admiralty Shipyard in Saint Petersburg and launched on 8 November 1898 . Problems at the New Admiralty Shipyard delayed her completion until 1903 at a cost of 11 @,@ 340 @,@ 000 rubles . The ship sailed for Port Arthur on 7 August 1903 with the armored cruiser Bayan , but Oslyabya ran aground in the Strait of Gibraltar on 21 August and was under repair until late November , first in Algeria , then at La Spezia , Italy . After repairs , the ship resumed her voyage to the Far East , but she was recalled to join the Baltic Fleet on 12 February 1904 , following the start of the Russo @-@ Japanese War three days previously . After arrival at St. Petersburg in April , Oslyabya was fitted with 4 @.@ 5 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) Barr & Stroud rangefinders , telescopic gun sights , a new ventilation system , and Telefunken radio equipment . 
 = = = Russo @-@ Japanese War = = = 
 The Russian strategy since 1897 had been for ships from the Baltic Fleet to be ordered to the Far East if war with Japan broke out , while the First Pacific Squadron in Port Arthur would avoid a general fleet battle until reinforcements arrived . On 15 October 1904 , Oslyabya set sail for Port Arthur from Libau as von Fölkersam 's flagship , along with the other vessels of the Second Pacific Squadron , under the overall command of Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky . Historian Mark <unk> said that : " This epic 18 @,@ 000 @-@ mile ( 29 @,@ 000 km ) journey was the longest voyage of a coal @-@ powered battleship fleet in history . " En route to Denmark , the battleship was slightly damaged when the destroyer <unk> collided with her . When his ships reached the port of Tangier , Morocco , on 28 October , Rozhestvensky ordered his older battleships , under the command of von Fölkersam , to go through the Mediterranean and Red Sea to rendezvous with his main force in Madagascar . Rozhestvensky led his squadron , including Oslyabya , down the Atlantic coast of Africa , rounding Cape Horn , and reached the island of Nosy Be off the northwest coast of Madagascar on 9 January 1905 , where they remained for two months while Rozhestvensky finalized his coaling arrangements . By this time Port Arthur had surrendered to the Japanese and he could not count on resupplying there , nor rendezvousing with the First Pacific Squadron . Rozhestvensky 's reunited squadron sailed for Camranh Bay , French Indochina , on 16 March and reached it almost a month later to await the obsolete ships of the Third Pacific Squadron , commanded by Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov . These reached Camranh Bay on 9 May and the combined force sailed for Vladivostok on 14 May . 
 En route , Rozhestvensky reorganized his ships into three tactical divisions for the forthcoming battle ; the first consisted of the four new Borodino @-@ class battleships commanded by himself , von Fölkersam commanded the Second Division that consisted of the battleships Oslyabya , Navarin , Sissoi Veliky and the armored cruiser Admiral Nakhimov , and Nebogatov retained his ships as the Third Division . Von Fölkersam , ill with cancer , died on 26 May and Rozhestvensky decided not to inform the fleet in order to keep morale up . Oslyabya 's Captain 1st Rank Vladimir Ber became the commander of the Second Division , while Nebogatov had no idea that he was now the squadron 's de facto second @-@ in @-@ command . 
 While figures are not available for Oslyabya , one Russian account after the battle said that the Borodinos were approximately 1 @,@ 700 long tons ( 1 @,@ 700 t ) overweight as they were overloaded with coal and other supplies that were stored high in the ships , reducing their stability . Oslyabya 's main armor belt was fully submerged with a full load , much less any additional coal and supplies , and thus the four @-@ inch @-@ thick upper armor was the only available protection for the ship 's waterline . 
 = = = = Battle of Tsushima = = = = 
 The Russians were spotted early on the morning of 27 May by Japanese ships as they entered the Korea Strait en route to Vladivostok . During the subsequent battle Oslyabya led the Second Division of the squadron and was initially the target of at least two battleships and a pair of armored cruisers when the Japanese opened fire at 14 : 10 . As the Japanese approached , Rozhestvensky ordered the fleet to move from line ahead formation to parallel columns and Oslyabya was forced to almost stop in her tracks to avoid hitting the battleship Oryol , the last ship of Rozhestvensky 's division , as she maneuvered . Almost immediately , the shells began inflicting damage , knocking out the rangefinder , wounding the gunnery officer and severing the cables connecting the guns to the Geisler fire @-@ control system . Other hits shot away the mainmast and knocked out the forward gun turret as well as three of the port six @-@ inch guns . Splinters from one of the many hits entered her conning tower , killing the quartermaster and wounding most of the men inside . This caused the ship to fall out of line to starboard and she was engaged by six Japanese armored cruisers at short range . More serious were several large @-@ caliber shells that struck along the ship 's waterline about 15 minutes into the engagement that caused major flooding ; they opened up enough of the ship 's bow to the sea that her forward motion forced more and more water into her hull and she began listing to port . Flooding of her starboard forward magazine was ordered in an attempt to counteract the list , but it just added more weight forward and destroyed the ship 's stability . Oslyabya 's list increased to 12 degrees at 14 : 20 , flooding many of the lower turrets . Her funnels touched the water around 15 : 10 and Ber ordered " abandon ship " . The ship sank a few minutes later , with her starboard propeller still turning , taking Ber and 470 of her crew with her . 
 = Russian battleship Poltava ( 1894 ) = 
 The Russian battleship Poltava ( Russian : <unk> ) was one of three Petropavlovsk @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1890s . The ship was transferred to the Pacific Squadron shortly after completion and based at Port Arthur from 1901 . During the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 , she participated in the Battle of Port Arthur and was heavily damaged during the Battle of the Yellow Sea . She was sunk by Japanese artillery during the subsequent Siege of Port Arthur in December 1904 , but was raised by the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) after the war and renamed Tango ( <unk> ) . 
 During World War I , she bombarded German fortifications during the Siege of Tsingtao . The Japanese government sold Tango back to the Russians at their request in 1916 . She was renamed Chesma ( Чесма ) as her former name had been given to a new ship . En route to the White Sea , she joined an Allied force that persuaded the Greek government to disarm their ships . Her crew declared for the Bolsheviks in October 1917 , but made no effort to resist when the British decided to intervene in the Russian Civil War in early 1918 . In poor condition , the ship was used as a prison hulk . Abandoned by the British when they withdrew in 1919 and recaptured by the Bolsheviks , she was scrapped in 1924 .

 Poltava was 376 feet ( 114 @.@ 6 m ) long overall , with a beam of 70 feet ( 21 @.@ 3 m ) and a draft of 28 feet 3 inches ( 8 @.@ 6 m ) . Designed to displace 10 @,@ 960 long tons ( 11 @,@ 140 t ) , she was over 500 long tons ( 510 t ) overweight and displaced 11 @,@ 500 long tons ( 11 @,@ 700 t ) when completed . The ship was powered by two vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , built by the British firm of Humphrys , Tennant and Dykes , each driving one shaft , using steam generated by 14 cylindrical fire @-@ tube boilers . The engines were rated at 10 @,@ 600 indicated horsepower ( 7 @,@ 900 kW ) and designed to reach a top speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) , but Poltava reached a speed of 16 @.@ 29 knots ( 30 @.@ 17 km / h ; 18 @.@ 75 mph ) from 11 @,@ 213 indicated horsepower ( 8 @,@ 362 kW ) during her sea trials . She carried a maximum of 1 @,@ 050 long tons ( 1 @,@ 070 t ) of coal which allowed her to steam for 3 @,@ 750 nautical miles ( 6 @,@ 940 km ; 4 @,@ 320 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Her crew consisted of 26 – 27 officers and 605 – 625 enlisted men . 
 The ship 's main battery consisted of four 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns mounted in two twin @-@ gun turrets , one forward and one aft of the superstructure . Designed to fire one round per 90 seconds , the actual rate of fire was half that . The secondary armament consisted of twelve Canet 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns . Eight of these were mounted in four twin @-@ gun wing turrets and the remaining guns were positioned in unprotected embrasures on the sides of the hull amidships . Smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats . These included a dozen QF 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss guns and twenty @-@ eight 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns . She was also armed with six torpedo tubes , four 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) tubes above water and two 18 @-@ inch ( 457 mm ) submerged tubes , all mounted on the broadside . She carried 50 mines to be used to protect her anchorage . 
 Poltava was the first Russian battleship to use Krupp cemented armor , from Germany . Her waterline armor belt was 10 – 14 @.@ 5 inches ( 254 – 368 mm ) thick . The Krupp armor of her main gun turrets had a maximum thickness of 10 inches ( 254 mm ) and her secondary gun turrets were protected by 5 inches ( 127 mm ) of armor . The nickel steel armor of her protective decks ranged from 2 to 3 inches ( 51 to 76 mm ) in thickness and the sides of her conning tower were 9 inches ( 229 mm ) thick . 
 = = Construction and service = = 
 Poltava was named for the victory at the 1709 Battle of Poltava when Peter the Great defeated King Charles XII of Sweden . Delayed by shortages of skilled workmen , design changes and late delivery of the main armament , the ship was laid down on 19 May 1892 at the Galernii Island shipyard and launched on 6 November 1894 . Her trials lasted from 1898 to 1899 and she was then briefly assigned to the Baltic Fleet . Together with her sister ship Sevastopol , Poltava had a radio installed in September 1900 , the first ships in the Imperial Russian Navy to get such equipment . On 15 October the sisters set sail for Port Arthur and later had to unload much of their ammunition , coal and other stores to reduce their drafts enough to pass through the Suez Canal . Poltava arrived at Port Arthur on 12 April 1901 , the day before her sister .

 After the Japanese victory in the First Sino @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 95 , both Russia and Japan had ambitions to control Manchuria and Korea which naturally caused problems between them . A further issue was the Russian failure to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in October 1903 as promised . Japan had begun negotiations to reduce the tensions in 1901 , but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve the problems . Japan interpreted this as deliberate prevarication designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs . The final straws were news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea . These caused the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was now inevitable . The Pacific Squadron began mooring in the outer harbor at night as tensions with Japan increased , in order to react more quickly to any Japanese attempt to land troops in Korea . 
 On the night of 8 / 9 February 1904 , the IJN launched a surprise attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur . Poltava was not hit by the initial attack by torpedo boats and sortied the following morning when the Combined Fleet , commanded by Vice Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō , attacked . Tōgō had expected the surprise night attack by his ships to be much more successful than it was , anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened , but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack . The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser Boyarin , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defenses . Tōgō chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns . Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese eight @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) and six @-@ inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships , which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect . Poltava was hit several times with little effect and only three men wounded . She fired 12 twelve @-@ inch and 55 six @-@ inch shells during the battle . 
 Poltava participated in the action of 13 April , when Tōgō successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron , including Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov 's flagship , her sister Petropavlovsk . When Makarov spotted the five Japanese battleships , he turned back for Port Arthur and his flagship struck a minefield laid by the Japanese the previous night . The ship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded , and Makarov was one of the 677 killed . Emboldened by his success , Tōgō resumed long @-@ range bombardment missions , prompting the Russians to lay more minefields , which sank two of his battleships the following month . 
 Rear Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft became the new commander of the First Pacific Squadron and led a half @-@ hearted attempt to reach Vladivostok on 23 June ; intercepted by the Combined Fleet , he returned to Port Arthur without engaging the Japanese ships . Poltava , together with cruisers and destroyers , sortied to bombard Japanese coast defense positions on 9 July and briefly engaged Japanese ships that intercepted her . During the summer , the ship landed many of her 47 mm and 37 mm guns to reinforce the defenses of the port . 
 = = = Battle of the Yellow Sea = = = 
 On 10 August the Imperial Japanese Army , which had been slowly pushing south to Port Arthur , began an assault on the city 's outer defenses . With their base now directly under attack , the First Pacific Squadron sortied in the morning , around 07 : 00 , in an attempt to escape to Vladivostok . The Japanese fleet intercepted the Russian ships at 12 : 55 in what became the Battle of the Yellow Sea . 
 Poltava was sixth in the column of Russian ships when the Japanese engaged them , and from her position started to bombard Asahi at around 14 : 45 . The battleship Mikasa , the Japanese flagship , then fired several shots that hit Poltava , causing the Russian squadron to drop back to support her . The Russians scored several hits on Mikasa , including two by Poltava . She also scored one hit on the armored cruiser Nisshin . Owing to the damage Mikasa had sustained , the Japanese fleet broke off the attack at around 15 : 20 and turned to starboard , opening the range . By 17 : 35 the Japanese were again closing on the Russian rear . Mikasa and three other battleships opened fire on Poltava and three armored cruisers , but problems with their turrets forced the Japanese battleships to break off the engagement . They returned at 18 : 30 , with Shikishima and Asahi firing on Poltava . As the Russian fleet began to slip away , two 12 @-@ inch shells from Asahi penetrated the conning tower of the Russian flagship Tsesarevich , killing Vitgeft and the helmsman , severely wounding the captain , and causing the ship to come to a dead stop after executing a sharp turn . Thinking that this was a maneuver planned by Vitgeft , the Russian line started to execute the same turn , causing all of the ships directly behind Tsesarevich , including Poltava , to maneuver wildly to avoid hitting the stationary flagship . Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky , second in command of the squadron , signaled the other Russian ships to steam back to Port Arthur . The signal flags were only gradually recognized by Pobeda , Sevastopol , Pallada and Poltava and the other vessels took some time to re @-@ form for the return voyage . Poltava was hit by 12 to 14 large @-@ caliber shells during the battle that knocked out five of her 6 @-@ inch guns , as well as killing 12 crewmen and wounding 43 . Poltava , along with Tsesarevich and Peresvet , sustained hits at the waterline that crippled their maneuverability , preventing the Russian squadron from fleeing to Vladivostok . 
 = = = Siege of Port Arthur = = = 
 Returning to Port Arthur on 11 August , the Russian squadron found the city still under siege by the Japanese Third Army led by Baron Nogi Maresuke . Poltava was hit on 18 August by four 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) shells , fired by a battery , that wounded six men . The new squadron commander , Rear Admiral Robert N. Viren , believed in reinforcing the landward defenses of the port and continued to strip guns , and sailors to man them , from his ships . By September Poltava had lost a total of three 6 @-@ inch , four 47 mm and twenty @-@ six 37 mm guns . That same month , she began bombarding Japanese positions ; through November she fired one hundred ten 12 @-@ inch shells and an unknown number of 6 @-@ inch shells . 
 In October the advancing Third Army began to bombard the harbor with 28 @-@ centimeter ( 11 in ) siege howitzers , firing at random . They hit Poltava twice on 7 October , though the shells only started fires . On 5 December the Japanese captured 203 Meter Hill , a crucial position that overlooked the harbor and allowed them to direct their artillery at the Russian ships . Poltava was hit that same day by five shells , three of which penetrated the deck . One hit a torpedo room , and another burst in the aft 47 mm magazine . That started a fire that could not be put out because the flooding system had been previously damaged and eventually ignited propellant charges in the adjacent 12 @-@ inch magazine . About a half @-@ hour after the hit , the magazine exploded and blew a hole in the ship 's bottom that caused her to sink 45 minutes later in the shallow water .

 Following the capitulation of Port Arthur in January 1905 , Japanese engineers refloated Poltava on 22 July , and commissioned her as Tango a month later , taking her name from the ancient Japanese province of Tango , now a part of Kyoto Prefecture . Classified as a 1st class battleship , she departed for Maizuru Naval Arsenal two days later and arrived on 29 August . Except for participating in the review of captured ships on 23 October 1905 , she remained there under repair until November 1907 . Tango then sailed to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal to complete fitting out . 
 The IJN made several changes to the ship as she was repaired . Her fighting top was removed and her boilers were replaced by 16 Miyabara water @-@ tube boilers . She retained her main guns , but their breeches were replaced by Japanese @-@ built ones . Her secondary armament was replaced by Japanese @-@ built guns ; her light armament was revised to ten QF 12 @-@ pounder 12 cwt and four 37 mm guns . Four 18 @-@ inch above @-@ water torpedo tubes replaced her original torpedo armament . Her crew now numbered 668 officers and crewmen . 
 Tango joined the fleet in 1911 and was re @-@ classified as a 1st class coast defense ship in 1912 . In 1913 she participated in the annual fleet maneuvers as part of the " enemy " force . She was assigned to the 2nd Squadron , commanded by Vice Admiral Kato Sadakichi , shortly after World War I began . The squadron was tasked to blockade the German @-@ owned port of Tsingtao , China , and to cooperate with the Imperial Japanese Army in capturing the city . Tango and the other ships of the squadron bombarded German fortifications throughout the siege until the Germans surrendered on 7 November . 
 = = = Return to Russia = = = 
 In 1916 the Russian government decided to reinforce its naval strength outside the Baltic and Black Seas . As Japan and Russia were allies during the war , the Japanese government sold Tango and some other ex @-@ Russian warships back to Russia in March . The battleship arrived at Vladivostok on 2 April and was turned over to the Russians on either 3 or 4 April . Her former name had been given to the new dreadnought battleship Poltava , so Tango was renamed Chesma , after the 1770 Battle of Chesma . She departed Vladivostok on 2 July and arrived at Port Said , Egypt , on 19 September . 
 Chesma joined the Allied fleet off Salamis demanding the disarmament of the Greek fleet later that month and departed after the Greeks agreed to meet the Allied demands . Her machinery was overhauled at Birkenhead by Cammell Laird , beginning on 5 December , and her main deck six @-@ inch and 12 @-@ pounder guns were removed . In exchange she received four anti @-@ aircraft guns mounted on her superstructure . She arrived at <unk> , a port in the Murmansk Oblast , on 16 January 1917 and the political situation became very confused with the February Revolution shortly after her arrival . She was assigned to the White Sea Fleet on 3 February . Her crew declared for the Bolsheviks in October , but made no effort to interfere with the Allied landing at Murmansk in March 1918 . Although the ship was deemed " aground and unseaworthy " by the British shortly afterwards , they seized the ship and used her as a floating prison in April 1919 to house 40 Bolshevik prisoners . After the British withdrew , the abandoned ship was captured by the Red Army in March 1920 and incorporated into the Bolshevik White Sea Military Flotilla on 24 April . No longer of any military value , she was turned over to the port of Archangelsk on 16 June 1921 and stricken from the list of naval vessels on 3 July 1924 , after which she was scrapped . 
 = Capture of USS Chesapeake = 
 The Capture of USS Chesapeake , or the Battle of Boston Harbor , was fought on 1 June 1813 , between the Royal Navy 's frigate HMS Shannon and American frigate USS Chesapeake , as part of the War of 1812 between the United States and Great Britain . The Chesapeake was captured in a brief but intense action in which over 80 men were killed . This was the only frigate action of the war in which there was no preponderance of force on either side . 
 At Boston , Captain James Lawrence took command of Chesapeake on 20 May 1813 , and on 1 June , put to sea to meet the waiting HMS Shannon , the frigate whose written challenge had just missed Chesapeake 's sailing . Chesapeake suffered early in the exchange of gunfire , having her wheel and fore topsail halyard shot away , rendering her unmanoeuvrable . Lawrence himself was mortally wounded and was carried below . The American crew struggled to carry out their captain 's last order , " Don 't give up the ship ! " , but the British boarding party overwhelmed them . The battle was notably intense but of short duration , lasting ten to fifteen minutes , in which time 252 men were killed or wounded . Shannon 's Captain Philip Broke was severely injured in fighting on the forecastle . Chesapeake and her crew were taken to Halifax , Nova Scotia , where the sailors were imprisoned ; the ship was repaired and taken into service by the Royal Navy . She was sold at Portsmouth , England in 1819 and broken up . Surviving timbers were used to build the nearby Chesapeake Mill in Wickham and can be seen and visited to this day . Shannon survived longer , being broken up in 1859 . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 = = = Philip Broke and his naval gunnery = = = 
 During his long period in command of Shannon , Captain Philip Broke of the Royal Navy introduced many practical refinements to his ' great guns ' , which were virtually unheard of elsewhere in contemporary naval gunnery . He had ' <unk> sights ' fitted to his 18 @-@ pounder long guns , which improved aiming as they compensated for the narrowing of the barrels from the breech to the muzzle . He had the elevating ' quoins ' ( wedge @-@ shaped pieces of wood placed under the breech ) of his long guns grooved to mark various degrees of elevation so that his guns could be reliably levelled to fire horizontally in any state of heeling of the ship under a press of sail . The carronades were similarly treated , but the elevating screws on these cannon were marked in paint . As the decks of contemporary ships curved upwards towards the stern and bows , he cut down the wheels on the " up @-@ slope " side of each cannon 's carriage in order that all guns were level with the horizon . He also introduced a system where bearings were incised into the deck next to each gun ; fire could then be directed to any bearing independent of the ability of any particular gun crew to see the target . Fire from the whole battery could also be focused on any part of an enemy ship . 
 Broke drilled his crew to an extremely high standard of naval gunnery ; he regularly had them fire at targets , such as floating barrels . Often these drills would be made into competitions to see which gun crew could hit the target and how fast they could do so . He even had his gun crews fire at targets ' blindfold ' to good effect ; they were only given the bearing to lay their gun on without being allowed to sight the gun on the target themselves . This constituted a very early example of ' director firing ' . 
 In addition to these gunnery drills , Broke was fond of preparing hypothetical scenarios to test his crew . For example , after all hands had been drummed to quarters , he would inform them of a theoretical attack and see how they would act to defend the ship . Though the use of cutlasses in training was avoided a method of swordsmanship training called ' <unk> ' was regularly practised . This was a game employing roughly similar cuts , thrusts and parries as were used with the cutlass , but as it was played with wooden sticks with wicker hand guards ; hits , although painful , were not often dangerous . It soon developed quickness of eye and wrist . Many of the crew became very expert . 
 = = = James Lawrence = = = 
 Commander Lawrence of the United States Navy returned from a successful war cruise having defeated the sloop HMS Peacock . He was promoted to captain for his victory , and received orders to take command of USS Chesapeake . It was not a command that he particularly wanted . He had hoped for the larger frigate USS Constitution instead . However , he had little choice in the matter as the letter from Secretary of the Navy William Jones was an order and not a request . Lawrence travelled to Boston . Lawrence found that most of the former crew of Chesapeake had left over a dispute over prize money and had since been replaced . Lawrence 's prior experience of the British Navy worked against him . In his former battle with HMS Peacock the warship had been bravely fought , but the British gunnery had been nothing less than atrocious . His crew was laden with good seamen ; however , they lacked the time working together that was needed to change a collection of good seamen into an efficient fighting crew . Lawrence 's assumptions concerning the poor quality of the opposition would leave him over @-@ confident in facing the adversary he was about to encounter . 
 = = = Issuing a challenge = = = 
 Eager to engage and defeat one of the American frigates that had already scored a number of victories over the Royal Navy in single ship confrontations , Broke prepared a challenge . USS President had already slipped out of the harbour under the cover of fog and had evaded the British . Constitution was undergoing extensive repairs and alterations and would not be ready for sea in the foreseeable future . However , Chesapeake appeared to be ready to put to sea . Consequently Broke decided to challenge Chesapeake , which had been refitting in Boston harbour under the command of Captain James Lawrence , offering single ship @-@ to @-@ ship combat . Whilst patrolling offshore , Shannon had intercepted and captured a number of American ships attempting to reach the harbour . After sending two of them off to Halifax , he found that his crew was being dangerously reduced . Broke therefore resorted to burning the rest of the prizes in order to conserve his highly trained crew in anticipation of the battle with Chesapeake . The boats from the burnt prizes were sent into Boston , carrying Broke 's oral invitation to Lawrence to come out and engage him . Broke had already sent Tenedos away in the hope that the more favourable odds would entice the Americans out , but eventually began to despair that Chesapeake would ever come out of the harbour . He finally decided to send a written challenge . In this he was copying his adversary . Lawrence had earlier in the war , when captain of the sloop of war Hornet , sent a written invitation to the captain of the British sloop of war Bonne Citoyenne to a single @-@ ship contest . Lawrence 's offer had been declined . 
 As the Chesapeake appears now ready for sea , I request you will do me the favour to meet the Shannon with her , ship to ship , to try the fortune of our respective flags . The Shannon mounts twenty @-@ four guns upon her broadside and one light boat @-@ gun ; 18 pounders upon her maindeck , and 32 @-@ pounder carronades upon her quarterdeck and forecastle ; and is manned with a complement of 300 men and boys , beside thirty seamen , boys , and passengers , who were taken out of recaptured vessels lately . I entreat you , sir , not to imagine that I am urged by mere personal vanity to the wish of meeting the Chesapeake , or that I depend only upon your personal ambition for your acceding to this invitation . We have both noble motives . You will feel it as a compliment if I say that the result of our meeting may be the most grateful service I can render to my country ; and I doubt not that you , equally confident of success , will feel convinced that it is only by repeated triumphs in even combats that your little navy can now hope to console your country for the loss of that trade it can no longer protect . Favour me with a speedy reply . We are short of provisions and water , and cannot stay long here . 
 Captain Lawrence did not in fact receive Broke 's letter and , according to author Ian W. Toll , it would not have made the slightest difference ; Lawrence intended to sail USS Chesapeake at the first day of favourable weather . The fact that it was not in his nation 's interests at this point in the war to be challenging British frigates seems to have not entered into his reasoning . When USS President had slipped out of harbor , it was to embark on a commerce @-@ raiding mission , which was deemed in the U.S. national interest . Half of the officers and up to one quarter of the crew were new to the ship . In the short time he was in command of the Chesapeake Lawrence had twice exercised his crew at the great guns , walking the decks and personally supervising the drill . He also instigated a signal , a bugle call , to call on his crew to board an enemy vessel . Unfortunately the only crew member able to produce a note on the bugle was a " dull @-@ witted " ' loblolly boy ' ( surgeon 's assistant ) called William Brown . Lawrence believed that he would win the battle and wrote two quick notes , one to the Secretary of the Navy pronouncing his intentions , and another to his brother in @-@ law asking him to look after Lawrence 's wife and children in event of his death . 
 By now HMS Shannon had been off Boston for 56 days and was running short of provisions , whilst the extended period at sea was wearing the ship down . She would be at a disadvantage facing USS Chesapeake , fresh from harbour and a refit . A boat was despatched carrying the invitation , manned by a Mr Slocum , a discharged American prisoner . The boat had not reached the shore when Chesapeake was seen underway , sailing out of the harbour . She was flying three American ensigns and a large white flag at the foremast inscribed ' Free Trade and Sailor 's Rights ' . Shannon carried 276 officers , seamen and marines of her proper complement , eight recaptured seamen , 22 Irish labourers who had been 48 hours in the ship , of whom only four could speak English , and 24 boys , of whom about 13 were under 12 years of age . Broke had trained his gun crews to fire accurate broadsides into the hulls of enemy vessels , with the aim of killing their gun crews , rather than shooting down the masts . Lawrence meanwhile was confident in his ship , especially since she carried a substantially larger crew . Previous American victories over Royal Navy ships left him expectant of success . Just before the engagement , the American crew gave three cheers . 
 The two ships had in one another about as close a match in size and force as was possible , given the variations in ship design and armament existing between contemporary navies . USS Chesapeake 's ( rated at 38 guns ) armament of 28 18 @-@ pounder long guns was an exact match for HMS Shannon . Measurements proved the ships to be about the same deck length , the only major difference being the ships ' complements : Chesapeake 's 379 against the Shannon 's 330 .

 As the American ship approached , Broke spoke to his crew , ending with a description of his philosophy of gunnery , " Throw no shot away . Aim every one . Keep cool . Work steadily . Fire into her quarters – maindeck to maindeck , quarterdeck to quarterdeck . Don 't try to dismast her . Kill the men and the ship is yours . " 
 The two ships met at half past five in the afternoon , 20 nautical miles ( 37 km ) east of the Boston Light , between Cape Ann and Cape Cod . Shannon was flying a weather @-@ worn blue ensign , and her dilapidated outside appearance after a long period at sea suggested that she would be an easy opponent . Observing the Chesapeake 's many flags , a sailor had questioned Broke : " <unk> 't we have three ensigns , sir , like she has ? " " No , " said Broke , " we 've always been an unassuming ship . " HMS Shannon refused to fire upon USS Chesapeake as she bore down , nor would USS Chesapeake rake HMS Shannon despite having the weather gage . Lawrence 's behaviour that day earned him praise from the British officers for gallantry . 
 The two ships opened fire just before 18 : 00 at a range of about 35 metres ( 115 ft ) , with Shannon scoring the first hit , striking Chesapeake on one of her forward gunports with two round shot and a bag of musket balls fired by William <unk> , the gun captain of the aftmost of Shannon 's starboard 18 @-@ pounders . Chesapeake was moving faster than Shannon , and as she ranged down the side of the British ship , the destruction inflicted by the precise and methodical gunnery of the British crew moved aft with the American 's forward gun crews suffering the heaviest losses . However , the American crew were well drilled and , despite their losses , returned fire briskly . As Chesapeake was heeling , many of their shots struck the water or waterline of Shannon causing little damage , but American carronade fire caused serious damage to Shannon 's rigging . In particular , a 32 @-@ pound carronade ball struck the piled shot for the Shannon 's 12 @-@ pounder gun that was stowed in the main chains ; the shot was propelled through the timbers to scatter like hail across the gundeck . 
 As the distance closed , the Shannon 's gun crews and topmen kept up a relentless fire , and the unprotected quarter @-@ deck became as uninhabitable as the surface of the moon . 
 Captain Lawrence realised that his ship 's speed would take it past Shannon and ordered a ' pilot 's <unk> ' . This was a small and brief turn to windward which would make the sails shiver and reduce the ship 's speed . Just after Chesapeake began this limited turn away from Shannon , she had her means of manoeuvring entirely disabled as a second round of accurate British fire caused more losses , most critically to the men and officers manning Chesapeake 's quarterdeck . Here the helmsmen were killed by a 9 @-@ pounder gun that Broke had ordered installed on the quarter deck for that very purpose , and the same gun shortly afterwards shot away the wheel itself . Surviving American gun crews did land hits on Shannon in their second round of fire , especially American carronade fire which swept Shannon 's forecastle , killing three men , wounding others and disabling Shannon 's nine pounder bow gun while one round shot demolished Shannon 's ship 's bell . 
 At almost the same time as Chesapeake lost control of her helm , her fore @-@ topsail halyard was shot away , her fore @-@ topsail yard then dropped , and she ' <unk> up ' . Losing her forward momentum , she <unk> further into the wind until she was ' in irons ' , her sails were pressed back against her masts and she then made <unk> ( went backwards ) . Her port stern quarter ( rear left corner ) made contact with Shannon 's starboard side , level with the fifth gunport from the bow , and Chesapeake was caught by the projecting fluke of one of Shannon 's anchors , which had been stowed on the gangway . Chesapeake 's <unk> boom then swung over the deck of the British ship . Mr Stevens , Broke 's boatswain , lashed the boom inboard to keep the two ships together , and lost an arm as he did so . 
 Trapped against Shannon at an angle in which few of her guns could fire on the British ship , and unable to manoeuvre away , Chesapeake 's stern now became exposed and was swept by raking fire . Earlier in the action Shannon 's gunnery had devastated Chesapeake 's forward gun crews ; this destruction was now inflicted on the gun crews in the aft part of the ship . The American ship 's situation worsened when a small open cask of musket cartridges abaft the mizzen @-@ mast blew up . When the smoke cleared , Broke judged the time was right and gave the order to board . Captain Lawrence also gave the order to board , but the frightened bugler aboard Chesapeake , William Brown , failed to sound the call , and only those near Lawrence heard his command . By this time Lawrence was the only officer left on the upper deck , as Lieutenants Ludlow and Ballard had been wounded . Lieutenant Cox , who had brought up men from the lower deck to form a boarding party , reached the quarterdeck only to find that his captain had been badly , indeed mortally , wounded by a musket ball . Lawrence was clinging to the binnacle in order to stay upright ; Cox , who had served all his sea life with Lawrence , carried him down to the cockpit with the help of two sailors . As he was being taken down Lawrence called out " Tell the men to fire faster ! Don 't give up the ship ! " 
 = = = The British board = = = 
 In contrast to the confusion and loss of leadership aboard the American vessel , the British boarding party was being effectively organised . A number of small @-@ arms men rushed aboard Chesapeake , led by Broke , including the purser , Mr G. Aldham , and the clerk , Mr John Dunn . Aldham and Dunn were killed as they crossed the gangway , but the rest of the party made it onto Chesapeake . Captain Broke , at the head of not more than twenty men , stepped from the rail of the waist @-@ hammock netting onto the muzzle of the after @-@ carronade of Chesapeake , and from there he jumped down to her quarterdeck . As the British boarded there were no American officers left on the quarterdeck to organise resistance . 
 The maindeck of Chesapeake was almost deserted , having been swept by Shannon 's gunfire ; the surviving gun crews had either responded to the call for boarders or had taken refuge below . Two American officers , Lieutenant Cox ( who had returned from carrying Captain Lawrence down to the surgeon ) and Midshipman Russell saw that the aftmost 18 @-@ pounders on the port side , still bore on Shannon and working between them managed to fire both . 
 Lieutenant Ludlow , who had been slightly wounded and had gone down to Chesapeake 's cockpit for treatment , now returned to the upper decks , rallying some of the American crew as he did so . Lieutenant Budd joined him with a band of men he had led up the fore @-@ hatch . Ludlow led them in a counter @-@ attack which pushed the British back as far as the binnacle . However , a wave of British reinforcements arrived , Ludlow received a mortal wound from a cutlass , and the Americans were again thrown back . James Bulger , one of Shannon 's Irishmen , charged into the Americans wielding a boarding pike and shouting Gaelic curses - " And then did I not spit them , <unk> ! " Lacking officers to lead them ( Lieutenant Budd had also been wounded by a cutlass ) and lacking support from below , the Americans were driven back by the boarders . American resistance then fell apart , with the exception of a band of men on the forecastle and those in the tops . A number of the Americans driven from the upper decks jostled each other to get down the main hatchway to the comparative safety of the berth deck . Seeing this , Lt. Cox called to them , " You damned cowardly sons of bitches ! What are you jumping below for ? " When asked by a nearby midshipman if he should stop them by cutting a few down , Cox replied , " No sir , it is of no use . " 
 Fighting had also been ongoing between the tops ( platforms at the junction of mast and topmast ) of the ships , as rival sharpshooters fired upon their opponents and upon sailors on the exposed decks below . While the ships were locked together , the British marksmen , led by midshipman William Smith , commander of the fore @-@ top , stormed Chesapeake 's fore @-@ top over the yard @-@ arm and killed all the Americans there . Following this , the wind tore the two ships apart , and Chesapeake was blown around the bows of Shannon . This left the British boarders , about fifty @-@ strong , stranded . However , organised resistance aboard the American ship had almost ceased by this time . 
 Broke himself led a charge against a number of the Americans who had managed to rally on the forecastle . Three American sailors , probably from the rigging , descended and attacked him . Taken by surprise , he killed the first , but the second hit him with a musket which stunned him , whilst the third sliced open his skull with his sabre , knocking him to the deck . Before the sailor could finish Broke off , the American was bayoneted by a British Marine named John Hill . Shannon 's crew rallied to the defence of their captain and carried the forecastle , killing the remaining Americans . Broke sat , <unk> and weak , on a carronade slide , and his head was bound up by William <unk> , who used his own neckerchief . One of Shannon 's lieutenants , Provo Wallis , believed that Broke 's three assailants were probably British deserters . The desperate and violent attempt on Broke 's life made by these men may have been motivated by the fact that they faced the death penalty under the Royal Navy 's Articles of War as deserters . Meanwhile , Shannon 's First Lieutenant , Mr George T. L. Watt , had attempted to hoist the British colours over Chesapeake 's , but this was misinterpreted aboard Shannon , and he was hit in the forehead by grapeshot and killed as he did so . 
 = = = Chesapeake is taken = = = 
 The British had cleared the upper decks of American resistance , and most of Chesapeake 's crew had taken refuge on the berth deck . A musket or pistol shot from the berth deck killed a British marine , William Young , who was guarding the main hatchway . The furious British crewmen then began firing through the hatchway at the Americans crowded below . Lieutenant Charles Leslie Falkiner of Shannon , the leader of the boarders who had rushed the maindeck , restored order by threatening to blow out the brains of the next person to fire . He then demanded that the Americans send up the man who had killed Young , adding that Chesapeake was taken and " We have three hundred men aboard . If there is another act of hostility you will be called up on deck one by one – and shot . " Falkiner was given command of Chesapeake as a British prize @-@ vessel . 
 Shannon 's midshipmen during the action were Messers . Smith , Leake , Clavering , Raymond , Littlejohn and Samwell . Samwell was the only British officer other than Broke to be wounded in the action ; he was to die from an infection of his wounds some weeks later . Mr <unk> was the acting master , and conned the ship into the action . Shortly after Chesapeake had been secured , Broke fainted from loss of blood and was rowed back to Shannon to be attended to by the ship 's surgeon . 
 The engagement had lasted just ten minutes according to Shannon 's log , or eleven minutes by Lieutenant Wallis ' watch . Broke more modestly claimed fifteen minutes in his official despatch . Shannon had lost 23 men killed , and had 56 wounded . Chesapeake had about 48 killed , including four lieutenants , the master and many other of her officers , and 99 wounded . Shannon had been hit by a total of 158 projectiles , Chesapeake by 362 ( these figures include grapeshot ) . In the time the batteries of both ships were firing , the Americans had been exposed to 44 roundshot , whilst the British had received 10 or 11 in reply ( these are figures for shot which would have produced casualties or material damage ; some of Chesapeake 's shot was fired low , bouncing off Shannon 's side at waterline level ) . Even before being boarded , Chesapeake had lost the gunnery duel by a considerable margin . 
 A large cask of un @-@ slaked lime was found open on Chesapeake 's forecastle , and another bag of lime was discovered in the fore @-@ top . British sailors alleged the intention was to throw handfuls into the eyes of Shannon 's men in an unfair and dishonourable manner as they attempted to board , though that was never done by Chesapeake 's crew . Historian Albert Gleaves has called the allegation " absurd , " noting , " Lime is always carried in ship 's stores as a disinfectant , and the fact that it was left on the deck after the ship was cleared for action was probably due to the neglect of a junior , or petty , officer . " 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After the victory , a prize crew was put aboard Chesapeake . The commander of the prize , Lieutenant Falkiner , had a good deal of trouble from the restive Americans , who outnumbered his own men . He had some of the leaders of the unrest transferred to Shannon in the leg @-@ irons that had , ironically , been shipped aboard Chesapeake to deal with expected British prisoners . The rest of the American crew were rendered docile by the expedient of a carpenter cutting scuttles ( holes ) in the maindeck through which two 18 @-@ pounder cannon , loaded with grapeshot , were pointed at them . 
 Shannon , commanded by Lieutenant Provo Wallis , escorted her prize into Halifax , arriving there on 6 June . On the entry of the two frigates into the harbour , the naval ships already at anchor manned their yards , bands played martial music and each ship Shannon passed greeted her with cheers . The 320 American survivors of the battle were interned on Melville Island in 1813 , and their ship , taken into British service and renamed HMS Chesapeake , was used to ferry prisoners from Melville Island to England 's Dartmoor Prison . Many officers were paroled to Halifax , but some began a riot at a performance of a patriotic song about Chesapeake 's defeat . Parole restrictions were tightened : beginning in 1814 , paroled officers were required to attend a monthly muster on Melville Island , and those who violated their parole were confined to the prison . 
 As the first major victory in the naval war for the British , the capture raised the shaken morale of the Royal Navy . After setting out on 5 September for a brief cruise under a Captain <unk> , Shannon departed for England on 4 October , carrying the recovering Broke . They arrived at Portsmouth on 2 November . After the successful action Lieutenants Wallis and Falkiner were promoted to the rank of commander , and Messrs. <unk> and Smith were made lieutenants . Broke was made a Baronet that September . The Court of Common Council of London awarded him the freedom of the city and a sword worth 100 guineas . He also received a piece of plate worth 750 pounds and a cup worth 100 guineas . Captain Lawrence was buried in Halifax with full military honours , six British Naval Officers served as pall bearers . Chesapeake , after active service in the Royal Navy , was eventually sold at Portsmouth , England , for £ 500 in 1819 and broken up . Some of the timbers of Chesapeake were used in the construction of the Chesapeake Mill in Wickham , Hampshire . Shannon was reduced to a receiving ship in 1831 , and broken up in 1859 . 
 In the US , the capture was seen as a humiliation , and contributed to popular sentiment against the war . Many New Englanders , now calling the conflict " Madison 's war " after James Madison , demanded that he resign the presidency . 
 In a war that reached new lows for historical accuracy sacrificed in the name of patriotic fever , accounts of Shannon 's victory would be ascribed to many reasons . Very few of these took into account that Lawrence had rushed into a fight with an untrained and unprepared crew for what awaited him . Theodore Roosevelt would later state this plainly , lambasting former American " history writers " while doing so . In less than 2 minutes Shannon 's crew had taken horrible losses and did not break , while Chesapeake 's crew did . Unfortunately for Lawrence , he did not meet an average British frigate of this point in the long wars , undermanned and with many men aboard who were not real seamen , but a frigate with a crew at the highest pitch of training , led by an expert in naval gunnery . It has been said of Shannon , that " a more destructive vessel of her force had probably never existed in the history of naval warfare " . 
 Broke never again commanded a ship . The head wound from a cutlass blow , which had exposed the brain , had been so severe that it was initially pronounced fatal by the ship 's surgeon . However , Broke survived the wound into moderate old age ( 64 years ) , though he was debilitated . He suffered , to a greater or lesser extent , from headaches and other neurological problems for the rest of his life . The casualties were heavy . The British lost 23 killed and 56 wounded . The Americans lost 48 killed and 99 wounded . Between the wounded of the ships ' two companies , another 23 died of their wounds in the two weeks following the action . Relative to the total number of men participating , this was one of the bloodiest ship @-@ to @-@ ship actions of the age of sail . By comparison , HMS Victory suffered fewer casualties during the whole of the Battle of Trafalgar . The entire action had lasted , at most , for 15 minutes , speaking to the ferocity of the fighting . 
 A sister ship of HMS Shannon has been restored and preserved , HMS Trincomalee of the Leda class ; she can be seen in a dock at Hartlepool in the North East of England and is the oldest British warship afloat .

 = Pacific swift = 
 The Pacific swift ( Apus pacificus ) is a bird which breeds in eastern Asia . This swift is strongly migratory , spending the northern hemisphere 's winter in Southeast Asia and Australia . The general shape and blackish plumage recall its relative , the common swift , from which it is distinguished by a white rump band and heavily marked underparts . The sexes are identical in appearance , although young birds can be identified by pale fringes to the wing feathers that are absent in adults . This swift 's main call is a screech typical of its family . It is one of a group of closely related Asian swifts formerly regarded as one species . 
 The Pacific swift is found in a wide range of climatic zones and habitats . It breeds in sheltered locations such as caves , natural rock crevices or under the roofs of houses . The nest is a half @-@ cup of dry grass and other fine material that is gathered in flight , cemented with saliva and attached to a vertical surface . The two or three white eggs are incubated for about seventeen days to hatching . Subsequently , the chicks have a long but variable period in the nest before they are fully fledged . When the parents cannot find sufficient food in bad weather , the young can survive for days without being fed by metabolising body fat . 
 Like all members of its family , the Pacific swift feeds exclusively on insects caught in flight . It tends to hunt higher than most of its relatives other than the white @-@ throated <unk> . The Pacific swift has a large population and extensive breeding area , and faces few threats from predators or human activities . It is classed as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature . It has occurred as far afield as the US and New Zealand , and it is a very rare vagrant in Europe , where it has been recorded in Denmark , Spain , Sweden and the United Kingdom . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The swifts form the bird family Apodidae , which is divided into several genera . The Pacific swift is in the Old World genus Apus , which is characterised by dark , glossy plumage , a forked tail and sharply pointed wings . Until recently , the Pacific swift was considered to have five subspecies , but three have now been elevated to full species status as part of a " fork @-@ tailed swift " superspecies . The proposed name of the superspecies was formerly a synonym for the Pacific swift . 
 A 2011 study proposed the following treatment . The long @-@ tailed birds from the Tibetan Plateau with a narrow white throat patch are separated as Salim Ali 's swift , A. <unk> , the small swifts with narrow white rumps from the Himalayas of India , Nepal and Bhutan become Blyth 's swift , A. <unk> , and the population that breeds in limestone caves in northern Southeast Asia , characterised by a green iridescence and shallow tail fork , is split as Cook 's swift , A. cooki . The remaining subspecies are the nominate A. p. pacificus and the southern race A. p. kurodae ( which includes the Tibetan population formerly named as <unk> ) . This arrangement has been accepted by the International Ornithological Committee ( IOC ) , but not the International Union for Conservation of Nature . A 2012 paper showed that cooki is closely related to the dark @-@ rumped swift , A. <unk> , which should therefore be included in the pacificus clade , but made no further taxonomic recommendations . 
 This swift was first described by John Latham in 1801 as Hirundo pacifica . Scopoli separated the swifts from the swallows as the genus Apus in 1777 . Apus , like Apodidae , is derived from the Greek <unk> , <unk> , meaning " without feet " , a reference to the small , weak legs of these most aerial of birds , and pacificus refers to the Pacific Ocean . 
 = = Description = = 
 At 17 – 18 cm ( 6 @.@ 7 – 7 @.@ 1 in ) in length , the Pacific swift is the largest of the Apus swifts . It has a 43 – 54 @-@ cm ( 17 – 21 @-@ in ) wingspan . Females are slightly heavier than males , averaging 44 @.@ 5 g ( 1 @.@ 57 oz ) against 42 @.@ 5 g ( 1 @.@ 50 oz ) . It is similar in general shape to the common swift , although slightly longer @-@ winged and with a more protruding head . The fork of the tail is deeper , and the rump is broader . The upperparts are black , apart from a white rump band and a somewhat greyer head . The underparts are black , although white fringes to the feathers gives the belly a scaly appearance when seen well from below . The tail and the upper wings are black , and the underwings are brown . The eyes are brown and the small bill and very short legs are black . The sexes are identically plumaged , and juveniles differ from the adults only in that the feathers show pale fringes , particularly on the wings . The southern subspecies , A. p. kurodae , has a narrower white rump ( 15 mm / 0 @.@ 6 in against the nominate form 's 20 mm / 0 @.@ 8 in ) , a grey throat and blacker underparts . Juveniles of migratory Apus swifts have a partial moult prior to migration , but retain the larger wing feathers . The moult is completed in the wintering grounds , where adults have a complete moult . 
 This species is usually straightforward to identify . The white @-@ rumped swift is similar to Pacific swift , but its slender body and long , deeply forked tail make it appear quite different from its more powerfully built relative . A possible pitfall is a partially leucistic common swift with a white rump . The Pacific swift can be distinguished with care by its deeper tail fork , longer wings , bigger head , larger white throat patch and patterned underparts . In parts of Southeast Asia , migrating Pacific swifts pass through the resident ranges of former subspecies , and good views are then necessary to be sure of correct identification . 
 = = = Voice = = = 
 The calls given by flocks near the breeding areas are typical swift screams , including a trilled <unk> or harsher <unk> @-@ <unk> . They resemble the cries of the common swift , but are softer and less wheezy . Pacific swifts are less vocal on the wintering grounds , but produce a variety of twitters and buzzes . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The nominate subspecies , A. p. pacificus , breeds in eastern Asia from the Ob River northeast to Kamchatka and east to the Kuril Islands , Sakhalin and Japan . It is strongly migratory , wintering in southern Indonesia , Melanesia and Australia , including Tasmania . It is a common migrant through coastal Malaysia , Sumatra and Java with " vast numbers " crossing the Strait of Malacca . Subspecies A. p. kurodae breeds from southeastern Tibet through eastern China to southern Japan , Taiwan and Orchid Island . It is a relatively short @-@ distance migrant , wintering in the Philippines , Malaysia and northern Indonesia . 
 As a powerful long @-@ distance migrant , the nominate subspecies of Pacific swift has occurred as a vagrant far from its normal range . Birds have been recorded from Brunei , the Maldives , New Zealand and Macquarie Island , and there have been multiple occurrences in the Seychelles . In the US , this species is casual in the Pribilof and Aleutian Islands ; a claimed 2010 sighting from the Yukon will be the first for Canada and the mainland of North America if ratified . In South America , there is a 1959 record from Colombia . There are 13 European records as of 2013 , from Denmark ( two ) , Spain , Sweden ( four ) and the UK ( seven ) . It is possible that this overstates the true number of visiting birds . All the listed countries had a sighting on different dates in the summer of 2013 which could be due to a single wandering bird . The four most recent English records in 2005 , 2008 , 2011 and 2013 all included sightings at Spurn , East Yorkshire and may refer to one returning individual . 
 A mainly aerial species , this swift is not limited to particular land habitats or climatic zones ; it breeds from the Arctic to sub @-@ tropical China , and from sea level to at least 3 @,@ 000 m ( 9 @,@ 800 ft ) in Japan . It is often found around human habitation . It tends to winter in lowlands , and in Australia it is found in arid areas as well as in towns and on the coast . Flocks of thousands may appear when there are hot strong winds . Pacific swifts often travel and feed with white @-@ throated <unk> . The Pacific swift probably sleeps in flight when not nesting , behaviour known to occur in the common swift and suspected in other Apus species , but there is an Australian record of these swifts roosting in a tree , and they are occasionally seen to land briefly on the ground or on vertical surfaces . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Most Apus swift species nest in rocky areas , and the majority will accept human habitations as a substitute for natural sites . The Pacific swift is a colonial species which nests in sheltered locations such as caves , crevices in vertical rock faces ( including sea @-@ cliffs ) , or under the eaves of houses . The nest is a half @-@ cup of feathers , dry grass and other light vegetation collected in flight , cemented with saliva and attached to a ledge or vertical surface with the same substance . Two or three eggs is the normal clutch , the number varying with geographical location . In areas where three eggs are usual , a fourth may occasionally be laid ; no larger clutches are known . The eggs are white , as with all swifts , and 24 – 27 @.@ 5 x 16 – 17 mm ( 0 @.@ 95 – 1 @.@ 08 x 0 @.@ 63 – 0 @.@ 67 in ) in size . They are incubated by both parents for about 17 days prior to hatching as unfeathered and blind altricial chicks . Both adults brood and feed the chicks , which fledge in an average 40 @.@ 5 days . 
 Swifts as a family have smaller egg clutches and much longer and more variable incubation and fledging times than passerines with similarly sized eggs , resembling tubenoses in these developmental factors . Young birds reach a maximum weight heavier than their parents ; they can cope with not being fed for long periods of time , and delay their feather growth when undernourished . Swifts and seabirds have generally secure nest sites , but their food sources are unreliable , whereas passerines are vulnerable in the nest but food is usually plentiful . These adaptations mean that when conditions are good , the survival rate is very high . One large Yellow Sea colony had hatching success of 73 @.@ 5 % , with 63 @.@ 6 % of the chicks fledging . The average productivity was 1 @.@ 24 fledged young per pair per year . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 All swifts feed on insects caught in flight , and the Pacific swift has been recorded as consuming bees , wasps , termites , moths and flies . A Chinese study found that it caught a wide variety of insect prey and considered that most of the species eaten were harmful to agriculture or forestry . The Pacific swift tends to hunt higher than sympatric swifts , sharing its airspace mainly with white @-@ throated <unk> . It typically feeds at heights up to 300 m ( 980 ft ) , only flying close to the ground in poor weather . It often forages near low @-@ pressure areas , which serve both to raise insects from the ground and to give the swifts additional lift . The swifts circle through the insect swarms in flocks typically of tens or hundreds of birds , although sometimes reaching tens of thousands in Australia . In Siberia , Pacific swifts feed at dusk to much later hours than the common swift , sometimes until midnight , and migrants have been seen flying with bats in the Philippines . The young are brought balls of insects bound with saliva . In bad weather , they are sometimes not fed for days , surviving on stored body fat . 
 = = Predators and parasites = = 
 Swifts spend most of their time in flight . Few birds have the necessary speed and agility to catch them , hobbies being the main exception . The nest sites are also usually sufficiently inaccessible to be beyond the reach of snakes or mammalian predators . 
 This swift is host to feather mites including <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and C. <unk> . Biting parasites include the louse fly <unk> pacifica , bat bugs and sucking mites . Chewing lice include two species first identified on this swift . <unk> tapeworms have been found as internal parasites . 
 = = Status = = 
 The Pacific swift has a very large range , exceeding 10 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 km2 ( 3 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 mi2 ) . Its population is unknown , although it is common throughout its breeding range with no evidence of any decline . It is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern . There appear to be no significant threats to this bird ; predation is low , and this swift is not tied to a particular habitat . Some birds may die through misadventure or become exhausted when lost on migration ( the first record for the Western Palaearctic was found resting on a North Sea gas platform ) , but swifts have high survival rates and are generally long @-@ lived . The common swift , a close relative of the Pacific swift , has been recorded as reaching 21 years old . 
 = Bernard Bosanquet ( cricketer ) = 
 Bernard James Tindal Bosanquet ( 13 October 1877 – 12 October 1936 ) was an English cricketer best known for inventing the googly , a delivery designed to deceive the batsman . When bowled , it appears to be a leg break , but after pitching the ball turns in the opposite direction to that which is expected , behaving as an off break instead . Bosanquet , who played first @-@ class cricket for Middlesex between 1898 and 1919 , appeared in seven Test matches for England as an all @-@ rounder . He was chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1905 . 
 Bosanquet played cricket for Eton College from 1891 to 1896 , before gaining his Blue at Oriel College , Oxford . He was a moderately successful batsman who bowled at fast @-@ medium pace for Oxford University between 1898 and 1900 . As a student , he made several appearances for Middlesex and achieved a regular place in the county side as an amateur . While playing a tabletop game , Bosanquet devised a new technique for delivering a ball , later named the " googly " , which he practised during his time at Oxford . He first used it in cricket matches around 1900 , abandoning his faster style of bowling , but it was not until 1903 , when he had a successful season with the ball , that his new delivery began to attract attention . Having gone on several minor overseas tours , Bosanquet was selected in 1903 – 04 for the fully representative Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) tour of Australia . During that tour , he made his Test debut for England and although he largely failed as a batsman , he performed well as a bowler and troubled all the opposing batsmen with his googly . 
 More success followed ; in the 1904 season , he took more than 100 wickets and his bowling career peaked when took eight wickets for 107 runs in the first Test against Australia in 1905 to bowl England to victory . However , he never mastered control of good length bowling and remained an erratic performer . After 1905 , Bosanquet 's bowling went into decline ; he practically gave it up and made fewer first @-@ class appearances owing to his business interests . After taking part in the First World War in the Royal Flying Corps , he married and had a son , Reginald Bosanquet , who later became a television newsreader . He died in 1936 , aged 58 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Bosanquet was born in Bulls Cross , Enfield , Middlesex , on 13 October 1877 . He was one of five children of Bernard Tindal Bosanquet and his wife Eva Maude Cotton ; Bosanquet had a younger brother and three sisters . Many of his relations were well known in their fields , including his uncle and namesake Bernard Bosanquet the philosopher . His grandfather , James Whatman Bosanquet , was a banker and achieved distinction as a biblical historian . His father worked for the banking firm Bosanquet & Co . , and became a partner in a firm of hide , leather , and fur brokers in London ; he was also High Sheriff of Middlesex from 1897 to 1898 and captained Enfield cricket club . 
 After going to <unk> School in Slough , Bosanquet attended Eton College between 1891 and 1896 . While at Eton , he received cricket coaching from the Surrey professionals Maurice Read and Bill Brockwell . They improved his play to the point where he played for the cricket first eleven in 1896 . Against Winchester College , he took three wickets and scored 29 not out in the second innings , while at Lord 's Cricket Ground against Harrow School , Bosanquet scored 120 runs in 140 minutes . At this time , he bowled fast @-@ medium pace , while as a batsman he had developed , in the words of his obituary in The Times , " a rather curious , <unk> style ; stiff and yet powerful " . 
 = = Oxford University = = 
 In 1897 , Bosanquet went to Oriel College , Oxford , and although he left in 1900 without completing a degree , he recorded many sporting accomplishments . Making his first @-@ class debut in 1898 for Oxford University against a team selected by Middlesex captain A. J. Webbe , he had little batting success during the season , having a top score of 17 runs . He was more productive with the ball , twice taking five wickets in an innings for Oxford , and was awarded his cricket Blue . Selected for the University Match , he made 54 not out , his highest score of the season . He later made two appearances for Middlesex , but did not distinguish himself , scoring 17 runs and taking no wickets . In all first @-@ class matches in 1898 , Bosanquet scored 168 runs at a batting average of 14 @.@ 00 and took 30 wickets at a bowling average of 18 @.@ 70 . At the end of the season , he joined a team led by Plum Warner which toured America , where he had further success as a bowler . 
 Bosanquet improved his record for Oxford in 1899 , scoring two fifties and taking five wickets on three occasions before the University match . Against Cambridge , he failed with the bat but took seven wickets for 89 runs in the first innings . Bosanquet 's record earned him selection for the Gentlemen against the Players ; in this prestigious match he took only one wicket but scored 61 runs . He played another two matches for Middlesex and ended the season with a batting record of 419 runs in all matches , at an average of 27 @.@ 93 , and 55 wickets at 22 @.@ 72 . He played some end of season non @-@ first @-@ class matches for I Zingari , taking 16 wickets in a game against Ireland , and went on another tour of America , led by K. S. Ranjitsinhji . 
 Bosanquet 's final season for Oxford was his best statistically . He scored his maiden first @-@ class century against London County and , against Sussex , he recorded what were to be the best bowling figures of his career , taking nine for 31 in the second innings and a total of 15 wickets in the game for 65 runs . His final match for Oxford was the 1900 University match , in which he scored 42 and 23 . For the remainder of the season , Bosanquet re @-@ joined Middlesex , and in his second match , against Leicestershire , achieved the rare distinction of a century in each innings : 136 in 110 minutes in the first innings , followed by 139 in 170 minutes in the second . He scored three further fifties for Middlesex and once took five wickets in an innings , but bowled comparatively rarely , only once bowling more than 13 overs in an innings . In all first @-@ class matches in the season , Bosanquet scored 1 @,@ 026 runs at 34 @.@ 20 and took 50 wickets at 23 @.@ 20 . 
 In all his matches for Oxford , Bosanquet scored 801 runs at an average of 25 @.@ 03 and took 112 wickets at an average of 19 @.@ 49 . In other sports , he received half @-@ Blues for hammer @-@ throwing and billiards , and also played ice hockey . 
 = = Developing the googly = = 
 = = = Genesis = = = 
 Bosanquet is remembered as the inventor of the googly , a delivery designed to deceive the batsman . When bowled , it appears to be a leg break , but after pitching the ball turns in the opposite direction to that expected , behaving as an off break instead . However , Bosanquet was a pace bowler in his university days . Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack described his bowling from this period as " very useful ... but that was all , and had he kept to his original style real distinction at cricket would only have come to him through his batting " . Furthermore , he disliked bowling quickly , believing he was destined only to be used as a last resort and that he would have little success as a fast bowler . Consequently , Bosanquet decided to change his style . According to his own account , his inspiration came in the mid @-@ 1890s , from a table @-@ top game he often played called <unk> @-@ <unk> ; the object was to bounce a tennis ball on a table so that it could not be caught by an opposing player . Bosanquet began to experiment with ways of throwing the ball so that , after pitching , it turned and spun in an unexpected direction , without his opponent detecting any difference in the delivery . Finding he could do this successfully , he began to practise using the same method to bowl in a form of soft @-@ ball cricket and then in the cricket nets with a hard ball , but did not at the time take his discovery seriously . It was not until 1899 or 1900 that Bosanquet began to practise in earnest , and developed an orthodox leg break in the nets to complement his new style of delivery , which spun in the same direction as an off break . During the lunch breaks in Oxford matches , he would often bowl to the best opposing batsmen in the nets , delivering several leg breaks , followed by an off break , without changing his bowling action ; the ball would sometimes hit the bemused batsman on the knee , to the amusement of spectators . A slightly different version of events was provided by the son of Louise Bosanquet , Bernard 's cousin , who claimed in 1965 that Bosanquet conceived the idea in 1890 and practised bowling to Louise with a tennis ball from 1893 onwards . 
 Practising throughout 1899 and 1900 , Bosanquet began to use the googly in minor matches before using it in important cricket . His first use of the new delivery in first @-@ class cricket came in the match against Leicestershire in 1900 in which he scored two centuries . In the second innings , Samuel Coe had scored 98 when Bosanquet , still known as a fast @-@ bowler , bowled his off break ; the ball bounced four times and the batsman was stumped ( although , writing in 1925 , Bosanquet recalled Coe had been bowled ) . Bosanquet later wrote that the wicket " was rightly treated as a joke , and was the subject of ribald comment " . Middlesex captains permitted him to try googlies if there was little pressure on , but he later wrote : " Though I could claim some five or six wickets before the close of the season , my efforts produced far more laughter than dismay in the hearts of opposing batsmen " . But Bosanquet persisted with the delivery and soon began to be noticed by influential cricketers who recognised the potential of the googly . Previously , some bowlers occasionally bowled unintended googlies , but were unable to control them . Although batsmen were accustomed to off break or leg break bowlers , it was an unprecedented problem to face a bowler who could bowl both types of delivery at will , disguising which one he bowled . Bosanquet persuaded team @-@ mates to remain silent as he wished to maintain the impression that his off break was an accident so that batsmen were not expecting it . He further tried to play down his successes : he feigned surprise , acting as if they were similarly accidental . 
 It was around 1903 that Bosanquet 's delivery first became known as a " googly " . Pelham Warner claimed that the first use of the word was in the Lyttelton Times , a newspaper based in Canterbury , New Zealand , during a 1902 – 03 tour , but subsequent research has failed to find it . There were later suggestions that other cricketers invented the googly before Bosanquet . In 1935 , Jack Hobbs wrote that Kingsmill Key , a former captain of Surrey , told him that the googly was invented by an Oxford student , Herbert Page , in the 1880s . Key claimed that Page bowled the delivery regularly , but never used it in a first @-@ class match .

 Apart from some early season games for MCC and A. J. Webbe 's XI , all of Bosanquet 's cricket in 1901 was for Middlesex . He maintained his faster style of bowling but also began to bowl slow leg breaks , with the as @-@ yet unrecognised googly mixed in as variation . Later , he found he could not effectively maintain both styles and decided to concentrate on spin , gradually dropping his quick bowling . His bowling brought him 36 wickets at an average of 37 @.@ 52 in 1901 but did not take more than three wickets in a single innings . With the bat , it took until July for him to pass fifty runs in an innings but his form improved in August with four fifties . He ended the season with consecutive centuries against Surrey and Essex . In total , Bosanquet scored 1 @,@ 240 runs at an average of 32 @.@ 63 , and Warner regarded him as one of the three most reliable batsmen in the Middlesex side . After the season , Bosanquet went on his third tour of America , captaining a team himself . From January to April 1902 , he toured the West Indies with Richard Bennett 's team . He scored 623 runs at an average of 34 @.@ 61 with five fifties and 55 wickets at an average of 15 @.@ 47 , including figures of eight for 30 in one innings . Bosanquet 's cricket followed a similar pattern in 1902 . He scored 749 runs at an average of 24 @.@ 96 , with a century against Cambridge . However , he did not pass fifty after the end of May until his last game of the season . With the ball , he took 40 wickets at an average of 21 @.@ 17 . These included 10 wickets against Oxford and 10 against Nottinghamshire ; the latter performance , when he took seven for 57 in the second innings was described as remarkable by Wisden . It was the first time that his new bowling style attracted attention , although Bosanquet himself tried to play down the success for fear of alerting batsmen to his googly . 
 = = = Controversy in New Zealand = = = 
 In the winter of 1902 – 03 , Bosanquet took part in another tour , this time with Lord Hawke 's team which played matches in New Zealand and Australia and was captained by Warner . In New Zealand , he played two matches against a New Zealand representative side , and in all matches scored 148 runs at an average of 18 @.@ 50 with one fifty , an innings of 82 against South Island . He also took 18 wickets at an average of 22 @.@ 61 ; his style of bowling attracted a great deal of attention . However , the tour was more notable for an incident in the match against Canterbury . Bosanquet had taken an early wicket in the first innings , but bowled poorly afterwards . He was the fourth bowler used in the second innings and with his third ball , it looked as if he had bowled Walter Pearce behind his legs as he attempted a big hit . However , both umpires were unsighted and the non @-@ striker Arthur Sims , who also had his view obscured , urged Pearce not to leave the middle . The tourists ' wicket @-@ keeper , Arthur Whatman , Bosanquet and other English players surrounded the umpire , who decided Pearce was not out . Bosanquet then turned to Sims and said : " You 're a nice cheat . I bowled him round his legs . Anybody could see that . " Sims responded that there was reasonable doubt , but Whatman began to swear and call him a cheat . Bosanquet later bowled Sims and Canterbury were easily defeated . However , the incident continued to attract attention . The English team were severely criticised in the press and Sims ' employers refused to release him for any further matches unless Bosanquet apologised . Bosanquet wrote letters of apology to Sims and to the Canterbury Cricket Association , and Sims later told him to forget about it , but Sims ' employers would not let him take part in the remaining games . 
 The tour moved to Australia and Bosanquet scored fifties against the three states which Hawke 's team played , accumulating 168 runs at an average of 33 @.@ 60 . As a bowler , he took eight wickets at 42 @.@ 75 . His best bowling performance was to take six for 153 out of a New South Wales total of 463 . This included the wicket of Victor Trumper , the leading Australian batsman and one of the best in the world at the time . Bosanquet delivered two conventional leg breaks followed by a googly , later described by Bosanquet as the first bowled in Australia , which bowled Trumper . Many critics were impressed by the wicket @-@ taking potential of googly bowling on hard pitches , and Warner later described Bosanquet 's bowling as causing a sensation .

 In the English 1903 season , Bosanquet 's batting record improved . He scored a century against Oxford in the second match of the season , followed by six for 31 in Oxford 's second innings . He went on to score nine fifties , including three in successive innings , in an aggregate of 1 @,@ 082 runs at an average of 34 @.@ 90 . With the ball , he recorded his best wicket haul in a season , taking 63 wickets at an average of 21 @.@ 00 . While this was not seen as a particularly impressive record , Wisden noted that " the batsmen who played against him came to the conclusion that he had immense possibilities . " Critics recognised that Bosanquet had developed a new style of bowling . While he could not always control the place the ball would land , making him erratic , several cricketers including Warner believed if he could gain more control , he would become one of the best bowlers in the world . Although his bowling was still developing , he took six wickets in consecutive innings against Surrey and Kent , going on to take 10 wickets in the latter match . He also took 12 wickets in a match for Warner 's team against a touring side , the Gentlemen of Philadelphia . Bosanquet 's contributions helped Middlesex to win the County Championship for the first time . Although no Test matches were played that season , Warner believed that Bosanquet 's form would have gained him a place in a representative side . For the first time since 1899 , he was selected for the Gentlemen against the Players , although he was unsuccessful . 
 Bosanquet 's performances during the season earned him a place on Warner 's team for the first tour of Australia by the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) , which was to include Test matches . Warner later wrote that he was accused of selecting Bosanquet out of favouritism as they played on the same county team , and received " a hail of criticism and disapprobation " as a result . Before the tour began , Sussex and England batsman C. B. Fry wrote an open letter to Warner in the Daily Express , stating Warner " must persuade that Bosanquet of yours to practise , practise , practise those funny ' googlies ' of his till he is automatically certain of his length . That leg @-@ break of his which breaks from the off might win a test match ! " 
 = = = MCC tour of Australia = = = 
 Bosanquet was one of the few bowlers in the MCC team not to have some success in the opening two matches of the tour , although he impressed Warner . In addition , he scored 79 runs with the bat in the second game . The third match of the tour was against New South Wales ; Bosanquet took four for 60 , and his googly caused many problems , particularly for Australia 's opening batsman Reggie Duff . He continuously defeated the batsmen , maintaining his length effectively through the innings . By this stage of the tour , Warner believed that Bosanquet was potentially the best bowler in a strong attack if he could bowl a good length , particularly on hard , fast pitches which normally would favour the batsmen . However , <unk> 's bowling form remained erratic ; in a minor match against a weak side , the opposing captain made a joke about his team 's bowling being no worse than Bosanquet 's . 
 Bosanquet played in the first Test against Australia , making his Test debut for England . Australia batted first and recovered from a poor start to score 285 runs ; Bosanquet took the wickets of Warwick Armstrong and Syd Gregory with googlies to finish with two for 52 in 13 overs . He scored a single run when he batted , out of an English total of 577 . In the second innings he bowled 23 overs and took one for 100 . The English bowlers came under heavy punishment from the Australian batsmen ; Victor Trumper scored an unbeaten 185 and the team reached 485 . Bosanquet had Monty Noble stumped , and Warner later wrote that he was in good form with the ball , beating Trumper with a googly and troubling others . England needed to score 194 to win and Bosanquet came to the wicket with 13 needed to win ; he scored one run before the winning hit was made . A hand injury forced Bosanquet to miss the second Test . However , with England 2 – 0 up in the series , he returned for the third Test . On a very good pitch for batting , Bosanquet took three for 95 in an Australian innings of 388 , and none of the batsmen were comfortable batting against his googly . When England replied , Bosanquet was out for 10 runs , hitting a poor shot as his team were bowled out for 245 . In Australia 's second innings , Bosanquet bowled badly at first , delivering full tosses and long hops at the end of the third day 's play . Next morning , his bowling improved as he established a good length , delivering a spell of seven overs in which he took four wickets for 23 runs , again causing confusion with his googly . He finished the innings with figures of four for 73 . However , he failed again with the bat , scoring 10 runs in his second innings as England fell to a heavy defeat . 
 There followed a break in the series of almost a month as the MCC team played more state teams . In the match against Tasmania , Bosanquet scored 35 and an unbeaten 124 which included eighteen fours and five hits over the boundary . However , his bowling was poor ; Warner wrote that Bosanquet " bowled abominably " . Against New South Wales , a team the tourists regarded as the biggest challenge outside of the Test matches , <unk> was very successful . In the first innings , he scored 54 runs in 65 minutes , then took two for 51 with the ball . When the MCC batted again , he played an innings which Warner called the best of his career . Unbeaten on 17 at the start of the third day , Bosanquet scored 97 runs in 65 minutes before being dismissed for 114 . Bosanquet followed this with figures of six for 45 , including two wickets bowled by the googly . 
 The fourth Test proved to be the crucial game of the series . England scored 249 , of which Bosanquet made 12 before falling to the final ball of the first day , and Australia replied with 131 . Bosanquet was required to bowl only two overs . He failed again in the second innings , scoring seven but England reached 210 . Australia required 329 to win , which was considered possible on a good pitch ; Warner recorded that Australia 's batsmen believed their team to be favourites . Bosanquet came on to bowl shortly before the tea interval and immediately took the wickets of Clem Hill and Syd Gregory . He went on to take another four wickets , at one point having taken five wickets for 12 runs , to complete figures of six for 51 . England won by 157 runs to ensure they could not lose the series , being 3 – 1 up with one game remaining . Australia recorded a consolation victory in favourable conditions for the bowlers in the final Test , and Bosanquet scored 20 runs in the match and bowled four overs without taking a wicket . In the final match of the tour , Bosanquet scored 22 and took three for 70 in the first innings , one wicket coming when the batsman gave a catch to the wicketkeeper from a wide ball which bounced three times . 
 In all first @-@ class matches on the tour , Bosanquet scored 587 runs at an average of 36 @.@ 68 and took 37 wickets at an average of 27 @.@ 27 . In Test matches , he took 16 wickets at an average of 25 @.@ 18 and scored 62 runs at an average of 8 @.@ 85 with a top @-@ score of 16 . Following the team 's return home , Bosanquet wrote an article giving his impressions of the tour for Wisden . The main Wisden report stated : " Bosanquet 's value with the ball cannot be judged from the averages , as on his bad days he is , as everyone knows , one of the most expensive of living bowlers . When he was in form the Australians thought him far more difficult on hard wickets than any of the other bowlers , Clement Hill saying , without any qualification , that his presence in the eleven won the rubber . " 
 = = = 1904 season = = = 
 The 1904 season was Bosanquet 's best with bat and ball . Although he made a slow start batting , failing to reach double figures in six of his first nine innings , he was immediately successful with the ball . He took nine for 107 for MCC against the touring South African team and seven for 83 for I Zingari against Gentlemen of England , going on to take 11 wickets in the latter match . Then for Middlesex , he scored 110 in 85 minutes with 16 fours , in a tied match against the South Africans , and 126 in two hours against Surrey including a five and 16 fours . In the latter match he also took five for 139 . This preceded his selection for two Gentlemen v Players matches in six days . In the first at Lord 's , he scored nine and 22 and took four wickets in the match . At the Oval , he hit 145 in 210 minutes with two fives and 15 fours . After taking two for 97 in the Players ' first innings , he took six for 60 in the second to give the Gentlemen their second victory in a week . In a loss to Lancashire , the eventual 1904 County Championship winners , Bosanquet took six for 99 for Middlesex and in a drawn game against Yorkshire , who finished second in the table , he scored 141 and took 10 for 248 . Immediately following the Yorkshire game , Bosanquet took 12 for 240 in a defeat of Nottinghamshire . After a quiet time in the return game against Lancashire , Bosanquet had a run of three consecutive successful matches . In the first , he took six for 75 against Surrey . In a close victory over Kent , he took five for 23 and eight wickets in the match after scoring 80 runs , and he achieved figures of 14 for 190 in a win against Sussex . In an end of season festival game , Bosanquet took five for 89 for the South against the North . In all first @-@ class matches , Bosanquet achieved the double of 1 @,@ 000 runs and 100 wickets : he scored 1 @,@ 405 runs at an average of 36 @.@ 02 and took 132 wickets at an average of 21 @.@ 62 , the only time in his career he passed 100 wickets in a season . He accumulated five fifties and four centuries ; with the ball he took 10 or more wickets in four matches and had 14 five wicket hauls . 
 His performance in 1904 earned him selection as one of Wisden 's Cricketers of the Year ; the citation noted he was more likely that any other bowler to dismiss a strong side on a good batting wicket , and no batsmen had deciphered how he bowled the googly . However , it also remarked that " he sends down more bad balls than any other front rank bowler . " 
 = = = 1905 season = = = 
 The Australians toured England in 1905 , but Bosanquet played only three games before the first Test . He scored 93 against Nottinghamshire , while against Sussex , he scored centuries in each innings for the second time in his career . His first innings century took 105 minutes and his second took 75 minutes . He also took eight for 53 in the second innings to bowl Middlesex to victory and give him 11 wickets in the game . He became the first player in first @-@ class cricket to score two centuries and take 10 wickets in the same match ; only two further players have since achieved the feat , as of 2015 . Bosanquet was selected for the opening Test match , his first such appearance in England . In England 's first innings , he assisted in a recovery , making his highest Test score of 27 . Australia took a first innings lead , but despite a failure by Bosanquet , England scored 426 for five declared in their second innings . Australia were set 402 to win , which was considered unlikely in the time available so the tourists had to bat until the end of the game to achieve a draw . The pitch remained good for batting and Australia reached 62 without losing a wicket . Subsequently , Bosanquet took five quick wickets , including a good catch from his own bowling to dismiss Hill , to reduce Australia to 100 for five . Although the tourists managed a partial recovery , Bosanquet continued to take wickets . With very little time remaining owing to poor light — if play had stopped , Australia would have achieved a draw — he took the last wicket to fall , giving England a 213 @-@ run victory . Bosanquet had taken his best Test figures of eight for 107 . Wisden reported : " The Englishmen owed everything to Bosanquet ... He gained nothing from the condition of the ground , the pitch remaining firm and true to the end . " 
 After two county matches in which he did little with bat or ball , Bosanquet played in the second Test . However , in his two innings , he scored only six and four not out , and did not bowl in the only innings . After taking 11 wickets for Middlesex against Kent in the only match he played between the Tests , in the third match of the series , Bosanquet scored 20 and 22 not out and took one wicket in the match . This was his final appearance of the series as he was dropped for the final two Tests . Wisden reported that " Bosanquet was a complete disappointment " . The almanack also commented in the report on the first Test : " In the first flush of his triumph his place in the England team seemed secure for the whole season , but he never reproduced his form , and dropped out of the eleven after the match at Leeds . " This was his final Test . In seven matches for England he scored 147 runs at an average of 13 @.@ 36 and took 25 wickets at 24 @.@ 16 . 
 In the remainder of the season , Bosanquet never took more than three wickets in an innings , although he scored a century against Essex and three other fifties . He played for the Gentlemen against the Players scoring 38 and 19 but did not take a wicket in the 17 overs he bowled . In 20 first @-@ class matches , Bosanquet scored 1 @,@ 198 runs ( average 37 @.@ 43 ) and took 63 wickets ( average 27 @.@ 77 ) . After this season , he rarely bowled and later stated that he did not bowl the googly after 1905 , particularly after one embarrassing attempt to do so in a match at Harrow . In another eight seasons of first @-@ class cricket , he took only 22 wickets . However , his batting seemed to improve in this time . 
 = = Later career = = 
 After 1905 , Bosanquet played fewer first @-@ class matches owing to his business career , and appeared as a batsman rather than an all @-@ rounder . He played rarely for Middlesex , but usually seemed to make runs despite his lack of practice . He played four matches in 1906 . He scored 87 and 101 for Middlesex against Somerset in his first game and took five for 51 against Yorkshire in his second . His good form continued in his third match for Middlesex as he scored two fifties against Essex and he was chosen for the Gentlemen against the Players . Although he did not bowl in that match , he scored 56 in the first innings . In total , he scored 415 runs at 51 @.@ 87 and took eight wickets at 46 @.@ 00 . The following season , he played six matches for Middlesex , took two wickets and scored 358 runs at 35 @.@ 00 with three fifties . Bosanquet played more often in 1908 . He made 1 @,@ 081 runs at an average of 54 @.@ 05 , topping the first @-@ class batting averages . He scored centuries for Middlesex against Somerset and Lancashire in addition to five fifties . He represented the Gentlemen v Players twice — at Lord 's and in an end of season festival game — without reaching fifty . However , in two other festival games in September , Bosanquet scored a fifty for the South against the North and scored 214 , the highest score of his career , for the Rest of England against Yorkshire , the County Champions . In the season , he also took 12 wickets at an average of 29 @.@ 00 , although only bowling more than 10 overs in an innings three times , the final wickets of his career . 
 Bosanquet did not appear in first @-@ class cricket again until 1911 when he played two matches in the Scarborough Festival at the end of the season . During the first game , he scored a century in 75 minutes for the Gentlemen against the Players , who had an attack including Sydney Barnes . In 1912 , he played for Middlesex against the Australians but did not bat or bowl , before appearing in three festival games in August and September . He played twice in 1913 , hitting two fifties for L. Robinson 's XI against Cambridge University and scoring a third fifty in a match at the end of the season , while in 1914 he appeared for Middlesex against Hampshire in Frank Tarrant ’ s benefit match and for L. Robinson 's XI against Oxford University . After the First World War , Bosanquet made seven appearances in the 1919 season , six of them for Middlesex , scoring three fifties in an aggregate of 335 runs ( average 27 @.@ 91 ) . He did not appear again in first @-@ class cricket . He ended his career with 11 @,@ 696 runs at an average of 33 @.@ 41 with 21 centuries . With the ball , he took 629 wickets at an average of 23 @.@ 80 . He continued to be successful in a good class of club cricket and in matches at country houses . His son later recalled how he " drifted from one country @-@ house party to the next , tipping the butler on Monday morning , before travelling to his next social @-@ cum @-@ sporting invitation . " 
 = = Style and technique = = 
 After he became a leg break bowler , Bosanquet bowled the ball very slowly and did not look dangerous . However , while still appearing to bowl a leg break , he could deliver an off break which confused the best batsmen in the world and this googly was recognised as a completely new style of delivery . He achieved this through dropping his wrist before releasing the ball . The unfamiliarity of this type of bowling increased his effectiveness on the occasions when he could bowl a good length . But he was never a reliable bowler ; on other occasions , he bowled long hops and full tosses giving away easy runs . Warner noted that Bosanquet had been " described as the ' worst best bowler ' in the world " . 
 Bosanquet did not bat in a style typical of a cricketer from Eton , where batsmen were taught to play with style and grace . Warner described him as " decidedly stiff and awkward looking ... He does not seem to play the ball in a free , unconstrained way , but rather stabs at it and gives one the impression of making his stroke at the very last moment . " In Australia , Bosanquet was troubled by fast pitches and struggled against bowlers such as Monty Noble and Bert Hopkins who could make the ball move towards him through the air . Nevertheless , he displayed great confidence in his ability and on a pitch which assisted spinners , he could flick the ball onto the leg side very effectively . He could hit the ball hard , particularly when driving . The Times said : " He had a wonderful eye and great strength of fore @-@ arm and anything short he could hit very hard . " 
 = = Personal life and legacy = = 
 In the First World War , Bosanquet was a lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps . On 5 April 1924 , he married Mary Janet Kennedy @-@ Jones , the daughter of a Member of Parliament . They had one child , Reginald , who later achieved fame as a television newsreader . When his father died , Bosanquet sold the family home in Middlesex and moved to <unk> Farm , Surrey , where he died on 12 October 1936 . He left an estate valued at £ 2 @,@ 276 0s . 4d . 
 As the googly caused a sensation following its invention , many other cricketers tried to emulate Bosanquet . Reggie Schwarz , the South African cricketer who played for Middlesex , learned how to bowl the googly through observation of Bosanquet ; Schwarz in turn passed it on to the South African bowlers Aubrey Faulkner , Bert Vogler and Gordon White . These four raised the bowling of the googly to a high standard and raised fears of the detrimental effect it would have on batting . Following the development of googly bowling by South Africans , it was further refined by English and Australian cricketers until it became firmly established . In later years , the googly was blamed for a deterioration in the quality and attractiveness of batting . Bosanquet refused to accept any blame and published a defence in The Morning Post during 1924 , later reprinted in Wisden , which humorously downplayed the impact of the googly . He wrote : " It is not for me to defend it . Other and more capable hands have taken it up and exploited it , and , if blame is to be allotted , let it be on their shoulders . For me is the task of the historian , and if I appear too much in the role of the proud parent , I ask forgiveness . " 
 Until the invention of the googly , bowling was expected to be predictable , and the googly may initially have been considered an underhand tactic . On one occasion , Nottinghamshire batsman William Gunn was stumped after running down the pitch in an attempt to stop a ball bowled by Bosanquet . Gunn 's team @-@ mate Arthur Shrewsbury then protested that Bosanquet 's bowling was unfair . On another occasion , when asked if the googly was illegal , Bosanquet is said to have replied , " Oh no , only immoral . " For many years , the googly was known in Australia as a " Bosie " . His Times obituary stated , " No man probably has in his time had so important and lasting an influence on the game of cricket " . 
 = Russian battleship Imperator Aleksandr II = 
 Imperator Aleksandr II ( Russian : Император Александр II ) was a battleship built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1880s . She was an artillery training ship assigned to the Baltic Fleet by the time of the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1905 and was not sent to the Pacific as was most of the rest of the Baltic Fleet . She was inactive at Kronstadt during World War I , but her crew was active in the revolutionary movement . She was turned over to the Kronstadt port authority on 21 April 1921 before she was sold for scrap on 22 August 1922 . She was towed to Germany during the autumn of 1922 , but was not stricken from the Navy List until 21 November 1925 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Imperator Aleksandr II was named after the Emperor Alexander II of Russia . She was built by the New Admiralty Yard at Saint Petersburg . She was laid down in June 1885 , launched in July 1887 , and completed in June 1891 , although her trials lasted until the spring of 1892 . 
 She was 334 feet ( 101 @.@ 8 m ) long at the waterline and 346 feet 6 inches ( 105 @.@ 6 m ) long overall . She had a beam of 66 feet 11 inches ( 20 @.@ 40 m ) and a draft of 25 feet 9 inches ( 7 @.@ 85 m ) . She displaced 9 @,@ 244 long tons ( 9 @,@ 392 t ) at load , over 800 long tons ( 813 t ) more than her designed displacement of 8 @,@ 440 long tons ( 8 @,@ 575 t ) . 
 Imperator Aleksandr II had two three @-@ cylinder vertical compound steam engines driving 17 @-@ foot ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) screw propellers . Twelve cylindrical boilers provided steam to the engines . Her engines were built by Baltic Works and had a total designed output of 8 @,@ 500 indicated horsepower ( 6 @,@ 338 kW ) . On trials , the powerplant produced 8 @,@ 289 ihp ( 6 @,@ 181 kW ) , and a top speed of 15 @.@ 27 knots ( 28 @.@ 28 km / h ; 17 @.@ 57 mph ) . She carried 967 long tons ( 983 t ) of coal that provided a range of 4 @,@ 400 nautical miles ( 8 @,@ 100 km ) at a speed of 8 knots ( 15 km / h ; 9 @.@ 2 mph ) and 1 @,@ 770 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 280 km ) at a speed of 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . 
 The main armament of the Imperator Aleksandr II @-@ class ships was a pair of 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) Obukhov Model 1877 30 @-@ calibre guns mounted in a twin barbette mount forward . The four 9 @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) Obukhov Model 1877 35 @-@ calibre guns were on center @-@ pivot mounts in casemates at the corners of the citadel , the hull being recessed to increase their arcs of fire ahead or behind . The eight 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) Model 1877 35 @-@ calibre guns were mounted on broadside pivot mounts . Four were fitted between the 9 @-@ inch guns and could traverse a total of 100 ° . The others were mounted at each end of the ship where they could fire directly ahead or astern . The ten 47 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) Hotchkiss revolving cannon were mounted in hull embrasures of the ship , between the nine and six @-@ inch guns to defend against torpedo boats . Four 37 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss revolving cannon were mounted in each fighting top . Imperator Aleksandr II carried five above @-@ water 15 @-@ inch ( 381 mm ) torpedo tubes . Two in the bow , one on each side of the <unk> , one tube on each broadside and a tube in the stern . Smaller 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) torpedo tubes could be mounted in four of the ship 's cutters . 36 mines could also be carried .

 Imperator Aleksandr II served in the Baltic Fleet and represented Russia , along with the cruiser Rurik , at the opening of the Kiel Canal in June 1895 . She ran aground in Vyborg Bay later that year , but sustained little damage . She joined the Mediterranean Squadron in August 1896 and supported Russian interests during the Cretan Revolt of 1897 . She returned to Kronstadt in September 1901 . She was reboilered in December 1903 and modified in 1904 to serve as an artillery school ship . Her crew refused to suppress the mutinous garrison of Fort Konstantin defending Kronstadt in August 1906 . She was assigned to the Artillery Training Detachment in 1907 . She spent most of World War I in Kronstadt where her crew was active in the revolutionary movement . She was renamed Zarya <unk> ( <unk> <unk> — Dawn of Freedom ) in May 1917 . She was turned over to the Kronstadt port authority on 21 April 1921 before she was sold for scrap on 22 August 1922 . She was towed to Germany during the autumn of 1922 , but was not stricken from the Navy List until 21 November 1925 . 
 Conway 's says that she was reconstructed in France between 1902 and 1904 , with her torpedo tubes removed and her six and nine @-@ inch guns exchanged for five 8 @-@ inch ( 200 mm ) 45 calibre guns and eight six @-@ inch 45 calibre guns . Her revolver cannon were also exchanged for ten three @-@ pounder guns . <unk> confirms that the torpedo tubes were removed and says that she had her nine @-@ inch guns replaced by five 8 @-@ inch , the fifth being placed at the stern , the old six @-@ inch guns were exchanged for newer , more powerful models , and four 47 @-@ mm and four 120 @-@ mm guns were added on the upper deck , presumably replacing the old revolver cannon . 
 = Namib Desert Horse = 
 The Namib Desert Horse is a rare feral horse found in the Namib Desert of Namibia , Africa . It is probably the only feral herd of horses residing in Africa , with a population ranging between 90 and 150 . The Namib Desert Horse is athletic in appearance , resembling the European light riding horses from which it probably descends , and usually dark in color . Despite the harsh environment in which they live , the horses are generally in good condition , except during times of extreme drought . The horses have been the subject of several population studies , which have given significant insight into their population dynamics and ability to survive in desert conditions . 
 The origin of the Namib Desert Horse is unclear , though several theories have been put forward . Genetic tests have been performed , although none to date have completely verified their origin . The most likely ancestors of the horses are a mix of riding horses and cavalry horses , many from German breeding programs , released from various farms and camps in the early 20th century , especially during World War I. Whatever their origin , the horses eventually congregated in the Garub Plains , near Aus , Namibia , the location of a man @-@ made water source . They were generally ignored by humans , except for the periodic threat of eradication due to the possibility that they were destroying native herbivore habitat , until the 1980s . In 1984 , the first aerial survey of the population was made , and in 1986 , their traditional grazing land was incorporated into the Namib @-@ Naukluft Park . At several points , some horses have been removed from the herd , including the removal and sale of over one @-@ third of the population in 1992 . Since the early 1990s , close records of the population have been kept , and studies have been performed to determine the horses ' effect on their environment . Despite being considered an exotic species within the park , they are allowed to remain due to their ties to the country 's history and draw as a tourist attraction . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 The most common color of the Namib Desert Horse is bay , although there are a few chestnut and brown horses . The gene for gray does not occur in the breed . There are many individuals with dorsal striping but no zebra stripes . No other colors have been recorded . The Namib Desert Horses are athletic , muscular , clean @-@ limbed , and strong boned . They are short @-@ backed with oblique shoulders and good withers . The horses have the appearance of well @-@ bred riding horses in head , skin , and coat . Overall , they have good conformation , with few deformities . Club hooves are occasionally seen in foals , likely due to trauma to the hoof while traveling long distances . 
 Scientists studying the horses rate their body condition on a scale of one ( excellent ) to five ( very poor ) , based mainly on estimated weight and muscle tone . The horses tend to remain in above average condition , despite the harsh environment in which they live , with stallions generally averaging better condition then mares . During severe droughts , the average body score decreases , but even then horses are found with moderate body scores and the entire population is never in very poor condition . The condition of the horses is directly correlated to rainfall , through a correlation to available forage , though temperature , distance between forage and water and individual energy expenditures also play a role . Studies during the 1990s found no evidence of equine disease among the population and few external parasites . Investigations of carcasses found four internal nematode parasites present ( <unk> , small and large <unk> and <unk> ) , as well as the larvae of <unk> . 
 = = = Behavior and ecology = = = 
 The home range of the Namib Desert Horse reaches north in the Namib Desert to the <unk> River , usually dry , and west to the Great Escarpment . Bands of horses range together , consisting of as few as two animals , although there are generally more . In observations between 1993 and 2003 , between six and eleven bands were identified , including a mixture of bachelor herds , breeding groups and co @-@ operating stallion groups ( groups with more than one stallion that share breeding duties ) . The Namib Desert Horse travels extensively , searching for food , water and shelter from the climate and insects . A 1994 study found that they have an average home range of 13 square miles ( 34 km2 ) , although not all of that is traversed each day . They must cover considerable distances , as much as 15 to 20 kilometres ( 9 to 12 mi ) between the few existing water sources and the best grazing sources . This creates severe selection pressure and removes weak animals from the population . 
 Due to scarcity of water , the Namib Desert Horse sometimes goes without water for as long as thirty hours in summer and has been known to go close to 72 hours without water during the winter , significantly longer than most horses , even other feral herds . A 1991 study suggested that in 75 years of genetic isolation and water scarcity the population had developed physiological mechanisms which improved their ability to conserve water . In 1993 , a second study showed that the physiological water @-@ conservation ability did not differ between Namib Desert Horses and other populations when dehydrated for periods of up to 60 hours , but suggested that the Namib Desert Horse would show improved conservation ability when dehydration periods were extended to upwards of 72 hours , a common occurrence in their feral state . 
 The horses , especially young foals and juveniles , provide a major food source in the southern Namib Desert for the spotted hyena , along with gemsbok and springbok . However , the availability of other food appears to have a significant influence on predation rates among the horses . Leopards and black @-@ backed jackals also predate young horses , although this is more rare . The harsh environmental conditions in which they live are the main driver of mortality among the Namib Desert Horse , as they cause dehydration , malnutrition , exhaustion and lameness . Other large plains animals , including the mountain zebra , may have once sporadically utilized the area for grazing during periods of excess rainfall , but human interference ( including fencing off portions of land and hunting ) have eliminated or significantly reduced the movement of these animals in the area . The endangered Hartmann 's mountain zebra does exist in the Naukluft Mountain Zebra Park portion of the Namib @-@ Naukluft Park , but their range does not intersect with that of the Namib Desert Horse . 
 = = = Genetics = = = 
 Genetic testing results published in 2001 indicated that Namib Desert Horses are one of the most isolated horse populations in the world , with the second @-@ lowest genetic variation of all horse populations that have been studied to date . In part , this is due to their small founding population , and generally small modern population , made smaller during periods of drought . Despite the large domesticated breeding population from which the horses originally descended , at least one genetic bottleneck has occurred in the breed 's history , resulting in a significant decline in genetic variation over a relatively short period of time . Although an ideal minimum population size for genetic variability would be around 200 horses , the current range cannot support this population given the average rainfall . Estimates for a necessary minimum population to maintain genetic effectiveness range between 100 and 150 animals . 
 The 2001 testing showed the Namib Desert Horse to be part of the Oriental horse grouping , genetically closest to the Arabian horse , although even this association was distant . They were closer to the Arabian than to the three South African breeds tested , the <unk> pony , the Boer pony and the Basuto pony . As the genetic similarity to Arabian @-@ type horses is distant , they do not closely resemble them in outward appearance , although they are both of the " hot blooded " type , resulting in both being athletic , lean @-@ muscled animals . Further , in blood typing studies done in the 1990s , a new variant was noted . Its absence from the blood samples of all other horse breeds indicates the presence of a mutation that probably occurred after the horses became established in the desert . 
 = = History = = 
 Southern Africa has no native horse populations , so the origins of the Namib Desert Horse trace to imported herds of horses . There are several theories on the ancestors of the Namib Desert Horse , and the true story may never be known . One theory says that a cargo ship carrying Thoroughbreds to Australia wrecked near the Orange River , and the strongest horses swam ashore and traveled to the Garub Plains , the home of the Namib Desert Horse , near Aus , Namibia . Another theory states that they descend from Cape horse / Basuto pony crosses ridden by Khoikhoi raiders traveling from southern Africa to north of the Orange River . The most likely theory has the Namib Desert Horse descending from a combination of escaped South African military horses and Namibian @-@ bred German horses . During World War I , horses were used in campaigns in Namibia between the German Schutztruppe and South African troops , and some escaped or were released into the desert . Prior to this time , a German Baron von Wolf built <unk> Castle on the edge of the Namib Desert , where he held a herd of approximately 300 horses . Von Wolf was killed in action in Europe during World War I , and his farm was abandoned , leaving his horses on unfenced land relatively close to the area where the Namib Desert Horses now roam . The Namib Desert Horse phenotypically more closely resembles the horses bred by von Wolf and ridden by the World War I @-@ era troops than the horses ridden by Khoikhoi tribesmen , making the former story the more likely . The genetic evidence of the 2001 study gave less credence to the descent from von Wolf 's horses . He used Thoroughbreds , <unk> and <unk> in his breeding program , rather than the Arabian horse to which the Namib Desert Horses are the most genetically similar . 
 Research in the archives of pre @-@ 1914 horse breeding operations found at Windhoek , combined with blood typing studies , suggests that the animals descended from a gene pool of high @-@ quality riding animals , as opposed to work horses . A study released in 2005 reinforces the theory of the Namib Desert Horse descending from a combination of European @-@ descended breeding stock and escaped military horses . One possible source of breeding stock was a stud farm near <unk> , leased by Emil <unk> ( previously mayor of Lüderitz ) from 1911 to 1919 . Photo albums from the stud show animals with conformation and markings similar to those seen in the modern Namib Desert Horse . In addition , in early 1915 , during the fighting of World War I , bombs were dropped by a German aircraft onto the South African camp near Garub . Some ordnance seems to have been specifically targeted to land among a herd of 1 @,@ 700 grazing horses , for the purposes of scattering them . These escaped army animals may have joined stock animals lost from <unk> 's stud farm during the turmoil of the war . Horses in the area would likely have congregated at the few existing watering places in the Aus Mountains and Garub . 
 = = = 1970s to present = = = 
 The Namib Desert Horses were originally forced to compete with domesticated livestock turned loose by farmers onto the same ground where the horses grazed . Due in part to this competition for limited forage , the horses nearly became extinct . However , they were saved in part due to the efforts of Jan Coetzer , employee of Consolidated Diamond Mine ( CDM or <unk> ) , mining in part of <unk> . Garub was a station for the re @-@ filling of steam locomotives until 1977 , when diesel locomotives took over the route . The horses , who had previously survived on water pumped for the locomotives , were placed in danger when the pumping stopped , with several horses dying of dehydration . Coetzer petitioned CDM to supply the horses with water , which they did in 1980 , installing holding tanks and a water trough . Between 1964 and 1984 , population estimates ranged between 50 and 200 horses , but generally averaged 140 to 160 . In 1984 , an aerial count was made that distinguished 168 horses , while ground @-@ based observations in 1988 estimated between 150 and 200 animals . 
 In the mid @-@ 1980s , the horses ' habitat was made part of Namib @-@ Naukluft Park , the largest game reserve in Africa . In 1986 , after the expansion to the park , a movement was made to remove all horses ( which were considered an exotic species ) ; public outcry prevented this from happening . The following year , 10 horses were removed from the park for research purposes and 8 others for use as patrol horses in Etosha National Park , although they were unsuccessful in the latter use . In 1992 , as Namibia gained its independence and a drought enveloped southern Africa , a decision was made to reduce the population , then estimated at 276 animals . In June , 104 animals were captured <unk> and sold , but many did not adjust well to their new habitats and by 1997 at least half had died . In 1997 , with the feral population at 149 horses , 35 horses , selected for age , gender and degree of genetic relationship , were removed , with the intent being to sell them at auction . The horses were kept in holding pens for six weeks , during which time the stallions became very aggressive and had to be separated ; after this , the auction was cancelled and the horses released back to their range . Beginning in December 1993 , semiannual population counts have been completed . Between 1993 and 2005 , herd numbers ranged between 89 and 149 animals , with the 1999 – 2001 counts providing sub @-@ 100 population numbers . Although several attempts were originally made to exterminate the horses , due to a possible threat to oryx habitat , they are now protected by the South West Africa / Namibia Directorate of Nature Conservation . The Namib Desert Horse is likely the only herd of feral horses in Africa . 
 There is concern in some quarters that the horses are a negative influence on their habitat , through overgrazing and competition with native species . While exotic species , such as the Namib Desert Horse , are generally unwanted in the Namib @-@ Naukluft Park , the horses are a special case , given their close ties with Namibian history , their popularity with visitors , and their appeal as subjects for case studies of feral horse bands . Studies during 2003 and 2004 , however , found that while an area of approximately 100 metres ( 330 ft ) around the watering area at Garub has been affected by the horses , there was no significant disturbance of the area outside this radius . The amount and species of vegetation found outside the watering area appear more affected by rainfall then by the horses , probably due to the low population density and natural rotational grazing . Due to the lack of affect on vegetation by horses , it is unlikely that they significantly influence small mammal populations . The horses also appear to have no measurable affect on any vulnerable or endangered plant or animal species , which in several cases are more threatened by human influence . As the horses are restricted to a certain grazing area and native large herbivores are not , the horses do not pose a danger to the latter species . The horses in the Namib Desert were originally known by the local population as " ghost horses " , as they mostly stayed away from human habitations and were rarely seen . However , when their grazing grounds were made part of the game reserve , a policy of limited intervention was put in place that encouraged support to be given to the horses when necessary , bringing the horses into closer contact with humans . This also included closer contact with tourists to Namibia , who frequently see them at the watering area at Garub and near the main road that traverses their grazing grounds . While the horses are credited with bringing tourist dollars to Namibia , there are also concerns about negative horse @-@ human interactions , including vehicle accidents , disruption to sensitive areas by people looking for the horses and disruption of herd dynamics due to becoming too used to or dependent upon humans . 
 = Neil Harvey = 
 Robert Neil Harvey MBE ( born 8 October 1928 ) is a former Australian cricketer who represented the Australian cricket team between 1948 and 1963 , playing in 79 Test matches . He was the vice @-@ captain of the team from 1957 until his retirement . An attacking left @-@ handed batsman , sharp fielder and occasional off @-@ spin bowler , Harvey was the senior batsman in the Australian team for much of the 1950s and was regarded by Wisden as the finest fielder of his era . Upon his retirement , Harvey was the second @-@ most prolific Test run @-@ scorer and century @-@ maker for Australia . 
 One of six cricketing brothers , four of whom represented Victoria , Harvey followed his elder brother Merv into Test cricket and made his debut in January 1948 , aged 19 and three months . In his second match , he became the youngest Australian to score a Test century , a record that still stands . Harvey was the youngest member of the 1948 Invincibles of Don Bradman to tour England , regarded as one of the finest teams in history . After initially struggling in English conditions , he made a century on his Ashes debut . Harvey started his career strongly , with six centuries in his first thirteen Test innings at an average over 100 , including four in 1949 – 50 against South Africa , including a match @-@ winning 151 not out on a sticky wicket . As Bradman 's team broke up in the 1950s due to retirements , Harvey became Australia 's senior batsman , and was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1954 , in recognition of his feat in scoring more than 2 @,@ 000 runs during the 1953 tour of England . 
 In 1957 he was passed over for the captaincy and was named as the deputy of Ian Craig , who had played just six matches , as Australia sought to rebuild the team with a youth policy following a decline in the team . Craig later offered to demote himself due to poor form , but Harvey prevented him from doing so . Craig fell ill the following season , but Harvey moved interstate and Richie Benaud was promoted to the captaincy ahead of him . Harvey continued in the deputy 's role until the end of his career , and was captain for only one Test match . In the Second Test at Lord 's in 1961 , when Benaud was injured , Harvey led the team in the " Battle of the Ridge " on an erratic surface , grinding out a hard fought victory . Only Bradman had scored more runs and centuries for Australia at the time of Harvey 's retirement . Harvey was best known for his extravagant footwork and flamboyant stroke play , as well as his fielding . Harvey was particularly known for his innings in conditions unfavourable to batting , performing when his colleagues struggled , such as his 151 not out in Durban , his 92 not out in Sydney in 1954 – 55 and his 96 on the matting in Dhaka . In retirement , he became a national selector for twelve years but in recent times is best known for his strident criticism of modern cricket . In 2000 , he was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in and selected in the Australian Cricket Board 's Team of the Century . In 2009 , Harvey was one of the 55 inaugural inductees into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Harvey was the fifth of six boys born to Horace Harvey . Despite his small build , Harvey was born large , weighing in at 4 @.@ 5 kilograms ( 10 lb ) . The family lived in Broken Hill , where Horace was a miner , before moving to Sydney , and finally to Melbourne in 1926 , where they settled in the inner northern industrial suburb of Fitzroy . There the six boys were taught cricket under the guidance of their father . In conditions conducive to producing batsmen rather than bowlers , they played cricket using a tennis ball on cobblestones or a marble rebounding from the backyard pavement . The boys went to George Street State School and Falconer Street Central School . Cricket and cricket talk was an integral part of the daily family life . Horace held the family batting record with 198 for Broken Hill , and continued to play in Melbourne club cricket . Harvey 's eldest brother Merv went on to play one Test for Australia , while Mick and Ray both played for Victoria . All six brothers , the other two being Brian and Harold also played for Fitzroy in district cricket . Except for Harold , all five represented Victoria in baseball . 
 Harvey played his first game aged nine as a wicket @-@ keeper in the North Fitzroy Central School team , the average age of which was 14 . In a school final , he once made 112 of the total of 140 . Aged twelve , he joined the local Fitzroy club and rose to the first grade team when he was fourteen . By this stage he had transferred to Collingwood Technical School . On the advice of the Victorian coach , Arthur Liddicut , Harvey stopped wicket @-@ keeping to focus on his batting . Joe Plant another Fitzroy veteran also gave advice on batting . Both Liddicut and Plant identified Harvey 's potential as a batsman . " What they liked about him was his modesty , his eagerness to pick up every point in the game , and his willingness to listen to the old hands . " Briefly playing for Fitzroy Football Club , Harvey gave up the sport and played baseball during winter . After leaving school , Harvey worked as an apprentice fitter and turner for the Melbourne City Council . The apprenticeship was supposed to take three years , but it eventually took six years because Harvey 's cricket career caused frequent absences . 
 First @-@ class cricket had been cancelled during World War II and resumed in 1945 – 46 . At the start of the season , Harvey was selected for a trial match . The Victorian state team played against the Rest of Victoria , and Harvey represented the latter . However , he made a duck in his only innings and was not selected for the senior state side during the season . 
 An aggressive 113 for Fitzroy against Melbourne Cricket Club in 1946 – 47 saw Harvey selected for the Victorian team at the age of 18 . He made 18 in his only innings during his first @-@ class debut against Tasmania . In the next match against Tasmania , Harvey made his maiden first @-@ class century , scoring 154 . He said that his effort was inspired by elder brother Merv , who gained Test selection in the same year . 
 At the time , Tasmania was not part of Sheffield Shield , and Harvey made his Shield debut against New South Wales . He was dismissed without scoring in the first innings before making 49 in the second innings in an emphatic 298 @-@ run win over their arch @-@ rivals . Victoria went on to win the title convincingly . 
 His next match for Victoria was against Wally Hammond 's English tourists . After the fall of three early wickets , Harvey joined captain Lindsay Hassett . He dominated a partnership of 120 , making 69 in his second match against the <unk> leg spin of Doug Wright . His opponents had no doubt that he would become a Test player . English wicket @-@ keeper Godfrey Evans congratulated him by proclaiming " We 'll be seeing you in England next year [ for Australia 's 1948 tour of that country ] " . He ended his debut first @-@ class season with 304 runs at 50 @.@ 66 . 
 = = Test debut = = 
 In 1947 – 48 , Harvey played in two Shield matches with his brothers Merv and Ray . Merv had already gained Test selection , but soon Neil was attracting more attention . In the opening match of the season , Harvey struck 87 against the touring Indian cricket team . He was selected for an Australian XI , which played the Indians before the Tests in what was effectively a dress rehearsal . He made 32 in the first innings and was unbeaten on 56 in the second as the hosts succumbed for 203 and suffered a 47 @-@ run loss . Despite this , he was initially overlooked for the Tests . He reached 35 in each of his next five innings for Victoria , including two fifties . 
 Three months after his 19th birthday , Harvey made his entry into international cricket , in the last two Tests against India . He batted at No. 6 and made 13 in his only innings on debut in the Fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval as Australia swept to an innings victory . The selectors retained him for the Fifth Test on his home ground at Melbourne . After reaching stumps on 78 , he reached his century the following day , 7 February 1948 . His score of 153 after being promoted to No. 5 made him the youngest Australian Test centurion , surpassing Archie Jackson 's previous record . He brought up the mark with an all run five , having turned a short ball from Lala Amarnath towards the square leg boundary . 
 The innings in replacing Bradman was taken to be symbolism of the fact that Harvey had been tipped to become Australia 's leading batsman . His innings laid the foundation of a that secured Australia another innings victory and a 4 – 0 series triumph . It was only his 13th match at first @-@ class level . 
 The innings ensured him a place on the 1948 tour of England . Speaking about Harvey 's selection , Bradman opined " He has the brilliance and daring of youth , and the likelihood of rapid improvement . " In the warm @-@ up matches before the team headed to England , Harvey struck 104 against Tasmania and 79 against Western Australia . He had scored 733 runs at 52 @.@ 36 for the season . 
 Australia traditionally fielded its first @-@ choice team in the tour opener , which was customarily against Worcestershire . Despite scoring a century in Australia 's most recent Test , Harvey was made 12th man and it appeared that he was not initially in Bradman 's Test plans . 
 At first , Harvey struggled in the English conditions , failing to pass 25 in his first six innings . His most notable contribution in the early stages of the campaign was against Yorkshire in Bradford , on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling . The match saw 324 runs fall for 36 wickets . No sooner had Harvey walked out to bat , stand @-@ in captain Lindsay Hassett was caught to leave Australia at 5 / 20 in pursuit of 60 . To make matters worse , Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat , so Australia were effectively six wickets down and faced its first loss to an English county since 1912 . Harvey had scored a solitary run when he hit a ball to Len Hutton at short leg , who dived forwards and grabbed it with both hands before dropping it . Harvey then swept the next ball for a boundary . Colin McCool was out at 6 / 31 before Harvey and wicket @-@ keeper Don Tallon steadied Australia . Harvey was reprieved on 12 ; he charged the bowling but the wicketkeeper fumbled the stumping opportunity . Harvey then hit the winning runs with a six over the sightscreen , ending unbeaten on 18 not out . It was the closest Australia had come to defeat for the whole tour . 
 Due to his weak performances in the opening matches , Harvey was omitted for the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord 's . The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests , and were basically a full strength Test team , while Australia fielded their first @-@ choice team and went on to win by an innings . The omission signified that Harvey was on the outer with regards to Test selection . 
 After asking Bradman about his difficulties , Harvey was told that these were caused by rash shot selection and a tendency to hit the ball in the air . Bradman said " He was technically perfect in his shot production . He was batting well enough and simply getting out early . " 
 Harvey adapted his style and improved his performance . He scored 36 and 76 not out against Lancashire at Manchester and an unbeaten 100 at Hove against Sussex in only 115 minutes in the last match before the First Test . Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton described Harvey 's innings as " a superb century , rich in youthful daring and stroke production " . However , this was not enough for selection and reserve opener Bill Brown batted out of position in the middle @-@ order , as he had done against Worcestershire and the MCC . Harvey was the 12th man because of his fielding abilities , and spent a large proportion of time on the field due to an injury to pace spearhead Ray Lindwall . 
 During the first two Tests , Brown struggled in his unfamiliar role , and he was dropped for the third . During the Third Test , opener Sid Barnes was injured , opening a vacancy for the Fourth Test at Headingley . 
 Harvey forced his way into the team with a scoring sequence of 49 , 56 , 43 , 73 * and 95 . After Harvey hit 49 and 56 against Yorkshire , Fingleton opined that he " probably gained the respect of this most discerning crowd more quickly than any other cricketer in recent years " . Harvey then scored 43 and 73 against Surrey and had taken a catch amongst a flock of pigeons . Australia wanted to finish the run @-@ chase quickly so they could watch the Australian John Bromwich play in the Wimbledon tennis final . Harvey volunteered to play as a makeshift opener and promised Bradman that he would reach the target quickly . Australia chased down the target of 122 in just 58 minutes and 20 @.@ 1 overs . Harvey ended unbeaten on 73 and the Australians arrived at Wimbledon on time . He then added 95 against Gloucestershire , attacking the off spin of Tom Goddard . 
 After England had amassed 496 in the first innings , Australia had slumped to 3 / 68 with Bradman one of the dismissed batsmen . Harvey , the youngest member of the squad , joined cavalier all @-@ rounder Keith Miller . Australia were more than 400 behind and if England were to remove the pair , they would expose Australia 's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to take a large first innings lead . Upon arriving in the middle , Miller greeted him cheerfully and said to Harvey , " OK , mate , get up the other end . I 'll take the bowling for a while until you get yourself organised . " Harvey said , " Mate , that will do me . " I couldn 't get up the other end quick enough . I watched him play a few overs and I thought , " This is good " , and then they brought Laker on to bowl . The third and the fifth balls of Laker 's over disappeared over my head , on the way up , and they both finished in the crowd for six . . . . I can honestly thank Keith Miller for the confidence he gave me during our partnership . . . and it did so much for my future cricket career . " 
 The pair launched a counterattack , with Miller taking the lead and shielding Harvey from Jim Laker , as the young batsman was struggling against the off breaks that were turning away from him . Miller then hit a series of boundaries against Laker . This allowed Australia to seize the initiative , with Harvey joined the counterattack during the next over , hitting consecutive boundaries against Laker , the second of which almost cleared the playing area . By the time Miller was out for 58 , the partnership had yielded 121 runs in 90 minutes , and was likened by Wisden to a " hurricane " . Fingleton said that he had never " known a more enjoyable hour " of " delectable cricket " . 
 Loxton came in at 4 / 189 to join Harvey , who continued to attack the bowling , unperturbed by Miller 's demise . Australia went to lunch on the third day at 4 / 204 , with Harvey on 70 . 
 After lunch , Harvey accelerated after the second new ball was taken , and 80 minutes into the middle session , reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250 . Harvey 's knock had taken 177 minutes and included 14 fours . The partnership yielded 105 in only 95 minutes . Harvey was eventually out for 112 from 183 balls , bowled by Laker while playing a cross @-@ batted sweep . His shot selection prompted Bradman to throw his head back in disappointment . Harvey ended as the first Australian left @-@ hander to score a century on his Ashes debut , in an innings noted for powerful driving on both sides of the wicket . The innings and the high rate of scoring helped to swing the match into a balanced position when Australia were finally dismissed for 458 . In the second innings , Harvey took two noted catches , including one where he bent over to catch the ball at ankle height while running . Fingleton said that it " was the catch of the season — or , indeed , would have been had Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at The Oval [ against Surrey ] " . 
 On the final after noon , Harvey was at the crease and got off the mark by hitting the winning boundary in the second innings as Australia successfully completed a Test world record run chase of 3 / 404 in less than one day . He had only one more innings in the series , scoring 17 in the Fifth and final Test at The Oval where Australia won by an innings . Harvey added centuries in consecutive matches after the Tests against Somerset and the South of England . In the entire first @-@ class tour , he scored four centuries to aggregate 1129 runs at 53 @.@ 76 . Harvey was an acrobatic fielder , regarded as the best in the Australian team . Fingleton said that Harvey was " by far the most brilliant fieldsman of both sides , who was to save many runs in the field " . He was twelfth man in the early Tests because of his fielding and he took several acclaimed catches throughout the tour .

 No international matches were scheduled for the 1948 – 49 Australian season , and Harvey had a disappointing first @-@ class season , scoring only 539 runs at 33 @.@ 68 . He scored 72 and 75 in Victoria 's totals of 165 and 197 as they lost to arch @-@ rivals New South Wales by 88 runs , but his only other score beyond 50 was an 87 for Lindsay Hassett 's XI in a Test trial at the end of the season . Nevertheless , the selectors persisted with him for the 1949 – 50 tour of South Africa . 
 Harvey was forced to shoulder more responsibility in the batting order now that Bradman had retired and Sid Barnes took an extended break . The youngest player in the team , Harvey rose to the challenge by establishing several Australian records . His Test figures of 660 at 132 @.@ 00 was the most runs on a Test tour of South Africa by a visiting batsman , surpassing Len Hutton 's previous mark by 83 runs , as were his 1 @,@ 526 first @-@ class runs at 76 @.@ 30 and eight centuries on tour . His eight first @-@ class centuries on one South African tour equalled the efforts of Denis Compton , Len Hutton and Arthur Morris . 
 Harvey started the tour well and was highly productive in seven first @-@ class matches leading into the Tests . He scored 100 and 145 not out against North Eastern Transvaal and Orange Free State . There were two matches against a South African XI that were effectively dress rehearsals for the Tests . In the first , Harvey made 34 in an innings victory . He then made an even 100 in the second match , a week before the First Test . He had scored 480 runs at 60 @.@ 00 in the matches leading up to the Tests . 
 After scoring 34 in the First Test at Johannesburg , Harvey amassed 178 in the first innings of the Second Test at Cape Town , which set up a first innings lead of 248 runs . He then scored 23 not out to guide Australia to an eight @-@ wicket victory in the second innings . This was followed by an unbeaten 151 in five and a half hours at Durban , regarded as one of his finest Test innings . Having been dismissed for 75 on a wet wicket in the first innings , Australia had slumped to 3 / 59 in pursuit of a victory target of 336 . On a crumbling , sticky pitch , the Australians were having extreme difficulty with the spin of Hugh Tayfield and faced their first Test defeat against South Africa for 39 years . Despite a few square cuts , Harvey adapted his game to play a patient innings , prompting heckling from spectators for the first time in his career . On 40 , a ball from <unk> Mann broke through his defence and Harvey thought himself bowled , only to see that the ball had <unk> for byes . However , Mann and Tayfield began to tire in the heat and Harvey began to score more quickly , reaching 50 in 137 minutes by the lunch break . He registered his slowest ever century on his way to guiding his team to an improbable victory by five wickets . Harvey brought up the winning runs by clipping a ball from Mann to the midwicket boundary . 
 Harvey continued his productive sequence in the Fourth Test in Johannesburg , scoring an unbeaten 56 and 100 in a drawn match . It was the first Test in which Harvey had played that Australia did not win . After scoring 100 not out against Griqualand West , Harvey finished the series with 116 in the Fifth Test at Port Elizabeth , as Australia won by an innings and took the series 4 – 0 . He had amassed four centuries in consecutive Tests in the series and had scored six in his first nine Tests , totally 959 runs at 106 @.@ 55 . Harvey 's fast scoring made him a crowd favourite and marketing drawcard in South Africa . When Harvey was rested for a tour match in East London , media complaints prompted Australian selectors to reverse their decision . He finished the season with 55 in an Australian total of 55 before the tourists dismissed a South African XI for 49 and 90 to complete an innings victory . 
 Harvey 's triple figure average from his first two Test seasons could not be maintained when Australia hosted the 1950 – 51 Ashes series . Following his success in South Africa , Harvey played regularly at either the No. 3 or No. 4 from that point onwards . He managed 362 runs at 40 @.@ 22 with three half centuries as Australia took the series 4 – 1 . Harvey had trouble with Alec Bedser 's in @-@ swingers in the early part of the series and Bedser was the only Englishman to dismiss Harvey in the first three Tests . On the first day of the series , Harvey top @-@ scored with 74 out of Australia 's 228 . It turned out to be crucial as rain created a sticky wicket ; England made 7 / 68 and Australia 7 / 32 , both declared . Australia went on to win by 70 runs . The Second Test in Melbourne was also low scoring ; Harvey made 42 and 31 as Australia won after neither team passed 200 . He performed steadily through the series , with 39 , 43 and 68 in the next two Tests , which were both won . He then made one and 52 in the Fifth Test defeat ; it was the first in his 14 Tests and Australia 's first since World War II and came on his home ground in Melbourne . Outside the Tests , Harvey scored 141 in a win over South Australia and then added 146 in the second innings of a match against New South Wales to stave off defeat . He ended the season with 1099 runs at 45 @.@ 79 . 
 The 1951 – 52 season was less productive , with the West Indies touring Australia . Playing in all five Tests , Harvey scored 261 runs at 26 @.@ 10 with one half century as Australia won 4 – 1 . Harvey had difficulties in dealing with the dual spin bowling combination of Alf Valentine and Sonny Ramadhin , who bowled left arm orthodox and leg spin respectively and accounted for him six times in the Tests . His only fifty was an 83 in the first innings of the Fourth Test in Melbourne . Australia went on to complete a dramatic one @-@ wicket victory . Harvey had a poor season overall , scoring only 551 first @-@ class runs at 32 @.@ 41 without managing a single century . 
 = = Peak years = = 
 Harvey started the 1952 – 53 season without a first @-@ class century in more than 18 months and in three matches ahead of the Tests , suffered two defeats and was still yet to break his drought . 
 Having failed to score a century in ten Tests and almost three years , the season saw Harvey at his productive best as South Africa , whom he had scored four centuries against three years earlier , toured Australia . On a slow pitch difficult for stroke play , and Harvey scored 109 and 52 in Brisbane where Australia grounded out a victory in the First Test . He top @-@ scored in the first innings and was the second top @-@ score ( run out ) in the second . 
 Such was his performance in the series that his scores of 11 and 60 in the Second Test , top @-@ scoring in the second innings , were his worst , as Australia lost their first Test to South Africa for 42 years . 
 He then top @-@ scored with 190 in the Third Test in Sydney to set up a large first innings lead of 270 and an innings victory . Harvey alone made more than his opponents in the first innings and the innings saw him complete 1000 Test runs against the South Africans in only eight Tests . Harvey made it consecutive centuries in as many matches , with 84 and 116 in Adelaide . Starting with an on @-@ driven boundary off the first ball of the last day 's play , Harvey 's century took 106 minutes and was the fastest record in the Australia since World War II and the sixth fastest of all time in Australia . With leading pacemen Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller breaking down in the match , Harvey bowled for only the third time in his Test career . He took his first of three wickets at Test level , that of Russell Endean as a depleted Australian attack could not defeat the visitors who finished seven wickets down . 
 As the series 2 – 1 in Australia 's favour and not yet won , the Fifth Test in Melbourne was a timeless Test . Harvey compiled his third consecutive century and highest Test score of 205 as Australia amassed 520 in the first innings . This put Australia in control of the Test , despite South Africa successfully chasing an unlikely target of 295 . Harvey accumulated 834 Test runs at 92 @.@ 66 in the series . This surpassed Bradman 's aggregate of 806 runs in 1931 – 32 as a series record against South Africa . In ten Tests against South Africa , he had eight centuries , totalling 1494 runs at an average of 106 @.@ 71 . 
 Harvey totalled 1 @,@ 659 runs at 63 @.@ 81 for the season , the second highest tally for a season in Australian history , just 31 runs behind Bradman 's record . In the last four matches of the season , he scored 95 , 148 , 49 , 81 and 48 to come within striking distance . In the last match of the season , Western Australian captain Wally Langdon declared early on the last afternoon to allow Harvey another innings so he could break the record . However , Harvey muttered " I wouldn 't want to break a record that way " and managed only 13 . 
 In 1953 he became only the third Australian in a quarter of a century to score 2 @,@ 000 runs on an Ashes tour . Bradman ( three times ) and Stan McCabe were the others . He made 2 @,@ 040 at 65 @.@ 80 and his ten centuries were twice that of the next best in the side . 
 Harvey started the first @-@ class campaign with an unbeaten 202 against Leicestershire , setting up an innings victory . After reaching 25 in each of the next four innings without converting any starts into a score beyond 66 , Harvey rectified this in the two weeks before the Tests started . 
 He struck 109 against the Minor Counties , 103 against Lancashire , 82 and 137 not out against Sussex and 109 against Hampshire . His 109 against Minor Counties was only nine less than the entire opposition managed in two innings , and he had scored 540 runs in four completed innings in 14 days . 
 Harvey was not at his best in the five Tests . In the 11 innings leading up to the Tests , Harvey 's lowest score was 14 , and he had only failed to pass 30 twice . However , in the First Test at Trent Bridge , Harvey had a duck and two and falling twice to Bedser as Australia hung on for a draw in a rain @-@ affected contest . After scoring 69 against Yorkshire , Harvey made 59 and 21 in the Second Test at Lord 's , again falling to Bedser in both innings . Some tenacious batting in the second innings saw the hosts save the match with three wickets in hand . 
 Harvey returned to form by striking 141 against Gloucestershire before taking 3 / 9 , his first three @-@ wicket haul at first @-@ class level , to help Australia take a nine @-@ wicket win . He added a second century in as many innings with 118 in an innings win over Northamptonshire . Harvey then struck 122 in the rain affected Third Test at Manchester ; he helped Australia take a 42 @-@ run first innings lead , but was out for a duck in the second innings . Australia collapsed to 8 / 35 and were saved from defeat by the rain , which meant that less than 14 hours of play was possible . 
 Harvey then returned to Headingley , the venue of his famous innings five years earlier . In a low @-@ scoring match , he top @-@ scored for the entire match with 71 in the first innings as Australia took a 99 @-@ run lead . The tourists looked set for victory and retention of The Ashes at the start of the final day , but time @-@ wasting and defiant defence from the English batsmen left Australia a target of 177 in the last two hours . This would have required a scoring rate much higher than in the first four days of the match . Harvey quickly scored 34 at a run a minute , and Australia had made 111 in 75 minutes and were on schedule for a win . At that point , English medium @-@ pacer Trevor Bailey began bowling with the wicket @-@ keeper more than two metres down the leg side to deny the Australians an opportunity to hit the ball , but the umpires did not penalise them as wides . The match ended in a draw , and Harvey described Bailey 's tactics as " absolutely disgusting " . English wicket @-@ keeper Godfrey Evans said that the tourists " were absolutely livid " and he sympathised with them , saying that " they were right " in claiming that Bailey 's bowling was " the worst kind of negative cricket " and that he had " cheated [ them ] of victory " . 
 With the series locked at 0 – 0 , the fate of The Ashes would be determined in the Fifth and final Test at The Oval . In the lead @-@ up , Harvey scored 113 and 180 in consecutive innings against Surrey and Glamorgan , before failing to pass single figures in his next three innings before the deciding match . 
 Harvey made 36 as Australia made 275 batting first . England then took a 31 @-@ run lead and Harvey was out for only one in the second innings as the hosts won the Ashes 1 – 0 after 19 years in Australian hands . Harvey scored 346 runs at 34 @.@ 60 for the series ; in a low @-@ scoring series , this placed him second behind captain Lindsay Hassett ( 365 runs at 36 @.@ 50 ) . Harvey failed to pass 41 in the four first @-@ class matches remaining after the Tests . With the retirement Hassett at the end of the season , Harvey was to bear more responsibility in the batting line @-@ up . In recognition of his performances during the summer , during which he scored 2040 runs at 65 @.@ 40 , he was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year . The next highest Australian aggregate and average was 1433 at 51 @.@ 17 by Miller , and the second most prolific <unk> was Hassett with five . 
 Harvey returned to Australia and played in the 1953 – 54 season , which was purely domestic . He scored 639 runs at 42 @.@ 60 , including a century against New South Wales and four fifties . He had a few near @-@ misses during the season ; he scored 97 against Queensland in two matches and made 88 against South Australia . 
 The 1954 – 55 season saw England tour Australia , and Harvey scored 98 in three innings in warm @-@ up matches against the visitors . He struck 162 in the First Test in Brisbane after Australia were sent in , helping to compile 8 / 601 to set up an innings victory . Between Tests , he scored 59 and 34 not out for Victoria against the Englishmen . 
 This was followed by a low scoring Second Test in Sydney when Australia were 4 / 77 needing 223 to win on a poor wicket against the lethal pace of Frank Tyson and Brian Statham . The express Tyson was bowling with the help of tailwind and the slips cordon were over 50 m behind the bat . Harvey stood firm while Tyson scattered the stumps of his partners , and he farmed the strike ruthlessly , protecting the tailenders and counter @-@ attacking the England fast bowlers , relying on the cut shot and clipping anything on his pads through the leg side . Schoolboys watching the game leaned over the fence to beckon the boundaries towards them . Last man Bill Johnston came in at 9 / 145 with 78 runs still required , but protected by Harvey he only had to face 16 balls in 40 minutes and they almost produced an unlikely Australian victory . Harvey continued to attack the bowling , and he hooked Tyson over fine leg 's head for four . Together , Harvey and Johnston they had added 39 for the last wicket and halved the runs required . At this point , the Australian pair were confident . Harvey and Johnston felt that Tyson was about to run out of energy , and that their prospects would improve when Hutton would have been forced to change bowlers in the near future . However , it was not enough and England won by 38 runs when Johnston gloved a Tyson delivery down the leg side to the wicket @-@ keeper . Harvey had played what many observers thought was the greatest innings of his life , a defiant , unbeaten 92 , exactly half of the Australian innings of 184 in which no other batsmen reached 15 . 
 From there on , Harvey 's series was unproductive , failing to pass 31 in the six innings of the final three Tests . Australia 's form slumped along with that of Harvey , losing the next two Tests and the series 3 – 1 . Harvey ended with 354 runs at 44 @.@ 25 for the series . Despite this , he continued to productive in the other first @-@ class matches and was by far the most productive batsman in the 1954 – 55 Australian season , accumulating 1100 at 47 @.@ 83 runs ahead of Les Favell 's 663 . He scored a pair of 62s in a 36 @-@ run win over New South Wales , 95 and 66 against Queensland and 82 and 47 in a match for a Tasmania Combined XI against England . 
 This was followed by a tour in early 1955 to the West Indies , the first by an Australian team . Harvey began with two consecutive centuries , scoring exactly 133 in both the First and Second Tests at Kingston and Port @-@ of @-@ Spain respectively . The matches ended in an innings victory and draw to Australia respectively . In a low scoring match in Georgetown , Harvey scored 38 and 41 * as Australia took a 2 – 0 lead . Another half century in the drawn Fourth Test followed , before Harvey scored the second double century of his career , 204 in the Fifth Test in Kingston in just over seven hours of batting . His 295 run partnership with Colin McDonald was the foundation of a Test total of 8 / 758 , setting up an innings victory for Australia . He totalled 650 runs at 108 @.@ 33 for the series . For the entire tour , he scored 789 runs at 71 @.@ 73 . After the tour Arthur Morris retired , leaving Harvey as the most experienced batsman of the team . Harvey had also expunged his demons that he experienced against Ramadhin and Valentine in the previous series . Of the spin duo , only Ramadhin was able to dismiss Harvey on one occasion . 
 The 1955 – 56 Australian summer was another purely domestic season . Harvey had a successful campaign with 772 runs 55 @.@ 14 . He struck 128 and 76 against a New South Wales team composed mainly of Test players , but Victoria 's arch @-@ rivals hung on for a draw with three wickets in hand . He added two further centuries and a 96 , and all of these innings came in the span of a month in which he amassed 612 runs . 
 = = Struggles in 1956 = = 
 The 1956 Ashes tour to England was a disappointment for Harvey individually as well for the Australians collectively . It was an English summer dominated by off spinner Jim Laker and his Surrey teammate Tony Lock , who repeatedly dismantled the tourists on dusty spinning pitches specifically tailored to their cater for them . 
 The tour started poorly for Harvey . In five innings in the first three weeks , he scored only 36 runs at 7 @.@ 20 , and this included a ten @-@ wicket defeat at the hands of Laker and Lock 's Surrey . It was Australia 's first loss to a county side since 1912 . Harvey began to run into some form after that , scoring 45 against Cambridge University before the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) , which fielded a virtual England Test team in what was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests . Harvey made 225 in Australia 's 413 and the hosts made 9 / 203 to draw the match . However , he was unable to replicate this form in the Tests . 
 In the First Test at Nottingham Harvey scored 64 and three in a rain @-@ affected draw . He then made a duck and ten as Australia took the series lead in the Second Test at Lord 's . Despite Australia 's success , Harvey was having an extended run @-@ drought ; he had made only 23 runs in three weeks . 
 Then came the two Australian capitulations against Laker and Lock in the Tests . Harvey made 11 as Australia were bowled out for 143 and forced to follow on in the Third Test played on a turning pitch at Headingley . He then contributed 69 of 140 in the second innings of the Third Test at Headingley , when the rest of the team struggled to deal with Laker and Lock , who spun England to an innings victory . It was the first time Australia had suffered an innings defeat in a Test since 1938 . However , Harvey was unable to repeat his defiant form over the next three weeks . The Fourth Test in Manchester was the low point , when Harvey managed a pair , falling both times to Laker , who took a world record 19 wickets . Australia were routed by an innings in what is known as " Laker 's match " to concede the Ashes 2 – 1 . The debacle at Old Trafford was part of a three @-@ week trough during which Harvey scored only 11 runs , including three consecutive ducks in a 17 @-@ day period that yielded not a solitary run . 
 Harvey then returned to productivity with 145 against Warwickshire and added a further half @-@ century in the remaining matches . He also took 5 / 57 in an innings to help set up a seven @-@ wicket win over the Minor Counties , although the match was not first @-@ class . Harvey compiled 197 runs at 19 @.@ 70 in five Tests with two half centuries . It was by far his most unproductive summer in England , with 976 runs at 31 @.@ 48 . Such was the dominance of the Laker @-@ Lock @-@ led attack that Harvey was Australia 's fifth @-@ highest runscorer in the Tests and fourth in the first @-@ class matches . 
 On the return to Australia , the team stopped on the Indian subcontinent to play their first Tests on Pakistani and Indian soil respectively . In a short tour , the four Tests were the only fixtures . Harvey failed to pass double figures in a one off Test against Pakistan in Karachi , the first between the two countries . Moving to India , he scored 140 in the drawn Second Test in Bombay , scoring runs all around the ground . Due to injuries and illness to many of the bowlers , the Australians were unable to dismiss their hosts twice . In the final match , Australia were in trouble after taking a 41 @-@ run first innings lead . In the second innings they were struggling on a sticky wicket caused by flooding , but made 69 out of 9 / 189 in the low @-@ scoring Third Test in Calcutta to help Australia to a 2 – 0 series win . He ended with 253 runs at 63 @.@ 25 for the series . His performances on the subcontinent were marked by his aggressive footwork in moving down to meet the pitch of the ball . After seven months away , the Australians returned home . 
 = = Senior player and vice captaincy = = 
 As expected , the Australian team 's leaders Ian Johnson and Keith Miller , retired from cricket after the tour . Harvey replaced Johnson as Victorian captain and was the logical choice as successor to the Test captaincy , as the most experienced member of the team ( 48 Tests ) . Queensland 's captain , the veteran paceman Ray Lindwall , was no longer an automatic Test selection . However , both Harvey and Benaud had been criticised for their attitude towards Johnson in an official report to the board about the 1956 tour . Harvey was surprisingly overlooked for the captaincy , which went to Ian Craig , who had replaced Miller as New South Wales skipper . Craig was only 22 and had played six Tests ; he had yet to establish himself in the team . After several disappointing results against England , the selectors chose a youthful team . Harvey was named vice @-@ captain to Craig for both the 1956 – 57 non @-@ Test tour of New Zealand and the 1957 – 58 Test tour to South Africa . 
 Australia 's two new leaders featured in a dramatic game during the season — the first tied match in Sheffield Shield history , played at the Junction Oval in Melbourne . New South Wales , chasing 161 to win , slumped to 7 / 70 when Craig ( suffering tonsillitis ) defied medical orders , left his hospital bed , and came out to bat . A partnership of 75 with Richie Benaud took them to within 16 runs of victory , but another collapse left the scores tied . 
 The day after the captaincy announcement , the Harvey @-@ led Victorians met Craig 's New South Welshmen at the SCG in the last match of the Shield season . Harvey admitted to being irked by the board 's snub and felt that it was because of his blunt nature . The men were cordial at the toss and Craig sent the Victorians in to bat . At the same time , Victorian batsman Colin McDonald hit a ball into his face and broke his nose while practising , as Harvey and Craig went out to toss . Harvey asked for a gentleman 's agreement to allow a substitute for McDonald . Craig refused , citing the importance of the match . This evoked a rare angry response from Harvey , according to Benaud . Playing with ten men , Benaud said that Harvey " proceeded , with a certain amount of anger , to play one of the best innings I have seen in Sheffield Shield " . He made 209 and later forced New South Wales to follow @-@ on . In the end the match was drawn and Harvey was unable to deny New South Wales the title . Harvey said that his first double century for Victoria " gave me as much pleasure as any innings I had ever played " . He finished his only season as Victorian captain by leading the Shield averages with 836 runs at 104 @.@ 50 . 
 His other substantial scores were 108 ( more than half the team total ) and 53 in an innings loss to Queensland , 125 and 66 not out in a win over against South Australia and 115 in the return match against Queensland . In a selection trial , he led Harvey 's XI to a seven @-@ wicket win over Lindwall 's XI , scoring 31 and 61 not out . 
 The New Zealand tour was regarded as a test of Craig as a leader . Wicket @-@ keeper Barry Jarman said that Craig " had to do it himself ... <unk> 't so dumb that I couldn 't see the senior players didn 't give him much support " . The senior players resented his surprise selection as captain , but he gained favour by defying a management @-@ imposed curfew , which was later scrapped . 
 Harvey was unable to maintain his from the Australian season after crossing the Tasman to face the New Zealanders . He scored 129 runs at 25 @.@ 80 , including an 84 , as Australia won the third and final match to take the series 1 – 0 . Outside the international matches , Harvey was productive , and he totalled 460 runs at 46 @.@ 00 for the tour . 
 Some players remained resentful of Craig 's dubious elevation ahead of Harvey during the 1957 – 58 tour of South Africa but appreciated that he had not promoted himself and that he was fair and open to input from teammates . On the tour , Harvey broke a finger at catching practice and missed the early tour matches . After it healed , Harvey returned for a match against a South African XI , in a virtual dress rehearsal for the Tests . He scored 173 as the tourists crushed their hosts by an innings . 
 However , he broke the same finger again and missed the First Test , ending a run of 48 consecutive Test matches . He returned for the remaining Tests and scored 68 in the Third Test to help to force a draw , after Australia had conceded a 221 @-@ run first innings lead , but apart from that he had a disappointing series , failing to pass 25 and finishing with 131 runs at 21 @.@ 83 . 
 Despite the disagreement as to whether Craig was deserving of the captaincy , the team proceeded smoothly without infighting . Prior to the Fifth Test , Craig wanted to drop himself due to poor form , which would have made Harvey captain . Peter Burge , the third member of the selection panel and a Harvey supporter , was comfortable with this , but Harvey relinquished his opportunity to seize the leadership by ordering Burge to retain Craig . When the vote was formally taken , Harvey and Burge outvoted Craig , who was still offering to drop himself . 
 The Tests aside , Harvey continued to score regularly in the other games , and ended with 759 first @-@ class runs at 50 @.@ 60 , with two centuries and five fifties . The team under Craig and Harvey , labelled the worst to leave Australian shores , went home 3 – 0 victors in the five Test series . 
 = = Move to New South Wales and non @-@ captaincy = = 
 After returning from South Africa , Harvey embarrassed the Board of Control when he frankly discussed his financial situation during a television interview . He revealed that the players earned only £ 85 per Test and that he was almost broke , despite being an automatic selection for Australia . Ten years of making time for cricket had disrupted his working life , so he was contemplating a move to South Africa , the homeland of his wife , Iris . Consequently , Harvey received a job offer to work as a sales supervisor for a glass manufacturer in Sydney , so he moved to New South Wales and gave up the Victorian captaincy . As a new player to NSW , he was behind vice @-@ captain Richie Benaud in the state 's pecking order , despite being the Test vice @-@ captain , ahead of Benaud . <unk> , Craig was unfit for the start of the 1958 – 59 season , due to the after @-@ effects of hepatitis . 
 This left the Australian captaincy open again . Harvey started the season strongly and scored 326 runs in his first three innings . This included 160 against Queensland and 149 for his new state against the touring England team of Peter May . In this match , Benaud had captained New South Wales and the hosts had the better of the play . They took a 214 @-@ run first innings lead and May 's men when 6 / 356 when time ran out . 
 Harvey was appointed to captain an Australian XI in a warm @-@ up match against the touring Englishmen , indicating that the selectors were considering him for the Test captaincy . Harvey scored a duck and 38 and the Australians lost heavily by 345 runs on a wicket with a crater . Therefore , Benaud was made Australian captain ahead of Harvey . 
 As Benaud 's deputy , Harvey helped materially in Australia 's surprise 4 – 0 series victory to reclaim the Ashes . Harvey 's form was modest , though . He scored 296 runs at 42 @.@ 29 , with more than half coming in one innings — a brilliant 167 in the Second Test at Melbourne , more than half his team 's 308 , which helped secure an eight wicket victory in the match . Otherwise , a 41 in the Fourth Test was the only other time he passed 25 in the series . Outside the Tests , he scored 92 in the second match of the season between New South Wales and England , and ended the season with 949 runs at 49 @.@ 95 . It was season of two @-@ halves ; in the latter two months , he scored only 339 runs . 
 During the 1959 – 60 season , Australian undertook an arduous tour of the subcontinent , with three and five Tests against Pakistan and India , respectively . Prior to the trip , Harvey made 112 in the second innings to help Lindwall 's XI defeat Benaud 's XI by seven wickets . 
 In Dhaka , East Pakistan ( now in Bangladesh ) , Harvey made 96 on a matting pitch over rough ground in the First Test , mastering the medium pace of Fazal Mahmood , while his teammates struggled to score . In the course of the innings , Harvey had to overcome a fever , dysentery and physical illness , which forced him to leave six times to recompose himself . Gideon Haigh called it " one of his most dazzling innings " . Described by Benaud as " one of the best innings at Test level " , it set up an Australian win . During his stay at the crease , his partners contributed 48 runs while seven wickets fell . Harvey 's innings allowed Australia to score 225 in reply to the hosts ' 200 . Harvey then made 30 in the second innings to help ensure an eight @-@ wicket win . 
 After scoring 43 in the first innings , the second Test in Lahore came down to a run @-@ chase for Australia , with Harvey and Norm O 'Neill seemingly on schedule to win before time ran out . However , the Pakistani fielders began to waste time in an attempt to foil an Australian victory . They swapped the cover and midwicket fielders very slowly whenever the left and rightt @-@ handed combination of Harvey and O 'Neill took a single and changed the batsman on strike . To counter this , Harvey deliberately backed away from a straight ball and let himself be bowled , throwing his wicket away for 37 . This allowed Benaud to come in and bat with O 'Neill so that the two rightt @-@ handed batsmen would give the Pakistanis no opportunity to waste time by switching the field . Australia won the match with minutes to spare . Harvey scored 54 and 13 not out in the drawn third Test at Karachi . Australia took the series 2 – 0 , but would not win another Test in Pakistan until 1998 . Harvey ended the series with 273 runs at 54 @.@ 60 . 
 In India , Harvey scored 114 out of Australia 's 468 in the First Test at Delhi , setting up an innings victory for Australia . On a pitch conducive to spin at Kanpur for the second Test , Harvey was given a rare opportunity to bowl and he took the wicket of the Indian captain , <unk> <unk> . In addition , he scored 51 and 25 , the second highest Australian score in each innings in a low @-@ scoring match , but India won to square the series , with off spinner <unk> Patel taking 14 / 124 . Harvey hit 102 in a drawn third Test in Bombay and took his third ( and final ) Test wicket , A. G. Milkha Singh , in the fourth Test at Madras . He ended the series with 356 runs at 50 @.@ 86 , a significant contribution to Australia 's 2 – 1 triumph . 
 = = International twilight = = 
 In the last years of his Test career , Harvey struggled , making 876 runs at 33 @.@ 69 in three Test series . 
 At the start of the 1960 – 61 season , there was little indication of this . In his first five innings for the summer , Harvey hit 135 against Queensland , 80 and 63 for an Australian XI against the touring West Indies , 229 against Queensland and 109 for New South Wales against the Caribbean team . However , his form tapered away during the thrilling 1960 – 61 home series against the West Indies ( which included the first tie in Test history ) . Harvey was ineffective apart from a score of 85 in the second innings of the Third Test , which Australia lost . He then missed the Fourth Test due to injury . He struggled in the Tests , scoring only 143 runs at 17 @.@ 88 , but prospered against the Caribbean tourists in the tour matches , scoring 326 runs at 81 @.@ 50 . Overall , he totalled 849 runs at 56 @.@ 60 for the season . 
 Harvey began his final tour to England in 1961 , and Benaud 's regular absences due to a shoulder injury allowed him to lead Australia for a third of the tour matches . This included most of the first month of the tour ; Benaud hurt his shoulder in the first match against Worcestershire , and spent most of the next three weeks either not bowling or travelling to London away from his men for specialist treatment . At one stage , Australia were left with only 10 men on the field when Benaud excused himself and his replacement succumbed to illness , requiring an Englishman to stand in . Harvey scored 474 runs at 47 @.@ 40 in eight matches leading up to the Tests , including centuries against Lancashire and Glamorgan . It seemed that Harvey would captain Australia in a Test for the first time with Benaud 's shoulder still problematic , but the captain declared himself fit . Harvey then made 114 in the drawn First Test at Edgbaston . This helped Australia take a 321 @-@ run first innings lead and put them in control of the match , but the hosts batted for the remainder of the match to stave off defeat ; Benaud 's shoulder prevented him from bowling more than nine overs . 
 The injury forced Benaud out of the next Test , meaning that Harvey finally captained Australia at the highest level , in the Second Test at Lord 's , with Davidson carrying an injury and wicketkeeper Wally Grout with a black eye . This meant that Australia 's two best bowlers were injured , although Davidson agreed to play . Played on a controversial pitch with a noticeable ridge running across it , which caused irregular bounce , it was one of the great Test matches , known as " The Battle of the Ridge " . Davidson took 5 / 42 and bruised many of the English batsmen with the irregular bounce as the hosts were bowled out for 205 . Australia then replied with 339 , in large part due to Bill Lawry 's 130 , during which he sustained many blows . In the second innings , Harvey 's captaincy moves proved to be highly productive . He gave the new ball to Graham McKenzie , a young paceman playing in his first international series . McKenzie responded by taking 5 / 37 . Harvey brought the part @-@ time leg spin of Bob Simpson into the attack when Ray Illingworth had just arrived at the crease , and moved himself into the leg slip position . Illingworth edged Simpson into Harvey 's hands for a duck . England fell for 202 , leaving Australia a target of 69 . 
 However , victory appeared to be far from certain when Australia slumped to 4 / 19 on the erratic surface . Harvey sent Peter Burge out to attack the bowling , a tactic that worked as Australia won by five wickets . Burge hit the winning runs after earlier being dropped . The " Battle of the Ridge " was the only time Harvey captained Australia in a Test match . Despite the win , Harvey was not prominent in terms of his individual contribution , scoring 27 and four . Harvey described the win as " <unk> my proudest moment . We really got on the French champagne that afternoon . I knew it 'd be my only Test match as captain and , being at Lord 's , I decided to make the best of it . " 
 Benaud returned for the Third Test , when England levelled the series despite twin half @-@ centuries of 73 and 53 from Harvey , who top @-@ scored in both innings on a dustbowl in a match that lasted only three days . Harvey failed to pass 35 in the last two Tests , and ended with 338 runs at 42 @.@ 25 , and was a significant factor in Australia 's eventual 2 – 1 victory . In the second half of the tour , Harvey added centuries against Nottinghamshire and Warwickshire and took his career best bowling <unk> of 4 / 8 against Middlesex to help set up a ten @-@ wicket win . He ended his final tour for Australia with 1452 runs at 44 @.@ 00 with five centuries . During the season , Harvey and Benaud led aggressively to force a result through attacking strategy and a determination to avoid time @-@ wasting . 
 The 1961 – 62 was purely domestic , and Harvey played a full season in the Sheffield Shield as New South Wales won their ninth consecutive title . However , Harvey was not prominent in the team 's success and scored only 425 runs at 26 @.@ 56 with two fifties for the season . 
 Having stated his intention to retire at the end of the summer , Harvey started his final season in 1962 – 63 strongly . He scored 83 , 44 and 128 not in his first three interstate innings for the season , and then scored 51 , 21 and 63 in warm @-@ up matches against England . 
 Harvey was thus selected in the series against England , his last in international cricket . During the season , Harvey applied to the Australian Cricket Board for permission to work as a journalist while also playing cricket . The application was refused , but Harvey wrote some bitter criticism of England captain Ted Dexter at the end of the series . Following a complaint from the Marylebone Cricket Club , the ACB said that it deplored Harvey 's comments . Beginning steadily with half @-@ centuries in the first and third Tests , Harvey made his 21st and final century in the fourth Test at Adelaide . Scoring 154 in a drawn match at the venue where his international career began 15 seasons earlier , Harvey then returned to his adopted hometown of Sydney for his farewell match . With the series level at 1 – 1 , the Ashes were still alive but the game turned into a dull draw and Harvey scored 22 and 28 . He was bowled by David Allen in the final innings . In the two English innings , he held six catches to equal the world record , a reminder of his prowess as one of Australia 's great all @-@ round fielders . Harvey retired as Australia 's most capped player , and a tally of runs and centuries second only to Don Bradman . 
 Harvey made centuries in two of his last three first @-@ class matches . In his last Sheffield Shield match , he scored an unbeaten 231 against South Australia in less than five hours , including 120 runs in one session . This set up a ten @-@ wicket victory . In his final season , Harvey scored 1110 runs at 52 @.@ 85 . 
 = = Style = = 
 Harvey was regarded as a mercurial batsman of great artistry and style . A short man at 172 cm ( 5 ft ; 8 in ) , he batted with aggression , and was known for his timing of the ball . His batting against spin bowling in particular was a crowd pleaser , highlighted by his extravagant footwork in charging the bowlers . Harvey often charged five paces down the pitch to spinners , with one bowler quipping " He kept coming so far along the track toward me that I thought he must want to shake my hands " . Despite running out of the crease so much , Harvey was never stumped in a Test match . He was of the time belief that any bowling could and should be hit , and gave the impression that the balls were reaching the boundary with a minimum of power . According to Johnnie Moyes , " the sight of his slim figure , neat and trim @-@ looking , always <unk> , coming to bat brought new hope for spectators . He will never prod a half volley or decline the challenge of a long hop ... he will go looking for the ball which he can hit for four . " Following the retirement of Sir Donald Bradman , he was seen as Australia 's leading batsman , noted by critics for a similar ability to change the mood of matches with his attacking play . Ashley Mallett said that Harvey is Australia 's best batsman since Bradman . This was despite the fact that he was found to have faulty eyesight . With the global expansion of cricket , Harvey was the first Australian to make Test centuries in 15 different cities , succeeding in a variety of conditions . Harvey made 67 first @-@ class centuries spread across 35 venues in six countries . He scored 38 of these overseas , where his average was higher . He was the first batsman to score more than 10 @,@ 000 runs for Australian teams at home and abroad . 
 Harvey 's attacking style often led to criticism that his batting was risky , with England captain Len Hutton feeling that he played and missed too much , while dour all @-@ rounder Trevor Bailey quipped " I wonder how many runs Harvey would make if he decided to stop playing strokes with an element of risk about them " . Harvey was nevertheless happy to continue his flamboyant strokeplay . However , as Harvey progressed in seniority , he eschewed his hook shot and played more conservatively for his team 's sake . He typically evaded bouncers by tilting his head , rather than ducking the ball . 
 Although Harvey started as a wicketkeeper at school , he became a highly regarded cover fielder and later in his international career became an agile slips catcher . He bowled off spin from a three to four pace approach on rare occasions , taking only three wickets in his Test career . Away from the field , Harvey had a quiet and unassuming manner , in complete contrast to his dynamic batting , and his non @-@ smoking , non @-@ drinking set him apart from the prevailing cricket culture of his period . Harvey was known for his respect for umpiring decisions and for never appealing for leg before wicket when he fielded in the slips . 
 When not travelling overseas on cricket tours , Harvey played baseball in the winter for the Fitzroy Baseball Club . He was twice named in the Australian baseball team but the team was named only for the distinction accorded on the players . That is , they never competed . Harvey 's fielding abilities were regarded by Wisden as the " finest outfielder in the world " during his career . As a baseball infielder Harvey developed a half round arm throw ; its speed and accuracy caused many batsmen to be run out while attempting a run . Ray Robinson said that Harvey 's throw was " arrow @-@ like " in accuracy and that " as a versatile fieldsman , this ball @-@ hawk ... takes top place " . His baseball training also influenced his habit of catching the ball above head height , with which he rarely dropped catches . This was based on the theory that the fielder need never take his eyes off the ball and , if it were to bounce out of his hands , he would have time to attempt to grab the rebound . Harvey also covered ground quickly and possessed and efficient method of picking up and returning the ball . From late 1958 when Norm O 'Neill made his Test debut until Harvey 's retirement in 1963 , the duo formed a formidable pairing in the covers , helping to restrict opposition batsmen from scoring in the region . 
 = = Later years = = 
 He was an Australian selector from 1967 to 1979 . Immediately after his appointment , he was embroiled in controversy during the First Test against India at Brisbane in 1967 – 68 . The Queensland Cricket Association wrote to the board , complaining that Harvey , who was the selector on duty at the Test , had missed two hours of play . He had been at a race meeting at the invitation of the <unk> president . The ACB gave Harvey a talking to . Despite this , he retained his position at the next annual election , with Queensland 's Ken Mackay failing to gain a seat on the selection panel . 
 From 1971 onwards , Harvey was the chairman of selectors . It was a tumultuous period in Australian cricket , where captain Bill Lawry was acrimoniously sacked in the middle of the 1970 – 71 series against England after a dispute between players and Australian officials . Lawry was not informed of his fate and learned of his omission on the radio when he was still one of Australia 's most productive batsmen . The dispute was the genesis of the pay dispute which , led to the formation of World Series Cricket in 1977 and generated a mass exodus of players . This resulted in the recall of Bob Simpson after ten years in retirement at the age of 41 to captain the Test team . Following the rapprochement between the establishment and the WSC players , Harvey left the selection panel . The WSC representatives felt that Harvey 's anti @-@ WSC comments made him prejudiced against the selection of former WSC players . 
 After returning from South Africa in 1950 , Harvey was offered a job in captain Lindsay Hassett 's sports store . Harvey accepted immediately because sports stores gave more flexible arrangements for leave to play cricket . Harvey was sponsored by Stuart Surridge to use their cricket equipment . He was paid £ 300 a year , but nevertheless lived at home and shared a bedroom with his brothers Brian and Ray until he married , due to poverty . He used the same cricket uniforms for more than five years . 
 Harvey 's career extended into a successful business , Har @-@ V @-@ Sales , which distributed <unk> , kitchen and cosmetic products . 
 In later life , he was known for his blunt and critical comments towards modern players , believing the cricket in earlier times to be superior . After Steve Waugh 's team set a world record of consecutive Test victories , Harvey named three Australian teams that he thought to be superiors , saying " no , far from it " in response to the suggestion that Waugh 's men were the best team in history . He attributed the wins to weak opponents , stating " No I don 't think they 're up to the world standard they were years ago " and that the 1980s West Indies team were far superior . He also criticised the Australian team for publicly praising the skills of their opponents , believing that they did so to aggrandise their statistical performances against teams he considered to be weak . In 2000 he was named in the Australian Cricket Board 's Team of the Century and criticised modern day batsmen , noting that players in earlier eras had to play on sticky wickets saying " these guys who play out here are a little bit spoilt in my opinion . They play on flat wickets all the time and they <unk> if ... the ball does a little bit off the pitch , and whatever ... But we had to put up with that " and going to assert his opinion that the current players would be no match . 
 Harvey was inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2000 , in the first annual induction of two players since the inaugural ten members were announced in 1996 . In 2009 , Harvey was one of the 55 inaugural inductees into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame . He was also inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985 . Harvey vociferously called for Shane Warne and Mark Waugh to be banned from cricket after it was revealed that they accepted money from bookmakers to give pitch and weather information and the ACB privately fined them . He lamented the decline in player conduct in the modern era , also criticising the modern advent of sledging . 
 In 2002 , Harvey called for Mark and Steve Waugh to be dropped from the Australian team , claiming that they were a waste of space . He stated : 
 Money is the only thing that keeps them playing ... If they earned the same money as I did when I was playing they 'd have retired at 34 as I did , and Australian cricket would be the better for it . 
 When Waugh was close to being dropped during the 2002 – 03 series against England , Harvey wrote off a half @-@ century made by Waugh , saying " he 's playing against probably one of the worst cricket teams I 've ever seen . "

 During the 1949 – 50 tour of South Africa , Harvey met his first wife Iris Greenish . At the time , Greenish was only 16 years old and Harvey 21 , and their relationship became the subject of controversy when her father told the media that he would object to the couple 's engagement until his daughter turned 18 . They married four years later at Holy Trinity Church in East Melbourne and had three children , two sons and a daughter . 
 After a twenty @-@ year marriage , Harvey and Iris divorced . Two years later , he married Barbara <unk> at the age of 47 , and subsequently had three more children .

 " Leonard Betts " is the twelfth episode of the fourth season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on January 26 , 1997 . It was written by Vince Gilligan , John Shiban , and Frank Spotnitz , directed by Kim Manners , and featured a guest appearance by Paul McCrane as Leonard Betts / Albert Tanner . The episode is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . " Leonard Betts " was Fox 's lead @-@ out program following Super Bowl XXXI and was the most watched episode of the series , receiving a Nielsen household rating of 17 @.@ 2 , being watched by 29 @.@ 1 million people in its initial broadcast . The episode received positive reviews , with critics commenting positively on the character of Betts and McCrane 's performance . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work . In this episode , Mulder and Scully investigate the supposed death and regeneration of an emergency medical technician ( EMT ) named Leonard Betts , a mutant who subsists on cancer and can regenerate severed body parts . 
 " Leonard Betts " was a story milestone for the series , introducing the detection of Agent Scully 's cancer , which would go on to play a larger role in the latter part of season four and much of season five . In addition , the episode has been analyzed for its themes of physical drives and psychological egoism . The production for the episode required several physically exerting stunts coupled with special effects in order to bring the illusions of the episode to life . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Pittsburgh , Leonard Betts ( Paul McCrane ) , an EMT paramedic , is decapitated when his ambulance collides with a truck . Later , at the morgue , his headless body leaves its cold chamber , knocks out the attendant , steals his clothes , and escapes . Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) visit the morgue , where they find Betts ' head in a medical waste dumpster . Scully attempts a cranial examination , but the head 's eyes and mouth both suddenly open when she begins the procedure . Meanwhile , Mulder goes to Betts ' apartment , where he finds the attendant 's discarded clothes . When Mulder leaves , Betts — who has regrown his head — rises out of his iodine @-@ filled bathtub . 
 Mulder interviews Michelle Wilkes ( Jennifer Clement ) , Betts ' former partner , who recollects his ability to detect cancer . When an interior slice of Betts ' polymerized head is examined , the agents discover that his frontal lobe displayed signs of pervasive cancer . Mulder has Chuck Burks ( Bill Dow ) subject the slice to an Kirlian photography test ; the final image shows corona discharge that takes the appearance of human shoulders . 
 Using fingerprint records , Scully learns that Betts had an alter ego named Albert Tanner . The agents visit his elderly mother , Elaine ( Marjorie Lovett ) , who claims that " Albert " died in a car accident six years previously . Meanwhile , Wilkes tracks down Betts at another hospital and confronts him . After an apology , he gives her a lethal injection of potassium chloride ; Betts is then pursued and captured by a security guard . After he is handcuffed to his car , Betts escapes by tearing off his thumb . The agents search the car the next morning , finding disposed tumors in a cooler in the trunk . Mulder believes that Betts subsists on the tumors , and that his nature makes him the embodiment of a radical leap in evolution . 
 Upon learning that the car is registered to Elaine , the agents have the police search her home . Elaine recounts how her son endured bullying as a child " because he was different " , and says that " he had his reasons " if he killed anybody . Meanwhile , Betts accosts a bar patron and kills him to obtain his cancerous lung . Later , in a storage unit , he seems to shed his body and create a duplicate . When the agents come across the storage unit , the duplicate Betts attempts to flee in a car , which explodes when fired upon and seemingly kills him . Scully suggests that Betts ' first " death " as Albert Tanner was staged , but when they exhume Tanner 's casket , they find his body still inside . Mulder becomes convinced that Betts can not only regenerate his body parts , but his entire body itself . Because of this , he believes that Betts is still at large . 
 At Elaine 's behest , Betts removes a cancerous tumor from her body before summoning an ambulance . The agents , already staking out Elaine 's house , encounter the paramedics when they arrive . Scully accompanies Elaine to the hospital while Mulder conducts a search of the neighborhood . However , after arriving at the hospital , Scully realizes that Betts has stowed himself away on the roof of the ambulance . Betts locks her inside the ambulance with him , calmly but apologetically telling her that she has " something [ he ] need [ s ] . " This leads Scully to realize that she herself has cancer . After a struggle , Scully kills Betts by pressing charged defibrillator paddles against his head . Scully remains silently stunned by the revelation of her illness . Later , in her apartment , she wakes up with a nosebleed , confirming her disease .

 " Leonard Betts " was written by Vince Gilligan , John Shiban , and Frank Spotnitz and directed by Kim Manners . Scripts written by Gilligan , Shiban , and Spotnitz would later go on to be humorously referred to as creations of a " John <unk> " — a portmanteau of the three writers ' names . According to Spotnitz , the script for " Leonard Betts " was " not particularly well @-@ loved at the time " . Spotnitz later noted , however , that the episode became " one of [ his ] favorite monster shows " . Originally , the episode " Never Again " was supposed to come before the episode . Vince Gilligan explained , " [ series creator Chris Carter ] really wanted to grab viewers who had never seen us before [ the Super Bowl ] , and we knew the best way to do that would be with a really creepy stand @-@ alone monster story . " Thus , the air date of " Leonard Betts " was flipped with " Never Again " in order to ensure that the former episode , which featured the show 's two stars in their traditional roles , aired after the Super Bowl . Anderson has said that she would have played the part differently in " Never Again " — which featured Scully acting notably out of character — had she been aware that Scully would get cancer at the time , as Scully only discovers this at the end of " Leonard Betts " . 
 The episode is notable in that it was the first episode of the series to confirm Agent Scully 's cancer . Reportedly , when Chris Carter informed Gillian Anderson that her character would be diagnosed with cancer , she was " delighted " that she would be able to play her character in a different way . John Shiban considers the episode to be " a great X @-@ Files story " and very important because it established the story @-@ arc featuring Scully 's cancer . However , the audience receives an early indication of Scully 's cancer in the episode " Unruhe " ( which aired earlier in the same season , also written by Vince Gilligan ) , when Gerry Schnauz kidnaps her in the episode and says he can see Scully 's " unrest " , and points to the bridge of her nose – exactly where her cancer would be . 
 Additionally , in the last scene of the episode , Scully wakes up in a coughing fit at 2 : <unk> . Episode 2 @.@ 08 " One Breath " is the episode where Agent Scully is returned from her abduction . Leonard Bett 's call sign as an EMT after his regeneration is also 208 , as heard on the radio by his partner Michelle after her return to work . Later , she asks after him to another ambulance team , who refer to him as " the new guy " . 
 = = = Casting and filming = = = 
 Actor Paul McCrane , who later went on to play the noted role of Dr. Robert Romano on ER , was cast to play the role of Leonard Betts . Director Kim Manners urged McCrane to play the role of Betts with " emotional conviction . " Manners later explained that " I found that if you take the absurd and base it in the reality of human emotion , the audience is going to buy it as if it actually exists . You know ? " 
 McCrane had to spend hours in makeup in order to get the right effect and his eyes were colored with specially made contact lenses . Many of the scenes were physically exerting . The autopsy scene involved McCrane positioning himself through a hole in the table and sitting perfectly still , giving the illusion of a disembodied head . The scene in the bathtub required McCrane to spend several minutes motionless underwater . The shot in which a new Betts emerges from the old one 's mouth was created by Toby Lindala . Lindala used shots of McCrane intercut with shots of a puppet with full @-@ functioning mouth and eyes . Laverne Basham and Lindala were later both nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Makeup in a Series . In addition , the machine that created a slice of Betts ' head was designed by Ken <unk> . 
 = = Academic analysis = = 
 = = = Themes = = = 
 According to Jan Delasara , one of the major themes of " Leonard Betts " is the exploration of " irresistible physical drives . " In Betts ' case , his desire to kill is due to a biological need , not a malevolent desire to murder . The A.V. Club 's Todd VanDerWerff , in his review of the episode , wrote that " It also helps that Leonard 's such an understandably human monster . On some level , he just wants to survive , and he 's not happy about what he has to do to be able to survive . " " Leonard Betts " serves as the first story in a multi @-@ season story @-@ arc that features Agent Scully being diagnosed with terminal cancer . Richard Edwards , in the chapter " Some Philosophical Reflections on ' Trust No One ' " of their book The Philosophy of The X @-@ Files , argue that Scully withholding the knowledge of her cancer from Mulder is an example of psychological egoism in a protagonist . They reason that by not telling her partner , she is withholding the information in an act of self @-@ interest . 
 Elyce Rae Helford in her book Fantasy Girls : Gender in the New Universe of Science Fiction and Fantasy Television notes that the episode contains themes of " maternal sacrifice and maternal monstrosity " that are common throughout the series . In " Leonard Betts " , the titular character 's mother nearly sacrifices her own life to give her son the cancer he needs in order to escape death . Helford argues that these motifs concerning maternal figures are most notable in the season four and five " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " episodes , such as " Home " . 
 Betts ' condition , in which he is " riddled with cancer " but can " see the sickness within people " , according to Amy Donaldson , is a metaphor for someone who " has let sin or evil become the regular course of life " . Although Betts can detect and consume the illness , his motives are derived from " his own self appetite " . Donaldson contrasts him with the soul eater , from eight season entry " The Gift " . In the episode , Agent John Doggett , played by Robert Patrick , stumbles upon a creature that altruistically absorbs the diseases and ailments of others . The soul eater is the polar opposition of Betts , in that takes the illness to help others , rather than to harm them and keep living , which is Betts ' mode of operation . 
 = = = Scientific research = = = 
 According to biology professor and science advisor to the X @-@ Files Anne Simon , the manner in which Betts can regrow limbs is somewhat similar to the way in which amphibians and newts can regenerate tails and other limbs . She notes that many amphibian cells can " turn back the clock [ and ] revert back to an [ embryonic ] time when any fate was possible " . In humans , only two types of cells — blood cells and liver cells — are able to regenerate , however , the process is different via the stem cell . Simon also postulates that Betts was able to regenerate because he had a specific relationship between his immune system and his cellular growth . She notes that what Scully and Burks mistook for tumors were actually <unk> , or masses of cells capable of growth and regeneration into organs or body parts . Simon also suggests that , for Betts to truly be composed entirely of cancer cells , he would have to lack functioning p53 , the tumor suppressor protein . This condition , however , is always fatal .

 The episode received largely positive reviews from critics . The A.V.

' Leonard Betts ' isn 't the best episode of The X @-@ Files , but it signifies that we 're moving into one of the show 's very best periods , and it does so with a confidence and verve that the series didn 't always display . " Many critics praised the tenacity of the writers for airing an episode featuring such a creepy character after the Super Bowl . Writing for Den of Geek , John Moore listed Betts as one of his " Top 10 X @-@ Files Baddies " , writing that " Fox had the Superbowl [ sic ] , the Superbowl happens on a Sunday , Fox decides to run the show in the prime slot after the big game ... [ ... ] So , did , they soft @-@ pedal things in order to grab a wider audience ? Er ... no . Instead they decided to feature a cancer @-@ eating living tumour that could re @-@ grow his own limbs at will . That 's why I love the X @-@ Files . " 
 Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it three stars out of four . Vitaris praised the episode 's balance of humor and horror , noting " Although ' Leonard Betts ' is not a comedy , the three writers take such pleasure in the story that you buy the situation . There 's a lot of situational ( and scary ) humor in the script . " Furthermore , she noted that the ending revelation that Scully has cancer and the following conversation between Mulder and Scully was " one of the season 's best scenes . " Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode four stars out of five . The two wrote positively of the " amiable quality to the story which makes its finale moments all the more of a kick in the teeth . " Shearman and Pearson noted that " Leonard Betts " was the first episode " to come along [ in the fourth season ] which feels light and frothy , and it deliberately makes the unkindest cut of all . " 
 The character of Leonard Betts itself has also attracted positive criticism . Connie Ogle from PopMatters ranked the character among the " greatest " monsters @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week , describing him as someone who could " grow back his own head after being decapitated , a feat that resulted in the show ’ s best @-@ rated episode .

 More than half of the passengers belonged to a single group , sponsored by the Buffalo , New York based International Fellowship student exchange program , consisting of 49 American high school exchange students , along with their teachers , family members , and guides , who were returning from a visit to nearby Machu Picchu to their host families in the Lima area . The daughter of the mayor of Lima was also accompanying the group . The Peruvian passengers included a couple on their honeymoon . 
 August 9 , 1970 was a Sunday , and Flight 502 was originally scheduled to depart Cuzco at 8 : 30 am , but since many of the members of the American group wanted to visit the nearby <unk> native handicraft market prior to leaving for Lima , the airline postponed the departure time to 2 : 45 pm . 
 <unk> Airport , since renamed to Alejandro Velasco <unk> International Airport , is located about 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east @-@ southeast of the city of Cusco , in a small valley high on the Andes , at an altitude of 10 @,@ 860 feet ( 3 @,@ 310 m ) above mean sea level . Higher mountainous terrain surrounds the single east @-@ west runway airport in all directions . Since it was August , it was winter time in Peru , as in the rest of the southern hemisphere . 
 At about 2 : 55 pm , the four @-@ engine Electra turboprop began its takeoff run to the west . At some point during the takeoff run or initial climb , the number three engine failed and caught fire . The crew continued the takeoff and climb , per standard procedure , using power from the remaining three engines . The pilot radioed the control tower declaring an emergency , and the control tower cleared the flight for an immediate landing . The number three engine was engulfed in flames as the crew retracted the flaps and maneuvered the plane into a left turn back to the runway . The plane entered a 30 – 45 degree bank , then rapidly lost altitude and crashed into hilly terrain about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) west @-@ southwest of the runway , above the village of San Jerónimo . The fuel on board lit up superbly and all aboard perished except the copilot , who was found in the wreckage of the cockpit badly burned but alive . Two farm workers were killed on the ground . 
 = = Investigation = = 
 The Peruvian government investigated the accident , and in its final report concluded that the probable cause of the accident was the improper execution of engine @-@ out procedures by the flight crew , with contributing factors of improper loading of the aircraft and improper maintenance procedures by company personnel . There was also evidence of a coverup and falsification of critical maintenance records by LANSA employees during the investigation process . The Peruvian government subsequently fined LANSA and some of its employees , and suspended the airline 's operating license for 90 days as a consequence . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 About a year after the accident , a monument — a large white cross with an attached nameplate — was erected on the spot of the crash site to commemorate the victims of LANSA flight 502 . In 2006 , because of encroaching development , the Peruvian owner of the land where the memorial was originally located , under pressure from the U.S. Senator from New York , Charles E. Schumer , the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Consulate General in Peru , agreed to relocate the memorial 150 feet away to protect the site .

 An Ideal World ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> zì <unk> de <unk> jiè " Seek Self 's World " ) is a full @-@ color Chinese manhua authored by <unk> Chen and illustrated by Chao Peng . The series was released in five volumes and published in China by Tian Jin Creator World Comic Company ( simplified Chinese : <unk> ; traditional Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : Tiān jīn <unk> jiè <unk> <unk> gōng <unk> ) under the title Seek Self 's World and as part of the <unk> Fairy Tale series . An Ideal World was licensed by various other companies and released simultaneously with the original publisher between 2006 and 2007 . The French manhua @-@ publishing company Xiao Pan licensed the series as " Un Monde Idéal " ( " An Ideal World " ) and Yen Press later announced at the New York Comic Con that they had licensed the series from Xiao Pan . Yen Press released it in North America as one volume called An Ideal World . 
 An Ideal World follows the struggles of A You , a young man who , believing he has no luck , does not attempt to succeed in life even though others advise him to make his own luck . When he accidentally gets on the wrong bus , A You finds himself in the suburbs , where he takes shelter from the rain in a large tree and takes a nap . After waking up , A You happens upon the house of an old man , who sends him to an alternate world so that he may resolve his troubles . A You grows to enjoy the fantasy world and does not wish to return to his harsh reality . An Ideal World garnered mixed reception from Western critics , who objected mainly to the beginning and praised the overall story , artwork and themes . 
 = = Plot = = 
 A You is a troubled 19 @-@ year @-@ old who dislikes his life ; he feels that his entire life is unlucky , yet he avoids hard work and prefers to be lazy . He is encouraged by the people around him to work harder and told that he can change his life if he takes control of it , but A You refuses to accept these notions . One day , he accidentally takes the wrong bus and finds himself in the suburbs of his city . A You enjoys his time away and takes shelter inside of a large , hollow tree when it begins to rain . After taking a nap and waking up , he wanders until he comes across a small , green old man referred to as Grandpa Beard . Grandpa Beard decides to help A You with his problems and transports him to a " utopia " called Abi Port in an alternate world . 
 Abi Port is home to several humans , anthropomorphic beings , and other creatures , some of which look similar to people A You knows in his world . A You is found by members of a circus , who invite him to join them in their act . Although he lacks experience , he finds that he can perform well and begins to develop feelings for a young performer named Anan . He meets others who give him advice on enjoying work and life , particularly the " Master of Universal Love " , an anthropomorphic zebra who toiled to earn his position and helps others free of charge . 
 After A You spends time in this world , Grandpa Beard decides that his problems are solved and returns to take him away from the imaginary world . A You protests , not wanting to return to the cold reality , but Grandpa Beard captures him and tells him that he must change that reality if he dislikes it . Returned to his own world , A You awakens in the tree he had taken shelter in and heads back to his house , where he finds his worried friends and family waiting for him . A You 's experiences at Abi Port inspire him to work harder , and he eventually gets married to his co @-@ worker and friend Su Fei . The two are shown years later at the grand opening of Grandpa Beard 's Fun House , a restaurant themed after Grandpa Beard , where A You sees he will accomplish his dream and spread happiness .

 An Ideal World , authored by <unk> Chen and illustrated by Chao Peng , was originally published in China by the Tian Jin Creator World Comic Company and entitled Seek Self 's World . It is part of the company 's <unk> Fairy Tale series . An Ideal World was licensed by the French manhua company Xiao Pan , as well as several other companies , which released it in five volumes entitled Un Monde Idéal ( " An Ideal World " ) from September 15 , 2006 to March 14 , 2007 . Contracts were made that allowed for the French , South Korean , Taiwanese , and Mainland Chinese companies to release the five volumes at the same time as the original company ; French , Chinese , and Korean language editions were published through a partnership with Beijing Total Vision Culture Spreads . An Ideal World 's global release was meant to aid in the development of the Chinese comic industry and create a new business model , and its release marked the first simultaneous global release for a comic . Xiao Pan also made an omnibus of the original Chinese version available for purchase . 
 At the 2008 New York Comic Con , American @-@ based graphic novel publisher Yen Press announced that they had acquired the rights to publish An Ideal World and would release it in full color . Rights were acquired from Xiao Pan , rather than Tian Jin Creator World Comic Co . On March 24 , 2009 , Yen Press released An Ideal World in North America as a single volume ; at 176 pages long , the volume also includes character sketches , the additional French covers , and information on the author , illustrator , and Chinese publisher . 
 An Ideal World was licensed for release in Mainland China by <unk> and <unk> Magazine and in South Korea by the South Korean branch of Cambridge University Press . <unk> published the series in Taiwan . At a conference held in February 2006 , Tian Jin Creator World Comic Company announced that negotiations were being made to release An Ideal World in other European countries , Japan , and with traditional Chinese characters in Taiwan . 
 = = Reception = = 
 An Ideal World has received mixed reviews from Western critics , who generally praised the book 's artwork and second half but did not like the beginning . School Library Journal 's Lori Henderson reviewed An Ideal World positively ; she praised the " Wizard of Oz feel " ending and the message that A You " controls his life , and he has the power to change it " . Henderson called the characters " great " and the world " fantastic " , also noting that the " cartoonish " and " exaggerated " artwork worked with the story . However , she remarked that the beginning of An Ideal World was " slow and plodding " and could " leave you wondering if it 's ever going to go anywhere " . Another School Library Journal critic , Joanna <unk> , felt that the lessons and themes were " unimaginative " , which made the artwork " a waste of visual whimsy " . 
 Sam Kusek of <unk> Shock also reviewed An Ideal World positively , grading it as a B + . Kusek applauded the artwork , saying that " colors really jump out " and set " the mood of the scene well , while keeping the backgrounds alive " , and that character designs enhance " the mystical and magical elements of the story " . Kusek liked the plot , but felt it was predictable ; however , he noted that the main element and focus was the " philosophy of life " and that , overall , An Ideal World " flows really well " . Writing for Comics Worth Reading , Ed Sizemore gave the book a mixed review . Sizemore wrote that he wished the message was conveyed " more [ subtly ] " and criticized the beginning of the book as " the toughest to get through " , but felt the " pace and readability improve " afterwards . He praised the art as " gorgeous " with " lots of eye candy " for those who enjoy fantasy artwork . Overall , Sizemore thought An Ideal World was " wasted potential " , with too much emphasis placed on the message , detracting from the storytelling . 
 Publishers Weekly praised An Ideal World for its message and art , but criticized how " the book gets bogged down in talky heavy @-@ handedness , as if someone put nice fantasy illustrations into a business self @-@ help book " . R. Bézard , a French critic for BD Gest , rated the first volume of the Xiao Pan edition of An Ideal World with two out of five stars . Bézard stated that the volume did not draw in the reader or give any indication of A You 's future adventure . However , Bézard praised the artwork as expressive and called it a cross between Dragon Ball Z and Fruits Basket . 
 = The Life ( advertisement ) = 
 The Life , also known as We Are ODST is a television and cinema advertisement launched in 2009 by Microsoft to promote the first person shooter Halo 3 : ODST in the United States . The 150 @-@ second piece follows a young soldier through enlistment , training , and battle as an Orbital Drop Shock Trooper ( ODST ) , analogous to a paratrooper that drops from space to a battlefield . The Life was created by advertising agency T.A.G. , an offshoot of McCann Erickson . Production of the commercial itself was handled by production company Morton / Jankel / Zander ( MJZ ) . It was directed by Rupert Sanders , and post @-@ production was conducted by Asylum . It was filmed in Hungary , just outside Budapest in a coal mine and abandoned factories to give the sequence an " Eastern Bloc " aesthetic . The commercial and its associated campaign , proved hugely successful ; on the week of its launch , Halo 3 : ODST became the top @-@ selling game for the Xbox 360 worldwide , and over 2 @.@ 5 million copies were sold within the first few weeks of release . The Life went on to win a number of honours from the advertising and entertainment industries , including two Clio Awards , a London International Advertising Award and several honours from the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival , the most prestigious awards ceremony in the advertising industry . 
 = = Sequence = = 
 The Life opens to a military funeral of an ODST . Rows of candles arranged along the floor burn as a bagpiper plays a dirge . The assembled mourners , a mix of military personnel and civilians , attend as the casket 's red ODST flag is removed , revealing the name of the deceased . A young man looks on as the cloth is ceremonially folded and passed to a woman among the mourners . A song in Welsh begins to play as the attending officer orders a gun salute in Hungarian . The camera cuts to another scene ; the young man , Tarkov , is having his head shaved in the first of a montage of scenes depicting Tarkov undergoing recruit training . Again , the camera cuts ahead . Tarkov is in a one @-@ man " drop pod " , entering the atmosphere of an alien planet , onto a battlefield . He emerges under fire alongside several other soldiers , moving over corpses and through plasma fire until a Covenant Brute knocks him aside , sending his helmet flying and scarring Tarkov 's face . Tarkov fires his pistol at the Brute to no avail . However , he is saved when a falling Banshee crashes into the Brute , killing it . The film jumps ahead again ; Tarkov is now a veteran soldier , and oversees a memorial service for one of his fallen comrades amidst burning ruins with a recruit that bears a resemblance to a younger Tarkov . Soon , sounds of gunfire draws him and his team back to the fight , closing with the lines " We are ODST " which transitions again into " Halo 3 : ODST " .

 In 1999 , Microsoft made the decision to consolidate its marketing efforts with a single advertising agency , after several years of partnership with different agencies for each of its product line . They entertained pitches from each of the agencies on their roster , and ultimately assigned the global account to McCann Erickson . McCann was assigned the task of promoting what would become the killer app of the Xbox , the video game Halo : Combat Evolved . The launch campaign was hugely successful , selling over five million copies of the game worldwide . The success of Halo : Combat Evolved led to a series of sequels and tie @-@ in merchandise including books and action figures . 
 In 2007 , McCann launched a multi @-@ platform global advertising campaign titled Believe , that included six minutes of live @-@ action sequences called Landfall , to promote the latest game in the Halo series , Halo 3 . Landfall was directed by Neill Blomkamp who also agreed to direct a full length Halo film , but it was cancelled due to funding disagreements . Believe proved a critical and financial hit . Over £ 84 million of sales were made on the first day of release alone , the highest @-@ grossing opening sale of an entertainment product at the time . Believe received dozens of awards from the advertising community , including eight Clio Awards , Best in Show at the ANDY Awards , and two Grand Prix ( for Film and Integrated campaigns ) at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival , the most prestigious awards ceremony in the advertising industry . According to the Gunn Report , Believe was the second @-@ most @-@ awarded integrated advertising campaign of 2008 , behind Earth Hour for the World Wide Fund for Nature . 
 In 2012 , due to the success of Landfall and The Life , Halo 4 : Forward Unto Dawn was created to broaden the audience of Halo 4 . Released initially as five 15 @-@ minute episodes online , it was later released as a ninety @-@ minute extended cut on DVD and Blu @-@ ray . Microsoft considers it the " next step " between advertising material and a full @-@ length film , and Frank O 'Connor , development director for the Halo franchise , has said that a film will be made " when the time is right " . Live action shorts were also used in the advertisement of Halo : Reach focusing on the Spartan supersoldiers of the Halo universe . Two shorts , The Birth of a Spartan and Deliver Hope were made , again to appeal to customers who were unfamiliar with the series .

 In early 2009 , McCann received a brief to create a new campaign for the latest entrant into the Halo series , a first @-@ person shooter called Halo 3 : ODST . It would be the first game in the franchise not to feature the series ' protagonist , the Master Chief . McCann returned with a pitch for a campaign in the same vein as Believe , aiming to humanize the soldiers featured in the Halo universe . The project was greenlit , and McCann brought back several collaborators from Believe to handle this new campaign , now given the working title of The Life . 
 Director Rupert Sanders , known for his work with production company MJZ on campaigns such as Lava for Guinness and <unk> Return for Nike , Inc . , was given five weeks to produce the commercial , with three days set aside for filming . Several locations were scouted for shooting , with an eye towards an " Eastern Bloc " aesthetic . These included several areas around Chernobyl , Ukraine . However , the tight schedule precluded using locations too distant from one another for different scenes and , in the end , three spots outside of Budapest , Hungary were settled upon : the cooling tower of an active nuclear power station was dressed to act as the backdrop to the opening funeral scene ; an open @-@ pit coal mine served as the setting for the battle scenes , and an abandoned aluminum factory was used to stage the closing funeral scene . 
 Sanders drew inspiration for the shooting style and aesthetic of the commercial from a variety of sources , including news footage from journalists embedded with military forces in Afghanistan , and Russian feature films such as Stalker and Come and See . To keep the details within the commercial consistent with established Halo canon , the creators of the Halo series , Bungie Studios , provided Sanders with information on aspects ranging from appropriate fur color and rank insignia for the Brute , to the armor and weaponry of the ODST soldiers .

 With filming complete , MJZ contacted post @-@ production company Asylum to begin work on the substantial visual effects component of The Life . The team , led by Visual Effects Supervisor Robert Moggach , tripled in size as the scale of the work required became apparent , given the deadline of three weeks . Work on the opening funeral scene was relatively easy , requiring the creation of only minor elements such as additional tombstones in the foreground and color correction on the actors . The same was true for the training sequence , where only minimal tracking work and compositing of matte backgrounds was required . The bulk of the visual effects work was in the battle sequence . This ranged from simple work such as wire removal to the creation of dynamic lighting and reflections from visors and armor , to particle effects for the background smoke and dust , plasma weapon fire and alterations to some of the filmed explosions to lend them the appearance given to plasma explosions within the Halo games . The entire background was a 3D projection of matte paintings and dramatic skies . While the Brute was partially animatronic , substantial adjustments such as scaling to almost twice the size and the enhancement of fine muscle movements of the creature were made . Other elements , such as the Banshee aircraft and the drop @-@ pods , were created entirely through the use of CGI . Software used by Asylum FX included Flame and Nuke for compositing , Maya for animation , RenderMan and Mantra for rendering , <unk> for tracking , Silhouette Pro for rotoscoping work .

 The Life was scored by Gareth Williams , a composer for Human Worldwide . The music , an arrangement of Light of Aidan 's " Lament " , was created specifically for the ad , and featured a wide variety of instruments . Percussive elements included military snare drums , a hand drum , Samoan log drums and stones tapped against one another . These were joined by a Great Highland Bagpipe and traditional string orchestration such as a double bass and cello . Vocals were provided by Kathy Fisher who , despite not being a native speaker of the language , sang the Welsh lyrics provided by Williams .

 The Life premiered online as a 90 @-@ second cut on September 4 , 2009 , on both the social networking website MySpace and news and review website IGN . This was followed by its first appearance on U.S. national television as a 150 @-@ second spot three days later , during a commercial break in Spike 's airing of the World War II miniseries Band of Brothers . Additional 90 @-@ second spaces were purchased on a variety of television networks , including Adult Swim , Comedy Central , ESPN , FX , G4 , History , and Spike . The Life was made available for download through Xbox Live on September 8 , and continued to air on television through the release of Halo 3 : ODST on September 22 , 2009 and into the Christmas period . The launch was accompanied by print advertisements and a new interactive website featuring a making @-@ of documentary for The Life , interviews with the director and other crew members , and an unaired scene cut from the ending of the commercial , as well as interactive elements exploring features of the game itself , such as an " evaluation " application offering profiles on several of the game 's characters . 
 Upon its release on September 22 , Halo 3 : ODST immediately became the best @-@ selling title for the Xbox 360 worldwide . Within two weeks , over 2 @.@ 5 million copies had been sold . The Life went on to win a number of awards from the advertising and television industries , including honors from the Visual Effects Society Awards , the ANDY Awards , the London International Advertising Awards , and the Clio Awards .

 = Solar power plants in the Mojave Desert = 
 There are several solar power plants in the Mojave Desert which supply power to the electricity grid . <unk> ( solar radiation ) in the Mojave Desert is among the best available in the United States , and some significant population centers are located in the area . These plants can generally be built in a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular , readily available materials . Solar Energy Generating Systems ( SEGS ) is the name given to nine solar power plants in the Mojave Desert which were built in the 1980s , the first commercial solar plant . These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts ( MW ) which made them the largest solar power installation in the world , until Ivanpah Solar Power Facility was finished in 2014 . 
 Nevada Solar One is a solar thermal plant with a 64 MW generating capacity , located near Boulder City , Nevada . The Copper Mountain Solar Facility is a 150 MW photovoltaic power plant in Boulder City , Nevada . The Ivanpah Solar Power Facility is a 370 MW facility which consists of three separate solar thermal power plants just off interstate highway 15 on the Nevada @-@ California border in the Mojave Desert . There are also plans to build other large solar plants in the Mojave Desert . 
 = = Overview = = 
 The southwestern United States is one of the world 's best areas for insolation , and the Mojave Desert receives up to twice the sunlight received in other regions of the country . This abundance of solar energy makes solar power plants a cleaner alternative to traditional power plants , which burn fossil fuels such as oil and coal . Solar power stations provide an environmentally benign source of energy , produce virtually no emissions , and consume no fuel other than sunlight . Some groups are also encouraging more distributed generation , or rooftop solar . 
 In 2008 , solar electricity was not cost competitive with bulk , baseload power . However , it does provide electricity when and where power is most limited and most expensive , which is a strategic contribution . Solar electricity mitigates the risk of fuel @-@ price volatility and improves grid reliability . Since then costs have decreased to make solar electricity increasingly competitive . 
 While many of the costs of fossil fuels are well known , others ( pollution related health problems , environmental degradation , the impact on national security from relying on foreign energy sources ) are indirect and difficult to calculate . These are traditionally external to the pricing system , and are thus often referred to as externalities . A corrective pricing mechanism , such as a carbon tax , could lead to renewable energy , such as solar thermal power , becoming cheaper to the consumer than fossil fuel based energy . 
 Solar thermal power plants can generally be built in a few years because solar plants are built almost entirely with modular , readily available materials . In contrast , many types of conventional power projects , especially coal and nuclear plants , require long lead times .

 Solar power towers use thousands of individual sun @-@ tracking mirrors ( called <unk> ) to reflect solar energy onto a central receiver located on top of a tall tower . The receiver collects the sun 's heat in a heat @-@ transfer fluid that flows through the receiver . The U.S. Department of Energy , with a consortium of utilities and industry , built the first two large @-@ scale , demonstration solar power towers in the desert near Barstow , California . 
 Solar One operated successfully from 1982 to 1988 , proving that solar power towers work efficiently to produce utility @-@ scale power from sunlight . The Solar One plant used water / steam as the heat @-@ transfer fluid in the receiver ; this presented several problems in terms of storage and continuous turbine operation . To address these problems , Solar One was upgraded to Solar Two , which operated from 1996 to 1999 . Both systems had a 10 MW power capacity . 
 The unique feature of Solar Two was its use of molten salt to capture and store the sun 's heat . The very hot salt was stored and used when needed to produce steam to drive a turbine / generator that produces electricity . The system operated smoothly through intermittent clouds and continued generating electricity long into the night . Solar Two was decommissioned in 1999 , and was converted by the University of California , Davis , into an Air Cherenkov Telescope in 2001 , measuring gamma rays hitting the atmosphere . 
 = = = Solar Energy Generating Systems = = = 
 Trough systems predominate among today 's commercial solar power plants . Nine separate trough power plants , called Solar Energy Generating Systems ( SEGS ) , were built in the 1980s in the Mojave Desert near Barstow by the Israeli company BrightSource Energy ( formerly Luz Industries ) . These plants have a combined capacity of 354 MW . <unk> says that the solar plants power 232 @,@ 500 homes ( during the day , at peak power ) and displace 3 @,@ 800 tons of pollution per year that would have been produced if the electricity had been provided by fossil fuels , such as oil . 
 Trough systems convert the heat from the sun into electricity . Because of their parabolic shape , trough collectors can focus the sun at 30 @-@ 60 times its normal intensity on a receiver pipe located along the focal line of the trough . Synthetic oil circulates through the pipe and captures this heat , reaching temperatures of 390 ° C ( 735 ° F ) . The hot oil is pumped to a generating station and routed through a heat exchanger to produce steam . Finally , electricity is produced in a conventional steam turbine . The SEGS plants operate on natural gas on cloudy days or after dark , and natural gas provides 25 % of the total output .

 The Desert Sunlight Solar Farm is a 550 megawatt ( MWAC ) photovoltaic power station approximately six miles north of Desert Center , California , in the Mojave Desert . It uses approximately 8 @.@ 8 million cadmium telluride modules made by the US thin @-@ film manufacturer First Solar . As of Fall 2015 , the Solar Farm has the same 550 MW installed capacity as the Topaz Solar Farm in the Carrizo Plain region of Central California , making both of them tied for the second largest completed solar plants by installed capacity . 
 = = = Nevada Solar One = = = 
 Nevada Solar One has a 64 @-@ MW generating capacity and is located in Boulder City , Nevada . It was built by the U.S. Department of Energy , National Renewable Energy Laboratory , and Acciona Solar . 
 Nevada Solar One uses parabolic troughs as thermal solar concentrators , heating tubes of liquid which act as solar receivers . These solar receivers are specially coated tubes made of glass and steel , and about 19 @,@ 300 of these four meter long tubes are used in the plant . Nevada Solar One also uses a technology that collects extra heat by putting it into phase @-@ changing molten salts , which enable energy to be drawn at night . Using thermal energy storage systems , solar thermal operating periods can even be extended to meet baseload needs . Solar thermal power plants designed for solar @-@ only generation are well matched to summer noon peak loads in prosperous areas with significant cooling demands , such as the south @-@ western United States . 
 The cost of Nevada Solar One is in the range of $ 220 – 250 million . The power produced is slightly more expensive than wind power , but was less than photovoltaic ( PV ) power . As photovoltaics became less expensive , some proposed CSP projects have been converted to photovoltaics projects .

 When considering land use impacts associated with the exploration and extraction through to transportation and conversion of fossil fuels , which are used for most of our electrical power , utility @-@ scale solar power compares as one of the most land @-@ efficient energy resources available : 
 The federal government has dedicated nearly 2 @,@ 000 times more acreage to oil and gas leases than to solar development . In 2010 the Bureau of Land Management approved nine large @-@ scale solar projects , with a total generating capacity of 3 @,@ 682 megawatts , representing approximately 40 @,@ 000 acres . In contrast , in 2010 , the Bureau of Land Management processed more than 5 @,@ 200 applications gas and oil leases , and issued 1 @,@ 308 leases , for a total of 3 @.@ 2 million acres . Currently , 38 @.@ 2 million acres of onshore public lands and an additional 36 @.@ 9 million acres of offshore exploration in the Gulf of Mexico are under lease for oil and gas development , exploration and production . 
 Some of the land in the eastern Mojave Desert will be preserved , but the solar industry is mainly interested in areas of the western desert , " where the sun burns hotter and there is easier access to transmission lines " , said Kenn J. <unk> of FPL Energy , a view shared by many industry executives . 
 = = Water use issues = = 
 Concentrating solar plants in the Mojave Desert have brought up issues of water use , because concentrating solar power plants with wet @-@ cooling systems have high water @-@ consumption intensities compared to other types of electric power plants ; only fossil @-@ fuel plants with carbon @-@ capture and storage may have higher water intensities . A 2013 study comparing various sources of electricity found that the median water consumption during operations of concentrating solar power plants with wet cooling was 810 ga / MWhr for power tower plants and 890 gal / MWhr for trough plants . This was higher than the operational water consumption ( with cooling towers ) for nuclear ( 720 gal / MWhr ) , coal ( 530 gal / MWhr ) , or natural gas ( 210 ) . A 2011 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory came to similar conclusions : for power plants with cooling towers , water consumption during operations was 865 gal / MWhr for CSP trough , 786 gal / MWhr for CSP tower , 687 gal / MWhr for coal , 672 gal / MWhr for nuclear , and 198 gal / MWhr for natural gas . The Solar Energy Industries Association noted that the Nevada Solar One trough CSP plant consumes 850 gal / MWhr . 
 In 2007 , the US Congress directed the Department of Energy to report on ways to reduce water consumption by CSP . The subsequent report noted that dry cooling technology was available that , although more expensive to build and operate , could reduce water consumption by CSP by 91 to 95 percent , bringing their consumption below that of conventional power plants . A hybrid wet / dry cooling system could reduce water consumption by 32 to 58 percent . A 2015 report by NREL noted that of the 24 operating CSP power plants in the US , 17 used wet @-@ cooling systems . The four existing CSP plants with dry @-@ cooled systems were the three power plants at the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility near Barstow , California , and the Genesis Solar Energy Project in Riverside County , California . Of 15 CSP projects under construction or development in the US as of March 2015 , 6 planned to use wet systems ( including one wet system using reclaimed wastewater ) , 7 planned for dry systems , 1 hybrid , and 1 unspecified .

 Some concentrated solar power plants with power tower designs in the Mojave Desert have come under scrutiny for bird mortality . Birds flying too close to the focal point of the mirrors have been observed bursting into flame in mid @-@ air . Some plant employees called the burning birds " streamers . " The rate of bird deaths at the CSP plants has been a matter of contention . The birds deaths at the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility drew critical media attention in 2014 . The Center for Biological Diversity hired biologist Shawn Smallwood to estimate bird mortality at the Ivanpah plant . In what he called a " back of the napkin " estimate , due to limited data available , Smallwood arrived at 28 @,@ 380 bird deaths per year caused by Ivanpah .

 Min began her journalism career in 1991 as a reporter for The Reporter @-@ Dispatch in Westchester County , New York . She covered the crime beat , as well as local school board and planning committee meetings , among other topics . 
 Min joined People magazine in 1993 as a staff writer . She did not have an interest in celebrity gossip , but was looking for a job and had a friend that worked there . At first , Min struggled at People . According to one of her former coworkers , she was a " poor writer " . Paula Chin , then @-@ senior editor of the magazine , mentored her . Min became better suited for the position as People began to focus on lighter stories . She covered fashion for the " Style Watch " section , which became a regular weekly feature . Min was promoted to senior editor in 1997 . 
 After five years at People , Min left the paper and briefly joined Life Magazine as the assistant managing editor . According to Adweek , she was " bored and miserable " at Life , because of the slower pace of a monthly publication . Min left in 1998 , after less than a year at Life , to work for InStyle under the same job title . There she led the development of InStyle Weddings and InStyle Makeover . In 2001 , Min quit InStyle and started looking for another position .

 In 2002 , Min applied for the editor @-@ in @-@ chief position at Us Weekly and was instead hired as an executive editor under Bonnie Fuller , who became editor @-@ in @-@ chief . The following July , Fuller resigned and Min was appointed to take her place . 
 According to The New York Times , Min turned Us Weekly into one of the magazine industry 's " major success stories " . Public interest in celebrity news was growing , as was the magazine 's circulation . In her role at US Weekly , Min had a significant impact on popular culture and was influential in creating an industry for celebrity gossip . For example , Us Weekly was largely responsible for the popularity of the reality TV show about a couple with eight children , Jon & Kate Plus 8 , after it featured John and Kate on the cover of eight sequential issues . Min focused much of the publication 's editorial on reality TV stars , rather than actors and singers . According to Adweek , Min positioned celebrities as the reader 's friend who " can take a little good @-@ natured ribbing " and fostered more cooperative relationships with celebrities . According to Elle , Min depicted celebrities as people that " may make dumb , even craven , moves , but are never villains " . According to The Los Angeles Times , Min " softened the tone and made it much more friendly to stars " . Min also created a calmer environment in the workplace , which had previously been dramatic and contentious . Under Min 's tenure , the publication 's circulation grew from 800 @,@ 000 copies per week in 2000 to 1 @.@ 9 million by 2009 . 
 Min had negotiated a contract that partially tied her compensation to the number of magazines sold . As distribution increased , her salary peaked at $ 2 million a year . She left in August 2009 as her contract was up for renewal and ad revenues at the publication were decreasing . For her work at US Weekly , Min was named <unk> magazine 's Editor of the Year . While in @-@ between jobs , Min received job offers from women 's magazines , but was not interested . She spent ten months with her family . 
 Min was influential in creating an interest in celebrity pregnancies in popular culture through her work at Us Weekly . Shortly after she left , Min got a deal with St. James Press to write a book , How to Look Hot in a <unk> : A Real Woman 's Guide to Losing Weight , Looking Great , and Dressing Chic in the Age of the Celebrity Mom . In August 2012 , she wrote a column in The New York Times complaining about unrealistic weight and beauty expectations for new moms , set by celebrities . She was criticized in blogs and social media for criticizing an aspect of popular culture she helped establish . Min said the magazine was responding to reader interests , not creating them .

 In December 2009 , the CEO of Prometheus Global Media , Richard Beckman , acquired The Hollywood Reporter . According to The Daily Beast , The Hollywood Reporter was " in a death spiral " . It had become too friendly to the celebrities it covered and was losing readership to competitor Daily Variety . After seeing in The New York Post that Min was moving to Los Angeles , Beckman began courting her to lead the publication 's turnaround . She was named editorial director of The Hollywood Reporter in May 2010 . 
 Four months after Min took the position , The Hollywood Reporter was re @-@ launched as a weekly , glossy magazine . She focused the publication 's editorial on in @-@ depth feature stories and visuals . According to The New York Times , " she published 3 @,@ 000 @-@ word profiles of and about Hollywood , plus plenty of juicy photo galleries and lighter items " as opposed to " quick blurbs about comings and goings " . She avoided the re @-@ written press releases and industry jargon that were common in prior issues . Some of the subjects upon which she focused included box office numbers , controversies , fashion and personal celebrity news . Min created art and photography departments and hired more journalists . The publication also began hosting Oscar and Emmy award parties for nominees . 
 Min led the modernization of the publication 's website as well . The Hollywood Reporter 's web traffic increased 800 percent under her tenure at the publication and revenue increased 50 percent . 
 In January 2014 , Min was promoted to co @-@ president / chief creative officer of the Entertainment Group of Guggenheim Media . In this role she became the head of both The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard . Billboard was still considered the most reputable magazine in the music industry , but it was losing readers and writers due to a tumult in the music industry . Min was appointed in order to lead a similar turnaround as the one she facilitated at The Hollywood Reporter .

 = Munneswaram temple = 
 Munneswaram temple ( Sinhalese : <unk> ් <unk> ් <unk> ් <unk> , Tamil : <unk> ் <unk> ் <unk> ் ) is an important regional Hindu temple complex in Sri Lanka . It has been in existence at least since 1000 CE , although myths surrounding the temple associate it with the popular Indian epic Ramayana , and its legendary hero @-@ king Rama . The temple is one of the ancient Pancha <unk> dedicated to Shiva in the region . 
 The temple complex is a collection of five temples , including a Buddhist temple . The central temple dedicated to Shiva ( Siva ) is the most prestigious and biggest , and is popular amongst Hindus . The other temples are dedicated to Ganesha , Ayyanayake and Kali . The Kali temple is also popular with Buddhists , who frequent the complex . Post @-@ 19th century , most of the devotees of all temples in the complex belong to the majority Sinhala Buddhist ethnic group ; the temples , excluding the Ayyanayake and the Buddhist temple , are administered by families belonging to the minority Hindu Tamils . 
 The temple is located in Munneswaram , a village with mixed Sinhala and Tamil population situated in the historic <unk> Pattuva ( " Tamil division " ) region in the Puttalam District . The main Shiva temple owns extensive property in the surrounding villages , ownership of which was affirmed when the region was part of the medieval Kotte Kingdom . The temple was destroyed twice by the Portuguese colonial officers , who handed over the properties to the Jesuits . Although the Jesuits built a Catholic chapel over the temple foundation , locals reconstructed the temple both times . Due to religious and demographic change after the late 18th century , most surrounding villages and towns are not directly associated with the temple administration and maintenance . However , the villages of Maradankulama and <unk> are associated with organizing the main temple festival . 
 The main festivals celebrated at the temple include <unk> and Sivarathri . The former is a nine @-@ day long festival in honour of the presiding Goddess , while the latter is an overnight observation in honour of Lord Shiva . In addition to these two Hindu festivals , the temple has a festival of its own , the Munneswaram festival , a four @-@ week @-@ long event attended by Hindus and Buddhists . 
 = = History = = 
 Munneswaram temple is situated in Munneswaram village , the center of the spiritual and religious life of the people dwelling in a medieval administrative division called Munneswaram Pattuva ( " Munneswaram division " ) . For most of the temple 's existence , Munneswaram Pattuva has had over 60 villages for which Maradankulama provided political leadership . The Pattuva belonged to an even bigger medieval division called <unk> Pattuva ruled by semi @-@ independent Tamil chiefs subject to Sinhalese kingdoms . The presiding deity is called Sri <unk> ( " Lord of antiquity " alluding to its ancient roots ) and the goddess is called Sri <unk> Devi ( " goddess of beautiful form " another name for Mother goddess <unk> ) . 
 The temple has historically been associated with the nearby pearling and fishing town of Chilaw , as well as the landed gentry of the surrounding villages who provided the resources to maintain the temple . Proximity to the trading routes and to the port provided an opportunity for transmission of ideas and people from India to Sri Lanka . The Pattuva has many temples dedicated to the higher echelons of Hindu or Buddhist deities , and to village guardian deities such <unk> or Ayyanayake , <unk> , Kadavara and Bandara . Anthropologist Rohan Bastin speculates that the main Siva temple was once a minor shrine dedicated to village guardian deity <unk> that was transformed into a major Siva temple due to royal patronage . The temple was already an established temple by the 11th century CE , as it had issued coins by then . The temple began under the patronage of Pattuva chiefs and was probably constructed during the early part of the 10th century CE . A ferry transported traders , pilgrims and chroniclers such as Ibn Battuta from <unk> temple , <unk> <unk> to the Chera and Chola kingdoms of Tamilakam , stopping at Puttalam of the Jaffna kingdom and sailing the Gulf of Mannar during the 14th century CE . 
 The Siva temple is historically attested in grants and in local literature . The Kali temple is a popular sorcery and cursing shrine associated with animal sacrifices and spirit possession . Spirit possession of devotees was noted by the Jesuit priests who left behind records of it in the 16th century . The temple dedicated to the Sinhala deity Ayyanayake ( <unk> to the Tamils ) is administered by a local Sinhalese family . The Buddhist temple <unk> Vihara is a post @-@ 19th century CE addition . The Ganesha temple , located to the south west of the main temple is the newest amongst the Hindu temples and was built during the early 19th century by artisans from South India . 
 Munneswaram , along with Koneswaram ( Trincomalee ) , <unk> ( <unk> ) , <unk> ( Mannar ) and Rameswaram ( India ) , forms the five ancient temples ( <unk> ) dedicated to Shiva in the region including Sri Lanka .
