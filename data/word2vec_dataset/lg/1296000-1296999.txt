 ODST 's visuals and atmosphere were praised . McShea wrote that while the Halo 3 engine was showing its age , the game could still " wow " because of the art design . Parish wrote that the feel of Mombasa changed dramatically when played cooperatively ; G4TV found that additional players spoiled much of the solitary feel . Travis Moses of GamePro wrote that while the game 's graphics were consistently outclassed by other shooters , the game 's frame rate remained consistently high as expected from Halo games . Technology company <unk> said that , despite welcome improvements in AI , the main flaws from Halo 3 's graphics engine — namely a sub @-@ 720p native resolution and lower @-@ quality human faces — remained . 
 The game 's audio and sound were lauded . McCaffrey wrote that while the music of Halo 3 was " too familiar " , ODST had freed O 'Donnell to " craft his best work yet " , which the critic considered good enough for a standalone purchase . A significant departure from the consensus was offered by Kuchera , who wrote that the saxophone touches " [ sound ] like the softcore porn they show on Cinemax after midnight " , and GameSpy 's Anthony Gallegos , who felt that the music did not mesh when extended into combat segments . 
 Firefight was praised as " addictive " , especially for showcasing the excellent artificial intelligence of enemies . Jeff Marchiafava of Game Informer credited the enemies with differentiating Firefight from similar game modes in games such as Gears of War 2 or Left 4 Dead , which featured mindless zombies or cannon fodder . The staff of Official Xbox Magazine UK wrote that the gametype 's depth and options made Gears of War 's comparable mode look " simple " in comparison , and that Firefight extended the life of the game . In contrast , Bramwell felt that in Firefight " there is both a sense of futility in the knowledge that death is only a matter of time and odds , and fatigue in the realisation that many levels play out just as they did in the campaign , except a bit more so " . 
 Interviewed by G4TV , Bungie representatives saw part of the mixed and negative reception as stemming from their own marketing of the title — first as an expansion pack , then a full game . " If you look at the lower scores , they almost all cite an issue in perceived value based on an initial expectation that was set for an ' expansion ' and then a feeling that they were overcharged for the final product , " Jarrad said , echoing Staten 's comment that " if we 'd never said the words ' expansion pack ' we would have seen an appreciable increase in the review scores " . Other elements they wish they had improved had they the time were the pacing and navigation of the nighttime segments and matchmaking for Firefight . Halo manager 343 Industries director Frank O 'Connor said that he was glad ODST " didn 't take off " , in his view , because it allowed people to focus on Reach and its launch and marketing .

 Lev Grossman and Peter Ha ranked ODST as the eighth best game of the year for Time , lauding the game as " a dark , slow , jazzy , hard @-@ boiled take on the Halo world " . Softpedia branded ODST the best first @-@ person shooter of the year ; games editor Andrei <unk> wrote that while the game occasionally felt formulaic , it was bolstered by a good plot , great music , and supporting characters that players could care about . Chris Kohler from Wired ranked ODST as the third best Xbox 360 title of the year , writing that the game " injected a fresh breath into the staid corridors of Bungie 's shooter franchise " . Halo 3 : ODST also won " Best Original Score " at the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards . " The Life " was a finalist in the " Outstanding Visual Effects in a Video Game Trailer " category by the Visual Effects Society in the group 's eighth annual awards .

 Omar Derdour ( Arabic : عمر <unk> ) , full name Abou El <unk> Omar Derdour ( 13 October 1913 – 19 March 2009 ) , was an Algerian Muslim leader , nationalist , and political worker . 
 A disciple of Abdelhamid Ben Badis , he was active in the Islamic reformation of Algeria and the Algerian War of Independence . He directed the Friends of the Manifesto and Liberty Party 's ( in French : Amis du Manifeste et de la Liberté , AML ) Federation in Constantine , and was a member of the Central Committee and Deputy of the Constantine region from 1947 to 1951 . 
 In 1954 , Omar Derdour became a political worker within the National Liberation Front ( FLN ) and undertook a great deal of propaganda and mobilization in France in 1955 and 1956 and then in Cairo , Egypt and throughout the Arab world . After independence , Omar Derdour devoted himself to teaching , became a founding member of the Islamic Institute , and founded numerous other Muslim institutions and schools . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Derdour was born on 13 October 1913 in <unk> , a small village in the municipality of <unk> El Abed , in the heart of the Aurès Mountains . He was born into a family of scholars which hailed from the <unk> Abdi Valley in that mountain region . The village lies He learned the Quran in his great @-@ grandfather 's <unk> ( a Maghrebi Islamic school ) . Derdour went to Tolga where he studied at the school of Sheikh Ali bin Omar for two years , and was given a thorough Islamic education in language and jurisprudence . 
 In 1932 Sheikh Abdul Hafiz al @-@ Hashemi took Omar Derdour to Constantine and introduced him to Sheikh Imam Abdelhamid Ben Badis , who agreed to accept him as a pupil on the condition that he passed an examination . In 1933 Derdour joined the " Green Mosque " ( <unk> El Akhdar ) and began studying under Sheikh Abdelhamid Ben Badis . He would remain there for seven years . In 1934 , Ben Badis appointed Derdour teacher in the two mosques of Sidi <unk> and Sidi <unk> in Constantine . In 1936 , he became the close assistant of Ben Badis in organizing the courses .

 In 1936 Omar Derdour and a group of fellow students founded a division of the Algerian Muslim Scholars Association and became active in education in the fields of religious and national awareness . In 1937 , Derdour returned to his village to establish a madrasa for the education of children and adults . Ben Badis considered him the " soul of the <unk> movement in the Aures " . At the end of 1937 , the French authorities became aware of his activities and imprisoned him in Batna for " inciting the population to civil disobedience " . Derdour was released on 6 January 1938 , but was imprisoned a second time in August 1939 to complete his four @-@ month sentence and was fined 8 @,@ 000 francs .

 Omar Derdour directed the AML Party 's Federation in Constantine , and was a member of the Central Committee and Deputy of the Constantine region from 1947 until 1951 . The purpose of the AML party was to publicize and defend the Manifest du Peuple <unk> ; anti @-@ French , it demanded equal rights for the Muslim population and an autonomous Algeria federated with France , the colonial power . Between July 1955 and January 1956 he lived in Vichy , France , working with the National Liberation Front ( FLN ) on defining the objectives and approach of the revolution . Derdour moved to Cairo , meeting Sheikh Mohammed Bashir <unk> and other members of the Revolutionary Command . He was given the task of travelling to the Arab countries to raise support for the Algerian revolution . Derdour was based in Cairo until he moved to Tunisia in 1960 . He taught soldiers on the Algerian border until independence was achieved in 1962 .

 = Operation Swath @-@ 10 = 
 Operation Swath @-@ 10 ( Croatian : Operacija Otkos @-@ 10 ) was a military offensive undertaken by the Croatian Army ( Hrvatska vojska , or HV ) against the SAO Western Slavonia Territorial Defense Forces on Bilogora Mountain in western Slavonia . Occurring from 31 October to 4 November 1991 , during the Croatian War of Independence , the operation was a Croatian victory and its success set the stage for follow @-@ up advances by Croatian forces on Papuk Mountain in Operation Papuk @-@ 91 in late November and December . By the end of the year the HV gained control of Papuk , securing transport routes between eastern Slavonia and the rest of Croatia . 
 The offensives were accompanied by the displacement of most of the Croatian Serb population of the area captured by the HV . The refugees initially fled to Bosnia and Herzegovina , but the majority were soon settled in the Yugoslav People 's Army @-@ held Baranja region of eastern Croatia . The offensive provoked accusations that Croatian troops had committed ethnic cleansing and civil @-@ rights abuses ; these accusations were disproven by a European Community Monitor Mission ( ECMM ) report after an ECMM team tour of the area captured by Croatian forces two days after the offensive ended . During Operation Papuk @-@ 91 the retreating paramilitary White Eagles perpetrated the Voćin massacre , and its war crimes were prosecuted at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the 1991 Yugoslav campaign in Croatia , the 5th ( Banja Luka ) Corps of the Yugoslav People 's Army ( Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija , or JNA ) was tasked with advancing north through western Slavonia from Okučani to Daruvar and Virovitica and with a secondary drive from Okučani towards Kutina . This was essentially consistent with the line expected to be reached by the main thrust of the JNA , advancing from eastern Slavonia in about a week . The link was designed to facilitate a further advance west , to Zagreb and Varaždin . The corps had deployed a battlegroup of the 265th Mechanised Brigade near Okučani , supporting an advance which began on 21 September and reached the Papuk Mountains . The corps received one artillery and two motorised brigades as reinforcements during the advance , but the desertion and morale problems experienced by the JNA elsewhere also existed in the Banja Luka Corps . 
 The JNA was stopped by the Croatian National Guard ( Zbor Narodne Garde , or ZNG ) between Novska , Nova Gradiška and Pakrac , although SAO Western Slavonia Territorial Defense Forces ( Teritorijalna <unk> , or TO ) units took up positions on the Bilogora and Papuk north of Pakrac ( near Virovitica and Slatina ) with no JNA support . The capture of Ivanovo Selo , seven kilometres ( 4 @.@ 3 miles ) east of Grubišno Polje and eight kilometres ( 5 @.@ 0 miles ) north of Daruvar , on 21 September marked the territorial peak of the TO @-@ held area on the Bilogora . The village was recaptured by the ZNG the same day , with seven dead and fifteen wounded . 
 On 1 October , the Banja Luka Corps began probing attacks in the region before a major effort with most of the corps three days later . The advance established defensive positions just outside Novska and Nova Gradiška . On 6 October Pakrac was briefly isolated when the JNA captured <unk> four kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 miles ) ( northwest of the town ) , blocking the last road available to supply the town . The ZNG recaptured the village the same day , driving the JNA back six kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 miles ) at a cost of 22 killed . The JNA captured Jasenovac on 8 October ; Lipik and part of Pakrac were captured four days later . By then , the JNA offensive in western Slavonia had lost momentum and the ZNG made minor advances north of Novska and west of Nova Gradiška on 13 and 16 October . Croatian authorities no longer considered the war situation critical , issuing an order to plan a counter @-@ offensive for 15 October . On 29 October , the ZNG launched Operation Hurricane @-@ 91 against positions held by the JNA and the TO near Novska and Nova Gradiška . 
 = = Order of battle = = 
 The TO forces in the Bilogora Mountain region were officially part of the 28th Partisan Division , commanded by Colonel Nikola Marić . In reality , they comprised about 1 @,@ 750 soldiers , eight armoured vehicles , ten cannons and twelve mortars . The TO force was organised into two battalions , headquartered in the villages of Mali Grđevac and Velika Peratovica and commanded by Rade <unk> . North of the TO @-@ held area , the ZNG deployed the 127th Infantry Brigade in the Virovitica area . In the Grubišno Polje area south of the Bilogora , the ZNG force was subordinate to the 57th Independent Battalion ( later renamed the 77th Independent Battalion ) . The attacking ZNG force , under Colonel Franjo Kovačević , consisted of 2 @,@ 647 troops supported by twelve armoured vehicles , eighteen cannons and twenty 120 @-@ millimetre ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) mortars — surpassing the defending TO force in every respect except for the close air support of the TO by the Yugoslav Air Force . The ZNG originally planned to deploy the 105th Infantry Brigade and the Omega special @-@ police company from Bjelovar , but the units were needed elsewhere and unavailable for the offensive . 
 = = Timeline = = 
 Operation Swath @-@ 10 ( also known as Bilogora ' 91 ) was planned by the Croatians to regain control of the Virovitica – Lončarica – Grubišno Polje road , cutting off and destroying the TO forces deployed in the area of the road ( the northernmost part of western Slavonia captured by the TO or the JNA ) . Those objectives were also designed to deny the Banja Luka Corps support if it attempted to break through towards Virovitica ; control the last remaining supply route between Zagreb and Slavonia ; shorten the Croatian defensive positions , and improve troop and civilian morale . The offensive was originally scheduled for 15 October , but was postponed for two weeks due to the unavailability of the 105th Infantry Brigade and the special police . The plan of operation called for the ZNG to first cut off the two TO battalions on the Bilogora Mountain within 48 hours , with the second stage of the offensive destroying the trapped TO force . The operation was authorised by Colonel Miroslav <unk> , commander of Bjelovar Operational Zone , on 7 October . 
 The offensive was launched at 6 am on 31 October , with a 50 @-@ minute artillery bombardment followed by a ZNG advance in three groups : the 57th Independent Battalion from the south , the 127th Infantry Brigade from the north and the 1st Battalion of the 127th Infantry Brigade from the northwest . That day the ZNG captured the villages of Velika Barna , Gornja <unk> and Zrinska , northwest of the Grubišno Polje – Veliki Grđevac road , securing Grubišno Polje . The ZNG also advanced along the Virovitica – Grubišno Polje road , arriving at the outskirts of Mala Peratovica ( four kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 miles ) east of Grubišno Polje ) and approaching Lončarica ( eleven kilometres ( 6 @.@ 8 miles ) south of Virovitica ) . The TO forces put up a strong resistance ( especially near Lončarica ) , although the battlefield situation was described as hopeless . The TO requested close air support from the Yugoslav Air Force , and four to six aircraft were deployed in response . 
 On 1 November the ZNG conducted mopping @-@ up operations in the areas northwest of Grubišno Polje , and the following day the TO force began retreating towards Papuk Mountain . Lončarica and <unk> Brđani ( a village about two kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 miles ) northeast of Mala Peratovica , along the Virovitica – Grubišno Polje road ) were captured by the Croatian force on 3 November after they overcame strong TO resistance . That day , the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army ( Hrvatska vojska , or HV ) . After the villages were captured , HV forces advancing from Grubišno Polje and Virovitica met ; the HV captured the village of Velika Peratovica , which was isolated by the advances along the Virovitica – Grubišno Polje road and northwest of Grubišno Polje on the first day of the offensive . On 4 November the operation was declared finished , after the HV secured the area .

Two days later the TO counterattacked , killing nine HV troops and wounding about ten more , but the HV defence held . Another effort to recapture Bastajski Brđani was made by the TO , reinforced with 50 paramilitary White Eagles . It failed ( despite being well prepared and supported by artillery ) because the defending HV force was alerted by signals intelligence of the attack and reinforced . The White Eagles lost 46 killed in the battle .

 Operation Papuk @-@ 91 was planned to follow Operation Swath @-@ 10 , advancing south from the Virovitica – Osijek road and clearing the Papuk and Psunj mountains of TO forces ( elements of the 28th Partisan Division ) . The offensive was approved by <unk> at a 23 November meeting in Slatina attended by HV Inspector General Martin Špegelj , Colonel Miljenko <unk> ( commanding officer of the 123rd Infantry Brigade ) , Colonel Đuro <unk> ( commanding officer of the 127th Infantry Brigade ) , Colonel Josip Černi ( commanding officer of the 136th Infantry Brigade ) and commanders of other units tasked with its support . 
 The operation was launched on 28 November ; the HV advanced across a front spanning Grubišno Polje and Orahovica , nearly 60 kilometres ( 37 miles ) east . On 2 December a detachment of the 123rd Infantry Brigade , en route to relieve troops manning a base on the Papuk , was ambushed with eleven soldiers killed . On 10 December the HV advanced to the Psunj Mountain area north of Nova Gradiška in an offensive , codenamed <unk> , which captured the villages of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Vučjak <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . The advance improved the safety of the Nova Gradiška – Požega road and secured the right flank of the Nova Gradiška axis of Operation Hurricane @-@ 91 . 
 From 12 to 15 December the HV captured a cluster of villages around Đulovac , southeast of the area captured in Operation Swath @-@ 10 . The HV units approaching from the east captured Voćin , about ten kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 miles ) southeast of Đulovac , on 14 – 15 December . Voćin and Đulovac were badly damaged by the retreating TO and paramilitary White Eagles , and the latter killed 43 civilians in Voćin on 13 December . The victims ' bodies were mutilated and left unburied , presumably as a warning to others . 
 On 16 December the HV ( in an operation codenamed <unk> ) captured the villages of Gornji <unk> , Kamenski Vučjak and Kamenski <unk> , about 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 miles ) south of Voćin and 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 miles ) west of Velika ; this restricted the TO forces to the southwestern slopes of Papuk Mountain and Psunj Mountain further south . The following day , the HV captured Novo <unk> and a TO supply depot in the village ( halfway between Voćin and Kamenski Vučjak ) in an attack codenamed <unk> . On 18 December the HV advanced southwest from Kamenski Vučjak ( in an advance codenamed <unk> ) , capturing the villages of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Kamenski <unk> and coming within one kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 miles ) of the village of Kamenska ( on the Pakrac – Požega road ) . Over the following three days , the HV performed mopping @-@ up operations in the area . 
 On 21 December , the HV launched an unsuccessful attack ( codenamed <unk> ) on Kamenska and the adjacent village of <unk> . The TO withdrew from the area north of Kamenska ( including the village of <unk> on 24 December ) , retreating from Kamenska and <unk> the next day . HV forces deployed in the Pakrac area ( west of the Papuk and the Psunj ) , advanced east to support Operation Papuk @-@ 91 ( capturing the villages of <unk> , Gornji <unk> , Donji <unk> , Kusonje and <unk> on 24 – 25 December ) and left less than 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 miles ) of the Pakrac – Požega road separating HV units advancing from the west and east . Operation Papuk @-@ 91 ended on 26 December , when forces of the 123rd , the 127th and the 136th Brigades met at Bučje ; the final day 's advance was codenamed Velebit . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Five HV soldiers were killed in the operation and dozens were wounded . Twenty @-@ four JNA personnel and Croatian Serb rebels were also killed , as were 22 Serb civilians . A further 17 Serb civilians were killed in the weeks preceding the operation , in which Croatian forces secured 370 square kilometres ( 140 square miles ) of western Slavonia ( including 21 villages ) . Although the HV secured the Virovitica – Grubišno Polje road , it failed to trap the TO troops deployed to the area . This was later attributed to insufficient manpower : the unavailability of the 105th Infantry Brigade or the 73rd Independent ( Garešnica ) Battalion , which were deployed in Pakrac . The HV positions set the stage for further advances against the SAO Western Slavonia in Operation Papuk @-@ 91 . Some sources conflate Operations Swath @-@ 10 and Papuk @-@ 91 , describing the latter as part of Operation Swath @-@ 10 . Operation Papuk @-@ 91 eliminated the threat to the road connecting eastern Slavonia and Zagreb ; the TO forces were pushed south , placing the road out of artillery range . In Operation Papuk @-@ 91 , the HV captured 110 settlements and 1 @,@ 230 square kilometres ( 470 square miles ) of territory . 
 In 2008 , a monument to HV troops participating in the offensive was unveiled in Grubišno Polje . Another monument was erected on Papuk Mountain to the 11 soldiers from the 123rd Infantry Brigade who were ambushed in Operation Papuk @-@ 91 on 2 December 1991 . Operations Swath @-@ 10 , Papuk @-@ 91 and Hurricane @-@ 91 ( implemented in western Slavonia in late 1991 ) are considered the first offensive liberation operations in the Croatian War of Independence . 
 The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) charged Vojislav Šešelj with a number of war crimes , including the killings by the paramilitary White Eagles in Voćin on 13 December . Although the trial ended in 2012 , as of August 2013 the verdict was pending . Slobodan Milošević , president of Serbia at the time of the killings , was also charged by the ICTY for the crimes in Voćin ; however , Milošević died before his trial ended . 
 = = = Refugees = = = 
 About 4 @,@ 000 Croatian Serb civilians fled the area affected by Operation Swath @-@ 10 . According to Serbian sources , the population began to evacuate on the first day of the offensive ; by the second day , about 800 vehicles had entered Bosnia and Herzegovina . The retreating columns included men of military age who refused to fight . A substantial number of refugees settled in Baranja , in houses owned by displaced Croats . Based on reports of fleeing civilians , the Yugoslav government accused Croatia of ethnic cleansing and other civil @-@ rights violations . Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Mitrović wrote to the European Community Monitor Mission ( ECMM ) , accusing Croatia of personal and property damage and the displacement of Serb civilians . Although the accusations were countered by evacuation plans made by SAO Western Slavonia authorities on 25 October and the testimony of civilians remaining in the area ( that the TO ordered the population to flee , claiming that " the Ustaše are coming [ ... ] and killing every Serb " ) , Serbian media extensively reported alleged atrocities . Reports compared the Croatian offensive to the World War II massacres committed by the Independent State of Croatia . On 3 November the Presidency of Yugoslavia condemned the offensive , citing the destruction of 18 Serb villages , and the following day the National Assembly of Serbia appealed to the international community for help . 
 In response to the situation ( and a request from the Presidency of Yugoslavia ) an ECMM team toured the area affected by the offensive on 6 November , targeting locations where media reports indicated atrocities ; these included Velika Peratovica , Mala Peratovica , Gornja <unk> , Donja <unk> and Lončarica . The 6 November ECMM report refuted the accusations ; although the team found only one Serb couple remaining in the area , they denied claims that the HV mistreated civilians left behind . The ECMM team reported no systematic destruction of houses , although a number of structures had artillery @-@ bombardment damage and a small number of houses , farms and haystacks were recently torched . The team was unable to determine if the HV was to blame , if the villagers avenged SAO Western Krajina leaders or if the destruction was a result of a scorched earth policy by the retreating force . 
 The HV offensives in western Slavonia conducted in late 1991 ( Operations Hurricane @-@ 10 , Swath @-@ 10 and Papuk @-@ 91 ) created a total of 20 @,@ 000 Serb refugees . They fled the area when the JNA ordered Croatian Serb forces to withdraw , and were settled in the JNA @-@ held Baranja region of eastern Croatia . The refugee resettlement coincided with Croatian Serb efforts to change the ethnic composition of the Danube area seized in late 1991 , providing a secondary motive for the expulsion of non @-@ Serb civilians . 
 = = = Ceasefire = = = 
 A 3 January 1992 ceasefire allowed the implementation of the Vance plan , which protected civilians in areas designated as UN Protected Areas ( UNPAs ) and deployed UN peacekeepers in Croatia . One of the UNPAs defined by the plan , UNPA Western Slavonia , encompassed parts of the municipalities of Novska and Nova Gradiška and all of Daruvar , Grubišno Polje and Pakrac . This UNPA covered the area held by the JNA on 3 January , additional territory to the north ( recaptured by the HV in late 1991 ) and towns never under SAO Western Slavonia control ( such as Grubišno Polje and Daruvar ) . The peacekeeping force ( United Nations Protection Force , or UNPROFOR ) , initially expected to be 10 @,@ 000 @-@ strong , began its deployment on 8 March . 
 = Wilhelm Cauer = 
 Wilhelm Cauer ( 24 June 1900 – 22 April 1945 ) was a German mathematician and scientist . He is most noted for his work on the analysis and synthesis of electrical filters and his work marked the beginning of the field of network synthesis . Prior to his work , electronic filter design used techniques which accurately predicted filter behaviour only under unrealistic conditions . This required a certain amount of experience on the part of the designer to choose suitable sections to include in the design . Cauer placed the field on a firm mathematical footing , providing tools that could produce exact solutions to a given specification for the design of an electronic filter . 
 Cauer initially specialised in general relativity but soon switched to electrical engineering . His work for a German subsidiary of the Bell Telephone Company brought him into contact with leading American engineers in the field of filters . This proved useful when Cauer was unable to feed his children during the German economic crisis of the 1920s and he moved to the US . He studied early computer techniques in the US prior to returning to Germany . The rise of Nazism in Germany stifled Cauer 's career because he had a remote Jewish ancestor . Cauer was shot dead during the fall of Berlin by Soviet soldiers . 
 The manuscripts for some of Cauer 's most important unpublished works were destroyed during the war . However , his family succeeded in reconstructing much of this from his notes and volume II of Theorie der <unk> <unk> was published after his death . Cauer 's legacy continues today , with network synthesis being the method of choice for network design . 
 = = Life and career = = 
 = = = Early life and family = = = 
 Wilhelm Adolf Eduard Cauer was born in Berlin , Germany , on 24 June 1900 . He came from a long line of academics . His early grammar school ( gymnasium ) was the Kaiserin Augusta Gymnasium , an institution founded by his great @-@ grandfather , Ludwig Cauer . This school was located on <unk> , named after Ludwig , in the Charlottenburg district of Berlin . The building still exists , but is now a primary school , the Ludwig Cauer <unk> . He later attended the Mommsen Gymnasium , Berlin . His father , also Wilhelm Cauer , was a Privy Councillor and a professor of railway engineering at the Technical University of Berlin . Cauer became interested in mathematics at the age of thirteen and continued to demonstrate that he was academically inclined as he grew . 
 Briefly , Cauer served in the German army in the final stages of World War I. He married Karoline Cauer ( a relation ) in 1925 and eventually fathered six children . 
 = = = Career = = = 
 Cauer started off in a field completely unrelated to filters ; from 1922 he worked with Max von Laue on general relativity , and his first publication ( 1923 ) was in this field . For reasons that are not clear , he changed his field after this to electrical engineering . He graduated in applied physics in 1924 from the Technical University of Berlin . 
 He then spent a period working for Mix & Genest , a branch of the Bell Telephone Company , applying probability theory to telephone switching . He also worked on timer relays . He had two telecommunications @-@ related publications during this period on " Telephone switching systems " and " Losses of real inductors " . 
 The relationship of Mix & Genest with Bell gave Cauer an easy path to collaboration with AT & T 's engineers at Bell Labs in the US which must have been of enormous help when Cauer embarked on a study of filter design . Bell were at the forefront of filter design at this time with the likes of George Campbell in Boston and Otto Zobel in New York making major contributions . However , it was with R. M. Foster that Cauer had much correspondence and it was his work that Cauer recognised as being of such importance . His paper , A reactance theorem , is a milestone in filter theory and inspired Cauer to generalise this approach into what has now become the field of network synthesis . 
 In June 1926 Cauer presented his thesis paper , The realisation of impedances of specified frequency dependence , at the Institute of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics of the Technical University of Berlin . This paper is the beginning of modern network synthesis . 
 In 1927 Cauer went to work as a research assistant at Richard Courant 's Institute of Mathematics at the University of Göttingen . In 1928 he obtained his habilitation and became an external university lecturer . 
 Cauer found that he could not support his family during the economic crisis of the 1920s and in 1930 took his family to the USA where he had obtained a scholarship ( a Rockefeller fellowship ) to study at MIT and Harvard University . He worked with Vannevar Bush who was building machines for the solution of mathematical problems . Essentially , these were what we would now call analogue computers : Cauer was interested in using them to solve linear systems to aid in filter designs . His work on Filter circuits was completed in 1931 while still in the US . 
 Cauer met , and had strong contacts with , many of the key researchers in the field of filter design at Bell Labs . These included Hendrik Bode , George Campbell , Sidney Darlington , Foster and Otto Zobel . 
 For a short while , Cauer worked for the Wired Radio Company in Newark , New Jersey but then returned to Göttingen with the intention of building a fast analogue computer there . However , he was unable to obtain funding due to the depression . 
 Cauer seems to have got on very poorly with his German colleagues . According to Rainer Pauli , his correspondence with them was usually brief and business @-@ like , rarely , if ever , discussing issues in depth . By contrast , his correspondence with his American and European acquaintances was warm , technically deep and often included personal family news and greetings . This correspondence went beyond his American contacts and included A.C. Bartlett of the General Electric Company in Wembley , Roger Julia of <unk> <unk> et <unk> in Paris , mathematicians Gustav <unk> , Georg Pick and Hungarian graph theorist <unk> <unk> . 
 After leaving the Technical Institute for Mix & Genest , Cauer sought to become active in the Verband Deutscher <unk> ( <unk> , the German Electrical Engineers Society ) . He left the <unk> , however , in 1942 after a serious falling out with Wagner , previously his PhD supervisor and ally .

 In <unk> 1933 Cauer signed the Loyalty Oath of German Professors to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist State . 
 The rising force of Nazism became a major obstacle to Cauer 's work from 1933 onwards . The anti @-@ Jewish hysteria of the time forced many academics to leave their posts , including the director of the Mathematics Institute , Richard Courant . Although Cauer was not Jewish , it became known that he had a Jewish ancestor , Daniel <unk> , who had been a banker to Frederick II of Prussia . While this revelation was not sufficient to have Cauer removed under the race laws , it stifled his future career . Thus he gained the title of professor but was never given a chair . 
 By 1935 Cauer had three children whom he was finding increasingly difficult to support , which prompted him to return to industry . In 1936 he temporarily worked for the aircraft manufacturer Fieseler at their Fi 156 Storch works in Kassel and then became director of the laboratory of Mix & Genest in Berlin . Nevertheless , he did continue to lecture at the Technical University in Berlin from 1939 . 
 In 1941 , the first volume of his main work , Theory of Linear AC Circuits was published . The original manuscript to the second volume was destroyed as a result of the war . Although Cauer was able to reproduce this work , he was not able to publish it and it too was lost during the war . Some time after his death , however , his family arranged for the publication of some of his papers as the second volume , based on surviving descriptions of the intended contents of volume II . 
 After taking his children to stay with relatives in <unk> ( in Hesse ) to protect them from the expected fall of Berlin to the Russians , Cauer , against advice , returned to Berlin . His body was located after the end of the war in a mass grave of victims of Russian executions . Cauer had been shot dead in his garden in Berlin @-@ <unk> by Soviet soldiers as a hostage . Soviet Intelligence was actively looking for scientists they could use in their own researches and Cauer was on their list of people to find but it would seem that this was unknown to his executioners . 
 = = Network synthesis = = 
 The major part of Cauer 's legacy is his contribution to the network synthesis of passive networks . Indeed , he is considered the founder of the field and the publication of his principle work in English was enthusiastically greeted , even though this did not happen until seventeen years later ( in 1958 ) . Prior to network synthesis , networks , especially filters , were designed using the image impedance method . The accuracy of predictions of response from such designs depended on accurate impedance matching between sections . This could be achieved with sections entirely internal to the filter but it was not possible to perfectly match to the end terminations . For this reason image filter designers incorporated end sections in their designs of a different form optimised for an improved match rather than filtering response . The choice of form of such sections was more a matter of designer experience than design calculation . Network synthesis entirely did away with the need for this . It directly predicted the response of the filter and included the terminations in the synthesis . 
 Cauer treated network synthesis as being the inverse problem of network analysis . Whereas network analysis asks what is the response of a given network , network synthesis on the other hand asks what are the networks that can produce a given desired response . Cauer solved this problem by comparing electrical quantities and functions to their mechanical equivalents . Then , realising that they were completely analogous , applying the known Lagrangian mechanics to the problem . 
 According to Cauer , there are three major tasks that network synthesis has to address . The first is the ability to determine whether a given transfer function is realisable as an impedance network . The second is to find the canonical ( minimal ) forms of these functions and the relationships ( transforms ) between different forms representing the same transfer function . Finally , it is not , in general , possible to find an exact finite @-@ element solution to an ideal transfer function - such as zero attenuation at all frequencies below a given cutoff frequency and infinite attenuation above . The third task is therefore to find approximation techniques for achieving the desired responses . 
 Initially , the work revolved around one @-@ port impedances . The transfer function between a voltage and a current amounting to the expression for the impedance itself . A useful network can be produced by breaking open a branch of the network and calling that the output . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Following on from Foster , Cauer generalised the relationship between the expression for the impedance of a one @-@ port network and its transfer function . 
 He discovered the necessary and sufficient condition for <unk> of a one @-@ port impedance . That is , those impedance expressions that could actually be built as a real circuit . In later papers he made generalisations to <unk> networks . 
 = = = Transformation = = = 
 Cauer discovered that all solutions for the realisation of a given impedance expression could be obtained from one given solution by a group of affine transformations . 
 He generalised Foster 's ladder realisation to filters which included resistors ( Foster 's were reactance only ) and discovered an isomorphism between all two @-@ element kind networks . 
 He identified the canonical forms of filter realisation . That is , the minimal forms , which includes the ladder networks obtained by Stieltjes 's continued fraction expansion . 
 = = = Approximation = = = 
 He used the Chebyshev approximation to design filters . Cauer 's application of Tchebyscheff polynomials resulted in the filters now known as elliptic filters , or sometimes Cauer filters , which have optimally fast passband to stopband transitions for a given maximum attenuation variation . The well known Chebyshev filters can be viewed as a special case of elliptic filters and can be arrived at using the same approximation techniques . So can the Butterworth ( maximally flat ) filter , although this was an independent discovery by Stephen Butterworth arrived at by a different method . 
 Cauer 's work was initially ignored because his canonical forms made use of ideal transformers . This made his circuits of less practical use to engineers . However , it was soon realised that Cauer 's Tchebyscheff approximation could just as easily be applied to the rather more useful ladder topology and ideal transformers could be dispensed with . From then on network synthesis began to supplant image design as the method of choice . 
 = = = Further work = = = 
 Most of the above work is contained in Cauer 's first and second monographs and is largely a treatment of one @-@ ports . In his habilitation thesis Cauer begins to extend this work by showing that a global canonical form cannot be found in the general case for three @-@ element kind <unk> ( that is , networks containing all three R , L and C elements ) for the generation of realisation solutions , as it can be for the two @-@ element kind case . 
 Cauer extended the work of Bartlett and Brune on geometrically symmetric 2 @-@ ports to all symmetric 2 @-@ ports , that is 2 @-@ ports which are electrically symmetrical but not necessarily topologically symmetrical , finding a number of canonical circuits . He also studied antimetric 2 @-@ ports . He also extended Foster 's theorem to 2 @-@ element LC n @-@ ports ( 1931 ) and showed that all equivalent LC networks could be derived from each other by linear transformations .

 = Kepler @-@ 11 = 
 Kepler @-@ 11 is a Sun @-@ like star slightly larger than the Sun in the constellation Cygnus , located some 2 @,@ 000 light years from Earth . It is located within the field of vision of the Kepler spacecraft , the satellite that NASA 's Kepler Mission uses to detect planets that may be transiting their stars . Announced on February 2 , 2011 , the star system is among the most compact and flattest systems yet discovered . It is the first discovered case of a star system with six transiting planets . All discovered planets are larger than Earth , with the larger ones being about Neptune 's size . 
 = = Nomenclature and history = = 
 Kepler @-@ 11 and its planets were discovered by NASA 's Kepler Mission , a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars . The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars . These dips in brightness can be interpreted as planets whose orbits move in front of their stars from the perspective of Earth . Kepler @-@ 11 is the first discovered exoplanetary system with more than three transiting planets . 
 Kepler @-@ 11 is named for the Kepler Mission : it is the 11th star with confirmed planets discovered in the Kepler field of view . The planets are named alphabetically , starting with the innermost : b , c , d , e , f , and g , <unk> that are tagged onto the name of their home star . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Kepler @-@ 11 is a G @-@ type star that is approximately 96 % the mass of and 107 % the radius of the Sun . It has a surface temperature of about <unk> K and is estimated to have an age of around 8 @.@ 5 billion years . In comparison , the Sun is about 4 @.@ 6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5778 K. 
 The star 's apparent magnitude , or how bright it appears from Earth 's perspective , is 13 @.@ 7 . Therefore , it cannot be seen with the naked eye . 
 = = Planetary system = = 
 All known planets transit the star ; this means that all six planets ' orbits appear to cross in front of their star as viewed from the Earth 's perspective . Their inclinations relative to Earth 's line of sight , or how far above or below the plane of sight they are , vary by a little more than a degree . This allows direct measurements of the planets ' periods and relative diameters ( compared to the host star ) by monitoring each planet 's transit of the star . Simulations suggest that the mean mutual inclinations of the planetary orbits are about 1 ° , meaning the system is probably more coplanar ( flatter ) than the Solar System , where the corresponding figure is 2 @.@ 3 ° . 
 The estimated masses of planets b - f fall in the range between those of Earth and Neptune . Their estimated densities , all lower than that of Earth , imply that none of them have an Earth @-@ like composition ; a significant hydrogen / helium atmosphere is predicted for planets c , d , e , f , and g , while planet b may be surrounded by a steam atmosphere or perhaps by a hydrogen atmosphere . The low densities likely result from high @-@ volume extended atmospheres that surround cores of iron , rock , and possibly H2O . The inner constituents of the Kepler @-@ 11 system were , at the time of their discoveries , the most comprehensively understood extrasolar planets smaller than Neptune . Currently , observations do not place a firm constraint on the mass of planet g ( < 25 ME ) . However , formation and evolution studies indicate that the mass of planet g is not much greater than about 7 ME . 
 Kepler @-@ 11 planets may have formed in situ ( i.e. , at their observed orbital locations ) or may have started their formation farther away from the star while migrating inward through gravitational interactions with a gaseous protoplanetary disk . This second scenario predicts that a substantial fraction of the planets ' mass is in H2O . Regardless of the formation scenario , the gaseous component of the planets accounts for less than about 20 % of their masses but for ≈ 40 to ≈ 60 % of their radii . 
 The system is among the most compact known ; the orbits of planets b - f would easily fit inside the orbit of Mercury , with g only slightly outside it . Despite this close packing of the orbits , dynamical integrations indicate the system has the potential to be stable on a time scale of billions of years . 
 None of the planets are in low @-@ ratio orbital resonances , in which multiple planets gravitationally tug on and stabilize each other 's orbits , resulting in simple ratios of their orbital periods . However , b and c are close to a 5 : 4 ratio . 
 There could conceivably be other planets in the system that do not transit the star , but they would only be detectable by the effects of their gravity on the motion of the visible planets ( much as how Neptune was discovered ) .

 In February 2013 , with the Indian government allowing a foreign direct investment of up to 49 % in airlines , AirAsia Berhad applied to the Indian Foreign Investment Promotion Board ( FIPB ) seeking approval for commencing its operations in India . In March 2013 , AirAsia announced that it would establish a joint venture with Tata Sons and Telestra <unk> with Tata Sons representing the airline with two non @-@ executive directors in the board . The airliner planned to operate with the world 's lowest unit cost of ₹ 1 @.@ 25 ( 1 @.@ 9 ¢ US ) per available seat Kilometre and a passenger break @-@ even load factor of 52 % . It also planned to hedge 100 % of its fuel requirements for the first three years and to achieve an aircraft turnaround time of 25 minutes . 
 AirAsia planned to begin operations to various tier 2 and tier 3 cities with Chennai International Airport as its main operating base . According to KPMG , the introduction of AirAsia was expected to cause another price war , ultimately leading to an increase in air traffic and some consolidation in the Indian aviation sector . AirAsia initially invested an amount of US $ 50 million and in preparation for its operations in India , it struck deals with online and offline travel agents . On 3 March 2013 , the FIPB officially permitted AirAsia to rent or lease aircraft and to carry cargo on its scheduled flights . The airline then applied for permission to schedule aircraft and transport passengers , which the FIPB accepted on 6 March . 
 AirAsia India was established on 28 March 2013 and became the first foreign airline to set up a subsidiary in India . In April , the airline started recruiting candidates for pilots and cabin crew . As the final procedure to obtain Air Operator Permit , a proving flight was conducted on 1 and 2 May 2014 flying from Chennai to Kochi , Bangalore and Kolkata . On 7 May 2014 , the DGCA issued an Air Operator Permit to the company . On 30 May 2014 , the airline announced the shifting of its base to Bangalore and its first flight from there to Goa . AirAsia operated its maiden flight on 12 June 2014 . In June 2015 , the airline made Indira Gandhi International Airport , Delhi its secondary hub for North Indian operations . In August 2015 , Tata Sons increased its stake to 40 @.@ 06 % from 30 % earlier by injecting fresh equity while Telestra 's share was reduced to 10 % from 20 % .

 1000 Fires is the debut studio album by American singer and actress Traci Lords , released on February 28 , 1995 , by Radioactive Records . The album remains her only full @-@ length music release to date . Lords started working on the album in April 1994 , and collaborated with producers Juno Reactor , Mike Edwards and Babble . Executive produced by Gary <unk> , 1000 Fires is predominantly influenced by electronic music with elements of techno , trance and trip hop . Lyrically , it mostly focuses on dark themes , referring to Lords ' past in the porn industry , revealing her rape experience on the song " Father 's Field " or dealing with thoughts of suicide on " Fallen Angel " . 
 Upon its release , the album received generally positive reviews from music critics . However , it achieved moderate commercial success because its sound was aimed more at the underground rave scene audience , and failed to enter the Billboard 200 . It is currently out of print . During the promotion of the album , Lords performed as a DJ and opened shows for other artists such as Moby or the band My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult . 
 Two singles from the album were released . The lead single , " Control " , peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs and its instrumental version was featured in the film Mortal Kombat ( 1995 ) . The soundtrack to the film was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , which earned Lords her first music award . Its following single , " Fallen Angel " , was also successful in charts , peaking at number eleven on Hot Dance Club Songs . The Paul Oakenfold remix of the song was included on the soundtrack to the film Virtuosity ( 1995 ) , in which Lords had a cameo appearance . 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 After her departure from the adult film industry and transition to mainstream films , Lords got signed for a development deal with Capitol Records , but was later dropped due to disagreements between her and the label . " They wanted to market me in the way that would make the most money . They wanted to make me the new Samantha Fox . And I never wanted that . That wasn 't what it was about for me . I pretty much had a sense of myself , and I knew that I would be an imposter , " Lords said . 
 Following the split up from her husband Brook Yeaton , Lords decided to focus on her career outside acting . She began taking vocal lessons and was encouraged by her coach to search for a new record deal . After meeting with American DJ Rodney Bingenheimer at a birthday party , she was recommended to Jeff Jacklin , who hired her to record the song " Love Never Dies " for the 1992 film Pet <unk> Two . The producer of the soundtrack , Gary <unk> , signed her for a development deal with his label Radioactive Records . 
 In April 1994 , the label arranged her to fly to London and meet with producer Tom Bailey . They recorded the songs " I Want You " , " Fly " and " Just Like Honey " , which was later re @-@ recorded by Keith Fernley of Bailey 's group Babble with a different set of lyrics and became the song " Father 's Field " . Lords used lyrics she had previously written in New Zealand based on her personal journals she kept since she was a child . After finishing her recording with Bailey , Lords wanted something with a harder edge to add another dimension to her album . She was introduced to producer Ben Watkins of the electronic group Juno Reactor and decided to incorporate more rave sound . Mainly inspired by the music she would hear at warehouse parties during her stay in London , Lords teamed up with American singer Wonder with whom she created the lyrics to the song " Control " . Lords later commented on the inspiration behind the album 's sound : " It was in England that I fell in love with techno music . I was working in the UK doing some modelling a couple of years ago , and I was sharing a flat with some other girls in South London . We were really broke , and the cheapest place to go and have a good night out were raves - you could get in for about three bucks . So I went to a lot of raves and clubs , and I fell in love with the music - it was something that wasn 't happening in the States at the time . " Lords recorded three more songs with Watkins ; " Good @-@ N @-@ Evil " , " Outlaw Lover " and " Fallen Angel " . 
 Later she met Mike Edwards , the lead singer of the band Jesus Jones . They recorded the songs " Distant Land " , " Say Something " and " Okey <unk> " ; the latter of which they recorded as a joke at the end of a recording session .

 When asked about the album 's title , Lords said : " I think that fire is something that 's really representative of the record . It 's really , really peaceful and you 're drawn to it . But if you get too close , it can torch you and kill you . But if you just get close enough , it 's warm and it 's soothing , it 's mesmerising and it 's peaceful . It can give you everything or destroy you , depending on how smart you are . " The cover sleeve was shot by Joshua Jordan .

 The album 's opening track and lead single , " Control " , is an up @-@ tempo electronic song . Heavily influenced by techno and trance , it contains a prominent electric guitar riff . " I told Ben [ Watkins ] I wanted to do a song that had elements of rock and roll but with a techno vibe and he ran with it , creating a slamming heavy metal guitar intro on an insanely hyper track . " The song is about a dominant female who nurses a broken heart as she sings , " Let me kiss it and make it better / After tonight you will forget her " . " Fallen Angel " is also an up @-@ tempo techno @-@ trance song with elements of ambient music . It features Spanish guitar and castanets . The lyrics were influenced by and written surrounding the death of Kurt Cobain . The third track , " Good @-@ N @-@ Evil " , incorporates elements of industrial music . " Fly " is a mid @-@ tempo song built around a trip hop beat . The album 's fifth track and the only ballad on the album , " Distant Land " , contains elements of ambient music and features mellow guitar melody . Lyrically , the song is a tale of a woman waking up lost and not knowing where she is , searching for light in a distant land . 
 " Outlaw Lover " , the sixth track from the album , is an up @-@ tempo electronic song . It contains strong techno elements and features male opera vocals . Lords cast herself as a woman in a small town who had been wronged , and tells her unfaithful lover " You best be warned I 'm a woman scorned , " before shooting him dead . The lyrics were inspired by cowboy stories and old westerns . The following track , " I Want You " , is another song with strong trip hop influences and oriental vibe . " Say Something " also incorporates trip hop music within its composition . In the album 's ninth track , " Father 's Field " , Lords reveals her experience with rape when she was 10 years old . She was attacked by her 16 @-@ year @-@ old classmate in the back of her father 's house .

 Following the release of the album , Lords embarked on a small tour performing as a DJ , mostly in the Miami club scene . On August 12 , 1995 , she was the opening act of the Lollapalooza after party , <unk> Festival , alongside Moby , Sven <unk> , DJ <unk> and Single Cell Orchestra . 
 " Control " was released as the lead single from the album on December 20 , 1994 . The song received critical acclaim , especially for its rave sound which was unexpected from Lords . It peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs and number 84 on the UK Singles Chart . Its instrumental version was featured on the soundtrack to the 1995 film Mortal Kombat . The music video was shot in Los Angeles , California , and was inspired by James Bond with Lords portraying the female version of the character . 
 The album 's second single , " Fallen Angel " , released on August 3 , 1995 , was also successful in charts , peaking at number eleven on Hot Dance Club Songs . Lords managed to get Paul Oakenfold add the song to his DJ set . His remix of the song was included on the soundtrack to the film Virtuosity ( 1995 ) , in which Lords had a cameo . Two music videos for the song were released : one features the original version of the song and was shot during the making of the film Virtuosity ; the second version , directed by Stéphane Sednaoui , features the " Honeymoon Stitch Mix " , produced by Chad Smith and Dave Navarro .

 Upon its release , 1000 Fires received generally positive reviews from music critics . Stephen Thomas Erlewine at AllMusic gave it three stars out of five , calling it " a competent exercise in techno " . He criticized Lords ' vocals as being " thin " and not having much range , but also remarked that " she does have a forceful and distinctive personality , which gives the record a cohesive sound . " Benjamin Svetkey at Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B + , referring to Lords as " Moby with estrogen injections " . The Guardian stated that " there 's no saying a former under @-@ age porn star can 't make decent records and – shock ! – that 's exactly what her debut album is . " noting that her " come @-@ hither whisper works well on ambient items like Distant Land . " while the album was brought down by " some terrible dance @-@ by @-@ numbers things " 
 Despite the favorable reviews and good chart position of the lead single , 1000 Fires did not achieve mainstream success . Lords later commented : " The problem with that album was that it was ahead of its time . Electronica was just starting to happen . Moby was just starting to be huge . I opened for Thrill Kill Kult and Moby as a DJ back then . The masses didn 't know who Moby was . I think if it had been slightly delayed it would have done better . Madonna had it right to wait for Ray of Light . She has been a lot better with her timing than me . I am proud of that album because I hear it now and it still feels current . It doesn 't feel dated . "

 = Even Worse = 
 Even Worse is the fifth studio album by " Weird Al " Yankovic , released in 1988 . The album was his fifth , produced by former The McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer . Recorded between November 1987 and February 1988 , this album helped to revitalize Yankovic 's career after the critical and commercial disappointment of his previous album Polka Party ! ( 1986 ) . 
 The music on Even Worse is built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the mid @-@ 1980s . Half of the album is made up of parodies , featuring jabs at Michael Jackson , George Harrison , Tiffany , Los Lobos ' version of the folk song " La Bamba " , and Billy Idol . The other half of the album is original material , featuring many " style parodies " , or musical imitations that come close to , but do not copy , existing artists . These style parodies include imitations of specific artists such as Oingo Boingo , Beastie Boys , and James Taylor . Even Worse has the distinction of being one of two albums by Yankovic lacking any polka renditions of pop songs or medleys , the other being his debut album " Weird Al " Yankovic ( 1983 ) . This album 's title and cover art are spoofs of Michael Jackson 's 1987 album Bad . 
 Even Worse was met with mostly positive reviews and peaked at number 27 on the Billboard 200 , becoming Yankovic 's best selling album . The album also produced one of Yankovic 's hit singles , " Fat " , a parody of Michael Jackson 's " Bad " , which peaked at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 and became a staple on MTV . The album was quickly certified as a gold record , and later as a platinum record with sales of over one million copies in the United States , becoming Yankovic 's first platinum record . " Fat " later won a Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video at the 1989 Grammy Awards .

 After success in the early 80s , Yankovic released Polka Party ! in 1986 . Despite featuring parodies of hit songs like " Living in America " and " Addicted to Love " the album was a critical and commercial failure , not producing a charting single and peaking at number 177 on the Billboard 200 . After the disappointment with Polka Party ! , Yankovic went on record saying , " I thought it was the end of my career . " For most of 1987 , Yankovic took a break from recording . 
 In November 1987 , Yankovic returned to the studio to craft his follow @-@ up to Polka Party ! Once again , former The McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer was brought in as producer . During the first session , two songs were recorded : " Stuck In A Closet With Vanna White " , and " Melanie " . The next month , three songs were recorded : " Good Old Days " , " You Make Me " , and " Velvet Elvis " . Finally , in early 1988 , the remaining songs were recorded . 
 = = = Originals = = = 
 One of the first original songs recorded for the album was " Stuck in a Closet With Vanna White " , describing a bizarre recurring dream about Vanna White . Allmusic described the song as a " real winner for Yankovic " because it " was the first song [ Yankovic ] wrote that his [ ... ] target audience [ ... ] actually liked as much or even more than his parodies . " " You Make Me " is a song involving a person 's desire to engage in strange and / or violent behavior compelled by the weirdness of another person . According to the liner notes of The Permanent Record , " It 's about as close as [ Yankovic has ] ever come to writing a real love song . " Musically , the song is a style parody of Oingo Boingo . 
 " Melanie " is a stalker 's twisted love song to his neighbor Melanie . According to Yankovic , he wrote several additional verses for " Melanie " that he would only sing to his friends . " Twister " is an ode to the Milton Bradley game Twister . The song is a style parody of the Beastie Boys . When Yankovic was recording the song , he initially recorded about 20 vocal takes . However , when it came time to pick the right take , he opted for the first because it sounded " more raw and more off @-@ the @-@ cuff . " The album 's closer , " Good Old Days " is about a psychopath fondly remembering his childhood . Yankovic described the song as an " experiment " . He " wanted to see if [ he ] could write a song as if Charlie Manson and James Taylor were collaborating . " 
 = = = Parodies = = = 
 The first parody recorded for Even Worse was " I Think I 'm a Clone Now " . The song , a spoof of " I Think We 're Alone Now " as covered by Tiffany , is the story of a man who details his life as a clone of himself . The second parody recorded was " Alimony " , a parody of " Mony Mony " as covered by Billy Idol . The song is a diatribe about the narrator 's ex @-@ wife , who takes everything he owns for alimony payments . Although the song sounds as if it were recorded live — complete with clapping , screaming , and yelling — the track was entirely recorded in the studio . This is the only instance of Yankovic covering two songs originally made famous by the same artist on one album , as both " Mony Mony " and " I Think We 're Alone Now " were songs first performed by Tommy James and the Shondells . 
 When it came time to record a lead single , Yankovic once again turned his attention to Michael Jackson . Jackson had just released his album Bad , a follow @-@ up to 1983 's immensely successful album Thriller . After Yankovic first heard the lead single , " Bad " , he immediately envisioned a parody entitled " Fat " . Initially , Yankovic didn 't want to record another Michael Jackson parody . He later said , " I was still primarily known as the ' Eat It ' guy and I didn 't want to become known as the guy who just rides Michael 's coattails . " He later relented and sought out Jackson for permission . Jackson , a fan of Yankovic 's work , had already let Yankovic parody his 1983 hit single " Beat It " . When presented with the new potential parody , Jackson not only approved it , but let Yankovic use his own Moonwalker subway set for the music video . Yankovic later presented Jackson with a gold record of Even Worse after the album sold over 500 @,@ 000 copies . Jackson was so pleased with the song and video , he ordered twelve copies to give to his friends . Yankovic later said , " He doesn 't have to let me do this kind of stuff . [ ... ] The only reason he would let me is because he has a great sense of humor . " 
 The music video for the song features a leather @-@ clad Yankovic " expanding to 800 pounds and bouncing around a subway set . " To find suitable back @-@ up dancers , ads were placed in Los Angeles newspapers for " Very Fat Dancers " . One of the men used in the video was actually a pizza delivery man who had delivered food to the casting offices . Due to the music video , " Fat " became one of Yankovic 's biggest hits . Although only managing to peak at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 , the song 's music video got extensive play on MTV , which helped the album attain platinum status . In addition , " Fat " was later nominated and won a Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video at the 1989 Grammy Awards , at the time , Yankovic 's second Grammy Award . 
 The last parody recorded for the album was " Lasagna " , a parody of the traditional folk song " La Bamba " . The song is mainly about Italian culture with a heavy emphasis on cuisine . When Yankovic began writing the song , he originally wanted it to be sung in Italian . He later said , " I was actually going through Italian phrase books and dictionaries until I realized that the humor would be lost on 99 % of the audience , so I decided to do the whole thing in English but with kind of a bad Italian accent . " When the song was released as a single , it did not have a music video . However , ten years later in 1997 a short video was made for the The Weird Al Show . Under U.S. law , Yankovic can parody any song he wants as long as he pays royalties to use the original music . However , as a personal rule , he asks for permission anyway in order to maintain good relations with the industry . This particular song is an exception to that rule . Although the song is a parody of the Los Lobos cover version , " Lasagna " marked Yankovic 's first parody that did not require either permission from an artist or a payment of royalties , since the song " La Bamba " is a traditional folk song that is not attributed to any specific writer . Thus , Yankovic is the only writer given credit in the liner notes . 
 According to the Dallas Morning News , both Prince and George Michael turned down parody ideas that Yankovic asked permission to record for Even Worse . In addition , Even Worse did not contain a polka medley , Yankovic 's second — after his debut — and last album not to include one .

 Even Worse has received relatively favorable reviews . Allmusic awarded Even Worse four out of five stars , one of the highest ratings for Yankovic on the site . Reviewer Eugene Chadbourne said , " Trust Weird Al Yankovic to name an album Even Worse even as his recordings were getting better again . " Bruce Britt of Daily News of Los Angeles praised that album , and wrote that " It is tempting to dismiss ' Weird Al ' Yankovic as a joke [ … ] but those who dismiss Yankovic so easily overlook the fact that his lampoons are often wittier than the songs he spoofs . " Many critics praised the lead single , " Fat " . Chadbourne wrote that " the arrogance of ' I 'm Bad ' [ sic ] was perfectly trumped by Yankovic 's musical pile of lard , the appeal of the video 's visuals clearly not the only ace in the hole . " Britt called the song and video " so absurd , they are almost certain to be a hit this spring . " 
 Unlike previous albums , which were praised for their parodies but criticized for their originals , Chadbourne wrote that " Yankovic even manages to shatter all previous barriers and comes up with some funny original material as well , " citing " Good Old Days " and " Stuck in a Closet With Vanna White " as some of his best originals . Both Even Worse and " Fat " were nominated for Grammys . Although Even Worse was not a winner , " Fat " won a Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video in 1989 .

 Even Worse was released April 12 , 1988 , and , at the time of its release , was Yankovic 's best selling album . Even Worse peaked at number 27 on the Billboard 200 on July 2 , 1988 . The album spent a total of 25 weeks on the chart . On July 18 , 1988 — less than three months after its release — the album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . On January 27 , 1994 , the album was certified Platinum by the RIAA . At the time of its certification , it was Yankovic 's first Platinum record and until 1992 it was his best @-@ selling album .

 = 2 Pallas = 
 Pallas , minor @-@ planet designation 2 Pallas , is the second asteroid to have been discovered ( after Ceres ) , and it is one of the largest asteroids in the Solar System . With an estimated 7 % of the mass of the asteroid belt , it is the third @-@ most @-@ massive asteroid , being 10 – 30 % less massive than Vesta . It is 512 kilometers ( 318 mi ) in diameter , somewhat smaller than Vesta . It is likely a remnant protoplanet . 
 When Pallas was discovered by the German astronomer Heinrich Wilhelm Matthäus Olbers on 28 March 1802 , it was counted as a planet , as were other asteroids in the early 19th century . The discovery of many more asteroids after 1845 eventually led to their reclassification . 
 Pallas 's surface is most likely composed of a silicate material ; its spectrum and estimated density resemble carbonaceous chondrite meteorites . With an orbital inclination of 34 @.@ 8 ° , Pallas 's orbit is unusually highly inclined to the plane of the asteroid belt , and its orbital eccentricity is nearly as large as that of Pluto , making Pallas relatively inaccessible to spacecraft . 
 It was formerly considered a possible dwarf planet due to its size , but it is no longer considered such due to having significant departures from an ellipsoid . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 In 1801 , the astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered an object which he initially believed to be a comet . Shortly thereafter he announced his observations of this object , noting that the slow , uniform motion was uncharacteristic of a comet , suggesting it was a different type of object . This was lost from sight for several months , but was recovered later that year by the Baron von Zach and Heinrich W. M. Olbers after a preliminary orbit was computed by Carl Friedrich Gauss . This object came to be named Ceres , and was the first asteroid to be discovered . 
 A few months later , Olbers was again attempting to locate Ceres when he noticed another moving object in the vicinity . This was the asteroid Pallas , coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time . The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community . Before this point it had been speculated by astronomers that there should be a planet in the gap between Mars and Jupiter . Now , unexpectedly , a second such body had been found . When Pallas was discovered , some estimates of its size were as high as 3 @,@ 380 km in diameter . Even as recently as 1979 , Pallas was estimated to be 673 km in diameter , 26 % greater than the currently accepted value . 
 The orbit of Pallas was determined by Gauss , who found the period of 4 @.@ 6 years was similar to the period for Ceres . Pallas has a relatively high orbital inclination to the plane of the ecliptic . 
 = = = Later observations = = = 
 In 1917 , the Japanese astronomer Kiyotsugu Hirayama began to study asteroid motions . By plotting the mean orbital motion , inclination and eccentricity of a set of asteroids , he discovered several distinct groupings . In a later paper he reported a group of three asteroids associated with Pallas , which became named the Pallas family , after the largest member of the group . Since 1994 more than 10 members of this family have been identified , and these have semi @-@ major axes between 2 @.@ 50 – 2 @.@ 82 AU and inclinations of 33 – 38 ° . The validity of this grouping was confirmed in 2002 by a comparison of their spectra . 
 Pallas has been observed occulting stars several times , including the best observed of all asteroid occultation events on 29 May 1983 , when careful occultation timing measurements were taken by 140 observers . These resulted in the first accurate measurements of its diameter . During the occultation of 29 May 1979 the discovery of a possible tiny satellite with a diameter of about 1 km was reported , which was never confirmed . In 1980 , speckle interferometry was reported as indicating a much larger satellite with a diameter of 175 km , whose existence was later refuted . 
 Radio signals from spacecraft in orbit around Mars and / or on its surface have been used to estimate the mass of Pallas from the tiny perturbations induced by it onto the motion of Mars . 
 The Dawn team was granted viewing time on the Hubble Space Telescope in September 2007 for a once @-@ in @-@ twenty @-@ year opportunity to view Pallas at closest approach , to obtain comparative data for Ceres and Vesta . 
 = = = Naming = = = 
 2 Pallas is named after Pallas Athena ( Ancient Greek : <unk> <unk> ) , an alternate name for the goddess Athena . In some mythologies Athena killed Pallas , then adopted her friend 's name out of mourning . ( There are several male characters of the same name in Greek mythology , but the first asteroids were invariably given female names . ) 
 Pallas is a Greek name and some other languages use variant versions of it for the asteroid : in Italian , Pallade , Russian Pallada , Spanish Palas , and Arabic <unk> , for example . In Chinese , however , the asteroid has a different name , <unk> <unk> ( which means " the wisdom @-@ god ( <unk> ) star " ) , even though the Chinese call the goddess Pallas herself by the Greek name ( <unk> <unk> ) . 
 The stony @-@ iron <unk> meteorites are not connected to the Pallas asteroid , being instead named after the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas . The chemical element palladium , on the other hand , was named after the asteroid , which had been discovered just before the element . 
 As with other asteroids , the astronomical symbol for Pallas is a disk with its discovery number , ② . It also has an older , more iconic symbol , <unk> ( or sometimes ) . 
 = = Orbit and rotation = = 
 Pallas has unusual dynamic parameters for such a large body . Its orbit is highly inclined and moderately eccentric , despite being at the same distance from the Sun as the central part of the asteroid belt . Furthermore , Pallas has a very high axial tilt of 84 ° , with its north pole pointing towards ecliptic coordinates ( β , λ ) = ( 30 ° , − 16 ° ) with a 5 ° uncertainty in the Ecliptic <unk> reference frame . This means that every Palladian summer and winter , large parts of the surface are in constant sunlight or constant darkness for a time on the order of an Earth year , with areas near the poles experiencing continuous sunlight for as long as two years . 
 = = = Near resonances = = = 
 Pallas is in a , likely coincidental , near @-@ 1 : 1 orbital resonance with Ceres . Pallas also has a near @-@ 18 : 7 resonance ( 91 @,@ 000 @-@ year period ) and an approximate 5 : 2 resonance ( 83 @-@ year period ) with Jupiter . 
 = = = Transits of planets from Pallas = = = 
 From Pallas , Mercury , Venus , Mars , and Earth can occasionally appear to transit , or pass in front of , the Sun . Earth last did so in 1968 and 1998 , and will next transit in 2224 . Mercury did in October 2009 . The last and next by Venus are in 1677 and <unk> , and for Mars they are in 1597 and <unk> . 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 Both Vesta and Pallas have assumed the title of second @-@ largest asteroid from time to time . At 512 ± 3 km in diameter , Pallas is slightly smaller than 4 Vesta ( 525 @.@ 4 ± 0 @.@ 2 km ) . The mass of Pallas is only 84 % + 7 % 
 − 13 % that of Vesta , 22 % that of Ceres and about 0 @.@ 3 % that of the Moon . 
 Pallas is farther from Earth and has a much lower albedo than Vesta , and hence is dimmer as seen from Earth . Indeed , the much smaller 7 Iris marginally exceeds Pallas in mean opposition magnitude . Pallas 's mean opposition magnitude is + 8 @.@ 0 , which is well within the range of 10 × 50 binoculars , but , unlike Ceres and Vesta , it will require more @-@ powerful optical aid to view at small elongations , when its magnitude can drop as low as + 10 @.@ 6 . During rare perihelic oppositions , Pallas can reach a magnitude of + 6 @.@ 4 , right on the edge of naked @-@ eye visibility . During late February 2014 Pallas shone with magnitude 6 @.@ 96 . 
 Based on spectroscopic observations , the primary component of the material on Pallas 's surface is a silicate containing little iron and water . Minerals of this type include olivine and pyroxene , which are found in CM <unk> . The surface composition of Pallas is very similar to the <unk> carbonaceous chondrite ( CR ) meteorites , which are even lower in hydrous minerals than the CM type . The <unk> meteorite was discovered in Italy in 1824 and is one of the most primitive meteorites known . Pallas 's visible and near @-@ infrared spectrum is almost flat , being slightly brighter in towards the blue . There is only one clear absorption band in the 3 @-@ micron part , which suggests an anhydrous component mixed with hydrated CM @-@ like silicates . 
 Very little is known of Pallas 's surface features . Hubble images from 2007 , with a resolution around 70 kilometres ( 43 mi ) per pixel , show pixel @-@ to @-@ pixel variation , but Pallas 's albedo of 0 @.@ 12 placed such features at the lower end of detectability . There is little variability between <unk> obtained through visible @-@ light and infrared filters , but there are significant deviations in the ultraviolet , suggesting large surface or compositional features near 285 ° ( 75 ° west longitude ) . Pallas 's rotation appears to be prograde . 
 Pallas is thought to have undergone at least some degree of thermal alteration and partial differentiation , which suggests that it is a remnant protoplanet . During the planetary formation stage of the Solar System , objects grew in size through an accretion process to approximately this size . Many of these objects were incorporated into larger bodies , which became the planets , whereas others were destroyed in collisions with other protoplanets . Pallas and Vesta are likely survivors from this early stage of planetary formation . 
 Pallas was on a " watchlist " of objects possibly meeting a provisional definition of " planet " in an early draft of the IAU 's 2006 definition of planet . 
 = = Satellites = = 
 It has been suggested that Pallas has a moon . A moon about 1 kilometer in diameter was suggested based on occultation data from an occultation on 29 May 1978 , and another one separated from Pallas by 750 kilometers and 175 kilometers in diameter itself was suggested in 1980 , but later shown incorrect in 1983 occultation observations . Considering the level at which Pallas has been studied and observed since it was discovered , it is unlikely that there are any large moons orbiting Pallas . 
 = = Exploration = = 
 Pallas has not been visited by spacecraft and there are no plans for exploration of Pallas by spacecraft . A flyby after the Dawn probe 's visits to 4 Vesta and 1 Ceres was discussed but was not possible . 
 = Yoann Gourcuff = 
 Yoann Gourcuff ( French pronunciation : ​ [ <unk> <unk> ] or Breton pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; born 11 July 1986 ) is a French international footballer who currently plays for Rennes . He operates mainly as an attacking midfielder , but can also be utilized as a withdrawn striker and is described as a " playmaker of real quality " who " is an accomplished passer of the ball " . Gourcuff has been described by former French international David Ginola as the best French player of his generation . His playing style and ability have drawn comparisons to French legend Zinedine Zidane . 
 Gourcuff is the son of Christian Gourcuff . In 2001 , he followed in his father 's footsteps and joined Rennes . After progressing through the youth ranks and making the senior team , Gourcuff quickly became a fan favorite among supporters and his individual achievements soon led to interest from clubs abroad , which resulted in a move to Italian club AC Milan . Gourcuff achieved many club honours despite not being able to break into the starting eleven , which resulted in the player being sent on loan to Ligue 1 club Bordeaux in his home country of France . Following a successful season , in which Bordeaux captured the league and league cup double and Gourcuff attained several individuals honours , he signed with the club permanently . Gourcuff is a former winner of the UNFP Ligue 1 Player of the Year award and , in December 2009 , was named the French Player of the Year for the 2009 calendar year . In August 2010 , he joined Olympique Lyonnais on a five @-@ year contract . 
 Gourcuff is a French international . Prior to playing at senior level , he played on the under @-@ 19 team that won the 2005 European Under @-@ 19 Football Championship . Gourcuff made his senior national team debut in August 2008 . He scored his first international goal two months later against Romania . Gourcuff made his first major tournament appearance for France at the 2010 FIFA World Cup . Since joining the national team , he has been inserted into the playmaker role , a position that was vacated and never filled following the retirement of Zidane in 2006 . 
 = = Early and personal life = = 
 Gourcuff was born on 11 July 1986 in <unk> , Morbihan , Brittany to parents Dr. Marine <unk> and Christian Gourcuff , both of whom are Bretons . He comes from a very athletic family : his mother was a basketball player , his older brother , Erwan , is a competitive swimmer and cyclist , while his father was a former footballer who played for several clubs in such countries as France , Switzerland , and Canada . However , his father was best known for his time at Rennes , Lorient , and Le Mans . Gourcuff 's father later moved into managerial roles , having stints at Rennes , Le Mans , Lorient ( three times ) , and Qatari club Al @-@ Gharafa . He currently serves as manager of Algeria . As a youth , the younger Gourcuff excelled at both football and tennis , becoming the top player of his age group ( 12 ) , but eventually opted to focus on football . While beginning his career as a football player , Gourcuff admired and drew inspiration from the playing style of the Brazil national team from the 1970s , whom he discovered from watching tapes with his father . He often attempted to emulate the skills of Brazilian legend Pelé . 
 = = Club career = = 
 = = = Early career and Rennes = = = 
 Gourcuff began his career with Lorient , who were , at the time , managed by his father Christian in 1992 . During his time at Lorient , he also trained at <unk> <unk> , a regional academy located in the Brittany region that trained players similarly to the Clairefontaine academy in the Île @-@ de @-@ France . Further to his father 's departure to Stade <unk> , Gourcuff , who initially considered rivals Nantes , followed suit and signed an aspirant ( youth ) contract with the club in 2001 . He spent two years in the club 's youth academy and , while competing domestically in the system , Gourcuff played on the club 's under @-@ 19 team that won the 2003 edition of the Coupe Gambardella . Rennes defeated Strasbourg 4 – 1 in the final match at the Stade de France . Gourcuff scored the club 's opening goal . Included on that team with Gourcuff were future club and international teammates Jimmy Briand and Sylvain <unk> . 
 Ahead of the 2003 – 04 season . Gourcuff was promoted to the club 's reserve team in the Championnat de France amateur , the fourth level of French football , Gourcuff appeared in 15 matches and scored two goals with the team before signing his first professional contract in November 2003 , which resulted in his promotion to the senior team by manager Laszlo Bölöni . Gourcuff made his professional debut on 25 January 2004 in a 2 – 0 victory to Croix @-@ de @-@ Savoie in the Coupe de France appearing as a substitute . On 7 February , he made his league debut in a 2 – 0 defeat to Auxerre appearing as a substitute . Following the match , he was relegated back to the reserve team . Gourcuff returned to the senior team in late March making two more substitute appearances against Strasbourg and Lille . On 18 April , he made his first professional start in a 3 – 1 win over Bordeaux . Gourcuff made his second career start on the final match day of the season assisting on a goal in a 4 – 0 victory over Montpellier . 
 For the second consecutive season under Bölöni , Gourcuff rotated between the club 's reserve team and the senior team . He appeared in nine matches with the reserve team and 21 with the senior team . Gourcuff only started six matches with the latter team scoring no goals and providing one assist . In the 2005 – 06 season , he was reassigned the number 10 shirt by Bölöni and giving a starting place within the team . In his first season as a starter , Gourcuff appeared in 42 total matches and scored six goals . He formed midfield partnerships with fellow Frenchman Olivier <unk> and the Swede Kim <unk> and made his European debut on 15 September in a UEFA Cup first round tie against Spanish club Osasuna appearing as a substitute . Rennes won the tie 3 – 1 on aggregate and were later eliminated in the group stage portion of the competition . Three days after his European debut , on 18 September , Gourcuff scored his first professional goal against Monaco in a 2 – 0 win . In November , Gourcuff scored goals in back @-@ to @-@ back matches against Troyes and Toulouse . In the latter part of the season , Gourcuff went on a scoring run netting three goals in a span of four weeks . He scored the first of these goals on 25 February 2006 in a 4 – 1 away win over Lyon . After going a week without a goal , Gourcuff responded by scoring goals in back @-@ to @-@ back weeks in wins over Ajaccio and Metz . In the Coupe de France , Gourcuff appeared in all four of the team 's matches as Rennes reached the semi @-@ finals where the club was defeated 3 – 0 by Marseille . Rennes ultimately finished the season in 7th place in the league , which resulted in the club qualifying for the 2006 UEFA Intertoto Cup . Gourcuff finished his Rennes career with 80 appearances , six goals , and nine assists . 
 = = = Milan = = = 
 Following the season , Gourcuff was linked to a host of big name European clubs such as Dutch club Ajax , Spanish club Valencia , and English club Arsenal . He ultimately joined Italian club Milan . He signed a five @-@ year contract with the transfer fee being priced at € 4 @.@ 58 million . Gourcuff was assigned the number 20 shirt and made his competitive debut for the Rossoneri on 9 August 2006 in the club 's UEFA Champions League third qualifying round tie against Serbian club Red Star Belgrade . He appeared as a substitute in the 81st minute for Andrea Pirlo as Milan won the match 1 – 0 . In his next competitive match with the club against Greek outfit AEK Athens in the Champions League group stage , Gourcuff scored his first career goal for the club in a 3 – 0 win . Gourcuff didn 't make his Serie A debut until 20 September playing the entire match in a 1 – 0 win over Ascoli . In the ensuing matches , Gourcuff rotated between the starting lineup and the bench and capped the season by scoring in Milan 's final match of the Seria A season ; a 3 – 2 defeat to Udinese . Despite not appearing in the 2007 UEFA Champions League Final , which Milan won , Gourcuff did earn a winner 's medal with the club as a result of his participation in the group stage and knockout round matches . 
 Due to Milan winning the UEFA Champions League , Gourcuff was included in the squads that competed in the 2007 UEFA Super Cup and the 2007 FIFA Club World Cup , though he didn 't appear in the former match and appeared infrequently in the latter competition . In the 2007 – 08 Serie A season , Gourcuff struggled for playing time as he was in direct competition with the Brazilian international and 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year winner Kaká . Gourcuff 's development and attitude at the club was also questioned by manager Carlo Ancelotti who critically stated that the player had psychological issues . Gourcuff only appeared in 15 league matches for the club starting only four . He scored his only goal of the season on 31 October 2007 in a 5 – 0 hammering of Sampdoria . On 24 February 2008 , after appearing as a half @-@ time substitute , Gourcuff assisted on the game @-@ winning goal scored in the 90th minute by Filippo Inzaghi in Milan 's 2 – 1 win over Palermo . In the final nine matches of the season , Gourcuff was an unused substitute in seven of them . In Gourcuff 's final match at the club , he assisted on the final goal by Alexandre Pato in the club 5 – 1 win over Reggina . 
 Following the season , on 31 May 2008 , Milan vice @-@ president Adriano Galliani revealed that the club would loan Gourcuff to French club Bordeaux for the entire 2008 – 09 season to allow him more playing time . In 2010 , in an interview with French newspaper L 'Equipe , former Milan captain Paolo Maldini stated that Gourcuff lacked discipline while at the club and often distanced himself from the team citing the player 's refusal to learn the Italian language . Maldini also stated that Gourcuff did not give his all during his stint at Milan and that the player himself knew it . Gourcuff did not respond to the comments , but his father , Christian , did stating to France Football that there was some sort of conspiracy out there looking to tarnish his son 's image . The elder Gourcuff responded to Maldini 's charges stating his son " took two hours ( of Italian language courses ) per day and spoke Italian after two months " and that " he is passionate about tactics " in response to Maldini saying Gourcuff refused to learn Italian and he was limited tactically . Gourcuff was also defended by his club president Jean @-@ Louis Triaud at his former club Bordeaux who stated in response to Maldini 's comments " Yoann is not like that . A number ten who does not play with the group is a little weird . This does not correspond at all to what we saw with Yoann at Bordeaux . He was well integrated with his teammates , and collectively with them on the ground . He left good memories here . " 
 = = = Bordeaux = = = 
 At Bordeaux , Gourcuff quickly asserted himself into the squad for the 2008 – 09 season scoring on his league debut against Caen in a 2 – 1 victory and also helping Bordeaux capture their 2nd Trophée des champions title . He scored Bordeaux 's 4th and final goal in the team 's 4 – 0 triumph over Vannes in the Coupe de la Ligue final . Gourcuff also provided the assist on the third goal . He scored two goals in Bordeaux 's Champions League campaign against Roma and CFR Cluj . On 11 January 2009 , Gourcuff scored a goal that was voted the goal of the season by fans against Paris Saint @-@ Germain in a 4 – 0 victory . Upon receiving the ball from teammate Matthieu <unk> , just outside the box , Gourcuff performed a swift Marseille turn , eluding PSG defender Sylvain Armand , followed by quickly shifting the ball from his right foot to his left causing Sammy Traoré to lose balance , before bringing the ball back to his right foot and blasting it past Paris Saint @-@ Germain goalkeeper Mickaël <unk> with the outside of his right foot . 
 The following two weeks , Gourcuff scored his fifth and sixth goals , respectively , against Nantes in a 2 – 1 victory and Lille in a 2 – 2 draw . After going goalless in the league for seven straight weeks , Gourcuff got back on track scoring against relegation @-@ bound Le Havre . On 20 April 2009 , Gourcuff scored his first career double against his former club Rennes in a 3 – 2 victory . In the ensuing three weeks , Gourcuff maintained his form scoring in all three matches , against Sochaux , Valenciennes , and Le Mans giving him a tally of 12 league goals for the season . Bordeaux won all three matches , which effectively put them in first @-@ place position heading into the final week of the season . Bordeaux eventually won the league capturing the sixth title in the club 's history . The club also recorded its second ever double , as a result of its Coupe de la Ligue title . For his efforts during the 2008 – 09 season , Gourcuff was awarded the UNFP Ligue 1 Player of the Year award . He was also named in the organization 's Ligue 1 Team of the Year . His performances during the 2008 – 09 season later earned him a nomination by the French magazine France Football for the 2009 Ballon d 'Or award , won by Lionel Messi as Gourcuff finished in 20th place with six points . 
 Due to Gourcuff 's impressive season , his parent club announced that it would be open to the player returning to Milan for the 2009 – 10 season . However , the club 's plans were put on halt after learning of Bordeaux 's intent to meet Gourcuff 's buy @-@ out clause of € 15 million included in the loan deal . Despite general manager Adriano Galliani and new manager Leonardo 's efforts to persuade Gourcuff to return , on 28 May , it was announced that Bordeaux had signed Gourcuff permanently from Milan with Gourcuff agreeing to a four @-@ year deal . The transfer fee was € 13 @.@ 6 million . 
 Gourcuff began the 2009 – 10 season claiming his fourth silverware with Bordeaux on 25 July 2009 , winning the 2009 Trophée des Champions title in a 2 – 0 victory over Guingamp . As a result of his performance , he was named Man of the Match . Two weeks later , he scored a double in the club 's opening match of the league season against Lens . The final result was 4 – 1 . The victory set a record in league play for most consecutive wins for the club with 12 . On 23 August , he scored another set of goals , this time against Nice in a 4 – 0 victory . 
 In the UEFA Champions League , Gourcuff assisted on Bordeaux 's only goal in the club 's opening 1 – 1 draw against Italian club Juventus scored by Jaroslav <unk> . On 30 September , Gourcuff suffered a groin injury in the club 's 1 – 0 victory over Israeli club Maccabi Haifa , which forced him to miss two league matches and an international call up . Bordeaux lost both matches . He returned to the team for Bordeaux 's back @-@ to @-@ back matches with German club Bayern Munich . In the first match , which Bordeaux won 2 – 1 , Gourcuff missed a penalty after attempting to cheekily chip the ball over goalkeeper Hans @-@ Jörg Butt , however in the second match , he made amends scoring the game @-@ winning goal in Bordeaux 's 2 – 0 victory at the Allianz Arena . Bordeaux eventually finished the group stage portion undefeated . 
 For most of November and the early part of December , Gourcuff suffered a dip in form in league play going scoreless and also not providing any assists . Manager Laurent Blanc later stated that Gourcuff had lacked confidence since returning from his injury following Gourcuff 's second penalty miss of the season in the club 's midweek 1 – 0 victory over Montpellier on 16 November . However , three days later , Gourcuff returned to form scoring a goal and providing the assists on the other three goals in Bordeaux 's 4 – 1 win over Lorient . On 20 December , he was declared by magazine France Football the French Player of the Year for 2009 beating out the likes of Nicolas Anelka , Hugo Lloris , Thierry Henry , and Franck Ribéry ; the latter having won the award the past two seasons prior . 
 On 23 February 2010 , Gourcuff assisted on Bordeaux 's only goal , scored by Michaël Ciani , in the club 's shutout victory away to Greek club Olympiacos in the first leg of its UEFA Champions League knockout round match following his delivery of a powerful and driven free kick into the box that landed at the head of the defenseman . In the second leg , he scored the opening goal in the 5th minute converting a free kick to put Bordeaux up 2 – 0 on aggregate . The team won the tie with a 3 – 1 aggregate scoreline to advance to the quarter @-@ finals where Bordeaux faced league rivals Lyon . In the first leg , which Lyon won 3 – 1 , Gourcuff provided the assist on an away goal scored by Marouane Chamakh . In the second leg , Bordeaux recorded a first half goal , but were unable to score another as Lyon advanced to the semi @-@ finals on a 3 – 2 aggregate scoreline . On 24 April in a league match against Lorient , Gourcuff endured a recurring groin injury during the early stages of the match . Despite showing signs of injury , Gourcuff remained in the match until the end of the first half . Due to the injury , Gourcuff missed the Bordeaux 's final five league matches . The club recorded two wins , one draw , and two losses in the five matches which resulted in Bordeaux failing to qualify for European competition next season . 
 In the 2010 – 11 season , Gourcuff appeared in Bordeaux 's first three league matches of the season .

 Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles : My Life as a King , released in Japan as Chiisana <unk> to Yakusoku no Kuni : Fainaru Fantajī Kurisutaru Kuronikuru ( <unk> ファイナルファンタジー ・ <unk> ? , lit . " The Little King and the Promised Kingdom : Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles " ) is a video game developed for the WiiWare service of the Wii console by Square Enix . Square Enix decided to make a game for the WiiWare service that would be high profile , and it was decided that the game would be a simulation game and , later in development , a Final Fantasy title . 
 The game is a city @-@ building game set in the world of the action RPG Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles and is the third title in the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles series . Following the events of the first Crystal Chronicles game , the son of a king who lost his kingdom during that game establishes a new one and sets about creating a peaceful and prosperous land . 
 A WiiWare launch title in all regions , it was released on March 25 , 2008 in Japan , May 12 , 2008 in North America , and May 20 , 2008 in Europe . The game costs 1500 Wii Points . Reviews of the game were generally favorable , and it has been seen as one of the most innovative games released on the WiiWare service . A followup , Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles : My Life as a Darklord , was announced at a Nintendo keynote speech at the Game Developers Conference 2009 , and was a tower defense game that was also met with positive reviews . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 My Life as a King takes place after the events of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles , in a remote area of the peaceful world where the miasma that ravaged the land has now cleared . As kingdoms rebuild , the new king of a realm somewhere , having lost his father 's old realm to the Dark Lord , now tries to revive his kingdom through a mysterious power called " <unk> " that he received from the crystal . The king pays for research for new items for his warriors to purchase and sends them out to purge the land of evil . The player is free to give the kingdom the name of their choice , with " <unk> " being the suggested default . 
 The game is a fantasy city @-@ building simulator in which the player creates a kingdom from the ground up . Starting with a barren town consisting of a lone castle and a large power crystal , by using the crystal 's power the player can magically place a variety of buildings to populate the settlement and draw in residents . The game makes limited use of the Wiimote 's motion @-@ sensing abilities and can be played one @-@ handed . Each " day " lasts approximately 10 minutes and players are given an increasing amount of options and as to what to do that day as the game progresses . At the end of each day , adventurers return and the player reviews what was accomplished that day . 
 To continue using the crystal to build up the settlement , the player must accumulate <unk> which must be obtained from the dungeons and caves that surround the town . Instead of gathering the crystals first hand , the game prompts the player to recruit young citizens to do so by posting tasks on a town bulletin board . These " adventurers " are paid via taxes the player collects from the residents of the town , as well as from treasures found during their quest . The player can follow their progress by reading message boards placed around town , as well as by talking to their penguin assistant , Pavlov . 
 The player must also tend to the needs of their residents by building amenities such as a bakery to increase their morale , which increases the citizens productivity and helps the kingdom develop . Other needs include weapons shops to better equip their adventurers . As the game advances and the number of quests increases for the player , their adventurers will be able to gain experience and new aspiring adventurers will also appear , asking to be recruited . Players are also rewarded for repeatedly talking to their citizens . My Life as a King also includes a New Game Plus feature , available upon completion of the storyline . It offers " hard " and " very hard " difficulty levels for subsequent playthroughs which retain the adventurers , with their statistics and equipment , from the previous playthrough . 
 = = = Downloadable content = = = 
 My Life as a King also features additional downloadable content including new costumes for the king and his assistant Chime , the addition of three different races to become employable warriors for quests , new quests which unlock new buildings , a jukebox , new adventurer names , a library to gain new warrior abilities , and " Infinity Spire " , a new dungeon with unlimited challenges . The additional content was priced between 100 and 800 Wii Points . The downloadable content was first made available on April 1 , 2008 and 8 items were initially offered . Users who purchased and downloaded the game before April 1 were able to download the update from the add @-@ on software menu within the castle . 
 = = Development = = 
 Square Enix wanted to be one of the first companies to make games for the WiiWare service to attract more attention to their game as it was very different from other Final Fantasy games . One of the developers of Front Mission : Online , Kenichiro Yuji , was chosen as the games director . Several gameplay ideas were considered for the project , including making it an action role @-@ playing game or a sandbox video game , but the developers were not fans of the sandbox genre and settled on making an action role @-@ playing game . The game originated from the concept that the player should control a king , rather than the hero , what they called an " inverted game " from the usual format . The battle system went through four revisions , much of which was discarded before the final design was agreed upon . At first it was thought that players would spend most of their time observing the action , but eventually features were added to encourage player engagement through various activities . Battle reports thus became one of the toughest challenges for the team , and went through several iterations to get right . The development team also found it difficult to write dialogue that would keep the game exciting without the player actually participating in or even witnessing the battles . 
 Not originally conceived as a Final Fantasy title , the game began from a prototype of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles to cut down on the projects costs . The game was linked to the Crystal Chronicles story through the game mechanic of summoning objects into existence through thought , a theme of the game series . Later in development empire building and strategy genres influenced the gameplay , but effort was made to simplify that genre 's usual high learning curve . Many features did not make it into the final game , including a " <unk> " mode with randomly generated dungeons every game , and an epilogue , which was removed for not fitting in with the finished game . The bakery was going to be replaced by a general store , but using a bakery was more appealing to the developers . Multiplayer was another feature the director was enthusiastic about , with ideas including a " kings tournament " where players competed against each other , and recruiting adventurers from other kingdoms , but was not included . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles : My Life as a King received a generally favorable response . IGN , reviewing the Japanese version of the game after its launch , was impressed with the quality and expansiveness of the game , saying that it was a " good start " to Nintendo 's WiiWare download service . In a later review of the North American release they cited disappointment at not being able to undertake quests , calling it " a Final Fantasy game where you stay at home and send other people out to play Final Fantasy " , and felt that elements of the game were repetitive . However , they praised the presentation and felt the game could be " engaging if [ the player ] put enough time into it " . 1UP.com compared the game to Animal Crossing but with a distinct RPG feel , and praised the game for its depth . Other reviewers felt it had a " plodding " pace , but had a soundtrack that is " quite good " . Some wished the game ran in progressive scan mode , a deficit rectified in a later update . 
 The Official Nintendo Magazine commented that it was ' incredibly deep ' and that it was ' highly addictive ' . They did however mark it down for being ' Slow and really niche ' . N @-@ Europe praised the game for being ' surprisingly deep ' and said that it was worth its weight in points , despite the pricey downloadable content . WiiWare World was quoted as saying " Of all the WiiWare titles to date , Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles : My Life as a King is easily the most ambitious game on the <unk> and cheap . The scope of the game is enormous and there 's never a lack of things to do as you live out each day of the game 's adventure . " 
 However , while GameSpot thought the game had visual charm , they believed the game was in large " shallow , limiting , and padded with unrewarding gameplay " , and felt constrained by their belief that much of the game 's variety comes from the downloadable content . Wired 's Chris Kohler also felt the pricing for the game 's downloadable content was " exorbitant " , with all available items at the time of review costing almost as much as the game itself to purchase . 
 The game was named the 21st best WiiWare game in 2011 by IGN . GamesRadar listed it as one of their " Top 7 ... Final Fantasy Spinoffs " .

 On May 20 , 2008 , the web browser <unk> Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles : My Life as a King - Everyone 's Kingdom was launched on the North American Square Enix Members website . The game acts as a foil to My Life as a King , where the players are the citizens , encouraging the growth of the kingdom ( seen practically as increasing house levels and unlocking features ) and , eventually , fulfilling <unk> . A sequel to the game , Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles : My Life as a Darklord , was released in 2009 . Playing as Mira , the daughter of the predecessor 's antagonist , players discourage the growth of the kingdom while keeping adventurers from taking siege of her tower . 
 = Get Together ( Madonna song ) = 
 " Get Together " is a song by American singer Madonna from her tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance Floor ( 2005 ) . Produced by Madonna and Stuart Price , the song was released as the third single from the album by Warner Bros. Records on June 6 , 2006 . The decision was spurred by the fact that " Get Together " was the third most downloaded song from the album . It was also released to coincide with the start of Madonna 's Confessions Tour . Inspired by Stardust 's single " Music Sounds Better with You " , " Get Together " portrays an anthem @-@ like picture with its lyrics , about the different possibilities of finding love on the dance floor . 
 Contemporary critics appreciated the song , calling it fluid in nature and a wonderful dance track . They complimented Madonna 's ability to turn cliché comments into pop slogans with the song . After its worldwide release , the song became a success on the dance charts of the United States but failed to enter the official Billboard Hot 100 chart , only peaked at six on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart . It reached the top ten in countries like Canada , the United Kingdom and Italy and topped the chart in Spain . 
 The accompanying music video incorporated Madonna 's performance of the song at London 's Koko Club , but it was animated to make it different visually . The video showed Madonna singing the song amongst graphical visuals portraying volcanoes erupting and a cityscape . Madonna performed the song on her Confessions Tour where she was accompanied by two dancers wearing horse reins around their head . In 2007 , the song was nominated in the category of Best Dance Recording at the 49th Grammy Awards , but lost to Justin Timberlake 's 2006 single " SexyBack " .

 " Get Together " is written by Madonna , Anders Bagge , Peer Åström and Stuart Price with production credits from Madonna and Price . It was inspired by the 1998 dance hit " Music Sounds Better with You " by Stardust . Initially the song " Jump " was to be released as the third single from the album . However , " Get Together " was chosen as the third single to coincide with the start of Madonna 's 2006 Confessions Tour . The decision was also spurred by the fact that " Get Together " was the third best @-@ selling digital single from the Confessions on a Dance Floor album . Its digital sales stood at 20 @,@ 000 at that time , whereas digital sales for " Jump " were only 9 @,@ 000 . Hence , " Get Together " was finally chosen as the third single .

 Keith Caulfield from Billboard complimented the song 's " <unk> " theme . Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented that the song turned cliché comments like " Love at first sight " into a pop slogan . David Browne from Entertainment Weekly said that it was fluid in nature and called Madonna as a " restless soul aching to connect " in the song . Jason Shawhan from About.com also complimented the song by describing it as a " weird and wonderful number . " Stephen M. Deusner of Pitchfork Media wrote : " On ' Get Together ' , as Price 's synths ebb and flow moodily , Madonna asks the eternal question , ' Do you believe in love at first sight ? ' , over a tripping vocal melody . " Joan Morgan of The Village Voice wrote : " The momentum builds rapidly with a seamless transition into the wicked alchemy of ' Get Together ' , where Madge and Price offer up an irresistible manipulation of rather sweet vocals laced over thumping percussion , seductive synthesizers , and a few subtle soul @-@ claps thrown in for good measure . " 
 Alexis Petridis of The Guardian admitted that the chorus of the song is triumphant . Chris Norris of Blender wrote that the song " evokes both early- ' 80s dance giants the S.O.S. Band and early- ' 80s dance giant Madonna . " Matt <unk> of The Chicago Maroon wrote : " ... ' Get Together ' is probably the best , but it 's hard not to feel that Madonna 's computerized voice is a cheat ( perhaps to cover for the high notes she can no longer reach ? ) " Diego Costa of The UWM Post in review of the song , wrote : " In this one @-@ step @-@ up @-@ from @-@ lounge @-@ track , Madonna is a teen again , wondering if there is such a thing as love at first sight . But in the end , as a wise woman , she realizes that whether it exists or not , she doesn 't care , since ' all is just an illusion . ' Yeah , we heard it all before , she will even admit it in the following track , but it doesn 't mean we don 't want to hear it again .

 The music video featured Madonna 's live performance at the Koko Club in London on November 15 , 2005 during her promotional tour for the album . It was directed by Logan and his production team . The animations and designs were done by artist Nathaniel Howe . Howe was contacted by Logan Studios executive producer Kevin Shapiro and booked as a 3D / 2D animator . The conceptualization and work on the video began on May 1 , 2006 . It was inspired by the work of Italian comic @-@ book artist Milo Manara and retro science fiction . Different software like Maya , After Effects and <unk> were used to bring out the different environments in the video . Howe explained further about the creative process in an interview with the Madonna fansite " Drowned Madonna " . He said , 
 " During the initial phases of the video we focused on testing different looks in 3D to see how the color , environment and cinematography complemented the song . While this was happening the edit of the raw footage was being assembled . As the edit evolved we narrowed down the techniques and look of the worlds . Before we even had picture lock we were dropping in rendered 3D shots ; this really allowed us to fine tune both the edit and the effects to work together with the song . As this progressed we regularly sent tests to Warner Bros. and the Madonna camp . " 
 Madonna was involved with watching the previews of the work done and passed her comments through Shapiro to the development team . After the fluid effects in the video were completed , Logan and Howe fine @-@ tuned and revisited the shots and eliminated any discrepancies while incorporating Madonna 's comments . 
 The video starts with showing the world evolving from its genesis . Images of volcanoes erupting , dinosaurs and tidal waves flash by to show Madonna and her two backup dancers singing the song while standing on a hill . It continues in this fluid motion up to the intermediate verse when Madonna is shown crawling under the waves and spirals . As the song moves towards the bridge again , the scene changes from the mountains to a cityscape . Madonna and her dancers are shown dancing and singing the song on a skyscraper . The video ends with Madonna standing on the building and the camera <unk> out of the panel .

 In November 2005 , Madonna first performed " Get Together " on TV shows such as Parkinson in England and Star Academy in France , as well as during the Children in Need 2005 telethon in London . Another performances came during concerts at Koko and G @-@ A @-@ Y nightclub in London , respectively on November 15 and 18 , and Studio Coast in Tokyo , Japan on December 7 . During the performances , Madonna emerged from a glitter ball while wearing a purple jacket , velvet pedal pushers and knee @-@ high boots . 
 In the Confessions Tour , the song was the second performance of the evening and was part of the equine segment of the show . Madonna wore a skin @-@ tight , full body black leotard . She opened her hat from the previous performance of " Future Lovers " , as the background changed from the video of the horses to a red , geometric patterned kaleidoscope shot by Steven Klein . Madonna started singing the song . Two male backup dancers appeared behind her wearing horse reins around their heads to convey the feeling of oppression . The song continued in their choreographed performance , with Madonna sometimes pulling the harness around her dancers as if they were horses . During the intermediate musical interlude , Madonna moved to the front of the stage and lay down on the screen attached to it . As she continued singing the music increased and she started to twirl in the center of the stage . The performance continued with Madonna and her dancers moving to the back of the stage singing the words " get together " repeatedly . It ended with the music of the next song " Like a Virgin " starting . 
 Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine , while reviewing The Confessions Tour video album , commented that , " A great song like ' Get Together ' is splendidly sung ( whoever tweaks the levels on her mic is a genius ) , but its celebratory , keep @-@ it @-@ together message is compromised by the contradictory feelings of bondage ( oppression ) conveyed by having two backup dancers equipped with reins around their heads . " In the live video album release , " Get Together " was excluded from the CD package but was included in the track listing of the DVD .

 The Poor Fellow @-@ Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon ( Latin : <unk> <unk> Christi <unk> <unk> ) , commonly known as the Knights Templar , the Order of Solomon 's Temple ( French : Ordre du Temple or <unk> ) or simply as Templars , were among the wealthiest and most powerful of the Western Christian military orders and were prominent actors in Christian finance . The organisation existed for nearly two centuries during the Middle Ages . 
 Officially endorsed by the Roman Catholic Church around 1129 , the order became a favoured charity throughout Christendom and grew rapidly in membership and power . Templar knights , in their distinctive white mantles with a red cross , were among the most skilled fighting units of the Crusades . Non @-@ combatant members of the order managed a large economic infrastructure throughout Christendom , innovating financial techniques that were an early form of banking , and building fortifications across Europe and the Holy Land . 
 The Templars ' existence was tied closely to the Crusades ; when the Holy Land was lost , support for the order faded . Rumours about the Templars ' secret initiation ceremony created distrust , and King Philip IV of France , deeply in debt to the order , took advantage of the situation . In 1307 , many of the order 's members in France were arrested , tortured into giving false confessions , and then burned at the stake . Under pressure from King Philip , Pope Clement V disbanded the order in 1312 . The abrupt disappearance of a major part of the European infrastructure gave rise to speculation and legends , which have kept the " Templar " name alive into the modern day .

 = = = Rise = = = 
 After the First Crusade captured Jerusalem in 1099 , many Christians made pilgrimages to various Holy Places in the Holy Land . However , though the city of Jerusalem was under relatively secure control , the rest of Outremer was not . Bandits and marauding highwaymen preyed upon pilgrims who were routinely slaughtered , sometimes by the hundreds , as they attempted to make the journey from the coastline at Jaffa into the interior of the Holy Land . 
 In 1119 , the French knight Hugues de Payens approached King Baldwin II of Jerusalem and <unk> , Patriarch of Jerusalem , and proposed creating a monastic order for the protection of these pilgrims . King Baldwin and Patriarch <unk> agreed to the request , probably at the Council of Nablus in January 1120 , and the king granted the Templars a headquarters in a wing of the royal palace on the Temple Mount in the captured Al @-@ Aqsa Mosque . The Temple Mount had a mystique because it was above what was believed to be the ruins of the Temple of Solomon . The Crusaders therefore referred to the Al Aqsa Mosque as Solomon 's Temple , and from this location the new order took the name of Poor Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon , or " Templar " knights . The order , with about nine knights including Godfrey de Saint @-@ Omer and André de Montbard , had few financial resources and relied on donations to survive . Their emblem was of two knights riding on a single horse , emphasising the order 's poverty . 
 The impoverished status of the Templars did not last long . They had a powerful advocate in Saint Bernard of Clairvaux , a leading Church figure , the French abbot primarily responsible for the founding of the Cistercian Order of monks and a nephew of André de Montbard , one of the founding knights . Bernard put his weight behind them and wrote persuasively on their behalf in the letter ' In Praise of the New Knighthood ' , and in 1129 , at the Council of Troyes , he led a group of leading churchmen to officially approve and endorse the order on behalf of the church . With this formal blessing , the Templars became a favoured charity throughout Christendom , receiving money , land , businesses , and noble @-@ born sons from families who were eager to help with the fight in the Holy Land . Another major benefit came in 1139 , when Pope Innocent II 's papal bull <unk> Datum Optimum exempted the order from obedience to local laws . This ruling meant that the Templars could pass freely through all borders , were not required to pay any taxes , and were exempt from all authority except that of the pope . 
 With its clear mission and ample resources , the order grew rapidly . Templars were often the advance shock troops in key battles of the Crusades , as the heavily armoured knights on their warhorses would set out to charge at the enemy , ahead of the main army bodies , in an attempt to break opposition lines . One of their most famous victories was in 1177 during the Battle of Montgisard , where some 500 Templar knights helped several thousand infantry to defeat Saladin 's army of more than 26 @,@ 000 soldiers . 
 Although the primary mission of the order was military , relatively few members were combatants . The others acted in support positions to assist the knights and to manage the financial infrastructure . The Templar Order , though its members were sworn to individual poverty , was given control of wealth beyond direct donations . A nobleman who was interested in participating in the Crusades might place all his assets under Templar management while he was away . Accumulating wealth in this manner throughout Christendom and the Outremer , the order in 1150 began generating letters of credit for pilgrims journeying to the Holy Land : pilgrims deposited their valuables with a local Templar preceptory before embarking , received a document indicating the value of their deposit , then used that document upon arrival in the Holy Land to retrieve their funds in an amount of treasure of equal value . This innovative arrangement was an early form of banking and may have been the first formal system to support the use of cheques ; it improved the safety of pilgrims by making them less attractive targets for thieves , and also contributed to the Templar coffers . 
 Based on this mix of donations and business dealing , the Templars established financial networks across the whole of Christendom . They acquired large tracts of land , both in Europe and the Middle East ; they bought and managed farms and vineyards ; they built massive stone cathedrals and castles ; they were involved in manufacturing , import and export ; they had their own fleet of ships ; and at one point they even owned the entire island of Cyprus . The Order of the Knights Templar arguably qualifies as the world 's first multinational corporation . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 In the mid @-@ 12th century , the tide began to turn in the Crusades . The Muslim world had become more united under effective leaders such as Saladin , and dissension arose amongst Christian factions in , and concerning , the Holy Land . The Knights Templar were occasionally at odds with the two other Christian military orders , the Knights Hospitaller and the Teutonic Knights , and decades of internecine feuds weakened Christian positions , both politically and militarily . After the Templars were involved in several unsuccessful campaigns , including the pivotal Battle of the Horns of Hattin , Jerusalem was recaptured by Muslim forces under Saladin in 1187 . The Crusaders regained the city in 1229 , without Templar aid , but held it only briefly . In 1244 , the <unk> Turks recaptured Jerusalem , and the city did not return to Western control until 1917 when the British captured it from the Ottoman Turks in World War I. 
 The Templars were forced to relocate their headquarters to other cities in the north , such as the seaport of Acre , which they held for the next century . It was lost in 1291 , followed by their last mainland strongholds , Tortosa ( Tartus in what is now Syria ) and Atlit in present @-@ day Israel . Their headquarters then moved to Limassol on the island of Cyprus , and they also attempted to maintain a garrison on tiny Arwad Island , just off the coast from Tortosa . In 1300 , there was some attempt to engage in coordinated military efforts with the Mongols via a new invasion force at Arwad . In 1302 or 1303 , however , the Templars lost the island to the Egyptian Mamluks in the Siege of Arwad . With the island gone , the Crusaders lost their last foothold in the Holy Land . 
 With the order 's military mission now less important , support for the organization began to dwindle . The situation was complex , however , since during the two hundred years of their existence , the Templars had become a part of daily life throughout Christendom . The organization 's Templar Houses , hundreds of which were dotted throughout Europe and the Near East , gave them a widespread presence at the local level . The Templars still managed many businesses , and many Europeans had daily contact with the Templar network , such as by working at a Templar farm or vineyard , or using the order as a bank in which to store personal valuables . The order was still not subject to local government , making it everywhere a " state within a state " — its standing army , though it no longer had a well @-@ defined mission , could pass freely through all borders . This situation heightened tensions with some European nobility , especially as the Templars were indicating an interest in founding their own monastic state , just as the Teutonic Knights had done in Prussia and the Knights Hospitaller were doing in Rhodes . 
 = = = Arrests , charges and dissolution = = = 
 In 1305 , the new Pope Clement V , based in Avignon , France , sent letters to both the Templar Grand Master Jacques de Molay and the Hospitaller Grand Master Fulk de Villaret to discuss the possibility of merging the two orders . Neither was amenable to the idea , but Pope Clement persisted , and in 1306 he invited both Grand Masters to France to discuss the matter . De Molay arrived first in early 1307 , but de Villaret was delayed for several months . While waiting , De Molay and Clement discussed criminal charges that had been made two years earlier by an ousted Templar and were being discussed by King Philip IV of France and his ministers . It was generally agreed that the charges were false , but Clement sent the king a written request for assistance in the investigation . According to some historians , King Philip , who was already deeply in debt to the Templars from his war with the English , decided to seize upon the rumors for his own purposes . He began pressuring the church to take action against the order , as a way of freeing himself from his debts . 
 At dawn on Friday , 13 October 1307 ( a date sometimes linked with the origin of the Friday the 13th superstition ) King Philip IV ordered de Molay and scores of other French Templars to be simultaneously arrested . The arrest warrant started with the phrase : " Dieu n 'est pas content , nous avons des <unk> de la <unk> dans le Royaume " [ " God is not pleased . We have enemies of the faith in the kingdom " ] . Claims were made that during Templar admissions ceremonies , recruits were forced to spit on the Cross , deny Christ , and engage in indecent kissing ; brethren were also accused of worshiping idols , and the order was said to have encouraged homosexual practices . The Templars were charged with numerous other offences such as financial corruption , fraud , and secrecy . Many of the accused confessed to these charges under torture , and these confessions , even though obtained under duress , caused a scandal in Paris . The prisoners were coerced to confess that they had spat on the Cross : " Moi , Raymond de La Fère , 21 ans , <unk> que [ j 'ai ] <unk> trois fois sur la Croix , mais de bouche et pas de cœur " ( free translation : " I , Raymond de La Fère , 21 years old , admit that I have spat three times on the Cross , but only from my mouth and not from my heart " ) . The Templars were accused of idolatry and were suspected of worshipping either a figure known as Baphomet or a mummified severed head they recovered , amongst other artifacts , at their original headquarters on the Temple Mount that many scholars theorize might have been that of John the Baptist , among other things . 
 <unk> to Phillip 's demands , Pope Clement then issued the papal bull Pastoralis <unk> on 22 November 1307 , which instructed all Christian monarchs in Europe to arrest all Templars and seize their assets . Pope Clement called for papal hearings to determine the Templars ' guilt or innocence , and once freed of the <unk> ' torture , many Templars recanted their confessions . Some had sufficient legal experience to defend themselves in the trials , but in 1310 , having appointed the archbishop of Sens , Philippe de Marigny , to lead the investigation , Philip blocked this attempt , using the previously forced confessions to have dozens of Templars burned at the stake in Paris . 
 With Philip threatening military action unless the pope complied with his wishes , Pope Clement finally agreed to disband the order , citing the public scandal that had been generated by the confessions . At the Council of Vienne in 1312 , he issued a series of papal bulls , including Vox in excelso , which officially dissolved the order , and Ad <unk> , which turned over most Templar assets to the Hospitallers . 
 As for the leaders of the order , the elderly Grand Master Jacques de Molay , who had confessed under torture , retracted his confession . <unk> de Charney , Preceptor of Normandy , also retracted his confession and insisted on his innocence . Both men were declared guilty of being relapsed heretics , and they were sentenced to burn alive at the stake in Paris on 18 March 1314 . De Molay reportedly remained defiant to the end , asking to be tied in such a way that he could face the Notre Dame Cathedral and hold his hands together in prayer . According to legend , he called out from the flames that both Pope Clement and King Philip would soon meet him before God . His actual words were recorded on the parchment as follows : " Dieu sait qui a tort et a <unk> . Il va <unk> <unk> <unk> à ceux qui nous ont <unk> à mort " ( free translation : " God knows who is wrong and has sinned . Soon a calamity will occur to those who have condemned us to death " ) . Pope Clement died only a month later , and King Philip died in a hunting accident before the end of the year . 
 With the last of the order 's leaders gone , the remaining Templars around Europe were either arrested and tried under the Papal investigation ( with virtually none convicted ) , absorbed into other military orders such as the Knights Hospitaller , or pensioned off and allowed to live out their days peacefully . By papal decree , the property of the Templars was transferred to the Order of Hospitallers , which also absorbed many of the Templars ' members . In effect , the dissolution of the Templars could be seen as the merger of the two rival orders . Some may have fled to other territories outside Papal control , such as excommunicated Scotland or to Switzerland . Templar organizations in Portugal simply changed their name , from Knights Templar to Knights of Christ . 
 = = = Chinon Parchment = = = 
 In September 2001 , a document known as the " Chinon Parchment " dated 17 – 20 August 1308 was discovered in the Vatican Secret Archives by Barbara <unk> , apparently after having been filed in the wrong place in 1628 . It is a record of the trial of the Templars and shows that Clement absolved the Templars of all heresies in 1308 before formally disbanding the order in 1312 , as did another Chinon Parchment dated 20 August 1308 addressed to Philip IV of France , also mentioning that all Templars that had confessed to heresy were " restored to the Sacraments and to the unity of the Church " . This other Chinon Parchment has been well @-@ known to historians , having been published by Étienne <unk> in 1693 and by Pierre Dupuy in 1751 . 
 The current position of the Roman Catholic Church is that the medieval persecution of the Knights Templar was unjust , that nothing was inherently wrong with the order or its rule , and that Pope Clement was pressed into his actions by the magnitude of the public scandal and by the dominating influence of King Philip IV , who was Clement 's relative . 
 = = Organization = = 
 The Templars were organized as a monastic order similar to Bernard 's Cistercian Order , which was considered the first effective international organization in Europe . The organizational structure had a strong chain of authority . Each country with a major Templar presence ( France , Poitou , Anjou , Jerusalem , England , Aragon , Portugal , Italy , Tripoli , Antioch , Hungary , and Croatia ) had a Master of the Order for the Templars in that region . 
 All of them were subject to the Grand Master , appointed for life , who oversaw both the order 's military efforts in the East and their financial holdings in the West . The Grand Master exercised his authority via the visitors @-@ general of the order , who were knights specially appointed by the Grand Master and convent of Jerusalem to visit the different provinces , correct malpractices , introduce new regulations , and resolve important disputes . The visitors @-@ general had the power to remove knights from office and to suspend the Master of the province concerned . 
 No precise numbers exist , but it is estimated that at the order 's peak there were between 15 @,@ 000 and 20 @,@ 000 Templars , of whom about a tenth were actual knights . 
 = = = Ranks within the order = = = 
 = = = = Three main ranks = = = = 
 There was a threefold division of the ranks of the Templars : the noble knights , the non @-@ noble sergeants , and the chaplains . The Templars did not perform knighting ceremonies , so any knight wishing to become a Knight Templar had to be a knight already . They were the most visible branch of the order , and wore the famous white mantles to symbolise their purity and chastity . They were equipped as heavy cavalry , with three or four horses and one or two squires . Squires were generally not members of the order but were instead outsiders who were hired for a set period of time . Beneath the knights in the order and drawn from non @-@ noble families were the sergeants . They brought vital skills and trades such as blacksmithing and building , and administered many of the order 's European properties . In the Crusader States , they fought alongside the knights as light cavalry with a single horse . Several of the order 's most senior positions were reserved for sergeants , including the post of Commander of the Vault of Acre , who was the de facto Admiral of the Templar fleet . The sergeants wore black or brown . From 1139 , chaplains constituted a third Templar class . They were ordained priests who cared for the Templars ' spiritual needs . All three classes of brother wore the order 's red cross . 
 = = = = Grand Masters = = = = 
 Starting with founder Hugues de Payens in 1118 – 1119 , the order 's highest office was that of Grand Master , a position which was held for life , though considering the martial nature of the order , this could mean a very short tenure . All but two of the Grand Masters died in office , and several died during military campaigns . For example , during the Siege of Ascalon in 1153 , Grand Master Bernard de <unk> led a group of 40 Templars through a breach in the city walls . When the rest of the Crusader army did not follow , the Templars , including their Grand Master , were surrounded and beheaded . Grand Master Gérard de Ridefort was beheaded by Saladin in 1189 at the Siege of Acre . 
 The Grand Master oversaw all of the operations of the order , including both the military operations in the Holy Land and Eastern Europe and the Templars ' financial and business dealings in Western Europe . Some Grand Masters also served as battlefield commanders , though this was not always wise : several blunders in de Ridefort 's combat leadership contributed to the devastating defeat at the Battle of Hattin . The last Grand Master was Jacques de Molay , burned at the stake in Paris in 1314 by order of King Philip IV . 
 = = = Behaviour , clothing and beards = = = 
 Bernard de Clairvaux and founder Hugues de Payens devised the specific code of behaviour for the Templar Order , known to modern historians as the Latin Rule . Its 72 clauses defined the ideal behaviour for the Knights , such as the types of garments they were to wear and how many horses they could have . Knights were to take their meals in silence , eat meat no more than three times per week , and not have physical contact of any kind with women , even members of their own family . A Master of the Order was assigned " 4 horses , and one chaplain @-@ brother and one clerk with three horses , and one sergeant brother with two horses , and one gentleman valet to carry his shield and lance , with one horse . " As the order grew , more guidelines were added , and the original list of 72 clauses was expanded to several hundred in its final form . 
 The knights wore a white surcoat with a red cross and a white mantle also with a red cross ; the sergeants wore a black tunic with a red cross on the front and a black or brown mantle . The white mantle was assigned to the Templars at the Council of Troyes in 1129 , and the cross was most probably added to their robes at the launch of the Second Crusade in 1147 , when Pope Eugenius III , King Louis VII of France , and many other notables attended a meeting of the French Templars at their headquarters near Paris . According to their Rule , the knights were to wear the white mantle at all times , even being forbidden to eat or drink unless they were wearing it . 
 The red cross that the Templars wore on their robes was a symbol of martyrdom , and to die in combat was considered a great honour that assured a place in heaven . There was a cardinal rule that the warriors of the order should never surrender unless the Templar flag had fallen , and even then they were first to try to regroup with another of the Christian orders , such as that of the Hospitallers . Only after all flags had fallen were they allowed to leave the battlefield . This uncompromising principle , along with their reputation for courage , excellent training , and heavy armament , made the Templars one of the most feared combat forces in medieval times . 
 Although not prescribed by the Templar Rule , it later became customary for members of the order to wear long and prominent beards . In about 1240 , Alberic of Trois @-@ <unk> described the Templars as an " order of bearded brethren " ; while during the interrogations by the papal commissioners in Paris in 1310 – 11 , out of nearly 230 knights and brothers questioned , 76 are described as wearing a beard , in some cases specified as being " in the style of the Templars " , and 133 are said to have shaved off their beards , either in renunciation of the order or because they had hoped to escape detection . 
 Initiation , known as Reception ( <unk> ) into the order , was a profound commitment and involved a solemn ceremony . Outsiders were discouraged from attending the ceremony , which aroused the suspicions of medieval inquisitors during the later trials . New members had to willingly sign over all of their wealth and goods to the order and take vows of poverty , chastity , piety , and obedience . Most brothers joined for life , although some were allowed to join for a set period . Sometimes a married man was allowed to join if he had his wife 's permission , but he was not allowed to wear the white mantle . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 With their military mission and extensive financial resources , the Knights Templar funded a large number of building projects around Europe and the Holy Land . Many of these structures are still standing . Many sites also maintain the name " Temple " because of centuries @-@ old association with the Templars . For example , some of the Templars ' lands in London were later rented to lawyers , which led to the names of the Temple Bar gateway and the Temple Underground station . Two of the four Inns of Court which may call members to act as barristers are the Inner Temple and Middle Temple . 
 Distinctive architectural elements of Templar buildings include the use of the image of " two knights on a single horse " , representing the Knights ' poverty , and round buildings designed to resemble the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem . 
 = = = Modern organizations = = = 
 The story of the persecution and sudden dissolution of the secretive yet powerful medieval Templars has drawn many other groups to use alleged connections with the Templars as a way of enhancing their own image and mystery . There is no clear historical connection between the Knights Templar , which were dismantled in the Rolls of the Catholic Church in 1309 with the martyrdom of Jacques de Molay , and any of the modern organizations , of which , except for the Scottish order , the earliest emerged publicly in the 18th century . There is often public confusion and many overlook the 400 @-@ year gap . However , in 1853 , Napoleon III officially recognised the <unk> . The order operates on the basis of the traditions of the medieval Knights Templar , celebrating the spirit of , but not claiming direct descent from the ancient order founded by Hugues de Payens in 1118 and dissolved by Pope Clement V in 1312 . 
 The 19th Century German Templers did not claim any direct or indirect descent from the medieval knights , their name having a completely different origin . 
 = = = = Freemasonry = = = = 
 Since at least the 18th century , Freemasonry has incorporated symbols and rituals of several medieval military orders in a number of Masonic bodies , most notably , in the " Red Cross of Constantine " ( derived from the Military Constantinian Order ) , the " Order of Malta " ( derived from the Sovereign Military Order of Malta ) , and the " Order of the Temple " , the latter two featuring prominently in the York Rite . One theory of the origins of Freemasonry claims direct descent from the historical Knights Templar through its final fourteenth @-@ century members who took refuge in Scotland whose King , Robert the Bruce was excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church at the time , or in Portugal where the order changed its name to Knights of Christ , other members having joined Knights of St. John . There have even been claims that some of the Templars who made it to Scotland contributed to the Scots ' victory at Bannockburn . This theory is usually deprecated on grounds of lack of evidence , by both Masonic authorities and historians . 
 The penalty of excommunication for joining the Masonic Lodge was explicit in the 1917 code of canon law ( canon 2335 ) , and it is implicit in the 1983 code ( canon 1374 ) . Because the revised code of canon law is not explicit on this point , some drew the mistaken conclusion that the church 's prohibition of Freemasonry had been dropped . As a result of this confusion , shortly before the 1983 code was promulgated , the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a statement indicating that the penalty was still in force . This statement was dated 26 November 1983 and may be found in Origins 13 / 27 ( Nov. 15 , 1983 ) , 450 . 
 = = = Modern popular culture = = = 
 Based on <unk> speculation and popular literature since the 19th century , the Templars and associated " legends " or " mysteries " have become a common trope in modern pop culture . 
 Beginning in the 1960s , there have been speculative popular publications surrounding the order 's early occupation of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and speculation about what relics the Templars may have found there , such as the Holy Grail or the Ark of the Covenant , or the historical accusation of idol worship ( Baphomet ) transformed into a context of " witchcraft " . 
 The association of the Holy Grail with the Templars has precedents even in 12th century fiction ; Wolfram von Eschenbach 's Parzival calls the knights guarding the Grail Kingdom <unk> , apparently a conscious fictionalisation of the <unk> . 
 Modern fictionalisation of the Templars begins with Ivanhoe , the 1820 novel by Walter Scott , where the villain Sir Brian de Bois @-@ Guilbert is a " Templar Knight " . 
 The popular treatment of the Templars as a topic of esotericist " legend " and " mystery " begins in the later 20th century . The historical novel series Les Rois maudits ( 1955 – 1977 ) by Maurice Druon depicts the death of the last Grand Master of the Order , and plays with the legend of the curse he laid on the pope , Philip the Fair and Guillaume de <unk> . <unk> treatments become common in the 1980s . Among them , the 1982 The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail would prove most influential . 
 The 1988 novel by Umberto Eco Foucault 's Pendulum satirizes the presentation of the Templars in esotericist or pseudohistorical conspiracy theories . A revival of the 1980s themes took place in the 2000s due to the commercial success of The Da Vinci Code , the 2003 novel by Dan Brown ( adapted into a film version in 2006 ) . 
 The Michoacán @-@ based Mexican criminal organization of The Knights Templar Cartel are named after the order and have based some of their iconography on it , including the appearance of medieval knights on the cover of their manifesto and code of conduct . 
 In the video game series Assassin 's Creed , the Templars are the antagonists who have waged a war against an organization called the Assassins . Some of the Templar grand masters , such as Robert de Sablé and Jacques de Molay appear in the games while some other historical figures such as Pope Alexander VI , Laureano de Torres y Ayala and François @-@ Thomas Germain are depicted as templar <unk> are antagonists for most of the series but they are the main protagonists in Assassin 's Creed Rogue .

 Dance , Voldo , Dance is a machinima @-@ based music video produced in 2002 by Chris Brandt . The video , created using the fighting game Soulcalibur , features two players both controlling the character Voldo , using existing in @-@ game animation to have the characters perform a synchronized dance to the song " Hot in Herre " by musician Nelly . The result of over a week 's full @-@ time preparation and training , the video was conceived after Brandt noticed the character 's animations and attacks could be triggered in sync with the beat of a song , and the reactions of onlookers to such a display . While several groups demonstrated interest in showcasing the video , complications arose from the copyright holders whose works were involved in creation . 
 The video has been well received , cited as one of the first examples of machinima @-@ based music videos , and has since spawned several fan @-@ based imitations with Voldo dancing to various songs . Several sources such as The Village Voice have praised the video for its choreography and presentation , while several books and college professors have cited it as a notable example of machinima animation in lectures on the subject . It was also nominated at the 2005 Machinima Film Festival awards for Best Virtual Performance , and served as part of an exhibit for the San Jose Museum of Art . 
 = = Conception and creation = = 
 In February 2002 , while listening to music and playing Soulcalibur with Jesse Reklaw with both playing as Voldo , Chris Brandt noticed that because Reklaw didn 't often play video games , he often utilized repetitive motions on the controller to attack . Brandt decided to mimic his gameplay , resulting in what he describes as " an impromptu dance of sorts " . When the music playing in the background changed to " Move Bitch " , Brandt noticed a consistent time interval for all of Voldo 's motions , and had the character 's movement follow the beat of the music . Reklaw noticed and followed in rhythm , entertaining onlookers with the results . Later in September , Brandt met up with Reklaw and other friends , and the subject turned to what had happened in February . Deciding to demonstrate it , the two played against each other using Voldo again , with the characters " dancing " to various songs . Noticing the audience seemed to enjoy the homoerotic nature of Voldo 's animation , and decided to develop something from the concept . 
 In October , after realizing he lacked the funds to pursue the projects he wanted to , he decided instead to work on the Voldo video project using the song " Hot in Herre " . However , the only partner he had to create the video with was his roommate , who wished to be credited anonymously as " <unk> . M. " and initially wanted nothing to do with it . After seeing Brandt work on the concept by himself however , M. decided to help under the stipulation that the project 's schedule fit around his drinking habit . Development of the choreography was completed the next day , and the following five days were devoted to producing the video at five @-@ hour intervals for each day , while the music played through the television via a PlayStation 2 's audio cable . However , by the fifth day , both realized that the music was actually distracting , and Brandt recorded himself counting out the beat of the song . Using this as the audio track , they were able to complete the project easily , and after editing the video Brandt released two versions online , with the latter utilizing the song " Kiss " by Prince . 
 Attention was drawn in 2004 to the video by Brody Condon , who had shown the video at a gaming / machinima conference in Australia . Interest was shown by <unk> , MTV , and Microsoft to feature the video on their respective media ; however , they hit complications with both the copyright holders of Soulcalibur , Namco , and Nelly , whose agents wanted $ 100 @,@ 000 to license the song . To rectify the latter problem , Brandt contacted a musician he had worked with on another project , Tana <unk> , who 'd expressed interest in producing his own music for the character , to produce a song that sounded similar to the original without infringing on the copyright , producing the " final " version of the video . However , shortly thereafter Namco explicitly stated they would not license the character for such means , and discussions ceased .

 Since its release , Dance , Voldo , Dance has been well received by the public , appearing briefly on the popularity index <unk> 's " Top 10 " . Several fan @-@ made machinima have followed suit , each using the same concept of two Voldo characters dancing to various songs . In 2005 , it was nominated for Best Virtual Performance at the Machinima Film Festival . In 2006 , from January 21 to April 29 it was featured at the San Jose Museum of Art as part of their " Heavenly Bodies " exhibit . 
 At the 2006 Machinima Film Festival , Machinima.com founder Hugh Hancock and Academy of Machinima Arts & Sciences founder Paul Marino cited Dance , Voldo , Dance as one of the first examples of machinima @-@ based music videos . The book <unk> : The User Manual described it as a difficult form of machinima to characterize , describing it " genre @-@ bending work " and having elements of puppetry , moviemaking , and choreography . Another book , The Machinima Reader , described it as " an ingenious fight @-@ as @-@ dance choreography " , citing the " sexualized virtual identity " of the character combined with the original soundtrack . In Developing Interactive Narrative Content , Georgia Institute of Technology assistant professor Michael Nitsche compared the animation to virtual puppetry in that it was rooted solely on in @-@ game animation , yet also used it as an example to illustrate that such material could be entertaining . In Medien <unk> Imagination , the motions used in the video were described as both descriptive and often prescriptive , comparing it to time and motion studies . 
 The Village Voice described it as a " virtuoso in @-@ game performance " , describing it as one of the most impressive works showcased at 2005 Machinima Film Festival . The book Playing with Videogames called it " extraordinarily skillful and humorous " , citing it as both a suspension of the game 's normal purpose by players with " parodic humor " and one of the defining moments in machinima . In a study of video games as an art form , University of Montreal lecturer Martin Picard cited it as an example of machinima and performance , calling it " perfectly choreographed " and a " superb example of gameplay and performance " . University of California professor Michael <unk> stated he enjoyed the dance performance of the presentation in light of more narrative forms of machinima , adding that it was enhanced by Voldo 's " S & M attire " .

The characters themselves are often composed of parts that may represent physical objects , abstract notions , or pronunciation . Literacy requires the memorization of a great many characters : educated Chinese know about 4 @,@ 000 . The large number of Chinese characters has in part led to the adoption of Western alphabets as an auxiliary means of representing Chinese . 
 Various current Chinese characters have been traced back to the late Shang Dynasty about 1200 – 1050 BC , but the process of creating characters is thought to have begun some centuries earlier . After a period of variation and evolution , Chinese characters were standardized under the Qin Dynasty ( 221 – 206 BC ) . Over the millennia , these characters have evolved into well @-@ developed styles of Chinese calligraphy . Chinese speakers in disparate dialect groups are able to communicate through writing because standard written Chinese is based on a standard spoken language ( " Mandarin " ) and previously on Classical Chinese . Although most other varieties of Chinese are not written , there are traditions of written Cantonese , written Hokkien , and written Shanghainese , among others . 
 Some Chinese characters have been adopted as part of the writing systems of other East Asian languages , such as Japanese , Korean , and ( formerly ) Vietnamese . 
 = = Structure = = 
 Written Chinese is not based on an alphabet or a compact syllabary . Instead , Chinese characters are glyphs whose components may depict objects or represent abstract notions . Occasionally a character consists of only one component ; more commonly two or more components are combined to form more complex characters , using a variety of different principles . The best known exposition of Chinese character composition is the Shuowen Jiezi , compiled by Xu Shen around 120 AD . Since Xu Shen did not have access to Chinese characters in their earliest forms , his analysis cannot always be taken as authoritative . Nonetheless , no later work has supplanted the Shuowen Jiezi in terms of breadth , and it is still relevant to etymological research today . 
 = = = Derivation of characters = = = 
 According to the Shuowen Jiezi , Chinese characters are developed on six basic principles . ( These principles , though popularized by the Shuowen Jiezi , were developed earlier ; the oldest known mention of them is in the Rites of Zhou , a text from about 150 BC . ) The first two principles produce simple characters , known as <unk> <unk> : 
 <unk> <unk> : <unk> , in which the character is a graphical depiction of the object it denotes . Examples : 人 rén " person " , 日 <unk> " sun " , 木 mù " tree / wood " . 
 <unk> <unk> : <unk> , or <unk> , in which the character represents an abstract notion . Examples : 上 shàng " up " , 下 <unk> " down " , <unk> sān " three " . 
 The remaining four principles produce complex characters historically called 字 zì ( although this term is now generally used to refer to all characters , whether simple or complex ) . Of these four , two construct characters from simpler parts : 
 <unk> / <unk> huìyì : Logical aggregates , in which two or more parts are used for their meaning . This yields a composite meaning , which is then applied to the new character . Example : <unk> / <unk> <unk> " east " , which represents a sun rising in the trees . 
 <unk> / <unk> <unk> : Phonetic complexes , in which one part — often called the radical — indicates the general semantic category of the character ( such as water @-@ related or eye @-@ related ) , and the other part is another character , used for its phonetic value . Example : <unk> <unk> " clear / fair ( weather ) " , which is composed of 日 <unk> " sun " , and 青 <unk> " blue / green " , which is used for its pronunciation . 
 In contrast to the popular conception of Chinese as a primarily pictographic or ideographic language , the vast majority of Chinese characters ( about 95 percent of the characters in the Shuowen Jiezi ) are constructed as either logical aggregates or , more often , phonetic complexes . In fact , some phonetic complexes were originally simple pictographs that were later augmented by the addition of a semantic root . An example is <unk> <unk> " candle " ( now archaic , meaning " <unk> " ) , which was originally a pictograph <unk> , a character that is now pronounced <unk> and means " host " . The character 火 <unk> " fire " was added to indicate that the meaning is fire @-@ related . 
 The last two principles do not produce new written forms ; instead , they transfer new meanings to existing forms : 
 <unk> / <unk> <unk> : Transference , in which a character , often with a simple , concrete meaning takes on an extended , more abstract meaning . Example : <unk> / <unk> <unk> " net " , which was originally a pictograph depicting a fishing net . Over time , it has taken on an extended meaning , covering any kind of lattice ; for instance , it can be used to refer to a computer network . 
 <unk> <unk> : Borrowing , in which a character is used , either intentionally or accidentally , for some entirely different purpose . Example : <unk> gē " older brother " , which is written with a character originally meaning " song / sing " , now written <unk> gē . Once , there was no character for " older brother " , so an otherwise unrelated character with the right pronunciation was borrowed for that meaning . 
 Chinese characters are written to fit into a square , even when composed of two simpler forms written side @-@ by @-@ side or top @-@ to @-@ bottom . In such cases , each form is compressed to fit the entire character into a square . 
 = = = Strokes = = = 
 Character components can be further subdivided into strokes . The strokes of Chinese characters fall into eight main categories : horizontal ( 一 ) , vertical ( <unk> ) , left @-@ falling ( <unk> ) , right @-@ falling ( <unk> ) , rising ( lower element of <unk> ) , dot ( 、 ) , hook ( <unk> ) , and turning ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . ) . 
 There are eight basic rules of stroke order in writing a Chinese character : 
 Horizontal strokes are written before vertical ones . 
 Left @-@ falling strokes are written before right @-@ falling ones . 
 Characters are written from top to bottom . 
 Characters are written from left to right . 
 If a character is framed from above , the frame is written first . 
 If a character is framed from below , the frame is written last . 
 Frames are closed last . 
 In a symmetrical character , the middle is drawn first , then the sides . 
 These rules do not strictly apply to every situation and are occasionally violated . 
 = = = Layout = = = 
 Chinese characters conform to a roughly square frame and are not usually linked to one another , so they can be written in any direction in a square grid . Traditionally , Chinese was written in vertical columns from top to bottom ; the first column being on the right side of the page , and the last column on the left . Text written in Classical Chinese also uses little or no punctuation . In such cases , sentence and phrase breaks are determined by context and rhythm . This layout is still sometimes used in letters and formal documents . 
 In modern times , the familiar Western layout of horizontal rows from left to right , read from the top of the page to the bottom , has become more popular , especially in the People 's Republic of China ( mainland China ) , where the government mandated left @-@ to @-@ right writing in 1955 . The government of the Republic of China ( Taiwan ) followed suit in 2004 for official documents . The use of punctuation has also become more common , whether the text is written in columns or rows . The punctuation marks are clearly influenced by their Western counterparts , although some marks are particular to Asian languages : for example , the double and single quotation marks ( 『 』 and 「 」 ) ; the hollow period ( 。 ) , which is otherwise used just like an ordinary period ; and a special kind of comma called an enumeration comma ( 、 ) , which is used to separate items in a list , as opposed to clauses in a sentence . 
 Signs are a particularly challenging aspect of written Chinese layout , since they can be written either left to right or right to left ( the latter can be thought of as the traditional layout with each " column " being one character high ) , as well as from top to bottom . It is not uncommon to encounter all three orientations on signs on neighboring stores . 
 = = Evolution = = 
 Chinese is one of the oldest continually used writing systems still in use . The earliest generally accepted examples of Chinese writing date back to the reign of the Shang Dynasty king Wu Ding ( 1250 – 1192 BC ) . These were divinatory inscriptions on oracle bones , primarily ox scapulae and turtle shells . Characters were carved on the bones in order to frame a question ; the bones were then heated over a fire and the resulting cracks were interpreted to determine the answer . Such characters are called <unk> <unk> " shell @-@ bone script " or oracle bone script . 
 In 2003 , some 11 isolated symbols carved on tortoise shells were found at Jiahu , an archaeological site in the Henan province of China , some bearing a striking resemblance to certain modern characters , such as <unk> mù " eye " . Since the Jiahu site dates from about 6600 BC , it predates the earliest confirmed Chinese writing by more than 5 @,@ 000 years . Dr Garman Harbottle , of the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York , US , who headed a team of archaeologists at the University of Science and Technology of China , in Anhui province , has suggested that these symbols were precursors of Chinese writing , but Professor David Keightley , of the University of California , Berkeley , US whose field of expertise is the origins of Chinese civilization in the Neolithic and early Bronze Ages , employing archaeological and inscriptional evidence , suggests that the time gap is too great for a connection . 
 From the late Shang Dynasty , Chinese writing evolved into the form found in cast inscriptions on Chinese ritual bronzes made during the Western Zhou Dynasty ( c 1066 – 770 BC ) and the Spring and Autumn Period ( 770 – 476 BC ) , a kind of writing called <unk> <unk> " metal script " . <unk> characters are less angular and <unk> than the oracle bone script . Later , in the Warring States period ( 475 – 221 BC ) , the script became still more regular , and settled on a form , called <unk> / <unk> <unk> <unk> " script of the six states " , that Xu Shen used as source material in the Shuowen Jiezi . These characters were later embellished and stylized to yield the seal script , which represents the oldest form of Chinese characters still in modern use . They are used principally for signature seals , or chops , which are often used in place of a signature for Chinese documents and artwork . Li Si promulgated the seal script as the standard throughout the empire during the Qin dynasty , then newly unified . 
 Seal script in turn evolved into the other surviving writing styles ; the first writing style to follow was the clerical script . The development of such a style can be attributed to those of the Qin Dynasty who were seeking to create a convenient form of written characters for daily usage . In general , clerical script characters are " flat " in appearance , being wider than the seal script , which tends to be taller than it is wide . Compared with the seal script , clerical script characters are strikingly rectilinear . In running script , a semi @-@ cursive form , the character elements begin to run into each other , although the characters themselves generally remain separate . Running script eventually evolved into grass script , a fully cursive form , in which the characters are often entirely unrecognizable by their canonical forms . Grass script gives the impression of anarchy in its appearance , and there is indeed considerable freedom on the part of the calligrapher , but this freedom is circumscribed by conventional " abbreviations " in the forms of the characters . Regular script , a non @-@ cursive form , is the most widely recognized script . In regular script , each stroke of each character is clearly drawn out from the others . Even though both the running and grass scripts appear to be derived as semi @-@ cursive and cursive variants of regular script , it is in fact the regular script that was the last to develop . 
 Regular script is considered the archetype for Chinese writing , and forms the basis for most printed forms . In addition , regular script imposes a stroke order , which must be followed in order for the characters to be written correctly . ( Strictly speaking , this stroke order applies to the clerical , running , and grass scripts as well , but especially in the running and grass scripts , this order is occasionally deviated from . ) Thus , for instance , the character 木 mù " wood " must be written starting with the horizontal stroke , drawn from left to right ; next , the vertical stroke , from top to bottom ; next , the left diagonal stroke , from top to bottom ; and lastly the right diagonal stroke , from top to bottom . 
 = = = Simplified and traditional Chinese = = = 
 In the 20th century , written Chinese divided into two canonical forms , called simplified Chinese and traditional Chinese . Simplified Chinese was developed in mainland China in order to make the characters faster to write ( especially as some characters had as many as a few dozen strokes ) and easier to memorize . The People 's Republic of China claims that both goals have been achieved , but some external observers disagree . Little systematic study has been conducted on how simplified Chinese has affected the way Chinese people become literate ; the only studies conducted before it was standardized in mainland China seem to have been statistical ones regarding how many strokes were saved on average in samples of running text . 
 The simplified forms have also been criticized for being inconsistent . For instance , traditional <unk> <unk> " allow " is simplified to <unk> , in which the phonetic on the right side is reduced from 17 strokes to just three . ( The speech radical on the left has also been simplified . ) However , the same phonetic is used in its full form , even in simplified Chinese , in such characters as <unk> <unk> " soil " and <unk> <unk> " <unk> " ; these forms remained uncontracted because they were relatively uncommon and would therefore represent a negligible stroke reduction . On the other hand , some simplified forms are simply long standing calligraphic abbreviations , as for example <unk> <unk> " ten thousand " , for which the traditional Chinese form is <unk> . 
 Simplified Chinese is standard in the People 's Republic of China , Singapore , and Malaysia . Traditional Chinese is retained in Hong Kong , Taiwan , Macau and overseas Chinese communities ( except Singapore and Malaysia ) . Throughout this article , Chinese text is given in both simplified and traditional forms when they differ , with the traditional forms being given first . 
 = = Function = = 
 At the inception of written Chinese , spoken Chinese was monosyllabic ; that is , Chinese words expressing independent concepts ( objects , actions , relations , etc . ) were usually one syllable . Each written character corresponded to one monosyllabic word . The spoken language has since become polysyllabic , but because modern polysyllabic words are usually composed of older monosyllabic words , Chinese characters have always been used to represent individual Chinese syllables . 
 For over two thousand years , the prevailing written standard was a vocabulary and syntax rooted in Chinese as spoken around the time of Confucius ( about 500 BC ) , called Classical Chinese , or <unk> <unk> . Over the centuries , Classical Chinese gradually acquired some of its grammar and character senses from the various dialects . This accretion was generally slow and minor ; however , by the 20th century , Classical Chinese was distinctly different from any contemporary dialect , and had to be learned separately . Once learned , it was a common medium for communication between people speaking different dialects , many of which were mutually unintelligible by the end of the first millennium AD . A Mandarin speaker might say yī , a Cantonese <unk> , and a Hokkien chit , but all three will understand the character 一 " one " . 
 Chinese dialects vary by not only pronunciation , but also , to a lesser extent , vocabulary and grammar . Modern written Chinese , which replaced Classical Chinese as the written standard as an indirect result of the May Fourth Movement of 1919 , is not technically bound to any single dialect ; however , it most nearly represents the vocabulary and syntax of Mandarin , by far the most widespread Chinese dialect in terms of both geographical area and number of speakers . This version of written Chinese is called Vernacular Chinese , or <unk> / <unk> <unk> ( literally , " plain speech " ) . Despite its ties to the dominant Mandarin dialect , Vernacular Chinese also permits some communication between people of different dialects , limited by the fact that Vernacular Chinese expressions are often ungrammatical or <unk> in non @-@ Mandarin dialects . This role may not differ substantially from the role of other linguae <unk> , such as Latin : For those trained in written Chinese , it serves as a common medium ; for those untrained in it , the graphic nature of the characters is in general no aid to common understanding ( characters such as " one " notwithstanding ) . In this regard , Chinese characters may be considered a large and inefficient phonetic script . However , <unk> 'ad Zuckermann ’ s exploration of phono @-@ semantic matching in Standard Chinese concludes that the Chinese writing system is multifunctional , conveying both semantic and phonetic content . 
 The variation in vocabulary among dialects has also led to the informal use of " dialectal characters " , as well as standard characters that are nevertheless considered archaic by today 's standards . Cantonese is unique among non @-@ Mandarin regional languages in having a written colloquial standard , used in Hong Kong and overseas , with a large number of unofficial characters for words particular to this dialect . Written colloquial Cantonese has become quite popular in online chat rooms and instant messaging , although for formal written communications Cantonese speakers still normally use Vernacular Chinese . To a lesser degree Hokkien is used in a similar way in Taiwan and elsewhere , although it lacks the level of standardization seen in Cantonese . However , the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China is currently releasing a standard character set for Hokkien , which is to be taught in schools and promoted amongst the general population .

 Chinese characters were first introduced into Japanese sometime in the first half of the first millennium AD , probably from Chinese products imported into Japan through Korea . At the time , Japanese had no native written system , and Chinese characters were used for the most part to represent Japanese words with the corresponding meanings , rather than similar pronunciations . A notable exception to this rule was the system of man 'yōgana , which used a small set of Chinese characters to help indicate pronunciation . The man 'yōgana later developed into the phonetic <unk> , hiragana and katakana . 
 Chinese characters are called <unk> in Mandarin , after the Han Dynasty of China ; in Japanese , this was pronounced kanji . In modern written Japanese , kanji are used for most nouns , verb stems , and adjective stems , while hiragana are used for grammatical elements and miscellaneous words that have no common kanji rendition ; katakana are used for transliteration of loanwords from other languages , the names of plants , animals and certain scientific or technical words , onomatopoeia and emphasis . The <unk> kanji , a list of kanji for common use standardized by the Japanese government , contains 2 @,@ 136 characters — about half the number of characters commanded by literate Chinese . 
 The role of Chinese characters in Korean and Vietnamese is much more limited . At one time , many Chinese characters ( called hanja ) were introduced into Korean for their meaning , just as in Japanese . Today , Korean is written almost exclusively using the Hangul alphabet with a small number of Chinese characters . Each square block character contains Hangul symbols , or letters , that together represent a syllable . Similarly , the use of Chinese and Chinese @-@ styled characters in the Vietnamese <unk> <unk> script has been almost entirely superseded by the Latin @-@ based Vietnamese alphabet . Chinese characters are still actively used in South Korea today , mostly for signs , newspapers , books , and government documents . 
 Chinese characters are also used within China to write non @-@ Han languages . The largest non @-@ Han group in China , the Zhuang , have for over 1300 years used Chinese characters . Despite both the introduction of an official alphabetic script in 1957 and lack of a corresponding official set of Chinese characters , more Zhuang people can read the Zhuang logograms than the alphabetic script . 
 = = Media = = 
 Over the history of written Chinese , a variety of media have been used for writing . They include : 
 Bamboo and wooden slips , from at least the thirteenth century BC 
 Paper , invented no later than the second century BC 
 Silk , since at least the Han dynasty 
 Stone , metal , wood , bamboo , plastic and ivory on seals . 
 Since at least the Han dynasty , such media have been used to create hanging scrolls and handscrolls . 
 = = Literacy = = 
 Because the majority of modern Chinese words contain more than one character , there are at least two measuring sticks for Chinese literacy : the number of characters known , and the number of words known . John DeFrancis , in the introduction to his Advanced Chinese Reader , estimates that a typical Chinese college graduate recognizes 4 @,@ 000 to 5 @,@ 000 characters , and 40 @,@ 000 to 60 @,@ 000 words . Jerry Norman , in Chinese , places the number of characters somewhat lower , at 3 @,@ 000 to 4 @,@ 000 . These counts are complicated by the tangled development of Chinese characters . In many cases , a single character came to be written in multiple ways . This development was restrained to an extent by the standardization of the seal script during the Qin dynasty , but soon started again . Although the Shuowen Jiezi lists 10 @,@ 516 characters — 9 @,@ 353 of them unique ( some of which may already have been out of use by the time it was compiled ) plus 1 @,@ 163 graphic variants — the <unk> of the Northern Song Dynasty , compiled less than a thousand years later in 1039 , contains 53 @,@ 525 characters , most of them graphic variants . 
 = = = Dictionaries = = = 
 Written Chinese is not based on an alphabet or syllabary , so Chinese dictionaries , as well as dictionaries that define Chinese characters in other languages , cannot easily be alphabetized or otherwise lexically ordered , as English dictionaries are . The need to arrange Chinese characters in order to permit efficient lookup has given rise to a considerable variety of ways to organize and index the characters . 
 A traditional mechanism is the method of radicals , which uses a set of character roots . These roots , or radicals , generally but imperfectly align with the parts used to compose characters by means of logical aggregation and phonetic complex . A canonical set of 214 radicals was developed during the rule of the Kangxi Emperor ( around the year 1700 ) ; these are sometimes called the Kangxi radicals . The radicals are ordered first by stroke count ( that is , the number of strokes required to write the radical ) ; within a given stroke count , the radicals also have a prescribed order . 
 Every Chinese character falls ( sometimes arbitrarily or incorrectly ) under the heading of exactly one of these 214 radicals . In many cases , the radicals are themselves characters , which naturally come first under their own heading . All other characters under a given radical are ordered by the stroke count of the character . Usually , however , there are still many characters with a given stroke count under a given radical . At this point , characters are not given in any recognizable order ; the user must locate the character by going through all the characters with that stroke count , typically listed for convenience at the top of the page on which they occur . 
 Because the method of radicals is applied only to the written character , one need not know how to pronounce a character before looking it up ; the entry , once located , usually gives the pronunciation . However , it is not always easy to identify which of the various roots of a character is the proper radical . Accordingly , dictionaries often include a list of hard to locate characters , indexed by total stroke count , near the beginning of the dictionary . Some dictionaries include almost one @-@ seventh of all characters in this list . 
 Other methods of organization exist , often in an attempt to address the shortcomings of the radical method , but are less common . For instance , it is common for a dictionary ordered principally by the Kangxi radicals to have an auxiliary index by pronunciation , expressed typically in either <unk> pinyin or <unk> <unk> . This index points to the page in the main dictionary where the desired character can be found . Other methods use only the structure of the characters , such as the four @-@ corner method , in which characters are indexed according to the kinds of strokes located nearest the four corners ( hence the name of the method ) , or the <unk> method , in which characters are broken down into a set of 24 basic components . Neither the four @-@ corner method nor the <unk> method requires the user to identify the proper radical , although many strokes or components have alternate forms , which must be memorized in order to use these methods effectively . 
 The availability of computerized Chinese dictionaries now makes it possible to look characters up by any of the indexing schemes described , thereby shortening the search process . 
 = = = Transliteration and romanization = = = 
 Chinese characters do not reliably indicate their pronunciation , even for one dialect . It is therefore useful to be able to <unk> a dialect of Chinese into the Latin alphabet or the Perso @-@ Arabic script Xiao <unk> for those who cannot read Chinese characters . However , transliteration was not always considered merely a way to record the sounds of any particular dialect of Chinese ; it was once also considered a potential replacement for the Chinese characters . This was first prominently proposed during the May Fourth Movement , and it gained further support with the victory of the Communists in 1949 . Immediately afterward , the mainland government began two parallel programs relating to written Chinese . One was the development of an alphabetic script for Mandarin , which was spoken by about two @-@ thirds of the Chinese population ; the other was the simplification of the traditional characters — a process that would eventually lead to simplified Chinese . The latter was not viewed as an impediment to the former ; rather , it would ease the transition toward the exclusive use of an alphabetic ( or at least phonetic ) script . 
 By 1958 , however , priority was given officially to simplified Chinese ; a phonetic script , <unk> pinyin , had been developed , but its deployment to the exclusion of simplified characters was pushed off to some distant future date . The association between pinyin and Mandarin , as opposed to other dialects , may have contributed to this deferment . It seems unlikely that pinyin will supplant Chinese characters anytime soon as the sole means of representing Chinese . 
 Pinyin uses the Latin alphabet , along with a few <unk> marks , to represent the sounds of Mandarin in standard pronunciation . For the most part , pinyin uses vowel and consonant letters as they are used in Romance languages ( and also in IPA ) . However , although ' b ' and ' p ' , for instance , represent the voice / unvoiced distinction in some languages , such as French , they represent the unaspirated / aspirated distinction in Mandarin ; Mandarin has few voiced consonants . Also , the pinyin spellings for a few consonant sounds are markedly different from their spellings in other languages that use the Latin alphabet ; for instance , pinyin ' q ' and ' x ' sound similar to English ' ch ' and ' sh ' , respectively . Pinyin is not the sole transliteration scheme for Mandarin — there are also , for instance , the <unk> <unk> , Wade @-@ Giles , and Gwoyeu Romatzyh systems — but it is dominant in the Chinese @-@ speaking world . All transliterations in this article use the pinyin system . 
 = HMS Belfast ( C35 ) = 
 HMS Belfast is a museum ship , originally a Royal Navy light cruiser , permanently moored in London on the River Thames and operated by the Imperial War Museum . 
 Construction of Belfast , the first Royal Navy ship to be named after the capital city of Northern Ireland , and one of ten Town @-@ class cruisers , began in December 1936 . She was launched on St Patrick 's Day , 17 March 1938 . Commissioned in early August 1939 shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War , Belfast was initially part of the British naval blockade against Germany . In November 1939 Belfast struck a German mine and spent more than two years undergoing extensive repairs . Belfast returned to action in November 1942 with improved firepower , radar equipment and armour . Belfast saw action escorting Arctic convoys to the Soviet Union during 1943 , and in December 1943 played an important role in the Battle of North Cape , assisting in the destruction of the German warship Scharnhorst . In June 1944 Belfast took part in Operation Overlord supporting the Normandy landings . In June 1945 Belfast was redeployed to the Far East to join the British Pacific Fleet , arriving shortly before the end of the Second World War . Belfast saw further combat action in 1950 – 52 during the Korean War and underwent an extensive modernisation between 1956 and 1959 . A number of further overseas commissions followed before Belfast entered reserve in 1963 . 
 In 1967 , efforts were initiated to avert Belfast 's expected scrapping and preserve her as a museum ship . A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum , the National Maritime Museum and the Ministry of Defence was established , and reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical . In 1971 the government decided against preservation , prompting the formation of the private HMS Belfast Trust to campaign for her preservation . The efforts of the Trust were successful , and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971 . Brought to London , she was moored on the River Thames near Tower Bridge in the Pool of London , in Southwark , London , England . Opened to the public in October 1971 , Belfast became a branch of the Imperial War Museum in 1978 . A popular tourist attraction , Belfast receives over a quarter of a million visitors per year . As a branch of a national museum and part of the National Historic Fleet , Belfast is supported by the Department for Culture , Media and Sport , by admissions income , and by the museum 's commercial activities . The ship was closed to visitors following an accident in November 2011 , and re @-@ opened on 18 May 2012 .

 Belfast is a cruiser of the second Town class . The Town class had originated in 1933 as the Admiralty 's response to the Imperial Japanese Navy 's Mogami @-@ class cruiser , an 11 @,@ 200 @-@ ton cruiser mounting fifteen 6 @-@ inch guns with a top speed exceeding 35 knots . The Admiralty 's requirement called for a 9 @,@ 000 ton cruiser , sufficiently armoured to withstand a direct hit from an 8 @-@ inch shell , capable of 32 knots and mounting twelve 6 @-@ inch guns . Seaplanes carried aboard would enable shipping lanes to be patrolled over a wide area , and the class was also to be capable of its own anti @-@ aircraft defence . Under the Director of Naval Construction the new design evolved during 1933 . The lead ship of the new class , the 9 @,@ 100 @-@ ton HMS Southampton , and her sister HMS Newcastle , were ordered under the 1933 estimates . Three more cruisers were built to this design , with a further three ships built to a slightly larger 9 @,@ 400 @-@ ton design in 1935 – 36 . By 1935 , however , the Admiralty was keen to improve the firepower of these cruisers to match the firepower of the Japanese <unk> and American Brooklyn @-@ class cruisers ; both were armed with fifteen 6 @-@ inch guns . The Admiralty rejected a design featuring five triple turrets as impractical , while an alternative design fitting four quadruple turrets was rejected as an effective quadruple turret could not be developed . In May 1936 the Admiralty decided to fit triple turrets , whose improved design would permit an increase in deck armour . This modified design became the 10 @,@ 000 @-@ ton Edinburgh subclass , named after Belfast 's sister ship HMS Edinburgh . Belfast was ordered from Harland and Wolff on 21 September 1936 , and her keel laid on 10 December 1936 . Her expected cost was £ 2 @,@ 141 @,@ 514 ; of which the guns cost £ 75 @,@ 000 and the aircraft ( two Supermarine Walruses ) £ 66 @,@ 500 . She was launched on Saint Patrick 's Day , 17 March 1938 , by Anne Chamberlain , the wife of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain . The launch was filmed by <unk> News . From March to August 1939 Belfast was fitted out and underwent sea trials . 
 When completed , Belfast had an overall length of 613 feet 6 inches ( 187 @.@ 0 m ) , a beam of 63 feet 4 inches ( 19 @.@ 3 m ) and a draught of 17 feet 3 inches ( 5 @.@ 3 m ) . Her standard displacement during her sea trials was 10 @,@ 420 long tons ( 10 @,@ 590 t ) . She was propelled by four three @-@ drum oil @-@ fired Admiralty water @-@ tube boilers , turning Parsons geared steam turbines , driving four propeller shafts . She was capable of 32 @.@ 5 knots ( 60 @.@ 2 km / h ; 37 @.@ 4 mph ) and carried 2 @,@ 400 long tons ( 2 @,@ 400 t ) of fuel oil . This gave her a maximum range of 8 @,@ 664 nautical miles ( 16 @,@ 046 km ; 9 @,@ 970 mi ) at 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) . 
 Belfast 's main armament comprised twelve Mk XXIII six @-@ inch guns in four triple turrets . With a rate of fire of up to eight rounds per gun per minute , her main battery was capable of a maximum rate of fire of 96 rounds per minute . Her secondary armament comprised twelve 4 @-@ inch guns in six twin mounts . Her initial close @-@ range anti @-@ aircraft armament was sixteen 2 @-@ pounder " pom @-@ pom " guns in two eight @-@ barrel mountings , and two quadruple Vickers .50 machine guns . She also mounted six Mk IV 21 @-@ inch torpedo tubes in two triple mounts , and fifteen Mk VII depth charges . 
 Belfast was protected by a 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 110 mm ) main armour belt , with deck armour of 3 inches ( 76 mm ) over her magazines , and 2 inches ( 51 mm ) over her machinery spaces . Her six @-@ inch turrets were protected by up to 4 inches ( 100 mm ) of armour . 
 Belfast 's aviation capability was provided by two catapult @-@ launched Supermarine Walrus amphibious biplanes . These could be launched from a <unk> catapult mounted aft of the forward superstructure , and recovered from the water by two cranes mounted on either side of the forward funnel . The aircraft , operated by the Fleet Air Arm 's HMS Belfast Flight of 700 Naval Air Squadron , were stowed in two hangars in the forward superstructure .

Her first captain was Captain G A Scott with a crew of 761 , and her first assignment was to the Home Fleet 's 2nd Cruiser Squadron . On 14 August Belfast took part in her first exercise , Operation Hipper , in which she played the role of a German commerce raider attempting to escape into the Atlantic . By navigating the hazardous Pentland Firth , Belfast successfully evaded the Home Fleet . 
 On 31 August 1939 Belfast was transferred to the 18th Cruiser Squadron . Based at Scapa Flow in the Orkney islands , 18th Cruiser Squadron was part of the British effort to impose a naval blockade on Germany . Germany invaded Poland the following day , and Britain and France declared war on 3 September . At 11 : 40 that morning , Belfast received the message ‘ Commence hostilities at once against Germany ’ . On 8 September Belfast put to sea from Scapa Flow with the battlecruisers Hood , Renown , her sister ship Edinburgh and four destroyers , on a patrol intended to intercept German ships returning from Norway . In particular , they were to search for the Norddeutscher Lloyd liner Europa . No enemy vessels were found . On 25 September , Belfast took part in a fleet operation to recover the submarine Spearfish , during which the ship was attacked by German aircraft , but suffered no damage . On 1 October 1939 Belfast left Scapa Flow for a patrol in the North Sea . On 5 October Belfast intercepted and boarded a neutral Norwegian factory ship that was sailing in company with six whaling ships . On 8 October the ship sighted the Swedish merchant ship C. P. <unk> but , in poor weather , did not intercept or board her . The following day she boarded Tai Yin , a Norwegian ship . Tai Yin had been listed by the Admiralty as suspicious , so a prize crew from Belfast sailed her to Kirkwall for investigation . On 9 October intercepted a German liner , the 13 @,@ 615 @-@ ton Cap Norte , 50 miles ( 80 km ) north @-@ west of the Faroe Islands . Disguised as a neutral Swedish vessel , the SS Ancona , Cap Norte was attempting to return to Germany from Brazil ; her passengers included German reservists . Under the Admiralty 's prize rules , Belfast 's crew later received prize money . On 12 October Belfast boarded the Swedish ship <unk> , which was also sailed to Kirkwall by a prize crew . Returning to harbour , on the night of 13 @-@ 14 October , Belfast was among the few ships anchored in Scapa Flow , following intelligence reports of an expected air raid . That night , the battleship Royal Oak was torpedoed by German submarine U @-@ 47 , which had infiltrated the anchorage . On the morning following the sinking , Belfast left for Loch Ewe . 
 On 10 November Belfast was taken off the northern patrol and reassigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron . This squadron was to form an independent striking force based at Rosyth . On 21 November , Belfast was to take part in the force 's first sortie , a gunnery exercise . At 10 : 58 am she struck a magnetic mine while leaving the Firth of Forth . The mine broke Belfast 's keel , and wrecked one of her engine and boiler rooms . Twenty officers and men would require hospital treatment for injuries caused by the explosion , and a further 26 suffered minor injuries . One man , Painter 2nd Class Henry Stanton , was hospitalised but later died of a head injury , having been thrown against the <unk> by the blast . The tugboat <unk> , towing gunnery targets for the exercise , released her targets and instead towed Belfast to Rosyth for initial repairs . 
 Initial assessments of Belfast 's damage showed that , while the mine had done little direct damage to the outer hull , causing only a small hole directly below one of the boiler rooms , the shock of the explosion had caused severe warping , breaking machinery , deforming the decks and causing the keel to hog ( bend upwards ) by three inches . On 4 January 1940 Belfast was decommissioned to Care and Maintenance status , becoming the responsibility of Rosyth Dockyard , and her crew dispersed to other vessels . By 28 June she had been repaired sufficiently to sail to Devonport , arriving on 30 June under the command of Lt Cdr H W Parkinson . 
 During her repairs , work was carried out to straighten , reconstruct and strengthen her hull . Her armoured belt was also extended and thickened . Her armament was updated with newer 2 @-@ pounder " pom @-@ pom " mountings , and her anti @-@ aircraft armament improved with eighteen 20 mm Oerlikon guns in five twin and eight single mountings , replacing two quadruple 0 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Vickers guns . Belfast also received new fire control radars for her main , secondary and anti @-@ aircraft guns . Her November 1942 radar fit included one Type 284 set and four Type 283 sets to direct the main armament , three Type 285 sets for the secondary guns , and two Type 285 sets for the 2 @-@ pounder anti @-@ aircraft guns . She also received a Type 273 general surface warning radar , Type 251 and 252 sets for identification friend or foe ( IFF ) purposes , and a Type 281 and Type 242 for air warning . Her 1942 electronics suite also included a Type 270 <unk> . Due to her increased topweight , a bulge was introduced into her hull amidships to improve stability and provide extra longitudinal strength . Her beam had increased to 69 ft ( 21 m ) and her draught to 19 ft ( 5 @.@ 8 m ) forward and 20 ft 2 in ( 6 @.@ 15 m ) aft . Her displacement had risen to 11 @,@ 550 tons . 
 = = = 1942 – 1943 : Recommissioning , Arctic convoys and Battle of North Cape = = = 
 Belfast was recommissioned at Devonport on 3 November 1942 , under the command of Captain Frederick Parham . On her return to the Home Fleet Belfast was made flagship of the 10th Cruiser Squadron , flying the flag of Rear @-@ Admiral Robert Burnett , who had previously commanded the Home Fleet 's destroyer flotillas . The squadron was responsible for the hazardous task of escorting Arctic convoys to the Soviet Union , operating from Scapa Flow and bases in Iceland . Her radar suite reduced Belfast 's need for aerial surveillance , and her aircraft were disembarked in June 1943 . Belfast spent 1943 engaged on convoy escort and blockade patrol duties , and on 5 – 6 October formed part of the covering force during Operation Leader , an airstrike against German shipping in northern Norway near Bodø by the aircraft carrier USS Ranger . 
 On 26 December 1943 , Belfast participated in the Battle of North Cape . This battle , which occurred during the Arctic night , involved two strong Royal Navy formations ; the first , Force One , comprised the cruisers Norfolk , Sheffield and Belfast ( the 10th Cruiser Squadron ) with three destroyers , and the second , Force Two , comprised the battleship Duke of York and the cruiser Jamaica with four destroyers . On 25 December 1943 , Christmas Day , Nazi Germany 's Scharnhorst @-@ class battleship Scharnhorst left port in northern Norway to attack Convoy <unk> , which was bound for Russia . The next day Force One encountered Scharnhorst , prevented her from attacking the convoy , and forced her to turn for home after being damaged by the British cruisers . As Scharnhorst did so , she was intercepted by Force Two and sunk by the combined formations . Belfast played an important role in the battle ; as flagship of the 10th Cruiser Squadron she was among the first to encounter Scharnhorst , and coordinated the squadron 's defence of the convoy . After Scharnhorst turned away from the convoy , Admiral Burnett in Belfast shadowed her by radar from outside visual range , enabling her interception by Duke of York . 
 = = = 1944 : Tirpitz and D @-@ Day = = = 
 After North Cape , Belfast refuelled at Kola Inlet before sailing for the United Kingdom , arriving at Scapa to replenish her fuel , ammunition and stores on New Year 's Day 1944 . Belfast sailed to Rosyth on 10 January , where her crew received a period of leave . February 1944 saw Belfast resume her Arctic convoy duties , and on 30 March 1944 Belfast sailed with the covering force of Operation Tungsten , a large carrier @-@ launched Fleet Air Arm airstrike against the German battleship Tirpitz . Moored in Altafjord in northern Norway , Tirpitz was the German navy 's last surviving capital ship . Forty @-@ two Fairey Barracuda dive @-@ bombers from HMS Victorious and HMS Furious made up the strike force , escorted by eighty fighters . Launched on 3 April , the bombers scored fourteen hits , immobilising Tirpitz for two months , with one Barracuda shot down . Belfast underwent minor repairs at Rosyth from 23 April to 8 May , while her crew received a period of leave . On 8 May Belfast returned to Scapa and carried the King during his pre @-@ invasion visit to the Home Fleet . 
 For the invasion of Normandy Belfast was made headquarters ship of Bombardment Force E flying the flag of Rear @-@ Admiral Frederick Dalrymple @-@ Hamilton , and was to support landings by British and Canadian forces in the Gold and Juno Beach sectors . On 2 June Belfast left the River Clyde for her bombardment areas . That morning Prime Minister Winston Churchill had announced his intention to go to sea with the fleet and witness the invasion from HMS Belfast . This was opposed by the Supreme Allied Commander , General Dwight D. Eisenhower , and the First Sea Lord , Sir Andrew Cunningham . An intervention by the King eventually prevented Churchill from going . 
 The invasion was to begin on 5 June but bad weather forced a 24 @-@ hour delay . At 5 : 30 am on 6 June Belfast opened fire on a German artillery battery at Ver @-@ sur @-@ Mer , suppressing the guns until the site was overrun by British infantry of 7th Battalion , Green Howards . On 12 June Belfast supported Canadian troops moving inland from Juno Beach and returned to Portsmouth on 16 June to replenish her ammunition . She returned two days later for further bombardments . On the night of 6 July Belfast was threatened at anchor by German motor torpedo boats ( " E @-@ boats " ) . She evaded them by weighing anchor and moving to the concealment of a smoke screen . Belfast fired her last round in anger in European waters on 8 July , in company with the monitor HMS Roberts and the battleship HMS Rodney , as part of Operation Charnwood . On 10 July she sailed for Scapa , the fighting in France having moved beyond the range of her guns . During her five weeks off Normandy Belfast had fired 1 @,@ 996 rounds from her six @-@ inch guns . 
 = = = 1945 : Service in the Far East = = = 
 On 29 July 1944 Captain Parham handed over command of HMS Belfast to Captain R M Dick , and until April 1945 Belfast underwent a refit to prepare for service against Japan in the Far East which improved her accommodation for tropical conditions , and updated her anti @-@ aircraft armament and fire control in order to counter expected kamikaze attacks by Japanese aircraft . By May 1945 Belfast mounted thirty @-@ six 2 @-@ pounder guns in two eight @-@ gun mounts , four quadruple mounts , and four single mounts . She also mounted fourteen 20mm Oerlikons . Her two aftmost 4 @-@ inch mountings were removed , and the remainder fitted with Remote Power Control . Her empty hangars were converted to crew accommodation , and her aircraft catapult removed . 
 Her radar fit now included a Type 277 radar set to replace her Type 273 for surface warning . Her Type 281 air warning set was replaced by a single @-@ antenna Type 281B set , while a Type 293Q was fitted for close @-@ range height @-@ finding and surface warning . A Type 274 set was fitted for main armament fire direction . On 17 June 1945 , with the war in Europe at an end , Belfast sailed for the Far East via Gibraltar , Malta , Alexandria , Port Said , Aden , Colombo and Sydney . By the time she arrived in Sydney on 7 August Belfast had been made flagship of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the British Pacific Fleet . While in Sydney Belfast underwent another short refit , supplementing her close @-@ range armament with five 40mm Bofors guns . Belfast had been expected to join in Operation Downfall , but this was forestalled by the Japanese surrender on 15 August 1945 . 
 = = Post @-@ war service 1945 – 50 = = 
 With the end of the war , Belfast remained in the Far East , conducting a number of cruises to ports in Japan , China and Malaya and sailing for Portsmouth on 20 August 1947 . There she paid off into reserve , and underwent a refit during which her turbines were opened for maintenance . She also received two more single Bofors guns , in place of two of her single 2 @-@ pounder mountings . She was recommissioned on 22 September 1948 and before returning to the Far East visited her home city of Belfast arriving on 20 October . The following day , 21 October 1948 , the ship 's company marked Trafalgar Day with a march through the city . The next day Belfast took charge of a silver ship 's bell , a gift of the people of Belfast . She sailed for Hong Kong on 23 October to join the Royal Navy 's Far East Station , arriving in late December . By 1949 , the political situation in China was precarious , with the Chinese Civil War moving towards its conclusion . As flagship of the 5th Cruiser Squadron , Belfast was the Far Eastern Station 's headquarters ship during the April 1949 Amethyst Incident , in which a British sloop , HMS Amethyst was trapped in the Yangtze River by the communist People 's Liberation Army . Belfast remained in Hong Kong during 1949 , sailing for Singapore on 18 January 1950 . There she underwent a minor refit between January and March 1950 and in June she joined the Far East Fleet 's summer cruise . On 25 June 1950 , while Belfast was visiting Hakodate in Japan , North Korean forces crossed the 38th Parallel , starting the Korean War . 
 = = Korean War 1950 – 52 = = 
 With the outbreak of the Korean War , Belfast became part of the United Nations naval forces . Originally part of the US Navy 's Task Force 77 , Belfast was detached in order to operate independently on 5 July 1950 . During July and early August Belfast undertook coastal patrols and was based at Sasebo in Japan 's Nagasaki Prefecture . From 19 July Belfast supported troops fighting around Yongdok , accompanied by the USS Juneau . That day Belfast fired an accurate 350 @-@ round bombardment from her 6 @-@ inch guns , and was praised by an American admiral as a " straight @-@ shooting ship " . On 6 August she sailed for the UK for a short ( but needed ) refit , after which she again set sail for the far east and arrived back at Sasebo on 31 January 1951 . 
 During 1951 Belfast mounted a number of coastal patrols and bombarded a variety of targets . On 1 June she arrived at Singapore for refitting , arriving back on patrol on 31 August . In September 1951 Belfast provided anti @-@ aircraft cover for a salvage operation to recover a crashed enemy MiG @-@ 15 jet fighter . She conducted further bombardments and patrols before receiving a month 's leave from operations , returning to action on 23 December . 
 In 1952 Belfast continued her coastal patrol duties . On 29 July 1952 Belfast was hit by enemy fire while engaging an artillery battery on <unk> @-@ ri island . A 75 mm shell struck a forward compartment , killing a British sailor of Chinese origin in his hammock and wounding four other Chinese ratings . This was the only time Belfast was hit by enemy fire during her Korean service . On 27 September 1952 Belfast was relieved by two other Town @-@ class cruisers , HMS Birmingham and HMS Newcastle , and sailed back to the UK . She had steamed over 80 @,@ 000 miles ( 130 @,@ 000 km ) in the combat zone and fired more than 8 @,@ 000 rounds from her 6 @-@ inch guns during the Korean War . She paid off in Chatham on 4 November 1952 and entered reserve at Devonport on 1 December . 
 = = Modernisation and final commissions 1955 – 1963 = = 
 In reserve , Belfast 's future was uncertain : post @-@ war defence cuts made manpower @-@ intensive cruisers excessively costly to operate , and it was not until March 1955 that the decision was taken to modernise Belfast . Work began on 6 January 1956 . Changes included replacing her 4 @-@ inch guns with more modern weapons of the same calibre and protecting key parts of the ship against nuclear , biological or chemical attack . This last consideration meant enclosing her bridge , creating a two @-@ tiered , five @-@ sided superstructure which radically altered her appearance . Her crew accommodation was also improved , her tripod masts replaced with lattice masts , and timber decking replaced with steel everywhere except the quarterdeck . Belfast recommissioned at Devonport on 12 May 1959 . Her close @-@ range armament was standardised to six twin Bofors gun , and her close @-@ range fire direction similarly standardised to eight close @-@ range blind fire directors fitted with Type 262 radar . Her 1959 radar fit also included Type 274 , retained for main armament direction , Type 277Q and 293Q for height @-@ finding and surface warning , Type <unk> for air warning , and 974 for surface warning . In order to save weight , her torpedo armament was removed . 
 Belfast arrived in Singapore on 16 December 1959 , and spent most of 1960 at sea on exercise , calling at ports in Hong Kong , Borneo , India , Ceylon ( now Sri Lanka ) , Australia , the Philippines and Japan . On 31 January 1961 Belfast recommissioned , under the command of Captain Morgan Morgan @-@ Giles . On her final foreign commission Belfast joined a number of exercises in the Far East , and in December 1961 she provided the British guard of honour at Tanganyika 's independence ceremony in Dar @-@ es @-@ Salaam . 
 The ship left Singapore on 26 March 1962 for the UK , sailing east via Hong Kong , Guam and Pearl Harbor , San Francisco , Seattle , British Columbia , Panama and Trinidad . She arrived at Portsmouth on 19 June 1962 . 
 Recommissioned in July , she made a final visit to Belfast from 23 – 29 November , before paying off into reserve on 25 February 1963 . In July 1963 Belfast was recommissioned for the last time , with a crew of the Royal Naval Reserve ( RNR ) and a number of Sea Cadets flying the flag of the Admiral Commanding Reserves , Rear Admiral Hugh Martell . Belfast sailed for Gibraltar in company with sixteen RNR minesweepers for a two @-@ week exercise in the Mediterranean on 10 August . Martell 's obituarist considered this commission a well @-@ judged contrivance which ' did much to restore the confidence and image of the new RNR ' which had undergone an acrimonious amalgamation with the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve in 1958 . 
 = = Reserve , decommissioning , and preservation efforts 1963 – 1971 = = 
 Belfast returned to Devonport on 24 August 1963 and underwent a short refit to prepare her for paying off into reserve , which occurred in December 1963 . In January 1966 parts of the ship and power systems were reactivated and from May 1966 to 1970 she was an accommodation ship ( taking over those duties from HMS Sheffield ) , moored in Fareham Creek , for the Reserve Division at Portsmouth . While HMS Belfast lay at Fareham Creek the Imperial War Museum , Britain 's national museum of twentieth century conflict , became interested in preserving a 6 @-@ inch turret . The turret would represent a number of classes of cruiser ( then disappearing from service ) and would complement the museum 's pair of British 15 @-@ inch naval guns . On 14 April 1967 museum staff visited HMS Gambia , a Crown Colony @-@ class cruiser also moored in Fareham Creek at the time . Following the visit the possibility was raised of preserving an entire ship . Gambia had already severely deteriorated , so attention turned to the possibility of saving Belfast . A joint committee was established by the Imperial War Museum , the National Maritime Museum and the Ministry of Defence , which reported in June 1968 that the scheme was practical and economic . However , in early 1971 the government 's Paymaster General decided against preservation . On 4 May 1971 Belfast was ' reduced to disposal ' to await scrapping . 
 = = HMS Belfast Trust 1971 – 1977 = = 
 Following the government 's refusal , a private trust was formed to campaign for the ship 's preservation . The HMS Belfast Trust was established ; its chairman was Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Morgan Morgan @-@ Giles , captain of Belfast from January 1961 to July 1962 . As Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Winchester , Morgan @-@ Giles addressed the House of Commons on 8 March 1971 . He described Belfast as being in " a really wonderful state of preservation " and that saving her for the nation represented a " case of grasping the last opportunity " . Among the MPs who spoke in support of Morgan @-@ Giles was Gordon <unk> , MP for Sunderland South , who served as a Royal Marine gunner aboard Belfast and was present at both the sinking of the Scharnhorst and the Normandy landings . Speaking for the government , the Under @-@ secretary for the Navy , Peter Michael Kirk , said that Belfast was " one of the most historic ships which the Navy has had in the last 20 years " , but that he could not prevent the stripping of the ship 's removable equipment , as this was already too far advanced to be halted . He did , however , agree to postpone any decision on the scrapping of Belfast to allow the Trust to put together a formal proposal . 
 Following the Trust 's efforts , the government agreed to hand over Belfast to the Trustees in July 1971 , with Vice Admiral Sir Donald Gibson as her first director . At a press conference in August the Trust announced " Operation Seahorse " , the plan to bring Belfast to London . She was towed from Portsmouth to London via Tilbury , where she was fitted out as a museum . She was opened to the public on Trafalgar Day , 21 October 1971 . The date was significant , as Belfast was the first naval vessel to be saved for the nation since HMS Victory , Lord Nelson 's flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar . Though no longer part of the Royal Navy , HMS Belfast was granted a special dispensation to allow her to continue to fly the White Ensign . 
 Now a museum , the ship 's opening was well received : in 1972 the HMS Belfast Trust won the British Tourist Authority 's " Come to Britain " trophy . Support for the ship 's restoration was received from individuals , from the Royal Navy , and from commercial businesses ; in 1973 , for example , the Worshipful Company of Bakers provided dummy bread for display in the ship 's NAAFI and bakery . By 1974 areas including the Admiral 's bridge and forward boiler and engine rooms had been restored and fitted out . That year also saw the refurbishment of the ship 's Operations Room by a team from HMS Vernon , and the return of Belfast 's six twin Bofors mounts , along with their fire directors . By December 1975 Belfast had received 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 visitors . In 1976 Belfast was reaffiliated with the successors to the British Army 's Royal Ulster Rifles , the Royal Irish Rangers , and in the same year the Royal Naval Amateur Radio Society restored the ship 's Bridge Wireless Office to working order . 
 = = Imperial War Museum 1978 – present = = 
 By 1977 , the financial position of the HMS Belfast Trust had become marginal , and the Imperial War Museum sought permission to merge the Trust into the museum . On 19 January 1978 the Secretary of State for Education and Science , Shirley Williams , accepted the proposal stating that HMS Belfast " is a unique demonstration of an important phase of our history and technology " . The ship was transferred to the museum on 1 March 1978 , and became the Imperial War Museum 's third branch , Duxford aerodrome having been acquired in 1976 . In October 1998 , the HMS Belfast Association was formed to reunite former members of the ship ’ s company . The Imperial War Museum 's Sound Archive also seeks to record oral history interviews with former crewmen . 
 = = = Preservation = = = 
 Since being brought to London Belfast has twice been drydocked as part of the ship ’ s long @-@ term preservation . In 1982 she was docked at Tilbury , and in June 1999 Belfast was towed to Portsmouth . This was the first time she had been to sea in 28 years and required a Certificate of <unk> from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency . While in dock , her entire hull was cleaned , blasted , and repainted , her hull blanking plates inspected and an ultrasonic survey carried out . She is not expected to require further <unk> until 2020 . While under tow to Portsmouth she was delayed by bad weather and arrived a day late : it had been intended that she would arrive on 6 June 1999 , the fifty @-@ fifth anniversary of the Normandy landings . Following the maintenance work , Belfast was repainted in a camouflage scheme officially known as Admiralty Disruptive Camouflage Type 25 , which she had worn from November 1942 to July 1944 . This was objected to by some , due to the anachronistic conflict between her camouflage , which reflects the majority of her active Second World War service , and her present configuration , which was the result of the ship 's extended refit from January 1956 to May 1959 . With the establishment of the Department for Culture , Media and Sport 's ( DCMS ) Advisory Committee on National Historic Ships in 2006 , Belfast was listed as part of the National Historic Fleet . 
 On 9 May 2010 , a ceremony was held aboard Belfast to mark the 65th anniversary of end of the war in Europe . Veterans of the Arctic convoys were in attendance to receive medals from the Russian Ambassador Yuri <unk> . During the ceremony it was announced that , as part of the restoration of the ship , two new masts had been manufactured at the Severnaya <unk> shipyard near Saint Petersburg . The production of the masts , to replace corroded originals , had been supported by a number of Russian businesses at a reported cost of £ 500 @,@ 000 . The restoration of the masts involved removing the fittings from both masts , allowing them to be individually restored . The old masts were then cut down in sections , the new masts erected , and the original fittings replaced . On 19 October 2010 , the new masts were dedicated at a ceremony attended by HMS Belfast veterans , by Prince Philip and officials from the Russian embassy and government .

 When Belfast was first opened to the public , visitors were limited to the upper decks and forward superstructure . As of 2011 , nine decks are open to the public . Access to the ship is via a walkway which connects the quarterdeck with the pedestrianised footpath on the south bank of the River Thames . The Imperial War Museum 's guidebook to HMS Belfast divides the ship into three broad sections . The first of these , ' Life on board the ship ' , focuses on the experience of serving at sea . Restored compartments , some populated with dressed figures , illustrate the crew 's living conditions and the ship 's various facilities such as the sick bay , galley , laundry , chapel , mess decks and NAAFI . Since 2002 school and youth groups have been able to stay onboard Belfast overnight , sleeping in bunks on a restored 1950s mess deck . The second section , ' The inner workings ' , below the waterline and protected by the ship 's armoured belt , contains core mechanical , electrical and communication systems . As well as the engine and boiler rooms , other compartments include the transmitting station ( housing the ship 's Admiralty Fire Control Table , a mechanical computer ) , the forward steering position and one of Belfast 's six @-@ inch shell rooms and magazines . The third section , ' Action stations ' , includes the upper deck and forward superstructure with the ship 's armament , fire control , and command facilities . Areas open to the public include the operations room , Admiral 's bridge and gun direction platform . During 2011 two of these areas were reinterpreted . The operations room was restored to its appearance during Exercise Pony Express , a large British @-@ Australian @-@ American joint exercise held off North Borneo in 1961 . The reinterpretation included an interactive audio @-@ visual plotting table . In July 2011 the interior of Y Turret , the aftmost 6 @-@ inch turret , was <unk> using audio @-@ visual and atmospheric effects , seeking to evoke the experience of a gunner at the Battle of North Cape . To emphasise the range of the ship 's armament , the forward six @-@ inch guns of A and B Turrets are aimed at the London Gateway service area on the M1 motorway , some 12 ½ miles away on the outskirts of London . A 4 @-@ inch gun mount and a shell hoist are kept in working order and used during blank @-@ firing demonstrations by the <unk> Navy re @-@ enactment group . In addition to the various areas of the ship open to visitors , some compartments have been fitted out as dedicated exhibition space . Permanent exhibitions include ' HMS Belfast in War and Peace ' and ' Life at Sea ' . The cost of admission to HMS Belfast includes a multilingual audio guide . 
 HMS Belfast is also the headquarters of the City of London Sea Cadet Corps , and her prestigious central London location means she frequently has other vessels berth alongside ; in October 2007 Belfast hosted the naming ceremony of the lighthouse tender <unk> Galatea with the Queen and Prince Philip in attendance .

 On 29 November 2011 two workmen suffered minor injuries after a section of gangway , connected to the ship , collapsed during renovation works . The ship was closed to visitors following the accident . An investigation later established that the collapse of the gangway had been caused by a subcontractor cutting through the gangway 's structure during refurbishment work . Belfast re @-@ opened on 18 May 2012 . 
 The closure delayed the construction of a new two @-@ storey bankside pavilion to replace Belfast 's existing retail and admissions building . The structure , for which planning permission was received in October 2011 , provides a ground floor café , shop and admissions area , and a rooftop bar . Previously expected to be complete in summer 2012 , the structure opened in April 2013 . 
 = Did It Again ( Shakira song ) = 
 " Did It Again " is a song recorded by Colombian singer @-@ songwriter Shakira for her eighth studio album , She Wolf ( 2009 ) . It was released on 16 October 2009 , by Epic Records , as the second single from the album . The song was written and produced by Shakira , with additional songwriting and production from Pharrell Williams and The Neptunes , respectively . There is an alternate version featuring vocals from American recording artist Kid Cudi , while its Spanish @-@ language version " Lo Hecho Está Hecho " ( English : " What Is Done Is Done " ) includes additional lyrical contributions from Uruguayan musician Jorge Drexler . " Did It Again " is an electropop song with elements of samba . Lyrically , it details Shakira 's involvement in a man 's extramarital affair , which leads to her feeling guilty and hurt about it . 
 Upon its release , " Did It Again " was well received by music critics , many of whom complimented its lyrical content . Commercially , the song attained moderate success . It peaked within the top twenty in nations including Spain , where it was certified gold , and Italy . In the United States , " Did It Again " peaked at number one on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart and Latin Pop Airplay chart , and at numbers six and 11 on the US Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart and Tropical Songs chart , respectively . An accompanying music video for " Did It Again " was directed by Sophie Muller , and features Shakira fighting a man in a bedroom . It generated a favorable response from critics and was complimented for its dance scenes . For additional promotion , Shakira performed " Did It Again " on a number of television shows .

 After the release of " She Wolf " , " Did It Again " was serviced as the next single from the album She Wolf , ( 2009 ) , and is the second single overall . " Did It Again " was written by Shakira and Pharrell Williams , and is one of the four tracks on the album Shakira co @-@ produced with The Neptunes , the others being " Long Time " , " Why Wait " , and " Good Stuff " . About her collaboration with Williams , Shakira commented , " he comes up with ideas , and he executes them immediately . It 's really cool , because I 'm a little bit slower , and he 's the man with the big strokes , and he really comes with great ideas . It was a great synergy " . A Spanish version of the song , titled " Lo Hecho Está Hecho " was also released and features additional songwriting by Jorge Drexler . Musically , " Did It Again " is a midtempo electropop song that contains elements of samba . The lyrics of the song are confessional in nature and express Shakira 's growing guilt over the fact that she is in a sexual affair with a married man , and her inability to end it , hence the title " Did It Again " . 
 Both the English and Spanish versions of the song were internationally released on 16 October 2009 . The single was not officially released in the US market , where it was substituted by " Give It Up to Me " , the third single off the album . A remix of the English version of the song , featuring additional vocals from Kid Cudi , was later released on 11 December 2009 . Cudi 's contribution to the song consisted of a rap verse halfway through the song where he " raps about bringing good vibes to Shakira 's life " .

 = = Music video = = 
 The music video for " Did It Again " was filmed in September 2009 and was directed by Sophie Muller , who had previously worked with Shakira on the music video for " Hips Don 't Lie " . Shakira cited the paintings of British painter Lawrence Alma @-@ Tadema , which detailed scenes of women in Turkish bathrooms , as an inspiration behind the video . After Shakira was introduced to a contemporary Icelandic dance form by a friend , she and Muller enlisted Icelandic choreographer Katrin Hall to choreograph the dance sequences in the video . When asked of the inspiration behind the music video for " Did It Again " , Shakira said that she and Muller " brought all these pieces — Moroccan women twirling and turning their heads , and the poetry from Alma @-@ Tadema 's paintings , plus this Icelandic contemporary dance piece — and we mixed all these pieces together for the video . " 
 The videos for both the original English version and the Spanish translation were released on 30 October 2009 . A video for the remix version of the song , featuring American rapper Kid Cudi , debuted later in December 2009 . The video starts with Shakira sitting in a steam filled bath house surrounded by other women facing her , all clad in white . The next scene shows a group of female Korean drummers performing the Korean " Three Drum Dance " . Shakira appears in a bedroom wearing black lingerie and begins fighting her partner ( played by dancer Daniel " Cloud " Campos ) in a martial arts inspired dance routine and ultimately manages to defeat him . Scenes of Shakira dancing wearing a black and golden outfit follow . Near the end of the video , all the previous scenes are rapidly interspersed . The version featuring Kid Cudi , features additional scenes of the rapper in a room . 
 The music video received generally positive reviews from critics . Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly reviewed the video positively , and said it was a " fun feat to watch her [ Shakira ] pull off " . Story Gilmore from Neon Limelight called the fight between Shakira and her partner an " angry yet passion filled tussle " and the video a " smoking hot winner " . Elena Gorgan from Softpedia , praised Shakira 's dance moves and noted that she " comes very close to perfection in terms of artistic dancing " . Jocelyn Vena of MTV News noted that Shakira was " dancing around being sexy " in the video . Olivia Smith from the Daily News described the dance choreography as " highly athletic " , but criticized the design of the hotel room where the video was filmed .

 = 1993 Grand National = 
 The 1993 Grand National ( officially the Martell Grand National Chase Handicap Grade 3 ) was scheduled on 3 April 1993 to be the 147th running of the Grand National horse race , held annually at Aintree Racecourse near Liverpool , England . 
 It was the first and so far only time that the steeplechase was declared void , after 30 of the 39 runners began and carried on racing despite there having been a false start . Seven of the field even went on to complete the course , with Esha Ness crossing the finishing post first , in what would have been the second @-@ fastest time ever . 
 The Jockey Club decided not to re @-@ run the race , and as a result it has often been called the race that never was . Bookmakers were forced to refund an estimated £ 75 million in bets staked . The Jockey Club launched an inquiry which led to a number of changes in the starting and recall procedures in future races . 
 = = Circumstances = = 
 = = = False start = = = 
 The meeting at Aintree had been beset by problems before the race . Fifteen animal rights protesters invaded the course near the first fence ( as had also happened at the 1991 Grand National ) resulting in a delayed start . A first false start was caused by several riders becoming tangled in the starting tape . Starter Keith Brown , who was officiating his last National before retirement , waved his red recall flag and a second official , Ken Evans , who was situated 100 yards further down the track , in turn signalled to the leading runners to turn around . At the second attempt , the tape became tangled again — around the neck of jockey Richard Dunwoody — and Brown called another false start . However , this time his recall flag did not unfurl as he waved it . As a result , 30 of the 39 riders set off around the track , oblivious to the recall . 
 = = = First circuit = = = 
 Officials , trainers and the crowd tried desperately to halt the race , but the majority of the field continued racing . By the Becher 's Brook ( the sixth fence ) only one of the 30 still competing had fallen : outsider Farm Week at the fourth , who hampered David 's <unk> in the process . 
 Royal Athlete had gained popularity with the public after finishing third in the Cheltenham Gold Cup and was sent to post at 17 / 2 , providing Ben de Haan , the 1983 winning jockey , with his 11th and final ride in the race . He fell at Valentine 's ( the ninth ) . 
 One fence later , outsider Senator <unk> fell . The BBC 's commentary team , consisting of Peter O <unk> , John Hanmer and Jim McGrath continued to describe proceedings , periodically reminding viewers that " it 's got to be a void race " . 
 It was not until the water jump — the final fence of the first circuit — that many riders became aware of the situation and pulled up , including champion jockey Peter Scudamore on Captain Dibble , Garrison Savannah , and Zeta 's Lad , who was widely considered by tipsters as the form horse in the field , having raced unbeaten in his five starts that season , including beating Romany King in the Racing Post Chase at Kempton two months prior . Most of the horses at the rear were pulled up too , including Stay On Tracks , David 's <unk> , Direct , Mister Ed and the tailed @-@ off Quirinus . 
 Captain Dibble was the Scottish Grand National winner in 1992 and vied for favouritism for the Grand National until a few days before the race . Scudamore had turned down a host of competitors to take the ride in his 13th National , and the pair were sent off at 9 / 1 . Scudamore saw trainer Martin Pipe waving at him near the water jump to stop . The jockey had never won the National in his previous 12 attempts , and retired from racing a short time later . 
 Party Politics , who won the 1992 Grand National with partner Carl Llewellyn , was also pulled up after the water jump when in a good position . Since his Aintree victory the previous April he had run <unk> in two chases without Llewellyn in the saddle before they were reunited to win the <unk> Gold Cup at Haydock in February . As defending champion , and with his jockey taking his fourth ride in a Grand National , the horse was popular with the public who had backed him down to 7 / 1 favourite at the start . 
 = = = Second circuit = = = 
 Fourteen horses continued racing onto the second circuit , led by Sure Metal and Howe Street who between them held a decent lead until they both fell at the 20th fence . 
 This put Romany King into the lead , which he held on to until being passed at the final fence and finishing third . The horse had been narrowly beaten by Party Politics in the previous year 's National but had won just one of his six races since , a moderate event at Exeter in November . He shared pre @-@ race favouritism with Party Politics until shortly before the start when he drifted to 15 / 2 joint @-@ second favourite . His Irish jockey , Adrian Maguire , was one of nine riders making their debut in the race . 
 One fence later , at the 21st , Joyful Noise refused , Paco 's Boy fell , as did the tailed @-@ off The <unk> . Interim Lib unseated his rider at the Canal Turn and a tailed @-@ off Bonanza Boy refused at the same fence . Seven runners remained and went on to complete the course : Romany King , The Committee , Esha Ness , Cahervillahow , <unk> A Buck , On The Other Hand and a distant Laura 's Beau . As they crossed the Melling Road before approaching the penultimate fence , commentator Peter O <unk> declared the unfolding events " the greatest disaster in the history of the Grand National . " 
 As they came to the elbow , on the 494 @-@ yard run @-@ in to home , Cahervillahow , Romany King , The Committee and Esha Ness remained tight and vying for position . But it was 50 / 1 shot Esha Ness , ridden by John White and trained by Jenny Pitman , who crossed the line first , in the second @-@ fastest time in Grand National history . Cahervillahow came home second despite trailing in fourth at the elbow , Romany King was third and The Committee fourth . <unk> A Buck completed in fifth , with On The Other Hand and Laura 's Beau completing the seven finishers of the National that never was . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 Initially there was confusion as to what would happen next . Keith Brown , the race starter , was interviewed briefly by the BBC and alluded to the possibility that the nine jockeys who noticed and obeyed his recall could be eligible to take part in a re @-@ run . Several jockeys said that they thought the officials attempting to stop them were actually protestors . Esha Ness 's jockey John White said of the latter stages of the race : " I could see there were only a few horses around , but I thought the others had fallen or something . " 
 Romany King 's jockey Adrian Maguire said : " Going to The Chair , I wondered what the hell was going on because I saw a fellow wandering nonchalantly across the fence . There were two cones in front of it , but the horses still in the race all kept going . " 
 The Jockey Club later declared the race void , ruled out any re @-@ running of it , and launched an inquiry . Bookmakers were forced to refund an estimated £ 75 million in bets staked . 
 Zeta 's Lad trainer John Upson was among those trainers who were particularly angry , feeling , correctly as it transpired , that this was his only chance to have a leading contender in a National . Before the race Upson had said : " I 'm not someone who always thinks their horse is going to win , but this year I just have a feeling . " The horse was in mid @-@ division taking the water jump but was instantly pulled up as jockey Robbie Supple , riding in his third National , realised the race was not on . Upson later revealed : " The reason I really blew my top was , that once the initial fiasco had happened , there was the starter standing there saying , ' Right , I 'm disqualifying everything , apart from the nine that didn 't go . I 'll start the race again with nine runners . ' At that stage I just thought the world had gone completely mad . The adrenalin was going and I was jumping up and down . " 
 = = Investigation = = 
 An inquiry was chaired by High Court judge Sir Michael Connell , the deputy senior steward of the Jockey Club since 1988 . His report apportioned some blame to Keith Brown for allowing the horses to get too close to the tape , but most blame to Ken Evans , the official further down the track , for failing to notice the second false start . Brown retired later that year and said : " It was very sad for all concerned . Whatever could go wrong that day did . " 
 A working group produced a 34 @-@ page report with recommendations following the official inquiry , which was approved by the Jockey Club . Considerable public discussion had arisen over the possibility of introducing electronic devices , such as horns or flashing lights , to provide a fail @-@ safe starting and recall system . The use of modern technology however was dismissed on the basis of a lack of total success overseas , and being open to sabotage and technical failure . 
 The tape at the start line was made more sturdy , consisting of three strands instead of one , and in a more distinctive pattern ; the width of the start was also reduced . If a false start is called , two officials ( in contact with the starter by radio ) will wave fluorescent yellow flags at jockeys . Further up the course , a third official will be positioned so as to arrest those who fail to notice the two initial flags . If necessary , the third official will follow the field in a car to stop them . 
 Andrew Parker Bowles , who chaired the working group which produced the recommendations , said he was confident that the exceptional circumstances of the 1993 National would never be repeated : " You start 7 @,@ 000 races a year with <unk> and it went wrong just three times last year , but one of them was the Grand National . It won 't happen again . "

 = Jagdgeschwader 1 ( World War II ) = 
 Jagdgeschwader 1 ( JG 1 ) was a German World War II fighter unit or " wing " which used the Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 190 aircraft , between 1940 – 1944 . The name of the unit derives from Jagd , meaning " hunt " and Geschwader , meaning " wing " . First formed in May 1939 in eastern Prussia , I. / JG 1 was one of the original groups created by the Luftwaffe as part of its expansion plans . 
 Between 1940 and 1942 , JG 1 operated primarily over the Western Front and northern occupied Europe . During the initial days of the war , JG 1 faced little resistance , apart from occasional Royal Air Force ( RAF ) excursions . The unit was rarely engaged in large @-@ scale confrontations during this time . From late 1942 onwards it was tasked with defence of the Reich . After D @-@ Day , elements of JG 1 were moved to France and were tasked with air support to the Wehrmacht Heer , along with their air defence role . Operation Bodenplatte severely reduced the strength of JG 1 . 
 Towards the end of the war , the unit was disbanded and its remaining pilots and aircraft were re @-@ organized . What remained of these groups surrendered to Allied forces at the end of the war . 
 JG 1 was the first unit to attempt ' aerial bombing ' techniques against the United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) heavy bomber formations . It was the only unit to be equipped with the Heinkel He 162 jet fighter . 
 In 1944 the " Oesau " suffix was added to the unit 's title , after its late Geschwaderkommodore Oberst Walter Oesau ( 127 kills ) , who was killed in action . 
 Some 700 enemy aircraft were claimed shot down during the war by the unit . 
 = = Formation history = = 
 In 1938 the Luftwaffe envisaged a five @-@ year expansion plan that utilized the single @-@ engined Messerschmitt Bf 109s for short @-@ range domestic defence duties and the twin @-@ engined Messerschmitt Bf 110 for external long @-@ range offensive roles . In the summer of 1939 , Luftwaffe replaced its long @-@ term expansionist plans for fast mobilization with creation of five new Geschwader starting in July 1939 . Even those plans failed to materialize and several groups ( Gruppen ) were created from existing groups . One such group , I. / Jagdgeschwader 131 ( JG 131 ) , was thus created from II . / Jagdgeschwader 132 " Richthofen " ( JG 132 ) . The new group , I. / JG 131 , was commanded by Major Bernhard Woldenga , and was based in Jesau , East Prussia ( modern <unk> in Russia ) . The unit was re @-@ equipped with the Bf 109E by June 1939 . 
 In May 1939 , the entire organization of the Luftwaffe was changed . As a result , a large number of units were re @-@ designated and many command title changes took place . I. / JG 131 was given the designation I. / JG 1 . The high @-@ profile and most senior home front wing , JG 2 " Richthofen " had coveted that designation , but was left in " second place " . However , on 7 May , just before the invasion of France and the Low Countries , I. / JG 1 was merged with Jagdgeschwader 27 and re @-@ designated as III . / Jagdgeschwader 27 ( JG 27 ) . This temporarily dissolved JG 1 as a unit . Seven months later , on 7 December 1940 a new unit I. / JG 1 was formed at Jever out of several defensive units based on the North Sea coast . 
 JG 1 's role was to provide air cover over a large portion of the North Sea coastline . Its commander was Oberstleutnant Carl @-@ August Schumacher . Their operational area stretched from the Netherlands to Southern Norway . On 5 January 1942 , Schumacher handed over command to Major Erich von Selle to become commander of the fighter forces for Luftflotte 5 ( Jagdfliegerführer Norwegen ) . 
 = = = Reorganization = = = 
 Similar to its parent Jagdgeschwader 2 , Jagdgeschwader 1 was designated to be a " donor " unit in forming a new unit called Jagdgeschwader 11 ( JG 11 ) on 31 March 1943 . I and II Gruppen JG 1 were transferred to JG 11 . IV Gruppe was re @-@ designated as I. / JG 1 . A new III Gruppe was formed in Leeuwarden , Netherlands , commanded by Major Karl @-@ Heinz Leesmann 
 The new Jagdgeschwader 1 was moved to Deelen to protect occupied Dutch territory , and Jagdgeschwader 11 tasked with protecting the North German border between Netherlands and Denmark . Erich Mix was replaced by Major Hans Philipp as Geschwaderkommodore . By mid 1943 , JG 1 came under the control of <unk> Mitte , which went on to form Luftflotte Reich . 
 = = Organization structure = = 
 Generally , the organization of JG 1 followed the standard Luftwaffe organization for any typical wing ( Geschwader ) . It was commanded by a Geschwaderkommodore , equivalent to a USAAF Wing Commander or RAF Group Captain . A Geschwaderkommodore was supposed to have the rank of Lieutenant Colonel ( Oberstleutnant ) or Colonel ( Oberst ) , but the position could be filled by a relatively junior officer . 
 Initially most Luftwaffe fighter wings consisted of three groups ( Gruppe ) , which were the equivalent of USAAF groups or RAF Wings . Groups were identified using Roman numerals , followed by the unit number ; e.g. I. / JG 1 . In 1942 JG 1 was the first unit to be expanded to incorporate a fourth group . Partly as a result of JG 1 's expansion , other Luftwaffe fighter wings incorporated a fourth group from mid @-@ 1943 . 
 Each group usually consisted of three to four squadrons ( Staffeln ) , which were identified using numbers ; e.g. 3 . / JG 1 . Each squadron also had a subordinate headquarters flight ( Stabschwarm ) associated with it . A squadron with an establishment of 12 – 16 aircraft usually consisted of three to four flights ( Schwärme ) of four aircraft usually flying in the " finger @-@ four " formation . The commanding officer of a squadron ( Staffelkapitän ) usually held a rank of Senior Lieutenant ( Oberleutnant ) or Captain ( Hauptmann ) . The flights of a squadron were color @-@ coded " Red " , " Blue " , " Yellow " and " Green " . 
 = = = Headquarters Flight JG 1 = = = 
 A Geschwaderstab was essentially a Headquarters Unit ( Stabschwarm ) for the entire wing . There were headquarters units also at <unk> level . Initially when JG 1 was re @-@ formed in Jever , it was constituted as a Regional Fighter Command ( Jagdfliegerführer 2 ) on 30 November 1939 with an intention to co @-@ ordinate with Navy ( Kriegsmarine ) flak and signals units . This autonomous command defending the coastline was placed under Oberstleutnant Carl @-@ August Schumacher . Geschwaderstab JG 1 ( Stab . JG 1 ) was also alternatively called JG Nord or JG Schumacher and was equipped with Bf 109 ' D ' and ' E ' variants . 
 = = = Group I. / JG 1 = = = 
 I. / JG 1 consisted of one Headquarters Flight ( Gruppenstab ) and 1 . , 2 @.@ and 3 <unk> . When the Battle of France commenced on 10 May 1940 , I. / JG 1 was put under the administrative control of JG 27 . After seeing extensive service , the group was re @-@ designated III . / JG 27 on 5 July 1940 . 
 1 . / JG 1 was reformed on 7 December 1940 in Vlissingen from the " Holland " Squadron ( Jasta Holland ) . 2 . / JG 1 was formed on 5 July 1941 in Katwijk , Netherlands , from the Münster @-@ <unk> Squadron ( Jasta Münster @-@ <unk> ) of Luftflotte 2 while 3 . / JG 1 was formed on 1 March 1941 in De <unk> from parts of the Training / Supplement squadron of JG 52 ( Ergänzungsstaffel Gruppe / JG 52 ) . These three units operated independently until September 1941 when they were grouped into I. / JG 1 under Major Erich Mix . 
 3 . / JG 1 was ordered to Sicily and later Africa , and re @-@ designated as 6 . / JG 51 on 30 November 1941 . Another 3 . / JG 1 was formed in Wangerooge on the same day . In January 1944 , the 18 Staffel unit was transferred to Dortmund where they were located next to I. / JG 1 . Here they were subordinated to Major Rudolf @-@ Emil Schnoor , the commander of I. / JG 1 . On 15 August 1944 , 9 . / JG 77 was transferred to reinforce I. / JG 1 , becoming 4 . / JG 1 . 
 = = = Group II . / JG 1 = = = 
 In September 1941 , Hauptmann Hans von Hahn 's I. / Jagdgeschwader 3 ( JG 3 ) was transferred from the Eastern Front to Germany for rest and re @-@ supply . In November 1941 , it was transferred to the northern Netherlands and on 15 January 1942 re @-@ designated II . / JG 1 in Katwijk . The group had been involved in the Battle of France and the Eastern Front campaigns as I. / JG 3 , and had 421 kills to its name by September 1941 . While at Katwijk and Vlissingen , they were assigned the task of coastal defence and protection of shipping routes . 
 In early 1944 , the <unk> ( Reich Air Ministry — RLM ) reinforced the day @-@ fighters of " Defence of Reich " with additional units from the Eastern Front . On 15 August 1944 , II . / JG 1 was increased to four <unk> with the addition of 7 . / JG 51 equipped with the Bf 109G @-@ 6 " Gustav " from its base at Brest @-@ Litovsk . On arrival in May 1944 at Störmede , they were re @-@ equipped with the Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 190 and re @-@ designated 8 . / JG 1 on 15 August 1944 . 4 . / JG 1 was re @-@ designated to 7 . / JG 1 . From this point until the end in 1945 , II . / JG 1 would consist of its Headquarters Flight , Stab II . / JG 1 , as well as 5 . , 6 . , 7 @.@ and 8 . / JG 1 . 
 = = = Group III . / JG 1 = = = 
 By January 1942 , most fighting wings ( Jagdgeschwader ) of the Luftwaffe had created their own Training Group ( <unk> ) , with which to prepare trainees for operational service with their parent wing . Each training group had its own operating squadron ( <unk> ) that doubled as a supplemental squadron , consisting of instructors and trainees . It was from such <unk> that III . / JG 1 was formed . 
 III . / JG 1 was formed in January 1942 in <unk> . 7 . / JG 1 consisted of supplemental flights ( Einsatz @-@ Schwärme ) of fighter pilot schools ( Jagdfliegerschule or <unk> ) Gleiwitz , Breslau and Königsberg . III . / JG 1 was re @-@ designated I. / JG 11 on 1 April 1943 and a new III . / JG established on 23 May in Leeuwarden led by Major Karl @-@ Heinz Leesmann .
