 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 The signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases . The first phase begins within hours of overdose , and consists of nausea , vomiting , pallor , and sweating . However , patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning . Rarely , after massive overdoses , patients may develop symptoms of metabolic acidosis and coma early in the course of poisoning . 
 The second phase occurs between 24 and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage . In general , damage occurs in hepatocytes as they metabolize the paracetamol . The individual may experience right upper quadrant pain . The increasing liver damage also alters biochemical markers of liver function ; International normalized ratio ( INR ) and the hepatic transaminases ALT and AST rise to abnormal levels . Acute kidney failure may also occur during this phase , typically caused by either hepatorenal syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome . In some cases , acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity . In these cases , it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver . 
 The third phase follows at 3 to 5 days , and is marked by complications of massive hepatic necrosis leading to fulminant hepatic failure with complications of coagulation defects , hypoglycemia , kidney failure , hepatic encephalopathy , cerebral edema , sepsis , multiple organ failure , and death . If the third phase is survived , the hepatic necrosis runs its course , and liver and kidney function typically return to normal in a few weeks . The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received . 
 = = Cause = = 
 The toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable . In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 3 grams . Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity . In adults , single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg / kg of bodyweight , whichever is lower , have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity . Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels . Following a normal dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks , patients can expect an increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the normal value . It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure . Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days . In adults , a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity , while in children acute doses above 200 mg / kg could potentially cause toxicity . Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death , and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment , with chronic larger @-@ than @-@ normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children . Intravenous doses should be smaller than those taken orally , all other things being equal . 
 In rare individuals , paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use . This may be due to individual ( " idiosyncratic " ) differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the metabolic pathways that handle paracetamol ( see paracetamol 's metabolism ) . 
 = = = Risk factors = = = 
 A number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity . Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce <unk> , thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol . In one study of patients with liver injury , 64 % reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day , while 35 % took 60 grams a day or less . Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists . For chronic alcohol users , acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect . For non @-@ chronic alcohol users , acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect . 
 Fasting is a risk factor , possibly because of depletion of hepatic glutathione reserves . The concomitant use of the <unk> inhibitor isoniazid increases the risk of hepatotoxicity , though whether <unk> induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear . Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes , such as antiepileptics including carbamazepine , phenytoin , and barbiturates , have also been reported as risk factors . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 When taken in normal therapeutic doses , paracetamol has been shown to be safe . Following a therapeutic dose , it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via Phase II metabolism by conjugation with sulfate and glucuronide , with a small portion being oxidized via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system . <unk> P450 <unk> and 3A4 convert approximately 5 % of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite , N @-@ acetyl @-@ p @-@ <unk> ( NAPQI ) . Under normal conditions , NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with glutathione to form cysteine and <unk> acid conjugates . 
 In cases of paracetamol overdose , the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated , and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI . As a result , hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted , as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration . NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with cellular membrane molecules , resulting in widespread <unk> damage and death , leading to acute hepatic necrosis . In animal studies , hepatic glutathione must be depleted to less than 70 % of normal levels before hepatotoxicity occurs . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 A person 's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis . The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level . A drug nomogram developed in 1975 , called the <unk> @-@ Matthew nomogram , estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion . To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity , the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram . Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury . A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract . Therefore , a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended . 
 Clinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days , although , in severe cases , it may be evident in 12 hours . Right @-@ upper @-@ quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis . Laboratory studies may show evidence of hepatic necrosis with elevated AST , ALT , bilirubin , and prolonged coagulation times , particularly an elevated prothrombin time . After paracetamol overdose , when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU / L , paracetamol @-@ induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed . In some cases , the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10 @,@ 000 IU / L. 
 = = = Detection in body fluids = = = 
 Paracetamol may be quantified in blood , plasma , or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths . The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg / l , which equals 200 µmol / L. Levels of 30 – 300 mg / L ( 200 @-@ 2000 µmol / L ) are often observed in overdose patients . Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 – 400 mg / L in persons dying due to acute overdosage . Automated colorimetric techniques , gas chromatography and liquid chromatography are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 = = = Combination with other agents = = = 
 One strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre @-@ combined in tablets either with an emetic or an antidote . 
 <unk> was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg methionine , an amino acid formerly used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose . 
 There have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote , acetylcysteine . 
 <unk> , the active metabolite of vitamin D3 , appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production . <unk> was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42 % , increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol / mg to 41 nmol / mg , 24 and 48 hours after administration ; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration . It has been proposed that co @-@ administration of calcitriol , via injection , may improve treatment outcomes . 
 = = = Limitation of availability = = = 
 Limiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries . In the UK , sales of over @-@ the @-@ counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 x 500 mg tablets in pharmacies , and 16 x 500 mg tablets in non @-@ pharmacy outlets . Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist 's discretion . In Ireland , the limits are 24 and 12 tablets , respectively . Subsequent study suggests that these interventions have had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose . 
 One suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription @-@ only medicine , or to remove it entirely from the market . However , overdose is a relatively minor problem ; for example , only 0 @.@ 08 % of the UK population present with paracetamol overdose each year . In contrast , paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people . In addition , alternative pain relief medications such as aspirin are more toxic in overdose , whereas non @-@ steroidal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs are associated with more adverse effects following normal use . 
 = = = <unk> replacements = = = 
 Paracetamol ester prodrug with L @-@ <unk> acid ( PCA ) , a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione , has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve bioavailability . The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L @-@ 5 @-@ oxo @-@ <unk> @-@ 2 @-@ paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice . The glutathione hepatic values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are <unk> with the GSH levels recorded in no @-@ treated mice control group . The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a <unk> decrease of <unk> of 35 % ( p < 0 @.@ 01 vs untreated control group ) . The oral LD50 was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg @-@ 1 , whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg @-@ 1 . These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol . 
 = = = Other = = = 
 Reducing publicity about paracetamol and the inclusion of warnings on packs of paracetamol have also been suggested as strategies to reduce overdose . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 = = = Gastric decontamination = = = 
 In adults , the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination . Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances , so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe . Gastric lavage , better known as stomach pumping , may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life @-@ threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion . Activated charcoal is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it adsorbs paracetamol , reducing its gastrointestinal absorption . Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of aspiration than gastric lavage . 
 It appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion . Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have delayed gastric emptying due to co @-@ ingested drugs or following ingestion of <unk> or delayed @-@ release paracetamol preparations . Activated charcoal should also be administered if co @-@ ingested drugs warrant decontamination . There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose , because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine . Studies have shown that 39 % less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together . There are conflicting recommendations regarding whether to change the dosing of oral acetylcysteine after the administration of activated charcoal , and even whether the dosing of acetylcysteine needs to be altered at all . Intravenous <unk> has no interaction with activated charcoal . 
 Inducing vomiting with syrup of ipecac has no role in paracetamol overdose because the vomiting it induces delays the effective administration of activated charcoal and oral acetylcysteine . Liver injury is extremely rare after acute accidental ingestion in children under 6 years of age . Children with accidental exposures do not require gastrointestinal decontamination with either gastric lavage , activated charcoal , or syrup of ipecac . 
 = = = Acetylcysteine = = = 
 Acetylcysteine , also called N @-@ acetylcysteine or NAC , works to reduce paracetamol toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione . Glutathione react with the toxic NAPQI metabolite so that it does not damage cells and can be safely excreted . NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram ( one for patients with risk factors , and one for those without ) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice . <unk> and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity , although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine . Additionally , acetylcysteine has been shown to be a more effective antidote , particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post @-@ ingestion . 
 If the patient presents less than eight hours after paracetamol overdose , then acetylcysteine significantly reduces the risk of serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival . If acetylcysteine is started more than 8 hours after ingestion , there is a sharp decline in its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun , and the risk of acute hepatic necrosis and death increases dramatically . Although acetylcysteine is most effective if given early , it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48 hours after ingestion . In clinical practice , if the patient presents more than eight hours after the paracetamol overdose , then activated charcoal is not useful , and acetylcysteine is started immediately . In earlier presentations , charcoal can be given when the patient arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for the paracetamol level results to return from the laboratory . 
 In United States practice , intravenous ( IV ) and oral administration are considered to be equally effective and safe if given within 8 hours of ingestion . However , IV is the only recommended route in Australasian and British practice . Oral acetylcysteine is given as a 140 mg / kg loading dose followed by 70 mg / kg every four hours for 17 more doses , and if the patient vomits within 1 hour of dose , the dose must be repeated . Oral acetylcysteine may be poorly tolerated due to its unpleasant taste , odor , and its tendency to cause nausea and vomiting . If repeated doses of charcoal are indicated because of another ingested drug , then subsequent doses of charcoal and acetylcysteine should be staggered . 
 Intravenous acetylcysteine is given as a continuous infusion over 20 hours for a total dose 300 mg / kg . Recommended administration involves infusion of a 150 mg / kg loading dose over 15 to 60 minutes , followed by a 50 mg / kg infusion over four hours ; the last 100 mg / kg are infused over the remaining 16 hours of the protocol . Intravenous acetylcysteine has the advantage of shortening hospital stay , increasing both doctor and patient convenience , and allowing administration of activated charcoal to reduce absorption of both the paracetamol and any co @-@ ingested drugs without concerns about interference with oral acetylcysteine . Intravenous dosing varies with weight , specifically in children . For patients less than 20 kg , the loading dose is 150 mg / kg in 3 mL / kg diluent , administered over 60 minutes ; the second dose is 50 mg / kg in 7 mL / kg diluent over 4 hours ; and the third and final dose is 100 mg / kg in 14 mL / kg diluent over 16 hours . 
 The most common adverse effect to acetylcysteine treatment is an anaphylactoid reaction , usually manifested by rash , wheeze , or mild hypotension . Adverse reactions are more common in people treated with IV acetylcysteine , occurring in 4 to 23 % of patients . Rarely , severe life @-@ threatening reactions may occur in predisposed individuals , such as patients with asthma . If an anaphylactoid reaction occurs the acetylcysteine is temporarily halted or slowed and antihistamines and other supportive care is administered . 
 = = = Liver transplant = = = 
 In patients who develop fulminant hepatic failure or who are otherwise expected to die from liver failure , the mainstay of management is liver transplantation . Liver transplants are performed in specialist centers . The most commonly used criteria for liver transplant was developed by physicians at King 's College Hospital in London . Patients are recommended for transplant if they have an arterial blood pH less than 7 @.@ 3 after fluid resuscitation or if a patient has Grade III or IV encephalopathy , a prothrombin time greater than 100 seconds , and a serum creatinine greater than 300 mmol / L In a 24 @-@ hour period . Other forms of liver support have been used including partial liver transplants . These techniques have the advantage of supporting the patient while their own liver regenerates . Once liver function returns immunosuppressive drugs are commenced and they have to take immunosuppressive medication for the rest of their lives . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 The mortality rate from paracetamol overdose increases two days after the ingestion , reaches a maximum on day four , and then gradually decreases . <unk> is the most important single indicator of probable mortality and the need for transplantation . A mortality rate of 95 % without transplant was reported in patients who had a documented pH less than 7 @.@ 30 . Other indicators of poor prognosis include renal insufficiency , grade 3 or worse hepatic encephalopathy , a markedly elevated prothrombin time , or an elevated blood lactic acid level . One study has shown that a factor V level less than 10 % of normal indicated a poor prognosis ( 91 % mortality ) , whereas a ratio of factor VIII to factor V of less than 30 indicated a good prognosis ( 100 % survival ) . Patients with a poor prognosis are usually identified for likely liver transplantation . Patients that do not die are expected to fully recover and have a normal life expectancy and quality of life . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 Paracetamol is contained in many preparations , available as both over @-@ the @-@ counter and as prescription @-@ only medications . Because of its wide availability paired with comparably high toxicity , ( compared to ibuprofen and aspirin ) there is a much higher potential for overdose . Paracetamol toxicity is one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide . In the United States , the United Kingdom , Australia , and New Zealand , paracetamol is the most common cause of drug overdoses . Additionally , in both the United States and the United Kingdom it is the most common cause of acute liver failure . 
 In England and Wales an estimated 41 @,@ 200 cases of paracetamol poisoning occurred in 1989 to 1990 , with a mortality of 0 @.@ 40 % . It is estimated that 150 to 200 deaths and 15 to 20 liver transplants occur as a result of poisoning each year in England and Wales . Paracetamol overdose results in more calls to poison control centers in the US than overdose of any other pharmacological substance , accounting for more than 100 @,@ 000 calls , as well as 56 @,@ 000 emergency room visits , 2 @,@ 600 hospitalizations , and 458 deaths due to acute liver failure per year . A study of cases of acute liver failure between November 2000 and October 2004 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA found that paracetamol was the cause of 41 % of all cases in adults , and 25 % of cases in children . 
 = Tropical Storm Odette ( 2003 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Odette was a rare off @-@ season tropical storm that affected the Caribbean Sea in December 2003 . The 15th tropical storm of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season , Odette formed near the coast of Panama a few days after the official end of the Atlantic hurricane season , and ultimately made landfall on the Dominican Republic as a moderate tropical storm . 
 The storm caused heavy damage throughout the Dominican Republic from unusually heavy rainfall in December . Preparation preceding Odette 's landfall resulted in only eight deaths and 14 injuries . Total damage is unknown , though crop damage in the Dominican Republic totaled to over $ 8 million ( 2003 USD , $ 10 @.@ 3 million 2015 USD ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 By November 30 , the last day of the Atlantic hurricane season , a stationary front extended across eastern Cuba into the southwestern Caribbean Sea . On December 1 , a low pressure area developed within the frontal zone just north of Panama , and an anticyclone aloft produced good outflow over the low @-@ level center . The low remained nearly stationary for the next several days , and it gradually became separated from the stationary front . Convection increased across the area due to moisture from the eastern Pacific Ocean and moderate divergence . Increased wind shear deteriorated the system on December 2 , though convection redeveloped as the system started a northeast drift . On December 3 a mid @-@ level circulation developed about 140 miles ( 225 km ) north of the surface center . Convection increased and became better organized as a weak tropical wave reached the area , and it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Twenty at around 1200 UTC on December 4 while located about 345 miles ( 560 km ) south of Kingston , Jamaica ; initially , the depression was forecast to track north @-@ northeastward and pass over western Haiti . 
 Upon being classified as a tropical cyclone , the depression was embedded within the southwesterly flow between a ridge over the eastern Caribbean Sea and a mid @-@ latitude trough , which caused a steady east @-@ northeast motion . The convection organized into a central dense overcast with a well @-@ defined cloud band wrapping partially around the center , and based on satellite imagery estimates the depression was upgraded to tropical storm status ; late on December 4 , the National Hurricane Center named the storm Odette . After being named , the storm intensified despite moderate southwesterly wind shear , and an eye feature became evident on microwave satellite imagery . Additionally , about three – fourths of a mid @-@ level eyewall developed . The storm was assessed with winds of 40 – 50 mph ( 65 – 85 km / h ) , though the National Hurricane Center remarked the winds could have been stronger due to lack of structural data . The eye feature diminished as the convective structure deteriorated slightly , and Hurricane Hunters first flew into the storm at around 1200 UTC on December 5 . Odette tracked over an area of warm sea surface temperatures , and the overall cloud pattern gradually improved ; the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory predicted the storm to attain hurricane status . Early on December 6 , a TRMM overpass showed an 80 % closed eyewall , and at 0600 UTC Odette attained peak winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) while located about 245 miles ( 395 km / h ) southwest of Santo Domingo , Dominican Republic . 
 Upon reaching peak intensity , Odette had begun accelerating northeastward , which decreased wind shear and slightly increased its southwesterly outflow . The low @-@ level center decelerated as it approached Hispaniola , though the convection continued quickly northeastward . Failing to maintain vertical organization , Odette weakened slightly and made landfall on <unk> National Park , in the Pedernales Province of the Dominican Republic , around 2300 UTC on December 6 with winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . The circulation became disrupted as it crossed the country , and on December 7 it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) . It accelerated to the northeast ahead of an approaching cold front , and late on December 7 Odette transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its center became embedded within the front . The remnants continued quickly northeastward before losing its identity within the frontal zone on December 9 ; the frontal zone that absorbed Odette also absorbed Tropical Storm Peter a few days later . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Prior to Odette 's predicted arrival , the Dominican Republic government issued for the evacuation of more than 10 @,@ 000 people , mostly from those living near rivers . At least 2 @,@ 000 shelters were set up , capable of housing up to 800 @,@ 000 people . In addition , the government mobilized the army to force those unwilling to leave from their homes . Such precautions were taken due to already saturated grounds from heavy rainfall three weeks prior . 
 A tropical storm watch was issued between Santo Domingo and the Dominican Republic / Haiti border on December 4 , 56 hours prior to landfall . This was raised to a tropical storm warning on December 5 while 32 hours before landfall . In addition , tropical storm warnings were issued for all of the Haitian coastline and Jamaica . 
 = = Impact = = 
 While over the southwestern Caribbean Sea , Odette dropped heavy rainfall , including prior to its formation . For several days , the storm caused rains in Panama , Costa Rica , and the east coast of Nicaragua . In Colombia , the storm caused rainfall totals of up to 8 inches ( 200 mm ) in Puerto Colombia . In Jamaica , the storm dropped moderate rainfall , flooding several roads in Saint Ann and Saint Mary Parishes . Odette caused moderate damage and 8 deaths in the Dominican Republic . 
 = = = Dominican Republic = = = 
 Winds from Tropical Storm Odette were relatively light across the Dominican Republic , with a peak gust of 60 mph occurring in Santo Domingo . The storm dropped heavy rainfall for several hours , amounting to a maximum of 9 @.@ 07 inches ( 230 mm ) in Isla Saona . Several other locations reported over 4 inches as well . The rainfall caused mudslides and flash flooding , forcing several rivers to overflow in combination with previous rains . In addition , a tornado was reported near Santo Domingo , destroying one house and <unk> several others . 
 The flooding and mudslides damaged up to 60 @,@ 000 homes and destroyed 34 . Gusty winds caused power outages . River flooding caused two bridges to collapse , isolating several communities . Landslides buried several roads , though authorities quickly repaired them . The rainfall also flooded fields , resulting in severe crop damage . As much as 85 % of the banana crop was lost , while the coffee crop suffered losses shortly before harvest season . Crop damage totaled to around $ 8 million ( 2003 USD ) . In addition , excess flooding contaminated water supplies , leaving several areas without clean water or sanitation . 
 In all , Tropical Storm Odette caused 8 deaths and 14 injuries , mostly due to flash flooding and mudslides . In addition , two indirect deaths are associated with the storm due to heart attacks . Neighboring Haiti experienced little from the storm .

 Though Odette passed 280 miles to the west of Mayagüez , Puerto Rico , the storm caused moderate rainfall across Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands .

The storm also caused up to 2 @.@ 2 in ( 55 @.@ 9 mm ) of rainfall in Christiansted on Saint Croix . 
 Odette 's rainfall caused flooding throughout the island 's rivers . The river flooding destroyed three bridges , resulting in $ 20 @,@ 000 in damages ( 2003 USD ) . The flooding also caused a mudslide near a cemetery in Humacao . The rainfall also covered numerous roads , though overall damage was minimal throughout Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands .

 In all , 65 @,@ 000 people were affected by Tropical Storm Odette . The Dominican Republic Red Cross and Red Crescent deployed 105 volunteers to the impacted areas , primarily in the area of Monte Cristi . The organization provided food and hygiene kits to thousands of people , as well as mosquito nets . The Red Cross also gave a 5 @,@ 000 liter water tank for the citizens in Monte Cristi , an area without clean water or sanitation . 
 When Odette formed on December 4 , it became the first tropical storm since the beginning of the modern tropical cyclone record to form in the Caribbean Sea in the month of December ; a documented December Caribbean hurricane occurred in 1822 . However , Tropical Storm Karen , which formed in November 1989 , persisted until December while located in the northwestern Caribbean Sea . In addition , Odette was the first Atlantic storm to form in the month of December since Hurricane Lili in 1984 . 
 The 2003 season was the first season since 1953 to have a pre @-@ season storm and a post @-@ season storm , with Ana in April and Odette . 
 = Svalbard Airport , Longyear = 
 Svalbard Airport , Longyear ( IATA : LYR , ICAO : <unk> ; Norwegian : Svalbard lufthavn , Longyear ) is the main airport serving Svalbard in Norway . It is located 1 @.@ 6 nautical miles ( 3 km ) northwest of Longyearbyen , and it is the northernmost airport in the world with public scheduled flights . The first airport near Longyearbyen was constructed during World War II . In 1959 , it was first taken into use for occasional flights , but could only be used a few months a year . Construction of the new airport at Hotellneset started in 1973 , and the airport was opened on 2 September 1975 . It is owned and operated by state @-@ owned Avinor . 
 In 2014 , the airport had 154 @,@ 261 passengers . Scandinavian Airlines operates daily flights to Tromsø and Oslo in mainland Norway . Lufttransport provides services to the two other airports on Svalbard : Ny @-@ Ålesund and Svea , using Dornier Do 228 turboprop aircraft . There are also regular charter flights . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Adventdalen = = = 
 The first air strip on Svalbard was constructed in Adventdalen , near Longyearbyen , by the Luftwaffe during World War II . This was not used after the war ; during the summer the archipelago was served by ships , but was completely isolated from November to May . In the early 1950s , the Norwegian Air Force started postal flights using a Catalina aircraft that departed from Tromsø and dropped postal parcels at Bear Island and at Longyearbyen . However , these aircraft never landed until 9 February 1959 , when a resident had become seriously ill , and needed to be flown to mainland Norway for treatment . The mining company Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani cleared the runway at <unk> and the 14 @-@ hour flight and landing was successful . A second landing , this time for delivery of post , was made on 11 March . 
 While the Catalina was suitable for postal flights , it was not suitable for a permanent solution for transporting passengers and freight , mainly due to its small size . Store Norske contacted the domestic airline Braathens SAFE for a regular service . The first trial flight was made on 2 April 1959 with a Douglas DC @-@ 4 with 54 passengers from Bardufoss Airport . Store Norske cleared a 1 @,@ 800 by 40 metres ( 5 @,@ 910 by 130 ft ) runway for the aircraft . The next flight was done in 1962 , followed by one in 1963 and two in 1964 . Due to lack of runway lights , flights could only be done during daylight , thus hindering flights during parts of December and January , when the sun never rises . By April , the runway could melt , and no flights could be done during summer . Navigation was conducted using radio signals from Bear Island and Isfjord . 
 The first night landing was made on 8 December 1965 . The DC @-@ 4 took off from the new Tromsø Airport and dropped mail at Bear Island before continuing to Longyearbyen . The runway was lit up using paraffin lamps and lights from cars parked along the runway . A radio transmitter was also installed at Hotellneset . During the 1965 – 66 season , Braathens SAFE made 16 flights to Svalbard . The following two seasons , the contract was awarded to Scandinavian Airlines System ( SAS ) , but after that they reverted to Braathens SAFE . Fred . Olsen Airtransport made its first flight to Svalbard in 1966 . By 1969 , a total of 50 flights had been made to Svalbard , and by 1972 , the 100th was made . By then , Braathens SAFE had started using Douglas DC @-@ 6B aircraft . During these years , Store Norske also installed permanent lights . The first jet plane , to land in Adventdalen was a Fred Olsen <unk> Dassault Falcon 20 , LN @-@ <unk> . The landing was in 1971 , and the aircraft brought in 1700 lbs of mail and passengers , picking up a geological survey party . A Fokker F @-@ 28 , landed on 29 April 1972 . From 1974 , Boeing 737 @-@ <unk> aircraft were taken into use . It had a side cargo door , allowing easy loading of cargo into the main cabin . Braathens SAFE built a small depot with spare parts and up to 90 @,@ 000 litres ( 20 @,@ 000 imp gal ; 24 @,@ 000 US gal ) fuel . Aeroflot started flights to Adventdalen in 1973 to serve the neighboring Russian community of Barentsburg . 
 = = = Hotellneset = = = 
 The Svalbard Treaty specifies that no military installations are permitted on the archipelago . The Soviet authorities were concerned that a permanent civilian airport could also be used by Norwegian and NATO forces . But the Soviets also needed an airport to serve their settlements at Barentsburg and Pyramiden , and by the early 1970s , an understanding was reached between the two countries . 
 Construction started in 1973 . The airport needed to be built on permafrost . The runway is insulated against the ground , so it will not melt during the summer . The hangar is frozen into the ground , with the pillars being melted into place and then being frozen stuck . The runway was plagued with frost heave due to an incorrect construction method , forcing the airport to regularly re @-@ asphalt the runway . In 1989 , parts of the runway were re @-@ insulated , giving these areas that previously had been the worst an acceptable solution . In 2006 , this measure was conducted on the remaining parts of the runway . An upgrade to the terminal building to allow larger capacity was completed in 2007 .

 Both Braathens SAFE and SAS applied for the concession to fly from the mainland to Norway . This was granted to SAS , who would have one weekly service . From the airport was taken into use until the official opening , Braathens SAFE continued to fly charter flights for Store Norske . The first landing at the new airport was made on 14 September 1974 with a Fokker F @-@ 28 , and Braathens SAFE continued to fly until 1 September 1975 . Russian authorities granted a concession for a semi @-@ weekly service by Aeroflot from Murmansk Airport . The first attempt to officially open the airport was made with a SAS Douglas DC @-@ 9 on 14 August 1975 . Among the guests on board was King Olav V , but thick fog at Longyearbyen forced the airplane to return . On 1 September , a Fokker F @-@ 27 from Braathens SAFE was used to calibrate the runways ; on board were pilots from SAS and Aeroflot to learn about the landing conditions . The following day , the second attempt to open the airport was successful . In addition to the scheduled services , Store Norske chartered cargo flights from Fred Olsen Air Transport . 
 Lufttransport has been at the airport since 1976 . In 1984 , two Bell 212 helicopters were stationed at the airport on contract with the Governor of Svalbard . The company signed an agreement with the Norwegian Coast Guard to have a <unk> Spartacus planes stationed at Longyearbyen for fishery surveillance . Since 1994 , the company has had a Dornier Do 228 stationed at the airport , and two since 2001 . 
 On 14 August 1987 , Braathens SAFE re @-@ entered the market , flying in parallel with SAS to Tromsø and Oslo . For the first time , the scheduled flights to Oslo were offered as day flights instead of the night flights offered by SAS . In 2002 , after SAS bought Braathens , the subsidiary took over all flights to Longyearbyen for the group . From May 2004 , they merged to SAS Braathens , that again became SAS from 1 June 2007 . From 1 April to 1 November 2004 , Norwegian Air Shuttle introduced three weekly services to Longyearbyen to Tromsø and Oslo , using Boeing 737 @-@ 300 aircraft , but the service was terminated due to low loads . A new service was started on 27 March 2008 , with two direct services to Oslo , using larger Boeing 737 @-@ 800 <unk> but again the route was terminated later the same year . As of 2014 , Norwegian is again flying to Svalbard from Oslo . Finnair announced to begin flights from Helsinki in summer 2016 , but Norwegian authorities did not allow this route as it was not in bilateral agreement on air traffic between Finland and Norway .

 The airport is located 1 @.@ 6 nautical miles ( 3 @.@ 0 km ; 1 @.@ 8 mi ) northwest of Longyearbyen , the largest settlement on Svalbard . The airport also serves the nearby Russian settlement of Barentsburg . The mainland Norway is part of the Schengen Area , but Svalbard is excluded , so from 2011 there is passport control at the airport . A passport , a national ID card indicating nationality , or a Norwegian ID card is needed . 
 There are 200 free outdoor parking spaces at the airport . There are taxis , rental cars and airport coaches available at the airport ( a shuttle bus operates to hotels and guesthouses in Longyearbyen and Nybyen ) . Scandinavian Airlines provides handling services through SAS Ground Services . 
 The runway is 2 @,@ 483 metres ( 8 @,@ 146 ft ) long and aligned 10 / 28 ( roughly east – west ) , equipped with instrument landing system , but there are no taxiways . The 45 metres ( 148 ft ) wide runway has two culverts that allow water from the mountain Platåberget to drain under it . About one third of the runway is dug into the terrain , while about two @-@ thirds is built on an embankment . A layer of frost @-@ stable fill , varying from 1 to 4 metres ( 3 ft 3 in to 13 ft 1 in ) is under the runway to hinder the soil from <unk> during summer .

 Seattle ( / <unk> / ) is a West Coast seaport city and the seat of King County , Washington . With an estimated 684 @,@ 451 residents as of 2015 , Seattle is the largest city in both the state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest region of North America . In July 2013 , it was the fastest @-@ growing major city in the United States and remained in the Top 5 in May 2015 with an annual growth rate of 2 @.@ 1 % . The Seattle metropolitan area is the 15th largest metropolitan area in the United States with over 3 @.@ 7 million inhabitants . The city is situated on an isthmus between Puget Sound ( an inlet of the Pacific Ocean ) and Lake Washington , about 100 miles ( 160 km ) south of the Canada – United States border . A major gateway for trade with Asia , Seattle is the third largest port in North America in terms of container handling as of 2015 . 
 The Seattle area was previously inhabited by Native Americans for at least 4 @,@ 000 years before the first permanent European settlers . Arthur A. Denny and his group of travelers , subsequently known as the Denny Party , arrived from Illinois via Portland , Oregon , on the schooner Exact at Alki Point on November 13 , 1851 . The settlement was moved to the eastern shore of Elliott Bay and named it " Seattle " in 1852 , after Chief Si <unk> of the local Duwamish and Suquamish tribes . 
 Logging was Seattle 's first major industry , but by the late @-@ 19th century , the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush . By 1910 , Seattle was one of the 25 largest cities in the country . However , the Great Depression severely damaged the city 's economy . Growth returned during and after World War II partially due to the local Boeing company , which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing . The Seattle area developed as a technology center beginning in the 1980s , with companies like Microsoft becoming established in the region . In 1994 , Internet retailer Amazon was founded in Seattle . The stream of new software , biotechnology , and Internet companies led to an economic revival , which increased the city 's population by almost 50 @,@ 000 between 1990 and 2000 . 
 Seattle has a noteworthy musical history . From 1918 to 1951 , nearly two dozen jazz nightclubs existed along Jackson Street , from the current Chinatown / International District , to the Central District . The jazz scene developed the early careers of Ray Charles , Quincy Jones , Ernestine Anderson , and others . Seattle is also the birthplace of rock musician Jimi Hendrix and the alternative rock subgenre grunge .

 Archaeological excavations suggest that Native Americans have inhabited the Seattle area for at least 4 @,@ 000 years . By the time the first European settlers arrived , the people ( subsequently called the Duwamish tribe ) occupied at least seventeen villages in the areas around Elliott Bay . 
 The first European to visit the Seattle area was George Vancouver , in May 1792 during his 1791 – 95 expedition to chart the Pacific Northwest . In 1851 , a large party led by Luther Collins made a location on land at the mouth of the Duwamish River ; they formally claimed it on September 14 , 1851 . Thirteen days later , members of the Collins Party on the way to their claim passed three scouts of the Denny Party . Members of the Denny Party claimed land on Alki Point on September 28 , 1851 . The rest of the Denny Party set sail from Portland , Oregon and landed on Alki point during a rainstorm on November 13 , 1851 . 
 = = = Duwamps 1852 – 1853 = = = 
 After a difficult winter , most of the Denny Party relocated across Elliott Bay and claimed land a second time at the site of present @-@ day Pioneer Square , naming this new settlement Duwamps . Charles Terry and John Low remained at the original landing location and reestablished their old land claim and called it " New York " , but renamed " New York Alki " in April 1853 , from a Chinook word meaning , roughly , " by and by " or " someday " . For the next few years , New York Alki and Duwamps competed for dominance , but in time Alki was abandoned and its residents moved across the bay to join the rest of the settlers . 
 David <unk> " Doc " Maynard , one of the founders of Duwamps , was the primary advocate to name the settlement after Chief Sealth ( " Seattle " ) of the Duwamish and Suquamish tribes .

 The name " Seattle " appears on official Washington Territory papers dated May 23 , 1853 , when the first plats for the village were filed . In 1855 , nominal land settlements were established . On January 14 , 1865 , the Legislature of Territorial Washington incorporated the Town of Seattle with a board of trustees managing the city . The town of Seattle was <unk> January 18 , 1867 and remained a mere precinct of King County until late 1869 , when a new petition was filed and the city was re @-@ incorporated December 2 , 1869 with a Mayor @-@ council government . The corporate seal of the City of Seattle carries the date " 1869 " and a likeness of Chief Sealth in left profile .

 Seattle has a history of boom @-@ and @-@ bust cycles , like many other cities near areas of extensive natural and mineral resources . Seattle has risen several times economically , then gone into precipitous decline , but it has typically used those periods to rebuild solid infrastructure . 
 The first such boom , covering the early years of the city , rode on the lumber industry . ( During this period the road now known as <unk> Way won the nickname " Skid Road " , supposedly after the timber skidding down the hill to Henry <unk> 's sawmill . The later dereliction of the area may be a possible origin for the term which later entered the wider American lexicon as Skid Row . ) Like much of the American West , Seattle saw numerous conflicts between labor and management , as well as ethnic tensions that culminated in the anti @-@ Chinese riots of 1885 – 1886 . This violence originated with unemployed whites who were determined to drive the Chinese from Seattle ( anti @-@ Chinese riots also occurred in Tacoma ) . In 1900 , Asians were 4 @.@ 2 % of the population . Authorities declared martial law and federal troops arrived to put down the disorder . 
 Seattle achieved sufficient economic success that when the Great Seattle Fire of 1889 destroyed the central business district , a far grander city @-@ center rapidly emerged in its place . Finance company Washington Mutual , for example , was founded in the immediate wake of the fire . However , the Panic of 1893 hit Seattle hard . 
 = = = Gold Rush , World War I , and the Great Depression = = = 
 The second and most dramatic boom and bust resulted from the Klondike Gold Rush , which ended the depression that had begun with the Panic of 1893 ; in a short time , Seattle became a major transportation center . On July 14 , 1897 , the S.S. Portland docked with its famed " ton of gold " , and Seattle became the main transport and supply point for the miners in Alaska and the Yukon . Few of those working men found lasting wealth , however ; it was Seattle 's business of clothing the miners and feeding them salmon that panned out in the long run . Along with Seattle , other cities like Everett , Tacoma , Port Townsend , Bremerton , and Olympia , all in the Puget Sound region , became competitors for exchange , rather than mother lodes for extraction , of precious metals . The boom lasted well into the early part of the 20th century and funded many new Seattle companies and products . In 1907 , 19 @-@ year @-@ old James E. Casey borrowed $ 100 from a friend and founded the American Messenger Company ( later UPS ) . Other Seattle companies founded during this period include Nordstrom and Eddie Bauer . Seattle brought in the Olmsted Brothers landscape architecture firm to design a system of parks and boulevards . 
 The Gold Rush era culminated in the Alaska @-@ Yukon @-@ Pacific Exposition of 1909 , which is largely responsible for the layout of today 's University of Washington campus . 
 A shipbuilding boom in the early part of the 20th century became massive during World War I , making Seattle somewhat of a company town ; the subsequent retrenchment led to the Seattle General Strike of 1919 , the first general strike in the country . A 1912 city development plan by Virgil Bogue went largely unused . Seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the Great Depression , experiencing some of the country 's harshest labor strife in that era . Violence during the Maritime Strike of 1934 cost Seattle much of its maritime traffic , which was rerouted to the Port of Los Angeles . 
 Seattle was also the home base of impresario Alexander Pantages who , starting in 1902 , opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting vaudeville acts and silent movies . His activities soon expanded , and the thrifty Greek went on and became one of America 's greatest theater and movie tycoons . Between Pantages and his rival John Considine , Seattle was for a while the western United States ' vaudeville mecca . B. Marcus <unk> , the Scottish @-@ born and Seattle @-@ based architect , built several theaters for Pantages , including some in Seattle . The theaters he built for Pantages in Seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses , but many other theaters survive in other cities of the U.S. , often retaining the Pantages name ; Seattle 's surviving Paramount Theatre , on which he collaborated , was not a Pantages theater . 
 = = = Post @-@ war years : aircraft and software = = = 
 War work again brought local prosperity during World War II , this time centered on Boeing aircraft . The war dispersed the city 's numerous Japanese @-@ American businessmen due to the Japanese American internment . After the war , the local economy dipped . It rose again with Boeing 's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market . Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition , the 1962 World 's Fair . Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s , at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises , loss of Government contracts , and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747 . Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere , and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading " Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights . " 
 Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001 , when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities ; the headquarters were moved to Chicago . The Seattle area is still home to Boeing 's Renton narrow @-@ body plant ( where the 707 , 720 , 727 , and 757 were assembled , and the 737 is assembled today ) and Everett wide @-@ body plant ( assembly plant for the 747 , 767 , 777 , and 787 ) . The company 's credit union for employees , <unk> , remains based in the Seattle area , though it is now open to all residents of Washington . 
 As prosperity began to return in the 1980s , the city was stunned by the Wah Mee massacre in 1983 , when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the International District , Seattle 's Chinatown . Beginning with Microsoft 's 1979 move from Albuquerque , New Mexico to nearby Bellevue , Washington , Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including Amazon.com , RealNetworks , Nintendo of America , McCaw Cellular ( now part of AT & T Mobility ) , <unk> ( now T @-@ Mobile ) , and biomedical corporations such as <unk> ( later purchased by Philips ) , Heart Technologies ( later purchased by Boston Scientific ) , <unk> @-@ Control ( later purchased by Medtronic ) , <unk> , <unk> ( later purchased by Eli Lilly and Company ) and Immunex ( later purchased by Amgen ) . This success brought an influx of new residents with a population increase within city limits of almost 50 @,@ 000 between 1990 and 2000 , and saw Seattle 's real estate become some of the most expensive in the country . In 1993 , the movie Sleepless in Seattle brought the city further national attention . Many of the Seattle area 's tech companies remained relatively strong , but the frenzied dot @-@ com boom years ended in early 2001 . 
 Seattle in this period attracted widespread attention as home to these many companies , but also by hosting the 1990 Goodwill Games and the APEC leaders conference in 1993 , as well as through the worldwide popularity of grunge , a sound that had developed in Seattle 's independent music scene . Another bid for worldwide attention — hosting the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 — garnered visibility , but not in the way its sponsors desired , as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the conference itself . The city was further shaken by the Mardi Gras Riots in 2001 , and then literally shaken the following day by the Nisqually earthquake . 
 Yet another boom began as the city emerged from the Great Recession . Amazon.com moved its headquarters from North Beacon Hill to South Lake Union and began a rapid expansion . For the five years beginning in 2010 , Seattle gained an average of 14 @,@ 511 residents per year , with the growth strongly skewed toward the center of the city , as unemployment dropped from roughly 9 percent to 3 @.@ 6 percent . The city has found itself " bursting at the seams " , with over 45 @,@ 000 households spending more than half their income on housing and at least 2 @,@ 800 people homeless , and with the country 's sixth @-@ worst rush hour traffic . 
 = = Geography = = 
 With a land area of 83 @.@ 9 square miles ( 217 @.@ 3 km ² ) , Seattle is the northernmost city with at least 500 @,@ 000 people in the United States , farther north than Canadian cities such as Toronto , Ottawa , and Montreal , at about the same latitude as Salzburg , Austria . 
 The topography of Seattle is hilly . The city lies on several hills , including Capitol Hill , First Hill , West Seattle , Beacon Hill , Magnolia , Denny Hill , and Queen Anne . The Kitsap and the Olympic peninsulas along with the Olympic mountains lie to the west of Puget Sound , while the Cascade Range and Lake Sammamish lie to the east of Lake Washington . The city has over 5 @,@ 540 acres ( 2 @,@ 242 ha ) of parkland .

 Seattle is located between the saltwater Puget Sound ( an arm of the Pacific Ocean ) to the west and Lake Washington to the east . The city 's chief harbor , Elliott Bay , is part of Puget Sound , which makes the city an oceanic port . To the west , beyond Puget Sound , are the Kitsap Peninsula and Olympic Mountains on the Olympic Peninsula ; to the east , beyond Lake Washington and the eastside suburbs , are Lake Sammamish and the Cascade Range . Lake Washington 's waters flow to Puget Sound through the Lake Washington Ship Canal ( consisting of two man @-@ made canals , Lake Union , and the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks at Salmon Bay , ending in <unk> Bay on Puget Sound ) . 
 The sea , rivers , forests , lakes , and fields surrounding Seattle were once rich enough to support one of the world 's few sedentary hunter @-@ gatherer societies . The surrounding area lends itself well to sailing , skiing , bicycling , camping , and hiking year @-@ round . 
 The city itself is hilly , though not uniformly so . Like Rome , the city is said to lie on seven hills ; the lists vary but typically include Capitol Hill , First Hill , West Seattle , Beacon Hill , Queen Anne , Magnolia , and the former Denny Hill . The Wallingford , Mount Baker , and Crown Hill neighborhoods are technically located on hills as well . Many of the hilliest areas are near the city center , with Capitol Hill , First Hill , and Beacon Hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between Elliott Bay and Lake Washington . The break in the ridge between First Hill and Beacon Hill is man @-@ made , the result of two of the many regrading projects that reshaped the topography of the city center . The topography of the city center was also changed by the construction of a seawall and the artificial Harbor Island ( completed 1909 ) at the mouth of the city 's industrial Duwamish Waterway , the terminus of the Green River . The highest point within city limits is at High Point in West Seattle , which is roughly located near 35th Ave SW and SW Myrtle St. Other notable hills include Crown Hill , View Ridge / Wedgwood / Bryant , Maple Leaf , Phinney Ridge , Mt . Baker Ridge , and Highlands / <unk> / <unk> . 
 North of the city center , Lake Washington Ship Canal connects Puget Sound to Lake Washington . It incorporates four natural bodies of water : Lake Union , Salmon Bay , Portage Bay , and Union Bay . 
 Due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire , Seattle is in a major earthquake zone . On February 28 , 2001 , the magnitude 6 @.@ 8 Nisqually earthquake did significant architectural damage , especially in the Pioneer Square area ( built on reclaimed land , as are the Industrial District and part of the city center ) , but caused only one fatality . Other strong quakes occurred on January 26 , 1700 ( estimated at 9 magnitude ) , December 14 , 1872 ( 7 @.@ 3 or 7 @.@ 4 ) , April 13 , 1949 ( 7 @.@ 1 ) , and April 29 , 1965 ( 6 @.@ 5 ) . The 1965 quake caused three deaths in Seattle directly and one more by heart failure . Although the Seattle Fault passes just south of the city center , neither it nor the Cascadia subduction zone has caused an earthquake since the city 's founding . The Cascadia subduction zone poses the threat of an earthquake of magnitude 9 @.@ 0 or greater , capable of seriously damaging the city and collapsing many buildings , especially in zones built on fill . 
 According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 142 @.@ 5 square miles ( 369 km2 ) , 83 @.@ 9 square miles ( 217 km2 ) of which is land and 58 @.@ 7 square miles ( 152 km2 ) , water ( 41 @.@ 16 % of the total area ) . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Seattle 's climate is classified as oceanic or temperate marine , with cool , wet winters and warm , relatively dry summers . Like much of the Pacific Northwest , according to the Köppen climate classification it has a warm @-@ summer Mediterranean climate ( Csb ) . Other climate classification systems , such as Trewartha , place it in the Oceanic zone ( Do ) , like much of Western Europe . The city and environs are part of USDA hardiness zone 8b , with isolated coastal pockets falling under 9a . 
 Hot temperature extremes are enhanced by dry , compressed wind from the west slopes of the Cascades , while cold temperatures are generated mainly from the Fraser Valley in British Columbia . 
 Temperature extremes are moderated by the adjacent Puget Sound , greater Pacific Ocean , and Lake Washington . The region is largely shielded from Pacific storms by the Olympic Mountains and from Arctic air by the Cascade Range . Despite being on the margin of the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains , the city has a reputation for frequent rain . This reputation stems from the frequency of light precipitation in the fall , winter , and spring . In an average year , at least 0 @.@ 01 inches ( 0 @.@ 25 mm ) of precipitation falls on 150 days , more than nearly all U.S. cities east of the Rocky Mountains . It is cloudy 201 days out of the year and partly cloudy 93 days . Official weather and climatic data is collected at Seattle – Tacoma International Airport , located about 19 km ( 12 mi ) south of downtown in the city of SeaTac , which is at a higher elevation , and records more cloudy days and fewer partly cloudy days per year . 
 From 1981 to 2010 , the average annual precipitation measured at Seattle – Tacoma International Airport was 37 @.@ 49 inches ( 952 mm ) . Annual precipitation has ranged from 23 @.@ 78 in ( 604 mm ) in 1952 to 55 @.@ 14 in ( 1 @,@ 401 mm ) in 1950 ; for water year ( October 1 – September 30 ) precipitation , the range is 23 @.@ 16 in ( 588 mm ) in 1976 – 77 to 51 @.@ 82 in ( 1 @,@ 316 mm ) in 1996 – 97 . Due to local variations in microclimate , Seattle also receives significantly lower precipitation than some other locations west of the Cascades . Around 80 mi ( 129 km ) to the west , the Hoh Rain Forest in Olympic National Park on the western flank of the Olympic Mountains receives an annual average precipitation of 142 in ( 3 @.@ 61 m ) . Sixty miles ( 95 km ) to the south of Seattle , the state capital Olympia , which is out of the Olympic Mountains ' rain shadow , receives an annual average precipitation of 50 in ( 1 @,@ 270 mm ) . The city of Bremerton , about 15 mi ( 24 km ) west of downtown Seattle , receives 56 @.@ 4 in ( 1 @,@ 430 mm ) of precipitation annually . 
 In November , Seattle averages more rainfall than any other U.S. city of more than 250 @,@ 000 people ; it also ranks highly in winter precipitation . Conversely , the city receives some of the lowest precipitation amounts of any large city from June to September . Seattle is one of the five rainiest major U.S. cities as measured by the number of days with precipitation , and it receives some of the lowest amounts of annual sunshine among major cities in the lower 48 states , along with some cities in the Northeast , Ohio and Michigan . Thunderstorms are rare , as the city reports thunder on just seven days per year . By comparison , Fort Myers , Florida reports thunder on 93 days per year , Kansas City on 52 , and New York City on 25 . 
 Seattle experiences its heaviest rainfall during the months of November , December and January , receiving roughly half of its annual rainfall ( by volume ) during this period . In late fall and early winter , atmospheric rivers ( also known as " Pineapple Express " systems ) , strong frontal systems , and Pacific low pressure systems are common . Light rain & drizzle are the predominant forms of precipitation during the remainder of the year ; for instance , on average , less than 1 @.@ 6 in ( 41 mm ) of rain falls in July and August combined when rain is rare . On occasion , Seattle experiences somewhat more significant weather events . One such event occurred on December 2 – 4 , 2007 , when sustained hurricane @-@ force winds and widespread heavy rainfall associated with a strong Pineapple Express event occurred in the greater Puget Sound area and the western parts of Washington and Oregon . Precipitation totals exceeded 13 @.@ 8 in ( 350 mm ) in some areas with winds topping out at 209 km / h ( 130 mph ) along coastal Oregon . It became the second wettest event in Seattle history when a little over 130 mm ( 5 @.@ 1 in ) of rain fell on Seattle in a 24 @-@ hour period . Lack of adaptation to the heavy rain contributed to five deaths and widespread flooding and damage . 
 Autumn , winter , and early spring are frequently characterized by rain . Winters are cool and wet with December , the coolest month , averaging 40 @.@ 6 ° F ( 4 @.@ 8 ° C ) , with 28 annual days with lows that reach the freezing mark , and 2 @.@ 0 days where the temperature stays at or below freezing all day ; the temperature rarely lowers to 20 ° F ( − 7 ° C ) . Summers are sunny , dry and warm , with August , the warmest month , averaging 66 @.@ 1 ° F ( 18 @.@ 9 ° C ) , and with temperatures reaching 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) on 3 @.@ 1 days per year , although 2011 is the most recent year to not reach 90 ° F. The hottest officially recorded temperature was 103 ° F ( 39 ° C ) on July 29 , 2009 ; the coldest recorded temperature was 0 ° F ( − 18 ° C ) on January 31 , 1950 ; the record cold daily maximum is 16 ° F ( − 9 ° C ) on January 14 , 1950 , while , conversely , the record warm daily minimum is 71 ° F ( 22 ° C ) the day the official record high was set . The average window for freezing temperatures is November 16 through March 10 , allowing a growing season of 250 days . 
 Seattle typically receives some snowfall on an annual basis but heavy snow is rare . Average annual snowfall , as measured at Sea @-@ Tac Airport , is 6 @.@ 8 inches ( 17 @.@ 3 cm ) . Single calendar @-@ day snowfall of six inches ( 15 cm ) or greater has occurred on only 15 days since 1948 , and only once since February 17 , 1990 , when 6 @.@ 8 in ( 17 @.@ 3 cm ) of snow officially fell at Sea @-@ Tac airport on January 18 , 2012 . This moderate snow event was officially the 12th snowiest calendar day at the airport since 1948 and snowiest since November 1985 . Much of the city of Seattle proper received somewhat lesser snowfall accumulations . Locations to the south of Seattle received more , with Olympia and Chehalis receiving 14 to 18 in ( 36 to 46 cm ) . Another moderate snow event occurred from December 12 – 25 , 2008 , when over one foot ( 30 cm ) of snow fell and stuck on much of the roads over those two weeks , when temperatures remained below 32 ° F ( 0 ° C ) , causing widespread difficulties in a city not equipped for clearing snow . The largest documented snowstorm occurred from January 5 – 9 , 1880 , with snow drifting to 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) in places at the end of the snow event . From January 31 to February 2 , 1916 , another heavy snow event occurred with 29 in ( 74 cm ) of snow on the ground by the time the event was over . With official records dating to 1948 , the largest single @-@ day snowfall is 20 @.@ 0 in ( 51 cm ) on January 13 , 1950 . Seasonal snowfall has ranged from zero in 1991 – 92 to 67 @.@ 5 in ( 171 cm ) in 1968 – 69 , with trace amounts having occurred as recently as 2009 – 10 . The month of January 1950 was particularly severe , bringing 57 @.@ 2 in ( 145 cm ) of snow , the most of any month along with the aforementioned record cold . 
 The Puget Sound Convergence Zone is an important feature of Seattle 's weather . In the convergence zone , air arriving from the north meets air flowing in from the south . Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean ; airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle 's west , then reunited to the east . When the air currents meet , they are forced upward , resulting in convection . Thunderstorms caused by this activity are usually weak and can occur north and south of town , but Seattle itself rarely receives more than occasional thunder and small hail showers . The Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to 69 mph ( 111 km / h ) , an event that was not caused by the Puget Sound Convergence Zone and was widespread across the Pacific Northwest . 
 One of many exceptions to Seattle 's reputation as a damp location occurs in El Niño years , when marine weather systems track as far south as California and little precipitation falls in the Puget Sound area . Since the region 's water comes from mountain snow packs during the dry summer months , El Niño winters can not only produce substandard skiing but can result in water rationing and a shortage of hydroelectric power the following summer .

 It is estimated that King County has 8 @,@ 000 homeless people on any given night , and many of those live in Seattle . In September 2005 , King County adopted a " Ten @-@ Year Plan to End Homelessness " , one of the near @-@ term results of which is a shift of funding from homeless shelter beds to permanent housing . 
 In recent years , the city has experienced steady population growth , and has been faced with the issue of accommodating more residents . In 2006 , after growing by 4 @,@ 000 citizens per year for the previous 16 years , regional planners expected the population of Seattle to grow by 200 @,@ 000 people by 2040 . However , former mayor Greg Nickels supported plans that would increase the population by 60 % , or 350 @,@ 000 people , by 2040 and worked on ways to accommodate this growth while keeping Seattle 's single @-@ family housing zoning laws . The Seattle City Council later voted to relax height limits on buildings in the greater part of Downtown , partly with the aim to increase residential density in the city centre . As a sign of increasing inner @-@ city growth , the downtown population crested to over 60 @,@ 000 in 2009 , up 77 % since 1990 . 
 Seattle also has large lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender populations . According to a 2006 study by UCLA , 12 @.@ 9 % of city residents polled identified as gay , lesbian , or bisexual .

 = = Economy = = 
 Seattle 's economy is driven by a mix of older industrial companies , and " new economy " Internet and technology companies , service , design and clean technology companies . The city 's gross metropolitan product was $ 231 billion in 2010 , making it the 11th largest metropolitan economy in the United States . The Port of Seattle , which also operates Seattle – Tacoma International Airport , is a major gateway for trade with Asia and cruises to Alaska , and is the 8th largest port in the United States in terms of container capacity . Though it was affected by the Great Recession , Seattle has retained a comparatively strong economy , and remains a hotbed for start @-@ up businesses , especially in green building and clean technologies : it was ranked as America 's No. 1 " smarter city " based on its government policies and green economy . In February 2010 , the city government committed Seattle to becoming North America 's first " climate neutral " city , with a goal of reaching zero net per capita greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 . 
 Still , very large companies dominate the business landscape . Four companies on the 2013 Fortune 500 list of the United States ' largest companies , based on total revenue , are headquartered in Seattle : Internet retailer Amazon.com ( # 49 ) , coffee chain Starbucks ( # 208 ) , department store Nordstrom ( # 227 ) , and freight <unk> <unk> International of Washington ( # 428 ) .

Former Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels announced a desire to spark a new economic boom driven by the biotechnology industry in 2006 . Major redevelopment of the South Lake Union neighborhood is underway , in an effort to attract new and established biotech companies to the city , joining biotech companies <unk> ( acquired by GlaxoSmithKline ) , Immunex ( now part of Amgen ) , <unk> , and <unk> . Vulcan Inc . , the holding company of billionaire Paul Allen , is behind most of the development projects in the region . While some see the new development as an economic boon , others have criticized Nickels and the Seattle City Council for pandering to Allen 's interests at taxpayers ' expense . Also in 2006 , Expansion Magazine ranked Seattle among the top 10 metropolitan areas in the nation for climates favorable to business expansion .

 = = Government and politics = = 
 Seattle is a charter city , with a Mayor – Council form of government . From 1911 to 2013 , Seattle 's nine city councillors were elected at large , rather than by geographic subdivisions . For the 2015 election , this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5 , 2013 . The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges . All city offices are technically non @-@ partisan . 
 Like most parts of the United States , government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives ( allowing citizens to pass or reject laws ) , referenda ( allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed ) , and propositions ( allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws / tax increases directly to the people ) . Federally , Seattle is part of Washington 's 7th congressional district , represented by Democrat Jim McDermott , elected in 1988 and one of Congress 's liberal members . Ed Murray is currently serving as mayor . 
 Seattle 's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States , with over 80 % of the population voting for the Democratic Party . All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election . In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress , nearly all elections are won by Democrats . Seattle is considered the first major American city to elect a female mayor , Bertha Knight Landes . It has also elected an openly gay mayor , Ed Murray , and a socialist councillor , <unk> Sawant . For the first time in United States history , an openly gay black woman was elected to public office when Sherry Harris was elected as a Seattle city councillor in 1991 . The majority of the current city council is female , while white men comprise a minority . 
 Seattle is widely considered one of the most liberal cities in the United States , even surpassing its neighbor , Portland , Oregon . Support for issues such as same @-@ sex marriage and reproductive rights are largely taken for granted in local politics . In the 2012 U.S. general election , an overwhelming majority of Seattleites voted to approve Referendum 74 and legalize gay marriage in Washington state . In the same election , an overwhelming majority of Seattleites also voted to approve the legalization of the recreational use of cannabis in the state . Like much of the Pacific Northwest ( which has the lowest rate of church attendance in the United States and consistently reports the highest percentage of atheism ) , church attendance , religious belief , and political influence of religious leaders are much lower than in other parts of America . 
 Seattle also has a thriving alternative press , with the Web @-@ based daily Seattle Post @-@ Intelligencer , several other online dailies ( including Publicola and <unk> ) , The Stranger ( an alternative , left @-@ leaning weekly ) , Seattle Weekly , and a number of issue @-@ focused publications , including the nation 's two largest online environmental magazines , <unk> and <unk>

The city was listed as the most literate of the country 's 69 largest cities in 2005 and 2006 , the second most literate in 2007 and the most literate in 2008 in studies conducted by Central Connecticut State University . 
 Seattle Public Schools desegregated without a court order but continue to struggle to achieve racial balance in a somewhat ethnically divided city ( the south part of town having more ethnic minorities than the north ) . In 2007 , Seattle 's racial tie @-@ breaking system was struck down by the United States Supreme Court , but the ruling left the door open for desegregation formulae based on other indicators ( e.g. , income or socioeconomic class ) . 
 The public school system is supplemented by a moderate number of private schools : five of the private high schools are Catholic , one is Lutheran , and six are secular . 
 Seattle is home to the University of Washington , as well as the institution 's professional and continuing education unit , the University of Washington Educational Outreach . A study by Newsweek International in 2006 cited the University of Washington as the twenty @-@ second best university in the world .

 Three of Seattle 's largest medical centers are located on First Hill . Harborview Medical Center , the public county hospital , is the only Level I trauma hospital in a region that includes Washington , Alaska , Montana , and Idaho . Virginia Mason Medical Center and Swedish Medical Center 's two largest campuses are also located in this part of Seattle , including the Virginia Mason Hospital . This concentration of hospitals resulted in the neighborhood 's nickname " Pill Hill " . 
 Located in the <unk> neighborhood , Seattle Children 's , formerly Children 's Hospital and Regional Medical Center , is the pediatric referral center for Washington , Alaska , Montana , and Idaho . The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center has a campus in the Eastlake neighborhood .

 = = = Transportation = = = 
 The first streetcars appeared in 1889 and were instrumental in the creation of a relatively well @-@ defined downtown and strong neighborhoods at the end of their lines . The advent of the automobile sounded the death knell for rail in Seattle . Tacoma – Seattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett – Seattle service came to an end in 1939 , replaced by inexpensive automobiles running on the recently developed highway system . Rails on city streets were paved over or removed , and the opening of the Seattle trolleybus system brought the end of streetcars in Seattle in 1941 . This left an extensive network of privately owned buses ( later public ) as the only mass transit within the city and throughout the region . 
 King County Metro provides frequent stop bus service within the city and surrounding county , as well as a South Lake Union Streetcar line between the South Lake Union neighborhood and Westlake Center in downtown . Seattle is one of the few cities in North America whose bus fleet includes electric trolleybuses . Sound Transit currently provides an express bus service within the metropolitan area , two Sounder commuter rail lines between the suburbs and downtown , and its Central Link light rail line between the University of Washington and Sea @-@ Tac Airport . Washington State Ferries , which manages the largest network of ferries in the United States and third largest in the world , connects Seattle to Bainbridge and Vashon Islands in Puget Sound and to Bremerton and Southworth on the Kitsap Peninsula . 
 According to the 2007 American Community Survey , 18 @.@ 6 % of Seattle residents used one of the three public transit systems that serve the city , giving it the highest transit ridership of all major cities without heavy or light rail prior to the completion of Sound Transit 's Central Link line . The city has also been described by Bert Sperling as the fourth most walkable U.S. city and by Walk Score as the sixth most walkable of the fifty largest U.S. cities . 
 Seattle – Tacoma International Airport , locally known as Sea @-@ Tac Airport and located just south in the neighboring city of SeaTac , is operated by the Port of Seattle and provides commercial air service to destinations throughout the world . Closer to downtown , Boeing Field is used for general aviation , cargo flights , and testing / delivery of Boeing airliners . 
 The main mode of transportation , however , relies on Seattle 's streets , which are laid out in a cardinal directions grid pattern , except in the central business district where early city leaders Arthur Denny and Carson Boren insisted on orienting their plats relative to the shoreline rather than to true North . Only two roads , Interstate 5 and State Route 99 ( both limited @-@ access highways ) , run uninterrupted through the city from north to south . State Route 99 runs through downtown Seattle on the Alaskan Way Viaduct , which was built in 1953 . However , due to damage sustained during the 2001 Nisqually earthquake the viaduct will be replaced by a tunnel . The 2 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) Alaskan Way Viaduct replacement tunnel was originally scheduled to be completed in December 2015 at a cost of US $ 4 @.@ 25 billion . Unfortunately , due to issues with the worlds largest tunnel boring machine ( TBM ) , which is nicknamed " Bertha " and is 57 feet ( 17 m ) in diameter , the projected date of completion has been pushed back to 2017 . Seattle has the 8th worst traffic congestion of all American cities , and is 10th among all North American cities . 
 The city has started moving away from the automobile and towards mass transit . From 2004 to 2009 , the annual number of unlinked public transportation trips increased by approximately 21 % . In 2006 , voters in King County passed proposition 2 ( Transit Now ) which increased bus service hours on high ridership routes and paid for five bus rapid transit lines called RapidRide . After rejecting a roads and transit measure in 2007 , Seattle @-@ area voters passed a transit only measure in 2008 to increase ST Express bus service , extend the Link Light Rail system , and expand and improve Sounder commuter rail service . A light rail line from downtown heading south to Sea @-@ Tac Airport began service on December 19 , 2009 , giving the city its first rapid transit line with intermediate stations within the city limits . An extension north to the University of Washington opened on March 19 , 2016 ; and further extensions are planned to reach Lynnwood to the north , Des Moines to the south , and Bellevue and Redmond to the east by 2023 . Former mayor Michael McGinn has supported building light rail from downtown to Ballard and West Seattle .

 = Minnesota State Highway 610 = 
 Minnesota State Highway 610 ( MN 610 ) is an east – west freeway in the Twin Cities region of Minnesota . The freeway connects County Road 81 ( CR 81 ) and CR 130 in northern Hennepin County to U.S. Highway 10 ( US 10 ) in southern Anoka County . MN 610 crosses the Mississippi River on the Richard P. Braun Bridge between suburban Brooklyn Park and Coon Rapids . The highway is 9 @.@ 8 miles ( 15 @.@ 8 km ) long . 
 The freeway was authorized in 1975 , and most of the sections that are open were completed by 2000 ( 7 @.@ 2 mi or 11 @.@ 6 km ) ; the 2 @.@ 6 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 2 km ) section westward to CR 81 in Maple Grove was completed and opened in 2011 . There is a segment that is planned to extend farther to end at Interstate 94 ( I @-@ 94 ) . The Minnesota Department of Transportation ( Mn / DOT ) scheduled the project to start in late 2014 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 MN 610 starts at its interchange with CR 81 in Maple Grove . From this starting point , the freeway runs eastbound through the northern suburbs of the Twin Cities . MN 610 is four lanes in width and has several interchanges with local streets and county roads before expanding to six lanes and meeting the northern terminus of MN 252 on the west bank of the Mississippi River . After MN 252 interchange , the MN 610 freeway turns to the northeast and crosses the Mississippi River on the dual @-@ span , eight @-@ lane Richard P. Braun Bridge . 
 Across the river , the freeway runs along the south side of the Coon Rapids Dam Regional Park before curving around to the east . It continues through suburban Coon Rapids as a six @-@ lane freeway to a partial interchange with northbound MN 47 . This interchange is used by eastbound traffic transitioning to westbound US 10 . The final section east to US 10 in Blaine is four lanes . The second interchange along this section of the freeway with University Avenue is used to connect with MN 47 southbound . The last interconnected interchange is at the eastern terminus as traffic defaults onto US 10 eastbound . 
 Legally , MN 610 is defined as Route 333 in the Minnesota Statutes § 161 @.@ 115 ( 264 ) . The highway is not marked with this legislative route number along the actual highway . The entire route of MN 610 has been listed on the National Highway System , a system of roads important to the nation 's economy , defense , and mobility . 
 = = History = = 
 MN 610 was proposed in the middle of the 1960s as a " North Crosstown " freeway . Studies for the highway started in the 1970s . The highway was first authorized on June 2 , 1975 . The westbound span of the Mississippi River bridge was built in 1985 , and , along with the existing freeway east of MN 252 , was opened in October 1987 . Officials in Minnesota proposed tolls as a means to fund the construction on the highway in 1989 . Local officials supported the highway construction , but opposed the tolling plans . 
 West of MN 252 , the freeway construction started in June 1997 . The freeway was opened to traffic in 2000 , with a traffic light at the intersection of MN 610 and US 169 initially . Construction on the second bridge over the Mississippi River for eastbound traffic started in 1999 , to be completed in 2002 . 
 Construction of the portion between US 169 and CR 81 was estimated to cost $ 48 million in 2010 , of which $ 27 million is being funded by federal stimulus money . The project began in October 2009 , and it was scheduled to be completed in July 2011 . The remainder of the highway to I @-@ 94 is not on a Mn / DOT schedule to be built . The new western terminus will be located at Elm Creek Boulevard in Maple Grove . The freeway continues westward from this point in the median of CR 81 , but this section will be an unused stub end past the ramps that connect to CR 81 During the 2011 Minnesota state government shutdown , construction on MN 610 was halted for 20 days . Until work stopped on July 1 , 2011 , a ribbon @-@ cutting ceremony had been scheduled to open the new freeway section on July 12 . The ribbon cutting ceremony was on August 17 and the road opened on August 19 . 
 = = Future = = 
 MN 610 is planned to extend west to I @-@ 94 in Maple Grove , and the freeway 's mile markers reflect these plans , with the zero point calibrated to this future terminus . A portion of this new section is very unusual ; it is routed down the middle of the median of CR 81 in Maple Grove , forming a roadway within a roadway . 
 There are worries about traffic after the last extension was opened in 2011 . The local mayors are concerned with the traffic levels on CR 81 now that MN 610 is opened . " County Road 81 is already a fairly busy road without this additional traffic , and now there will be a substantial increase in traffic , " according to Maple Grove Mayor Mark <unk> ; he is urging Mn / DOT to complete the remainder of the freeway to I @-@ 94 to alleviate these traffic concerns . Construction on this last segment of highway was scheduled to start in October 2014 . 
 On April 4 , 2016 , construction started on an interchange with Maple Grove Parkway . The interchange is set to open in October 2016 .

 = Adelaide leak = 
 The Adelaide leak was the revelation to the press of a dressing @-@ room incident during the third Test , a cricket match played during the 1932 – 33 Ashes series between Australia and England , more commonly known as the Bodyline series . During the course of play on 14 January 1933 , the Australian Test captain Bill Woodfull was struck over the heart by a ball delivered by Harold Larwood . Although not badly hurt , Woodfull was shaken and dismissed shortly afterwards . On his return to the Australian dressing room , Woodfull was visited by the managers of the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) team , Pelham Warner and Richard Palairet . Warner enquired after Woodfull 's health , but the latter dismissed his concerns in brusque fashion . He said he did not want to speak to the Englishman owing to the Bodyline tactics England were using , leaving Warner embarrassed and shaken . The matter became public knowledge when someone present leaked the exchange to the press and it was widely reported on 16 January . Such leaks to the press were practically unknown at the time , and the players were horrified that the confrontation became public knowledge . 
 In the immediate aftermath , many people assumed Jack Fingleton , the only full @-@ time journalist on either team , was responsible . This belief may have affected the course of his subsequent career . Fingleton later wrote that Donald Bradman , Australia 's star batsman and the primary target of Bodyline , was the person who disclosed the story . Bradman always denied this , and continued to blame Fingleton ; animosity between the pair continued for the rest of their lives . Woodfull 's earlier public silence on the tactics had been interpreted as approval ; the leak was significant in persuading the Australian public that Bodyline was unacceptable . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1932 – 33 the English team , led by Douglas Jardine and jointly managed by Pelham Warner and Richard Palairet , toured Australia and won the Ashes in an acrimonious contest that became known as the Bodyline series . The English team used contentious bowling tactics where the English pace bowlers Harold Larwood , Bill Voce and Bill Bowes bowled the ball roughly on the line of leg stump . The deliveries were often short @-@ pitched , designed to rise at the batsman 's body , with four or five fielders close by on the leg side waiting to catch deflections off the bat . Intended to be intimidating , the tactics proved difficult for batsmen to counter and were physically threatening . The primary target of Bodyline was Donald Bradman , who had overwhelmed the English bowling in the 1930 Ashes series . Leading English cricketers and administrators feared that Bradman would be unstoppable on good Australian batting wickets in 1932 – 33 , and looked for possible weaknesses in his batting technique . 
 Following Jardine 's appointment as England captain in July 1932 , he developed a plan based on his belief that Bradman was weak against bowling directed at leg stump and that if this line of attack could be maintained , it would restrict Bradman 's scoring to one side of the field , giving the bowlers greater control of his scoring . In a meeting , he outlined his plan to Larwood and Voce , who tried out the tactic in the remainder of the season with mixed success . Both Nottinghamshire fast bowlers were selected to tour , as was Yorkshire bowler Bill Bowes who had tried similar tactics at the end of the season . In one match , he bowled short at Jack Hobbs ; in his capacity as cricket correspondent of The Morning Post , Warner was highly critical of the Yorkshire bowlers and Bowes in particular . These remarks were seized upon by Australian opponents of Bodyline in the coming months . A fourth fast bowler , Middlesex amateur Gubby Allen , was later added to the tour . The selection of this many pace bowlers was unusual at the time , drawing comment from Australian writers , including Bradman . 
 In Australia , while Jardine 's unfriendly approach and superior manner caused some friction with the press and spectators , the early tour matches were uncontroversial and Larwood and Voce had a light workload in preparation for the Test series . The first signs of trouble came in the match against a representative " Australian XI " at near full strength , in which the bowlers first used Bodyline tactics . Under the captaincy of Bob Wyatt ( Jardine having rested from the match ) , the England attack bowled short and around leg stump , with fielders positioned close by on the leg side to catch any deflections . Wyatt later claimed this was not pre @-@ planned and he simply informed Jardine what had happened . The Bodyline tactics continued in the next match and several players , including Jack Fingleton , were hit . The Australian press were shocked and criticised the hostility of Larwood in particular . Some former Australian players joined the criticism , saying the tactics were ethically wrong . However , at this stage , not everyone was opposed , and the Australian Board of Control believed the English team had bowled fairly . On the other hand , Jardine increasingly came into disagreement with tour manager Warner over Bodyline as the tour progressed . Warner hated Bodyline but would not speak out against it . He was accused of hypocrisy for not taking a stand on either side , particularly after expressing sentiments at the start of the tour that cricket " has become a synonym for all that is true and honest . To say ' that is not cricket ' implies something underhand , something not in keeping with the best ideals ... all who love it as players , as officials or spectators must be careful lest anything they do should do it harm . " 
 Jardine 's tactics were successful in one respect : in six innings against the tourists ahead of the Tests , Bradman scored only 103 runs , causing concern among the Australian public who expected much more from him . At the time , Bradman was in dispute with the Board of Control , who would not allow players to write in newspapers unless journalism was their full @-@ time profession ; Bradman , although not a journalist , had a contract to write for the Sydney Sun . A particular irritation for Bradman was that Jack Fingleton , a full @-@ time journalist , was allowed to write for the Telegraph Pictorial , although he required permission from the Board to write about cricket . Bradman threatened to withdraw from the team unless the Board allowed him to write . Fingleton and Bradman were openly hostile towards each other . From their first meeting while playing together for New South Wales , they disliked each other . Fingleton , conscious that Bradman 's self @-@ possession and solitary nature made him unpopular with some team @-@ mates , kept his distance after a dressing room argument , while Bradman believed the more popular Fingleton had tried to turn the team against him . Later hostility arose from Bradman 's public preference for Bill Brown as a batsman , which Fingleton believed cost him a place on the 1934 tour of England . Fingleton 's writings on the Bodyline series further soured the relationship . Bradman believed some of the differences stemmed from religion ; Fingleton was a Roman Catholic , Bradman an Anglican . 
 Bradman missed the first Test , worn out by constant cricket and the ongoing argument with the Board of Control . The English bowlers used Bodyline intermittently in the first match , to the crowd 's vocal displeasure . Behind the scenes , administrators began to express concerns to each other . Yet the English tactics still did not earn universal disapproval ; former Australian captain Monty Noble praised the English bowling . For the second Test , Bradman returned to the team after his newspaper employers released him from his contract . England continued to use Bodyline and Bradman was dismissed by his first ball in the first innings . In the second innings , against the full Bodyline attack , he scored an unbeaten century which helped Australia to win the match and level the series at one match each . Critics began to believe Bodyline was not quite the threat that had been perceived and Bradman 's reputation , which had suffered slightly with his earlier failures , was restored . However , the pitch was slightly slower than others in the series , and Larwood was suffering from problems with his boots which reduced his effectiveness . Meanwhile , Woodfull was being encouraged to retaliate to the short @-@ pitched English attack , not least by members of his own side such as Vic Richardson , but refused to consider doing so .

 During the mid @-@ afternoon of Saturday 14 January 1933 , the second day of the Third Test , Woodfull and Fingleton opened the batting for Australia in the face of an England total of 341 before a record attendance of 50 @,@ 962 people . Fingleton was caught by the wicketkeeper without scoring . The third over of the innings was bowled by Larwood with fielders still in orthodox positions . The fifth ball narrowly missed Woodfull 's head and the final ball , delivered short on the line of middle stump , struck Woodfull over the heart . The batsman dropped his bat and staggered away holding his chest , bent over in pain . The England players surrounded Woodfull to offer sympathy but the crowd began to protest noisily . Jardine called to Larwood : " Well bowled , Harold ! " Although the comment was aimed at unnerving Bradman , who was also batting at the time , Woodfull was appalled . Play resumed after a brief delay , once it was certain the Australian captain was fit to carry on , and since Larwood 's over had ended , Woodfull did not have to face the bowling of Allen in the next over . However , when Larwood was ready to bowl at Woodfull again , play was halted once more when the fielders were moved into Bodyline positions , causing the crowd to protest and call abuse at the England team . Subsequently , Jardine claimed that Larwood requested a field change , Larwood said that Jardine had done so . Many commentators condemned the alteration of the field as unsporting , and the angry spectators became extremely volatile . Jardine , although writing that Woodfull could have retired hurt if he was unfit , later expressed his regret at making the field change at that moment . It is likely Jardine wished to press home his team 's advantage in the match , and the Bodyline field was usually employed at this stage of an innings . 
 Shortly afterwards , a delivery from Larwood knocked Woodfull 's bat from his hands and the Australian captain seemed unsettled . Two quick wickets fell before Ponsford joined Woodfull in the middle , but having been struck by short balls several more times , Woodfull was bowled by Allen for 22 , having batted for an hour and a half . When a doctor was publicly requested , to attend an injury to Voce , many in the crowd believed it was Woodfull who required assistance , leading to a renewal of protest . In later years , Woodfull 's wife believed that his injury at Adelaide was partly responsible for his death aged 67 in 1965 . 
 = = = Warner 's visit to the dressing room = = = 
 Warner learned from twelfth man Leo O 'Brien that Woodfull was badly injured . Later in the afternoon , while Ponsford and Richardson were still batting , Warner and Palairet visited the Australian dressing room with the intention of enquiring about Woodfull 's health . Accounts vary about what followed . According to the original newspaper reports and Fingleton 's later description , Woodfull was lying on the masseur 's table , awaiting treatment from a doctor , although this may have been an exaggeration for dramatic effect . Leo O 'Brien described Woodfull as wearing a towel around his waist , having showered . Warner expressed sympathy to Woodfull but was surprised by the Australian 's response . According to Warner , Woodfull replied , " I don 't want to see you , Mr Warner . There are two teams out there . One is trying to play cricket and the other is not . " Fingleton wrote that Woodfull had added , " This game is too good to be spoilt . It is time some people got out of it . " Woodfull was usually dignified and quietly spoken , making his reaction surprising to Warner and others present . Warner recalled saying , " Apart from all that , we most sincerely hope you are not too badly hurt , " to which Woodfull replied , " The bruise is coming out . " Embarrassed and humiliated , Warner and Palairet turned and left . Fingleton noted that Woodfull spoke quietly and calmly , which increased the effectiveness of his words . He also pointed out that Warner prided himself on sportsmanship , so an accusation of " not playing cricket " would have stung the Englishman . Warner was so shaken that he was found in tears later that day in his hotel room . 
 According to O 'Brien , only he , Woodfull , the masseur ( who was deaf ) , Alan Kippax , and former Australian Test players Jack Ryder and Ernie Jones were present when the incident took place , but most of the Australian team were watching the match from a balcony adjoining the dressing room from where they would have been able to hear the confrontation . O 'Brien claimed that he went outside and told the group what had happened ; around twenty people were present . 
 Later that afternoon , Warner related the incident to Jardine , who replied that he " couldn 't care less " . The England captain then locked the dressing room doors and told the team what Woodfull had said and warned them not to speak to anyone concerning the matter . Warner later wrote to his wife that Woodfull had made " a complete fool of himself " and had been " fanning the flames " . 
 = = Leak = = 
 Sunday being a rest day , there was no play . On Monday , the exchange between Warner and Woodfull was reported in several newspapers along with the description of Woodfull 's injury . Most headlines were variations on " Woodfull Protests " , and the most extensive accounts were by Claude Corbett in The Sun and The Daily Telegraph . He wrote in the Telegraph that the " fires which have been smouldering in the ranks of the Australian Test cricketers regarding the English shock attack suddenly burst into flames yesterday . " Another newspaper , The Advertiser of Adelaide , claimed several members of the Australian team had repeated the story . 
 The players and officials were horrified that a sensitive private exchange had been reported to the press . Leaks to the press were practically unknown in 1933 . David Frith notes that discretion and respect were highly prized and such a leak was " regarded as a moral offence of the first order . " Woodfull made it clear that he severely disapproved of the leak , and later wrote that he " always expected cricketers to do the right thing by their team @-@ mates . " As the only full @-@ time journalist in the Australian team , suspicion immediately fell on Fingleton , although as soon as the story was published , he told Woodfull he was not responsible . Warner offered Larwood a reward of one pound if he could dismiss Fingleton in the second innings ; Larwood obliged by bowling him for a duck . 
 Later , Warner issued a statement to the press that Woodfull had apologised for the incident and that " we are now the best of friends " . Woodfull denied through Bill Jeanes , the Secretary of the Australian Board of Control , that he had expressed regret , but he had said there was no personal animosity between the two men . 
 = = = Suspects = = = 
 Until he read Warner 's Cricket Between Two Wars during the Second World War , Fingleton was unaware that Warner assumed he was responsible for the leak . When he found out , Fingleton wrote to Warner , who replied that although he believed Fingleton to be the source , he would publish a correction if presented with evidence to the contrary . Fingleton did not pursue the case . Australian cricketer Bill O 'Reilly wrote that during the 1948 tour of England , he and Fingleton confronted Warner , who apologised as he no longer believed Fingleton to be the culprit . Fingleton thought the belief he was responsible cost him a place on the 1934 tour to England , although there were other possible factors in his exclusion . According to Fingleton , Woodfull later told him that the controversy had led to his missing selection . A letter which Woodfull wrote to Fingleton in 1943 stated " I can assure you that I did not connect your name with the passing on of that conversation . " 
 In his 1978 biography of Victor Trumper , Fingleton accused Bradman of relating Woodfull 's words to the press . Fingleton claimed that Claude Corbett revealed the information to him . In Fingleton 's version of events , Bradman telephoned Corbett during the night to arrange a meeting . Bradman wrote for Corbett 's paper , Sydney 's Sun . Sitting in Corbett 's car , Bradman told the journalist about the Warner – Woodfull incident . Corbett considered the story too important to keep to himself , so shared it with other journalists . Fingleton later added that " Bradman would have saved me a lot of backlash ... had he admitted that he had given the leak . Part of his job was writing for the Sydney Sun and he had every right to leak such a vital story . " 
 Bradman denied this version of events . In 1983 , two years after Fingleton 's death , a book written by Michael Page , with Bradman 's close co @-@ operation , blamed Fingleton for the leak and dismissed Fingleton 's story concerning Bradman and Corbett as " an absurd fabrication " , arising from a grudge against Bradman . The book pointed out that Fingleton only made the accusation after Corbett 's death . Fingleton 's executor , Malcolm Gemmell , summarised the evidence which supported Fingleton 's accusation in a magazine article : that Bradman wrote for the Sun , was the prime target of Bodyline , and had previously urged the Australian Board of Control to object to the tactic . Fingleton 's brother supported the claim that Bradman was responsible , repeating in 1997 the alleged view of Corbett that Bradman provided the information . In 1995 , Bradman was interviewed for television , and when asked about the source of the leak , responded sharply : " It wasn 't me ! " In the same year , a biography of Bradman , written with his close co @-@ operation , by Roland Perry , said that Bradman had confronted Corbett to ask who leaked the story , to be told it was Fingleton . 
 O 'Reilly believed that Bradman , with whom he did not get along , was responsible , wishing to expose the English bowling he believed was designed to cause him physical injury . He also said Bradman was an expert at diverting blame . Cricket writer Ray Robinson wrote that many of the Australian team did not blame Fingleton , and they knew who met Corbett . In the early 1980s another journalist , Michael Davie , interviewed Ponsford who said that Woodfull never forgave Bradman for " a couple of things " . Davie suggests that one of these may have been leaking the Adelaide story . 
 Gilbert Mant , a journalist who covered the tour , investigated the leak in the mid @-@ 1990s . He died in 1997 , but had arranged for a summary of his findings to be sent to David Frith with a request not to publish the information before Bradman died . Mant believed the leak was not a serious crime and pointed out that any of the players except Ponsford and Richardson , who were batting at the time Warner entered the dressing room , could have leaked the story . Bradman , in correspondence with Mant in 1992 , continued to blame Fingleton and would never forgive the " dastardly lie he concocted about me " and hoped Mant could clear Bradman 's name . As part of his investigations , Mant contacted Corbett 's family . Corbett died in 1944 , and his son Mac said he never mentioned the leak . However , his daughter Helen related that Corbett had spoken to his wife about the affair . She had told Helen that Corbett had received the information from Bradman . Mant believed that while Corbett may have played a joke on Fingleton in naming the culprit , he would not have done so with his wife . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 Many commentators and cricketers deplored the use of Bodyline bowling . Some felt frustration that Woodfull had not publicly condemned the tactics , believing that his silence was interpreted as approval . Once his opinions were revealed by the leak , opponents of Bodyline felt publicly legitimised and expressed their opinions more freely . It also revealed deep and unaccustomed divisions between the teams which had been kept from view . The leak and subsequent events in the same match brought varied opinions from journalists and former players on Bodyline into the newspapers , both for and against Bodyline tactics . 
 During the play on Monday , a short ball from Larwood fractured Bert Oldfield 's skull , although Bodyline tactics were not being used at the time . The Australian Board of Control contacted the MCC managers Warner and Palairet asking them to arrange for the team to cease the use of Bodyline , but they replied the captain was solely in charge of the playing side of the tour . On the Wednesday of the game , the Australian Board sent a cable to the MCC which stated " Bodyline bowling has assumed such proportions as to menace the best interests of the game , making protection of the body by the batsman the main consideration . This is causing intensely bitter feeling between the players , as well as injury . In our opinion it is unsportsmanlike . Unless stopped at once it is likely to upset the friendly relations existing between Australia and England . " After England 's victory in the match , Jardine went to the Australian dressing room but had the door closed in his face . Speaking to his team , Jardine offered to end the use of the tactics if the players opposed them , but they unanimously voted to continue . The report in Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack stated it was probably the most unpleasant match ever played . 
 Jardine threatened to withdraw his team from the Fourth and Fifth Tests unless the Australian Board retracted the accusation of unsporting behaviour . The MCC responded angrily to the accusations of unsporting conduct , played down the Australian claims about the danger of Bodyline and threatened to call off the tour . The series had become a major diplomatic incident by this stage , and many people saw Bodyline as damaging to an international relationship that needed to remain strong . The public in both England and Australia reacted with outrage towards the other nation . Alexander Hore @-@ Ruthven , the Governor of South Australia , who was in England at the time , expressed his concern to J. H. Thomas , the British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs that this would cause a significant impact on trade between the nations . The standoff was settled only when Australian Prime Minister Joseph Lyons met members of the Australian Board and outlined to them the severe economic hardships that could be caused in Australia if the British public boycotted Australian trade . Given this understanding , the Board withdrew the allegation of unsportsmanlike behaviour two days before the fourth Test , thus saving the tour . However , correspondence continued for almost a year . Fingleton was dropped after scoring a pair in the third Test , and England won the final two matches to win the series 4 – 1 . 
 = Greco @-@ Persian Wars = 
 The Greco @-@ Persian Wars ( also often called the Persian Wars ) were a series of conflicts between the Achaemenid Empire of Persia ( modern @-@ day Iran ) and Greek city @-@ states that started in 499 BC and lasted until 449 BC . The collision between the fractious political world of the Greeks and the enormous empire of the Persians began when Cyrus the Great conquered the Greek @-@ inhabited region of Ionia in 547 BC . Struggling to rule the independent @-@ minded cities of Ionia , the Persians appointed tyrants to rule each of them . This would prove to be the source of much trouble for the Greeks and Persians alike . 
 In 499 BC , the tyrant of Miletus , Aristagoras , embarked on an expedition to conquer the island of Naxos , with Persian support ; however , the expedition was a debacle and , pre @-@ empting his dismissal , Aristagoras incited all of Hellenic Asia Minor into rebellion against the Persians . This was the beginning of the Ionian Revolt , which would last until 493 BC , progressively drawing more regions of Asia Minor into the conflict . Aristagoras secured military support from Athens and Eretria , and in 498 BC these forces helped to capture and burn the Persian regional capital of Sardis . The Persian king Darius the Great vowed to have revenge on Athens and Eretria for this act . The revolt continued , with the two sides effectively stalemated throughout 497 – 495 BC . In 494 BC , the Persians regrouped , and attacked the epicentre of the revolt in Miletus . At the Battle of Lade , the Ionians suffered a decisive defeat , and the rebellion collapsed , with the final members being stamped out the following year . 
 Seeking to secure his empire from further revolts and from the interference of the mainland Greeks , Darius embarked on a scheme to conquer Greece and to punish Athens and Eretria for the burning of Sardis . The first Persian invasion of Greece began in 492 BC , with the Persian general Mardonius successfully re @-@ subjugating Thrace and conquering Macedon before several mishaps forced an early end to the rest of the campaign . In 490 BC a second force was sent to Greece , this time across the Aegean Sea , under the command of Datis and Artaphernes . This expedition subjugated the Cyclades , before besieging , capturing and razing Eretria . However , while en route to attack Athens , the Persian force was decisively defeated by the Athenians at the Battle of Marathon , ending Persian efforts for the time being . 
 Darius then began to plan to completely conquer Greece , but died in 486 BC and responsibility for the conquest passed to his son Xerxes . In 480 BC , Xerxes personally led the second Persian invasion of Greece with one of the largest ancient armies ever assembled . Victory over the Allied Greek states at the famous Battle of Thermopylae allowed the Persians to torch an evacuated Athens and overrun most of Greece . However , while seeking to destroy the combined Greek fleet , the Persians suffered a severe defeat at the Battle of Salamis . The following year , the confederated Greeks went on the offensive , defeating the Persian army at the Battle of Plataea , and ending the invasion of Greece . 
 The allied Greeks followed up their success by destroying the rest of the Persian fleet at the Battle of Mycale , before expelling Persian garrisons from Sestos ( 479 BC ) and Byzantium ( 478 BC ) . The actions of the general Pausanias at the siege of Byzantium alienated many of the Greek states from the Spartans , and the anti @-@ Persian alliance was therefore reconstituted around Athenian leadership , called the Delian League . The Delian League continued to campaign against Persia for the next three decades , beginning with the expulsion of the remaining Persian garrisons from Europe . At the Battle of the Eurymedon in 466 BC , the League won a double victory that finally secured freedom for the cities of Ionia . However , the League 's involvement in an Egyptian revolt ( from 460 – 454 BC ) resulted in a disastrous defeat , and further campaigning was suspended . A fleet was sent to Cyprus in 451 BC , but achieved little , and when it withdrew the Greco @-@ Persian Wars drew to a quiet end . Some historical sources suggest the end of hostilities was marked by a peace treaty between Athens and Persia , the so @-@ called Peace of Callias . 
 = = Origins of the conflict = = 
 The Greeks of the classical period believed that , in the dark age that followed the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization , significant numbers of Greeks fled and had emigrated to Asia Minor and settled there . Modern historians generally accept this migration as historic ( but separate from the later colonization of the Mediterranean by the Greeks ) . There are , however , those who believe the Ionian migration cannot be explained as simply as the classical Greeks claimed . These settlers were from three tribal groups : the Aeolians , Dorians and Ionians . The Ionians had settled about the coasts of Lydia and Caria , founding the twelve cities that made up Ionia . These cities were Miletus , Myus and Priene in Caria ; Ephesus , Colophon , Lebedos , Teos , Clazomenae , Phocaea and Erythrae in Lydia ; and the islands of Samos and Chios . Although the Ionian cities were independent of one another , they recognized their shared heritage and supposedly had a common temple and meeting place , the <unk> . They thus formed a ' cultural league ' , to which they would admit no other cities , or even other tribal Ionians . 
 The cities of Ionia remained independent until they were conquered by the Lydians of western Asia Minor . The Lydian king <unk> II attacked Miletus , a conflict that ended with a treaty of alliance between Miletus and Lydia , that meant that Miletus would have internal autonomy but follow Lydia in foreign affairs . At this time , the Lydians were also in conflict with the Median Empire , and the Milesians sent an army to aid the Lydians in this conflict . Eventually a peaceable settlement was established between the Medes and the Lydians , with the Halys River set up as the border between the kingdoms . The famous Lydian king Croesus succeeded his father <unk> in around 560 BC and set about conquering the other Greek city states of Asia Minor . 
 The Persian prince Cyrus led a rebellion against the last Median king <unk> in 553 BC . Cyrus was a grandson of <unk> and was supported by part of the Median aristocracy . By 550 BC , the rebellion was over , and Cyrus had emerged victorious , founding the Achaemenid Empire in place of the Median kingdom in the process . Croesus saw the disruption in the Median Empire and Persia as an opportunity to extend his realm and asked the oracle of Delphi whether he should attack them . The Oracle supposedly replied the famously ambiguous answer that " if Croesus was to cross the Halys he would destroy a great empire " . Blind to the ambiguity of this prophecy , Croesus attacked the Persians , but was eventually defeated and Lydia fell to Cyrus . By crossing the Halys , Croesus had indeed destroyed a great empire - his own . 
 While fighting the Lydians , Cyrus had sent messages to the Ionians asking them to revolt against Lydian rule , which the Ionians had refused to do . After Cyrus finished the conquest of Lydia , the Ionian cities now offered to be his subjects under the same terms as they had been subjects of Croesus . Cyrus refused , citing the Ionians ' unwillingness to help him previously . The Ionians thus prepared to defend themselves , and Cyrus sent the Median general Harpagus to conquer them . He first attacked Phocaea ; the <unk> decided to abandon their city entirely and sail into exile in Sicily , rather than become Persian subjects ( although many later returned ) . Some <unk> also chose to emigrate when Harpagus attacked Teos , but the rest of the Ionians remained , and were each in turn conquered . 
 In the years following their conquest , the Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule . Elsewhere in the empire , Cyrus identified elite native groups such as the priesthood of Judea – to help him rule his new subjects . No such group existed in Greek cities at this time ; while there was usually an aristocracy , this was inevitably divided into feuding factions . The Persians thus settled for sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city , even though this drew them into the Ionians ' internal conflicts . Furthermore , certain tyrants might develop an independent streak and have to be replaced . The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task ; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens ' hatred , while staying in the favour of the Persians . In the past , Greek states had often been ruled by tyrants , but that form of government was on the decline . Past tyrants had also tended and needed to be strong and able leaders , whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply place @-@ men . Backed by the Persian military might , these tyrants did not need the support of the population , and could thus rule absolutely . On the eve of the Greco @-@ Persian wars , it is probable that the Ionian population had become discontent and was ready for rebellion . 
 = = = Warfare in the ancient Mediterranean = = = 
 In the Greco @-@ Persian wars both sides made use of spear @-@ armed infantry and light missile troops . Greek armies placed the emphasis on heavier infantry , while Persian armies favoured lighter troop types . 
 = = = = Persia = = = = 
 The Persian military consisted of a diverse group of men drawn across the various nations of the empire . However , according to Herodotus , there was at least a general conformity in armour and style of fighting . The troops were usually armed with a bow , a ' short spear ' and a sword or axe , carried a wicker shield . They wore a leather jerkin , although individuals of high stature wore high quality metal armor . The Persians most likely used their bows to wear down the enemy , then closed in to deliver the final blow with spears and swords . The first rank of Persian infantry formations , the so @-@ called ' <unk> ' , had no bows , carried larger wicker shields and were sometimes armed with longer spears . Their role was to protect the back ranks of the formation . The cavalry probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry . 
 = = = = Greece = = = = 
 The style of warfare between the Greek city @-@ states , which dates back until at least 650 BC ( as dated by the ' Chigi vase ' ) , was based around the hoplite phalanx supported by missile troops . The ' hoplites ' were foot soldiers usually drawn from the members of the middle @-@ classes ( in Athens called the zeugites ) , who could afford the equipment necessary to fight in this manner . The heavy armour usually included a breastplate or a <unk> , greaves , a helmet , and a large round , concave shield ( the aspis or <unk> ) . Hoplites were armed with long spears ( the dory ) , which were significantly longer than Persian spears , and a sword ( the <unk> ) . The heavy armour and longer spears made them superior in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat and gave them significant protection against ranged attacks . Lightly armed skirmishers , the <unk> also comprised a part of Greek armies growing in importance during the conflict ; at the Battle of Plataea , for instance , they may have formed over half the Greek army . Use of cavalry in Greek armies is not reported in the battles of the Greco @-@ Persian Wars . 
 = = = = Naval warfare = = = = 
 At the beginning of the conflict , all naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean had switched to the trireme , a warship powered by three banks of oars . The most common naval tactics during the period were ramming ( Greek triremes were equipped with a cast @-@ bronze ram at the bows ) , or boarding by ship @-@ borne marines . More experienced naval powers had by this time also begun to use a manoeuver known as diekplous . It is not clear what this was , but it probably involved sailing into gaps between enemy ships and then ramming them in the side . 
 The Persian naval forces were primarily provided by the seafaring people of the empire : Phoenicians , Egyptians , Cilicians and Cypriots . Other coastal regions of the Persian Empire would contribute ships throughout the course of the wars . 
 = = Ionian Revolt ( 499 – 493 BC ) = = 
 The Ionian Revolt and associated revolts in Aeolis , Doris , Cyprus , and Caria were military rebellions by several regions of Asia Minor against Persian rule , lasting from 499 to 493 BC . At the heart of the rebellion was the dissatisfaction of the Greek cities of Asia Minor with the tyrants appointed by Persia to rule them , along with opposition to the individual actions of two Milesian tyrants , Histiaeus and Aristagoras . In 499 BC the then tyrant of Miletus , Aristagoras , launched a joint expedition with the Persian satrap Artaphernes to conquer Naxos , in an attempt to bolster his position in Miletus ( both financially and in terms of prestige ) . The mission was a debacle , and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant , Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against the Persian king Darius the Great . 
 Struggling to rule the independent @-@ minded cities of Ionia , the Persians appointed local tyrants to rule each of them . This would prove to be the source of much trouble for the Greeks and Persians alike . In 498 BC , supported by troops from Athens and Eretria , the Ionians marched on , captured , and burnt Sardis . However , on their return journey to Ionia , they were followed by Persian troops , and decisively beaten at the Battle of Ephesus . This campaign was the only offensive action taken by the Ionians , who subsequently went on the defensive . The Persians responded in 497 BC with a three @-@ pronged attack aimed at recapturing the outlying areas of the rebellious territory , but the spread of the revolt to Caria meant the largest army , under Darius , moved there instead . While at first campaigning successfully in Caria , this army was wiped out in an ambush at the Battle of Pedasus . This resulted in a stalemate for the rest of 496 and 495 BC . 
 By 494 BC the Persian army and navy had regrouped , and they made straight for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus . The Ionian fleet sought to defend Miletus by sea , but was defeated decisively at the Battle of Lade , after the Samians had defected . Miletus was then besieged , captured , and its population was enslaved . This double defeat effectively ended the revolt , and the Carians surrendered to the Persians as a result . The Persians spent 493 BC reducing the cities along the west coast that still held out against them , before finally imposing a peace settlement on Ionia that was considered to be both just and fair . 
 The Ionian Revolt constituted the first major conflict between Greece and the Achaemenid Empire and represents the first phase of the Greco @-@ Persian Wars . Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold , but Darius had vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support for the revolt . Moreover , seeing that the political situation in Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his Empire , he decided to embark on the conquest of all Greece . 
 = = First invasion of Greece ( 492 – 490 BC ) = = 
 After having reconquered Ionia , the Persians began to plan their next moves of extinguishing the threat to their empire from Greece ; and punishing Athens and Eretria . The resultant first Persian invasion of Greece consisted of two main campaigns . 
 = = = 492 BC : Mardonius 's campaign = = = 
 The first campaign , in 492 BC , was led by Darius 's son @-@ in @-@ law Mardonius , who re @-@ subjugated Thrace , which had nominally been part of the Persian empire since 513 BC . Mardonius was also able to force Macedon to become a fully subordinate client kingdom of Persia ; it had previously been a vassal , but retained a broad degree of autonomy . However , further progress in this campaign was prevented when Mardonius 's fleet was wrecked in a storm off the coast of Mount Athos . Mardonius himself was then injured in a raid on his camp by a Thracian tribe , and after this he returned with the rest of the expedition to Asia . 
 The following year , having given clear warning of his plans , Darius sent ambassadors to all the cities of Greece , demanding their submission . He received it from almost all of them , except Athens and Sparta , both of whom instead executed the ambassadors . With Athens still defiant , and Sparta now also effectively at war with him , Darius ordered a further military campaign for the following year . 
 = = = 490 BC : Datis and Artaphernes ' campaign = = = 
 In 490 BC , Datis and Artaphernes ( son of the satrap Artaphernes ) were given command of an amphibious invasion force , and set sail from Cilicia . The Persian force sailed from Cilicia first to the island of Rhodes , where a Lindian Temple Chronicle records that Datis besieged the city of Lindos , but was unsuccessful . The fleet sailed next to Naxos , to punish the Naxians for their resistance to the failed expedition the Persians had mounted there a decade earlier . Many of the inhabitants fled to the mountains ; those that the Persians caught were enslaved . The Persians then burnt the city and temples of the Naxians . The fleet then proceeded to island @-@ hop across the rest of the Aegean on its way to Eretria , taking hostages and troops from each island . 
 The task force sailed on to Euboea , and to the first major target , Eretria . The Eretrians made no attempt to stop the Persians from landing or advancing and thus allowed themselves to be besieged . For six days , the Persians attacked the walls , with losses on both sides ; however , on the seventh day two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed the city to the Persians . The city was razed , and temples and shrines were looted and burned . Furthermore , according to Darius 's commands , the Persians enslaved all the remaining townspeople . 
 = = = = Battle of Marathon = = = = 
 The Persian fleet next headed south down the coast of Attica , landing at the bay of Marathon , roughly 25 miles ( 40 km ) from Athens Under the guidance of Miltiades , the general with the greatest experience of fighting the Persians , the Athenian army marched to block the two exits from the plain of Marathon . Stalemate ensued for five days , before the Persians decided to continue onward to Athens , and began to load their troops back onto the ships . After the Persians had loaded their cavalry ( their strongest soldiers ) on the ships , the 10 @,@ 000 Athenian soldiers descended from the hills around the plain . The Greeks crushed the weaker Persian foot soldiers by routing the wings before turning towards the centre of the Persian line . The remnants of the Persian army fled to their ships and left the battle . Herodotus records that 6 @,@ 400 Persian bodies were counted on the battlefield ; the Athenians lost only 192 men . 
 As soon as the Persian survivors had put to sea , the Athenians marched as quickly as possible to Athens . They arrived in time to prevent Artaphernes from securing a landing in Athens . Seeing his opportunity lost , Artaphernes ended the year 's campaign and returned to Asia . 
 The Battle of Marathon was a watershed in the Greco @-@ Persian wars , showing the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten . It also highlighted the superiority of the more heavily armoured Greek hoplites , and showed their potential when used wisely . 
 = = Interbellum ( 490 – 480 BC ) = = 
 = = = Achaemenid Empire = = = 
 After the failure of the first invasion , Darius began raising a huge new army with which he intended to subjugate Greece completely . However , in 486 BC , his Egyptian subjects revolted , and the revolt forced an indefinite postponement of any Greek expedition . Darius died while preparing to march on Egypt , and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt , and very quickly resumed the preparations for the invasion of Greece . Since this was to be a full @-@ scale invasion , it needed longterm planning , stockpiling and conscription . Xerxes decided that the Hellespont would be bridged to allow his army to cross to Europe , and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of Mount Athos ( a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC while rounding this coastline ) . These were both feats of exceptional ambition that would have been beyond the capabilities of any other contemporary state . However , the campaign was delayed by one year because of another revolt in Egypt and Babylonia . 
 The Persians had the sympathy of several Greek city @-@ states , including Argos , which had pledged to defect when the Persians reached their borders . The <unk> family , who ruled Larissa in Thessaly , saw the invasion as an opportunity to extend their power . Thebes , though not explicitly ' <unk> ' , was suspected of being willing to aid the Persians once the invasion force arrived . 
 In 481 BC , after roughly four years of preparation , Xerxes began to muster the troops to invade Europe . Herodotus gives the names of 46 nations from which troops were drafted . The Persian army was gathered in Asia Minor in the summer and autumn of 481 BC . The armies from the Eastern satrapies were gathered in <unk> , Cappadocia and were led by Xerxes to Sardis where they passed the winter . Early in spring , it moved to Abydos where it was joined with the armies of the western satrapies . Then the army that Xerxes had mustered marched towards Europe , crossing the Hellespont on two pontoon bridges . 
 = = = = Size of the Persian forces = = = = 
 The numbers of troops that Xerxes mustered for the second invasion of Greece have been the subject of endless dispute . Most modern scholars reject as unrealistic the figures of 2 @.@ 5 million given by Herodotus and other ancient sources because the victors likely miscalculated or exaggerated . The topic has been hotly debated , but the consensus revolves around the figure of 200 @,@ 000 . 
 The size of the Persian fleet is also disputed , although perhaps less so . Other ancient authors agree with Herodotus ' number of 1 @,@ 207 . These numbers are by ancient standards consistent , and this could be interpreted that a number around 1 @,@ 200 is correct . Among modern scholars , some have accepted this number , although suggesting the number must have been lower by the Battle of Salamis . Other recent works on the Persian Wars reject this number , viewing 1 @,@ 207 as more of a reference to the combined Greek fleet in the Iliad . These works generally claim that the Persians could have launched no more than around 600 warships into the Aegean . 
 = = = Greek city states = = =

 A year after Marathon , Miltiades , the hero of Marathon , was injured in a military campaign to Paros . Taking advantage of his incapacitation , the powerful Alcmaeonid family arranged for him to be prosecuted for the failure of the campaign . A huge fine was imposed on Miltiades for the crime of ' deceiving the Athenian people ' , but he died weeks later from his wound . 
 The politician Themistocles , with a power base firmly established amongst the poor , filled the vacuum left by Miltiades 's death , and in the following decade became the most influential politician in Athens . During this period , Themistocles continued to support the expansion of Athens ' naval power . The Athenians were aware throughout this period that the Persian interest in Greece had not ended , and Themistocles 's naval policies may be seen in the light of the potential threat from Persia . Aristides , Themistocles 's great rival , and champion of the zeugites ( the ' upper hoplite @-@ class ' ) vigorously opposed such a policy . 
 In 483 BC , a vast new seam of silver was found in the Athenian mines at Laurium . Themistocles proposed that the silver should be used to build a new fleet of triremes , ostensibly to assist in a long running war with Aegina . Plutarch suggests that Themistocles deliberately avoided mentioning Persia , believing that it was too distant a threat for the Athenians to act on , but that countering Persia was the fleet 's aim . Fine suggests that many Athenians must have admitted that such a fleet would be needed to resist the Persians , whose preparations for the coming campaign were known . Themistocles 's motion was passed easily , despite strong opposition from Aristides . Its passage was probably due to the desire of many of the poorer Athenians for paid employment as rowers in the fleet . It is unclear from the ancient sources whether 100 or 200 ships were initially authorised ; both Fine and Holland suggest that at first 100 ships were authorised and that a second vote increased this number to the levels seen during the second invasion . Aristides continued to oppose Themistocles 's policy , and tension between the two camps built over the winter , so the ostracism of 482 BC became a direct contest between Themistocles and Aristides . In what Holland characterises as , in essence , the world 's first referendum , Aristides was ostracised , and Themistocles 's policies were endorsed . Indeed , becoming aware of the Persian preparations for the coming invasion , the Athenians voted to build more ships than those for which Themistocles had asked . Thus , during the preparations for the Persian invasion , Themistocles had become the leading politician in Athens . 
 = = = = Sparta = = = = 
 The Spartan king Demaratus had been stripped of his kingship in 491 BC , and replaced with his cousin Leotychides . Sometime after 490 BC , the humiliated Demaratus had chosen to go into exile , and had made his way to Darius 's court in Susa . Demaratus would from then on act as an advisor to Darius , and later Xerxes , on Greek affairs , and accompanied Xerxes during the second Persian invasion . At the end of Herodotus 's book 7 , there is an anecdote relating that prior to the second invasion , Demaratus sent an apparently blank wax tablet to Sparta . When the wax was removed , a message was found scratched on the wooden backing , warning the Spartans of Xerxes 's plans . However , many historians believe that this chapter was inserted into the text by a later author , possibly to fill a gap between the end of book 7 and the start of book 8 . The veracity of this anecdote is therefore unclear . 
 = = = = Hellenic alliance = = = = 
 In 481 BC , Xerxes sent ambassadors to city states throughout Greece , asking for food , land , and water as tokens of their submission to Persia . However , Xerxes ' ambassadors deliberately avoided Athens and Sparta , hoping thereby that those states would not learn of the Persians ' plans . States that were opposed to Persia thus began to coalesce around these two city states . A congress of states met at Corinth in late autumn of 481 BC , and a confederate alliance of Greek city @-@ states was formed . This confederation had powers both to send envoys to ask for assistance and to dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points after joint consultation . Herodotus does not formulate an abstract name for the union but simply calls them " οἱ Ἕλληνες " ( the Greeks ) and " the Greeks who had sworn alliance " ( Godley translation ) or " the Greeks who had banded themselves together " ( Rawlinson translation ) . From now on , they will be referred to as the ' Allies ' . Sparta and Athens had a leading role in the congress but the interests of all the states influenced defensive strategy . Little is known about the internal workings of the congress or the discussions during its meetings . Only 70 of the nearly 700 Greek city @-@ states sent representatives . Nevertheless , this was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world , especially since many of the city @-@ states present were still technically at war with one another . 
 = = Second invasion of Greece ( 480 – 479 BC ) = = 
 = = = Early 480 BC : Thrace , Macedonia , and Thessaly = = = 
 Having crossed into Europe in April 480 BC , the Persian army began its march to Greece , taking 3 months to travel unopposed from the Hellespont to Therme . It paused at Doriskos where it was joined by the fleet . Xerxes reorganized the troops into tactical units replacing the national formations used earlier for the march . 
 The Allied ' congress ' met again in the spring of 480 BC and agreed to defend the narrow Vale of Tempe on the borders of Thessaly and block Xerxes 's advance . However , once there , they were warned by Alexander I of Macedon that the vale could be bypassed and that the army of Xerxes was overwhelmingly large , thus the Greeks retreated . Shortly afterwards , they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont . At this point , a second strategy was suggested by Themistocles to the allies . The route to southern Greece ( Boeotia , Attica and the Peloponnesus ) would require the army of Xerxes to travel through the narrow pass of Thermopylae . This could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites , despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians . Furthermore , to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea , the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium . This dual strategy was adopted by the congress . However , the Peloponnesian cities made fall @-@ back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it , while the women and children of Athens were evacuated to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen . 
 = = = August 480 BC : Battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium = = = 
 Xerxes 's estimated time of arrival at Thermopylae coincided with both the Olympic Games and the festival of Carneia . For the Spartans , warfare during these periods was considered sacrilegious . Despite the uncomfortable timing , the Spartans considered the threat so grave that they dispatched their king Leonidas I with his personal bodyguard ( the Hippeis ) of 300 men . The customary elite young men in the Hippeis were replaced by veterans who already had children . Leonidas was supported by contingents from the Allied Peloponnesian cities , and other forces that the Allies picked up on the way to Thermopylae . The Allies proceeded to occupy the pass , rebuilt the wall the Phocians had built at the narrowest point of the pass , and waited for Xerxes 's arrival . 
 When the Persians arrived at Thermopylae in mid @-@ August , they initially waited for three days for the Allies to disperse . When Xerxes was eventually persuaded that the Allies intended to contest the pass , he sent his troops to attack . However , the Allied position was ideally suited to hoplite warfare , the Persian contingents being forced to attack the Greek phalanx head on . The Allies withstood two full days of Persian attacks , including those by the elite Persian Immortals . However , towards the end of the second day , they were betrayed by a local resident named Ephialtes who revealed to Xerxes a mountain path that led behind the Allied lines . Made aware by scouts that they were being outflanked , Leonidas dismissed most of the Allied army , remaining to guard the rear with perhaps 2 @,@ 000 men . On the final day of the battle , the remaining Allies sallied forth from the wall to meet the Persians in the wider part of the pass to slaughter as many Persians as they could , but eventually they were all killed or captured . 
 Simultaneous with the battle at Thermopylae , an Allied naval force of 271 triremes defended the Straits of Artemisium against the Persians , thus protecting the flank of the forces at Thermopylae . Here the Allied fleet held off the Persians for three days ; however , on the third evening the Allies received news of the fate of Leonidas and the Allied troops at Thermopylae . Since the Allied fleet was badly damaged , and since it no longer needed to defend the flank of Thermopylae , the Allies retreated from Artemisium to the island of Salamis . 
 = = = September 480 BC : Battle of Salamis = = = 
 Victory at Thermopylae meant that all Boeotia fell to Xerxes ; Attica was then open to invasion . The remaining population of Athens was evacuated , with the aid of the Allied fleet , to Salamis . The Peloponnesian Allies began to prepare a defensive line across the Isthmus of Corinth , building a wall , and demolishing the road from Megara , abandoning Athens to the Persians . Athens thus fell to the Persians ; the small number of Athenians who had barricaded themselves on the Acropolis were eventually defeated , and Xerxes then ordered Athens to be razed . 
 The Persians had now captured most of Greece , but Xerxes had perhaps not expected such defiance ; his priority was now to complete the war as quickly as possible . If Xerxes could destroy the Allied navy , he would be in a strong position to force an Allied surrender ; conversely by avoiding destruction , or as Themistocles hoped , by destroying the Persian fleet , the Allies could prevent conquest from being completed . The Allied fleet thus remained off the coast of Salamis into September , despite the imminent arrival of the Persians . Even after Athens fell , the Allied fleet remained off the coast of Salamis , trying to lure the Persian fleet to battle . Partly because of deception by Themistocles , the navies met in the cramped Straits of Salamis . There , the Persian numbers became a hindrance , as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganised . Seizing the opportunity , the Allied fleet attacked , and scored a decisive victory , sinking or capturing at least 200 Persian ships , therefore ensuring the safety of the <unk> . 
 According to Herodotus , after the loss of the battle Xerxes attempted to build a causeway across the channel to attack the Athenian evacuees on Salamis , but this project was soon abandoned . With the Persians ' naval superiority removed , Xerxes feared that the Allies might sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges . His general Mardonius volunteered to remain in Greece and complete the conquest with a hand @-@ picked group of troops , while Xerxes retreated to Asia with the bulk of the army . Mardonius over @-@ wintered in Boeotia and Thessaly ; the Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt @-@ out city for the winter . 
 = = = June 479 BC : Battles of Plataea and Mycale = = = 
 Over the winter , there was some tension among the Allies . In particular , the Athenians , who were not protected by the Isthmus , but whose fleet was the key to the security of the Peloponnesus , felt that they had been treated unfairly , and so they refused to join the Allied navy in the spring . Mardonius remained in Thessaly , knowing an attack on the Isthmus was pointless , while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus . Mardonius moved to break the stalemate , by offering peace to the Athenians , using Alexander I of Macedon as an intermediate . The Athenians made sure that a Spartan delegation was on hand to hear the Athenians reject the Persians ' offer . Athens was thus evacuated again , and the Persians marched south and re @-@ took possession of it . Mardonius now repeated his offer of peace to the Athenian refugees on Salamis . Athens , with Megara and Plataea , sent emissaries to Sparta demanding assistance , and threatening to accept the Persian terms if they were not aided . In response , the Spartans summoned a large army from the Peloponnese cities and marched to meet the Persians . 
 When Mardonius heard the Allied army was on the march , he retreated into Boeotia , near Plataea , trying to draw the Allies into open terrain where he could use his cavalry . The Allied army , under the command of the regent Pausanias , stayed on high ground above Plataea to protect themselves against such tactics . After several days of maneuver and stalemate , Pausanias ordered a night @-@ time retreat towards the Allies ' original positions . This maneuver went awry , leaving the Athenians , and Spartans and Tegeans isolated on separate hills , with the other contingents scattered further away near Plataea . Seeing that the Persians might never have a better opportunity to attack , Mardonius ordered his whole army forward . However , the Persian infantry proved no match for the heavily armoured Greek hoplites , and the Spartans broke through to Mardonius 's bodyguard and killed him . After this the Persian force dissolved in rout ; 40 @,@ 000 troops managed to escape via the road to Thessaly , but the rest fled to the Persian camp where they were trapped and slaughtered by the Greeks , finalising the Greek victory . 
 Herodotus recounts that , on the afternoon of the Battle of Plataea , a rumour of their victory at that battle reached the Allies ' navy , at that time off the coast of Mount Mycale in Ionia . Their morale boosted , the Allied marines fought and won a decisive victory at the Battle of Mycale that same day , destroying the remnants of the Persian fleet , crippling Xerxes 's sea power , and marking the ascendancy of the Greek fleet . Whilst many modern historians doubt that Mycale took place on the same day as Plataea , the battle may well only have occurred once the Allies received news of the events unfolding in Greece . 
 = = Greek counterattack ( 479 – 478 BC ) = = 
 = = = Mycale and Ionia = = = 
 Mycale was , in many ways , the beginning of a new phase in the conflict , in which the Greeks would go on the offensive against the Persians . The immediate result of the victory at Mycale was a second revolt amongst the Greek cities of Asia Minor . The Samians and Milesians had actively fought against the Persians at Mycale , thus openly declaring their rebellion , and the other cities followed in their example . 
 = = = Sestos = = = 
 Shortly after Mycale , the Allied fleet sailed to the Hellespont to break down the pontoon bridges , but found that this had already been done . The Peloponnesians sailed home , but the Athenians remained to attack the Chersonesos , still held by the Persians . The Persians and their allies made for Sestos , the strongest town in the region . Amongst them was one Oeobazus of Cardia , who had with him the cables and other equipment from the pontoon bridges . The Persian governor , Artayctes had not prepared for a siege , not believing that the Allies would attack . The Athenians therefore were able to lay a siege around Sestos . The siege dragged on for several months , causing some discontent amongst the Athenian troops , but eventually , when the food ran out in the City , the Persians fled at night from the least guarded area of the city . The Athenians were thus able to take possession of the city the next day . 
 Most of the Athenian troops were sent straight away to pursue the Persians . The party of Oeobazus was captured by a Thracian tribe , and Oeobazus was sacrificed to the god <unk> . The Athenians eventually caught Artayctes , killing some of the Persians with him but taking most of them , including Artayctes , captive . Artayctes was crucified at the request of the people of Elaeus , a town which Artayctes had plundered while governor of the Chersonesos . The Athenians , having pacified the region , then sailed back to Athens , taking the cables from the pontoon bridges with them as trophies .

 In 478 BC , still operating under the terms of the Hellenic alliance , the Allies sent out a fleet composed of 20 Peloponnesian and 30 Athenian ships supported by an unspecified number of allies , under the overall command of Pausanias . According to Thucydides , this fleet sailed to Cyprus and " subdued most of the island " . Exactly what Thucydides means by this is unclear . Sealey suggests that this was essentially a raid to gather as much treasure as possible from the Persian garrisons on Cyprus . There is no indication that the Allies attempted to take possession of the island , and , shortly after , they sailed to Byzantium . Certainly , the fact that the Delian League repeatedly campaigned in Cyprus suggests either that the island was not garrisoned by the Allies in 478 BC , or that the garrisons were quickly expelled . 
 = = = Byzantium = = = 
 The Greek fleet then sailed to Byzantium , which they besieged and eventually captured . Control of both Sestos and Byzantium gave the allies command of the straits between Europe and Asia ( over which the Persians had crossed ) , and allowed them access to the merchant trade of the Black Sea . 
 The aftermath of the siege was to prove troublesome for Pausanias . Exactly what happened is unclear ; Thucydides gives few details , although later writers added plenty of lurid insinuations . Through his arrogance and arbitrary actions ( Thucydides says " violence " ) , Pausanias managed to alienate many of the Allied contingents , particularly those that had just been freed from Persian overlordship . The Ionians and others asked the Athenians to take leadership of the campaign , to which they agreed . The Spartans , hearing of his behaviour , recalled Pausanias and tried him on charges of collaborating with the enemy . Although he was acquitted , his reputation was tarnished and he was not restored to his command . 
 Pausanias returned to Byzantium as a private citizen in 477 BC , and took command of the city until he was expelled by the Athenians . He then crossed the Bosporus and settled in <unk> in the Troad , until he was again accused of collaborating with the Persians and was recalled by the Spartans for a trial after which he starved himself to death . The timescale is unclear , but Pausanias may have remained in possession of Byzantium until 470 BC . 
 In the meantime , the Spartans had sent <unk> to Byzantium with a small force , to take command of the Allied force . However , he found that the rest of the Allies were no longer prepared to accept Spartan leadership , and therefore returned home . 
 = = Wars of the Delian League ( 477 – 449 BC ) = = 
 = = = Delian League = = = 
 After Byzantium , the Spartans were allegedly eager to end their involvement in the war . The Spartans were supposedly of the view that , with the liberation of mainland Greece and the Greek cities of Asia Minor , the war 's purpose had already been reached . There was also perhaps a feeling that securing long @-@ term security for the Asian Greeks would prove impossible . In the aftermath of Mycale , the Spartan king Leotychides had proposed transplanting all the Greeks from Asia Minor to Europe as the only method of permanently freeing them from Persian dominion . Xanthippus , the Athenian commander at Mycale , had furiously rejected this ; the Ionian cities were originally Athenian colonies , and the Athenians , if no @-@ one else , would protect the Ionians . This marks the point at which the leadership of the Greek Alliance effectively passed to the Athenians . With the Spartan withdrawal after Byzantium , the leadership of the Athenians became explicit . 
 The loose alliance of city @-@ states that had fought against Xerxes 's invasion had been dominated by Sparta and the Peloponnesian league . With the withdrawal of these states , a congress was called on the holy island of Delos to institute a new alliance to continue the fight against the Persians . This alliance , now including many of the Aegean islands , was formally constituted as the ' First Athenian Alliance ' , commonly known as the Delian League . According to Thucydides , the official aim of the League was to " avenge the wrongs they suffered by ravaging the territory of the king " . In reality , this goal was divided into three main efforts — to prepare for future invasion , to seek revenge against Persia , and to organize a means of dividing spoils of war . The members were given a choice of either supplying armed forces or paying a tax to the joint treasury ; most states chose the tax . 
 = = = Campaigns against Persia = = = 
 Throughout the 470s BC , the Delian League campaigned in Thrace and the Aegean to remove the remaining Persian garrisons from the region , primarily under the command of the Athenian politician Cimon . In the early part of the next decade , Cimon began campaigning in Asia Minor , seeking to strengthen the Greek position there . At the Battle of the Eurymedon in Pamphylia , the Athenians and allied fleet achieved a stunning double victory , destroying a Persian fleet and then landing the ships ' marines to attack and rout the Persian army . After this battle , the Persians took an essentially passive role in the conflict , anxious not to risk battle if possible . 
 Towards the end of the 460s BC , the Athenians took the ambitious decision to support a revolt in the Egyptian satrapy of the Persian empire . Although the Greek task force achieved initial successes , they were unable to capture the Persian garrison in Memphis , despite a 3 @-@ year long siege . The Persians then counterattacked , and the Athenian force was itself besieged for 18 months , before being wiped out . This disaster , coupled with ongoing warfare in Greece , dissuaded the Athenians from resuming conflict with Persia . In 451 BC however , a truce was agreed in Greece , and Cimon was then able to lead an expedition to Cyprus . However , while besieging Kition , Cimon died , and the Athenian force decided to withdraw , winning another double victory at the Battle of Salamis @-@ in @-@ Cyprus in order to extricate themselves . This campaign marked the end of hostilities between the Delian League and Persia , and therefore the end of the Greco @-@ Persian Wars . 
 = = Peace with Persia = = 
 After the Battle of Salamis @-@ in @-@ Cyprus , Thucydides makes no further mention of conflict with the Persians , saying that the Greeks simply returned home . Diodorus , on the other hand , claims that in the aftermath of Salamis , a full @-@ blown peace treaty ( the " Peace of Callias " ) was agreed with the Persians . Diodorus was probably following the history of Ephorus at this point , who in turn was presumably influenced by his teacher Isocrates — from whom there is the earliest reference to the supposed peace , in 380 BC . Even during the 4th century BC , the idea of the treaty was controversial , and two authors from that period , Callisthenes and Theopompus , appear to reject its existence . 
 It is possible that the Athenians had attempted to negotiate with the Persians previously . Plutarch suggests that in the aftermath of the victory at the Eurymedon , Artaxerxes had agreed a peace treaty with the Greeks , even naming Callias as the Athenian ambassador involved . However , as Plutarch admits , Callisthenes denied that such a peace was made at this point ( c . 466 BC ) . Herodotus also mentions , in passing , an Athenian embassy headed by Callias , which was sent to Susa to negotiate with Artaxerxes . This embassy included some Argive representatives and can probably be therefore dated to c . 461 BC ( after an alliance was agreed between Athens and Argos ) . This embassy may have been an attempt to reach some kind of peace agreement , and it has even been suggested that the failure of these hypothetical negotiations led to the Athenian decision to support the Egyptian revolt . The ancient sources therefore disagree as to whether there was an official peace or not , and , if there was , when it was agreed . 
 Opinion amongst modern historians is also split ; for instance , Fine accepts the concept of the Peace of Callias , whereas Sealey effectively rejects it . Holland accepts that some kind of accommodation was made between Athens and Persia , but no actual treaty . Fine argues that Callisthenes 's denial that a treaty was made after the Eurymedon does not preclude a peace being made at another point . Further , he suggests that Theopompus was actually referring to a treaty that had allegedly been negotiated with Persia in 423 BC . If these views are correct , it would remove one major obstacle to the acceptance of the treaty 's existence . A further argument for the existence of the treaty is the sudden withdrawal of the Athenians from Cyprus in 449 BC , which Fine suggests makes most sense in the light of some kind of peace agreement . On the other hand , if there was indeed some kind of accommodation , Thucydides 's failure to mention it is odd . In his digression on the <unk> , his aim is to explain the growth of Athenian power , and such a treaty , and the fact that the Delian allies were not released from their obligations after it , would have marked a major step in the Athenian ascendancy . Conversely , it has been suggested that certain passages elsewhere in Thucydides 's history are best interpreted as referring to a peace agreement . There is thus no clear consensus amongst modern historians as to the treaty 's existence . 
 The ancient sources that give details of the treaty are reasonably consistent in their description of the terms : 
 All Greek cities of Asia were to ' live by their own laws ' or ' be autonomous ' ( depending on translation ) . 
 Persian satraps ( and presumably their armies ) were not to travel west of the Halys River ( Isocrates ) or closer than a day 's journey on horseback to the Aegean Sea ( Callisthenes ) or closer than three days ' journey on foot to the Aegean Sea ( Ephorus and Diodorus ) . 
 No Persian warship was to sail west of Phaselis ( on the southern coast of Asia Minor ) , nor west of the <unk> rocks ( probably at the eastern end of the Bosporus , on the north coast ) . 
 If the terms were observed by the king and his generals , then the Athenians were not to send troops to lands ruled by Persia . 
 From the Persian perspective , such terms would not be so humiliating as they might at first seem . The Persians already allowed the Greek cities of Asia to be governed under their own laws ( under the reorganization conducted by Artaphernes , following the Ionian Revolt ) . By these terms , the Ionians were still Persian subjects , as they had been . Furthermore , Athens had already demonstrated their superiority at sea at the Eurymedon and Salamis @-@ in @-@ Cyprus , so any legal limitations for the Persian fleet were nothing more than " de jure " recognition of military realities . In exchange for limiting the movement of Persian troops in one region of the realm , Artaxerxes secured a promise from the Athenians to stay out of his entire realm . 
 = = Aftermath and later conflicts = = 
 Towards the end of the conflict with Persia , the process by which the Delian League became the Athenian Empire reached its conclusion . The allies of Athens were not released from their obligations to provide either money or ships , despite the cessation of hostilities . In Greece , the First Peloponnesian War between the power @-@ blocs of Athens and Sparta , which had continued on / off since 460 BC , finally ended in 445 BC , with the agreement of a thirty @-@ year truce . However , the growing enmity between Sparta and Athens would lead , just 14 years later , into the outbreak of the Second Peloponnesian War . This disastrous conflict , which dragged on for 27 years , would eventually result in the utter destruction of Athenian power , the dismemberment of the Athenian empire , and the establishment of a Spartan hegemony over Greece . However , not just Athens suffered — the conflict would significantly weaken the whole of Greece . 
 Repeatedly defeated in battle by the Greeks , and plagued by internal rebellions that hindered their ability to fight the Greeks , after 449 BC Artaxerxes I and his successors instead adopted a policy of divide @-@ and @-@ rule . Avoiding fighting the Greeks themselves , the Persians instead attempted to set Athens against Sparta , regularly bribing politicians to achieve their aims . In this way , they ensured that the Greeks remained distracted by internal conflicts , and were unable to turn their attentions to Persia . There was no open conflict between the Greeks and Persia until 396 BC , when the Spartan king Agesilaus briefly invaded Asia Minor ; as Plutarch points out , the Greeks were far too busy overseeing the destruction of their own power to fight against the " barbarians " . 
 If the wars of the Delian League shifted the balance of power between Greece and Persia in favour of the Greeks , then the subsequent half @-@ century of internecine conflict in Greece did much to restore the balance of power to Persia . The Persians entered the Peloponnesian War in 411 BC forming a mutual @-@ defence pact with Sparta and combining their naval resources against Athens in exchange for sole Persian control of Ionia . In 404 BC when Cyrus the Younger attempted to seize the Persian throne , he recruited 13 @,@ 000 Greek mercenaries from all over the Greek world , of which Sparta sent 700 – 800 , believing they were following the terms of the defence pact and unaware of the army 's true purpose . After the failure of Cyrus , Persia tried to regain control of the Ionian city @-@ states , which had rebelled during the conflict . The Ionians refused to capitulate and called upon Sparta for assistance , which she provided , in 396 – 395 BC . Athens , however , sided with the Persians , which led in turn to another large @-@ scale conflict in Greece , the Corinthian War . Towards the end of that conflict , in 387 BC , Sparta sought the aid of Persia to shore up her position . Under the so @-@ called " King 's Peace " that brought the war to an end , Artaxerxes II demanded and received the return of the cities of Asia Minor from the Spartans , in return for which the Persians threatened to make war on any Greek state that did not make peace . This humiliating treaty , which undid all the Greek gains of the previous century , sacrificed the Greeks of Asia Minor so that the Spartans could maintain their hegemony over Greece . It is in the aftermath of this treaty that Greek orators began to refer to the Peace of Callias ( whether fictional or not ) , as a counterpoint to the shame of the King 's Peace , and a glorious example of the " good old days " when the Greeks of the Aegean had been freed from Persian rule by the Delian League .

 " 3 Words " is a song recorded by English singer Cheryl Cole for her 2009 debut studio album of the same name . It was released in the UK and Ireland on 20 December 2009 by Fascination Records and later in 2010 by Universal Music , sometimes serving as the lead single for 3 Words . The uptempo dance @-@ pop song was written by Cole and George Pajon . It was also written and produced by will.i.am who has guest vocals on the song . 3 Words was cited by Cole as her favourite song from the album for being different from what people expected . 
 " 3 Words " was praised by contemporary critics who said it was " a sophisticated love song " and the " standout track " from the album . Its unconventional production abandons the use of ' verse @-@ chorus @-@ verse ' structure instead , opting for a throbbing build up to a climax . The accompanying video , directed by Saam , features the singer in various fashion <unk> often contrasting colour with will.i.am and , paying homage to Madonna . It also makes use of split screen cinematography and camera effects for the transition of scenes . 
 The song was promoted on Cheryl Cole 's Night In . The single was less commercially successful compared to its predecessor " Fight for This Love " but despite not peaking at number one , it went on to become Cole 's second consecutive UK top @-@ five and Irish @-@ top ten hit . It was also a top five hit in Australia and has since been certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association and silver by the British Phonographic Industry . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " 3 Words " is an uptempo dance @-@ pop song which features guest vocals from will.i.am who produced the song as well as , writing the lyrics with Cole and George Pajon . Serving as the opening and title song of Cole 's debut album , the song is written in the key of C ♯ minor with a time signature in common time and a tempo of 129 beats per minute . Noticeably missing is the standard use of a " verse @-@ chorus @-@ verse song structure " . The song 's backing track consists of a sparse yet complex chord progression of C ♯ m , G ♯ m , C ♯ and A major / C ♯ . The production features loops of acoustic guitar with a piano melody to form an " atmospheric love song " in the vocal range of G ♯ 3 to B4 . 
 Critics stated that the " sophisticated love song " is difficult to class by genre because it was " unconventional " , something which Cole agreed when she said , " [ its ] totally different from anything I 've done [ with Girls Aloud ] or liked before " . Some industry critics also noted that " 3 Words " was " unlike many things currently [ at that time ] on radio or being released " . Cole said that the song took its inspiration <unk> her newly acquired love for dance music on the charts , especially David Guetta & Kelly Rowland 's " When Love Takes Over " .

 Cole described it as her favourite song on the album and music critics generally agreed . Tom Ewing of The Guardian called the song Cheryl 's " showcase [ ... ] built on dark loops of treated acoustic guitar and building into a claustrophobic dance track . It 's as brave and novel a song as anything Cole 's group have released . " Daniel Wilcox even went as far as to say the song was " far more interesting and innovative than anything her girl group has done in their entire careers . " " 3 Words " has been described as " mesmerizing in its listlessness " as well as being " unlike anything Cheryl or <unk> have released " and " to what 's currently being played on the radio . " It was labeled a standout track by many reviewers , with Killian Fox of The Observer referring to the song as " a slick , sophisticated love song that hints at what this album could have been . " ( positive ) David Balls of Digital Spy wrote , " <unk> traditional verse @-@ chorus @-@ verse song structure , and beginning with spare acoustic guitar strums , ' 3 Words ' builds slowly towards a throbbing and infectious , if slightly brief , arms @-@ in @-@ the @-@ air climax [ ... ] it 's hard to deny that Chez pulls off this less @-@ than @-@ obvious offering with aplomb . " 
 Louise McCudden of <unk> , however , argued that although " her voice sounds pleasant [ ... ] the song itself is too long and becomes tedious fairly fast . " Vicki Lutas had a mostly negative review for the song saying " at the end of the day it does sound like something you could have made up when you were at school " , though she did praise the backing track for being " dark , eerie and cold in a chilling way ; in an infectious way " . However she pointed out that " the vocal arrangement and the actual vocals themselves do nothing more for the song " , and respected that " it 's a brave song choice , but it 's <unk> @-@ hazard vocal line seems to scream ...

 In the United Kingdom , " 3 Words " made its official debut on the UK Singles Chart at number twenty @-@ six , following strong digital sales from the release of the album , two weeks prior . Then a day before its digital release and two days before its CD release the single climbed to number fourteen . Later during the first week of 2010 it would go on to peak at number four , giving Cole her third consecutive top @-@ five UK hit if her feature on will.i.am 's " Heartbreaker " is included . On 14 May 2010 the single was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) for shipping 200 @,@ 000 copies . 
 The single also achieved top ten success in the Republic of Ireland , where it reached number seven becoming her third consecutive top @-@ ten single . Coincidentally , it is the second song featuring Cole 's vocals to peak at number seven in Ireland , the first being will.i.am 's " Heartbreaker " . Internationally the single peaked top five in Hungary , and Australia . In the latter it performed better than any song Cole released with Girls Aloud beating the previous best entry " Jump " by eighteen places . " 3 Words " is the only song from Cole 's debut album to peak within the top fifty of the Australian Singles Chart and was subsequently certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) for shipping 70 @,@ 000 units . Additionally it peaked at top @-@ ten in Italy . The song debuted at 14 on the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand . It later rose to number 12 , staying in the charts for 12 weeks .

 Cole filmed two music videos for " 3 Words " .

" The second version was the official " split screener " , directed by Saam , that premiered on 27 November 2009 . The video was described as being distinctly different from that of previous single " Fight for This Love " , drawing comparisons to Madonna and Lady Gaga . The overall goal of the video was described as " tell [ ing ] the story of a couple who socialise separately and are both approached by members of the opposite sex . Despite the other person showing a romantic interest in them " . The singers go on to declare each other is ' the love of my life ' and ' through the ups and the downs ... never let go ' .

In the next scene she can be " seen looking wistfully into the distance in a slinky floor @-@ length black dress with brown hair extensions cascading over her shoulders " , whilst in a third scene she is depicted as an " Egyptian goddess " . Each scene incorporates " dance shots interspersed with sequences in which the focus falls on the two stars alone , seemingly searching each other , as it were ... experimenting more with her looks and even taking a chance with Lady Gaga @-@ esque outfits for her dancers , including veils that cover their faces and black leotards .

 The video received mixed to positive reviews from critics who praised Cole 's sense of fashion but cited that the video was unoriginal . Elena Gorgan of Softpedia said " even with all this , she hardly manages to create a strong impression .. , the video fails to break any visual ground , albeit standing on its own as a stylish video . " The Daily Mail agreed saying " [ The story ] which will no doubt be interpreted by fans as an insight into Cheryl 's marriage to footballer Ashley Cole . Cheryl has ditched her street dance gear for a gown fit for a diva along with suitably styled big hair ... But as she teams up with Black Eyed Peas rapper will.i.am is sporting a more feminine look . The net result is , sorry to say it , very regal but a bit on the dull side . " Lisa McGarry of ' Unreality TV ' said the platinum wig was " strange " She also said " if it doesn ’ t look great , at least it looks shocking . " Meanwhile David Balls of ' Digital Spy ' said " [ in ] this glitzy split @-@ screen affair , Cheryl looks effortlessly classy and glam as she transforms into an Egyptian goddess and - with more success than a certain Mrs. B ( Mel B ) back in 2001 [ with " Feels so Good " ] - shows how to wear a blonde wig without looking like you 're on a dirty weekend in the Toon . Perfectly complimenting the song itself , this super @-@ glossy clip also suggests that Cole has a firm eye on global stardom over the next year .

 = Twenty @-@ cent piece ( United States coin ) = 
 The American twenty @-@ cent piece is a coin struck from 1875 to 1878 , but only for collectors in the final two years . Proposed by Nevada Senator John P. Jones , it proved a failure due to confusion with the quarter , to which it was close in both size and value . 
 In 1874 , the newly elected Jones began pressing for a twenty @-@ cent piece , which he stated would alleviate the shortage of small change in the far West . The bill passed Congress , and mint director Henry Linderman ordered pattern coins struck . Linderman eventually decided on an obverse and reverse similar to that of other silver coins . 
 Although the coins have a smooth edge , rather than reeded as with other silver coins , the new piece was close to the size of , and immediately confused with , the quarter . Adding to the bewilderment , the obverse , or " heads " , sides of both coins were almost identical . After the first year , in which over a million were minted , there was little demand , and the denomination was abolished in 1878 . At least a third of the total mintage was later melted by the government . Numismatist Mark Benvenuto called the twenty @-@ cent piece " a chapter of U.S. coinage history that closed almost before it began " . 
 = = Inception and authorization = = 
 A twenty @-@ cent piece had been proposed as early as 1791 , and again in 1806 , but had been rejected . The 1806 bill , introduced by Connecticut Senator Uriah Tracy , sought both a two @-@ cent piece and a " double dime " . It was opposed by mint director Robert Patterson , though his opposition was more to the two @-@ cent piece , which Tracy proposed be struck in billon , low @-@ grade silver that would be difficult to recover when melting the coins . The bill passed the Senate twice , in 1806 and 1807 , but did not pass the House of Representatives . No twenty @-@ cent piece was issued prior to the 1870s , but Americans were familiar with the denomination as the two reales piece struck in Spain , known as a " <unk> " in the United States , passed for twenty cents ( its Spanish colonial equivalent passed for a quarter ) . 
 Several factors converged to make possible a twenty @-@ cent piece in the 1870s . The first was a shortage of small change in the far West , where base @-@ metal coins did not circulate . Government payments in silver and gold had been suspended during the economic chaos caused by the civil war — coins containing precious metal were hoarded except on the Pacific Coast , and did not pass at face value in trade . Although the base @-@ metal nickel was not widely accepted in the far West , the silver half dime had been struck in increasing numbers at the San Francisco Mint until the silver coin , which did not circulate in the East , was abolished by Congress in 1873 . A shortage of small change resulted , especially as half dimes were used in the jewelry trade ; customers complained they could not get full change for an item costing ten cents for which they paid with a quarter . Prices in the West were sometimes in bits ( 121 ⁄ 2 cents , based on the old Spanish colonial real , although those pieces no longer circulated ) , adding to the change problem . Numismatist David Lange states that a shipment of nickels out West could have solved everything , but that they might not have been accepted due to the prejudice against money which did not contain precious metal . 
 A second factor was the anxiety of Congress to see more silver made into coin . This was due to pressure from mining and other interests . The Coinage Act of 1873 ended the practice of allowing silver producers to have their bullion struck into silver dollars and returned to them . Although producers had not deposited much silver in the years before 1873 due to high market prices , former mint director Henry Linderman foresaw that those prices would fall as mines became accessible due to the completion of the transcontinental railroad across the United States , and that the resultant coinage would inflate the currency . He quietly urged Congress to end the practice , which it did . Within a year , silver prices had dropped , and producers tried vainly to deposit bullion at the mints for conversion into legal tender . Mining interests sought other means of selling silver to the government . 
 The third was American interest in aligning its currency with the Latin Monetary Union and to bring its weights for coinage into the metric system . Several times in the 1860s and 1870s , the United States Mint struck pattern coins that were to be used if America joined , in some cases with the equivalent in foreign money struck as part of the design . The twenty @-@ cent piece was to be equivalent to one French franc in that system , and if in proportion to the smaller silver coins being struck , would weigh five grams , a fact which appealed to advocates of the metric system in Congress . Another purpose for a large issue of silver coins , regardless of denomination , was to retire the fractional currency — low @-@ value paper money or " shinplasters " . Congress passed legislation in 1875 and 1876 for large quantities of silver coins for this purpose . 
 The father of the twenty @-@ cent piece was Nevada Senator John P. Jones . Part @-@ owner of the Crown Point Mine , he had been elected to the Senate in 1873 ; on February 10 , 1874 , he introduced a bill to authorize a twenty @-@ cent piece , one of his first legislative endeavors . In advocating for the proposal , he cited the lack of small change in the West . It was endorsed by mint director Linderman ; according to numismatic historian Walter Breen , " other legislators went along with it , largely as a favor to Sen. Jones " . The bill was signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 3 , 1875 . Like other denominations of silver coin , the twenty @-@ cent piece was made legal tender up to five dollars . 
 = = Preparation and design = = 
 In anticipation of the approval of the legislation , Linderman had pattern coins prepared . In August 1874 , Philadelphia Mint superintendent James Pollock sent him patterns with an obverse showing a seated Liberty by Philadelphia sculptor Joseph A. Bailly with a reverse by chief engraver William Barber . Pollock did not approve Bailly 's proposal , deeming it too similar to the Seated Liberty design which was then on all domestic silver coinage , and so the new coin would too closely resemble the quarter . On March 31 , 1875 , after the enactment of Jones 's bill , Pollock sent Linderman additional patterns , all by Barber , and even more on April 12 . Pollock deprecated a reverse design with a shield , but Linderman liked it and stated that it would have been adopted but for the law requiring an eagle to appear on silver pieces larger than the dime . Linderman selected an obverse design near @-@ identical to the other silver coinage ( until 1916 , the silver coins were given similar appearances ) . That design , by the late chief engraver , Christian Gobrecht , following a concept by Thomas Sully and Titian Peale , was first used in 1836 and by 1840 was on all denominations of silver coins then being struck . The right @-@ facing eagle is near @-@ identical to the one which Barber had rendered for the trade dollar , which had debuted in 1873 . Linderman had realized that the difference in size between the new coin and quarter was small , and thought a scaled @-@ down version of the trade dollar suitable for the twenty @-@ cent piece ; he got his way on the reverse . The eagle carries the arrows of war in its right , or dominant claw , and the olive branch of peace in the left , in heraldry preferring war over peace . 
 Art historian Cornelius Vermeule described the twenty @-@ cent piece 's obverse as " a pleasing synthesis of traditional elements " . He was less complimentary about the eagle on the reverse , calling it awkward and a fatter version of the eagle on 18th @-@ century American coinage . Vermeule admired the pattern designs made by Barber , especially the " Liberty by the Seashore " motif , which the historian believes owes a debt to the British copper coins of that period depicting Britannia — Barber was an Englishman by birth . He deemed it appropriate that the ship that is visible is powered by steam . 
 Numismatist Yancey Rayburn , in his 1970 article , wrote that the twenty @-@ cent piece is bare of much of the lettering common on US coins : neither " In God We Trust " nor " E Pluribus Unum " appears on it . At the time , " E Pluribus Unum " was required on American coins under the 1873 act ; " In God We Trust " was included on different coins at the discretion of the secretary of the treasury . The mottos were excluded as the coin was considered too small to contain them . The act creating the twenty @-@ cent piece did not dictate its design , but provided that the new coin was to be subject to the terms of the 1873 act . Rayburn also admired that the full denomination , " twenty cents " , was spelled out ; at that time the quarter and fifty @-@ cent piece had the word " dollar " abbreviated as " dol . " 
 = = Production , aftermath , and collecting = = 
 The design for the twenty @-@ cent piece was approved on April 12 , 1875 . It was , however , immediately revised to better define the olive leaves at the right end of the branch ( over the N and the T in " cents " ) ; on the original design , the leaves overlapped with each other . An amended approval was given on April 15 . Production began at Philadelphia on May 19 , on June 1 at the Carson City Mint in Jones 's home state of Nevada , and between June 1 and 17 at the San Francisco Mint . Only about 40 @,@ 000 were struck at Philadelphia ; the bulk was at the two Western mints with 133 @,@ 290 minted at Carson City , and 1 @,@ 155 @,@ 000 at San Francisco . The price of silver had not dropped to the point where Congress was willing to authorize redemption of paper money with silver coin , and would not until April 1876 , lowering the need to strike the pieces at Philadelphia . Additionally , the coin was principally intended for circulation in the West , another reason for a low mintage at Philadelphia . Mint officials had overestimated the need for the piece at San Francisco , where it saw some public acceptance and the large mintage satisfied the modest public demand until treasury officials ordered stocks melted in 1877 . 
 Although the mint had given the twenty @-@ cent piece a smooth rim , rather than the reeded one on the quarter , the two pieces were immediately confused . At 22 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 87 in ) , the twenty @-@ cent piece was only slightly smaller than the quarter at 24 @.@ 3 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 96 in ) , and the two pieces had near @-@ identical obverses . Mistakes in change @-@ making were widespread , and the twenty @-@ cent piece quickly became extremely unpopular . In April 1876 , when Congress began to allow the redemption of fractional currency with coin , the twenty @-@ cent piece was listed as among the denominations that could be exchanged for the low @-@ denomination paper . Nevertheless , in July , legislation was introduced to abolish the twenty @-@ cent piece . Although the bill did not pass immediately , according to numismatist Vernon Brown in his article on the piece , the pendency of the bill convinced the mint that there was no point in striking further twenty @-@ cent pieces . The mintage for 1876 was low ( coining took place at Philadelphia and Carson City ) , and only proof specimens were coined in 1877 and 1878 , at Philadelphia . Most of the 1876 Philadelphia mintage were sold as souvenirs at the Centennial Exposition . 
 In March 1877 , Linderman authorized the melting of 12 @,@ 359 twenty @-@ cent pieces at Carson City . This included almost the entire mintage from 1876 ( about 10 @,@ 000 ) and created one of the great American numismatic rarities , the 1876 @-@ CC twenty @-@ cent piece . Fewer than two dozen are known ; one sold at auction for $ 564 @,@ 000 in 2013 , making it the record @-@ holder for the denomination . In her 2003 article , numismatist Michele <unk> suggests that the few survivors were souvenirs obtained by visitors to the mint . 
 Congress abolished the twenty @-@ cent piece on May 2 , 1878 . The previous day , Linderman had ordered the mints to melt down twenty @-@ cent pieces on hand , for recoinage into other denominations . By then , forces for silver coinage had been victorious in passing the Bland – Allison Act , requiring the government to purchase large quantities of silver bullion , and strike it into dollars . The piece continued to circulate in the West for a few years , but by 1890 was rarely seen . Of the 1 @,@ 351 @,@ 540 twenty @-@ cent pieces minted for circulation , over a third were melted by the government between 1895 and 1954 , most heavily in 1933 . The least expensive twenty @-@ cent piece , according to the 2014 edition of R. S. Yeoman 's A Guide Book of United States Coins ( the Red Book ) , is the 1875 @-@ S , listed at $ 110 in good @-@ 4 condition . According to commentary in the Red Book , the twenty @-@ cent piece failed because " the public was confused over the coin 's similarity to the quarter dollar , which was better established as a foundation of American commerce " , that fractional currency satisfied the need for small change in the East , and because " the twenty @-@ cent piece was essentially just a substitute for two dimes " .

 = Hurricane Bonnie ( 1998 ) = 
 Hurricane Bonnie was a major hurricane that made landfall in North Carolina , United States , inflicting severe crop damage . The second named storm , first hurricane , and first major hurricane of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season , Bonnie developed from a tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa on August 14 . The wave gradually developed , and the system was designated a tropical depression on August 19 . The depression began tracking towards the west @-@ northwest , and became a tropical storm the next day . On August 22 , Bonnie was upgraded to a hurricane , with a well @-@ defined eye . The storm peaked as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale , and around the same time , the storm slowed and turned more towards the north @-@ northwest . A large and powerful cyclone , Bonnie moved ashore in North Carolina early on August 27 , slowing as it turned northeast . After briefly losing hurricane status , the storm moved offshore and regained Category 1 @-@ force winds , although it weakened again on entering cooler waters . 
 Fearing a major hurricane strike , coastal locations from Florida to Virginia performed extensive preparations in advance of the storm . In addition to tropical cyclone watches and warnings , about 950 @,@ 000 people were evacuated from the Carolinas , and the military evacuated and relocated hundreds of aircraft and vessels from the storm 's projected path . Soldiers and guardsmen were deployed throughout those regions . 
 Hurricane Bonnie made landfall as a borderline Category 2 – Category 3 storm , with intense wind gusts of up to 104 mph ( 167 km / h ) and rainfall peaking at about 11 in ( 280 mm ) . Reports of downed trees and powerlines , as well as structural damage such as blown @-@ out windows and torn @-@ off roofs , were reported . In coastal North Carolina , the storm washed ashore tens of thousands of tires that had been part of an artificial reef . Crop damage was extensive , but the storm was overall less severe than initially feared . Total damage was estimated at $ 1 billion ( 1998 USD ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On August 14 , 1998 , a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa just north of Dakar and moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean . Initially located within cool waters , a strong high pressure area steered the disturbance on a west – southwest track over warmer waters , and convection started to develop . Several small centers of rotation existed within a broad circulation , and at 1200 UTC on August 19 , the centers consolidated and the disturbance became sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression . Despite being poorly organized , winds slightly to the north of the system 's center approached tropical storm strength shortly thereafter . Ship reports revealed a closed circulation , though the center was elongated in a northwest – southeast oriented manner . Upper @-@ level winds were favorable , which suggested that intensification was likely . The cyclone began moving on a northwestward track , and just hours later the center of circulation appeared to reform close to the convection , an indication of a strengthening storm , as good outflow existed over the western side of the storm . Deep convection slowly developed closer to the center , and at 1200 UTC on August 20 , the depression was upgraded into Tropical Storm Bonnie as it continued its west – northwest track around the periphery of a high pressure system over the Leeward Islands . 
 Late on August 20 , the first reconnaissance plane entered the storm and found a minimum central barometric pressure of 1001 mb . The storm brushed the Leeward Islands , although the main thunderstorm activity remained to the north of the storm over the open ocean . Bonnie began to organize its broad circulation early on August 21 , and within the next day the storm began to intensify . The storm began to look strong on satellite images with banding features over the north and west quadrants . The Hurricane Hunters aircraft found a minimum pressure of 987 mb and a nearly complete eyewall early on August 22 , and as a result , the tropical storm was upgraded to hurricane status . Bonnie slowed in forward speed , coinciding with previous forecasts . Later that day , storm was upgraded to a Category 2 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale , which occurred with a substantial 15 mb drop in 8 hours . At the same time , steering currents weakened with the dissipation of the high pressure system ; this , combined with the effect of a nearby trough , caused the storm to turn in a more north @-@ northwestward direction around the western periphery of an anticyclone to the east . Bonnie became a Category 3 storm , a major hurricane , at 1200 UTC the next day , reaching its peak winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) at the same time . 
 A mid- to upper @-@ level trough slowed the storm almost to a halt early on August 23 , before a drift to the north @-@ northwest began . The next National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) advisory then reported that the eye was becoming more distinct and well @-@ defined . This strengthening trend abated because the storm had churned up the waters over which it was passing , bringing cooler water to the surface as a result of the slow track . Another inhibiting factor may have been related to the same trough that caused the northward turn , though due to a large anticyclone situated over the hurricane , the weakening effects were not substantial . Despite wind shear , the large and powerful circulation resisted weakening for a time . Early on August 25 , the shear and the entrainment of drier air into the hurricane took its toll on Bonnie , giving it a ragged appearance on satellite imagery , and the eye briefly became cloud @-@ filled . 
 The storm accelerated somewhat by August 26 , and early that day , it was moving at about 14 mph ( 23 km / h ) . An approaching mid @-@ level trough steered Bonnie north @-@ northeast , and at 2100 UTC on August 26 , the eye passed east of Cape Fear , North Carolina . The hurricane once again slowed , and early the next day , it made landfall near Wilmington , North Carolina as a strong Category 2 or weak Category 3 hurricane . Doppler weather radar displays estimated that maximum sustained winds had quickly weakened to below hurricane intensity , and the storm was briefly downgraded to a tropical storm . However , as the storm turned towards the east in response to the approaching trough , the center neared open waters and the winds began to re @-@ intensify . As a result , the cyclone re @-@ attained hurricane status at 0000 on August 28 . Offshore , the center began drifting roughly eastward . Entering colder waters , hurricane status was lost at 1800 UTC that day , followed by an acceleration to the northeast . The storm began to lose deep thunderstorm activity , and was forecast to lose tropical characteristics and become an extratropical cyclone within days . By early on August 29 , little connection remained over the western semicircle , and only a band of such activity persisted to the southeast of the center . Bonnie became extratropical around 1800 UTC on August 30 , to the southeast of Newfoundland . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 On August 20 , a tropical storm watch was posted for the islands of Antigua , Barbuda , Anguilla , St. Maarten , Saba and St. Eustatius , though it was discontinued the next day . Shortly thereafter , a tropical storm warning was issued for the U.S. and British Virgin Islands . Tropical storm warnings and hurricane watches were put into effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands and the southeastern Bahamas . By August 24 , those tropical cyclone advisories were discontinued , and at the same time they were issued for parts of the Southeast United States . A hurricane warning was eventually posted for <unk> Inlet , South Carolina to the North Carolina – Virginia border . On August 27 , tropical cyclone watches and warnings extended as far north as Plymouth , Massachusetts ; all were discontinued early on August 29 . 
 = = = Florida and South Carolina = = = 
 Initially the storm posed a threat to Florida , where military officials kept abreast of the situation . Heavy surf advisories were posted from central portions of the state northward to Georgia , and the National Hurricane Center advised that swimming and boating should be avoided . The Mayport Naval Station ordered 25 ships out to sea in advance of the approaching storm . The Salvation Army was on standby in Jacksonville , prepared to act when needed . Hardware stores in the state reported up to a 75 % increase in the sales of emergency supplies . 
 Some computer forecast models initially predicted that the storm would move towards South Carolina or Georgia . Before the storm 's arrival in South Carolina , researchers at Clemson University used Bonnie to test a new method of estimating the damage a storm is likely to cause . In the state , the South Carolina National Guard put about 1 @,@ 512 men on active duty , 1 @,@ 474 being of the Army National Guard . On August 25 , the South Carolina Emergency Preparedness Division activated Level 1 operations , the highest of five levels . That same day , the State Governor declared a State of Emergency , calling for mandatory evacuations of residents east of U.S. Route 17 in Horry and Georgetown counties . Schools were closed throughout the state . Over 200 @,@ 000 people were evacuated from those counties , of which 120 @,@ 000 were tourists . About 6 @,@ 000 sought shelter at schools in Horry County . In a survey , 12 % of respondents in the state took traffic as a significant consideration in deciding if they should evacuate . On the Grand Strand , Bonnie was the first storm where buses were provided to help people evacuate . 
 = = = North Carolina and Virginia = = = 
 About 815 guardsmen were called to North Carolina , where they assisted local authorities with the extensive preparations , including evacuating 750 @,@ 000 state citizens . Mandatory and voluntary evacuations were ordered for part of the state . The Outer Banks experienced extensive evacuations ; at least 300 @,@ 000 left , bringing traffic on highways from there to the mainland to a standstill . Active duty armed forces were set to support hurricane recovery missions , and four Defense Coordinating officers were notified . Defense Department emergency centers were opened starting August 21 . Additionally , the U.S. Atlantic Command activated their 24 @-@ hour response cell . Soldiers , sailors , airmen , and Marines evacuated equipment , including hundreds of vessels and aircraft . The North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources closed several state parks , all three state aquariums , and the Division of Marine Fisheries office , with plans to reopen primarily once storm @-@ related damage at any of the locations was properly addressed . 
 A study was performed on the storm in eight counties in North Carolina to determine the cost of evacuation for hurricanes , and included 1 @,@ 029 households . Another study was performed regarding the actions taken during Hurricane Bonnie evacuations in the state . Tourists were interviewed , and it was found that 90 % of vacationers who were threatened by the hurricane evacuated , of which 56 % went home , 3 % stayed in public shelters , 22 % stayed with friends or relatives , 3 % stayed in hotels and motels , and 16 % stayed elsewhere . In total , 58 % stayed within North Carolina , 12 % went to Virginia , 6 % relocated to South Carolina , and 24 % stayed in other regions . Most of the evacuees left on August 25 ; 80 % left with their own vehicles , and 18 % used rental transportation . Officials in the state opened an estimated 100 shelters to accommodate the evacuating tourists and residents . 
 In Virginia , where 15 jurisdictions declared local emergencies , local governments took action to inform and protect citizens . Residents in mobile home parks , as well as campgrounds , were advised to evacuate , and 13 jurisdictions opened shelters by August 26 . State Governor Jim Gilmore declared a State of Emergency , and as a result , the State Emergency Operations Center was activated . Beaches and piers were shut down in Virginia Beach , Hampton , and Gloucester counties , where communities canceled some local events due to the threat of Bonnie . Voluntary evacuations throughout the state were issued , and some hotels reached maximum capacity as a result . Roughly 60 Navy ships were ordered to leave port at Norfolk , and ride out the storm far out to sea . The State of Virginia banned swimming along the coast . As Bonnie progressed northward , a tornado watch was posted for much of eastern Virginia .

 While located north of the Caribbean Sea , Bonnie dropped light rainfall in Puerto Rico . The storm also produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds in The Bahamas , though no significant damage was reported . Along the U.S. East Coast , two swimmers drowned in rip currents ; numerous others were rescued . In the United States , Bonnie caused an estimated $ 1 billion in damage .

 As the hurricane passed to the east of the state , rainfall ranged from 2 to 4 in ( 51 to 102 mm ) , and storm surge was around 2 to 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 to 0 @.@ 91 m ) . The highest recorded wind gust in the state was 82 mph ( 132 km / h ) at the Cherry Grove pier , and sustained winds peaked at 76 mph ( 122 km / h ) at the Myrtle Beach Pavilion . Damage was widespread in Horry County , where downed trees and power lines and structural damage was reported . The high winds blew down several trees in Charleston County , and tore the roof off a strip mall in North Myrtle Beach . A 50 @-@ year @-@ old man died near Myrtle Beach ; he was electrocuted while checking his generator after a power outage . Along the coast , a 25 @-@ year @-@ old man died in rip currents at Surfside Beach . Total damage in South Carolina was estimated to be around $ 25 million ( 1998 USD ) . 
 = = = North Carolina = = = 
 Hurricane Bonnie came ashore just at or below major hurricane intensity , bringing with it intense wind gusts of up to 98 mph ( 158 km / h ) in North Carolina , though offshore at the Frying Pan Shoals Light Tower , winds reached 104 mph ( 167 km / h ) . The strongest winds were found in the precursor rainbands , where localized downbursts caused severe damage . Sustained winds officially peaked at 51 mph ( 82 km / h ) at Elizabeth City , where gusts reached 63 mph ( 101 km / h ) . Rainfall was heavy as a result of the storm 's slow movement , peaking at 11 in ( 280 mm ) at Jacksonville , while several totals of over 10 in ( 250 mm ) were reported . However , because the area had been experiencing drought conditions , the flooding was not as severe as it could have potentially been . The most significant flooding occurred near the Cape Fear River , where high waters were reported . The highest storm surge occurred along the beaches of Brunswick County , mostly reaching 5 to 8 ft ( 1 @.@ 5 to 2 @.@ 4 m ) above average . Elsewhere , flooding was mostly limited to locations with poor drainage and low @-@ lying areas . Coastal flooding was not widespread , though surge in the Pungo River flooded several local homes . Other coastal flooding was reported in various harbors and coastal cities . Part of North Carolina Highway 12 was flooded and closed on Hatteras Island due to tidal flooding . At North Topsail Beach , many of the protective dunes constructed after Hurricane Fran in 1996 were destroyed , and along the Bogue Banks , tens of thousands of tires , part of an artificial reef , were washed ashore . 
 One direct death occurred in North Carolina ; a young girl was killed when a tree fell on her Currituck County home . Throughout eastern portions of the state , trees and powerlines were downed , and there were reports of structural damage . Numerous docks , piers and bulkheads were either damaged or destroyed , including the Iron Steamer and Indian Beach piers , which both lost large sections to the strong wind and surf . Due to the winds , the Brunswick Community Hospital lost about 3 @,@ 000 sq ft ( 280 m2 ) . of roof and an air conditioner . The storm left about 500 @,@ 000 people in the state without electric power . In some areas , vegetative and structural debris accumulated in piles several feet deep ; it is reported that thick underbrush prevented the debris from traveling further inland . Wilmington " turned into a disaster zone " , with flooded highways , and downed trees lying across roadways . Crop , particularly tobacco , damage was extensive . According to then @-@ governor Jim Hunt , " You fly along and don 't see much damage to the beach houses , and it 's easy to think we didn 't have much damage . But then you look at the tobacco in fields and you know the damage has been extensive . " The crop losses accounted for much of the overall damage . Forty @-@ seven of those who failed to evacuate in time sought shelter in the Bald Head Island lighthouse as the worst of the storm bore down . Despite the effects , Bonnie 's impact was actually less than originally predicted . Overall , property damage in the state is estimated at $ 240 million ( 1998 USD ) , with significantly higher crop damages . 
 Several locations received significant physical impacts . On Wrightsville Beach , North Carolina , Bonnie 's erosion caused an inlet to migrate further south . On the northern end of the inlet , a large sand bar developed , partially due to the storm moving offshore sand . Dune sediments were lost during the storm , exposing boardwalk piling . Similarly , on Topsail Beach , North Carolina , the storm breached 27 sand dunes , destroying 60 % of the dune line . Sediment from storm <unk> measured 50 cm ( 20 in ) thick behind the beach . Sections of many eroded dunes were re @-@ built using truck loads of sand . Strong waves ran through the foundation of two stilted homes , both of which were later reinforced to compensate for the lost sand .

 Bonnie passed just offshore of southeast Virginia , lashing the region with heavy rain and high winds . Sustained winds reached 81 mph ( 130 km / h ) at Cape Henry , and gusts peaked at 104 mph ( 167 km / h ) . There were other reports of winds over 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) along the coast . Numerous homes suffered damage in the Hampton Roads area , and near Virginia Beach , winds blew windows out in hotels . Storm surge was generally around 2 to 4 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 to 1 @.@ 22 m ) with some higher reports , causing some coastal flooding . Rainfall was moderate to heavy , ranging from 1 to 7 in ( 25 to 178 mm ) , with the higher @-@ end totals occurring in the Norfolk area . 
 Between 320 @,@ 000 and 650 @,@ 000 customers lost power in the state . The power outages led to decreased production in some water and sewer plants , prompting local officials to advise residents to conserve water . In the Ocean View section of Norfolk , the winds tore the roofs off two apartment complexes , and damaged siding on other structures . Along the coast , boats were ripped from their moorings . 
 Throughout the Tidewater region , there were estimates of thousands of downed trees , and hundreds of homes and businesses were damaged . Of these , about 40 structures were declared uninhabitable . Debris was blown several blocks inland from the coast . Among the hardest hit locations was Sandbridge , where about 12 homes were severely damaged . It is reported that the state was unprepared for the damage , expecting a strike from a weakened tropical storm . About $ 15 @.@ 3 million ( 1998 USD ) in damage was inflicted in the Virginia Beach and Norfolk areas . Throughout the state , insured losses totaled $ 95 million ( 1998 USD ) .

 As the storm moved offshore , outer rain bands affected the Maryland coast with gusts of up to 42 mph ( 68 km / h ) at Ocean City , and waves of 10 ft ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) . No damage was reported . Light rainfall was also reported northward into Delaware and New Jersey . In addition , up to 0 @.@ 2 in ( 5 @.@ 1 mm ) of precipitation extended into New York . A person was caught in rip currents and drowned near Rehoboth Beach , Delaware . Along the coast of New Jersey , Bonnie produced strong waves and rip currents , resulting in hundreds of water rescues and eight injuries . The storm was at its closest position to the state on August 28 , as it passed 140 mi ( 230 km ) to the east of Atlantic City , although the rough surf began several days prior , on August 23 . Numerous beaches were closed , and swimming was banned in several communities , as well . The state also reported moderate wind gusts , generally peaking at 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) . Only minor beach erosion occurred . At Point Pleasant Beach , New Jersey , there were reports of a drowning in the rough seas caused by the storm ; however , the man was later spotted onshore with his fiance , and the two were charged with filing a false police report . 
 Bonnie moved well to the south of Cape Cod , although a significant outer rain band affected southern Plymouth County , Massachusetts . Torrential downpours produced 4 in ( 100 mm ) of precipitation at Whitehorse Beach , and other locations reported over 1 in ( 25 mm ) . Winds reached 25 to 35 mph ( 40 to 56 km / h ) , although offshore the Georges Bank Buoy reported a 52 mph ( 84 km / h ) gust . A man was killed when his rowboat capsized in rough surf of 1 to 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 30 to 0 @.@ 61 m ) ; his companion safely swam to shore . 
 On the afternoon of August 29 , Bonnie entered the Canadian Hurricane Centre 's area of responsibility as a tropical storm , and passed south of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland . Precipitation along the coast of Nova Scotia ranged from 15 to 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 to 0 @.@ 98 in ) and winds gusted to around 102 km / h ( 63 mph ) . Slightly higher gusts were reported off the coast .

 Following the hurricane in North Carolina , 10 counties were declared federal disaster areas , while 30 counties became eligible for public and individual assistance . Shelters were opened in 11 counties , and the Raleigh @-@ Durham International Airport briefly canceled all flights . To remove the tens of thousands of tires that washed ashore , hundreds of inmates from state prisons were sent to the Bouge Banks . Some of the tires were buried in sand , and could only be removed during low tide . About 700 more state prisoners were sent around the state to clear debris , and 39 inmate crews were deployed to help farmers salvage the severely damaged tobacco fields . In South Carolina , Horry County was declared a federal disaster area due to the damage . In Virginia , the cities of Chesapeake , Norfolk , Portsmouth , Suffolk , and Virginia Beach became eligible for individual and public assistance programs . After the storm 's departure , a thunderstorm temporarily halted power restoration by Virginia Power company crews . Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore allowed for over $ 11 million ( 1998 USD ) in state and federal funds to help five cities recover . The storm also contributed to a 13 @.@ 6 % decline in home sales across the southern United States during the month of August by " discouraging potential home buyers " in coastal areas . 
 Both during and after Hurricane Bonnie 's onslaught , analysis of the storm was extensive ; it was deemed " the most observed hurricane in history . " When examined with Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission ( TRMM ) satellite imagery , it was discovered that peak cloud tops surrounding the eyewall rose 59 @,@ 000 ft ( 18 @,@ 000 m ) into the atmosphere , twice as tall as Mount Everest . This was the first time that TRMM had observed such a tropical cyclone structure , according to co @-@ developer of the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale , Bob Simpson . The storm was also used for collection of tropical cyclone research data . For the first time in the Atlantic , a fleet of aircraft investigated the storm 's upper @-@ levels , while other aircraft flew into the low- and middle @-@ levels . A record of over 500 parachute sensors were dropped into the storm while it was active . Each costing $ 600 ( 1998 USD ) , they sent storm data to research centers via Global Positioning System . 
 During the storm , the Weather Channel web site experienced substantially increased traffic . Up from an average of three million views per day , 10 million page views on August 26 led to slow download times on the website . On seven major weather providers , page views increased by 123 % from August 24 – August 26 , compared to an equal period of time during the previous week . 
 = Adrian S. Fisher = 
 Adrian Sanford Fisher ( January 21 , 1914 – March 18 , 1983 ) was an American lawyer and federal public servant , who served from the late 1930s through the early 1980s . He was associated with the Department of War and Department of State throughout his professional career . He participated in the U.S. government 's decision to carry out Japanese @-@ American internment and the international ( 1945 – 46 ) Nuremberg trial , and in State Department Cold War activities during the Harry S. Truman administration . He was the State Department Legal Adviser under Secretary of State Dean Acheson . During the John F. Kennedy , Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter administrations , Fisher was directly involved in the negotiations of international nuclear testing and non @-@ proliferation agreements . 
 = = Early life and early government career = = 
 Fisher was born in Memphis , Tennessee , to Hubert Fisher and Louise Sanford Fisher . He attended elite schools such as Saint Albans and Choate , Princeton University ( BA 1934 ) and Harvard Law School ( LLB 1937 ) . Fisher was known throughout his life by his nickname " Butch " , from his early days as a football player for Princeton , lettering in 1933 . 
 In the late 1930s Fisher lived in Arlington , Virginia , in an estate known by the name of Hockley Hall . This house was a semi @-@ famous " bachelor 's house , " with rooms rented by Fisher and various housemates such as William Bundy , William Sheldon , John Ferguson , John Oakes , Donald Hiss , Edward Prichard , Jr. and Philip Graham . Also , Hockley Hall was known as a social venue for the likes of Dean Acheson , Archibald MacLeish and Francis Biddle . 
 Fisher was admitted to the Tennessee Bar in 1938 , and had the distinction of clerking for two U.S. Supreme Court Justices , Louis Brandeis ( 1938 – 39 ) and Felix Frankfurter ( 1939 – 40 ) . Fisher began his legal career with his appointment as Law Clerk to Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis , who was then 82 years old . In early 1939 , Brandeis announced his retirement from the Supreme Court , and Fisher was invited to transfer to the chambers of the recently appointed Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter . Following his term as Frankfurter 's clerk in 1940 , Fisher joined the United States Department of State as the assistant chief of the Foreign Funds Control Division of the State Department , where he served until shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . 
 = = World War II government and military service = = 
 In early 1942 , Fisher and John J. McCloy were assigned to assist implementation of the United States War Department 's legal activities for the Japanese American internment programs shortly after the United States entered World War II . In late 1942 , Fisher received an officer 's commission , and trained as a bomber navigator in the United States Army Air Forces from 1942 to 1943 , with missions over France , Belgium and Germany . In 1944 , he returned to Washington , D.C. as an assistant to the Assistant Secretary of War , John J. McCloy .

 In 1944 , Fisher again was required to become involved in the U.S. 1942 @-@ 43 internment of Japanese Americans on the West Coast of the United States upon his return from Europe . At that time , the case of Korematsu v. United States , challenging the U.S. government ’ s power to exclude citizens of Japanese ancestry from military zones , came before the United States Supreme Court . While the Department of Justice 's Herbert Wechsler ( an Assistant Attorney General ) was in charge of defending the government 's position before the Supreme Court , significant consultation with Fisher was required , as he was again with the legal affairs section of the War Department . During this period , Fisher was involved in critical drafting of the government 's brief submitted to the Supreme Court . 
 = = = Nuremberg international trial = = = 
 In 1945 and 1946 , Captain Fisher served , along with James Rowe , as a legal advisor to former U.S. Attorney General Francis Biddle , the United States member of the International Military Tribunal ( Nuremberg Trial ) . Fisher was principal drafter of the Tribunal 's memorandum on the Nazi leadership 's " conspiracies to engage in crimes against peace . " This document , covering the period from 1920 to November 1937 , demonstrated that the pace of re @-@ armament under Adolf Hitler showed that the Germans " were developing an economic system which was only sensible only if there should be a war . " 
 = = Return to Washington , D.C. and service with Dean Acheson = = 
 Upon his return from Europe and exit from the Army Air Force , Fisher served as Solicitor for the U.S. Department of Commerce from 1947 to 1948 . Thereafter , Fisher became general counsel of the Atomic Energy Commission from 1948 @-@ 49 . He then served as legal advisor ( with the rank of Assistant Secretary of State ) to the Department of State ( serving in the office of Secretary of State Dean Acheson ) from 1949 to 1953 . During 1952 , Mr. Fisher also served as legal advisor to the U.S. Delegation to the United Nations in Paris . 
 In 1952 , Fisher was also appointed by President Harry S. Truman as an original commissioner to the President 's Commission on Immigration and Naturalization . The Commission was established in the Executive Office of the President by Executive Order 10392 " Establishing the President 's Commission on Immigration and Naturalization " . The specific context for the 1952 commission was the enactment of the <unk> @-@ Walter Act , which was passed over President Truman 's veto . Truman 's main disagreement with the Act was its retention of the quota system that began in 1924 . After Congress passed the Act over his veto , he formed the Commission and charged it with looking into new options for immigration and naturalization policy . 
 Secretary of State Acheson 's appointment of Fisher as the State Department 's Legal Adviser was unique at the time , because of the closeness of the Acheson / Fisher professional relationship . Fisher 's role as Acheson 's legal adviser was explained by Michael H. <unk> , the State Department 's Assistant Legal Adviser for Economic Affairs , 1950 @-@ 52 : 
 ( Acheson ) insisted on having , as a legal adviser , a lawyer whose ability as a lawyer and whose judgment in politics and statesmanship could be greatly respected . He got Adrian Fisher for that , and he involved him in all of the political and other activities that he himself was involved in . The Secretary of State always is involved in a lot of controversial things , and here we had the McCarthy era , the attack on the whole concept of Foreign Service and the State Department , and a terrific controversy over what to do about China , who had " lost China . " Fisher was always at Acheson 's right hand when he was dealing with other people about these things . Wherever he went , Fisher 's office was backstopping him , getting all the necessary background information so he 'd be prepared for any kind of question that came up . Of course , Acheson 's own approach to being Secretary of State was such that when you took an agreement to him to be signed , his chief question was " By what authority do I sign this ? " And whoever brought it to him to get it signed , had to be ready with the answer that would satisfy a lawyer -- " by what legal authority " -- as well as what it provides and so forth . 
 = = = Building the H @-@ bomb = = = 
 In late 1949 , President Truman asked Dean Acheson to concentrate on the question of whether the United States should develop the hydrogen bomb . Acheson formed a working group under the United States National Security Council ( NSC ) executive secretary Sidney Souers , consisting of R. Gordon Arneson , Paul Nitze and Fisher , who served as the State Department 's legal adviser on the project . It was Arneson 's view that each member of the working group were of one mind . He said , " The four principals in the State Department were Acheson , Nitze , Fisher and myself . I don 't think it was necessary for any one of us to persuade anybody else ; we all were of a mind that there really wasn 't any choice . " 
 Fisher was part of this same working group which recommended that an internal NSC study be conducted on the overall U.S. foreign policy as it pertained to the newly developing Cold War . This classified study ( declassified in 1977 ) called NSC @-@ 68 , was the blueprint for the Truman Doctrine for containment of communism , which provided the overall policy concepts for the U.S. participation in the Cold War throughout the 1950s .

Fisher was assigned the responsibility for the coordination of the State Department Congressional testimony regarding the firing of General MacArthur .

 In August 1950 , Fisher was involved in an incident between Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Senator Kenneth S.

During the hearing , Senator Wherry began to harangue Acheson about events in Korea . Suddenly , Acheson jumped out of his chair towards Wherry , with fists raised . Fisher was required to physically hold Acheson back from striking Wherry . As the incident was told by eye @-@ witness John H. Ohly , then the Assistant Director , Office of International Security Affairs , Department of State , 
 " The next day the administration threw in its big guns -- Secretary Acheson , Louis Johnson , and , from ECA , William Foster . This time the going was really rough from the Republican side of the table and Acheson consciously lost his temper over some of Wherry 's remarks and got up and tried to slug him . Adrian Fisher , State Department Legal Adviser and a close friend of Acheson , caught his arm , fortunately , because Acheson would have missed Wherry by about three feet and probably fallen flat on his face on the floor . It was a great show . " 
 This scene was portrayed in the film " The Manchurian Candidate " , with Frank Sinatra ( as Major Marco ) taking on Fisher 's role of restraining ( in that instance ) the United States Secretary of Defense .

 From 1961 to 1968 , Fisher served as the Deputy Director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in which he took a primary negotiations role during the Atomic Test Ban Treaty of 1963 between the U.S. and the Soviet Union . At that time he was Deputy to John J. McCloy , Adviser to the President on Disarmament . In 1968 , Fisher served as one of the chief U.S. negotiators of the Nuclear Non @-@ Proliferation Treaty , which was signed by the United States , the United Kingdom , the Soviet Union , and 59 other countries on July 1 , 1968 .

Fisher 's connection with the Washington Post arose because of his close friendship with the Post 's then @-@ owner Phillip Graham since his early days in Washington , D.C. Both Fisher and Graham had clerked for Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter and had shared a rented house ( belonging to future Secretary of State Dean Acheson ) , together with Donald Hiss ( brother of Alger Hiss ) . From 1969 to 1975 , Fisher served as Dean of Georgetown University Law Center , Washington , D.C. According to a report in the Georgetown student newspaper " The Hoya " , Fisher was not solicited as a candidate for the position , but simply submitted his own name . " I heard they were looking around for a new person , so I called up and asked to be considered . " Dean Fisher was installed as the first occupant of the Francis Cabell Brown Chair in International Law of the center on January 25 , 1977 , and served as law professor from 1977 to 1980 .

 In 1981 , Fisher joined the faculty of George Mason University School of Law in Arlington , Virginia , teaching various seminars on negotiation tactics . The George Mason Law Review named its annual award for best student article in honor of Mr. Fisher . From 1981 to 1982 , Mr. Fisher also served as an advisor to John J. McCloy during the hearings of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians ( established by Congress in 1980 ) . This commission reviewed the impact of Executive Order 9066 on Japanese @-@ Americans and determined that they were the victims of discrimination by the Federal government .

 = Gliese 581 d = 
 Gliese 581 d / ˈɡliːzə / ( often shortened to Gl 581 d or GJ 581 d ) is a possible extrasolar planet orbiting the star Gliese 581 approximately 20 @.@ 4 light @-@ years away in the constellation of Libra . It is the third planet claimed in the system and ( assuming a six @-@ planet model ) the fifth in order from the star . 
 Though not confirmed to be a terrestrial planet and significantly more massive than Earth ( at 6 @.@ 98 Earth masses ) , the Super @-@ Earth is the first exoplanet of terrestrial mass proposed to orbit within the habitable zone of its parent star . 
 Assuming its existence , computer climate simulations have confirmed the possibility of the existence of surface water and these factors combine to a relatively high measure of planetary habitability . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 A team of astronomers led by Stéphane Udry of the Geneva Observatory used the HARPS instrument on the European Southern Observatory 3 @.@ 6 meter telescope in La Silla , Chile to discover the planet in 2007 . Udry 's team employed the radial velocity technique , in which the mass of a planet is determined based on the small perturbations it induces in its parent star ’ s orbit via gravity . 
 = = = Formerly disputed = = = 
 In September 2012 , Roman <unk> filtered out the " red noise " from the Keck data and concluded that this planet 's existence is probable only to 2 @.@ 2 standard deviations . 
 That same year , however , a team from the USNO confirmed the existence of the planet with a much higher probability . 
 A study in 2014 concluded that Gliese 581 d is " an artifact of stellar activity which , when incompletely corrected , causes the false detection of planet g . " In 2015 , a study by Dr Guillem Anglada @-@ <unk> concluded that the planet could exist . 
 = = Orbital characteristics = = 
 Gliese 581 d orbits Gliese 581 at 0 @.@ <unk> AU , approximately a fifth of the distance that the Earth orbits the Sun , though its orbital eccentricity has not been confirmed . There are currently two models for its orbit , a circular one like Earth 's , and an eccentric one like Mercury 's . These are based on the four planet and six planet model for the Gliese 581 system , respectively . Under the four planet model Gliese 581 d would most probably be in a spin @-@ orbit resonance of 2 : 1 , rotating twice for each orbit of its parent star . Therefore , the day on Gliese 581 d should approximately be 67 Earth days long . 
 The orbital distance places it at the outer limits of the habitable zone , the distance at which it is believed possible for water to exist on the surface of a planetary body . At the time of its discovery , the planet 's orbit was originally thought to be farther out . However , in late April 2009 the original discovery team revised its original estimate of the planet 's orbital parameters , finding that it orbits closer to its star than originally determined with an orbital period of 66 @.@ 87 days . They concluded that the planet is within the habitable zone where liquid water could exist . Moreover , the data also suggested that the proposed exoplanet could have at least one or more large oceans . 
 = = Possible confirmation = = 
 The planet 's existence has been disputed due to inaccurate analysis from stellar activity , but later reanalysis of data suggests planet Gliese 581 d could really exist , despite stellar variability , exciting astronomers . 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 The motion of the parent star indicates a minimum mass for Gliese 581 d of 5 @.@ 6 Earth masses ( earlier analyses gave higher values ) . Dynamical simulations of the Gliese 581 system assuming that the orbits of the three planets are coplanar show that the system becomes unstable if the masses of the planets exceed 1 @.@ 6 – 2 times the minimum values . Using earlier minimum mass values for Gliese 581 d , this implies an upper mass limit for Gliese 581 d of 13 @.@ 8 Earth masses . The composition of the planet , however , is not known . 
 = = = Climate and habitability = = = 
 As the planet is not known to transit from Earth and atmospheric conditions are not observable with current technology , no atmosphere for the planet has been confirmed to date . As such , all climate predictions for the planet are based on predicted orbits and computer modelling of theoretical atmospheric conditions . 
 Because Gliese 581 d was believed to orbit outside the habitable zone of its star it was originally thought to be too cold for liquid water to be present . With the 2009 revised orbit , climate simulations conducted by researchers in France in 2011 indicated possible temperatures suitable for surface water at sufficient atmospheric pressure According to Stéphane Udry , " It could be covered by a ' large and deep ocean ' ; it is the first serious ocean planet candidate . " 
 On average , the light that Gliese 581 d receives from its star has about 30 % of the intensity of light the Earth receives from the Sun . By comparison , sunlight on Mars has about 40 % of the intensity of that on Earth . That might seem to suggest that Gliese 581 d is too cold to support liquid water and hence is inhospitable to life . However , an atmospheric greenhouse effect can significantly raise planetary temperatures . For example , Earth 's own mean temperature would be about − 18 ° C without any greenhouse gases , ranging from around 100 ° C on the day side to − 150 ° C at night , much like that found on the Moon . If the atmosphere of Gliese 581 d produces a sufficiently large greenhouse effect , and the planet 's geophysics stabilize the CO2 levels ( as Earth 's does via plate tectonics ) , then the surface temperature might permit a liquid water cycle , conceivably allowing the planet to support life . Calculations by Barnes et al. suggest , however , that tidal heating is too low to keep plate tectonics active on the planet , unless radiogenic heating is somewhat higher than expected . 
 Gliese 581 d is probably too massive to be made only of rocky material . It may have originally formed on a more distant orbit as an icy planet that then migrated closer to its star . Its equilibrium temperature is 181 Kelvin .

 As part of the 2009 National Science Week celebrations in Australia , Cosmos magazine launched a website called Hello From Earth to collect messages for transmission to Gliese 581 d . The maximum length of the messages was 160 characters , and they were restricted to the English language . In total , 25 @,@ 880 messages were collected from 195 countries around the world .

 DevilDriver are an American heavy metal band from Santa Barbara , California , formed in 2002 , consisting of vocalist Dez Fafara ( the only remaining original member ) , guitarists Mike Spreitzer and Neal Tiemann , bassist Diego " Ashes " Ibarra and drummer Austin D <unk> . The band was originally named Deathride , however , due to copyright issues and the name being taken by several bands , Deathride changed its name to DevilDriver , which refers to bells Italian Wiccans used to drive evil forces away . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Fafara hosted several barbecues after moving from Orange County to Santa Barbara and would jam with musicians he met , which led to the formation of the band . " I met Evan we struck up a friendship and started jamming , " said Fafara Guitarist Evan Pitts met Fafara in a restaurant and gave him his phone number for a jam session , while John Boecklin who originally played 2nd guitar then went to playing drums , met Fafara at a bar . 
 The band was originally known as Deathride , but later changed their name to DevilDriver because Fafara felt there were too many bands with that name ; a band in Norfolk , Virginia , and a bicycle racing team . Another problem was that the band 's label , Roadrunner Records were unable to secure copyright . The members compiled a list of roughly two hundred names to go for a more original approach . Fafara 's wife had a book by Italian witchcraft author Raven Grimassi on Stregheria , and came across the term " devil driver " . The term " devil driver " refers to bells Italian witches used to drive evil forces away . Fafara thought it was appropriate because it sounded " evil " , and thought the term " suits his life " . The band 's logo is the Cross of Confusion , which has existed for thousands of years and refers to " question religion , question authority , question everything around you " . Fafara was brought up to " question everything " and was exposed to Italian witchcraft through his grandparents . 
 DevilDriver 's debut record was originally going to be called Thirteen , and then Straight to Hell . However , Fafara claims it was changed " for so many reasons that I can 't even go into . " The band 's self @-@ titled debut DevilDriver , was released on October 21 , 2003 under Roadrunner Records , and entered the Top Heatseekers chart at number 17 . Guitarist Pitts wrote roughly 90 % of the music , according to Mike Spreitzer , who replaced Pitts after his departure from the band . Music critics response to the album was generally negative . Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus commented that elements in the songs " Die ( And Die Now ) " and " Swinging the Dead " redeem an otherwise disappointing album and hoped the band would focus less on the mainstream . 
 = = = The Fury of Our Maker 's Hand ( 2005 – 2006 ) = = = 
 The band returned to the studio in 2005 to record their follow @-@ up to DevilDriver . The album was produced at Sonic Ranch Studios , a 1 @,@ 400 @-@ acre ( 5 @.@ 7 km2 ) pecan ranch , 40 miles ( 64 km ) away from El Paso , Texas . The band members wanted to be isolated when recording the album so they could solely focus on the music as friends , family , managers and girlfriends would constantly interrupt . Roughly 30 songs were written which were narrowed down to 15 by the band . The 15 songs were then played for producer Colin Richardson who wanted to begin tracking immediately . 
 The name of the album was thought of by Fafara who believed that The Fury of Our Maker 's Hand refers to the " storm " his life has been the past 10 years , " You have your maker 's hand and I have my maker 's hand and we both living in our fury , the fury of our maker 's hand . It explains my life " . The album was released on June 28 , 2005 and debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at number 117 , with sales of 10 @,@ 402 in its first week . The album also debuted at number 1 on the Top Heatseekers chart . Johnny Loftus of Allmusic described the album as " a severe turn away from the falter of their first album " and said that the band made their " true debut the second time around " . Dom Lawson of Kerrang ! gave the album a positive review describing the album as a " fresh and exhilarating approach to modern metal " . 
 The band toured extensively in support of the album , which included shows in the United States , Europe , and Australia in support of bands such as In Flames , Fear Factory , and Machine Head . The band played for the first time as a headliner in the Burning Daylight Tour . On October 31 , 2006 , The Fury of Our Maker 's Hand was re @-@ released to include three new studio tracks , including " Digging up the Corpses " which was featured on the soundtrack to Resident Evil : Apocalypse . The release also contained three live recordings of previously released , a DVD of all of the band 's music videos , new cover art , and inside liner notes .

 The band reunited at Sonic Ranch Studios while they recorded their third studio effort , The Last Kind Words , which was released in June 2007 . The album 's first single " Not All Who Wander Are Lost " was directed by Nathan Cox for free . Cox 's career began when he created Coal Chamber 's music video " Loco " , so he re @-@ paid a favor to Fafara and the band . Cox now directs music videos for bands such as Linkin Park and Korn . The first song to be previewed was " Horn of Betrayal " which debuted on Sirius Satellite 's Hard Attack channel on May 16 , 2007 . The Last Kind Words entered the German charts at number 92 , and peaked at number 48 on the Billboard 200 , with over 14 @,@ 000 copies sold . 
 DevilDriver promoted the album at the 2007 Download Festival at Donington Park alongside headliners Linkin Park , Iron Maiden , and My Chemical Romance . A Guinness world record was attempted by the band for the " largest circle pit " at the festival . Guinness responded to the query and denied the request stating they receive over 60 @,@ 000 requests a year and there is no way to physically define where a circle pit starts and ends . They considered the proposal fully in the context of the subject area and stated that " our decision is final in this matter " . The band also appeared at 2007 's Ozzfest . Fafara had been planning to take his first six weeks off in 11 years , but Sharon Osbourne , who had managed Fafara 's previous band Coal Chamber , persuaded him to appear . At a concert in Detroit , Michigan , a recording was made with the intention of releasing a live DVD in 2008 although this has yet to be released . 
 DevilDriver 's songs " Devil 's Son " and " Driving Down the Darkness " were featured in the TV show Scrubs , and in 2008 they covered the Iron Maiden song " Wasted Years " for the Kerrang ! compilation Maiden Heaven : A Tribute to Iron Maiden . The song " Clouds Over California " became available as a download for the music video game Rock Band .
