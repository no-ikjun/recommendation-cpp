 On April 15 , 1923 , at New York City 's Rivoli Theater , came the first commercial screening of motion pictures with sound @-@ on @-@ film , the future standard : a set of shorts under the banner of De Forest <unk> , accompanying a silent feature . That June , De Forest entered into an extended legal battle with an employee , Freeman Harrison Owens , for title to one of the crucial Phonofilm patents . Although De Forest ultimately won the case in the courts , Owens is today recognized as a central innovator in the field . The following year , De Forest 's studio released the first commercial dramatic film shot as a talking picture — the two @-@ reeler Love 's Old Sweet Song , directed by J. Searle Dawley and featuring Una Merkel . However , <unk> 's stock in trade was not original dramas but celebrity documentaries , popular music acts , and comedy performances . President Calvin Coolidge , opera singer Abbie Mitchell , and vaudeville stars such as Phil Baker , Ben Bernie , Eddie Cantor and Oscar Levant appeared in the firm 's pictures . Hollywood remained suspicious , even fearful , of the new technology . As Photoplay editor James Quirk put it in March 1924 , " Talking pictures are perfected , says Dr. Lee De Forest . So is castor oil . " De Forest 's process continued to be used through 1927 in the United States for dozens of short <unk> ; in the UK it was employed a few years longer for both shorts and features by British Sound Film Productions , a subsidiary of British Talking Pictures , which purchased the primary Phonofilm assets . By the end of 1930 , the Phonofilm business would be liquidated . 
 In Europe , others were also working on the development of sound @-@ on @-@ film . In 1919 , the same year that DeForest received his first patents in the field , three German inventors patented the Tri @-@ Ergon sound system . On September 17 , 1922 , the Tri @-@ Ergon group gave a public screening of sound @-@ on @-@ film productions — including a dramatic talkie , Der <unk> ( The <unk> ) — before an invited audience at the Alhambra Kino in Berlin . By the end of the decade , Tri @-@ Ergon would be the dominant European sound system . In 1923 , two Danish engineers , Axel Petersen and Arnold Poulsen , patented a system that recorded sound on a separate filmstrip running parallel with the image reel . Gaumont licensed the technology and briefly put it to commercial use under the name <unk> . 
 Domestic competition , however , eclipsed Phonofilm . By September 1925 , De Forest and Case 's working arrangement had fallen through . The following July , Case joined Fox Film , Hollywood 's third largest studio , to found the Fox @-@ Case Corporation . The system developed by Case and his assistant , Earl <unk> , given the name Movietone , thus became the first viable sound @-@ on @-@ film technology controlled by a Hollywood movie studio . The following year , Fox purchased the North American rights to the Tri @-@ Ergon system , though the company found it inferior to Movietone and virtually impossible to integrate the two different systems to advantage . In 1927 , as well , Fox retained the services of Freeman Owens , who had particular expertise in constructing cameras for synch @-@ sound film . 
 = = = Advanced sound @-@ on @-@ disc = = = 
 Parallel with improvements in sound @-@ on @-@ film technology , a number of companies were making progress with systems that recorded movie sound on phonograph discs . In sound @-@ on @-@ disc technology from the era , a phonograph turntable is connected by a mechanical interlock to a specially modified film projector , allowing for synchronization . In 1921 , the <unk> sound @-@ on @-@ disc system developed by Orlando Kellum was employed to add synchronized sound sequences to D. W. Griffith 's failed silent film Dream Street . A love song , performed by star Ralph Graves , was recorded , as was a sequence of live vocal effects . Apparently , dialogue scenes were also recorded , but the results were unsatisfactory and the film was never publicly screened incorporating them . On May 1 , 1921 , Dream Street was re @-@ released , with love song added , at New York City 's Town Hall theater , qualifying it — however haphazardly — as the first feature @-@ length film with a live @-@ recorded vocal sequence . There would be no others for more than six years . 
 In 1925 , Sam Warner of Warner Bros. , then a small Hollywood studio with big ambitions , saw a demonstration of the Western Electric sound @-@ on @-@ disc system and was sufficiently impressed to persuade his brothers to agree to experiment with using this system at New York 's Vitagraph Studios , which they had recently purchased . The tests were convincing to the Warner Brothers , if not to the executives of some other picture companies who witnessed them . Consequently , in April 1926 the Western Electric Company entered into a contract with Warner Brothers and W. J. Rich , a financier , giving them an exclusive license for recording and reproducing sound pictures under the Western Electric system . To exploit this license the Vitaphone Corporation was organized with Samuel L. Warner as its president . Vitaphone , as this system was now called , was publicly introduced on August 6 , 1926 , with the premiere of the nearly three @-@ hour @-@ long Don Juan ; the first feature @-@ length movie to employ a synchronized sound system of any type throughout , its soundtrack contained a musical score and added sound effects , but no recorded dialogue — in other words , it had been staged and shot as a silent film . Accompanying Don Juan , however , were eight shorts of musical performances , mostly classical , as well as a four @-@ minute filmed introduction by Will H. Hays , president of the Motion Picture Association of America , all with live @-@ recorded sound . These were the first true sound films exhibited by a Hollywood studio . Warner Bros. ' The Better ' Ole , technically similar to Don Juan , followed in October . 
 Sound @-@ on @-@ film would ultimately win out over sound @-@ on @-@ disc because of a number of fundamental technical advantages : 
 Synchronization : no interlock system was completely reliable , and sound could fall out of synch due to disc skipping or minute changes in film speed , requiring constant supervision and frequent manual adjustment 
 Editing : discs could not be directly edited , severely limiting the ability to make alterations in their accompanying films after the original release cut 
 Distribution : phonograph discs added expense and complication to film distribution 
 Wear and tear : the physical process of playing the discs degraded them , requiring their replacement after approximately twenty screenings 
 Nonetheless , in the early years , sound @-@ on @-@ disc had the edge over sound @-@ on @-@ film in two substantial ways : 
 Production and capital cost : it was generally less expensive to record sound onto disc than onto film and the exhibition systems — turntable / interlock / projector — were cheaper to manufacture than the complex image @-@ and @-@ audio @-@ pattern @-@ reading projectors required by sound @-@ on @-@ film 
 Audio quality : phonograph discs , Vitaphone 's in particular , had superior dynamic range to most sound @-@ on @-@ film processes of the day , at least during the first few playings ; while sound @-@ on @-@ film tended to have better frequency response , this was outweighed by greater distortion and noise 
 As sound @-@ on @-@ film technology improved , both of these disadvantages were overcome . 
 The third crucial set of innovations marked a major step forward in both the live recording of sound and its effective playback : 
 = = = Fidelity electronic recording and amplification = = = 
 In 1913 , Western Electric , the manufacturing division of AT & T , acquired the rights to the de Forest <unk> , the forerunner of the triode vacuum tube . Over the next few years they developed it into a predictable and reliable device that made electronic amplification possible for the first time . Western Electric then branched @-@ out into developing uses for the vacuum tube including public address systems and an electrical recording system for the recording industry . Beginning in 1922 , the research branch of Western Electric began working intensively on recording technology for both sound @-@ on @-@ disc and sound @-@ on film synchronised sound systems for motion @-@ pictures . 
 The engineers working on the sound @-@ on @-@ disc system were able to draw on expertise that Western Electric already had in electrical disc recording and were thus able to make faster initial progress . The main change required was to increase the playing time of the disc so that it could match that of a standard 1 @,@ 000 ft ( 300 m ) reel of 35 mm film . The chosen design used a disc measuring 16 inches ( 410 mm ) rotating at 33 1 / 3 rpm . This could play for 11 minutes , the running time of 1000 ft of film at 90 ft / min ( 24 frames / s ) . Because of the larger diameter the minimum groove velocity of 70 ft / min ( 14 inches or 356 mm / s ) was only slightly less than that of a standard 10 @-@ inch 78 rpm commercial disc . In 1925 , the company publicly introduced a greatly improved system of electronic audio , including sensitive condenser microphones and rubber @-@ line recorders ( named after the use of a rubber damping band for recording with better frequency response onto a wax master disk ) . That May , the company licensed entrepreneur Walter J. Rich to exploit the system for commercial motion pictures ; he founded Vitagraph , in which Warner Bros. acquired a half interest , just one month later . In April 1926 , Warners signed a contract with AT & T for exclusive use of its film sound technology for the redubbed Vitaphone operation , leading to the production of Don Juan and its accompanying shorts over the following months . During the period when Vitaphone had exclusive access to the patents , the fidelity of recordings made for Warners films was markedly superior to those made for the company 's sound @-@ on @-@ film competitors . Meanwhile , Bell Labs — the new name for the AT & T research operation — was working at a furious pace on sophisticated sound amplification technology that would allow recordings to be played back over loudspeakers at theater @-@ filling volume . The new moving @-@ coil speaker system was installed in New York 's Warners Theatre at the end of July and its patent submission , for what Western Electric called the No. 555 Receiver , was filed on August 4 , just two days before the premiere of Don Juan . 
 Late in the year , AT & T / Western Electric created a licensing division , Electrical Research Products Inc . ( ERPI ) , to handle rights to the company 's film @-@ related audio technology . Vitaphone still had legal exclusivity , but having lapsed in its royalty payments , effective control of the rights was in ERPI 's hands . On December 31 , 1926 , Warners granted Fox @-@ Case a sublicense for the use of the Western Electric system ; in exchange for the sublicense , both Warners and ERPI received a share of Fox 's related revenues . The patents of all three concerns were cross @-@ licensed . Superior recording and amplification technology was now available to two Hollywood studios , pursuing two very different methods of sound reproduction . The new year would finally see the emergence of sound cinema as a significant commercial medium . 
 = = Triumph of the " talkies " = = 
 In February 1927 , an agreement was signed by five leading Hollywood movie companies : Famous Players Lasky ( soon to be part of Paramount ) , Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer , Universal , First National , and Cecil B. DeMille 's small but prestigious Producers Distributing Corporation ( PDC ) . The five studios agreed to collectively select just one provider for sound conversion . The alliance then sat back and waited to see what sort of results the forerunners came up with . In May , Warner Bros. sold back its exclusivity rights to ERPI ( along with the Fox @-@ Case sublicense ) and signed a new royalty contract similar to Fox 's for use of Western Electric technology . As Fox and Warners pressed forward with sound cinema in different directions , both technologically and commercially — Fox with newsreels and then scored dramas , Warners with talking features — so did ERPI , which sought to corner the market by signing up the five allied studios . 
 The big sound film sensations of the year all took advantage of preexisting celebrity . On May 20 , 1927 , at New York 's Roxy Theater , Fox Movietone presented a sound film of the takeoff of Charles Lindbergh 's celebrated flight to Paris , recorded earlier that day . In June , a Fox sound newsreel depicting his return welcomes in New York and Washington , D.C. , was shown . These were the two most acclaimed sound motion pictures to date . In May , as well , Fox had released the first Hollywood fiction film with synchronized dialogue : the short They 're Coming to Get Me , starring comedian Chic Sale . After <unk> a few silent feature hits , such as Seventh Heaven , with recorded music , Fox came out with its first original Movietone feature on September 23 : Sunrise , by acclaimed German director F. W. Murnau . As with Don Juan , the film 's soundtrack consisted of a musical score and sound effects ( including , in a couple of crowd scenes , " wild " , nonspecific vocals ) . 
 Then , on October 6 , 1927 , Warner Bros. ' The Jazz Singer premiered . It was a smash box office success for the mid @-@ level studio , earning a total of $ 2 @.@ 625 million in the United States and abroad , almost a million dollars more than the previous record for a Warners film . Produced with the Vitaphone system , most of the film does not contain live @-@ recorded audio , relying , like Sunrise and Don Juan , on a score and effects . When the movie 's star , Al Jolson , sings , however , the film shifts to sound recorded on the set , including both his musical performances and two scenes with ad @-@ libbed speech — one of Jolson 's character , <unk> Rabinowitz ( Jack Robin ) , addressing a cabaret audience ; the other an exchange between him and his mother . The " natural " sounds of the settings were also audible . Though the success of The Jazz Singer was due largely to Jolson , already established as one of America 's biggest music stars , and its limited use of synchronized sound hardly qualified it as an innovative sound film ( let alone the " first " ) , the movie 's profits were proof enough to the industry that the technology was worth investing in . 
 The development of commercial sound cinema had proceeded in fits and starts before The Jazz Singer , and the film 's success did not change things overnight . Not until May 1928 did the group of four big studios ( PDC had dropped out of the alliance ) , along with United Artists and others , sign with ERPI for conversion of production facilities and theaters for sound film . Initially , all ERPI @-@ wired theaters were made Vitaphone @-@ compatible ; most were equipped to project Movietone reels as well . However , even with access to both technologies , most of the Hollywood companies remained slow to produce talking features of their own . No studio besides Warner Bros. released even a part @-@ talking feature until the low @-@ budget @-@ oriented Film Booking Offices of America ( FBO ) premiered The Perfect Crime on June 17 , 1928 , eight months after The Jazz Singer . FBO had come under the effective control of a Western Electric competitor , General Electric 's RCA division , which was looking to market its new sound @-@ on @-@ film system , Photophone . Unlike Fox @-@ Case 's Movietone and De Forest 's Phonofilm , which were variable @-@ density systems , Photophone was a variable @-@ area system — a refinement in the way the audio signal was inscribed on film that would ultimately become the standard . ( In both sorts of systems , a specially @-@ designed lamp , whose exposure to the film is determined by the audio input , is used to record sound photographically as a series of minuscule lines . In a variable @-@ density process , the lines are of varying darkness ; in a variable @-@ area process , the lines are of varying width . ) By October , the FBO @-@ RCA alliance would lead to the creation of Hollywood 's newest major studio , RKO Pictures . 
 Meanwhile , Warner Bros. had released three more talkies , all profitable , if not at the level of The Jazz Singer : In March , Tenderloin appeared ; it was billed by Warners as the first feature in which characters spoke their parts , though only 15 of its 88 minutes had dialogue . Glorious Betsy followed in April , and The Lion and the Mouse ( 31 minutes of dialogue ) in May . On July 6 , 1928 , the first all @-@ talking feature , Lights of New York , premiered . The film cost Warner Bros. only $ 23 @,@ 000 to produce , but grossed $ 1 @.@ 252 million , a record rate of return surpassing 5 @,@ 000 % . In September , the studio released another Al Jolson part @-@ talking picture , The Singing Fool , which more than doubled The Jazz Singer 's earnings record for a Warners movie . This second Jolson screen smash demonstrated the movie musical 's ability to turn a song into a national hit : inside of nine months , the Jolson number " Sonny Boy " had racked up 2 million record and 1 @.@ 25 million sheet music sales . September 1928 also saw the release of Paul Terry 's Dinner Time , among the first animated cartoons produced with synchronized sound . Soon after he saw it , Walt Disney released his first sound picture , the Mickey Mouse short Steamboat Willie . 
 Over the course of 1928 , as Warner Bros. began to rake in huge profits due to the popularity of its sound films , the other studios quickened the pace of their conversion to the new technology . Paramount , the industry leader , put out its first talkie in late September , Beggars of Life ; though it had just a few lines of dialogue , it demonstrated the studio 's recognition of the new medium 's power . Interference , Paramount 's first all @-@ talker , debuted in November . The process known as " goat <unk> " briefly became widespread : soundtracks , sometimes including a <unk> of post @-@ dubbed dialogue or song , were added to movies that had been shot , and in some cases released , as silents . A few minutes of singing could qualify such a newly endowed film as a " musical . " ( Griffith 's Dream Street had essentially been a " goat gland . " ) Expectations swiftly changed , and the sound " fad " of 1927 became standard procedure by 1929 . In February 1929 , sixteen months after The Jazz Singer 's debut , Columbia Pictures became the last of the eight studios that would be known as " majors " during Hollywood 's Golden Age to release its first part @-@ talking feature , Lone Wolf 's Daughter . In late May , the first all @-@ color , all @-@ talking feature , Warner Bros. ' On with the Show ! , premiered . 
 Yet most American movie theaters , especially outside of urban areas , were still not equipped for sound : while the number of sound cinemas grew from 100 to 800 between 1928 and 1929 , they were still vastly outnumbered by silent theaters , which had actually grown in number as well , from 22 @,@ 204 to 22 @,@ 544 . The studios , in parallel , were still not entirely convinced of the talkies ' universal appeal — through mid @-@ 1930 , the majority of Hollywood movies were produced in dual versions , silent as well as talking . Though few in the industry predicted it , silent film as a viable commercial medium in the United States would soon be little more than a memory . Points West , a Hoot Gibson Western released by Universal Pictures in August 1929 , was the last purely silent mainstream feature put out by a major Hollywood studio . 
 = = = Transition : Europe = = = 
 The Jazz Singer had its European sound premiere at the Piccadilly Theatre in London on September 27 , 1928 . According to film historian Rachael Low , " Many in the industry realized at once that a change to sound production was inevitable . " On January 16 , 1929 , the first European feature film with a synchronized vocal performance and recorded score premiered : the German production Ich <unk> <unk> Hand , Madame ( I Kiss Your Hand , Madame ) . <unk> , it contains only a few songs performed by Richard Tauber . The movie was made with the sound @-@ on @-@ film system controlled by the German @-@ Dutch firm Tobis , corporate heirs to the Tri @-@ Ergon concern . With an eye toward commanding the emerging European market for sound film , Tobis entered into a compact with its chief competitor , Klangfilm , a joint subsidiary of Germany 's two leading electrical manufacturers . Early in 1929 , Tobis and Klangfilm began <unk> their recording and playback technologies . As ERPI began to wire theaters around Europe , Tobis @-@ Klangfilm claimed that the Western Electric system infringed on the Tri @-@ Ergon patents , stalling the introduction of American technology in many places . Just as RCA had entered the movie business to maximize its recording system 's value , Tobis also established its own production operations . 
 During 1929 , most of the major European filmmaking countries began joining Hollywood in the changeover to sound . Many of the trend @-@ setting European talkies were shot abroad as production companies leased studios while their own were being converted or as they deliberately targeted markets speaking different languages . One of Europe 's first two feature @-@ length dramatic talkies was created in still a different sort of twist on multinational moviemaking : The Crimson Circle was a coproduction between director Friedrich <unk> 's <unk> @-@ Film company and British Sound Film Productions ( <unk> ) . In 1928 , the film had been released as the silent Der Rote Kreis in Germany , where it was shot ; English dialogue was apparently dubbed in much later using the De Forest Phonofilm process controlled by <unk> 's corporate parent . It was given a British trade screening in March 1929 , as was a part @-@ talking film made entirely in the UK : The Clue of the New Pin , a British Lion production using the sound @-@ on @-@ disc British Photophone system . In May , Black Waters , a British and Dominions Film Corporation promoted as the first UK all @-@ talker , received its initial trade screening ; it had been shot completely in Hollywood with a Western Electric sound @-@ on @-@ film system . None of these pictures made much impact . 
 The first successful European dramatic talkie was the all @-@ British Blackmail . Directed by twenty @-@ nine @-@ year @-@ old Alfred Hitchcock , the movie had its London debut June 21 , 1929 . Originally shot as a silent , Blackmail was restaged to include dialogue sequences , along with a score and sound effects , before its premiere . A British International Pictures ( BIP ) production , it was recorded on RCA Photophone , General Electric having bought a share of AEG so they could access the Tobis @-@ Klangfilm markets . Blackmail was a substantial hit ; critical response was also positive — notorious curmudgeon Hugh Castle , for example , called it " perhaps the most intelligent mixture of sound and silence we have yet seen . " 
 On August 23 , the modest @-@ sized Austrian film industry came out with a talkie : G ’ <unk> aus der Steiermark ( Stories from Styria ) , an Eagle Film – <unk> Film production . On September 30 , the first entirely German @-@ made feature @-@ length dramatic talkie , Das Land ohne Frauen ( Land Without Women ) , premiered . A Tobis Filmkunst production , about one @-@ quarter of the movie contained dialogue , which was strictly segregated from the special effects and music . The response was underwhelming . Sweden 's first talkie , <unk> Svensson ( Artificial Svensson ) , premiered on October 14 . Eight days later , Aubert Franco @-@ Film came out with Le Collier de la reine ( The Queen 's Necklace ) , shot at the <unk> studio near Paris . Conceived as a silent film , it was given a Tobis @-@ recorded score and a single talking sequence — the first dialogue scene in a French feature . On October 31 , Les Trois masques debuted ; a Pathé @-@ <unk> film , it is generally regarded as the initial French feature talkie , though it was shot , like Blackmail , at the Elstree studio , just outside London . The production company had contracted with RCA Photophone and Britain then had the nearest facility with the system . The <unk> @-@ <unk> talkie La Route est belle , also shot at Elstree , followed a few weeks later . 
 Before the Paris studios were fully sound @-@ equipped — a process that stretched well into 1930 — a number of other early French talkies were shot in Germany . The first all @-@ talking German feature , Atlantik , had premiered in Berlin on October 28 . Yet another Elstree @-@ made movie , it was rather less German at heart than Les Trois masques and La Route est belle were French ; a BIP production with a British scenarist and German director , it was also shot in English as Atlantic . The entirely German <unk> @-@ Film production It 's You I Have Loved ( Dich hab ich <unk> ) opened three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half weeks later . It was not " Germany 's First Talking Film " , as the marketing had it , but it was the first to be released in the United States . 
 In 1930 , the first Polish talkies premiered , using sound @-@ on @-@ disc systems : <unk> pani <unk> ( The Morality of Mrs. <unk> ) in March and the all @-@ talking <unk> <unk> ( Dangerous Love Affair ) in October . In Italy , whose once vibrant film industry had become moribund by the late 1920s , the first talkie , La Canzone dell 'amore ( The Song of Love ) , also came out in October ; within two years , Italian cinema would be enjoying a revival . The first movie spoken in Czech debuted in 1930 as well , Tonka <unk> ( Tonka of the Gallows ) . Several European nations with minor positions in the field also produced their first talking pictures — Belgium ( in French ) , Denmark , Greece , and Romania . The Soviet Union 's robust film industry came out with its first sound features in December 1930 : Dziga Vertov 's nonfiction <unk> had an experimental , dialogueless soundtrack ; Abram Room 's documentary Plan <unk> <unk> ( The Plan of the Great Works ) had music and spoken voiceovers . Both were made with locally developed sound @-@ on @-@ film systems , two of the two hundred or so movie sound systems then available somewhere in the world . In June 1931 , the Nikolai Ekk drama <unk> v <unk> ( The Road to Life or A Start in Life ) , premiered as the Soviet Union 's first true talking picture . 
 Throughout much of Europe , conversion of exhibition venues lagged well behind production capacity , requiring talkies to be produced in parallel silent versions or simply shown without sound in many places . While the pace of conversion was relatively swift in Britain — with over 60 percent of theaters equipped for sound by the end of 1930 , similar to the U.S. figure — in France , by contrast , more than half of theaters nationwide were still projecting in silence by late 1932 . According to scholar Colin G. Crisp , " Anxiety about resuscitating the flow of silent films was frequently expressed in the [ French ] industrial press , and a large section of the industry still saw the silent as a viable artistic and commercial prospect till about 1935 . " The situation was particularly acute in the Soviet Union ; as of May 1933 , fewer than one out of every hundred film projectors in the country was as yet equipped for sound . 
 = = = Transition : Asia = = = 
 During the 1920s and 1930s , Japan was one of the world 's two largest producers of motion pictures , along with the United States . Though the country 's film industry was among the first to produce both sound and talking features , the full changeover to sound proceeded much more slowly than in the West . It appears that the first Japanese sound film , <unk> ( Dawn ) , was made in 1926 with the De Forest Phonofilm system . Using the sound @-@ on @-@ disc <unk> system , the leading Nikkatsu studio produced a pair of talkies in 1929 : <unk> no <unk> ( The Captain 's Daughter ) and <unk> ( Hometown ) , the latter directed by Kenji Mizoguchi . The rival Shochiku studio began the successful production of sound @-@ on @-@ film talkies in 1931 using a variable @-@ density process called <unk> . Two years later , however , more than 80 percent of movies made in the country were still silents . Two of the country 's leading directors , Mikio <unk> and <unk> Ozu , did not make their first sound films until 1935 and 1936 , respectively . As late as 1938 , over a third of all movies produced in Japan were shot without dialogue . 
 The enduring popularity of the silent medium in Japanese cinema owed in great part to the tradition of the benshi , a live narrator who performed as accompaniment to a film screening . As director Akira Kurosawa later described , the benshi " not only recounted the plot of the films , they enhanced the emotional content by performing the voices and sound effects and providing evocative descriptions of events and images on the screen .... The most popular narrators were stars in their own right , solely responsible for the patronage of a particular theatre . " Film historian Mariann Lewinsky argues , 
 The end of silent film in the West and in Japan was imposed by the industry and the market , not by any inner need or natural evolution .... Silent cinema was a highly pleasurable and fully mature form . It didn 't lack anything , least in Japan , where there was always the human voice doing the dialogues and the commentary . Sound films were not better , just more economical . As a cinema owner you didn 't have to pay the wages of musicians and benshi any more . And a good benshi was a star demanding star payment . 
 By the same token , the viability of the benshi system facilitated a gradual transition to sound — allowing the studios to spread out the capital costs of conversion and their directors and technical crews time to become familiar with the new technology . 
 The Mandarin @-@ language <unk> hóng <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> Girl Red Peony ) , starring Butterfly Wu , premiered as China 's first feature talkie in 1930 . By February of that year , production was apparently completed on a sound version of The Devil 's Playground , arguably qualifying it as the first Australian talking motion picture ; however , the May press screening of Commonwealth Film Contest prizewinner Fellers is the first verifiable public exhibition of an Australian talkie . In September 1930 , a song performed by Indian star Sulochana , excerpted from the silent feature Madhuri ( 1928 ) , was released as a synchronized @-@ sound short , the country 's first . The following year , Ardeshir Irani directed the first Indian talking feature , the Hindi @-@ Urdu Alam Ara , and produced Kalidas , primarily in Tamil with some Telugu . Nineteen @-@ thirty @-@ one also saw the first Bengali @-@ language film , Jamai <unk> , and the first movie fully spoken in Telugu , Bhakta Prahlada . In 1932 , <unk> Raja became the first movie in which Marathi was spoken to be released ( though Sant Tukaram was the first to go through the official censorship process ) ; the first Gujarati @-@ language film , <unk> Mehta , and all @-@ Tamil talkie , <unk> , debuted as well . The next year , Ardeshir Irani produced the first Persian @-@ language talkie , <unk> @-@ e @-@ <unk> . Also in 1933 , the first Cantonese @-@ language films were produced in Hong Kong — Sha <unk> <unk> ( The Idiot 's Wedding Night ) and Liang xing ( Conscience ) ; within two years , the local film industry had fully converted to sound . Korea , where <unk> ( or <unk> @-@ sa ) held a role and status similar to that of the Japanese benshi , in 1935 became the last country with a significant film industry to produce its first talking picture : Chunhyangjeon ( <unk> / <unk> ) is based on the seventeenth @-@ century <unk> folktale " <unk> " , of which as many as fifteen film versions have been made through 2009 .

 In the short term , the introduction of live sound recording caused major difficulties in production . Cameras were noisy , so a soundproofed cabinet was used in many of the earliest talkies to isolate the loud equipment from the actors , at the expense of a drastic reduction in the ability to move the camera . For a time , multiple @-@ camera shooting was used to compensate for the loss of mobility and innovative studio technicians could often find ways to liberate the camera for particular shots . The necessity of staying within range of still microphones meant that actors also often had to limit their movements unnaturally . Show Girl in Hollywood ( 1930 ) , from First National Pictures ( which Warner Bros. had taken control of thanks to its profitable adventure into sound ) , gives a behind @-@ the @-@ scenes look at some of the techniques involved in shooting early talkies . Several of the fundamental problems caused by the transition to sound were soon solved with new camera casings , known as " blimps " , designed to suppress noise and boom microphones that could be held just out of frame and moved with the actors . In 1931 , a major improvement in playback fidelity was introduced : three @-@ way speaker systems in which sound was separated into low , medium , and high frequencies and sent respectively to a large bass " woofer " , a midrange driver , and a treble " tweeter . " 
 There were consequences , as well , for other technological aspects of the cinema . Proper recording and playback of sound required exact standardization of camera and projector speed . Before sound , 16 frames per second ( fps ) was the supposed norm , but practice varied widely . Cameras were often <unk> or <unk> to improve exposures or for dramatic effect . Projectors were commonly run too fast to shorten running time and squeeze in extra shows . Variable frame rate , however , made sound unlistenable , and a new , strict standard of 24 fps was soon established . Sound also forced the abandonment of the noisy arc lights used for filming in studio interiors . The switch to quiet incandescent illumination in turn required a switch to more expensive film stock . The sensitivity of the new panchromatic film delivered superior image tonal quality and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical . 
 As David Bordwell describes , technological improvements continued at a swift pace : " Between 1932 and 1935 , [ Western Electric and RCA ] created directional microphones , increased the frequency range of film recording , reduced ground noise ... and extended the volume range . " These technical advances often meant new aesthetic opportunities : " Increasing the fidelity of recording ... heightened the dramatic possibilities of vocal timbre , pitch , and loudness . " Another basic problem — famously spoofed in the 1952 film Singin ' in the Rain — was that some silent @-@ era actors simply did not have attractive voices ; though this issue was frequently overstated , there were related concerns about general vocal quality and the casting of performers for their dramatic skills in roles also requiring singing talent beyond their own . By 1935 , rerecording of vocals by the original or different actors in postproduction , a process known as " looping " , had become practical . The ultraviolet recording system introduced by RCA in 1936 improved the reproduction of sibilants and high notes . 
 With Hollywood 's wholesale adoption of the talkies , the competition between the two fundamental approaches to sound @-@ film production was soon resolved . Over the course of 1930 – 31 , the only major players using sound @-@ on @-@ disc , Warner Bros. and First National , changed over to sound @-@ on @-@ film recording . Vitaphone 's dominating presence in sound @-@ equipped theaters , however , meant that for years to come all of the Hollywood studios pressed and distributed sound @-@ on @-@ disc versions of their films alongside the sound @-@ on @-@ film prints . Fox Movietone soon followed Vitaphone into disuse as a recording and reproduction method , leaving two major American systems : the variable @-@ area RCA Photophone and Western Electric 's own variable @-@ density process , a substantial improvement on the cross @-@ licensed Movietone . Under RCA 's instigation , the two parent companies made their projection equipment compatible , meaning films shot with one system could be screened in theaters equipped for the other . This left one big issue — the Tobis @-@ Klangfilm challenge . In May 1930 , Western Electric won an Austrian lawsuit that voided protection for certain Tri @-@ Ergon patents , helping bring Tobis @-@ Klangfilm to the negotiating table . The following month an accord was reached on patent cross @-@ licensing , full playback compatibility , and the division of the world into three parts for the provision of equipment . As a contemporary report describes : 
 Tobis @-@ Klangfilm has the exclusive rights to provide equipment for : Germany , Danzig , Austria , Hungary , Switzerland , Czechoslovakia , Holland , the Dutch Indies , Denmark , Sweden , Norway , Bulgaria , Romania , Yugoslavia , and Finland . The Americans have the exclusive rights for the United States , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , India , and Russia . All other countries , among them Italy , France , and England , are open to both parties . 
 The agreement did not resolve all the patent disputes , and further negotiations were undertaken and concords signed over the course of the 1930s . During these years , as well , the American studios began abandoning the Western Electric system for RCA Photophone 's variable @-@ area approach — by the end of 1936 , only Paramount , MGM , and United Artists still had contracts with ERPI .

 While the introduction of sound led to a boom in the motion picture industry , it had an adverse effect on the employability of a host of Hollywood actors of the time . Suddenly those without stage experience were regarded as suspect by the studios ; as suggested above , those whose heavy accents or otherwise discordant voices had previously been concealed were particularly at risk . The career of major silent star Norma Talmadge effectively came to an end in this way . The celebrated German actor Emil Jannings returned to Europe . <unk> found John Gilbert 's voice an awkward match with his swashbuckling persona , and his star also faded . Audiences now seemed to perceive certain silent @-@ era stars as old @-@ fashioned , even those who had the talent to succeed in the sound era . The career of Harold Lloyd , one of the top screen comedians of the 1920s , declined precipitously . Lillian Gish departed , back to the stage , and other leading figures soon left acting entirely : Colleen Moore , Gloria Swanson , and Hollywood 's most famous performing couple , Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford . As actress Louise Brooks suggested , there were other issues as well : 
 Studio heads , now forced into unprecedented decisions , decided to begin with the actors , the least palatable , the most vulnerable part of movie production . It was such a splendid opportunity , anyhow , for breaking contracts , cutting salaries , and taming the stars .... Me , they gave the salary treatment . I could stay on without the raise my contract called for , or quit , [ Paramount studio chief B. P. ] Schulberg said , using the questionable dodge of whether I 'd be good for the talkies . Questionable , I say , because I spoke decent English in a decent voice and came from the theater . So without hesitation I quit . 
 Similarly , Clara Bow 's speaking voice was sometimes blamed for the demise of her Hollywood career , though the real issues involved her clashes with studio executives and what film historian David Thomson describes as the " backlash of bourgeois hypocrisy " against a lifestyle that would have been unremarkable for a male star . Buster Keaton was eager to explore the new medium , but when his studio , MGM , made the changeover to sound , he was quickly stripped of creative control . Though a number of Keaton 's early talkies made impressive profits , they were artistically dismal . 
 Several of the new medium 's biggest attractions came from vaudeville and the musical theater , where performers such as Jolson , Eddie Cantor , Jeanette MacDonald , and the Marx Brothers were accustomed to the demands of both dialogue and song . James Cagney and Joan Blondell , who had teamed on Broadway , were brought west together by Warner Bros. in 1930 . A few actors were major stars during both the silent and the sound eras : Richard Barthelmess , Clive Brook , Bebe Daniels , Norma Shearer , the comedy team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy , and the incomparable Charlie Chaplin , whose City Lights ( 1931 ) and Modern Times ( 1936 ) employed sound almost exclusively for music and effects . Janet Gaynor became a top star with the synch @-@ sound but dialogueless Seventh Heaven and Sunrise , as did Joan Crawford with the technologically similar Our Dancing Daughters ( 1928 ) . Greta Garbo was the one non – native English speaker to retain Hollywood stardom on both sides of the great sound divide . The new emphasis on speech also caused producers to hire many novelists , journalists , and playwrights with experience writing good dialogue . Among those who became Hollywood scriptwriters during the 1930s were Nathanael West , William Faulkner , Robert Sherwood , Aldous Huxley , and Dorothy Parker . 
 As talking pictures emerged , with their prerecorded musical tracks , an increasing number of <unk> orchestra musicians found themselves out of work . More than just their position as film accompanists was usurped ; according to historian Preston J. Hubbard , " During the 1920s live musical performances at first @-@ run theaters became an exceedingly important aspect of the American cinema . " With the coming of the talkies , those featured performances — usually staged as preludes — were largely eliminated as well . The American Federation of Musicians took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices . One 1929 ad that appeared in the Pittsburgh Press features an image of a can labeled " Canned Music / Big Noise Brand / Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever " and reads in part : 
 Canned Music on Trial 
 This is the case of Art vs. Mechanical Music in theatres . The defendant stands accused in front of the American people of attempted corruption of musical appreciation and discouragement of musical education . Theatres in many cities are offering synchronised mechanical music as a substitute for Real Music . If the theatre @-@ going public accepts this <unk> of its entertainment program a deplorable decline in the Art of Music is inevitable . Musical authorities know that the soul of the Art is lost in mechanisation . It cannot be otherwise because the quality of music is dependent on the mood of the artist , upon the human contact , without which the essence of intellectual stimulation and emotional rapture is lost . 
 By the following year , a reported 22 @,@ 000 U.S. <unk> musicians had lost their jobs . 
 = = = Commerce = = = 
 In September 1926 , Jack L. Warner , head of Warner Bros. , was quoted to the effect that talking pictures would never be viable : " They fail to take into account the international language of the silent pictures , and the unconscious share of each onlooker in creating the play , the action , the plot , and the imagined dialogue for himself . " Much to his company 's benefit , he would be proven very wrong — between the 1927 – 28 and 1928 – 29 fiscal years , Warners ' profits surged from $ 2 million to $ 14 million . Sound film , in fact , was a clear boon to all the major players in the industry . During that same twelve @-@ month span , Paramount 's profits rose by $ 7 million , Fox 's by $ 3 @.@ 5 million , and Loew 's / MGM 's by $ 3 million . RKO , which hadn 't even existed in September 1928 and whose parent production company , FBO , was in the Hollywood minor leagues , by the end of 1929 was established as one of America 's leading entertainment businesses . <unk> the boom was the emergence of an important new cinematic genre made possible by sound : the musical . Over sixty Hollywood musicals were released in 1929 , and more than eighty the following year . 
 Even as the Wall Street crash of October 1929 helped plunge the United States and ultimately the global economy into depression , the popularity of the talkies at first seemed to keep Hollywood immune . The 1929 – 30 exhibition season was even better for the motion picture industry than the previous , with ticket sales and overall profits hitting new highs . Reality finally struck later in 1930 , but sound had clearly secured Hollywood 's position as one of the most important industrial fields , both commercially and culturally , in the United States . In 1929 , film box @-@ office receipts comprised 16 @.@ 6 percent of total spending by Americans on recreation ; by 1931 , the figure had reached 21 @.@ 8 percent . The motion picture business would command similar figures for the next decade and a half . Hollywood ruled on the larger stage , as well . The American movie industry — already the world 's most powerful — set an export record in 1929 that , by the applied measure of total feet of exposed film , was 27 percent higher than the year before . Concerns that language differences would hamper U.S. film exports turned out to be largely unfounded . In fact , the expense of sound conversion was a major obstacle to many overseas producers , relatively undercapitalized by Hollywood standards . The production of multiple versions of export @-@ bound talkies in different languages ( known as " Foreign Language Version " ) , as well as the production of the cheaper " International Sound Version " , a common approach at first , largely ceased by mid @-@ 1931 , replaced by post @-@ dubbing and subtitling . Despite trade restrictions imposed in most foreign markets , by 1937 , American films commanded about 70 percent of screen time around the globe . 
 Just as the leading Hollywood studios gained from sound in relation to their foreign competitors , they did the same at home . As historian Richard B. Jewell describes , " The sound revolution crushed many small film companies and producers who were unable to meet the financial demands of sound conversion . " The combination of sound and the Great Depression led to a wholesale shakeout in the business , resulting in the hierarchy of the Big Five integrated companies ( MGM , Paramount , Fox , Warners , RKO ) and the three smaller studios also called " majors " ( Columbia , Universal , United Artists ) that would predominate through the 1950s . Historian Thomas Schatz describes the ancillary effects : 
 Because the studios were forced to streamline operations and rely on their own resources , their individual house styles and corporate personalities came into much sharper focus . Thus the watershed period from the coming of sound into the early Depression saw the studio system finally coalesce , with the individual studios coming to terms with their own identities and their respective positions within the industry . 
 The other country in which sound cinema had an immediate major commercial impact was India . As one distributor of the period said , " With the coming of the talkies , the Indian motion picture came into its own as a definite and distinctive piece of creation . This was achieved by music . " From its earliest days , Indian sound cinema has been defined by the musical — Alam Ara featured seven songs ; a year later , <unk> would feature seventy . While the European film industries fought an endless battle against the popularity and economic muscle of Hollywood , ten years after the debut of Alam Ara , over 90 percent of the films showing on Indian screens were made within the country . 
 Most of India 's early talkies were shot in Bombay , which remains the leading production center , but sound filmmaking soon spread across the multilingual nation . Within just a few weeks of Alam Ara 's March 1931 premiere , the Calcutta @-@ based Madan Pictures had released both the Hindi Shirin Farhad and the Bengali Jamai <unk> . The Hindustani Heer <unk> was produced in Lahore , Punjab , the following year . In 1934 , Sati Sulochana , the first Kannada talking picture to be released , was shot in Kolhapur , Maharashtra ; Srinivasa Kalyanam became the first Tamil talkie actually shot in Tamil Nadu . Once the first talkie features appeared , the conversion to full sound production happened as rapidly in India as it did in the United States . Already by 1932 , the majority of feature productions were in sound ; two years later , 164 of the 172 Indian feature films were talking pictures . Since 1934 , with the sole exception of 1952 , India has been among the top three movie @-@ producing countries in the world every single year . 
 = = = Aesthetic quality = = = 
 In the first , 1930 edition of his global survey The Film Till Now , British cinema pundit Paul Rotha declared , " A film in which the speech and sound effects are perfectly synchronised and coincide with their visual image on the screen is absolutely contrary to the aims of cinema . It is a degenerate and misguided attempt to destroy the real use of the film and cannot be accepted as coming within the true boundaries of the cinema . " Such opinions were not rare among those who cared about cinema as an art form ; Alfred Hitchcock , though he directed the first commercially successful talkie produced in Europe , held that " the silent pictures were the purest form of cinema " and scoffed at many early sound films as delivering little beside " photographs of people talking " . In Germany , Max Reinhardt , stage producer and movie director , expressed the belief that the talkies , " bringing to the screen stage plays ... tend to make this independent art a subsidiary of the theater and really make it only a substitute for the theater instead of an art in itself ... like reproductions of paintings . " 
 In the opinion of many film historians and aficionados , both at the time and subsequently , silent film had reached an aesthetic peak by the late 1920s and the early years of sound cinema delivered little that was comparable to the best of the silents . For instance , despite fading into relative obscurity once its era had passed , silent cinema is represented by eleven films in Time Out 's Centenary of Cinema Top One Hundred poll , held in 1995 . The first year in which sound film production predominated over silent film — not only in the United States , but also in the West as a whole — was 1929 ; yet the years 1929 through 1933 are represented by three dialogueless pictures ( Pandora 's Box [ 1929 ] , Zemlya [ 1930 ] , City Lights [ 1931 ] ) and zero talkies in the Time Out poll . ( City Lights , like Sunrise , was released with a recorded score and sound effects , but is now customarily referred to by historians and industry professionals as a " silent " — spoken dialogue regarded as the crucial distinguishing factor between silent and sound dramatic cinema . ) The earliest sound film to place is the French L <unk> ( 1934 ) , directed by Jean Vigo ; the earliest Hollywood sound film to qualify is Bringing Up Baby ( 1938 ) , directed by Howard Hawks . 
 The first sound feature film to receive near @-@ universal critical approbation was Der Blaue Engel ( The Blue Angel ) ; premiering on April 1 , 1930 , it was directed by Josef von Sternberg in both German and English versions for Berlin 's UFA studio . The first American talkie to be widely honored was All Quiet on the Western Front , directed by Lewis Milestone , which premiered April 21 . The other internationally acclaimed sound drama of the year was <unk> 1918 , directed by G. W. Pabst for Nero @-@ Film of Berlin . Historian Anton Kaes points to it as an example of " the new verisimilitude [ that ] rendered silent cinema 's former emphasis on the hypnotic gaze and the symbolism of light and shadow , as well as its preference for allegorical characters , anachronistic . " Cultural historians consider the French L 'Âge d 'Or , directed by Luis Buñuel , which appeared late in 1930 , to be of great aesthetic import ; at the time , its erotic , blasphemous , anti @-@ bourgeois content caused a scandal . Swiftly banned by Paris police chief Jean Chiappe , it was unavailable for fifty years . The earliest sound movie now acknowledged by most film historians as a masterpiece is Nero @-@ Film 's M , directed by Fritz Lang , which premiered May 11 , 1931 . As described by Roger Ebert , " Many early talkies felt they had to talk all the time , but Lang allows his camera to prowl through the streets and dives , providing a rat 's @-@ eye view . " 
 = = = Cinematic form = = = 
 " Talking film is as little needed as a singing book . " Such was the blunt proclamation of critic Viktor <unk> , one of the leaders of the Russian formalist movement , in 1927 . While some regarded sound as irreconcilable with film art , others saw it as opening a new field of creative opportunity . The following year , a group of Soviet filmmakers , including Sergei Eisenstein , proclaimed that the use of image and sound in juxtaposition , the so @-@ called contrapuntal method , would raise the cinema to " ... unprecedented power and cultural height . Such a method for constructing the sound @-@ film will not confine it to a national market , as must happen with the photographing of plays , but will give a greater possibility than ever before for the circulation throughout the world of a filmically expressed idea . " So far as one segment of the audience was concerned , however , the introduction of sound brought a virtual end to such circulation : Elizabeth C. Hamilton writes , " Silent films offered people who were deaf a rare opportunity to participate in a public discourse , cinema , on equal terms with hearing people . The emergence of sound film effectively separated deaf from hearing audience members once again . " 
 On March 12 , 1929 , the first feature @-@ length talking picture made in Germany had its premiere . The inaugural Tobis Filmkunst production , it was not a drama , but a documentary sponsored by a shipping line : Melodie der Welt ( Melody of the World ) , directed by Walter <unk> . This was also perhaps the first feature film anywhere to significantly explore the artistic possibilities of joining the motion picture with recorded sound . As described by scholar William Moritz , the movie is " intricate , dynamic , fast @-@ paced ... <unk> [ ing ] similar cultural habits from countries around the world , with a superb orchestral score ... and many synchronized sound effects . " Composer Lou <unk> was among a number of contemporary artists struck by the film : " Melodie der Welt became the first important sound documentary , the first in which musical and unmusical sounds were composed into a single unit and in which image and sound are controlled by one and the same impulse . " Melodie der Welt was a direct influence on the industrial film Philips Radio ( 1931 ) , directed by Dutch avant @-@ garde filmmaker Joris Ivens and scored by <unk> , who described its audiovisual aims : 
 To render the half @-@ musical impressions of factory sounds in a complex audio world that moved from absolute music to the purely documentary noises of nature . In this film every intermediate stage can be found : such as the movement of the machine interpreted by the music , the noises of the machine dominating the musical background , the music itself is the documentary , and those scenes where the pure sound of the machine goes solo . 
 Many similar experiments were pursued by Dziga Vertov in his 1931 <unk> and by Chaplin in Modern Times , a half @-@ decade later . 
 A few innovative commercial directors immediately saw the ways in which sound could be employed as an integral part of cinematic storytelling , beyond the obvious function of recording speech . In Blackmail , Hitchcock manipulated the reproduction of a character 's monologue so the word " knife " would leap out from a blurry stream of sound , reflecting the subjective impression of the protagonist , who is desperate to conceal her involvement in a fatal stabbing . In his first film , the Paramount Applause ( 1929 ) , Rouben Mamoulian created the illusion of acoustic depth by varying the volume of ambient sound in proportion to the distance of shots . At a certain point , Mamoulian wanted the audience to hear one character singing at the same time as another prays ; according to the director , " They said we couldn 't record the two things — the song and the prayer — on one mike and one channel . So I said to the sound man , ' Why not use two mikes and two channels and combine the two tracks in printing ? ' " Such methods would eventually become standard procedure in popular filmmaking . 
 One of the first commercial films to take full advantage of the new opportunities provided by recorded sound was Le Million , directed by René Clair and produced by Tobis 's French division . Premiering in Paris in April 1931 and New York a month later , the picture was both a critical and popular success . A musical comedy with a barebones plot , it is memorable for its formal accomplishments , in particular , its emphatically artificial treatment of sound . As described by scholar Donald Crafton , 
 Le Million never lets us forget that the acoustic component is as much a construction as the whitewashed sets . [ It ] replaced dialogue with actors singing and talking in rhyming couplets . Clair created teasing confusions between on- and off @-@ screen sound . He also experimented with asynchronous audio tricks , as in the famous scene in which a chase after a coat is synched to the cheers of an invisible football ( or rugby ) crowd . 
 These and similar techniques became part of the vocabulary of the sound comedy film , though as special effects and " color " , not as the basis for the kind of comprehensive , non @-@ naturalistic design achieved by Clair . Outside of the comedic field , the sort of bold play with sound exemplified by Melodie der Welt and Le Million would be pursued very rarely in commercial production . Hollywood , in particular , incorporated sound into a reliable system of genre @-@ based moviemaking , in which the formal possibilities of the new medium were subordinated to the traditional goals of star affirmation and straightforward storytelling . As accurately predicted in 1928 by Frank Woods , secretary of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , " The talking pictures of the future will follow the general line of treatment heretofore developed by the silent drama .... The talking scenes will require different handling , but the general construction of the story will be much the same . "

 = Georg Cantor = 
 Georg Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp Cantor ( / <unk> / KAN @-@ tor ; German : [ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ] ; March 3 [ O.S. February 19 ] 1845 – January 6 , 1918 ) was a German mathematician . He invented set theory , which has become a fundamental theory in mathematics . Cantor established the importance of one @-@ to @-@ one correspondence between the members of two sets , defined infinite and well @-@ ordered sets , and proved that the real numbers are more numerous than the natural numbers . In fact , Cantor 's method of proof of this theorem implies the existence of an " infinity of infinities " . He defined the cardinal and ordinal numbers and their arithmetic . Cantor 's work is of great philosophical interest , a fact of which he was well aware . 
 Cantor 's theory of transfinite numbers was originally regarded as so counter @-@ intuitive – even shocking – that it encountered resistance from mathematical contemporaries such as Leopold Kronecker and Henri Poincaré and later from Hermann Weyl and L. E. J. Brouwer , while Ludwig Wittgenstein raised philosophical objections . Cantor , a devout Lutheran , believed the theory had been communicated to him by God . Some Christian theologians ( particularly neo @-@ <unk> ) saw Cantor 's work as a challenge to the uniqueness of the absolute infinity in the nature of God – on one occasion equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism – a proposition that Cantor vigorously rejected . 
 The objections to Cantor 's work were occasionally fierce : Henri Poincaré referred to his ideas as a " grave disease " infecting the discipline of mathematics , and Leopold Kronecker 's public opposition and personal attacks included describing Cantor as a " scientific charlatan " , a " renegade " and a " <unk> of youth . " Kronecker objected to Cantor 's proofs that the algebraic numbers are countable , and that the transcendental numbers are uncountable , results now included in a standard mathematics curriculum . Writing decades after Cantor 's death , Wittgenstein lamented that mathematics is " ridden through and through with the pernicious idioms of set theory , " which he dismissed as " utter nonsense " that is " laughable " and " wrong " . Cantor 's recurring bouts of depression from 1884 to the end of his life have been blamed on the hostile attitude of many of his contemporaries , though some have explained these episodes as probable manifestations of a bipolar disorder . 
 The harsh criticism has been matched by later accolades . In 1904 , the Royal Society awarded Cantor its Sylvester Medal , the highest honor it can confer for work in mathematics . David Hilbert defended it from its critics by declaring : 
 From his paradise that Cantor with us unfolded , we hold our breath in awe ; knowing , we shall not be expelled .

 = = = Youth and studies = = = 
 Georg Cantor was born in the western merchant colony in Saint Petersburg , Russia , and brought up in the city until he was eleven . Georg , the oldest of six children , was regarded as an outstanding violinist . His grandfather Franz Böhm ( 1788 – 1846 ) ( the violinist Joseph Böhm 's brother ) was a well @-@ known musician and soloist in a Russian imperial orchestra . Cantor 's father had been a member of the Saint Petersburg stock exchange ; when he became ill , the family moved to Germany in 1856 , first to Wiesbaden then to Frankfurt , seeking winters milder than those of Saint Petersburg . In 1860 , Cantor graduated with distinction from the Realschule in Darmstadt ; his exceptional skills in mathematics , trigonometry in particular , were noted . In 1862 , Cantor entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic . After receiving a substantial inheritance upon his father 's death in 1863 , Cantor shifted his studies to the University of Berlin , attending lectures by Leopold Kronecker , Karl Weierstrass and Ernst Kummer . He spent the summer of 1866 at the University of Göttingen , then and later a center for mathematical research . 
 = = = Teacher and researcher = = = 
 Cantor submitted his dissertation on number theory at the University of Berlin in 1867 . After teaching briefly in a Berlin girls ' school , Cantor took up a position at the University of Halle , where he spent his entire career . He was awarded the requisite habilitation for his thesis , also on number theory , which he presented in 1869 upon his appointment at Halle . 
 In 1874 , Cantor married Vally Guttmann . They had six children , the last ( Rudolph ) born in 1886 . Cantor was able to support a family despite modest academic pay , thanks to his inheritance from his father . During his honeymoon in the Harz mountains , Cantor spent much time in mathematical discussions with Richard Dedekind , whom he had met two years earlier while on Swiss holiday . 
 Cantor was promoted to Extraordinary Professor in 1872 and made full Professor in 1879 . To attain the latter rank at the age of 34 was a notable accomplishment , but Cantor desired a chair at a more prestigious university , in particular at Berlin , at that time the leading German university . However , his work encountered too much opposition for that to be possible . Kronecker , who headed mathematics at Berlin until his death in 1891 , became increasingly uncomfortable with the prospect of having Cantor as a colleague , perceiving him as a " <unk> of youth " for teaching his ideas to a younger generation of mathematicians . Worse yet , Kronecker , a well @-@ established figure within the mathematical community and Cantor 's former professor , disagreed fundamentally with the thrust of Cantor 's work . Kronecker , now seen as one of the founders of the constructive viewpoint in mathematics , disliked much of Cantor 's set theory because it asserted the existence of sets satisfying certain properties , without giving specific examples of sets whose members did indeed satisfy those properties . Cantor came to believe that Kronecker 's stance would make it impossible for him ever to leave Halle . 
 In 1881 , Cantor 's Halle colleague Eduard Heine died , creating a vacant chair . Halle accepted Cantor 's suggestion that it be offered to Dedekind , Heinrich M. Weber and Franz Mertens , in that order , but each declined the chair after being offered it . Friedrich <unk> was eventually appointed , but he was never close to Cantor . 
 In 1882 , the mathematical correspondence between Cantor and Richard Dedekind came to an end , apparently as a result of Dedekind 's declining the chair at Halle . Cantor also began another important correspondence , with Gösta Mittag @-@ Leffler in Sweden , and soon began to publish in Mittag @-@ Leffler 's journal Acta Mathematica . But in 1885 , Mittag @-@ Leffler was concerned about the philosophical nature and new terminology in a paper Cantor had submitted to Acta . He asked Cantor to withdraw the paper from Acta while it was in proof , writing that it was " ... about one hundred years too soon . " Cantor complied , but then curtailed his relationship and correspondence with Mittag @-@ Leffler , writing to a third party : 
 Had Mittag @-@ Leffler had his way , I should have to wait until the year 1984 , which to me seemed too great a demand ! ... But of course I never want to know anything again about Acta Mathematica . 
 Cantor suffered his first known bout of depression in 1884 . Criticism of his work weighed on his mind : every one of the fifty @-@ two letters he wrote to Mittag @-@ Leffler in 1884 mentioned Kronecker . A passage from one of these letters is revealing of the damage to Cantor 's self @-@ confidence : 
 ... I don 't know when I shall return to the continuation of my scientific work . At the moment I can do absolutely nothing with it , and limit myself to the most necessary duty of my lectures ; how much happier I would be to be scientifically active , if only I had the necessary mental freshness . 
 This crisis led him to apply to lecture on philosophy rather than mathematics . He also began an intense study of Elizabethan literature thinking there might be evidence that Francis Bacon wrote the plays attributed to Shakespeare ( see Shakespearean authorship question ) ; this ultimately resulted in two pamphlets , published in 1896 and 1897 . 
 Cantor recovered soon thereafter , and subsequently made further important contributions , including his diagonal argument and theorem . However , he never again attained the high level of his remarkable papers of 1874 – 84 . He eventually sought , and achieved , a reconciliation with Kronecker . Nevertheless , the philosophical disagreements and difficulties dividing them persisted . 
 In 1890 , Cantor was instrumental in founding the Deutsche Mathematiker @-@ Vereinigung and chaired its first meeting in Halle in 1891 , where he first introduced his diagonal argument ; his reputation was strong enough , despite Kronecker 's opposition to his work , to ensure he was elected as the first president of this society . Setting aside the animosity Kronecker had displayed towards him , Cantor invited him to address the meeting , but Kronecker was unable to do so because his wife was dying from injuries sustained in a skiing accident at the time .

 After Cantor 's 1884 hospitalization , there is no record that he was in any sanatorium again until 1899 . Soon after that second hospitalization , Cantor 's youngest son Rudolph died suddenly ( while Cantor was delivering a lecture on his views on Baconian theory and William Shakespeare ) , and this tragedy drained Cantor of much of his passion for mathematics . Cantor was again hospitalized in 1903 . One year later , he was outraged and agitated by a paper presented by Julius König at the Third International Congress of Mathematicians . The paper attempted to prove that the basic tenets of transfinite set theory were false . Since the paper had been read in front of his daughters and colleagues , Cantor perceived himself as having been publicly humiliated . Although Ernst Zermelo demonstrated less than a day later that König 's proof had failed , Cantor remained shaken , and momentarily questioning God . Cantor suffered from chronic depression for the rest of his life , for which he was excused from teaching on several occasions and repeatedly confined in various sanatoria . The events of 1904 preceded a series of hospitalizations at intervals of two or three years . He did not abandon mathematics completely , however , lecturing on the paradoxes of set theory ( Burali @-@ Forti paradox , Cantor 's paradox , and Russell 's paradox ) to a meeting of the Deutsche Mathematiker – Vereinigung in 1903 , and attending the International Congress of Mathematicians at Heidelberg in 1904 . 
 In 1911 , Cantor was one of the distinguished foreign scholars invited to attend the 500th anniversary of the founding of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland . Cantor attended , hoping to meet Bertrand Russell , whose newly published Principia Mathematica repeatedly cited Cantor 's work , but this did not come about . The following year , St. Andrews awarded Cantor an honorary doctorate , but illness precluded his receiving the degree in person . 
 Cantor retired in 1913 , living in poverty and suffering from malnourishment during World War I. The public celebration of his 70th birthday was canceled because of the war . He died on January 6 , 1918 in the sanatorium where he had spent the final year of his life . 
 = = Mathematical work = = 
 Cantor 's work between 1874 and 1884 is the origin of set theory . Prior to this work , the concept of a set was a rather elementary one that had been used implicitly since the beginning of mathematics , dating back to the ideas of Aristotle . No one had realized that set theory had any nontrivial content . Before Cantor , there were only finite sets ( which are easy to understand ) and " the infinite " ( which was considered a topic for philosophical , rather than mathematical , discussion ) . By proving that there are ( infinitely ) many possible sizes for infinite sets , Cantor established that set theory was not trivial , and it needed to be studied . Set theory has come to play the role of a foundational theory in modern mathematics , in the sense that it interprets propositions about mathematical objects ( for example , numbers and functions ) from all the traditional areas of mathematics ( such as algebra , analysis and topology ) in a single theory , and provides a standard set of axioms to prove or disprove them . The basic concepts of set theory are now used throughout mathematics . 
 In one of his earliest papers , Cantor proved that the set of real numbers is " more numerous " than the set of natural numbers ; this showed , for the first time , that there exist infinite sets of different sizes . He was also the first to appreciate the importance of one @-@ to @-@ one correspondences ( hereinafter denoted " 1 @-@ to @-@ 1 correspondence " ) in set theory . He used this concept to define finite and infinite sets , subdividing the latter into denumerable ( or countably infinite ) sets and uncountable sets ( <unk> infinite sets ) . 
 Cantor developed important concepts in topology and their relation to cardinality . For example , he showed that the Cantor set is nowhere dense , but has the same cardinality as the set of all real numbers , whereas the rationals are everywhere dense , but countable . 
 Cantor introduced fundamental constructions in set theory , such as the power set of a set A , which is the set of all possible subsets of A. He later proved that the size of the power set of A is strictly larger than the size of A , even when A is an infinite set ; this result soon became known as Cantor 's theorem . Cantor developed an entire theory and arithmetic of infinite sets , called cardinals and ordinals , which extended the arithmetic of the natural numbers . His notation for the cardinal numbers was the Hebrew letter <formula> ( aleph ) with a natural number subscript ; for the ordinals he employed the Greek letter ω ( omega ) . This notation is still in use today . 
 The Continuum hypothesis , introduced by Cantor , was presented by David Hilbert as the first of his twenty @-@ three open problems in his address at the 1900 International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris . Cantor 's work also attracted favorable notice beyond Hilbert 's celebrated encomium . The US philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce praised Cantor 's set theory , and , following public lectures delivered by Cantor at the first International Congress of Mathematicians , held in Zurich in 1897 , Hurwitz and <unk> also both expressed their admiration . At that Congress , Cantor renewed his friendship and correspondence with Dedekind . From 1905 , Cantor corresponded with his British admirer and translator Philip Jourdain on the history of set theory and on Cantor 's religious ideas . This was later published , as were several of his expository works . 
 = = = Number theory , trigonometric series and ordinals = = = 
 Cantor 's first ten papers were on number theory , his thesis topic . At the suggestion of Eduard Heine , the Professor at Halle , Cantor turned to analysis . Heine proposed that Cantor solve an open problem that had eluded Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet , Rudolf Lipschitz , Bernhard Riemann , and Heine himself : the uniqueness of the representation of a function by trigonometric series . Cantor solved this difficult problem in 1869 . It was while working on this problem that he discovered transfinite ordinals , which occurred as indices n in the nth derived set Sn of a set S of zeros of a trigonometric series . Given a trigonometric series f ( x ) with S as its set of zeros , Cantor had discovered a procedure that produced another trigonometric series that had S1 as its set of zeros , where S1 is the set of limit points of S. If Sk + 1 is the set of limit points of Sk , then he could construct a trigonometric series whose zeros are Sk + 1 . Because the sets Sk were closed , they contained their Limit points , and the intersection of the infinite decreasing sequence of sets S , S1 , S2 , S3 , ... formed a limit set , which we would now call Sω , and then he noticed that Sω would also have to have a set of limit points Sω + 1 , and so on . He had examples that went on forever , and so here was a naturally occurring infinite sequence of infinite numbers ω , ω + 1 , ω + 2 , ... 
 Between 1870 and 1872 , Cantor published more papers on trigonometric series , and also a paper defining irrational numbers as convergent sequences of rational numbers . Dedekind , whom Cantor befriended in 1872 , cited this paper later that year , in the paper where he first set out his celebrated definition of real numbers by Dedekind cuts . While extending the notion of number by means of his revolutionary concept of infinite cardinality , Cantor was paradoxically opposed to theories of infinitesimals of his contemporaries Otto Stolz and Paul du Bois @-@ Reymond , describing them as both " an abomination " and " a cholera bacillus of mathematics " . Cantor also published an erroneous " proof " of the inconsistency of infinitesimals . 
 = = = Set theory = = = 
 The beginning of set theory as a branch of mathematics is often marked by the publication of Cantor 's 1874 article , " Über eine <unk> des <unk> aller <unk> algebraischen Zahlen " ( " On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers " ) . This article was the first to provide a rigorous proof that there was more than one kind of infinity . Previously , all infinite collections had been implicitly assumed to be <unk> ( that is , of " the same size " or having the same number of elements ) . Cantor proved that the collection of real numbers and the collection of positive integers are not <unk> . In other words , the real numbers are not countable . His proof differs from diagonal argument that he gave in 1891 . Cantor 's article also contains a new method of constructing transcendental numbers . Transcendental numbers were first constructed by Joseph Liouville in 1844 . 
 Cantor established these results using two constructions . His first construction shows how to write the real algebraic numbers as a sequence a1 , a2 , a3 , .... In other words , the real algebraic numbers are countable . Cantor starts his second construction with any sequence of real numbers . Using this sequence , he constructs nested intervals whose intersection contains a real number not in the sequence . Since every sequence of real numbers can be used to construct a real not in the sequence , the real numbers cannot be written as a sequence – that is , the real numbers are not countable . By applying his construction to the sequence of real algebraic numbers , Cantor produces a transcendental number . Cantor points out that his constructions prove more – namely , they provide a new proof of Liouville 's theorem : Every interval contains infinitely many transcendental numbers . Cantor 's next article contains a construction that proves the set of transcendental numbers has the same " power " ( see below ) as the set of real numbers . 
 Between 1879 and 1884 , Cantor published a series of six articles in Mathematische Annalen that together formed an introduction to his set theory . At the same time , there was growing opposition to Cantor 's ideas , led by Kronecker , who admitted mathematical concepts only if they could be constructed in a finite number of steps from the natural numbers , which he took as intuitively given . For Kronecker , Cantor 's hierarchy of infinities was inadmissible , since accepting the concept of actual infinity would open the door to paradoxes which would challenge the validity of mathematics as a whole . Cantor also introduced the Cantor set during this period . 
 The fifth paper in this series , " Grundlagen einer <unk> <unk> " ( " Foundations of a General Theory of Aggregates " ) , published in 1883 , was the most important of the six and was also published as a separate monograph . It contained Cantor 's reply to his critics and showed how the transfinite numbers were a systematic extension of the natural numbers . It begins by defining well @-@ ordered sets . Ordinal numbers are then introduced as the order types of well @-@ ordered sets . Cantor then defines the addition and multiplication of the cardinal and ordinal numbers . In 1885 , Cantor extended his theory of order types so that the ordinal numbers simply became a special case of order types . 
 In 1891 , he published a paper containing his elegant " diagonal argument " for the existence of an uncountable set . He applied the same idea to prove Cantor 's theorem : the cardinality of the power set of a set A is strictly larger than the cardinality of A. This established the richness of the hierarchy of infinite sets , and of the cardinal and ordinal arithmetic that Cantor had defined . His argument is fundamental in the solution of the <unk> problem and the proof of Gödel 's first incompleteness theorem . Cantor wrote on the Goldbach conjecture in 1894 . 
 In 1895 and 1897 , Cantor published a two @-@ part paper in Mathematische Annalen under Felix Klein 's editorship ; these were his last significant papers on set theory . The first paper begins by defining set , subset , etc . , in ways that would be largely acceptable now . The cardinal and ordinal arithmetic are reviewed . Cantor wanted the second paper to include a proof of the continuum hypothesis , but had to settle for <unk> his theory of well @-@ ordered sets and ordinal numbers . Cantor attempts to prove that if A and B are sets with A equivalent to a subset of B and B equivalent to a subset of A , then A and B are equivalent . Ernst Schröder had stated this theorem a bit earlier , but his proof , as well as Cantor 's , was flawed . Felix Bernstein supplied a correct proof in his 1898 PhD thesis ; hence the name Cantor – Bernstein – Schröder theorem . 
 = = = = One @-@ to @-@ one correspondence = = = = 
 Cantor 's 1874 Crelle paper was the first to invoke the notion of a 1 @-@ to @-@ 1 correspondence , though he did not use that phrase . He then began looking for a 1 @-@ to @-@ 1 correspondence between the points of the unit square and the points of a unit line segment . In an 1877 letter to Richard Dedekind , Cantor proved a far stronger result : for any positive integer n , there exists a 1 @-@ to @-@ 1 correspondence between the points on the unit line segment and all of the points in an n @-@ dimensional space . About this discovery Cantor wrote to Dedekind : " Je le <unk> , mais je ne le crois pas ! " ( " I see it , but I don 't believe it ! " ) The result that he found so astonishing has implications for geometry and the notion of dimension . 
 In 1878 , Cantor submitted another paper to Crelle 's Journal , in which he defined precisely the concept of a 1 @-@ to @-@ 1 correspondence , and introduced the notion of " power " ( a term he took from Jakob Steiner ) or " equivalence " of sets : two sets are equivalent ( have the same power ) if there exists a 1 @-@ to @-@ 1 correspondence between them . Cantor defined countable sets ( or denumerable sets ) as sets which can be put into a 1 @-@ to @-@ 1 correspondence with the natural numbers , and proved that the rational numbers are denumerable . He also proved that n @-@ dimensional Euclidean space Rn has the same power as the real numbers R , as does a countably infinite product of copies of R. While he made free use of <unk> as a concept , he did not write the word " countable " until 1883 . Cantor also discussed his thinking about dimension , stressing that his mapping between the unit interval and the unit square was not a continuous one . 
 This paper displeased Kronecker , and Cantor wanted to withdraw it ; however , Dedekind persuaded him not to do so and Weierstrass supported its publication . Nevertheless , Cantor never again submitted anything to Crelle . 
 = = = = Continuum hypothesis = = = = 
 Cantor was the first to formulate what later came to be known as the continuum hypothesis or CH : there exists no set whose power is greater than that of the naturals and less than that of the reals ( or equivalently , the cardinality of the reals is exactly aleph @-@ one , rather than just at least aleph @-@ one ) . Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it , in vain . His inability to prove the continuum hypothesis caused him considerable anxiety . 
 The difficulty Cantor had in proving the continuum hypothesis has been underscored by later developments in the field of mathematics : a 1940 result by Gödel and a 1963 one by Paul Cohen together imply that the continuum hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved using standard Zermelo – Fraenkel set theory plus the axiom of choice ( the combination referred to as " <unk> " ) . 
 = = = = Paradoxes of set theory = = = = 
 Discussions of set @-@ theoretic paradoxes began to appear around the end of the nineteenth century . Some of these implied fundamental problems with Cantor 's set theory program . In an 1897 paper on an unrelated topic , Cesare Burali @-@ Forti set out the first such paradox , the Burali @-@ Forti paradox : the ordinal number of the set of all ordinals must be an ordinal and this leads to a contradiction . Cantor discovered this paradox in 1895 , and described it in an 1896 letter to Hilbert . Criticism mounted to the point where Cantor launched counter @-@ arguments in 1903 , intended to defend the basic tenets of his set theory . 
 In 1899 , Cantor discovered his eponymous paradox : what is the cardinal number of the set of all sets ? Clearly it must be the greatest possible cardinal . Yet for any set A , the cardinal number of the power set of A is strictly larger than the cardinal number of A ( this fact is now known as Cantor 's theorem ) . This paradox , together with Burali @-@ Forti paradox , led Cantor to formulate a concept called limitation of size , according to which the collection of all ordinals , or of all sets , was an " inconsistent multiplicity " that was " too large " to be a set . Such collections later became known as proper classes . 
 One common view among mathematicians is that these paradoxes , together with Russell 's paradox , demonstrate that it is not possible to take a " naive " , or non @-@ axiomatic , approach to set theory without risking contradiction , and it is certain that they were among the motivations for Zermelo and others to produce <unk> of set theory . Others note , however , that the paradoxes do not obtain in an informal view motivated by the iterative hierarchy , which can be seen as explaining the idea of limitation of size . Some also question whether the <unk> formulation of naive set theory ( which was the system directly refuted by the Russell paradox ) is really a faithful interpretation of the <unk> conception . 
 = = Philosophy , religion and Cantor 's mathematics = = 
 The concept of the existence of an actual infinity was an important shared concern within the realms of mathematics , philosophy and religion . Preserving the orthodoxy of the relationship between God and mathematics , although not in the same form as held by his critics , was long a concern of Cantor 's . He directly addressed this intersection between these disciplines in the introduction to his Grundlagen einer <unk> <unk> , where he stressed the connection between his view of the infinite and the philosophical one . To Cantor , his mathematical views were intrinsically linked to their philosophical and theological implications – he identified the Absolute Infinite with God , and he considered his work on transfinite numbers to have been directly communicated to him by God , who had chosen Cantor to reveal them to the world . 
 Debate among mathematicians grew out of opposing views in the philosophy of mathematics regarding the nature of actual infinity . Some held to the view that infinity was an abstraction which was not mathematically legitimate , and denied its existence . Mathematicians from three major schools of thought ( constructivism and its two offshoots , intuitionism and <unk> ) opposed Cantor 's theories in this matter . For <unk> such as Kronecker , this rejection of actual infinity stems from fundamental disagreement with the idea that <unk> proofs such as Cantor 's diagonal argument are sufficient proof that something exists , holding instead that constructive proofs are required . <unk> also rejects the idea that actual infinity is an expression of any sort of reality , but arrive at the decision via a different route than constructivism . Firstly , Cantor 's argument rests on logic to prove the existence of transfinite numbers as an actual mathematical entity , whereas <unk> hold that mathematical entities cannot be reduced to logical propositions , originating instead in the intuitions of the mind . Secondly , the notion of infinity as an expression of reality is itself disallowed in intuitionism , since the human mind cannot intuitively construct an infinite set . Mathematicians such as Brouwer and especially Poincaré adopted an <unk> stance against Cantor 's work . Citing the paradoxes of set theory as an example of its fundamentally flawed nature , Poincaré held that " most of the ideas of <unk> set theory should be banished from mathematics once and for all . " Finally , Wittgenstein 's attacks were <unk> : he believed that Cantor 's diagonal argument conflated the intension of a set of cardinal or real numbers with its extension , thus conflating the concept of rules for generating a set with an actual set . 
 Some Christian theologians saw Cantor 's work as a challenge to the uniqueness of the absolute infinity in the nature of God . In particular , Neo @-@ Thomist thinkers saw the existence of an actual infinity that consisted of something other than God as jeopardizing " God 's exclusive claim to supreme infinity " . Cantor strongly believed that this view was a misinterpretation of infinity , and was convinced that set theory could help correct this mistake : 
 ... the transfinite species are just as much at the disposal of the intentions of the Creator and His absolute boundless will as are the finite numbers . 
 Cantor also believed that his theory of transfinite numbers ran counter to both materialism and determinism – and was shocked when he realized that he was the only faculty member at Halle who did not hold to deterministic philosophical beliefs . 
 In 1888 , Cantor published his correspondence with several philosophers on the philosophical implications of his set theory . In an extensive attempt to persuade other Christian thinkers and authorities to adopt his views , Cantor had corresponded with Christian philosophers such as Tilman Pesch and Joseph <unk> , as well as theologians such as Cardinal Johannes <unk> , who once replied by equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism . Cantor even sent one letter directly to Pope Leo XIII himself , and addressed several pamphlets to him . 
 Cantor 's philosophy on the nature of numbers led him to affirm a belief in the freedom of mathematics to posit and prove concepts apart from the realm of physical phenomena , as expressions within an internal reality . The only restrictions on this metaphysical system are that all mathematical concepts must be devoid of internal contradiction , and that they follow from existing definitions , axioms , and theorems . This belief is summarized in his assertion that " the essence of mathematics is its freedom . " These ideas parallel those of Edmund Husserl , whom Cantor had met in Halle . 
 Meanwhile , Cantor himself was fiercely opposed to infinitesimals , describing them as both an " abomination " and " the cholera bacillus of mathematics " . 
 Cantor 's 1883 paper reveals that he was well aware of the opposition his ideas were encountering : 
 ... I realize that in this undertaking I place myself in a certain opposition to views widely held concerning the mathematical infinite and to opinions frequently defended on the nature of numbers . 
 Hence he devotes much space to justifying his earlier work , asserting that mathematical concepts may be freely introduced as long as they are free of contradiction and defined in terms of previously accepted concepts . He also cites Aristotle , Descartes , Berkeley , Leibniz , and Bolzano on infinity . 
 = = Cantor 's ancestry = = 
 Cantor 's paternal grandparents were from Copenhagen , and fled to Russia from the disruption of the Napoleonic Wars . There is very little direct information on his grandparents . Cantor was sometimes called Jewish in his lifetime , but has also variously been called Russian , German , and Danish as well . 
 Jakob Cantor , Cantor 's grandfather , gave his children Christian saints ' names . Further , several of his grandmother 's relatives were in the Czarist civil service , which would not welcome Jews , unless they converted to Christianity . Cantor 's father , Georg Waldemar Cantor , was educated in the Lutheran mission in Saint Petersburg , and his correspondence with his son shows both of them as devout Lutherans . Very little is known for sure about George Woldemar 's origin or education . His mother , Maria Anna Böhm , was an Austro @-@ Hungarian born in Saint Petersburg and baptized Roman Catholic ; she converted to Protestantism upon marriage . However , there is a letter from Cantor 's brother Louis to their mother , stating : 
 <unk> wir <unk> von Juden <unk> und ich im Princip noch so sehr für <unk> der <unk> sein , im <unk> Leben sind mir Christen lieber ... 
 ( " Even if we were descended from Jews ten times over , and even though I may be , in principle , completely in favour of equal rights for Hebrews , in social life I prefer Christians ... " ) which could be read to imply that she was of Jewish ancestry . 
 There were documented statements , during the 1930s , that called this Jewish ancestry into question : 
 More often [ i.e. , than the ancestry of the mother ] the question has been discussed of whether Georg Cantor was of Jewish origin . About this it is reported in a notice of the Danish genealogical Institute in Copenhagen from the year 1937 concerning his father : " It is hereby testified that Georg Woldemar Cantor , born 1809 or 1814 , is not present in the registers of the Jewish community , and that he completely without doubt was not a Jew ... " 
 It is also later said in the same document : 
 Also efforts for a long time by the librarian Josef Fischer , one of the best experts on Jewish genealogy in Denmark , charged with identifying Jewish professors , that Georg Cantor was of Jewish descent , finished without result . [ Something seems to be wrong with this sentence , but the meaning seems clear enough . ] In Cantor 's published works and also in his Nachlass there are no statements by himself which relate to a Jewish origin of his ancestors . There is to be sure in the Nachlass a copy of a letter of his brother Ludwig from 18 November 1869 to their mother with some unpleasant antisemitic statements , in which it is said among other things : ... 
 ( the rest of the quote is finished by the very first quote above ) . In Men of Mathematics , Eric Temple Bell described Cantor as being " of pure Jewish descent on both sides , " although both parents were baptized . In a 1971 article entitled " Towards a Biography of Georg Cantor , " the British historian of mathematics Ivor Grattan @-@ Guinness mentions ( Annals of Science 27 , pp. 345 – 391 , 1971 ) that he was unable to find evidence of Jewish ancestry . ( He also states that Cantor 's wife , Vally Guttmann , was Jewish ) . 
 In a letter written by Georg Cantor to Paul Tannery in 1896 ( Paul Tannery , Memoires Scientifique 13 Correspondence , Gauthier @-@ Villars , Paris , 1934 , p . 306 ) , Cantor states that his paternal grandparents were members of the Sephardic Jewish community of Copenhagen . Specifically , Cantor states in describing his father : " Er ist aber in Kopenhagen <unk> , von <unk> <unk> , die der <unk> <unk> <unk> ... " ( " He was born in Copenhagen of Jewish ( lit : " Israelite " ) parents from the local Portuguese @-@ Jewish community . " ) 
 In addition , Cantor 's maternal great uncle , a Hungarian violinist Josef Böhm , has been described as Jewish , which may imply that Cantor 's mother was at least partly descended from the Hungarian Jewish community . 
 In a letter to Bertrand Russell , Cantor described his ancestry and self @-@ perception as follows : 
 Neither my father nor my mother were of German blood , the first being a Dane , borne in Kopenhagen , my mother of Austrian <unk> <unk> . You must know , Sir , that I am not a regular just Germain , for I am born 3 March 1845 at Saint Peterborough , Capital of Russia , but I went with my father and mother and brothers and sister , eleven years old in the year 1856 , into Germany . 
 = = Historiography = = 
 Until the 1970s , the chief academic publications on Cantor were two short monographs by <unk> ( 1927 ) – largely the correspondence with Mittag @-@ Leffler – and Fraenkel ( 1930 ) . Both were at second and third hand ; neither had much on his personal life . The gap was largely filled by Eric Temple Bell 's Men of Mathematics ( 1937 ) , which one of Cantor 's modern biographers describes as " perhaps the most widely read modern book on the history of mathematics " ; and as " one of the worst " . Bell presents Cantor 's relationship with his father as Oedipal , Cantor 's differences with Kronecker as a quarrel between two Jews , and Cantor 's madness as Romantic despair over his failure to win acceptance for his mathematics , and fills the picture with stereotypes . Grattan @-@ Guinness ( 1971 ) found that none of these claims were true , but they may be found in many books of the intervening period , owing to the absence of any other narrative . There are other legends , independent of Bell – including one that labels Cantor 's father a foundling , shipped to Saint Petersburg by unknown parents . A critique of Bell 's book is contained in Joseph Dauben 's biography . Writes Dauben : 
 Cantor devoted some of his most vituperative correspondence , as well as a portion of the Beiträge , to attacking what he described at one point as the ' infinitesimal Cholera bacillus of mathematics ' , which had spread from Germany through the work of Thomae , du Bois Reymond and Stolz , to infect Italian mathematics ... Any acceptance of infinitesimals necessarily meant that his own theory of number was incomplete . Thus to accept the work of Thomae , du Bois @-@ Reymond , Stolz and Veronese was to deny the perfection of Cantor 's own creation . Understandably , Cantor launched a thorough campaign to discredit Veronese 's work in every way possible . 
 = Bottlenose dolphin = 
 Bottlenose dolphins , the genus Tursiops , are the most common and well @-@ known members of the family Delphinidae , the family of oceanic dolphin . Recent molecular studies show the genus contains two species , the common bottlenose dolphin ( Tursiops truncatus ) and the Indo @-@ Pacific bottlenose dolphin ( Tursiops aduncus ) , instead of one . Research in 2011 revealed a third species , the <unk> dolphin ( Tursiops australis ) . Bottlenose dolphins inhabit warm and temperate seas worldwide . 
 Bottlenose dolphins live in groups typically of 10 – 30 members , called pods , but group size varies from single individuals up to more than 1 @,@ 000 . Their diets consist mainly of forage fish . Dolphins often work as a team to harvest fish schools , but they also hunt individually . Dolphins search for prey primarily using echolocation , which is similar to sonar . They emit clicking sounds and listen for the return echos to determine the location and shape of nearby items , including potential prey . Bottlenose dolphins also use sound for communication , including squeaks and whistles emitted from the blowhole and sounds emitted through body language , such as leaping from the water and slapping their tails on the water surface . 
 Numerous investigations of bottlenose dolphin intelligence have been conducted , examining mimicry , use of artificial language , object categorization , and self @-@ recognition . They can use tools ( sponging ) and transmit cultural knowledge across generations , and their considerable intelligence has driven interaction with humans . Bottlenose dolphins are popular from aquarium shows and television programs such as Flipper . They have also been trained by militaries to locate sea mines or detect and mark enemy divers . In some areas , they cooperate with local fishermen by driving fish into their nets and eating the fish that escape . Some encounters with humans are harmful to the dolphins : people hunt them for food , and dolphins are killed inadvertently as a bycatch of tuna fishing and by getting caught in crab traps . 
 Bottlenose dolphins have the second largest encephalization levels of any mammal on Earth ( humans have the largest ) , sharing close ratios with those of humans and other great apes , which more than likely attributes to their incredibly high intelligence and emotional intelligence . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Scientists were long aware that Tursiops dolphins might consist of more than one species . Molecular genetics allowed much greater insight into this previously intractable problem . The IUCN acknowledges two species , although a third distinct species was described in 2011 : the common bottlenose dolphin ( T. truncatus ) is found in most tropical to temperate oceans , and it has a grey color , with the shade of grey varying among populations , but it can be bluish @-@ grey , brownish @-@ grey , or even nearly black , and is often darker on the back from the rostrum to behind the dorsal fin ; the Black Sea bottlenose dolphin ( T. t. <unk> ) , a subspecies of T. truncatus lives in the Black Sea ; The Pacific bottlenose dolphin ( T. <unk> or T. t. <unk> ) , another subspecies of T. truncatus , lives in the Pacific , and has a black line from the eye to the forehead ; the Indo @-@ Pacific bottlenose dolphin ( T. aduncus ) lives in the waters around India , northern Australia , South China , the Red Sea , and the eastern coast of Africa , with the back being dark @-@ grey and the belly being lighter grey or nearly white with grey spots ; the <unk> dolphin ( T. australis ) , found in the Port Phillip and Gippsland Lakes areas of Victoria , Australia , was described in September 2011 after research showed it was distinct from T. truncatus and T. aduncus , but is not considered a separate species by the IUCN . 
 The two ecotypes of the common bottlenose dolphin within the western North Atlantic are represented by the shallower water or coastal ecotype and the more offshore ecotype . Their ranges overlap , but they have been shown to be genetically distinct . They are not currently described , however , as separate species or subspecies . In general , genetic variation between populations is significant , even among nearby populations . As a result of this genetic variation , other distinct species currently considered to be populations of common bottlenose dolphin are possible . 
 Old scientific data do not distinguish between the two species , making it useless for determining structural differences between them . The IUCN lists both species as data deficient on their Red List of endangered species because of this issue . 
 Some recent genetic evidence suggests the Indo @-@ Pacific bottlenose belongs in the genus Stenella , since it is more like the Atlantic spotted dolphin ( Stenella frontalis ) than the common bottlenose . 
 = = = Hybrids = = = 
 Bottlenose dolphins have been known to hybridize with other dolphin species . Hybrids with Risso 's dolphin occur both in the wild and in captivity . The best known is the <unk> , a false killer whale @-@ bottlenose dolphin hybrid . The <unk> is fertile , and two currently live at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii . The first was born in 1985 to a female bottlenose . Wolphins also exist in the wild . In captivity , a bottlenose dolphin and a rough @-@ toothed dolphin hybridized . A common dolphin @-@ bottlenose dolphin hybrid born in captivity lives at SeaWorld California . Other hybrids live in captivity around the world and in the wild , such as a bottlenose dolphin @-@ Atlantic spotted dolphin hybrid . 
 = = Description = = 
 Bottlenose dolphins are grey , varying from dark grey at the top near the dorsal fin to very light grey and almost white at the underside . This countershading makes them hard to see , both from above and below , when swimming . Adults range from 2 to 4 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 to 13 @.@ 1 ft ) , and 150 to 650 kilograms ( 330 to 1 @,@ 430 lb ) . Males are , on average , slightly longer and considerably heavier than females . In most parts of the world , the adults are about 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) , and 200 to 300 kilograms ( 440 to 660 lb ) . Their size varies considerably with habitat . Except in the eastern Pacific , dolphins in warmer , shallower waters tend to be smaller than those in cooler , pelagic waters . 
 Bottlenose dolphins can live for more than 40 years . 
 = = Anatomy = = 
 Their elongated upper and lower jaws form what is called a rostrum , or snout , which gives the animal its common name . The real , functional nose is the blowhole on top of its head ; the nasal septum is visible when the blowhole is open . 
 Bottlenose dolphins have 18 to 28 conical teeth on each side of each jaw . 
 The flukes ( lobes of the tail ) and dorsal fin are formed of dense connective tissue and do not contain bone or muscle . The animal propels itself by moving the flukes up and down . The pectoral flippers ( at the sides of the body ) are for steering ; they contain bones homologous to the forelimbs of land mammals . A bottlenose dolphin discovered in Japan has two additional pectoral fins , or " hind legs " , at the tail , about the size of a human 's pair of hands . Scientists believe a mutation caused the ancient trait to reassert itself as a form of atavism . 
 = = Physiology and senses = = 
 In colder waters , they have more body fat and blood , and are more suited to deeper diving . Typically , 18 % – 20 % of their bodyweight is blubber . Most research in this area has been restricted to the North Atlantic Ocean . Bottlenose dolphins typically swim at 5 to 11 km / h ( 1 @.@ 4 to 3 @.@ 1 m / s ) , but are capable of bursts of up to 29 to 35 km / h ( 8 @.@ 1 to 9 @.@ 7 m / s ) . The higher speeds can only be sustained for a short time .

 The dolphin 's search for food is aided by a form of sonar known as echolocation : it locates objects by producing sounds and listening for the echos . A broadband burst pulse of clicking sounds is emitted in a focused beam in front of the dolphin . To hear the returning echo , they have two small ear openings behind the eyes , but most sound waves are transmitted to the inner ear through the lower jaw . As the object of interest is approached , the echo grows louder , and the dolphins adjust by decreasing the intensity of the emitted sounds . ( This contrasts with bats and sonar , which reduce sensitivity of the sound receptor . ) The <unk> interval also decreases as the animal nears the target . Evidently , the dolphin waits for each click 's echo before clicking again . Echolocation details , such as signal strength , spectral qualities , and discrimination , are well @-@ understood by researchers . Bottlenose dolphins are also able to extract shape information , suggesting they are able to form an " <unk> image " or sound picture of their targets . 
 Dolphins have sharp eyesight . The eyes are located at the sides of the head and have a tapetum lucidum , or reflecting membrane , at the back of the retina , which aids vision in dim light . Their horseshoe @-@ shaped , double @-@ slit pupils enable dolphins to have good vision both in air and underwater , despite the different indices of refraction of these media . When under water , the eyeball 's lens serves to focus light , whereas in the in @-@ air environment , the typically bright light serves to contract the specialized pupil , resulting in sharpness from a smaller aperture ( similar to a pinhole camera ) . 
 By contrast , a bottlenose 's sense of smell is poor , because its blowhole , the analogue to the nose , is closed when underwater and it opens only for breathing . It has no olfactory nerves or olfactory lobe in the brain . Bottlenose dolphins are able to detect salty , sweet , bitter ( quinine sulphate ) , and sour ( citric acid ) tastes , but this has not been well @-@ studied . Anecdotally , some individuals in captivity have been noted to have preferences for food fish types , although it is not clear if taste mediates this preference . 
 = = = Communication = = = 
 Bottlenose dolphins communicate through burst pulsed sounds , whistles , and body language . Examples of body language include leaping out of the water , snapping jaws , slapping the tail on the surface and butting heads . Sounds and gestures help keep track of other dolphins in the group , and alert other dolphins to danger and nearby food . Lacking vocal cords , they produce sounds using six air sacs near their blow hole . Each animal has a uniquely identifying , frequency @-@ modulated narrow @-@ band signature vocalization ( signature whistle ) . 
 Researchers from the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute ( <unk> ) , based in Sardinia ( Italy ) have now shown whistles and burst pulsed sounds are vital to the animals ' social life and mirror their behaviors . 
 The tonal whistle sounds ( the most melodious ones ) allow dolphins to stay in contact with each other ( above all , mothers and offspring ) , and to coordinate hunting strategies . The burst @-@ pulsed sounds ( which are more complex and varied than the whistles ) are used " to avoid physical aggression in situations of high excitement " , such as when they are competing for the same piece of food , for example . The dolphins emit these strident sounds when in the presence of other individuals moving towards the same prey . The " least dominant " one soon moves away to avoid confrontation . 
 Other communication uses about 30 distinguishable sounds , and although famously proposed by John Lilly in the 1950s , no " dolphin language " has been found . However , Herman , Richards , and <unk> demonstrated comprehension of an artificial language by two bottlenose dolphins ( named <unk> and Phoenix ) in the period of skepticism toward animal language following Herbert Terrace 's critique . 
 = = Intelligence = = 
 = = = Cognition = = = 
 Cognitive abilities that have been investigated include concept formation , sensory skills , and mental representations . Such research has been ongoing since the 1970s . This includes : Acoustic and behavioral mimicry , Comprehension of novel sequences in an artificial language , Memory , Monitoring of self behavior , Discrimination and matching , Comprehension of symbols for various body parts , Comprehension of pointing gestures and gaze ( as made by dolphins or humans ) , Mirror self @-@ recognition , and Numerical values . 
 = = = Tool use and culture = = = 
 At least some wild bottlenose dolphins use tools . In Shark Bay , dolphins place a marine sponge on their rostrum , presumably to protect it when searching for food on the sandy sea bottom . This has only been observed in this bay ( first in 1997 ) , and is predominantly practiced by females . Sea otters are the only other known marine mammalian tool users . A 2005 study showed mothers most likely teach the behavior to their offspring , evincing culture ( behavior learned from other species members ) . 
 Mud plume feeding is a feeding technique performed by a small community of bottlenose dolphins over shallow seagrass beds ( less than 1 m ) in the Florida Keys in the United States . The behavior involves creation of a U @-@ shaped plume of mud in the water column and then rushing through the plume to capture fish . 
 Along the beaches and tidal marshes of South Carolina and Georgia in the United States , bottlenose dolphins cooperatively herd prey fish onto steep and sandy banks in a practice known as " strand feeding " . Groups of between two and six dolphins are regularly observed creating a bow wave to force the fish out of the water . The dolphins follow the fish , stranding themselves briefly , to eat their prey before twisting their bodies back and forth in order to slide back into the water . 
 Some Mauritanian dolphins cooperate with human fishermen . The dolphins drive a school of fish towards the shore , where humans await with nets . In the confusion of casting nets , the dolphins catch a large number of fish as well . <unk> cooperative foraging has also been observed . These behaviors may also be transmitted via teaching . Controversially , Rendell and Whitehead have proposed a structure for the study of cetacean culture . Similar cases have been observed in Laguna , Santa Catarina in Brazil since during 19th century as well . 
 Near Adelaide , in South Australia , three bottlenose dolphins ' tail @-@ walk ' , whereby they elevate the upper part of their bodies vertically out of the water , and propel themselves along the surface with powerful tail movements . Tail @-@ walking mostly arises via human training in <unk> . In the 1980s , a female from the local population was kept at a local dolphinarium for three weeks , and the scientist suggests she copied the tail @-@ walking behavior from other dolphins . Two other wild adult female dolphins have now copied it from her . 
 = = = Cortical neurons = = = 
 Some researchers theorize mammalian intelligence correlates to the number of nerve cells ( neurons ) in the cortex of the brain . The neocortical neuron number of the bottlenose dolphin is unknown . However , the species with the highest number of neocortical neurons known to date is the Long @-@ finned pilot whale . 
 = = Life history = = 
 = = = Respiration and sleep = = = 
 The bottlenose dolphin has a single blowhole located on the dorsal surface of the head consisting of a hole and a muscular flap . The flap is closed during muscle relaxation and opens during contraction . Dolphins are voluntary breathers , who must deliberately surface and open their blowholes to get air . They can store almost twice as much oxygen in proportion to their body weight as a human can : the dolphin can store 36 milliliters ( ml ) of oxygen per kg of body weight , compared with 20 ml per kg for humans . This is an adaptation to diving . The bottlenose dolphin typically rises to the surface to breathe through its blowhole two to three times per minute , although it can remain submerged for up to 20 minutes . 
 Dolphins can breathe while " half @-@ asleep " . During the sleeping cycle , one brain hemisphere remains active , while the other hemisphere shuts down . The active hemisphere handles surfacing and breathing behavior . The daily sleeping cycle lasts for about 8 hours , in increments of minutes to hours . During the sleeping cycle , they remain near the surface , swimming slowly or " logging " , and occasionally closing one eye . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Both sexes have genital slits on the underside of their bodies . The male can retract and conceal his penis through his slit . The female 's slit houses her vagina and anus . Females have two mammary slits , each housing one nipple , one on each side of the genital slit . The ability to stow their reproductive organs ( especially in males ) allows for maximum hydrodynamics . The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males . At that time , the testes enlarge , enabling them to hold more sperm . Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor 's sperm , while leaving some of his own for fertilization . Also , sperm concentration markedly increases . Having less sperm for out @-@ of @-@ season social mating means it wastes less . This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive . Males have large testes in relation to their body size . 
 During the breeding season , males compete for access to females . Such competition can take the form of fighting other males or of herding females to prevent access by other males . In Shark Bay , male bottlenose dolphins have been observed working in pairs or larger groups to follow and / or restrict the movement of a female for weeks at a time , waiting for her to become sexually receptive . These coalitions , also known as male reproductive alliances , will fight with other coalitions for control of females . 
 Mating occurs belly to belly . Dolphins have been observed engaging in intercourse when the females are not in their estrous cycles and cannot produce young , suggesting they may mate for pleasure . The gestation period averages 12 months . Births can occur at any time of year , although peaks occur in warmer months . The young are born in shallow water , sometimes assisted by a ( possibly male ) " midwife " , and usually only a single calf is born . Twins are possible , but rare . Newborn bottlenose dolphins are 0 @.@ 8 to 1 @.@ 4 m ( 2 @.@ 6 to 4 @.@ 6 ft ) long and weigh 9 to 30 kg ( 20 to 66 lb ) , with Indo @-@ Pacific bottlenose dolphin infants being generally smaller than common bottlenose dolphin infants . To accelerate nursing , the mother can eject milk from her mammary glands . The calf suckles for 18 months to up to 8 years , and continues to closely associate with its mother for several years after weaning . Females sexually mature at ages 5 – 13 , males at ages 9 – 14 . Females reproduce every two to six years . Georgetown University professor Janet Mann argues the strong personal behavior among male calves is about bond formation and benefits the species in an evolutionary context . She cites studies showing these dolphins as adults are inseparable , and that early bonds aid protection , as well as in locating females . 
 = = = Social interaction = = = 
 Adult males live mostly alone or in groups of two to three , and join pods for short periods of time . Adult females and young dolphins normally live in groups of up to 15 animals . However , they live in fission @-@ fusion societies of varying group size , within which individuals change associations , often on a daily or hourly basis . Group compositions are usually determined by sex , age , reproductive condition , familial relations and affiliation histories . In a dolphin community near Sarasota , Florida , the most common group types are adults females with their recent offspring , older subadults of both sexes and adult males either alone or in bonded pairs . Smaller groups can join to form larger groups of 100 or more , and occasionally exceed 1 @,@ 000 . The social strategies of marine mammals such as bottlenose dolphins " provide interesting parallels " with the social strategies of elephants and chimpanzees . 
 Bottlenose dolphins studied by Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute researchers off the island of Sardinia show random social behavior while feeding , and their social behavior does not depend on feeding activity . In Sardinia , the presence of a floating marine fin @-@ fish farm has been linked to a change in bottlenose dolphin distribution as a result of high fish density around the floating cages in the farming area . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 A dolphin 's diet consists mainly of small fish , crustaceans , and squid . Although this varies by location , many populations share an appetite for fish from the mullet , the tuna and mackerel , and the drum and croaker families . Its cone @-@ like teeth serve to grasp , but do not chew food . When they encounter a shoal of fish , they work as a team to herd them towards the shore to maximize the harvest . They also hunt alone , often targeting bottom @-@ dwelling species . The bottlenose dolphin sometimes hits a fish with its fluke , sometimes knocking it out of the water , using a strategy called " fish whacking " . " Strand feeding " , is an inherited feeding technique used by bottlenose dolphins near and around coastal regions of Georgia and South Carolina . When a pod finds a school of fish , they will circle the school and trap the fish in a mini whirlpool . Then , the dolphins will charge at the school and push their bodies up onto a mud @-@ flat , forcing the fish on the mud @-@ flat , as well . The dolphins then crawl around on their sides , consuming the fish they washed up on shore . 
 One type of feeding behavior seen in bottlenose dolphins is mud ring feeding . 
 Bottlenose dolphins conflict with small @-@ scale coastal commercial fisheries in some Mediterranean areas . Common bottlenose dolphins are probably attracted to fishing nets because they offer a concentrated food source . 
 = = = Relations with other species = = = 
 Dolphins can exhibit altruistic behaviour toward other sea creatures . On <unk> Beach , New Zealand , on March 10 , 2008 , two pygmy sperm whales , a female and calf , stranded on the beach . Rescuers , including Department of Conservation officer Malcolm Smith , attempted to refloat them four times . Shortly , a playful bottlenose dolphin known to local residents as Moko arrived and , after apparently vocalizing at the whales , led them 200 m ( 660 ft ) along a sandbar to the open sea , saving them from imminent euthanasia . 
 The bottlenose dolphin can behave aggressively . Males fight for rank and access to females . During mating season , males compete vigorously with each other through displays of toughness and size , with a series of acts , such as head @-@ butting . They display aggression towards sharks and smaller dolphin species . At least one population , off Scotland , has practiced infanticide , and also has attacked and killed harbour porpoises . University of Aberdeen researchers say the dolphins do not eat their victims , but are simply competing for food . However , Dr. Read of Duke University , a porpoise expert researching similar cases of porpoise killings that had occurred in Virginia in 1996 and 1997 , holds a different view . He states dolphins and porpoises feed on different types of fish , thus food competition is an unlikely cause of the killings . Similar behaviour has been observed in Ireland . In the first half of July , 2014 , four attacks with three Porpoise fatalities were observed and caught on video by the Cardigan Bay Marine Wildlife Centre in the Cardigan Bay . 
 The bottlenose dolphin sometimes forms mixed species groups with other species from the dolphin family , particularly larger species , such as the short @-@ finned pilot whale , the false killer whale and Risso 's dolphin . They also interact with smaller species , such as the Atlantic spotted dolphin and the rough @-@ toothed dolphin . While interactions with smaller species are sometimes affiliative , they can also be hostile . 
 = = = Predators = = = 
 Some large shark species , such as the tiger shark , the dusky shark , the great white shark and the bull shark , prey on the bottlenose dolphin , especially calves . The bottlenose dolphin is capable of defending itself by charging the predator ; dolphin ' mobbing ' behavior of sharks can occasionally prove fatal for the shark . Targeting a single adult dolphin can be dangerous for a shark of similar size . Killer whale populations in New Zealand and Peru have been observed preying on bottlenose dolphins , but this seems rare , and other orcas may swim with dolphins . Swimming in pods allows dolphins to better defend themselves against predators . Bottlenose dolphins either use complex evasive strategies to <unk> their predators , or mobbing techniques to batter the predator to death or force it to flee . 
 = = Relation to humans = = 
 = = = Interaction = = = 
 The species sometimes shows curiosity towards humans in or near water . Occasionally , they rescue injured divers by raising them to the surface . They also do this to help injured members of their own species . In November 2004 , a dramatic report of dolphin intervention came from New Zealand . Four lifeguards , swimming 100 m ( 330 ft ) off the coast near <unk> , were approached by a shark ( reportedly a great white shark ) . Bottlenose dolphins herded the swimmers together and surrounded them for 40 minutes , preventing the shark from attacking , as they slowly swam to shore . 
 In coastal regions , dolphins run the risk of colliding with boats . Researchers of the Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute first quantified data about solitary bottlenose dolphin diving behavior in the presence and absence of boats . Dolphins responded more to tourist than fishing vessels . Driving behavior , speed , engine type and separation distance all affect dolphin safety . However , dolphins in these areas can also coexist with humans . For example , in the town of Laguna in south Brazil , a pod of bottlenose dolphins drives fish towards fishermen who stand at the beach in shallow waters . One dolphin then rolls over , after which the fishermen throw out their nets . The dolphins feed on the escaping fish . The dolphins were not trained for this behavior ; the collaboration began before 1847 . Similar cooperative fisheries also exist in Mauritania , Africa . 
 Commercial ' dolphin encounter ' enterprises and tours operate in many countries . The documentary film " the Cove " documents how dolphins are captured and sold to these enterprises while the remaining pod is slaughtered . In addition to such endeavors , the individuals swim with and surface near surfers at the beach . Bottlenose dolphins perform in many aquaria , generating much controversy . Animal welfare activists and scientists have claimed that the dolphins do not have adequate space or receive adequate care or stimulation . However , others , notably SeaWorld , counter that the dolphins are properly cared for and enjoy interacting with humans . 
 Eight bottlenose dolphins that lived at the Marine Life Aquarium in Gulfport , Mississippi were swept away from their aquarium pool during Hurricane Katrina . They were later found and returned to captivity from the Gulf of Mexico . 
 The military of the United States and Russia train bottlenose dolphins as military dolphins for wartime tasks , such as locating sea mines and detecting enemy divers . The U.S. ' s program is the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program , located in San Diego . 
 = = = Cultural influence = = = 
 The popular television show Flipper , created by Ivan Tors , portrayed a bottlenose dolphin in a friendly relationship with two boys , Sandy and Bud . A seagoing Lassie , Flipper understood English and was a hero : " Go tell Dad we 're in trouble , Flipper ! Hurry ! " The show 's theme song contains the lyric " no one you see / is smarter than he " . The television show was based on a 1963 film , and was remade as a feature film in 1996 , starring Elijah Wood and Paul Hogan , as well as a second series running from 1995 to 2000 , starring Jessica Alba . 
 Other television appearances by bottlenose dolphins include Dolphin Cove , seaQuest DSV , and The Penguins of Madagascar , in which a dolphin , Doctor <unk> , is a villain . In the HBO movie Zeus and Roxanne , a female bottlenose dolphin befriends a male dog , and in Bermuda Triangle , a girl named Annie ( played by Lisa Jakub ) swims with dolphins . Human and dolphin interaction segments shot on location in the Florida Keys with Dolphin Research Center as seen on a Halloween episode of The Simpsons , Treehouse of Horror XI . 
 Dolphin Tale , directed by Charles Martin Smith , starring Nathan Gamble , Ashley Judd , Harry Connick Jr . , Morgan Freeman , Cozi <unk> and Kris Kristofferson , is based on the real @-@ life story of the dolphin Winter , who was rescued from a crab trap in December 2005 and lost her tail , but has learned to swim with a prosthetic one . Dolphin Tale 2 , a sequel to the 2011 film , featured another dolphin named Hope and an appearance by Bethany Hamilton . The sequel was released on September 12 , 2014 . 
 Bottlenose dolphins have appeared in novels . In The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy and one of its sequels , So Long , and Thanks For All the Fish , the dolphins try to warn humans of Earth 's impending destruction , but their behavior was misinterpreted as playful acrobatics . Bottlenose dolphins are central to David Brin 's series of Uplift Universe novels , particularly <unk> Rising , where they are one of the four Earth species ( along with chimpanzees , gorillas , and dogs ) to have been ' uplifted ' to sentience . Bottlenose dolphins are primary characters in Anne McCaffrey 's <unk> of Pern series , especially The Dolphins of Pern . Bottlenose dolphins are incorporated into the science fiction video game series Ecco the Dolphin . <unk> , a dolphin , is featured in the video game <unk> : The Search for Cetus , helping the boy , Adam , to find the sea king Cetus ( a sperm whale ) , as well as assisting in cleaning up the underwater environment where he lives . 
 T.D. , the Miami Dolphins ' mascot , uses the bottlenose dolphin as its mascot and team logo . 
 Factual descriptions of the dolphins date back into antiquity – the writings of Aristotle , Oppian and Pliny the Elder all mention the species . 
 = = = Threats = = = 
 Bottlenose dolphins are still captured or killed in dolphin drive hunts for their meat , to eliminate competition for fish and for capture for marine parks . Bottlenose dolphins ( and several other dolphin species ) often travel with tuna , and can get caught in tuna nets , which can kill the dolphins . Boycotts of tuna products led to the concept of " dolphin @-@ safe " labeling for fishing methods that avoid endangering dolphins . 
 The man @-@ made chemical perfluorooctanesulfonic acid ( PFOS ) may be compromising the immune system of bottlenose dolphins . PFOS affects the immune system of male mice at a concentration of 91 @.@ 5 ppb , while PFOS has been reported in bottlenose dolphins in excess of 1 ppm . High levels of metal contaminants have been measured in tissues in many areas of the globe . A recent study found high levels of cadmium and mercury in bottlenose dolphins from South Australia , levels which were later found to be associated with kidney malformations , indicating possible health effects of high heavy metal concentrations in dolphins . 
 = = = Conservation = = = 
 Bottlenose dolphins are not endangered . Their future is stable because of their abundance and adaptability . However , specific populations are threatened due to various environmental changes . The population in the Moray Firth in Scotland is estimated to consist of around 190 individuals , and are under threat from from harassment , traumatic injury , water pollution and reduction in food availability . Likewise , an isolated population in Doubtful Sound , New Zealand , is in decline due to calf loss coincident to an increase in warm freshwater discharge into the fjord . Less local climate change , such as increasing water temperature may also play a role but has never been shown to be the case . One of the largest coastal populations of bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay , Western Australia was forecast to be stable with little variation in mortality over time ( <unk> et al . 2016 ) . 
 In US waters , hunting and harassing of marine mammals is forbidden in almost all circumstances , from the passing of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 .

 = French cruiser Edgar Quinet = 
 Edgar Quinet was an armored cruiser of the French Navy , the lead ship of her class . She and her sister ship , Waldeck @-@ Rousseau , were the last class of armored cruiser to be built by the French Navy . Edgar Quinet was laid down in November 1905 , launched in September 1907 , and completed in January 1911 . Armed with a main battery of fourteen 194 @-@ millimeter ( 7 @.@ 6 in ) guns , she was more powerful than most other armored cruisers , but she had entered service more than two years after the first battlecruiser — HMS Invincible — had rendered armored cruisers obsolescent . 
 At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Edgar Quinet participated in the hunt for the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben and then joined the blockade of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy in the Adriatic . She took part in the Battle of Antivari later in August , and the seizure of Corfu in January 1916 , but saw no further action during the war . In 1922 , she evacuated over a thousand civilians from Smyrna during the climax of the Greco @-@ Turkish War . Converted into a training ship in the mid @-@ 1920s , Edgar Quinet ran aground on a rock off the Algerian coast on 4 January 1930 and sank five days later . 
 = = Description = = 
 Edgar Quinet was 158 @.@ 9 meters ( 521 ft ) long overall , with a beam of 21 @.@ 51 m ( 70 @.@ 6 ft ) and a draft of 8 @.@ 41 m ( 27 @.@ 6 ft ) . She displaced 13 @,@ 847 metric tons ( 13 @,@ 628 long tons ; 15 @,@ 264 short tons ) . Her power plant consisted of three triple @-@ expansion engines powered by forty coal @-@ fired Belleville boilers , which were trunked into six funnels in two groups of three . Her engines were rated at 36 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 27 @,@ 000 kW ) and produced a top speed of 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . She had a crew of between 859 and 892 officers and enlisted men . 
 Edgar Quinet was armed with a main battery of fourteen 194 mm ( 7 @.@ 6 in ) 50 @-@ caliber M1902 guns ; four were in twin gun turrets forward and aft , with three single gun turrets on either broadside . The last four guns were mounted in casemates abreast the main and aft conning towers . Close @-@ range defense against torpedo boats was provided by a battery of twenty 9 @-@ pounder guns in casemates in the ship 's hull . She was also equipped with two 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes submerged in the hull . She was protected with a armored belt that was 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick amidships . The gun turrets had 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) thick plating , while the casemates had marginally thinner protection , at 194 mm . The main conning tower had 200 mm thick sides . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Edgar Quinet was laid down at Brest in November 1905 and launched on 21 September 1907 . She was completed in January 1911 and commissioned into the French fleet . The ship was the most powerful armored cruiser completed by France , but she entered service two years after the British battlecruiser HMS Invincible , which rendered the armored cruiser obsolescent as a warship type . 
 In 1913 , Edgar Quinet participated in an international naval demonstration in the Ionian Sea to protest the Balkan Wars . Ships from other navies included in the demonstration were the British pre @-@ dreadnought battleship HMS King Edward VII , the Austro @-@ Hungarian pre @-@ dreadnought SMS Zrínyi , the Italian pre @-@ dreadnought Ammiraglio di Saint Bon , and the German light cruiser SMS Breslau . The most important action of the combined flotilla , which was under the command of British Admiral Cecil Burney , was to blockade the Montenegrin coast . The goal of the blockade was to prevent Serbian reinforcements from supporting the siege at Scutari , where Montenegro had besieged a combined force of Albanians and Ottomans . Pressured by the international blockade , Serbia withdrew its army from Scutari , which was subsequently occupied by a joint Allied ground force . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Edgar Quinet was anchored off Durazzo with the British cruiser HMS Defence and destroyer HMS Grampus and the German Breslau . The ships were moored there in a show of international support for a conference in Scutari over the status of Albania . Edgar Quinet and the armored cruisers Ernest Renan and Jules Michelet were mobilized as the First Light Division and tasked with hunting down the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben and her consort Breslau . These ships , along with a flotilla of twelve destroyers , were to steam to Philippeville on 4 August , but the German cruisers had bombarded the port the previous day . This attack , coupled with reports that suggested the Germans would try to break out of the Mediterranean into the Atlantic , prompted the French high command to send Edgar Quinet and the First Light Division further west , to Algiers . 
 After the German ships escaped to Constantinople , rather than attack the French troop transports from North Africa as had been expected , Edgar Quinet joined the rest of the French fleet in its blockade of the Adriatic Sea , based out of Navarino . The fleet , commanded by Admiral Augustin Boué de Lapeyrère , had assembled by the night of 15 August ; the following morning , it conducted a sweep into the Adriatic and encountered the Austro @-@ Hungarian cruiser SMS Zenta . In the ensuing Battle of Antivari , Zenta was sunk , with no losses on the French side . The French fleet then withdrew due to the threat of Austro @-@ Hungarian U @-@ boats in the area . 
 On 8 January 1916 , Edgar Quinet , her sister Waldeck @-@ Rousseau , Ernest Renan and Jules Ferry embarked a contingent of Chasseurs <unk> ( mountain troops ) to seize the Greek island of Corfu . The cruisers sent the troops ashore on the night of 10 January ; the Greek officials on the island protested the move but offered no resistance .

 Edgar Quinet continued her service in the eastern Mediterranean after the end of the war in 1918 . During the culmination of the Greco @-@ Turkish War that immediately followed World War I , Edgar Quinet rescued 1 @,@ 200 people from the Great Fire of Smyrna in 1922 . In 1925 , Edgar Quinet was converted into a training ship . The work lasted until 1927 , and included the reduction of her armament to ten of her 194 mm guns , the removal of two of her funnels , and a reconstruction of her bridge . Then @-@ Captain François Darlan commanded the ship in 1928 . In 1929 , Edgar Quinet underwent an overhaul ; during this modernization she was fitted with equipment to handle floatplanes for reconnaissance purposes . After returning to service , the ship was assigned as a training ship for cadets from the École Navale ( Naval Academy ) . On 4 January 1930 , Edgar Quinet ran aground off the coast of Algeria west of Oran and proved to be a total loss . She sank five days later . 
 = Hammond organ = 
 The Hammond organ is an electric organ , invented by Laurens Hammond and John M. <unk> and first manufactured in 1935 . Various models have been produced , most of which use sliding drawbars to create a variety of sounds . Until 1975 , Hammond organs generated sound by creating an electric current from rotating a metal tonewheel near an electromagnetic pickup , and then strengthening the signal with an amplifier so that it can drive a speaker cabinet . Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured , and it has been described as one of the most successful organs . The organ is commonly used with , and associated with , the Leslie speaker . 
 The organ was originally marketed and sold by the Hammond Organ Company to churches as a lower @-@ cost alternative to the wind @-@ driven pipe organ , or instead of a piano . It quickly became popular with professional jazz musicians in organ trios , a small group centred on the Hammond organ . Organ trios were hired by jazz club owners , who found that organ trios were a much cheaper alternative to hiring a big band . Jimmy Smith 's use of the Hammond B @-@ 3 , with its additional harmonic percussion feature , inspired a generation of organ players , and its use became more widespread in the 1960s and 1970s in rhythm and blues , rock and reggae , as well as being an important instrument in progressive rock . 
 The Hammond Organ Company struggled financially during the 1970s as they abandoned tonewheel organs and switched to manufacturing instruments using integrated circuits . These instruments were not as popular with musicians as the tonewheels had been , and the company went out of business in 1985 . The Hammond name was purchased by the Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation , which proceeded to manufacture digital simulations of the most popular tonewheel organs . This culminated in the production of the " New B @-@ 3 " in 2002 , which provided an accurate recreation of the original B @-@ 3 organ using modern digital technology . 
 Hammond @-@ Suzuki continues to manufacture a variety of organs for both professional players and churches . Other companies , such as Korg , Roland and Clavia , have also achieved success in providing emulations of the original tonewheel organs . The sound of a tonewheel Hammond can also be emulated using modern software such as Native Instruments B4 . 
 = = Features = = 
 A number of distinctive Hammond organ features are not usually found on other keyboards like the piano or synthesizer . Some are similar to a pipe organ , but others are unique to the instrument . 
 = = = Keyboards and pedalboard = = = 
 Most Hammond organs have two 61 @-@ note ( 5 @-@ octave ) manuals . Each manual is laid out in a similar manner to a piano keyboard , except pressing a key results in the sound continuously playing until it is released . There is no difference in volume regardless of how heavily the key is pressed , so overall volume is controlled by a pedal ( also known as a " swell " or " expression " pedal ) . The keys on each manual have a lightweight action , which allows players to perform rapid passages more easily than on a piano . In contrast to piano and pipe organ keys , Hammond keys have a flat @-@ front profile , commonly referred to as " waterfall " style . Early Hammond console models had sharp edges , but starting with the B @-@ 2 these were rounded , as they were cheaper to manufacture . The M series of <unk> also had waterfall keys ( which has subsequently made them ideal for spares on B @-@ 3s and C @-@ 3s ) , but later models had " diving board " style keys which resembled those found on a church organ . Modern Hammond @-@ Suzuki models use waterfall keys . 
 Hammond console organs come with a wooden pedalboard played with the feet , for bass notes . Most Hammond pedalboards have 25 notes , with the top note a middle C , because Hammond found that on traditional 32 @-@ note pedalboards used in churches , the top seven notes were seldom used . The Hammond Concert models E , RT , RT @-@ 2 , RT @-@ 3 and D @-@ 100 had 32 @-@ note American Guild of Organists ( <unk> ) pedalboards going up to the G above middle C as the top note . The RT @-@ 2 , RT @-@ 3 and D @-@ 100 also contained a separate solo pedal system that had its own volume control and various other features . Spinet models had 12- or 13 @-@ note miniature pedalboards with stamped steel pedals . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The sound on a tonewheel Hammond organ is varied through the manipulation of drawbars . A drawbar is a metal slider that controls the volume of a particular sound component , in a similar way to a <unk> on an audio mixing board . As a drawbar is incrementally pulled out , it increases the volume of its sound . When pushed all the way in , the volume is decreased to zero . 
 The labeling of the drawbar derives from the stop system in pipe organs , in which the physical length of the pipe corresponds to the pitch produced . Most Hammonds contain nine drawbars per manual . The drawbar marked " 8 ' " generates the fundamental of the note being played , the drawbar marked " 16 ' " is an octave below , and the drawbars marked " 4 ' " , " 2 ' " and " 1 ' " are one , two and three octaves above respectively . The other drawbars generate various other harmonics and <unk> of the note . While each individual drawbar generates a relatively pure sound similar to a flute or electronic oscillator , more complex sounds can be created by mixing the drawbars in varying amounts . Some spinet models do not include the two subharmonic drawbars on the lower manual . 
 Some drawbar settings have become well known and associated with certain musicians . A very popular setting is <unk> ( i.e. , with the drawbars labelled " 16 ' " , " 51 / 3 ' " and " 8 ' " fully pulled out ) , and has been identified as the " classic " Jimmy Smith sound . 
 = = = Presets = = = 
 In addition to drawbars , many Hammond tonewheel organ models also include presets , which make predefined drawbar combinations available at the press of a button . Console organs have one octave of reverse colored keys ( naturals are black , sharps and flats are white ) to the left of each manual , with each key activating a preset ; the far left key ( C ) , also known as the cancel key , de @-@ activates all presets , and results in no sound coming from that manual . The two right @-@ most preset keys ( B and B ♭ ) activate the corresponding set of drawbars for that manual , while the other preset keys produce preselected drawbar settings that are internally wired into the preset panel . Presets can be changed by rerouting the associated color @-@ coded wires on the rear of the organ . Some spinet models have flip tabs for presets situated above the manuals . 
 = = = Vibrato and chorus = = = 
 Hammond organs have a built @-@ in vibrato effect that provides a small variation in pitch while a note is being played , and a chorus effect where a note 's sound is combined with another sound at a slightly different and varying pitch . The best known vibrato and chorus system consists of six settings , V1 , V2 , V3 , C1 , C2 and C3 ( i.e. , 3 vibrato and 3 chorus ) , which can be selected via a rotary switch . Vibrato / chorus can be selected for each manual independently . 
 = = = Harmonic Percussion = = = 
 The B @-@ 3 and C @-@ 3 models introduced the concept of " Harmonic Percussion " , which was designed to emulate the percussive sounds of the harp , xylophone and marimba . When selected , this feature plays a decaying second- or third @-@ harmonic overtone when a key is pressed . The selected percussion harmonic fades out , leaving the sustained tones the player selected with the drawbars . The volume of this percussive effect is selectable as either Normal or Soft . Harmonic Percussion <unk> only after all notes have been released , so legato passages sound the effect only on the very first note or chord , making Harmonic Percussion uniquely a " single @-@ trigger , polyphonic " effect 
 = = = Leslie speaker controls = = = 
 Hammond organs may have a console or pedal switch for controlling the rotation speed of a Leslie rotating speaker cabinet that is connected to the organ . The switch allows the player to toggle between fast ( tremolo ) and slow ( chorale ) rotation . The most distinctive effect occurs as the speaker rotation speed changes . The tasteful application of the different Leslie speed sound effects to Hammond organ playing is a distinctive part of the characteristic Hammond sound . 
 = = = Start and Run switches = = = 
 Before a Hammond organ can produce sound , the motor that drives the tonewheels must come up to speed . On most models , starting a Hammond organ involves two switches . The " Start " switch turns a dedicated starter motor , which must run for about 12 seconds . Then , the " Run " switch is turned on for about four seconds . The " Start " switch is then released , whereupon the organ is ready to generate sound . The H @-@ 100 and E @-@ series consoles and L @-@ 100 and T @-@ 100 spinet organs , however , had a self @-@ starting motor that required only a single " On " switch . 
 It is possible to create a pitch bend on the Hammond organ by turning the " Run " switch off and on again . This briefly cuts power to the generators , causing them to run at a slower pace and generate a lower pitch for a short time . Hammond 's New B3 contains similar switches to emulate this effect , though it is a digital instrument . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 The Hammond organ 's technology derives from the <unk> , an instrument created in 1897 by Thaddeus Cahill . The <unk> used revolving electric alternators which generated tones that could be transmitted over wires . The instrument was bulky , because the alternators had to be large enough to generate high voltage for a loud enough signal . The Hammond organ solved this problem by using an amplifier . 
 Laurens Hammond graduated from Cornell University with a mechanical engineering degree in 1916 . By the start of the 1920s he had designed a spring @-@ driven clock , which provided enough sales for him to start his own business , the Hammond Clock Company , in 1928 . As well as clocks , his early inventions included 3D glasses and an automatic bridge table <unk> . However , as the Great Depression continued into the 1930s , sales of the bridge table declined and he decided to look elsewhere for a commercially successful product . Hammond was inspired to create the tonewheel or " phonic wheel " by listening to the moving gears of his electric clocks and the tones produced by them . He gathered pieces from a second @-@ hand piano he had purchased for $ 15 and combined it with a tonewheel generator in a similar form to the <unk> , albeit much shorter and more compact . Since Hammond was not a musician , he asked the company 's assistant treasurer , W. L. Lahey , to help him achieve the desired organ sound . To cut costs , Hammond made a pedalboard with only 25 notes , instead of the standard 32 on church organs , and it quickly became a de facto standard . 
 On April 24 , 1934 , Hammond filed U.S. Patent 1 @,@ 956 @,@ 350 for an " electrical musical instrument " , which was personally delivered to the patent office by <unk> , explaining that they could start production immediately and it would be good for local employment in Chicago . The invention was unveiled to the public in April 1935 and the first model , the Model A , was made available in June of that year . Over 1 @,@ 750 churches purchased a Hammond organ in the first three years of manufacturing , and by the end of the 1930s over 200 instruments were being made each month . For all its subsequent success with professional musicians , the original company did not target its products at that market , principally because Hammond did not think there was enough money in it . It has been estimated that the Hammond Organ Company produced about two million instruments in its lifetime ; these have been described as " probably the most successful electronic organs ever made " . In 1966 , it was estimated that about 50 @,@ 000 churches had installed a Hammond . 
 In 1936 , the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) filed a complaint claiming that the Hammond Company made " false and misleading " claims in advertisements for its organ , including that the Hammond could produce " the entire range of tone coloring of a pipe organ " . The complaint resulted in lengthy hearing proceedings , which featured a series of auditory tests that pitted a Hammond costing about $ 2600 against a $ 75 @,@ 000 Skinner pipe organ in the University of Chicago Rockefeller Chapel . During the auditory tests , sustained tones and excerpts from musical works were played on the electric and pipe organs while a group of musicians and laymen attempted to distinguish between the instruments . While attorneys for Hammond argued that the test listeners were wrong or guessed nearly half the time , witnesses for the FTC claimed that Hammond employees had unfairly manipulated the Skinner organ to sound more like the Hammond . In 1938 , the FTC ordered Hammond to " cease and desist " a number of advertising claims , including that its instrument was equivalent to a $ 10 @,@ 000 pipe organ . After the FTC 's decision , Hammond claimed that the hearings had vindicated his company 's assertions that the organ produced " real " , " fine " , and " beautiful " music , phrases which were each cited in the FTC 's original complaint but not included in the " cease and desist " order . Hammond also claimed that although the hearing was expensive for his company , the proceedings generated so much publicity that " as a result we sold enough extra organs to cover the expense . " 
 A key ingredient to the Hammond organ 's success was the use of dealerships and a sense of community . Several dedicated organ dealers set up business in the United States and there was a bi @-@ monthly newsletter , The Hammond Times , mailed out to subscribers . Advertisements tended to show families centered around the instrument , often with a child playing it , as an attempt to show the organ as a center @-@ point of home life and to encourage children to learn music . 
 = = = <unk> organs = = = 
 Hammond organs , as manufactured by the original company , can be divided into two main groups : 
 Console organs have two 61 @-@ note manuals and a pedalboard of at least two octaves . Most consoles do not have a built @-@ in power amplifier or speakers , so an external amplifier and speaker cabinet is required . 
 Spinet organs have two 44 @-@ note manuals and one octave of pedals , plus an internal power amplifier and set of speakers . 
 = = = = Console organs = = = = 
 The first model in production , in June 1935 , was the Model A. It contained most of the features that came to be standard on all console Hammonds , including two 61 @-@ key manuals , a 25 @-@ key pedalboard , an expression pedal , 12 reverse @-@ color preset keys , two sets of drawbars for each manual , and one for the pedals . 
 To address concerns that the sound of the Hammond was not rich enough to accurately mimic a pipe organ , the model BC was introduced in December 1936 . It included a chorus generator , in which a second tonewheel system added slightly sharp or flat tones to the overall sound of each note . The cabinet was made deeper to accommodate this . Production of the old Model A cases stopped , but the older model continued to be available as the AB until October 1938 . 
 Criticism that the Hammond organ was more aesthetically suitable to the home instead of the church led to the introduction of the model C in September 1939 . It contained the same internals as the AB or BC , but covered on the front and sides by " modesty panels " to allow for modesty while playing in a skirt , often a consideration when a church organ was placed in front of the congregation . The model C did not contain the chorus generator , but had space in the cabinet for it to be fitted . The concurrent model D was a model C with a pre @-@ fitted chorus . Development of the vibrato system took place during the early 1940s , and was put into production shortly after the end of World War II . The various models available were the BV and CV ( vibrato only ) and <unk> and DV ( vibrato and chorus ) . 
 The B @-@ 2 and C @-@ 2 , introduced in 1949 , allowed vibrato to be enabled or disabled on each manual separately . In 1954 , the B @-@ 3 and C @-@ 3 models were introduced with the additional harmonic percussion feature . Despite several attempts by Hammond to replace them , these two models remained popular and stayed in continuous production through early 1975 . 
 To cater more specifically to the church market , Hammond introduced the Concert Model E in July 1937 , which included a full 32 @-@ note pedalboard and four electric switches known as toe pistons , allowing various sounds to be selected by the feet . The model E was replaced by the model RT in 1949 , which retained the full size pedalboard , but otherwise was internally identical to the B and C models . RT @-@ 2 and RT @-@ 3 models subsequently appeared in line with the B @-@ 2 / C @-@ 2 and B @-@ 3 / C @-@ 3 respectively . 
 In 1959 , Hammond introduced the A @-@ 100 series . It was effectively a self @-@ contained version of the B @-@ 3 / C @-@ 3 , with an internal power amplifier and speakers . The organ was manufactured in a variety of different chassis , with the last two digits of the specific model number determining the style and finish of the instrument . For example , A @-@ 105 was " Tudor styling in light oak or walnut , " while the A @-@ 143 was " warm cherry finish , Early American styling " . This model numbering scheme was used for several other series of console and spinet organs that subsequently appeared . The D @-@ 100 series , which provided a self @-@ contained version of the RT @-@ 3 , followed in 1963 . 
 The E @-@ 100 series was a cost @-@ reduced version of the A @-@ 100 introduced in 1965 , with only one set of drawbars per manual , a reduced number of presets , and a slightly different tone generator . This was followed by the H @-@ 100 series , with a redesigned tonewheel generator and various other additional features . Unfortunately , the organ was not particularly well made , and suffered a reputation for being unreliable . Hammond service engineer Harvey Olsen said " When they [ H @-@ 100s ] work , they sound pretty decent . But die @-@ hard enthusiasts won 't touch it . " 
 = = = = Spinet organs = = = = 
 Though the instrument had been originally designed for use in a church , Hammond realized that the amateur home market was a far more lucrative business , and started manufacturing spinet organs in the late 1940s . Outside of the United States , they were manufactured in greater numbers than the consoles , and hence were more widely used . Several different types of M series instruments were produced between 1948 and 1964 ; they contained two 44 @-@ note manuals with one set of drawbars each , and a 12 @-@ note pedalboard . The M model was produced from 1948 to 1951 , the M @-@ 2 from 1951 to 1955 , and the M @-@ 3 from 1955 to 1964 . The M series was replaced by the M @-@ 100 series in 1961 , which used a numbering system to identify the body style and finish as used on earlier console series . It included the same manuals as the M , but increased the pedalboard size to 13 notes , stretching a full octave , and included a number of presets . 
 The L @-@ 100 series entered production at the same time as the M @-@ 100 . It was an economy version , with various cost cutting changes so the organ could retail for under $ 1000 . The vibrato was a simpler circuit than on other consoles and <unk> . Two variations of the vibrato were provided , plus a chorus that mixed various vibrato signals together . The expression pedal , based on a cheaper design , was not as sophisticated as on the other organs . The L @-@ 100 was particularly popular in the UK and sold well , with several notable British musicians using it instead of a B @-@ 3 or C @-@ 3 . 
 The T series , produced from 1968 to 1975 , was the last of the tonewheel spinet organs . Unlike all the earlier Hammond organs , which used vacuum tubes for pre @-@ amplification , amplification , Percussion and Chorus @-@ Vibrato control , the T series used all @-@ solid @-@ state , transistor circuitry , though , unlike the L @-@ 100 , it did include the scanner @-@ vibrato as seen on the B @-@ 3 . Other than the T @-@ 100 series models , all other T @-@ Series models included a built @-@ in rotating Leslie speaker and some included an analog drum machine , while the T @-@ 500 also included a built @-@ in cassette recorder . It was one of the last tonewheel Hammonds produced . 
 = = = Transistor organs = = = 
 In the 1960s , Hammond started making transistor organs . The first organ that bridged the gap between tonewheel and transistor was the X @-@ 66 , introduced in May 1967 . The X @-@ 66 contained just 12 tonewheels , and used electronics for frequency division . It contained separate " vibrato bass " and " vibrato treble " in an attempt to simulate a Leslie speaker . Hammond designed it as the company 's flagship product , in response to market competition and to replace the B @-@ 3 . However , it was considered expensive at $ 9 @,@ 795 and it sold poorly . It did not sound like a B @-@ 3 . 
 Hammond introduced their first integrated circuit ( IC ) model , the Concorde , in 1971 . The company had stopped manufacturing tonewheel organs entirely by 1975 , due to increased financial inefficiency , and switched to making IC models full @-@ time . Console models included the 8000 Aurora ( 1976 ) and <unk> Aurora ( 1977 ) , which contained drawbars and a built @-@ in rotating speaker . Spinet organs included the Romance series , manufactured between 1977 and 1983 . In 1979 , a Japanese offshoot , Nihon Hammond , introduced the X @-@ 5 , a portable solid @-@ state clone of the B @-@ 3 . 
 = = = Hammond @-@ Suzuki = = = 
 Laurens Hammond died in 1973 , and the company struggled to survive , proposing an acquiring of Roland in 1972 , which was turned down . Roland 's <unk> <unk> did not believe it was practical at that point to move the entire manufacturing operation from Chicago to Japan , and also viewed Hammond 's declining sales figures as a problem . Hammond went out of business in 1985 , though servicing and spares continued to be available after this under the name of The Organ Service Company . In early 1986 , the Hammond brand and rights were acquired by Hammond Organ Australia , run by Noel Crabbe . 
 The name was purchased by the Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation in 1989 , who rebranded the company as Hammond @-@ Suzuki . Although nominally a Japanese company , founder Manji Suzuki was a fan of the instrument and retained several former Hammond Organ Company staff for research and development , and ensured that production would partially remain in the United States . The new company produced their own brand of portable organs , including the XB @-@ 2 , XB @-@ 3 and XB @-@ 5 . Sound on Sound 's Rod Spark , a longtime Hammond enthusiast , said these models were " a matter of taste , of course , but I don 't think they 're a patch on the old ones " . 
 In 2002 , Hammond @-@ Suzuki relaunched the B @-@ 3 as the ' New B @-@ 3 ' , a re @-@ creation of the original electromechanical instrument using contemporary electronics and a digital tonewheel simulator . The New B @-@ 3 is constructed to appear like the original B @-@ 3 , and the designers attempted to retain the subtle nuances of the familiar B @-@ 3 sound . Hammond @-@ Suzuki promotional material states that it would be difficult for even an experienced B @-@ 3 player to distinguish between the old and new B @-@ 3 organs . A review of the New B @-@ 3 by Hugh <unk> called it " a true replica of an original B @-@ 3 ... in terms of the look and layout , and the actual sound . " The instrument project nearly stalled after a breakdown in negotiations between Japanese and United States staff , the latter of whom insisted on manufacturing the case in the United States and designing the organ to identical specifications to the original . 
 The company has since released the XK @-@ 3 , a single @-@ manual organ using the same digital tonewheel technology as the New B @-@ 3 . The XK @-@ 3 is part of a modular system that allows an integrated lower manual and pedals to be added . In response to some clones including a variety of vintage keyboards in a single package , Hammond released the SK series of organs , which include grand piano , Rhodes piano , Wurlitzer electronic piano , Hohner Clavinet and samples of wind and brass instruments alongside the standard drawbar and tonewheel emulation . Keyboard Magazine 's Stephen Fortner praised the single manual <unk> , indicated that it gave an accurate sound throughout the range of drawbar settings , and said the organ sound was " fat , warm , utterly authentic " . The XK @-@ 1c model was introduced in early 2014 , which is simply an organ @-@ only version of the <unk> . 
 In the US , Hammond manufactures a number of dedicated console organs , including the B @-@ <unk> and the C @-@ <unk> , and the A @-@ 405 , a Chapel Console Organ . The company has a dedicated Church Advisory Team that provides a consultancy so that churches can choose the most appropriate instrument . 
 = = Speakers = = 
 = = = Tone cabinet = = = 
 The authorized loudspeaker enclosure to use with a console organ was the Hammond Tone Cabinet , which housed an external amplifier and speaker in a box . The cabinet carried a balanced mono signal along with the necessary mains power directly from the organ , using a six @-@ pin cable . Spinet organs contained a built @-@ in power amplifier and loudspeakers , and so did not require a tone cabinet . 
 The tone cabinet was originally the only method of adding reverb to a Hammond organ ; reverb was not fitted to older organs . The most commercially successful tone cabinets were probably the PR series , particularly the 40 @-@ watt <unk> . 
 = = = Leslie speaker = = = 
 Many players prefer to play the Hammond through a rotating speaker cabinet known , after several name changes , as a Leslie speaker , after its inventor Donald J. Leslie . The Leslie system is an integrated speaker / amplifier combination in which sound is emitted by a rotating horn over a stationary treble compression driver , and a rotating baffle beneath a stationary bass woofer . This creates a characteristic sound because of the constantly changing pitch shifts that result from the Doppler effect created by the moving sound sources . 
 The Leslie was originally designed to mimic the complex tones and constantly shifting sources of sound emanating from a large group of ranks in a pipe organ . The effect varies depending on the speed of the rotors , which can be toggled between fast ( tremolo ) and slow ( chorale ) using a console or pedal switch , with the most distinctive effect occurring as the speaker rotation speed changes . The most popular Leslies were the 122 , which accepted a balanced signal suitable for console organs , and the 147 , which accepted an unbalanced signal and could be used for spinet organs with a suitable adapter . The Pro @-@ Line series of Leslies which were made to be portable for gigging bands using solid @-@ state amps were popular during the 1970s . 
 Leslie initially tried to sell his invention to Hammond , but Laurens Hammond was unimpressed and declined to purchase it . Hammond modified their interface connectors to be " Leslie @-@ proof " , but Leslie quickly engineered a workaround . The Leslie company was sold to CBS in 1965 and was finally bought by Hammond in 1980 . Hammond @-@ Suzuki acquired the rights to Leslie in 1992 ; the company currently markets a variety of speakers under this name . As well as faithful reissues of the original 122 speaker , the company announced in 2013 that they would start manufacturing a standalone Leslie simulator in a stomp box . 
 = = Tone generation = = 
 Although they are sometimes included in the category of electronic organs , the majority of Hammond organs are , strictly speaking , electric or electromechanical rather than electronic organs because the sound is produced by moving parts rather than electronic oscillators . 
 The basic component sound of a Hammond organ comes from a tonewheel . Each one rotates in front of an electromagnetic pickup . The variation in the magnetic field induces a small alternating current ( AC ) at a particular frequency , which represents a signal similar to a sine wave . When a key is pressed on the organ , it completes a circuit of nine electrical switches , which are linked to the drawbars . The position of the drawbars , combined with the switches selected by the key pressed , determines which tonewheels are allowed to sound . Every tonewheel is connected to a synchronous motor via a system of gears , which ensures that each note remains at a constant relative pitch to every other . The combined signal from all depressed keys and pedals is fed through to the vibrato system , which is driven by a metal scanner . As the scanner rotates around a set of pickups , it changes the pitch of the overall sound slightly . From here , the sound is sent to the main amplifier , and on to the audio speakers . 
 The Hammond organ makes technical compromises in the notes it generates . Rather than produce harmonics that are exact multiples of the fundamental as in equal temperament , it uses the nearest @-@ available frequencies generated by the tonewheels . The only guaranteed frequency for a Hammond 's tuning is concert A at 440 Hz . 
 <unk> or leakage occurs when the instrument 's magnetic pickups receive the signal from rotating metal tonewheels other than those selected by the organist . Hammond considered crosstalk a defect that required correcting , and in 1963 introduced a new level of resistor – capacitor ( R / C ) filtering to greatly reduce this crosstalk , along with 50 – 60 Hz mains hum . However , the sound of tonewheel crosstalk is now considered part of the signature of the Hammond organ , to the extent that modern digital clones explicitly emulate it . 
 Some Hammond organs have an audible pop or click when a key is pressed . Originally , key click was considered a design defect and Hammond worked to eliminate or at least reduce it with equalization filters . However , many performers liked the percussive effect , and it has been accepted as part of the classic sound . Hammond research and development engineer Alan Young said " the professionals who were playing popular music [ liked ] that the attack was so prominent . And they objected when it was eliminated . " 
 = = Clones and emulation devices = = 
 The original Hammond organ was never designed to be transported regularly . A Hammond B @-@ 3 organ , bench , and pedalboard weighs 425 pounds ( 193 kg ) . This weight , combined with that of a Leslie speaker , makes the instrument cumbersome and difficult to move between venues . Consequently , there has been a demand for a more portable , reliable way of generating the same sound . Electronic and digital keyboards that imitate the sound of the Hammond are often referred to as " <unk> organs " . 
 The first attempts to electronically copy a Hammond appeared in the 1970s , including the Roland VK @-@ 1 and VK @-@ 9 , the Yamaha <unk> and the <unk> Organiser . The Korg CX @-@ 3 ( single manual ) and BX @-@ 3 ( dual manual ) were the first lightweight organs to produce a comparable sound to the original . Sound on Sound 's Gordon Reid said that the CX @-@ 3 " came close to emulating the true depth and passion of a vintage Hammond , " particularly when played through a Leslie speaker . 
 The Roland VK @-@ 7 , introduced in 1997 , attempted to emulate the sound of a Hammond using digital signal processing technology . An updated version , the VK @-@ 8 , which appeared in 2002 , also provided emulations of other vintage keyboards and provided a connector for a Leslie . Clavia introduced the Nord Electro in 2001 ; this used buttons to emulate the physical action of pulling or pushing a drawbar , with an LED graph indicating its current state . Clavia has released several updated versions of the Electro since then , and introduced the Nord Stage with the same technology . The Nord <unk> was Clavia 's first organ with real drawbars . <unk> , founded by former Hammond @-@ Suzuki sales rep Tom <unk> in 2003 , has specialised in Hammond clones , and featured a notable endorsement from Joey DeFrancesco . 
 The Hammond organ has also been emulated in software . The most prominent emulator in this field has been the Native Instruments B4 series , which has been praised for its attention to detail and choice of features . <unk> ( now part of Apple ) has also produced a software emulation , the <unk> . This has led to a Hammond organ module with all controls and features of the original instrument in the Logic Pro audio production suite .

 Early customers of the Hammond included Dr. Albert Schweitzer , Henry Ford , Eleanor Roosevelt and George Gershwin . The instrument was not initially favored by classical organ purists , because the tones of two notes an octave apart were in exact synchronization , as opposed to the slight variation present on a pipe organ . However , the instrument did gradually become popular with jazz players . One of the first performers to use the Hammond organ was Ethel Smith , who was known as the " first lady of the Hammond Organ " . Fats Waller and Count Basie also started using the Hammond . Organist John Medeski thinks the Hammond became " the poor man 's big band " , but because of that , it became more economical to book organ trios . 
 Jimmy Smith began to play Hammond regularly in the 1950s , particularly in his sessions for the Blue Note label between 1956 and 1963 . He eschewed a bass player , and played all the bass parts himself using the pedals , generally using a walking bassline on the pedals in combination with percussive left hand chords . His trio format , composed of organ , guitar and drums , became internationally famous following an appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1957 . Medeski says musicians " were inspired when they heard Jimmy Smith 's records . " " Brother " Jack McDuff switched from piano to Hammond in 1959 , and toured regularly throughout the 1960s and 70s . Keith Emerson was inspired to take up the Hammond by hearing McDuff 's arrangement of " Rock Candy " . 
 Booker T Jones is cited as being the bridge from rhythm and blues to rock . British organist James Taylor said the Hammond " became popular [ in the UK ] when people such as Booker T & The MGs and artists on the Stax Records label came over to London and played gigs . " Matthew Fisher first encountered the Hammond in 1966 having heard the Small Faces ' Ian McLagan playing one . When Fisher asked if he could play it , McLagan told him " They 're yelling out for Hammond players ; why don 't you go out and buy one for yourself ? " Fisher went on to play the organ lines on Procol Harum 's A Whiter Shade Of Pale , which topped the UK charts in the summer of 1967 . Steve Winwood started his musical career with the Spencer Davis Group playing guitar and piano , but he switched to Hammond when he hired one to record " Gimme Some Lovin ' " . 
 Gregg Allman became interested in the Hammond after Mike Finnigan had introduced him to Jimmy Smith 's music , and started to write material with it . His brother Duane specifically requested he play the instrument when forming the Allman Brothers Band , and he was presented with a brand new B @-@ 3 and Leslie <unk> upon joining . Allman recalls the instrument was cumbersome to transport , particularly on flights of stairs , which often required the whole band 's assistance . Author Frank Moriarty considers Allman 's Hammond playing a vital ingredient of the band 's sound . 
 Deep Purple 's Jon Lord became inspired to play the Hammond after hearing Jimmy Smith 's " Walk on the Wild Side " . He modified his Hammond so it could be played through a Marshall stack to get a growling , overdriven sound , which became known as his trademark and he is strongly identified with it . This organ was later acquired by Joey DeFrancesco . Van der Graaf Generator 's Hugh Banton modified his Hammond E @-@ 100 extensively with customised electronics , including the ability to put effects such as distortion on one manual but not the other , and rewiring the motor . The modifications created , in Banton 's own words , " unimaginable sonic chaos . " 
 The Hammond was a key instrument in progressive rock music . Author Edward Macan thinks this is because of its versatility , allowing both chords and lead lines to be played , and a choice between quiet and clean , and what Emerson described as a " tacky , aggressive , almost distorted , angry sound . " Emerson first found commercial success with the Nice , with whom he used and abused an L @-@ 100 , putting knives in the instrument , setting fire to it , playing it upside down , or riding it across stage in the manner of a horse . He continued to play the instrument in this manner alongside other keyboards in Emerson , Lake and Palmer . Other prominent Hammond organists in progressive rock include the Zombies ' and Argent 's Rod Argent , Yes 's Tony Kaye and Rick Wakeman , Focus 's <unk> van Leer , Uriah Heep 's Ken Hensley , Pink Floyd 's Rick Wright , Kansas 's Steve Walsh , and Genesis 's Tony Banks . Banks later claimed he only used the Hammond because a piano was impractical to transport to gigs . 
 Ska and reggae music made frequent use of the Hammond throughout the 1960s and ' 70s . Junior Marvin started to play the instrument after hearing Booker T & The MGs ' " Green Onions " , although he complained about its weight . Winston Wright was regarded in the music scene of Jamaica as one of the best organ players , and used the Hammond when performing live with Toots and the Maytals , as well as playing it on sessions with Lee " Scratch " Perry , Jimmy Cliff and Gregory Isaacs . Tyrone Downie , best known as Bob Marley and the Wailers ' keyboard player , made prominent use of the Hammond on " No Woman , No Cry " , as recorded at the Lyceum Theatre , London , for the album Live ! 
 The Hammond organ was perceived as outdated by the late 1970s , particularly in the UK , where it was often used to perform pop songs in social clubs . Punk and New Wave bands tended to prefer second @-@ hand combo organs from the 1960s , or use no keyboards at all . Other groups started taking advantage of cheaper and more portable synthesizers that were starting to come onto the market . The Stranglers ' Dave Greenfield was an exception to this , and used a Hammond onstage during the band 's early career . Andy Thompson , better known for being an aficionado of the Mellotron , stated that " the Hammond never really went away . There are a lot of studios that have had a B @-@ 3 or C @-@ 3 sitting away in there since the 70s . " The instrument underwent a brief renaissance in the 1980s with the mod revival movement . Taylor played the Hammond through the 1980s , first with the Prisoners and later with the James Taylor Quartet . The sound of the Hammond has appeared in hip @-@ hop music , albeit mostly via samples . A significant use is the Beastie Boys ' 1992 single " So What 'cha Want " , which features a Hammond mixed into the foreground ( the instrument was recorded live rather than being sampled ) . 
 Jazz musicians continued to use Hammond organs into the 21st century . Barbara <unk> has received critical acclaim for her performances on the Hammond , particularly her use of the bass pedals , and has modified the instrument to include samplers triggered by the pedals . Joey DeFrancesco embraced the instrument during the 1990s , and later collaborated with Jimmy Smith . He is positive about the future of the Hammond organ , saying " Everybody loves it . It makes you feel good ... I think it 's bigger now than ever . " Grammy @-@ winning jazz keyboardist Cory Henry learned to play the Hammond organ at age two and used it on 2016 's The Revival .

 " The Way We Was " is the twelfth episode of The Simpsons ' second season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 31 , 1991 . In the episode , Marge tells the story of how she and Homer first met and fell in love . Flashing back to 1974 , we see how Homer falls in love with Marge in high school and tries to get close to her by enlisting her as his French tutor . After several hours of verb conjugation , Marge falls for Homer too , only to become enraged when he admits that he is not a French student . Marge rejects Homer 's invitation to the prom and goes with Artie Ziff . Artie turns out to be a terrible date and Marge realizes that it is Homer she really wants . 
 The episode was written by Al Jean , Mike Reiss , and Sam Simon , and directed by David Silverman . It was the first flashback episode of The Simpsons . Jon Lovitz guest starred in it as Artie Ziff . The episode features cultural references to songs such as " The Joker " and " ( They Long to Be ) Close to You " , and the television series Siskel & Ebert & the Movies . Since airing , the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics . It acquired a Nielsen rating of 15 @.@ 6 , and was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network the week it aired . 
 = = Plot = = 
 When the Simpsons ' television breaks down , Marge tells her children how she and Homer first met . The year is 1974 and Homer and Marge are both in their senior year of high school . Unlike Homer , Marge is a responsible student , but after she burns a bra at a feminist rally , she is sent to detention . Homer is also sent to detention along with his best friend Barney for smoking in the restroom . When Homer sees Marge for the first time as she enters the detention room , he instantly falls in love . Despite his father Abraham 's warning that he is wasting his time , Homer is determined to win Marge 's heart . 
 To impress Marge , Homer joins the debate team , of which Marge is a member . At a debate , Homer finds out that Marge is more interested in the more articulate Artie Ziff . Therefore , Homer pretends to be a French student so that he can be tutored by Marge and when Homer asks Marge to the senior prom she accepts . However , when Homer confesses that he is not really a French student , Marge is furious at him for making her lose sleep for a debate tournament the next morning . She ultimately loses to Artie , who asks her to be his partner to the prom ; she agrees . Homer does not realize that Marge has changed her plans , and so he shows up at her house for prom night to pick her up . Moments later Artie shows up , causing confusion to Marge 's family , and a despondent Homer leaves . Undaunted , he decides to go to the prom alone . 
 At the prom , Artie and Marge are voted prom king and queen , and the two share the first dance . Meanwhile , Homer , heartbroken , leaves and cries in the hallway . After the prom , Artie tries to get romantic with Marge in the backseat of his car : after he pushes his luck too far , she slaps him and demands to be taken home . Meanwhile , Homer 's limousine time has run out , and without any money , he decides to walk home . Along the way Marge and Artie pass by Homer . After Artie drops Marge off at her house , she returns in her car to pick up Homer , realizing that he was the man for her all along . Homer manages to fix up the strap of Marge 's dress with the corsage that he got her after Artie ruined it from his earlier attempt .

 The episode was written by Al Jean , Mike Reiss , and Sam Simon , and directed by David Silverman . Jon Lovitz guest starred as Artie . It was his first guest appearance on The Simpsons , but he has appeared many times since . Artie 's departing line to Marge after he drops her off was supposed to be " Good night . I 'm Artie Ziff ! " , but short on time , the editors shortened it to just " Good night ? " . 
 Characters making their first appearance on the show in this episode are Wiseguy , Artie , Rainier Wolfcastle ( as the fictional action hero McBain ) , Principal Dondelinger , and Marge ’ s father . Artie 's appearance and body language is based on a man Silverman went to high school with named Mark Eisenberg . Silverman said that when he directed the episode , he went through his high school yearbook for character ideas and designs , because Silverman went to high school in the period that the episode is parodying . Wolfcastle 's voice and design was based on actor Arnold Schwarzenegger . The writers actually invented Wolfcastle for the episode " Oh Brother , Where Art Thou ? " , before " The Way We Was " went into production , but since " The Way We Was " aired before it is still considered his first appearance . The character was originally named McBain , after the film franchise that he stars in . When the film McBain was released in 1991 , after the episode had aired , the films ' producers refused to allow the show to use the name in future episodes , so the name Rainier Wolfcastle , to represent the actor 's real name , was created to use instead . Later , the use of the name McBain returned to the show . 
 " The Way We Was " originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 31 , 1991 . The episode was , together with " Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment " , selected for release in a video collection titled The Best of The Simpsons , that was released May 26 , 1998 . The episode was also included on The Simpsons season two DVD set , which was released on August 6 , 2002 . Jean , Reiss , Silverman , Matt Groening , and James L. Brooks participated in the DVD 's audio commentary . An action figure set based on the episode was released by Winning Moves . It featured the characters Homer , Marge , Artie , Barney , Grampa , Patty , and Selma , all in their flashback designs . In April 2002 , as part of an EB Games exclusive , action figures of Marge and Homer in their prom outfits were released by Playmates Toys . An action figure of Artie was also released in June 2004 as part of the wave sixteen release of the World of Springfield series of action figures by Playmates Toys .

 The television show that the Simpson family watches at the beginning of the episode , in which the two reviewers discuss the latest McBain film , is a parody of the American television series Siskel & Ebert & the Movies . In the flashback sequence , Homer is seen singing along to the 1973 song " The Joker " by the Steve Miller Band while driving to school . Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin posters hang on the wall of Homer 's 1974 bedroom . The 1970 song " ( They Long to Be ) Close to You " by The Carpenters is heard when Homer sees Marge for the first time . Homer eats a bucket of Shakespeare Fried Chicken when he reveals his feelings towards Marge to Grampa . At the debate , Homer disagrees about the idea of lowering the United States national speed limit to 55 mph ( 90 km / h ) , arguing that " Sure , it 'll save a few lives , but millions will be late ! " This is a reference to the National Maximum Speed Law provision of the 1974 Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act that prohibited speed limits higher than 55 mph . Barney asks a girl named Estelle if she wants to go to the prom with him , but she tells him that she would not go to the prom with him even if he were American actor Elliott Gould . Artie says he can think of a dozen highly cogent arguments to why Marge should accept his prom offer , one of which is from a Time magazine titled " America 's Love Affair with the Prom : Even wallflowers can look forward to one date a year , " a reference to the American magazine Time . Songs played in the episode include " The Streak " by Ray Stevens , " Goodbye Yellow Brick Road " by Elton John , " Colour My World " by Chicago , " Pick Up the Pieces " by Average White Band , and " The Hustle " by Van McCoy .

 In its original broadcast , " The Way We Was " finished sixteenth in the ratings for the week of January 28 – February 3 , 1991 , with a Nielsen rating of 15 @.@ 6 , equivalent to 14 @.@ 5 million viewing households . It was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week . 
 Since airing , the episode has received positive reviews from television critics . The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , wrote : " A superb episode . Some colorful background for Homer and Marge ( and a glimpse of Homer and Barney 's schooldays ) plus our introduction to the world of the McBain films . Excellent . " DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson thought the episode was a " fine program " , and added that Lovitz made Artie " amusingly annoying " . Jacobson thought the episode captured the " tone of the mid @-@ Seventies with warmth and insight " , and the courtship " seemed charming but not sappy , and the show worked well overall . " Jacobson 's favorite line of the episode was Grampa 's advice to Homer about Marge , " Oh , son , don ’ t overreach ! Go for the dented car , the dead @-@ end job , the less attractive girl ! " When Homer arrives at the Bouvier house to pick up Marge for the prom , Selma tells Patty " Marge 's dates get <unk> all the time , " to which Patty replies " That 's what you get when you don 't put out . " Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought these were the best lines of the episode . IGN ranked Lovitz as the eighth best guest star in the show 's history . 
 In his book Drawn to Television – Prime @-@ time Animation from the Flintstones to Family Guy , Keith Booker wrote : " The episode details in a rather sentimental fashion the early struggles of the irresponsible Homer to support his new family [ ... ] Such background episodes add an extra dimension to the portrayal of the animated Simpson family , making them seem oddly real and adding weight to their status as a family with a long history together .

 = Apiary Laboratory = 
 The Apiary Laboratory , more often referred to as the Apiary , is a research laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Amherst . Originally built for the study of honey bees and apiculture , today it is primarily used to study native pollinator species and the chemicals and pathogens impacting their populations . This academic building is unique in that it is credited as being the first in the United States to be erected exclusively for the teaching of beekeeping . 
 Prior to the construction of the building , the Massachusetts Agricultural College had maintained a beekeeping program for a number of years as one of the first land @-@ grant agricultural colleges to teach the subject in the United States . In time , techniques in apiculture progressed , leaving beekeeping as no longer simply a hobby , but rather a viable agricultural business . The college 's program had remained limited to a single short @-@ course for a number of years but was expanded however , when in 1911 , a bill passed establishing the office of " state apiary inspector " . Dr. Burton N. Gates , the man first appointed to this position was also the college beekeeping lecturer at the time , and would oversee the expansion of the program as an asset to the college and a service to the state in the years to come . Construction began on the apiary in February 1911 and with its completion in June of the following year for a total cost of $ 3000 . At the time the building contained a laboratory , a wintering cellar , a wood workshop , an office with a comprehensive library of apicultural books , honey and wax extraction rooms and a two @-@ person apartment used by student tenants . It was also the first structure built in the college orchard , a section of campus now known as the Central housing area . 
 In the time that Gates was there , research focused mainly on honey production , brood diseases , wax extraction and horticultural pollination in the cucumber and cranberry industries . From 1913 to 1920 the laboratory was also operated by a superintendent , John L. Byard , hired on by Gates to maintain the facilities from day to day as well as perform wax extractions and other services to beekeepers from around the state . Following Gates ' resignation in 1918 , the school ceased to offer its summer beekeeping school , many of its state extension services , and the college went through several different professors before hiring Frank R. Shaw as the new professor of beekeeping in 1931 . With Shaw 's retirement in 1969 , the laboratory was rededicated to urban and medical entomology research , with the former beekeeping program falling into relative obscurity . 
 At the present time the apiary is used exclusively for research on native pollinator decline and ecology , with the last beekeeping classes taught at the university nearly a decade ago . The building is currently on the university 's " defer and do not reinvest list " , suggesting that it will ultimately be dismantled at some point in the near future . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins of the beekeeping program = = = 
 Since the early days of its founding as the Massachusetts Agricultural College , UMass Amherst has maintained apiculture and ecological studies of bees throughout much of its history . In 1870 the first short courses on beekeeping were taught at the college by Alonzo Bradley Esq . , an expert on honeybee behavior and the president of the Massachusetts Beekeepers ' Association at the time . These lectures were given for several of the years that followed and appear to be " the first instruction in the subject given in any agricultural college in this country " as indicated by H.T. Fernald in his account of the college 's history . Only two decades earlier western Massachusetts had been home to Lorenzo <unk> , a man considered to be the father of modern apiculture . Although he had spent much of his time developing his innovative hive ( now considered an international standard ) in Philadelphia , in 1852 he moved to Greenfield , Massachusetts to recover from illness and further his study of honeybee behavior . In the following year he published his widely acclaimed primer , The Hive and the Honey @-@ Bee at the Hopkins , Bridgman & Co. press of Northampton . ; this book , having gone through several editions since , has become a mainstay of American beekeeping literature . One of <unk> 's own apprentices , James Fitts Wood , would go on to serve as the lecturer of beekeeping at the agricultural college for several years . During this time he continued to make significant contributions in queen @-@ rearing and became known in the apicultural community for developing a strain of notably docile Italian honeybees . Despite his success in academia and apiculture , Wood unfortunately would not live to see the establishment of the college apiary , he died after a period serious illness on February 15 , 1905 at the age of 44 . 
 = = = Construction of the apiary = = = 
 The idea of a campus apiary was first conceived for the sole purpose of pollinating the campus orchard . However , by the time the facilities had been built , President Kenyon L. Butterfield and his administration had seen and realized a much greater purpose and potential in it than was previously considered . Around this time beekeeping was considered a new business venture which had otherwise been thought of as a hobby or side business of farmers for many decades prior . 
 Just as much of the pioneer work in beekeeping originated in New England , Massachusetts was one of the first states to create a " State Inspector of <unk> . " The man who first led UMass ’ s beekeeping program , a Dr. Burton N. Gates , was also the first to fill this position . As the apiary ’ s first professor , he was originally hired part @-@ time to give a series of lectures as a guest speaker during the spring semester of 1906 . This would continue until 1910 when the administration hired him as a permanent faculty member , and concurrently built the new apicultural laboratory , equipped with all modern amenities of its time . They saw the opportunity they had , to further research on the diseases and ecology of the honey bee , something that up to that point had never been pursued so thoroughly by a public organization of higher education . 
 In 1911 , ground was broken on the site of the " old creamery building " at the foot of Mount Pleasant for the new apiary building and yards , and by June of the following year the building had been completed for a total cost of $ 3000 . At the time of its completion , the grounds contained several species of native nectar @-@ yielding flowers and were home to fifty bee colonies of multiple races . The building itself contained wax and honey extraction rooms , a wintering cellar , an office with an extensive library of beekeeping books , a wood workshop , a laboratory and a two @-@ person apartment occupied by student caretakers . 
 As the apiary became a research laboratory , classroom and an extension service to the state , the demand increased for these services and thus it became necessary to maintain additional hives . It is for these reasons that , in 1913 , Dr. Gates hired John L. Byard as superintendent of the apiary . Some of Byard 's responsibilities included performing wax extractions , running the college 's apicultural exhibit at fairs and maintaining the hive yard from day to day . 
 He would continue to maintain the building , the equipment and the hives until his death in 1920 ; professors Henry T. Fernald and Arthur I. Bourne would continue his work until his successor arrived the following year . Gates had been promoted from an assistant to an associate professor in 1915 , and had continued to work both as a lecturer and as the <unk> of the experimental station . From 1913 to 1914 he was made president of the National Beekeepers ' Association , twice hosting conventions in Amherst concluding the college 's winter and spring sessions of the college beekeeping school . However , in 1918 he left Amherst for a professorship at the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph , leaving his former position open for the two years that followed . Gates ' and Byard 's duties would be taken up by several different people in the next decade . From 1921 to 1923 all beekeeping and <unk> work at the Experimental Station was taken up by Professor Norman Phillips , who soon resigned for a job at a commercial apiary . He was replaced by Professor Morton H. Cassidy , an alumnus of the college , who stayed for 3 more years but ultimately had to resign due to his severe asthma . In 1926 , a Mr. Clayton L. Farrar was made instructor of beekeeping . Farrar , a graduate of Kansas Agricultural College , also performed extensive work on several entomology projects as a research assistant before leaving in 1931 to work at a Federal laboratory . 
 = = = Contemporary history = = = 
 In the span of only a decade the apiary laboratory had been run by 4 different faculty members until finally , in 1931 , a new and more permanent <unk> instructor , Frank R. Shaw , was hired . Shaw , a student at the time , had previously been hired on in 1930 as assistant entomologist to the college Experimental Station , but with the resignation of Farrar , his responsibilities would shift as he began to teach courses in beekeeping and pollinator ecology . In 1935 , he was made an " Instructor in Economic Entomology and Beekeeping " while concurrently finishing his Ph.D. of entomology at Cornell University . In 1944 , Shaw left to serve in the Second World War . Eventually , he would be promoted from being an instructor to an assistant professor in 1954 . UMass would continue to offer beekeeping courses and maintain a beekeeping section of the entomology department right up through the 1970s , however it appears there was never another superintendent hired to replace Byard and much of the extension work to state beekeepers seems to have ceased . Professor Shaw went on to coauthor a comprehensive beekeeping and ecology textbook with UC Davis <unk> John Eckert . This textbook , intended to replace the beekeeping text of the same name by renowned <unk> E. F. Phillips , would be published for a total of seven editions from 1960 through 1977 . Shaw retired in 1969 at the age of 61 , he would be the first and last " Professor of Beekeeping " to do so as the position was abolished immediately after . Following his retirement , a student scholarship fund for the department of entomology was set up by the department in Shaw 's name . 
 From the late 1970s through the mid @-@ 1990s the laboratory was rededicated to medical and urban entomology , with Professor John <unk> running projects on mosquitos as vectors and Professor Ron <unk> focusing on orchard pest control . In 1982 , the wintering cellar in the basement of the lab was converted into laboratories , and the workshop was relocated to the garage adjacent to the building that was constructed that same year . 
 Since 2005 , the Apiary has housed part of the Laboratory of Medical Zoology ( <unk> ) under direction of Dr. Stephen Rich . <unk> uses the lab space for studies of ticks and mosquito vectors of infectious disease . 
 = = Research = = 
 The department of entomology has done several studies in apiculture , chemical ecology , horticultural pollination , and the behavior of honeybee and bumblebee colonies . Although some research was done in the apiary yards , the majority of data had to be collected with higher numbers of colonies at different experimental stations . Today the laboratory is used to conduct research on native pollinator decline for the Managed <unk> Coordinated Agricultural Project .

 In the decade following the building 's construction , multiple courses were taught in apiculture and honeybee behavior . In 1911 , there were 20 college @-@ owned bee colonies as well as several lent by the faculty , and a five course program taught in the summer semester at the college . Within five years the college had assembled 50 hives and an extensive collection of apicultural books and equipment . In the year that followed , a summer beekeeping school was held , composed of five courses taught in previous years with the addition of a class in horticulture : 
 1 . Practical beekeeping . Lectures : laboratory practice in the general work of the beekeeper ; beekeeping equipment , practices in the preparation of materials , location of the apiary ; commencing with bees , handling of bees , practice in <unk> procedure ; spring manipulation , fall preparation , wintering ; extracted honey production ; bee diseases and their treatment , apiary sanitation ; making increase , elements of queen rearing , etc .

 From the 1920s through the 1970s the laboratory was used mainly for faculty and graduate research , with two courses offered to undergraduate students in introductory and advanced beekeeping as well as a single course offered to the public in the summers . There was a brief time in the spring semesters of 2001 and 2002 that an introductory course in beekeeping was offered , however , with the reorganization of the department of entomology these classes have since ceased . 
 = = Architecture and landscape = = 
 Although now encompassed by trees and other academic buildings , the apiary was surrounded by fields and orchards at the time of its construction . Early photographs show the hive yard was originally 2 acres in size , extending several hundred feet south of the property 's present @-@ day boundaries in what has since been developed into a residential neighborhood . The building itself was built into the side of Mount Pleasant , with the entire east side of its basement completely covered by the ground . This " banked barn " design was likely used to allow pallets of beehives to be transported with ease from the yards to the wintering cellar , while alternatively making the temperature of the building more easily controlled for their storage . 
 The building currently has two dormers on opposite sides of the roof , but neither seems to be part of the original structure . Older photos as late as 1918 show the roof without any windows implying they were added at some later date . Being the building 's most prominent design feature , the <unk> roof would later influence Louis Warren Ross , architect and an alumnus of the college , in his design of the Butterfield dormitory which , for a time , was the only other building on the hill . Since the Apiary and Butterfield Hall are the only two buildings on campus to exhibit this architectural motif , it seems likely that this was incorporated in the latter 's design to compliment the former . 
 = Requiem for a Species = 
 Requiem for a Species : Why We Resist the Truth about Climate Change is a 2010 non @-@ fiction book by Australian academic Clive Hamilton which explores climate change denial and its implications . It argues that climate change will bring about large @-@ scale , harmful consequences for habitability for life on Earth including humans , which it is too late to prevent . Hamilton explores why politicians , corporations and the public deny or refuse to act on this reality . He invokes a variety of explanations , including wishful thinking , ideology , consumer culture and active lobbying by the fossil fuel industry . The book builds on the author 's fifteen @-@ year prior history of writing about these subjects , with previous books including Growth Fetish and Scorcher : The Dirty Politics of Climate Change . 
 Requiem for a Species has been reviewed in Resurgence magazine , Socialist Review , Sydney Morning Herald , The Age , The Common Review , and Times Higher Education , which named it " Book of the Week " . Extracts of the book have appeared in The Guardian and Geographical magazine . The book won a 2010 Queensland Premier 's Literary Award . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Hamilton points out that there have been many reports and books over the years explaining the climate change problem and just how ominous the future looks for humanity . He says Requiem for a Species is primarily about why those warnings have been ignored . 
 Hamilton considers that sometimes an inconvenient truth may be too difficult to bear : 
 Sometimes facing up to the truth is just too hard . When the facts are distressing it is easier to reframe or ignore them . Around the world only a few have truly faced up to the facts about global warming ... It 's the same with our own deaths ; we all " accept " that we will die , but it is only when our death is imminent that we confront the true meaning of our mortality . 
 The most immediate reason for the failure to act on global warming is seen to be the " sustained and often ruthless exercise of political power by the corporations who stand to lose from a shift to low- and zero @-@ carbon energy systems " . Hamilton cites numerous journalists and authors who have documented the influence of large companies such as ExxonMobil , Rio Tinto Group and General Motors . Hamilton makes his argument in three stages : 
 Firstly , he reviews the evidence about how serious the situation is already and how much worse it will get . Secondly , he examines the roots of denial , both in terms of resistance to the evidence and in relation to the actors and agencies motivated to deny climate change . Lastly , he looks at some future scenarios and explains what people should do . 
 Hamilton suggests that the foundations of climate change denial lie in the reaction of American conservatism to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 . He argues that as the " red menace " receded , conservatives who had put energy into opposing communism sought other outlets . Hamilton contends that the conservative backlash against climate science was led by three prominent physicists -- Frederick Seitz , Robert Jastrow , and William Nierenberg . In 1984 Seitz , Jastrow and Nierenberg founded the George C. Marshall Institute , and in the 1990s the Marshall Institute 's main activity was attacking climate science . 
 When describing climate science , Hamilton says that official numbers published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) are highly cautious , and so the real effects of climate change will likely be even more severe . His conclusion is that it will not be possible to stabilise emissions : 
 ... even with the most optimistic set of assumptions -- the ending of deforestation , a halving of emissions associated with food production , global emissions peaking in 2020 and then falling by 3 per cent a year for a few decades -- we have no chance of preventing emissions rising well above a number of critical tipping points that will spark uncontrollable climate change . The Earth 's climate would enter a chaotic era lasting thousands of years before natural processes eventually establish some sort of equilibrium . Whether human beings would still be a force on the planet , or even survive , is a moot point . One thing seems certain : there will be far fewer of us . 
 In terms of Australia , Hamilton says that " Australians in 2050 will be living in a nation transformed by a changing climate , with widespread doubt over whether we will make it to the end of the century in a land that is recognisably Australian " .

 Michael Lynn in The Common Review says that Requiem for a Species explores the gulf between acknowledgment and acceptance of climate change . Lynn explains that the gulf has two main origins and no easy solution : 
 Hamilton ... argues that the gulf has two primary origins : the enormity of its consequences and the way it challenges how we as individuals and as societies have constructed our identities over the past three centuries . In doing so , he suggests that meeting the challenge of climate change requires far more than implementing the right policies and making minor adjustments in our lifestyles . Instead , it implies remaking our psyches and societies on a scale unseen since the dawn of the modern age . 
 The Times Higher Education listed Requiem for a Species as " Book of the week " for 3 June 2010 . Steven Yearley 's review calls it a " provocative and sobering book " . He says the heart of the book are the many explanations that Hamilton puts forward for the everyday , regular denial of the danger of changing climate . Yearley says this is also the most frustrating aspect of Requiem for a Species , because Hamilton proposes so many different explanations but does not make their relative significance clear . 
 David Shearman , in a review for Doctors for the Environment Australia , says that " Clive Hamilton is one of Australia 's most notable public intellectuals , his work is careful and balanced , he presents the facts as they are and has written a book which is uncomfortable for all " . According to Shearman , Hamilton 's treatment of the topic of denial is one of the best available . 
 Mike Hulme , in Resurgence magazine , agrees with the " consumption fetish " and " spiritual malaise " of humanity that Hamilton describes . But , according to Hulme , Hamilton has underestimated the " innovative and creative potential of collective humanity " and he has put too much faith in the infallibility of science 's predictions about future climate risks . Hulme believes that Hamilton " is placing too much weight on the foresight of science to provide his desired revolution , rather than calling for it more honestly and directly through political , psychological or spiritual engagement " . 
 Kelsey Munro reviewed the book in the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age , suggesting that it is pessimistic and does not present any false hope . But he says pessimism is not the same thing as fatalism , and Hamilton believes there is still an urgent need for government intervention to avoid worst @-@ case scenarios by reducing emissions . Munro also points out that some eminent climate scientists , like Princeton University 's Michael Oppenheimer , remain optimistic that humanity will act before it is too late . 
 Camilla Royle reviewed Requiem for a Species in Socialist Review and recommends it for those who want to get a clearer idea of climate change science . She says that Hamilton is understandably angry at the corporate lobbyists who have encouraged climate change denial . Royle suggests that Hamilton accepts that " we should at least try to do something about climate change " , but he " doesn 't give much idea of what that something is " . 
 There was a book launch for Requiem for a Species on 24 March 2010 at The University of Queensland and another on 29 March 2010 at the Australian National University ( ANU ) . An extract of the book appeared in The Guardian on 16 April 2010 . Geographical magazine published another extract in August 2010 . The book won the 2010 " Queensland Premier 's Literary Award for a work Advancing Public Debate " .

 = The Doctor , the Widow and the Wardrobe = 
 " The Doctor , the Widow and the Wardrobe " is an episode of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who . First broadcast on BBC One on 25 December 2011 , it is the seventh Christmas special since the show 's revival in 2005 . It was written by Steven Moffat and directed by Farren Blackburn . Internationally , the special was shown on BBC America in the United States and on Space in Canada the same day as the British broadcast , with ABC1 in Australia showing it one day later . 
 In the special , alien time traveller the Doctor ( Matt Smith ) is the caretaker of recently widowed Madge Arwell ( Claire Skinner ) and her children Lily ( Holly Earl ) and Cyril ( Maurice Cole ) during their holiday vacation away from the London Blitz . The Doctor plans to take them on a treat to a snowy planet through a portal in a present he has placed under the Christmas tree , but Cyril opens it before Christmas and wanders through . While looking for him , the others learn that the trees of the planet are about to be melted down with acid rain for energy . 
 " The Doctor , the Widow , and the Wardrobe " marked the end of Piers Wenger 's tenure as executive producer , and the debut of Caroline Skinner in the same position . Adapting elements of C.S. Lewis 's children 's novel The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , Moffat intended the episode to be the most " Christmassy " of the Doctor Who Christmas specials , while Blackburn felt there was " magic " in it . It was filmed in September and October 2011 , with some scenes taking place in an authentic Lancaster bomber . " The Doctor , the Widow and the Wardrobe " was watched by 10 @.@ 77 million viewers in the United Kingdom , making it the third most @-@ watched programme on Christmas Day . Critical reception to the episode was mixed , and some felt that the high @-@ profile comedic guest stars Bill Bailey and Arabella Weir were underused .

 On 6 December 2011 , a prequel to the episode was released online . The Doctor ( Matt Smith ) is seen on a spaceship holding a red button which , when he lets go , will cause the space ship to explode . While holding the button , he has phoned the TARDIS to speak to Amy Pond asking her to rescue him , although he does not have his co @-@ ordinates , Amy cannot fly the TARDIS , and she is not on the TARDIS . The Doctor wishes Amy a Merry Christmas before letting go of the button , and the spaceship explodes . 
 = = = Synopsis = = = 
 During the Christmas season of 1938 , an alien spacecraft approaches Earth ready to destroy it when it suddenly explodes courtesy of the Doctor who escapes the ship and then falls to Earth by rapidly donning an impact space suit , though in his haste , the helmet is put on backwards . On crashing to Earth , he is found by Madge Arwell ( Claire Skinner ) , wife of Reg ( Alexander <unk> ) and mother of two children , Lily ( Holly Earl ) and Cyril ( Maurice Cole ) . She helps the Doctor to his TARDIS , and the Doctor promises to repay her for her kindness . Three years later , during World War II , Reg is reported missing in action when the Lancaster bomber he was piloting disappeared over the English Channel . Madge is told this via telegram just before Christmas , but decides not to tell her children yet , hoping to keep their spirits up through the holiday . Madge and the children evacuate London to a relative 's house in Dorset , where they are greeted by the Doctor , calling himself " the Caretaker " ; Madge does not recognise him from their previous encounter , as his face had been hidden by the backwards helmet . 
 The Doctor has prepared the house specially for the children and the holiday ; though the children are pleased , Madge privately explains about Reg 's death to the Doctor and insists he not overindulge the children . During the first night , Cyril is lured into opening a large glowing present under the Christmas tree , revealing a time portal to a snow @-@ covered forest . The Doctor shortly discovers Cyril 's absence and follows him with Lily ; they eventually track Cyril to a strange lighthouse @-@ like structure . Madge , finding her children missing , soon follows them into the forest , but is met by three miners in space suits from the planet Androzani Major ( Bill Bailey , Paul Bazely , and Arabella Weir ) . She holds them at gunpoint and is taken back to their excavation walker and told that the forest of the planet they are on is scheduled to be melted by acid rain within minutes , killing anything within it . At the lighthouse , Cyril is met by a humanoid creature made of wood ; it places a simple band of metal around his head like a crown . Lily and the Doctor arrive , followed by another wood creature , but find the creatures have rejected Cyril as he is " weak " , as they do the Doctor . The Doctor concludes that the life forces of the trees in the forest are trying to escape through a living creature , the crown acting as an interface . 
 The miners are teleported away safely before the rain starts after helping Madge locate her missing children . Madge , using the limited flying skills taught to her by Reg , directs the walker to the lighthouse and safely reunites with her children as the acid rain starts . The wood creatures identify her as " strong " , and the Doctor realises they consider her the " mothership " , able to carry the life force safely . Donning the band , Madge absorbs the life force of the forest , allowing her to direct the top of the lighthouse as an escape pod away from the acid rain and into the time vortex . To get them home , the Doctor directs her to think of memories of home , allowing Madge to revisit her fond memories of Reg , shown on screens within the pod . The Doctor urges her to continue to show even Reg 's death , revealing to Lily and Cyril what happened to their father . Soon , the escape pod safely leaves the time vortex , landing just outside the house in Dorset , and the life force of the forest have converted themselves to ethereal beings within the time vortex . The Doctor steps outside while Madge starts to explain Reg 's death to Lily and Cyril , but he returns to interrupt her and to tell her to come outside . There stands Reg and his Lancaster ; he had followed the bright light of the escape pod into the time vortex and came out safely along with the pod at Dorset . The family has a tearful reunion as the Doctor watches . 
 As Madge and her family turns to celebrate Christmas , the Doctor attempts to slip away , but Madge catches him , and as she sees the TARDIS realises that he is the man in the space suit from three years before . She insists on his staying for Christmas dinner , but the Doctor reveals he has other friends who believe he is dead . Madge convinces him to go to see them . The Doctor offers Madge his help if she ever needs it again . Later , the Doctor arrives outside the home of Amy ( Karen Gillan ) and Rory ( Arthur Darvill ) , two years since he left them there ( " The God Complex " ) . They invite him to have Christmas dinner , as they had always set him a place at the dinner table . Unseen by them , the Doctor wipes away a tear of joy .

 " The Doctor , the Widow and the Wardrobe " was written by head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat , who wanted it to be " the most Christmassy Christmas special ever " . He stated that " nothing is more fun to write " than the Doctor at Christmas , as he considered it " his kind of day . Everything 's bright and shiny , everybody 's having a laugh , and nobody minds if you wear a really stupid hat " . The story is partly inspired by The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe ( from The Chronicles of Narnia ) by C. S. Lewis . Moffat said that Doctor Who and the Narnia stories " come from the same impulse that children have of escaping to another world . " 
 The scene in which the Doctor is showing the <unk> around the house originally included a scene in a " haunted coal cellar " . The characters of Ven @-@ Garr and Billis are named after outgoing executive producers Piers Wenger and Beth Willis , both of whom served with Moffat . The three tree harvesters are from Androzani Major in the year 5345 , a planet which features in the serial The Caves of Androzani ( 1984 ) . The Doctor mentions the Forest of <unk> , which appeared in the Ninth Doctor episode " The End of the World " . He mentions that one of them fancied him , and during that episode one sacrificed her life for him . 
 " The Doctor , the Widow and the Wardrobe " marks the debut of Caroline Skinner and sees the end of Wenger as executive producers . The two had previously worked together ; Moffat commented it " will be the smoothest hand @-@ over we 've done " . The special was directed by Farren Blackburn , who had previously worked with Skinner on The Fades . Blackburn stated that he was " daunted , thrilled and excited at the same time " about the job and that it was " tough " . Blackburn 's favorite sequences to direct was the opening sequence and the scenes set on the winter planet , where he " really felt like [ he ] was making a movie " . When asked about the tone he wished to create , Blackburn replied , 
 I would say there is a kind of mix . It goes through several worlds . It 's most definitely a classic action @-@ adventure but I think it merges into the Edwardian children 's story and there 's a sort of Tim Burton @-@ esque magic about it as well . I think there 's a magic throughout the episode , but there is an underlying suspense and tension and darkness to it as well . So I think it merges those three things with an awful lot of Christmas about it . 
 The British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) announced in September 2011 that production had started for the special and filming was due to be complete by mid October 2011 . Filming was disrupted on 30 September due to a 24 @-@ hour protest at BBC Wales because of compulsory redundancies . The opening sequence set in the corridors of a spaceship was filmed on 20 September 2011 at Uskmouth Power Station . As the conditions were very noisy , the crew had to wear ear protectors . Filming of some scenes involving Alexander Armstrong took place in and around the Lancaster bomber Just Jane at the Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre on 3 October 2011 . External footage of the lighthouse building took place in the Forest of Dean , Gloucestershire . Smith stated , " It was a really tough shoot . Out in a forest , at night , and because there were children involved , some shooting schedules had to change radically , we 'd often have to shoot through , no breaks – you get lunch at midnight or something . "

 Alexander Armstrong was a regular on the Doctor Who spin @-@ off The Sarah Jane Adventures as the voice of alien computer Mr Smith . Mr Smith appeared in Doctor Who in the crossover episodes " The Stolen Earth " and " Journey 's End " .

Doctor Who Magazine , in its preview of the special , refers to as Madge , Cyril and Lily as companions , with nine @-@ year @-@ old Maurice Cole 's Cyril Arwell defined as the youngest companion in the history of the franchise . 
 Arabella Weir previously appeared as an alternate incarnation of the Third Doctor in the Doctor Who Unbound audio drama Exile . Weir was " genuinely surprised and completely thrilled " to be offered the part . Bill Bailey was pleased to be given a comedic human character , explaining , " The fact that I am almost playing a human means the expressions are easier to do . If I was an Ood , with a face full of tentacles , that would have been harder to bring the funny " .

 The special has received generally good reviews . Dan Martin of The Guardian noted that it was " the smallest – yet perhaps the most enchanting – Christmas special we 've had to date " . Noting that it featured a typical " doomed spaceship " , the threat was not to the universe but one family 's happiness , and the only enemies were " some misguided and underdeveloped polluters " , he concluded that " Any other time of year I would gnaw holes all over this , but it 's Christmas , and today it felt perfect " . He felt that Skinner held the episode together and the appearance of Amy " made Christmas all the more special " . However , his " major niggle " was that everything was the Doctor 's fault , as he left the present while knowing that most children would open their presents before Christmas . Michael Hogan , writing for The Telegraph , gave the special four and a half out of five stars . He thought that the cast of comedians were " rather under @-@ utilised " but thought that Skinner " excelled " and Smith was also " brilliant " . 
 Neela Debnath of The Independent described the episode as " the perfect recipe for a Christmas special " , particularly praising the touching moments . In the same paper 's DVD review , Ben Walsh gave " The Doctor , the Widow and the Wardrobe " four out of five stars , calling it " best Doctor Who Christmas Special for some years " . He commented that " the eco @-@ message is a bit laboured , but the central tragedy that powers this <unk> episode is a poignant one " . Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern was pleased , despite noting that he had low expectations for the special . He particularly praised Smith 's performance , although he noted that the " heart @-@ warming " scene with Amy and Rory called for a " companions shake @-@ up " next series . Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club gave " The Doctor , the Widow and the Wardrobe " an A- , feeling that it could stand proudly beside " A Christmas Carol " , the previous Christmas special . 
 IGN 's Matt Risley rated the episode an 8 out of 10 , calling it more " classically , indulgently , infectiously Christmassy " than the previous Christmas specials . He praised the production design and special effects teams for " creating some dazzlingly memorable special effects , and a winter wonderland that was both recognisably , <unk> Christmas incarnate and unerringly , tensely alien " but thought the supporting cast " triumphed above and beyond " the plot devices . Like Hogan , Risley commented that the comedian cast of Bailey and Weir as well as Armstrong " felt lacking " . However , the next year , Risley wrote that he " got a little carried away with the festive <unk> ... On reflection , the overwhelming <unk> of it all was overcompensating for a pretty flimsy , frivolous plot . " Nick Setchfield of SFX gave the special four out of five stars , praising Smith 's acting and Blackburn 's Doctor Who directing debut as well as the special effects . However , he thought that the lack of a villain was an " interesting experiment , but maybe not ideal for Christmas Day " and Bailey and Weir 's forest rangers " felt like bolt @-@ on comic relief " .

 = Stephen Báthory = 
 Stephen Báthory ( Hungarian : Báthory István ; Polish : Stefan Batory ; Belarusian : <unk> <unk> ; Lithuanian : Steponas <unk> ; Romanian : Ştefan Báthory ; 27 September 1533 – 12 December 1586 ) was Voivode of Transylvania ( 1571 – 76 ) , Prince of Transylvania ( 1576 – 86 ) , from 1576 Queen Anna Jagiellon 's husband and jure uxoris King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania ( 1576 @-@ 1586 ) . 
 The son of Stephen VIII Báthory and a member of the Hungarian Báthory noble family , Báthory was a ruler of Transylvania in the 1570s , defeating another challenger for that title , Gáspár Bekes . In 1576 Báthory became the third elected king of Poland . He worked closely with chancellor Jan Zamoyski . The first years of his reign were focused on establishing power , defeating a fellow claimant to the throne , Maximilian II , Holy Roman Emperor , and quelling rebellions , most notably , the Danzig rebellion . He reigned only a decade , but is considered one of the most successful kings in Polish history , particularly in the realm of military history . His signal achievement was his victorious campaign in Livonia against Russia in the middle part of his reign , in which he repulsed a Russian invasion of Commonwealth borderlands and secured a highly favorable treaty of peace ( the Peace of Jam Zapolski ) . 
 = = Life = = 
 Stephen Báthory was born on 27 September 1533 in the castle at <unk> , also known as <unk> ( today 's <unk> Silvaniei ) . He was the son of Stephen VIII Báthory ( d . 1534 ) of the noble Hungarian Báthory family and his wife Catherine <unk> . He had at least five siblings : two brothers and three sisters . 
 Little is known about his childhood . Around 1549 @-@ 1550 he briefly visited Italy and likely spent a few months attending lectures at the Padua University . Upon his return , he joined the army of Ferdinand I , Holy Roman Emperor , and took part in his military struggle against the Turks . Some time after 1553 Báthory was captured by the Turks , and after Ferdinand I refused to pay his ransom , Báthory joined the opposing side , supporting John II Sigismund Zápolya in his struggle for power in the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom . As Zápolya 's supporter , Báthory acted both as a feudal lord , military commander and a diplomat . During one of his trips to Vienna he was put under house arrest for two years . During this time Báthory fell out of favour at Zápolya 's court , and his position was largely assumed by another Hungarian noble , Gáspár Bekes . Báthory briefly retired from politics , but he still wielded considerable influence and was seen as a possible successor to Zápolya . 
 After Zápolya 's death in 1571 , the Transylvanian estates elected Báthory Voivode of Transylvania . Bekes , supported by the Habsburgs , disputed his election , but by 1573 Báthory emerged victorious in the resulting civil war and drove Bekes out of Transylvania . He subsequently attempted to play the Ottomans and the Holy Roman Empire against one another in an attempt to strengthen the Transylvania position . 
 = = Elected king = = 
 In 1572 , the throne of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth , at the time the largest and one of the most populous states in Europe , was vacated when King Sigismund II of Poland died without heirs . The Sejm was given the power to elect a new king , and in the Polish – Lithuanian royal election , 1573 chose Henry of France ; Henry soon ascended the French throne and forfeited the Polish one by returning to France . Báthory decided to enter into the election ; in the meantime he had to defeat another attempt by Bekes to challenge his authority in Transylvania , which he did by defeating Bekes at the Battle of <unk> . 
 On 12 December 1575 , after an interregnum of roughly one and a half years , primate of Poland Jakub Uchański , representing a pro @-@ Habsburg faction , declared Emperor Maximilian II as the new monarch . However , chancellor Jan Zamoyski and others opponents of Habsburgs persuaded many of the lesser nobility to demand a Piast king , a Polish king . After a heated discussion , it was decided that Anna Jagiellon , sister of former King Sigismund II Augustus , should be elected King of Poland and marry Stephen Báthory . In January 1576 Báthory passed the mantle of Voivode of Transylvania to his brother Christopher Báthory and departed for Poland . On 1 May 1576 Báthory married Anna and was crowned King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania . After being chosen as king in the Polish – Lithuanian royal election , 1576 , Báthory also began using the title of the Prince of Transylvania . 
 = = Establishing power = = 
 Báthory 's position was at first extremely difficult , as there was still some opposition to Báthory 's election . Emperor Maximilian , insisting on his earlier election , fostered internal opposition and prepared to enforce his claim by military action . At first the representatives of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania refused to recognize Báthory as Grand Duke , and demanded concessions - that he return the estates of his wife Anne to the Lithuanian treasury , hold Sejm conventions in both Lithuania and Poland , and reserve the highest governmental official offices in Lithuania for Lithuanians . He accepted the conditions . In June Báthory was recognized as Grand Duke of Lithuania , Duke of Ruthenia and Samogitia . 
 With Lithuania secure , the other major region refusing to recognize his election was Prussia . Maximilian 's sudden death improved Báthory 's situation , but the city of Danzig ( Gdańsk ) still refused to recognize his election without significant concessions . The Hanseatic League city , bolstered by its immense wealth , fortifications , and the secret support of Maximilian , had supported the Emperor 's election and decided not to recognize Báthory as legitimate ruler . The resulting conflict was known as the Danzig rebellion . Most armed opposition collapsed when the prolonged Siege of Danzig by Báthory 's forces was lifted as an agreement was reached . The Danzig army was utterly defeated in a field battle on 17 April 1577 . However , since Báthory 's armies were unable to take the city by force , a compromise was reached . In exchange for some of Danzig 's demands being favorably reviewed , the city recognised Báthory as ruler of Poland and paid the sum of 200 @,@ 000 zlotys in gold as compensation . Tying up administration of the Commonwealth northern provinces , in February 1578 he acknowledged George Frederick as the ruler of Duchy of Prussia , receiving his feudal tribute . 
 = = Policies = = 
 After securing control over Commonwealth , Báthory had a chance to devote himself to strengthening his authority , in which he was supported by his chancellor Jan Zamoyski , who would soon become one of the king 's most trusted advisers . Báthory reorganised the judiciary by formation of legal tribunals ( the Crown Tribunal in 1578 and the Lithuanian Tribunal in 1581 ) . While this somewhat weakened the royal position , it was of little concern to Báthory , as the loss of power was not significant in the short term , and he was more concerned with the hereditary Hungarian throne . In exchange , the Sejm allowed him to raise taxes and push a number of reforms strengthening the military , including the establishment of the piechota <unk> , an infantry formation composed of peasants . Many of his projects aimed to modernize the Commonwealth army , reforming it in a model of Hungarian troops of Transylvania . He also founded the Academy of Vilna , the third university in the Commonwealth , transforming a prior Jesuit college into a major university . He founded several other Jesuit colleges , and was active in propagating Catholicism , while at the same time being respectful of the Commonwealth policy of religious tolerance , issuing a number of decrees offering protection to Polish Jews , and denouncing any religious violence . 
 In external relations , Báthory sought peace through strong alliances . Though Báthory remained distrustful of the Habsburgs , he maintained the tradition of good relations that the Commonwealth had with its Western neighbor and confirmed past treaties between the Commonwealth and Holy Roman Empire with diplomatic missions received by Maximilian 's successor , Rudolf II . The troublesome south @-@ eastern border with the Ottoman Empire was temporarily quelled by truces signed in July 1577 and April 1579 . The Sejm of January 1578 gathered in Warsaw was persuaded to grant Báthory subsidies for the inevitable war against Muscovy . 
 A number of his trusted advisers were Hungarian , and he remained interested in the Hungarian politics . He wished to recreate his native country into an independent , strong power , but the unfavorable international situation did not allow him to significantly advance any of his plans in that area . In addition to Hungarian , he was well versed in Latin , and spoke Italian and German ; he never learned the Polish language . 
 In his personal life , he was described as rather frugal in his personal expenditures , with hunting and reading as his favorite pastimes . 
 = = War with Muscovy = = 
 Before Báthory 's election to the throne of the Commonwealth , Ivan the Terrible of Russia had begun encroaching on its sphere of interest in the northeast , eventually invading the Commonwealth borderlands in Livonia ; the conflict would grow to involve a number of nearby powers ( outside Russia and Poland @-@ Lithuania , also Sweden , the Kingdom of Livonia and Denmark @-@ Norway ) . Each of them was vying for control of Livonia , and the resulting conflict , lasting for several years , became known as the Livonian War . By 1577 Ivan was in control of most of the disputed territory , but his conquest was short @-@ lived . In 1578 Commonwealth forces scored a number of victories in <unk> and begun pushing Ivan 's forces back ; this marked the turning point in the war . Báthory , together with his chancellor Zamoyski , led the army of the Commonwealth in a series of decisive campaigns taking Polotsk in 1579 and Velikiye Luki in 1580 . 
 In 1581 Stephen penetrated once again into Russia and , on 22 August , laid siege to the city of Pskov . While the city held , on 13 December 1581 Ivan the Terrible began negotiations that concluded with the Truce of Jam Zapolski on 15 January 1582 . The treaty was favorable to the Commonwealth , as Ivan ceded Polatsk , <unk> and most of the Duchy of Livonia in exchange for regaining Velikiye Luki and Nevel . 
 = = Final years = = 
 In 1584 Báthory allowed Zamoyski to execute Samuel Zborowski , whose death sentence for treason and murder had been pending for roughly a decade . This political conflict between Báthory and the Zborowski family , framed as the clash between the monarch and the nobility , would be a major recurring controversy in internal Polish politics for many years . In external politics , Báthory was considering another war with Russia , but his plans were delayed to the lack of support from the Sejm , which refused to pass requested tax raises . 
 Báthory 's health had been declining for several years . He died on 12 December 1586 . He had no legitimate children , though contemporary rumours suggested he might have had several illegitimate children . None of these rumours have been confirmed by modern historians . His death was followed by an interregnum of one year . Maximilian II 's son , Archduke Maximilian III , was elected king but was contested by the Swedish Sigismund III Vasa , who defeated Maximilian at the Byczyna and succeeded as ruler of the Commonwealth . 
 = = Remembrance = = 
 Báthory actively promoted his own legend , sponsoring a number of works about his life and achievements , from historical treatises to poetry . In his lifetime , he was featured in the works of Jan Kochanowski , Mikołaj <unk> <unk> and many others . He became a recurring character in Polish poetry and literature and featured as a central figure in poems , novels and drama by Jakub Jasiński , Józef Ignacy Kraszewski , Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz , Henryk Rzewuski and others . He has been a subject of numerous paintings , both during his life and posthumously . Among the painters who took him as a subject were Jan Matejko and Stanisław Wyspiański . 
 A statue of Báthory by Giovanni Ferrari was raised in 1789 in Padua , Italy , sponsored by the last king of the Commonwealth , Stanisław August Poniatowski . Other monuments to him include one in the Łazienki Palace ( 1795 by Andrzej Le Brun ) and one in <unk> ( 1904 , destroyed in 1939 ) . He was a patron of the Vilnius University ( then known as the Stefan Batory University ) and several units in the Polish Army from 1919 to 1939 . His name was borne by two 20th @-@ century passenger ships of the Polish Merchant Navy , the MS Batory and TSS Stefan Batory . In modern Poland , he is the namesake of the Batory <unk> , a nongovernmental Stefan Batory Foundation , the Polish 9th Armored Cavalry Brigade , and numerous Polish streets and schools . One of the districts of the town of <unk> is named after him . 
 Immediately after his death , he was not fondly remembered in the Commonwealth . Many nobles took his behavior in the Zborowski affair and his domestic policies as indicating an interest in curtailing the nobility 's Golden Freedoms and establishing an absolute monarchy . His contemporaries were also rankled by his favoritism toward Hungarians over nationals of the Commonwealth . He was also remembered , more trivially , for his Hungarian @-@ style cap and saber ( <unk> <unk> ) . 
 His later resurgence in Polish memory and historiography can be traced to the 19th @-@ century era of partitions of Poland , when the Polish state lost its independence . He was remembered for his military triumphs and praised as an effective ruler by many , including John Baptist <unk> , Jerzy Samuel Bandtkie , Michał <unk> , Józef Szujski and others . Though some historians like Tadeusz <unk> , Joachim Lelewel and Jędrzej Moraczewski remained more reserved , in 1887 Wincenty Zakrzewski noted that Báthory is " the darling of both the Polish public opinion and Polish historians " . During the interwar period in the Second Polish Republic he was a cult figure , often compared - with the government 's approval - to the contemporary dictator of Poland , Józef Piłsudski . After the Second World War , in the communist People 's Republic of Poland , he became more of a controversial figure , with historians more ready to question his internal politics and attachment to Hungary . Nonetheless his good image remained intact , reinforced by the positive views of a popular Polish historian of that period , Paweł Jasienica .

 In 1999 Spears began work on her second studio album Oops ! ... I Did It Again ( 2000 ) , in Sweden and Switzerland . After meeting with Max Martin and Rami Yacoub in Sweden , Spears recorded several songs for the album , including " Stronger " , which was co @-@ written and co @-@ produced by Martin and Rami . Upon returning to the United States , the singer revealed in an interview with MTV News that : " I just got back from Sweden , and did half [ of ] the material [ for Oops ! ] over there . I was really , really happy with the material , but we had [ such ] limited time to get so much done . So I 've just really been in the studio nonstop , which is cool , though . " Spears recorded her vocals for the song in early November 1999 at Cheiron Studios in Stockholm , Sweden . " Stronger " was released on November 13 , 2000 as the third single from the album . 
 " Stronger " is a teen pop and dance @-@ pop song that features a heavy dance beat , and lasts 3 minutes and 23 seconds . According to the digital music sheet published at Musicnotes.com , the song is composed in the key of G @-@ sharp minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 108 beats per minute , while Spears vocal range spans from C ♯ 3 to C ♯ 5 . Music critics noticed the song as Spears ' declaration of independence , which is perceived in self @-@ empowerment lines such as " I 'm not your property " and " I don 't need nobody " . Its lyrics also quote Spears ' iconic debut hit " ... Baby One More Time " , which was also co @-@ written and produced for Spears by Martin and Yacoub and released two years earlier ; the latter 's famous chorus , " My loneliness is killing me " , is answered in " Stronger " with the lyric , " My loneliness ain 't killin ' me no more " . Despite not being written by the singer , it was speculated that the song is directed to the singer 's record label and her management . In a review for the album , David Browne of Entertainment Weekly noted that " Stronger " together with " Don 't Go Knockin ' on My Door " is reminiscent of Rolling Stones ' " The Last Time " ( 1965 ) .

 The music video for the song was directed by Joseph Kahn , who revealed that the concept for the music video was created by Spears herself , by saying " I would like to dance in a chair and drive in a car and break up with [ my ] boyfriend . [ ... ] Those are your three elements . " Kahn ended up creating , according to Jocelyn Vena of MTV , " a semi @-@ futuristic world in which Spears walks into a club , breaks up with her cheating boyfriend and triumphantly walks in the rain , knowing her life is better off without him . " Kahn also considered the music video as very sophisticated , saying that it is " definitely a departure from the sort of candy @-@ colored videos she was doing before , so I always thought this was the transition between Britney the teenage pop star and Britney the sort of diva she became . " An alternate footage of the video can be found on the DVD of Spears first compilation album Greatest Hits : My Prerogative . 
 Kahn revealed that Spears ' referenced Janet Jackson 's " The Pleasure Principle " and " Miss You Much " music videos for the video 's chair routine , saying her idea was inspired by " Janet Jackson 's ' Pleasure Principle ' — the iconic chair sequence in that " . A review of the video also commented " Ms. Spears gives us her best Janet Jackson impression ( “ Miss You Much “ ) with a dizzying chair @-@ dance routine . " Spears also referenced and draws inspiration from Janet in several other music videos , including " Don 't Let Me Be the Last to Know " . " Overprotected ( Darkchild Remix ) " , " Circus " , and " Womanizer " . 
 The video begins with a closed caption that reads " Britney Spears – Stronger " , amidst the sound of a storm . It then cuts to a close up of Spears looking at her boyfriend , who is smiling with another woman holding him . She realizes she is better without him and walks away , after saying , " Whatever , " to the audience . There is a shot of the tower hotel they were in , in an apparent semi @-@ futuristic world , having a party in the restaurant in the hotel tower at the top , and then the hotel tower explodes and blows up . At the beginning of the first chorus , Spears starts dancing with an Emeco 1006 @-@ style chair in front of a black background . The second half of the video finds Spears driving away from the party in a classic Ford Mustang car during a thunderstorm ; however , before long , her car goes into a spin out , then stops on the very edge of the bridge . After recovering from the shock of it , she 's forced to continue walking on in the rain . Cuts of her dancing with a cane , transformed from the chair , are also included . The video ends with Spears walking across a bridge . Two versions of the video exist , one in which at the end of video , Spears stands in mid @-@ air above the spinning chair , and in the other a close up of her singing . Nuzhat <unk> of MTV praised the music video , saying , " few performers can work an entire routine on and around a chair as well as Britney did in ' Stronger ' " .

 Spears first performed the song live on 2000s Oops ! ... I Did It Again World Tour . The show began with the video introduction " The Britney Spears Experience " , in which three images of Spears welcomed spectators to the show . Then , a giant metal orb was lowered onstage and lifted again to reveal Spears standing behind it . Wearing a glittery jeans and an orange halter top , she opened the show with a dance @-@ oriented performance of the song . " Stronger " was last performed on 2002 's Dream Within a Dream Tour . After a dance @-@ oriented performance of " Boys " , Spears performed the song , in which she wore a paint @-@ covered robe and in some shows a bowler hat . Spears also performed the song on several television appearances , including on the American Music Awards of 2001 , and on a MTV special titled " Total Britney Live " . A Fox special titled " Britney In Hawaii " , aired on June 8 , 2000 , included an exclusive performance of the song . A performance of " Stronger " live from Germany was broadcast on Radio Music Awards of 2000 , since Spears was on tour by the time of the awards . " Stronger " was not included on the set lists of any of Spears ' tours until it was included in her Las Vegas residency show Britney : Piece of Me . 
 " Stronger " was covered by Kevin McHale on TV series Glee , on an episode titled " Britney / Brittany " , that was dedicated to the singer . In the episode , McHale 's character Artie has a hallucination of himself singing " Stronger " during a dental visit . The cover received positive reviews from contemporary music critics . Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal enjoyed the cover version , appreciating the twist of having males sing a feminist empowerment song , while Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly deemed " Stronger " his favorite performance of the episode , as well as the best incorporation of Spears ' music , as the song served Artie 's storyline .

 = Amphetamine = 
 Amphetamine ( contracted from alpha ‑ methylphenethylamine ) is a potent central nervous system ( CNS ) stimulant that is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , narcolepsy , and obesity . Amphetamine was discovered in 1887 and exists as two enantiomers : levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine . Amphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical , the racemic free base , which is equal parts of the two enantiomers , levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine , in their pure amine forms . However , the term is frequently used informally to refer to any combination of the enantiomers , or to either of them alone . Historically , it has been used to treat nasal congestion and depression . Amphetamine is also used as an athletic performance enhancer and cognitive enhancer , and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant . It is a prescription drug in many countries , and unauthorized possession and distribution of amphetamine are often tightly controlled due to the significant health risks associated with recreational use . 
 The first pharmaceutical amphetamine was Benzedrine , a brand which was used to treat a variety of conditions . Currently , pharmaceutical amphetamine is prescribed as racemic amphetamine , Adderall , dextroamphetamine , or the inactive prodrug lisdexamfetamine . Amphetamine , through activation of a trace amine receptor , increases monoamine and excitatory neurotransmitter activity in the brain , with its most pronounced effects targeting the catecholamine neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine . 
 At therapeutic doses , amphetamine causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria , change in desire for sex , increased wakefulness , and improved cognitive control . It induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time , fatigue resistance , and increased muscle strength . Larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown . Drug addiction is a serious risk with large recreational doses but is unlikely to arise from typical long @-@ term medical use at therapeutic doses . Very high doses can result in psychosis ( e.g. , delusions and paranoia ) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long @-@ term use . Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects . 
 Amphetamine belongs to the phenethylamine class . It is also the parent compound of its own structural class , the substituted amphetamines , which includes prominent substances such as bupropion , cathinone , MDMA ( ecstasy ) , and methamphetamine . As a member of the phenethylamine class , amphetamine is also chemically related to the naturally occurring trace amine <unk> , specifically phenethylamine and N @-@ methylphenethylamine , both of which are produced within the human body . <unk> is the parent compound of amphetamine , while N @-@ methylphenethylamine is a constitutional isomer that differs only in the placement of the methyl group . 
 = = Uses = = 
 = = = Medical = = = 
 Amphetamine is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , narcolepsy ( a sleep disorder ) , and obesity , and is sometimes prescribed off @-@ label for its past medical indications , such as depression . Long @-@ term amphetamine exposure at sufficiently high doses in some animal species is known to produce abnormal dopamine system development or nerve damage , but , in humans with ADHD , pharmaceutical amphetamines appear to improve brain development and nerve growth . Reviews of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) studies suggest that long @-@ term treatment with amphetamine decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with ADHD , and improves function in several parts of the brain , such as the right caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia . 
 Reviews of clinical stimulant research have established the safety and effectiveness of long @-@ term amphetamine use for ADHD . Controlled trials spanning two years have demonstrated treatment effectiveness and safety . One review highlighted a nine @-@ month randomized controlled trial in children with ADHD that found an average increase of 4 @.@ 5 IQ points , continued increases in attention , and continued decreases in disruptive behaviors and hyperactivity . 
 Current models of ADHD suggest that it is associated with functional impairments in some of the brain 's neurotransmitter systems ; these functional impairments involve impaired dopamine neurotransmission in the mesocorticolimbic projection and norepinephrine neurotransmission in the locus coeruleus and prefrontal cortex . <unk> like methylphenidate and amphetamine are effective in treating ADHD because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems . Approximately 80 % of those who use these stimulants see improvements in ADHD symptoms . Children with ADHD who use stimulant medications generally have better relationships with peers and family members , perform better in school , are less distractible and impulsive , and have longer attention spans . The Cochrane Collaboration 's reviews on the treatment of ADHD in children , adolescents , and adults with pharmaceutical amphetamines stated that while these drugs improve short @-@ term symptoms , they have higher discontinuation rates than non @-@ stimulant medications due to their adverse side effects . A Cochrane Collaboration review on the treatment of ADHD in children with tic disorders such as Tourette syndrome indicated that stimulants in general do not make tics worse , but high doses of dextroamphetamine could exacerbate tics in some individuals . 
 = = = Enhancing performance = = = 
 In 2015 , a systematic review and a meta @-@ analysis of high quality clinical trials found that , when used at low ( therapeutic ) doses , amphetamine produces modest , unambiguous improvements in cognition , including working memory , episodic memory , inhibitory control and some aspects of attention , in normal healthy adults ; the cognition @-@ enhancing effects of amphetamine are known to occur through its indirect activation of both dopamine receptor D1 and adrenoceptor α2 in the prefrontal cortex . A systematic review from 2014 noted that low doses of amphetamine also improve memory consolidation , in turn leading to improved recall of information . Therapeutic doses of amphetamine also enhance cortical network efficiency , an effect which mediates improvements in working memory in all individuals . Amphetamine and other ADHD stimulants also improve task saliency ( motivation to perform a task ) and increase arousal ( wakefulness ) , in turn promoting goal @-@ directed behavior . Stimulants such as amphetamine can improve performance on difficult and boring tasks and are used by some students as a study and test @-@ taking aid . Based upon studies of self @-@ reported illicit stimulant use , 5 – 35 % of college students use diverted ADHD stimulants , which are primarily used for performance enhancement rather than as recreational drugs . However , high amphetamine doses that are above the therapeutic range can interfere with working memory and other aspects of cognitive control . 
 Amphetamine is used by some athletes for its psychological and athletic performance @-@ enhancing effects , such as increased endurance and alertness ; however , non @-@ medical amphetamine use is prohibited at sporting events that are regulated by collegiate , national , and international anti @-@ doping agencies . In healthy people at oral therapeutic doses , amphetamine has been shown to increase muscle strength , acceleration , athletic performance in anaerobic conditions , and endurance ( i.e. , it delays the onset of fatigue ) , while improving reaction time . Amphetamine improves endurance and reaction time primarily through reuptake inhibition and effluxion of dopamine in the central nervous system . Amphetamine and other dopaminergic drugs also increase power output at fixed levels of perceived exertion by overriding a " safety switch " that allows the core temperature limit to increase in order to access a reserve capacity that is normally off @-@ limits . At therapeutic doses , the adverse effects of amphetamine do not impede athletic performance ; however , at much higher doses , amphetamine can induce effects that severely impair performance , such as rapid muscle breakdown and elevated body temperature . 
 = = Contraindications = = 
 According to the International Programme on Chemical Safety ( IPCS ) and United States Food and Drug Administration ( USFDA ) , amphetamine is contraindicated in people with a history of drug abuse , heart disease , severe agitation , or severe anxiety . It is also contraindicated in people currently experiencing arteriosclerosis ( hardening of the arteries ) , glaucoma ( increased eye pressure ) , hyperthyroidism ( excessive production of thyroid hormone ) , or moderate to severe hypertension . People who have experienced allergic reactions to other stimulants in the past or who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors ( MAOIs ) are advised not to take amphetamine , although safe concurrent use of amphetamine and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been documented . These agencies also state that anyone with anorexia nervosa , bipolar disorder , depression , hypertension , liver or kidney problems , mania , psychosis , Raynaud 's phenomenon , seizures , thyroid problems , tics , or Tourette syndrome should monitor their symptoms while taking amphetamine . Evidence from human studies indicates that therapeutic amphetamine use does not cause developmental abnormalities in the fetus or newborns ( i.e. , it is not a human teratogen ) , but amphetamine abuse does pose risks to the fetus . Amphetamine has also been shown to pass into breast milk , so the IPCS and USFDA advise mothers to avoid breastfeeding when using it . Due to the potential for reversible growth impairments , the USFDA advises monitoring the height and weight of children and adolescents prescribed an amphetamine pharmaceutical . 
 = = Side effects = = 
 The side effects of amphetamine are varied , and the amount of amphetamine used is the primary factor in determining the likelihood and severity of side effects . Amphetamine products such as Adderall , Dexedrine , and their generic equivalents are currently approved by the USFDA for long @-@ term therapeutic use . Recreational use of amphetamine generally involves much larger doses , which have a greater risk of serious side effects than dosages used for therapeutic reasons . 
 = = = Physical = = = 
 At normal therapeutic doses , the physical side effects of amphetamine vary widely by age and from person to person . Cardiovascular side effects can include hypertension or hypotension from a <unk> response , Raynaud 's phenomenon ( reduced blood flow to extremities ) , and tachycardia ( increased heart rate ) . Sexual side effects in males may include erectile dysfunction , frequent erections , or prolonged erections . Abdominal side effects may include abdominal pain , appetite loss , nausea , and weight loss . Other potential side effects include blurred vision , dry mouth , excessive grinding of the teeth , nosebleed , profuse sweating , rhinitis <unk> ( drug @-@ induced nasal congestion ) , reduced seizure threshold , and tics ( a type of movement disorder ) . Dangerous physical side effects are rare at typical pharmaceutical doses . 
 Amphetamine stimulates the medullary respiratory centers , producing faster and deeper breaths . In a normal person at therapeutic doses , this effect is usually not noticeable , but when respiration is already compromised , it may be evident . Amphetamine also induces contraction in the urinary bladder sphincter , the muscle which controls urination , which can result in difficulty urinating . This effect can be useful in treating bed wetting and loss of bladder control . The effects of amphetamine on the gastrointestinal tract are unpredictable . If intestinal activity is high , amphetamine may reduce gastrointestinal motility ( the rate at which content moves through the digestive system ) ; however , amphetamine may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed . Amphetamine also has a slight analgesic effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids . 
 USFDA @-@ commissioned studies from 2011 indicate that in children , young adults , and adults there is no association between serious adverse cardiovascular events ( sudden death , heart attack , and stroke ) and the medical use of amphetamine or other ADHD stimulants . 
 = = = Psychological = = = 
 Common psychological effects of therapeutic doses can include increased alertness , apprehension , concentration , decreased sense of fatigue , mood swings ( elated mood followed by mildly depressed mood ) , increased initiative , insomnia or wakefulness , self @-@ confidence , and sociability . Less common side effects include anxiety , change in libido , grandiosity , irritability , repetitive or obsessive behaviors , and restlessness ; these effects depend on the user 's personality and current mental state . Amphetamine psychosis ( e.g. , delusions and paranoia ) can occur in heavy users . Although very rare , this psychosis can also occur at therapeutic doses during long @-@ term therapy . According to the USFDA , " there is no systematic evidence " that stimulants produce aggressive behavior or hostility . 
 Amphetamine has also been shown to produce a conditioned place preference in humans taking therapeutic doses , meaning that individuals acquire a preference for spending time in places where they have previously used amphetamine . 
 = = Overdose = = 
 An amphetamine overdose can lead to many different symptoms , but is rarely fatal with appropriate care . The severity of overdose symptoms increases with dosage and decreases with drug tolerance to amphetamine . Tolerant individuals have been known to take as much as 5 grams of amphetamine in a day , which is roughly 100 times the maximum daily therapeutic dose . Symptoms of a moderate and extremely large overdose are listed below ; fatal amphetamine poisoning usually also involves convulsions and coma . In 2013 , overdose on amphetamine , methamphetamine , and other compounds implicated in an " amphetamine use disorder " resulted in an estimated 3 @,@ 788 deaths worldwide ( 3 @,@ 425 – 4 @,@ 145 deaths , 95 % confidence ) . 
 Pathological overactivation of the mesolimbic pathway , a dopamine pathway that connects the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens , plays a central role in amphetamine addiction . Individuals who frequently overdose on amphetamine during recreational use have a high risk of developing an amphetamine addiction , since repeated overdoses gradually increase the level of <unk> ΔFosB , a " molecular switch " and " master control protein " for addiction . Once nucleus accumbens ΔFosB is sufficiently overexpressed , it begins to increase the severity of addictive behavior ( i.e. , compulsive drug @-@ seeking ) with further increases in its expression . While there are currently no effective drugs for treating amphetamine addiction , regularly engaging in sustained aerobic exercise appears to reduce the risk of developing such an addiction . Sustained aerobic exercise on a regular basis also appears to be an effective treatment for amphetamine addiction ; exercise therapy improves clinical treatment outcomes and may be used as a combination therapy with cognitive behavioral therapy , which is currently the best clinical treatment available . 
 = = = Addiction = = = 
 Addiction is a serious risk with heavy recreational amphetamine use but is unlikely to arise from typical long @-@ term medical use at therapeutic doses . Drug tolerance develops rapidly in amphetamine abuse ( i.e. , a recreational amphetamine overdose ) , so periods of extended use require increasingly larger doses of the drug in order to achieve the same effect . 
 = = = = Biomolecular mechanisms = = = = 
 Current models of addiction from chronic drug use involve alterations in gene expression in certain parts of the brain , particularly the nucleus accumbens . The most important transcription factors that produce these alterations are ΔFosB , cAMP response element binding protein ( CREB ) , and nuclear factor kappa B ( NF @-@ κB ) . ΔFosB plays a crucial role in the development of drug addictions , since its overexpression in D1 @-@ type medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens is necessary and sufficient for most of the behavioral and neural adaptations that arise from addiction . Once ΔFosB is sufficiently overexpressed , it induces an addictive state that becomes increasingly more severe with further increases in ΔFosB expression . It has been implicated in addictions to alcohol , cannabinoids , cocaine , methylphenidate , nicotine , opioids , phencyclidine , propofol , and substituted amphetamines , among others . 
 ΔJunD , a transcription factor , and G9a , a histone methyltransferase enzyme , both directly oppose the induction of ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens ( i.e. , they oppose increases in its expression ) . Sufficiently overexpressing ΔJunD in the nucleus accumbens with viral vectors can completely block many of the neural and behavioral alterations seen in chronic drug abuse ( i.e. , the alterations mediated by ΔFosB ) . ΔFosB also plays an important role in regulating behavioral responses to natural rewards , such as palatable food , sex , and exercise . Since both natural rewards and addictive drugs induce expression of ΔFosB ( i.e. , they cause the brain to produce more of it ) , chronic acquisition of these rewards can result in a similar pathological state of addiction . Consequently , ΔFosB is the most significant factor involved in both amphetamine addiction and amphetamine @-@ induced sex addictions , which are compulsive sexual behaviors that result from excessive sexual activity and amphetamine use . These sex addictions are associated with a dopamine dysregulation syndrome which occurs in some patients taking dopaminergic drugs . 
 The effects of amphetamine on gene regulation are both <unk> and route @-@ dependent . Most of the research on gene regulation and addiction is based upon animal studies with intravenous amphetamine administration at very high doses . The few studies that have used equivalent ( weight @-@ adjusted ) human therapeutic doses and oral administration show that these changes , if they occur , are relatively minor . This suggests that medical use of amphetamine does not significantly affect gene regulation . 
 = = = = Pharmacological treatments = = = = 
 As of May 2014 , there is no effective pharmacotherapy for amphetamine addiction . Reviews from 2015 and 2016 indicated that TAAR1 @-@ selective agonists have significant therapeutic potential as a treatment for psychostimulant addictions ; however , as of February 2016 , the only compounds which are known to function as TAAR1 @-@ selective agonists are experimental drugs . Amphetamine addiction is largely mediated through increased activation of dopamine receptors and co @-@ localized NMDA receptors in the nucleus accumbens ; magnesium ions inhibit NMDA receptors by blocking the receptor calcium channel . One review suggested that , based upon animal testing , pathological ( addiction @-@ inducing ) psychostimulant use significantly reduces the level of intracellular magnesium throughout the brain . Supplemental magnesium treatment has been shown to reduce amphetamine self @-@ administration ( i.e. , doses given to oneself ) in humans , but it is not an effective monotherapy for amphetamine addiction . 
 = = = = Behavioral treatments = = = = 
 Cognitive behavioral therapy is currently the most effective clinical treatment for psychostimulant addictions . Additionally , research on the neurobiological effects of physical exercise suggests that daily aerobic exercise , especially endurance exercise ( e.g. , marathon running ) , prevents the development of drug addiction and is an effective adjunct therapy ( i.e. , a supplemental treatment ) for amphetamine addiction . Exercise leads to better treatment outcomes when used as an adjunct treatment , particularly for psychostimulant addictions . In particular , aerobic exercise decreases psychostimulant self @-@ administration , reduces the reinstatement ( i.e. , relapse ) of drug @-@ seeking , and induces increased dopamine receptor D2 ( DRD2 ) density in the striatum . This is the opposite of pathological stimulant use , which induces decreased striatal DRD2 density . One review noted that exercise may also prevent the development of a drug addiction by altering ΔFosB or c @-@ Fos <unk> in the striatum or other parts of the reward system . 
 = = = Dependence and withdrawal = = = 
 According to another Cochrane Collaboration review on withdrawal in individuals who compulsively use amphetamine and methamphetamine , " when chronic heavy users abruptly discontinue amphetamine use , many report a time @-@ limited withdrawal syndrome that occurs within 24 hours of their last dose . " This review noted that withdrawal symptoms in chronic , high @-@ dose users are frequent , occurring in up to 87 @.@ 6 % of cases , and persist for three to four weeks with a marked " crash " phase occurring during the first week . Amphetamine withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety , drug craving , depressed mood , fatigue , increased appetite , increased movement or decreased movement , lack of motivation , sleeplessness or sleepiness , and lucid dreams . The review indicated that withdrawal symptoms are associated with the degree of dependence , suggesting that therapeutic use would result in far milder discontinuation symptoms . Manufacturer prescribing information does not indicate the presence of withdrawal symptoms following discontinuation of amphetamine use after an extended period at therapeutic doses . 
 = = = Toxicity and psychosis = = = 
 In rodents and primates , sufficiently high doses of amphetamine cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity , or damage to dopamine neurons , which is characterized by reduced transporter and receptor function . There is no evidence that amphetamine is directly neurotoxic in humans . However , large doses of amphetamine may cause indirect neurotoxicity as a result of increased oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species and autoxidation of dopamine . 
 A severe amphetamine overdose can result in a stimulant psychosis that may involve a variety of symptoms , such as paranoia and delusions . A Cochrane Collaboration review on treatment for amphetamine , dextroamphetamine , and methamphetamine psychosis states that about 5 – 15 % of users fail to recover completely . According to the same review , there is at least one trial that shows antipsychotic medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis . Psychosis very rarely arises from therapeutic use . 
 = = Interactions = = 
 Many types of substances are known to interact with amphetamine , resulting in altered drug action or metabolism of amphetamine , the interacting substance , or both . Inhibitors of the enzymes that metabolize amphetamine ( e.g. , CYP2D6 and flavin @-@ containing monooxygenase 3 ) will prolong its elimination half @-@ life , meaning that its effects will last longer . Amphetamine also interacts with MAOIs , particularly monoamine oxidase A inhibitors , since both MAOIs and amphetamine increase plasma catecholamines ( i.e. , norepinephrine and dopamine ) ; therefore , concurrent use of both is dangerous . Amphetamine modulates the activity of most psychoactive drugs . In particular , amphetamine may decrease the effects of sedatives and depressants and increase the effects of stimulants and antidepressants . Amphetamine may also decrease the effects of <unk> and antipsychotics due to its effects on blood pressure and dopamine respectively . In general , there is no significant interaction when consuming amphetamine with food , but the pH of gastrointestinal content and urine affects the absorption and excretion of amphetamine , respectively . Acidic substances reduce the absorption of amphetamine and increase urinary excretion , and alkaline substances do the opposite . Due to the effect pH has on absorption , amphetamine also interacts with gastric acid reducers such as proton pump inhibitors and H2 antihistamines , which increase gastrointestinal pH ( i.e. , make it less acidic ) .

 = = = Pharmacodynamics = = = 
 Amphetamine exerts its behavioral effects by altering the use of monoamines as neuronal signals in the brain , primarily in catecholamine neurons in the reward and executive function pathways of the brain . The concentrations of the main neurotransmitters involved in reward circuitry and executive functioning , dopamine and norepinephrine , increase dramatically in a dose @-@ dependent manner by amphetamine due to its effects on monoamine transporters . The reinforcing and task saliency effects of amphetamine are mostly due to enhanced dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway . 
 Amphetamine has been identified as a potent full agonist of trace amine @-@ associated receptor 1 ( TAAR1 ) , a Gs @-@ coupled and <unk> @-@ coupled G protein @-@ coupled receptor ( GPCR ) discovered in 2001 , which is important for regulation of brain monoamines . Activation of TAAR1 increases cAMP production via <unk> cyclase activation and inhibits monoamine transporter function . Monoamine autoreceptors ( e.g. , D2 short , presynaptic α2 , and presynaptic 5 @-@ HT1A ) have the opposite effect of TAAR1 , and together these receptors provide a regulatory system for monoamines . Notably , amphetamine and trace amines bind to TAAR1 , but not monoamine autoreceptors . Imaging studies indicate that monoamine reuptake inhibition by amphetamine and trace amines is site specific and depends upon the presence of TAAR1 co @-@ localization in the associated monoamine neurons . As of 2010 , co @-@ localization of TAAR1 and the dopamine transporter ( DAT ) has been visualized in rhesus monkeys , but co @-@ localization of TAAR1 with the norepinephrine transporter ( NET ) and the serotonin transporter ( SERT ) has only been evidenced by messenger RNA ( mRNA ) expression . 
 In addition to the neuronal monoamine transporters , amphetamine also inhibits both vesicular monoamine transporters , VMAT1 and VMAT2 , as well as <unk> , SLC22A3 , and SLC22A5 . <unk> is excitatory amino acid transporter 3 ( <unk> ) , a glutamate transporter located in neurons , SLC22A3 is an <unk> monoamine transporter that is present in astrocytes , and SLC22A5 is a high @-@ affinity carnitine transporter . Amphetamine is known to strongly induce <unk> and amphetamine @-@ regulated transcript ( CART ) gene expression , a neuropeptide involved in feeding behavior , stress , and reward , which induces observable increases in neuronal development and survival in vitro . The CART receptor has yet to be identified , but there is significant evidence that CART binds to a unique Gi / Go @-@ coupled GPCR . Amphetamine also inhibits monoamine oxidase at very high doses , resulting in less dopamine and phenethylamine metabolism and consequently higher concentrations of synaptic monoamines . In humans , the only post @-@ synaptic receptor at which amphetamine is known to bind is the 5 @-@ HT1A receptor , where it acts as an agonist with micromolar affinity . 
 The full profile of amphetamine 's short @-@ term drug effects in humans is mostly derived through increased cellular communication or neurotransmission of dopamine , serotonin , norepinephrine , epinephrine , histamine , CART peptides , acetylcholine , endogenous opioids , adrenocorticotropic hormone , corticosteroids , and glutamate , which it effects through interactions with CART , 5 @-@ HT1A , <unk> , TAAR1 , VMAT1 , VMAT2 , and possibly other biological targets . 
 Dextroamphetamine is a more potent agonist of TAAR1 than levoamphetamine . Consequently , dextroamphetamine produces greater CNS stimulation than levoamphetamine , roughly three to four times more , but levoamphetamine has slightly stronger cardiovascular and peripheral effects . 
 = = = = Dopamine = = = = 
 In certain brain regions , amphetamine increases the concentration of dopamine in the synaptic cleft . Amphetamine can enter the presynaptic neuron either through DAT or by diffusing across the neuronal membrane directly . As a consequence of DAT uptake , amphetamine produces competitive reuptake inhibition at the transporter . Upon entering the presynaptic neuron , amphetamine activates TAAR1 which , through protein kinase A ( PKA ) and protein kinase C ( PKC ) signaling , causes DAT phosphorylation . Phosphorylation by either protein kinase can result in DAT internalization ( non @-@ competitive reuptake inhibition ) , but PKC @-@ mediated phosphorylation alone induces reverse transporter function ( dopamine efflux ) . Amphetamine is also known to increase intracellular calcium , an effect which is associated with DAT phosphorylation through an unidentified Ca2 + / calmodulin @-@ dependent protein kinase ( <unk> ) -dependent pathway , in turn producing dopamine efflux . Through direct activation of G protein @-@ coupled inwardly @-@ rectifying potassium channels , TAAR1 reduces the firing rate of postsynaptic dopamine neurons , preventing a hyper @-@ dopaminergic state . 
 Amphetamine is also a substrate for the presynaptic vesicular monoamine transporter , VMAT2 . Following amphetamine uptake at VMAT2 , the synaptic vesicle releases dopamine molecules into the cytosol in exchange . Subsequently , the cytosolic dopamine molecules exit the presynaptic neuron via reverse transport at DAT . 
 = = = = Norepinephrine = = = = 
 Similar to dopamine , amphetamine dose @-@ dependently increases the level of synaptic norepinephrine , the direct precursor of epinephrine . Based upon neuronal TAAR1 mRNA expression , amphetamine is thought to affect norepinephrine analogously to dopamine . In other words , amphetamine induces TAAR1 @-@ mediated efflux and non @-@ competitive reuptake inhibition at phosphorylated NET , competitive NET reuptake inhibition , and norepinephrine release from VMAT2 . 
 = = = = Serotonin = = = = 
 Amphetamine exerts analogous , yet less pronounced , effects on serotonin as on dopamine and norepinephrine . Amphetamine affects serotonin via VMAT2 and , like norepinephrine , is thought to phosphorylate SERT via TAAR1 . Like dopamine , amphetamine has low , micromolar affinity at the human 5 @-@ HT1A receptor . 
 = = = = Other neurotransmitters , peptides , and hormones = = = = 
 Amphetamine has no direct effect on acetylcholine neurotransmission , but several studies have noted that acetylcholine release increases after its use . In lab animals , amphetamine increases acetylcholine levels in certain brain regions as a downstream effect . In humans , a similar phenomenon occurs via the ghrelin @-@ mediated cholinergic – dopaminergic reward link in the ventral tegmental area . Acute amphetamine administration in humans also increases endogenous opioid release in several brain structures in the reward system . Extracellular levels of glutamate , the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain , have been shown to increase upon exposure to amphetamine . This <unk> effect was found in the mesolimbic pathway , an area of the brain implicated in reward , where amphetamine is known to affect dopamine neurotransmission . 
 Amphetamine also induces the selective release of histamine from mast cells and efflux from <unk> neurons through VMAT2 . Acute amphetamine administration can also increase adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosteroid levels in blood plasma by stimulating the hypothalamic – pituitary – adrenal axis . 
 = = = Pharmacokinetics = = = 
 The oral bioavailability of amphetamine varies with gastrointestinal pH ; it is well absorbed from the gut , and bioavailability is typically over 75 % for dextroamphetamine . Amphetamine is a weak base with a pKa of 9 – 10 ; consequently , when the pH is basic , more of the drug is in its lipid soluble free base form , and more is absorbed through the lipid @-@ rich cell membranes of the gut epithelium . Conversely , an acidic pH means the drug is predominantly in a water @-@ soluble cationic ( salt ) form , and less is absorbed . Approximately 15 – 40 % of amphetamine circulating in the bloodstream is bound to plasma proteins . 
 The half @-@ life of amphetamine enantiomers differ and vary with urine pH . At normal urine pH , the half @-@ lives of dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine are 9 – 11 hours and 11 – 14 hours , respectively . An acidic diet will reduce the enantiomer half @-@ lives to 8 – 11 hours ; an alkaline diet will increase the range to 16 – 31 hours . The immediate @-@ release and extended release variants of salts of both isomers reach peak plasma concentrations at 3 hours and 7 hours post @-@ dose respectively . Amphetamine is eliminated via the kidneys , with 30 – 40 % of the drug being excreted unchanged at normal urinary pH . When the urinary pH is basic , amphetamine is in its free base form , so less is excreted . When urine pH is abnormal , the urinary recovery of amphetamine may range from a low of 1 % to a high of 75 % , depending mostly upon whether urine is too basic or acidic , respectively . Amphetamine is usually eliminated within two days of the last oral dose . Apparent half @-@ life and duration of effect increase with repeated use and accumulation of the drug . 
 The prodrug lisdexamfetamine is not as sensitive to pH as amphetamine when being absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract ; following absorption into the blood stream , it is converted by red blood cell @-@ associated enzymes to dextroamphetamine via hydrolysis . The elimination half @-@ life of lisdexamfetamine is generally less than one hour . 
 CYP2D6 , dopamine β @-@ hydroxylase , flavin @-@ containing monooxygenase 3 , butyrate @-@ CoA ligase , and glycine N @-@ acyltransferase are the enzymes known to metabolize amphetamine or its metabolites in humans . Amphetamine has a variety of excreted metabolic products , including 4 @-@ hydroxyamphetamine , 4 @-@ hydroxynorephedrine , 4 @-@ hydroxyphenylacetone , benzoic acid , hippuric acid , norephedrine , and phenylacetone . Among these metabolites , the active sympathomimetics are 4 ‑ hydroxyamphetamine , 4 ‑ hydroxynorephedrine , and norephedrine . The main metabolic pathways involve aromatic para @-@ hydroxylation , aliphatic alpha- and beta @-@ hydroxylation , N @-@ oxidation , N @-@ dealkylation , and deamination . The known pathways and detectable metabolites in humans include the following : 
 = = = Related endogenous compounds = = = 
 Amphetamine has a very similar structure and function to the endogenous trace amines , which are naturally occurring neurotransmitter molecules produced in the human body and brain . Among this group , the most closely related compounds are phenethylamine , the parent compound of amphetamine , and N @-@ methylphenethylamine , an isomer of amphetamine ( i.e. , it has an identical molecular formula ) . In humans , phenethylamine is produced directly from L @-@ phenylalanine by the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase ( <unk> ) enzyme , which converts L @-@ DOPA into dopamine as well . In turn , N ‑ methylphenethylamine is metabolized from phenethylamine by phenylethanolamine N @-@ methyltransferase , the same enzyme that metabolizes norepinephrine into epinephrine . Like amphetamine , both phenethylamine and N ‑ methylphenethylamine regulate monoamine neurotransmission via TAAR1 ; unlike amphetamine , both of these substances are broken down by monoamine oxidase B , and therefore have a shorter half @-@ life than amphetamine . 
 = = Physical and chemical properties = = 
 Amphetamine is a methyl homolog of the mammalian neurotransmitter phenethylamine with the chemical formula <unk> . The carbon atom adjacent to the primary amine is a stereogenic center , and amphetamine is composed of a racemic 1 : 1 mixture of two enantiomeric mirror images . This racemic mixture can be separated into its optical isomers : levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine . Physically , at room temperature , the pure free base of amphetamine is a mobile , colorless , and volatile liquid with a characteristically strong amine odor , and acrid , burning taste . Frequently prepared solid salts of amphetamine include amphetamine aspartate , hydrochloride , phosphate , <unk> , and sulfate , the last of which is the most common amphetamine salt . Amphetamine is also the parent compound of its own structural class , which includes a number of psychoactive derivatives . In organic chemistry , amphetamine is an excellent chiral ligand for the <unk> synthesis of 1 @,@ 1 ' <unk> @-@ 2 @-@ <unk> . 
 = = = Substituted derivatives = = = 
 The substituted derivatives of amphetamine , or " substituted amphetamines " , are a broad range of chemicals that contain amphetamine as a " backbone " ; specifically , this chemical class includes derivative compounds that are formed by replacing one or more hydrogen atoms in the amphetamine core structure with substituents . The class includes amphetamine itself , stimulants like methamphetamine , serotonergic <unk> like MDMA , and decongestants like ephedrine , among other subgroups . 
 = = = Synthesis = = = 
 Since the first preparation was reported in 1887 , numerous synthetic routes to amphetamine have been developed . The most common route of both legal and illicit amphetamine synthesis employs a non @-@ metal reduction known as the Leuckart reaction ( method 1 ) . In the first step , a reaction between phenylacetone and <unk> , either using additional formic acid or <unk> itself as a reducing agent , yields N @-@ <unk> . This intermediate is then hydrolyzed using hydrochloric acid , and subsequently <unk> , extracted with organic solvent , concentrated , and distilled to yield the free base . The free base is then dissolved in an organic solvent , sulfuric acid added , and amphetamine precipitates out as the sulfate salt . 
 A number of chiral resolutions have been developed to separate the two enantiomers of amphetamine . For example , racemic amphetamine can be treated with d @-@ tartaric acid to form a <unk> salt which is fractionally crystallized to yield dextroamphetamine . Chiral resolution remains the most economical method for obtaining optically pure amphetamine on a large scale . In addition , several enantioselective syntheses of amphetamine have been developed . In one example , optically pure ( R ) -1 @-@ phenyl @-@ <unk> is condensed with phenylacetone to yield a chiral Schiff base . In the key step , this intermediate is reduced by catalytic hydrogenation with a transfer of chirality to the carbon atom alpha to the amino group . Cleavage of the benzylic amine bond by hydrogenation yields optically pure dextroamphetamine . 
 A large number of alternative synthetic routes to amphetamine have been developed based on classic organic reactions . One example is the Friedel – Crafts alkylation of <unk> by allyl chloride to yield beta <unk> which is then reacted with ammonia to produce racemic amphetamine ( method 2 ) . Another example employs the Ritter reaction ( method 3 ) . In this route , <unk> is reacted acetonitrile in sulfuric acid to yield an <unk> which in turn is treated with sodium hydroxide to give amphetamine via an acetamide intermediate . A third route starts with ethyl 3 @-@ <unk> which through a double alkylation with methyl iodide followed by <unk> chloride can be converted into 2 @-@ methyl @-@ 3 @-@ phenyl @-@ <unk> acid . This synthetic intermediate can be transformed into amphetamine using either a Hofmann or Curtius rearrangement ( method 4 ) . 
 A significant number of amphetamine syntheses feature a reduction of a nitro , imine , oxime or other nitrogen @-@ containing functional groups . In one such example , a Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with <unk> yields phenyl @-@ 2 @-@ <unk> . The double bond and nitro group of this intermediate is reduced using either catalytic hydrogenation or by treatment with lithium aluminium hydride ( method 5 ) . Another method is the reaction of phenylacetone with ammonia , producing an imine intermediate that is reduced to the primary amine using hydrogen over a palladium catalyst or lithium aluminum hydride ( method 6 ) . 
 = = = Detection in body fluids = = = 
 Amphetamine is frequently measured in urine or blood as part of a drug test for sports , employment , poisoning diagnostics , and forensics . Techniques such as immunoassay , which is the most common form of amphetamine test , may cross @-@ react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs . Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false positive results . Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug , whether prescription amphetamine , prescription amphetamine <unk> , ( e.g. , selegiline ) , over @-@ the @-@ counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine , or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines . Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite , including <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , lisdexamfetamine , <unk> , methamphetamine , <unk> , and selegiline , among others . These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on drug tests . Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard drug test for approximately 24 hours , although a high dose may be detectable for two to four days . 
 For the assays , a study noted that an enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique ( EMIT ) assay for amphetamine and methamphetamine may produce more false positives than liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry . Gas chromatography – mass spectrometry ( GC – MS ) of amphetamine and methamphetamine with the <unk> agent ( S ) - ( − ) <unk> chloride allows for the detection of methamphetamine in urine . GC – MS of amphetamine and methamphetamine with the chiral <unk> agent Mosher 's acid chloride allows for the detection of both dextroamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine in urine . Hence , the latter method may be used on samples that test positive using other methods to help distinguish between the various sources of the drug . 
 = = History , society , and culture = = 
 Amphetamine was first synthesized in 1887 in Germany by Romanian chemist Lazăr <unk> who named it <unk> ; its stimulant effects remained unknown until 1927 , when it was independently resynthesized by Gordon Alles and reported to have sympathomimetic properties . Amphetamine had no pharmacological use until 1934 , when Smith , Kline and French began selling it as an inhaler under the trade name Benzedrine as a decongestant . Benzedrine sulfate was introduced three years later and found a wide variety of medical applications , including narcolepsy . During World War II , amphetamine and methamphetamine were used extensively by both the Allied and Axis forces for their stimulant and performance @-@ enhancing effects . As the addictive properties of the drug became known , governments began to place strict controls on the sale of amphetamine . For example , during the early 1970s in the United States , amphetamine became a schedule II controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act . In spite of strict government controls , amphetamine has been used legally or illicitly by people from a variety of backgrounds , including authors , musicians , mathematicians , and athletes . 
 Amphetamine is still illegally synthesized today in clandestine labs and sold on the black market , primarily in European countries . Among European Union ( EU ) member states , 1 @.@ 2 million young adults used illicit amphetamine or methamphetamine in 2013 . During 2012 , approximately 5 @.@ 9 metric tons of illicit amphetamine were seized within EU member states ; the " street price " of illicit amphetamine within the EU ranged from € 6 – 38 per gram during the same period . Outside Europe , the illicit market for amphetamine is much smaller than the market for methamphetamine and MDMA . 
 = = = Legal status = = = 
 As a result of the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances , amphetamine became a schedule II controlled substance , as defined in the treaty , in all ( 183 ) state parties . Consequently , it is heavily regulated in most countries . Some countries , such as South Korea and Japan , have banned substituted amphetamines even for medical use . In other nations , such as Canada ( schedule I drug ) , the Netherlands ( List I drug ) , the United States ( schedule II drug ) , Australia ( schedule 8 ) , Thailand ( category 1 narcotic ) , and United Kingdom ( class B drug ) , amphetamine is in a restrictive national drug schedule that allows for its use as a medical treatment .
