 Sweden appointed a Governor General , who in addition to having the highest authority of the government , also was the highest military officer . The first to hold the post of Governor General was Gustaf Otto Stenbock , between 1658 to 1664 . His residence was in the largest city , Malmö . 
 The office of Governor General was abandoned in 1669 , deemed unnecessary . However , when the Scanian War erupted in 1675 , the office was reinstated , and Fabian von <unk> held the office between 1675 to 1677 , when he died in the defence of Malmö . 
 He was replaced by Rutger von Ascheberg , in 1680 , who held it to his death in 1693 . It was during Ascheberg 's time in office that the stricter policy of <unk> was initiated , as a reaction to the threats of war and possible Danish repossession . 
 Following the death of Ascheberg , the Governor Generalship was dismantled into a separate county governor for each of the Swedish provinces Blekinge , Halland and Scania . However , a Governor Generalship was reinstated in the province of Scania during the Napoleonic War , when Johan Christopher Toll became the last Governor @-@ General in the region , a post he held 1801 – 09 .

 The complete history of Skåneland was not taught for a long time in schools in Skåneland , especially during periods with the immediate threat of revolt . Instead a Swedish @-@ centric history was taught , and the Scanian history before 1658 , for instance concerning the list of monarchs , was disregarded as a component of Danish history . In reaction , a movement began in the late 19th century to revive awareness of the history and culture of Skåneland . The renewed focus resulted in the publication of several books about Scanian history .

 " I Could Fall in Love " is a song recorded by American Tejano singer Selena for her fifth studio album , Dreaming of You ( 1995 ) , released posthumously by EMI Latin on June 26 , 1995 . " I Could Fall in Love " and " Tú Sólo Tú " were the album 's lead promotional recordings , showcasing her musical transition from Spanish- to English @-@ language songs . The lyrics explore feelings of heartbreak and despair and express the singer 's fear of rejection by a man she finds herself falling in love with . Composed by Keith Thomas , " I Could Fall in Love " is a pop ballad with R & B , soul and soft rock influences . 
 Critics praised Selena 's emotive enunciation and compared it to work by Celine Dion , Brandy Norwood and TLC . It received the Tejano Music Award for the Tejano Crossover Song of the Year , and the American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers ( ASCAP ) recognized it at the ASCAP Pop Music Awards as one of the most performed songs of 1995 . Because of the recording 's composition structure and the singer 's vocalization , OC Weekly , BuzzFeed , Neon Tommy , and Latina magazine , believed " I Could Fall in Love " was one of the best songs recorded by Selena in her musical career . 
 The track was not released as a commercial single in the United States , where it was feared that it might sell more copies than the album itself . " I Could Fall in Love " peaked at number eight on the US Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart , and at number one on the Canadian RPM Adult Contemporary and US Billboard Latin Pop Airplay charts . It reached the top ten on the singles charts of Canada and New Zealand . It became the most played song in Kansas City , Miami , and Boston and the second most played in Los Angeles . 
 The accompanying music video , directed by Hector Galan , featured a montage of pictures and videos of live performances of Selena , which had been collected by her family . It , too , was released posthumously , and it received a Music Video of the Year nomination at the 1996 Tejano Music Awards . " I Could Fall in Love " became one of Selena 's most famous and recognizable recordings , and in the 1990s it became a popular wedding song . Cover versions include recordings by Adrienne Bailon , Jennifer Lopez , Gloria Estefan , Lisa Leuschner , Solange Knowles and Ali @-@ Ollie Woodson .

 Before Selena signed a recording contract in 1989 with EMI Latin , she had hinted that she wanted to start recording in English . She was asked to make three demonstration recordings for Charles Koppelman , chairman of EMI Records . After reviewing them , Koppelman declined a crossover attempt , believing that Selena should first strengthen her fan base . Later , after releasing five Spanish @-@ language albums that all achieved unprecedented milestones in the Latin music industry , Koppelman considered that Selena had reached her peak in the Spanish market , and he began preparations for a crossover album . 
 Selena and her record @-@ producer brother A.B. Quintanilla III arrived in Nashville , Tennessee , intending to collaborate with producer @-@ songwriter Keith Thomas . Thomas had prepared the instrumental parts for " I Could Fall in Love " but had not had time to complete the vocal parts , so he sang it for them . Selena and A.B. immediately liked it , and A.B. said that he wanted Selena to include it in her album . She recorded it in December 1994 at The Bennett House in Franklin , Tennessee , and Bill Whittington mixed it with assistance from Mike Corbett and Todd Moore . Although Selena had to return later when Thomas was able to provide additional vocals , Selena 's husband Chris Perez , who had overseen the recording sessions , said that the recording was completed on March 25 , 1995 . 
 On March 31 , 1995 Selena was murdered in Corpus Christi , Texas , by her friend and former employee Yolanda Saldívar . Thomas later announced that he had been working on another track for Selena to record , telling Biography that the track remained unfinished . " I Could Fall in Love " was released as the lead promotional recording for the 1995 album Dreaming of You on June 26 , 1995 , at the same time as " Tú Sólo Tú " , to demonstrate Selena 's transition from Spanish- to English @-@ language recordings . " I Could Fall in Love " debuted on US radios on June 15 , 1995 to contemporary hit radios , Top 40 , and rhythmic contemporary airplay , while " Tú Sólo Tú " targeted Latin music radios such as Tejano , Latin pop , and regional Mexican airplay . An editor from the Arizona Daily Star believed " I Could Fall in Love " was targeted more towards adult contemporary radios than R & B and top 40 radio formats that were successful for Gloria Estefan . 
 " I Could Fall in Love " was released as a maxi single on June 26 , 1995 in Australia and Mexico and on 10 August 1995 in Germany . A maxi single featuring " Dreaming of You " and " Sukiyaki " was released in Japan . " Tú Sólo Tú " was released primarily to Spanish @-@ speaking countries . Fred Bronson of Billboard commented that if EMI Latin had released " I Could Fall in Love " as a single and it had debuted in the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart , then it would have been the first posthumous debut single to do so since " Pledging My Love " by Johnny Ace in 1955 . 
 = = Composition and lyrics = = 
 " I Could Fall in Love " is a mid @-@ tempo pop ballad and R & B song with soul and soft rock influences . Mario Tarradell , an editorial writer for The Dallas Morning News , called the song a " mundane ballad " . It is set in common time and employs an electronic piano , drum machine , a violin , and a flute in the background . The instrumentation includes bass drum , keyboard , flamenco guitar , Spanish guitar , and synthesizers . " I Could Fall in Love " is written in the key of E major , to be played in a moderate groove at 78 half notes per minute . The vocal range of the melody extends from the note F ♯ 3 to A4 . Sandy Masuo of the St. Louis Post @-@ Dispatch wrote , " These songs [ " I Could Fall in Love " , " I 'm Getting Used to You " and " Captive Heart " ] were to be her armaments in the crossover war and , sure enough , they 're catchy , state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art pop / R & B – but , despite the sublime melody of " I Could Fall in Love " , strikingly anonymous . " An editor from the Contra Costa Times called the song a " jazzy ballad " . Donny Brusca 's book BPM List 2006 : Main Edition classified it as " light @-@ adult contemporary " . Andrew Griffin of The Town Talk called it a " Tex @-@ Mex ( Texas @-@ Mexico ) pop " song . 
 " I Could Fall in Love " is similar to " Dreaming of You " in its lyrics . Many media outlets , including the Milwaukee Journal and Billboard magazine , called them " confessional ballads " , with an emotionally vulnerable narrator who wants true love but finds it unattainable . Tarradell believed " I Could Fall in Love " was an indirect response to Selena 's father and manager Abraham Quintanilla , Jr . , who forced her and Perez to end their relationship just because Perez was a rocker . Tarradell asserted that the words " I know it 's not right but I guess I should try to do what I should do " were directed at Abraham and reflected Selena 's realization of her independence . Ramiro Burr of the San Antonio Express @-@ News believed that Selena 's 1992 song " Missing My Baby " shared similarities with " I Could Fall in Love " in expressing uncontrollable " adrenalin @-@ fueled love " . Burr later wrote that the difference in " I Could Fall in Love " is that the lyrics are recorded with " powerful agony " which forces the narrator to " fall into a phase of deep loneliness " because her lover may or may not reciprocate her feelings . 
 The first verse of " I Could Fall in Love " implores the object of the singer 's desire to walk away , because her emotions are too overpowering and she feels love of unprecedented intensity . She fears that by allowing him to stay attached , she may " lose control " . Selena believes that her infatuation can lead to romantic love . She then sings " I could fall in love ( in love ) with you " before wondering how she would feel if she were to touch him for the first time . The fear of being rejected and unloved leads her to keep her feelings to herself , and she begins to believe that her love is " not right " . She continues , " and I guess I should try / to do what I should do / but I could fall in love / fall in love with you " . During the midpoint break , Selena sings in Spanish that she is always dreaming about him , imagining that he loves her . She sings the chorus twice before the song comes to an end without her ever having come to terms with her loved one . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 " I Could Fall in Love " received a generally positive response from music critics , who commented on its similarities to songs recorded by other artists . Ed Morales of Vibe magazine felt that , because of its syncopated drums , " I Could Fall in Love " had a " Jon Secada @-@ like feel " , and it reminded Tarradell of songs recorded by American singer Brandy Norwood and by the trio TLC . An editor from the Star @-@ News thought the song had " a whiff of " Celine Dion . James Hunter , also from Vibe , praised Selena 's astute interpretation , calling it a " masterpiece " and commenting that Selena 's death made the track more difficult to listen to . Larry Flick of Billboard described " I Could Fall in Love " as an " optimistic love song " that left " melancholy thoughts of what might have been " in the mind of the listener . John Lannert , also from Billboard , conceived " I Could Fall in Love " as a " sensuous narrative " recording and a " seductive romantic confessional " . Tarradell , writing in The Beaver County Times , called it a " crossover staple " . 
 Mary Talbot of the New York Daily News , praised Selena 's " soft , velvety voice " . A San Jose Mercury News reporter wrote that " I Could Fall in Love " and " Dreaming of You " helped Selena to become " the new Gloria Estefan " . Richard Torres of Newsday considered both these songs to be romantic anthems . Enrique Fernandez of the Sun Sentinel described " I Could Fall in Love " as " beautiful " , while an editor from The Sacramento Bee called the song a " Latin @-@ influenced R & B lite " . Because of its " overly simplistic and repetitive lyrics " , Ramiro Burr of the San Antonio Express @-@ News assessed " I Could Fall in Love " as the " weakest track " of Dreaming of You . 
 Elizabeth Rodriguez Kessler and Anne Perrin wrote in their 2007 book Chican @ s in the Conversations that " I Could Fall in Love " was a " clean pop offering " . Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle commented in 2008 that it had " made the Tejano goddess a posthumous crossover star " . On 31 March 2010 , Teresa Jusino of Popmatters expressed the view that English @-@ speaking music fans no longer remember Selena 's name , saying that on playing " Dreaming of You " or " I Could Fall in Love " , many would say " I remember that song ! " or " I love that one ! " . Randi Bergman of Fashion magazine , called the number an " epic ballad " .

 Davitt Sigerson , the president and CEO of EMI records , feared that " I Could Fall in Love " might sell more copies than the album itself , so he did not issue the single as a commercial release .

He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the field artillery on 9 June 1928 , but on 8 September he commenced flight training at Brooks Field , Texas .

As such , he reported to Major General Oliver P. Echols , the head of the Air Material Command . 
 The Chief of USAAF , General Henry H. Arnold , designated Echols as the USAAF liaison with the Manhattan Project . In turn , Echols designated Wilson as his alternative , and it was Wilson who became Manhattan Project 's main USAAF contact . The director of the Manhattan Project , Major General Leslie Groves later wrote that : 
 [ Wilson ] was a most fortunate choice , for his personality and professional competence ensured the smooth co @-@ operation essential to our success . Through his efforts , the necessary air support was always provided by the subordinate Air Force commands , if not willingly , at least without delay . 
 While I can say the same of every other Air Force officer with whom I had any dealings in the project , I have always felt particularly grateful to Wilson , for he had to bear the brunt of all our many minor problems with the Air Force as well as a major responsibility for a number of our principal activities . I am sure that he must have had many difficult moments with his Air Force colleagues , as he denied them , for security reasons , information they considered essential to understand the reasons for his requests . 
 Wilson was posted to Britain from March to April 1944 , where he was involved in an exchange of technical information with the Royal Air Force .

 = Samuel J. Briskin = 
 Samuel J. Briskin ( February 8 , 1896 – November 14 , 1968 ) was one of the foremost producers of Hollywood 's Golden Age , who was the head of production during his career of 3 of the " Big 8 " major film studios of its Golden Age : Columbia ( twice ) , Paramount , and RKO . In the late 1950s he would also serve briefly on the board of directors of another major , MGM . During World War II Briskin served in the Army 's Signal Corps as a film producer , attaining the rank of Lieutenant Colonel . After the war he co @-@ founded Liberty Films with Frank Capra , who were later joined by William Wyler and George Stevens . The studio only produced two films , but both are now considered classics : It 's a Wonderful Life and State of the Union . All three of his brothers were also film producers , as well as one of his sons , and his sister was married to the eventual Chairman of Columbia , where Briskin spent the last decade of his life as a vice @-@ president and head of production until his death in 1968 from a heart attack . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Briskin was born on February 8 , 1896 in either Riga , Russia or New York City . His Parents were Benjamin and Rose Briskin . Two of his brothers , Irving and Murray also became film producers , while his sister , Ida , married a film studio executive . Briskin also had one other brother , Barnett ( Barney ) , who was also in the film industry as a theater manager and in sales capacities . While some sources have his birthplace is Riga , Russia , others indicate that he was born in New York , after his parents immigrated there . Briskin was a product of the public school system . He obtained his college degree in accounting from the College of the City of New York . 
 = = Career = = 
 = = = Silent era = = = 
 After graduating college , Briskin worked as an accountant . Briskin entered the film industry as an accountant at Cohn @-@ Brandt @-@ Cohn Film Sales in 1920 . In 1924 , when the Cohn brothers incorporated CBC as Columbia Pictures , he left the studio and created an independent production company with George H. Davis named Banner Productions . The company was scheduled to produce 8 films , four on the east coast and four in California . The company was incorporated in May 1924 , and produced over 20 films between 1925 and 1927 . Briskin gave his brother , Irving , his start in the film industry , as an auditor for Banner . Irving would go on to be a film producer in his own right . The company 's first film was The Truth About Women , a 1924 melodrama directed by Burton King , and starring Hope Hampton and Lowell Sherman . The picture was filmed at the Whitman Bennett Studios near Yonkers , New York . The next film Briskin would produce was The Man Without a Heart , again directed by King and filmed at the Bennett Studios , this time starring Kenneth Harlan and Jane Novak . In addition to producing the films , Briskin would also travel around the country making sales deals for the company 's films . In 1925 Briskin would produce the melodrama , The Phantom Express , starring Ethel Shannon and George <unk> . This was followed in 1926 by the film Brooding Eyes , starring the legendary Lionel Barrymore . 
 1926 saw Briskin take a film crew on location to Sonora , Mexico , shooting for Whispering Canyon , starring Jane Novak and Robert Ellis . Late in 1926 Briskin 's sister , Ida Briskin , was wed to Abe Schneider , an exec at Columbia Pictures . Late in 1926 , George Davis died suddenly , and Briskin dissolved Banner . 
 = = = The advent of sound and Columbia Pictures = = = 
 After Banner , Briskin returned to work at Columbia Pictures , where he began producing for them in 1926 , and in 1928 he was given control over 18 of their productions . By 1929 , Briskin had risen to be a top executive at the studio , sharing honors with studio head Harry Cohn , in giving the closing address at Columbia 's annual sales meeting in July 1929 . By the end of 1929 , Briskin was the assistant general manager of Columbia , and on a visit to New York City signed several Broadway playwrights to long @-@ term contracts with the studio , including Elmer Harris , Jo Swerling , and Paul Hervey Fox . Not only was Briskin active in the production office at Columbia , but he also played on Columbia 's baseball team , which competed in the Motion Picture Baseball League . It was while working at Columbia that Briskin met Frank Capra . In 1930 , Briskin 's brother Irving , who he had employed while at Banner , joined him as a producer at Columbia . 
 By the early 1930s , Briskin had gained a reputation of being a very thrifty producer . However , he was also known for putting the quality of the product over saving money . Joseph Walker , the cinematographer for the 1931 film <unk> , directed by Frank Capra , explained why the film had not used stock footage of blimps , which would have been much less expensive : 
 [ Briskin ] , the studio 's general manager , who personally supervised the making of the picture , and who is perhaps more keenly exacting in the matter of getting a full dollar 's worth of production for every dollar spent than any other executive in the business , was wise enough to see that an otherwise superlative production would fall flat if such scenes were made " merely adequate " . Therefore he spared no expense in assuring absolute authenticity in every detail of the production . 
 In 1931 Harry Cohn became the first studio head to implement the new unit production system , wherein producers were given specific responsibility over individual films , rather than supervising dozens of pictures in a given year . Briskin was one of the first four of this new class of producer selected by Cohn , while still maintaining his assistant general manager status . In 1932 Briskin went from assistant general manager , to general manager at Columbia , the announcement being made by in early June by Sam Cohn . 
 In February 1933 , Briskin 's home was burglarized , the thieves absconding with $ 24 @,@ 000 ( in 1933 dollars ) in jewels . Also in 1933 , Briskin was appointed as the studios ' representative for the producers @-@ actors code committee . In February 1934 Briskin was named as the chairman of the Research Council of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ( AMPAS ) . The following month Briskin was also appointed to the finance committee overseeing the Research Council . By 1934 , Briskin 's brother , Irving , was one of the Columbia 's unit producers . 
 In 1934 Briskin was selected to be one of the personnel representing the film studios in their negotiations with the Motion Picture Theater Owners of America . Among the others representing the producers included Louis B. Mayer , Hal Roach , Jack L. Warner , B. B. Kahane , and Harold Lloyd . By this point , Briskin was considered one of the most important studio executives in the industry , being included a group called by some " the brain trust " , which also included Hal B. Wallis , Jack L. Warner , B. B. Kahane , Harold Lloyd , Hal Roach , and Irving Thalberg . In June 1934 Briskin , acting as a representative for 8 major studios , met with representatives from film camera manufacturers , in an attempt to reach an agreement between the two sides to pool their resources in order to develop a silent film camera . In September 1934 , Briskin signed a new contract with Columbia , after having been courted by Paramount . Later that month , he was elected to the producers branch of AMPAS , as well as being appointed a member of the executive committee . When the 1932 agreement between studios and freelance screenwriters expired in 1935 , Briskin was selected as one of five producers , the others being Sol Wurtzel , Irving Thalberg , Hal Wallis , and Henry <unk> , to represent the studios in the negotiations . In addition to representing the producers in their negotiations with the writers , Briskin was also selected as one of six producers to negotiate the new contract with the actors ' guild . In August 1935 Briskin was renegotiating his contract with Columbia . Speculation began that he was being approached by other studios , including MGM . 
 = = = RKO years = = = 
 In September 1935 , after seven years , Briskin resigned from Columbia , failing to reach an agreement with Harry Cohn over stock options . For years , many in the film industry knew that Briskin was responsible for many of the successes at Columbia , even though studio head Harry Cohn was taking the credit . Shortly after , reports began to circulate that he was headed to 20th Century @-@ Fox . Shortly after that report , he was offered a front @-@ office position at MGM , but turned it down because he wanted to be more actively involved in film production , which was followed by a denial from Fox that he was headed to that studio . One of the rumors which circulated was that Briskin was part of a group aligned with Consolidated Film Industries , which was attempting a takeover of Universal . By year 's end , Briskin had agreed to a deal with Warner Bros. to produce 12 films , however that deal never reached fruition and Briskin ended up agreeing to a deal with RKO to join the studio as their vice @-@ president in charge of production . The position was newly created especially for Briskin . B. B. Kahane remained as the overall head of RKO Studios , running all aspects other than production , but there was concern that Briskin would have conflict with long @-@ term RKO producer , Pandro S. Berman . Conflict was averted when Berman received a one @-@ year extension on his contract , wherein he had sole authority over his productions , answering only directly to Kahane . 
 That arrangement did not last long , and by February 1936 , Briskin 's role at the studio was changing . While still with the same title , he was no longer subservient to Kahane , having full control over all RKO production . In February 1936 Briskin was mentioned along with a handful of other producers as being in such demand that they could write their own ticket , the others mentioned included Thalberg , David O. Selznick , Darryl F. Zanuck , Hunt Stromberg , and Sol Wurtzel . By April of that year , Briskin was putting his mark on RKO . He purchased quite a few properties , signed numerous actors , and lured successful producers to the studio , such as Edward Small . Later that year , RKO gained the rights to the successful Irish play , The Plough and the Stars , by playwright Seán O 'Casey . This led to Briskin being responsible for bringing Barry Fitzgerald to Hollywood for his American film debut . Fitzgerald was one of four members of the play 's original cast at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin , who Briskin signed to appear in the film version of the same name . By the middle of the year , RKO was solidly Briskin 's , with the full backing of studio head Leo Spitz , This led to Kahane , who had been with the studio since its inception , resigning in August , several months prior to the expiration of his contract , and heading to a vice @-@ presidency at Columbia . For the upcoming 1936 – 37 production season , Briskin announced that he intended to have at least three star @-@ caliber performers in each film . In September , Briskin was elected to the AMPAS board of governors , along with several others including Clark Gable , Darryl Zanuck , and Cecil B. DeMille . The following month , Briskin initiated a policy wherein the younger players under contract to RKO could appear in stage productions in stock and little theater companies for short periods , in order for the actors to gain experience . Also in October , Briskin was chosen to succeed Louis B. Mayer as chairman of the motion picture community chest . In 1936 Briskin led RKO to its most productive year up to that date . Before the end of the year , a new medium was being introduced , television . When asked about the threat this new entertainment source might pose to the film industry , Briskin thought that TV would actually help films . He felt that it might be the " ... greatest thing that could happen to the industry . " <unk> that " ... 10 years ago when radio broadcasting began many feared people would sit at home with earphones and listen to the free radio entertainment . Instead , the movies have had their best years since radio broadcasting came in ... " In December , reports began to surface that he was up for a long term contract at RKO , however , due to an impending reorganization , he was only given a one @-@ year extension , with a promise of a long @-@ term deal once the reorganization was complete . Briskin made the decision to begin color films at RKO . He was also responsible for bringing the Poverty Row producer , Maury M. Cohen , into RKO . 
 In 1937 Briskin was responsible for bringing Milton Berle to the screen . During a strike by the Federated Motion Picture Crafts union in 1937 , there was concern that they would be joined by members of the Screen Actors Guild . Briskin was one of four producers chosen by the producers guild to negotiate with the actors ' union to head off them joining the walkout . As the new film season started in the summer of 1937 , Briskin announced that RKO would have a significant increase in their overall production budget from $ 14 @.@ 5 million in the 1936 – 37 season , to $ 18 million for the 1937 – 38 season . In mid @-@ July 1937 , it was announced that Briskin had received a long @-@ term extension on his contract , however , several months later it was revealed that the deal had never been finalized , and that Briskin was considering leaving RKO . In early November the change became official when Briskin resigned as RKO 's head of production . Briskin had been offered a three @-@ year deal by the studio , which he rejected . Rumors began to circulate about where Briskin was headed . In early December it was being reported that Briskin would be heading to Paramount , although he denied those reports . 
 = = = Return to Columbia = = = 
 As 1938 began , there was much speculation as to where Briskin would go next . He was considered one of the top film executives in the industry . In mid @-@ May , it was reported that Briskin was in negotiations with Sam Cohn to return to his former studio , Columbia , in the role of general manager . However , his name was still being discussed for other major positions throughout the industry , such as the production head at Universal Pictures . On May 26 it was announced that Briskin and Columbia had reached a 7 @-@ year agreement for him to take over as the head of the production at the studio , where he resumed his former position of general manager on May 30 . As part of the agreement , Briskin was issued stock options on 10 @,@ 000 shares of Columbia stock , with a value of $ 13 @.@ 875 per share . Briskin 's return to Columbia would also reunite him with his brother , Irving , who had been a producer at Columbia for several years . Samuel Briskin 's would be one of the top money earners in Hollywood in 1938 , his earnings topping $ 106 @,@ 000 , putting him in the top 10 at Columbia . 
 Later in 1938 , when there was a pending hearing and lawsuit alleging unfair labor practices by the studios against directors , Briskin was chosen to be one of three producers representing the studios , alongside Darryl Zanuck and E. J. Mannix . Sitting across the table were W. S. Van Dyke , Howard Hawks , and Briskin 's friend , Frank Capra . In 1939 , Briskin was once again involved in potential legal proceedings , being one of a number of producers who were called to testify before the National Labor Relations Board , regarding alleged infractions by the studios against the Screen Writers Guild ( SWG ) . During the hearings , it was alleged that Briskin had opposed the proposed merger between the SWG and the Authors Guild . After the outbreak of hostilities in Europe and Asia at the beginning of World War II , AMPAS created the Motion Picture Defense Committee , which was a sub @-@ committee of the organization 's Research Council . Headed by the council 's chairman , Darryl F. Zanuck , Briskin was one of several producers named to the committee . The group was formed to advise various arms of the U.S. government in the creation and production of training films . Shortly after the committee 's formation , it was decided that the facilities of Hollywood film studios would be made available to the army to use for filming and production . In mid @-@ November 1940 Briskin , along with the committee 's chair Major Nathan Levinson , participated in interviews with members of the Screen Writers Guild , in order to select writers to go to Monmouth , New Jersey to work with army personnel on developing scripts for training films . 
 = = = The war years = = = 
 In 1941 the U.S. Government announced an effort to increase cooperation between the different countries in North and South America , through the use of film . Nelson D. Rockefeller chaired the government committee , and requested the help of the Association of Motion Picture Producers . Y. Frank Freeman , the associations chairman , appointed Briskin the chair of the committee on South American Film Facilities . When the Motion Picture Defense Committee was expanded in 1941 , Briskin continued to be one of the six producers . In April 1941 , Harry Cohn promoted Briskin to Head of Production at Columbia . Briskin joined the Army Signal Corps as a reserve officer , commissioned as a major , and was put in charge of the film division of the War Committee . After the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese on December 7 , 1941 , there was concern that film professionals in Hollywood who were officers in the armed forces reserves might be called to active duty . By May 1942 , Briskin was acknowledged as the vice @-@ chair of the Motion Picture Defense Committee . In that month , he and chair Nathan Levinson created a sub @-@ committee in order to find more technicians to enlist in the Signal Corps . In June Briskin was rewarded with a six @-@ year contract by Columbia , at a rate of $ 2000 per week , as well as stock options . 
 In August 1942 Briskin 's duties at Columbia were divided between Harry Cohn and Sydney Buchman , in anticipation of his being called up to active duty in the Army . Briskin was called to active duty by September , with Buchman resigning his position as President of the Screen Writers Guild to handle Briskin 's responsibilities at Columbia . While on active duty , Columbia continued to keep Briskin under contract , although at a reduced salary of $ 300 per week . One of Briskin 's roles in the Army Signal Corps was recruiting industry personnel to serve as cameramen and photographers for the army . In a report lamenting the loss of talent from Hollywood to the armed services , Briskin was one of four producers cited , along with Darryl Zanuck , Hal Roach , and John Hay Whitney . In late March 1943 Briskin suffered a heart attack while on active military service . Briskin received a medical discharge from the Army Signal Corps in May 1944 . During his military service , Briskin was awarded the Legion of Merit . In July 1944 , Briskin returned to Columbia , detaching from the Army with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel . Shortly after his return to civilian life , Briskin parted ways with Columbia in September 1944 . 
 = = = Liberty Pictures = = = 
 Shortly after Briskin left Columbia , it was announced that he would begin a production company with his long @-@ time friend , Frank Capra , the company 's highlight to be an annual Capra film . Because Capra was still on active duty in the Army , Briskin was in charge of opening the company offices , and negotiating distribution deals , preparing the company to begin production as soon as Capra was discharged . Initially , the company was simply known as Capra @-@ Briskin . 
 As this was happening , Briskin was asked to return to active duty , this time in the Navy , for a brief stint in the beginning of March , 1945 ; he was assigned to the Photographic Sciences Laboratory , where he was to evaluate the Navy 's filming activity . By the end of the month , he had finished his study , and submitted his findings to Captain Gene Markey , head of the Navy 's Photographic Services , after which he returned to Hollywood to continue setting up Capra @-@ Briskin . With Capra still in the service , Briskin incorporated the new film studio , with the name Liberty Films , in late April 1945 . One of the first properties they went after was the hugely successful play , Harvey . In July , they convinced William Wyler to join their fledgling company , and he became part @-@ owner , agreeing to start work for the company as soon as he was discharged from the army , and produce one film per year for the studio . In August , Briskin negotiated a deal with RKO Studios for Liberty Pictures to film 9 movies at the RKO studio , and in September Wyler announced that the company would produce 3 films a year for their deal with RKO . Before the end of the year George Stevens had also become a part owner in the venture . 
 The company announced in November 1945 that its first production would be James Stewart in It 's a Wonderful Life , produced and directed by Capra . In Spring 1946 it was announced that Liberty would be getting a fifth partner , producer @-@ director Victor Fleming , although that deal never saw fruition . The film was released in November 1946 , but was a financial failure . Although it was in the top 7 % of that year 's films as ranked by box office gross , it was unable to recoup its high production cost of $ 2 @.@ 3 million , much less show a profit . After the film 's release , Briskin became an outspoken advocate for the policy of longer runs for films , allowing them to recoup the cost of production . Without longer runs , he told The Film Daily , the quality of films would decline , as production costs continued to escalate . 
 While the studio was receiving positive critical reviews , it was struggling financially . In March 1947 , rumors began to circulate regarding the company being taken over by one of the major studios . The studio 's next film , State of the Union , starring Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn , was scheduled to be distributed by MGM . In addition to the MGM deal with Capra , Briskin sought out distribution deals with other major studios , including Paramount . The partners sought a major studio to buy Liberty Films before bank foreclosure , although Wyler and Stevens were " violently opposed " to the idea at first . In April rumors began to circulate that a deal was in the offing for a sale of the company to Paramount Pictures . Those rumors were confirmed the following month when Paramount bought Liberty . The four partners were given a total of between $ 3 @,@ 450 @,@ 000 and $ 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in Paramount stock , and Capra , Wyler , and Stevens were offered five @-@ picture contracts at Paramount . Briskin was given a studio executive position at Paramount which was specifically created for him , but Stevens decided not to accept the Paramount offer and continued as an independent producer . The deal took several months to reach fruition , finally culminating when the US Treasury signed off on the tax setup in September 1947 . Briskin would stay at Paramount as a senior production executive through 1950 . 
 = = = The Paramount years = = = 
 As the new decade dawned , it was speculated that Briskin would sign an agreement with Paramount Studios , in charge of production under Y. Frank Freeman , in the new position , Briskin would function as the de facto head of production for the studio . After accepting the position , his tenure was short lived , as he resigned in January 1951 , due to an undisclosed illness , although he remained employed by the studio . By April , it was announced that Briskin would remain at Paramount , and had signed a five @-@ year contract to produce for the studio . In July 1951 Briskin was selected to head up the " Movie Town U.S.A. " radio advertising campaign for the Council of Motion Picture Companies ( <unk> ) . The <unk> campaign was scheduled to debut on October 8 , 1951 with over 200 acting stars and other Hollywood personalities volunteering their time to make personal appearances in all 48 of the U.S. State capitals , although those locations were later changed to 33 major cities , due to a scheduling conflict with many of the state governors . In addition to his responsibilities at Paramount and with <unk> , in late 1951 Briskin partnered with Sol Lesser to produce 6 films , which were distributed by United Artists . All the films were scheduled for a 1952 release , and Briskin was partly responsible for the financing along with Edward Small , as well as having production oversight . At the time , it was considered a very important independent partnership by the Hollywood community . The partnership , known as Associated Players and Producers , was short @-@ lived , producing only one of the six films agreed to with Universal , Kansas City Confidential , a film noir starring John Payne . 
 In January 1953 , Briskin was appointed to the executive board of the Screen Producers Guild . 
 While at Paramount , in 1955 , he produced the highly commercially successful Strategic Air Command , starring James Stewart . After the success of Strategic Air Command , Paramount obtained the rights to The Sons of Katie Elder , and assigned the project to Briskin to produce , with Alan Ladd starring . However , when Ladd brought out the remainder of his contract with Paramount , the film was put on hold , and would not be produced until 1965 , by a different producer , Hal B. Wallis . In May 1956 , Briskin asked to be released from the final two years of his agreement with Paramount , to which the studio agreed . The one condition was that Briskin finish work on his remaining film commitment to the studio , The Joker is Wild , starring Frank Sinatra , which was being produced by an independent film company , <unk> Productions , under an agreement with Paramount . 
 = = = MGM controversy and return to Columbia = = = 
 In 1957 Briskin was embroiled in a controversy related to the control of MGM . As part of a battle between Joseph R. Vogel and Joseph Tomlinson , Briskin was brought in as a member of the Board of Directors of MGM , along with MGM 's former production head , Louis B. Mayer , and also as a producer for the studio . However , the special board meeting which was held to appoint the two executives was held to be illegal by the Delaware Chancery Court , and the Mayer and Briskin appointments were overturned . The conflict continued on throughout the year , until MGM held a stockholders ' meeting in October . During the meeting , the shareholders agreed to expand the board by adding ten new directors . Tomlinson 's group was clearly routed , gaining only a single seat of the ten ; that single seat was Briskin . 
 His seat on MGM 's board would last less than a year . After the unexpected death of studio head Harry Cohn in late February 1958 , Columbia 's board of directors selected a committee to pursue hiring his replacement . In early April it was confirmed that Briskin was one of those who they were considering . In April 1958 Briskin resigned from MGM , in order to return to Columbia , this time as Vice President in Charge of West Coast Activities . In addition to his executive production roles , Briskin was also made one of 9 members of Fico 's board of directors . Fico was a company formed with the express purpose of buying up shares of Columbia stock on the open market as a way to display confidence in the company . By the end of 1958 , Briskin was Vice President and General Manager of the studio . In April 1959 , Briskin announced an ambitious plan for Columbia , wherein they scheduled 99 films for release over an 18 @-@ month span , and studio head Abe Schneider ( also Briskin 's brother @-@ in @-@ law ) tagged Briskin to head the program . Among the films scheduled for production during this span included Anatomy of a Murder , A Raisin in the Sun , and Suddenly , Last Summer . Also in 1959 , Briskin made Glenn E. Miller Productions a Columbia affiliate , the new arm specializing film production for military and defense purposes . Something Briskin had experience in during World War II . In July , Briskin 's brother , Irving , sold his independent television production company to Screen Gems , Columbia 's wholly owned subsidiary . After the sale , he went back to work at Columbia , where he had been prior to forming his own company . Shortly after , Briskin , reunited with his brother , announced that he was re @-@ integrating Screen Gems back into Columbia , and it would no longer operate as a separate entity . Under Briskin , in July 1959 production hit an all @-@ time high at Columbia , with over $ 11 @.@ 5 million in production at one time . In August , despite rising production costs , Briskin took the unprecedented step of lowering the fees Columbia charged independent producers under contract to the studio . In September 1959 it was announced that Briskin had been elected to Columbia 's board of directors , a position he held until his death . At the same time as Briskin was being elected to Columbia 's board , it was announced that his son , Jerry , would be joining him at Columbia , working in the Screen Gems division as the producer for the television series , Manhunt . In December , Briskin 's contract with Columbia was up for renewal by their shareholders .

Briskin 's wife 's name was Sara , and they had one other child , a son named Bernard . Throughout his life Briskin was a well @-@ known philanthropist , and was quite active in Temple Israel in Los Angeles , as well as Cedars @-@ Sinai Hospital , where he served as president .

At the time Uninett was administrated as a division of SINTEF , but became a limited company owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research in 1993 . Norid was established as a division within Uninett in 1996 , with the responsibility of managing the .no domain . On 21 August 1997 , Norid was given the responsibility for the newly created .sj and .bv domains . In 1998 , Uninett FAS was established as a subsidiary to manage the technical network and service infrastructure Uninett had established , including operation of the network systems for the universities and colleges . At the same time , Norid was transferred to Uninett FAS . In 1998 , two organizations were established : the Domain Resolution Body , to determine domain disputes , and Norpol , a political advisory board . Domain name registrars were introduced in 1999 to handle aspects that could be provided by a third party . Uninett Norid was made a separate subsidiary of Uninett in 2003 , to secure the management of the domains within an independent organization .

 = Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia = 
 Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia ( Russian : Великая Княжна <unk> Николаевна <unk> , Velikaya Knyazhna Anastasiya Nikolayevna Romanova ) ( June 18 [ O.S. June 5 ] 1901 – July 17 , 1918 ) was the youngest daughter of Tsar Nicholas II , the last sovereign of Imperial Russia , and his wife , Tsarina Alexandra Fyodorovna . 
 Anastasia was a younger sister of Grand Duchess Olga , Grand Duchess Tatiana , and Grand Duchess Maria , and was an elder sister of Alexei Nikolaevich , Tsarevich of Russia . She was executed with her family in an extrajudicial killing by members of the Cheka , the Bolshevik secret police , on July 17 , 1918 . 
 Persistent rumors of her possible escape circulated after her death , fueled by the fact that the location of her burial was unknown during the decades of Communist rule . The mass grave near Yekaterinburg which held the remains of the Tsar , his wife , and three of their daughters was revealed in 1991 , and the bodies of Alexei Nikolaevich and the remaining daughter — either Anastasia or her older sister Maria — were discovered in 2007 . 
 Her possible survival has been conclusively disproven . Forensic analysis and DNA testing confirmed that the remains are those of the imperial family , showing that all four grand duchesses were killed in 1918 . Several women have falsely claimed to have been Anastasia ; the best known impostor is Anna Anderson . Anderson 's body was cremated upon her death in 1984 , but DNA testing in 1994 on available pieces of Anderson 's tissue and hair showed no relation to the DNA of the Romanov family . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Life and childhood = = = 
 When Anastasia was born , her parents and extended family were disappointed that she was a girl . They hoped for a son who would be heir apparent to the throne . Tsar Nicholas II went for a long walk to compose himself before going to visit Tsarina Alexandra and the newborn Anastasia for the first time . One meaning of her name is " the breaker of chains " or " the prison opener . " The fourth grand duchess received her name because , in honor of her birth , her father pardoned and reinstated students who had been imprisoned for participating in riots in St. Petersburg and Moscow the previous winter . Another meaning of the name is " of the resurrection , " a fact often alluded to later in stories about her rumored survival . Anastasia 's title is most precisely translated as " Grand Princess " . " Grand Duchess " became the most widely used translation of the title into English from Russian . 
 The Tsar 's children were raised as simply as possible . They slept on hard camp cots without pillows , except when they were ill , took cold baths in the morning , and were expected to tidy their rooms and do needlework to be sold at various charity events when they were not otherwise occupied . Most in the household , including the servants , generally called the Grand Duchess by her first name and patronym , Anastasia Nikolaevna , and did not use her title or style . She was occasionally called by the French version of her name , " Anastasie " , or by the Russian nicknames " <unk> " , " <unk> " , or " <unk> " . Other family nicknames for Anastasia were " <unk> , " meaning " little ( one ) " , or " <unk> , " the Russian word for " imp " . 
 Living up to her nicknames , young Anastasia grew into a vivacious and energetic child , described as short and inclined to be chubby , with blue eyes and strawberry @-@ blonde hair . Margaretta Eagar , a governess to the four grand duchesses , said one person commented that the toddler Anastasia had the greatest personal charm of any child she had ever seen . 
 While often described as gifted and bright , she was never interested in the restrictions of the school room , according to her tutors Pierre Gilliard and Sydney Gibbes . Gibbes , Gilliard , and ladies @-@ in @-@ waiting Lili Dehn and Anna Vyrubova described Anastasia as lively , mischievous , and a gifted actress . Her sharp , witty remarks sometimes hit sensitive spots . 
 Anastasia 's daring occasionally exceeded the limits of acceptable behavior . " She undoubtedly held the record for punishable deeds in her family , for in naughtiness she was a true genius " , said Gleb Botkin , son of the court physician Yevgeny Botkin , who later died with the family at Yekaterinburg . Anastasia sometimes tripped the servants and played pranks on her tutors . As a child , she would climb trees and refuse to come down . Once , during a snowball fight at the family 's Polish estate , Anastasia rolled a rock into a snowball and threw it at her older sister Tatiana , knocking her to the ground . A distant cousin , Princess Nina <unk> , recalled that " Anastasia was nasty to the point of being evil " , and would cheat , kick and scratch her playmates during games ; she was affronted because the younger Nina was taller than she was . She was also less concerned about her appearance than her sisters . Hallie <unk> Rives , a best @-@ selling American author and wife of an American diplomat , described how 10 @-@ year @-@ old Anastasia ate chocolates without bothering to remove her long , white opera gloves at the St. Petersburg opera house . 
 Anastasia and her older sister Maria were known within the family as " The Little Pair " . The two girls shared a room , often wore variations of the same dress , and spent much of their time together . Their older sisters Olga and Tatiana also shared a room and were known as " The Big Pair " . The four girls sometimes signed letters using the nickname , OTMA , which was derived from the first letters of their first names . 
 Despite her energy , Anastasia 's physical health was sometimes poor . The Grand Duchess suffered from painful <unk> , which affected both of her big toes . Anastasia had a weak muscle in her back and was prescribed twice @-@ weekly massage . She hid under the bed or in a cupboard to put off the massage . Anastasia 's older sister , Maria , reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils , according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia , who was interviewed later in her life . The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria 's mother , Tsarina Alexandra . Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene , like their mother . Symptomatic carriers of the gene , while not hemophiliacs themselves , can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding . DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved conclusively in 2009 that Alexei suffered from <unk> B , a rarer form of the disease . His mother and one sister , identified alternatively as Maria or Anastasia , were carriers . Therefore , had Anastasia lived to have children of her own , they may have been afflicted by the disease as well . Alexei 's hemophilia was chronic and incurable ; his frequent attacks caused permanent disability . 
 = = = Association with Grigori Rasputin = = = 
 Her mother relied on the counsel of Grigori Rasputin , a Russian peasant and wandering starets or " holy man , " and credited his prayers with saving the ailing Tsarevich on numerous occasions . Anastasia and her siblings were taught to view Rasputin as " Our Friend " and to share confidences with him . In the autumn of 1907 , Anastasia 's aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia was escorted to the nursery by the Tsar to meet Rasputin . Anastasia , her sisters and brother Alexei were all wearing their long white nightgowns . " All the children seemed to like him , " Olga Alexandrovna recalled . " They were completely at ease with him . " Rasputin 's friendship with the imperial children was evident in some of the messages he sent to them . In February 1909 , Rasputin sent the imperial children a telegram , advising them to " Love the whole of God 's nature , the whole of His creation in particular this earth . The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework . " 
 However , one of the girls ' governesses , Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva , was horrified in 1910 that Rasputin was permitted access to the nursery when the four girls were in their nightgowns and wanted him barred . Nicholas asked Rasputin to avoid going to the nurseries in the future . The children were aware of the tension and feared that their mother would be angered by Tyutcheva 's actions . " I am so afr ( aid ) that S.I. ( governess Sofia Ivanovna Tyutcheva ) can speak ... about our friend something bad , " Anastasia 's twelve @-@ year @-@ old sister Tatiana wrote to their mother on March 8 , 1910 . " I hope our nurse will be nice to our friend now . " 
 Tyutcheva was eventually fired . She took her story to other members of the family . While Rasputin 's visits to the children were , by all accounts , completely innocent in nature , the family was scandalized . Tyutcheva told Nicholas 's sister , Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia , that Rasputin visited the girls , talked with them while they were getting ready for bed , and hugged and patted them . Tyutcheva said the children had been taught not to discuss Rasputin with her and were careful to hide his visits from the nursery staff . Xenia wrote on March 15 , 1910 that she couldn 't understand " ... the attitude of Alix and the children to that sinister Grigory ( whom they consider to be almost a saint , when in fact he 's only a khlyst ! ) " 
 In the spring of 1910 , Maria Ivanovna Vishnyakova , a royal governess , claimed that Rasputin had raped her . Vishnyakova said the empress refused to believe her account of the assault , and insisted that " everything Rasputin does is holy . " Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna was told that Vishnyakova 's claim had been immediately investigated , but instead " they caught the young woman in bed with a Cossack of the Imperial Guard . " Vishnyakova was kept from seeing Rasputin after she made her accusation and was eventually dismissed from her post in 1913 . 
 However , rumors persisted and it was later whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only the Tsarina but also the four grand duchesses . The gossip was fueled by ardent , yet by all accounts innocent , letters written to Rasputin by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses which were released by Rasputin and which circulated throughout society . " My dear , precious , only friend , " wrote Anastasia . " How much I should like to see you again . You appeared to me today in a dream . I am always asking Mama when you will come ... I think of you always , my dear , because you are so good to me ... " 
 This was followed by circulation of pornographic cartoons , which depicted Rasputin having relations with the Empress , her four daughters and Anna Vyrubova . After the scandal , Nicholas ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg for a time , much to Alexandra 's displeasure , and Rasputin went on a pilgrimage to Palestine . Despite the rumors , the imperial family 's association with Rasputin continued until his murder on December 17 , 1916 . " Our Friend is so contented with our girlies , says they have gone through heavy ' courses ' for their age and their souls have much developed " , Alexandra wrote to Nicholas on December 6 , 1916 . 
 In his memoirs , A. A. Mordvinov reported that the four grand duchesses appeared " cold and visibly terribly upset " by Rasputin 's death , and sat " huddled up closely together " on a sofa in one of their bedrooms on the night they received the news . Mordvinov recalled that the young women were in a gloomy mood and seemed to sense the political upheaval that was about to be unleashed . Rasputin was buried with an icon signed on its reverse by Anastasia , her mother and her sisters . She attended his funeral on December 21 , 1916 , and her family planned to build a church over the site of Rasputin 's grave . After they were killed by the Bolsheviks , it was discovered Anastasia and her sisters were all wearing amulets bearing Rasputin 's picture and a prayer .

 During World War I , Anastasia , along with her sister Maria , visited wounded soldiers at a private hospital in the grounds at Tsarskoye Selo . The two teenagers , too young to become Red Cross nurses like their mother and elder sisters , played games of checkers and billiards with the soldiers and tried to lift their spirits . Felix Dassel , who was treated at the hospital and knew Anastasia , recalled that the grand duchess had a " laugh like a squirrel , " and walked rapidly " as though she tripped along . " 
 In February 1917 , Anastasia and her family were placed under house arrest at the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoye Selo during the Russian Revolution . Nicholas II abdicated on March 2 / 15 , 1917 . As the Bolsheviks approached , Alexander Kerensky of the Provisional Government had them moved to Tobolsk , Siberia . After the Bolsheviks seized majority control of Russia , Anastasia and her family were moved to the Ipatiev House , or House of Special Purpose , at Yekaterinburg . 
 The stress and uncertainty of captivity took their toll on Anastasia as well as her family . " Goodby , " she wrote to a friend in the winter of 1917 . " Don 't forget us . " At Tobolsk , she wrote a melancholy theme for her English tutor , filled with spelling mistakes , about " Evelyn Hope " , a poem by Robert Browning about a young girl : " When she died she was only sixteen years old , " Anastasia wrote . " Ther ( e ) was a man who loved her without having seen her but ( k ) new her very well . And she he ( a ) rd of him also . He never could tell her that he loved her , and now she was dead . But still he thought that when he and she will live [ their ] next life whenever it will be that ... " 
 At Tobolsk , she and her sisters sewed jewels into their clothing in hopes of hiding them from their captors , since Alexandra had written to warn them that she , Nicholas and Maria had been searched upon arriving in Yekaterinburg , and had items confiscated . Their mother used predetermined code words " medicines " and " Sednev 's belongings " for the jewels . Letters from Demidova to <unk> gave the instructions . Pierre Gilliard recalled his last sight of the children at Yekaterinburg : " The sailor Nagorny , who attended to Alexei <unk> , passed my window carrying the sick boy in his arms , behind him came the Grand Duchesses loaded with <unk> and small personal belongings . I tried to get out , but was roughly pushed back into the carriage by the sentry . I came back to the window . Tatiana Nikolayevna came last carrying her little dog and struggling to drag a heavy brown valise . It was raining and I saw her feet sink into the mud at every step . Nagorny tried to come to her assistance ; he was roughly pushed back by one of the <unk> ... " Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden told of her sad last glimpse of Anastasia : " Once , standing on some steps at the door of a house close by , I saw a hand and a pink @-@ sleeved arm opening the topmost pane . According to the blouse the hand must have belonged either to the Grand Duchess Marie or Anastasia . They could not see me through their windows , and this was to be the last glimpse that I was to have of any of them ! " 
 However , even in the last months of her life , she found ways to enjoy herself . She and other members of the household performed plays for the enjoyment of their parents and others in the spring of 1918 . Anastasia 's performance made everyone howl with laughter , according to her tutor Sydney Gibbes . In a May 7 , 1918 letter from Tobolsk to her sister Maria in Yekaterinburg , Anastasia described a moment of joy despite her sadness and loneliness and worry for the sick Alexei : " We played on the swing , that was when I roared with laughter , the fall was so wonderful ! Indeed ! I told the sisters about it so many times yesterday that they got quite fed up , but I could go on telling it masses of times ... What weather we 've had ! One could simply shout with joy . " In his memoirs , one of the guards at the Ipatiev House , Alexander Strekotin , remembered Anastasia as " very friendly and full of fun " , while another guard said Anastasia was " a very charming devil ! She was mischievous and , I think , rarely tired . She was lively , and was fond of performing comic mimes with the dogs , as though they were performing in a circus . " Yet another of the guards , however , called the youngest grand duchess " offensive and a terrorist " and complained that her occasionally provocative comments sometimes caused tension in the ranks . Anastasia and her sisters helped their maid darn stockings and assisted the cook in making bread and other kitchen chores while they were in captivity at the Ipatiev House . 
 In the summer , the privations of the captivity , including their closer confinement at the Ipatiev House negatively affected the family . According to some accounts , at one point Anastasia became so upset about the locked , painted windows that she opened one to look outside and get fresh air . A sentry reportedly saw her and fired , narrowly missing her . She did not try again . On July 14 , 1918 , local priests at Yekaterinburg conducted a private church service for the family . They reported that Anastasia and her family , contrary to custom , fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead , and that the girls had become despondent and hopeless , and no longer sang the replies in the service . Noticing this dramatic change in their demeanor since his last visit , one priest told the other , " Something has happened to them in there . " But the next day , on July 15 , 1918 , Anastasia and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked and helped move the beds in their shared bedroom so that cleaning women could clean the floors . They helped the women scrub the floors and whispered to them when the guards weren 't watching . Anastasia stuck her tongue out at Yakov Yurovsky , the head of the detachment , when he momentarily turned his back and left the room . 
 = = = Captivity and death = = = 
 After the Bolshevik revolution in October 1917 , Russia quickly disintegrated into civil war . Negotiations for the release of the Romanovs between their Bolshevik ( commonly referred to as ' Reds ' ) captors and their extended family , many of whom were prominent members of the royal houses of Europe , stalled . As the Whites ( Anti @-@ Bolshevik forces , though not necessarily supportive of the Tsar ) advanced toward Yekaterinburg the Reds were in a precarious situation . The Reds knew Yekaterinburg would fall to the better manned and equipped White Army . When the Whites reached Yekaterinburg , the imperial family had simply disappeared . The most widely accepted account was that the family had been murdered . This was due to an investigation by White Army investigator Nicholas Sokolov , who came to the conclusion based on items that had belonged to the family being found thrown down a mine shaft at <unk> Yama . 
 The " Yurovsky Note , " an account of the event filed by Yurovsky to his Bolshevik superiors following the killings , was found in 1989 and detailed in Edvard Radzinsky 's 1992 book The Last Tsar . According to the note , on the night of the deaths the family was awakened and told to dress . They were told they were being moved to a new location to ensure their safety in anticipation of the violence that might ensue when the White Army reached Yekaterinburg . Once dressed , the family and the small circle of servants who had remained with them were herded into a small room in the house 's sub @-@ basement and told to wait . Alexandra and Alexei sat in chairs provided by guards at the Empress 's request . After several minutes , the guards entered the room , led by Yurovsky . Yurovsky quickly informed the Tsar and his family that they were to be executed . The Tsar had time to say only " What ? " and turn to his family before he was killed by several bullets to the chest ( not , as is commonly stated , to the head ; his skull , recovered in 1991 , bears no bullet wounds ) . The Tsaritsa and her daughter Olga tried to make the sign of the cross , but were killed in the initial volley of bullets fired by the executioners . The rest of the Imperial retinue were shot in short order , with the exception of Anna Demidova , Alexandra 's maid . Demidova survived the initial onslaught , but was quickly murdered against the back wall of the basement , stabbed to death while trying to defend herself with a small pillow she had carried into the sub @-@ basement that was filled with precious gems and jewels . 
 The " Yurovsky Note " further reported that once the thick smoke that had filled the room from so many weapons being fired in such close proximity cleared , it was discovered that the executioners ' bullets had ricocheted off the corsets of two or three of the Grand Duchesses . The executioners later came to find out that this was because the family 's crown jewels and diamonds had been sewn inside the linings of the corsets to hide them from their captors . The corsets thus served as a form of " armor " against the bullets . Anastasia and Maria were said to have crouched up against a wall , covering their heads in terror , until they were shot down by bullets , recalled Yurovsky . However , another guard , Peter Ermakov , told his wife that Anastasia had been finished off with bayonets . As the bodies were carried out , one or more of the girls cried out , and were clubbed on the back of the head , wrote Yurovsky . 
 = = False reports of survival = = 
 Anastasia 's supposed escape and possible survival was one of the most popular historical mysteries of the 20th century , provoking many books and films . At least ten women claimed to be her , offering varying stories as to how she had survived . Anna Anderson , the best known Anastasia impostor , first surfaced publicly between 1920 and 1922 . She contended that she had feigned death among the bodies of her family and servants , and was able to make her escape with the help of a compassionate guard who noticed she was still breathing and took sympathy upon her . Her legal battle for recognition from 1938 to 1970 continued a lifelong controversy and was the longest running case ever heard by the German courts , where it was officially filed . The final decision of the court was that Anderson had not provided sufficient proof to claim the identity of the grand duchess . 
 Anderson died in 1984 and her body was cremated . DNA tests were conducted in 1994 on a tissue sample from Anderson located in a hospital and the blood of Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , a great @-@ nephew of Empress Alexandra . According to Dr Gill who conducted the tests , " If you accept that these samples came from Anna Anderson , then Anna Anderson could not be related to Tsar Nicholas or Tsarina Alexandra . " Anderson 's mitochondrial DNA was a match with a great @-@ nephew of Franziska Schanzkowska , a missing Polish factory worker . Some supporters of Anderson 's claim acknowledged that the DNA tests proving she could not have been the Grand Duchess had " won the day . " 
 Other lesser known claimants were Nadezhda Ivanovna <unk> and Eugenia Smith . Two young women claiming to be Anastasia and her sister Maria were taken in by a priest in the Ural Mountains in 1919 where they lived as nuns until their deaths in 1964 . They were buried under the names Anastasia and Maria Nikolaevna . 
 Rumors of Anastasia 's survival were embellished with various contemporary reports of trains and houses being searched for " Anastasia Romanov " by Bolshevik soldiers and secret police . When she was briefly imprisoned at Perm in 1918 , Princess Helena Petrovna , the wife of Anastasia 's distant cousin , Prince John Constantinovich of Russia , reported that a guard brought a girl who called herself Anastasia Romanova to her cell and asked if the girl was the daughter of the Tsar . Helena Petrovna said she did not recognize the girl and the guard took her away . Although other witnesses in Perm later reported that they saw Anastasia , her mother and sisters in Perm after the murders , this story is now widely discredited as nothing more than a rumor . Rumors that they were alive were fueled by deliberate misinformation designed to hide the fact that the family was dead . A few days after they had been murdered , the German government sent several telegrams to Russia demanding " the safety of the princesses of German blood " . Russia had recently signed a peace treaty with the Germans , and did not want to upset them by letting them know the women were dead , so they told them they had been moved to a safer location . 
 In another incident , eight witnesses reported the recapture of a young woman after an apparent escape attempt in September 1918 at a railway station at Siding 37 , northwest of Perm . These witnesses were Maxim <unk> , Tatiana <unk> and her son Fyodor <unk> , Ivan <unk> and <unk> <unk> , Vassily <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and Dr Pavel Utkin , a physician who treated the girl after the incident . Some of the witnesses identified the girl as Anastasia when they were shown photographs of the grand duchess by White Russian Army investigators . Utkin also told the White Russian Army investigators that the injured girl , whom he treated at Cheka headquarters in Perm , told him , " I am the daughter of the ruler , Anastasia . " Utkin obtained a prescription from a pharmacy for a patient named " N " at the orders of the secret police . White Army investigators later independently located records for the prescription . During the same time period in mid @-@ 1918 , there were several reports of young people in Russia passing themselves off as Romanov escapees . Boris Soloviev , the husband of Rasputin 's daughter Maria , defrauded prominent Russian families by asking for money for a Romanov impostor to escape to China . Soloviev also found young women willing to masquerade as one of the grand duchesses to assist in deceiving the families he had defrauded . 
 Some biographers ' accounts speculated that the opportunity for one or more of the guards to rescue a survivor existed . Yakov Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the murder . There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck , in the basement and in the corridor of the house . Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were reportedly left in the basement with the bodies . 
 = = Romanov graves = = 
 In 1991 , the presumed burial site of the imperial family and their servants was excavated in the woods outside Yekaterinburg . The grave had been found nearly a decade earlier , but was kept hidden by its discoverers from the Communists who were still ruling Russia at the time . The grave only held nine of the expected eleven sets of remains . DNA and skeletal analysis matched these remains to Tsar Nicholas II , Tsarina Alexandra , and three of the four grand duchesses ( Olga , Tatiana and presumably Maria ) . The other remains , with unrelated DNA , correspond to the family 's doctor ( Yevgeny Botkin ) , their valet ( Alexei Trupp ) , their cook ( Ivan <unk> ) , and Alexandra 's maid ( Anna Demidova ) . Forensic expert William R. Maples decided that the Tsarevitch Alexei and Anastasia 's bodies were missing from the family 's grave . Russian scientists contested this conclusion , however , claiming that it was the body of Maria that was missing . The Russians identified the body as that of Anastasia by using a computer program to compare photos of the youngest grand duchess with the skulls of the victims from the mass grave . They estimated the height and width of the skulls where pieces of bone were missing . American scientists found this method inexact . 
 American scientists thought the missing body to be Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity , such as an immature collarbone , undescended wisdom teeth , or immature vertebrae in the back , that they would have expected to find in a seventeen @-@ year @-@ old . In 1998 , when the remains of the imperial family were finally interred , a body measuring approximately 5 ' 7 " was buried under the name of Anastasia . Photographs taken of her standing beside her three sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Anastasia was several inches shorter than all of them . 
 The account of the " Yurovsky Note " indicated that two of the bodies were removed from the main grave and cremated at an undisclosed area in order to further disguise the burials of the Tsar and his retinue , if the remains were discovered by the Whites , since the body count would not be correct . Searches of the area in subsequent years failed to turn up a cremation site or the remains of the two missing Romanov children . However , on August 23 , 2007 , a Russian archaeologist announced the discovery of two burned , partial skeletons at a bonfire site near Yekaterinburg that appeared to match the site described in Yurovsky 's memoirs . The archaeologists said the bones were from a boy who was roughly between the ages of ten and thirteen years at the time of his death and of a young woman who was roughly between the ages of eighteen and twenty @-@ three years old . Anastasia was seventeen years and one month old at the time of the assassination , while her sister Maria was nineteen years , one month old and her brother Alexei was two weeks shy of his fourteenth birthday . Anastasia 's elder sisters Olga and Tatiana were twenty @-@ two and twenty @-@ one years old respectively at the time of the assassination . Along with the remains of the two bodies , archaeologists found " shards of a container of sulfuric acid , nails , metal strips from a wooden box , and bullets of various caliber . " The site was initially found with metal detectors and by using metal rods as probes . 
 DNA testing by multiple international laboratories such as the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory and Innsbruck Medical University confirmed that the remains belong to the Tsarevich Alexei and to one of his sisters , proving conclusively that all family members , including Anastasia , died in 1918 . The parents and all five children are now accounted for , and each has his or her own unique DNA profile . However , as reported in one of the studies : 
 It should be mentioned that a well publicized debate over which daughter , Maria ( according to Russian experts ) or Anastasia ( according to US experts ) , has been recovered from the second grave cannot be settled based upon the DNA results reported here . In the absence of a DNA reference from each sister , we can only conclusively identify Alexei – the only son of Nicholas and Alexandra . 
 = = Sainthood = = 
 In 2000 , Anastasia and her family were canonized as passion bearers by the Russian Orthodox Church . The family had previously been canonized in 1981 by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad as holy martyrs . The bodies of Tsar Nicholas II , Tsarina Alexandra , and three of their daughters were finally interred in the St. Catherine Chapel at St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg on July 17 , 1998 , eighty years after they were murdered . 
 = = Influence on culture = = 
 The purported survival of Anastasia has been the subject of both cinema and made @-@ for @-@ television films . The earliest , made in 1928 , was called Clothes Make the Woman . The story followed a woman who turns up to play the part of a rescued Anastasia for a Hollywood film , and ends up being recognized by the Russian soldier who originally rescued her from her would @-@ be assassins . 
 One notable film is the highly fictionalized Anastasia ( 1956 ) starring Ingrid Bergman as Anna Anderson , Yul Brynner as General <unk> ( a fictional character based on several actual men ) , and Helen Hayes as the Dowager Empress Marie , Anastasia 's paternal grandmother . The film tells the story of a refugee who appears in Paris in 1928 and is captured by several Russian émigrés who feed her information so that they can fool Anastasia 's grandmother into thinking she is her granddaughter in an attempt to obtain a Tsarist fortune . As time goes by they begin to suspect that " Madame A. Anderson " really is the missing grand duchess . The story served as the basis for the short @-@ lived 1965 musical Anya , and the 1997 animated musical film Anastasia , with Meg Ryan voicing Anastasia . 
 In 1986 , NBC broadcast a mini @-@ series loosely based on a book published in 1983 by Peter Kurth called Anastasia : The Riddle of Anna Anderson . The movie , Anastasia : The Mystery of Anna was a two @-@ part series which began with the young Anastasia <unk> and her family being sent to Yekaterinburg , where they are executed by Bolshevik soldiers . The story then moves to 1923 , and while taking great liberties , fictitiously follows the claims of the woman known as Anna Anderson . Amy Irving portrays the adult Anna Anderson .

 = Chain Reaction ( sculpture ) = 
 Chain Reaction is a peace monument and public art sculpture composed of a metal framework of stainless steel and fiberglass surrounded by concrete , depicting a mushroom cloud created by a nuclear explosion . Designed by American editorial cartoonist Paul Conrad and built by Peter M. Carlson , the 5 @.@ 5 @-@ ton , 8 @-@ meter ( 26 @-@ foot ) high sculpture was installed in 1991 adjacent to the Santa Monica Civic Center in Santa Monica , California . 
 An inscription at the base of the sculpture reads , " This is a statement of peace . May it never become an epitaph . " The theme of the sculpture reflects the subject of nuclear disarmament . UCLA professor Paul Von Blum places the sculpture in the category of late 20th and early 21st century contemporary American public political artwork in the tradition of commemorative works throughout the United States , calling the work " a powerful warning about the continuing dangers of nuclear war " . 
 Conrad first expressed interest in building the sculpture in either Beverly Hills or Santa Monica in 1988 . He built the sculpture with the help of an anonymous donation of $ 250 @,@ 000 and donated the sculpture to the city of Santa Monica after it was approved by the city . It was later revealed that the donation came from philanthropist Joan Kroc , widow of Ray Kroc , the founder of the McDonald 's corporation . Joan Kroc spent millions campaigning for nuclear disarmament in the 1980s . In 2012 , the sculpture became the first work of public art designated as a historic landmark in the City of Santa Monica . 
 = = Background = = 
 Conrad became the editorial cartoonist at the Denver Post in 1950 . While at the Denver Post he first began to draw cartoons about peace and nuclear weapons . His cartoon depicting the ending of the atmospheric nuclear testing moratorium in 1961 was categorized by Gamson and Stuart ( 1992 ) as falling under the universal “ Common Security ” media frame popularized by the peace movement in the United States . These types of cartoons emphasized progress towards disarmament and “ mutual cooperation , trade , cultural interaction , problem solving , and peacemaking ” towards other nations , such as the Soviet Union . 
 He joined the Los Angeles Times in 1964 where he spent the next four decades until he retired . After criticizing president Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal , Conrad was the only cartoonist to appear on Nixon 's Enemies List . In the 1980s , Conrad criticized the military buildup and arms race advocated by president Ronald Reagan , and the involvement of the Reagan administration in the Iran – Contra affair , the illegal covert operation which sold weapons to Iran to secure the release of hostages while funding the contras in Nicaragua with the proceeds from the arms sales . 
 Conrad later began working as a sculptor , often donating smaller works for fundraisers . After giving a lecture , Conrad was introduced to philanthropist Joan Kroc , widow of Ray Kroc , the founder of the McDonald 's corporation . Kroc was active in the anti @-@ nuclear movement in the United States and was known as a generous patron of the arts . After becoming friends with Conrad and his wife , she anonymously contributed $ 250 @,@ 000 to build the anti @-@ nuclear sculpture that would become Chain Reaction . 
 = = Proposal = = 
 Conrad expressed interest in building the sculpture in either Beverly Hills or Santa Monica . In 1988 , he created a two @-@ foot model of the sculpture and proposed his work to the Santa Monica Art Commission . Santa Monica debated the proposal for the next four years . While Santa Monica considered the proposal , Conrad proposed the sculpture to the Beverly Hills Fine Arts Committee in early 1989 . The committee , appointed by the Beverly Hills City Council , deliberated Conrad 's proposed sculpture for three months . During that time , Conrad was attacked as an antisemite by several residents of Beverly Hills because of his recent editorial cartoons depicting the Israeli – Palestinian conflict during the intifada . The Beverly Hills committee eventually turned down the proposal for the Chain Reaction sculpture on April 12 , 1989 , citing the lack of a suitable site in Beverly Hills that could accommodate the structure . " It is a piece of monumental proportions that needs a very large , large area , " committee chairwoman Ellen <unk> told the Los Angeles Times . 
 At the same time in Santa Monica , 730 Santa Monica residents in an informal survey by the Santa Monica Art Commission expressed their recommendation that the city should not accept the sculpture for display , while 392 agreed that it should be installed . Despite the negative public reaction , the Art Commission voted four separate times to accept the work , with the final vote taking place in 1990 . The City Council finally approved the work in 1991 . Funds were donated to the Santa Monica Arts Foundation to build it and the sculpture was given to the city as a gift . The city 's acceptance of the controversial peace sculpture reflected the progressive history of Santa Monica 's councilmembers , who had become a majority in 1981 just after the conservative Reagan administration took office . At the time of Conrad 's proposal , the councilmembers were known for being aligned with progressive issues , including the " anti @-@ war position " reflected in the theme of Conrad 's sculpture . 
 = = Location and installation = = 
 Several locations were initially considered for the sculpture . In 1989 , the Arts Commission approved a site located at 14th Street and Olympic Boulevard , while a site facing the Memorial Park Gymnasium was also considered and approved . Chain Reaction was finally installed in 1991 on the lawn of the Santa Monica Civic Center . It resides on the east side of Main Street between the Santa Monica Courthouse and the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium , across the street from the campus headquarters of the RAND Corporation . The sculpture is located approximately four city blocks away from Santa Monica beach and the Pacific Ocean , just east of the Santa Monica Pier . 
 Two plaques appear at the base of the sculpture , with one bearing the name of the artist ( Paul Conrad ) , the title of the work and date ( Chain Reaction , 1991 ) , a description of the material used to construct the sculpture ( Copper chain link and stainless steel ) and information about the work ( Collection of the City of Santa Monica . A donation from an anonymous donor . A project of the Santa Monica Arts Commission ) . The inscription on the second plaque reads , " This is a statement of peace . May it never become an epitaph . " 
 Chain Reaction was formally dedicated the next year at the " Peace Day " festival at the Santa Monica Civic Center on August 1 , 1992 . Hiroshima survivor Kaz <unk> spoke at the dedication . 
 = = Design = = 
 The sculpture is based on a cartoon sketch by Conrad . According to the Chain Reaction City Landmark Assessment Report by ICF International : 
 the sculpture has a disheveled quality akin to the sketch @-@ like markings and distorted proportions [ of ] Paul Conrad 's political cartoons ... this quality is conveyed by the ... treatment of the stem , the irregular placement of the links , and a subtle distortion of scale between the tall stem , its pronounced bulges , and a relatively small mushroom cloud . The ability of the large brass links to catch light and define pockets of random shadow in the small spaces between them is similar in effect to the stark treatment of light [ and ] dark that Conrad often employed in his political cartoons . 
 Custom fabricator Peter M. Carlson , who also created sculptures for artists Ellsworth Kelly , Jeff Koons , Roy Lichtenstein , Robert Rauschenberg , and Charles Ray , assembled the 26 @-@ foot high sculpture depicting an upwardly expanding nuclear mushroom cloud in the form of a " large metal chain " . The look and structure of the chain was created by linking 38 @,@ 000 hollow brass J @-@ shaped pipes used for plumbing fixtures . The pipes are welded together and attached by screws and wire to fiberglass covering a steel frame . 
 The theme of the sculpture reflects the subject of nuclear disarmament . 
 = = Maintenance and restoration = = 
 The sculpture was surveyed and considered " well maintained " by the Smithsonian 's " Save Outdoor Sculpture ! " program in March 1995 . After Conrad died in 2010 , the city of Santa Monica began to reevaluate the structural integrity of the sculpture . In June 2011 , an inspector observed children climbing the sculpture . Safety tests were performed showing that the underlying structure built using fiberglass and copper chains was stable . However , questions were raised about the long term integrity of the fiberglass . An inspection found rust and corrosion on the steel frame skeleton and the revealed that the anchor bolts holding the sculpture to the base were weakened . Shortly after the inspection , the city installed a safety fence around the sculpture to protect the public . 
 The city 's Arts Commission voted in February 2012 to allow the work to be removed from public display . The Santa Monica City Council approved the Arts Commission 's recommendation the next month . The city council delayed taking action to allow supporters time to raise funds to cover the cost of repairs . Los Angeles Times art critic Christopher Knight defended the sculpture , citing a 2012 report commissioned by the city from a structural engineer who concluded that " the sculpture is not an imminent hazard nor should it be considered dangerous " . 
 While fundraising to preserve the work was underway , the city of Santa Monica filed an application in May 2012 to nominate the sculpture for landmark status . After a public hearing in July , the Santa Monica Landmarks Commission selected the sculpture as a landmark . Chain Reaction is the first work of public art named a landmark by the city of Santa Monica . 
 The City Council set a deadline of February 1 , 2014 , for supporters of the sculpture to contribute to restoration funds , otherwise the sculpture could face decommissioning . Community activists debated how to pay for needed repairs and a series of fundraisers were held to contribute to the restoration project . On February 25 , the Santa Monica City Council voted 6 – 1 to use $ 100 @,@ 000 in public donations to finish refurbishing the work .

Two days later , he signed a two @-@ year professional contract with Hull . He made one further appearance in the 2002 – 03 season , as a substitute away to Boston United . 
 In August 2003 , Donaldson joined Football Conference side Scarborough on a one @-@ month loan . His debut came in a 2 – 1 home defeat to Burton Albion on 23 August 2003 , and made only one more appearance before his loan expired . On his return to Hull he made two further appearances , both as a substitute in the Football League Trophy , before joining Football Conference club Halifax Town on a one @-@ month loan in February 2004 . Having made his debut as a 58th @-@ minute substitute for Jake <unk> in a 2 – 0 away defeat at Margate on 8 February 2004 , Donaldson finished his spell at Halifax with four appearances . With little prospect of a first team place at Hull , he rejoined Harrogate on a one @-@ month loan in September 2004 , and scored in the 18th minute of his second debut for the club , a 3 – 0 home win over Lancaster City on 18 September . He was voted the Conference North Player of the Month for October 2004 , having scored three goals from five games in that period . His second loan spell with Harrogate ended having scored four goals from 11 appearances . At the end of the 2004 – 05 season , Donaldson was released by Hull , as manager Peter Taylor was unable to guarantee him first team football . 
 = = = York City = = = 
 After his release by Hull , Donaldson was spoken to by Barrow , but was eventually signed by York City in June 2005 , with manager Billy McEwan saying : " He 's a young player who is very hungry for his chance and he 'll bring competition up front " . He made his debut for the team against Crawley Town in August . His first goal came in a 1 – 0 win against Cambridge United in September . During his first season with York , Donaldson scored 18 goals and was awarded the Clubman of the Year award before the final game of the season against Hereford United on 29 April 2006 . He agreed a contract extension with York for the 2006 – 07 season in July . 
 York manager McEwan compared Donaldson to Paulo Wanchope in September , but following York 's 2 – 0 defeat against Oxford United later that month , McEwan criticised Donaldson 's selfishness in attack , saying it cost them the game . In late 2006 , Donaldson became subject of much transfer speculation . Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Mick McCarthy watched him in York 's 1 – 0 victory over Altrincham , during which he scored his 12th goal of the season , in November 2006 . He was also watched by Scottish Premier League side Hibernian . In response to this speculation , Donaldson said : " I don 't read too much into the speculation . I 've heard it before and nothing has happened so I will just keep my head down and enjoy my football until a point comes when the manager or board come and tell me they have had an offer they want to consider " . 
 On 18 December 2006 , he rejected the offer of a new contract at York City , meaning he would be out of contact at the club at the end of the season . Scunthorpe United and Peterborough United Director of Football Barry Fry both watched him in December 2006 . Fry tabled a £ 100 @,@ 000 bid for Donaldson , but this failed to meet York 's valuation and they halted their bid at this amount . He was reportedly given a £ 500 @,@ 000 transfer valuation by York in January 2007 . A cash @-@ plus player bid from Accrington Stanley for Donaldson was rejected in January , which according to York was £ 25 @,@ 000 and was termed as an " embarrassment " by York manager McEwan , and Accrington then upped their bid to a six @-@ figure fee , but were told that Donaldson was not for sale . 
 Donaldson was suspended for three games following his 51st @-@ minute sending off for using his elbow in York 's 2 – 1 defeat at Kidderminster Harriers on 20 January 2007 . York rejected a bid from Scunthorpe for Donaldson , with their approach falling short of York 's valuation , after which Scunthorpe manager Nigel Adkins said he would not pay " stupid money " for Donaldson . Hibernian announced that Donaldson had signed a pre @-@ contract agreement with them for a three @-@ year contract on 29 January 2007 , and as he was 23 years old a month later , York were not entitled to any compensation under FIFA regulations . York later turned down a £ 50 @,@ 000 offer from Hibernian , which would have allowed them to bring Donaldson to the club immediately . York boss McEwan wanted Donaldson to give his complete commitment for York for the rest of the season , who also revealed that the club intended to fight against the " international loophole " that meant Donaldson could join Hibernian for free . Donaldson 's agent , Andy Sprott , said suggestions he deliberately found Donaldson a deal in Scotland so York would not receive any compensation were " not the case " . 
 Donaldson was to return from his suspension for York 's reserves against Sheffield United at Bootham Crescent on 6 February 2007 , but the game was frozen off , and he eventually returned against Altrincham . His first goal for York since his suspension came against Cambridge United , scoring a hat @-@ trick on 13 March 2007 . He insisted he remained fully committed to York , after speculation concerning his commitment grew in April . He finished the 2006 – 07 season with 26 goals for York , including 24 in the Conference National , resulting in him being third top scorer of the league . 
 = = = Hibernian = = = 
 Donaldson scored his first goal for Hibernian in a pre @-@ season friendly against Brechin City on 10 July 2007 . He made his Scottish Premier League debut against Hibs ' rivals Hearts in August 2007 and his first league goal came against Falkirk in September , after winning and scoring a penalty . Donaldson was later sent off in this match , which resulted in a suspension . His first game back was against Motherwell in the Scottish League Cup , who he scored against , after a solo run and shot . He scored his first hat @-@ trick for Hibs against Kilmarnock in the SPL later that month . 
 He was linked with a move to League One side Crewe Alexandra in February 2008 , after being unable to figure in Mixu Paatelainen 's plans at the club , meaning he was frozen out of the first @-@ team at Hibs . He finished the 2007 – 08 season with 21 appearances and 6 goals , with his last goal of the season coming against Falkirk in December 2007 . Darlington of League Two were believed to be interested in signing Donaldson after the end of the season . He was eventually told that he was available for transfer by Hibs . Crewe were believed to be lining up a bid for him in July , who had money available after selling striker Nicky Maynard to Bristol City for £ 2 @.@ 25 million and held negotiations with Donaldson . The move stalled after a six @-@ figure fee had been agreed but Donaldson later agreed personal terms . 
 = = = Crewe Alexandra = = = 
 Donaldson 's move to League One side Crewe Alexandra was completed on 18 August 2008 on a three @-@ year deal for an undisclosed six @-@ figure fee . The contract could not be signed until international clearance was given from the Scottish Football Association , which was received on 22 August 2008 . He made his debut as an 81st @-@ minute substitute in a 2 – 1 victory against Walsall on 23 August 2008 . Donaldson 's former club York made an attempt to re @-@ sign him on loan in October 2008 , but were told to make an inquiry four weeks later , due to him being injured . Despite this , he came on as a substitute in Crewe 's 3 – 0 defeat to Scunthorpe on 11 October 2008 , which was followed by his first start in a 2 – 2 draw with Milton Keynes Dons . He scored his first Crewe goals with a brace against Huddersfield Town in November , in a match that eventually finished as a 3 – 2 defeat . He scored the winner in Crewe 's next game , an FA Cup first round tie against Ebbsfleet United , which saw them progress with a 1 – 0 victory . He displayed the ability of long throw @-@ ins , which he initially developed while in the Hull youth team , on several occasions , including a 3 – 2 victory over Scunthorpe , where he also scored . He scored three goals in four matches later in the season , with the final goal , against Carlisle United , proving to be his last of the 2008 – 09 season . Donaldson finished the season with 43 appearances and 7 goals . 
 He broke his fibula during August 2009 , which resulted in him being ruled out of playing for eight weeks . He finished the 2009 – 10 season with 39 appearances and 13 goals . His first appearance of the 2010 – 11 season came in the opening game , a 1 – 0 defeat to Hereford on 7 August 2010 , with his first goals coming after scoring twice in a 7 – 0 victory over Barnet on 21 August . He finished the season with 48 appearances and 29 goals , including 28 goals in the league , making him League Two 's top goalscorer . 
 = = = Brentford = = = 
 Donaldson signed a three @-@ year contract with League One club Brentford on a free transfer on 1 July 2011 . He was named Brentford 's Player of the Year for the 2012 – 13 season , in which he scored 24 goals from 56 appearances . After helping Brentford gain promotion into the Championship in the 2013 – 14 season as League One runners @-@ up , manager Mark Warburton confirmed that Donaldson would be offered a new deal with the club . 
 = = = Birmingham City = = = 
 Donaldson turned down Brentford 's contract offer , and signed a two @-@ year deal with their 2014 – 15 Championship rivals Birmingham City , to begin on 1 July 2014 when his Brentford contract expired . He made his debut as a second @-@ half substitute in the opening @-@ day defeat at Middlesbrough , opened the scoring as Birmingham beat Cambridge United 3 – 1 in the League Cup , and collected Wes Thomas 's through ball to run on and score in a draw with Ipswich Town on 19 August . Although attracting praise for his general play , Donaldson was disappointed with his lack of goals ; by the end of October , he had added only one more . 
 A change of management and change of formation – Gary Rowett preferred to play Donaldson as a lone striker – brought a change of fortune in front of goal . He scored both goals in a 2 – 1 home win against Watford , who had been on a nine @-@ match unbeaten run , and followed up with the only goal of the visit to Rotherham United , when his shot was parried back out to him and he was alert enough to produce a more accurate and powerful second attempt . Donaldson 's " customary selfless performance " was rewarded with a brace in a 3 – 1 win at Nottingham Forest , and a hat @-@ trick against Wigan Athletic prompted thoughts of a 20 @-@ goal season . An eight @-@ week lean spell put paid to that target – he finished with 16 in all competitions , 15 in the league , – but his efforts for the team were recognised with both Players ' Player and Supporters ' Player of the Season awards . 
 In the first month of the 2015 – 16 season , Donaldson provided four assists for teammates but did not score himself . At home to Bristol City on 12 September , he completed a first @-@ half hat @-@ trick ; the match ended 4 – 2 . His fifth goal of the season came in a 5 – 2 win at Fulham on 7 November , the last match before he made his international debut for Jamaica . He returned with a groin injury that was predicted to keep him out for six weeks . Rowett suggested the damage could have been less serious had Donaldson not played the whole match despite being obviously unfit , but Jamaica coach Winfried Schäfer denied the accusations , stating that he had wanted to substitute Donaldson but the player insisted on continuing . He returned to first @-@ team action on 26 December , as a late substitute with Birmingham already 3 – 0 down at Sheffield Wednesday . 
 = = International career = = 
 Donaldson was named in the England National Game XI team , who represent England at non @-@ League level , in October 2005 , for a European Challenge Trophy game against Belgium . He was named in the initial 35 @-@ man squad for the Four Nations Tournament in May 2006 . He was named in the initial 22 @-@ man squad , then eventually in the final 16 @-@ man squad for the team to play the Netherlands in November . He made his debut in this match , coming on as a substitute in the last 15 minutes , during which he set up Dagenham & Redbridge striker Craig Mackail @-@ Smith for the final goal in a 4 – 1 victory . 
 He was included in the squad which played Northern Ireland in February 2007 . However , York manager Billy McEwan contemplated withdrawing Donaldson from the game , after Donaldson 's comeback for York against Altrincham in February . He eventually featured after being played from the start against Northern Ireland , but was substituted after 50 minutes for Paul Benson , who scored England 's only goal two minutes after coming on in a 3 – 1 defeat . 
 In April 2015 , Donaldson stated that he wanted to play for Jamaica , his parents ' country . He had hoped to be selected for the 2015 Copa América or for the Gold Cup , but did not receive his Jamaican passport in time . He was called up for World Cup qualifiers in November against Panama and Haiti , and made his full international debut in the first of those matches , at Independence Park in Kingston on 13 November . He entered the match with Jamaica already 2 – 0 down , replacing Darren <unk> after 62 minutes , but was unable to affect the score . Donaldson started against Haiti , and scored the only goal of the match after 62 minutes with a header from a corner .

 In 2010 , Furler released her fifth studio album , We Are Born , which peaked at number two on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association . Following the release of We Are Born , Furler decided to retire from the career as a recording artist and established a career as a songwriter . She wrote the song " Titanium " for American singer Alicia Keys , but it was later sent to David Guetta , who included Sia 's original demo vocals on the song and released it as a single in 2011 . " Titanium " was a commercial success worldwide , peaking within the top five of record charts in the United States , Australia and numerous European regions . However , Furler was not pleased with the success of the single : " [ ... ] I never even knew it was gonna happen , and I was really upset . Because I had just retired , I was trying to be a pop songwriter , not an artist . " From 2011 to 2013 , Furler became well known for writing songs for Beyoncé , Flo Rida , Christina Aguilera , and Rihanna . 
 By September 2013 , Furler was recording vocal tracks at her home studio with the hope of releasing a new album the following spring . Later that year , a team of RCA Records representatives including the label 's CEO Peter Edge met with Furler to discuss a record deal . The singer agreed to a contract for a new album in which she was not obliged to tour or do press appearances to promote the album . In an interview published by NME in February 2015 , Furler revealed that 1000 Forms of Fear was released as a contractual obligation : " Basically , I put this out to get out of my publishing deal . I was planning to be a pop song writer for other artists . But my publishing deal was as an artist so I had to put one more album out . I didn 't want to get famous so I kept all the songs I wanted and had a lot of fun making it . "

 Writing for Slant Magazine , Annie Galvin opined that 1000 Forms of Fear " should be the vessel that rockets the singer out of relative obscurity and into the stratosphere populated by those more recognizable stars who 've come to dominate the pop @-@ music universe thanks , in part , to her songwriting skills . " Mikael Wood writing for the Los Angeles Times praised Sia 's vocals and the production held by Greg Kurstin .

 On a less enthusiastic review , The Guardian Harriet Gibsone shared that the album was so impeccable and " contemporary @-@ sounding " that " its impact may fade with time . " The A.V. Club writer Annie Zaleski wrote : " 1000 Forms of Fear certainly has the songs and contemporary sheen to make Sia a star in her own right , but it 's at the expense of both her emotional intimacy and her offbeat personality .

 = Cricket World Cup = 
 The ICC Cricket World Cup is the international championship of One Day International ( ODI ) cricket . The event is organised by the sport 's governing body , the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) , every four years , with preliminary qualification rounds leading up to a finals tournament . The tournament is one of the world 's most viewed sporting events and is considered the " flagship event of the international cricket calendar " by the ICC . 
 The first World Cup was organised in England in June 1975 , with the first ODI cricket match having been played only four years earlier . However , a separate Women 's Cricket World Cup had been held two years before the first men 's tournament , and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912 , when a triangular tournament of Test matches was played between Australia , England and South Africa . The first three World Cups were held in England . From the 1987 tournament onwards , hosting has been shared between countries under an unofficial rotation system , with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament . 
 The finals of the World Cup are contested by the ten full members of the ICC ( all of which are Test @-@ playing teams ) and a number of teams made up from associate and affiliate members of the ICC , selected via the World Cricket League and a later qualifying tournament . A total of twenty teams have competed in the eleven editions of the tournament , with fourteen competing in the 2015 tournament . Australia has won the tournament five times , with the West Indies , India ( twice each ) , Pakistan and Sri Lanka ( once each ) also having won the tournament . The best performance by a non @-@ full @-@ member team came when Kenya made the semi @-@ finals of the 2003 tournament . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Before the first Cricket World Cup = = = 
 The first international cricket match was played between Canada and the United States , on 24 and 25 September 1844 . However , the first credited Test match was played in 1877 between Australia and England , and the two teams competed regularly for The Ashes in subsequent years . South Africa was admitted to Test status in 1889 . Representative cricket teams were selected to tour each other , resulting in bilateral competition . Cricket was also included as an Olympic sport at the 1900 Paris Games , where Great Britain defeated France to win the gold medal . This was the only appearance of cricket at the Summer Olympics . 
 The first multilateral competition at international level was the 1912 Triangular Tournament , a Test cricket tournament played in England between all three Test @-@ playing nations at the time : England , Australia and South Africa . The event was not a success : the summer was exceptionally wet , making play difficult on damp uncovered pitches , and attendances were poor , attributed to a " surfeit of cricket " . Since then , international Test cricket has generally been organised as bilateral series : a multilateral Test tournament was not organised again until the triangular Asian Test Championship in 1999 . 
 The number of nations playing Test cricket increased gradually over time , with the addition of West Indies in 1928 , New Zealand in 1930 , India in 1932 , and Pakistan in 1952 . However , international cricket continued to be played as bilateral Test matches over three , four or five days . 
 In the early 1960s , English county cricket teams began playing a shortened version of cricket which only lasted for one day . Starting in 1962 with a four @-@ team knockout competition known as the Midlands Knock @-@ Out Cup , and continuing with the inaugural Gillette Cup in 1963 , one @-@ day cricket grew in popularity in England . A national Sunday League was formed in 1969 . The first One @-@ Day International match was played on the fifth day of a rain @-@ aborted Test match between England and Australia at Melbourne in 1971 , to fill the time available and as compensation for the frustrated crowd . It was a forty over game with eight balls per over . 
 In the late 1970s , Kerry Packer established the rival World Series Cricket ( WSC ) competition . It introduced many of the now commonplace features of One Day International cricket , including coloured uniforms , matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens , and , for television broadcasts , multiple camera angles , effects microphones to capture sounds from the players on the pitch , and on @-@ screen graphics . The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink , played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979 . The success and popularity of the domestic one @-@ day competitions in England and other parts of the world , as well as the early One @-@ Day Internationals , prompted the ICC to consider organising a Cricket World Cup . 
 = = = Prudential World Cups ( 1975 – 1983 ) = = = 
 The inaugural Cricket World Cup was hosted in 1975 by England , the only nation able to put forward the resources to stage an event of such magnitude at the time . The 1975 tournament started on 7 June . The first three events were held in England and officially known as the Prudential Cup after the sponsors Prudential plc . The matches consisted of 60 six @-@ ball overs per team , played during the daytime in traditional form , with the players wearing cricket whites and using red cricket balls . 
 Eight teams participated in the first tournament : Australia , England , India , New Zealand , Pakistan , and the West Indies ( the six Test nations at the time ) , together with Sri Lanka and a composite team from East Africa . One notable omission was South Africa , who were banned from international cricket due to apartheid . The tournament was won by the West Indies , who defeated Australia by 17 runs in the final at Lord 's . 
 The 1979 World Cup saw the introduction of the ICC Trophy competition to select non @-@ Test playing teams for the World Cup , with Sri Lanka and Canada qualifying . The West Indies won a second consecutive World Cup tournament , defeating the hosts England by 92 runs in the final . At a meeting which followed the World Cup , the International Cricket Conference agreed to make the competition a quadrennial event . 
 The 1983 event was hosted by England for a third consecutive time . By this stage , Sri Lanka had become a Test @-@ playing nation , and Zimbabwe qualified through the ICC Trophy . A fielding circle was introduced , 30 yards ( 27 m ) away from the stumps . Four fieldsmen needed to be inside it at all times . The teams faced each other twice , before moving into the knock @-@ outs . India , an outsider , quoted at 66 – 1 to win by bookmakers before the competition began , were crowned champions after upsetting the West Indies by 43 runs in the final .

 India and Pakistan jointly hosted the 1987 tournament , the first time that the competition was held outside England . The games were reduced from 60 to 50 overs per innings , the current standard , because of the shorter daylight hours in the Indian subcontinent compared with England 's summer . Australia won the championship by defeating England by 7 runs in the final , the closest margin in World Cup final history . 
 The 1992 World Cup , held in Australia and New Zealand , introduced many changes to the game , such as coloured clothing , white balls , day / night matches , and a change to the fielding restriction rules . The South African cricket team participated in the event for the first time , following the fall of the apartheid regime and the end of the international sports boycott . Pakistan overcame a dismal start in the tournament to eventually defeat England by 22 runs in the final and emerge as winners . 
 The 1996 championship was held in the Indian subcontinent for a second time , with the inclusion of Sri Lanka as host for some of its group stage matches . In the semi @-@ final , Sri Lanka , heading towards a crushing victory over India at Eden Gardens after the hosts lost eight wickets while scoring 120 runs in pursuit of 252 , were awarded victory by default after crowd unrest broke out in protest against the Indian performance . Sri Lanka went on to win their maiden championship by defeating Australia by seven wickets in the final at Lahore .

 In 1999 the event was hosted by England , with some matches also being held in Scotland , Ireland , Wales and the Netherlands . Twelve teams contested the World Cup . Australia qualified for the semi @-@ finals after reaching their target in their Super 6 match against South Africa off the final over of the match . They then proceeded to the final with a tied match in the semi @-@ final also against South Africa where a mix @-@ up between South African batsmen Lance <unk> and Allan Donald saw Donald drop his bat and stranded mid @-@ pitch to be run out . In the final , Australia dismissed Pakistan for 132 and then reached the target in less than 20 overs and with eight wickets in hand . 
 South Africa , Zimbabwe and Kenya hosted the 2003 World Cup . The number of teams participating in the event increased from twelve to fourteen . Kenya 's victories over Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe , among others – and a forfeit by the New Zealand team , which refused to play in Kenya because of security concerns – enabled Kenya to reach the semi @-@ finals , the best result by an associate . In the final , Australia made 359 runs for the loss of two wickets , the largest ever total in a final , defeating India by 125 runs . 
 In 2007 the tournament was hosted by the West Indies and expanded to sixteen teams . Following Pakistan 's upset loss to World Cup debutants Ireland in the group stage , Pakistani coach Bob Woolmer was found dead in his hotel room . Jamaican police had initially launched a murder investigation into Woolmer 's death but later confirmed that he died of heart failure . Australia defeated Sri Lanka in the final by 53 runs ( D / L ) in farcical light conditions , and extended their undefeated run in the World Cup to 29 matches and winning three straight championships .

 India , Sri Lanka and Bangladesh together hosted the 2011 Cricket World Cup . Pakistan were stripped of their hosting rights following the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team , with the games originally scheduled for Pakistan redistributed to the other host countries . The number of teams participating in the World Cup dropped down to fourteen . Australia lost their final group stage match against Pakistan on 19 March 2011 , ending an unbeaten streak of 35 World Cup matches , which had begun on 23 May 1999 . India won their second World Cup title by beating Sri Lanka by 6 wickets in the final in Mumbai , and became the first country to win the final on home soil . 
 Australia and New Zealand jointly hosted the 2015 Cricket World Cup . The number of participants remained at fourteen . Ireland was the most successful Associate nation with a total of three wins in the tournament . New Zealand beat South Africa in a thrilling first semi @-@ final to qualify for their maiden World Cup final . Australia defeated New Zealand by seven wickets in the final at Melbourne to lift the World Cup for the fifth time .

 The Test @-@ playing nations qualify automatically for the World Cup main event while the other teams have to qualify through a series of preliminary qualifying tournaments . A new qualifying format was introduced for the 2015 Cricket World Cup . The top two teams of the 2011 – 13 ICC World Cricket League Championship qualify directly . The remaining six teams join the third and fourth @-@ placed teams of 2011 ICC World Cricket League Division Two and the top two teams of the 2013 ICC World Cricket League Division Three in the World Cup Qualifier to decide the remaining two places . 
 Qualifying tournaments were introduced for the second World Cup , where two of the eight places in the finals were awarded to the leading teams in the ICC Trophy . The number of teams selected through the ICC Trophy had varied throughout the years . The World Cricket League ( administered by the International Cricket Council ) is the qualification system provided to allow the Associate and Affiliate members of the ICC more opportunities to qualify . The name " ICC Trophy " has been changed to " ICC World Cup Qualifier " . 
 Under the current qualifying process , the World Cricket League , all Associate and Affiliate members of the ICC are able to qualify for the World Cup . Associate and Affiliate members must play between two and five stages in the ICC World Cricket League to qualify for the World Cup finals , depending on the Division in which they start the qualifying process .

 The format of the Cricket World Cup has changed greatly over the course of its history . Each of the first four tournaments was played by eight teams , divided into two groups of four . The competition consisted of two stages , a group stage and a knock @-@ out stage . The four teams in each group played each other in the round @-@ robin group stage , with the top two teams in each group progressing to the semi @-@ finals . The winners of the semi @-@ finals played against each other in the final . With South Africa returning in the fifth tournament in 1992 as a result of the end of the apartheid boycott , nine teams played each other once in the group phase , and the top four teams progressed to the semi @-@ finals . The tournament was further expanded in 1996 , with two groups of six teams . The top four teams from each group progressed to quarter @-@ finals and semi @-@ finals . 
 A distinct format was used for the 1999 and 2003 World Cups . The teams were split into two pools , with the top three teams in each pool advancing to the Super 6 . The Super 6 teams played the three other teams that advanced from the other group . As they advanced , the teams carried their points forward from previous matches against other teams advancing alongside them , giving them an incentive to perform well in the group stages . The top four teams from the Super 6 stage progressed to the semi @-@ finals , with the winners playing in the final . 
 The format used in the 2007 World Cup involved 16 teams allocated into four groups of four . Within each group , the teams played each other in a round @-@ robin format . Teams earned points for wins and half @-@ points for ties . The top two teams from each group moved forward to the Super 8 round . The Super 8 teams played the other six teams that progressed from the different groups . Teams earned points in the same way as the group stage , but carried their points forward from previous matches against the other teams who qualified from the same group to the Super 8 stage . The top four teams from the Super 8 round advanced to the semi @-@ finals , and the winners of the semi @-@ finals played in the final . 
 The format used in the 2011 and 2015 World Cups featured two groups of seven teams , each playing in a round @-@ robin format . The top four teams from each group proceeded to the knock out stage consisting of quarter @-@ finals , semi @-@ finals and ultimately the final .

 The ICC Cricket World Cup Trophy is presented to the winners of the World Cup . The current trophy was created for the 1999 championships , and was the first permanent prize in the tournament 's history . Prior to this , different trophies were made for each World Cup . The trophy was designed and produced in London by a team of craftsmen from Garrard & Co over a period of two months . 
 The current trophy is made from silver and gild , and features a golden globe held up by three silver columns . The columns , shaped as stumps and bails , represent the three fundamental aspects of cricket : batting , bowling and fielding , while the globe characterises a cricket ball . The seam is tilted to symbolize the axial tilt of the Earth . It stands 60 centimetres high and weighs approximately 11 kilograms . The names of the previous winners are engraved on the base of the trophy , with space for a total of twenty inscriptions . The ICC keeps the original trophy . A replica differing only in the inscriptions is permanently awarded to the winning team .

 = = Selection of hosts = = 
 The International Cricket Council 's executive committee votes for the hosts of the tournament after examining the bids made by the nations keen to hold a Cricket World Cup . 
 England hosted the first three competitions . The ICC decided that England should host the first tournament because it was ready to devote the resources required to organising the inaugural event . India volunteered to host the third Cricket World Cup , but most ICC members preferred England as the longer period of daylight in England in June meant that a match could be completed in one day . The 1987 Cricket World Cup was held in India and Pakistan , the first hosted outside England . 
 Many of the tournaments have been jointly hosted by nations from the same geographical region , such as South Asia in 1987 , 1996 and 2011 , Australasia in 1992 and 2015 , Southern Africa in 2003 and West Indies in 2007 .

 Twenty nations have qualified for the Cricket World Cup at least once ( excluding qualification tournaments ) . Seven teams have competed in every finals tournament , five of which have won the title . The West Indies won the first two tournaments , Australia has won five , India has won two , while Pakistan and Sri Lanka have each won once . The West Indies ( 1975 and 1979 ) and Australia ( 1999 , 2003 and 2007 ) are the only nations to have won consecutive titles . Australia has played in seven of the eleven final matches ( 1975 , 1987 , 1996 , 1999 , 2003 , 2007 , 2015 ) . England has yet to win the World Cup , but has been runners @-@ up three times ( 1979 , 1987 , 1992 ) . The best result by a non @-@ Test playing nation is the semi @-@ final appearance by Kenya in the 2003 tournament ; while the best result by a non @-@ Test playing team on their debut is the Super 8 ( second round ) by Ireland in 2007 . 
 Sri Lanka as a co @-@ host of the 1996 Cricket World Cup was the first host to win the tournament though the final was held in Pakistan . India won in 2011 as host and was the first team to win in a final played in their own country . Australia repeated the feat in 2015 . England is the only other host to have made the final , in 1979 . Other countries which have achieved or equalled their best World Cup results while co @-@ hosting the tournament are New Zealand as finalists in 2015 ; Zimbabwe who reached the Super Six in 2003 ; and Kenya as semi @-@ finalists in 2003 . In 1987 , co @-@ hosts India and Pakistan both reached the semi @-@ finals , but were eliminated by Australia and England respectively . Australia in 1992 , England in 1999 , South Africa in 2003 , and Bangladesh in 2011 have been the host teams that were eliminated in the first round .

 = Action of 31 March 1800 = 
 The Action of 31 March 1800 was a naval engagement of the French Revolutionary Wars fought between a Royal Navy squadron and a French Navy ship of the line off Malta in the Mediterranean Sea . By March 1800 Valletta , the Maltese capital , had been under siege for eighteen months and food supplies were severely depleted , a problem exacerbated by the interception and defeat of a French replenishment convoy in mid @-@ February . In an effort to simultaneously obtain help from France and reduce the number of personnel maintained in the city , the naval commander on the island , Contre @-@ Admiral Pierre @-@ Charles Villeneuve , ordered his subordinate Contre @-@ Admiral Denis Decrès to put to sea with the large ship of the line Guillaume Tell , which had arrived in the port shortly before the siege began in September 1798 . Over 900 men were carried aboard the ship , which was to sail for Toulon under cover of darkness on 30 March . 
 The British had maintained a blockade off Malta since the beginning of the siege , ostensibly led by Rear @-@ Admiral Lord Nelson , who by March 1800 was defying a direct order from his superior officer Lord Keith by remaining in Palermo with his lover Emma , Lady Hamilton . In his absence the blockade was under the command of Captain Manley Dixon of HMS Lion and Nelson 's flag captain Sir Edward Berry , who were notified of Decrés ' departure by the patrolling frigate HMS Penelope and gave chase . The large ship of the line was initially only attacked by Penelope , which manoeuvered around Guillaume Tell 's stern , causing severe damage and delaying the French ship sufficiently for Berry to bring his squadron into action . Despite being heavily outnumbered , Decrés continued to fight for more than three hours , fighting off two British ships but ultimately unable to resist the combined weight of Berry 's attacks . Casualties and damage were severe on both sides , and the defiance of the French ship was celebrated in both countries as a brave defence against overwhelming odds . 
 = = Background = = 
 In May 1798 , a French fleet under General Napoleon Bonaparte crossed the Mediterranean Sea , sailing for Egypt . Pausing at Malta on 9 June , Bonaparte landed soldiers and seized the island leaving a sizeable French garrison at Valletta under General Claude @-@ Henri Belgrand de Vaubois while the rest of the fleet continued on to Alexandria . After the successful landing in Egypt , Bonaparte marched inland at the head of his army . The fleet anchored in Aboukir Bay to support the troops ashore and was surprised and almost completely destroyed on 1 August by a British fleet under Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson . Only two ships of the line and two frigates escaped the Battle of the Nile from the 17 French ships that participated in the action . Of the survivors , the ship of the line Généreux sailed for Corfu while Guillaume Tell , under Contre @-@ Admiral Pierre @-@ Charles Villeneuve , reached Malta with the two frigates . 
 When Villeneuve arrived at Malta in September 1798 , the island was already in turmoil : the dissolution of the Roman Catholic Church on the island under French rule had been highly unpopular with the Maltese population , who forced the French garrison to retreat into the fortress of Valletta on 2 September . By the start of October , British and Portuguese troops had supplemented the Maltese irregulars , while a naval squadron watched Valletta harbour , to prevent any French effort to resupply and reinforce the garrison . Although small quantities of material reached Valletta from France in early 1799 , by the start of 1800 no ship had arrived for more than seven months , and the garrison was near starvation . In an effort to resupply the garrison , the French sent a convoy from Toulon in February 1800 , but the ships were intercepted off Malta by a squadron under Nelson on 17 February and in the ensuing battle the flagship Généreux was captured and Contre @-@ Admiral Jean @-@ Baptiste Perrée was killed . 
 Without Perrée 's supplies , the garrison faced continued food shortages , and by March Vaubois and Villeneuve decided to send an urgent request for support to France . For this operation they chose the 80 @-@ gun Guillaume Tell under Captain Saulnier , partly because the condition and size of the ship enabled Vaubois to embark over 900 men aboard , many of whom were sick or wounded . Contre @-@ Admiral Denis Decrès had command of the ship and Vaubois and Villeneuve confirmed the date of departure for 30 March . While the French prepared this expedition , the British maintained their blockade , although without their commander . Nelson , in defiance of specific orders from his commanding officer Lord Keith , had retired to Palermo on Sicily to be with Emma , Lady Hamilton , the wife of the British ambassador Sir William Hamilton with whom Nelson was conducting an adulterous affair . In his absence , command had passed to Captain Sir Thomas Troubridge on HMS Culloden and then to Captain Manley Dixon on HMS Lion . 
 = = Battle = = 
 At 23 : 00 on 30 March , with a strong wind from the south , Guillaume Tell sailed from Valletta , Decrés hoping to use the cover of darkness to escape the British blockade . Dixon had deployed his ships around the island , with Valletta watched by the frigate HMS Penelope under Captain Henry Blackwood . At 23 : 55 , Blackwood 's lookouts spotted Guillaume Tell and the captain gave chase , ordering the brig HMS Minorca under Commander George Miller to convey the message to Dixon , whose ships were just visible in the distance . Blackwood also attempted to signal his discovery to his commanding officer as Penelope gave chase . 
 Blackwood rapidly gained on the ship of the line and by 00 : 30 the frigate was within range , pulling up under the stern of Guillaume Tell and beginning a steady fire to which Decrés could only respond with his stern @-@ chasers , light cannon situated in the stern of the ship . Decrés recognised that if he stopped to engage Penelope then the rest of Berry 's squadron , visible on the horizon to the south , would soon overwhelm him . He therefore continued sailing to the northeast , hoping his heavy ship of the line could outrun the light and speedy frigate . However , Penelope was too fast , and Blackwood handled his ship with considerable skill , managing to pass Decrés ' stern repeatedly and pour several raking broadsides into the French ship . 
 Blackwood 's attack was so successful that by dawn on 31 March Guillaume Tell had lost its main and mizen topmasts and its main yard , considerably reducing the speed at which Decrés could travel . The French ship had also suffered heavy casualties in the exchange , but Penelope had lost only one man killed and three wounded , and was almost undamaged . British reinforcements were now arriving from the south : the 64 @-@ gun HMS Lion under Captain Dixon had received Minorca 's warning at 01 : 00 and immediately sailed in pursuit , sending the brig on to Captain Sir Edward Berry in HMS Foudroyant , who lay some distance to leeward . By 05 : 00 , Dixon was close enough to engage , passing between Penelope and Guillaume Tell and firing a triple @-@ shotted broadside into the port side of the French ship . Shooting ahead of the now sluggish Guillaume Tell , Lion crossed its opponent 's bows and shot away the jib boom , allowing Dixon to maintain a position across the bow , raking the French ship from one end while Penelope did the same to the other . During these manoeuvres , Dixon 's ship had briefly become entangled with Guillaume Tell 's rigging , and two determined efforts to board the British ship had been driven off as the ships were disentangled . 
 For half an hour , Lion continued to fire into the larger Guillaume Tell , but Dixon was unable to keep his ship completely out of range of the French broadsides and by 05 : 30 the subsequent damage showed an effect , Lion dropping back and falling behind the French vessel , although remaining within range alongside Penelope . At 06 : 00 , Guillaume Tell came under attack for the third time , when Berry himself caught up with the battling ships in Foudroyant and pulled along the starboard broadside of the French ship of the line . Berry hailed Decrés to demand his surrender , and accompanied the demand with a triple @-@ shotted broadside , to which Decrés responded with fire from his own guns . Foudroyant was flying a full set of sails and therefore suffered severe damage to its rigging in the opening exchange , the additional speed provided by this rig forcing Foudroyant to move ahead of the French vessel . After working back alongside Guillaume Tell , Berry recommenced fire that rapidly tore away much of the remaining French rigging , allowing Lion and Penelope to return to the battle while Foudroyant dropped back to make urgent repairs . 
 By 06 : 30 the badly outnumbered French ship had lost both its main and mizen masts , Foudroyant returning to the battle in time to collapse the foremast by 08 : 00 . At 08 : 20 , with no means of making sail and with wreckage obscuring most of his gun decks , Decrés surrendered to spare any further , fruitless , loss of life . His ship was in danger : the lack of masts and strong winds caused it to roll so severely that the lower deck gun ports had to be closed to prevent the ship from foundering . Casualties on the French ship numbered more than 200 , from a crew of over 900 , with both Decrés and Saulnier badly wounded . British losses were lighter , with eight killed and 64 wounded , including Berry , in Foudroyant , eight killed and 38 wounded in Lion and one killed and three wounded ( one fatally ) in Penelope . Damage was unevenly spread , Foudroyant suffering most severely , with the hull and all masts damaged , the mizzenmast so badly that it collapsed at approximately 12 : 00 , wounding five more men . Lion was badly hit , although not so severely as Foudroyant while Penelope was only lightly damaged in the masts and rigging . The battle , which had begun within sight of Malta , had concluded roughly 21 nautical miles ( 39 km ) south @-@ west of Cape Passaro on Sicily . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Both Foudroyant and Lion were too battered to provide an effective tow to the dismasted French ship , and as a result Penelope was left to bring the shattered Guillaume Tell into Syracuse on Sicily . Eventually the ship was repaired sufficiently for the journey to Britain , and there was added to the Royal Navy under the name HMS Malta . Malta was , with HMS Tonnant captured two years earlier at the Nile , the most powerful third rate in the British fleet , and served for many years , participating at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in 1805 . 
 The British officers were praised for the capture of Guillaume Tell , the last surviving French ship of the line to escape the Battle of the Nile : Nelson , who by his absence had " missed what would indeed have been the crowning glory to his Mediterranean career " , wrote to Berry that " Your conduct and character in the late glorious occasion stamps your fame beyond the reach of envy . " Despite Nelson 's praise however , Berry in particular came in for subsequent criticism , especially from the historian William James , who wrote in his 1827 history of the conflict that : 
 " Had the Foudroyant , single @-@ handed , met the Guillaume @-@ Tell , the combat would have been between two of the most powerful ships that had ever so met ; and , although the Foudroyant 's slight inferiority of force , being chiefly in number of men , was not that of which a British captain would complain , still the chances were equal , that the Guillaume @-@ Tell , so gallantly manned , and so ably commanded , came off the conqueror . " 
 James instead attributed most of the praise for the victory to Blackwood and Dixon , whose ships were heavily outmatched by Guillaume Tell , but who successfully pressed their attacks with the intention of delaying the French retreat . He also highly praised Decrés for his conduct in the engagement , stating that " A more heroic defence than that of the Guillaume @-@ Tell is not to be found among the records of naval actions " . First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte reached a similar conclusion , and when Decrés was exchanged soon after the battle he was presented with armes d 'honneur , later converted to membership of the Légion d 'honneur . He was also given the position of maritime prefect of the Biscay port of Lorient . 
 Aboard Guillaume Tell , the British found evidence of the severity of the food shortages in Valletta : " the only thing found in La Guillaume Tell was the leg of a mule , hung for safety and his especial use of the admiral 's stern @-@ galley " . News of the capture of Guillaume Tell was immediately passed to Vaubois by the British besiegers , along with a demand that he surrender the island . The French general , despite dwindling food supplies , refused , stating " Cette place est en trop bon état , et je suis moi @-@ même trop jaloux de bien servir men <unk> de <unk> mon honneur , por écouter vos propositions . " ( " This place is in too good a situation , and I am too conscious of the service of my country and my honour , to listen to your proposals " ) . Despite Vaubois ' defiance , the garrison was rapidly starving , and although the French commander resisted until 4 September , he was eventually forced to surrender Valletta and all of its military equipment to the British .

 An Adventurous Automobile Trip ( French : Le Raid Paris – Monte @-@ Carlo en automobile or Le Raid Paris – Monte @-@ Carlo en deux heures ) is a 1905 French short silent comedy film directed by Georges Méliès . The film , a spoof of the devil @-@ may @-@ care motoring exploits of King Leopold II of Belgium , features the King engaging in a manic , implausibly fast automobile ride from Paris to Monte Carlo . The singer @-@ comedian Harry Fragson stars as the King , supported by a large cast of stage performers from the Folies Bergère cabaret and other venues , with two cameo appearances from Méliès himself . 
 Méliès , working in collaboration with the stage director Victor de Cottens , designed An Adventurous Automobile Trip as an innovative Folies Bergère act combining stage performance and film , with a live prologue and epilogue used to frame the filmed sequence . After this version premiered on 31 December 1904 , Méliès adapted the film to be a standalone release for general distribution in 1905 . The lavish film , available in both black @-@ and @-@ white and hand @-@ colored versions , was a popular and critical success both in France and in America . However , the film 's high production values made it too expensive for many exhibitors , one of several factors that sent Méliès 's career into decline .

 King Leopold , on holiday in Paris , wants to visit Monte Carlo , but does not have time for the seventeen @-@ hour express train ride between the two cities . He happens upon an automobile maker who claims his car can make the distance in just two hours . The King agrees and sets off in the car , with the auto maker acting as chauffeur . A large crowd sees them off from outside the Paris Opera House , including many celebrities from the Paris theatre world . After stopping to fill the car with gas , the King starts it and , from inexperience , accidentally runs it backward over a policeman , who is squashed flat as a pancake . The King starts inflating him with a pump , and then , to save time , lets other onlookers finish the job while he drives off . The onlookers set to the work with gusto , so much so that the overinflated policeman ends up exploding . 
 The car speeds over the French countryside and into the Alps , leaping between mountains and knocking over a postman as it goes . At the gates of Dijon , town officials try to stop the car to enforce the octroi tax , but the car keeps its course and runs headlong into one of the officials , who explodes in his turn . The car <unk> its way across the Mediterranean coast , overturning a fruit stand , crashing through a greenhouse , colliding with a tar wagon ( with another explosion ensuing ) , and , finally , arriving at the grandstand of spectators awaiting them at Monte Carlo . The car is now going at such speed that , rather than stopping in front of the grandstand , it somersaults up the stairs and crashes to earth . The King and chauffeur , unharmed by their adventurous race , are greeted warmly . 
 = = Production = = 
 For the 1904 Folies Bergère cabaret revue , the director Victor de Cottens approached Méliès — then at the height of his fame as a filmmaker — with the idea of combining theatre and cinema by presenting a short film as one of the fourteen segments of the stage production . The two directors worked out a scenario that would parody the motoring adventures of King Leopold II of Belgium , who was famous for driving , and often crashing , fast cars . In the stage @-@ screen amalgamation devised by Méliès and de Cottens , the segment began as a sketch with live performers before continuing as a film ; at the end of the film , the actor playing the King , as well as other actors playing cheering spectators , returned to the stage to finish the sketch live . 
 Méliès drew the cast of the film from various sources . Harry Fragson , a London @-@ born singer and comedian who was one of the stars of the Folies Bergère at the time , played the lead role of King Leopold . Louis Maurel , a Paris singer and comedian who had worked with Fragson in the 1903 Folies Bergère revue , was the chauffeur . In the scene in front of the Paris Opera , the celebrities assembled include Jean <unk> , a singer at the opera house ; the short actor Little <unk> , whose persona was a close imitation of the better @-@ known British comedian Little Tich , and who also acted in films by Pathé Frères and the Gaumont Film Company ; the tall actor <unk> , known as the " Giant Swede ; " Félix <unk> , who had been a popular music hall <unk> in Paris since the 1880s and who acted in several Méliès films ; Jane Yvon , a Folies Bergère entertainer ; Séverin <unk> , a popular mime ; and de Cottens himself . Fernande Albany , who also appeared in Méliès 's films The Impossible Voyage , Tunnelling the English Channel , and The Conquest of the Pole , played the plump lady in the Dijon scene , and the Folies Bergère entertainers <unk> and <unk> also made appearances . Méliès himself plays two roles in the film : a mailman who gets knocked over by the car , and the octroi official who explodes . Méliès also cast more extras in the film than was usual for him , sometimes staging them in layered arrangements for visual clarity , and sometimes letting them move at whim to create more disorganized , naturalistic groupings . 
 In addition to the parody of King Leopold II , Méliès 's scenario for the film features another topical element : the scene with the tar wagon is based on the experiments of Ernest <unk> , who spread tar over a small part of the gravel road to Monaco . This experiment , widely reported by the press , successfully eliminated the dust clouds kicked up by cars on gravel and sand roads . 
 The film 's special effects were created using stage machinery , miniature models , pyrotechnics , and the editing technique known as the substitution splice . Long shots showing the car were filmed with a miniature car and a landscape rolling past it , creating a multiplane effect . Most scenes , including the detailed and faithful recreation of the Place de l 'Opéra outside the Opera House , were painted studio sets , as was Méliès 's custom . However , the last scene , showing the arrival at Monte Carlo , was filmed not in the studio but outdoors in Méliès 's garden . 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 An Adventurous Automobile Trip premiered at the gala opening night of the Folies Bergère revue on 31 December 1904 . It ran for six months at the Folies Bergère , lasting more than 300 performances . Méliès also intended for the film to be shown by exhibitors elsewhere , outside the context of the revue . Thus , after its Folies Bergère run , it was released as a standalone item by Méliès 's Star Film Company and numbered 740 – 749 in its catalogues , where it is advertised as a grande course fantastique <unk> . As with at least four percent of Méliès 's output , the film was available both in black @-@ and @-@ white and in individually hand @-@ colored prints sold at a higher price . 
 The film was also released in the United States , by the New York branch of Méliès 's company . During the summer of 1905 , Klaw & Erlanger showed it at the Aerial Gardens , on the rooftop of the New Amsterdam Theatre . In the American release , the scenes were slightly rearranged : the first and second scenes were switched in order , as were the sixth and seventh . In addition , because of a renumbering , ten tableaux were advertised instead of the French catalogue 's twelve , although no scenes were removed . ( The two prints of the film surviving in the Méliès family 's archive , the Cinémathèque Méliès , use the French ordering of the scenes . ) Another discrepancy between the French and American catalogues occurs for political reasons : the American catalog specifies that the protagonist is King Leopold , but the French one keeps the identity anonymous , so as not to offend Belgian audiences . Similarly , the Alps in the film are named as such in the American catalog but are unnamed in the French one . 
 An Adventurous Automobile Trip was one of Méliès 's most successful films , and ran to acclaim at the Folies Bergère for six months . A notice in The New York Clipper said that the film " is very clever , and keeps the audience in continuous good humor . " The Morning Telegraph concurred , reporting that the film " scored an instant success . Nothing funnier has been seen here in many a day . ... The thing is a scream . " 
 However , the venture was not as profitable as Méliès had expected ; the high costs of the lavish hand @-@ colored film put it out of the reach of many fairground exhibitors . These financial difficulties , which continued with Méliès 's similarly spectacular film The Merry Frolics of Satan the following year , helped hasten the decline of Méliès 's career . 
 Portions of at least three prints of the film survive : a complete nitrate print with the car sometimes painted red , given to Méliès 's granddaughter Madeleine <unk> @-@ Méliès by an American collector ; an incomplete hand @-@ colored nitrate print , bought by <unk> @-@ Méliès from a Belgian collector ; and some fragments at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences . In his book @-@ length study of Méliès , the film historian John Frazer spoke highly of the film , noting its careful use of continuity of direction and comparing it to Mack Sennett 's slapstick comedies and to the 1968 automobile film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang . Méliès made another film in a similar vein , Le Raid New York – Paris en automobile , in 1908 ; it was also received with success .

 I 'm Breathless : Music from and Inspired by the Film Dick Tracy is the second soundtrack album by American singer @-@ songwriter Madonna . It was released on May 22 , 1990 , by Sire Records to promote and accompany the film Dick Tracy . In the film Madonna starred as Breathless Mahoney and her then @-@ boyfriend Warren Beatty played the title role . After filming was complete , Madonna began work on the film 's soundtrack , with songwriter Stephen Sondheim , producer Patrick Leonard and engineer Bill Bottrell . She also worked with producer Shep Pettibone on the album 's first single , " Vogue " . The album was recorded in three weeks , at Johnny Yuma Recording and Ocean Way Studios , in California . 
 Musically , I 'm Breathless consists predominantly of jazz , swing and pop songs . The tracks reflected Madonna 's showgirl personality and were influenced by her relationship with Beatty . The singer wanted to create music that would fit the style and production of the film , set in the days of the Untouchables law enforcement , and sang the songs accordingly . In some areas she pitched her vocals and belted the notes when necessary . She even smoked cigarettes in order to portray the vocals of her character Breathless . Beatty and singer Mandy Patinkin were featured as duet partners on three of the songs . 
 In support of both I 'm Breathless and her previous album , Like a Prayer , Madonna embarked on the Blond Ambition World Tour where a section was dedicated to the songs from the album . It was critically acclaimed , winning an award at the 1990 Pollstar Concert Industry Awards . However , due to its use of Catholic imagery , Pope John Paul II called for a boycott of the show . After the tour was over , Madonna performed songs from the album at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards and the 1991 Academy Awards . " Vogue " , the first single from I 'm Breathless , became one of Madonna 's most successful releases , reaching number one in over 30 countries . It was also critically acclaimed and was seen as an influential song , while the video helped to bring <unk> into mainstream popularity . The second and final single , " Hanky Panky " , was a top @-@ ten hit in the United States and the United Kingdom . 
 The soundtrack received mixed reviews from music critics , who applauded the Sondheim numbers , along with Madonna 's vocals and versatility . However , some deemed the non @-@ film songs to be of little value . " Sooner or Later " , one of the Sondheim tracks , went on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song . I 'm Breathless was commercially successful , peaking at number one on the European Top 100 Albums , as well as the national charts of Australia , Germany , and Japan — in the later it became the country 's best @-@ selling foreign album of the year . It also reached number two on the US Billboard 200 chart and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . I 'm Breathless has sold more than seven million copies worldwide . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 In 1990 , Madonna was part of the film Dick Tracy starring as Breathless Mahoney — a new role introduced for her — with Warren Beatty playing the titular character . Madonna told Premiere magazine that initially she had waited for Beatty to call her for the film . But when he did not , the singer decided to involve herself voluntarily . She pursued the part of Mahoney , but offered to work for minimum wages to avoid favoritism . Principal photography for Dick Tracy began on February 2 , 1989 and ended three months later . The filmmakers considered shooting the film on @-@ location in Chicago , Illinois , but production designer Richard Sylbert believed that Dick Tracy would work better using sound stages and backlots at Universal Studios in Universal City , California . Other filming took place at Warner Bros Studios in Burbank , California . Beatty often encouraged dozens of takes of every scene . The film was released in the United States on June 15 , 1990 , and was the third @-@ highest opening weekend of 1990 . Dick Tracy was the ninth @-@ highest grossing film in the US in 1990 , and number twelve globally . The film also received positive reviews from critics . Roger Ebert from the Chicago Sun @-@ Times praised the matte paintings , art direction and prosthetic makeup design , stating : " Dick Tracy is one of the most original and visionary fantasies I 've seen on a screen " . 
 Beatty had realized several positive aspects of hiring Madonna as an actress for the film . She would be inclined to develop the soundtrack for Dick Tracy and the film studio would see this as a promotional opportunity before the release of their product , since Madonna was popular as a recording artist . This would also benefit Warner Bros. Records , who would get a reason to release a new Madonna record . According to J. Randy Taraborrelli , author of Madonna : An Intimate Biography , by the 1980s record labels started to release albums which were closely associated with a film , thereby gaining double promotion . These were mostly termed as soundtracks although many of them were not related to the film . After the shooting for Dick Tracy was over , Madonna started working on the soundtrack . She had begun recording three songs by Stephen Sondheim for the film — " Sooner or Later " , " More " and " What Can You Lose " — which would be part of the album , but also had to write and develop new songs comparable in style to the previous . In her favor , she produced the entire album , including the Sondheim songs . " I want people to think of me as a musical comedy actress . That 's what this album is about for me . It 's a stretch . Not just pop music , but songs that have a different feel to them , a theatrical feel " , she said at the time . 
 Madonna was in a relationship with Beatty at that time , and her whole acting , recording and singing stemmed from impressing him with the album , which was important to her . Beatty and actor Mandy Patinkin also lent their voices for songs from the album . While I 'm Breathless was being completed , it still needed a lead single . At the same time , Madonna and producer Shep Pettibone decided to compose a new song called " Vogue " to be placed on the B @-@ side of " Keep It Together " , the final single from her fourth studio album , Like a Prayer ( 1989 ) , to ensure that the song would fare better on the charts . When Warner executives heard the song , they decided to release it as an A @-@ side , and was eventually included on I 'm Breathless . 
 = = Recording and composition = = 
 I 'm Breathless is a jazz , swing and pop album where Madonna and Sondheim tried to recreate the music of the period portrayed in Dick Tracy . According to Rikky Rooksby , author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna , the harmonic and melodic styles were more " complex " than the songs which Madonna was accustomed to , hence she found it difficult and demanding . She spoke about the " wilderness " of the tunes , saying that she was not confident of doing justice to the songs , and neither was Sondheim . But he kept on encouraging the singer so that the recording sessions would not be affected . Madonna also recruited producer Patrick Leonard and engineer Bill Bottrell to help her with the project . She and Leonard toiled to create music that would fit the style and production of the film , set in the days of the Untouchables law enforcement . According to Lucy O 'Brien , author of Madonna : Like an Icon , after Madonna 's split from husband Sean Penn in 1989 , the singer was comfortable in her new relationship with Beatty , which influenced the songs . The singer and Leonard enlisted a ten @-@ piece live band and jazz musicians . The sessions took place at Johnny Yuma Recording and Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles , California , and concluded by three weeks . The songs on the album reflect Madonna 's showgirl personality where her singing ranged from " rootsy , rocking " in nature to slow , " laid @-@ back and soulful " vocals . A studied approach was evident in most of them , which O 'Brien compared to " an actress playing a part and performing a vocal exercise in technique " . Some of the songs had Madonna pitching her vocals and belting the notes only when necessary . A dryness was prevalent in most of the singing , which was required for the songs and the setting . Guy Pratt , who also played bass , said that the singer " was in character and started smoking . She actually <unk> a cigarette off me . Her character smoked , so therefore she did . " 
 O 'Brien said that the songs on I 'm Breathless had a " coquettish " and " pandering nature " , and was the polar opposite to Madonna 's previous release , Like a Prayer , which had an introspective composition . I 'm Breathless opens with the sound of an intercom and a shuffle , and power ballad " He 's a Man " starts , a song which Madonna sings as if she was a " hooker stalking the boulevard " . Also , Madonna 's " haunting " vocals continue after the music has faded . One of the Sondheim songs , " Sooner or Later " , is a 1930s jazz ballad with comping piano , brushed drum sounds , double bass and horns . Conjuring the atmosphere of a smoky nightclub , the song finds Madonna in her lowest range as the melody shifts continuously . " Hanky Panky " , the third song and second single , deals with sadomasochistic themes and is centered around a girl who celebrates the pleasures of a " good spanking " . It is performed in an almost comical style , and stemmed from a line in the film , where Breathless says to Tracy , " You don 't know whether to hit me or kiss me " . 
 The following track on the album , " I 'm Going Bananas " , is a Carmen Miranda @-@ ish song done in a Spanish accent . A salsa rhythm is predominant , with Madonna squeezing her vocal cords while singing , backed by percussion and brass . In the fifth track , " Crybaby " , Madonna mimics the vocals of Betty Boop . The melody is heard over the interlining synth strings , horns and trumpets , and a bass . Rooksby explained that Madonna sang about a guy who is " too sensitive and soft " , and the chorus employs a chromatic chord sequence . The next track " Something to Remember " deals with her failed marriage to Penn and was the source of inspiration for naming her 1995 compilation album . Musically , it has melancholy chords and rambling melody , which according to Taraborrelli made it the most compelling song by Madonna . 
 Mark Coleman from Rolling Stone described " Back in Business " as a " nagging headache " . It contains a " slow @-@ verse @-@ fast @-@ chorus " sequence . According to Rooksby , " the chorus bursts into life , with Madonna clearly relishing the lyrics about good guys finishing last ... the coldness of her delivery is apt for the topic . " Her vocals are accompanied by muted trumpet sounds and a saxophone solo . " More " is the second Sondheim number where Madonna recites the materialistic @-@ themed lyrics with irony , over a bouncy two @-@ beat with tap @-@ dancing during an instrumental break . The track consists of syncopated chord structure , tempo changes and lyrical rhymes . The arrangement switches between slow and fast tempo , requiring proper enunciation by Madonna . The final Sondheim song , " What Can You Lose " , is the duet with Patinkin . It is a torch song where Patinkin supplies the male voice while Madonna sings during the second verse with strings and harmonics . 
 Madonna sings a two @-@ part duet with Beatty titled " Now I 'm Following You " . With beats atop a riff , Madonna reveals that " Dick " is an " interesting name " . The first part has strings , brass and muted horns , with a tap @-@ dancing sequence during the intermediate piano solo and blues effect . At the last chord , the sound of the record getting stuck is heard , and a needle is drawn across the vinyl , leading into the much faster part two . The word " Dick " is continuously repeated in the main melody structure until the song ends with the sound of a record being snatched off a music player . Bill Meyers , who played piano during the recording , recalled that the song required only one take from Beatty . " Vogue " closes out the album and is musically different from the rest of the tracks . It is a dance number consisting of a " throbbing beat " and lyrically has a theme of escapism . The song talks about <unk> , a dance form which reproduced poses from high @-@ fashion modelling . The song also has a rap section , where Madonna names various " golden era " Hollywood celebrities , including Greta Garbo , Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Dietrich .

 Madonna had first performed " Vogue " at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards , where she and her dancers were clad in 18th century @-@ inspired fashions , inspired by Marie Antoinette . Madonna re @-@ created an 18th @-@ century French court , with sexual innuendo in the performance . At one point the singer flipped open her large skirt , allowing one of her dancers to crawl inside and come out through the other side . Her dancer Carlton Wilborn explained that " [ such ] level of production had never been done on MTV . The costumes , the fans , the drama ... MTV just had no idea , we just came out and rocked . " O 'Brien described the performance as a " moment of inspired brilliance " , while Taraborrelli noted it as a " classic , camp show that elevated the standards of future performances on that program " . It was later ranked by Billboard as the sixth best performance in the history of the award show . 
 At the 1991 Academy Awards , Madonna appeared with singer Michael Jackson as her date and performed " Sooner or Later " . According to journalist Liz Smith , Madonna had promised to perform at the award show if either " Sooner or Later " or " More " was nominated in the Best Original Song category . She wore a long , tight , white dress designed by Bob Mackie and covered in sequins and pearls . On her neck she wore $ 20 million worth of jewelry from Harry Winston . Taraborrelli recalled that Madonna had appropriated every move and mannerisms of Marilyn Monroe for the performance , making it a tribute to the actress . When she appeared onstage , there was technical difficulty resulting in the microphone not rising from below the stage , and a stage @-@ hand passing it to her . Billboard ranked it as the seventh " most awesome " Oscar performance of all time , saying that " Madonna gave a performance that took us back to the glamorous days of old Hollywood . " 
 = = = Tour = = = 
 I 'm Breathless , alongside Madonna 's previous album , Like a Prayer , was majorly promoted in Madonna 's third concert tour , the Blond Ambition World Tour , which visited Asia , North America and Europe . Consisting of 57 dates , the concert was divided into five sections , the first inspired by the 1927 German expressionist film Metropolis , the second by religious themes , the third by Dick Tracy and cabaret , the fourth by Art Deco , and the fifth was an encore . The show contained sexual themes and Catholic imagery , such as in Madonna 's performance of " Like a Prayer " , which was based in church @-@ like surroundings with Madonna wearing a crucifix and her backup dancers dressed like priests and nuns . The concert was criticized for its sexual content and religious imagery ; in Toronto , Canada , Madonna was threatened of being arrested for obscenity , and Pope John Paul II later called for a boycott , with one of the three Italian dates being cancelled . Despite this , the tour was a critical success , winning " Most Creative Stage Production " at the 1990 Pollstar Concert Industry Awards . 
 The performance of the I 'm Breathless songs began with " Sooner or Later " sung atop a grand piano , followed by " Hanky Panky " , where Madonna stood in front of a microphone and sang it . She was dressed in a striped vaudeville @-@ style corset , playing the part of a nightclub singer . Near the end Madonna joked : " You all know the pleasures of a good spanking , don 't you ? [ ... ] When I hurt people , I feel better , you know what I mean ? " The final song of the segment was " Now I 'm Following You " where Madonna danced and lip @-@ synched with dancer Salim <unk> , who was dressed like Dick Tracy . Regarding the " shameless promotion " of Dick Tracy in this segment , O 'Brien said that " along with her yen for artistic expression , Madonna has always had an eye on the bottom dollar ... [ But ] the Dick Tracy section is the least dynamic part of the show " .

 " Vogue " was released as the lead single from the soundtrack , on March 20 , 1990 . A deep house influenced song , it became Madonna 's eighth single to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart . It also reached the top of the Hot Dance Club Play chart . Internationally , " Vogue " reached the top the charts in 30 countries , such as the United Kingdom , Australia , Canada , Italy and Finland . It became the world 's best @-@ selling single of 1990 , selling over six million copies . " Vogue " has been continuously acclaimed since its release ; reviewers have praised its anthemic nature , calling it a " funky " and " catchy " song , and listed it as one of the singer 's musical highlights . 
 The music video for " Vogue " , directed by David Fincher , showed Madonna paying homage to various golden era Hollywood actresses . Shot in black @-@ and @-@ white , the video takes stylistic inspiration from the 1920s and 30s ; in it , Madonna and her dancers can be seen voguing different choreographed scenes . Critics noted the way in which Madonna used her postmodern influence to expose an underground subcultural movement to the masses and for making the sex and gender roles ambiguous in its portrayal of people . The video has been ranked as one of the greatest of all times in different critic lists and polls , and won three awards at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards , out of a total of nine nominations . 
 The album 's second single , " Hanky Panky " , was released on June 30 , 1990 . Critical response for the song was positive , with The New York Times calling it " a calculated bid for outrage " . It enjoyed commercial success , reaching the top ten in Italy , New Zealand and the United Kingdom . In the United States , peaked at number ten in the week of July 28 , 1990 .

 J. Randy Taraborrelli gave I 'm Breathless a favorable review in his book Madonna : An Intimate Biography , writing that it was " one of Madonna 's greatest musical moments " , and praising her vocal performance . Authors Allen Metz and Carol Benson wrote in their book The Madonna Companion that the album suited Madonna well , but questioned her decision to make it a subsidiary for Dick Tracy instead of an independent release . Lucky Lara from Manila Standard Today denoted the album as a " surprise career decision " for Madonna and found that it showcased the singer 's versatility and other facets of her pop personality . She added that the album was able to prove that Madonna " is cut out to do many other things , not just the trashy stuff " . Writing for the Sarasota Herald @-@ Tribune , Liz Smith gave another positive review , calling the album " excellent , different from anything [ Madonna ] has ever attempted " , and listing the Sondheim songs as highlights . 
 Ray Boren from Deseret News was impressed with Madonna 's vocals , calling them " sultry " and " cutesy " , listing " Vogue " and " Something to Remember " as highlights . Greg Sandow of Entertainment Weekly gave I 'm Breathless an A rating , praising Madonna for " invent [ ing ] a new Broadway vocal persona , built around a chest voice not yet perfectly under control but still much richer and duskier than her low range sounded before . " Robert Christgau from The Village Voice said the record 's " show @-@ tune @-@ pop @-@ <unk> " suits Madonna " with its pedigree of wit and musicality " , as does the music 's campiness , which she " sure knows how to do right " . He listed " Cry Baby " , " He 's a Man " and " Hanky Panky " as the best tracks . Mark Coleman from Rolling Stone gave the album a rating of three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half out of five stars and positive review , claiming that Madonna " pulls it off with brass and panache " . He added that " Vogue " showed the singer " can still deliver that indefinable something extra " . Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave it four out of five stars , declaring : " I 'm Breathless proves that Madonna is a true renaissance woman " . 
 According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times , " after all the nuances Madonna has brought to the role of the bad girl , it 's strange that she would settle now for such a restricted , unexamined version of respectability " and " for the first time , Madonna has let the deal dictate the music " . Tan Gim <unk> from New Straits Times noted that Madonna played against her strengths on the songs of the album . He described her vocals as " competent " , but felt that the songs required " more range and agility than Madonna has at her disposal . " Dave Tianen from Milwaukee Journal Sentinel described the album as a " mixed bag of period pieces , some of them too cute for their own good " , adding that " I 'm Breathless never becomes more than the sum of its mannerisms " . AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine claimed that the songs are just " cutesy novelty numbers " , and listing " Vogue " as a standout track . Rooksby panned the album , saying that it " failed to transcend the sterile , preserved @-@ in @-@ amber quality of pastiche " . Mark Cooper from Q magazine lamented , in its June 1990 review , " It 's something of a disappointment because the lady herself stays so firmly committed to a character who 's less original than the persona she evolved during the ' 80s . " Nonetheless , in the same magazine 's December 1994 issue , Madonna declared : " I would have to say the favorite record that I 've made is the soundtrack to Dick Tracy . I love every one of those songs ... My judgment is never based on the world 's reaction . "

Abismo is a SkyLoop XT 450 ( an extension to the XT 150 ) and continues to be the only XT 450 built as of November 2012 . Since then , only XT 150 's have been built around the world . Maurer Söhne also have 3 additional models of the SkyLoop ; XT 900 ( extension to XT 150 ) , Custom , and Launch ( uses the XT 150 layout where the train gets launched up the lift hill ) , although as of November 2012 none have been built .

 Currently , the SkyLoop consists of 5 models ; XT 150 , XT 450 , XT 900 , Custom , and Launch .

 SkyLoop XT 150 is a short , 492 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 150 m ) roller coaster that reaches a maximum height of 171 feet ( 52 m ) ( the actual track reaches 164 feet ( 50 m ) ) and a top speed of 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) . This model also has two inversions and uses a single train featuring 2 X @-@ Cars that seat 6 people each . 
 After the train departs from the station , it immediately begins to climb the vertical ( 90 degree ) lift hill . Upon reaching the top of the lift , the train turns 45 degrees backwards putting the train and its riders in an upside down position . Then , as the train exits the lift , it goes through a heartline roll before going down the only drop in the layout of the roller coaster . The train speeds through the station going back up the lift . Once it loses momentum the train then returns down passing through the station again . It then proceeds back up the drop and partially into the heartline roll before once again losing momentum and returning to the ground . After passing the station for the third time , the train is stopped near the top of the lift hill . It is then lowered back down to the station where the next riders board the train . The XT 150 has the option of sending riders around a second cycle at the operator 's discretion . When the train stops on the lift hill at the end of the ride , instead of lowering slowly back to the station , the chain will raise the car up and send it through the ride again .

 SkyLoop XT 450 is a 1 @,@ 345 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 410 m ) roller coaster that reaches a maximum height of 171 feet ( 52 m ) ( the actual track reaches 151 feet ( 46 m ) ) and a top speed of 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) . This model is an extension of the XT 150 ; the beginning is the same . The XT 450 has 4 inversions and also uses a train made up of 2 X @-@ Cars that seat 6 people each . 
 The roller coaster begins the same way that the XT 150 model does . After the train departs from the station , it immediately begins to climb the vertical ( 90 degree ) lift hill . Upon reaching the top of the lift , the train turns 45 degrees backwards putting the train and its riders in an upside down position . After , as the train exits the lift , it goes through an heartline roll . The train enters the first drop where it reaches its maximum speed of 65 miles per hour ( 105 km / h ) before traversing a tight left overbanked turn . After the turn , the train goes over the only camelback hill followed by another left overbanked turn . The train then follows a flat section of track before going down a small drop leading into the station and back up the lift where the train stops . The train is then lowered back down to the station where the next riders board the ride .

 SkyLoop XT 900 is a concept that has yet to be built . The design of model begins the same way as the XT 150 does as the lift , first inversion , and first drop are all present in both models . Along with the elements from the XT 150 model , the XT 900 includes a series of turns , overbanked turns , a loop , and a cobra roll .

 SkyLoop Launch is a concept that has also yet to be built . This design can be incorporated with the XT 150 , 450 , 900 , and Custom models as the " launch " takes place where the normal lift would be . The top speed of the launch would be 27 miles per hour ( 43 km / h ) and is driven by linear synchronous motors ( LSM ) . If this concept were to be built , not only would it have the world 's highest inversion , but also the world 's highest vertical launch .

 = Jacques Le Gris = 
 Sir Jacques Le Gris ( c . 1330s – 27 December 1386 ) was a squire and knight in fourteenth century France who gained fame and infamy when he engaged in the last judicial duel permitted by the Parlement of Paris after he was accused of rape by the wife of his neighbour and rival Sir Jean de Carrouges . Carrouges brought legal proceedings against Le Gris before King Charles VI who after hearing the evidence , authorised a trial by combat to determine the question . The duel attracted thousands of spectators and has been discussed by many notable French writers , from the contemporary Jean Froissart to Voltaire . 
 Described as a large and physically imposing character with a reputation for womanising , Le Gris was a liege man ( feudal retainer ) of Count Pierre d 'Alençon and a favourite at his court , governing a large swathe of his liege lord 's territory in addition to his own ancestral holdings . Le Gris ' insistence on defending his case by chivalric trial by combat rather than opting for the safer church trial ( to which as a cleric in minor orders he was entitled ) attracted widespread support for his cause amongst the French nobility , and controversy continues to this day as to where the real guilt lies in the case . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Jacques Le Gris was born in the 1330s , the son of a minor Norman squire Guillaume Le Gris . Unusually for the time , he was educated , taking minor orders as a cleric in the church and able to read sufficiently well to officiate at mass . Like his father , Le Gris was first a man @-@ at @-@ arms and then squire in the service of the Count of Perche , a role at which he excelled . He also participated in several minor military campaigns in Normandy in the entourage of Robert d 'Alençon . In 1370 his long service was rewarded when he was given command of one of his liege lord 's castles at the village of Exmes . During his career , he became firm friends with Jean de Carrouges , another squire in the Count 's service . Carrouges and Le Gris were so close that in 1377 , the same year that Count Robert died , Carrouges made Le Gris godfather to his eldest son , a position of great responsibility and trust . 
 With the arrival of Count Robert 's brother Pierre d 'Alençon as the new count , the friendship between the two squires became strained . Le Gris was an able , amiable and intelligent man and soon became one of the new Count 's favourites . When Count Pierre moved his court to Argentan , Le Gris lent him 3 @,@ 000 livres and , in reward , was confirmed as Seigneur of Exmes and given a valuable estate at Arnou @-@ le @-@ Faucon . As Le Gris rose in his lord 's esteem , the poorer Carrouges was frequently overlooked , resulting in a deterioration in their friendship which was only worsened by the death of Carrouges ' wife and son in 1380 , severing the men 's family ties . 
 Shortly after the death of his family , Carrouges departed on campaign in Upper Normandy while Le Gris - thanks to his literacy and military skills - rose steadily in importance in Count Pierre 's court , travelling with the count when he went to Paris on business . During the course of these trips , Count Pierre introduced Le Gris at the royal court and was instrumental in gaining him the prestigious title of Royal Steward , a position within the household of the King , Charles VI . 
 = = = Legal difficulties = = = 
 In 1381 , Le Gris and Carrouges engaged in a very public argument over the domain of Arnou @-@ le @-@ Faucon . Carrouges had returned from the wars with a new bride , Marguerite de Thibouville , daughter of a controversial Norman squire who until recently had owned Arnou . Although the lands had been legally bought by Count Pierre in 1377 for 8 @,@ 000 livres , Carrouges wanted them back as part of his dowry and took Count Pierre in court to return them . Count Pierre was forced to visit his cousin the King to obtain royal approval for his purchase and consequently was furious with Carrouges . The eventual result was that Carrouges was isolated from the court and subjected to three years of legal struggles over land with Count Pierre , who denied him the purchase or inheritance of several estates . Le Gris was heavily involved in these legal disputes both as the Seigneur of Arnou @-@ le @-@ Faucon and as adviser to the Count . He thus became a target of Carrouges , who accused Le Gris of orchestrating the lawsuits against him . 
 A rapprochement between the two men was achieved in the winter of 1384 , when Carrouges and Le Gris were both invited to the estate of a mutual friend , Jean Crespin , to celebrate the birth of his son . For the first time , Carrouges brought his wife Marguerite into society and it was at this party that she made her first acquaintance with Le Gris . Despite the tension between them , Carrouges and Le Gris shook hands and drank together , putting their quarrel behind them before their peers and neighbours . A few months later Jean de Carrouges departed on campaign to Scotland and Le Gris took the opportunity to increase his influence with the Count , making substantial financial and territorial gains in the his rival 's absence . Carrouges returned a year later , now a knight but bankrupt , ill and suffering the aftermath of a long and unsuccessful campaign . When Carrouges appeared at Argentan in January 1386 he was involved in a confrontation with his erstwhile friend . Although it is not known what was said , the two men separated on poor terms and Carrouges departed for Paris in a state of agitation . 
 = = On trial for rape = = 
 Some weeks after their encounter , word reached Le Gris of accusations being made against him by Carrouges and his wife . It will never be known what basis these allegations had in fact but Carrouges claimed that on 18 January 1386 , whilst Carrouges was still in Paris , Le Gris had entered the chateau of Carrouges ' mother Nicole and there raped Marguerite . According to Marguerite de Carrouges ' testimony , a squire in Le Gris ' employ named Adam Louvel had knocked on the door of the chateau and demanded entry . All the servants were attending to Dame Nicole de Carrouges , who was visiting a neighbouring town on legal business , and so Marguerite was alone when Louvel called . Once inside , Louvel gave Marguerite a message that Le Gris was outside and desired to see her because he was passionately in love with her . Although Marguerite protested , Le Gris broke into the house and propositioned her , offering money in exchange . When Marguerite refused , Le Gris attempted to take her by force and raped her on the bed in her chamber with the help of Louvel . As Le Gris departed , he threatened her with violence if she told of the encounter . 
 Charges were brought by the Carrouges ' faction against Le Gris in the court of Count Pierre but Carrouges and his wife refused to attend the hearing , so convinced were they of receiving unfair treatment from the Count . Count Pierre backed his favourite in the trial , clearing Le Gris and accusing Marguerite of inventing or " dreaming " the charges . Undeterred , Carrouges then visited the court of King Charles VI at the Château de Vincennes and appealed to the King for the right to challenge Le Gris to a judicial duel to allow God to decide the case . The King referred the case to the Parlement of Paris , where both claimants were expected to appear on 9 July . 
 Informed of the King 's decision , Le Gris contacted Jean Le Coq , widely considered the best lawyer of the day in France . Le Coq kept meticulous notes of the entire trial process and it is through his record that many of the facts of the case are known . Le Coq also comments in his records his own suspicions about his client , whose claims of innocence he considered to be false . Le Gris was urged by his family and lawyer to insist on being tried in a church court , which as a cleric in minor orders was his right . This would have given him a more favourable hearing in a court which did not condone trial by combat and thus would also be much safer . Le Gris rebuffed this advice and became angry when challenged on the decision , insisting on his right to trial before the Parlement . 
 On 9 July 1386 , at the Palais de Justice in Paris the two claimants faced each other for the first time since their confrontation at Argentan several months before . Each stepped before the Parlement in turn and presented their case for the King and court , Carrouges throwing down his gauntlet in challenge and Le Gris picking it up signifying his acceptance of the duel . Le Gris also embellished his case by insisting that should he be proven innocent of the offence , he would sue Carrouges or his estate for 40 @,@ 000 livres . Following the declarations a number of high @-@ ranking noblemen stepped forward to act as seconds in the duel for both men , including Waleran of Saint @-@ Pol for Carrouges and Philip of Artois , Count of Eu for Le Gris . After hearing the challenges and accusations , the Parlement and King debated the case and decided that a full hearing of the evidence from witnesses would be held to determine guilt . If the case could not be decided by normal means , then a judicial duel would be held to adjudicate the dispute , God choosing the victor . 
 During the criminal trial , all the major figures in the case were called on to give evidence . Le Gris and Carrouges began proceedings and were followed by a heavily pregnant Marguerite and at least one of her maidservants as well as Adam Louvel . As people of low birth , Louvel and the servants were all subject to torture to test the veracity of their testimony but none gave evidence against Le Gris and the case continued through the summer and into September without conclusion . Le Gris ' case involved several strategies ; he attempted to discredit his opponent by telling of Carrouges ' infamous temper and describing the case against him as a jealous invention from a man who had threatened to beat his wife if she did not corroborate his accusations . Le Gris then provided alibis for the entire week in question , establishing his whereabouts in testimony backed up by several other squires of the court of Count Pierre . Finally he attempted to demonstrate in court that it was physically impossible for him to have ridden in winter from Argentan to Capomesnil , where the crime supposedly took place , in a single day , a round trip of approximately 50 miles ( 80 km ) . 
 As the trial progressed however , Le Gris ' testimony suffered several blows . The unwavering accusations directed at him by Marguerite and the shame such accusations brought to her were , in the eyes of the court , a powerful reason why the charges were not invented . Then , even as the trial progressed , one of the men providing Le Gris ' alibi , named Jean Beloteau , was arrested in Paris and charged with rape . This charge seriously undermined Beloteau 's testimony and Le Gris ' defence . Finally , Carrouges himself offered counter @-@ testimony in court that a healthy , strong man with long experience of horsemanship and a stable full of horses like Le Gris could certainly have made the 50 mile trip without difficulty , even accounting for the snow . 
 = = A judicial duel = = 
 Faced with such conflicting accounts and unable to reach a conclusion , the Parlement announced on 15 September that the two men would fight to the death on 27 November 1386 to decide guilt in the case . If Carrouges lost , then Marguerite would be burnt at the stake for perjury . In fact , the duel was delayed a month as the King and his court , which contained most of the country 's senior dukes and generals , was held up on campaign in Flanders and could not return in time . Eager to see what was rapidly becoming the event of the season , the King ordered the duel postponed until 29 December so that he would be present for its culmination . 
 On the day decreed , Le Gris and Carrouges travelled through Paris to the Abbey of Saint @-@ Martin @-@ des @-@ Champs in the city 's Northern suburbs . The abbey 's field had been converted from a jousting ground to a wooden arena especially for the combat , surrounded by banks for the spectators and a royal box . Attending the duel was not only the King and his uncles John , Duke of Berry , Philip the Bold and Louis II , Duke of Bourbon and his brother the Duke of Orléans , but thousands of ordinary Parisians , Normans and visiting French . Thousands of people had flooded into the city in the days before the combat to see the spectacle but all had been warned not to physically aid the combatants on pain of death , nor call out during the fight on pain of losing a hand . 
 Although legal accounts do not describe the course of the combat , contemporary chroniclers have left several records of the day 's battle . According to the chronicles , the claimants entered the field last and before all present repeated their accusations against the other and swore oaths guaranteeing their honesty before the King , Parlement and God . Before they remounted , the marshal of the duel performed a brief ceremony in which he knighted Jacques Le Gris . This ceremony was traditional before battle but also performed a part in maintaining the social structure of medieval France . With both men on the same social footing , there would be no defeat of a senior rank by a lesser one . Having been raised to the status of a knight , Sir Jacques regained his horse and the arena was cleared . Both knights were heavily armed and armoured , protected by a hide and wood shield bearing their coat of arms and thick plate armour , riding a heavy warhorse and wielding a lance , longsword , heavy battle axe and long dagger known as a misericordia . 
 At the marshal 's signal , silence descended over the field and both knights spurred their horses and charged , their lances each striking the other 's shield but not causing significant damage . Wheeling , both again struck but failed to penetrate , scoring glancing blows on their helmets but remaining horsed . For a third time they turned and charged and again they both struck . This time however the lances shattered , sending slivers of wood cartwheeling across the arena and nearly unseating both men . Regaining balance , the knights closed on one another with battle axes drawn , trading furious two @-@ handed blows . As the engagement progressed , Le Gris ' superior strength began to tell and Carrouges was driven back until with a mighty swing , Le Gris ' axe severed the spine of Carrouges ' horse . The dying beast tumbled to the ground , Carrouges leaping clear and meeting Le Gris ' charge with a side @-@ step , allowing him to thrust his own axe 's pike deep into the stomach of Le Gris ' steed . 
 As his horse faltered and collapsed , Le Gris was thrown off and lost his axe . Undaunted , he rose and drew his longsword , turning to meet Carrouges who was already advancing on him , sword also drawn . Again the combatants traded blows , their weapons the only sounds heard in the silent battleground . Again , Le Gris ' superior strength gave him an advantage , pushing Carrouges back before thrusting his blade through his opponent 's thigh . As the crowd murmured , Le Gris made a fatal mistake ; withdrawing his weapon , he stepped back to watch his wounded enemy and was thus off balance when the desperate Carrouges threw himself forwards , wrestling Le Gris to the ground and hacking at him with his own longsword . Although Le Gris ' plate armour was too thick to allow Carrouges ' weapon to penetrate , it was also so heavy that he could not regain his feet with Carrouges on top of him . Stranded on the ground , Le Gris struggled as Carrouges straddled him and used his sword to smash open the lock on Le Gris ' faceplate . As the crowd watched in silence , Carrouges shouted in Le Gris ' exposed face for him to confess his crime before death or face hell . Le Gris replied so all could hear , " In the name of God , and on the peril and damnation of my soul , I am innocent of the crime " . Enraged , Carrouges drew his misericordia and thrust it through Le Gris ' throat , killing him instantly . 
 At Le Gris ' death the crowd cheered and the King greeted the victor with several fine presents . Carrouges became a wealthy and famous man as a result of his victory , but despite his end Le Gris was not forgotten . In the duel 's immediate aftermath , the Executioner of Paris took charge of the body and stripped its armour and clothing before dragging it through the streets to the Gibbet of Montfaucon . There it was strung up alongside the bodies of murderers and thieves to rot before eventually being flung into a common grave . However , the memory of Jacques Le Gris was kept alive by his family and supporters for many years . His son Guillaume Le Gris paid over 200 francs for masses to be said for his father , " a man of noble memory " and continued to pay similar sums for at least ten years after his death . Count Pierre too retained favourable memories of his advisor , taking revenge by blocking Carrouges ' efforts to purchase more land or expand his influence in Normandy . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 In the centuries since Le Gris ' death the case has become an important cultural legend in France . The duel was the last trial by combat ever permitted by the Parlement de Paris or the French Kings and the guilt or innocence of its participants has been a source of great debate among historians and jurists . The contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart harbours no question over the guilt of Le Gris , whom he considers a villain . Later writers take a different view , including the Grandes <unk> de France and the works of Jehan de Waurin , who repeat with varying details the tale of another culprit admitting his guilt on his deathbed . Other famous writers who studied the case include Diderot in his Encyclopédie and Voltaire in his Histoire du Parlement de Paris . An imaginative version of the legend was repeated by the Encyclopædia Britannica until the 1970s . 
 More recently , several legal studies have been conducted by French jurists . These generally consider it likely that Le Gris was the real culprit based on Marguerite 's evidence , although none of course could prove so conclusively . A major exception to this trend was a book written in 1890 by a descendant of Le Gris named F. White Le <unk> , who makes a determined effort to defend his ancestor . Most recently , the story was studied in Eric Jager 's work The Last Duel , which also considers Le Gris the likely rapist and has attracted the interest of Martin Scorsese , who is reportedly planning to make a feature film based on the book .

When asked of this , Ramirez said : " You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line . Obviously , I 've heard some negative stuff . " The end of the show 's fourth season saw Torres grow closer to cardiothoracic surgeon Erica Hahn , in a relationship referred to by the portmanteau " Eri @-@ Cal " and later " <unk> " by Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly . Rhimes stated that : " Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry , and watching the story unfold is something the writers are looking forward to . I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way we do all relationships on the show — it will be funny , sweet , honest , and a little bit dirty . " 
 She explained that in developing the relationship between the two : " we wanted it to be real – not some stunt to get people talking . We wanted to see what would happen if a woman suddenly had feelings for another woman . " The two characters shared a kiss at the end of the season four finale , with which D. Williams of After Ellen noted : " Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian / bisexual female characters currently on network television . This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance , as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship . " Before continuing with the storyline , the show 's producers consulted with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation to ensure they maintained realism throughout . Trish Doolan , star of April 's Shower was invited to consult in the workshop sessions which took place , and surmised that ; " They were really wanting to be truthful to the two characters they 're focusing on in the woman @-@ woman relationship " , with Nikki Weiss , who also consulted , adding : " they didn 't want to stereotype anything either , and write from a place where they didn 't understand it . [ ... ] I don 't think they did it as a stunt to get people back to watching after the strike . I really think that they wanted to develop these two characters , and that you could see a closeness with them way before they ever decided any kind of — I think they just have a chemistry together , as actresses , too . You could tell that in the room . They definitely have a chemistry . " 
 In the show 's fifth season , Torres embarked on a relationship with Arizona Robbins ( Capshaw ) . The relationship between the two is referred to by the portmanteau " <unk> " . Rhimes praised the chemistry between Arizona and Callie in contrast , comparing it to that between the show 's primary couple Grey and Derek Shepherd ( Patrick Dempsey ) , and stating : " They have that little thing that makes you want to watch them . " In " An Honest Mistake " , Torres was initially rejected by Robbins , with Robbins citing Torres ' " inexperience " as a factor . Series writer Peter Nowalk offered the insight : 
 The couple ultimately decided to begin a relationship , however , the two experience difficulties , but eventually reunite . Rhimes commented on their reconciliation : " I love [ Callie ] with Arizona . [ ... ] I like that they make me feel hopeful about love . " Rhimes has mentioned of their relationship in the sixth season : " I would like to see Callie happily in a long @-@ term relationship . We have so much to explore with them , because we barely know anything about [ Arizona ] . "

 Maureen Ryan from the Chicago Tribune was critical about the character 's initial development . Reviewing the third season 's premiere , she wrote the writers should give up on Callie explaining they have made her " far too obviously the “ weird girl , ” but there ’ s nothing underneath her brusque persona . " Her marriage to O 'Malley was well received ; Staci Krause of IGN wrote : " Their relationship has been a roller coaster and it was nice to see this turn of events , as she really is a perfect contrast to George . " Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Hahn , Williams was largely positive , assessing that : " The story line offered both the drama Grey 's is known for and a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships . " Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss , invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey 's Anatomy producers on the storyline , praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved , though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan . Weiss commented : " I just felt like , if they really cared about each other , I don 't think they would do that as a stunt . That seemed a little , I don 't know , forced . [ ... ] [ It ] was more like a conquest , like he could have [ Hahn ] too or something . " LGBT website AfterEllen.com agreed with this view , criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Sloan 's point of view , as though " privileging the male gaze . " AfterEllen.com included Torres in their list of the Top 50 Lesbian and Bisexual Characters , ranking her at No. 6 and in their Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters . The character was also listed in Wetpaint 's " 10 Hottest TV Doctors on TV " . 
 Commenting on Hahn 's abrupt departure from the show , Dorothy Snarker , writing for AfterEllen.com , observed of Torres and Robbins ' relationship : " I [ ... ] can 't help but be wary of how the Grey 's writers will handle this relationship . Jessica has proven lovely and likable in her brief screen time so far . But it 's not how the romance starts , but what happens next that really matters . " Speaking of the musical episode , Nicole Golden of TV Fanatic called Ramirez 's rendition of " Chasing Cars " " amazing " and referred to her performance in Kate Havnevik 's " Grace " as " beautiful " . Margaret Lyons of New York Magazine was happy with the evolution of Bailey and Torres ' friendship in the first half of the ninth season , calling it " the one bright spot " : " They joke , they tease each other , they offer sage love advice to one another , now that they 're both on their second marriages . " Ramirez was nominated for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Television Series at the Alma Awards , in 2007 and 2008 . Also in 2007 , at the 13th Screen Actors Guild Awards , Ramirez and the cast of Grey 's Anatomy , were the recipients of the Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series .

 = Bugun liocichla = 
 The Bugun liocichla ( Liocichla <unk> ) is a passerine bird species from the <unk> family closely related to the Emei Shan liocichla . First spotted in 1995 in Arunachal Pradesh , India , it was described as a new species in 2006 . The description was made without the collection of a type specimen as they were too few to risk killing one . It is thought to be an endangered species , with the only known population estimated to consist of 14 individuals and commercial development threatening the habitat of this population . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Bugun liocichla is a small babbler ( 22 cm ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) ) with olive @-@ grey plumage and a black cap . The face is marked with prominent orange @-@ yellow lores , and the wings have yellow , red and white patches . The tail is black with crimson coloured undertail coverts and red tips . The feet are pink and the bill is black at the face fading to pale white . A second duller individual was mist netted , which was probably the female . The voice is described as <unk> and distinctive . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 All sightings of the species have been at an altitude of 2 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) on disturbed hillsides covered with shrubs and small trees , with the exception of one sighting on the edge of primary forest . It lives in a territory similar to that of the Emei Shan liocichla . Small flocks were observed during January , whereas pairs were observed in May , with an estimated total of 14 individuals . It is thought that pairs may hold and defend territories . The Bugun liocichla is only currently known from just one location . Populations may be discovered in other areas of Arunachal Pradesh or neighbouring Bhutan . 
 Attempts have been made to identify new locations where the species could occur based on identification of suitable habitats using computational models . 
 = = Species discovery = = 
 The species was described in 2006 after being discovered in <unk> Wildlife Sanctuary in Arunachal Pradesh , India , by an astrophysicist , Ramana <unk> . The species was first spotted in the sanctuary in 1995 but was not seen again for ten years . <unk> spotted them again in January 2005 but did not publicize it until he was able to confirm it to be a new species . It was initially identified as appearing most similar to an Emei Shan liocichla , Liocichla <unk> , a species of Liocichla endemic to China . It was however distinctly different and the full description was finally made by capturing and examining two individuals using <unk> , in May 2006 . Due to the apparent rarity of the species no type specimen was collected , instead feathers from the mist net , photographs , recordings and notes were used as the holotype . The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature does not allow for new species to be described without the collection of type specimens , but this provision was circumvented in this case by the collection of feathers ( the Code allows for " any part of an animal " to be treated as a type specimen ; Art. 72 @.@ 5 @.@ 1 ) . The 1991 description of the <unk> Burti <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , an African <unk> species later considered invalid , lacked a specimen and only blood samples were collected and has been more controversial . 
 The first report of the species was first made in a posting to the <unk> @-@ India , an electronic mailing list in 1996 . It was only in 2006 , however that the species was formally described .

 For a " spectacular bird " with distinctive calls to have been overlooked until 1995 suggests that the species is not common . Only three breeding pairs are currently known and is listed as critically endangered . While the species is capable of living in degraded forests , its small population is considered threatened , especially in the light of plans to build a highway through an area thought to be its primary habitat . 
 = New York State Route 418 = 
 New York State Route 418 ( NY 418 ) is a 3 @.@ 50 @-@ mile ( 5 @.@ 63 km ) state highway located entirely within the Adirondack Park in Warren County , New York , in the United States . The route begins just west of the hamlet of Thurman Station , where Athol Road changes designations from County Route 4 ( CR 4 ) to NY 418 . It heads eastward through the towns of Thurman and Warrensburg , following the Schroon River to an intersection with U.S. Route 9 ( US 9 ) in the hamlet of Warrensburg . All of NY 418 is part of the Dude Ranch Trail , a New York State Scenic Byway that runs through Warren County and Saratoga County . 
 The origins of NY 418 date back to the 19th century when Thurman Station and Warrensburg were first connected by way of a road . This highway was reconstructed by the state of New York during the early 1910s and added to the state highway system in 1915 . It was designated as NY 418 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . The highway has remained mainly unchanged since , save for the replacement of its bridges over the Schroon and the Hudson Rivers in the 1930s and 1940s , respectively . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 418 begins just southwest of Thurman Station , a hamlet within the town of Thurman , where Athol Road shifts from county maintenance ( as CR 4 ) to state maintenance ( as NY 418 ) . It heads northeastward along the base of Sugarloaf Mountain , one of the Three Sisters Mountains , as it passes an area with very little development . The route continues along a northeasterly trek to Thurman Station , where it intersects with River Road in the center of the isolated community . At this point , the route turns southeastward and crosses the Upper Hudson River Railroad at @-@ grade before passing over the Hudson River on the Thurman Station Bridge . NY 418 passes into the town of Warrensburg at the midpoint of the bridge . 
 On the opposite riverbank , the route turns eastward to follow the eastern bank of the Schroon River through an undeveloped portion of Warrensburg comprising little more than forests . The route winds along the bank of river to the hamlet of Warrensburg , where the route becomes River Street and heads past several blocks of houses . At Alden Avenue , the route curves to the northeast , mirroring the curvature of the river through Warrensburg . It continues along the waterway to the junction of Ridge and River Streets , where NY 418 turns north onto Richards Avenue and finally crosses the river on a truss bridge . The route meets Water Street ( CR 9 ) on the opposite bank before continuing northward past several commercial properties to the center of Warrensburg , where NY 418 ends at an intersection with US 9 ( Main Street ) . 
 = = History = = 
 The origins of NY 418 date back to 1896 , by which time a road had been constructed between Thurman Station and Warrensburg . In 1912 , the state of New York solicited bids for a project to improve the road to state highway standards . On June 12 , 1912 , the contract for the project was awarded to the Joseph Walker Construction Company of Albany for $ 35 @,@ 776 ( equivalent to $ 877 @,@ 252 in 2016 ) . About $ 3 @,@ 400 worth of upgrades were made to the highway before the contract was cancelled . The state <unk> bids for the project in February 1914 and let a $ 35 @,@ 231 ( equivalent to $ 832 @,@ 318 in 2016 ) contract for the project on February 20 , 1914 . The highway was rebuilt as a stone highway bound by asphalt . The upgraded highway was accepted into the state highway system on January 8 , 1915 . 
 The Thurman Station – Warrensburg state highway was designated as NY 418 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . NY 418 's alignment has not been substantially altered since that time ; however , parts of the route have been upgraded since 1930 . In 1933 , the original bridge that carried NY 418 over the Schroon River in Warrensburg was replaced with a new truss bridge 50 @.@ 3 meters ( 165 ft ) in length . The route 's original bridge over the Hudson River near Thurman Station was replaced in 1941 with the Thurman Station Bridge , another truss bridge 133 @.@ 5 meters ( 438 ft ) long . The bridges were reconstructed by the New York State Department of Transportation in 2000 and 1995 , respectively . 
 Parts of NY 418 run through a proposed tourism district known as the First Wilderness Heritage Corridor . The corridor , conceived by Warren County , is intended to revitalize the Hudson River corridor by turning it into a tourist destination . Areas currently being studied for future development include the primarily residential and agricultural areas around Thurman Station , the privately owned train station along NY 418 in this same area , and two vacant lots adjacent to the Hudson River on NY 418 . At some point in time , the entire length of NY 418 was included as part of the Dude Ranch Trail , a New York State Scenic Byway that connects Lake George to the Hudson River .

 Beat ' em up ( also known as brawler ) is a video game genre featuring hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat between the protagonist and an improbably large number of opponents . These games typically take place in urban settings and feature crime @-@ fighting and revenge @-@ based plots , though some games may employ historical , sci @-@ fi or fantasy themes . Traditional beat ' em ups take place in scrolling , two @-@ dimensional ( 2D ) levels , though some later games feature more open three @-@ dimensional ( 3D ) environments with yet larger numbers of enemies . These games are noted for their simple gameplay , a source of both critical acclaim and derision . Two @-@ player cooperative gameplay and multiple player characters are also hallmarks of the genre . 
 The first influential beat ' em up was 1984 's Kung @-@ Fu Master , with 1986 's Renegade introducing the urban settings and underworld revenge themes employed extensively by later games . The genre then saw a period of high popularity between the release of Double Dragon in 1987 , which defined the two @-@ player cooperative mode central to classic beat ' em ups , and 1991 's Street Fighter II , which drew gamers towards one @-@ on @-@ one fighting games . Games such as Streets of Rage , Final Fight and Golden Axe are other classics to emerge from this period . The genre has been less popular since the emergence of 3D @-@ based mass @-@ market games , but still some beat ' em ups adapted the simple formula to utilize large @-@ scale 3D environments .
