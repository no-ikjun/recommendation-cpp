 The exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics . The 1912 Olympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi @-@ professional baseball before the Olympics . His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds . Swiss and Austrian skiers boycotted the 1936 Winter Olympics in support of their skiing teachers , who were not allowed to compete because they earned money with their sport and were thus considered professionals . 
 As class structure evolved through the 20th century , the definition of the amateur athlete as an aristocratic gentleman became outdated . The advent of the state @-@ sponsored " full @-@ time amateur athlete " of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur , as it put the self @-@ financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage . Nevertheless , the IOC held to the traditional rules regarding amateurism . Beginning in the 1970s , amateurism requirements were gradually phased out of the Olympic Charter . After the 1988 Games , the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics , subject to the approval of the IFs . As of 2012 , the only sports in which no professionals compete is boxing and wrestling , although even this requires a definition of amateurism based on fight rules rather than on payment , as some boxers and wrestlers receive cash prizes from their National Olympic Committees .

 = = = Boycotts = = = 
 Greece , Australia , France , Great Britain , and Switzerland are the only countries to be represented at every Olympic Games since their inception in 1896 . While countries sometimes miss an Olympics due to a lack of qualified athletes , some choose to boycott a celebration of the Games for various reasons . The Olympic Council of Ireland boycotted the 1936 Berlin Games , because the IOC insisted its team needed to be restricted to the Irish Free State rather than representing the entire island of Ireland . 
 There were three boycotts of the 1956 Melbourne Olympics : the Netherlands , Spain , and Switzerland refused to attend because of the repression of the Hungarian uprising by the Soviet Union , but did send an equestrian delegation to Stockholm ; Cambodia , Egypt , Iraq , and Lebanon boycotted the Games because of the Suez Crisis ; and China ( the " People 's Republic of China " ) boycotted the Games because Taiwan was allowed to compete in the Games as the " Republic of China " . 
 In 1972 and 1976 a large number of African countries threatened the IOC with a boycott to force them to ban South Africa and Rhodesia , because of their segregationist regimes . New Zealand was also one of the African boycott targets , because its national rugby union team had toured apartheid @-@ ruled South Africa . The IOC conceded in the first two cases , but refused to ban New Zealand on the grounds that rugby was not an Olympic sport . Fulfilling their threat , twenty African countries were joined by Guyana and Iraq in a withdrawal from the Montreal Games , after a few of their athletes had already competed . 
 Taiwan also decided to boycott these Games because the People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) exerted pressure on the Montreal organizing committee to keep the delegation from the Republic of China ( ROC ) from competing under that name . The ROC refused a proposed compromise that would have still allowed them to use the ROC flag and anthem as long as the name was changed . Taiwan did not participate again until 1984 , when it returned under the name of Chinese Taipei and with a special flag and anthem . 
 In 1980 and 1984 , the Cold War opponents boycotted each other 's Games . The United States and sixty @-@ four other countries boycotted the Moscow Olympics in 1980 because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . This boycott reduced the number of nations participating to 81 , the lowest number since 1956 . The Soviet Union and 15 other nations countered by boycotting the Los Angeles Olympics of 1984 , contending that they could not guarantee the safety of their athletes . Soviet officials defended their decision to withdraw from the Games by saying that " chauvinistic sentiments and an anti @-@ Soviet hysteria are being whipped up in the United States " . The boycotting nations of the Eastern Bloc staged their own alternate event , the Friendship Games , in July and August . 
 There had been growing calls for boycotts of Chinese goods and the 2008 Olympics in Beijing in protest of China 's human rights record , and in response to Tibetan disturbances . Ultimately , no nation supported a boycott . In August 2008 , the government of Georgia called for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics , set to be held in Sochi , Russia , in response to Russia 's participation in the 2008 South Ossetia war . 
 = = = Politics = = = 
 The Olympic Games have been used as a platform to promote political ideologies almost from its inception . Nazi Germany wished to portray the National Socialist Party as benevolent and peace @-@ loving when they hosted the 1936 Games , though they used the Games to display Aryan superiority . Germany was the most successful nation at the Games , which did much to support their allegations of Aryan supremacy , but notable victories by African American Jesse Owens , who won four gold medals , and Hungarian Jew <unk> Csák , blunted the message . The Soviet Union did not participate until the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki . Instead , starting in 1928 , the Soviets organized an international sports event called <unk> . During the interwar period of the 1920s and 1930s , communist and socialist organizations in several countries , including the United States , attempted to counter what they called the " bourgeois " Olympics with the Workers Olympics . It was not until the 1956 Summer Games that the Soviets emerged as a sporting superpower and , in doing so , took full advantage of the publicity that came with winning at the Olympics . Individual athletes have also used the Olympic stage to promote their own political agenda . At the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City , two American track and field athletes , Tommie Smith and John Carlos , who finished first and third in the 200 meters , performed the Black Power salute on the victory stand . The second @-@ place finisher , Peter Norman of Australia , wore an Olympic Project for human rights badge in support of Smith and Carlos . In response to the protest , IOC president Avery Brundage told the United States Olympic Committee ( USOC ) to either send the two athletes home or withdraw the track and field team . The USOC opted for the former . During the same Olympics , Czechoslovakian gymnast <unk> Čáslavská announced her protest to the Soviet @-@ led invasion of her home country after controversially receiving Silver on the Beam and a shared Gold on the Floor . During the Soviet anthem , Čáslavská turned her head down and to the right of the Soviet flag in order to make a statement over the invasion and the Soviet influence of the sport of Gymnastics . Returning home , Čáslavská was made an outcast by the Soviet government and was banned from competition and travelling . 
 Currently , the government of Iran has taken steps to avoid any competition between its athletes and those from Israel . An Iranian judoka , Arash <unk> , did not compete in a match against an Israeli during the 2004 Summer Olympics . Although he was officially disqualified for being overweight , <unk> was awarded US $ 125 @,@ 000 in prize money by the Iranian government , an amount paid to all Iranian gold medal winners . He was officially cleared of intentionally avoiding the bout , but his receipt of the prize money raised suspicion . 
 = = = Use of performance @-@ enhancing drugs = = = 
 In the early 20th century , many Olympic athletes began using drugs to improve their athletic abilities . For example , in 1904 , Thomas Hicks , a gold medalist in the marathon , was given strychnine by his coach . The only Olympic death linked to performance enhancing occurred at the 1960 Rome games . A Danish cyclist , Knud <unk> Jensen , fell from his bicycle and later died . A coroner 's inquiry found that he was under the influence of amphetamines . By the mid @-@ 1960s , sports federations started to ban the use of performance @-@ enhancing drugs ; in 1967 the IOC followed suit . 
 The first Olympic athlete to test positive for the use of performance @-@ enhancing drugs was Hans @-@ Gunnar <unk> , a Swedish pentathlete at the 1968 Summer Olympics , who lost his bronze medal for alcohol use . One of the most publicized doping @-@ related disqualification occurred after the 1988 Summer Olympics where Canadian sprinter , Ben Johnson ( who won the 100 @-@ metre dash ) tested positive for stanozolol . His gold medal was later stripped and awarded to the American runner @-@ up Carl Lewis , who himself had tested positive for banned substances prior to the Olympics . 
 In 1999 the IOC formed the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency ( WADA ) in an effort to systematize the research and detection of performance @-@ enhancing drugs . There was a sharp increase in positive drug tests at the 2000 Summer Olympics and 2002 Winter Olympics . Several medalists in weightlifting and cross @-@ country skiing were disqualified because of doping offenses . During the 2006 Winter Olympics , only one athlete failed a drug test and had a medal revoked . The IOC @-@ established drug testing regimen ( now known as the Olympic Standard ) has set the worldwide benchmark that other sporting federations attempt to emulate . During the Beijing games , 3 @,@ 667 athletes were tested by the IOC under the auspices of the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency . Both urine and blood tests were used to detect banned substances . Several athletes were barred from competition by their National Olympic Committees prior to the Games ; only three athletes failed drug tests while in competition in Beijing . In London over 6 @,@ 000 Olympic and Paralympic athletes were tested . Prior to the Games 107 athletes tested positive for banned substances and were not allowed to compete . During and after the Games eight athletes tested positive for a banned substance and were suspended , including shot putter <unk> Ostapchuk who was stripped of her gold medal . 
 = = = Sex discrimination = = = 
 Women were first allowed to compete at the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris , but at the 1992 Summer Olympics thirty @-@ five countries were still fielding all @-@ male delegations . This number dropped rapidly over the following years . In 2000 , Bahrain sent two women competitors for the first time : <unk> Hameed <unk> and Mariam Mohamed Hadi Al <unk> . In 2004 , Robina <unk> and Fariba <unk> became the first women to compete for Afghanistan at the Olympics . In 2008 , the United Arab Emirates sent female athletes ( <unk> Al Maktoum competed in taekwondo , and <unk> Al Maktoum in equestrian ) to the Olympic Games for the first time . Both athletes were from Dubai 's ruling family . 
 By 2010 , only three countries had never sent female athletes to the Games : Brunei , Saudi Arabia , and Qatar . Brunei had taken part in only three celebrations of the Games , sending a single athlete on each occasion , but Saudi Arabia and Qatar had been competing regularly with all @-@ male teams . In 2010 , the International Olympic Committee announced it would " press " these countries to enable and facilitate the participation of women for the 2012 Summer Olympics . Anita <unk> , chair of the IOC 's Women and Sports Commission , suggested that countries be barred if they prevented women from competing . Shortly thereafter , the Qatar Olympic Committee announced that it " hoped to send up to four female athletes in shooting and fencing " to the 2012 Summer Games in London . 
 In 2008 , Ali Al @-@ Ahmed , director of the Institute for Gulf Affairs , likewise called for Saudi Arabia to be barred from the Games , describing its ban on women athletes as a violation of the International Olympic Committee charter . He noted : " For the last 15 years , many international nongovernmental organizations worldwide have been trying to lobby the IOC for better enforcement of its own laws banning gender discrimination . [ ... ] While their efforts did result in increasing numbers of women Olympians , the IOC has been reluctant to take a strong position and threaten the discriminating countries with suspension or expulsion . " In July 2010 , The Independent reported : " Pressure is growing on the International Olympic Committee to kick out Saudi Arabia , who are likely to be the only major nation not to include women in their Olympic team for 2012 . [ ... ] Should Saudi Arabia [ ... ] send a male @-@ only team to London , we understand they will face protests from equal rights and women 's groups which threaten to disrupt the Games " . 
 At the 2012 Olympic Games in London , Great Britain , for the first time in Olympic history , every country competing included female athletes . Saudi Arabia included two female athletes in its delegation ; Qatar , four ; and Brunei , one ( Maziah <unk> , in the 400m hurdles ) . Qatar made one of its first female Olympians , <unk> al @-@ Hamad ( shooting ) , its flagbearer at the 2012 Games , and runner Maryam Yusuf Jamal of Bahrain became the first Gulf female athlete to win a medal when she won a bronze for her showing in the 1500 m race . 
 The only sport on the Olympic programme that features men and women competing together is the equestrian disciplines . There is no " Women 's Eventing " , or ' Men 's Dressage ' . As of 2008 , there were still more medal events for men than women . With the addition of women 's boxing to the program in the 2012 Summer Olympics , however , female athletes were able to compete in all the same sports as men . In the winter Olympics , women are still unable to compete in the Nordic Combined . There are currently two Olympic events in which male athletes may not compete : synchronized swimming and rhythmic gymnastics . 
 = = = Terrorism and violence = = = 
 Three Olympiads had to pass without a celebration of the Games because of war : the 1916 Games were cancelled because of World War I , and the summer and winter games of 1940 and 1944 were cancelled because of World War II . The Russo @-@ Georgian War between Georgia and Russia erupted on the opening day of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing . Both President Bush and Prime Minister Putin were attending the Olympics at that time and spoke together about the conflict at a luncheon hosted by Chinese president Hu Jintao . When Nino <unk> of Georgia won the bronze medal in the 10 metre air pistol competition , she stood on the medal podium with Natalia <unk> , a Russian shooter who had won the silver . In what became a much @-@ publicized event from the Beijing Games , <unk> and <unk> embraced on the podium after the ceremony had ended . 
 Terrorism most directly affected the Olympic Games in 1972 . When the Summer Games were held in Munich , Germany , eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by the Palestinian terrorist group Black September in what is now known as the Munich massacre . The terrorists killed two of the athletes soon after they had taken them hostage and killed the other nine during a failed liberation attempt . A German police officer and 5 terrorists also perished . 
 Terrorism affected the last two Olympic Games held in the United States . During the Summer Olympics in 1996 in Atlanta , Georgia , a bomb was detonated at the Centennial Olympic Park , which killed two and injured 111 others . The bomb was set by Eric Rudolph , an American domestic terrorist , who is currently serving a life sentence for the bombing . The 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City , Utah , took place just five months after the September 11 attacks , which meant a higher level of security than ever before provided for an Olympic Games . The opening ceremonies of the Games featured symbols of the day 's events . They included the flag that flew at Ground Zero , NYPD officer Daniel Rodríguez singing " God Bless America " , and honor guards of NYPD and FDNY members . The events of that day have made security at the Olympic Games an increasing concern for Olympic planners . 
 = = = Colonialism = = = 
 The Olympic Games have been criticized as upholding ( and in some cases increasing ) the colonial policies and practices of some host nations and cities either in the name of the Olympics by associated parties or directly by official Olympic bodies , such as the International Olympic Committee , host organizing committees and official sponsors . Critics have argued that the Olympics have engaged in or caused : erroneous anthropological and colonial knowledge production ; erasure ; commodification and appropriation of indigenous ceremonies and symbolism ; theft and inappropriate display of indigenous objects ; further encroachment on and support of the theft of indigenous lands ; and neglect and / or intensification of poor social conditions for indigenous peoples . Such practices have been observed at : the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis , Missouri ; the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal , Quebec ; the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary , Alberta ; and the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver , British Columbia . 
 = = Citizenship = = 
 = = = IOC rules for citizenship = = = 
 The Olympic Charter requires that an athlete be a national of the country for which they compete . Dual nationals may compete for either country , as long as three years have passed since the competitor competed for the former country . However , if the NOCs and IF involved agree , then the IOC Executive Board may reduce or cancel this period . This waiting period exists only for athletes who previously competed for one nation and want to compete for another . If an athlete gains a new or second nationality , then they do not need to wait any designated amount of time before participating for the new or second nation . The IOC is only concerned with issues of citizenship and nationality after individual nations have granted citizenship to athletes . 
 = = = Reasons for changing citizenship = = = 
 Athletes will sometimes become citizens of a different nation so they are able to compete in the Olympics . This is often because they are drawn to sponsorships or training facilities in such places as the United States . It could also be because an athlete is unable to qualify from within their original country . The athlete may not qualify because there are already qualified athletes in the athlete 's home country . Between 1992 and 2008 , about fifty athletes emigrated to the United States to compete on the US Olympic team after having previously competed for another nation . 
 = = = Citizenship changes and disputes = = = 
 One of the most famous cases of changing nationality for the Olympics was Zola Budd , a South African runner who emigrated to the United Kingdom because there was an apartheid @-@ era ban on the Olympics in South Africa . Budd was eligible for British citizenship because her grandfather was born in Britain , but British citizens accused the government of expediting the citizenship process for her . 
 Other notable examples include Kenyan runner Bernard Lagat , who became a United States citizen in May 2004 . The Kenyan constitution requires that one renounce their Kenyan citizenship when they become a citizen of another nation . Lagat competed for Kenya in the 2004 Athens Olympics even though he had already become a United States citizen . According to Kenya , he was no longer a Kenyan citizen , jeopardizing his silver medal . Lagat said he started the citizenship process in late 2003 and did not expect to become an American citizen until after the Athens games . Basketball player Becky Hammon was not being considered for the United States Olympic team but wanted to play in an Olympic Games , so she emigrated to Russia , where she already played in a domestic league during the WNBA offseason . Hammon received criticism from some Americans , including the US national team coach , even being called unpatriotic . 
 = = Champions and medalists = = 
 The athletes or teams who place first , second , or third in each event receive medals . The winners receive gold medals , which were solid gold until 1912 , then made of gilded silver and now gold @-@ plated silver . Every gold medal however must contain at least six grams of pure gold . The runners @-@ up receive silver medals and the third @-@ place athletes are awarded bronze medals . In events contested by a single @-@ elimination tournament ( most notably boxing ) , third place might not be determined and both semifinal losers receive bronze medals . At the 1896 Olympics only the first two received a medal ; silver for first and bronze for second . The current three @-@ medal format was introduced at the 1904 Olympics . From 1948 onward athletes placing fourth , fifth , and sixth have received certificates , which became officially known as victory diplomas ; in 1984 victory diplomas for seventh- and eighth @-@ place finishers were added . At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens , the gold , silver , and bronze medal winners were also given olive wreaths . The IOC does not keep statistics of medals won , but National Olympic Committees and the media record medal statistics as a measure of success .

Including continuity from Czechoslovakia , the Czech Republic and Slovakia have also been represented in every edition . 
 = = = Host nations and cities = = = 
 The host city for an Olympic Games is usually chosen seven to eight years ahead of their celebration . The process of selection is carried out in two phases that span a two @-@ year period . The prospective host city applies to its country 's National Olympic Committee ; if more than one city from the same country submits a proposal to its NOC , the national committee typically holds an internal selection , since only one city per NOC can be presented to the International Olympic Committee for consideration . Once the deadline for submission of proposals by the NOCs is reached , the first phase ( Application ) begins with the applicant cities asked to complete a questionnaire regarding several key criteria related to the organization of the Olympic Games . In this form , the applicants must give assurances that they will comply with the Olympic Charter and with any other regulations established by the IOC Executive Committee . The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialized group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant 's project and their potential to host the Games . On the basis of this technical evaluation , the IOC Executive Board selects the applicants that will proceed to the candidature stage . 
 Once the candidate cities are selected , they must submit to the IOC a bigger and more detailed presentation of their project as part of a candidature file . Each city is thoroughly analyzed by an evaluation commission . This commission will also visit the candidate cities , interviewing local officials and inspecting prospective venue sites , and submit a report on its findings one month prior to the IOC 's final decision . During the interview process the candidate city must also guarantee that it will be able to fund the Games . After the work of the evaluation commission , a list of candidates is presented to the General Session of the IOC , which must assemble in a country that does not have a candidate city in the running . The IOC members gathered in the Session have the final vote on the host city . Once elected , the host city bid committee ( together with the NOC of the respective country ) signs a Host City Contract with the IOC , officially becoming an Olympic host nation and host city . 
 By 2016 , the Olympic Games will have been hosted by 44 cities in 23 countries , but by cities outside Europe and North America on only eight occasions . Since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul , South Korea , the Olympics have been held in Asia or Oceania four times , a sharp increase compared to the previous 92 years of modern Olympic history . The 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro will be the first Olympics for a South American country . No bids from countries in Africa have succeeded . 
 The United States has hosted eight Olympic Games , four Summer and four Winter , more than any other nation . The British capital London holds the distinction of hosting three Olympic Games , all Summer , more than any other city . The other nations hosting the Summer Games twice are Germany , Australia , France and Greece . The other cities hosting the Summer Games twice are Los Angeles , Paris and Athens . With the 2020 Summer Olympic Games , Japan and Tokyo , respectively , will hold these statuses . 
 In addition to the United States , nations hosting multiple Winter Games are France with three , while Switzerland , Austria , Norway , Japan , Canada and Italy have hosted twice . Among host cities , Lake Placid , Innsbruck and St. Moritz have played host to the Winter Olympic Games more than once , each holding that honor twice . The most recent Winter Games were held in Sochi in 2014 , Russia 's first Winter Olympics and second Olympics overall .

 = Hurricane Paul ( 2012 ) = 
 Hurricane Paul was a tropical cyclone that threatened the Baja California peninsula during October 2012 . The sixteenth tropical cyclone , tenth hurricane , and fifth major hurricane of the season , Paul originated from a trough of low pressure west of the coastline of Mexico on October 13 . While turning towards the north , the system quickly organized , reaching hurricane status on the afternoon of October 15 . By that afternoon , Paul had reached its peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane wind scale ( SSHWS ) with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) , but began to weaken rapidly thereafter due to land interaction and strong wind shear . Late on October 17 , Paul degenerated into a remnant low . The remnants of Paul later moved ashore along the central Baja California Peninsula 
 Prior to the storm 's arrival in Baja California Sur , hurricane watches and warnings were issued for coastal locations . Hundreds of homes were damaged across the region and damage to infrastructure was significant . Power outages also occurred across the region as a result of Hurricane Paul . A total of 400 homes were destroyed , and 300 others were flooded . Damage totaled $ 15 @.@ 5 million ( 2012 USD ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On September 28 , a tropical wave emerged off the western coast of Africa . Tracking westward , the northern portion of this wave axis led to the formation of Tropical Storm Oscar on October 3 while the southern portion of the wave continued across the central Atlantic . While approaching the Lesser Antilles the following day , the disturbance lost most of its thunderstorm activity and remained poorly organized across the remainder of its trek through the Caribbean Sea and Central America . On October 10 , the wave emerged into the East Pacific basin , at which time the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) began monitoring the system . 
 Characterized with disorganized convection , a broad surface trough formed in association with the wave the same day and environmental conditions were expected to favor gradual development . Initially , upper @-@ level winds were only marginally favorable , and although the thunderstorms remained disorganized , the NHC estimated a 50 % chance for development by early on October 12 . The next day , the system became better defined , and , the NHC noted that the system was on the verge of becoming a tropical cyclone . Although operationally not classified until 2100 UTC on October 13 , a post @-@ season analysis conducted on the system revealed that it attained enough organization to be considered a tropical depression at 1200 UTC , while positioned about 645 mi ( 1040 km ) south @-@ southwest of Cabo San Lucas . 
 Tracking westward around the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge , the depression steadily strengthened , intensifying into Tropical Storm Paul six hours after designation . On October 14 , an upper @-@ level low positioned west of the Baja California peninsula led to a break in the ridge which subsequently caused the tropical cyclone to slow and turn northward . During this change in direction , favorable atmospheric conditions allowed for a quick rate of intensification . Convective bands in association with Paul gained curvature and a central dense overcast feature became visible on satellite imagery . In addition , a series of microwave passes late in evening revealed a nearly closed eyewall . At 0600 UTC on October 15 , Paul was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane on he SSHWS while located approximately 595 mi ( 960 km ) southwest of Cabo San Lucas . Banding features continued to become better defined to the south and east of the center while convection in the eyewall cooled to − 85 ° C ( − 121 ° F ) . The cloud pattern became increasingly symmetrical , and an eye became intermittently visible on satellite imagery later that morning . Following an abrupt increase in satellite intensity estimates , Paul was upgraded to a major hurricane , Category 3 on the SSHWS , the fifth of the season , at 1800 UTC on October 15 . Simultaneously , the hurricane also estimated to have attained its peak intensity of 120 miles per hour ( 195 km / h ) . 
 Upon reaching its peak intensity , the hurricane began to steadily weaken . The cold ring of thunderstorm activity surrounding the eye warmed significantly while the eye became cloud @-@ filled and cool . The circulation became tilted north @-@ northeast with height , likely a byproduct of south @-@ southwesterly wind shear , and the system was downgraded to a Category 2 hurricane at 1200 UTC on October 16 . Accelerating northwestward within deep southwesterly flow , continued unfavorable upper @-@ level winds caused the low @-@ level center to rapidly separate from the convective mass . At 1800 UTC , Paul was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane ; by this time , little deep thunderstorm activity remained near the center . Six hours later , the system was downgraded to a tropical storm while it passed 50 mi ( 80 km ) west of Baja California Sur . The remainder of shower and thunderstorm activity dissipated early on October 17 and Paul was declared a post @-@ tropical cyclone at 0600 UTC . Following declassification , the system moved ashore Baja California Sur near Bahía Asunción while maintaining gale @-@ force winds . Late that evening , the remnant low @-@ level circulation dissipated about 70 mi ( 110 km ) northwest of Punta Eugenia , Mexico .

 When the system first posed a threat to Mexico at 0900 UTC on October 15 , a tropical storm watch was posted for a portion of the central Baja California Peninsula . Six hours later , the watch was upgraded into a tropical storm warning , while tropical storm watches were issued to the north and south of the warning , respectively . At 2100 UTC on October 15 , the tropical storm warnings was upgraded into a hurricane warning , while a tropical storm warning was declared along the eastern side of the peninsula . Early the next day , the tropical storm warning was extended southward , to include the capital of La Paz . On the afternoon of October 16 , when the threat to the area increased , a hurricane warnings was posted for the eastern side of the state . Early the next day , all hurricane warnings were dropped , as Paul had deteriorated into a tropical storm . By 1500 UTC , all watches and warnings had been discontinued . 
 Prior to the arrival of Paul , activities were suspended for small craft in the ports of Cabo San Lucas , La Paz , San Carlos , Maria Magdalena , and Puerto Lopez Mateos . Moreover , all activities were closed in the port of Mazatlan . Twelve municipalities in Sonora were placed under a " green " alert , though this was quickly upgraded to a " yellow " alert , and later into an " orange " alert . A " blue " alert also declared for Colima , Jalisco , and Nayarit . 
 On October 16 , a " yellow " alert ( moderate risk ) was activated for Baja California Sur . State civil protection authorities brought teams from the federal electricity and water commissions to help maintain services during the storm . In addition , the state government opened 143 shelters , including 11 in the towns of Cabo San Lucas , La Paz , Ciudad Constitución , and Loreto , which had a capacity of 30 @,@ 617 persons . Furthermore , 125 cranes and 75 automobiles were mobilized . Statewide , 400 soldiers were deployed . Roughly 500 residents in Comondú were evacuated to shelter .

 During its formative stages , Paul passed near Clarion Island , where winds of 58 mph ( 93 km / h ) and gusts of 77 mph ( 124 km / h ) were recorded . On nearby Socorro Island , 1 @.@ 98 in ( 50 mm ) of rain fell during the storm 's passage . 
 Even though there were no reports of hurricane @-@ force winds onshore the Baja California Peninsula ( the storm weakened to a tropical <unk> when it made its closet approach to the region ) , hurricane @-@ force winds did approach the peninsula , and there were widespread reports of gale @-@ force winds . In Puerto Cortes , peak winds of 51 mph ( 82 km / h ) and gusts up to 72 mph ( 116 km / h ) were observed , as well as a peak rainfall total over 6 @.@ 02 in ( 153 mm ) . Furthermore , a minimum barometric pressure of 973 @.@ 4 millibars ( 28 @.@ 74 inHg ) was observed in Cabo San Lucas . 
 The outer rainbands of the system first brought rains to Baja California Sur on October 15 , resulting in flooding . Around 30 % of Baja California Sur residents were without power at the height of Paul . Across the northern portion of the state , numerous roads were destroyed , especially near Loreto , where flooding caused a 45 ft ( 14 m ) sinkhole to form . In addition , Mexican Federal Highway 11 was damaged in five locations from La Paz to Ciudad Constitucion . In Loreto , significant destruction occurred and many residents were rendered homeless . Two creeks overflowed their banks , destroying several homes . In Mulege , 300 homes were inundated , displacing 60 individuals to shelter . Thirty light poles were downed . The Puerto San Carlos area sustained the worst flooding from the storm , due to a combination of nearly a year 's worth of rainfall and storm surge , which toppled a dike . There , about 400 homes collapsed and around 40 % of the town 's houses received damage , forcing 300 people to seek shelter . In San Ignacio , 30 automobiles were swept away and power was lost to the city . 
 Across the city of La Paz , damage to roads was estimated at MX $ 200 million ( US $ 15 @.@ 5 million ) . In all , approximately 1 @,@ 000 dwellings were damaged in relation to Hurricane Paul ; many other homes across the region were left without electricity and running water . A total of 495 people were taken to shelters , including 93 in Ciudad <unk> and 300 in San Carlos . Overall , 5 @,@ 000 families or 16 @,@ 000 people were directly affected by the hurricane .

 = Camas pocket gopher = 
 The camas pocket gopher ( Thomomys bulbivorus ) , also known as the camas rat or Willamette Valley gopher , is a rodent , the largest member in the genus Thomomys , of the family Geomyidae . First described in 1829 , it is endemic to the Willamette Valley of northwestern Oregon in the United States . The herbivorous gopher forages for vegetable and plant matter , which it collects in large , fur @-@ lined , external cheek pouches . Surplus food is hoarded in an extensive system of underground tunnels . The dull @-@ brown @-@ to @-@ lead @-@ gray coat changes color and texture over the year . The mammal 's characteristically large , protuberant incisors are well adapted for use in tunnel construction , particularly in the hard clay soils of the Willamette Valley . The gophers make chattering sounds with their teeth ; males and females make purring ( or crooning ) sounds when they are together , and the young make twittering sounds . Born toothless , blind and hairless , the young grow rapidly before being weaned at about six weeks of age . 
 Although the camas pocket gopher is fiercely defensive when cornered , it may become tame in captivity . While population trends are generally stable , threats to the species ' survival include urbanization , habitat conversion for agricultural use and active attempts at eradication with trapping and poisons . It is prey for raptors and carnivorous mammals , and host to several parasitic arthropods and worms . Scientists believe that the gopher 's evolutionary history was disrupted when the Missoula Floods washed over the Willamette Valley at the end of the last ice age . The floods almost completely inundated its geographic range , which may have caused a genetic bottleneck as survivors repopulated the region after the waters receded . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 There are six genera of North American pocket gophers : <unk> , Geomys , <unk> , <unk> , Thomomys , and <unk> . The camas pocket gopher is a smooth @-@ toothed pocket gopher of the genus Thomomys , within the pocket @-@ gopher family Geomyidae . The incisors of gophers in the genus Thomomys have characteristically smooth anterior surfaces , while those of Geomys have two deep grooves per tooth and those of <unk> have a single groove . The camas pocket gopher is a member of the subgenus Megascapheus , established in 1903 , at that time for the camas pocket gopher alone . Taxonomists subsequently assigned other gophers to the same subgenus . The name Thomomys derives from the Greek <unk> ( heap ) + μῦς ( mouse ) , probably describing the mounds of excavated soil produced by the burrowing gopher . <unk> translates as " bulb " in Latin , and the word for " devour " is <unk> . Naturalist David Douglas reported that the gopher consumed bulbs of the camas lily , and Vernon Bailey later attributed the lack of camas lilies in areas inhabited by the gopher to the bulbs being eaten . However , naturalist H. M. Wight observed that the gopher ate primarily dandelion greens , and was skeptical that it was a large consumer of bulbs . 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 The taxonomy of the camas pocket gopher and its genus , Thomomys , have a convoluted history . According to a review article published by the American Society of <unk> in 1987 , Johann Friedrich von Brandt was the first to refer to the camas pocket gopher as Thomomys bulbivorus in an 1855 article published by the Imperial Academy of Sciences . In the 1855 article , Brandt refers to <unk> <unk> without the " h " and ending with an " a " . He writes <unk> " ( man <unk> nicht Thomomys ) " . The authors of the 1987 review note that they did not see Brandt 's actual article , but source the textbook The mammals of North America published in 1981 . 
 Early confusion arose from writings by John Richardson between 1828 and 1839 . Although he describes six species in the genus , according to later critics he was unfamiliar with all specimens . Richardson 's descriptions of the animals and the figures in the text were also criticized . His 1829 Fauna <unk> @-@ americana describes a type specimen of camas pocket gopher obtained from the " banks of the Columbia River , Oregon " , the northern limit of the gopher 's geographic range . This was probably Portland , at the confluence of the Willamette and Columbia Rivers , the only place on the Columbia where subsequent specimens have been found . The present location of this initial specimen is uncertain ; reportedly stored at the Hudson Bay Museum , it could not be located in 1915 . When Richardson made his first examination , the specimen was apparently incomplete ; although Joel Asaph Allen wrote in 1893 that it consisted only of the skin , Richardson described the skull and facial features in detail . 
 In Fauna <unk> @-@ americana , Richardson assigns the mammal to the now @-@ defunct genus Diplostoma described by Rafinesque in 1817 . He named it Diplostoma ? <unk> . Illustration @-@ labeling errors in Richardson 's book further confounded subsequent taxonomists ; the plate was labeled Diplostoma douglasii . 
 There is a specimen of a quadruped in the Hudson 's Bay Museum , which Mr David Douglas informs me is the animal known on the banks of the Columbia by the name of the camas @-@ rat , because the bulbous root of the <unk> or Camas plant ( Scilla esculenta ) forms its favourite food . The scull is wanting , and the animal , therefore , cannot be with certainty referred to a genus , but the form of its exterior cheek @-@ pouches leads me to think that it may belong to the <unk> of M Rafinesque @-@ Schmaltz . 
 The confusion around the species ' taxonomy and identification amplified when naturalist Spencer Fullerton Baird interpreted Richardson 's reports . The camas pocket gopher 's large size led Baird to conclude that the animal 's measurements ( reported by Richardson ) were an artifact of its taxidermy preparation . Baird was also apparently in error about the location from which the specimen was taken , attributing the name Thomomys bulbivorus to a set of previously collected specimens later known as the California Gopher . This confusion was echoed by subsequent authors . The article on gophers in the 1879 edition of the American <unk> has an illustration captioned " California Gopher ( Thomomys bulbivorus ) " . The ninth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica ( published during the late 19th century ) mistakenly reports Thomomys bulbivorus as abundant along the central California coast . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Although Baird and Elliott Coues were involved in early assessments of the genus , according to Allen neither ever saw a specimen of the camas pocket gopher ( T. bulbivorus ) . Allen obtained and examined two large adults ( male and female ) collected in Beaverton , Oregon in May 1890 which were considerably larger and darker than previously examined specimens . Skull features and white markings around the mouth and anus also differed . His findings and the specimen @-@ collection location helped identify the camas pocket gopher as a species separate from California gophers . The California specimens were classified by <unk> and Gervais as <unk> bottae , now known as Thomomys bottae ( Botta 's pocket gopher ) . They were found near Monterey , California , over 1 @,@ 000 kilometers ( 620 mi ) south of the now @-@ recognized range of the Camas pocket gopher . 
 The distribution of Elliot 's " great pocket gopher " ( as it was known ) extended along the California coast " north of San Francisco . " James Audubon and John Bachman <unk> the taxonomy on the camas pocket gopher in the late 1800s . They referred it as the " camas rat " . They reclassified the gopher as <unk> borealis . They rejected Diplostoma as a genus , and assigned Diplostoma <unk> as synonymous with P. borealis . They attributed any differences described by Richardson to artifact , from a specimen that was " twisted and disfigured " in preparation . Based on observations of taxidermy specimens in Europe , they suggested that Townsend 's pocket gopher ( Geomys ( Thomomys ) townsendii ) belonged to the same species . In 1875 the camas pocket gopher was reported as a sub @-@ species of the northern pocket gopher ( Thomomys <unk> ) , . During the 1920s H. M. Wight referred to it colloquially as the " Willamette Valley gopher " . 
 = = = Current phylogeny = = = 
 In 2008 , a team of biologists from University of California , Berkeley and Harvard University published multilocus phylogenetic analysis results of the genus Thomomys . The camas pocket gopher was found to be well separated from other taxa in the subgenus Megascapheus . These findings suggested that the camas pocket gopher was a sister to the other taxa in the subgenus , but the relationships between those other animals was less clear . Only one camas pocket gopher was included in this study , which limited the ability to distinguish features such as monophyly . The following cladogram was presented showing the placement of the camas pocket gopher among its closest relatives : 
 Patterns of genetic variation in the camas pocket gopher have been studied . Although there are no subspecies , there is substantial genetic diversity within the species . Its genetic patterns are consistent with limited inbreeding within specific populations . This is similar to patterns described in Botta 's pocket gopher and the southern pocket gopher , both of which are members of the same genus . However , it contrasts with patterns noted in Baird 's pocket gopher and the plains pocket gopher , members of a separate genus , Geomys , which showed a higher degree of inbreeding . 
 The species ' genetic diversity is similar to that of other pocket gophers occupying a larger geographic range and diversity of habitat . Compared to Townsend 's pocket gopher , which is distributed across a much larger area , but less diverse habitat , it is more genetically heterogeneous . Although there is considerable differentiation between separate populations of camas pocket gophers , their genetic variability does not affect the mammal 's appearance . Study of the effects of genetic change over time revealed a pattern affected by a cataclysmic event across the species ' entire geographic area about 13 @,@ 000 years ago . Such an event would cause a population bottleneck , leading to scattered , isolated populations . 
 = = Description = = 
 The camas pocket gopher is , by a small margin , the largest member of its genus ( Thomomys ) . The fur is a dull brown above and dark , leaden gray beneath . There are often patches of white on the chin , throat and around the anus , and it has blackish ear and nose markings . The external ear is a thickened rim of tissue . During the summer , the gopher 's coat is short and coarse ; winter pelage is longer and furrier . The coat of the young is similar to the adult summer coat , but with more sparsely distributed fur ; the abdominal skin may be visible . 
 Like other gophers , it has small eyes and ears and a nearly hairless tail . Its shoulders are broader than its hips . It is <unk> , with five claws on each foot . The claws on its forefeet are longer than those on its hind feet , and its middle claws are longest . The front claws of the camas pocket gopher are short and weak relative to its size . It employs plantigrade locomotion . The male is larger than the female , measuring an average 300 mm ( 12 in ) in length . A large male weighs about 500 g ( 18 oz ) . One male specimen was 321 mm ( 12 @.@ 6 in ) long and weighed 633 @.@ 8 g ( 22 @.@ 36 oz ) . Females are about 271 mm ( 10 @.@ 7 in ) long . The tail measures 90 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) in the male and 81 mm ( 3 @.@ 2 in ) in the female . An adult male 's hind feet measure 40 – 43 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 – 1 @.@ 7 in ) , and an average female 's hind feet measure 39 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) . There are four mammary glands : two in the inguinal region and two in the pectoral region , each supplying a pair of nipples . Morphologically , it most closely resembles Botta 's pocket gopher ; differentiation can be made based on the concavity of the inner surface of the <unk> , small claws , more uniform fur coloring and <unk> groove of the camas pocket gopher . 
 = = = Skull and dentition = = = 
 The skull of the camas pocket gopher is sturdily proportioned . The camas pocket gopher and other smooth @-@ toothed pocket gophers with robust snouts are included in the subgenus Megascapheus . Male skulls measure 52 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) in length across the base and 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) if the incisors are included . The short , wide skull has a relatively short nasal passage . In width , the skull measures 19 mm ( 0 @.@ 75 in ) across the nasal passages , 30 @.@ 5 mm ( 1 @.@ 20 in ) across the <unk> and 36 @.@ 5 mm ( 1 @.@ 44 in ) at the zygomatic arches . The external auditory meatus is broad and open , although the auditory bullae are confined . 
 The dentition of the camas pocket gopher is symmetric , with one set of incisors , one set of premolars , and three sets of molars above and below . This gives a dental formula of 1 @.@ 0 @.@ 1 @.@ 31 @.@ 0 @.@ 1 @.@ 3 , for a total of 20 teeth . The slender incisors are prominent and distinctive , smooth with yellow surface enamel and white tips due to soil abrasion . These distinctive , large , protuberant upper incisors give the gopher a buck @-@ toothed appearance . The lips do not cover the incisors , but close behind them . There are faintly visible grooves on the inner aspect of the upper incisors , which are more pronounced in other members of the genus ( such as the Mazama pocket gopher , T. <unk> ) . The upper molars have an alveolar length of 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) . 
 = = = Cheek pouches = = = 
 Gophers are burrowing rodents of the family Geomyidae , characterized by fur @-@ lined , external cheek pouches used to gather and transport food . The cheek pouches of <unk> such as the camas pocket gopher are controlled by a set of muscles , with a sphincter controlling the opening and closing of the pouch . A pair of muscles attached to the premaxilla pull the pouches forward , and paired retractor muscles pull the pouches back . These retractor muscles extend back and up from the cheek surfaces , forming a band 7 – 10 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) long and about 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) wide attached to <unk> of the latissimus dorsi muscle . 
 = = = Male genitalia = = = 
 Like many mammals the penis of the camas pocket gopher contains a bone , the baculum . Although its baculum was initially reported as smaller than that of other gophers — 1 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 059 in ) high , 1 @.@ 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 071 in ) wide at the base and 8 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 33 in ) long — the examiner did not know if the specimen had reached full maturity . Subsequent reports averaged about 2 @.@ 1 mm ( 0 @.@ 083 in ) high , 2 @.@ 2 mm ( 0 @.@ 087 in ) wide at the base and 10 @.@ 1 mm ( 0 @.@ 40 in ) long . The phallus ' total length averaged 13 @.@ 5 mm ( 0 @.@ 53 in ) , with the glans covering more than half its length . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The camas pocket gopher is found in the Willamette Valley and the drainage areas of the Yamhill River and other tributaries of the Willamette River . Its range extends north from Eugene to Portland and Forest Grove and west to Grand Ronde . A 1920 report of a Pleistocene fossil in Fort Rock , Oregon has been questioned , since it is far outside the species ' current geographic range ; as of 1987 , the specimen could not be located for further evaluation . 
 The clay @-@ rich Willamette Valley soils are hard in the dry season , and the gopher 's protuberant incisors are well adapted to these conditions . Adequate soil drainage and suitable plant food are essential components of the gopher 's ideal habitat . Not typically found in wetland areas ( where its tunnels would flood ) , the species is found in seral communities of grasses and shrubs . They are also established in agricultural fields in the Willamette Valley , including fields of alfalfa , wheat and oats . The species has also been found in areas of ecological disturbance with similar terrain features . 
 On a geologic timescale , the Willamette Valley has been the site of massive floods . During the late Wisconsin glaciation , a series of floods ( known as the Missoula or Bretz Floods ) occurred . The last flood in the series , a massive flood with an estimated 1 @,@ 693 km3 ( 406 cu mi ) of water flowing at a rate of 42 km3 per hour ( 412 million ft3 per second ) over a 40 @-@ hour period , occurred about 13 @,@ 000 years ago . The flood filled the Willamette Valley to a depth of about 122 m ( 400 ft ) , in a near @-@ perfect overlay of the camas pocket gopher 's range . Although the species has been collected above this elevation , such finds are uncommon . A temporary lake , Lake Allison , formed . Although it is assumed that the gopher lived in the valley before the flood , no fossils have been recovered . The Chehalem Mountains , with a peak elevation of 497 m ( 1 @,@ 631 ft ) , probably provided refuge for survivor populations and survivors would have repopulated in isolated pockets when the waters receded . Before and since the floods , the mountains are thought to have limited gene flow between populations . The relatively narrow , sluggish Willamette River does not appear to obstruct genetic flow in gopher populations . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 The gopher has been credited with being one of the most vicious animals known for its size . It has a great deal of courage and fights a man savagely until an opportunity for escape is offered , then it turns and runs as rapidly as possible , attempting to hide from its pursuer . 
 The camas pocket gopher is a mostly solitary herbivore which is active throughout the year and does not hibernate . The gopher spends most of its time excavating tunnels in search of food , and the hard clay soils of the Willamette Valley pose a challenge . Although the gopher 's front claws are too weak to dig through the clay ( particularly during dry seasons ) , its large incisors and strongly protuberant orientation are well @-@ adapted for this purpose . Tunnel systems constructed by the camas pocket gopher can be complex , with some tunnels exceeding 240 m ( 260 yd ) in length . About 90 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) in diameter , the tunnels are up to 0 @.@ 91 m ( 3 @.@ 0 ft ) deep . When soils are damp the gopher constructs ventilation ducts or chimney mounds ( possibly unique to the species ) , to increase ventilation . The chimney mounds rise vertically 15 – 25 cm ( 6 – 10 in ) , are open at the top and are thought to ventilate the burrows in accordance with Bernoulli 's principle . It is not known if adjacent gopher burrowing systems interconnect . Reports differ about whether or not the ranges of the camas pocket gopher and the Mazama pocket gopher overlap ; if so , this refutes the previous belief that Oregon gopher ranges do not overlap . 
 Although the species is primarily fossorial , it occasionally gathers food near the entrance of a tunnel . <unk> seem to be its favorite food , and are also used as nesting material . During breeding season males will enter the tunnels of females , and males and females may make purring ( or cooing ) sounds when they are together . Mothers seem to comfort the young by softly vocalizing , with the young twittering in response . 
 The camas pocket gopher may behave aggressively when on the defensive , with mammalogist Vernon Orlando Bailey describing the species as " morose and savage . " However , it may be easily tamed in captivity ; the female is more readily tamed than the male . Another small rodent endemic to the Willamette Valley , the gray @-@ tailed vole ( Microtus canicaudus ) , also uses camas pocket gopher tunnels . Other mammals sharing the range of the camas pocket gopher ( and , possibly , its tunnels ) include the vagrant shrew , Townsend 's mole , the brush rabbit , the eastern cottontail rabbit , Townsend 's chipmunk , the California ground squirrel , the dusky @-@ footed <unk> , the North American deermouse , the creeping vole , Townsend 's vole , the Pacific jumping mouse , the long @-@ tailed weasel and the striped skunk . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Varying onset times and duration of the camas pocket gopher breeding season have been reported . Early reports suggested an early @-@ April onset , with the season extending through June . Other reports cited " evidently pregnant " females seen in late March . In heavily irrigated areas the breeding season may be longer , extending into early September . About four young are born in a litter , although litters as large as nine have been reported . The blind , hairless , toothless offspring weigh about 6 @.@ 1 g ( 0 @.@ 22 oz ) and are 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) in length . During their first six weeks they will begin to crawl , develop cheek pouches , open their eyes and wean from milk to solid food . The young then weigh about 86 g ( 3 @.@ 0 oz ) and measure 164 mm ( 6 @.@ 5 in ) in length . At weeks 8 , 10 and 17 they will weigh 101 g ( 3 @.@ 6 oz ) , 160 g ( 5 @.@ 6 oz ) and 167 g ( 5 @.@ 9 oz ) . Some reports indicate that more than one litter may be born in a season . Sexual maturity probably develops by the following year 's breeding season . Although males are fully grown by that time , females may continue to increase in size . 
 There is little data on the longevity and mortality of the camas pocket gopher . It is presumably prey for carnivorous mammals , and its bones have been identified in regurgitated pellets of raptors such as the great horned owl . Parasites include mites , lice , fleas , roundworms and flatworms . The species ' tougher skin may protect it from some fleas known to infest Botta 's pocket gopher and the Mazama pocket gopher . Mites known to parasitize the camas pocket gopher include Androlaelaps <unk> and Echinonyssus <unk> . Some authorities report Androlaelaps fahrenholzi as another parasitic mite , but a later publication did not report it . The chewing louse <unk> <unk> has also been reported . 
 Two parasitic worms first discovered in the gastrointestinal tract of camas pocket gophers are the nematode <unk> <unk> and the cestode <unk> <unk> . Other worms include two nematodes and the cestode <unk> horrida . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 Camas pocket gophers cause significant economic losses , so may be treated as an agricultural pest . Crops damaged include clover , alfalfa and vetch . The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing . This can injure the roots and expose them to air , causing them to dry out . Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees . Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption ; potatoes , carrots , parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow . Excavated soil can cover grass and limit <unk> grazing ; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged . An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $ 1 @.@ 5 million annual losses . Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration , enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt . Buried vegetation can also compost , enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits . 
 Proposed methods for controlling gopher populations in agricultural areas include poisoning dandelions , clover , carrots , sweet potatoes and parsnips . Camas pocket gophers are larger than other gophers , so conventional gopher traps may fail to capture them . Toxic baits and <unk> may also fail , since the gophers will sometimes wall off a segment of the burrow . Gophers may also cause local flooding if their tunneling activities damage levees . 
 In an effort to mitigate damage by camas pocket gophers to sensitive habitat , the Oregon Department of Transportation and the Institute for Applied Ecology trap and relocate the animals . At a site south of <unk> , Oregon , the <unk> is working to protect a small but viable population of Kincaid 's lupine ( Lupinus sulphureus ) . This threatened flower is the primary host plant for the endangered Fender 's blue butterfly ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , which is endemic to the Willamette Valley . The gophers are relocated to a nearby location distant from the lupines . 
 = = = Conservation status = = = 
 Citing concerns of urbanization , habitat loss and active attempts at eradication , NatureServe assesses the camas pocket gophers ' conservation status as vulnerable . The conservation status of the camas pocket gopher is classified as " least concern " by the IUCN ( International Union for Conservation of Nature ) Species Programme , with a stable population trend . The IUCN notes that the gopher is common in its range ; studies indicate that populations can recover rapidly after traps are removed from an area , and the species may adapt well to environmental changes . 
 The IUCN and others express concern about degradation of the species ' habitat due to urbanization and agricultural expansion . The total area occupied by the camas pocket gopher is less than 20 @,@ 000 km2 ( 7 @,@ 700 sq mi ) . This area , the Willamette Valley contains 70 percent of Oregon 's human population . Although this range probably contains a few protected areas , many preserves in the valley are primarily waterfowl protection for hunters . Wetland areas are not suited to the camas pocket gopher , since tunnels are flood @-@ prone . In areas better suited to the gopher ( disturbed habitats and pastoral farmland ) , it may be considered a pest and subject to eradication by poisoning and trapping .

 Maia Estianty ( born 27 January 1976 ) , known as Maia Ahmad during her marriage to Dewa 19 frontman Ahmad Dhani , is an Indonesian songwriter , music producer , singer , dancer and actress . 
 Estianty was born in Surabaya , East Java , and showed interest in music at an early age , winning a marching band competition while still in elementary school . She began training as a disc jockey while still in junior high school ; it was around this time that she first met Dhani . After studying at the University of Indonesia , Estianty joined Dewa 19 as a backing vocalist . In 1999 , she and Dhani came up with the idea for the musical duo Ratu . Estianty played the music , while other women – first Pinkan Mambo , then Mulan Jameela – sang . Ratu was highly successful . After the dissolution of the band in 2007 and a bitter divorce in September 2008 , Estianty formed Duo Maia with Mey Chan . She is currently focusing on producing music with her label , Le <unk> .

 Estianty was born in Surabaya , East Java , on 27 January 1976 . She was the fifth of six children born to <unk> Sigit and his wife <unk> . She is the great @-@ granddaughter of Tjokroaminoto , a nationalist Muslim leader and National Hero , through her father 's side . 
 As a child , Estianty often fought with her classmates ; in an interview with the weekly entertainment magazine Tabloid Nova , she recalled that , while at <unk> Gabriel Catholic Elementary School in Surabaya , she once hit a classmate with an object so hard that the classmate began to bleed profusely . She also took up music during this time , leading her marching band to win a national championship ; she also took up the piano . 
 As a student at State Junior High School 1 in Surabaya , Estianty took up modelling ; in 1990 she won the Yess Modelling Competition for Teenagers , which provoked a number of modelling offers . She also began working part @-@ time at a radio station and learned how to be a disc jockey . At a birthday party while in junior high school , a friend introduced her to Ahmad Dhani ; Estianty and Dhani began writing songs for the piano together . Having received good marks in elementary school and junior high school , while in senior high school she began dating , first with a classmate then with Dhani , and her scores dropped drastically . 
 Towards the end of senior high school , Estianty and her father began arguing about her work and poor performance at school . Estianty threatened to move out ; in response , Sigit said he would support her , on the condition she continue her studies at a state university . Estianty enrolled at the University of Indonesia , first in the Dutch literature programme then in the communications programme . During this time she became a backing vocalist for Dhani 's band Dewa 19 ; the two married in the late 1990s . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Estianty and Dhani divorced on September 23 , 2008 . The separation of the couple , who had been married for twelve years and had three sons together , was not amicable ; Estianty filed a police complaint accusing Dhani of abuse , and Dhani refused to give Estianty custody of their children , appealing to the Supreme Court of Indonesia after several lower courts ruled that the children were Estianty 's . In 2011 Dhani was reportedly in a relationship with Mulan and had a child with her , and Dhani gave Estianty visitation rights in 2012 . Maia submitted an appeal to the Supreme Court , because Maia could not easily meet her children . On May 14 , 2013 the Supreme Court decided that the children could choose themselves since the children were considered capable to make a decision . Dhani agreed with it . 
 = = Ratu = = 
 In 1999 Estianty and Dhani agreed to establish a musical duo consisting of a singer and musician , based on concepts pioneered by international bands like Roxette and Savage Garden . Pinkan Mambo , a café singer , was chosen to be the second member of the newly formed group , named Ratu , meaning Queen . After three years of training , Ratu released its first album , Bersama ( Together ) , in 2003 , which was influenced by R & B. Maia wrote seven songs on the album , while Dhani did the other three . The album was a commercial success , selling 250 @,@ 000 copies . 
 Although Mambo and Estianty began work on another album , Mambo withdrew from the group in 2004 after widespread coverage of her being pregnant and unmarried . Maia and Dhani began looking for a replacement . They agreed on Mulan Jameela , a café singer from Bandung who took the stage name Mulan Kwok ; her appointment was announced on 7 April 2005 . That August , Ratu released the album Ratu and Friends in collaboration with numerous other artists . The album , which featured two songs by Ratu , sold more than 400 @,@ 000 copies and was certified double platinum in Indonesia . The title of the single " Teman Tapi Mesra " , often abbreviated TTM and released to promote Ratu and Friends , became widely used to describe those in a physical relationship without an emotional one . 
 The following year Maia garnered a role in the Trans TV @-@ funded comedy programme <unk> , where she was the only non @-@ Sundanese cast member . Also in 2006 , Ratu released <unk> Satu ( Number One ) , with pop @-@ rock influences ; Maia wrote most of the songs . The album was a commercial success ; it sold 200 @,@ 000 copies nationally on the day of its release , a record for a work by a female Indonesian group . However , conflicts between Dhani and Estianty , as well as concerns over Jameela 's payment , led Ratu to disband in 2007 . 
 = = Duo Maia and acting = = 
 Estianty with Mey Chan made Duo Maia . Together they released the album Maia and Friends in 2008 ; the album was in direct competition with Jameela 's album <unk> Tuhan <unk> Sexy ( God 's Sexiest Creature ) . The songs on Maia and Friends were all written by Estianty . It featured duets with artists such as Gita Gutawa , Gigi , and Glenn Fredly . That year she was one of ten women honoured at the Tribute To Women ceremony held by the Antara News Agency ; other honourees included author Ayu Utami and economist Sri <unk> <unk> . 
 Estianty played in Kata Maaf Terakhir ( The Last Apology ) in 2009 as Dania , the ex @-@ wife to whom Darma ( Tio Pakusadewo ) must apologise before he dies . Marcel Thee , writing in The Jakarta Globe , described her acting as well done . That same year she released Sang <unk> ( The Champion ) as part of Duo Maia . In an interview with The Jakarta Post , she explained that she had written the titular song after hearing Queen 's power ballad " We Are the Champions " at a basketball match ; she realised that there were no Indonesian songs which could be used in the same situation . Along with <unk> and Agus <unk> , she was a judge of the Global TV @-@ sponsored musical talent show Dream Girls , which was open exclusively to mothers . 
 In early 2010 Estianty established the recording studio Le <unk> ; several established artists , including Krisdayanti and Julia Perez , signed on quickly . At the time she owned five other business ventures , including a steakhouse , an outsourcing company , and a cafe . Estianty was reported in October 2010 to be working on a cover album which featured works originally sung by Nike <unk> , Hetty <unk> <unk> , and <unk> CB . Later that year she was chosen as Ambassador on Domestic Violence by the Indonesian Ministry for Women 's Issues . Dhani objected to the appointment and threatened to sue the ministry , as he took offence to suggestions that he had abused Estianty .

 = You Don 't Know Jack ( 2011 video game ) = 
 You Don 't Know Jack is the 2011 release of the trivia @-@ based party game series You Don 't Know Jack . The game was developed by Jellyvision Games and published by THQ , and was released in North America on February 8 , 2011 , for Microsoft Windows , Nintendo DS , PlayStation 3 , Wii and Xbox 360 platforms . It is the first title in the series released by Jellyvision after an eight @-@ year hiatus , taking advantage of online connectivity and other features of modern gaming consoles . A single player iOS port was released about two months later , but was later pulled in anticipation of a more robust client based on the Facebook version of the game . 
 The game is structured around a fictional game show <unk> by Cookie Masterson ( voiced by Tom Gottlieb ) , in which the players answer ten multiple @-@ choice questions , and then compete in a final " Jack Attack " round . Answering quickly and correctly earns virtual money to track the players ' scores , while incorrect answers are penalized . As per the game 's motto , " the irreverent trivia party game " , the questions often combine general knowledge with popular culture references and verbal wordplay to determine the correct answer . Unlike the earlier releases which randomly presented questions , the 2011 game provides more than 73 episodes with a predefined set of questions , and with further episodes to be made available as downloadable content which is currently only available on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 through both consoles ' respective online stores . 
 The game , on consoles , supports both offline and online play ( with the exception of the Wii which lacks online multiplayer ) with up to four players , while the Windows and Nintendo DS versions only support two local players and lack features such as online play and access to downloadable content . You Don 't Know Jack was generally well @-@ received , seen as a humorous return to form for the series , though the lack of online play or additional content for the Windows version was criticized . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 You Don 't Know Jack is played out as a fictional trivia game show for one to four players , with the goal to win the most virtual money at the end of the game . Each game uses a pre @-@ defined set of ten questions from over seventy episodes , titled by the name of the show 's fictional sponsor . Most questions are multiple choice , providing one correct and three incorrect answers , along with a short timer that starts once the question has been completely presented . All players play at the same time , entering their choice of answer before the 20 second timer runs out . If a player is correct , they get a base dollar amount plus a bonus defined by how quickly they answered , while if they miss the question , they lose a similar amount of money . Failing to answer does not cost the player any money . 
 Each player in multiplayer games is also given a single opportunity to " screw " another player , forcing them to answer the question in a much shorter time period . If the selected player answers incorrectly or fails to answer the question , they lose money which is gained by the player using the screw . However , if the selected player answers correctly , they gain additional money taken from the player using the screw . 
 The game 's trivia is based on general knowledge from several fields including science , history , and geography , combined with contemporary entertainment , celebrities , and other news items ; the game , as well as the series , is often described as " high culture meets pop culture " . For example , one question asks the players to identify which Jennifer Aniston film title would most likely have been suited for a hypothetical romantic comedy penned by Albert Einstein about the interactions between neutrons and electrons , the answer being " He 's Just Not That Into You " . In addition to the usual questions , each episode typically features a " Dis or Dat " question . This question gives the players seven words or phrases which they have to identify as one of two possible classifications , or in some cases , both . For example , one Dis or Dat series asks the players to identify terms that would be features of a Nexus One phone , <unk> shampoo , or both . In offline play , only one player participates , while other players try to steal by getting it right if the main player gets it wrong . In online play , all players play the Dis Or Dat simultaneously . Players are also urged to look for the " Wrong Answer of the Game " , which is hinted at by the show 's sponsor ; for example , in an episode sponsored by a baby crib company , the answer " Cat 's Cradle " is the Wrong Answer of the Game . Choosing the correct Wrong Answer does not penalize the player but instead rewards them with a large monetary bonus . Other questions are presented in the standard multiple choice format but use recurring concepts , such as questions based on a fortune cookie message , or ones read through Cookie 's ventriloquist dummy incorporating a speech impediment that may make the question harder to understand . 
 After ten questions are completed , the final round of the game is the " Jack Attack " where all players compete against each other . Prior to the round , a brief clue is shown to the players to describe a relationship that they must match , for example " BFF " ( Best friends forever ) . The game then shows one word or phrase , and then cycles through other phrases which the players must match . If players respond to the wrong phrase , they lose money ; only the first player to buzz in at the correct time wins and earns money . After seven such phrases , the total scores are added and the winner is determined . 
 = = Development = = 
 You Don 't Know Jack was developed by Chicago @-@ based company Jellyvision . The You Don 't Know Jack ( YDKJ ) series , though popular in the 1990s during the rise of gaming on personal computers , had not had an official full release since 1998 with YDKJ : The Ride . Though Jellyvision offered some web @-@ based YDKJ games in the interim years , the developers left the gaming market after seeing the rise of home gaming consoles in the early 2000s . Though they had considered adapting the game for consoles , and had produced two titles for the original PlayStation , they could only realize YDKJ games with players at the same keyboard for input . During this time , Jellyvision reinvented itself as Jellyvision Labs , offering its services in business @-@ to @-@ business communication including for tax software from H & R Block and interviews for <unk> . 
 Around 2008 , the company saw that gaming consoles had developed features for connectivity and social play . They also recognized that the market for such trivia games was slim at the time and saw a possible opportunity to revitalize the series . Near this time , Jellyvision Labs was spun out to its own company , Jellyvision Games , LLC , which would later be reincorporated in 2011 as Jellyvision Games , Inc . Harry Gottlieb , the founder of Jellyvision , recognized that many of the same people that worked on the original games were still in the company , and proposed the idea of a new YDKJ title to publishers . After securing THQ as a publisher , full @-@ time development for the game started in February 2010 . Steve Heinrich , the game 's producer , said the development process was " insanely quick " , allowing them to work concurrently on writing , art , sound , and programming , and had the flexibility to make design decisions to keep the game simple and funny . However , the question writing staff found some of the deadlines to be too short , preventing them for doing extensive audience feedback . 
 Jellyvision Games did not want to change much of the older games for the 2011 version . They sought to keep as many of the old game question types , such as the Jack Attack and Dis Or Dat questions , updating the games to support online play . To counterbalance other types that would not be playable on consoles , such as <unk> Questions that required players to type in a phrase , the developers added new features to the game , such as the Wrong Answer of the Game . The developers took advantage of other features of the newer consoles : they were able to use rumble features of console controllers to emphasize the effect of Screwing other players , and wrote several humorous titles for the in @-@ game achievements . 
 Allard Laban of Jellyvision Games noted that compared to 1995 , where the pop culture was " fragmented " , the onset of the Internet and social media made it easier to develop questions for the game . At the same time , with more information and entertainment available , the writers had to be selective about what parts of culture would remain relevant ; an example given by Heinrich was that while questions about Seinfeld were okay , questions about Mad About You were not . Jellyvision Games sought comedy writers , including from local comedy clubs such as Second City and <unk> , narrowing down the pool of applicants from hundreds to six , including Second City comedian Tim <unk> , who had worked on previous iterations of the YDKJ series . A weekly training process was employed to bring the new writers up to speed and review previously written dialog for possible improvements . Heinrich also assured that material was not repeated throughout the game 's script . Heinrich estimates that each question in the game was a result of about two hours of work . 
 The majority of the game 's dialogue is provided by Tom Gottlieb , brother of Harry , who had voiced the emcee " Cookie " Masterson in the earlier games , and had been considered one of the more popular emcees by players . Lacking any professional studio , most of the 100 @-@ 200 hrs of game dialog were recorded in a makeshift soundproofed closet . Tom Gottlieb was also involved in the writing process , as Jellyvision Games credits much of the " Cookie " persona to his own performance of the character . Other sound effects include fake commercials that are heard before and after a game ; some of these include commercials used in previous iterations of the YDKJ series . Prior to each questions , the game includes short musical interstitials with animated numbers to introduce the question via its number . These were designed as to get the music for these stuck in the players ' heads as something they would remember throughout the day ; to avoid making these become too routine , certain episodes featured variations on the interstitial that would be unexpected , keeping players on their toes throughout playing the game . 
 The game was released in North America on February 8 , 2011 . Jellyvision Games has stated they considered further international releases , but these would be too expensive at the present time . The company does not rule out future iterations of the game being released to a wider market based on the success of this title . 
 An initial version of this version of You Don 't Know Jack was released for iOS systems in April 2011 . It featured twenty 10 @-@ question episodes , but was limited to a single @-@ player mode . Jellyvision Games later pulled the application , in anticipation of release of a more robust client for both iOS and Android that will mimic the Facebook application , featuring cross @-@ platform multiplayer between iOS , Android , and Facebook versions , and downloadable episodes from the Facebook game . 
 = = Reception = = 
 You Don 't Know Jack was positively received by critics who were delighted not only with a new entry in the series , but one that kept the same humor and wit as the earlier games . Seth Schiesel of The New York Times praised the " triumphant , hilarious and even enlightening return " of the series , citing the creativity of the writing and voice work . John Teti of The A.V. Club called the title an " astonishingly good game " , and was impressed that the writing of the game was as witty as the previous games in the series despite the years of dormancy . Though Teti lamented about the lack of keyboard @-@ bases questions , he praised the new question types and gameplay as the overall change " minimizes blowouts and keeps the pace brisk " . Greg Miller of IGN considered the game a great value , attributing it to the game 's " great sense of humor , clever rounds and enough questions to keep you busy for a while " . 
 Kevin Kelly of G4 TV praised the voice work , particularly that for " Cookie " , as " Without Cookie , this game would quickly be just another forgettable trivia game " . Jeff Cork of Game Informer considered the game " proof that games don ’ t need to be excessively complex in order to be fun " , complimenting the " top @-@ notch " writing . Chris Watters of Gamespot commented that the structure of each episode can become repetitive , and that commonly the Jack Attack round would decide the winner of the game , negating the previous questions , but still considered the " large amount of legitimately clever and surprisingly funny writing " a key aspect of making You Don 't Know Jack as " one of the most entertaining trivia games on the market " . Gamepro 's Nathan Grayson was more critical of the game 's lack of features , considering the number of questions " painfully short " compared to the Buzz ! trivia game series , the " absolute bare @-@ bones basics " presentation , and the game 's somewhat juvenile sense of humor . Though the Toronto Sun 's Steve Tilley generally praised the game 's humor , he noted the lack of variety of gameplay modes , and that playing with people online may be spoiled by those that had already run through all the game 's episodes . 
 Both the Microsoft Windows and Nintendo DS versions were criticized for limiting the number of players to two . The Windows version was particularly criticized as it did not allow for online play , a feature available on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 releases , nor would receive the downloadable content for the game . The lack of multiplayer in the pulled iOS version was lamented though the other facets of the game 's humor remained .

 " A Star Is Burns " is the eighteenth episode of The Simpsons ' sixth season . It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 5 , 1995 . In the episode , Springfield decides to hold a film festival , and famed critic Jay Sherman is invited to be a judge . Homer , feeling that Marge does not respect him , asks that he be put on the jury panel and ends up voting for the stupidest movie . 
 The story involves a crossover with the short @-@ lived animated series The Critic . Jay Sherman was the main character on the show . The Critic was created by Al Jean and Mike Reiss , who had previously written for The Simpsons but left following the fourth season , and produced by James L. Brooks , who was also a producer for The Simpsons . The show had premiered on the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) network in January 1994 but was canceled despite positive critical reception . The series was switched over to Fox , and put in the timeslot directly after The Simpsons . Brooks pitched a crossover episode as a way to promote The Critic and decided that a film festival would be a good way to introduce Sherman . 
 Matt Groening , creator of The Simpsons , reacted negatively when he heard about this episode , feeling that it was just an advertisement for The Critic , and that people would incorrectly associate the show with him . When he was unsuccessful in getting the program pulled , he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns , openly criticizing James L. Brooks and saying the episode " violates the Simpsons ' universe . " In response , Brooks said " I am furious with Matt , [ ... ] he 's allowed his opinion , but airing this publicly in the press is going too far . [ ... ] his behavior right now is rotten . " 
 The episode was directed by Susie Dietter and was the first episode to be written by Ken Keeler . Jon Lovitz , the star of The Critic , guest stars as Jay Sherman , while Maurice LaMarche ( who was also a regular on The Critic ) has a few minor roles . Sherman later became an infrequently recurring character on The Simpsons . The episode received mixed reviews from critics , many of whom felt the crossover was out of place on the show although Barney 's film festival entry was well received . 
 = = Plot = = 
 News anchor Kent Brockman reports that Springfield is the least cultural city in the United States . In response , a town meeting is held to decide a course of action , where Marge proposes that Springfield host a film festival showcasing films made by the townspeople . Marge is made the head of the festival 's judging panel , and invites New York film critic Jay Sherman to be a special guest critic . Upon his arrival , Jay stays with the Simpson family , which becomes problematic as his popularity with the family makes Homer feel inadequate and overshadowed . Homer fears that nobody respects his intelligence by voicing his concerns . Marge tries to convince him that everyone does respect him , but his crude behaviour is the only thing they do not respect . Unconvinced by it , Homer persuades Marge to put him on the festival 's judging panel to try to prove himself to others that he is more than unintelligent . Meanwhile , when Mr. Burns learns that his profits have dropped due to his bad image , Waylon Smithers informs him of the film festival . Burns decides that an epic biographical film will endear him to the people , so he hires Steven Spielberg 's " non @-@ union , Mexican equivalent , " Señor <unk> to direct and deciding to play himself in the film after the auditions to have an actor portray him fail screen test . 
 The film festival commences at the Aztec Theatre , with entries including Apu Nahasapeemapetilon 's Bright Lights , Beef Jerky ( security footage from the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart ) , Moe Szyslak 's musical number , Moe Better Booze ( little more than a song @-@ and @-@ dance advertisement for Moe 's Tavern ) , Bart 's The Eternal Struggle ( a home video of Homer attempting to squeeze into a pair of undersized pants ) , Ned Flanders ' film about Moses ( in which Todd , playing baby Moses , is dragged down a river until God saves him ) , and Hans Moleman 's , Man Getting Hit by Football , which only features Moleman getting hit in the groin by a football . Moleman 's movie makes Homer laugh , but Marge is displeased with him when she hears him announce that he should get the grand prize . Jay reminds Homer that he cannot quickly judge on one movie . Festival attendees are particularly touched by Barney Gumble 's artistic introspective film about alcoholism , Pukahontas , which Jay ( later a victim of football in the groin ) foresees to be the eventual winner . Burns ' film , A Burns for All Seasons , is screened last , and is met with a negative audience reaction . The audience jeers at Mr. Burns for it , because it is nothing more than ego driven and poorly made to try to portray him in a more positive light . 
 In the judge 's room , Jay and Marge vote for Barney 's film , while Mayor Quimby and Krusty the Clown vote for Burns ' movie after many bribes and also due to being ego @-@ driven themselves . Left with the tie @-@ breaking vote , Homer quickly and enthusiastically votes for Man Getting Hit by Football . Marge confronts him for voting for the worst movie , even after he joined the judging panel . Homer tries to defend himself , but Jay points out there is more to life than seeing someone being hit with a football . Finally convinced to change his vote , Homer asks Marge to let him view the films again in private and she agrees . Later on , he views Pukahontas again while reflecting on the two films ' qualities . Eventually , Homer sees the soul of Barney 's film and makes his decision . At the awards ceremony , Jay announces that Barney is the grand prize winner , and Marge is proud of Homer for voting for the right film . During his acceptance speech Barney announces he 's giving up drinking , but immediately relapses when he discovers his prize is a one year 's supply of Duff beer . 
 Flashing forward six months , Burns is at the Academy Awards , where despite having bribed everyone in Hollywood , he loses out on an Oscar to George C. Scott in a remake of Man Getting Hit by Football . Marge laments that now is the time that Mr. Burns learn his lesson that he should not bribe everyone .

 The Critic was a short @-@ lived animated series that revolved around the life of movie critic Jay Sherman . It was created by Al Jean and Mike Reiss , who had previously written for The Simpsons but left after the fourth season , and executive produced by James L. Brooks . Jon Lovitz ( who had previously guest starred in several episodes of The Simpsons ) starred as Jay Sherman , and it also featured the voices of The Simpsons regulars Nancy Cartwright , Doris Grau and Russi Taylor . It was first broadcast on ABC in January 1994 and was well received by critics , but did not catch on with viewers and was put on hiatus after six weeks . It returned in June 1994 and completed airing its initial production run . 
 For the second season of The Critic , James L. Brooks cut a deal with the Fox network to have the series switch over . The episode was pitched by Brooks , who had wanted a crossover that would help launch The Critic on Fox , and he thought having a film festival in Springfield would be a good way to introduce Sherman . After Brooks pitched the episode , the script was written by Ken Keeler . Although David Mirkin was executive producer for most of the sixth season , the episode was executive produced by Al Jean and Mike Reiss . Jay Sherman 's appearance was <unk> : he was made yellow and given an overbite . 
 The episode contains a meta @-@ reference to the fact that it is a crossover episode in a conversation Bart has with Sherman : 
 [ Bart is watching television ] Announcer : Coming up next , The Flintstones meet The Jetsons . 
 Bart : Uh oh . I smell another cheap cartoon crossover . 
 [ Homer enters the room with Jay ] Homer : Bart Simpson , meet Jay Sherman , the critic . 
 Jay : Hello . 
 Bart : Hey man , I really love your show . I think all kids should watch it ! [ turns away ] <unk> , I suddenly feel so dirty . 
 The joke was pitched by Al Jean . 
 Alongside Jon Lovitz , the episode guest stars Maurice LaMarche , a regular on The Critic , who voices George C. Scott as well as Jay Sherman 's belch . Phil Hartman also makes a brief appearance as Charlton Heston . Rainier Wolfcastle 's line " on closer inspection , these are loafers " was ad @-@ libbed by Dan Castellaneta who was providing the voice of the character on a temporary track . It was later re @-@ recorded by Wolfcastle 's normal voice actor , Harry Shearer . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The Imperial March from The Empire Strikes Back is played as Mr. Burns is introduced . The song the " Rappin ' Rabbis " play in the opening moments of the episode is a parody of " U Can 't Touch This " by MC Hammer . The opening of Bart 's film The Eternal Struggle is a reference to The Amazing Criswell 's narration in Plan 9 from Outer Space . Barney 's film contains references to Koyaanisqatsi , and the music of the film , which was composed by Philip Glass . Barney 's film also features musical selections from the aria " Un bel di <unk> " from Act II , pt . 1 of Puccini 's opera " Madama Butterfly " .

 In its original American broadcast , " A Star Is Burns " finished 57th in the ratings for the week of February 27 to March 5 , 1995 . The episode was the third highest rated show on the Fox network that week , beaten only by Melrose Place and Beverly Hills , 90210 . The Critic finished 64th . On March 12 , 2002 , the episode was released in the United States on a DVD collection titled The Simpsons Film Festival , along with the season eleven episode " Beyond Blunderdome " , the season four episode " Itchy & Scratchy : The Movie " , and the season seven episode " 22 Short Films About Springfield " . 
 The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , wrote , " Jay Sherman perhaps proves here , even more so than in The Critic , just why that show failed . He 's too flawed to be likeable . " They added , " Barney 's film is magnificent , but it 's easy to see why Homer wants Hans Moleman to be the winner . " Adam Finley of TV Squad wrote " the episode , even if I didn 't care for it as a whole , does have moments that are still very Simpson @-@ y , and still very funny . Jay 's appearance , however , casts a shadow over everything that tends to leave a bad taste in my mouth . " Todd Gilchrist of IGN listed Barney 's film as one of the best moments of the sixth season . 
 The A.V. Club named Hans Moleman 's line " I was saying ' Boo @-@ urns ' " , and Mr Burns ' " Then get me his non @-@ union , Mexican equivalent ! " as two quotations from The Simpsons that can be used in everyday situations . IGN ranked Jon Lovitz as the eighth best guest star in the show 's history . 
 = = = Controversy = = = 
 Matt Groening , creator of The Simpsons , was a critic of the episode when it was first released . He felt that the crossover was a thirty @-@ minute advertisement and blamed James L. Brooks , calling it an attempt to get attention for one of his unsuccessful shows . After he was unable to get the episode pulled , he decided to go public with his concerns shortly before the episode aired . He stated that his reasons for doing so were that he hoped Brooks would have a change of heart and pull the episode , and that " articles began to appear in several newspapers around the country saying that [ Groening ] created ' The Critic . ' " Groening had his name removed from the credits , so he does not receive his normal " created by " and " developed by " credits that air at the end of the opening sequence . 
 In response , James L. Brooks said " I am furious with Matt , he 's been going to everybody who wears a suit at Fox and complaining about this . When he voiced his concerns about how to draw The Critic into the Simpsons ' universe he was right and we agreed to his changes . Certainly he 's allowed his opinion , but airing this publicly in the press is going too far . [ ... ] He is a gifted , adorable , cuddly ingrate . But his behavior right now is rotten . " 
 Al Jean and Mike Reiss , creators of The Critic , had previously worked on The Simpsons and had executive produced the third and fourth seasons . Brooks said , " for years , Al and Mike were two guys who worked their hearts out on this show , staying up until 4 in the morning to get it right . The point is , Matt 's name has been on Mike 's and Al 's scripts and he has taken plenty of credit for a lot of their great work . In fact , he is the direct beneficiary of their work . The Critic is their shot and he should be giving them his support . " Reiss stated that he was a " little upset " by Groening 's actions and that " this taints everything at the last minute . [ ... ] This episode doesn 't say ' Watch The Critic ' all over it . " Jean added " What bothers me about all of this , is that now people may get the impression that this Simpsons episode is less than good . It stands on its own even if The Critic never existed . " 
 Groening was criticized for going public with his complaints . Ray Richmond of the Los Angeles Daily News wrote " who 's right ? Well , Groening is probably correct in judging this an integrity issue . It 's a fairly tacky bit of promotion , the kind generally beneath The Simpsons . But it 's also true that little is accomplished by taking a gripe like this public . Quietly erasing his name from the credits would have been sufficient . [ ... ] I admire the man 's standing up for his creative rights . But I question the way he 's gone about it . " 
 As a result , Groening was absent from the episode 's commentary for The Complete Sixth Season DVD boxset .

 In the end , The Critic was short @-@ lived , broadcasting ten episodes on Fox before its cancellation . A total of only 23 episodes were produced , and it returned briefly in 2000 with a series of ten internet broadcast webisodes . The series has since developed a cult following thanks to reruns on Comedy Central and its complete series release on DVD . 
 Jay Sherman has since become an infrequently recurring character on The Simpsons , appearing in speaking roles in " Hurricane Neddy " and " The Ziff Who Came to Dinner . " 
 = No Mercy ( 2007 ) = 
 No Mercy ( 2007 ) was a professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) and presented by AT & T , which took place on October 7 , 2007 , at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont , Illinois . It was the 10th annual No Mercy event and starred wrestlers from the Raw , SmackDown ! and ECW brands . 
 Nine professional wrestling matches were scheduled on the event 's card , which featured a supercard , a scheduling of more than one main event . The first main event featured wrestlers from the Raw brand in a Last Man Standing match — a match where the first person unable to respond to a ten count by the referee lost — between WWE Champion Triple H and Randy Orton . Orton won the match and became the WWE Champion . The other main event featured wrestlers from the SmackDown ! brand , in which defending World Heavyweight Champion Batista defeated challenger The Great Khali in a match in which a large wooden structure known as a Punjabi Prison surrounded the ring . Two featured bouts were scheduled on the undercard . In a standard wrestling match between wrestlers from the Raw brand , WWE Champion Triple H defeated Umaga to retain his title . The other was a standard match between wrestlers from the SmackDown ! brand in which Finlay and Rey Mysterio fought to a no contest . 
 The 2007 No Mercy event had an approximate attendance of 12 @,@ 500 and received approximately 271 @,@ 000 pay @-@ per @-@ view buys . This event helped WWE obtain a pay @-@ per @-@ view revenue of $ 19 @.@ 9 million . When the event was released on DVD , it reached a peak position of nineteenth on Billboard 's DVD Sales Chart . 
 = = Background = = 
 Eight professional wrestling matches were featured on the event 's card . Matches were planned with predetermined outcomes by WWE 's creative staff and featured wrestlers playing characters for the entertainment of the audience . All wrestlers were from either Raw , SmackDown , or ECW — the three brand divisions to which WWE assigned its employees . 
 The main leading rivalry scripted into the event on the Raw brand was between John Cena and Randy Orton over the WWE Championship . At WWE 's August pay @-@ per @-@ view event SummerSlam , Cena successfully defended the championship against Orton , and the following night on Raw , one of WWE 's primary television programs , Orton interfered in Cena 's match with King Booker and cost him the match . After the match ended , Orton attacked Cena 's real @-@ life father , in storyline , by kicking him in the head . As a result of Orton 's actions , the two met in a championship match at WWE 's September pay @-@ per @-@ view event Unforgiven , in which Cena was disqualified for ignoring the referee 's commands ; as per WWE rules , a title can only change hands via pinfall or submission , Orton was not awarded the title . Following their match , Cena 's father gained revenge on Orton by kicking him in the head the same way Orton had done to him earlier . Later in the night after the event went off the air , authority figure Jonathan Coachman made a rematch between the two at No Mercy in a Last Man Standing match , which involves two competitors fighting until one can not stand up on his feet before the referee counts to ten . On the October 1 episode of Raw , Cena legitimately tore his right pectoral muscle during a match with Mr. Kennedy , though the injury was blamed on television on a post @-@ match attack by Orton . Due to the severity of his injury , Cena was forced to vacate the title . Although Cena 's match against Orton was canceled , World Wrestling Entertainment Chairman Vince McMahon stated that there would be " a new WWE Champion crowned at No Mercy " . 
 The main storyline on the SmackDown ! brand was between Batista and The Great Khali over the World Heavyweight Championship . Their rivalry began in July when Khali issued a challenge to the SmackDown roster , which Batista answered . Khali won the World Heavyweight Championship , he interfered in a match pitting Batista against Kane for the chance to fight Khali at The Great American Bash for the championship , which caused the match to end in a no @-@ contest . As a result of Khali 's actions , Long announced that at The Great American Bash , Khali would defend the championship against Batista and Kane in a Triple Threat match , in which Khali was victorious and retained the championship . At SummerSlam , Batista defeated Khali by disqualification , however , as per WWE rules , he did not win the title . The following month at Unforgiven , Khali faced off against Batista and Rey Mysterio in another Triple Threat match in which Batista pinned Khali to win the championship . The same week on SmackDown ! , Khali announced that his rematch for the World Heavyweight Championship would take place at No Mercy in two giant wooden structures that make up what is known as a Punjabi Prison ; the winner in the match is the first to climb out of the structures . 
 Another staged rivalry was on the ECW brand between CM Punk and Big Daddy V over the ECW Championship . This rivalry began when ECW authority figure Armando Estrada announced an " Elimination Chase to No Mercy " , involving Elijah Burke , Tommy Dreamer , Kevin Thorn , and Stevie Richards . Over a three @-@ week period , Richards , Thorn , and Burke were eliminated , with Dreamer winning the number one contendership . Estrada , however , revealed that Big Daddy V was also a contender , and he quickly defeated Dreamer to earn the chance to fight Punk for the title . 
 The Women 's rivalry on the Raw brand was between Candice Michelle and Beth Phoenix over the WWE Women 's Championship . Shortly after returning to WWE as a villainess , Phoenix won a battle royal to become the # 1 Contender for Candice 's Women 's Championship . Phoenix received her title opportunity at Unforgiven , but she was defeated by Candice .

Batista later used the leather strap and attempted to climb over the first cage structure , but Khali stopped him and squeezed Batista 's head with both hands , known as a Vise Grip . The Great Khali then called for a door to be opened but was stopped from going through when Batista struck him with a low blow .

Triple H followed this by striking Orton with the steel ring steps . The men returned to the ring , and Orton performed a DDT and an RKO on Triple H , both of the moves involved Triple H 's head striking a steel chair .

 = = Overview = = 
 Wonder Boy III : The Dragon 's Trap takes place immediately after the events of Wonder Boy in Monster Land , Wonder Boy travels into the Mecha Dragon 's lair in order to slay him . ( Some sources refer to this creature as the " MEKA dragon " . ) However , upon doing so , he is inflicted by a curse that transforms him into " Lizard @-@ Man " . In the game , the player controls Wonder Boy as he tries to undo this curse by journeying across the land , defeating other dragons , and defeating finally the Vampire Dragon to obtain the Salamander Cross – the only object that can remove his curse . 
 After completing the first level in the game ( a simplified version of the final level from the preceding game Wonder Boy in Monster Land ) , the player begins as Lizard @-@ Man from <unk> , a town in Monster Land , and the gameplay becomes nonlinear . From there , the player explores and finds items and clues needed for Wonder Boy to access different parts of Monster Land . Gold and additional secondary items can be found by defeating enemies and opening treasure chests . With gold , players can buy additional items and better equipment in shops and restore their life meter in hospitals . Shops are normally designated as doors with windows on them , located in town or in caves . Items with question marks displayed cannot be bought unless the player has " charm " , which can be increased by collecting collect Charm Stones or by equipping certain items . The Status Screen shows how much attack and defense power , and charm Wonder Boy has , all of which depend on what items are currently equipped . 
 In the game , the player uses the directional pad to move Wonder Boy left or right , crouch down ( only possible as Hu @-@ Man or Lizard @-@ Man ) , or to enter doors . The buttons on the controller are used to attack enemies and to jump . Wonder Boy can attack with his main weapon or with secondary weapons by holding down on the directional pad and pressing the attack button . Pressing the pause button brings up the Status Screen ( and pauses the game if Wonder Boy is fighting a dragon ) . Wonder Boy has a life meter shown on the top of the gameplay area by a series of hearts , which turn from red to black when taking damage from enemy attacks . When all hearts turn black , Wonder Boy dies and the game ends , but if he has a life potion ( " medicine vial " in Dragon 's Curse ) remaining , he will revive with some of the hearts refilled . After the game ends , the player is taken to a " continue screen " ; there the player has an opportunity to win a free life potion before restarting the game at the town . Players can visit the town 's church to receive a password in order to continue the game at a later time . The password saves the current player 's form , equipment , and amount of gold ; but it does not save any secondary weapons or life potions in stock . Dragon 's Curse has a " file cabinet " which allows players to store passwords into the game 's memory ; the player may access these stored passwords and continue the game without needing to manually input them . 
 Throughout the game , players will go through differently @-@ themed levels : underwater , desert , jungle , cave , and sky . At the end of each level is a different dragon . After defeating a dragon , Wonder Boy changes form , and his abilities change . Wonder Boy begins the game as Hu @-@ Man , equipped with all eight hearts and the strongest equipment . He turns into Lizard @-@ Man after defeating and being cursed by the Mecha Dragon in the first level . At that point , he loses all equipment and all hearts except one . Lizard @-@ Man attacks enemies by breathing fire at them , and he can duck . He can assume other different forms throughout the game : Mouse @-@ Man can walk on walls and ceilings designated by checkered " mouse blocks " , Piranha @-@ Man can swim freely underwater and can access underwater places ( such as the ship ) which the other forms cannot , Lion @-@ Man attacks enemies with his sword by swinging from directly above to directly below him , and Hawk @-@ Man can fly freely in the air but takes damage if he enters water .

 Various UK @-@ based video gaming magazines gave Wonder Boy III : The Dragon 's Trap significant coverage . The Games Machine complimented the game 's colorful backgrounds and sprites with " the [ Wonder ] Boy himself being particularly well @-@ drawn " , while they criticized the weak animation on some of the characters as well as its choppy scrolling . They called it one of the best games by Sega but complained that it was expensive , saying " do you really want to spend 28 quid on it ? " The magazine 's successor , Raze , reviewed the PC Engine version titled Adventure Island . The magazine praised the game 's simplistic and addictive platforming gameplay and its smooth @-@ scrolling graphics , though they said they were " a little blocky " . They noted that the game had excellent music which was " worth listening through some headphones " . Zero , along with praising the game 's graphics and music , called it " enormously addictive " ; the review said the ability to transform into different forms and hence being able to progress into new areas kept the game fresh . 
 UK magazines Computer and Video Games and its spin @-@ off Mean Machines – in the latter 's premiere issue – gave the game positive reviews . Computer and Video Games praised the animation in particular and called it the best game of its type on that platform , using phrases such as " familiar air of polish and ingenuity " and " piles of addiction guaranteed " .

" ; he compared the gameplay to the Mario series of video games and praised the game 's depth , saying that " there 's always something new to discover , be it a key to a previously locked door or even a secret room ! " Julian Rignall praised the game 's graphics and the huge world players can explore , which he says contributes to the game 's addictiveness . He said that " the combination of adventuring , shooting and platform action results in one of the best games of its type available on any console " . Collectively , they praised the game overall presentation and graphics , saying that the sprites complement the background . While they additionally praised its playability for being " accessible from the word go " and longevity , they criticized its sound , saying that it " could have been much better " . 
 German magazine Video Games gave Wonder Boy III : The Dragon 's Trap a positive review , saying that the game gave more weight to strategy and tactics , that it " stands out clearly from the two predecessors " , and that its graphics became less childlike but more " spectacular " .

It complimented the game 's depth and wide array of equipment , saying that it " provides an additional touch , which makes [ it ] the best thought @-@ out game [ at the time ] " . 
 Upon the release of the TurboGrafx @-@ 16 version Dragon 's Curse to the Virtual Console in 2007 , IGN 's Lucas Thomas reviewed the game , comparing the opening sequence of the game to the opening sequence of Castlevania : Symphony of the Night ; he proceeded to add that the game parallels with games in the Castlevania series , calling the game " a straightforward and simple ' Metroidvania ' adventure " but with " several layers of unexpected depth " . Thomas noted the game 's popularity among fans and that it plays almost exactly the same as the Master System version despite graphics and sound improvements ; at the time , there were no Master System games on the Virtual Console . He praised the game 's rich sound , gameplay depth , and " colorful and cartoony " graphics , which " was perfectly suited to the TurboGrafx platform " . 
 IGN 's Travis Fahs , in discussing the SMS version , offered another opinion , praising the game as " not only the crowning achievement of the series , but perhaps one the best games of the 8 @-@ bit era " , drawing comparisons to both Mario and Zelda . Thomas again reviewed the Master System version of Wonder Boy III : The Dragon 's Trap when it was released two years later for the Virtual Console . In this review , he compares the gameplay to Metroid – more specifically the need to gather additional equipment and abilities to advance in the game . While he acknowledged that this version from one of the best Master System games as well as for any 8 @-@ bit system , he felt that the Master System 's Virtual Console release had a reduced appeal . He said that the TurboGrafx @-@ 16 version Dragon 's Curse had already been out for two years and that there was no difference in gameplay between the two versions , but there were improvements in graphics and sound in the TurboGrafx @-@ 16 version because of the system 's superior capabilities . He also noted that the Master System version suffers from sprite flickering – something the TurboGrafx @-@ 16 version did not have . Despite the small differences in the two versions , he decided to give the Master System version the same rating as the TurboGrafx @-@ 16 version . 
 Allgame 's review of the Master System version praised the non @-@ linear gameplay and the ability to change into different forms , saying that it " keeps things interesting and fun " and " keeps the game from getting repetitive " . It lauded its visuals and sound effects , saying the " graphics are very colorful and have a cartoon look to them " . Criticisms included slippery controls and the difficulty of getting into doors ; it said the controls kept the game from obtaining a perfect rating , and the gameplay was still not as good as Wonder Boy in Monster Land . The editing staff from magazine Retro Gamer listed Wonder Boy III : The Dragon 's Trap as one of the " Perfect Ten Games " for the Master System , calling it " the best in a long and highly convoluted myriad of multi @-@ titled games " and " a great adventure that every Master System fan needs to own " . The review praised the game 's brisk pace and gameplay , despite the length of the game .

 = Pennsylvania Route 222 = 
 Pennsylvania Route 222 ( PA 222 ) is a 4 @.@ 482 mi ( 7 @.@ 213 km ) -long state highway contained entirely in Allentown , Lehigh County , Pennsylvania and its immediate suburbs mostly along Hamilton Boulevard . The route , in center city Allentown , is aligned along West Hamilton , West Linden , and West Walnut Streets . The southern terminus of the route is at Interstate 78 ( I @-@ 78 ) and PA 309 in <unk> , where the roadway changes designation from PA 222 to U.S. Route 222 ( US 222 ) . The northern terminus is PA 145 in Allentown . 
 Hamilton Street has served as the main street in Allentown since the community was founded in the 18th century . Hamilton Street and Hamilton Boulevard became part of the William Penn Highway in 1916 , PA 3 in 1924 , and US 22 in 1926 . In 1931 , US 22 was routed to a new alignment to the north , and Hamilton Boulevard and Hamilton Street west of 15th Street became a part of US 222 . In the 1950s , US 222 was rerouted to bypass Allentown , leaving Hamilton Boulevard and Hamilton Street through the city unnumbered . In 1984 , the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation proposed extending US 222 from I @-@ 78 / PA 309 to downtown Allentown , where it would end at PA 145 . The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( AASHTO ) rejected extending US 222 into Allentown , and PA 222 was instead designated to run between I @-@ 78 / PA 309 and US 222 and PA 145 in 1991 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 PA 222 begins at an interchange with I @-@ 78 / PA 309 in the community of <unk> in South Whitehall Township in Lehigh County , where the road continues southwest as US 222 towards Reading . From this interchange , PA 222 heads northeast on four @-@ lane divided Hamilton Boulevard , passing between Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom to the north and businesses to the south . Direct access to Dorney Park is limited to PA 222 southbound , as northbound traffic must make a left turn onto Lincoln Avenue to access the park . After passing the amusement park , the route splits into two carriageways , with PA 222 north remaining on Hamilton Boulevard and PA 222 south following the newer Hamilton Boulevard Bypass to the north . A short distance to the east , the road intersects Cedar Crest Boulevard , a major north – south arterial in the Allentown metropolitan area . 
 Northeast of Cedar Crest Boulevard , the two carriageways merge onto Hamilton Boulevard as it passes to the south of Cedar Crest College . At this point , PA 222 leaves South Whitehall Township for the city of Allentown . The route becomes a four @-@ lane undivided road and passes through residential areas . At the intersection with Ott Street , PA 222 curves east onto Hamilton Street and runs along the southern edge of Cedar Creek Park , where it intersects 24th Street . The road continues east through residential and commercial areas , narrowing to three lanes with two northbound lanes and one southbound lane at the 20th Street intersection . The route passes to the north of St. Luke 's Hospital between 18th and 17th streets and comes to an intersection with 15th Street . 
 PA 222 heads into downtown Allentown , where it splits into a one @-@ way pair at 12th Street . Northbound PA 222 turns south onto 12th Street and east onto Walnut Street while southbound PA 222 runs west along Linden Street to 12th Street , following 12th Street south to Hamilton Street . Walnut Street is two lanes and two @-@ way until 10th Street , where it becomes one @-@ way with two northbound lanes heading east , while Linden Street is one way southbound with two lanes heading west . The one @-@ way paring continues east past homes and businesses in the downtown area . Southbound PA 222 passes to the north of the PPL Center sports arena between 8th and 7th streets . PA 222 intersects 7th Street , which carries southbound PA 145 , before it reaches its northern terminus at 6th Street , which carries northbound PA 145 . 
 = = History = = 
 From the establishment of Allentown in the 18th century to the modern age , Hamilton Street has been the main arterial of the municipality . Similar to many other Allentown @-@ area streets at the time ; Hamilton , Linden , and Walnut Streets were used for trolley car and horse transportation . Following an economic depression the city suffered in the late 19th century , it rebounded in the 20th century with the establishment of many shopping stores on Hamilton Street ; the commercial center of the city , that hosted the annual <unk> Parade , a popular attraction in the 1910s . 
 When the Sproul Road Bill was signed on May 31 , 1911 , the state began maintenance over state highways . One of those highways was Legislative Route 157 , the modern Hamilton Boulevard section of PA 222 , west of Allentown . Another state highway was Legislative Route 159 , aligned east of Allentown to downtown Bethlehem along Hanover Avenue and Broad Street . No routes had a designation within the city of Allentown . 
 In 1916 , the William Penn Highway was organized as an alternative to the Lincoln Highway . The roadway traversed downtown Allentown via Hamilton Street and Hamilton Boulevard . The Pennsylvania Department of Highways gave the road the PA 3 numbering in 1924 and when the United States Highway System was formed , US 22 became part of it . The William Penn Highway served New York City ; the road became problematic for motorists in Lebanon along the current US 422 ; Reading via current US 422 and US 222 ; and Allentown on Hamilton Street . PA 43 was aligned as a bypass , north of the Pennsylvania Dutch Country , between Allentown and Harrisburg . On June 8 , 1931 , the American Association of State Highway Officials came to a resolution to the traffic problem , by replacing the PA 43 corridor with US 22 and the William Penn Highway name to match . The state truncated PA 43 to Susquehanna Street from Allentown to Bethlehem . US 222 replaced the former US 22 alignment from Reading to Allentown . Hamilton Street was numbered as US 222 , west of downtown Allentown , where it turned north onto 15th Street . This portion of US 222 was seven @-@ blocks long which ended at Tilghman Street ( then US 22 ) . Signs were changed to reflect the new designations on May 31 , 1932 , with the new route designations officially in place on June 1 , 1932 . 
 In the late 1950s , US 222 was realigned to a newly constructed bypass carrying US 309 and PA 29 , west of Allentown . From the south , US 222 left Hamilton Boulevard and turned north onto the freeway . US 222 terminated at an interchange with US 22 , US 309 , and PA 29 in South Whitehall Township . By 1970 , what was the US 309 / PA 29 / US 222 freeway had the PA 29 designation removed , US 309 downgraded to PA 309 and US 222 was truncated to end at its current northern terminus . By the 1980s , I @-@ 78 became part of the freeway that occupied PA 309 . 
 In 1984 , the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation was planning to extend PA 145 and US 222 . Traffic engineer Samuel D. <unk> said that Allentown is one of few Pennsylvania cities without a traffic route going through it . After the plan was introduced , he said that motorists might be aided if US 222 is extended along Hamilton Boulevard to connect with the proposed PA 145 corridor . PennDOT originally planned the road as US 222 but AASHTO denied the extension , stating that the route " is not the shortest or best available route between major control points on the system , and therefore , does not adhere to the policies established under AASHTO 's ' Purpose and Policy Statement for U.S. Numbered Highways ' " . In addition , the route did not meet the criteria for a business route . In 1991 , it was commissioned as PA 222 . PA 145 was extended south of the US 22 freeway to the I @-@ 78 / PA 309 overlap near Lanark .

 = Johannes Rebmann = 
 Johannes Rebmann ( January 16 , 1820 – October 4 , 1876 ) was a German missionary and explorer credited with feats including being the first European , along with his colleague Johann Ludwig Krapf , to enter Africa from the Indian Ocean coast . In addition , he was the first European to find Kilimanjaro . News of Rebmann 's discovery was published in the Church Missionary Intelligencer in May 1849 , but disregarded as mere fantasy for the next twelve years . The Geographical Society of London held that snow could not possibly occur let alone persist in such latitudes and considered the report to be the hallucination of a malaria @-@ stricken missionary . It was only in 1861 that researchers began their efforts to measure Kilimanjaro . Expeditions to Tanzania between 1861 and 1865 , led by the German Baron Karl Klaus von der <unk> , confirmed Rebmann ’ s report . Together with his colleague Johann Ludwig Krapf he also discovered Mt . Kenya . Their work there is also thought to have had effects on future African expeditions by Europeans , including the exploits of Sir Richard Burton , John Hanning Speke , and David Livingstone . After losing most of his eyesight and entering into a brief marriage , he died of pneumonia . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Rebmann was born to a Swabian farmer and <unk> on January 16 , 1820 in <unk> , Württemberg . The village he lived in was very small , with about 1 @,@ 500 inhabitants . Even at an early age , he aspired to be a " preacher and canvasser of the gospel " . 
 Later , when Rebmann became a young man , he chose to devote himself to being a missionary , and was trained in Basel . In 1844 he attended the Church Missionary Society College , Islington . The following year he was ordained as a priest by the Bishop of London and he became a member of the Church Missionary Society . Together with fellow missionary Johann Ludwig Krapf , Rebmann traveled in 1846 by a ship called " Arrow " to East Africa , where he worked in what is now Kenya , as well as at various other locations . 
 Their work was hard , and they had much trouble convincing tribal chiefs to let them speak to the people . Krapf noted ( what he called ) the " surge of Islam " that was going through Africa , and wanted to make some sort of Christian standing against its religious influence on the people of the continent . As the radius of the two missionaries work expanded , plans for Christian missionary outposts in the area began to develop . 
 During his time in Africa , Rebmann kept a diary from 1848 until the end of his life . In the diary , Rebmann writes of the way his trust in his Christianity kept him stable in the continent of Africa , where only very few Europeans had ventured before him . An extract from the diary , which Rebmann in turn took from the Bible ( Psalm : 51 , 12 ) reflects Rebmann 's belief in his faith : " Restore to me joy of your salvation and grant me a willing spirit , to sustain me . " 
 = = Stumbling upon Kilimanjaro and Mt . Kenya = = 
 In 1848 , Rebmann was the first European to see Kilimanjaro . The following year , he saw Mt . Kenya together with his colleague Krapf . 
 On the October 16 , 1847 , the two men set out for the mountain of <unk> . With them came eight tribesmen and a local caravan leader named Bwana Kheri . This expedition was designed with the goal of establishing some of the first mission posts in the region . The journey was successful , and the group of tribesmen and the missionaries returned to Mombasa on October 27 . 
 Sometime during their journey or their stay in the region , Rebmann and Krapf learned of a great mountain referred to as ' <unk> ' , which reached the clouds and which was ' capped in silver ' . The two men , like most Europeans at the time , were under the impression that snow and ice could not exist so close to the equator , and failed to realize the significance of the mountain being ' topped with silver ' . 
 However , the two missionaries , who had become just as much explorers as they were missionaries , became quite interested in Kilimanjaro , and Krapf sought permission of the Mombasa governor for an expedition to the land of the Jagga , a people now known as the <unk> , who lived and live on the actual slopes of Kilimanjaro . Krapf told the governor that this journey would be work @-@ based . Despite this , Krapf actually did not accompany Rebmann on the journey , so only Bwana Kheri and Rebmann left for Kilimanjaro on April 27 , 1848 . 
 Within two weeks , Rebmann and his guide were within sight of the mountain . He noted in his journal the strange white on the summit of Kilimanjaro , and he questioned his guide on what he thought it was . According to Rebmann 's log , the guide ' did not know what it was , but supposed it was coldness ' . It was then that Rebmann realised that Kilimanjaro , even though it was located in a region that was thought impossible to bear snow or ' coldness ' , as the guide referred to it , was in fact capped in it . In 1849 , these observations were published , but the findings were not truly accepted by most of the scientific community at the time . On November 10 , 1848 , Rebmann recorded an entry in his log about the mountain : 
 This morning we discerned the Mountains of Jagga more distinctly than ever ; and about ten o 'clock I fancied I saw a dazzlingly white cloud . My Guide called the white which I saw merely ' Baridi , ' cold ; it was perfectly clear to me , however , that it could be nothing else but snow . 
 Mt . Kenya was discovered by Krapf in the next year , on December 3 , 1849 . The finding of this mountain was also met with disbelief in Europe , but the effect of these discoveries was enough to trigger further investigation into other areas of Africa , thereby stimulating a growth of scientific ( among other fields ) knowledge of the regions , people , history , and geography of the African continent . 
 = = Other work in Africa = = 
 Rebmann stayed in Africa for almost thirty consecutive years . He kept to a policy that , in order to truly affect the African people , and to complete his task as a missionary , much patience was needed . It appears that this policy was the driving force behind his many years of work on the continent . 
 As well as visiting Kilimanjaro , Rebmann and Krapf visited other areas of Africa , including the African Great Lakes and Mount Meru . He even became married to a fellow missionary , Anna Maria , née Maisch , with whom he spent fifteen years doing missionary work in Africa before her death in 1866 , and with whom he had a child ( who died only days after his birth ) . 
 Also during his time in Africa , after his expeditions to Kilimanjaro and around the Great lakes , he learned to speak several native languages , and wrote the first dictionary of the ( Chichewa ) ( <unk> ) language , as well as completing a dictionary ( started by his colleague Ludwig Krapf ) of the Nika ( <unk> ) language , and a dictionary of Swahili ( now lost , but of which some material may have been incorporated into Krapf 's Dictionary of the <unk> Language ( 1882 ) ) . He also translated the Gospel of Luke into Swahili . 
 = = = Slug map = = = 
 During their time in Africa , Krapf and Rebmann worked their way into the interior of the continent . They traveled to several areas in the regions of Central and Eastern Africa , including to what is now known as the African Great Lakes . The finding of one especially large lake ( <unk> ) is depicted in a map known as the ' Slug ' map . It was known by this name because the layout of the water body suggested a shape similar to that of a slug . 
 The basis for the map was prepared by the missionary Jakob Erhardt from the reports of his companions Krapf and Rebmann , and from verbal information that he had acquired from local people . Erhardt was struck by the fact that travelers who had gone inland from different points on the coast had all come to an inland sea . In November 1854 , while talking about the problem to Rebmann , " at one and the same moment , the problem flashed on both of us solved by the simple supposition that where geographical hypothesis had hitherto supposed an enormous mountain @-@ land , we must now look for an enormous valley and an inland sea . " On the map that he and Rebmann drew the three lakes of Nyasa , Tanganyika and Victoria are shown as one very large S @-@ shaped lake . 
 On the map , several subtle but interesting things can be discovered , including , in the northeast section of the <unk> , a reference to a stream flowing through Lake Victoria , then known by the missionaries as " the <unk> " . A note is present describing how the waters of the stream were very sweet , but stained the teeth a sickly yellow . This note is probably the first known text referring to the drinking water , found primarily around and of Mount Meru , which has a high content of fluorine and causes a yellow @-@ brown stain to the incisors which cannot be removed . Among other things , another piece of writing on the Slug Map - " From where the <unk> [ soda ] is bought " - provides evidence that the soda trade , the soda originating in Lake <unk> ( obviously not known by that name then ) , was active at that time in those regions of Africa in which the map depicts . 
 In 1855 Erhardt was repatriated due to poor health , and took his map with him . It was first published in the <unk> <unk> in 1855 , and then in the Church Missionary intelligencer in 1856 . The Slug Map based on Erhardt 's map has never been published . It is now in the care of the Royal Geographical Society in London . The map is described by the society as : 
 Sketch of a Map from 1 ° N. to 15 ° S. Latitude and from 23 ° to 43 ° E. Longitude delineating the probably position and extent of the Sea of <unk> as being the continuation of the Lake <unk> and exhibiting the numerous heathen @-@ tribes situated to the East and West of that great Inland @-@ sea together with the Caravan routes leading to it and into the interior in general . In true accordance with the information received from natives - Representatives of various inland tribes - and <unk> inland traders . By the Revd . Messrs. Erhardt and F. Rebmann Missionaries of the Church Miss . Society in East Africa <unk> March 14 , 1855 .

 Having almost lost his eyesight for unknown reasons , Rebmann went back to Europe in September 1875 . He returned to Germany for the first time in 29 years after being persuaded to do so by a fellow missionary who was working in the area . He then proceeded to take up residence in Korntal near Stuttgart , where he was close to his old friend Krapf . In spring 1876 , upon the advice of Krapf , he married the widow of another missionary from India , Louise Rebmann née <unk> . The marriage did not last long , as on October 4 , 1876 , Rebmann died of pneumonia . Engraved on Rebmann 's tombstone in the cemetery of Korntal are the words " Saved in Jesus ' Arms " . 
 The legacy that he left behind him is preserved by the Johannes Rebmann Foundation , a religious society devoted to Rebmann and his memory . Rebmann 's work in Africa , both as a missionary and as an explorer , allowed other Europeans to follow in his footsteps .

 In late May 2004 , the band traveled to the Democratic Republic of Congo with War Child Canada , a branch of the British charity organization War Child , to document the civil war in the country . Days after arriving , fighting broke out in Bukavu near the hotel the band was staying at . 
 The band waited for the fighting to die down , but it did not . During that time , a U.N. peacekeeper , Charles " Chuck " Pelletier , called for armored carriers to take the hotel 's occupants out of the hot zone . After nearly six hours , the carriers arrived , and the band and the forty other civilians were taken to safety . 
 In honor of Pelletier , Sum 41 named its next album Chuck ; it was released on October 12 , 2004 .

 Sum 41 has collaborated with many other artists , both live and in the studio , among whom are Tenacious D , Ludacris , Iggy Pop , Pennywise , Bowling for Soup , Unwritten Law , Treble Charger , Nelly , Gob , Tommy Lee , Rob Halford , Kerry King , Metallica , and Ja Rule . 
 Shortly after touring for Does This Look Infected ? , Sum 41 was recruited by Iggy Pop for his album , Skull Ring . Deryck co @-@ wrote the first single from the album , " Little Know It All " , and joined Iggy on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote the song . Following the band 's September 11 , 2005 show in Quebec City , Quebec , the band went on a touring hiatus , although on April 17 , 2006 , Sum 41 played at a tribute to Iggy Pop , joining Iggy on stage for " Little Know It All " and " Lust For Life " . 
 During the band 's 2006 touring hiatus , Whibley focused on his producing career : he produced two songs for Avril Lavigne 's album The Best Damn Thing . Jocz recorded his first video as director for a Canadian band , The Midway State , and McCaslin started a side project with Todd Morse of H2O and Juliette and the Licks . McCaslin 's two @-@ person band , named The Operation M.D. , released its debut album , We Have an Emergency , in early 2007 . As well as playing bass , keyboards , and acoustic guitar , McCaslin contributed backing vocals as well as leading vocals on three songs . The album was co @-@ produced and mixed by Whibley . The group 's video for its first single , " Sayonara " , was directed by Jocz . 
 In December 2007 , McCaslin interviewed Slash of Velvet Revolver . They talked about Slash 's experiences while in Guns N ' Roses and his part in Velvet Revolver . The interview was part of a MySpace project and was posted on the site in three parts . 
 The 2010 video game Vancouver 2010 features Sum 41 's " Open Your Eyes " from Chuck as one of the game 's songs . 
 = = Musical style and influences = = 
 Sum 41 have been described as pop punk , skate punk , punk rock , nu metal , melodic hardcore , alternative rock and alternative metal . 
 The band 's style has been disputed by fans because of the complex combination of different musical styles and the more mature , serious , and heavy sound in later albums . The band 's EP Half Hour of Power is described as punk rock , skate punk and pop punk . All Killer , No Filler was described as pop punk and skate punk . Does This Look Infected ? has been described as punk rock , pop punk and melodic hardcore . Chuck was getting heavier opting out the original pop punk sound with strong metal influences and an alternative rock sound , but the band kept in touch with its punk rock and melodic hardcore roots , which created an even more mature side than the group 's previous effort . Critics have described Underclass Hero as a revival of the band 's pop punk style . Some of the band 's songs contain political @-@ social commentary ; " The Jester " is an " anti @-@ Bush screed " , " Underclass Hero " is a song about class struggle , and " Dear Father " is about Deryck 's absent father . The band 's most recent effort , Screaming Bloody Murder , marks a return to the direction of Chuck , with songs such as the title track or the Grammy @-@ nominated Blood in my Eyes featuring heavier guitar riffs . Opposite to the heavier direction , there are also tracks such as the second single Baby You Don 't Wanna Know whose style leans more towards a garage rock approach . The album furthermore features more experimental song structures , mostly evident in the piece A Dark Road Out Of Hell consisting of three tracks of the record . 
 Sum 41 have been influenced by bands like NOFX , Pennywise , The Vandals , Gob , Bad Religion , Rancid , Green Day , Metallica , Iron Maiden , Blink @-@ 182 , The Offspring , Megadeth , Slayer , Nirvana and The Beatles . 
 = = Internet videos = = 
 Touring in support of Chuck , the band played videos before its set which were deemed " unsuitable for children " . Controversy arose over some of the videos ' violent content . The group made several other videos , including Basketball Butcher and 1 @-@ 800 @-@ Justice , which were originally available exclusively on Sum 41 's now @-@ defunct fan club , The Goon Platoon . 
 Sum 41 's most recent internet video project is a " weekly series , " SUM 41 - Road to Ruin . The trailer was posted on January 8 , 2007 on the Sum 41 web page . The first episode debuted on January 21 ; it followed the band members ' exploits on the group 's Singapore 2003 tour . Since then , the episodes have included footage of drunkenness in New Orleans , setting off a fire alarm in a hotel , and a feature about the band 's first tour manager . So far , the group has released ten episodes , with the group 's latest and as the group stated , its ' last ' for now being an episode that features the band 's guitar technician . The group also created a series of cartoons based on superhero " Stickman Moss " , who saved the world from anti @-@ punk figures who endangered the world of punk rock . 
 In December 2009 , the band launched a new daily update series from the pre @-@ production of the group 's upcoming fifth studio album . It was announced on the band 's Myspace page that the daily updates will run for the 2 – 3 weeks of pre @-@ production . 13 video updates from the pre @-@ production were made and posted on the band 's official Myspace page .

 = History of Northwest Territories capital cities = 
 The history of Northwest Territories capital cities begins with the purchase of the Territories by Canada from the Hudson 's Bay Company in 1869 , and includes a varied and often difficult evolution . Northwest Territories is unique amongst the other provinces and territories of Canada in that it has had seven capital cities in its history . The territory has changed the seat of government for numerous reasons , including civil conflict , development of infrastructure , and a history of significant revisions to its territorial boundaries . 
 The result of these changes has been a long and complex road to responsible government . Effectively providing services and representation for the population has been a particular challenge for the Territories ' government , a task often complicated by the region 's vast and changing geographic area . A small number of communities in Northwest Territories have unsuccessfully tried to become the capital over the years . The territory has had the seat of government outside of its territorial boundaries twice in its history . The only other political division in Canada without a seat of government inside its own boundaries was the defunct District of Keewatin that existed from 1876 until 1905 . 
 The term " capital " refers to cities that have served as home for the Legislative Assembly of Northwest Territories , the legislative branch of Northwest Territories government . In Canada , it is customary for provincial and territorial level government to have the administrative centre of the civil service in the same city as the legislative branch . The Northwest Territories , however , had separate administrative and legislative capitals officially exist between 1911 and 1967 . This is the only province or territory in Canadian history to have had such an arrangement . 
 = = Fort Garry , Manitoba ( 1870 – 1876 ) = = 
 The Government of Canada purchased the North @-@ Western Territory and Rupert 's Land from the Hudson 's Bay Company in 1868 , under the terms of the Rupert 's Land Act 1868 for £ 300 @,@ 000 British pounds . Both purchased territories were largely uninhabited , consisting mostly of uncharted wilderness . After the purchase , the Government decided to merge both of the properties into a single jurisdiction and appoint a single territorial government to run both . The purchase of the two territories added a sizable portion of the current Canadian landmass . 
 In 1869 , Ontario Member of Parliament William McDougall was appointed as the first Lieutenant Governor of the Northwest Territories and sent to Fort Garry to establish formal governance for Canada . Before his party arrived at the settlement , a small group led by Louis Riel intercepted him near the Ontario border and forced him to turn back because they opposed the transfer to the Canadian government . The inhabitants of the Red River Valley began the Red River Rebellion , delaying formal governance until their demands for provincial status were met . 
 The rebellion resulted in the creation of the Province of Manitoba ( inclusive of Fort Garry ) and a delay in establishing governance in the Territories . In 1870 , the Northwest Territories and Manitoba formally entered the Canadian confederation . The two jurisdictions remained partially conjoined : under the Temporary Government Act , 1870 . The Temporary North @-@ West Council was appointed in 1872 , mainly from members of the new Manitoba Legislative Assembly , with the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba serving as the leader of the territorial government . The Governor and Council were mandated to govern the Territories through the Manitoba Act and did so from outside of the Northwest Territories . Fort Garry served as the first seat of government for both jurisdictions . 
 The temporary government sat for the first time in 1872 . It was renewed by federal legislation each year until a permanent solution for governance was decided upon . The federal government renewed the Temporary Council for the last time in 1875 and chose a new location , within the boundaries of the Northwest Territories , to form a new government . Along with the new seat of power , a new council greatly reduced in size was appointed along with a new Lieutenant Governor to specifically lead the Territories without also governing Manitoba . 
 In the 1870s , Fort Garry consisted of two distinct settlements . The first site was named Upper Fort Garry , and the secondary site was named Lower Fort Garry , 32 kilometres ( 20 mi ) downstream on the Red River . After the territorial government moved , Fort Garry continued to be the seat of government for Manitoba , and for the now defunct District of Keewatin territory between 1876 and 1905 . Fort Garry evolved to become modern @-@ day Winnipeg , still the capital of Manitoba , with Lower Fort Garry being declared a national historical site . 
 = = Fort Livingstone , North @-@ West Territories ( 1876 – 1877 ) = = 
 The North @-@ West Territories Act , 1875 dissolved the Temporary North @-@ West Council and appointed a permanent government to take effect on October 7 , 1876 . The new council governed from Fort Livingstone , an outpost constructed west of the Manitoba border , in modern @-@ day Saskatchewan . Fort Livingstone served as a small frontier outpost and not as a bona fide capital city . The location was chosen by the federal government as a temporary site to establish the new territorial government until the route of the railway was determined . 
 Fort Livingstone was founded in 1875 by the newly created North @-@ West Mounted Police , the predecessor of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , Canada 's national police force . The Swan River North @-@ West Mounted Police Barracks , inside Fort Livingstone , became the temporary assembly building for legislative @-@ council sessions as well as the office for the Lieutenant Governor . 
 The bulk of the police forces moved out to Fort Macleod in 1876 , to crack down on the whisky trade . A year later , Lieutenant Governor David Laird moved the seat of government to Battleford . The decision was based upon the original plans of constructing the Canadian Pacific Railway ( CPR ) through Battleford . 
 Fort Livingstone continued to serve as a small outpost until being totally destroyed by a prairie grass fire in 1884 . The nearest modern settlement to the original Fort Livingstone site is Pelly , Saskatchewan , four kilometres ( 2 @.@ 5 mi ) to the south . The fort is sometimes referred to as Fort Pelly or Swan River . The Fort Livingstone site is marked with a plaque as was declared a Saskatchewan provincial heritage site and contains no resident population . 
 = = Battleford , North @-@ West Territories ( 1877 – 1883 ) = = 
 The Northwest Territories government moved to Battleford in 1877 on the order of the Lieutenant Governor . Battleford was supposed to be the permanent capital of the Territories . The town was chosen because it was expected to be linked with the Canadian Pacific Railway . 
 The government in Battleford would see significant milestones towards attaining responsible government for the Northwest Territories . For the first time , the territory had democratically elected members join the appointed members in the assembly . Elections in the territory became a reality after the passage of the Northwest Territories election ordinance 1880 . The first election took place in 1881 , after electoral districts were created by royal proclamations , issued the order of the Lieutenant Governor . Battleford hosted the first official royal visit in western Canada , when the Marquis of Lorne and Princess Louise Caroline Alberta toured the territories in 1881 . 
 The first Northwest Territories legislature building , and residence for the Lieutenant Governor named " NWT Government House " , was completed and used by the territorial government until 1883 . After the government moved the building stood as a historical site until it was destroyed in a fire in 2003 . 
 After consultation with Canadian Pacific Railway officials , Lieutenant Governor Edgar Dewdney made the decision to move the capital to Regina , also in present @-@ day Saskatchewan , in June 1882 . The decision to move the capital was controversial with the public because Edgar Dewdney owned real estate in Regina . He was accused of having conflicted interests between his private affairs and the needs of the government . 
 = = Regina , North @-@ West Territories ( 1883 – 1905 ) = = 
 After Edgar Dewdney ordered that the government be moved south to meet the railway in Regina , it was confirmed as the new territorial capital on March 27 , 1883 . Construction of a new legislature began . In Regina , the government continued to grow as the size of the settlement increased rapidly . The legislature had the most sitting members in Northwest Territories history after the fifth general election in 1902 . 
 The government in Regina struggled to deliver services to the vast territory . The influx of settlers and responsibility for the Klondike , as well as constant fighting with the federal government over limited legislative powers and minimal revenue collection , hampered the effectiveness of government . The government during this period slowly released powers to the elected members . In 1897 , after control of the executive council was ceded to elected members from the Lieutenant @-@ Governors , a short @-@ lived period of party politics evolved that challenged the consensus model of government that had been used since 1870 . 
 The territorial government under the leadership of Premier Frederick Haultain struck a deal with the federal Government of Canada in early 1905 to bring provincial powers to the territories . This led to the creation of the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta from the southernmost and most populous areas of the territory . The Northwest Territories , reduced to its northern , lightly populated hinterland , continued to exist under the 1870s constitutional status under control of the federal government . A new council was convened in Ottawa , Ontario to deal with the region . 
 The Territorial Administration Building was declared a historical site by the Saskatchewan government after it was restored by the Saskatchewan Government in 1979 , the building remains standing to this day . The territorial government would not have another permanent legislature of its own design until 1993 . After 1905 , Regina continued to serve as capital for the province of Saskatchewan . 
 = = Ottawa , Ontario as legislative capital ( 1905 – 1967 ) = = 
 In 1905 , under the direction of Wilfrid Laurier , the Northwest Territories seat of government was moved to Ottawa , Ontario , the capital of Canada . This change was made when Northwest Territories defaulted back to the 1870 constitutional status after Alberta and Saskatchewan were sectioned off from the territory on September 1 , 1905 . After the populated regions of the territory were made into their own jurisdictions , there were very few settlements left in the territory with any significant population or infrastructure . The non @-@ Inuit population was estimated to total around 1 @,@ 000 . Inuit were not counted at the time because they had no status under Canadian law , and were not yet settled in towns or villages . 
 In the period without a sitting council from 1905 to 1921 , the government of the Territories was small but still active . A small civil service force was sent to Fort Smith to set the town up as the new administrative capital in 1911 . A budget to provide minimal services was still given by the federal government . Commissioner Frederick D. White administered the territories day @-@ to @-@ day operations during that period . During this 16 @-@ year lapse in legislative government , no new laws were created , and the Territories and its population were severely neglected even with the services provided at the time . 
 The first session of the new council was called to order in 1921 , a full 16 years after the government was dissolved in Regina . This new government contained no serving member who was resident in the Territories . The council during this period was primarily composed of high @-@ level civil servants who lived and worked in Ottawa . The first person to sit on the council since 1905 who actually resided from within the Territories was John G. McNiven who was appointed in 1947 . 
 The Ottawa @-@ based council eventually grew sensitive to the needs of the territory residents . Democracy returned to the territories in the sixth general election in 1951 . After the election , the council was something of a vagabond body , with alternating sittings in Ottawa , and various communities in Northwest Territories . The council held meetings in school gymnasiums , community halls , board rooms , or any suitable infrastructure . The council even transported ceremonial implements to conduct meetings with such as the speakers chair and mace . Both are traditional artifacts common to Westminster style parliaments . 
 Legislative sessions held in Ottawa were conducted in an office building on Sparks Street . The Northwest Territories government continues to hold an office in Ottawa on Sparks Street to this day . In 1965 , a federal government commission was set up to determine a new home for the government and the future of the territory . The seat of government was moved back inside the territories to Yellowknife , after it was selected capital in 1967 . 
 = = Fort Smith , Northwest Territories as administrative capital ( 1911 – 1967 ) = = 
 Fort Smith became the official administration and transportation hub for the Northwest Territories in 1911 . This marked the first services provided by the territorial government in six years . The first services included an agent from the Department of Indian Affairs , a medical doctor , and a Royal Canadian Mounted Police station . 
 Fort Smith was chosen to house the civil service because of its geographical location and state of development . The community was one of the few that had steamboat service from the railheads in Alberta and access to the vast waterways in the territory . The community was the easiest for the government to access , and the most well developed community , closest to Ottawa . 
 Fort Smith housed the civil service working in the Territories officially until 1967 . The town continued to host the civil service for many years after Yellowknife was picked as capital , because the infrastructure was not yet in place in the new capital city at the time . 
 = = Carrothers Commission examines Self @-@ government for the North ( 1965 @-@ 1967 ) = = 
 The " Advisory Commission on the Development of Government in the Northwest Territories " , commonly called the Carrothers Commission for its chair , Alfred Carrothers , was struck by the Government of Canada in 1965 . The Carrothers Commission marked a significant turning point in modern Northwest Territories history . The Carrothers Commission was tasked to evaluate and recommend changes to the Northwest Territories to deal with an array of outstanding issues regarding self @-@ government in the north . One of the more visible and lasting effects of the Carrothers Commission was to choose a new capital city for the territorial government . 
 The Carrothers Commission , for the first time , gave some voice to residents in the Northwest Territories through extensive consultations with the territorial population . In prior years , the decision to change the seat of government had always been made without consulting Northwest Territories residents . Edgar Dewdney , for example , who made the decision to change the capital from Battleford to Regina , faced controversy because he owned property in Regina . After the territorial government moved to Ottawa , the government was often resented for being so far away . 
 The Carrothers Commission spent two years visiting nearly every community in the territory and consulting with residents , community leaders , business people , and territorial politicians . The Carrothers Commission investigated and considered five communities for the capital : Hay River , Fort Simpson , Fort Smith , <unk> and Yellowknife . 
 Many people in the Northwest Territories believed that Fort Smith would win since it already housed the Territories ' civil service . 
 = = Yellowknife , Northwest Territories , current capital ( 1967 – present ) = = 
 Yellowknife officially became the capital on September 18 , 1967 , after the Carrothers commission chose it for its central location , transportation links , industrial base and residents ' preferences . 
 Yellowknife , in 1967 , was not yet ready to serve as home for the government . During the years that it took for the capital 's infrastructure to slowly develop , most of the civil service remained in Fort Smith for many years and the governing Council continued its practice of holding legislative sessions all over the territory for a number of years . 
 The Northwest Territories marked a new era when the legislative council moved into a newly constructed legislature building on November 17 , 1993 . The new legislature was the first building built specifically for the Northwest Territories government since the government sat in Regina 88 years earlier . The legislature building was constructed to feature themes derived from the Inuit culture , which signaled that the government was sensitive to the ethnicity of the resident population . 
 The modern day territorial government has matured in Yellowknife to become effective and responsible . The government in Yellowknife had largely gained back its powers on par with the pre @-@ 1905 government that was dissolved during creation of Alberta and Saskatchewan . The civil service has been effectively consolidated into the city of Yellowknife ; and has gained control over administering its own elections from Elections Canada . Education is now under the jurisdiction of the territorial government and the territory has most powers afforded to the rest of the provinces . There has even talk by the Federal government of the territories gaining provincial status in the future . 
 = = Lessons learned for Nunavut capital ( 1995 vote ) = = 
 As chronicled above , all seven capitals throughout the history of the Northwest Territories were chosen by some form of external government decision , though the Carrothers Commission did consult with the territorial population to guide its decision . 
 After the selection of Yellowknife as the capital in 1967 , many residents in the eastern Arctic continued to feel unrepresented by the territorial government , and many movements and groups were formed to remedy the situation . Lessons had been learned from the historical changes in the Northwest Territories ' seat of power , resulting in a number of territorial democratic processes leading to the creation of the new territory of Nunavut in 1999 , formed from the eastern half of the Northwest Territories . 
 In 1976 , as part of the land claims negotiations between the Inuit <unk> <unk> population and the Government of Canada , the parties discussed division of the Northwest Territories to provide a separate territory for the Inuit . In 1982 , a plebiscite on division was held throughout the Northwest Territories , in which a majority of the residents voted in favour of division . 
 The land claims agreement was completed in September 1992 and ratified by a majority of voters . On July 9 , 1993 , the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act and the Nunavut Act were passed by the Canadian Parliament . 
 In December , 1995 , the Nunavut capital plebiscite was held , and the voters in the future Nunavut territory chose Iqaluit as their capital city , defeating Rankin Inlet . Iqaluit became the official capital on April 1 , 1999 , when Nunavut separated from the Northwest Territories .

Held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . Oxford won by three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ quarter lengths , securing their seventh consecutive victory .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . First held in 1829 , the race takes place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having beaten Cambridge by eight lengths in the previous year 's race . However Cambridge held the overall lead , with 68 victories to Oxford 's 58 . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Up until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the Tideway , prior to the main Boat Race . 
 During the pre @-@ race preparations , the Cambridge crew struck a floating railway sleeper near Chiswick Eyot , damaging their boat which needed repair before the race . Oxford 's crew suffered illness in the days leading up the race , in particular the president Nick Conington who was moved from stroke to bow to reduce the chances of a possible recurrence of glandular fever . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Oxford crew weighed an average of just below 14 st ( 88 @.@ 7 kg ) per rower , and had a 10 pounds ( 4 @.@ 5 kg ) per man advantage over Cambridge . Oxford saw four former Blues return , including the first female cox in Sue Brown . Cambridge 's crew contained a single Blue in boat club president Roger Stephens . Despite retiring from rowing , Boris Rankov , a junior fellow at St Hugh 's was persuaded back into the crew by the Oxford boat club president Nick Conington . Rankov was rowing in his fifth consecutive Boat Race , alongside Steve Foster whom he supervised in classics . Oxford 's crew also contained the Clay twins , Robert and Hugh .

 River conditions were calm : Jim Railton of The Times described the course as " a smooth and flat Queen 's highway from Putney to Mortlake . " Michael Muir @-@ Smith was the umpire for the race , for which Oxford were " heavily favoured " . They won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station . A good start from the Light Blues saw them a length ahead by Craven Cottage and passing the Mile Post one second ahead of Oxford . From Harrods Furniture Depository , Oxford fought their way back into contention with cox Brown forcing her counterpart Bernstein to steer towards the centre of the river . Both crews shot Hammersmith Bridge a second apart , with Oxford quickly gaining a length 's lead and a clear water advantage . Cambridge were nine seconds down by Chiswick Steps and a further second behind at Barnes Bridge . Oxford passed the finishing post eleven seconds and three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ quarter lengths ahead of Cambridge , in a time of 18 minutes 21 seconds , to record their seventh consecutive victory . 
 In the reserve race , Isis beat Goldie by one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ quarter lengths and five seconds in a time of 18 minutes 43 seconds to record their third consecutive victory . In the 37th running of the Women 's Boat Race , Cambridge triumphed , their first win in three years .

 Rankov , who became the first rower to win five consecutive Boat Races ( C. R. W. Tottenham had won five as a cox in the 1860s ) , admitted , " The beginning was all right . We expected them to be up on us before Hammersmith . But the burn we did there was exhausting . It was really hard just to keep in front for the rest of the way . " Defeated Cambridge cox Bernstein said , " I can 't wait to get back at them next year " , while his stroke Simon Harris stated , " we will have six of this crew left next year . That 's a good base " . The Clays became the first twins to win a Boat Race . 
 = Action of 10 November 1808 = 
 The Action of 10 November 1808 was a minor naval engagement of the Napoleonic Wars , in which a British frigate defeated and captured a French frigate in the Bay of Biscay . The action formed part of the blockade of the French Biscay ports during the war by the British Royal Navy , a strategy designed to prevent ships from entering or leaving French harbours , thus eliminating foreign trade with France and damaging the French economy as well as cutting France off from her overseas colonies . The French ship in the action , Thétis , was destined for the French held West Indian island of Martinique with a cargo of flour and military supplies , including over 100 soldiers to reinforce the island 's garrison . 
 Thétis had not even cleared the French coast when she was discovered by a patrolling British frigate of the inshore squadron , a unit tasked with watching the entrance to the French Biscay ports , principally Brest , and intercepting any ships seeking to enter or leave the harbours . This frigate , HMS Amethyst chased Thétis and brought her to battle , closing with the French ship but preventing the soldiers aboard Thétis from boarding the British ship and using their superior numbers to overwhelm her with heavy and accurate gunfire . The battle lasted more than six hours and the French suffered over 130 men killed , including the captain and many of the soldiers aboard , before the crew of Amethyst was able to storm and capture Thétis . Within minutes two additional British vessels arrived , attracted by the sound of gunfire , and helped secure the badly damaged Thétis for the journey to Britain . 
 The battle was a blow for the French defenders of Martinique , who were isolated from France and suffering from shortages of military and food supplies . Although another supply frigate broke through the blockade and arrived in December 1808 , the island was surrounded by British bases and was invaded and captured in January 1809 . Other French colonies were seized over the next two years as the blockade cut off French communications with their overseas territories . Amethyst and her captain Michael Seymour were active in this campaign , capturing a second French frigate , Niémen , at the Action of 6 April 1809 . 
 = = Background = = 
 By November 1808 , the Napoleonic Wars had lasted five years . Although the French had conquered large swathes of mainland Europe , they were unable to exert any significant influence at sea , where the British Royal Navy had been dominant since the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805 . A vital part of Royal Navy strategy was the implementation of a close blockade of the major French seaports by squadrons of frigates and ships of the line , intended to intercept and capture any ships attempting to enter or leave French harbours . The greatest French Atlantic seaport , and consequently the most important target for the Royal Navy , was Brest , situated on the Northern Biscay coast . Watching Brest were a large number of warships , divided into the inshore squadron designed to watch the coast directly and formed principally of frigates and small fast vessels , and the offshore squadron formed from heavy ships of the line and tasked with intercepting French fleets and battle squadrons spotted by the inshore squadron . 
 The efficiency of the British blockade was such that communication and reinforcement between France and her colonies was dangerous for the ships involved and so was severely limited . This led to shortages and disaffection among the French colonists , especially in the Caribbean , where they were surrounded by hostile British harbours and constantly raided and blockaded by British ships . The island of Martinique was one of the more important French islands in the West Indies , but by late 1808 the island 's economy had been crippled by the British blockade , and food stocks , military supplies and morale were all running low . In the summer a French dispatch vessel was intercepted by British warships , warning of the desperate state of the island 's defences ; similar messages that did reach France safely prompted an urgent response by the French Navy . 
 The frigate Thétis , stationed to the south of Brest at Lorient , was selected to carry supplies to Martinique and given a full complement of 330 men , 40 cannon and a new captain , Jacques Pinsum . Supplies were loaded , including over 1 @,@ 000 barrels of flour and 106 soldiers to reinforce the garrison at Martinique . Secrecy was tight : to prevent the British discovering Thétis ' mission , even the local shore defences were not informed of the frigate 's departure early on 10 November 1808 . 
 The French efforts to hide the frigate 's mission and departure were initially successful : the British ships in the area were unaware of Thétis 's intentions before she sailed . They were however prepared for any French movement and were launching regular patrols , in particular two ships under the command of captains Michael Seymour and Frederick Lewis Maitland , HMS Amethyst and HMS Emerald respectively . Both captains were experienced and veteran officers : Seymour had lost an arm at the Glorious First of June 15 years earlier , and they had agreed to hunt together , communicating regularly and with an understanding that all prize money won would be shared equally across both crews . After several weeks sailing in tandem , the frigates separated in early November .

 At 18 : 42 on 10 November 1808 , the garrison of a French defensive gun battery on the island of Groix saw a frigate moving rapidly westwards . As they had not been informed of any French movements at that time , the battery fired two warning shots at the ship to establish her identity . The frigate , Thétis , replied with her recognition signal and the firing stopped , but the sound had attracted the attention of HMS Amethyst , then approaching Groix from the west . Within a few minutes , Seymour 's lookouts had spotted the French frigate and Amethyst immediately gave chase . Pinsum followed his orders to avoid combat and made all sail south @-@ west , intending to escape into the Atlantic . By 21 : 00 , Amethyst was close enough to fire her bow @-@ chasers , small guns positioned at the front of the ship , at the French frigate and was attacked in turn from the French stern chasers . Certain that his quarry was an enemy , Seymour launched signal rockets in the hope of attracting attention from other ships of the inshore squadron that might intercept the French ship , and he received answering flashes from the north @-@ east as Captain Sir Thomas Hardy joined the chase in HMS Triumph . 
 By 21 : 15 , Pinsum realised that his heavily laden ship could not outrun Amethyst and reduced his speed , turning sharply in front of the British ship in an attempt to rake her . Seymour was prepared for the manoeuvre and countered it by turning sharply away from Thétis so that the French broadside fell harmlessly into the sea and both frigates performed a complete circle before returning to their previous course . Seymour then swung back towards the French ship , bringing Amethyst alongside and pouring a heavy fire into Thétis , which replied in kind . For 25 minutes , the frigates continued firing on one another from close range as they sailed westwards . At 21 : 40 , Pinsum again attempted to rake Amethyst , trying to cross the British ship 's stern as she pulled ahead . Seymour countered by slowing his ship and the French rigging became tangled in the British , the firing continuing as the crews worked to free their ships from one another . Separating a few minutes later , the frigates continued their close @-@ range duel . Amethyst again pulled ahead at 22 : 05 , Seymour successfully crossing the bow of the French ship from port and raking her before swinging back along the starboard side to resume the close range exchange of broadsides . 
 French fire was taking its toll on the British ship , and at 22 : 20 , Amethyst 's mizzenmast was shot through and collapsed on the quarterdeck , smashing the wheel and impeding Seymour 's command of his ship . Thétis began to pull ahead and Pinsum attempted to rake Amethyst in her disorganised state , turning sharply to starboard but coming to a sudden halt as her own mizzenmast collapsed . With their ability to manoeuvre severely hindered , Amethyst and Thétis gradually closed on one another , Pinsum ordering the soldiers on his frigate to board the British vessel and capture her , while Seymour prepared for the eventuality by loading his cannon with two roundshot and his carronades with double loads of grapeshot . At 23 : 00 , Pinsum suddenly swung his frigate towards Amethyst , the bows colliding and rebounding and the French stern swinging towards the British . At his signal , the soldiers and sailors crowded onto the deck and railings , ready to leap onto the British ship and engage her crew in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat . With seconds remaining , Seymour ordered his gunners to fire . The double @-@ shotted broadside , fired at point @-@ blank range , killed or wounded over 100 men , including most of the officers . Only four guns were still serviceable on Thétis , which was set alight in three places due to the proximity of the British muzzle flashes .

 Amethyst continued firing on Thétis for the next 80 minutes , almost without reply , until 12 : 20 , when the British were able to board and seize Thétis unopposed , the two frigates tangled together by their rigging . Seymour 's most immediate problem was to secure his prize . Many of the unwounded prisoners were transferred to Amethyst under guard and at 01 : 05 , the frigates were cut apart by severing the tangled rigging . Ten minutes later , the 74 @-@ gun HMS Triumph appeared out of the darkness and at 01 : 30 a second frigate , HMS Shannon under Captain Philip Broke , arrived , drawn by the gunfire . Together , the three British ships removed the prisoners from Thétis and affected improvised repairs : Thétis had lost her remaining masts shortly after she had been boarded and Amethyst 's were in immediate danger of collapse . British casualties in the engagement were severe , with 19 killed and 51 wounded , but French losses were several times larger , with 135 dead , including Pinsum , and 102 wounded . 
 In Britain , Seymour 's victory was rewarded : Seymour himself was presented with a commemorative medal , £ 100 ( with £ 625 to share among the wounded ) and the freedoms of Cork and Limerick , although there were suggestions that he should receive a knighthood . In addition , first lieutenant Goddard <unk> was promoted to commander , the junior officers were advanced and Thétis was purchased by the Royal Navy as HMS Brune , the crews of Emerald and Amethyst profiting from the prize money . Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal , awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847 . Amethyst had been severely damaged in the engagement and repairs took 71 days to complete at Plymouth . Five months later , Seymour and Maitland were specially selected to hunt the Niémen , en route to Île de France , in the Bay of Biscay . Again , Emerald was absent when the frigate was brought to action and again Seymour was able to capture his opponent after a fierce encounter in the Action of 6 April 1809 . Although Seymour praised the bravery of Thétis ' surviving French officer , Lieutenant Joseph Dedé , Dedé later swore in court that Thétis had not surrendered until after Triumph and Shannon arrived , a statement that contradicts not only British testimony , but also Dedé 's own insistence on the night of the battle that he had not seen any other ships during the action . Historian William James suggests that this was a deliberate attempt to appeal to the French naval authorities to avoid responsibility for the defeat . 
 The failure of the supplies and reinforcements carried on Thétis to reach the Caribbean may have had an effect on the outcome of the subsequent invasion of Martinique in January 1809 . Except for one reinforcement frigate , Amphitrite , none of the subsequent French efforts to transport supplies or soldiers to Martinique were successful , and a large British expeditionary force was able to overwhelm the island 's poorly @-@ supplied defenders in a brief campaign . The tightening blockade also affected other French colonies , preventing the despatch of food and military supplies and contributing to the captures of both Île de France and Guadeloupe in 1810 . 
 = 2000 Sri Lanka cyclone = 
 The 2000 Sri Lanka cyclone ( IMD designation : BOB 06 JTWC designation : 04B ) was the strongest tropical cyclone to strike Sri Lanka since 1978 . The fourth tropical storm and the second severe cyclonic storm of the 2000 North Indian Ocean cyclone season , it developed from an area of disturbed weather on December 25 , 2000 . It moved westward , and quickly strengthened under favorable conditions to reach top wind speeds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . The cyclone hit eastern Sri Lanka at peak strength , then weakened slightly while crossing the island before hitting and dissipating over southern India on December 28 . 
 The storm was the first cyclone over Sri Lanka with winds of at least hurricane strength since a 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) cyclone hit in the 1978 season , as well as the first tropical storm to hit the island since 1992 . The storm was also the first December tropical cyclone of hurricane intensity in the Bay of Bengal since 1996 . It produced heavy rainfall and strong winds , damaging or destroying tens of thousands of houses and leaving up to 500 @,@ 000 homeless . At least nine people died as a result of the cyclone . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 An area of atmospheric convection developed and persisted on December 21 in the central Bay of Bengal forming within an active near @-@ equatorial trough . Located within an area of weak vertical wind shear , the system steadily organized , and after initially remaining nearly stationary it began to move slowly westward . Deep convection continued to develop , and on December 23 a mid @-@ level circulation began to form . Later that day , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert . By the night of the December 23 , a low @-@ level circulation developed in the system , located to the south of the deep convection . The disturbance continued to organize , with the India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) classifying it as a deep depression early on December 24 . Later that day , the organization of the system degraded slightly , though it quickly reorganized . On December 25 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 04B while it was located about 155 miles ( 250 km ) east of Sri Lanka . On the center 's first advisory , the tropical storm was drifting west @-@ northwest at 3 mph ( 5 km / h ) with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph ( 70 km / h ) . Shortly thereafter , the IMD upgraded the deep depression to a cyclonic storm as a central dense overcast developed over the center . 
 A subtropical ridge to the north of the cyclone resulted in it continuing generally westward . Deep convection continued to develop over the center of circulation , and the storm steadily strengthened as outflow improved throughout the circulation . By late on December 25 , a rainband wrapped tightly into the center , and it intensified into a severe cyclonic storm as it approached the coast of Sri Lanka . The next day the cyclone developed an eye as it turned west @-@ southwestward . On December 26 , the cyclone made landfall on near Trincomalee , Sri Lanka . The JTWC assessed the cyclone as attaining peak winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . However , the IMD estimated the cyclone reached a maximum intensity of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) , making it a very severe cyclonic storm . It weakened slightly over land and emerged into the Gulf of Mannar early on December 27 as a tropical storm . Initially , forecasters predicted it to slowly re @-@ intensify ; instead it weakened as its convection degraded in organization and intensity . After turning west @-@ northwestward , the storm struck southern India near Kanyakumari on December 28 with winds of 45 mph ( 70 km / h ) , with minimal convection due to land interaction and increased wind shear . It rapidly weakened to tropical depression status over land , and its remnants degenerated into a low pressure area after emerging into the eastern Arabian Sea early on December 29 .

 Government officials in Sri Lanka issued a last @-@ minute evacuation order for potentially affected areas , though few received the evacuation order . The cyclone hit the eastern and western coastlines with powerful waves , wrecking 25 fishing boats in eastern coastal towns and washing away 109 boats near Puttalam . Eight people were left missing and feared dead . The cyclone was accompanied with a storm surge as made landfall that flooded areas up to 330 feet ( 100 m ) inland . While crossing the country , the cyclone dropped between 4 and 8 inches ( 100 to 200 mm ) of precipitation , compounding the effects of severe monsoonal flooding from the previous month . Wind gusts from the cyclone reached 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) near where it made landfall . 
 The area most affected by the cyclone was in and around Trincomalee : 57 people checked into the local hospital as a result of falling trees or debris , with one person killed due to a falling tree . An entire fishing village was completely destroyed , and heavy rainfall flooded rivers , lakes , and canals , covering roads and crops with floodwaters . The flooding destroyed about 77 square miles ( 200 km ² ) of rice fields , and an additional 19 square miles ( 50 km ² ) of other crops . Strong winds damaged or destroyed around 83 @,@ 000 houses across the country , including 2 @,@ 000 houses destroyed in <unk> and 6 @,@ 600 in Trincomalee . The passage of the cyclone left up to 500 @,@ 000 temporarily homeless on the island , most of whom fled to churches , schools , temples , and shopping centers . The winds blew off the roofs of several police stations and military camps , and flooded several refugee camps . The winds damaged electrical systems and disrupted about 3 @,@ 000 telephone systems , and many roads were left impassable . Large areas remained without power for several days . No damage reports exist for regions under control of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , despite the fact the storm made landfall there . Throughout the country , at least nine people died as a result of the cyclone , and over 48 @,@ 000 families were affected . 
 Prior to the arrival of the storm in India , government officials there issued a severe storm warning for Thoothukudi District , and also warned fishermen not to go out to sea . Thousands were evacuated to emergency shelters prior to the storm 's arrival . The cyclone produced rough surf along the southern Indian coast , and heavy rainfall in and around Thoothukudi , causing flooding in a few low @-@ lying areas . The rainfall caused some damage to banana crops , uprooted several trees , and left some roads impassable , but was largely beneficial in alleviating drought conditions . Across southern India , the cyclone damaged 749 houses and destroyed 81 more , but no deaths were reported in the country .

 Sri Lanka governmental aid was slow at first , with the media criticizing the government for its initial response . A street protest occurred in Trincomalee due to lack of aid . Prime Minister <unk> <unk> organized a meeting of government officials to propose an increase in relief funds . A family of five or more received $ 5 @.@ 50 a week ( 2000 USD , ( $ 7 @.@ 56 2016 USD ) , 500 in 2000 LKR ) for dry rations , while the families of those who died received $ 183 ( 2000 USD , $ 251 @.@ 46 2016 USD , 15 thousand 2000 LKR ) in compensation . The government also gave $ 122 ( 2000 USD , ( $ 167 @.@ 64 2016 USD , 10 thousand 2000 LKR ) ) to those whose houses were damaged or destroyed , and delivered rice rations to those stranded , while state @-@ organized radio broadcasts appealed for donations . 
 Within two days of the cyclone striking , the Sri Lankan Red Cross began an operation with 4 @,@ 000 volunteers to help those most badly affected . The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies issued a preliminary appeal for $ 323 @,@ 000 2000 USD ( $ 519 thousand 2016 USD , $ 525 thousand in 2000 CHF ) to assist about 10 @,@ 000 people by making blankets , shelter , food , and kitchen utensils available .

 The character of Ste was originally a background character , who was cast by David Hanson for only seven episodes . Upon completion of his initial short stint , new producer Bryan Kirkwood decided to bring the character back for another handful of episodes in October 2006 in which Ste fled the scene of a car accident involving Amy Barnes ( Ashley Slanina @-@ Davies ) . Following positive viewer feedback after this second stint , Kirkwood asked Richardson to reprise the role on a permanent basis beginning 26 September 2007 . 
 In 2010 , speculation arose that Richardson would leave the show , due to his participation in ITV ice skating competition Dancing on Ice . Richardson said " I 'm not leaving , I 'm staying put " . He added his participation in the reality television series was for " fun " , and stating : " I still want to stay at Hollyoaks and progress in my career there " because he did not think he was a good enough actor to pursue other projects . However , he later revealed he was not sure executive producer Paul Marquess would renew his contract . In November 2010 , Richardson commented on his future with the show , branding it a new era and thankful to be part of it . Richardson stated : " Marquess loved everything I 've been doing and wanted to keep me on . I 'm hoping to stick with the show no matter what . "

 When Ste was introduced on Hollyoaks , he was introduced as a violent and rebellious teenager who was often in trouble . He bullied several of his peers , including Josh Ashworth ( Sonny Flood ) , Jamie " Fletch " Fletcher ( Sam Darbyshire ) and Nicole Owen ( Ciara Janson ) . His troublesome personality continued as he became a drug dealer , stole money and began hitting Amy . During 2009 , Ste 's persona improved when he became a single father to Lucas Hay ( Jude ) and Amy 's daughter to a previous relationship , Leah ( Jessica Croft @-@ Lane ) after she developed post @-@ natal depression . Ste began working in restaurant Il Gnosh to earn money for his children , showing that the character had matured . 
 In 2010 , Richardson revealed that executive producer Lucy Allan was going to return Ste to his " bad " ways . Richardson said that Ste had portrayed the whole " bad thing " and mellowed . He felt Ste was emulating fellow character Tony Hutchinson ( Nick Pickard ) , because Ste was " running a restaurant , camping it up like him and talking like him " . Allan wanted to change that and see him regain some old habits . These changes did not happen because Allan quit her position soon after . 
 Richardson later told Inside Soap that he hated Ste when he first joined the show , adding : " When he came into the show Ste was a bit of a skater boy , and I hated that . " Richardson would recite his lines in " a sinister way and do under @-@ the @-@ eyebrows stuff " , which Richardson felt inspired the writers to develop Ste 's character more deeply .

 Returning later in 2007 , Ste and Amy eventually got back together . The pair moved into their own flat , to the dismay of Amy 's father Mike Barnes ( Tony Hirst ) . Despite this , Ste became increasingly violent and started to hit Amy , on one occasion even cutting off her ponytail . Slanina @-@ Davis raised money from hair cut during the scene in aid the cancer charity CLIC <unk> . At this time , Amy became pregnant , but was unsure whether to keep the baby . Speaking about 2008 as a whole for Ste and Amy , producer Bryan Kirkwood said he was proud of the way Richardson had portrayed Ste in a sympathetic manner so viewers could understand - but not condone his behaviour . He thought he and Slanina @-@ Davies delivered brilliant performances portraying the " reality of so many 16 @-@ 17 @-@ year @-@ olds " , struggling to make a life for themselves . He felt some of their scenes were " downright shocking " . Eventually , Amy decides to accept the help of her friends and family and leaves Ste for abusing her . 
 Whilst the storyline aired , Richardson and Slanina @-@ Davies fronted a charity campaign called " Expect Respect " in order to combat domestic violence . At the time Richardson released a statement opining domestic violence affects many young people in any form of life . He stated he could imagine " how frightening it would be to have him as a boyfriend " and condemned his " violence and bullying " because it is always unacceptable . " 
 During April 2009 , Amy gave birth to Lucas , and subsequently left due to post @-@ natal depression . Ste was left looking after both Lucas , and Amy 's daughter Leah . A couple , Abi Raven ( Elaine Glover ) and Daniel Raven ( Chris Hargreaves ) befriended Ste and tried to convince him that he was a good father , and that he did not need Amy in their lives . However , Abi and Daniel planned to kidnap Lucas , at first in order to keep him and then later on to give him to another family . Richardson expressed to Digital Spy his pleasure with this storyline , saying , " It 's getting quite dark . " He was also shocked with its entertaining and unexpected ending . " When the storyline came to its climax , Abi and Daniel tried to take Lucas , but they were stopped . 
 Ste told Amy 's father Mike to look after Lucas and Leah in the aftermath of the baby plot because he didn 't think he was a good father . Richardson reported that he enjoyed working with Jude and Jessica Croft @-@ Lane , the young actors who played Lucas and Leah . He reported that Jude was camera shy and liked to play with camera equipment during filming and that he told Croft @-@ Lane that his name was actually Ste . Richardson concluded the storyline was different and he felt it gave him a chance to showcase his acting abilities .

 During an interview on This Morning , Kieron Richardson revealed he was gay , and that Ste would explore his sexuality and come out as gay after embarking on a dangerous affair with his boss Brendan Brady ( Emmett J. Scanlan ) . Ste saw a nicer side to Brendan and they formed an " unusual friendship , " which eventually lead to having a wild lads night out and a drunken kiss . Brendan rejected Ste , giving into passion later , they kiss again . But the storyline took a dark twist when Ste was beaten badly . 
 During an interview , series producer Paul Marquess , he described it as a long running storyline , adding : " It is dark to begin with , the lessons that Ste learns are ultimately positive and life affirming . " He also felt it was about not " being afraid of who you are " and Ste was " refreshingly accepting " of his feelings towards a man . Richardson revealed he was shocked to discover the details of the plot . He felt it was interesting to see how Ste coped with the being the victim of domestic violence . 
 Ste comes out to ex @-@ girlfriend Amy first . During their conversation Ste <unk> Amy was the only girl he really hade feelings for and that his confusion over his sexuality was not the reason for him abusing her during their relation ship . Ste is very relieved by Amy 's good reaction . Amy is the one who discovers that Brendan is hitting Ste and she tells Ste to break it off , reminding him of how it was when he was hitting her . 
 Richard admitted his initial fears of the portrayal because he felt it was a taboo subject . He had difficulties portraying it initially , this was because he was not familiar with the subject . " The storyline had not been tackled in British soap opera before and Richardson felt Ste was " making television history " . He then explained how the storyline differs from other soap operas because " Ste doesn 't question his sexuality and it 's not about a struggle — it 's about domestic abuse in a gay relationship . " Richardson also stated because of the plots dark nature , he hoped viewers would be " drawn into it " . He branded the storyline as unpredictable because viewers never know if Brendan was going kiss or hit Ste . 
 A spokesperson for Hollyoaks confirmed that Ste didn 't realise " how much power and control Brendan was wielding over him " . This was because Ste was still coming to terms with his sexuality . Ste felt a connection he never felt before because he hadn 't had another male partner . Brendan manipulated Ste into believing he was to blame for Brendan 's anger . The representative said this was why he ended up apologising . The storyline also aimed to shock viewers with the " dark depths " Brendan would go to in order to control Ste . Marquess later stated that Brendan 's past would be explained and that everyone should remember it was Ste who used to hit Amy first , adding : " So it 's a dark and interwoven story made all the more complicated by the introduction of a new love interest for Ste " .

 In early 2011 Marquess revealed that Ste would have a new boyfriend . This would help create another " classic triangle " storyline . It was then revealed that new gay character Noah Baxter ( Law Thompson ) would befriend Ste . Noah 's friend Cindy Cunningham ( Stephanie Waring ) decides to help the pair start a relationship . Waring said Cindy does not care about Ste and Noah and she sees them as " the only gays in the village " . Waring concluded that she thrives off the attention and gossip their romance generates for her . However Richardson said that despite his new relationship he is still " madly " in love with Brendan . Ultimately he stated " He may care for Noah , but he will always run back to Brendan " .

 Ste was originally portrayed as being a smart loner who kept to himself , with a cool older brother who taught him how to drive cars . It was later shown that his loneliness was just an act to get girls to sleep with him and that he was not really intelligent .

 Holy Soap opined Ste 's most memorable moment stating : " Sadly , it 's beating up girlfriend Amy . " The fatherhood and baby snatch storyline received mixed reviews from viewers . Digital Spy posted a poll asking readers whether they thought the plot was anti @-@ climactic . 76 @.@ 6 % of voters thought it was truly anti @-@ climactic , whilst the rest thought otherwise . 
 After Richardson came out on This Morning , Dennis Ayers , writing for gay men 's news website AfterElton.com , criticised the revelation , believing it to be for promotional purposes only . Whilst acknowledging Ste as being a " violent bully , a domestic abuser , and a single father " , Ayers could see nothing in Ste 's " dark past hinted that he might be gay . " In spite of his criticism , he praised Richardson for coming out as gay . Anthony D. Langford , also writing for AfterElton , who avidly followed the plot , felt shocked when he witnessed Brendan attacking Ste . He moped there was worse to come and found it compelling viewing . He also did not perceive it as a romantic story stating : " Ste and Brendan 's scenes do have an element of sexual allure since the actors have chemistry , but there 's too much darkness and manipulation on the edges of every scene to make real romance even possible " . He also gave credit to the show for its slow build up over a few months . After Rae became pregnant All About Soap said : " Crikey , at this rate Mr Hay will soon be giving Walford 's Jack Branning a run for his money for the Most fertile Man in Soapland award ! "

She later said the serial was brave for tackling gay domestic violence . She opined that Richardson gave an " incredible performance " and felt she was not alone in perceiving the storyline to be " deeply disturbing " and " deeply moving " . She later expressed her view that " Ste hasn ’ t experienced much normality in his young life " . She concluded that Ste never seemed to have a trouble free day . The Liverpool Daily Post said " You know you 're not flavour of the month when even Ste Hay looks down his nose at you . " 
 = USS Iowa ( BB @-@ 61 ) = 
 USS Iowa ( BB @-@ 61 ) is the lead ship of her class of battleship and the fourth in the United States Navy to be named in honor of the state of Iowa . Owing to the cancellation of the Montana @-@ class battleships , Iowa is the last lead ship of any class of United States battleships and was the only ship of her class to have served in the Atlantic Ocean during World War II . 
 During World War II , she carried President Franklin D. Roosevelt across the Atlantic to Mers El Kébir , Algeria , en route to a crucial 1943 meeting in Tehran with Prime Minister Winston Churchill of Britain and Josef Stalin , leader of the Soviet Union . She has a bathtub — an amenity installed for Roosevelt , along with an elevator to shuttle him between decks . When transferred to the Pacific Fleet in 1944 , Iowa shelled beachheads at Kwajalein and Eniwetok in advance of Allied amphibious landings and screened aircraft carriers operating in the Marshall Islands . She also served as the Third Fleet flagship , flying Adm. William F. Halsey 's flag at the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay . During the Korean War , Iowa was involved in raids on the North Korean coast , after which she was decommissioned into the United States Navy reserve fleets , better known as the " mothball fleet . " She was reactivated in 1984 as part of the 600 @-@ ship Navy plan and operated in both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets to counter the recently expanded Soviet Navy . In April 1989 , an explosion of undetermined origin wrecked her No. 2 gun turret , killing 47 sailors . 
 The Iowa was decommissioned for the last time in the year 1990 , and was initially stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in 1995 . She was reinstated from 1999 to 2006 to comply with federal laws that required retention and maintenance of two Iowa @-@ class battleships . In 2011 USS Iowa was donated to the Los Angeles – based non @-@ profit Pacific Battleship Center and was permanently moved to Berth 87 at the Port of Los Angeles in 2012 , where she was opened to the public as the USS Iowa Museum . 
 = = Construction = = 
 USS Iowa was the lead ship of her class of " fast battleship " designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the Bureau of Construction and Repair . She was launched on 27 August 1942 which First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt attended and was sponsored by native Iowan Ilo Wallace ( wife of Vice President Henry Wallace ) , and commissioned on 22 February 1943 with Captain John L. McCrea in command . She was the first ship of her class of battleship to be commissioned . 
 USS Iowa 's main battery consisted of nine 16 in ( 406 mm ) / 50 caliber Mark 7 guns , which could fire 2 @,@ 700 lb ( 1 @,@ 200 kg ) armor @-@ piercing shells 20 nmi ( 23 mi ; 37 km ) . Her secondary battery consisted of twenty 5 in ( 130 mm ) / 38 cal guns in twin mounts , which could fire at targets up to 12 nmi ( 14 mi ; 22 km ) away . With the advent of air power and the need to gain and maintain air superiority came a need to protect the growing fleet of Allied aircraft carriers ; to this end , Iowa was fitted with an array of Oerlikon 20 mm and Bofors 40 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns to defend Allied carriers from enemy airstrikes .

 = = = Shakedown and service with the Atlantic Fleet = = = 
 On 24 February 1943 , Iowa put to sea for a shakedown in the Chesapeake Bay and along the Atlantic coast . She got underway on 27 August for Argentia , Newfoundland , to counter the threat of the German battleship Tirpitz which was reportedly operating in Norwegian waters , before returning to the United States on 25 October for two weeks of maintenance at the Norfolk Navy Yard . 
 After refueling and gathering her escorts , Iowa carried President Roosevelt , Secretary of State Cordell Hull , Chief of Staff Admiral William D. Leahy , Chief of Staff of the Army General George C. Marshall , Chief of Naval Operations Ernest King , Commanding General of the U.S. Army Air Forces Henry " Hap " Arnold , Harry Hopkins , and other World War II military brass to Mers El Kébir , Algeria , on the first leg of the journey to the Tehran Conference . Among the vessels escorting Iowa on this trip was the destroyer William D. Porter which was involved in several mishaps , the most serious of which involved a torpedo drill which went awry when a torpedo from William D. Porter discharged from its tube and headed toward Iowa . On being warned , Iowa turned hard to avoid being hit by the torpedo and the torpedo detonated in the ship 's wake . Iowa was unhurt and trained her main guns on William D. Porter , concerned that the smaller ship may have been involved in some sort of assassination plot . 
 Iowa completed her presidential escort mission on 16 December by returning the President to the United States . Roosevelt addressed the crew of Iowa prior to leaving by stating , " ... from all I have seen and all I have heard , the Iowa is a ' happy ship , ' and having served with the Navy for many years , I know — and you know — what that means . " He also touched on the progress made at the conference before concluding his address with " ... good luck , and remember that I am with you in spirit , each and every one of you . " 
 = = = Service with Battleship Division 7 , Admiral Lee = = = 
 As flagship of Battleship Division 7 ( BatDiv 7 ) , Iowa departed the United States on 2 January 1944 for the Pacific Ocean , transiting the Panama Canal on 7 January in advance of her combat debut in the campaign for the Marshall Islands . From 29 January to 3 February , she supported carrier air strikes made by Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman 's Task Group 38 @.@ 3 ( TG 38 @.@ 3 ) against Kwajalein and Eniwetok atolls . Her next assignment was to support air strikes against the major Japanese naval and logistics base at Truk , Caroline Islands . Iowa , in company with other ships , was detached from the support group on 16 February 1944 to conduct an anti @-@ shipping sweep around Truk , with the objective of destroying enemy naval vessels escaping to the north . On 21 February , she was underway with the Fast Carrier Task Force ( TF 58 or TF 38 , depending on whether it was part of the 5th Fleet or 3rd Fleet ) while it conducted the first strikes against Saipan , Tinian , Rota , and Guam in the Mariana Islands . During this action , Iowa , along with her sister New Jersey , sank the Japanese light cruiser Katori , the cruiser having escaped Truk the day before following Operation Hailstone , the US air attack on Truk . 
 On 18 March 1944 , Iowa , flying the flag of Vice Admiral Willis A. Lee ( Commander Battleships , Pacific ) , joined in the bombardment of Mili Atoll in the Marshall Islands . Although struck by two Japanese 4 @.@ 7 in ( 120 mm ) projectiles , Iowa suffered negligible damage . She then rejoined TF 58 on 30 March , and supported air strikes against the Palau Islands and Woleai of the Carolines for several days . 
 From 22 – 28 April , Iowa supported air raids on Hollandia ( now known as Jayapura ) , Aitape , and Wake Islands to support Army forces on Aitape and at Tanahmerah and Humboldt Bays in New Guinea . She then joined the Task Force 's second strike on Truk , on 29 and 30 April , and bombarded Japanese facilities on Ponape in the Carolines on 1 May . 
 In the opening phases of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign , Iowa protected the American carriers during air strikes on the islands of Saipan , Tinian , Guam , Rota , and Pagan Island on 12 June . Iowa was then detached to bombard enemy installations on Saipan and Tinian on 13 – 14 June , which resulted in the destruction of a Japanese ammunition dump . On 19 June , in an engagement known as the Battle of the Philippine Sea , Iowa , as part of the battle line of TF 58 , helped repel four massive air raids launched by the Japanese Middle Fleet . This resulted in the almost complete destruction of Japanese carrier @-@ based air @-@ forces , with Iowa claiming the destruction of three enemy aircraft . Iowa then joined in the pursuit of the fleeing enemy fleet , shooting down one torpedo plane and assisting in splashing another . 
 Throughout July , Iowa remained off the Marianas supporting air strikes on the Palaus and landings on Guam . After a month 's rest , Iowa sailed from Eniwetok as part of the Third Fleet , and helped support the landings on Peleliu on 17 September . She then protected the carriers during air strikes against the Central Philippines to neutralize enemy air power for the long awaited invasion of the Philippines . On 10 October , Iowa arrived off Okinawa for a series of air strikes on the Ryukyu Islands and Formosa . She then supported air strikes against Luzon on 18 October and continued this duty during General Douglas MacArthur 's landing on Leyte on 20 October . 
 In a last @-@ ditch attempt to halt the United States campaign to recapture the Philippines , the Imperial Japanese Navy struck back with Shō @-@ Gō 1 , a three @-@ pronged attack aimed at the destruction of American amphibious forces in Leyte Gulf . The plan called for Vice @-@ Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa to use the surviving Japanese carriers as bait to draw US carriers of TF 38 away from the Philippine beachheads , allowing Imperial Japanese Admirals Takeo Kurita , Kiyohide Shima , and Shōji Nishimura to take surface task forces through the San Bernardino Strait and Surigao Strait , where they would rendezvous and attack the US beachheads . Iowa accompanied TF 38 during attacks against the Japanese Central Force under the command of Admiral Kurita as it steamed through the Sibuyan Sea toward San Bernardino Strait . The reported results of these attacks and the apparent retreat of the Japanese Central Force led Admiral William " Bull " Halsey to believe that this force had been ruined as an effective fighting group ; as a result , Iowa , with TF 38 , steamed after the Japanese Northern Force off Cape Engaño , Luzon . On 25 October 1944 , when the ships of the Northern Force were almost within range of Iowa 's guns , word arrived that the Japanese Central Force was attacking a group of American escort carriers off Samar . This threat to the American beachheads forced TF 38 to reverse course and steam to support the vulnerable escort carrier fleet . However , the fierce resistance put up by the 7th Fleet in the Battle off Samar had already caused the Japanese to retire and Iowa was denied a surface action . Following the Battle of Leyte Gulf , Iowa remained in the waters off the Philippines screening carriers during strikes against Luzon and Formosa . She sailed for the West Coast late in December 1944 . 
 On 18 December , the ships of TF 38 unexpectedly found themselves in a fight for their lives when Typhoon Cobra overtook the force — seven fleet carriers , six light carriers , eight battleships , 15 cruisers , and about 50 destroyers — during their attempt to refuel at sea . At the time , the ships were operating about 300 mi ( 480 km ) east of Luzon in the Philippine Sea . The carriers had just completed three days of heavy raids against Japanese airfields , suppressing enemy aircraft during the American amphibious operations against Mindoro in the Philippines . The task force rendezvoused with Captain Jasper T. Acuff and his fueling group on 17 December with the intention of refueling all ships in the task force and replacing lost aircraft . Although the sea had been growing rougher all day , the nearby cyclonic disturbance gave relatively little warning of its approach . On 18 December , the small but violent typhoon overtook the task force while many of the ships were attempting to refuel . Many of the vessels were caught near the center of the storm and buffeted by extreme seas and hurricane @-@ force winds . Three destroyers – Hull , Monaghan , and Spence – capsized and sank with nearly all hands , while a cruiser , five aircraft carriers , and three destroyers suffered serious damage . Approximately 790 officers and men were lost or killed , with another 80 injured . Fires occurred in three carriers when planes broke loose in their hangars , and some 146 planes on various ships were swept overboard or damaged beyond economical repair by fires or impacts . Iowa reported zero injured sailors as a result of the typhoon , but suffered a loss of one of her float planes , and damage to one of her shafts . The damaged shaft required Iowa to return to the US , and she arrived at San Francisco on 15 January 1945 , for repairs . During the course of the overhaul Iowa had her bridge area enclosed , and was outfitted with new search radars and fire @-@ control systems .

 Iowa sailed on 19 March 1945 for Okinawa , arriving on 15 April to relieve her sister ship New Jersey . From 24 April , Iowa supported carrier operations which aimed to establish and maintain air superiority for ground forces during their struggle for the island . She then supported air strikes off southern Kyūshū from 25 May to 13 June . Afterward , she sailed toward northern Honshū and Hokkaidō , and participated in strikes on the Japanese home islands on 14 – 15 July by bombarding Muroran , Hokkaidō , destroying steel mills and other targets . The city of Hitachi on Honshū was shelled beginning the night of 17 July and lasting to 18 July . On 29 and 30 July , Iowa trained her guns on Kahoolawe for a bombardment and continued to support fast carrier strikes until the cessation of hostilities on 15 August as a result of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . 
 On 27 August , Iowa and her sister ship Missouri entered Sagami Bay to oversee the surrender of the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal . Two days later , she entered Tokyo Bay with the occupation forces . Here , a number of sailors from the Missouri were temporarily stationed on Iowa for the duration of the surrender ceremony which took place aboard the Missouri . After serving as Admiral Halsey 's flagship for the surrender ceremony on 2 September , Iowa remained in the bay as part of the occupying force . As part of the ongoing Operation Magic Carpet , she received homeward bound GIs and liberated US prisoners of war before departing Tokyo Bay on 20 September , bound for the United States .

 Iowa arrived in Seattle , Washington , on 15 October 1945 , then sailed for Long Beach , California , where she engaged in training operations until returning to Japan in 1946 to serve as flagship for the 5th Fleet . She returned to the United States on 25 March 1946 and resumed her role as a training ship . During her usual routine of drills and maneuvers she also embarked Naval Reserve elements and midshipmen for training . In October , Iowa underwent a period of overhaul and modernization , which resulted in the addition of the SK @-@ 2 Radar and the loss of a number of 20 mm and 40 mm gun mounts . In July , following the Bikini atomic experiments , the old battleship Nevada was selected as a target for a live fire exercise to be carried out by Iowa and other sea and air assets of the navy . The exercise began with separate <unk> from a destroyer , heavy cruiser , and Iowa , but this did not sink the ship , and so Nevada was finished off with one aerial torpedo hit amidships , sinking her 65 mi ( 105 km ) from Pearl Harbor on 31 July 1948 . In September 1948 , as part of the post World War II draw down of the armed forces , Iowa was inactivated at San Francisco and formally decommissioned into the United States Navy reserve fleets on 24 March 1949 . 
 = = Korean War ( 1951 – 52 ) = = 
 In 1950 , North Korea invaded South Korea , prompting NATO members , including the United States , to intervene in the name of the United Nations . President Harry S. Truman was caught off guard when the invasion struck , but he quickly ordered US forces stationed in Japan to transfer to South Korea . Truman also sent US based troops , tanks , fighter and bomber aircraft , and a strong naval force to the area to support South Korea . As part of the naval mobilization , Iowa was reactivated on 14 July 1951 , and formally recommissioned on 25 August , with Captain William R. <unk> , III , in command . Iowa sailed for Korean waters in March 1952 . On 1 April she relieved her sister ship USS Wisconsin ( BB @-@ 64 ) and became the flagship of Vice Admiral Robert P. Briscoe , Commander of the Seventh Fleet . In her first combat operation of the Korean War , Iowa fired her main guns near Wonsan @-@ Sŏngjin on 8 April 1952 , with the goal of striking North Korean supply lines . In the company of other naval vessels Iowa again engaged North Korean forces the following day , this time against enemy troop concentrations , supply areas , and suspected gun positions in and around Suwon Dan and Kojo . In support of South Korea 's I Corps , Iowa shelled enemy positions on 13 April , killing 100 enemy soldiers , destroying six gun emplacements , and wrecking a division headquarters . The next day she entered Wonsan Harbor and shelled warehouses , observation posts and railroad marshaling yards before moving out to rejoin the UN flotilla aiding ground forces around Kosong . On 20 April , in her first combat action above the 38th parallel , Iowa shelled railroad lines at Tanchon , where four railroad tunnels were destroyed , before sailing to Chindong and Kosong for a two @-@ day bombardment of North Korean positions . 
 On 25 May Iowa , following her sister ship Missouri 's example , arrived in the waters off Chongjin , a North Korean industrial center approximately 48 nmi ( 55 mi ; 89 km ) from the Russian border . Upon arrival , Iowa proceeded to shell the industrial and rail transportation centers in Chongjin , after which she moved south to aid the US X Corps . En route to US positions , Iowa again bombarded Sŏngjin , destroying several railroad tunnels and bridges in the area . On 28 May , Iowa rejoined the main body of the US fleet supporting the X Corps , heavily shelling several islands in Wonsan Harbor . 
 Throughout June , Iowa trained her guns on targets at <unk> @-@ do , Tanchon , Chongjin , <unk> @-@ <unk> and the ports of <unk> and Wonsan in support of the UN and South Korean forces . On 9 June , a helicopter from Iowa rescued a downed pilot from the carrier Princeton . At the time , Princeton was operating with TF 77 , and with other carriers in the task force who were involved in a bombing campaign against North Korean supply lines , troop concentrations , and infrastructure ; additionally , the carriers were flying close air support missions for ground forces fighting against the North Korean forces . In July , Iowa received a new skipper , Captain Joshua W. Cooper , who assumed command of the battleship for the remainder of her Korean War tour . 
 On 20 August , Iowa took aboard nine wounded men from the destroyer Thompson after Thompson was hit by a Chinese artillery battery while shelling enemy positions at Sŏngjin . At the time , Iowa was operating 16 mi ( 26 km ) south of Sŏngjin , and after receiving the wounded destroyer crewmen , Iowa covered Thompson as she retreated into safer waters . 
 On 23 September , General Mark W. Clark , the Commander @-@ In @-@ Chief of United Nations Forces in Korea , came aboard Iowa . Clark observed Iowa in action as her guns shelled the Wonsan area for a third time , accounting for the destruction of a major enemy ammunition dump . On 25 September , Iowa fired her guns at an enemy railroad and 30 @-@ car train . The following month , Iowa was part of the force involved in Operation Decoy , a feint to draw enemy troops into Kojo and bring them within striking distance of the battleships ' big guns . During the operation , Iowa provided anti @-@ aircraft support to Mount McKinley , an amphibious force command ship .

 Iowa embarked midshipmen for at @-@ sea training to Northern Europe in July 1953 , and shortly afterwards took part in Operation Mariner , a major NATO exercise , serving as flagship of Vice Admiral Edmund T. Wooldridge , commander of the 2nd Fleet . Upon completion of this exercise , Iowa operated in the Virginia Capes area . Later , in September 1954 , she became the flagship of Rear Admiral R. E. Libby , Commander , Battleship Cruiser Force , United States Atlantic Fleet . 
 From January – April 1955 , Iowa made an extended cruise to the Mediterranean Sea as the flagship of the Commander , 6th Fleet . She departed on a midshipman training cruise on 1 June , and upon her return entered Norfolk for a four @-@ month overhaul . Afterward , Iowa continued intermittent training cruises and operational exercises , until 4 January 1957 when she departed Norfolk for duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean . Upon completion , Iowa embarked midshipmen for a South American training cruise and joined in the International Naval Review off Hampton Roads , Virginia on 13 June . 
 On 3 September , Iowa sailed for Scotland for NATO 's Operation <unk> . She returned to Norfolk on 28 September , and departed Hampton Roads for the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 22 October . She was decommissioned on 24 February 1958 and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia . 
 = = Reactivation ( 1982 – 84 ) = = 
 As part of President Ronald Reagan 's and Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman 's effort to create an expanded 600 @-@ ship Navy , Iowa was reactivated and moved under tow to Avondale Shipyard near New Orleans , Louisiana , for refitting and equipment modernization in advance of her planned recommissioning . During the refit , Iowa had all of her remaining Oerlikon 20 mm and Bofors 40 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns removed , due to their ineffectiveness against modern fighter jets and anti @-@ ship missiles . Additionally , the two 5 in ( 130 mm ) gun mounts located at mid @-@ ship and in the aft on the port and starboard sides of the battleship were removed . 
 Iowa was then towed to Ingalls Shipbuilding , Pascagoula , Mississippi , where over the next several months the battleship was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available . Among the new weapons systems installed were four MK 141 quad cell launchers for 16 AGM @-@ 84 Harpoon anti @-@ ship missiles , eight Armored Box Launcher mounts for 32 BGM @-@ 109 Tomahawk missiles , and a quartet of Phalanx Close @-@ in weapon system Gatling guns for defense against enemy anti @-@ ship missiles and enemy aircraft . Iowa was the first battleship to receive the RQ @-@ 2 Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle . She could carry up to eight of the remotely controlled drones , which replaced the helicopters previously used to spot for her nine 16 inch ( 410 mm ) / 50 cal Mark 7 guns . Also included in her modernization were upgrades to radar and fire @-@ control systems for her guns and missiles , and improved electronic warfare capabilities . Armed as such , Iowa was formally recommissioned on 28 April 1984 , ahead of schedule , within her budget at a cost of $ 500 million , and under the command of Captain Gerald E. <unk> . In order to expedite the schedule , many necessary repairs to Iowa 's engines and guns were not completed and the mandatory Navy Board of Inspection and Survey ( InSurv ) inspection was skipped . 
 = = = Shakedown and NATO exercises ( 1984 – 89 ) = = = 
 From April – August 1984 , Iowa underwent refresher training and naval gunfire support qualifications in the Atlantic Ocean . She spent the rest of 1984 on a shakedown cruise in the area around Central America . During this cruise she aided in several humanitarian operations , including in Costa Rica and Honduras , before returning to the United States in April 1985 for a period of routine maintenance . 
 In August 1985 , Iowa joined 160 other ships for Exercise Ocean Safari , a NATO naval exercise aimed at testing NATO 's ability to control sea lanes and maintain free passage of shipping . Owing to bad weather , Iowa and the other ships were forced to ride out rough seas , but Iowa made use of the time to practice hiding herself from enemy forces . While serving with the exercise force , Iowa crossed the Arctic Circle . In October , she took part in Baltic operations , and fired her phalanx guns , 5 in ( 130 mm ) guns , and 16 in ( 410 mm ) guns in the Baltic Sea on 17 October while operating with US and other allied ships . After these operations she returned to the United States . 
 Beginning on 17 March 1986 , Iowa underwent her overdue InSurv inspection . The inspection , which Iowa ultimately failed , was conducted under the supervision of Rear Admiral John D. Bulkeley . Bulkeley found that the ship was unable to achieve her top speed of 33 kn ( 38 mph ; 61 km / h ) during a full @-@ power engine run , and recommended to the Chief of Naval Operations and Lehman that Iowa be taken out of service immediately . Rejecting this advice , Lehman instead instructed the leaders of the Atlantic Fleet to ensure that Iowa 's deficiencies were corrected . 
 Afterward , Iowa returned to the waters around Central America and conducted drills and exercises while providing a military presence to friendly nations . On 4 July , President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan boarded Iowa for the International Naval Review , which was held in the Hudson River . On 25 April , <unk> Larry Ray Seaquist assumed command of the battleship and her crew . 
 On 17 August , Iowa set sail for the North Atlantic , and in September she participated in Exercise Northern Wedding by ferrying Marines ashore and assisting helicopter gunships . During the exercise Iowa fired her main guns at Cape Wrath range in Scotland in support of a simulated amphibious assault on 5 – 6 September , firing a total of 19 16 @-@ inch ( 410 mm ) shells and 32 5 @-@ inch ( 130 mm ) shells during a 10 @-@ hour period and operating in rough seas . During the live fire exercise , a small number of Iowa marines were put ashore to monitor the fall of shot and advise the battleship of gunnery corrections . Afterward , Iowa visited ports in England and Germany before returning to the United States in October . 
 In December , the ship became the testbed for the Navy 's RQ @-@ 2 Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle ( UAV ) . The drone was designed to serve as an aerial spotter for the battleship 's guns , thereby allowing the guns to be used against an enemy without the need for an airplane or helicopter spotter . Pioneer passed its tests and made its first deployment that same month aboard Iowa . 
 From January – September 1987 Iowa operated in the waters in and around Central America and participated in several exercises until sailing for the Mediterranean Sea on 10 September to join the 6th Fleet based there . She remained in the Mediterranean until 22 October , when she was detached from the 6th Fleet and departed for operations in the North Sea . On 25 November , as part of Operation Earnest Will , Iowa transited the Suez Canal and set sail for the Persian Gulf , which at the time was one of the battlefields of the first Gulf War ( also referred to as the Iran – Iraq War ) . The presence of US naval vessels in the gulf was in response to a formal petition from Kuwait , whose ships were being raided by Iranian forces who were attempting to cut off weapons shipments from the United States and Europe to Saddam Hussein 's regime in Iraq , via Kuwaiti territory . This phase of the war would later be called the " Tanker War " phase of the Iran @-@ Iraq War . Iowa and other vessels operating in the gulf were assigned to escort Kuwaiti tankers from Kuwaiti ports to the open sea , but because US law forbade military escorts for civilian ships flying a foreign flag , the tankers escorted by the United States were reflagged as US merchant vessels and assigned American names . For the remainder of the year Iowa escorted Kuwaiti gas and oil tankers reflagged as US merchant ships from the Persian Gulf through the Strait of Hormuz . 
 On 20 February 1988 , Iowa departed from the Persian Gulf , transited the Suez Canal , and set sail for the United States , arriving at Norfolk on 10 March for routine maintenance . In April , she participated in the annual Fleet Week celebrations before returning to Norfolk for an overhaul . On 26 May , Fred Moosally replaced Larry Seaquist as Captain of the Iowa . After the overhaul , Moosally took Iowa on a shakedown cruise around Chesapeake Bay on 25 August . Encountering difficulty in conning the ship through shallow water , Moosally narrowly missed colliding with the frigate <unk> , destroyer Farragut , and the cruiser South Carolina before running aground in soft mud outside the bay 's main ship channel near the Thimble Shoals . After one hour , Iowa was able to extricate herself without damage and return to port . Iowa continued with sea trials throughout August and September , then began refresher training in the waters around Florida and Puerto Rico in October , during which the ship passed an Operation Propulsion Program Evaluation . 
 On 20 January 1989 , during an improperly authorized gunnery experiment off Vieques Island , Iowa fired a 16 @-@ inch ( 410 mm ) shell 23 @.@ 4 nmi ( 26 @.@ 9 mi ; 43 @.@ 3 km ) , setting a record for the longest @-@ ranged 16 in ( 410 mm ) shell ever fired . In February , the battleship sailed for New Orleans for a port visit before departing for Norfolk . On 10 April , the battleship was visited by the commander of the 2nd Fleet , and on 13 April she sailed to participate in a fleet exercise . 
 = = = 1989 turret explosion = = = 
 During a gunnery exercise , at <unk> on 19 April 1989 , an explosion ripped through the Number Two 16 @-@ inch ( 410 mm ) gun turret , killing 47 crewmen . A gunner 's mate in the powder magazine room quickly flooded the No. 2 powder magazine , likely preventing catastrophic damage to the ship . At first , Naval Investigative Service ( <unk> , later renamed Naval Criminal Investigative Service or NCIS ) investigators theorized that one of the dead crewmen , Clayton Hartwig , had detonated an explosive device in a suicide attempt after the end of an alleged affair with another sailor . To support this claim , naval officials pointed to several different factors , including Hartwig 's life insurance policy , which named Kendall Truitt as the sole beneficiary in the event of his death , the presence of unexplained materials inside Turret II , and his mental state , which was alleged to be unstable . 
 Although the Navy was satisfied with the investigation and its results , others were unconvinced , and in October 1991 , amid increasing criticism , Congress forced the Navy to reopen the investigation . This second investigation , handled by independent investigators , was hampered by the fact that most of the original debris from Iowa had been cleaned up or otherwise disposed of by the Navy before and after the first investigation , but it did uncover evidence pointing to an accidental powder explosion rather than an intentional act of sabotage . 
 While Iowa was undergoing modernization in the early 1980s , her sister ship New Jersey had been dispatched to Lebanon to provide offshore fire support . At the time , New Jersey was the only commissioned battleship anywhere in the world , and it was found that , in an effort to get another battleship commissioned to relieve New Jersey , the modernization of Iowa was stepped up , leaving her in poor condition when she recommissioned in 1984 . It was also determined that Captain Fred Moosally was more concerned with the maintenance of the missiles than the training and manning of guns . 
 Powder from the same lot as the one under investigation was tested at the Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division . Spontaneous combustion was achieved with the powder , which had been originally milled in the 1930s and improperly stored in a barge at the Navy 's Yorktown , Virginia Naval Weapons Station during a 1988 dry @-@ docking of Iowa . As it degrades , gunpowder gives off ether gas , which is highly flammable and could be ignited by a spark . This revelation resulted in a shift in the Navy 's position on the incident , and Admiral Frank Kelso , the Chief of Naval Operations at the time , publicly apologized to the Hartwig family , concluding that there was no real evidence to support the claim that he had intentionally killed the other sailors . Iowa captain Fred Moosally was severely criticized for his handling of the matter , and as a result of the incident the Navy changed the powder @-@ handling procedures for its battleships . The incident remains one of the surface Navy 's worst losses of life during peacetime operations , surpassing the loss of life incurred from the attack of an Iraqi Air Force jet on the guided missile frigate USS Stark .

 With the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the lack of a perceived threat against the United States came drastic cuts to the defense budget and the battleships were deemed uneconomical ; as a result , Iowa was decommissioned for the last time on 26 October 1990 , after a total of 19 years of commissioned service . She was the first of the reactivated battleships to be decommissioned , and this was done earlier than originally planned as a result of the damaged turret . Iowa was berthed at the Naval Education and Training Center in Newport from 24 September 1998 to 8 March 2001 , when the ship began her journey under tow to California . The ship arrived in Suisun Bay near San Francisco on 21 April 2001 and joined the reserve fleet there , where she remained in reserve until struck again from the Naval Vessel Register in March 2006 . She and her sister ships had been struck previously in 1995 . She remained at the Suisun Bay anchorage until November 2011 . 
 Section 1011 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 required the United States Navy to reinstate to the Naval Vessel Register two of the Iowa @-@ class battleships that had been struck by the Navy in 1995 ; these ships were to be maintained in the United States Navy reserve fleets ( or " mothball fleet " ) . The Navy was to ensure that both of the reinstated battleships were in good condition and could be reactivated for use in the Marine Corps ' amphibious operations . Due to Iowa ’ s damaged turret , the Navy selected New Jersey for placement into the mothball fleet , even though the training mechanisms on New Jersey 's 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) guns had been welded down . The cost to fix New Jersey was considered less than the cost to fix Iowa ; as a result , New Jersey and Wisconsin were reinstated to the Naval Vessel Register and placed back in the reserve fleet . 
 New Jersey remained there until the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act of 1999 required the United States Secretary of the Navy to list and maintain Iowa and Wisconsin on the Naval Vessel Register . The Act also required the Secretary of the Navy to strike New Jersey from the Naval Vessel Register and transfer the battleship to a not @-@ for @-@ profit entity in accordance with section <unk> of Title 10 , United States Code . It also required the <unk> to locate the battleship in the State of New Jersey . The Navy made the switch in January 1999 , allowing New Jersey to open as a museum ship in her namesake state . 
 On 17 March 2006 , the Secretary of the Navy exercised his authority to strike Iowa and Wisconsin from the NVR , which cleared the way for both ships to be donated for use as museum ships , but the United States Congress remained " deeply concerned " over the loss of the naval surface gunfire support that the battleships provided , and noted that " navy efforts to improve upon , much less replace , this capability have been highly problematic . " As a partial consequence , Congress passed Pub.L. 109 – 163 , the National Defense Authorization Act 2006 , requiring that the battleships be kept and maintained in a state of readiness should they ever be needed again . Congress ordered that measures be implemented to ensure that , if need be , Iowa could be returned to active duty . These measures closely mirrored the original three conditions that the National Defense Authorization Act of 1996 laid out for the maintenance of Iowa while she was in the " mothball fleet " . 
 In March 2007 , the Historic Ships Memorial at Pacific Square ( HSMPS ) of Vallejo , site of the former Mare Island Naval Shipyard , and a Stockton group submitted proposals . The HSMPS , which had attempted to place the ship in San Francisco , supported the Mare Island — Vallejo site . In October 2007 the Navy informed HSMPS that they were the only viable candidate to acquire Iowa , and their application would be further reviewed after evidence was presented that financing was in place , and when the Stockton and San Francisco groups withdrew or failed to submit a final application respectively . On 25 April 2009 , Iowa Senate Resolution No. 19 was approved , endorsing HSMPS as USS Iowa 's custodian and supporting the battleship 's placement at Mare Island . 
 In February 2010 , the Pacific Battleship Center ( PBC ) was behind efforts to have the ship berthed in San Pedro , Los Angeles , California . In late February the Port of Los Angeles ( which includes the San Pedro area ) rejected a proposal by the PBC to berth the battleship at its facilities because the battleship was not yet available . On 12 April 2010 , the Governor of Iowa signed into law Bill <unk> , which officially formed a 10 @-@ member committee to raise about $ 5 million for the group awarded the USS Iowa . The statement supporting the Vallejo group in the original Iowa State Senate 's version <unk> was struck in favor of supporting any group actually awarded the battleship . 
 On 13 May 2010 , the Navy announced it would reopen the bidding process , citing HSMPS 's lack of progress as the reason . On 24 May 2010 the Federal Register officially reopened the bidding process for the USS Iowa to a California @-@ based city or non @-@ profit organization . 
 On 18 November 2010 , the Port of Los Angeles Harbor Commissioners voted unanimously on a resolution to support Berth 87 as the future home of the USS Iowa , clearing the way for The Pacific Battleship Center to send its completed application to the Navy . On 6 September 2011 , the USS Iowa was awarded to Pacific Battleship Center for placement at the Port of Los Angeles . After rehabilitation at the Port of Richmond , California , ( beginning in October 2011 ) , the ship was designated to be towed to and berthed in the Port of Los Angeles . 
 Starting 10 December 2011 , the USS Iowa was open for weekend tours . The Battleship Expo at the Port of Richmond included shipboard access and other exhibits such as 16 @-@ inch shells , a short film about the battleship , and other exhibits . On 30 April 2012 , the USS Iowa was officially donated to the Pacific Battleship Center in Los Angeles by the United States Navy . 
 Iowa began her journey to the Port of Los Angeles on 26 May 2012 under tow by tugboats . After being anchored off the Southern California coast to have her hull scrubbed to remove any invasive species or contaminants , she was permanently anchored on 9 June 2012 in San Pedro at Berth 87 , along the Main Channel , directly south of the World Cruise Center . The museum opened to the public on 7 July , under the direction and control of Pacific Battleship Center .

 = Neville Chamberlain = 
 Arthur Neville Chamberlain FRS ( 18 March 1869 – 9 November 1940 ) was a British Conservative politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from May 1937 to May 1940 . Chamberlain is best known for his appeasement foreign policy , and in particular for his signing of the Munich Agreement in 1938 , conceding the German @-@ speaking Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia to Germany . However , when Adolf Hitler later invaded Poland , the UK declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939 , and Chamberlain led Britain through the first eight months of World War II . 
 After working in business and local government and after a short spell as Director of National Service in 1916 and 1917 , Chamberlain followed his father , Joseph Chamberlain , and older half @-@ brother , Austen Chamberlain , in becoming a member of parliament in the 1918 general election at age 49 . He declined a junior ministerial position , remaining a backbencher until 1922 . He was rapidly promoted in 1923 to Minister of Health and then Chancellor of the Exchequer . After a short Labour @-@ led government , he returned as Minister of Health , introducing a range of reform measures from 1924 to 1929 . He was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in the National Government in 1931 . 
 When Stanley Baldwin retired in May 1937 , Chamberlain took his place as Prime Minister . His premiership was dominated by the question of policy toward the increasingly aggressive Germany , and his actions at Munich were widely popular among Britons at the time . When Hitler continued his aggression , Chamberlain pledged Britain to defend Poland 's independence if the latter were attacked , an alliance that brought Britain into war when Germany attacked Poland in 1939 . Chamberlain resigned the premiership on 10 May 1940 after the Allies were forced to retreat from Norway , as he believed a government supported by all parties was essential , and the Labour and Liberal parties would not join a government headed by him . He was succeeded by Winston Churchill but remained very well regarded in Parliament , especially among Conservatives . Before ill health forced him to resign he was an important member of Churchill 's War Cabinet , heading it in the new premier 's absence . Chamberlain died of cancer six months after leaving the premiership . 
 Chamberlain 's reputation remains controversial among historians , with the initial high regard for him being entirely eroded by books such as Guilty Men , published in July 1940 , which blamed Chamberlain and his associates for the Munich accord and for allegedly failing to prepare the country for war . Most historians in the generation following Chamberlain 's death held similar views , led by Churchill in The Gathering Storm . Some recent historians have taken a more favourable perspective of Chamberlain and his policies , citing government papers released under the Thirty Year Rule and arguing that going to war with Germany in 1938 would have been disastrous as the UK was not ready . Nevertheless , Chamberlain is still unfavourably ranked amongst British Prime Ministers . 
 = = Early life and political career ( 1869 – 1918 ) = = 
 = = = Childhood and businessman = = = 
 Chamberlain was born on 18 March 1869 in a house called Southbourne in the Edgbaston district of Birmingham . He was the only son of the second marriage of Joseph Chamberlain , who later became Mayor of Birmingham and a Cabinet minister . His mother was Florence Kenrick , cousin to William Kenrick MP ; she died when he was a small boy . Joseph Chamberlain had had another son , Austen Chamberlain , by his first marriage . Neville Chamberlain was educated at Rugby School . Joseph Chamberlain then sent Neville to Mason College ( the future University of Birmingham ) . Neville Chamberlain had little interest in his studies there , and in 1889 his father apprenticed him to a firm of accountants . Within six months he became a salaried employee . 
 In an effort to recoup diminished family fortunes , Joseph Chamberlain sent his younger son to establish a sisal plantation on Andros Island in the Bahamas . Neville Chamberlain spent six years there but the plantation was a failure , and Joseph Chamberlain lost £ 50 @,@ 000 . 
 On his return to England , Neville Chamberlain entered business , purchasing ( with assistance from his family ) Hoskins & Company , a manufacturer of metal ship berths . Chamberlain served as managing director of Hoskins for 17 years during which time the company prospered . He also involved himself in civic activities in Birmingham . In 1906 , as Governor of Birmingham 's General Hospital , and along with " no more than fifteen " other dignitaries , Chamberlain became a founding member of the national United Hospitals Committee of the British Medical Association . 
 At forty , Chamberlain was expecting to remain a bachelor , but in 1910 he fell in love with Anne Cole , a distant relative by marriage , and married her the following year . She encouraged and supported his entry into local politics and was to be his constant companion , helper and trusted colleague , and to share in full his interests in housing and other political and social activities after his election as an MP . The two had a son and a daughter . 
 = = = Entry into politics = = = 
 Chamberlain initially showed little interest in politics though his father and half @-@ brother were in Parliament . During the " Khaki election " of 1900 he made speeches in support of Joseph Chamberlain 's Liberal Unionists . The Liberal Unionists were allied with the Conservatives and later merged with them under the name " Unionist Party " , which in 1925 became known as the " Conservative and Unionist Party " . In 1911 Neville Chamberlain successfully stood as a Liberal Unionist for Birmingham City Council for the All Saints ' Ward , located within his father 's parliamentary constituency . 
 Chamberlain was made chairman of the Town Planning Committee . Under Chamberlain 's direction Birmingham soon adopted one of the first town planning schemes in Britain . The start of war in 1914 prevented implementation of his plans . In 1915 , Chamberlain became Lord Mayor of Birmingham . Apart from his father Joseph , five of Chamberlain 's uncles had also attained the chief Birmingham civic dignity : they were Joseph 's brother Richard Chamberlain , William and George Kenrick , Charles Beale , who had been four times Lord Mayor and Sir Thomas Martineau . As a Lord Mayor in wartime , Chamberlain had a huge burden of work and he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally hard . He halved the Lord Mayor 's expense allowance and cut back on the number of civic functions expected of the incumbent . 
 In 1915 Chamberlain was appointed member of the Central Control Board on liquor traffic . In December 1916 the Prime Minister , David Lloyd George , offered Chamberlain the new position of Director of National Service with responsibility for co @-@ ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces . However , his tenure was marked by conflict with Lloyd George and in August 1917 , having received little support from the Prime Minister , Chamberlain resigned . The relationship between Chamberlain and Lloyd George would be one thenceforth of hatred . 
 Chamberlain decided to stand for the House of Commons , and was adopted as Unionist candidate for Birmingham Ladywood . After the war ended , a general election was called almost immediately . He was elected with almost 70 % of the vote and a majority of 6 @,@ 833 . At age 49 he is still the oldest Parliamentary debutant to later become Prime Minister . 
 = = MP and Minister ( 1919 – 37 ) = = 
 = = = Rise from the backbench = = = 
 Chamberlain threw himself into Parliamentary work , begrudging the times when he was unable to attend debates and spending much time on committee work . He was chairman of the national Unhealthy Areas Committee ( 1919 – 21 ) and in that role , had visited the slums of London , Birmingham , Leeds , Liverpool and Cardiff . Consequently , in March 1920 he was offered a junior post at the Ministry of Health by Bonar Law on behalf of the Prime Minister , but was unwilling to serve under Lloyd George . Chamberlain was offered no further posts during Lloyd George 's premiership . When Bonar Law resigned as party leader Austen Chamberlain took his place as head of the Unionists in Parliament . Unionist leaders were willing to fight the 1922 election in coalition with the Lloyd George Liberals , but on 19 October Unionist MPs held a meeting at which they voted to fight the election as a single party . Lloyd George resigned , as did Austen Chamberlain , and Bonar Law was recalled from retirement to lead the Unionists as Prime Minister . 
 Many high @-@ ranking Unionists refused to serve under Bonar Law to the benefit of Chamberlain who rose over the course of ten months from backbencher to Chancellor of the Exchequer . Bonar Law initially appointed Chamberlain Postmaster General and Chamberlain was sworn of the Privy Council . When Sir Arthur Griffith @-@ Boscawen , the Minister of Health , lost his seat in the 1922 general election and failed to win a by @-@ election in March 1923 , Bonar Law offered the position within the Cabinet to Chamberlain . Two months later , Bonar Law was diagnosed with advanced , terminal throat cancer . He immediately resigned , and was replaced by Chancellor of the Exchequer Stanley Baldwin . In August 1923 , Baldwin promoted Chamberlain to the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer . 
 Chamberlain served only five months in the office before the Conservatives were defeated in the 1923 general election . Ramsay MacDonald became the first Labour Prime Minister , but the Labour government fell within months necessitating another general election . Chamberlain narrowly defeated Labour candidate Oswald Mosley ( who later led the British Union of Fascists ) . Believing he would lose if he stood again in Ladywood , Chamberlain arranged to be adopted for Birmingham Edgbaston , the district of the city where he was born and which was a much safer seat which he would hold for the rest of his life . The Unionists won the election , but Chamberlain declined to serve again as Chancellor , preferring his former position as Minister of Health . 
 Within two weeks of his appointment as Minister of Health Chamberlain presented the Cabinet with an agenda containing 25 pieces of legislation he hoped to see enacted . Before he left office in 1929 , 21 of the 25 bills had passed into law . Chamberlain sought the abolition of the elected Poor Law Boards of Guardians which administered relief — and which in some areas were responsible for rates . Many of the Boards were controlled by Labour , and such Boards had defied the government by distributing relief funds to the able @-@ bodied unemployed . In 1929 Chamberlain initiated legislation to abolish the Poor Law boards entirely . Chamberlain spoke in the Commons for two and a half hours on the second reading of the Bill , and when he concluded he was applauded by all parties . The Bill passed into law . 
 Though Chamberlain struck a conciliatory note during the 1926 General Strike , in general he had poor relations with the Labour opposition . Future Labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee complained that Chamberlain " always treated us like dirt " , and Chamberlain in April 1927 wrote : " More and more do I feel an utter contempt for their lamentable stupidity . " His poor relations with the Labour Party later played a major part in his downfall as Prime Minister . 
 = = = Opposition and second term as Chancellor = = = 
 Baldwin called a general election for 30 May 1929 which resulted in a hung parliament , with Labour holding the most seats . Baldwin and his government resigned and Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald ( 1866 – 1937 ) took office . In 1931 , the MacDonald government faced a serious crisis , as the May Report revealed that the budget was unbalanced , with an expected shortfall of £ 120 million . On 24 August 1931 the Labour government resigned and MacDonald formed a National Government supported by most Conservative MPs . Chamberlain once again returned to the Ministry of Health . 
 After the 1931 general election , in which supporters of the National Government ( mostly the Conservatives ) won an overwhelming victory , MacDonald designated Chamberlain as Chancellor . Chamberlain proposed a 10 % tariff on foreign goods and lower or no tariffs on goods from the colonies and the Dominions . Joseph Chamberlain had advocated a similar policy , " Imperial Preference " . On 4 February 1932 Neville Chamberlain laid his bill before the House of Commons . Chamberlain concluded his address by noting the appropriateness of his seeking to enact his father 's proposal . At the end of the speech , Sir Austen Chamberlain walked down from the backbenches and shook his brother 's hand . The Import Duties Act 1932 passed Parliament easily . 
 Chamberlain presented his first budget in April 1932 . He maintained the severe budget cuts that had been agreed to at the inception of the National Government . Interest on the war debt had been a major cost in each budget . Chamberlain was able to reduce the interest rate on most of Britain 's war debt from 5 % to 3 @.@ 5 % . Between 1932 and 1938 , Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to payment of interest on the war debt . 
 Chamberlain hoped that a cancellation of the war debt owed to the United States could be negotiated . In June 1933 , Britain hosted the World Monetary and Economic Conference . The Conference came to nothing . US President Franklin Roosevelt sent word that he would not consider any war debt cancellation . By 1934 , Chamberlain was able to declare a budget surplus and restore many of the cuts in unemployment compensation and civil servant salaries he had made after taking office . He told the Commons " We have now finished the story of Bleak House and are sitting down this afternoon to enjoy the first chapter of Great Expectations . " 
 The Unemployed Assistance Board ( established by the Unemployment Act 1934 ) was largely Chamberlain 's creation and he wished to see the issue of unemployment assistance removed from party political argument . Moreover , Chamberlain " saw the importance of ' providing some interest in life for the large numbers of men never likely to get work ' , and out of this realisation was to come the responsibility of the <unk> for the " welfare " , not merely the maintenance , of the unemployed " . 
 Defence spending had been heavily cut in Chamberlain 's early budgets . By 1935 , faced with a resurgent Germany under Hitler 's leadership ( see German re @-@ armament ) , he was convinced of the need for rearmament . Chamberlain especially urged the strengthening of the Royal Air Force , realising that Britain 's traditional bulwark , the English Channel , was no defence against air power . 
 In 1935 , MacDonald stood down as Prime Minister , while Baldwin became Prime Minister for the third time . In the 1935 general election the Conservative @-@ dominated National Government lost 90 seats from the massive majority of 1931 , but still retained an overwhelming majority of 255 in the House of Commons . During the campaign , deputy Labour leader Arthur Greenwood had attacked Chamberlain for spending money on rearmament stating that the rearmament policy was " the merest scaremongering ; disgraceful in a statesman of Mr. Chamberlain 's responsible position , to suggest that more millions of money needed to be spent on armaments " . 
 Chamberlain is believed to have had a significant role in the 1936 abdication crisis . He wrote in his diary that Wallis Simpson , Edward VIII 's intended wife , was " an entirely unscrupulous woman who is not in love with the King but is exploiting him for her own purposes . She has already ruined him in money and jewels ... " . In common with the rest of the Cabinet , except Duff Cooper , he agreed with Baldwin that the King should abdicate if he married Simpson and on 6 December he and Baldwin both stressed the King should make his decision before Christmas ; by one account , he believed that the uncertainty was " hurting the Christmas trade " . The King eventually abdicated on the 10th , four days after the meeting . 
 Soon after the abdication Baldwin announced that he would remain until shortly after the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth . On 28 May , two weeks after the Coronation , Baldwin resigned , advising the King to send for Chamberlain . Sir Austen did not live to see his brother 's final " climb ... to the top of the greasy pole " , having died two months earlier . 
 = = Premiership ( 1937 – 40 ) = = 
 Upon his accession Chamberlain considered calling a general election , but with three and a half years remaining in the then current Parliament 's term decided to wait . At age 68 , he was the second @-@ eldest person in the 20th century ( behind Sir Henry Campbell @-@ Bannerman ) to become Prime Minister for the first time , and was widely seen as a caretaker who would lead the Conservative Party until the next election , and then step down in favour of a younger man , with Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden a likely candidate . From the start of Chamberlain 's premiership a number of would @-@ be successors were rumoured to be jockeying for position . 
 Chamberlain had disliked what he considered to be an overly sentimental attitude by both Baldwin and MacDonald on Cabinet appointments and reshuffles . Although he had worked closely with the President of the Board of Trade , Walter Runciman over the tariff issue , Chamberlain dismissed him from his post , offering Runciman the token position of Lord Privy Seal which an angry Runciman declined . Runciman , a member of the Liberal National Party , was thought by Chamberlain to be lazy . Soon after taking office , Chamberlain instructed his ministers to prepare two @-@ year policy programmes . These reports were to be integrated with the intent of co @-@ ordinating the passage of legislation through the current Parliament , the term of which was to expire in November 1940 . 
 At the time of his succession Chamberlain 's personality was not well known to the public , though he had made annual budget broadcasts for six years , which , according to Chamberlain biographer Robert Self , appeared relaxed and modern , showing an ability to speak directly to the camera . Chamberlain had few friends among his parliamentary colleagues . An attempt by his Parliamentary Private Secretary , Lord Dunglass ( later Prime Minister himself as Alec Douglas @-@ Home ) to bring him to the Smoking Room in the Commons to socialise with his colleagues , ended in embarrassing silence . Chamberlain compensated for these shortcomings by devising the most sophisticated press management system employed by a Prime Minister up to that time , with officials at Number 10 led by his chief of press George Steward , convincing members of the press that they were colleagues sharing power and insider knowledge , and should espouse the government line . 
 = = = Domestic policy = = = 
 Chamberlain saw his elevation to the premiership as the final glory in a career as a domestic reformer , not realising that he would be remembered for foreign policy decisions . One reason he sought the settlement of European issues was in the hope it would allow him to concentrate on domestic affairs . 
 Soon after attaining the premiership , Chamberlain obtained passage of the Factories Act 1937 . This act was aimed at bettering working conditions in factories and placed limits on the working hours of women and children . In 1938 , Parliament enacted the Coal Act 1938 , which allowed for nationalisation of coal deposits . Another major piece of legislation passed that year was the Holidays with Pay Act . Though the act only recommended that employers give workers a week off with pay , the Act caused the great expansion of holiday camps and other leisure accommodation for the working classes . The Housing Act of 1938 provided subsidies aimed at encouraging slum clearance and maintained rent control . Chamberlain 's plans for the reform of local government were shelved because of the outbreak of war in 1939 . Likewise , the proposal to raise the school @-@ leaving age to 15 , scheduled for implementation on 1 September 1939 , did not go into effect . 
 = = = Relations with Ireland = = = 
 When Chamberlain became Prime Minister relations between the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State had been strained since the 1932 accession of the new Irish Taoiseach ( Prime Minister ) Éamon de Valera . The Anglo @-@ Irish Trade War , sparked by the withholding of money that Ireland had agreed to pay the United Kingdom , had caused economic losses on both sides , and the two nations were anxious for a settlement . The de Valera government also sought to remove the remaining ties between Ireland and the UK , such as ending the King 's status as Irish Head of State . Chamberlain , as Chancellor had taken a hard @-@ line stance against concessions to the Irish , but having been persuaded that the strained ties were having effects on relations with other Dominions he sought a settlement with Ireland . 
 Talks had been suspended under Baldwin in 1936 but resumed in November 1937 . De Valera sought not only to alter the constitutional status of Ireland , but to overturn other aspects of the Anglo @-@ Irish Treaty , most notably the issue of partition , as well as obtaining full control of the three " Treaty Ports " which had remained in British control . Britain , on the other hand , wished to retain the Treaty Ports , at least in time of war and to obtain the money that Ireland had agreed to pay . 
 The Irish proved very tough negotiators , so much so that Chamberlain complained that one of de Valera 's offers had " presented United Kingdom ministers with a three @-@ leafed shamrock , none of the leaves of which had any advantages for the UK " . With the talks facing deadlock , Chamberlain made the Irish a final offer in March 1938 which acceded to many Irish positions though he was confident that he had " only given up the small things " , and the agreements were signed on 25 April 1938 . The issue of partition was not resolved , but the Irish agreed to pay £ 10 million to the British . There was no provision in the treaties for British access to the Treaty Ports in time of war , but Chamberlain accepted de Valera 's oral assurance that in the event of war the British would have access . The agreements were attacked by Conservative backbencher Winston Churchill in Parliament for surrendering the Treaty Ports which Churchill described as the " sentinel towers of the Western Approaches " . When war came , de Valera denied Britain access to the Treaty Ports under Irish neutrality . Churchill railed against these treaties in The Gathering Storm , stating that he " never saw the House of Commons more completely misled " and that " members were made to feel very differently about it when our existence hung in the balance during the Battle of the Atlantic " . Chamberlain , however , believed that the Treaty Ports were unusable if Ireland was hostile and deemed their loss worthwhile to assure friendly relations with Dublin .

 Chamberlain sought to conciliate Germany and make the Nazi state a partner in a stable Europe . He believed Germany could be satisfied by the restoration of some of her colonies , and during the Rhineland crisis of March 1936 he had stated that " if we were in sight of an all @-@ round settlement the British government ought to consider the question " of restoration of colonies . 
 The new Prime Minister 's attempts to secure such a settlement were frustrated because Germany was in no hurry to talk to Britain . Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath was supposed to visit Britain in July 1937 but cancelled his visit . Lord Halifax , the Lord President of the Council visited Germany privately in November and met with Hitler and other German officials . Both Chamberlain and British Ambassador to Germany Nevile Henderson pronounced the visit a success . Foreign Office officials complained that the Halifax visit made it appear Britain was too eager for talks , and Foreign Secretary Eden felt that he had been bypassed . 
 Chamberlain also bypassed Eden while the Foreign Secretary was on holiday by opening direct talks with Italy , an international pariah for its invasion and conquest of Ethiopia . At a Cabinet meeting on 8 September 1937 , Chamberlain indicated that he saw " the lessening of the tension between this country and Italy as a very valuable contribution toward the pacification and appeasement of Europe " which would " weaken the Rome – Berlin axis " . The Prime Minister also set up a private line of communication with the Italian " Duce " Benito Mussolini through the Italian Ambassador , Count Dino Grandi . 
 In February 1938 Hitler began to press the Austrian government to accept " Anschluss " or union between Germany and Austria . Chamberlain believed that it was essential to cement relations with Italy in the hope that an Anglo – Italian alliance would forestall Hitler from imposing his rule over Austria . Eden , however , believed Chamberlain was being too hasty in talking with Italy and holding out the prospect of de jure recognition of Italy 's conquest of Ethiopia . Chamberlain concluded that Eden would have to accept his policy , or resign . The Cabinet heard both men out but unanimously decided for Chamberlain . Despite efforts by other Cabinet members to prevent it , Eden resigned from office . In later years , Eden tried to portray his resignation as a stand against appeasement ( Churchill described him in The Second World War as " one strong young figure standing up against long , dismal , drawling tides of drift and surrender " ) but many ministers and MPs believed there was no issue at stake worth resignation . Chamberlain appointed Lord Halifax as Foreign Secretary in Eden 's place .

 In March 1938 Austria became a part of Germany in the " Anschluß " . Though the beleaguered Austrians requested help from Britain none was forthcoming . Britain did send Berlin a strong note of protest . In addressing the Cabinet shortly after German forces crossed the border , Chamberlain placed blame on both Germany and Austria . Chamberlain noted , 
 It is perfectly evident now that force is the only argument Germany understands and that " collective security " cannot offer any prospect of preventing such events until it can show a visible force of overwhelming strength backed by the determination to use it . ... Heaven knows I don 't want to get back to alliances but if Germany continues to behave as she has done lately she may drive us to it . 
 On 14 March , the day after the " Anschluß " , Chamberlain addressed the House of Commons and strongly condemned the methods used by the Germans in the takeover of Austria . Chamberlain 's address met with the approval of the House . 
 With Austria absorbed by Germany , attention turned to Hitler 's obvious next target , the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia . With three million ethnic Germans , the Sudetenland represented the largest German population outside the " Reich " . Hitler began to call for the union of the region with Germany . Britain had no military obligations toward Czechoslovakia , but France and Czechoslovakia had a mutual assistance pact . After the fall of Austria , the Cabinet 's Foreign Policy Committee considered seeking a " grand alliance " to thwart Germany , or alternatively , an assurance to France of assistance if the French went to war . Instead , the committee chose to advocate that Czechoslovakia be urged to make the best terms it could with Germany . The full Cabinet agreed with the committee 's recommendation influenced by a report from the chiefs of staff stating that there was little that Britain could do to help the Czechs in the event of a German invasion . Chamberlain reported to an amenable House that he was unwilling to limit his government 's discretion by giving commitments . 
 Britain and Italy signed an agreement in April 1938 . In exchange for " de jure " recognition of Italy 's Ethiopian conquest , Italy agreed to withdraw some Italian " volunteers " from the Nationalist ( pro @-@ Franco ) side of the Spanish Civil War . The Nationalists by now strongly had the upper hand in this war and completed their victory the following year . Later that month the new French Prime Minister , Édouard Daladier , came to London for talks with Chamberlain , and agreed to follow the British position on Czechoslovakia . 
 In May , Czech border guards shot two Sudeten German farmers who were attempting to cross the border into Czechoslovakia without stopping for border controls . This incident caused unrest among the Sudeten Germans , and Germany was then said to be moving troops to the border . In response to the report , Prague moved troops to the German border . Halifax sent a note to Germany warning that if France intervened in the crisis on Czechoslovakia 's behalf , Britain might support France . Tensions calmed , and Chamberlain and Halifax were applauded for their " masterly " handling of the crisis . Though not known at the time , it later became clear that Germany had had no plans for a May invasion of Czechoslovakia . Nonetheless , the Chamberlain government received strong and almost unanimous support from the British press . 
 Negotiations between the Czech government and the Sudeten Germans dragged on through mid @-@ 1938 . They achieved little result with Sudeten leader Konrad Henlein under private instructions from Hitler not to reach an agreement . On 3 August , Walter Runciman ( by now Lord Runciman ) travelled to Prague as a mediator sent by the British government . Over the next two weeks , Runciman met separately with Henlein , the Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš and other leaders , but made no progress . On 30 August Chamberlain met with his Cabinet and Ambassador Henderson and secured their backing — with only First Lord of the Admiralty Duff Cooper dissenting against Chamberlain 's policy to pressure Czechoslovakia into making concessions on the ground that Britain was then in no position to back up any threat to go to war . 
 Chamberlain realised that Hitler would likely signal his intentions in his 12 September speech at the annual Nuremberg Rally , and so Chamberlain discussed with his advisers how to respond if war seemed likely . In consultation with his close adviser Sir Horace Wilson , Chamberlain set out " Plan Z " . If war seemed inevitable , Chamberlain would fly to Germany to negotiate directly with Hitler .

 Lord Runciman continued his work attempting to pressure the Czechoslovak government into concessions . On 7 September there was an altercation involving Sudeten members of the Czechoslovak parliament in the North @-@ Moravian city of <unk> @-@ <unk> . The Germans made considerable propaganda of the incident though the Prague government attempted to conciliate them by dismissing Czech police who had been involved . As the tempest grew Runciman concluded that there was no point in attempting further negotiations until after Hitler 's speech . The mission would never resume . 
 The final days before Hitler 's speech on the last day of the Rally were spent amidst tremendous tension as Britain , France , and Czechoslovakia all partially mobilised their troops . Thousands gathered outside 10 Downing Street on the night of Hitler 's speech in Nuremberg . At last the Führer addressed his wildly enthusiastic followers : 
 The condition of the Sudeten Germans is indescribable . It is sought to annihilate them . As human beings they are oppressed and scandalously treated in an intolerable fashion ... The depriving of these people of their rights must come to an end . ... I have stated that the " Reich " would not tolerate any further oppression of these three and a half million Germans , and I would ask the statesmen of foreign countries to be convinced that this is no mere form of words . 
 The following morning , 13 September , Chamberlain and the Cabinet were informed by secret service sources that all German embassies had been told that Germany would invade Czechoslovakia on 25 September . Convinced that the French would not fight ( Daladier was privately proposing a three @-@ Power summit to settle the Sudeten question ) , Chamberlain decided to implement " Plan Z " and sent a message to Hitler that he was willing to come to Germany to negotiate . Hitler accepted and Chamberlain flew to Germany on the morning of 15 September ; this was the first time , excepting a short jaunt at an industrial fair , that Chamberlain had ever flown . Chamberlain flew to Munich and then journeyed by rail to Hitler 's retreat at Berchtesgaden . 
 The face to face meeting lasted about three hours . Hitler demanded the annexation of the Sudetenland , and through questioning him , Chamberlain was able to obtain assurances that Hitler had no designs on the remainder of Czechoslovakia or on the areas in Eastern Europe which had German minorities . After the meeting Chamberlain returned to London believing that he had obtained a breathing space during which agreement could be reached and the peace preserved . Under the proposals made at Berchtesgaden the Sudetenland would be annexed by Germany if a plebiscite in the Sudetenland favoured it . Czechoslovakia would receive international guarantees of its independence which would replace existing treaty obligations — principally the French pledge to the Czechoslovaks . The French agreed to the requirements . Under considerable pressure the Czechoslovaks also agreed , causing the Czechoslovak government to fall . 
 Chamberlain flew back to Germany , meeting Hitler in Bad Godesberg on 22 September . Hitler brushed aside the proposals of the previous meeting , stating " that won 't do any more " . Hitler demanded immediate occupation of the Sudetenland and that Polish and Hungarian territorial claims on Czechoslovakia be addressed . Chamberlain objected strenuously telling Hitler that he had worked to bring the French and Czechoslovaks into line with Germany 's demands , so much so that he had been accused of giving in to dictators and had been booed on his departure that morning . Hitler was unmoved . 
 That evening , Chamberlain told Lord Halifax that the " meeting with Herr Hitler had been most unsatisfactory " . The following day , Hitler kept Chamberlain waiting until mid @-@ afternoon when he sent a five @-@ page letter , in German , outlining the demands he had spoken of orally the previous day . Chamberlain replied by offering to act as an intermediary with the Czechoslovaks , and suggested that Hitler put his demands in a memorandum which could be circulated to the French and Czechoslovaks . 
 The leaders met again late on the evening of 23 September — a meeting which stretched into the early morning hours . Hitler demanded that fleeing Czechs in the zones to be occupied take nothing with them . He extended his deadline for occupation of the Sudetenland to 1 October — the date he had long before secretly set for the invasion of Czechoslovakia . The meeting ended amicably with Chamberlain confiding to Hitler his hopes they would be able to work out other problems in Europe in the same spirit . Hitler hinted that the Sudetenland fulfilled his territorial ambitions in Europe . Chamberlain flew back to London , stating " It is up to the Czechs now . "

 Hitler 's proposals met with resistance not only from the French and Czechoslovaks , but also from some members of Chamberlain 's cabinet . With no agreement in sight , war seemed inevitable . The Prime Minister issued a press statement calling on Germany to abandon the threat of force in exchange for British help in obtaining the concessions it sought . On the evening of 27 September , Chamberlain addressed the nation by radio , and after thanking those who wrote to him , stated : 
 How horrible , fantastic , incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas @-@ masks here because of a quarrel in a far @-@ away country between people of whom we know nothing . It seems still more impossible that a quarrel that has already been settled in principle should be the subject of war . 
 On 28 September , he called on Hitler to invite him to Germany again to seek a solution through a summit involving the British , French , Germans , and Italians . Hitler replied favourably and word of this response came to Chamberlain as he was winding up a speech in the House of Commons which sat in gloomy anticipation of war , Chamberlain informed the House of this in his speech . The response was a passionate demonstration with members cheering Chamberlain wildly . Even diplomats in the galleries applauded . Lord Dunglass later commented , " There were a lot of <unk> in Parliament that day . " 
 On the morning of 29 September Chamberlain left Heston Aerodrome ( to the east of today 's Heathrow Airport ) for his third and final visit to Germany . On arrival in Munich the British delegation was taken directly to the " <unk> " where Daladier , Mussolini and Hitler soon arrived . The four leaders and their translators held an informal meeting with Hitler stating that he intended to invade Czechoslovakia on 1 October . Mussolini distributed a proposal similar to Hitler 's Bad Godesberg terms . In fact , the proposal had been drafted by German officials and transmitted to Rome the previous day . The draft was debated by the four leaders and Chamberlain raised the question of compensation for the Czechoslovak government and citizens which Hitler refused to consider . 
 The leaders were joined by advisers after lunch and hours were spent on long discussions of each clause of the Italian draft agreement . Late that evening the British and French left for their hotels on the grounds that they had to seek advice from their respective capitals . Meanwhile , the Germans and Italians enjoyed the feast which Hitler had intended for all the participants . During this break , Chamberlain adviser Sir Horace Wilson met with the Czechoslovaks informing them of the draft agreement and enquiring which districts particularly were important to them . The Munich Conference resumed about 10 p.m. and was mostly in the hands of a small drafting committee . At 1 : 30 a.m. the Munich Agreement was ready for signing , though a signing ceremony was delayed when Hitler discovered that the ornate <unk> on his desk was empty . 
 Chamberlain and Daladier returned to their hotel and informed the Czechoslovaks of the agreement . The two Prime Ministers urged quick acceptance by the Czechoslovaks of the agreement since the evacuation by the Czechs was to begin the following day . At 12 : 30 pm the Czechoslovak government in Prague objected to the decision but agreed to its terms . 
 = = = = = Aftermath and reception = = = = = 
 Prior to leaving the " <unk> " , Chamberlain requested a private conference with Hitler which the German leader agreed to , and the two met at Hitler 's apartment in the city later that morning . Chamberlain urged restraint in the implementation of the agreement and requested that the Germans not bomb Prague if the Czechs resisted , to which Hitler seemed agreeable . Chamberlain took from his pocket a paper headed " Anglo – German Agreement " , which contained three paragraphs including a statement that the two nations considered the Munich Agreement " symbolic of the desire of our two people never to go to war again " . According to Chamberlain , Hitler interjected " Ja ! Ja ! " ( " Yes ! Yes ! " ) as the Prime Minister read it . The two men signed the paper then and there . When , later that day , German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop remonstrated with Hitler for signing it , the " Führer " replied , " Oh , don 't take it so seriously . That piece of paper is of no further significance whatever . " Chamberlain , on the other hand , when he returned to his hotel for lunch patted his breast pocket and said , " I 've got it ! " Word leaked as to the outcome of the meetings before Chamberlain 's return causing delight among many in London , though causing gloom amongst Churchill and his adherents .
