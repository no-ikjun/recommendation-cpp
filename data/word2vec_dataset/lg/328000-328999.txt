 = National Football League playoffs = 
 The National Football League ( NFL ) playoffs are a single @-@ elimination tournament held after the end of the regular season to determine the NFL champion . Six teams from each of the league 's two conferences qualify for the playoffs based on regular season records , and a tie @-@ breaking procedure exists in the case of equal records . The tournament ends with the Super Bowl , the league 's championship game , which matches the two conference champions . 
 NFL postseason history can be traced to the first NFL Championship Game in 1933 , though in the early years , qualification for the game was based solely on regular season records . From 1933 to 1966 , the NFL postseason generally only consisted of the NFL Championship Game , pitting the league 's two division winners ( pending any one @-@ game playoff matches that needed to be held to break ties in the division standings ) . The NFL playoffs then expanded in 1967 , when four teams qualified for the tournament . When the league merged with the American Football League ( AFL ) in 1970 , the playoffs expanded to eight teams . The playoffs were expanded to 10 teams in 1978 and 12 teams since 1990 . 
 The NFL is the only one out of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States to use a single @-@ elimination tournament in all four rounds of its playoffs ; Major League Baseball ( MLB ) ( not including their wild @-@ card postseason round ) , the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) , and the National Hockey League ( NHL ) all use a " best @-@ of " format instead . 
 = = Current playoff system = = 
 The 32 @-@ team league is divided into two conferences : the American Football Conference ( AFC ) and the National Football Conference ( NFC ) , each of which has 16 teams . Since 2002 , each conference has been further divided into four divisions of four teams each . The tournament brackets are made up of six teams from each of the league 's two conferences , following the end of the regular season . Qualification into the playoffs works as follows : 
 The 4 division champions from each conference ( the team in each division with the best overall record ) , which are seeded 1 through 4 based on their overall won @-@ lost @-@ tied record . 
 Two wild @-@ card qualifiers from each conference ( the two teams with the best overall records of all remaining teams in the conference ) , which are seeded 5 and 6 . 
 The names of the first three playoff rounds date back to the postseason format that was first used in 1978 , when the league began using wild @-@ card teams . The first round of the playoffs is dubbed the wild @-@ card playoffs ( or wild @-@ card weekend ) . In this round , the third @-@ seeded division winner hosts the sixth seed wild card , and the fourth seed hosts the fifth . There are no restrictions regarding teams from the same division matching up in any round . The 1 and 2 seeds from each conference receive a bye in the first round , which entitles these teams to automatic advancement to the second round , the divisional playoffs , where they face the wild @-@ card weekend survivors . The NFL does not use a fixed bracket playoff system . The number 1 seed will host the worst surviving seed from the first round ( seed 4 , 5 or 6 ) , while the number 2 seed will play the other team ( seed 3 , 4 or 5 ) . The two surviving teams from each conference 's divisional playoff games then meet in the respective AFC and NFC Conference Championship games ( hosted by the higher seed ) , with the winners of those contests going on to face one another in the Super Bowl . Only twice since 1990 has neither a number one @-@ seeded team nor a number two @-@ seeded team hosted a conference championship game ( in the 2006 AFC Championship the # 3 seeded Indianapolis Colts hosted the # 4 seeded New England Patriots with the Colts winning 38 – 34 and the 2008 NFC Championship the # 4 seeded Arizona Cardinals hosting the # 6 seeded Philadelphia Eagles with the Cardinals winning 32 – 25 ) . 
 If teams are tied ( having the same regular season won @-@ lost @-@ tied record ) , the playoff seeding is determined by a set of tie @-@ breaking rules . 
 One potential disadvantage is that the two teams with the best records in a conference could play each other before the conference championship if they are in the same division . The better team would be seeded # 1 , while the lesser team would be seeded # 5 as the top wild @-@ card team , and as shown in the diagram , it is possible for the # 1 division winner to play the top wild @-@ card team in the divisional round . ( See also the " Modification proposals " section below . ) 
 The New York Giants and New York Jets have shared the same home stadium since 1984 ( first Giants Stadium from 1984 to 2009 , and MetLife Stadium since 2010 ) . Thus , if both teams need to host playoff games on the same weekend , they are always required to play on separate days , even during the Conference Championship round . The only time such a scheduling conflict has occurred was during wild @-@ card weekend in 1985 , when only 10 teams qualified for the postseason and there were only two wild @-@ card games ( See the " History " section below ) : Instead of playing both wild @-@ card games on the same day , as was the case when the 10 @-@ team system was used from 1978 to 1989 , the New England Patriots defeated the Jets , 26 – 14 , on Saturday , December 28 , before the Giants beat the San Francisco 49ers , 17 – 3 , on the following day . 
 = = Breaking ties = = 
 Often , teams will finish a season with identical records . It becomes necessary , therefore , to devise means to break these ties , either to determine which teams will qualify for the playoffs , or to determine seeding in the playoff tournament . The rules below are applied in order until the tie is broken . If three teams are tied for one playoff spot and the third team is eliminated at any step , the tie breaker reverts to step one for the remaining two teams . If multiple playoff spots are at stake , the rules are applied in order until the first team qualifies , then the process is started again for the remaining teams . 
 The tie @-@ breaking rules have changed over the years , with the most recent changes being made in 2002 to accommodate the league 's realignment into eight four @-@ team divisions ; record vs. common opponents and most of the other criteria involving wins and losses were moved up higher in the tie @-@ breaking list , while those involving compiled stats such as points for and against were moved to the bottom . 
 The current tiebreakers are as follows : 
 = = Overtime rules = = 
 The NFL introduced overtime for any divisional tiebreak games beginning in 1940 , and for championship games beginning in 1946 . The first postseason game to be played under these rules was the 1958 NFL Championship Game between the Baltimore Colts and New York Giants ( the so @-@ called " Greatest Game Ever Played " ) . Overtime under the original format was sudden death , the first team to score would be declared the winner . 
 In March 2010 , the NFL amended its rules for postseason overtime , with the rule being extended into the regular season in March 2012 . If a team scores a touchdown ; or if the defense scores a safety on its first possession , it is declared the winner . If it scores a field goal on its first possession , however , it then kicks off to the opposing team , which has an opportunity to score ; if the score is tied again after that possession , true sudden death rules apply and whoever scores next will win . 
 Since postseason games cannot end in a tie unlike the preseason or regular season , additional overtime periods are played as necessary until a winner is determined . Furthermore , all clock rules apply as if a game had started over . Therefore , if the first overtime period ends with the score still tied , the teams switch ends of the field prior to double overtime . If a game was still tied with two minutes to go in double overtime , there would be a two @-@ minute warning ( but not during the first overtime period as in the regular season ) . And if it were still tied at the end of double overtime , there would be a kickoff to start triple overtime . Although a contest could theoretically last indefinitely , or last multiple overtime periods like several National Hockey League postseason games , no NFL playoff game has ever gone into triple @-@ overtime . The longest NFL game played to date is 82 minutes , 40 seconds : Miami Dolphins kicker Garo Yepremian made the winning 37 @-@ yard field goal after 7 : 40 of double @-@ overtime to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs , 27 – 24 , in the 1971 – 72 NFL playoffs on December 25 , 1971 . 
 = = Playoff and championship history = = 
 The NFL 's method for determining its champions has changed over the years . 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 From the league 's founding in 1920 until 1932 , there was no scheduled championship game . From 1920 – 1923 , the championship was awarded to a team by a vote of team owners at the annual owners ' meeting . From 1924 – 1932 , the team having the best winning percentage was awarded the championship . As each team played a different number of games , simply counting wins and losses would have been insufficient . Additionally , tie games were not counted in the standings in figuring winning percentage ( under modern rules , ties count as ½ win and ½ loss ) . 
 = = = 1932 playoff game = = = 
 In 1932 , the Chicago Bears ( 6 – 1 – 6 ) and the Portsmouth Spartans ( 6 – 1 – 4 ) were tied at the end of the season with the identical winning percentage of <unk> ( the Green Bay Packers ( 10 – 3 – 1 ) had more wins , but a lower winning percentage ( <unk> ) as calculated under the rules of the day , which omitted ties ) . An additional game was therefore needed to determine a champion . It was agreed that the game would be played in Chicago at Wrigley Field , but severe winter weather and fear of a low turnout forced the game to be moved indoors to Chicago Stadium . The game was played under modified rules on a shortened 80 @-@ yard dirt field , and the Bears won with a final score of 9 – 0 . As a result of the game , the Bears had the better winning percentage ( .875 ) and won the league title . The loss gave the Spartans a final winning percentage of .750 , and moved them to third place behind the Packers . While there is no consensus that this game was a real " championship " game ( or even a playoff game ) , it generated considerable interest and led to the creation of the official NFL Championship Game in 1933 . 
 = = = Before the Super Bowl = = = 
 Given the interest of the impromptu " championship game " , and the desire of the league to create a more equitable means of determining a champion , the league divided into two conferences beginning in 1933 . The winners of each conference ( the first place teams in the conferences ) will play in the NFL Championship Game after the season . There was no tie @-@ breaker system in place ; any ties in the final standings of either conference resulted in a playoff game being played in 1941 , 1943 , 1947 , two games in 1950 , and one each in 1952 , 1957 , 1958 , and 1965 . Since the venue and date of the championship game were often not known until the last game of the season had been played , these playoff games sometimes resulted in delaying the end of the season by one week . 
 The playoff structure used from 1933 to 1966 was considered inequitable by some because of the number of times it failed to match the teams with the two best records in the championship game , as only the conference winners would qualify for playoff contention . Four times between 1950 and 1966 ( in 1951 , 1956 , 1960 , and 1963 ) the team with the second @-@ best win @-@ loss record did not qualify for the playoffs while the team with the best record in the other conference , but only the third @-@ best in the league , would advance to the championship game . 
 For the 1967 NFL season , the NFL expanded to 16 teams , and split its two conferences into two divisions each , with four teams in each division . The four division champions would advance to the NFL playoffs , and to remain on schedule , a tie @-@ breaker system was introduced . The first round of playoffs determined the conference 's champion and its representative in the NFL Championship Game , played the following week . Thus , 1967 was the first season there was a scheduled playoff tournament to determine the teams to play for the NFL Championship . 
 During the three years ( 1967 – 69 ) that this playoff structure was in effect , there was one use of the tie @-@ breaker system . In 1967 , the Los Angeles Rams and Baltimore Colts ended the season tied at 11 – 1 – 2 for the lead in the Coastal Division . The Colts came into the last game of the season undefeated , but were beaten by the Rams . Though the Colts shared the best win / loss record in the NFL that year , they failed to advance to the playoffs while three other teams with worse records won their divisions . This event figured into the decision in 1970 to include a wild @-@ card team in the playoff tournament after the AFL @-@ NFL merger . 
 During the 1960s , a third @-@ place playoff game was played in Miami , called the Playoff Bowl . It was contested in early January following the 1960 – 69 seasons . Though official playoff games at the time they were played , the NFL now officially classifies these ten games ( and statistics ) as exhibitions , not as playoff games . 
 = = = = AFL and AAFC playoffs = = = = 
 Since it would eventually merge with the NFL , the history of the AFL 's playoff system merits some explanation . For the 1960 – 68 seasons , the AFL used the two @-@ divisional format identical to the NFL to determine its champion . There was no tie @-@ breaker system in place , so ties atop the Eastern Division final standings in 1963 and Western Division in 1968 necessitated playoff games to determine each division 's representative in the championship . 
 For the 1969 season , a first round was added whereby each division winner played the second @-@ place team from the other division . The winners of these games met in the AFL Championship Game . In the only year of this format , the AFL Champion Kansas City Chiefs were the second @-@ place team in the Western division . The Chiefs went on to win Super Bowl IV that season , thus becoming the first non @-@ division winner to win a Super Bowl . 
 During its brief history , the AAFC , who would merge into the NFL for the 1950 season , used an identical playoff format to the NFL from 1946 to 1948 . In 1949 ( its last year ) , the AAFC would merge its two conferences when one of its teams folded , and use a four @-@ team playoff system . In 1948 , the aforementioned issue of playoff inequity came into play when the San Francisco 49ers would miss the playoffs with a 12 – 2 record ; they were in the same conference as the 14 – 0 Cleveland Browns , who would go on to win the Western Conference and then the AAFC 's championship game against the 7 – 7 Buffalo Bills ( AAFC ) . 
 = = = Super Bowl and merger = = = 
 The Super Bowl began as an inter @-@ league championship game between the AFL and NFL , an idea first proposed by Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt . This compromise was the result of pressures the upstart AFL was placing on the older NFL . The success of the rival league would eventually lead to a full merger of the two leagues . 
 From the 1966 season to the 1969 season ( Super Bowls I – IV ) the game featured the champions of the AFL and NFL . Since the 1970 season , the game has featured the champions of the National Football Conference ( NFC ) and the American Football Conference ( AFC ) . 
 When the leagues merged in 1970 , the new NFL ( with 26 teams ) reorganized into two conferences of three divisions each . From the 1970 season to the 1977 season , four teams from each conference ( for a total of eight teams ) qualified for the playoffs each year . These four teams included the three division champions , and a fourth wild @-@ card team . 
 Originally , the home teams in the playoffs were decided based on a yearly rotation . From 1970 to 1974 , the divisional playoff round rotated which of the three division champions would not have home field advantage , with the wild @-@ card teams and the teams they would face in the divisional playoff game would never have home field advantage throughout the playoffs . Starting in 1970 , the divisional playoff games consisted of the AFC Central champions and the NFC West champions playing their games on the road . Then in 1971 it rotated to the AFC East champions and the NFC East champions playing their games on the road . In the 1972 divisional playoff games , the AFC West champions and the NFC Central champions were the visiting teams . And 1973 it would start all over with the AFC Central and NFC West again , and so on . If the " road " division winners advanced to the conference championship games they would be visiting teams again , unless they played a wild @-@ card winner . 
 The rotation system led to several playoff inequities , such as : 
 In 1971 , the top two seeds in each conference met in the divisional round . The teams with the best records in their respective conferences , the Kansas City Chiefs ( AFC ) and Minnesota Vikings ( NFC ) , were ousted by the eventual Super Bowl participants , the Miami Dolphins and Dallas Cowboys . 
 In 1972 , the Dolphins had to take their perfect record to Three Rivers Stadium to face the Pittsburgh Steelers , who went 10 @-@ 3 @-@ 1 , in the AFC championship game . 
 In 1973 , the Cowboys finished 10 @-@ 4 but hosted two 12 @-@ 2 teams , the Los Angeles Rams and Minnesota . 
 The league did not institute a seeding system for the playoffs until 1975 , where the surviving clubs with the higher seeds were made the home teams for each playoff round . Thus , the top seeded division winner played the wild @-@ card team , and the remaining two division winners played at the home stadium of the better seed ( which meant that the lowest @-@ seeded division winner had to open the postseason on the road ) . However , two teams from the same division could not meet prior to the conference championship game . Thus , there would be times when the pairing in the divisional playoff round would be the 1 seed vs. the 3 seed and 2 vs. 4 . 
 = = = Expansion = = = 
 Following an expansion of the regular season from 14 to 16 games in the 1978 season , the league added one more wild @-@ card team for each conference . The two wild @-@ card teams played the week before the division winners . The winner of this game played the top seeded division winner as was done from 1970 – 1977 . The league continued to prohibit intra @-@ divisional games in the divisional playoffs , but allowed such contests in the wild @-@ card round . This ten @-@ team playoff format was used through the 1989 season . Under this system , the Oakland Raiders became the first wild @-@ card team to win a Super Bowl following the 1980 season . 
 During the strike @-@ shortened 1982 season , only nine regular season games were played , and a modified playoff format was instituted . Divisional play was ignored ( there were some cases where division rivals had both games wiped out by the strike , although each division ultimately sent at least one team to the playoffs ) , and the top eight teams from each conference ( based on W @-@ L @-@ T record ) were advanced to the playoffs . As a result , this became the first time that teams with losing records qualified for the playoffs : the 4 – 5 Cleveland Browns and the 4 – 5 Detroit Lions . 
 Several times between 1978 – 89 , the two wild @-@ card games had to be played on different days . Normally they both would be held on Sunday . In 1983 and 1988 , the games were split between Saturday and Monday because Sunday was Christmas , and the NFL had avoided playing on that day at the time . In 1984 , both games were played in the Pacific Time Zone , so they had to be played on Saturday and Sunday to accommodate for time differences . In 1985 , both the New York Giants and Jets hosted wild @-@ card games . As they have shared a home stadium since 1984 , the games had to be played on different days . 
 Since the 1990 season , a third wild @-@ card team for each conference was added , expanding the playoffs to the current twelve teams . The lowest @-@ seeded division winner was then " demoted " to the wild @-@ card weekend . Also , the restrictions on intra @-@ divisional games during the divisional playoffs were removed . 
 The 1990 format continued until the 2002 expansion and reorganization into eight divisions . In this current format , as explained above , the 4 division winners and 2 wild cards are seeded 1 – 6 , with the top 2 seeds receiving byes , and the highest seed in each round guaranteed to play the lowest seed . Also , seeds determine the home @-@ field advantage . 
 = = Modification proposals = = 
 There are some limitations that exist in the current 12 @-@ team playoff system . Since being a division winner is a guaranteed playoff berth , there have been many cases in which a team that wins a " weak " division either barely has a winning record ( as with the 2013 Green Bay Packers ) , or has a .500 or losing record altogether ( such as the 2010 Seattle Seahawks ) . At the same time , since a division winner is seeded higher than the wild cards , non @-@ division winners may end up playing a road game during Wild Card Weekend against a team with an inferior record , or may end up outright missing the playoffs . And going on the road during the first postseason round does not guarantee success : the first time that all four road teams won during Wild Card Weekend occurred during the 2015 – 16 season . 
 This issue has become more prevalent since the aforementioned 2002 realignment . There are three notable examples in which a division winner with a .500 or sub-.500 record ended up winning a playoff game against a team with a superior record : 
 In the 2008 – 09 season , the San Diego Chargers clinched the AFC West with only an 8 – 8 record , and hosted the 12 – 4 Indianapolis Colts in the wild @-@ card round , while the New England Patriots failed to even secure a wild @-@ card spot at 11 – 5 . The Chargers then went on to defeat the Colts in that playoff game . 
 In the 2010 – 11 season , the aforementioned 2010 Seahawks won the NFC West with a 7 – 9 record , hosting and defeating the 11 – 5 New Orleans Saints . Failing to make the playoffs were the New York Giants and Tampa Bay Buccaneers , both with 10 – 6 records . The 2010 Seahawks were the first team in NFL history to win both a division championship and a playoff game with a losing regular season record . They currently have the lowest win percentage of any team to ever make the playoffs . 
 In the 2014 – 15 season , the Carolina Panthers won the NFC South with a 7 – 8 – 1 record . By week 16 , no team in that division could finish with more than seven wins . The Panthers then defeated the Atlanta Falcons , who were 6 – 9 and undefeated within the division entering the game , for the division title . They hosted and defeated the 11 – 5 Arizona Cardinals in the wild card round . The best team to miss the playoffs that year was the Philadelphia Eagles , who finished 10 – 6 . To date , the 2014 Panthers and 2010 Seahawks are the only two teams to win a division , and a playoff game , with a losing record . 
 As a result of this seeding issue , frequent calls have been made to modify the playoff format even further . One proposal has been to expand the playoffs to 14 teams . Proponents of expansion note the increased revenue that could be gained from an additional two playoff games . They also note that the 12 @-@ team playoff system was implemented when the league only had 28 teams and six divisions ( of 4 to 5 teams each ) . The opposition to such a move notes that an expansion of the playoffs would " water down " the field by giving access to lower @-@ caliber teams . Opponents to expansion further point to the NBA playoffs and the NHL playoffs where 16 of 30 teams qualify for the postseason , and there is often a decreased emphasis on regular season performance as a result . 
 After the 2007 playoffs saw two wild @-@ card teams with better records ( Jacksonville Jaguars and eventual Super Bowl XLII champions New York Giants ) go on the road to defeat division winners ( Pittsburgh Steelers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers , respectively ) during wild @-@ card weekend , the NFL explored another proposal to change the playoffs so that the team with the better record would host the game , even if that meant a division winner went on the road . The NFL 's Competition Committee withdrew the request later that offseason , with Atlanta Falcons president Rich McKay mentioning that they wanted the idea to simply get a discussion going . New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft was a strong opponent of the rule change , believing that " if you win a division , it 's good for your fans to know you will have a home game . " 
 Just before the 2010 – 11 Seahawks @-@ Saints playoff game , McKay wanted to revisit the previous proposal to <unk> teams during wild @-@ card weekend . However , sportswriter Peter King wrote that he believed league owners were still hesitant on implementing any such changes at this time due to the then @-@ pending 2011 work stoppage , the proposals to extend the regular season from 16 to 18 games and how it will impact the postseason , and the simple fact that not enough teams have been seriously disadvantaged by the current format . 
 In October 2013 , NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced plans to revisit the idea to expand the playoffs to 14 teams , with the increased revenue gained from the two additional postseason games being used to offset plans to shorten the preseason . The two extra Wild Card games could also be scheduled on the weekend , creating triple @-@ headers on both Saturday and Sunday .

 The 14 @-@ team playoff proposal remained tabled until December 2014 , when no team in the NFC South could finish better than .500 ; Goodell stated that the league would vote on it at the March 2015 Owners ' Meetings .

 Moog for Love is the seventh extended play recorded by British electronic music duo Disclosure , consisting of brothers Howard and Guy Lawrence . The three @-@ track record was released on 15 June 2016 by the labels Island and <unk> Records . 2016 was a year where the duo were developing their skills of writing material while on the road . Its title is named after the 1952 Eddie Jefferson song " Moody 's Mood for Love " . They did not have enough material to produce a full @-@ length album , but wanted to have a record released for the summer of that year regardless . Featuring collaborations with Eats Everything and Al Green , the album garnered generally mixed to positive reviews from music critics , some calling it a significant improvement over the duo 's second studio LP Caracal ( 2015 ) . Upon its release , the album landed at number 80 on the Australian Singles Chart .

 In 2016 , Disclosure had developed their skills of writing songs while on tour , but did not have time to produce enough material for a full @-@ length album . Regardless , the duo wanted to release a record for the summer , reasoning that they felt " strange " not issuing any material to the public in that season . Therefore , they created and distributed a three @-@ track " clubby " extended play that went " back to the start . " Moog for Love was Disclosure 's first record not to feature writing contributions from Jimmy <unk> , which Howard said also " feels quite strange . " With the EP , Disclosure wanted to use more different track development formulas from what they used for making their previous records , Settle ( 2013 ) and Caracal ( 2015 ) , reasoning that they would be making the same music over and over again if they kept making tracks the same way . However , they still had made songs in one similar way they did for Settle , in that there was some material only one of the members would work on , and after the song was finished , both members of the duo would decide if the track was ready for release and inclusion on the album . 
 = = Composition = = 
 Moog for Love 's opening cut , " Boss " , written and arranged in a Los Angeles hotel room for a few days while on the road before being mixed and mastered at home , was the only song on the EP where Disclosure worked on a track together . Driven by a harsh drum loop , the song features singing from Howard Lawrence , his vocal track pitch @-@ shifted down and filtered with <unk> effects . The second track on the EP , " Feel Like I Do " , is a remix of Al Green 's 1972 song " I 'm Still in Love with You " . Guy found the song while listening to a batch of vinyl records , and when Disclosure asked Green and the track 's label permission for use of samples of his recording , Green and the label enjoyed the track the duo had worked on and gave them multitrack stems of the original song for a much cleaner sound of the samples in the track . While the vocals are sped up in " Feel Like I Do , " the strings , horns and electric guitar from Green 's recording remain , with the addition electronic drums and " hazy effects " as Rolling Stone described . " Feel Like I Do " is the only track to not resemble the sound that was on Settle due to its slow tempo and feel . 
 The closing tropical house title track of Moog for Love was analyzed by a NME reviewer to borrow the rich sound that dominated Caracal while having the same tempo that was used for most tracks on Settle . He also noted that the elements of UK garage and house in " Boss " and the title song are similar to those present on tracks from Settle such as " When a Fire Starts to Burn " . Instrumented with " warbled " synthesizers and a pounding bass drum , the song ends with a " hypnotising " sample of the track " Moody 's Mood " , sung and recorded by Brian McKnight . " Moody 's Mood " is a cover of what the EP and its title track is named after , " Moody 's Mood for Love " . A song by Eddie Jefferson , its melody is derived from an improvised solo by jazz saxophonist James Moody . An a cappella group had written lyrics for the melody , and in the recording being sampled by the track , McKnight sings the melody and lyrics . The bassline in the track is also generated by a moog synthesizer .

 On 11 June 2016 , Disclosure premiered " Boss " at the United Kingdom Wildlife Festival , leading to an <unk> reception from the audience according to NME . On 14 June 2016 , " Moog for Love " had a " World Record " premiere on Zane Lowe 's Apple Music show Beats 1 . Both songs became Annie Mac 's " Hottest Record In The World " for 15 June . First available for streaming 14 June 2016 , <unk> and Island Records released Moog for Love for digital download the next day . The EP garnered generally positive reviews upon its distribution , some reviewers calling it significantly better than Caracal . Praising it as a less " grown @-@ up " dance release than Caracal , Lary Bartleet of NME wrote that with Moog for Love , " Disclosure are back in the club , where they belong , but … better . " 
 Wired magazine called Moog for Love one of the " 6 New Albums We Demand You Listen to Immediately " only for " Feel Like I Do " , calling the song " the best Avalanches song the Avalanches didn ’ t make — and the top @-@ down , sun @-@ kissed track you need in your life right now . " Rebecca Haithcoat , who wrote a review for Pitchfork Media , had a more mixed opinion , writing that while the release garners much of the same excitements as the " expert blend of sleek pop and those big , warm and happy belted house hooks of the ‘ 90s " that was on Settle , it was , much like Caracal , not as good as Disclosure 's debut given that it was " uninspired " and that none of the songs on the EP were " immediate or necessary . " Kyle Forward of DIY magazine was also disappointed with the EP , writing that the songs were only " reminders " of their old sound rather than being something much more than " indistinct nothingness " in addition to their previous sound .

 = See No Evil ( Homicide : Life on the Street ) = 
 " See No Evil " is the second episode of the second season of the American police drama television series Homicide : Life on the Street , and the eleventh overall episode of the series . It originally aired on NBC in the United States on January 13 , 1994 . In the episode , Felton 's friend kills his father in an assisted suicide , and Felton tries to convince Lewis to look the other way . In a subplot , Pembleton investigates what appears to be the police shooting of an unarmed suspect . 
 The episode was directed by Chris Menaul and written by series creator Paul Attanasio . Wilford Brimley made a guest appearance as Harry Prentice , an ill and bed @-@ ridden man who convinces his son to help him kill himself . Attanasio deliberately wrote the script so it would be morally questionable whether police handling of both the suicide and the police shooting were done in an ethically correct way . Pembleton 's investigation was based on a real @-@ life investigation into a suspicious shooting featured in David Simon 's non @-@ fiction book Homicide : A Year on the Killing Streets , on which the Homicide series was based . 
 Detectives from the Baltimore Police Department wrote a letter of formal protest to executive producer Barry Levinson over the negative portrayal of police in the episode . According to Nielsen Media Research , " See No Evil " was seen by 12 @.@ 53 million household viewers . Although a drop from the previous episode " Bop Gun " , it was nevertheless considered a strong rating for Homicide , which NBC was still considering whether to renew . The episode received generally positive reviews . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Felton ( Daniel Baldwin ) visits Harry Prentice ( Wilford Brimley ) , the elderly and bed @-@ ridden father of his friend Chuckie ( Michael Chaban ) . Ill and miserable , the hard @-@ bitten Harry has decided he wants to die and has hired a suicide doctor . Felton believes this is wrong and convinces Chuckie to call it off , much to Harry 's anger . A few days later , however , Harry wears Chuckie down and convinces his son to shoot him to death with a handgun . When Lewis ( Clark Johnson ) and Crosetti ( Jon Polito ) investigate , Chuckie claims Harry shot himself , which Lewis does not believe . Felton talks to Chuckie at the police station and Chuckie admits to the assisted suicide , but Felton tells him to stick to the original suicide story . Lewis realizes what happened and confronts Felton , who admits what Chuckie did and suggests it was the right thing to do , but Lewis adamantly disagrees . Since the bullet evidence is inconclusive , Felton asks Lewis to let Chuckie secretly wash his hands so no gunpowder residue will be found in tests . Lewis initially refuses , but he eventually reluctantly agrees , allowing Chuckie to get away with the shooting . 
 Meanwhile , the homicide department is requiring all the detectives to take sensitivity training with therapist Carry Westin ( Jennifer Mendenhall ) . While most of them have positive experiences with her , Bolander ( Ned Beatty ) flatly refuses to participate and repeatedly avoids their scheduled sessions . When Gee ( Yaphet Kotto ) tells Bolander he will be suspended without pay if he does not meet with her , Bolander chooses the suspension , but later reconsiders after his partner Munch ( Richard Belzer ) harasses him at the bar until he changes his mind . When they finally meet , Bolander explains he does not trust therapists because when going through marriage counseling with his ex @-@ wife , the therapist actively encouraged her to leave Bolander . He feels he was cheated out of $ 7 @,@ 000 in therapy bills , but Westin explains his anger is not from the money , but from feelings of betrayal by his ex @-@ wife . Bolander is ultimately impressed by Westin and even decides to ask her on a date , but she strongly hints she is a lesbian . 
 Pembleton ( Andre Braugher ) and Bayliss ( Kyle Secor ) are called to investigate the shooting death of Charles Courtland Cox , a small @-@ time drug peddler shot in the back shortly after a police raid of a crackhouse . When Pembleton suspects a police shooting , Lt. Tyron ( Michael S. Kennedy ) explains Officer Hellriegel ( Jeffrey <unk> ) accidentally shot Cox after falling down and discharging his weapon . However , Hellriegel does not recall details and appears nervous by questioning from Pembleton . Gee is angry with Pembleton 's inquiries into the police , and becomes even angrier when Colonel Granger ( Gerald F. Gough ) and Captain Barnfather ( Clayton LeBouef ) say they will make Hellriegel a scapegoat if the media start suggesting racism or police brutality . Hellriegel is cleared when tests reveal the bullet does not match his gun , but Pembleton requests the firearms of the other officers be tested . Gee refuses to approve the tests , but Pembleton gets Barnfather to order them .

 " See No Evil " was directed by Chris Menaul and written by series creator Paul Attanasio , who had not penned a Homicide script since series premiere " Gone for Goode " . The episode was originally meant to be the second season premiere , but NBC decided to air " Bop Gun " first because it featured a guest appearance by Robin Williams , which the network hoped would lead to increased Nielsen ratings . Like the other three second season episodes , the script for " See No Evil " was already finished by the time the first season ended , but due to poor ratings throughout the duration of the show , NBC executives asked for several refinements – including fewer episode subplots and less camera movements and jump cuts – before approving a second season . Attanasio deliberately wrote the " See No Evil " script so that it would be morally questionable whether the police handling of both main subplots — the assisted suicide and the suspected police shooting — were handled in an ethically correct way . Ultimately , Attanasio wanted it to be up to the audience to interpret for themselves . 
 Pembleton 's investigation of fellow police officers for a suspicious shooting was based on a real @-@ life investigation chronicled in David Simon 's 1991 non @-@ fiction book Homicide : A Year on the Killing Streets , from which the Homicide series was adapted . Baltimore Police Department Detective Donald Worden , on whom the Bolander character is based , handled the actual real @-@ life investigation in 1988 . Lewis ' agreement to help Felton would later be referenced in the third season episode " Crosetti " , when Lewis reminded Felton of the favor while seeking help in stopping Bolander 's investigation into the death of Crosetti . Several members of the Baltimore Police Department publicly criticized Homicide for its negative portrayal of the police in the episode , and 22 detectives wrote a formal letter of protest to executive producer Barry Levinson over the matter . 
 " See No Evil " featured a guest performance by Wilford Brimley as the bed @-@ ridden and suicidal Harry Prentice , as well as Michael Chaban as his son Chuckie Prentice and Jennifer Mendenhall as sensitivity training therapist Carry Westin . The Harry Prentice story line includes his service aboard the SS John W. Brown , with the final scene of the episode filmed in front of that Liberty ship in Baltimore harbor . Mendenhall , predominately a stage actress , was a regular performer with the Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company in Washington , D.C. at the time she appeared in this episode . Michael S. Kennedy , an actor from Richmond , Texas , played Lt. Jimmy Tyron , a part he would reprise in the subsequent episode , " Black and Blue " . A struggling actor , Kennedy received a call in the middle of an all @-@ night shoot in Virginia Beach from a casting director he knew , informing him about the audition for Homicide one day in advance . He so enjoyed working on the show that he wrote a Homicide script himself , with Tyron playing a major part in the story , although it was ultimately never used . The songs " Rhythm and Blues " by Benjamin Antin , and " <unk> " by Lee <unk> " , were featured in " See No Evil " .

 = Vocabulary development = 
 Vocabulary development is a process by which people acquire words . Babbling shifts towards meaningful speech as infants grow and produce their first words around the age of one year . In early word learning , infants build their vocabulary slowly . By the age of 18 months , infants can typically produce about 50 words and begin to make word combinations . 
 In order to build their vocabularies , infants must learn about the meanings that words carry . The mapping problem asks how infants correctly learn to attach words to referents . Constraints theories , domain @-@ general views , social @-@ pragmatic accounts , and an emergentist coalition model have been proposed to account for the mapping problem ... 
 From an early age , infants use language to communicate . Caregivers and other family members use language to teach children how to act in society . In their interactions with peers , children have the opportunity to learn about unique conversational roles . Through pragmatic directions , adults often offer children cues for understanding the meaning of words . 
 Throughout their school years , children continue to build their vocabulary . In particular , children begin to learn abstract words . Beginning around age 3 – 5 , word learning takes place both in conversation and through reading . Word learning often involves physical context , builds on prior knowledge , takes place in social context , and includes semantic support . The phonological loop and serial order short @-@ term memory may both play an important role in vocabulary development . 
 = = Early word learning = = 
 Children begin to produce their first words when they are approximately one year old . Infants ' first words are normally used in reference to things that are of importance to them , such as objects , people , and relevant actions . Also , the first words that infants produce are mostly single @-@ syllabic or repeated single syllables , such as " no " and " dada " . By 12 to 18 months of age , children 's vocabularies often contain words such as " kitty " , " bottle " , " doll " , " car " and " eye " . Children 's understanding of names for objects and people usually precedes their understanding of words that describe actions and relationships . " One " and " two " are the first number words that children learn between the ages of one and two . Infants must be able to hear and play with sounds in their environment , and to break up various phonetic units to discover words and their related meanings . 
 = = = Phonological development = = = 
 Studies related to vocabulary development show that children 's language competence depends upon their ability to hear sounds during infancy . Infants ' perception of speech is distinct . Between six and ten months of age , infants can discriminate sounds used in the languages of the world . By 10 to 12 months , infants can no longer discriminate between speech sounds that are not used in the language ( s ) to which they are exposed . Among six @-@ month @-@ old infants , seen articulations ( i.e. the mouth movements they observe others make while talking ) actually enhance their ability to discriminate sounds , and may also contribute to infants ' ability to learn phonemic boundaries . Infants ' phonological register is completed between the ages of 18 months and 7 years . 
 Children 's phonological development normally proceeds as follows : 
 6 – 8 weeks : <unk> appears 
 16 weeks : Laughter and vocal play appear 
 6 – 9 months : <unk> ( canonical ) babbling appears 
 12 months : First words use a limited sound repertoire 
 18 months : Phonological processes ( deformations of target sounds ) become systematic 
 18 months – 7 years : Phonological inventory completion 
 At each stage mentioned above , children play with sounds and learn methods to help them learn words . There is a relationship between children 's <unk> phonetic skills and their lexical progress at age two : failure to develop the required phonetic skills in their <unk> period results in children 's delay in producing words . Environmental influences may affect children 's phonological development , such as hearing loss as a result of ear infections . Deaf infants and children with hearing problems due to infections are usually delayed in the beginning of vocal babbling . 
 = = = Babbling = = = 
 Babbling is an important aspect of vocabulary development in infants , since it appears to help practice producing speech sounds . Babbling begins between five and seven months of age . At this stage , babies start to play with sounds that are not used to express their emotional or physical states , such as sounds of consonants and vowels . Babies begin to babble in real syllables such as " ba @-@ ba @-@ ba , neh @-@ neh @-@ neh , and dee @-@ dee @-@ dee , " between the ages of seven and eight months ; this is known as canonical babbling . Jargon babbling includes strings of such sounds ; this type of babbling uses intonation but doesn 't convey meaning . The phonemes and syllabic patterns produced by infants begin to be distinctive to particular languages during this period ( e.g. , increased nasal sounds in French and Japanese babies ) though most of their sounds are similar . There is a shift from babbling to the use of words as the infant grows . 
 = = = Vocabulary spurt = = = 
 As children get older their rate of vocabulary growth increases . Children probably understand their first 50 words before they produce them . By the age of eighteen months , children typically attain a vocabulary of 50 words in production , and between two and three times greater in comprehension . A switch from an early stage of slow vocabulary growth to a later stage of faster growth is referred to as the vocabulary spurt . Young toddlers acquire one to three words per month . A vocabulary spurt often occurs overtime as the number of words learned accelerates . It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new words a week . Between the ages of 18 to 24 months , children learn how to combine two words such as no bye @-@ bye and more please . Three @-@ word and four @-@ word combinations appear when most of the child 's utterances are two @-@ word productions . In addition , children are able to form conjoined sentences , using and . This suggests that there is a vocabulary spurt between the time that the child 's first word appears , and when the child is able to form more than two words , and eventually , sentences . However , there have been arguments as to whether or not there is a spurt in acquisition of words . Only about one in five children do have a spurt . This suggests that most children do not have a vocabulary spurt . 
 = = Mapping problem = = 
 In word learning , the mapping problem refers to the question of how infants attach the forms of language to the things that they experience in the world . There are infinite objects , concepts , and actions in the world that words could be mapped onto . Many theories have been proposed to account for the way in which the language learner successfully maps words onto the correct objects , concepts , and actions . 
 While domain @-@ specific accounts of word learning argue for innate constraints that limit infants ' hypotheses about word meanings , domain @-@ general perspectives argue that word learning can be accounted for by general cognitive processes , such as learning and memory , which are not specific to language . Yet other theorists have proposed social pragmatic accounts , which stress the role of caregivers in guiding infants through the word learning process . According to some research , however , children are active participants in their own word learning , although caregivers may still play an important role in this process . Recently , an emergentist coalition model has also been proposed to suggest that word learning cannot be fully attributed to a single factor . Instead , a variety of cues , including salient and social cues , may be utilized by infants at different points in their vocabulary development . 
 = = = Theories of constraints = = = 
 Theories of constraints argue for biases or default assumptions that guide the infant through the word learning process . Constraints are outside of the infant 's control and are believed to help the infant limit their hypotheses about the meaning of words that they encounter daily . Constraints can be considered domain @-@ specific ( unique to language ) . 
 Critics argue that theories of constraints focus on how children learn nouns , but ignore other aspects of their word learning . Although constraints are useful in explaining how children limit possible meanings when learning novel words , the same constraints would eventually need to be overridden because they are not utilized in adult language . For instance , adult speakers often use several terms , each term meaning something slightly different , when referring to one entity , such as a family pet . This practice would violate the mutual exclusivity constraint . 
 Below , the most prominent constraints in the literature are detailed : 
 Reference is the notion that a word symbolizes or stands in for an object , action , or event . Words consistently stand for their referents , even if referents are not physically present in context . 
 Mutual <unk> is the assumption that each object in the world can only be referred to by a single label . 
 Shape has been considered to be one of the most critical properties for identifying members of an object category . Infants assume that objects that have the same shape also share a name . Shape plays an important role in both appropriate and inappropriate extensions . 
 The Whole Object Assumption is the belief that labels refer to whole objects instead of parts or properties of those objects . Children are believed to hold this assumption because they typically label whole objects first , and parts of properties of objects later in development . 
 The Taxonomic Assumption reflects the belief that speakers use words to refer to categories that are internally consistent . Labels to pick out coherent categories of objects , rather than those objects and the things that are related to them . For example , children assume that the word " dog " refers to the category of " dogs " , not to " dogs with bones " , or " dogs chasing cats " . 
 = = = Domain @-@ general views = = = 
 Domain @-@ general views of vocabulary development argue that children do not need principles or constraints in order to successfully develop word @-@ world mappings . Instead , word learning can be accounted for through general learning mechanisms such as salience , association , and frequency . Children are thought to notice the objects , actions , or events that are most salient in context , and then to associate them with the words that are most frequently used in their presence . Additionally , research on word learning suggests that fast mapping , the rapid learning that children display after a single exposure to new information , is not specific to word learning . Children can also successfully fast map when exposed to a novel fact , remembering both words and facts after a time delay . 
 Domain @-@ general views have been criticized for not fully explaining how children manage to avoid mapping errors when there are numerous possible referents to which objects , actions , or events might point . For instance , if biases are not present from birth , why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects , instead of salient parts of these objects ? However , domain @-@ general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases . Rather , they suggest biases develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built @-@ in constraints . For instance , the whole object bias could be explained as a strategy that humans use to reason about the world ; perhaps we are prone to thinking about our environment in terms of whole objects , and this strategy is not specific to the language domain . Additionally , children may be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process , which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel objects and labels . Ordinary learning could , then , lead to a shape bias . 
 = = = Social pragmatic theories = = = 
 Social pragmatic theories , also in contrast to the constraints view , focus on the social context in which the infant is embedded . According to this approach , environmental input removes the ambiguity of the word learning situation . Cues such as the caregiver 's gaze , body language , gesture , and smile help infants to understand the meanings of words . Social pragmatic theories stress the role of the caregiver in talking about objects , actions , or events that the infant is already focused @-@ in upon . 
 Joint attention is an important mechanism through which children learn to map words @-@ to @-@ world , and vice versa . Adults commonly make an attempt to establish joint attention with a child before they convey something to the child . Joint attention is often accompanied by physical co @-@ presence , since children are often focused on what is in their immediate environment . As well , conversational co @-@ presence is likely to occur ; the caregiver and child typically talk together about whatever is taking place at their locus of joint attention . Social pragmatic perspectives often present children as <unk> detectors , who simply associate the words that they hear with whatever they are attending to in the world at the same time . The co @-@ variation detection model of joint attention seems problematic when we consider that many caregiver utterances do not refer to things that occupy the immediate attentional focus of infants . For instance , caregivers among the <unk> , a group of indigenous peoples living in New Guinea , rarely provide labels in the context of their referents . While the <unk> detection model emphasizes the caregiver 's role in the meaning @-@ making process , some theorists argue that infants also play an important role in their own word learning , actively avoiding mapping errors . When infants are in situations where their own attentional focus differs from that of a speaker , they seek out information about the speaker 's focus , and then use that information to establish correct word @-@ referent mappings . Joint attention can be created through infant agency , in an attempt to gather information about a speaker 's intent . 
 From early on , children also assume that language is designed for communication . Infants treat communication as a cooperative process . Specifically , infants observe the principles of conventionality and contrast . According to conventionality , infants believe that for a particular meaning that they wish to convey , there is a term that everyone in the community would expect to be used . According to contrast , infants act according to the notion that differences in form mark differences in meaning . Children 's attention to conventionality and contrast is demonstrated in their language use , even before the age of 2 years ; they direct their early words towards adult targets , repair mispronunciations quickly if possible , ask for words to relate to the world around them , and maintain contrast in their own word use . 
 = = = <unk> coalition model = = = 
 The emergentist coalition model suggests that children make use of multiple cues to successfully attach a novel label to a novel object . The word learning situation may offer an infant combinations of social , perceptual , cognitive , and linguistic cues . While a range of cues are available from the start of word learning , it may be the case that not all cues are utilized by the infant when they begin the word learning process . While younger children may only be able to detect a limited number of cues , older , more experienced word learners may be able to make use of a range of cues . For instance , young children seem to focus primarily on perceptual salience , but older children attend to the gaze of caregivers and use the focus of caregivers to direct their word mapping . Therefore , this model argues that principles or cues may be present from the onset of word learning , but the use of a wide range of cues develops over time . 
 Supporters of the emergentist coalition model argue that , as a hybrid , this model moves towards a more holistic explanation of word learning that is not captured by models with a singular focus . For instance , constraints theories typically argue that constraints / principles are available to children from the onset of word learning , but do not explain how children develop into expert speakers who are not limited by constraints . Additionally , some argue that domain @-@ general perspectives do not fully address the question of how children sort through numerous potential referents in order to correctly sort out meaning . Lastly , social pragmatic theories claim that social encounters guide word learning . Although these theories describe how children become more advanced word learners , they seem to tell us little about children 's capacities at the start of word learning . According to its proponents , the emergentist <unk> model incorporates constraints / principles , but argues for the development and change in these principles over time , while simultaneously taking into consideration social aspects of word learning alongside other cues , such as salience . 
 = = Pragmatic development = = 
 Both linguistic and socio @-@ cultural factors affect the rate at which vocabulary develops . Children must learn to use their words appropriately and strategically in social situations . They have flexible and powerful social @-@ cognitive skills that allow them to understand the communicative intentions of others in a wide variety of interactive situations . Children learn new words in communicative situations . Children rely on pragmatic skills to build more extensive vocabularies . Some aspects of pragmatic behaviour can predict later literacy and mathematical achievement , as children who are pragmatically skilled often function better in school . These children are also generally better liked . 
 Children use words differently for objects , spatial relations and actions . Children ages one to three often rely on general purpose deictic words such as " here " , " that " or " look " accompanied by a gesture , which is most often pointing , to pick out specific objects . Children also stretch already known or partly known words to cover other objects that appear similar to the original . This can result in word overextension or misuses of words . Word overextension is governed by the perceptual similarities children notice among the different referents . <unk> of words indirectly provide ways of finding out which meanings children have attached to particular words . When children come into contact with spatial relations , they talk about the location of one object with respect to another . They name the object located and use a deictic term , such as here or " there " for location , or they name both the object located and its location . They can also use a general purpose locative marker , which is a preposition , postposition or suffix depending on the language that is linked in some way to the word for location . Children 's earliest words for actions usually encode both the action and its result . Children use a small number of general purpose verbs , such as " do " and " make " for a large variety of actions because their resources are limited . Children acquiring a second language seem to use the same production strategies for talking about actions . Sometimes children use a highly specific verb instead of a general purpose verb . In both cases children stretch their resources to communicate what they want to say . 
 Infants use words to communicate early in life and their communication skills develop as they grow older . Communication skills aid in word learning . Infants learn to take turns while communicating with adults . While preschoolers lack precise timing and rely on obvious speaker cues , older children are more precise in their timing and take fewer long pauses . Children get better at initiating and sustaining coherent conversations as they age . Toddlers and preschoolers use strategies such as repeating and recasting their partners ' utterances to keep the conversation going . Older children add new relevant information to conversations . <unk> such as then , so , and because are more frequently used as children get older . When giving and responding to feedback , preschoolers are inconsistent , but around the age of six , children can mark corrections with phrases and head nods to indicate their continued attention . As children continue to age they provide more constructive interpretations back to listeners , which helps prompt conversations . 
 = = = Pragmatic influences = = = 
 Caregivers use language to help children become competent members of society and culture . From birth , infants receive pragmatic information . They learn structure of conversations from early interactions with caregivers . Actions and speech are organized in games , such as <unk> to provide children with information about words and phrases . Caregivers find many ways to help infants interact and respond . As children advance and participate more actively in interactions , caregivers adapt their interactions accordingly . Caregivers also prompt children to produce correct pragmatic behaviours . They provide input about what children are expected to say , how to speak , when they should speak , and how they can stay on topic . Caregivers may model the appropriate behaviour , using verbal reinforcement , posing a hypothetical situation , addressing children 's comments , or evaluating another person . 
 Family members contribute to pragmatic development in different ways . Fathers often act as secondary caregivers , and may know the child less intimately . Older siblings may lack the capacity to acknowledge the child 's needs . As a result , both fathers and siblings may pressure children to communicate more clearly . They often challenge children to improve their communication skills , therefore preparing them to communicate with strangers about unfamiliar topics . Fathers have more breakdowns when communicating with infants , and spend less time focused on the same objects or actions as infants . Siblings are more directive and less responsive to infants , which motivates infants to participate in conversations with their older siblings . There are limitations to studies that focus on the influences of fathers and siblings , as most research is descriptive and <unk> . In reality , there are many variations of family configurations , and context influences parent behaviour more than parent gender does . The majority of research in this field is conducted with mother / child pairs . 
 Peers help expose children to multi @-@ party conversations . This allows children to hear a greater variety of speech , and to observe different conversational roles . Peers may be uncooperative conversation partners , which pressures the children to communicate more effectively . Speaking to peers is different from speaking to adults , but children may still correct their peers . Peer interaction provides children with a different experience filled with special humour , disagreements and conversational topics . 
 Culture and context in infants ’ linguistic environment shape their vocabulary development . English learners have been found to map novel labels to objects more reliably than to actions compared to Mandarin learners . This early noun bias in English learners is caused by the culturally reinforced tendency for English speaking caregivers to engage in a significant amount of <unk> labelling as well as noun @-@ friendly activities such as picture book reading . Adult speech provides children with grammatical input . Both Mandarin and Cantonese languages have a category of grammatical function word called a noun classifier , which is also common across many genetically unrelated East Asian languages . In Cantonese , classifiers are obligatory and specific in more situations than in Mandarin . This accounts for the research found on Mandarin @-@ speaking children outperforming Cantonese @-@ speaking children in relation to the size of their vocabulary . 
 = = = Pragmatic directions = = = 
 Pragmatic directions provide children with additional information about the speaker 's intended meaning . Children 's learning of new word meanings is guided by the pragmatic directions that adults offer , such as explicit links to word meanings . Adults present young children with information about how words are related to each other through connections , such as " is a part of " , " is a kind of " , " belongs to " , or " is used for " . These pragmatic directions provide children with essential information about language , allowing them to make inferences about possible meanings for unfamiliar words . This is also called inclusion . When children are provided with two words related by inclusion , they hold on to that information . When children hear an adult say an incorrect word , and then repair their mistake by stating the correct word , children take into account the repair when assigning meanings to the two words . 
 = = Vocabulary development in school @-@ age children = = 
 Vocabulary development during the school years builds upon what the child already knows , and the child uses this knowledge to broaden his or her vocabulary . Once children have gained a level of vocabulary knowledge , new words are learned through explanations using familiar , or " old " words . This is done either explicitly , when a new word is defined using old words , or implicitly , when the word is set in the context of old words so that the meaning of the new word is constrained . When children reach school @-@ age , context and implicit learning are the most common ways in which their vocabularies continue to develop . By this time , children learn new vocabulary mostly through conversation and reading . Throughout schooling and adulthood , conversation and reading are the main methods in which vocabulary develops . This growth tends to slow once a person finishes schooling , as they have already acquired the vocabulary used in everyday conversation and reading material and generally are not engaging in activities that require additional vocabulary development . 
 During the first few years of life , children are mastering concrete words such as " car " , " bottle " , " dog " , " cat " . By age 3 , children are likely able to learn these concrete words without the need for a visual reference , so word learning tends to accelerate around this age . Once children reach school @-@ age , they learn abstract words ( e.g. " love " , " freedom " , " success " ) . This broadens the vocabulary available for children to learn , which helps to account for the increase in word learning evident at school age . By age 5 , children tend to have an expressive vocabulary of 2 @,@ 100 – 2 @,@ 200 words . By age 6 , they have approximately 2 @,@ 600 words of expressive vocabulary and 20 @,@ 000 – 24 @,@ 000 words of receptive vocabulary . Some claim that children experience a sudden acceleration in word learning , upwards of 20 words per day , but it tends to be much more gradual than this . From age 6 to 8 , the average child in school is learning 6 – 7 words per day , and from age 8 to 12 , approximately 12 words per day . 
 = = = Means for vocabulary development = = = 
 Exposure to conversations and engaging in conversation with others help school @-@ age children develop vocabulary . Fast mapping is the process of learning a new concept upon a single exposure and is used in word learning not only by infants and toddlers , but by preschool children and adults as well . This principle is very useful for word learning in conversational settings , as words tend not to be explained explicitly in conversation , but may be referred to frequently throughout the span of a conversation . 
 Reading is considered to be a key element of vocabulary development in school @-@ age children . Before children are able to read on their own , children can learn from others reading to them . Learning vocabulary from these experiences includes using context , as well as explicit explanations of words and / or events in the story . This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide explanation and provide a visual reference or comparisons , usually to prior knowledge and past experiences . Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child 's repetition of the new word back to the adult . When a child begins to learn to read , their print vocabulary and oral vocabulary tend to be the same , as children use their vocabulary knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms . These two forms of vocabulary are usually equal up until grade 3 . Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language , print vocabulary begins to expand beyond oral vocabulary . By age 10 , children 's vocabulary development through reading moves away from learning concrete words to learning abstract words . 
 Generally , both conversation and reading involve at least one of the four principles of context that are used in word learning and vocabulary development : physical context , prior knowledge , social context and semantic support . 
 = = = = Physical context = = = = 
 Physical context involves the presence of an object or action that is also the topic of conversation . With the use of physical context , the child is exposed to both the words and a visual reference of the word . This is frequently used with infants and toddlers , but can be very beneficial for school @-@ age children , especially when learning rare or infrequently used words . Physical context may include props such as in toy play . When engaging in play with an adult , a child 's vocabulary is developed through discussion of the toys , such as naming the object ( e.g. " dinosaur " ) or labeling it with the use of a rare word ( e.g. , stegosaurus ) . These sorts of interactions expose the child to words they may not otherwise encounter in day @-@ to @-@ day conversation . 
 = = = = Prior knowledge = = = = 
 Past experiences or general knowledge is often called upon in conversation , so it is a useful context for children to learn words . Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual , tactical , oral , and / or auditory references . For example , if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant , but did not know the word elephant , an adult could later help the child recall this event , describing the size and color of the animal , how big its ears were , its trunk , and the sound it made , then using the word elephant to refer to the animal . Calling upon prior knowledge is used not only in conversation , but often in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating it back to the child 's own experiences . 
 = = = = Social context = = = = 
 Social context involves pointing out social norms and violations of these norms . This form of context is most commonly found in conversation , as opposed to reading or other word learning environments . A child 's understanding of social norms can help them to infer the meaning of words that occur in conversation . In an English @-@ speaking tradition , " please " and " thank you " are taught to children at a very early age , so they are very familiar to the child by school @-@ age . For example , if a group of people is eating a meal with the child present and one person says , " give me the bread " and another responds with , " that was rude . What do you say ? " , and the person responds with " please " , the child may not know the meaning of " rude " , but can infer its meaning through social context and understanding the necessity of saying " please " . 
 = = = = Semantic support = = = = 
 Semantic support is the most obvious method of vocabulary development in school @-@ age children . It involves giving direct verbal information of the meaning of a word . By the time children are in school , they are active participants in conversation , so they are very capable and willing to ask questions when they do not understand a word or concept . For example , a child might see a zebra for the first time and ask , what is that ? and the parent might respond , that is a zebra . It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it . 
 = = = Pictures support = = = 
 Pictures support involves two memory techniques - association and visualization . Associating an image with a word helps a user learn word in a more effective way . <unk> Agarwal , Founder of <unk> mentioned in his interview to <unk> - " memory aid for each word help student learn words more faster and effectively " 
 = = = Memory and vocabulary development = = = 
 Memory plays an important role in vocabulary development , however the exact role that it plays is disputed in the literature . Specifically , short @-@ term memory and how its capacities work with vocabulary development is questioned by many researchers . 
 The phonology of words has proven to be beneficial to vocabulary development when children begin school . Once children have developed a vocabulary , they utilize the sounds that they already know to learn new words . The phonological loop encodes , maintains and manipulates speech @-@ based information that a person encounters . This information is then stored in the phonological memory , a part of short term memory . Research shows that children 's capacities in the area of phonological memory are linked to vocabulary knowledge when children first begin school at age 4 – 5 years old . As memory capabilities tend to increase with age ( between age 4 and adolescence ) , so does an individual 's ability to learn more complex vocabulary . 
 Serial @-@ order short @-@ term memory may be critical to the development of vocabulary . As lexical knowledge increases , phonological representations have to become more precise to determine the differences between similar sound words ( i.e. " calm " , " come " ) . In this theory , the specific order or sequence of phonological events is used to learn new words , rather than phonology as a whole . 
 = Albert Bridge , London = 
 The Albert Bridge is a road bridge over the River Thames in West London , connecting Chelsea on the north bank to Battersea on the south bank . Designed and built by Rowland Mason Ordish in 1873 as an Ordish – Lefeuvre system modified cable @-@ stayed bridge , it proved to be structurally unsound , so between 1884 and 1887 Sir Joseph Bazalgette incorporated some of the design elements of a suspension bridge . In 1973 the Greater London Council added two concrete piers , which transformed the central span into a simple beam bridge . As a result , today the bridge is an unusual hybrid of three different design styles . It is an English Heritage Grade II * listed building . 
 Built as a toll bridge , it was commercially unsuccessful . Six years after its opening it was taken into public ownership and the tolls were lifted . The tollbooths remained in place and are the only surviving examples of bridge tollbooths in London . Nicknamed " The Trembling Lady " because of its tendency to vibrate when large numbers of people walked over it , the bridge has signs at its entrances that warned troops to break step whilst crossing the bridge . 
 Incorporating a roadway only 27 feet ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) wide , and with serious structural weaknesses , the bridge was ill @-@ equipped to cope with the advent of the motor vehicle during the 20th century . Despite the many calls for its demolition or pedestrianisation , the Albert Bridge has remained open to vehicles throughout its existence , other than for brief spells during repairs , and is one of only two Thames road bridges in central London never to have been replaced . The strengthening work carried out by Bazalgette and the Greater London Council did not prevent further deterioration of the bridge 's structure . A series of increasingly strict traffic control measures have been introduced to limit its use and thus prolong its life , making it the least busy Thames road bridge in London , except for the little @-@ used Southwark Bridge . The bridge 's condition is continuing to degrade as the result of traffic load and severe rotting of the timber deck structure caused by the urine of the many dogs using it as a route to nearby Battersea Park . 
 In 1992 , the Albert Bridge was rewired and painted in an unusual colour scheme designed to make it more conspicuous in poor visibility , and avoid being damaged by ships . At night it is illuminated by 4 @,@ 000 bulbs , making it one of west London 's most striking landmarks . In 2010 – 2011 , these were replaced with LEDs . 
 = = History = = 
 The historic industrial town of Chelsea on the north bank of the River Thames about 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) west of Westminster , and the rich farming village of Battersea , facing Chelsea on the south bank , were linked by the modest wooden Battersea Bridge in 1771 . In 1842 the Commission of Woods , Forests , and Land Revenues recommended the construction of an embankment at Chelsea to free land for development , and proposed a new bridge downstream of Battersea Bridge , and the replacement of the latter by a more modern structure . Work on the Victoria Bridge ( later renamed Chelsea Bridge ) , a short distance downstream of Battersea Bridge , began in 1851 and was completed in 1858 , with work on the Chelsea Embankment beginning in 1862 . Meanwhile , the proposal to demolish Battersea Bridge was abandoned . 
 The wooden Battersea Bridge had become dilapidated by the mid @-@ 19th century . It had grown unpopular and was considered unsafe . The newer Victoria Bridge , meanwhile , suffered severe congestion . In 1860 , Prince Albert suggested that a new <unk> built between the two existing bridges would be profitable , and in the early 1860s the Albert Bridge Company was formed with the aim of building this new crossing . A proposal put forward in 1863 was blocked by strong opposition from the operators of Battersea Bridge , which was less than 500 yards ( 460 m ) from the proposed site of the new bridge and whose owners were consequently concerned over potential loss of custom . A compromise was reached , and in 1864 a new Act of Parliament was passed , authorising the new bridge on condition that it was completed within five years . The Act compelled the Albert Bridge Company to purchase Battersea Bridge once the new bridge opened , and to compensate its owners by paying them £ 3 @,@ 000 per annum ( about £ 266 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) in the interim . 
 Rowland Mason Ordish was appointed to design the new bridge . Ordish was a leading architectural engineer who had worked on the Royal Albert Hall , St Pancras railway station , the Crystal Palace and Holborn Viaduct . The bridge was built using the Ordish – Lefeuvre system , an early form of cable @-@ stayed bridge design which Ordish had patented in 1858 . Ordish 's design resembled a conventional suspension bridge in employing a parabolic cable to support the centre of the bridge , but differed in its use of 32 inclined stays to support the remainder of the load . Each stay consisted of a flat wrought iron bar attached to the bridge deck , and a wire rope composed of 1 @,@ 000 1 ⁄ 10 @-@ inch ( 2 @.@ 5 mm ) diameter wires joining the wrought iron bar to one of the four octagonal support columns . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Although authorised in 1864 , work on the bridge was delayed by negotiations over the proposed Chelsea Embankment , since the bridge 's design could not be completed until the exact layout of the new roads being built on the north bank of the river had been agreed . While plans for the Chelsea Embankment were debated , Ordish built the Franz Joseph Bridge over the Vltava in Prague to the same design as that intended for the Albert Bridge . 
 In 1869 , the time allowed by the 1864 Act to build the bridge expired . Delays caused by the Chelsea Embankment project meant that work on the bridge had not even begun , and a new Act of Parliament was required to extend the time limit . Construction finally got underway in 1870 , and it was anticipated that the bridge would be completed in about a year , at a cost of £ 70 @,@ 000 ( about £ 5 @.@ 83 million in 2016 ) . In the event , the project ran for over three years , and the final bill came to £ 200 @,@ 000 ( about £ 16 million in 2016 ) . It was intended to open the bridge and the Chelsea Embankment in a joint ceremony in 1874 , but the Albert Bridge Company was keen to start recouping the substantially higher than expected costs , and the bridge opened without any formal ceremony on 23 August 1873 , almost ten years after its authorisation . As the law demanded , the Albert Bridge Company then bought Battersea Bridge . 
 Ordish 's bridge was 41 feet ( 12 m ) wide and 710 feet ( 220 m ) long , with a 384 @-@ foot @-@ 9 @-@ inch ( 117 @.@ 27 m ) central span . The deck was supported by 32 rigid steel rods suspended from four octagonal cast iron towers , with the towers resting on cast iron piers . The four piers were cast at Battersea and floated down the river into position , at which time they were filled with concrete ; at the time they were the largest castings ever made . Unlike most other suspension bridges of the time , the towers were positioned outside the bridge to avoid causing any obstruction to the roadway . At each entrance was a pair of tollbooths with a bar between them , to prevent people entering the bridge without paying . 
 The bridge acquired the nickname of " The Trembling Lady " because of its tendency to vibrate , particularly when used by troops from the nearby Chelsea Barracks . Concerns about the risks of mechanical resonance effects on suspension bridges , following the 1831 collapse of the Broughton Suspension Bridge and the 1850 collapse of Angers Bridge , led to notices being placed at the entrances warning troops to break step ( i.e. not to march in rhythm ) when crossing the bridge ; Although the barracks closed in 2008 , the warning signs are still in place . 
 = = Transfer to public ownership = = 
 The Albert Bridge was catastrophically unsuccessful financially . By the time the new bridge opened , the Albert Bridge Company had been paying compensation to the Battersea Bridge Company for nine years , and on completion of the new bridge became liable for the costs of repairing the by then dilapidated and dangerous structure . The cost of subsidising Battersea Bridge drained funds intended for the building of wide approach roads , making the bridge difficult to reach . Located slightly further from central London than neighbouring Victoria ( Chelsea ) Bridge , demand for the new bridge was less than expected , and in the first nine months of its operation only £ 2 @,@ 085 ( about £ 175 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) were taken in tolls . 
 In 1877 the Metropolis Toll Bridges Act was passed , which allowed the Metropolitan Board of Works to buy all London bridges between Hammersmith and Waterloo bridges and free them from tolls . In 1879 , The Albert Bridge , which had cost £ 200 @,@ 000 to build , was bought by the Board of Works along with Battersea Bridge for a combined price of £ 170 @,@ 000 ( about £ 15 @.@ 6 million in 2016 ) . The tolls were removed from both bridges on 24 May 1879 , but the octagonal tollbooths were left in place , and today are the only surviving bridge tollbooths in London . 
 = = Structural weaknesses = = 
 In 1884 the Board of Works ' Chief Engineer Sir Joseph Bazalgette conducted an inspection of the bridge and found that the iron rods were already showing serious signs of corrosion . Over the next three years the staying rods were augmented with steel chains , giving it an appearance more closely resembling a conventional suspension bridge , and a new timber deck was laid , at a total cost of £ 25 @,@ 000 ( about £ 2 @.@ 35 million in 2016 ) . Despite these improvements , Bazalgette was still concerned about its structural integrity and a weight limit of five tons was imposed on vehicles using the bridge . 
 With a roadway only 27 feet ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) wide and subject to weight restrictions from early on , the Albert Bridge was ill @-@ suited to the advent of motorised transport in the 20th century . In 1926 the Royal Commission on Cross @-@ River Traffic recommended demolition and rebuilding of the bridge to carry four lanes of traffic , but the plan was not carried out because of a shortage of funds in the Great Depression . It continued to deteriorate , and in 1935 the weight limit was reduced to two tons . 
 Because of its ongoing structural weaknesses , in 1957 the London County Council proposed replacing the Albert Bridge with a more conventional design . A protest campaign led by John Betjeman resulted in the withdrawal of the proposal , but serious concerns about the integrity of the bridge continued . In 1964 an experimental tidal flow scheme was introduced , in which only northbound traffic was permitted to use the bridge in the mornings and southbound traffic in the evenings . The bridge 's condition continued to deteriorate however , and in 1970 the Greater London Council ( GLC ) sought and obtained consent to carry out strengthening work . In April 1972 the bridge was closed for the work to be carried out . 
 = = = <unk> park proposal = = = 
 The GLC 's solution entailed adding two concrete piers in the middle of the river to support the central span and thus transform the bridge 's central section into a beam bridge . The bridge 's main girder was also strengthened , and a lightweight replacement deck was laid . The modifications were intended to be a stopgap measure to extend the bridge 's life by five years while a replacement was being considered ; in the GLC 's estimation the work would last for a maximum of 30 years , but the bridge would need to be either closed or replaced well before then . 
 In early 1973 , the Architectural Review submitted a proposal to convert the Albert Bridge into a landscaped public park and pedestrian footpath across the river . The proposal proved very popular with the area 's residents , and a May 1973 campaign led by John Betjeman , Sybil Thorndike and Laurie Lee raised a petition of 2 @,@ 000 signatures for the bridge to be permanently closed to traffic . Although the GLC reopened the bridge to traffic in July 1973 , it also announced its intention to proceed with the Architectural Review scheme once legal matters had been dealt with . 
 The Royal Automobile Club campaigned vigorously against the pedestrianisation proposal . A publicity campaign fronted by actress Diana Dors in favour of reopening the bridge was launched , whilst a lobbying group of local residents led by poet Robert Graves campaigned in support of the GLC 's plan . Graves 's campaign collected over a thousand signatures in support , but was vigorously attacked by the British Road Federation , who derided the apparent evidence of public support for the scheme as " sending a lot of students around to council flats [ where ] most people will sign anything without knowing what it is all about " . A public enquiry of 1974 recommended that the bridge remain open to avoid congestion on neighbouring bridges , and it remained open to traffic with the tidal flow and 2 @-@ ton weight limit in place . 
 = = Present day = = 
 In 1990 , the tidal flow system was abandoned and the Albert Bridge was converted back to two @-@ way traffic . A traffic island was installed on the south end of the bridge to prevent larger vehicles from using it . In the early years of the 21st century the Chelsea area experienced a growth in the popularity of large four @-@ wheel drive cars ( so @-@ called Chelsea tractors ) , many of which were over the two @-@ ton weight limit ; it was estimated that one third of all vehicles using the bridge were over the weight limit . In July 2006 the 27 @-@ foot ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) wide roadway was narrowed to a single lane in each direction to reduce the load . Red and white plastic barriers have been erected along the roadway in an effort to protect the structure from damage by cars . 
 Between 1905 and 1981 the Albert Bridge was painted uniformly green ; in 1981 it was repainted yellow . In 1992 it was redecorated and rewired . Partially as a result , it is now a major West London landmark . The bridge is painted in pink , blue and green to increase visibility in fog and murky light and thus to reduce the risks of ships colliding with the fragile structure during the day . At night , a network of 4 @,@ 000 low @-@ voltage tungsten @-@ halogen bulbs illuminate the bridge . In 1993 the innovative use of long @-@ life low @-@ energy lighting was commended by Mary Archer , at the time Chairwoman of the National Energy Foundation . Its distinctive and striking current appearance has led to its use as a backdrop for numerous films set in the Chelsea area , such as Absolute Beginners , Sliding Doors and Maybe Baby . 
 Except for Tower Bridge , built in 1894 , the Albert Bridge is the only Thames road bridge in central London never to have been replaced . Intended as a temporary measure to be removed in 1978 , the concrete central piers remain in place , and although in 1974 its lifespan was estimated at a maximum of 30 years , the bridge is still standing and operational . The Albert Bridge was protected as a Grade II * listed structure in 1975 , granting it protection against significant alteration without consultation . It continues to deteriorate . Although proposals have been drawn up by Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council to repair and rescue it , by March 2008 funds for the repairs were unavailable . As well as structural damage caused by traffic , the timbers underpinning the deck are being seriously rotted by the urine of dogs crossing to and from nearby Battersea Park . With multiple measures in place to reduce traffic flow and prolong the life of the bridge , in 2009 it carried approximately 19 @,@ 000 vehicles per day , the lowest usage of any Thames road bridge in London other than the little @-@ used Southwark Bridge . 
 = = = Refurbishment of 2010 – 2011 = = = 
 The bridge was closed to motor vehicles on 15 February 2010 for refurbishment and strengthening . It was originally expected to remain closed for approximately 18 months , but after the condition of the bridge was found to be worse than expected , it was closed for 22 months . All of the timber in the decking as well as the footway that had rotted away were replaced , with additional timber added for strengthening . Surfaces at the carriageway and pavement decking were replaced . New steel structures were added to strengthen the bridge . All the lightbulbs were changed to more energy @-@ efficient ones . The tollbooths were refurbished . All twelve layers of paint were stripped down until the bare metal was exposed , which was repaired and treated before three new coats of paint were added . The whole project cost £ 7 @.@ 2 million of which the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea provided 25 % of the cost and the other 75 % was provided by Transport for London . 
 It re @-@ opened on 2 December 2011 , when two dogs named Prince and Albert , from nearby Battersea Dogs and Cats Home , walked across the bridge . All of the Grade II features were retained . 
 = Bowfin = 
 Bowfin ( Amia <unk> ) are basal bony fishes related to gars in the infraclass Holostei . Common names include <unk> , mud pike , dogfish , griddle , <unk> , cypress trout and <unk> . They are regarded as taxonomic relicts , being the sole surviving species of the order Amiiformes which dates from the Jurassic to the Eocene , persisting to the present . Although bowfin are highly evolved , they are often referred to as " primitive fishes " because they have retained some morphological characteristics of their early ancestors . 
 Bowfin are demersal freshwater piscivores native to North America , and commonly found throughout much of the eastern United States , and in southern Ontario and Quebec . Fossil deposits indicate Amiiformes were once widespread in both freshwater and marine environments with a range that spanned across North and South America , Europe , Asia and Africa . Now their range is limited to much of the eastern United States and adjacent southern Canada , including the drainage basins of the Mississippi River , Great Lakes and various rivers exiting in the Eastern Seaboard or Gulf of Mexico . Their preferred habitat includes vegetated sloughs , lowland rivers and lakes , swamps and backwater areas ; they are also occasionally found in brackish water . They are stalking , ambush predators known to move into the shallows at night to prey on fish and aquatic invertebrates such as crawfish , mollusks , and aquatic insects . 
 Like gars , bowfin are bimodal breathers which means they have the capacity to breathe both water and air . Their gills exchange gases in the water allowing them to exploit oxygen for breathing , but they also have a gas bladder that serves to maintain buoyancy , and also allows them to breathe air by means of a small pneumatic duct connected from the foregut to the gas bladder . They can break the surface to gulp air , which allows them to survive conditions of aquatic hypoxia that would be lethal to most other species . 
 = = Morphology = = 
 The average length of a bowfin is 50 cm ( 20 in ) ; females typically grow to 65 – 70 cm ( 26 – 28 in ) , males to 50 – 65 cm ( 20 – 26 in ) . Records indicate bowfin can reach 109 cm ( 43 in ) in length , and weigh 9 @.@ 75 kg ( 21 @.@ 5 lb ) . Young of the year typically grow to 13 – 23 cm ( 5 @.@ 1 – 9 @.@ 1 in ) by October . Females tend to grow larger than males . 
 The body of the bowfin is elongated and cylindrical , with the sides and back olive to brown in color , often with vertical bars , and dark reticulations , or camouflaged pattern . The dorsal fin has horizontal bars , and the caudal fin has irregular vertical bars . The underside is white or cream , and the paired fins and anal fin are bright green . During larval stage , hatchlings from about 7 – 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 28 – 0 @.@ 39 in ) total length are black and tadpole @-@ like in appearance . At approximately 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) total length they have been described as looking like miniature placoderms . They grow quickly , and typically leave the nest within 4 to 6 weeks after hatching . Young males have a black eyespot on the base of the tail ( caudal peduncle ) that is commonly encircled by an orange @-@ yellowish border while the female 's is black , if present at all . It is thought the purpose of the eyespot is to confuse predators , deflecting attacks away from the head of the fish to its tail , which affords the bowfin an opportunity to escape predation . The bowfin is so named for its long , undulating dorsal fin consisting of 145 to 250 rays , and running from the middle of the back to the base of the tail . 
 Bowfin are often referred to as " living fossils " , or " primitive fishes " because they retained some of the primitive characters common to their ancestral predecessors , including a modified ( rounded externally ) heterocercal caudal fin , a highly vascularized gas bladder lung , vestiges of a spiral valve , and a bony gular plate . The bony gular plate is located underneath the head on the exterior of the lower jaw between the two sides of the lower jaw bone . Other distinguishing characteristics include long , sharp teeth , and two protruding tube @-@ like nostrils . Unlike all of the most primitive actinopterygians , the scales of bowfin differ in that they are not ganoid scales , rather they are large , single @-@ layered cycloid scales closer in similarity to more derived teleosts . 
 = = = Fishes similar in appearance = = = 
 Northern snakeheads ( Channa argus ) are commonly mistaken for bowfin because of similarities in appearance , most noticeably their elongated , cylindrical shape , and long dorsal fin that runs along their backs . Northern snakeheads are piscivorous fishes native to the rivers and estuaries of China , Russia , and Korea . However , unlike bowfin which are native to North America , the northern <unk> is considered an invasive species and environmentally harmful . Some contrasting differences in bowfin include a black eyespot on their caudal peduncle , a tan and olive coloration , a shorter anal fin , a more rounded head , and an upper jaw that is longer than its lower jaw . 
 The burbot , a predatory fish native to streams and lakes of North America and Eurasia , is also commonly mistaken for bowfin . <unk> can be distinguished by their flat head and chin barbel , long anal fin , and pelvic fins situated beneath the pectoral fins . 
 = = Physiology = = 
 Bowfin , like other <unk> such as bichirs ( <unk> ) , gars ( Lepisosteidae ) , and the <unk> ( <unk> ) , are capable of bimodal respiration . They can extract oxygen from the water when breathing through their gills , and can also break the water 's surface to breathe or gulp air through a small pneumatic duct connected from their foregut to the gas bladder . When performing low @-@ level physical activity , bowfin obtain more than half of their oxygen from breathing air . Bowfin have two distinct air @-@ breathing mechanisms used to ventilate the gas bladder . Type I air breaths are consistent with the action of exhale @-@ inhale stimulated by aerial or aquatic hypoxia to regulate O2 gas exchange ; type II air breaths are by inhalation alone which is believed to regulate gas bladder volume for buoyancy control . <unk> respiration helps bowfin survive and maintain their metabolic rate in hypoxic conditions . The rate of air breathing is higher in darkness , when the fish is more active . 
 Bowfin blood can adapt to warm , acidic waters . The fish becomes inactive in waters below 10 ° C ( 50 ° F ) ; at this temperature they breathe almost no air ; however , with increasing temperature their air breathing increases . Their preferred temperature range is between 12 – 26 ° C ( 54 – 79 ° F ) , with 18 ° C ( 64 ° F ) the temperature of maximum activity . Air breathing is at a maximum in the range 18 @.@ 4 – 29 @.@ 6 ° C ( 65 @.@ 1 – 85 @.@ 3 ° F ) . 
 <unk> Wilfred T. Neill , reported in 1950 that he unearthed a bowfin aestivating in a chamber 4 inches ( 10 cm ) below the ground surface , 8 inches ( 20 cm ) in diameter , .25 miles ( 0 @.@ 4 km ) from a river . It was further noted that flood levels had previously reached the area , and receded . It is not unusual for riverine species like bowfin to move into backwaters with flood currents , and become trapped when water levels recede . While aestivation is anecdotally documented by multiple researchers , laboratory experiments have suggested instead that bowfin are physiologically incapable of surviving more than three to five days of air exposure . However , no field manipulation has been performed . Regardless of the lack of evidence confirming the bowfin 's ability to aestivate , it has been noted that bowfin can survive prolonged conditions of exposure to air because they have the ability to breathe air . Their gill filaments and lamellae are rigid in structure which helps prevent the lamellae from collapsing and aids gas exchange even during air exposure . 
 = = Evolution and phylogeny = = 
 Competing hypotheses and debates continue over the evolution of Amia and relatives , including their relationship among basal extant teleosts , and organization of clades . Bowfin are the last remaining member of <unk> , a group that includes many extinct species in several families . <unk> were generally accepted as the sister group to Teleostei but not without question . While a <unk> pattern of neopterygian clades was produced in morphology @-@ based analyses of extant actinopterygians , a different result was produced with fossil taxa which showed a monophyletic Holostei . <unk> Holostei were also recovered by at least two nuclear gene analyses , in an independent study of fossil and extant fishes , and in an analysis of <unk> genomic elements . 
 The extant ray @-@ finned fishes of the subclass Actinopterygii include 42 orders , 431 families and over 23 @,@ 000 species . They are currently classified into two <unk> , Chondrostei ( <unk> ) and Neopterygii ( teleost fishes ) . <unk> , paddlefish , bichirs and reed fish comprise the thirty @-@ eight species of <unk> , and are considered relict species . Included in the over 23 @,@ 000 species of <unk> are eight relict species comprising gars and the bowfin . 
 = = = Infraclass Neopterygii = = = 
 <unk> are the second major occurrence in the evolution of ray @-@ finned fishes and today include the majority of modern bony fish . They are distinguished from their earlier ancestors by major changes to the jaws , shape of the skull , and tail . They are divided into three divisions : 
 Division 1 . Order <unk> – the relict gars which include extant species of <unk> that first appeared in the Cretaceous . 
 Division 2 . Order Amiiformes – the relict bowfin , ( <unk> ) , the only extant species in the order Amiiformes which date back to the Triassic period . 
 Division 3 . Division Teleostei – the stem group of Teleostei from which modern fish arose , including most of the bony fish we are familiar with today . 
 = = = Genome evolution = = = 
 The bowfin genome contains an intact ParaHox gene cluster , similar to the <unk> and to most other vertebrates . This is in contrast , however , with teleost fishes , which have a fragmented ParaHox cluster , probably because of a whole genome duplication event in their lineage . The presence of an intact ParaHox gene cluster suggests that bowfin ancestors separated from other fishes before the last common ancestor of all teleosts appeared . Bowfin are thus possibly a better model to study vertebrate genome organization than common teleost model organisms such as zebrafish . 
 = = Feeding behavior = = 
 Bowfin are stalking , ambush predators that customarily move into the shallows at night to prey on fish , and aquatic invertebrates such as crawfish , mollusks , and aquatic insects . Young bowfin feed mostly on small crustaceans , while adults are mostly piscivorous , but also known to be opportunistic . Bowfin are remarkably agile , can move quickly through the water , and they have a voracious appetite . Their undulating dorsal fin propels them silently through the water while stalking their prey . The attack is straight forward and swift with a movement that lasts approximately 0 @.@ 075 seconds . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Fossil deposits indicate <unk> included freshwater and marine species that were once widely distributed in North America , South America , Eurasia and Africa . Today , bowfin ( Amia <unk> ) are the only remaining species in the order Amiiformes ; they are demersal freshwater piscivores , and their range is restricted to freshwater environments in North America , including much of the eastern United States and adjacent southern Canada from the St. Lawrence River and Lake Champlain drainage of southern Ontario and Quebec westward around the Great Lakes in southern Ontario into Minnesota . Historically , their distribution in North America included the drainage basins of the Mississippi River from Quebec to northern Minnesota , the St. Lawrence @-@ Great Lakes , including Georgian Bay , Lake Nipissing and Simcoe , Ontario , south to the Gulf of Mexico ; Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain from the Susquehanna River drainage in southeastern Pennsylvania to the Colorado River in Texas . 
 = = = Stocking = = = 
 Research from the late 1800s to the 1980s suggests a trend of intentional stockings of non @-@ indigenous fishes into ponds , lakes and rivers in the United States . At that time , little was known about environmental impacts , or long @-@ term effects of new species establishment and spread as a result of " fish rescue and transfer " efforts , or the importance of <unk> fishes to the ecological balance of aquatic ecosystems . Introductions of bowfin to areas they were considered a non @-@ indigenous species included various lakes , rivers and drainages in Connecticut , Illinois , Iowa , Kansas , Kentucky Maryland , Massachusetts , Missouri , New Jersey , New York , North Carolina , Pennsylvania , Virginia , West Virginia , and Wisconsin . Many of the introductions were intentional stockings by various resource management ; however , there is no way to positively determine distribution resulting from flood transfers , or other inadvertent migrations . Bowfin are typically piscivorous , but as an introduced species are capable of being voracious predators that pose a threat to native fishes and their prey . 
 = = = Preferred habitat = = = 
 Bowfin prefer vegetated sloughs , lowland rivers and lakes , swamps , backwater areas , and are occasionally found in brackish water . They are well camouflaged , and not easy to spot in slow water with abundant vegetation . They often seek shelter under roots , and submerged logs . Oxygen @-@ poor environments can be tolerated because of their ability to breathe air . 
 = = Life cycle = = 
 Bowfin spawn in the spring or early summer , typically between April and June , more commonly at night in abundantly vegetated , clear shallow water in weed beds over sand bars , and also under stumps , logs , and bushes . Optimum temperatures for nesting and spawning range between 16 – 19 ° C ( 61 – 66 ° F ) . The males construct circular nests in fibrous root mats , clearing away leaves and stems . Depending on the density of surrounding vegetation there may be a tunnel @-@ like entrance at one side . The diameter of the nests commonly range between 39 – 91 cm ( 15 – 36 in ) , at a water depth of 61 – 92 cm ( 24 – 36 in ) . 
 During spawning season , the fins and underside of male bowfin often change in color to a bright lime green . The courtship / spawning sequence lasts one to three hours , and can repeat up to five times . Courtship begins when a female approaches the nest . The ritual consists of intermittent nose bites , nudges , and chasing behavior by the male until the female becomes receptive , at which time the pair lie side by side in the nest . She deposits her eggs while he shakes his fins in a <unk> movement , and releases his milt for fertilization to occur . A male often has eggs from more than one female in his nest , and a single female often spawns in several nests . 
 Females vacate the nest after spawning , leaving the male behind to protect the eggs during the eight to ten days of incubation . A nest may contain 2 @,@ 000 to 5 @,@ 000 eggs , possibly more . Fecundity is usually related to size of the fish , so it isn 't unusual for the roe of a large gravid female to contain over 55 @,@ 000 eggs . Bowfin eggs are adhesive , and will attach to aquatic vegetation , roots , gravel , and sand . After hatching , larval bowfin do not swim actively in search of food . During the seven to nine days required for yolk @-@ sac absorption , they attach to vegetation by means of an adhesive organ on their snout , and remain protected by the parent male bowfin . Bowfin aggressively protect their spawn from the first day of incubation to a month or so after the eggs have hatched . When the fry are able to swim and forage on their own , they will form a school and leave the nest accompanied by the parent male bowfin who slowly circles them to prevent separation . 
 Bowfin reach sexually maturity at two to three years of age . They can live ten to twelve years in the wild , and 30 years in captivity . Females are longer @-@ lived than males . 
 = = Diseases = = 
 A common parasite of bowfin is the anchor worm ( Lernaea ) . These small crustaceans infest the skin and bases of fins , with consequences ranging from slowed growth to death . The mollusk <unk> gigantea lays eggs in the bowfin gills , that are then externally fertilized by sperm passing in the water flow . The small glochidia larvae then hatch and develop in the gill tubes . 
 Bowfin with liver cancer and with fatal leukemia have been reported . 
 = = Utilization = = 
 As a sport fish , bowfin are not considered desirable to many anglers . They were once considered a nuisance fish by anglers and early biologists who believed the bowfin 's predatory nature was harmful to sport fish populations . As a result , efforts were taken to reduce their numbers . Research has since proven otherwise , and that knowledge together with a better understanding of maintaining overall balance of ecosystems , regulations were introduced to help protect and maintain viable populations of bowfin . Bowfin are strong fighters , a prized trait in game fish . However , they do have a jaw full of sharp teeth which requires careful handling . The current tackle record is 21 @.@ 5 lb ( 9 @.@ 8 kg ) 
 Bowfin were once considered to have little commercial value because of its poor tasting meat which has been referred to as " soft , bland @-@ tasting and of poor texture " . However , it is considered quite palatable if cleaned properly and smoked , or prepared fried , blackened , used in <unk> , or in <unk> or <unk> . Over the years , global efforts have imposed strict regulations on the international trade of caviar , particularly on the harvest of sturgeons from the Caspian Sea where the highly prized caviar from the beluga sturgeon originates . The bans imposed on Caspian sturgeons have created lucrative markets for affordable substitutes in the United States including paddlefish , bowfin , and various species of sturgeon . In Louisiana , bowfin are harvested in the wild , and cultured commercially in hatcheries for their meat and roe . The roe is processed into caviar , and sold as " Cajun caviar " , or marketed under the trade name " <unk> Royale " . 
 = = Accumulation of toxic substances = = 
 In some areas of the United States where aquatic environments have tested positive for elevated levels of toxins , such as mercury , arsenic , chromium , and copper , there are posted signs with warnings about the consumption of fish caught in those areas . Concentration of mercury <unk> as it passes up the food chain from organisms on lower trophic levels to apex predators . It bioaccumulates in the tissues of larger , long @-@ lived predatory fishes . When compared to smaller , short @-@ lived fishes , bowfin tend to concentrate mercury at higher levels thereby making them less safe for human consumption . 
 = Craig Taborn = 
 Craig Marvin Taborn ( / <unk> / ; born February 20 , 1970 ) is an American pianist , organist , keyboardist and composer . He works solo and in bands , mostly playing various forms of jazz . He started playing piano and Moog synthesizer as an adolescent and was influenced at an early stage by a wide range of music , including by the freedom expressed in recordings of free jazz and contemporary classical music . 
 While at university , Taborn toured and recorded with jazz saxophonist James Carter . Taborn went on to play with numerous other musicians in electronic and acoustic settings , while also building a reputation as a solo pianist . He has a range of styles , and often adapts his playing to the nature of the instrument and the sounds that he can make it produce . His improvising , particularly for solo piano , often adopts a modular approach , in which he begins with small units of melody and rhythm and then develops them into larger forms and structures . 
 In 2011 , Down Beat magazine chose Taborn as winner of the electric keyboard category , as well as rising star in both the piano and organ categories . By May 2016 , Taborn had released six albums under his own name and appeared on more than eighty as a sideman . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Taborn was born in Minneapolis , Minnesota , to John , a psychologist , and Marjorie , a social worker . He grew up in Golden Valley , Minnesota , where he attended Breck School . His parents gave him a Moog synthesizer as a present when he was 12 , which was also around the time when he started playing piano . He borrowed records from a public library and listened to public radio , discovering music from the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and Sun Ra , among others . As a youth he also listened to heavy metal and contemporary classical music , and identified commonalities among these disparate forms of music . 
 At high school , Taborn studied music theory and composition with PhD @-@ qualified teachers for two years . In his own words , he is " not a classically trained pianist at all " ; he practiced with others , initially playing rock , progressive rock , and jazz fusion , before becoming more interested in jazz . He borrowed from the library Segments II ( Orchestra Of Two Continents ) by pianist Cecil Taylor 's band while at high school , but found separating the various elements of the music too difficult . After attending a Last Exit concert ( a loud free jazz band of Peter <unk> , Bill Laswell , Ronald Shannon Jackson and Sonny Sharrock ) , he went home and listened to the Taylor album again : " It was more manageable in terms of being able to hear detail and listen to content . That was a big moment in terms of being able to relax and process information in more abstract environments . " 
 = = Later life and career = = 
 = = = 1988 – 1999 = = = 
 Taborn studied at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor from 1988 . He auditioned for the jazz program in the university 's School of Music , but joined the College of Literature , Science and the Arts . Taborn met drummer Gerald Cleaver soon after arriving at university , and they established an electronic group , the Tracey Science Quartet . Taborn also played with Marcus Belgrave and Wendell Harrison . While still a university student , he became known for his membership of saxophonist James Carter 's band , where he contributed to a series of albums , beginning with JC on the Set , which was recorded in 1993 . 
 Taborn 's first recording as leader came in 1994 , and was released by <unk> . Craig Taborn Trio , with bassist <unk> Shahid and drummer Tani <unk> , featured Taborn playing in a range of styles on piano and included several of his own compositions . At this stage in his career , his comments on his tastes in composition and performance were : " Even though I like avant garde jazz and classical music , I like to swing . I like to work with harmony and melody in my own music , and I like acoustical instruments . But I can be quite dictatorial about the composed section , and lay down in great detail what everyone is supposed to do and how they should do it . " 
 Frequent performances and tours with Carter and others meant that Taborn 's studies were delayed : he graduated from university with a BA in general studies ( rather than the intended English literature ) in April 1995 , after which he moved to New York . He continued playing with Carter into 1998 . In the late 1990s , Taborn also recorded with saxophonist Roscoe Mitchell ( Taborn 's first appearance on the ECM label ) , and for techno producer Carl Craig 's album Programmed as part of <unk> Orchestra . 
 = = = 2000 – 2009 = = = 
 In 2001 , Taborn made his second recording as leader : Light Made Lighter , for Thirsty Ear , with Chris <unk> on bass and Cleaver on drums . " On the strength of this recording " , wrote the Los Angeles Times reviewer , " Taborn emerges as one of the most exciting pianists to lead a band since the ascent of Matthew Shipp " . Another reviewer commented that " Taborn seems to revel in the cracks the way [ Thelonious ] Monk did , hitting the awkward @-@ sounding notes between the notes to punctuate his lines " . 
 In the 2000s , " Taborn became one of the most in @-@ demand musicians in New York " , in the words of one biographer . He played and recorded with a large , diverse range of musicians , in both free jazz and more mainstream bands , and playing various keyboard and electronic instruments . One critic observed that a lot of his collaborations in the early and mid @-@ 2000s did not feature a bassist , and suggested that Taborn 's " dexterity and inventiveness [ ... ] stand in for both a keyboard and a bass player . " In 2001 , he had his first solo concert in New York , and made his first recordings under the leadership of saxophonist Tim Berne , and with a trio led by percussionist Susie Ibarra . On these , he employed electronics as well as piano . Taborn went on to record , during the period 2002 – 04 , as a sideman under the leadership of Steve Coleman , Dave Douglas , Marty Ehrlich , Drew Gress , Evan Parker , Wadada Leo Smith , and others . In 2003 , Taborn toured Europe with Ibarra 's band , and played with saxophonist Lotte Anker for the first time . 
 Taborn 's third release as a leader was Junk Magic in 2004 , again for Thirsty Ear , with tenor saxophonist Aaron Stewart , violist Mat Maneri and drummer Dave King . The album 's title was also the name of the band , which was formed to be Taborn 's electronic group , allowing him to explore the interactions of composition , improvisation and electronics . Texture and pulse were important contributors to the overall sound . 
 Taborn played with Chris Potter from around 2005 , and toured Europe with the saxophonist 's Underground band early in 2007 . The pianist played the Monterey Jazz Festival in 2007 . In late 2007 and early 2008 , Taborn toured internationally with Underground , guitarist David Torn 's <unk> , as well as being part of shorter tours and making occasional appearances with Cleaver , Gress , Ibarra , Mitchell , and William Parker . In April 2008 he toured Europe with Berne 's Science Friction , was back in Europe for the first three weeks of the following month , this time as part of David Binney 's quartet , and returned there in November with Potter . Taborn remarked in 2008 that he was attempting to phase out his use of a laptop in performance , to allow him to concentrate more on improvising , and that he had delayed further performances as a leader , owing to finances . In the same year , he commented on the number of regular , working bands he was a member of : " You could say 15 to 20 . But if you 're talking about the ones that are regularly working right now , I 'd have to say seven or eight . " 
 After joining Michael <unk> 's quartet in 2008 , Taborn recorded under the double bassist 's leadership for the first time the following year . Also in 2009 , Taborn played with trumpeter Tomasz <unk> in New York , and returned to Europe for concerts with Torn , violinist Dominique <unk> , and with his own trio . 
 = = = 2010 – present = = = 
 In the early 2010s , Taborn continued playing and recording with others , but also had more solo concerts than earlier in his career . He had a solo tour of Europe in 2010 , which may have led to an agreement with ECM to record his first solo piano album , Avenging Angel , which was released in 2011 . In critic Nate Chinen 's view , this album concentrated on " pure sound " , being " full of moments where a note hangs sharply in the air , and you hear the gathering overtones , the vibrations of the strings " . The album helped Taborn get more attention as a leader . 
 In 2010 , Taborn also toured Europe with Anker 's trio , Potter 's Underground , and played piano duets with Vijay Iyer . In the following year , Taborn again performed with <unk> , as part of drummer Paul Motian 's quartet , and had another solo tour of Europe . Taborn toured internationally with his own trio , Anker 's trio , and with Dave Holland 's quartet Prism in 2012 , and remained part of Holland 's band into 2014 . 
 A further ECM album , Chants , led by Taborn and with bassist Thomas Morgan and drummer Gerald Cleaver , was released in 2013 . This was the trio 's first release after eight years together . At this point , Taborn 's comments on composition and group performance were : " I knew that if I created a context and then deferred , fully , to Gerald 's and Thomas 's sensibilities it would inherently be stimulating and would also challenge the context . [ ... ] I 'd much rather engage with the group , always , than have the format be ' piano adventures with supporting cast ' . " This band began a tour of Europe in 2014 , but Cleaver was replaced by J.T. Bates part of the way through it , owing to illness . Earlier the same year , Taborn played in a small group led by guitarist Bill Frisell . Taborn played as part of the <unk> Smith Trio late in 2014 and toured with the percussionist and Mat Maneri early in 2016 . His sixth album as leader , <unk> : Book of Angels Volume 27 , was released in 2016 . The trio recording , with Christian McBride on bass and <unk> <unk> on drums , employed compositions by John Zorn . 
 According to Jazz Police , Taborn is " basically shy " and prefers to " let his music do the talking " , which is why he " doesn 't have , or want , his own website " . 
 = = Playing style = = 
 Taborn 's range of playing styles was summarized by Mike Hobart in The Financial Times : Taborn " draws obliquely on the jazz tradition [ ... ] he is as at home in free improvisation as he is in composition " . In an interview for Down Beat in 2011 , Taborn described his improvising style , particularly for solo piano . When playing , he often adopts a modular approach , using small units of melody and rhythm and then developing them . This can begin from as little as three notes , with structure being built around referring back to elements of the units . He starts simply , using basic elements such as major and minor thirds , varies them in turn , and then continues to expand to create larger structures . 
 Taborn has commented on the similarities and differences in his playing on piano and electronic instruments . Comparing his accompaniments on piano and Fender Rhodes , he said that : 
 I play some of the same chords on the piano , but there are definitely things I would do on the piano because it 's a more transparent instrument that I wouldn 't do on the Rhodes . [ ... ] The Rhodes is so strong that when you play something on it , it really can dictate , because it 's louder and the timbre is much more opaque . So you leave more holes . On the piano , I would maybe play more sustain chords . 
 Taborn prefers earlier models of Fender Rhodes , for their raunchier sound . He also attempts to retain control over the sound that is presented to an audience when playing electronic instruments : he links his instruments to his own amplifier , and then has the venue take its feed from that amplifier . 
 Guitarist Torn commented that Taborn is " the rare musician who takes the approach , ' What can I do with this instrument ? ' rather than playing through its book of techniques . [ ... He ] is able to eschew the technological aspect in order to get out the sounds that he feels are suitable for the music . " 
 = = Compositions = = 
 Taborn incorporates requirements to improvise within his compositions . Commenting on his writing for trio and quartet , Taborn stated that " I like multiple kinds of rhythmic things . On their own , they 're not so complicated , but when you fit them together , it sounds a little mysterious . A lot of that writing extends from my trio writing , where I 'm writing things that are playable in real time . There 's a certain orchestration you can get out of a four @-@ piece . How far can we suggest a larger ensemble ? [ I want ] to create the illusion of a larger ensemble " . 
 = = Awards = = 
 In 2009 and 2010 , Down Beat critics selected Taborn as the electric keyboard rising star winner . In 2011 , he was chosen as winner of the electric keyboard category , as well as rising star in both the piano and organ categories . In 2012 , he was given the North Sea Jazz Festival 's Paul <unk> Award , which is presented " to an artist deserving wider recognition for extraordinary musicianship " . JazzTimes ranked Taborn in their 2013 critics ' poll as best piano player . In 2014 , the Jazz Journalists Association awarded him the Pianist of the Year award . 
 In 2014 , Taborn was given a Doris Duke Artist Award , worth up to $ 275 @,@ 000 and given to " exemplary individual artists in contemporary dance , jazz , theatre and related interdisciplinary work who have proven their artistic vitality and commitment to their field . "

 = Géza I of Hungary = 
 Géza I ( Hungarian pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ; Hungarian : I. Géza ; c . 1040 – 25 April 1077 ) was King of Hungary from 1074 until his death . He was the eldest son of King Béla I. His baptismal name was Magnus . When his father died in 1063 , Géza 's cousin Solomon acquired the crown with German assistance , forcing Géza to leave Hungary . Géza returned with Polish reinforcements and signed a treaty with Solomon in early 1064 . In the treaty , Géza and his brother , Ladislaus acknowledged the rule of Solomon , who granted them their father 's former duchy , which encompassed one @-@ third of the Kingdom of Hungary . 
 Géza closely cooperated with Solomon , but their relationship became tense from 1071 . The king invaded the duchy in February 1074 and defeated Géza in a battle . However , Géza was victorious at the decisive battle of Mogyoród on 14 March 1074 . He soon acquired the throne , although Solomon maintained his rule in the regions of Moson and Pressburg ( present @-@ day Bratislava , Slovakia ) for years . Géza initiated peace negotiations with his dethroned cousin in the last months of his life . Géza 's sons were minors when he died and he was succeeded by his brother Ladislaus . 
 = = Early years ( before 1064 ) = = 
 Géza was the eldest son of the future King Béla I of Hungary and his wife Richeza or Adelhaid , a daughter of King Mieszko II of Poland . The Illuminated Chronicle narrates that Géza and his brother Ladislaus were born in Poland , where their father who had been banished from Hungary settled in the 1030s . Géza was born in about 1040 . According to the historians Gyula Kristó and Ferenc Makk , he was named after his grandfather 's uncle Géza , Grand Prince of the Hungarians . His baptismal name was Magnus . 
 In about 1048 , Géza 's father returned to Hungary and received one third of the kingdom with the title of duke from his brother , King Andrew I. Géza seems to have arrived in Hungary with his father . The king , who had not fathered a legitimate son , declared Béla as his heir . According to the traditional principle of seniority , Béla preserved his claim to succeed his brother even after Andrew 's wife Anastasia of Kiev gave birth to Solomon in 1053 . However , the king had his son crowned in 1057 or 1058 . The Illuminated Chronicle narrates that the child Solomon " was anointed king with the consent of Duke Bela and his sons <unk> and Ladislaus " , which is the first reference to a public act by Géza . However , according to the contemporaneous text Annales <unk> , Géza was absent from the meeting where Judith — the sister of the German monarch Henry IV — was engaged to the child Solomon in 1058 . 
 Géza accompanied his father , who left for Poland to seek assistance against King Andrew . They returned with Polish reinforcements in 1060 . Géza was one of his father 's most influential advisors . Lampert of <unk> wrote that Géza persuaded his father to set free Count William of Weimar , one of the commanders of the German troops fighting on Andrew 's side , who had been captured in a battle . 
 The king died during the civil war ; his partisans took Solomon to the Holy Roman Empire and Géza 's father Béla was crowned king on 6 December 1060 . Although Géza remained his father 's principal advisor , King Béla did not grant his former duchy to his son . According to the Annales <unk> , Béla even offered Géza as hostage to the Germans when he was informed that the German court decided , in August 1063 , to invade Hungary to restore Solomon . However , the Germans refused Béla 's offer and he died on 11 September 1063 , some days after the imperial troops entered Hungary . 
 Following his father 's death , Géza offered to accept Solomon 's rule if he received his father 's former duchy . This offer was refused , which forced him and his two brothers — Ladislaus and Lampert — to leave Hungary for Poland . King Bolesław II of Poland provided them with reinforcements and they returned after the German troops <unk> from Hungary . The brothers wanted to avoid a new civil war and made an agreement with King Solomon . According to the treaty , which was signed in Győr on 20 January 1064 , Géza and his brothers accepted Solomon 's rule and the king granted them their father 's duchy . The king and his cousins celebrated Easter together in the cathedral of Pécs , where Duke Géza ceremoniously put a crown on Solomon 's head . 
 Being a newcomer and not yet established in his kingdom , King [ Solomon ] was afraid that [ Géza ] would perhaps attack him with a Polish army , and he therefore retired for a time with his forces and took up a safe station in the strongly fortified castle of [ Moson ] . The bishops and other religious men strove most earnestly to bring about a peaceful settlement between them . Especially bishop Desiderius softened Duke [ Géza ] ' s spirit with his gentle admonitions and sweet pleadings that he should peaceably restore the kingdom to [ Solomon ] , even though he was the younger , and should himself assume the dukedom which his father had held before him . [ Géza ] listened to his words of wise persuasion and laid aside his ill feeling . At [ Győr ] , on the feast day of SS Fabian and Sebastian the martyrs , King [ Solomon ] and Duke [ Géza ] made peace with each other before the Hungarian people . 
 = = Duke in Hungary ( 1064 – 1074 ) = = 
 According to Ján Steinhübel and other Slovak historians , Géza only retained the administration of the region of Nyitra ( present @-@ day Nitra , Slovakia ) and gave the eastern territories of their father 's duchy , which were centered around Bihar ( present @-@ day Biharia , Romania ) , to his brother , Ladislaus . The Hungarian historian , Gyula Kristó likewise says that this division of Béla 's one @-@ time duchy is " probable " . The historians Gyula Kristó and Ferenc Makk write that Géza seems to have married a German countess , named Sophia around this time . Géza had the right to coinage in his duchy . The silver half @-@ denars minted for him bore the inscriptions DUX <unk> ( " Duke Magnus " ) and <unk> ( " Kingdom of Hungary " ) . 
 Géza closely cooperated with the king between 1064 and 1071 . For instance , they jointly routed an invading army which had plundered the eastern territories of the kingdom at Kerlés ( present @-@ day <unk> , Romania ) in 1068 . The identification of the invaders is uncertain : the Annales Posonienses writes of Pechenegs , the Illuminated Chronicle and other 14th- and 15th @-@ century Hungarian chronicles refer to Cumans , and a Russian chronicle identifies them as Cumans and Vlachs . Modern historians have concluded that they were Pechenegs . 
 Géza 's and Solomon 's relationship only began to worsen during the siege of the Byzantine fortress of Belgrade in 1071 . Its commander preferred to surrender to Géza instead of the king and the Byzantine envoys who arrived in the Hungarian camp after the fall of Belgrade only negotiated with Géza . The division of the booty also gave rise to a new conflict between Solomon and Géza . Although Géza accompanied the king on a new campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 1072 , but his brother , Ladislaus stayed behind with half of the troops of their duchy . 
 The conflict between the king and his cousins was sharpened by Solomon 's main advisor , Count Vid who wanted to acquire the dukes ' domains for himself . However , Solomon and Géza , who were convinced that they needed foreign reinforcements before attacking the other party , concluded a truce which was to last from 11 November 1073 to 24 April 1075 . Géza sent his brothers to Poland and Rus ' to seek assistance against Solomon . At a meeting in the Szekszárd Abbey , Count Vid persuaded the king to break the truce in order to unexpectedly attack Géza who was " hunting in <unk> Forest " to the east of the river Tisza . Although the abbot of the monastery , which had been established by Géza 's father , warned the duke of the king 's plans , the royal army crossed the river and routed Géza 's troops in the battle of Kemej on 26 February 1074 . 
 From the battlefield , Géza and his retinue hastened towards Vác where he came upon his brother , Ladislaus and their brother @-@ in @-@ law , Duke Otto I of Olomouc . The latter , accompanied by Czech reinforcements , arrived in Hungary in order to assist Géza against Solomon . In the ensuing battle , fought at Mogyoród on 14 March 1074 , Géza " with the troops from <unk> was stationed in the centre " , according to the Illuminated Chronicle . During the battle , Géza and Ladislaus changed their standards in order to <unk> Solomon who was planning to attack Géza . Géza and his allies won a decisive victory and forced the king to flee from the battlefield and to withdraw to Moson at the western frontier of Hungary . Géza " made " <unk> , <unk> , Székesfehérvár and " other castles secure with garrisons of the bravest soldiers " , thus taking possession of almost the entire kingdom . 
 = = His reign ( 1074 – 1077 ) = = 
 According to the Illuminated Chronicle , Géza accepted the throne " at the insistence of the Hungarians " after Solomon had taken refuge in Moson . However , he was not crowned because the royal jewels were still in the dethroned king 's possession . The German monarch Henry IV , who was Solomon 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , launched an expedition against Hungary in mid @-@ 1074 . The Germans marched as far as Vác , but Géza applied scorched earth tactics and bribed German commanders , who persuaded the German monarch to retreat from Hungary . 
 [ Géza ] , hearing that the Emperor had come to <unk> , with prudent policy gave instructions to approach and win over the patriarch of Aquilegia , to whose counsels the Emperor most readily listened , and also all the [ German ] dukes , promising them much money if they would make the Emperor turn back . The patriarch , therefore , and the dukes , seduced by the gifts and possessed with love of gold , invented various false stories to induce the Emperor to turn back . The patriarch pretended that he had a dream whose interpretation most plainly was that the Emperor 's army would be wholly destroyed by the divine vengeance unless he returned with the utmost speed . The dukes pretended likewise to be <unk> by divine warnings ... 
 In early 1074 , Géza had approached Pope Gregory VII to obtain international recognition of his rule . However , the pope wanted to take advantage of the conflict between Solomon and Géza and attempted to persuade both of them to acknowledge the suzerainty of the Holy See . Géza did not obey the pope and asked the Byzantine Emperor Michael VII Doukas for a crown . The emperor sent Géza a gold and enamel diadem , which bore the legend " Géza , the faithful king of Hungary " on one of its plaques . This " splendid work of art " became the lower part of the Holy Crown of Hungary by the end of the 12th century . Géza was crowned king with this diadem in early 1075 . In this year he styled himself as " anointed king of the Hungarians by the grace of God " in the charter of the foundation of the Benedictine Abbey of <unk> ( present @-@ day <unk> <unk> , Slovakia ) . 
 Géza married a niece of Nikephoros Botaneiates , a close advisor of Emperor Michael VII . However , Solomon still controlled Moson and Pressburg ; the royal troops — which were under the command of Géza 's brother , Ladislaus — could not take Pressburg in 1076 . According to the Illuminated Chronicle , Géza considered renouncing the crown in favor of Solomon from the end of the year . Géza died on 15 April 1077 and was buried in the cathedral of Vác , which he had erected in the honor of the Holy Virgin . His brother , Ladislaus succeeded him . A grave discovered in the center of the medieval cathedral in August 2015 was identified as Géza 's burial site by Zoltán <unk> , the leader of the excavations . 
 [ King Géza ] celebrated Christmas at [ Szekszárd ] . ... When the Mass had been celebrated and all observances had been duly performed , the King instructed that all should leave except the bishop and the abbots . Then the King prostrated himself with tears before the Archbishop and the other ecclesiastical personages and prelates . He said that he had sinned because he had possessed himself of the kingdom of a lawfully crowned king ; and he promised that he would restore the kingdom to [ Solomon ] , and that these would be the conditions of firm peace between them : He would by lawful right hold the crown with that third part of the kingdom belonging with the duchy ; the crowned [ Solomon ] would hold the two parts of the kingdom which he had held before . ... Then King [ Géza ] sent messengers to King [ Solomon ] with letters setting forth the terms of peace . Messengers passed to and fro , but feelings on this side and that were at variance , and so the reconciliation found no consummation . Meanwhile King [ Géza ] fell gravely ill , and on April 25 , adorned with virtues , he went the way of all flesh . He was most devoted to God in the Catholic faith , and he was a most Christian Prince . 
 = = Family = = 
 Géza married twice . The family of his first wife Sophia , whom he married in the late 1060s , is unknown . After his coronation in 1075 , he married his second wife , who was the niece of the future Byzantine Emperor Nikephoros III . 
 It is uncertain which wife bore Géza 's children , but the historians Gyula Kristó and Márta Font say that Sophia was their mother . Kristó adds that Géza fathered at least six children . Although only two of them — Coloman and Álmos — are known by name , the Illuminated Chronicle states that Coloman had brothers who " died before him " . Both Coloman and Álmos were apparently born around 1070 . 
 The following family tree presents Géza 's ancestors and some of his relatives who are mentioned in the article . 
 * Whether Géza 's first or second wife was his children 's mother is uncertain . * * Géza had at least two further children , but their names are unknown . 
 = Low @-@ pressure area = 
 A low @-@ pressure area , low or depression , is a region where the atmospheric pressure is lower than that of surrounding locations . Low @-@ pressure systems form under areas of wind divergence that occur in the upper levels of the troposphere . The formation process of a low @-@ pressure area is known as cyclogenesis . Within the field of meteorology , atmospheric divergence aloft occurs in two areas . The first area is on the east side of upper troughs , which form half of a Rossby wave within the Westerlies ( a trough with large wavelength that extends through the troposphere ) . A second area of wind divergence aloft occurs ahead of embedded shortwave troughs , which are of smaller wavelength . Diverging winds aloft ahead of these troughs cause atmospheric lift within the troposphere below , which lowers surface pressures as upward motion partially counteracts the force of gravity . 
 Thermal lows form due to localized heating caused by greater sunshine over deserts and other land masses . Since localized areas of warm air are less dense than their surroundings , this warmer air rises , which lowers atmospheric pressure near that portion of the Earth 's surface . Large @-@ scale thermal lows over continents help drive monsoon circulations . Low @-@ pressure areas can also form due to organized thunderstorm activity over warm water . When this occurs over the tropics in concert with the Intertropical Convergence Zone , it is known as a monsoon trough . Monsoon troughs reach their northerly extent in August and their southerly extent in February . When a convective low acquires a well @-@ hot circulation in the tropics it is termed a tropical cyclone . Tropical cyclones can form during any month of the year globally , but can occur in either the northern or southern hemisphere during November . 
 Atmospheric lift will also generally produce cloud cover through adiabatic cooling once the air becomes saturated as it rises , although the low @-@ pressure area typically brings cloudy skies , which act to minimize diurnal temperature extremes . Since clouds reflect sunlight , incoming shortwave solar radiation decreases , which causes lower temperatures during the day . At night the absorptive effect of clouds on outgoing longwave radiation , such as heat energy from the surface , allows for warmer diurnal low temperatures in all seasons . The stronger the area of low pressure , the stronger the winds experienced in its vicinity . Globally , low @-@ pressure systems are most frequently located over the Tibetan Plateau and in the lee of the Rocky mountains . In Europe ( particularly in the United Kingdom ) , recurring low @-@ pressure weather systems are typically known as " depressions " . 
 = = Formation = = 
 Cyclogenesis is the development and strengthening of cyclonic circulations , or low @-@ pressure areas , within the atmosphere . Cyclogenesis is the opposite of cyclolysis , and has an anticyclonic ( high @-@ pressure system ) equivalent which deals with the formation of high @-@ pressure areas — anticyclogenesis . Cyclogenesis is an umbrella term for several different processes , all of which result in the development of some sort of cyclone . The term cyclone is used where circular pressure systems flow in the direction of the Earth 's rotation , which normally coincides with areas of low pressure . The largest low @-@ pressure systems are cold @-@ core polar cyclones and extratropical cyclones which lie on the synoptic scale . Warm @-@ core cyclones such as tropical cyclones , mesocyclones , and polar lows lie within the smaller mesoscale . Subtropical cyclones are of intermediate size . Cyclogenesis can occur at various scales , from the microscale to the synoptic scale . Larger scale troughs , which are also called Rossby waves , are synoptic in scale . Shortwave troughs embedded within the flow around larger scale troughs are smaller in scale , or mesoscale in nature . Both Rossby waves and <unk> embedded within the flow around Rossby waves migrate equatorward of the polar cyclones located in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres . All share one important aspect , that of upward vertical motion within the troposphere . Such upward motions decrease the mass of local atmospheric columns of air , which lower surface pressure . 
 Extratropical cyclones form as waves along weather fronts due to a passing by shortwave aloft or upper level jet streak before occluding later in their life cycle as cold core cyclones . Polar lows are small @-@ scale , short @-@ lived atmospheric low @-@ pressure systems that are found over the ocean areas poleward of the main polar front in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres . They are part of the larger class of mesoscale weather systems . Polar lows can be difficult to detect using conventional weather reports and are a hazard to high @-@ latitude operations , such as shipping and gas and oil platforms . They are vigorous systems that have near @-@ surface winds of at least 17 metres per second ( 38 mph ) . 
 Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity , and are warm core with well @-@ defined circulations . Certain criteria need to be met for their formation . In most situations , water temperatures of at least 26 @.@ 5 ° C ( 79 @.@ 7 ° F ) are needed down to a depth of at least 50 m ( 160 ft ) ; waters of this temperature cause the overlying atmosphere to be unstable enough to sustain convection and thunderstorms . Another factor is rapid cooling with height , which allows the release of the heat of condensation that powers a tropical cyclone . High humidity is needed , especially in the lower @-@ to @-@ mid troposphere ; when there is a great deal of moisture in the atmosphere , conditions are more favorable for disturbances to develop . Low amounts of wind shear are needed , as high shear is disruptive to the storm 's circulation . Lastly , a formative tropical cyclone needs a pre @-@ existing system of disturbed weather , although without a circulation no cyclonic development will take place . Mesocyclones form as warm core cyclones over land , and can lead to tornado formation . Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones , but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear . 
 In deserts , lack of ground and plant moisture that would normally provide evaporative cooling can lead to intense , rapid solar heating of the lower layers of air . The hot air is less dense than surrounding cooler air . This , combined with the rising of the hot air , results in a low @-@ pressure area called a thermal low . Monsoon circulations are caused by thermal lows which form over large areas of land and their strength is driven by how land heats quicker than the surrounding nearby ocean . This creates a steady wind blowing toward the land , bringing the moist near @-@ surface air over the oceans with it . Similar rainfall is caused by the moist ocean air being lifted upwards by mountains , surface heating , convergence at the surface , divergence aloft , or from storm @-@ produced outflows at the surface . However the lifting occurs , the air cools due expansion in lower pressure , which in turn produces condensation . In winter , the land cools off quickly , but the ocean keeps the heat longer due to its higher specific heat . The hot air over the ocean rises , creating a low @-@ pressure area and a breeze from land to ocean while a large area of drying high pressure is formed over the land , increased by wintertime cooling . Monsoons are similar to sea and land breezes , a term usually referring to the localized , diurnal ( daily ) cycle of circulation near coastlines everywhere , but they are much larger in scale also stronger and seasonal . 
 = = Climatology = = 
 = = = Mid @-@ latitudes and subtropics = = = 
 Large polar cyclones help determine the steering of systems moving through the mid @-@ latitudes , south of the Arctic and north of the Antarctic . An index which is used to gauge the magnitude of this effect in the Northern Hemisphere is the Arctic oscillation . Extratropical cyclones tend to form east of climatological trough positions aloft near the east coast of continents , or west side of oceans . A study of extratropical cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere shows that between the 30th and 70th parallels , there are an average of 37 cyclones in existence during any 6 @-@ hour period . A separate study in the Northern Hemisphere suggests that approximately 234 significant extratropical cyclones form each winter . In Europe , particularly the United Kingdom , recurring extratropical low @-@ pressure weather systems are typically known as depressions . These tend to bring wet weather throughout the year . Thermal lows also occur over continental areas across the subtropics during the summer such as the Sonoran Desert , the Mexican plateau , Sahara , South America , and Southeast Asia . The lows are most commonly located over the Tibetan plateau and in the lee of the Rocky mountains . 
 = = = Monsoon trough = = = 
 Elongated areas of low pressure form at the monsoon trough or intertropical convergence zone as part of the Hadley cell circulation . Monsoon troughing in the western Pacific reaches its zenith in latitude during the late summer when the wintertime surface ridge in the opposite hemisphere is the strongest . It can reach as far as the 40th parallel in East Asia during August and 20th parallel in Australia during February . Its poleward progression is accelerated by the onset of the summer monsoon which is characterized by the development of lower air pressure over the warmest part of the various continents . The large @-@ scale thermal lows over continents help create pressure gradients which drive monsoon circulations . In the southern hemisphere , the monsoon trough associated with the Australian monsoon reaches its most southerly latitude in February , oriented along a west @-@ northwest / east @-@ southeast axis . Many of the world 's rainforests are associated with these climatological low @-@ pressure systems . 
 = = = Tropical cyclone = = = 
 Tropical cyclones generally need to form more than 555 km ( 345 mi ) or poleward of the 5th parallel north and 5th parallel south , allowing the Coriolis effect to deflect winds blowing towards the low @-@ pressure center and creating a circulation . Worldwide , tropical cyclone activity peaks in late summer , when the difference between temperatures aloft and sea surface temperatures is the greatest . However , each particular basin has its own seasonal patterns . On a worldwide scale , May is the least active month while September is the most active month . November is the only month that activity in all the tropical cyclone basins is possible . Nearly one @-@ third of the world 's tropical cyclones form within the western Pacific ocean , making it the most active tropical cyclone basin on Earth . 
 = = Associated weather = = 
 Wind is initially accelerated from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure . This is due to density ( or temperature and moisture ) differences between two air masses . Since stronger high @-@ pressure systems contain cooler or drier air , the air mass is denser and flows towards areas that are warm or moist , which are in the vicinity of low @-@ pressure areas in advance of their associated cold fronts . The stronger the pressure difference , or pressure gradient , between a high @-@ pressure system and a low @-@ pressure system , the stronger the wind . Thus , stronger areas of low pressure are associated with stronger winds . 
 The Coriolis force caused by the Earth 's rotation is what gives winds within low @-@ pressure systems their counter @-@ clockwise ( anticlockwise ) circulation in the northern hemisphere ( as the wind moves inward and is deflected right from the center of high pressure ) and clockwise circulation in the southern hemisphere ( as the wind moves inward and is deflected left from the center of high pressure ) . Friction with land slows down the wind flowing into low @-@ pressure systems and causes wind to flow more inward , or flowing more <unk> , toward their centers . A low @-@ pressure area is commonly associated with inclement weather , while a high @-@ pressure area is associated with light winds and fair skies .

 " The Secret War of Lisa Simpson " is the twenty @-@ fifth and final episode of The Simpsons ' eighth season . It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 18 , 1997 . Bart gets sent to a military academy as punishment for bad behavior . While visiting the academy , Lisa sees that the school is far more challenging than hers and she decides that she wants to attend as well . It was directed by Mike B.

 After a day watching mind @-@ numbing videos in class , Lisa becomes concerned that her education is not challenging enough . Meanwhile , Bart 's class visits the Springfield Police Department , where Bart finds a room with several megaphones . After placing them end to end and increasing their amplification , he inadvertently creates a sonic shockwave that shatters all the glass in Springfield . Chief Wiggum suggests sending Bart to military school to correct his behavior . When the family visit the school , Lisa is impressed by the challenging curriculum and decides to attend with Bart. 
 Lisa stirs discontent among the students , as she is the first female student and gets her own barracks . She and Bart are subjected to hazing ; Bart is eventually accepted and distances himself from his sister . Lonely , Lisa considers going home , but decides to see it through . As the school year comes to a close , the Commandant reveals the final test for the students : the " Eliminator " , a hand @-@ over @-@ hand crawl across a rope suspended high above thorn bushes . Lisa fears she will not be able to complete the task , but Bart helps her train in secret . 
 On the day of the test , Lisa is the last to cross the Eliminator . She is about to fall and the students jeer , but Bart cheers her on and she makes it across safely . The other students vow to make the rest of the semester a living hell for him , but realize they graduate in three hours . The Commandant awards Lisa a special medal " For Satisfactory Completion of the Second Grade " .

 The episode was written by Richard Appel , but the idea of Bart and Lisa attending a military academy had previously been pitched , and had been floating around since 1991 . The idea had not yet been used as an episode plot , because the writers had not felt comfortable with taking Bart and Lisa to a strange place early in the series . 
 During the scene where the Commandant is talking , there is a brief shot of Lisa blinking . As there had been an error in the final print of the episode , the shot was animated , painted and shot on May 16 , 1997 , the Friday before the episode 's airdate . The spiky blond @-@ haired boy , who runs towards the Eliminator while screaming , is a caricature of director Mike B. Anderson . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The episode originally aired on May 18 , 1997 , as the season finale , along with a rerun of " The Springfield Files . " The episode was mistakenly anticipated by some as being about Lisa launching " a legal battle " to enroll at the military school . In its original broadcast , " The Secret War of Lisa Simpson " finished 47th in ratings for the week of May 12 – 18 , 1997 , with a Nielsen rating of 8 @.@ 3 , equivalent to approximately 8 @.@ 1 million viewing households . It was the second highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , following The X @-@ Files . 
 Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , the authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , disliked the episode , writing that it was " very dull " and that Dafoe was not used well . However , Dafoe is one of show runner Josh Weinstein 's favorite guest stars . Ian Johnson argued Dafoe 's casting was " rare " and " somewhat offbeat " . 
 Journalist Raju Mudhar also wrote that in this episode , " The Simpsons have succinctly laid out our eventual future . " This referred to the rise of robots in the real world and the quote from this episode : 
 " The wars of the future will not be fought on the battlefield or at sea . They will be fought in space , or possibly on top of a very tall mountain . In either case , most of the actual fighting will be done by small robots . And as you go forth today remember always your duty is clear : To build and maintain those robots . "

 = Zapp ( band ) = 
 Zapp ( also known as the Zapp Band or Zapp & Roger ) is an American funk band that emerged from Hamilton , Ohio , in 1977 . Particularly influential in the electro subgenre of funk , Zapp served as partial inspiration toward the creation of the G @-@ funk sound of hip @-@ hop popular on the West Coast of the United States in the early to mid 1990s , with many of their songs sampled by numerous hip @-@ hop artists . The original line @-@ up consisted of four brothers — Roger Troutman , Larry Troutman , Lester Troutman and Terry Troutman — and non @-@ Troutman family members Bobby Glover , Gregory Jackson , Sherman Fleetwood , Jerome Derrickson , Eddie Barber and <unk> Boyce . The group received attention in the early 1980s for implementing heavy use of the talk @-@ box , which became one of their most well known characteristics . Zapp worked closely with members George Clinton and Bootsy Collins of the band Parliament @-@ Funkadelic during its early stages , their support being a factor in the group gaining a record deal with Warner Bros. Records in 1979 . Zapp released its eponymous debut album in 1980 , having a sound reminiscent of P @-@ Funk as a result of Clinton 's and Collins ' input on the production . Zapp achieved most of its mainstream recognition from the single " More Bounce to the Ounce " from the same album , now widely regarded as a classic example of early 1980s electronic funk . The following year in 1981 , Clinton stopped working with the band over a record dispute regarding Roger Troutman 's solo debut . Zapp continued to produce several more albums thereafter , releasing Zapp II in 1982 . The album 's musical style veered drastically away from their first release ; despite this , the album sold well , and was certified gold by late 1982 . 
 Zapp disbanded in 1999 after both Roger and Larry Troutman were killed in a murder @-@ suicide , that was apparently carried out by Larry . Roger was shot several times before dying in hospital during surgery . Larry 's body was found close @-@ by in his vehicle with a single gunshot wound to the head . The motive behind Larry 's attack is unclear , but there are speculations that there were arguments over money , and Larry being angry over the lack of consultation from Roger as to why he fired him from being his manager . Zapp reformed briefly in 2003 with the remaining brothers of the Troutman family to produce the album Zapp VI : Back By Popular Demand .

 = = = 1966 – 80 : Early career and major record deal = = = 
 Born on November 29 , 1951 , in Hamilton , Ohio , Roger Troutman began recording music in the late to mid 1960s , issuing his first solo recording efforts " Jolly Roger " and " Night Time " on the obscure and now defunct Ohio label , Teen Records in 1966 under the band name ' Lil ' Roger and His Fabulous Vels . Although neither song received recognition due to its very limited release , Troutman and brothers pursued their music career throughout the 1970s , forming Roger & The Human Body in 1976 , on their privately owned label Troutman Bros. Records . Their own label allowed Troutman and the band to give a slightly wider and more high profile release of their own music , issuing their first ( and only ) album Introducing Roger in 1976 . 
 In the late 1970s Roger Troutman continued to record with his brothers , losing the name Roger & The Human Body and adopting the Zapp nickname from his brother Terry in 1977 . The group searching for recognition , began playing at various small venues locally around Ohio . The Troutman family had long standing friendships with Ohio natives Phelps " Catfish " Collins and William Earl " Bootsy " Collins , who had both been involved with Parliament @-@ Funkadelic in the early 1970s . Phelps and Bootsy were attendees at a performance , and were impressed with Zapp 's musical abilities , prompting Bootsy to invite Roger to the United Sound Studios in Detroit ( the P @-@ Funk studio base ) which was frequently used by Parliament @-@ Funkadelic . Roger Troutman subsequently wrote and recorded the demo for " More Bounce to the Ounce " in 1978 . George Clinton , the leader of Funkadelic liked the recording and encouraged Troutman to present the demo to Warner Bros. Records . Warner Bros. signed Zapp in early 1979 , and on July 28 , 1980 , Zapp released their debut album , which was recorded by Roger and produced by Bootsy between 1979 and early 1980 at the United Sound Studios in Detroit , their first recording on a major label . The album 's sound , which is highly influenced by Parliament @-@ Funkadelic , contrasts largely with Zapp 's later releases . " More Bounce to the Ounce " reached number two on the Billboard Hot R & B tracks for two weeks during the autumn of 1980 . By November 18 , 1980 , Zapp had been certified gold by the RIAA .

 After the 1980 release of Zapp 's debut album , tensions rose between Roger Troutman and George Clinton . Troutman 's solo album The Many Facets of Roger was primarily funded by Clinton , through CBS , and was slated to be released on his own Uncle Jam Records label . By the early 1980s , Clinton and his musical projects were a midst financial troubles due to his poor management skills and shifting tastes in music . Around the time of Troutman 's to be released debut , Warner Bros. Records dropped Clinton from their label , and quietly released The Electric Spanking of War Babies which Troutman had worked briefly on , in early 1981 without much impact . 
 Troutman , seeing the disarray that was surrounding Clinton at the time , accepted Warner Bros. offer of more money for the demo recordings of his album . The move resulted in a bitter severing of partnerships between Clinton and Troutman , and with Clinton 's departure , Troutman was left to exercise virtually full creative control over the band 's later work . In Clinton 's biography George Clinton : For the Record , Troutman was quoted commenting on the situation with a blasé attitude , " ... Heck gee @-@ <unk> , Warner Bros. offered me mo ' money " . In response , Clinton remarked , " CBS paid for it , I paid for it . I don 't like to go into it on the negative side , but it cost about 5 million [ dollars ] , and a lot of people 's jobs and what we consider as the empire falling " . The loss of money that resulted from the actions of Troutman , is credited as one of the factors that disassembled both Clinton 's and Funkadelic 's musical careers . The Many Facets of Roger was eventually released in October 1981 on Warner Bros. 
 = = = 1982 – 85 : Style change and gradual decline = = = 
 Zapp released its second album , Zapp II , on October 14 , 1982 . It focused on more of an electronic orientated sound , containing greater use of the talk @-@ box that is often considered Troutman 's trademark . Despite the contrasting styles between the first and the second albums , Zapp II attained gold status by September 21 , 1982 . The album fared almost as well as Zapp 's debut , peaking at number two on the Billboard R & B chart , and reaching 25 on The Billboard 200 Albums chart . The single " Dancefloor ( Part I ) " peaked at number one on the R & B singles chart of 1982 . 
 Zapp spawned several more albums in close succession within the 1980s , retaining the heavily electronic style that Zapp II had adopted . Zapp III was released in 1983 , but it did not reach the same chart positions as Zapp 's previous efforts . While still gaining a gold certification , it only peaked at 39 on the Billboard 200 and nine on the R & B chart . Zapp III 's poorer commercial performance became a sign that the band 's popularity and impact were beginning to decline toward the mid 1980s , with post @-@ disco music falling out of trend . By the release of The New Zapp IV U on October 25 , 1985 , Zapp 's popularity declined more . The album gained gold status , but only in 1994 , almost a decade after its initial release . Zapp 's presence began to fade in the latter half of the 1980s , and Troutman 's attention was focused on his solo career . The final release by Zapp before Troutman 's death was Zapp V , on September 12 , 1989 , which was met with moderate commercial success and failed to receive an RIAA certification .

 The growing and increasingly dominant West Coast hip @-@ hop scene of the early to mid 1990s brought Zapp and Roger back into the spotlight for a brief amount of time as many hip @-@ hop acts began favoring Zapp 's material as a source for sampling in their own music . Troutman gained recognition for providing talk @-@ box backing vocals for both the original and remixed version of Tupac Shakur 's 1995 @-@ 96 comeback single " California Love " ; the alternate version of the music video features Troutman playing the keyboard and talk @-@ box during a party .

Roger was shot several times in the torso by Larry as he exited a recording studio in Dayton , Ohio . Roger was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital , but died shortly after . Larry 's body was found in a car a short distance away from the murder scene . There were no witnesses at the time , and Larry 's motive for the murder of Roger remains unclear , however , there were increasingly large troubles over money surrounding Larry who managed the family run housing company , Troutman Enterprises . The business filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy , owing $ 400 @,@ 000 in delinquent taxes . Larry was also possibly angry over Roger firing him as manager for his music career , of which Larry had been for several years . 
 During Roger 's funeral , his nephew <unk> Troutman performed a talk @-@ box rendition of " Amazing Grace . " Roger was survived by his six sons and five daughters ; his eldest son , Roger Lynch Troutman Jr . , died of head injuries several years after the murder of Roger , ( January 31 , 1970 – January 22 , 2003 ) . 
 After Troutman 's death , Ice Cube said that " More Bounce To The Ounce " introduced him to hip @-@ hop . " I was in the sixth grade , we 'd stayed after school . We had this dude named Mr. Lock , and he used to bring in his radio with these pop @-@ lockers . He used to teach [ the dance group ] the L.A. Lockers , and he would do community service in after @-@ school programs . He knew a lot of kids and introduced them to all the new dances , he put on that song ' More Bounce ' , and they started pop @-@ locking . And I think from that visual , from seeing that , it was my first introduction into hip @-@ hop . Period . I didn 't know nothing about nothing . I hadn 't heard " Rapper 's Delight " yet . It was the first thing that was really fly to me . They started dancing , and since ' More Bounce ' goes on forever , they just got down . I just think that was a rush of adrenaline for me , like a chemical reaction in my brain . " 
 The resulting impact of Roger and Larry 's deaths left the band stranded , halting production . Without Roger serving as the creative source , they effectively disbanded , and quietly left the music industry altogether . Warner Bros. Records eventually dropped the band from their label , bringing the professional recording career of Zapp to a close . A few years later , Zapp resurfaced for a short period after the establishment of its own independent label , Zapp Town Records , managed by the Troutman family . The label released its only album , Zapp VI : Back By Popular Demand , in 2003 . Zapp returned to performing only in live concert , touring across the U.S. at various venues . 
 Lester Troutman Sr. and Terry Troutman confirmed the presence of a new project / album in the works with an expected release date of August 2015 .

 = Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 = 
 Austria participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 with the song " Rise Like a Phoenix " , written by Charlie Mason , Joey Patulka , Ali Zuckowski and Julian Maas . The song was performed by Conchita Wurst , the drag stage persona of Tom Neuwirth , who had risen to fame after taking part in an Austrian talent show in 2011 and attempting to represent Austria at the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 . In September 2013 the Austrian broadcaster Österreichischer Rundfunk ( ORF ) announced that they had internally selected Wurst to compete at the 2014 contest in Copenhagen , Denmark , with her song presented to the public in March 2014 . 
 After a promotional tour of several European countries , Austria was seen as one of the countries most likely to qualify for the grand final . In the second of the Eurovision semi @-@ finals " Rise Like a Phoenix " came first of the 15 participating countries , securing its place among the 26 other countries in the final . In Austria 's forty @-@ seventh Eurovision appearance on 10 May , " Rise Like a Phoenix " became the sixty @-@ second song to win the Eurovision Song Contest , receiving a total of 290 points and full marks from thirteen countries . This was Austria 's second win in the contest , having previously won in 1966 . 
 After the show , the song went on to chart in several European countries , reaching number one in Austria and the UK Indie Chart , as well as reaching the top 10 in a further 10 countries . Wurst 's appearance in the contest brought about both criticism and praise : by some of the more socially conservative sections of European society her victory in the contest was condemned as a promotion of LGBT rights ; conversely the international attention received by Wurst 's victory firmly established her among the LGBT community , leading her to take an active role in promoting tolerance and respect , and resulted in several invites to perform at several European pride events , as well as performances at the European Parliament and United Nations Office at Vienna . 
 = = Background = = 
 Prior to the 2014 contest , Austria had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest forty @-@ six times since its first entry in 1957 , winning it in 1966 with the song " Merci , <unk> " performed by Udo Jürgens . Following the introduction of semi @-@ finals for the 2004 contest , Austria had featured in only two finals . Austria 's least successful result has been last place , which they have achieved on eight occasions , most recently in the 2012 contest . Austria has also received nul points on three occasions ; in 1962 , 1988 and 1991 . 
 The Austrian national broadcaster , Österreichischer Rundfunk ( ORF ) , broadcasts the event within Austria and organises the selection process for the nation 's entry . From 2011 to 2013 , ORF had set up national finals with several artists to choose both the song and performer to compete at Eurovision for Austria , with both the public and a panel of jury members involved in the selection . For the 2014 Eurovision Song Contest , ORF held an internal selection to choose the artist and song to represent Austria at the contest . This method had last been used by ORF in 2007 .

 = = = Selection procedure = = = 
 ORF confirmed their intentions to participate at the 2014 Eurovision Song Contest on 6 September 2013 . On 10 September 2013 , the broadcaster announced that they had internally selected Conchita Wurst to represent Austria in Copenhagen . Wurst is the drag stage persona of Tom Neuwirth , who in 2007 finished second in the third season of Austrian talent show <unk> , behind the 2011 Austrian entry Nadine <unk> . Neuwirth went on to join the boy band <unk> Anders ! along with other contestants from <unk> in 2007 , which disbanded later that year . Following this , Neuwirth , who uses masculine pronouns when referring to himself but feminine pronouns to describe Wurst , went on to developed his new drag persona and appeared on ORF 's talent show Die <unk> Chance ( " The Big Opportunity " ) as Wurst in 2011 , achieving sixth place . Wurst went on to compete in the Austrian selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 with the song " That 's What I Am " , qualifying for the super final and finishing second with 49 percent of the public vote . 
 ORF confirmed in October 2013 that the song to be performed by Wurst at the contest would also be chosen internally . On 18 March 2014 at a ORF press conference in Vienna , the song " Rise Like a Phoenix " was announced as the Austrian entry for the contest . The song was written by Charlie Mason , Joey Patulka , Ali Zuckowski and Julian Maas . Wurst 's first live performance of the song was on 22 March 2014 , during an episode of Dancing Stars , the Austrian version of international franchise Dancing with the Stars . 
 As part of the contest 's graphic design , special postcards were commissioned by the Danish host broadcaster DR to introduce each of the participating countries before the acts took to the stage . For the 2014 contest the contestants were asked to take a photo of their country 's flag , made in a creative way . Austria 's postcard was the first to be filmed by DR , and was shot at the Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna featuring Wurst and her stylist Tamara Mascara creating the Austrian flag out of 70 baroque @-@ style dresses . 
 In the run @-@ up to the contest , Wurst asked her fans to take part in a campaign called " <unk> for Tolerance " , in which they would wear knitted beards in a display of tolerance and respect , also promising that she would take all beards that she received with her to Copenhagen . 
 = = = Selection controversy = = = 
 The selection of Wurst caused some controversy in Austria and the rest of Europe . A Facebook group which amassed approximately 38 @,@ 000 members protested the decision by the publicly funded broadcaster ORF , to internally select the country 's Eurovision act without a public vote . In an interview with Austrian newspaper Kurier , Wurst defended her internal selection by ORF , noting that the broadcaster had the sole responsibility of making decisions regarding the contest and that the 2007 internal selection of Eric <unk> received no backlash from the Austrian public . Wurst also claimed that the criticism from the group surpassed protest against her as the selected artist and instead " displayed homophobic statements and discrimination " , and she vowed to " continue fighting against discrimination " in response to the Facebook group . 
 Wurst 's selection for Eurovision also sparked outrage outside of Austria ; in Belarus , a petition by more than 2 @,@ 000 people petitioned the Belarusian Ministry of Information to prevent the contest from being broadcast in the country , claiming it to being " a hotbed of sodomy " and an attempt by European liberals to impose Western values on Belarus and Russia . A similar petition of more than 15 @,@ 000 signatures was also received by the Russian Ministry of Communications and Mass Media from the " All @-@ Russian parenting group " , claiming that Wurst " leads the lifestyle inapplicable [ sic ] for Russians " Wurst also received criticism from the Armenian representative , Aram Mp3 , who claimed that her lifestyle was " not natural " and that she should " eventually decide whether she is a woman or a man " . Aram MP3 later apologised and insisted his statements were " a joke " . 
 In response to petitions in Russia , Belarus and Ukraine asking for Wurst to be removed from the competition , some of the other 2014 participants gave Wurst their support . Ireland 's representative Kasey Smith , said that " everyone should be allowed in " to Eurovision and that she " totally disagree [ s ] with what they are doing . It 's homophobia . " 
 = = = Promotion = = = 
 Before her appearance at the contest , Wurst went on a promotional tour , performing in several European countries . Prior to her song selection , Wurst appeared at a Eurovision fan event in Vienna in October 2013 held by the Austrian branch of OGAE , an international organisation of Eurovision fan clubs across Europe and beyond , where she shared the stage with Anne @-@ Marie David , the 1973 Eurovision winner . On 28 March Wurst appeared at the 2014 <unk> Party , held by OGAE Spain , in Madrid . On 29 March 2014 , Wurst was a guest at the " Eurovision Pre @-@ Party Riga " in Latvia , appearing alongside Poland 's 2014 representatives <unk> & Cleo and Latvia 's 2013 representatives <unk> . Wurst was also one of 26 acts from the 2014 contest to perform during the 2014 Eurovision in Concert , the largest gathering of Eurovision artists outside of Eurovision itself , held in the Melkweg , a popular music venue in Amsterdam , the Netherlands on 5 April 2014 . This was followed by an appearance at the London Preview Party alongside 15 other participating entries from 2014 , held at the Café de Paris nightclub in London on 13 April . Wurst also took part in several interviews and performances on Irish , Belgian and Dutch television networks . 
 = = At Eurovision = = 
 According to Eurovision rules , all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the " Big 5 " ( France , Germany , Italy , Spain and the United Kingdom ) are required to qualify from one of two semi @-@ finals in order to compete for the final ; the top ten countries from each semi @-@ final progress to the final . The European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests , with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot . On 20 January 2014 , a special allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi @-@ finals , as well as which half of the show they would perform in . Austria was placed into the second semi @-@ final , to be held on 8 May 2014 , and was scheduled to perform in the first half of the show . 
 Once all the competing songs for the 2014 contest had been released , the running order for the semi @-@ finals was decided by the shows ' producers rather than through another draw , so that similar songs were not placed next to each other . Austria was set to perform in position 6 , following the entry from Poland and before the entry from Lithuania . All three shows were broadcast on ORF eins , with commentary by Andi Knoll . The Austrian spokesperson , who announced the Austrian votes during the final , was Kati <unk> . 
 = = = Semi @-@ final = = = 
 Wurst took part in technical rehearsals on 30 April and 3 May , followed by dress rehearsals on 7 and 8 May . This included the jury final where professional juries of each country , responsible for 50 percent of each country 's vote , watched and voted on the competing entries . 
 The stage show featured Wurst in a cream @-@ covered mermaid @-@ like dress standing on a pedestal in the middle of the stage . The stage appeared dark at the beginning of the song with minimal lighting , before the lighting rose towards the beginning of the first chorus . At the start of the song , the camera appeared at the back of the arena before swooping into centre stage to a close @-@ up of Wurst , followed by it flying off again at the beginning of the chorus . The background LED screens featured at the first chorus flaming rain , followed by flames in the shape of wings , in reference to the phoenix in the title of the song . <unk> flames also featured at the finale of the song . Wind machines were also used to effect during the performance . 
 At the end of the show , it was announced that Austria had finished in the top 10 and thus qualifying for the grand final ; it was the last qualifying country to be announced by the show 's hosts , Pilou Asbæk and Nikolaj Koppel . It was later revealed that Austria had won the semi @-@ final , receiving a total of 169 points . 
 = = = Final = = = 
 Shortly after the second semi @-@ final , a winner 's press conference was held for the ten qualifying countries . As part of this press conference , the qualifying artists took part in a draw to determine which half of the grand final they would subsequently participate in . This draw was done in the order the countries were announced during the semi @-@ final . Austria was drawn to compete in the first half . Following this draw , the shows ' producers decided upon the running order of the final , as they had done for the semi @-@ finals . Austria was subsequently placed to perform in position 11 , following the entry from Greece and before the entry from Germany . On the day of the grand final , Austria was considered by bookmakers to be the second most likely to win the competition , placed only behind the entry from Sweden . 
 Wurst once again took part in dress rehearsals on 9 and 10 May before the final , including the jury final where the professional juries casted their final votes before the live show . Wurst performed a repeat of her semi @-@ final performance during the final on 10 May . After a slow start , Austria eventually took the lead in the voting and won the competition with 290 points , beating the Netherlands and Sweden into second and third places respectively . Austria received 12 points , the maximum number of points a country can give to another country , from thirteen countries . The broadcast was watched by an average 1 @.@ 3 million people in Austria , receiving a 54 @.@ 4 percent market share .

 The Marcel Bezençon Awards , first awarded during the 2002 contest , are awards honouring the best competing songs in the final each year . Named after the creator of the annual contest , Marcel Bezençon , the awards are divided into 3 categories : the Press Award , given to the best entry as voted on by the accredited media and press during the event ; the Artistic Award , presented to the best artist as voted on by the shows ' commentators ; and the Composer Award , given to the best and most original composition as voted by the participating composers . " Rise Like a Phoenix " was awarded the Press Award , which was accepted at the awards ceremony by Kathrin <unk> , ORF 's Managing Director . 
 = = = Voting = = = 
 Voting during the three shows consisted of 50 percent public televoting and 50 percent from a jury deliberation . The jury consisted of five music industry professionals who were citizens of the country they represent , with their names published before the contest to ensure transparency . This jury was asked to judge each contestant based on : vocal capacity ; the stage performance ; the song 's composition and originality ; and the overall impression by the act . In addition , no member of a national jury could be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently . The individual rankings of each jury member were released shortly after the grand final .

 As the winners of the 2014 contest , Austria was given the responsibility of hosting the 2015 contest . Shortly after the 2014 final , ORF confirmed the preliminary dates for the 2015 contest , as well as that several cities in Austria were competing to host the 60th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest . After a competition was held to determine the host venue , three cities were short @-@ listed by ORF : Vienna ; Innsbruck ; and Graz . On 6 August it was announced that the Wiener Stadthalle in Vienna would host the 2015 contest , scheduled to be held on 19 , 21 and 23 May 2015 . On 19 December 2014 , the hosts of the contest were announced , with Wurst taking on the role of green room host for the event . 
 On Wurst 's return to Austria after winning Eurovision , she was greeted at Vienna International Airport by thousands of fans and hundreds journalists celebrating her victory . On 18 May she met with Werner <unk> , the Chancellor of Austria and Josef <unk> , the Minister of Arts , Culture , and Media at an official reception , followed by a performance on stage at Vienna 's <unk> to an audience of thousands of fans . The concert was however criticised by the conservative Austrian People 's Party , a member of the coalition government . 
 " Rise Like a Phoenix " went on to become a hit across Europe , reaching the top 3 in iTunes download charts in fourteen countries , including both Belarus and Russia , where she had courted controversy before the contest . The song also reached the top 10 in charts in twelve countries , including number one in Austria and the UK Indie Chart . 
 Wurst received both praise and criticism following her victory . Many celebrities sent their congratulations and support to Wurst via Twitter and other means , including Elton John , Cher , Lady Gaga , Boy George and Robbie Williams , as well as from fellow Eurovision winners Alexander Rybak , Emmelie de Forest , Lena Meyer @-@ Landrut and Charlotte <unk> . However her victory was also met with negative reaction by some more conservative sections of European society . In Turkey , which had not taken part in the contest since 2012 , the government party AKP criticised Wurst 's win , with then @-@ Prime Minister of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan vowing that Turkey would never take part in the contest again and his colleague <unk> <unk> proclaiming " Thank god we no longer participate in Eurovision " . 
 Church leaders in the Balkans have also claimed that Wurst 's win is responsible for floods in south @-@ east Europe in May 2014 , which left over 60 people dead . Metropolitan <unk> , the Montenegrin patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church claimed that " this [ flood ] is not a coincidence , but a warning " and a " reminder that people should not join the wild side " , Patriarch <unk> , the spiritual leader of Eastern Orthodox Serbs has reportedly said the floods are " divine punishment for their vices " and that " God is thus washing Serbia of its sins " . Wurst had previously been condemned by the Russian Orthodox Church . However Fr . Michael Unger , Tom Neuwirth 's childhood Catholic priest , condemned the homophobic backlash against him , and said that he is " just happy that he 's happy " . 
 In the wake of her Eurovision win , Wurst was invited onto several television programmes across Europe . Wurst appeared as a guest on several BBC programmes in the United Kingdom ; including The Graham Norton Show on 16 May , a chat show hosted by British commentator Graham Norton ; and on 23 May 2014 she appeared on The One Show and Newsnight . Wurst was invited onto the German talk show TV total on 4 June 2014 , hosted by former Eurovision contestant and host Stefan Raab , and was in demand by German broadcaster RTL as a new personality for their upcoming reality shows . Wurst also performed on the popular Swedish show <unk> på Skansen in July 2014 . 
 In June 2014 , Wurst headlined the Vienna Life Ball , Europe 's biggest charity event supporting people with HIV and AIDS , attending the event in a dress designed by Jean Paul Gaultier . Wurst has since modelled for both Gautier and Karl Lagerfeld at several events . 
 Both before and after her Eurovision win , Wurst had become very involved with the LGBT community . In June 2014 Wurst recorded a message for the It Gets Better Project , an Internet @-@ based project devoted to preventing suicide among LGBT youth by having gay adults convey the message that their lives will improve , and to inspire change required to make life better for them . Wurst was also invited to perform at several pride events in several cities across Europe , including in Stockholm , Zürich , Dublin , Berlin , Madrid , Amsterdam , London and Manchester among others . In October 2014 , British gay lifestyle magazine Attitude awarded Wurst with the ' Moment of the Year ' award for her win at Eurovision as part of the 2014 Attitude Awards . 
 In October 2014 , Wurst accepted an invitation by Ulrike <unk> MEP , vice @-@ president of the Austrian Greens , to perform in a special concert at the European Parliament . The concert was organised by MEPs from 5 different parliamentary groups , with the aim to support the adoption of a report against homophobia and sexual discrimination in February . This was followed in November 2014 by a performance at the United Nations Office at Vienna and a meeting with the Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations Ban Ki @-@ moon . Ban hailed Wurst 's win as a " powerful message " , praising her promotion of respect for diversity , which he called a " core value " of the United Nations and that " discrimination has no place in the United Nations , nor in the world of the 21st century " . Wurst had also extended her CV into voice acting , voicing the character of Eva in the German dub of the computer @-@ animated film Penguins of Madagascar , spin @-@ off of the Madagascar film franchise . 
 = Margaret Thatcher = 
 Margaret Hilda Thatcher , Baroness Thatcher , LG , OM , PC , FRS , <unk> ( née Roberts ; 13 October 1925 – 8 April 2013 ) was a British stateswoman and politician who was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990 and the Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990 . She was the longest @-@ serving British prime minister of the 20th century and the first woman to have held the office . A Soviet journalist dubbed her the " Iron Lady " , a nickname that became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style . As Prime Minister , she implemented policies that have come to be known as Thatcherism . 
 Originally a research chemist before becoming a barrister , Thatcher was elected Member of Parliament ( MP ) for Finchley in 1959 . Edward Heath appointed her Secretary of State for Education and Science in his 1970 government . In 1975 , Thatcher defeated Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and became the first woman to lead a major political party in the United Kingdom . She became Prime Minister after winning the 1979 general election . 
 On moving into 10 Downing Street , Thatcher introduced a series of political and economic initiatives intended to reverse high unemployment and Britain 's struggles in the wake of the Winter of Discontent and an ongoing recession . Her political philosophy and economic policies emphasised deregulation ( particularly of the financial sector ) , flexible labour markets , the privatisation of state @-@ owned companies , and reducing the power and influence of trade unions . Thatcher 's popularity during her first years in office waned amid recession and high unemployment , until victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a resurgence of support , resulting in her re @-@ election in 1983 . 
 Thatcher was re @-@ elected for a third term in 1987 . During this period her support for a Community Charge ( referred to as the " poll tax " ) was widely unpopular , and her views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet . She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990 , after Michael Heseltine launched a challenge to her leadership . After retiring from the Commons in 1992 , she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher , of Kesteven in the county of Lincolnshire , which entitled her to sit in the House of Lords . After a series of small strokes in 2002 , she was advised to withdraw from public speaking . Despite this , she managed to <unk> a eulogy to Ronald Reagan prior to his death , which was broadcast at his funeral in 2004 . In 2013 , she died of another stroke in London at the age of 87 . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Thatcher was born Margaret Hilda Roberts on 13 October 1925 , in Grantham , Lincolnshire . Her father was Alfred Roberts , originally from Northamptonshire , and her mother was Beatrice Ethel ( née Stephenson ) from Lincolnshire . She spent her childhood in Grantham , where her father owned two grocery shops . She and her older sister Muriel ( 1921 – 2004 ) were raised in the flat above the larger of the two , on North Parade . Her father was active in local politics and the Methodist church , serving as an alderman and a local preacher , and brought up his daughter as a strict Wesleyan Methodist attending the <unk> Street Methodist Church . He came from a Liberal family but stood – as was then customary in local government – as an Independent . He was Mayor of Grantham in 1945 – 46 and lost his position as alderman in 1952 after the Labour Party won its first majority on Grantham Council in 1950 . 
 Margaret Roberts attended <unk> Road Primary School and won a scholarship to Kesteven and Grantham Girls ' School . Her school reports showed hard work and continual improvement ; her extracurricular activities included the piano , field hockey , poetry recitals , swimming and walking . She was head girl in 1942 – 43 . In her upper sixth year she applied for a scholarship to study chemistry at Somerville College , Oxford , but she was initially rejected and was offered a place only after another candidate withdrew . Roberts arrived at Oxford in 1943 and graduated in 1947 with Second @-@ Class Honours in the four @-@ year Chemistry Bachelor of Science degree , specialising in X @-@ ray crystallography under the supervision of Dorothy Hodgkin . Her dissertation was on the structure of the antibiotic gramicidin . Even while working on chemistry , she was already thinking towards law and politics . She was reportedly more proud of becoming the first Prime Minister with a science degree than the first female Prime Minister . 
 Roberts became President of the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1946 . She was influenced at university by political works such as Friedrich Hayek 's The Road to Serfdom ( 1944 ) , which condemned economic intervention by government as a precursor to an authoritarian state . After graduating , Roberts moved to Colchester in Essex to work as a research chemist for BX Plastics . In 1948 she applied for a job at ICI , but was rejected after the personnel department assessed her as " headstrong , obstinate and dangerously self @-@ opinionated " . Roberts joined the local Conservative Association and attended the party conference at Llandudno in 1948 , as a representative of the University Graduate Conservative Association . One of her Oxford friends was also a friend of the Chair of the Dartford Conservative Association in Kent , who were looking for candidates . Officials of the association were so impressed by her that they asked her to apply , even though she was not on the Conservative Party 's approved list : she was selected in January 1951 , aged 25 , and added to the approved list post ante . At a dinner following her formal adoption as Conservative candidate for Dartford in February 1951 she met Denis Thatcher , a successful and wealthy divorced businessman , who drove her to her Essex train . In preparation for the election Roberts moved to Dartford , where she supported herself by working as a research chemist for J. Lyons and Co. in Hammersmith , part of a team developing emulsifiers for ice cream . 
 = = Early political career = = 
 In the 1950 and 1951 general elections , Roberts was the Conservative candidate for the safe Labour seat of Dartford . The local party selected her as its candidate because , though not a dynamic public speaker , Roberts was well @-@ prepared and fearless in her answers ; another prospective candidate recalled that " Once she opened her mouth , the rest of us began to look rather second @-@ rate " . She attracted media attention as the youngest and the only female candidate . She lost on both occasions to Norman Dodds , but reduced the Labour majority by 6 @,@ 000 , and then a further 1 @,@ 000 . During the campaigns , she was supported by her parents and by Denis Thatcher , whom she married in December 1951 . Denis funded his wife 's studies for the bar ; she qualified as a barrister in 1953 and specialised in taxation . Later that same year their twins Carol and Mark were born , delivered by Caesarean section . 
 The marriage led to her being referred to as " Mrs Denis Thatcher " – now considered dated – by such official sources as selection minutes , travel itineraries , and society publications such as Queen , even after her election as a Member of Parliament , after which she preferred " Mrs Margaret Thatcher " . 
 = = = Member of Parliament : 1959 – 70 = = = 
 In 1954 , Thatcher was defeated when she sought selection to be the Conservative party candidate for the Orpington by @-@ election of January 1955 . She chose not to stand as a candidate in the 1955 general election , in later years stating " I really just felt the twins were ... only two , I really felt that it was too soon . I couldn 't do that . " Afterwards , Thatcher began looking for a Conservative safe seat and was selected as the candidate for Finchley in April 1958 ( narrowly beating Ian Montagu Fraser ) . She was elected as MP for the seat after a hard campaign in the 1959 election . Benefiting from her fortunate result in a lottery for backbenchers to propose new legislation , Thatcher 's maiden speech was in support of her private member 's bill ( Public Bodies ( Admission to Meetings ) Act 1960 ) , requiring local authorities to hold their council meetings in public . In 1961 she went against the Conservative Party 's official position by voting for the restoration of <unk> as a judicial corporal punishment . 
 Thatcher 's talent and drive caused her to be mentioned as a future Prime Minister in her early 20s although she herself was more pessimistic , stating as late as 1970 that " There will not be a woman prime minister in my lifetime — the male population is too prejudiced . " In October 1961 she was promoted to the front bench as Parliamentary Undersecretary at the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance in Harold Macmillan 's administration . Thatcher was the youngest woman in history to receive such a post , and among the first MPs elected in 1959 to be promoted . After the Conservatives lost the 1964 election she became spokeswoman on Housing and Land , in which position she advocated her party 's policy of allowing tenants to buy their council houses . She moved to the Shadow Treasury team in 1966 and , as Treasury spokeswoman , opposed Labour 's mandatory price and income controls , arguing that they would produce effects contrary to those intended and distort the economy . 
 By 1966 , party leaders viewed Thatcher as a potential Shadow Cabinet member . James Prior proposed her as a member after the Conservatives ' 1966 defeat , but party leader Edward Heath and Chief Whip Willie Whitelaw chose Mervyn Pike as the shadow cabinet 's sole woman member . 
 At the Conservative Party Conference of 1966 she criticised the high @-@ tax policies of the Labour Government as being steps " not only towards Socialism , but towards Communism " , arguing that lower taxes served as an incentive to hard work . Thatcher was one of the few Conservative MPs to support Leo Abse 's Bill to decriminalise male homosexuality . She voted in favour of David Steel 's bill to legalise abortion , as well as a ban on hare coursing . She supported the retention of capital punishment and voted against the relaxation of divorce laws . 
 In 1967 , the United States Embassy in London chose Thatcher to take part in the International Visitor Leadership Program ( then called the Foreign Leader Program ) , a professional exchange programme that gave her the opportunity to spend about six weeks visiting various US cities and political figures as well as institutions such as the International Monetary Fund . Although she was not yet a cabinet or shadow cabinet member , the embassy reportedly described her to the State Department as a possible future prime minister . The description helped Thatcher meet with many prominent people during a busy itinerary focused on economic issues , including Paul Samuelson , Walt Rostow , Pierre @-@ Paul Schweitzer , and Nelson Rockefeller . After Pike 's retirement , Heath appointed Thatcher later that year to the Shadow Cabinet as Fuel and Power spokesman . Shortly before the 1970 general election , she was promoted to Shadow Transport spokesman and later to Education . 
 = = = Education Secretary : 1970 – 74 = = = 
 The Conservative Party under Edward Heath won the 1970 general election , and Thatcher was subsequently appointed to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Education and Science . During her first months in office she attracted public attention as a result of the administration 's attempts to cut spending . She gave priority to academic needs in schools . She imposed public expenditure cuts on the state education system , resulting in the abolition of free milk for schoolchildren aged seven to eleven . She held that few children would suffer if schools were charged for milk , but agreed to provide younger children with a third of a pint daily , for nutritional purposes . Cabinet papers later revealed that she opposed the policy but had been forced into it by the Treasury . Her decision provoked a storm of protest from Labour and the press , leading to the moniker " Margaret Thatcher , Milk Snatcher " . She reportedly considered leaving politics in the aftermath and later wrote in her autobiography : " I learned a valuable lesson [ from the experience ] . I had incurred the maximum of political odium for the minimum of political benefit . " 
 Thatcher 's term of office was marked by proposals for more local education authorities to close grammar schools and to adopt comprehensive secondary education . Although she was committed to a tiered secondary modern @-@ grammar school system of education and was determined to preserve grammar schools , during her tenure as Education Secretary she turned down only 326 of 3 @,@ 612 proposals for schools to become comprehensives ; the proportion of pupils attending comprehensive schools consequently rose from 32 per cent to 62 per cent .

 The Heath government continued to experience difficulties with oil embargoes and union demands for wage increases in 1973 and lost the February 1974 general election . Labour formed a minority government and went on to win a narrow majority in the October 1974 general election . Heath 's leadership of the Conservative Party looked increasingly in doubt . Thatcher was not initially the obvious replacement , but she eventually became the main challenger , promising a fresh start . Her main support came from the Conservative 1922 Committee , but Thatcher 's time in office gave her the reputation of a pragmatist instead of an ideologue . She defeated Heath on the first ballot and he resigned the leadership . In the second ballot she defeated Whitelaw , Heath 's preferred successor . The vote polarised along right @-@ left lines , with the region , experience and education of the MP also having their effects . Thatcher 's support was stronger among MPs on the right , those from southern England , and those who had not attended public schools or Oxbridge . 
 Thatcher became party leader and Leader of the Opposition on 11 February 1975 ; she appointed Whitelaw as her deputy . Heath was never reconciled to Thatcher 's leadership . 
 Thatcher began to attend lunches regularly at the Institute of Economic Affairs ( IEA ) , a think tank founded by the poultry magnate Antony Fisher , a disciple of Friedrich Hayek ; she had been visiting the IEA and reading its publications since the early 1960s . There she was influenced by the ideas of Ralph Harris and Arthur Seldon , and she became the face of the ideological movement opposing the welfare state . Keynesian economics , they believed , was weakening Britain . The institute 's pamphlets proposed less government , lower taxes , and more freedom for business and consumers . 
 Television critic Clive James , writing in The Observer during the voting for the leadership , compared her voice of 1973 to a cat sliding down a blackboard . Thatcher had already begun to work on her presentation on the advice of Gordon Reece , a former television producer . By chance Reece met the actor Laurence Olivier , who arranged lessons with the National Theatre 's voice coach . Thatcher succeeded in completely suppressing her Lincolnshire dialect except when under stress , notably after provocation from Denis Healey in the House of Commons in April 1983 , when she accused the Labour front bench of being frit . 
 On 19 January 1976 Thatcher made a speech in Kensington Town Hall in which she made a scathing attack on the Soviet Union : 
 The Russians are bent on world dominance , and they are rapidly acquiring the means to become the most powerful imperial nation the world has seen . The men in the Soviet Politburo do not have to worry about the ebb and flow of public opinion . They put guns before butter , while we put just about everything before guns . 
 In response , the Soviet Defence Ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda ( Red Star ) called her the " Iron Lady , " a sobriquet she gladly adopted . 
 Margaret Thatcher wanted to prevent the creation of a Scottish assembly . She told Conservative MPs to vote against the Scotland and Wales Bill in December 1976 , which was defeated , and then when new Bills were proposed she supported amending the legislation to allow the English to vote in the 1979 referendum on devolution . 
 Britain 's economy during the 1970s was so weak that Foreign Minister James Callaghan warned his fellow Labour Cabinet members in 1974 of the possibility of " a breakdown of democracy " , telling them that " If I were a young man , I would emigrate . " In mid @-@ 1978 , the economy began to improve and opinion polls showed Labour in the lead , with a general election being expected later that year and a Labour win a serious possibility . Now Prime Minister , Callaghan surprised many by announcing on 7 September that there would be no general election that year and he would wait until 1979 before going to the polls . Thatcher reacted to this by branding the Labour government " chickens " , and Liberal Party leader David Steel joined in , criticising Labour for " running scared " . 
 The Labour government then faced fresh public unease about the direction of the country and a damaging series of strikes during the winter of 1978 – 79 , dubbed the " Winter of Discontent " . The Conservatives attacked the Labour government 's unemployment record , using advertising with the slogan " Labour Isn 't Working " . A general election was called after Callaghan 's government lost a motion of no confidence in early 1979 . The Conservatives won a 44 @-@ seat majority in the House of Commons , and took charge .

 Thatcher became Prime Minister on 4 May 1979 . Arriving at 10 Downing Street , she said , in a paraphrase of St. Francis of Assisi 's prayer Make Me an Instrument of Your Peace : 
 Where there is discord , may we bring harmony . Where there is error , may we bring truth . Where there is doubt , may we bring faith . And where there is despair , may we bring hope . 
 = = = Relations with the Queen = = = 
 As Prime Minister , Thatcher met weekly with Queen Elizabeth II to discuss government business , and their relationship came under close scrutiny . 
 In July 1986 , The Sunday Times reported claims attributed to the Queen 's advisers of a " rift " between Buckingham Palace and Downing Street " over a wide range of domestic and international issues " . 
 The Palace issued an official denial , heading off speculation about a possible constitutional crisis . After Thatcher 's retirement a senior Palace source again dismissed as " nonsense " the " stereotyped idea " that she had not got along with the Queen , or that they had fallen out over Thatcherite policies . Thatcher later wrote : " I always found the Queen 's attitude towards the work of the Government absolutely correct ... stories of clashes between ' two powerful women ' were just too good not to make up . " 
 = = = = Economy and taxation = = = = 
 Thatcher 's economic policy was influenced by monetarist thinking and economists such as Milton Friedman and Alan Walters . Together with Chancellor of the Exchequer Geoffrey Howe , she lowered direct taxes on income and increased indirect taxes . She increased interest rates to slow the growth of the money supply and thereby lower inflation , introduced cash limits on public spending , and reduced expenditure on social services such as education and housing . Her cuts in higher education spending resulted in her being the first Oxford @-@ educated post @-@ war Prime Minister not to be awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Oxford , after a 738 to 319 vote of the governing assembly and a student petition . Her new centrally funded City Technology Colleges did not enjoy much success , and the Funding Agency for Schools was set up to control expenditure by opening and closing schools ; the Social Market Foundation , a centre @-@ left think tank , described it as having " an extraordinary range of dictatorial powers " . 
 Some <unk> Conservatives in the Cabinet , the so @-@ called " wets " , expressed doubt over Thatcher 's policies . The 1981 England riots resulted in the British media discussing the need for a policy U @-@ turn . At the 1980 Conservative Party conference , Thatcher addressed the issue directly , with a speech written by the playwright Ronald Millar that included the lines : " You turn if you want to . The lady 's not for turning ! " 
 Thatcher 's job approval rating fell to 23 % by December 1980 , lower than recorded for any previous Prime Minister . As the recession of the early 1980s deepened she increased taxes , despite concerns expressed in a statement signed by 364 leading economists issued towards the end of March 1981 . 
 By 1982 , the UK began to experience signs of economic recovery ; inflation was down to 8 @.@ 6 % from a high of 18 % , but unemployment was over 3 million for the first time since the 1930s . By 1983 overall economic growth was stronger and inflation and mortgage rates were at their lowest levels since 1970 , although manufacturing output had dropped by 30 % since 1978 and unemployment remained high , peaking at 3 @.@ 3 million in 1984 . 
 By 1987 , unemployment was falling , the economy was stable and strong , and inflation was low . Opinion polls showed a comfortable Conservative lead , and local council election results had also been successful , prompting Thatcher to call a general election for 11 June that year , despite the deadline for an election still being 12 months away . The election saw Thatcher re @-@ elected for a third successive term . Throughout the 1980s revenue from the 90 % tax on North Sea oil extraction was used as a short @-@ term funding source to balance the economy and pay the costs of reform . 
 Thatcher reformed local government taxes by replacing domestic rates – a tax based on the nominal rental value of a home – with the Community Charge ( or poll tax ) in which the same amount was charged to each adult resident . The new tax was introduced in Scotland in 1989 and in England and Wales the following year , and proved to be among the most unpopular policies of her premiership . Public disquiet culminated in a 70 @,@ 000 to 200 @,@ 000 @-@ strong demonstration in London on 31 March 1990 ; the demonstration around Trafalgar Square deteriorated into the Poll Tax Riots , leaving 113 people injured and 340 under arrest . The Community Charge was abolished by her successor , John Major . 
 = = = = Industrial relations = = = = 
 Thatcher was committed to reducing the power of the trade unions , whose leadership she accused of undermining parliamentary democracy and economic performance through strike action . Several unions launched strikes in response to legislation introduced to curb their power , but resistance eventually collapsed . Only 39 % of union members voted for Labour in the 1983 general election . According to the BBC , Thatcher " managed to destroy the power of the trade unions for almost a generation " . 
 The miners ' strike was the biggest confrontation between the unions and the Thatcher government . In March 1984 the National Coal Board ( NCB ) proposed to close 20 of the 174 state @-@ owned mines and cut 20 @,@ 000 jobs out of 187 @,@ 000 . 
 Two @-@ thirds of the country 's miners , led by the National Union of Mineworkers ( NUM ) under Arthur Scargill , downed tools in protest . Scargill had refused to hold a ballot on the strike , having previously lost three ballots on a national strike ( January 1982 , October 1982 , and March 1983 ) . This led to the strike being declared illegal . 
 Thatcher refused to meet the union 's demands and compared the miners ' dispute to the Falklands conflict two years earlier , declaring in a speech in 1984 : " We had to fight the enemy without in the Falklands . We always have to be aware of the enemy within , which is much more difficult to fight and more dangerous to liberty . " After a year out on strike , in March 1985 , the NUM leadership conceded without a deal . The cost to the economy was estimated to be at least £ 1 @.@ 5 billion , and the strike was blamed for much of the pound 's fall against the US dollar . The government closed 25 unprofitable coal mines in 1985 , and by 1992 a total of 97 had been closed ; those that remained were privatised in 1994 . The eventual closure of 150 coal mines , not all of which were losing money , resulted in the loss of tens of thousands of jobs and devastated entire communities . Miners had helped bring down the Heath government , and Thatcher was determined to succeed where he had failed . Her strategy of preparing fuel stocks , appointing a union @-@ busting NCB leader in Ian MacGregor , and ensuring police were adequately trained and equipped with riot gear , contributed to her victory . 
 The number of stoppages across the UK peaked at 4 @,@ 583 in 1979 , when more than 29 million working days were lost . In 1984 , the year of the miners ' strike , there were 1 @,@ 221 , resulting in the loss of more than 27 million working days . <unk> then fell steadily throughout the rest of Thatcher 's premiership ; in 1990 there were 630 and fewer than 2 million working days lost , and they continued to fall thereafter . Thatcher 's time in office witnessed a sharp decline in trade union density , with the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union falling from 57 @.@ 3 % in 1979 to 49 @.@ 5 % in 1985 . In 1979 up until Thatcher 's last year in office , trade union membership also fell , from 13 @.@ 5 million in 1979 to fewer than 10 million . 
 = = = = Privatisation = = = = 
 The policy of privatisation has been called " a crucial ingredient of Thatcherism " . After the 1983 election the sale of state utilities accelerated ; more than £ 29 billion was raised from the sale of nationalised industries , and another £ 18 billion from the sale of council houses . 
 The process of privatisation , especially the preparation of nationalised industries for privatisation , was associated with marked improvements in performance , particularly in terms of labour productivity . 
 Some of the privatised industries , including gas , water , and electricity , were natural monopolies for which privatisation involved little increase in competition . The privatised industries that demonstrated improvement sometimes did so while still under state ownership . British Steel Corporation , for instance , made great gains in profitability while still a nationalised industry under the government @-@ appointed chairmanship of Ian MacGregor , who faced down trade @-@ union opposition to close plants and reduce the workforce by half . Regulation was also significantly expanded to compensate for the loss of direct government control , with the foundation of regulatory bodies such as <unk> , <unk> and the National Rivers Authority . There was no clear pattern to the degree of competition , regulation , and performance among the privatised industries ; in most cases privatisation benefited consumers in terms of lower prices and improved efficiency , but the results overall were " mixed " . 
 Thatcher always resisted rail privatisation and was said to have told Transport Secretary Nicholas Ridley " Railway privatisation will be the Waterloo of this government . Please never mention the railways to me again . " Shortly before her resignation , she accepted the arguments for privatising British Rail , which her successor John Major implemented in 1994 . The effect of privatising the railway is disputed , with large growth in passenger numbers and increasing efficiency matched by large public subsidy and concern about foreign companies running British railways . 
 The privatisation of public assets was combined with financial deregulation in an attempt to fuel economic growth . Geoffrey Howe abolished Britain 's exchange controls in 1979 , allowing more capital to be invested in foreign markets , and the Big Bang of 1986 removed many restrictions on the London Stock Exchange . The Thatcher government encouraged growth in the finance and service sectors to compensate for Britain 's ailing manufacturing industry . 
 = = = = Northern Ireland = = = = 
 In 1980 and 1981 , Provisional Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) and Irish National Liberation Army ( INLA ) prisoners in Northern Ireland 's Maze Prison carried out hunger strikes in an effort to regain the status of political prisoners that had been removed in 1976 by the preceding Labour government . 
 Bobby Sands began the 1981 strike , saying that he would fast until death unless prison inmates won concessions over their living conditions . Thatcher refused to countenance a return to political status for the prisoners , declaring " Crime is crime is crime ; it is not political " , but nevertheless the UK government privately contacted republican leaders in a bid to bring the hunger strikes to an end . After the deaths of Sands and nine others , the strike ended . Some rights were restored to paramilitary prisoners , but not official recognition of political status . Violence in Northern Ireland escalated significantly during the hunger strikes ; in 1982 Sinn Féin politician Danny Morrison described Thatcher as " the biggest bastard we have ever known " . 
 Thatcher narrowly escaped injury in an IRA assassination attempt at a Brighton hotel early in the morning on 12 October 1984 . Five people were killed , including the wife of Cabinet Minister John Wakeham . Thatcher was staying at the hotel to attend the Conservative Party Conference , which she insisted should open as scheduled the following day . She delivered her speech as planned , a move that was widely supported across the political spectrum and enhanced her popularity with the public . 
 On 6 November 1981 , Thatcher and Irish Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald had established the Anglo @-@ Irish Inter @-@ Governmental Council , a forum for meetings between the two governments . On 15 November 1985 , Thatcher and FitzGerald signed the Hillsborough Anglo @-@ Irish Agreement , the first time a British government had given the Republic of Ireland an advisory role in the governance of Northern Ireland . In protest the Ulster Says No movement attracted 100 @,@ 000 to a rally in Belfast , Ian Gow resigned as Minister of State in the HM Treasury , and all fifteen Unionist MPs resigned their parliamentary seats ; only one was not returned in the subsequent by @-@ elections on 23 January 1986 .

 Thatcher supported an active climate protection policy and was instrumental in the creation of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and in founding the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the British Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research in Exeter . Thatcher helped to put climate change , acid rain and general pollution in the British mainstream in the early 1980s . Her speeches included one to Royal Society on 27 September 1988 and to the UN general assembly in November 1989 . She did not visit the Earth Summit 1992 and later became sceptical about climate change policy . 
 = = = Foreign affairs = = = 
 Thatcher 's first foreign policy crisis came with the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . She condemned the invasion , said it showed the bankruptcy of a détente policy , and helped convince some British athletes to boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics . She gave weak support to American President Jimmy Carter who tried to punish the USSR with economic sanctions . Britain 's economic situation was precarious , and most of NATO was reluctant to cut trade ties . It was reported that her government secretly supplied Saddam Hussein with military equipment as early as 1981 . 
 Thatcher became closely aligned with the Cold War policies of United States President Ronald Reagan , based on their shared distrust of Communism , although she strongly opposed Reagan 's October 1983 invasion of Grenada . Reagan had assured Thatcher that an invasion was not contemplated , and thereafter Thatcher felt she could never fully trust Reagan again . During her first year as Prime Minister she supported NATO 's decision to deploy US nuclear cruise and Pershing II missiles in Western Europe and permitted the US to station more than 160 cruise missiles at RAF Greenham Common , starting on 14 November 1983 and triggering mass protests by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament . She bought the Trident nuclear missile submarine system from the US to replace Polaris , tripling the UK 's nuclear forces at an eventual cost of more than £ 12 billion ( at 1996 – 97 prices ) . Thatcher 's preference for defence ties with the US was demonstrated in the Westland affair of January 1986 , when she acted with colleagues to allow the struggling helicopter manufacturer Westland to refuse a takeover offer from the Italian firm Agusta in favour of the management 's preferred option , a link with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation . The UK Defence Secretary , Michael Heseltine , who had supported the Agusta deal , resigned in protest . 
 On 2 April 1982 the ruling military junta in Argentina ordered the invasion of the British @-@ controlled Falkland Islands and South Georgia , triggering the Falklands War . The subsequent crisis was " a defining moment of her [ Thatcher 's ] premiership " . At the suggestion of Harold Macmillan and Robert Armstrong , she set up and chaired a small War Cabinet ( formally called <unk> , Overseas and Defence committee , South Atlantic ) to take charge of the conduct of the war , which by 5 – 6 April had authorised and dispatched a naval task force to retake the islands . Argentina surrendered on 14 June and the operation was hailed a success , notwithstanding the deaths of 255 British servicemen and 3 Falkland Islanders . Argentinian deaths totalled 649 , half of them after the nuclear @-@ powered submarine HMS Conqueror torpedoed and sank the cruiser ARA General Belgrano on 2 May . Thatcher was criticised for the neglect of the Falklands ' defence that led to the war , and especially by Tam Dalyell in parliament for the decision to sink the General Belgrano , but overall she was considered a highly capable and committed war leader . The " Falklands factor " , an economic recovery beginning early in 1982 , and a bitterly divided opposition all contributed to Thatcher 's second election victory in 1983 . Thatcher often referred after the war to the " Falklands Spirit " ; Hastings and Jenkins ( 1983 ) suggested that this reflected her preference for the streamlined decision @-@ making of her War Cabinet over the painstaking deal @-@ making of peace @-@ time cabinet government . 
 In September 1982 she visited China to discuss with Deng Xiaoping the sovereignty of Hong Kong after 1997 . China was the first communist state Thatcher had visited and she was the first British prime minister to visit China . Throughout their meeting , she sought the PRC 's agreement to a continued British presence in the territory . Deng stated that the PRC 's sovereignty on Hong Kong was non @-@ negotiable , but he was willing to settle the sovereignty issue with Britain through formal negotiations , and both governments promised to maintain Hong Kong 's stability and prosperity . After the two @-@ year negotiations , Thatcher conceded to the PRC government and signed the Sino @-@ British Joint Declaration in Beijing in 1984 , agreeing to hand over Hong Kong 's sovereignty in 1997 . 
 Although saying that she was in favour of " peaceful negotiations " to end apartheid , Thatcher stood against the sanctions imposed on South Africa by the Commonwealth and the EC . She attempted to preserve trade with South Africa while persuading the government there to abandon apartheid . This included " [ c ] asting herself as President Botha 's candid friend " , and inviting him to visit the UK in June 1984 , in spite of the " inevitable demonstrations " against his government . Thatcher dismissed the African National Congress ( ANC ) in October 1987 as " a typical terrorist organisation " . 
 The Thatcher government supported the Khmer Rouge keeping their seat in the UN after they were ousted from power in Cambodia by the Cambodian – Vietnamese War . Although denying it at the time they also sent the SAS to train the non @-@ Communist members of the CGDK to fight against the Vietnamese @-@ backed People 's Republic of Kampuchea government . 
 Thatcher 's antipathy towards European integration became more pronounced during her premiership , particularly after her third election victory in 1987 . During a 1988 speech in Bruges she outlined her opposition to proposals from the European Community ( EC ) , forerunner of the European Union , for a federal structure and increased centralisation of decision making . Thatcher and her party had supported British membership of the EC in the 1975 national referendum , but she believed that the role of the organisation should be limited to ensuring free trade and effective competition , and feared that the EC 's approach was at odds with her views on smaller government and deregulation ; in 1988 , she remarked , " We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain , only to see them re @-@ imposed at a European level , with a European super @-@ state exercising a new dominance from Brussels " . 
 Thatcher was firmly opposed to the UK 's membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism , a precursor to European monetary union , believing that it would constrain the British economy , despite the urging of her Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson and Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe , but she was persuaded by John Major to join in October 1990 , at what proved to be too high a rate . 
 In April 1986 , Thatcher permitted US F @-@ 111s to use Royal Air Force bases for the bombing of Libya in retaliation for the alleged Libyan bombing of a Berlin discothèque , citing the right of self @-@ defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter . Polls suggested that fewer than one in three British citizens approved of Thatcher 's decision . She was in the US on a state visit when Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein invaded neighbouring Kuwait in August 1990 . During her talks with President George H. W. Bush , who had succeeded Reagan in 1989 , she recommended intervention , and put pressure on Bush to deploy troops in the Middle East to drive the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait . Bush was apprehensive about the plan , prompting Thatcher to remark to him during a telephone conversation that " This was no time to go wobbly ! " Thatcher 's government provided military forces to the international coalition in the build @-@ up to the Gulf War , but she had resigned by the time hostilities began on 17 January 1991 . 
 Thatcher was one of the first Western leaders to respond warmly to reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev . Following Reagan – Gorbachev summit meetings and reforms enacted by Gorbachev in the USSR , she declared in November 1988 that " We 're not in a Cold War now " , but rather in a " new relationship much wider than the Cold War ever was " . She went on a state visit to the Soviet Union in 1984 and met with Gorbachev and Nikolai Ryzhkov , the Chairman of the Council of Ministers . Thatcher was initially opposed to German reunification , telling Gorbachev that it " would lead to a change to postwar borders , and we cannot allow that because such a development would undermine the stability of the whole international situation and could endanger our security " . She expressed concern that a united Germany would align itself more closely with the Soviet Union and move away from NATO . 
 = = = Challenges to leadership and resignation = = = 
 Thatcher was challenged for the leadership of the Conservative Party by the little @-@ known backbench MP Sir Anthony Meyer in the 1989 leadership election . Of the 374 Conservative MPs eligible to vote , 314 voted for Thatcher and 33 for Meyer . Her supporters in the party viewed the result as a success , and rejected suggestions that there was discontent within the party . 
 During her premiership Thatcher had the second @-@ lowest average approval rating , at 40 % , of any post @-@ war Prime Minister . Polls consistently showed that she was less popular than her party . A self @-@ described conviction politician , Thatcher always insisted that she did not care about her poll ratings , pointing instead to her unbeaten election record . 
 Opinion polls in September 1990 reported that Labour had established a 14 % lead over the Conservatives , and by November the Conservatives had been trailing Labour for 18 months . These ratings , together with Thatcher 's combative personality and willingness to override colleagues ' opinions , contributed to discontent within the Conservative Party . 
 On 1 November 1990 , Geoffrey Howe the last remaining member of Thatcher 's original 1979 cabinet , resigned from his position as Deputy Prime Minister over her refusal to agree to a timetable for Britain to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism . In his resignation speech on 13 November , Howe commented on Thatcher 's European stance : " It is rather like sending your opening batsmen to the crease only for them to find the moment that the first balls are bowled that their bats have been broken before the game by the team captain . " His resignation was fatal to Thatcher 's premiership . 
 The next day , Michael Heseltine mounted a challenge for the leadership of the Conservative Party . Opinion polls had indicated that he would give the Conservatives a national lead over Labour . Although Thatcher won the first ballot with 204 : 152 votes and 16 abstentions , Heseltine had attracted sufficient support to force a second ballot . Under party rules , Thatcher not only needed to win a majority , but her margin over Heseltine had to be equivalent to 15 % of the 372 Conservative MPs in order to win the leadership election outright ; with 54 @.@ 8 % against 40 @.@ 9 % for Heseltine , she came up four votes short . Thatcher initially stated that she intended to " fight on and fight to win " the second ballot , but consultation with her Cabinet persuaded her to withdraw . After visiting the Queen , calling other world leaders , and making one final Commons speech , she left Downing Street in tears . She reportedly regarded her ousting as a betrayal . 
 Thatcher was replaced as Prime Minister and party leader by her Chancellor John Major , who prevailed over Heseltine in the subsequent ballots . Major oversaw an upturn in Conservative support in the 17 months leading up to the 1992 general election and led the Conservatives to their fourth successive victory on 9 April 1992 . Thatcher had favoured Major over Heseltine in the leadership contest , but her support for him weakened in later years .

 After leaving the House of Commons , Thatcher became the first former Prime Minister to set up a foundation ; the British wing of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation was dissolved in 2005 because of financial difficulties . She wrote two volumes of memoirs , The Downing Street Years ( 1993 ) and The Path to Power ( 1995 ) . In 1991 , she and her husband Denis moved to a house in Chester Square , a residential garden square in central London 's Belgravia district . 
 In 1992 , Thatcher was hired by the tobacco company Philip Morris as a " geopolitical consultant " for $ 250 @,@ 000 per year and an annual contribution of $ 250 @,@ 000 to her foundation . She also earned $ 50 @,@ 000 for each speech she delivered . 
 In August 1992 , Thatcher called for NATO to stop the Serbian assault on Goražde and Sarajevo to end ethnic cleansing during the Bosnian War . She compared the situation in Bosnia to " the worst excesses of the Nazis " , and warned that there could be a " holocaust " . She had been an advocate of Croatian and Slovenian independence . 
 In a 1991 interview for Croatian Radiotelevision , Thatcher had commented on the Yugoslav Wars ; she was critical of Western governments for not recognising the breakaway republics of Croatia and Slovenia as independent states and for not supplying them with arms after the Serbian @-@ led Yugoslav Army attacked . 
 She made a series of speeches in the Lords criticising the Maastricht Treaty , describing it as " a treaty too far " and stated " I could never have signed this treaty " . She cited A. V. Dicey when stating that as all three main parties were in favour of the treaty , the people should have their say in a referendum . 
 Thatcher was honorary Chancellor of the College of William & Mary in Virginia ( 1993 – 2000 ) and also of the University of Buckingham ( 1992 – 99 ) , the UK 's first private university , which she had opened in 1975 . 
 After Tony Blair 's election as Labour Party leader in 1994 , Thatcher praised Blair in an interview as " probably the most formidable Labour leader since Hugh Gaitskell . I see a lot of socialism behind their front bench , but not in Mr Blair . I think he genuinely has moved " . 
 In 1998 , Thatcher called for the release of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet when Spain had him arrested and sought to try him for human rights violations . She cited the help he gave Britain during the Falklands War . In 1999 , she visited him while he was under house arrest near London . Pinochet was released in March 2000 on medical grounds by the Home Secretary Jack Straw , without facing trial . 
 In the 2001 general election , Thatcher supported the Conservative general election campaign , as she had done in 1992 and 1997 , and in the Conservative leadership election shortly after , she supported Iain Duncan Smith over Kenneth Clarke . 
 In 2002 , Thatcher encouraged President George W. Bush to aggressively tackle the " unfinished business " of Saddam Hussein 's Iraq , and praised Tony Blair for his " strong , bold leadership " in standing with Bush in the Iraq War . 
 She broached the same subject in her Statecraft : Strategies for a Changing World , which was published that year and dedicated to Ronald Reagan , writing that there would be no peace in the Middle East until Saddam Hussein was toppled . Her book also said that Israel must trade land for peace , and that the European Union ( EU ) was " fundamentally <unk> " , " a classic utopian project , a monument to the vanity of intellectuals , a programme whose inevitable destiny is failure " . She argued that Britain should renegotiate its terms of membership or else leave the EU and join the North American Free Trade Area . 
 That same year , she suffered several small strokes and was advised by her doctors not to engage in further public speaking . On 23 March , she announced that on the advice of her doctors she would cancel all planned speaking engagements and accept no more .

 On 11 June 2004 , Thatcher , against doctor 's orders , attended the state funeral service for Ronald Reagan . She delivered her eulogy via videotape ; in view of her health , the message had been pre @-@ recorded several months earlier . Thatcher flew to California with the Reagan entourage , and attended the memorial service and interment ceremony for the president at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library . 
 Thatcher celebrated her 80th birthday at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Hyde Park , London , on 13 October 2005 ; guests included the Queen , the Duke of Edinburgh , Princess Alexandra and Tony Blair . Geoffrey Howe , by then Lord Howe of Aberavon , was also present , and said of his former leader : " Her real triumph was to have transformed not just one party but two , so that when Labour did eventually return , the great bulk of Thatcherism was accepted as irreversible . " 
 According to a later article in The Daily Telegraph , Thatcher 's daughter Carol first revealed that her mother had dementia in 2005 , saying that " Mum doesn 't read much any more because of her memory loss ... It 's pointless . She can 't remember the beginning of a sentence by the time she reaches the end . " She later recounted how she was first struck by her mother 's dementia when in conversation Thatcher confused the Falklands and Yugoslav conflicts ; she recalled the pain of needing to tell her mother repeatedly that Denis Thatcher was dead . 
 In 2006 , Thatcher attended the official Washington , D.C. memorial service to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the United States . She was a guest of Vice President Dick Cheney , and met Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during her visit . 
 In February 2007 , Thatcher became the first living British Prime Minister to be honoured with a statue in the Houses of Parliament . The bronze statue stands opposite that of her political hero , Sir Winston Churchill , and was unveiled on 21 February 2007 with Thatcher in attendance ; she made a brief speech in the members ' lobby of the House of Commons , responding : " I might have preferred iron — but bronze will do ... It won 't rust . " 
 She was a public supporter of the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism and the resulting Prague Process , and sent a public letter of support to its preceding conference . 
 After collapsing at a House of Lords dinner , Thatcher was admitted to St Thomas ' Hospital in central London on 7 March 2008 for tests . In 2009 she was hospitalised again when she fell and broke her arm . 
 Thatcher returned to 10 Downing Street in late November 2009 for the unveiling of an official portrait by artist Richard Stone , an unusual honour for a living ex @-@ Prime Minister . Stone had previously painted portraits of the Queen and the Queen Mother . 
 On 4 July 2011 , Thatcher was to attend a ceremony for the unveiling of a 10 @-@ foot statue to former American President Ronald Reagan , outside the American Embassy in London , but was unable to attend due to her frail health .

 Lady Thatcher died on 8 April 2013 at the age of 87 after suffering a stroke . She had been staying at a suite in the Ritz Hotel in London since December 2012 after having difficulty with stairs at her Chester Square home in Belgravia . 
 Reactions to the news of Thatcher 's death were mixed in the UK , ranging from tributes lauding her as Britain 's greatest @-@ ever peacetime Prime Minister to public celebrations of her death and expressions of personalised vitriol . 
 Details of Thatcher 's funeral had been agreed with her in advance . She received a ceremonial funeral , including full military honours , with a church service at St Paul 's Cathedral on 17 April . 
 Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , attended the funeral , the second time in the Queen 's reign that she had attended the funeral of a former prime minister ( the first being that of Winston Churchill in 1965 ) .

 Thatcherism represented a systematic , decisive rejection and reversal of the post @-@ war consensus , <unk> the major political parties largely agreed on the central themes of Keynesianism , the welfare state , nationalised industry , and close regulation of the economy . There was one major exception : the National Health Service , which was widely popular . She promised Britons in 1982 , the NHS is " safe in our hands . " 
 Thatcher defined her own political philosophy in a major and controversial break with One Nation Conservatives like her predecessor Edward Heath , in her statement to Douglas Keay , published in Woman 's Own magazine in September 1987 : 
 I think we have gone through a period when too many children and people have been given to understand " I have a problem , it is the Government 's job to cope with it ! " or " I have a problem , I will go and get a grant to cope with it ! " " I am homeless , the Government must house me ! " and so they are casting their problems on society and who is society ? There is no such thing ! There are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people look to themselves first . It is our duty to look after ourselves and then also to help look after our neighbour and life is a reciprocal business and people have got the entitlements too much in mind without the obligations . 
 The number of adults owning shares rose from 7 per cent to 25 per cent during her tenure , and more than a million families bought their council houses , giving an increase from 55 per cent to 67 per cent in owner @-@ occupiers from 1979 to 1990 . The houses were sold at a discount of 33 – 55 per cent , leading to large profits for some new owners . Personal wealth rose by 80 per cent in real terms during the 1980s , mainly due to rising house prices and increased earnings . Shares in the privatised utilities were sold below their market value to ensure quick and wide sales , rather than maximise national income . 
 Thatcher 's premiership was also marked by periods of high unemployment and social unrest , and many critics on the left of the political spectrum fault her economic policies for the unemployment level ; many of the areas affected by high unemployment as well as her monetarist economic policies remain blighted by social problems such as drug abuse and family breakdown . 
 Speaking in Scotland in April 2009 , before the 30th anniversary of her election as Prime Minister , Thatcher insisted she had no regrets and was right to introduce the poll tax , and to withdraw subsidies from " outdated industries , whose markets were in terminal decline " , subsidies that created " the culture of dependency , which had done such damage to Britain " . Political economist Susan Strange called the new financial growth model " casino capitalism " , reflecting her view that speculation and financial trading were becoming more important to the economy than industry . 
 Critics on the left describe her as " divisive " and claim she promoted greed and selfishness . Michael White , writing in the New Statesman in February 2009 , challenged the view that her reforms had brought a net benefit . Some critics contend that , despite being Britain 's first woman Prime Minister , Thatcher did " little to advance the political cause of women " , either within her party or the government , and some British feminists regarded her as " an enemy " . Her stance on immigration was perceived by some as part of a rising racist public discourse , which Professor Martin Barker called " new racism " . 
 Influenced at the outset by Keith Joseph , the term " Thatcherism " came to refer to her policies as well as aspects of her ethical outlook and personal style , including moral absolutism , nationalism , interest in the individual , and an uncompromising approach to achieving political goals . The nickname " Iron Lady " , originally given to her by the Soviets , became associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style . 
 Thatcher 's tenure of 11 years and 209 days as Prime Minister was the longest since Lord Salisbury ( 13 years and 252 days in three spells starting in 1885 ) , and the longest continuous period in office since Lord Liverpool ( 14 years and 305 days starting in 1812 ) . 
 She was voted the fourth @-@ greatest British Prime Minister of the 20th century in a poll of 139 academics organised by MORI , and in 2002 was ranked number 16 in the BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons . In 1999 , Time magazine named Thatcher one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century . 
 Thatcher 's death prompted mixed reactions , including reflections of criticism as well as praise . Groups celebrated her death in Brixton , Leeds , Bristol and Glasgow , and a crowd of 3 @,@ 000 gathered in Trafalgar Square to celebrate her demise and protest against her legacy . 
 Shortly after Thatcher 's death , Scotland 's First Minister , Alex Salmond , argued that her policies had the " unintended consequence " of encouraging Scottish devolution . Lord Foulkes agreed on Scotland Tonight that she had provided " the impetus " for devolution . 
 = = = Cultural depictions = = = 
 One of the earliest satires of Thatcher as Prime Minister involved Wells ( as writer / performer ) , Janet Brown ( voicing Thatcher ) and future Spitting Image producer John Lloyd , who in 1979 were teamed up by producer Martin Lewis for the satirical audio album The Iron Lady consisting of skits and songs satirising Thatcher 's rise to power . The album was released in September 1979 , four months after Thatcher became Premier . 
 Thatcher was the subject or the inspiration for 1980s protest songs . Billy Bragg and Paul Weller helped to form the Red Wedge collective to support Labour in opposition to Thatcher . 
 Thatcher was lampooned by satirist John Wells in several media . Wells collaborated with Richard Ingrams on the spoof " Dear Bill " letters which ran as a column in Private Eye magazine , were published in book form , and later became a West End stage revue named Anyone for Denis ? , with Wells in the role of Denis Thatcher . The revue was followed by a 1982 TV special , directed by Dick Clement , in which Thatcher was portrayed by Angela Thorne . Spitting Image , a British TV show , satirised Thatcher as a bully who ridiculed her own ministers . She was voiced by Steve <unk> . 
 Margaret Thatcher has been depicted in many television programmes , documentaries , films and plays . She was played by Patricia Hodge in Ian Curteis 's long unproduced The Falklands Play ( 2002 ) , and by Andrea Riseborough in the TV film The Long Walk to Finchley ( 2008 ) . She is the title character in two films , portrayed by Lindsay Duncan in Margaret ( 2009 ) and by Meryl Streep in The Iron Lady ( 2011 ) , in which she is depicted as suffering from dementia or Alzheimer 's disease .
