 The American rock band The Byrds released a recording of " My Back Pages " on February 6 , 1967 , as part of their fourth album , Younger Than Yesterday . The title of Younger Than Yesterday was itself directly inspired by the song 's refrain of " Ah , but I was so much older then / I 'm younger than that now . " " My Back Pages " was subsequently issued as a single by The Byrds on March 13 , 1967 , with the version included on the single being a radio edit that omitted the song 's second verse , in order to reduce the playing time from 3 : 08 to 2 : 31 . The single reached # 30 on the Billboard Hot 100 but failed to chart in the United Kingdom . " My Back Pages " was the last single by The Byrds to reach the Top 40 of the U.S. charts . 
 The song was initially suggested as a suitable vehicle for the band by their manager Jim Dickson . Lead guitarist Jim McGuinn felt that it would make an effective cover version , but David Crosby , the band 's rhythm guitarist , felt that covering another Dylan song was formulaic . The Byrds had already released a total of six Dylan covers on their first two albums , Mr. Tambourine Man and Turn ! Turn ! Turn ! , enjoying particular success with their recordings of " Mr. Tambourine Man " and " All I Really Want to Do " . In spite of Crosby 's objections , the band recorded " My Back Pages " between December 5 and December 8 , 1966 , during the recording sessions for their fourth album . Upon its release , this cover was received well by the critics and is today regarded as one of The Byrds ' strongest Dylan interpretations . Following its release on Younger Than Yesterday , the song would go on to become a staple of The Byrds ' live concert repertoire , until their final disbandment in 1973 . On December 4 , 1968 , a later line @-@ up of The Byrds re @-@ recorded an excerpt of " My Back Pages " as part of a medley that was included on their 1969 album , Dr. Byrds & Mr. Hyde . The song was also performed live by a reformed line @-@ up of The Byrds featuring Roger McGuinn , David Crosby , and Chris Hillman in January 1989 . 
 In addition to its appearance on the Younger Than Yesterday album , The Byrds ' original version of " My Back Pages " appears on several of the band 's compilations , including The Byrds ' Greatest Hits , History of The Byrds , The Byrds Play Dylan , The Original Singles : 1967 – 1969 , Volume 2 , The Byrds , The Very Best of The Byrds , The Essential Byrds , and There Is a Season . In 1996 , a previously unreleased alternate version of " My Back Pages " ( which had been considered for release as a single in 1967 ) was included as a bonus track on the Columbia / Legacy reissue of Younger Than Yesterday .

 The song has been covered by numerous artists , including The Ramones , Po ! , The Hollies , The Nice , Eric Johnson , The Box Tops , Carl <unk> , Jackson Browne & Joan Osborne , Marshall Crenshaw , Keith Jarrett , Steve Earle , La Mancha de Rolando , and the Scottish folksinger Dick Gaughan . Austrian singer @-@ songwriter Wolfgang Ambros recorded a version of the song named " Alt und Jung " ( " Old and Young " ) . In 1995 , the German rock musician Wolfgang <unk> recorded a German @-@ language ( <unk> language ) cover of the song with the title " Vill <unk> <unk> " for his album <unk> . In addition , a Japanese @-@ language cover by The <unk> Brothers is included in the soundtrack of the Dylan film Masked and Anonymous . 
 = Neuro : Supernatural Detective = 
 Neuro : Supernatural Detective , known in Japan as Majin Tantei Nōgami Neuro ( Japanese : <unk> <unk> , lit . " Demon Detective Neuro Nōgami " ) , is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yūsei Matsui . The series follows Neuro Nōgami , a demon who depends on mysteries for sustenance . Having consumed all the mysteries in the demon world , Neuro travels to the human world in search of more . There , Neuro recruits high school student Yako Katsuragi as a facade for a detective agency . The supernatural @-@ themed manga was created because Matsui considered himself unable to draw humans . 
 The manga was originally serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump from February 2005 to April 2009 . The individual chapters were collected and released in 23 tankōbon ( collected volumes ) by Shueisha . A 25 @-@ episode anime series directed by Hiroshi <unk> and animated by Madhouse was originally aired between 2007 and 2008 on Nippon Television . In 2011 , the anime series was licensed by Viz Media and uploaded to the company 's website . Neuro : Supernatural Detective has spawned a light novel , two audio albums , two video games , and other merchandise . 
 Neuro : Supernatural Detective 's manga has been popular in Japan , frequently ranking in the weekly Top Ten list of best @-@ selling manga . It has sold over four million volumes as of April 2009 in Japan . The anime , however , has been criticized by fans because it deviates from Matsui 's work , and received a low viewership . Critics of anime and manga often compared it to Case Closed , noting supernatural themes as the only difference between them . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The series ' central character is Neuro Nōgami ( <unk> <unk> , Nōgami Neuro ) , a demon who eats mysteries . Because he has eaten every mystery in the demon world , he comes to the human world to feast on the mysteries offered by humans . Because he is a demon , he does not want to make his presence in the human world widely known . He makes an arrangement with a 16 @-@ year @-@ old high school girl Yako Katsuragi ( <unk> <unk> , Katsuragi Yako ) — who wants to solve the mystery of her father 's murder , which was declared a suicide by the police . They establish a detective agency and , together with former criminal Shinobu Godai ( <unk> <unk> , Godai Shinobu ) and a sentient braid of hair called Akane ( <unk> , Akane @-@ chan ) , solve crimes to feed Neuro 's appetite .

 The title character of the series , Neuro is a demon detective from hell with a very arrogant , sadistic , and self @-@ centered personality . He came to the Human World to look for the Ultimate Mystery , which is " the most complex , the most unfathomable , and so , the most pleasing to the palate " . Upon arriving to the surface , he met Yako and forced her to become the front that Neuro needed to look for mysteries . While working on cases , Neuro usually makes use of his demonic powers and 777 Tools of the Demon World to find and defeat the culprit ( and sometimes to torture Yako , which he enjoys to do on a daily basis ) .

 Yako is a 16 @-@ year @-@ old high school girl and the very first character introduced in the manga . She meets Neuro when he appears and desecrates her father 's shrine while promising to help solve the mystery of her father 's death . This meeting quickly leads to a partnership : Yako becomes Neuro 's cover , pretending to be an investigator while Neuro acts as her assistant . Although at first it seems that Yako 's only purpose is to be there as a cover , she later proves herself worthy by being able to decipher the criminal 's motive by using her ability to understand human psychology , something that proves to be useful in certain cases , given how Neuro is unable to understand how humans " operate " . 
 Shinobu Godai ( <unk> , Godai Shinobu ) 
 Voiced by : Hiroyuki Yoshino 
 He is the jack of all trades for the detective 's office and is sometimes referred to as " Neuro 's second slave " .

However , he was forced to work for Neuro after the latter won the bet for the office by solving their boss 's death . In the manga , he was left to be until Neuro found a use for him , in which the demon then forcibly drags him back to the office , and is currently running an Information Company under Neuro 's supervision . 
 Akane ( <unk> , Akane ) 
 Akane is a corpse in the wall of the office Neuro took over , who is shown only as a detachable braid of hair , which functions like a hand . Neuro offered to make Yako brush and care for her in exchange for secretarial work . Akane can be taken from the office for short periods of time and can also merge with Yako 's hair to make it longer , which not only gives Akane control over Yako 's natural hair , but if left merged for too long , would make Akane and Yako switch places completely . Akane later appears attached to Yako 's new cell phone .

He usually takes a kind and cooperative attitude toward Yako , and is protective of her because of her resemblance to his little sister , but appears to be somewhat suspicious of Neuro . Sasazuka later watches as Neuro unleashes his 777 demon weapons and learns Neuro is a demon . He and Gouda share a mutual disliking but also understanding . Sasazuka has been searching his entire life for the person who killed his family , when he finds out that Sicks killed them , he goes after Sicks turning into a madman and killing everyone in his way .

 Before the series ' regular serialization in Weekly Shōnen Jump , Yūsei Matsui published two one @-@ shots . The first one was published in the summer issue of <unk> Jump ; it won the Jump Jūni <unk> <unk> Manga Award in the horror mystery category . After the first was " extremely well received " according to Shueisha , the second one @-@ shot was released on September 6 , 2004 , in issue 41 of Weekly Shōnen Jump . 
 Yūsei Matsui stated he was not good at drawing humans or real life things , and he was about to lose his self @-@ confidence when he " threw things in at random " to create the series . Matsui said he mixed his creation with real things to make his style original . To create the atmosphere of the series , Matsui used as reference paintings by Rei <unk> , a Japanese artist he saw on television , and <unk> Ishihara , the illustrator of Edogawa <unk> 's Shōnen Tantei Dan . Matsui 's creative process of art is to begin drawing erotic and grotesque images , and at the same time humorous and cute scenes . Matsui did not wish to create " terrifying characters " but " funny @-@ terrifying " and " terrifying @-@ cute " . He also tried to avoid men 's idealized image of heroines and women 's idealized images of heroes . He decided to create characters that could exist in the real world and to make their acts and reactions realistic . 
 Matsui did not want to create a detective 's reasoning manga because he does not like to read or draw it . He said that reasoning scenes are superfluous , so he placed some jokes in these scenes . Prior to the start of the series , he was not sure whether it would be a detective manga or a romantic one . He finally decided to write a detective story because he needed Neuro to be able to eat mysteries . During the creation of Neuro , Matsui followed a work schedule ; he worked on the sketches on Mondays and Tuesdays , and he began the outline on Tuesdays . On Wednesdays , with the help of his assistants he finalized the art , drawing the more complex backgrounds and leaving the rest in his assistants ' charge ; he talked with the editor about the next chapter on Thursdays and wrote the plot between Fridays and Sundays .

 The manga has sold 4 @.@ 4 million units in Japan as of April 2009 ; individual volumes frequently appeared on the lists of best @-@ selling manga there . Fans of the manga series responded negatively to its anime adaptation , criticizing the alterations made to the characterizations and stories . Japanese website New Akiba , hosted a petition intended to show fans ' dissatisfaction and to ask Madhouse and Nippon Television to be more faithful to the original work . Viz Media 's representative Amy Mar said the show is of low priority since it has not been among the most @-@ watched on <unk> . 
 Manga Sanctuary praised the protagonist for being original and unique . It criticized the fact that the reader does not have access to some facts that could help to solve the mysteries . The reviewer said it is unfortunate because the readers feels passive , which is not desirable in a crime series . However , Manga News said that this impassivity is good because it is what differentiates Neuro from Case Closed . Its design , setting , the " interesting and well @-@ constructed characters " , and the development of the relationship between Neuro and Yako which were also praised by the reviewer , who said the series is " completely apart in the world of manga , Neuro is a genre unto itself which is between several styles and therefore appeal to a wider audience . " <unk> 's critic also compared it to Case Closed , but said its black humor , cruel and deadpan laughs were " quite caustic . " 
 Anime News Network 's Carlo Santos said that the series walks " the line between serious sleuth drama and supernatural spell @-@ fest " , " balancing all that with the occasional joke " . He said the graphic violence is the best part of the series , praised the Madhouse animation and described it as " Case Closed with spirit powers " . Serdar Yegulalp from About.com said it has " [ a ] n interesting concept " , is " competent enough " , and " has a few fun twists " , but that apart from the supernatural elements it does not bring anything that has not already been done in Case Closed . Writing for Mania.com , Chris Beveridge said the anime operates principally around the two main characters ; he said that it is " more interesting to watch how Neuro and Yako operate , to understand methods and personalities , more than the actual event . And that weakens the episode because it never feels like we 're really drawn into the mystery itself . " Beveridge added it " has some good production values " , but criticized Neuro 's appearance , " which is bordering on comical " as it makes it difficult for the series " to go a darker route " .

 Croton Dam ( or Croton Hydroelectric Plant ) is an earth @-@ filled embankment dam and powerplant complex on the Muskegon River in Croton Township , Newaygo County , Michigan . It was built in 1907 under the direction of William D. Fargo by the Grand Rapids - Muskegon Power Company , a predecessor of Consumers Energy .

 The history of the Croton dam is intertwined with the history of William A. Foote ( 1854 – 1915 ) and James B.

Fargo , a Jackson @-@ based civil engineer who designed similar hydroelectric plants throughout the Midwest . 
 William A.

Fascinated by the potential , within a year he enlisted his then 17 @-@ year @-@ old brother James and moved to Jackson , Michigan , and in 1886 they jointly founded Jackson Electric Light Works ( a predecessor company to Consumers Energy ) , which began by lighting downtown Jackson electrically . The Foote brothers set up similar city specific companies in Battle Creek and Adrian within a few years . In many cases dams already built for grist mills , sawmills and the like were refit for electric generators , but in some cases , new dams were constructed . As the familiarity with the technology , and the technology itself , improved , the scope of projects became more ambitious .

Since transmission of electricity over long distances was not well understood , they were situated near the cities they served . But the demand for power was growing , driven by among other things , the advent of the streetcar and increased industrial use of electricity , outstripping the capacity of smaller rivers and existing dams . So larger rivers were sought . In 1898 the Foote brothers , working with engineering partner Fargo , constructed the Trowbridge Dam across the Kalamazoo River in order to supply the city of Kalamazoo . The dam was located near Allegan , about 25 miles ( 40 km ) away from the city , an unheard of distance at the time , and was the first major hydroelectric project in Western Michigan . Initially beset by power loss during transmission and other problems , the Trowbridge dam successfully provided power to a larger area than previous dams , after the Foote brothers advanced the state of the art in insulators and electric transmission equipment .

 Grand Rapids was a large power market to which the <unk> next turned their attention . Fargo advised the Foote brothers about possible hydropower locations on the Muskegon River , which has the second largest outflow of an inland ( non Great Lakes connecting ) river of Michigan after the Grand River ( which has a larger basin and the largest outflow of Michigan 's inland rivers ) . Unlike the Grand , the Muskegon is not navigable , so dams would not cause difficulty with river traffic . Through a subsidiary of their holding company , Commonwealth Power , the Grand Rapids – Muskegon Power Company , in 1904 they commissioned the construction of Rogers Dam and Croton Dam on the Muskegon , as well as Webber Dam on the Grand River . Rogers , upstream of the Croton , was finished first , in 1906 , but Croton , located where the Little Muskegon joins from the east , was a more ambitious project . One third of the village of Croton would be submerged by the impoundment lake as it began filling in August 1907 . <unk> D. Fargo was dispatched to oversee construction and served as the Chief Engineer . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 Fargo developed new methods for construction of earth embankment dams on foundations of soft soils , which made use of hydraulic sluicing . The dam was built during the summer , between 25 June and 3 September 1907 . The powerhouse and spillway sections of the dam were completed first , and used conventional contemporary engineering designs . 
 Fargo then built a pumping plant employing seven electric powered rotary pumps , to move river water up a 10 @-@ inch ( 250 mm ) pipeline to a bluff about 110 feet ( 34 m ) above the Muskegon River . A diameter reduction to 4 inches ( 100 mm ) increased the pressure to about 80 PSI , and the water was fed into nozzles via flexible rubber hoses . The high pressure streams of water carried away a soil water mix into iron troughs which routed the material about 800 feet ( 240 m ) at a slight downgrade back to the dam site . As the material was deposited it was layered , and the water allowed to drain off , compacting it . During this phase , the river was allowed to run through the powerhouse raceways and out the spillway . 
 The Croton Dam is one of the earliest examples of the use of this technique east of the Mississippi River . The chief advantage of the hydraulic sluicing method was its cost . The total cost of constructing the 370 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 110 m ) embankment , which contained 104 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 80 @,@ 000 m3 ) of material , was only $ 7 @,@ 076 , or about 7 cents per cubic yard of material moved . Fargo also used this method to construct a fill of 20 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 15 @,@ 000 m3 ) for a highway bridge crossing the Muskegon River immediately downstream from the dam . The fill Fargo built for the highway bridge approach cost roughly the same . 
 The Croton powerhouse has two adjoining asymmetrically connected buildings : the generator building on the west and the turbine building to the east arranged in an L shape . About 3 @,@ 000 oak timber pilings support a concrete foundation , with the perimeter walls supported on sheet steel pilings , which also prevent water from undercutting the foundation . The two buildings are about 60 feet ( 18 m ) in height , with Warren trusses supporting the roofs , and extend about 150 by 80 feet ( 46 by 24 m ) . 
 Two reinforced concrete retaining walls extend 40 feet ( 12 m ) upstream from the northeast and northwest corners of the generator building , forming a triangle and serve as an anchor for a floating trash boom which keeps refuse out of the turbine pits . A similar triangle is formed by two reinforced concrete retaining walls extending 50 feet ( 15 m ) downriver from the south side of the generator building . A concrete retaining wall extends an additional 140 feet ( 43 m ) south from the tip of this triangle . 
 When the generator building first went into operation , it housed two Westinghouse horizontal generators originally rated at 6 @,@ 600 volts , operating at 225 rpm and producing 3 phase 60 cycle AC . They were driven by turbines . The voltage was stepped up to 100 @,@ 000 volts using three delta @-@ connected oil @-@ cooled transformers of 3 @,@ 000 kilowatt capacity . These were regulated with oil switches , and the transformers and switch gear were housed in the south end of the generator building . 
 The Croton Dam and hydro plant were completed in 1907 , and a grand opening was held on September 7 , 1907 in the village ( named after Croton @-@ on @-@ Hudson , New York ) . Contemporary accounts report that " Grand Rapids Mayor George Ellis and a large contingent of city and business officials journeyed north to the village of Croton on a special train . After touring the big dam , they adjourned to a nearby field for a fine dinner , followed by cigars and a friendly baseball game . " 
 In order to achieve efficient power transmission over 50 miles ( 80 km ) to Grand Rapids , a 100 @,@ 000 @-@ volt high voltage line was built , then the highest @-@ voltage transmission line in the world . Dr. Charles Steinmetz , the " wizard " of General Electric , visited the site and conducted tests on the transmission lines in 1908 . The line voltage was increased to 110 @,@ 000 volts in early 1909 . 
 = = = Modifications = = = 
 A significant revamping and expansion of generating capacity was carried out in 1915 . Additional turbines and generators were added , blurring the distinction between the buildings . The generator building got pairs of Allis @-@ Chalmers <unk> horizontal turbines to drive the Westinghouse horizontal generators . Each pair of turbines is rated at 4 @,@ 000 horsepower when operated at 225 RPM with a hydraulic head of 39 feet ( 12 m ) . The operating voltage of the two original Westinghouse horizontal generators was raised to 7 @,@ 500 volts , with a corresponding increase in the line voltage from 110 @,@ 000 to 115 @,@ 000 volts . 
 The turbine building was modified to take more equipment , resulting in a rearrangement of the walls to enlarge it and addition of a gable to it , similar in appearance to that on the generator building . It has a much higher floor than the generator building and received a pair of vertical turbine / generator sets . 
 The transformers and switching equipment were removed from the generator building in 1930 , when a separate <unk> / substation went into service to the west of the spillway . Shortly thereafter , in 1931 , Croton and Rogers dams were joined by the Hardy Dam , situated between them . The Hardy was the last major hydroelectric project constructed in Michigan by Consumers Energy . Once completed , the 40 @-@ foot ( 12 m ) -high dam would later impound 7 @.@ 2 billion U.S. gallons ( 6 billion <unk> gal / 27 billion L ) of water in its 1 @,@ 209 @-@ acre ( 489 ha ) reservoir and is capable of producing <unk> kilowatts at peak outflow .

 A historical marker sign was placed at the Croton Dam , after its completion . It read : 
 The Grand Rapids - Muskegon Power Company ( a predecessor to today 's Consumers Energy Company ) built the Croton Hydroelectric Plant in 1906 - 1907 . The plant and its 110 @,@ 000 @-@ volt transmission line ( the highest voltage in use at that time ) attracted international attention . Curious spectators rode excursion trains to the site , were they received a tour of the dam and powerhouse , as well as a grand dinner . When the plant went into full service in September 1907 it represented the latest advances in electric power generation and transmission . Engineers from Russia , England , France , Italy , Japan , and India came to tour the plant when it opened . The facility is listed in the National Register of Historic Places . 
 The Croton Hydroelectric Plant was listed with the Michigan State Register and was awarded a Michigan Historical Marker ( site <unk> ) . The marker was replaced with a new one in 2005 . The site was then listed with the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 as structure ID # <unk> . 
 = = Impact and controversy = = 
 While Croton advanced the state of the art in hydroelectric engineering , it also submerged significant sections of scenic and fast @-@ flowing stretches of the Muskegon and Little Muskegon rivers . Some conservationists believe that Croton Dam and the other dams on the Muskegon divide the 219 @-@ mile ( 352 km ) long river into shorter , ecologically dysfunctional units . It blocks passage of fish from one river section to the next . It allegedly causes potentially harmful changes in water temperature and oxygen levels in a stretch of the river downstream of the dam , according to company data . 
 The dam was threatened by rainfall during the flood of September 1986 . The Croton and Hardy nearly failed during the peak of the flood , caused by a storm that dumped 14 inches ( 36 cm ) of rain on West Michigan in 48 hours . Consumers Energy officials stated that " had the Hardy Dam failed , the Croton Dam would have been washed away and every community from Croton to Muskegon would have been submerged under several feet of water " . 
 Subsequently , in 1989 , Michigan state fisheries director John Robertson characterized hydroelectric dams as " concrete and steel monsters " and suggested 11 Consumers Energy dams be removed from the Muskegon , Manistee and <unk> rivers . Local officials then gathered petition signatures from 14 @,@ 000 people who supported keeping the dams . The federal government has relicensed the dams through 2034 , but has required operating changes reducing their harmful effects on the Muskegon River . 
 = = Current status = = 
 The Croton Dam and hydroelectric plant is owned and operated by Consumers Energy , an electric power company headquartered in Jackson , Michigan . Croton generated 44 million kilowatt hours of electricity in 2006 , which would satisfy the annual electric consumption of about 6 @,@ 000 residential customers . 
 The three dams , Rogers , Hardy , and Croton ( all owned and operated by Consumers Energy ) , are operated in different modes but in concert give a net run of river effect on water flow . The Rogers itself has little or no impoundment and runs in run of river mode , passing through as much water as it receives . The Croton and Hardy work in concert . The Hardy , which has a larger capacity reservoir , larger turbines , and is upstream of the Croton , runs in full peaking mode , meaning that the river flow is impounded and used to generate electricity during peak demand periods . This causes wide fluctuations in water flows and reservoir levels , typically with low outflow during the night when power demand is lowest . Full peaking was once very common but because of the outflow fluctuations , is now less common . However , with the Croton immediately downstream , and with no river segment ( the Croton impoundment stretches back to the Hardy outlet ) , it can be run in re @-@ regulation mode , allowing a natural flow rate to exit . The Croton reservoir level fluctuates inversely with the Hardy , rising during the day and lowering at night . Since the Hardy reservoir is so large , its reservoir level fluctuates about 4 inches ( 10 cm ) in total , while the Croton reservoir fluctuates about 9 inches ( 23 cm ) . During the winter and spring runoff , the Hardy is allowed to fluctuate much more . It can be drawn down up to 12 feet ( 4 m ) to meet winter power demand but is required to return to normal levels by the end of April each spring . 
 Together , the three dams ( Rogers , Hardy and Croton ) can generate about 45 @,@ 500 kilowatts , with about 30 @,@ 000 of that from the Hardy . 
 = Malta @-@ class aircraft carrier = 
 The Malta @-@ class aircraft carrier was a British large aircraft carrier design of World War II . Four ships were ordered in 1943 for the Royal Navy , but changing tactical concepts , based on American experience in the Pacific War , caused repeated changes to the design , which was not completed before the end of the war . All four ships were cancelled in 1945 before they were laid down . 
 = = Background = = 
 In July 1942 the Royal Navy formed the Future Building Committee , chaired by the Deputy First Sea Lord , to examine the fleet 's requirements for the rest of the war . Tasked with anticipating the Navy 's readiness and requirements for January 1944 , the committee realised that a major expansion of naval aviation was required , which meant that more aircraft carriers would be needed . Many factors combined to drive up the size of these new carriers , notably the increasing size and speed of aircraft and the desire to increase the numbers of aircraft aboard fleet carriers . Another important consideration was the change in carrier tactics from the earlier doctrine of more attacks with smaller numbers of aircraft to the use of large , single airstrikes . 
 Sir Stanley V. Goodall , Director of Naval Construction ( DNC ) , proposed a variety of designs , both open and closed hangar . On 8 October 1943 , the Board of Admiralty selected a closed @-@ hangar design with an armoured flight deck and five propeller shafts . Reports of American operations in the Pacific convinced the Board to reconsider hangar design ; American experience had shown that the ability to fly off all of a carrier 's aircraft in a single airstrike was vital . That required a well @-@ ventilated , open @-@ hangar design , which would reduce the time required to launch the aircraft by allowing them to begin the typical 15 @-@ minute engine warm @-@ up while still in the hangar . On 15 May 1944 , the Board reversed itself and ordered the DNC to produce an open @-@ hangar design with deck @-@ edge lifts . An unarmoured flight deck was agreed upon in June by the Controller of the Navy and the Fifth Sea Lord . 
 The new design , 900 feet ( 274 @.@ 3 m ) long at the waterline and known as Design X , was submitted to the Board on 10 August , although it was not approved . In October , concerns arose over the size of Design X in that it might have problems manoeuvering in constricted harbours , and the DNC was asked for two smaller designs : X1 , 50 feet ( 15 @.@ 2 m ) shorter , and Y , 150 feet ( 45 @.@ 7 m ) shorter . Design Y was too short for efficient operations with the larger aircraft the committee anticipated , and the First Sea Lord selected X1 . It was submitted to the Board on 12 April 1945 and fully worked out in anticipation of approval that never came . The Board minutes for 31 August noted that further consideration of the design had been postponed . 
 = = Description = = 
 Had the X1 design received final approval , the Malta class would have been about the same size as the American Midway @-@ class aircraft carriers at 897 feet ( 273 @.@ 4 m ) in length overall and 850 feet ( 259 @.@ 1 m ) at the waterline . The beam would have been 115 feet 6 inches ( 35 @.@ 2 m ) at the waterline and they would have had a draught of 35 feet ( 10 @.@ 7 m ) at deep load . The ships would have displaced 46 @,@ 890 long tons ( 47 @,@ 640 t ) at standard load and 57 @,@ 700 long tons ( 58 @,@ 600 t ) at deep load . Their metacentric heights were estimated to be 8 @.@ 42 feet ( 2 @.@ 6 m ) at standard load and 12 @.@ 8 feet ( 3 @.@ 9 m ) at deep load . Their complement was expected to consist of 3 @,@ 520 officers and enlisted men . 
 The 888 @-@ foot ( 270 @.@ 7 m ) flight deck had a maximum width of 121 feet 9 inches ( 37 @.@ 1 m ) . Because the unarmoured flight deck required an expansion joint about amidships , the <unk> ' island could not be a single structure and was split into two , each section with its own funnel . This allowed turbulence around the islands to be reduced and provided more space for radars and fire @-@ control directors . The carriers would have been fitted with 16 arrestor cables that were designed to stop landing aircraft up to 20 @,@ 000 pounds ( 9 @,@ 100 kg ) in weight , at speeds of up to 75 knots ( 139 km / h ; 86 mph ) . They would have been backed up by three crash barricades to prevent landing aircraft from crashing into aircraft parked on the ship 's bow . Positioned on the forward part of the flight deck , two newly designed hydraulic aircraft catapults were intended to launch fully laden aircraft at 130 knots ( 240 km / h ; 150 mph ) . The ships were designed with four 30 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 14 @,@ 000 kg ) lifts ( two on the centreline ( 45 by 46 feet ( 13 @.@ 7 by 14 @.@ 0 m ) , and two on the portside deck edge ( 54 by 36 feet ( 16 @.@ 5 by 11 @.@ 0 m ) ) to facilitate the rapid movement of aircraft between the flight deck and the hangar . This was 440 feet ( 134 @.@ 1 m ) long , with a maximum width of 90 feet ( 27 @.@ 4 m ) , and 17 feet 6 inches ( 5 @.@ 3 m ) high to accommodate American aircraft designed for that height . In case of fire the hangar was intended to be divided by four sliding steel doors . Between the hangar spaces and the deck park , the Malta class would have been capable of accommodating between 80 and 108 aircraft . For these aircraft , the ships would have been provided with 190 @,@ 000 imperial gallons ( 860 @,@ 000 l ; 230 @,@ 000 US gal ) of aviation gasoline . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The ships would have used four Parsons double @-@ reduction geared steam turbines , each driving one shaft , using steam supplied by eight Admiralty 3 @-@ drum boilers . The boilers were distributed between four boiler compartments , but all four turbines were in a single compartment , well aft . The turbines were designed to produce a total of 200 @,@ 000 shp ( 150 @,@ 000 kW ) , enough to give them a maximum speed of 33 @.@ 25 knots ( 61 @.@ 58 km / h ; 38 @.@ 26 mph ) . The Malta class was designed to carry a maximum of 7 @,@ 000 long tons ( 7 @,@ 100 t ) of fuel oil and diesel fuel ( for the emergency generators ) ; this was intended to give the ships a range of 7 @,@ 100 nautical miles ( 13 @,@ 100 km ; 8 @,@ 200 mi ) at 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) or 5 @,@ 600 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 400 km ; 6 @,@ 400 mi ) at 24 knots ( 44 km / h ; 28 mph ) .

 The ships ' main armament was intended to be sixteen quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 110 mm ) dual @-@ purpose guns in eight powered RP 41 Mk VII twin @-@ gun turrets , four on each side of the hull . The gun had a maximum range of 20 @,@ 760 yards ( 18 @,@ 980 m ) at an elevation of + 45 ° and a ceiling of 41 @,@ 000 feet ( 12 @,@ 000 m ) . The light anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) armament would have consisted of 55 40 mm Bofors AA guns in eight sextuple stabilised , powered RP 50 Mk VI mounts and seven single mounts of an unknown type . The Bofors gun had a maximum range of 10 @,@ 750 yards ( 9 @,@ 830 m ) and a ceiling of 23 @,@ 500 feet ( 7 @,@ 200 m ) .

 An August 1944 study anticipated that the ships would carry four early warning radars , including height @-@ finders , four surface search radars and eight gunnery / fire @-@ control radars . Historian David Hobbs wrote that they would mount Type 960 early warning , Type 982 intercept , Type 983 height @-@ finding and Type <unk> target indication radars . In addition a number of gunnery radars would also be needed .

 The four inches ( 102 mm ) hangar @-@ deck armour of Design X1 was a reduction from the six @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) called for in the original X configuration . The waterline armour belt was also four inches thick , but only covered the central portion of the ship to form the armoured citadel . The belt was closed by three @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) transverse bulkheads fore and aft . One and a half inches ( 38 mm ) of armour extended 40 feet ( 12 @.@ 2 m ) forward and 60 feet ( 18 @.@ 3 m ) aft of the belt to protect the waterline against splinter damage . 
 The underwater defense system was a layered system of liquid- and air @-@ filled compartments , backed by an inclined holding bulkhead that was four inches thick at the top and tapered to a thickness of two inches ( 51 mm ) at the bottom , and was estimated to resist a 1 @,@ 200 @-@ pound ( 540 kg ) explosive charge . An earlier version , however , had been estimated to be able to resist a 2 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 910 kg ) charge , but failed against a 1 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 450 kg ) charge in a full @-@ scale test . 
 The magazines for the 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns and the steering gear both lay outside the armoured citadel and had their own armour .

 Well before the design was finalised , four ships were ordered in July 1943 .

Malta , New Zealand and Gibraltar were all ordered three days later . New Zealand was originally ordered from Cammell Laird , but the contract was transferred to Harland and Wolff on 22 July 1944 . The Admiralty ordered Vickers not to order any more material on 27 April 1944 and given that final drawings were never issued to the builders , it is unlikely that any of them actually did more than preliminary work . None of the ships were ever laid down and all of them were cancelled before the end of 1945 .

 The French destroyer Lynx was a Chacal @-@ class destroyer ( contre @-@ torpilleur ) built for the French Navy during the 1920s . The Chacals were regarded as obsolete by 1935 and Lynx became a training ship for the torpedo school at Toulon that year . She was assigned convoy escort duties in the Atlantic after the start of World War II in September 1939 . In July 1940 , the ship was present when the British attacked the French ships at Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir , but managed to escape without damage . After she reached Toulon , Lynx was placed in reserve where she remained for the next two years . On 27 November 1942 , she was scuttled at Toulon when the Germans attempted to capture the French ships there . Her wreck was salvaged in 1944 , but she was not broken up until 1948 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Chacal @-@ class ships were designed to counter the large Italian Leone @-@ class destroyers . They had an overall length of 126 @.@ 8 meters ( 416 ft 0 in ) , a beam of 11 @.@ 1 meters ( 36 ft 5 in ) , and a draft of 4 @.@ 1 meters ( 13 ft 5 in ) . The ships displaced 2 @,@ 126 metric tons ( 2 @,@ 092 long tons ) at standard and 2 @,@ 980 – 3 @,@ 075 metric tons ( 2 @,@ 933 – 3 @,@ 026 long tons ) at deep load . They were powered by two geared steam turbines , each driving one propeller shaft , using steam provided by five du Temple boilers . The turbines were designed to produce 50 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 37 @,@ 000 kW ; 49 @,@ 000 shp ) , which would propel the ship at 35 @.@ 5 knots ( 65 @.@ 7 km / h ; 40 @.@ 9 mph ) . During her sea trials on 20 April 1927 , Lynx 's turbines provided 57 @,@ 810 metric horsepower ( 42 @,@ 520 kW ; 57 @,@ 020 shp ) and she reached 35 @.@ 54 knots ( 65 @.@ 82 km / h ; 40 @.@ 90 mph ) for a single hour . The ships carried 530 metric tons ( 522 long tons ) of fuel oil which gave them a range of 3 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 600 km ; 3 @,@ 500 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . Their crew consisted of 10 officers and 187 crewmen in peacetime and 12 officers and 209 enlisted men in wartime . 
 The main armament of the Chacal @-@ class ships consisted of five Canon de 130 mm modèle 1919 guns in single mounts , one superfiring pair fore and aft of the superstructure and the fifth gun abaft the aft funnel . The guns were numbered ' 1' to ' 5' from front to rear . Their anti @-@ aircraft armament consisted of two Canon de 75 mm modèle 1924 guns in single mounts positioned amidships . The ships carried two above @-@ water triple sets of 550 @-@ millimeter ( 21 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes . A pair of depth charge chutes were built into their stern ; these housed a total of twenty 200 @-@ kilogram ( 440 lb ) depth charges . They were also fitted with four depth @-@ charge throwers for which they carried a dozen 100 @-@ kilogram ( 220 lb ) depth charges .

 Lynx , named after the eponymous feline , was ordered on 26 February 1923 from Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire . She was laid down at their Saint @-@ Nazaire shipyard on 14 January 1924 , launched on 25 February 1925 , completed on 18 October 1927 and entered service on 15 November . Completion was delayed by problems with her propulsion machinery and late deliveries by sub @-@ contractors . The ship was assigned to the 4th Light Division ( DL ) ( 4e division légère ) of the 2nd Squadron ( 2e Escadre ) based at Brest upon completion , together with her sister ships Léopard and Jaguar . On 3 July 1928 , Lynx participated in a naval review by Gaston Doumergue , President of France , off Le Havre . The four depth charge throwers were removed in 1932 . The next year , the ship was present when the fleet was reviewed by the new President of France , Albert Lebrun , in Cherbourg on 20 July 1933 . About two years later , the 75 @-@ millimeter guns were replaced by four twin mounts for 13 @.@ 2 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 5 in ) anti @-@ aircraft machineguns . The ship was assigned to the 11th DL of the Torpedo Training School ( Ecole d 'application du lancement à la mer ) at Toulon in 1935 as the Chacals were regarded as obsolete . 
 When the war started in September 1939 , Lynx belonged to the 4th Large Destroyer Division ( 4e division de contre @-@ torpilleurs ) with her sisters Panthère and Tigre . She was assigned to the Western Command ( Forces maritimes de l 'Ouest ) for convoy escort duties from October to May 1940 where she guarded convoys traveling between Gibraltar and Brest as well as Casablanca , French Morocco , and Le Verdon @-@ sur @-@ Mer . In January 1940 , the ship had a British Type 123 ASDIC installed ; several months later Lynx had two depth @-@ charge throwers reinstalled , No. 3 gun removed , and her depth charge stowage reduced to a dozen 200 kg and eight 100 kg depth charges to improve her stability . She was transferred to Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir , French Algeria , on 27 May and she was still there on 25 June after France surrendered . The ship managed to escape the harbor during the British attack on Mers @-@ el @-@ Kébir on 3 July and together with her sister Tigre briefly engaged the destroyer HMS Wrestler . The sisters then depth charged the submarine HMS Proteus as the French ships headed for Toulon , where they arrived the following day . As the oldest contre @-@ torpilleurs in French service , Lynx and her sisters were reduced to reserve and stripped of their light anti @-@ aircraft armament . On 27 November 1942 , Lynx was scuttled at Toulon with the rest of the French fleet to prevent her capture by the Germans . She was refloated on 23 January 1944 and beached at the adjacent port of <unk> . The wreck was raised in 1948 and broken up . 
 = Shark = 
 Sharks are a group of fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton , five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head , and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head . Modern sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha ( or <unk> ) and are the sister group to the rays . However , the term " shark " has also been used for extinct members of the subclass Elasmobranchii outside the Selachimorpha , such as Cladoselache and <unk> , as well as other Chondrichthyes such as the <unk> <unk> . Under this broader definition , the earliest known sharks date back to more than 420 million years ago . <unk> are often referred to as " spiny sharks " ; though they are not part of Chondrichthyes proper , they are a paraphyletic assemblage leading to cartilaginous fish as a whole . 
 Since then , sharks have diversified into over 500 species . They range in size from the small dwarf lanternshark ( Etmopterus perryi ) , a deep sea species of only 17 centimetres ( 6 @.@ 7 in ) in length , to the whale shark ( Rhincodon typus ) , the largest fish in the world , which reaches approximately 12 metres ( 40 ft ) in length . Sharks are found in all seas and are common to depths of 2 @,@ 000 metres ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) . They generally do not live in freshwater although there are a few known exceptions , such as the bull shark and the river shark , which can survive and be found in both seawater and freshwater . Sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics . They have numerous sets of replaceable teeth . 
 Well @-@ known species such as the great white shark , tiger shark , blue shark , mako shark , and the hammerhead shark are apex predators — organisms at the top of their underwater food chain . Many shark populations are threatened by human activities . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Until the 16th century , sharks were known to mariners as " sea dogs " . The etymology of the word " shark " is uncertain . One ( now largely disproved ) theory is that it derives from the Yucatec Maya word <unk> , pronounced ' <unk> ' . Evidence for this etymology came from the Oxford English Dictionary , which notes shark first came into use after Sir John Hawkins ' sailors exhibited one in London in 1569 and posted " <unk> " to refer to the large sharks of the Caribbean Sea . However , the Middle English Dictionary records an isolated occurrence of the word shark ( referring to a sea fish ) in a letter written by Thomas Beckington in 1442 , which rules out a New World etymology . 
 Another etymology states that the original sense of the word was that of " predator , one who preys on others " from the Dutch <unk> , meaning " villain , scoundrel " ( cf. card shark , loan shark , etc . ) , which was later applied to the fish due to its predatory behaviour . 
 = = Evolution = = 
 Evidence for the existence of sharks dates from the Ordovician period , 450 – 420 million years ago , before land vertebrates existed and before many plants had colonized the continents . Only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks , suspecting that these scales are actually those of <unk> <unk> . The oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago , in the Silurian period . The first sharks looked very different from modern sharks . The majority of modern sharks can be traced back to around 100 million years ago . Most fossils are of teeth , often in large numbers . Partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered . Estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime , which explains the abundant fossils . The teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate , an apatite . When a shark dies , the decomposing skeleton breaks up , scattering the apatite prisms . Preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments . 
 Among the most ancient and primitive sharks is Cladoselache , from about 370 million years ago , which has been found within Paleozoic strata in Ohio , Kentucky , and Tennessee . At that point in Earth 's history these rocks made up the soft bottom sediments of a large , shallow ocean , which stretched across much of North America . Cladoselache was only about 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) long with stiff triangular fins and slender jaws . Its teeth had several pointed cusps , which wore down from use . From the small number of teeth found together , it is most likely that Cladoselache did not replace its teeth as regularly as modern sharks . Its caudal fins had a similar shape to the great white sharks and the pelagic shortfin and longfin makos . The presence of whole fish arranged tail @-@ first in their stomachs suggest that they were fast swimmers with great agility . 
 Most fossil sharks from about 300 to 150 million years ago can be assigned to one of two groups . The <unk> was almost exclusive to freshwater environments . By the time this group became extinct about 220 million years ago , they had spread worldwide . The other group , the <unk> , appeared about 320 million years ago and lived mostly in the oceans , but also in freshwater . The results of a 2014 study of the gill structure of an unusually well @-@ preserved 325 million year old fossil suggested that sharks are not " living fossils " , but rather have evolved more extensively than previously thought over the hundreds of millions of years they have been around . 
 Modern sharks began to appear about 100 million years ago . Fossil mackerel shark teeth date to the Early Cretaceous . One of the most recently evolved families is the hammerhead shark ( family Sphyrnidae ) , which emerged in the Eocene . The oldest white shark teeth date from 60 to 66 million years ago , around the time of the extinction of the dinosaurs . In early white shark evolution there are at least two lineages : one lineage is of white sharks with coarsely serrated teeth and it probably gave rise to the modern great white shark , and another lineage is of white sharks with finely serrated teeth . These sharks attained gigantic proportions and include the extinct <unk> shark , C. megalodon . Like most extinct sharks , C. megalodon is also primarily known from its fossil teeth and vertebrae . This giant shark reached a total length ( TL ) of more than 16 metres ( 52 ft ) . C. megalodon may have approached a maxima of 20 @.@ 3 metres ( 67 ft ) in total length and 103 metric tons ( 114 short tons ) in mass . Paleontological evidence suggests that this shark was an active predator of large cetaceans . 
 = = = Taxonomy = = = 
 Sharks belong to the superorder Selachimorpha in the subclass Elasmobranchii in the class Chondrichthyes . The Elasmobranchii also include rays and skates ; the Chondrichthyes also include Chimaeras . It is currently thought that the sharks form a polyphyletic group : some sharks are more closely related to rays than they are to some other sharks . 
 The superorder Selachimorpha is divided into Galea ( or <unk> ) , and <unk> ( or <unk> ) . The <unk> are the <unk> , <unk> , Lamniformes , and Carcharhiniformes . <unk> and <unk> are usually placed in one clade , but recent studies show the <unk> and <unk> are a clade . Some scientists now think that <unk> may be <unk> . The <unk> are divided into <unk> and <unk> . The <unk> includes the Hexanchiformes and <unk> . The <unk> contains the Squaliformes and the <unk> . The <unk> may be invalid . It includes the <unk> , and the <unk> , which may also be invalid , but includes the <unk> and the <unk> . 
 There are more than 470 species of sharks split across thirteen orders , including four orders of sharks that have gone extinct : 
 Carcharhiniformes : Commonly known as ground sharks , the order includes the blue , tiger , bull , grey reef , blacktip reef , Caribbean reef , blacktail reef , whitetip reef , and oceanic whitetip sharks ( collectively called the requiem sharks ) along with the houndsharks , catsharks , and hammerhead sharks . They are distinguished by an elongated snout and a nictitating membrane which protects the eyes during an attack . 
 <unk> : They are generally referred to as the bullhead or horn sharks . 
 Hexanchiformes : Examples from this group include the cow sharks and frilled sharks , which somewhat resembles a marine snake . 
 Lamniformes : They are commonly known as the mackerel sharks . They include the goblin shark , basking shark , megamouth shark , the thresher sharks , shortfin and longfin mako sharks , and great white shark . They are distinguished by their large jaws and ovoviviparous reproduction . The Lamniformes also include the extinct megalodon , Carcharodon megalodon . 
 <unk> : They are commonly referred to as the carpet sharks , including zebra sharks , nurse sharks , wobbegongs , and the whale shark . 
 <unk> : These are the sawsharks , with an elongated , toothed snout that they use for slashing their prey . 
 Squaliformes : This group includes the dogfish sharks and <unk> . 
 <unk> : Also known as angel sharks , they are flattened sharks with a strong resemblance to stingrays and skates .

 = = Anatomy = = 
 = = = Teeth = = = 
 Shark teeth are embedded in the gums rather than directly affixed to the jaw , and are constantly replaced throughout life . Multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove on the inside of the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt ; some sharks lose 30 @,@ 000 or more teeth in their lifetime . The rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months . In most species , teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row , which is observed in the cookiecutter shark . 
 Tooth shape depends on the shark 's diet : those that feed on mollusks and crustaceans have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing , those that feed on fish have needle @-@ like teeth for gripping , and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting . The teeth of plankton @-@ feeders such as the basking shark are small and non @-@ functional . 
 = = = Skeleton = = = 
 Shark skeletons are very different from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates . Sharks and other cartilaginous fish ( skates and rays ) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue . <unk> is flexible and durable , yet is about half the normal density of bone . This reduces the skeleton 's weight , saving energy . Because sharks do not have rib cages , they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land . 
 = = = Jaw = = = 
 Jaws of sharks , like those of rays and skates , are not attached to the cranium . The jaw 's surface ( in comparison to the shark 's vertebrae and gill arches ) needs extra support due to its heavy exposure to physical stress and its need for strength . It has a layer of tiny hexagonal plates called " tesserae " , which are crystal blocks of calcium salts arranged as a mosaic . This gives these areas much of the same strength found in the bony tissue found in other animals . 
 Generally sharks have only one layer of tesserae , but the jaws of large specimens , such as the bull shark , tiger shark , and the great white shark , have two to three layers or more , depending on body size . The jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers . In the rostrum ( snout ) , the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts . 
 = = = Fins = = = 
 Fin skeletons are elongated and supported with soft and unsegmented rays named <unk> , filaments of elastic protein resembling the horny keratin in hair and feathers . Most sharks have eight fins . Sharks can only drift away from objects directly in front of them because their fins do not allow them to move in the tail @-@ first direction . 
 = = = Dermal denticles = = = 
 Unlike bony fish , sharks have a complex dermal corset made of flexible collagenous fibers and arranged as a helical network surrounding their body . This works as an outer skeleton , providing attachment for their swimming muscles and thus saving energy . Their dermal teeth give them hydrodynamic advantages as they reduce turbulence when swimming . 
 = = = Tails = = = 
 Tails provide thrust , making speed and acceleration dependent on tail shape . Caudal fin shapes vary considerably between shark species , due to their evolution in separate environments . Sharks possess a heterocercal caudal fin in which the dorsal portion is usually noticeably larger than the ventral portion . This is because the shark 's vertebral column extends into that dorsal portion , providing a greater surface area for muscle attachment . This allows more efficient locomotion among these negatively buoyant cartilaginous fish . By contrast , most bony fish possess a <unk> caudal fin . 
 Tiger sharks have a large upper lobe , which allows for slow cruising and sudden bursts of speed . The tiger shark must be able to twist and turn in the water easily when hunting to support its varied diet , whereas the porbeagle shark , which hunts schooling fish such as mackerel and herring , has a large lower lobe to help it keep pace with its fast @-@ swimming prey . Other tail adaptations help sharks catch prey more directly , such as the thresher shark 's usage of its powerful , elongated upper lobe to stun fish and squid . 
 = = Physiology = = 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Unlike bony fish , sharks do not have gas @-@ filled swim bladders for buoyancy . Instead , sharks rely on a large liver filled with oil that contains squalene , and their cartilage , which is about half the normal density of bone . Their liver constitutes up to 30 % of their total body mass . The liver 's effectiveness is limited , so sharks employ dynamic lift to maintain depth while swimming . Sand tiger sharks store air in their stomachs , using it as a form of swim bladder . Bottom @-@ dwelling sharks , like the nurse shark , have negative buoyancy , allowing them to rest on the ocean floor . 
 Some sharks , if inverted or stroked on the nose , enter a natural state of tonic immobility . Researchers use this condition to handle sharks safely . 
 = = = Respiration = = = 
 Like other fish , sharks extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their gills . Unlike other fish , shark gill slits are not covered , but lie in a row behind the head . A modified slit called a spiracle lies just behind the eye , which assists the shark with taking in water during respiration and plays a major role in bottom – dwelling sharks . Spiracles are reduced or missing in active pelagic sharks . While the shark is moving , water passes through the mouth and over the gills in a process known as " ram ventilation " . While at rest , most sharks pump water over their gills to ensure a constant supply of oxygenated water . A small number of species have lost the ability to pump water through their gills and must swim without rest . These species are obligate ram ventilators and would presumably asphyxiate if unable to move . Obligate ram ventilation is also true of some pelagic bony fish species . 
 The respiration and circulation process begins when deoxygenated blood travels to the shark 's two @-@ chambered heart . Here the shark pumps blood to its gills via the ventral aorta artery where it branches into afferent brachial arteries . <unk> takes place in the gills and the <unk> blood flows into the efferent brachial arteries , which come together to form the dorsal aorta . The blood flows from the dorsal aorta throughout the body . The deoxygenated blood from the body then flows through the posterior cardinal veins and enters the posterior cardinal sinuses . From there blood enters the heart ventricle and the cycle repeats . 
 = = = Thermoregulation = = = 
 Most sharks are " cold @-@ blooded " or , more precisely , poikilothermic , meaning that their internal body temperature matches that of their ambient environment . Members of the family Lamnidae ( such as the shortfin mako shark and the great white shark ) are homeothermic and maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water . In these sharks , a strip of aerobic red muscle located near the center of the body generates the heat , which the body retains via a countercurrent exchange mechanism by a system of blood vessels called the rete mirabile ( " miraculous net " ) . The common thresher shark has a similar mechanism for maintaining an elevated body temperature , which is thought to have evolved independently . 
 = = = Osmoregulation = = = 
 In contrast to bony fish , with the exception of the coelacanth , the blood and other tissue of sharks and Chondrichthyes is generally isotonic to their marine environments because of the high concentration of urea ( up to 2 @.@ 5 % ) and <unk> N @-@ oxide ( <unk> ) , allowing them to be in osmotic balance with the seawater . This adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater , and they are therefore confined to marine environments . A few exceptions exist , such as the bull shark , which has developed a way to change its kidney function to excrete large amounts of urea . When a shark dies , the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria , causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia . 
 = = = Digestion = = = 
 Digestion can take a long time . The food moves from the mouth to a J @-@ shaped stomach , where it is stored and initial digestion occurs . Unwanted items may never get past the stomach , and instead the shark either vomits or turns its stomachs inside out and ejects unwanted items from its mouth . 
 One of the biggest differences between the digestive systems of sharks and mammals is that sharks have much shorter intestines . This short length is achieved by the spiral valve with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tube @-@ like intestine . The valve provides a long surface area , requiring food to circulate inside the short gut until fully digested , when remaining waste products pass into the cloaca . 
 = = Senses = = 
 = = = Smell = = = 
 Sharks have keen olfactory senses , located in the short duct ( which is not fused , unlike bony fish ) between the anterior and posterior nasal openings , with some species able to detect as little as one part per million of blood in seawater . 
 Sharks have the ability to determine the direction of a given scent based on the timing of scent detection in each nostril . This is similar to the method mammals use to determine direction of sound . 
 They are more attracted to the chemicals found in the intestines of many species , and as a result often linger near or in sewage outfalls . Some species , such as nurse sharks , have external barbels that greatly increase their ability to sense prey . 
 = = = Sight = = = 
 Shark eyes are similar to the eyes of other vertebrates , including similar lenses , corneas and retinas , though their eyesight is well adapted to the marine environment with the help of a tissue called tapetum lucidum . This tissue is behind the retina and reflects light back to it , thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters . The effectiveness of the tissue varies , with some sharks having stronger nocturnal adaptations . Many sharks can contract and dilate their pupils , like humans , something no teleost fish can do . Sharks have eyelids , but they do not blink because the surrounding water cleans their eyes . To protect their eyes some species have nictitating membranes . This membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked . However , some species , including the great white shark ( Carcharodon carcharias ) , do not have this membrane , but instead roll their eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey . The importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated . Some believe that <unk> and chemoreception are more significant , while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important . Presumably , the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant . The use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions . The shark 's field of vision can swap between monocular and stereoscopic at any time . A micro @-@ spectrophotometry study of 17 species of shark found 10 had only rod photoreceptors and no cone cells in their retinas giving them good night vision while making them colorblind . The remaining seven species had in addition to rods a single type of cone photoreceptor sensitive to green and , seeing only in shades of grey and green , are believed to be effectively colorblind . The study indicates that an object 's contrast against the background , rather than colour , may be more important for object detection . 
 = = = Hearing = = = 
 Although it is hard to test the hearing of sharks , they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can possibly hear prey from many miles away . A small opening on each side of their heads ( not the spiracle ) leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel . The lateral line shows a similar arrangement , and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores . This is a reminder of the common origin of these two <unk> and sound @-@ detecting organs that are grouped together as the <unk> @-@ lateralis system . In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost . 
 = = = Electroreception = = = 
 The ampullae of Lorenzini are the <unk> organs . They number in the hundreds to thousands . Sharks use the ampullae of Lorenzini to detect the electromagnetic fields that all living things produce . This helps sharks ( particularly the hammerhead shark ) find prey . The shark has the greatest electrical sensitivity of any animal . Sharks find prey hidden in sand by detecting the electric fields they produce . Ocean currents moving in the magnetic field of the Earth also generate electric fields that sharks can use for orientation and possibly navigation . 
 = = = Lateral line = = = 
 This system is found in most fish , including sharks . It detects motion or vibrations in water . The shark can sense frequencies in the range of 25 to 50 Hz . 
 = = Life history = = 
 Shark lifespans vary by species . Most live 20 to 30 years . The spiny dogfish has the longest lifespan at more than 100 years . Whale sharks ( Rhincodon typus ) may also live over 100 years . 
 = = = Reproduction = = = 
 Unlike most bony fish , sharks are K @-@ selected <unk> , meaning that they produce a small number of well @-@ developed young as opposed to a large number of poorly developed young . Fecundity in sharks ranges from 2 to over 100 young per reproductive cycle . Sharks mature slowly relative to many other fish . For example , lemon sharks reach sexual maturity at around age 13 – 15 . 
 = = = = Sexual = = = = 
 Sharks practice internal fertilization . The posterior part of a male shark 's pelvic fins are modified into a pair of intromittent organs called claspers , analogous to a mammalian penis , of which one is used to deliver sperm into the female . 
 Mating has rarely been observed in sharks . The smaller catsharks often mate with the male curling around the female . In less flexible species the two sharks swim parallel to each other while the male inserts a clasper into the female 's oviduct . Females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during mating . The bite marks may also come from courtship behavior : the male may bite the female to show his interest . In some species , females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites . 
 = = = = Asexual = = = = 
 There have been a number of documented cases in which a female shark who has not been in contact with a male has conceived a pup on her own through parthenogenesis . The details of this process are not well understood , but genetic fingerprinting showed that the pups had no paternal genetic contribution , ruling out sperm storage . The extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown , as is whether other species have this capability . Mammals are now the only major vertebrate group in which asexual reproduction has not been observed . 
 Scientists say that asexual reproduction in the wild is rare , and probably a last @-@ ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present . Asexual reproduction diminishes genetic diversity , which helps build defenses against threats to the species . Species that rely solely on it risk extinction . Asexual reproduction may have contributed to the blue shark 's decline off the Irish coast . 
 = = = Brooding = = = 
 Sharks display three ways to bear their young , varying by species , <unk> , viviparity and ovoviviparity . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 Most sharks are ovoviviparous , meaning that the eggs hatch in the oviduct within the mother 's body and that the egg 's yolk and fluids secreted by glands in the walls of the oviduct nourishes the embryos . The young continue to be nourished by the remnants of the yolk and the oviduct 's fluids . As in viviparity , the young are born alive and fully functional . <unk> sharks practice oophagy , where the first embryos to hatch eat the remaining eggs . Taking this a step further , sand tiger shark pups <unk> consume neighboring embryos . The survival strategy for ovoviviparous species is to brood the young to a comparatively large size before birth . The whale shark is now classified as ovoviviparous rather than oviparous , because <unk> eggs are now thought to have been aborted . Most ovoviviparous sharks give birth in sheltered areas , including bays , river mouths and shallow reefs . They choose such areas for protection from predators ( mainly other sharks ) and the abundance of food . <unk> have the longest known gestation period of any shark , at 18 to 24 months . Basking sharks and frilled sharks appear to have even longer gestation periods , but accurate data are lacking . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 Some species are oviparous like most other fish , laying their eggs in the water . In most oviparous shark species , an egg case with the consistency of leather protects the developing embryo ( s ) . These cases may be <unk> into crevices for protection . Once empty , the egg case is known as a mermaid 's purse , and can wash up on shore . <unk> sharks include the horn shark , catshark , Port Jackson shark , and swellshark . 
 = = = = <unk> = = = = 
 Finally some sharks maintain a placental link to the developing young , this method is called viviparity . This is more analogous to mammalian gestation than that of other fishes . The young are born alive and fully functional . Hammerheads , the requiem sharks ( such as the bull and blue sharks ) , and smoothhounds are viviparous . 
 = = Behavior = = 
 The classic view describes a solitary hunter , ranging the oceans in search of food . However , this applies to only a few species . Most live far more social , sedentary , benthic lives , and appear likely to have their own distinct personalities . Even solitary sharks meet for breeding or at rich hunting grounds , which may lead them to cover thousands of miles in a year . Shark migration patterns may be even more complex than in birds , with many sharks covering entire ocean basins . 
 Sharks can be highly social , remaining in large schools . Sometimes more than 100 scalloped hammerheads congregate around seamounts and islands , e.g. , in the Gulf of California . Cross @-@ species social hierarchies exist . For example , oceanic whitetip sharks dominate silky sharks of comparable size during feeding . 
 When approached too closely some sharks perform a threat display . This usually consists of exaggerated swimming movements , and can vary in intensity according to the threat level . 
 = = = Speed = = = 
 In general , sharks swim ( " cruise " ) at an average speed of 8 kilometres per hour ( 5 @.@ 0 mph ) , but when feeding or attacking , the average shark can reach speeds upwards of 19 kilometres per hour ( 12 mph ) . The shortfin mako shark , the fastest shark and one of the fastest fish , can burst at speeds up to 50 kilometres per hour ( 31 mph ) . The great white shark is also capable of speed bursts . These exceptions may be due to the warm @-@ blooded , or homeothermic , nature of these sharks ' physiology . Sharks can travel 70 to 80 km in a day . 
 = = = Intelligence = = = 
 Sharks possess brain @-@ to @-@ body mass ratios that are similar to mammals and birds , and have exhibited apparent curiosity and behavior resembling play in the wild . 
 There is evidence that juvenile lemon sharks can use observational learning in their investigation of novel objects in their environment . 
 = = = Sleep = = = 
 All sharks need to keep water flowing over their gills in order for them to breathe , however not all species need to be moving to do this . Those that are able to breathe while not swimming do so by using their spiracles to force water over their gills , thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water . It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them and as such they are not truly asleep . 
 Species that do need to swim continuously to breathe go through a process known as sleep swimming , in which the shark is essentially unconscious . It is known from experiments conducted on the spiny dogfish that its spinal cord , rather than its brain , coordinates swimming , so spiny dogfish can continue to swim while sleeping , and this also may be the case in larger shark species . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Most sharks are carnivorous . Basking sharks , whale sharks , and megamouth sharks have independently evolved different strategies for filter feeding plankton : basking sharks practice ram feeding , whale sharks use suction to take in plankton and small fishes , and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean . This type of feeding requires gill rakers — long , slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve — analogous to the baleen plates of the great whales . The shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows from time to time in huge mouthfuls . Teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed for feeding . 
 Other highly specialized feeders include cookiecutter sharks , which feed on flesh sliced out of other larger fish and marine mammals . Cookiecutter teeth are enormous compared to the animal 's size . The lower teeth are particularly sharp . Although they have never been observed feeding , they are believed to latch onto their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal , twisting their bodies to rip off flesh . 
 Some seabed – dwelling species are highly effective ambush predators . Angel sharks and wobbegongs use camouflage to lie in wait and suck prey into their mouths . Many benthic sharks feed solely on crustaceans which they crush with their flat molariform teeth . 
 Other sharks feed on squid or fish , which they swallow whole . The viper dogfish has teeth it can point outwards to strike and capture prey that it then swallows intact . The great white and other large predators either swallow small prey whole or take huge bites out of large animals . Thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes , and sawsharks either stir prey from the seabed or slash at swimming prey with their tooth @-@ studded rostra . 
 Many sharks , including the whitetip reef shark are cooperative feeders and hunt in packs to herd and capture elusive prey . These social sharks are often migratory , traveling huge distances around ocean basins in large schools . These migrations may be partly necessary to find new food sources . 
 = = = Range and habitat = = = 
 Sharks are found in all seas . They generally do not live in fresh water , with a few exceptions such as the bull shark and the river shark which can swim both in seawater and freshwater . Sharks are common down to depths of 2 @,@ 000 metres ( 7 @,@ 000 ft ) , and some live even deeper , but they are almost entirely absent below 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 10 @,@ 000 ft ) . The deepest confirmed report of a shark is a Portuguese dogfish at 3 @,@ 700 metres ( 12 @,@ 100 ft ) .

 = = = Attacks = = = 
 In 2006 the International Shark Attack File ( ISAF ) undertook an investigation into 96 alleged shark attacks , confirming 62 of them as unprovoked attacks and 16 as provoked attacks . The average number of fatalities worldwide per year between 2001 and 2006 from unprovoked shark attacks is 4 @.@ 3 . 
 Contrary to popular belief , only a few sharks are dangerous to humans . Out of more than 470 species , only four have been involved in a significant number of fatal , unprovoked attacks on humans : the great white , oceanic whitetip , tiger , and bull sharks . These sharks are large , powerful predators , and may sometimes attack and kill people . Despite being responsible for attacks on humans they have all been filmed without using a protective cage . 
 The perception of sharks as dangerous animals has been popularized by publicity given to a few isolated unprovoked attacks , such as the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916 , and through popular fictional works about shark attacks , such as the Jaws film series . Jaws author Peter Benchley , as well as Jaws director Steven Spielberg later attempted to dispel the image of sharks as man @-@ eating monsters . 
 To help avoid an unprovoked attack , humans should not wear jewelry or metal that is shiny and refrain from splashing around too much . 
 = = = In captivity = = = 
 Until recently , only a few benthic species of shark , such as <unk> , leopard sharks and catsharks , had survived in aquarium conditions for a year or more . This gave rise to the belief that sharks , as well as being difficult to capture and transport , were difficult to care for . More knowledge has led to more species ( including the large pelagic sharks ) living far longer in captivity , along with safer transportation techniques that have enabled long distance transportation . For a long time , the great white shark had never been successfully held in captivity for long , but in September 2004 , the Monterey Bay Aquarium successfully kept a young female for 198 days before releasing her . 
 Most species are not suitable for home aquaria , and not every species sold by pet stores are appropriate . Some species can flourish in home saltwater aquaria . <unk> or unscrupulous dealers sometimes sell juvenile sharks like the nurse shark , which upon reaching adulthood is far too large for typical home aquaria . Public aquaria generally do not accept donated specimens that have outgrown their housing . Some owners have been tempted to release them . Species appropriate to home aquaria represent considerable spatial and financial investments as they generally approach adult lengths of 3 feet ( 90 cm ) and can live up to 25 years .

 Sharks figure prominently in Hawaiian mythology . Stories tell of men with shark jaws on their back who could change between shark and human form . A common theme was that a shark @-@ man would warn beach @-@ goers of sharks in the waters . The beach @-@ goers would laugh and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the shark @-@ man who warned them . Hawaiian mythology also includes many shark gods . Among a fishing people , the most popular of all aumakua , or deified ancestor guardians , are shark aumakua . <unk> describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become a shark . The body transforms gradually until the kahuna can point the awe @-@ struck family to the markings on the shark 's body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloved 's body had been wrapped . Such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet , receiving food , and driving fish into the family net and warding off danger . Like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies . The ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery . Many Native Hawaiian families claim such an aumakua , who is known by name to the whole community . 
 <unk> 'i is the best known and revered of the shark gods , he was the older and favored brother of Pele , and helped and journeyed with her to Hawaii . He was able to assume all human and fish forms . A summit cliff on the crater of Kilauea is one of his most sacred spots . At one point he had a <unk> ( temple or shrine ) dedicated to him on every piece of land that jutted into the ocean on the island of Molokai . <unk> 'i was an ancestral god , not a human who became a shark and banned the eating of humans after eating one herself . In Fijian <unk> , <unk> was a shark god who was the eater of lost souls . 
 = = = In popular culture = = = 
 In contrast to the complex portrayals by Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders , the European and Western view of sharks has historically been mostly of fear and malevolence . Sharks are used in popular culture commonly as eating machines , notably in the Jaws novel and the film of the same name , along with its sequels . Sharks are threats in other films such as Deep Blue Sea , The Reef , and others , although they are sometimes used for comedic effect such as in Finding Nemo and the Austin Powers series . These comedic effects can sometimes be unintentional , as seen in Batman : The Movie and various Syfy channel films like <unk> and <unk> . 
 Sharks tend to be seen quite often in cartoons whenever a scene involves the ocean . Such examples include the Tom and Jerry cartoons , <unk> , and other shows produced by Hanna @-@ Barbera . They also are used commonly as a clichéd means of killing off a character that is held up by a rope or some similar object as the sharks swim right below them , or the character may be standing on a plank above shark infested waters .

 A popular myth is that sharks are immune to disease and cancer , but this is not scientifically supported . Sharks have been known to get cancer . Both diseases and parasites affect sharks . The evidence that sharks are at least resistant to cancer and disease is mostly anecdotal and there have been few , if any , scientific or statistical studies that show sharks to have heightened immunity to disease . Other apparently false claims are that fins prevent cancer and treat osteoarthritis . No scientific proof supports these claims ; at least one study has shown shark cartilage of no value in cancer treatment .

 It is estimated that 100 million sharks are killed by people every year , due to commercial and recreational fishing . Shark finning yields are estimated at 1 @.@ 44 million metric tons for 2000 , and 1 @.@ 41 million tons for 2010 . Based on an analysis of average shark weights , this translates into a total annual mortality estimate of about 100 million sharks in 2000 , and about 97 million sharks in 2010 , with a total range of possible values between 63 and 273 million sharks per year . Sharks are a common seafood in many places , including Japan and Australia . In the Australian state of Victoria , shark is the most commonly used fish in fish and chips , in which fillets are battered and deep @-@ fried or <unk> and grilled . In fish and chip shops , shark is called flake . In India , small sharks or baby sharks ( called sora in Tamil language , Telugu language ) are sold in local markets . Since the flesh is not developed , cooking the flesh breaks it into powder , which is then fried in oil and spices ( called sora <unk> / sora <unk> ) . The soft bones can be easily chewed . They are considered a delicacy in coastal Tamil Nadu . Icelanders ferment Greenland sharks to produce <unk> , which is widely regarded as a national dish . During a four @-@ year period from 1996 to 2000 , an estimated 26 to 73 million sharks were killed and traded annually in commercial markets . 
 Sharks are often killed for shark fin soup . Fishermen capture live sharks , fin them , and dump the finless animal back into the water . Shark finning involves removing the fin with a hot metal blade . The resulting immobile shark soon dies from suffocation or predators . Shark fin has become a major trade within black markets all over the world . Fins sell for about $ 300 / lb in 2009 . Poachers illegally fin millions each year . Few governments enforce laws that protect them . In 2010 Hawaii became the first U.S. state to prohibit the possession , sale , trade or distribution of shark fins . From 1996 to 2000 , an estimated 38 million sharks had been killed per year for harvesting shark fins . 
 Shark fin soup is a status symbol in Asian countries , and is considered healthy and full of nutrients . Sharks are also killed for meat . European diners consume <unk> , smoothhounds , catsharks , makos , porbeagle and also skates and rays . However , the U.S. FDA lists sharks as one of four fish ( with swordfish , king mackerel , and tilefish ) whose high mercury content is hazardous to children and pregnant women . 
 Sharks generally reach sexual maturity only after many years and produce few offspring in comparison to other harvested fish . Harvesting sharks before they reproduce severely impacts future populations . 
 The majority of shark fisheries have little monitoring or management . The rise in demand for shark products increases pressure on fisheries . Major declines in shark stocks have been recorded — some species have been depleted by over 90 % over the past 20 – 30 years with population declines of 70 % not unusual . A study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature suggests that one quarter of all known species of sharks and rays are threatened by extinction and 25 species were classified as critically endangered .

 Other threats include habitat alteration , damage and loss from coastal development , pollution and the impact of fisheries on the seabed and prey species . The 2007 documentary , <unk> exposed how sharks are being hunted to extinction .

 In 1991 , South Africa was the first country in the world to declare Great White sharks a legally protected species . 
 Intending to ban the practice of shark finning while at sea , the United States Congress passed the Shark Finning Prohibition Act in 2000 . Two years later the Act saw its first legal challenge in United States v. Approximately 64 @,@ 695 Pounds of Shark Fins . In 2008 a Federal Appeals Court ruled that a loophole in the law allowed non @-@ fishing vessels to purchase shark fins from fishing vessels while on the high seas . Seeking to close the loophole , the Shark Conservation Act was passed by Congress in December 2010 , and it was signed into law in January 2011 . 
 In 2003 , the European Union introduced a general shark finning ban for all vessels of all nationalities in Union waters and for all vessels flying a flag of one of its member states . This prohibition was amended in June 2013 to close remaining loopholes . 
 In 2009 , the International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN Red List of Endangered Species named 64 species , one @-@ third of all oceanic shark species , as being at risk of extinction due to fishing and shark finning . 
 In 2010 , the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) rejected proposals from the United States and Palau that would have required countries to strictly regulate trade in several species of scalloped hammerhead , oceanic whitetip and spiny dogfish sharks . The majority , but not the required two @-@ thirds of voting delegates , approved the proposal . China , by far the world 's largest shark market , and Japan , which battles all attempts to extend the convention to marine species , led the opposition . In March 2013 , three endangered commercially valuable sharks , the hammerheads , the oceanic whitetip and porbeagle were added to Appendix 2 of CITES , bringing shark fishing and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation . 
 In 2010 , Greenpeace International added the school shark , shortfin mako shark , mackerel shark , tiger shark and spiny dogfish to its seafood red list , a list of common supermarket fish that are often sourced from unsustainable fisheries . Advocacy group Shark Trust campaigns to limit shark fishing . Advocacy group Seafood Watch directs American consumers to not eat sharks . 
 Under the auspices of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals ( CMS ) , also known as the Bonn Convention , the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks was concluded and came into effect in March 2010 . It was the first global instrument concluded under CMS and aims at facilitating international coordination for the protection , conservation and management of migratory sharks , through multilateral , intergovernmental discussion and scientific research . 
 In July 2013 , New York state , a major market and entry point for shark fins , banned the shark fin trade joining seven other states of the United States and the three Pacific U.S territories in providing legal protection to sharks .

The song was produced by Luke with vocal editing done by Emily Wright . During an interview with Esquire magazine Kesha was asked about her song writing process and used " Take It Off " as an example of how her songs come to fruition . She explained that the song came about when she was out one night and was visiting a transsexual bar , stating , " I have a song [ ... ] called ' Take It Off ' about when I went to a drag show , and how really turned on I was by these transvestite men taking clothes off . I was like , What does that even make me ? " . 
 = = Composition = =

Kesha 's vocals on the song were noted for their heavy amounts of auto @-@ tune . Daniel Brockman from The Phoenix described the song as " a heavily Auto @-@ Tuned reworking " of " There 's a Place in France " . Monica Herrera from Billboard however , felt that the song " lifted heavily from Robert Miles ' 1995 trance @-@ lite hit , " Children . " Lyrically , " Take It Off " discusses opposite @-@ sex objectification and its theme is literal to the title .

" Lamb further commented that the lyrics drew similar reference to that of Lady Gaga 's commenting , " followers of Lady Gaga 's Monster Ball Tour will be familiar with this point of view [ about free expression ] .

 Amar Toor from AOL Radio gave the song a positive review saying , " Much like the rest of the album , this new song is simply made for the dance floor . And , much like Kesha herself , the track seems to embody relentless , carefree hedonism at its best . " He also noted , " And when Kesha talks about a ' place I know ' , where ' they go hardcore and there 's glitter on the floor ' in the style of a six @-@ grade camp ditty , it 's hard for anyone to not feel the urge to just take it off . " Bill Lamb of About.com gave the single four out of five stars . He was concerned with the overall lyrical depth and over @-@ use of auto @-@ tune but he complimented the song for its " irresistibly catchy beat and chorus " with a " celebratory mood of dropping inhibitions . " He noted that " with the volume turned up and the chorus encouraging you to ' take it off , ' you may just feel inspired to follow the commands . The ultimate effect by the end of the song is very cathartic as it hints strongly that there is more to " take off " than simply clothing . " Andrew Burgess from musicOMH wrote that on the song the singer " oozes swagger . " Melinda Newman of HitFix used " Take It Off " as an example of Kesha 's songwriting , noting that tracks which weren 't over @-@ thought were " fine " . Newman wrote that " thinking too much is what gets Kesha , who co @-@ wrote the songs here , in trouble . She ’ s fine wading in the shallow end with bouncy tunes like the literal ' Take It Off ' . " 
 Monica Herrera from Billboard magazine criticized the song for its demonstration of overly processed vocals noting how easily an artist can " get lost in a sea of auto @-@ tone " . She went on to state that it " make [ s ] it hard to tell whether the California party girl can actually sing " . Robert Copsey of Digital Spy met the song with a mixed review . He commented on the choice of the single , noting " the glimpses of emotion shown on her last offering , ' Your Love Is My Drug ' , are as long gone as her sobriety . " Although he was not completely convinced he wrote , " [ though ] the vocals are more processed than a cheese string [ ... ] the combination of a playful nursery rhyme hook and Dr Luke 's bubblegummy electro production make this a pretty irresistible little dancefloor ditty . " He went on to give the single three out of five stars . Fraser McAlpine of BBC met the song with a mixed review giving the song three out of five stars . Fraser criticized the choice of the song commenting , " there 's a fear that if Kesha reveals that she 's a sensitive young flower after all , with real feelings and a good , pure heart , her appeal with disappear like a soap bubble on a cactus , can it ? " . Nate Adams of No Ripcord was negative in his review of the song , calling it " outright stupid " and noted it would be something commonly heard on a playground . Adams wrote that the song touched on opposite @-@ sex objectification , but wrote that the theme became wearisome on the album , using the song as one of the examples where the theme was overused .

 The original video for " Take It Off " premiered on Vevo on August 3 , 2010 . It was directed by Paul Hunter and Dori <unk> . Kesha revealed the main idea behind the video in an interview explaining that " [ the video was ] about [ her ] and all [ her ] hot vampire babe friends breaking into a hotel on another planet , and at the end we all turn into this beautiful stardust . Once you take it all off , all your inhibitions , your clothes , we 're all made up of the same thing . " She explained that she did not want the video to just be about " Taking it off " , that the message behind the video and the theme wasn 't " just about taking off your clothes and rolling in glitter . It 's also about taking off your inhibitions and being raw and real " .

As this is happening they all begin to lose different parts of their bodies as they explode into multicolored star dust . The video ends with everyone as dust with Kesha beginning to " unzip " herself as she turns into yellow dust . 
 Jocelyn Vena of MTV News met the video with a positive review . She noted that Kesha " manages to embrace her inner party animal and throw a neon @-@ colored party at an abandoned motel in the middle of nowhere . " She stated that " While the concept of " a lot of pretty people dancing at dusk " is pretty simple , the neon colors manage to amp up the video , as does the colored sand that 's thrown around in the air and mixed with glitter . " Her conclusion of the video and of Kesha was that as simple as it may be , " she manages to be both sexy and fun while rolling around in the desert . " Melinda Newman of HitFix criticized the video 's first half , calling it " predictable . " The video 's second half , however , was met with praise with Newman commenting that the ' special effects at the end almost redeem it . "

 James Calvin " Jimmy " Rollins ( born November 27 , 1978 ) , nicknamed " J @-@ Roll " , is an American professional baseball shortstop who is a free agent . He has played in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for the Philadelphia Phillies from 2000 to 2014 , Los Angeles Dodgers in 2015 and Chicago White Sox in 2016 . 
 After growing up in Alameda , California , and attending <unk> High School , Rollins was drafted by the Phillies in the second round of the 1996 MLB draft , spending most of five seasons with Phillies minor league teams before earning a promotion to the MLB team . 
 In Philadelphia , Rollins earned a reputation as an excellent defensive shortstop . In July 2001 , Rollins became the Phillies ' leadoff hitter , a role he retained for almost ten years . He made three All @-@ Star Game appearances early in his career . While a Phillie , Rollins compiled a 38 @-@ game hitting streak , which spanned the end of the 2005 season and the start of the 2006 season , the longest in team history . Rollins was named the National League Most Valuable Player in 2007 , as the Phillies won their division in the first of five consecutive seasons . He was also a key component of the 2008 World Series champion team . In his final season with the Phillies , he became the franchise 's all @-@ time leader in hits . During the offseason , he was traded to the Dodgers for the 2015 season . 
 = = Family and background = = 
 Rollins grew up in Alameda as a member of an athletic family . His mother played competitive fastpitch softball , and credits the experience for helping him develop a cerebral approach to the game as well as a passion for the middle infield ; he has been described as having " a near @-@ photographic memory of games and at @-@ bats and pitches " . Rollins ' brother , <unk> , played with minor league affiliates of the Texas Rangers and the Montreal Expos . His sister , Shay Rollins , was a starter on the University of San Francisco 's women 's basketball team , and he is the cousin of former MLB player Tony <unk> . Despite the athletes in his family , his father encouraged Rollins to pursue music as well as baseball ; Rollins played the trumpet while growing up , and participated in various MC Hammer and Mavis Staples music videos during his adolescent years . 
 Rollins attended <unk> High School in Alameda , graduating in 1996 . His parents refused to let him continue playing football , instead directing him to focus on baseball . He finished his high school baseball career as the holder of 10 school records , including highest batting average ( .484 ) , and most stolen bases ( 99 ) . For his performance , USA Today named him a member of its All @-@ USA High School Baseball Team , and Baseball America named him the top infielder in Northern California as well as a second @-@ team All @-@ American . He committed to play college baseball at Arizona State University on a scholarship , but after " effusive " praise from Phillies Bay Area scout Bob Poole , the team drafted him in the second round of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft .

 = = = Minor leagues : 1996 – 2000 = = = 
 After being drafted by the Phillies in the second round of the 1996 draft , Rollins was assigned to the rookie @-@ league Martinsville Phillies . He led the team in walks and stole 20 bases , but batted only .238 . However , he still earned a promotion to low @-@ A Piedmont for the 1997 season . The youngest player on the team at age 18 , Rollins led the team in games played , at @-@ bats , runs , hits , triples , stolen bases , and walks all in the same year . He batted .270 , stole 46 bases , and had 560 at @-@ bats , over 100 more than second @-@ place Dave Francia . For his performance , he was named a co @-@ winner of the Paul Owens Award , given to the Phillies ' top minor league player . At the end of the season he played in the Florida Instructional League . 
 Rollins was promoted to high @-@ A Clearwater in 1998 . While playing alongside future Phillies teammates Pat Burrell , Johnny Estrada , Adam Eaton , and Brandon Duckworth , Rollins batted .244 with 18 doubles and 23 stolen bases ; once again , he was the youngest player on the team . Eaton , Burrell , and Rollins were all promoted to AA Reading together the next year , and Rollins led the team in games and at @-@ bats , as well as hits . His 145 hits gave him an average of .273 , and led to a late @-@ season promotion to Scranton / Wilkes @-@ Barre , where he played four games . In 2000 , he led Scranton in games played , doubles , and triples , and helped lead the team to the playoffs . 
 Rollins received a September callup to the Phillies . He debuted on September 17 against the Florida Marlins and had two hits in four at @-@ bats in the game , with his first MLB hit being a triple off of Chuck Smith of the Marlins . He batted .321 in 14 games , stealing three bases and batting in five runs . After the season , Baseball America named him the Phillies ' top organizational prospect . He was a finalist for the United States national baseball team to participate in the 2000 Olympics , but did not survive the final cut .

 Rollins spent the entire 2001 season with the major league Phillies and hit his first MLB home run on May 2 off of Brian Bohanon of the Colorado Rockies . He achieved several statistical milestones , including a " quadruple @-@ double " ( double digit doubles , triples , home runs , and stolen bases ) . Moreover , he led the National League in triples and stolen bases , becoming the first rookie to do so since 1951 , as well as leading the NL in at bats . He was a member of the NL all @-@ star team in the 2001 Major League Baseball All @-@ Star Game , the Phillies only representative . In July , he took over from Doug Glanville as the Phillies ' leadoff hitter , a role he seldom ceded for nearly a decade . At the conclusion of the season , the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum named him the co @-@ winner of the Cool Papa Bell Award , given to the stolen bases leader , MLB managers voted him to the Topps Major League Rookie All @-@ Star team , and Baseball America named him the fifth @-@ best rookie in MLB . 
 Entering the 2002 season , despite his youth , Rollins sought to be a leader in the Phillies ' clubhouse ; an article in The Philadelphia Inquirer said , " Rollins , even at just 23 years old , may now have the clout needed to be a stern voice that makes a difference in the clubhouse and on the field . " Rollins ' season was characterized by a strong first half , and a " sophomore jinx " at the plate that plagued him in the second half of the season . For his performance in the early months of the season , he earned his second consecutive selection to the MLB All @-@ Star game , in doing so becoming the first Phillie and first MLB shortstop ever to reach the game in each of his first two seasons . After the all @-@ star game , however , he struggled at the plate , striking out frequently and chasing many high pitches that were out of the strike zone . Ultimately , Rollins finished the season among the NL leaders in defensive statistics – he compiled a <unk> fielding percentage ( second in NL ) , 695 total chances ( third in NL ) , 504 assists ( fourth in NL ) , and 226 putouts ( fifth in NL ) . Meanwhile , offensively , he regressed from his 2001 campaign , posting a .245 batting average with 11 home runs , but still leading the NL with 10 triples ; he stole 31 bases , 15 fewer than he did in 2001 . After the season , he participated in the Major League Baseball Japan All @-@ Star Series . 
 Prior to the 2003 season , he worked with Tony Gwynn on skills at the plate , predominantly using the whole field and being more of a " slap hitter " . However , he began the season slowly , sustaining a hamstring injury in spring training that hindered his progress , and ultimately struggling at the plate early in the season , causing manager Larry Bowa to drop him in the lineup . Throughout the season , he sought to maintain the focus that he admitted to having lost the previous season , and he eventually rebounded to post a " respectable " stat line – a .263 batting average with eight home runs and 62 RBIs , although he stole what at the time was a career @-@ low 20 bases . Among his season highlights were a game @-@ winning RBI against John Smoltz in June , and stealing his 100th career base in September , both of which occurred in games against the Atlanta Braves . 
 On January 15 , Rollins signed a US $ 2 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 contract with the Phillies to avoid salary arbitration . According to one biography of Rollins , 
 " In 2004 , Jimmy finally became the player the Phillies had been waiting for . He batted .289 with a .455 slugging percentage , scored 119 runs , led the league in triples , cut down considerably on his strikeouts , batted well from both sides of the plate , and hit well in the clutch . The workouts with Gwynn had helped , but it was joining morning sessions with ( Bobby ) Abreu that enabled him to sting the ball with authority and consistency . " 
 Overall , he achieved another " quadruple – double " ( home runs , stolen bases , doubles , and triples in double figures in a single season ) , his first career grand slam , and posted career highs in a plethora of offensive categories including batting average , slugging percentage , RBIs , and hits . 
 = = = = 2005 – 2007 = = = = 
 Under new manager Charlie Manuel , whose offensive strategy predominantly revolved around hitting lots of home runs , Rollins struggled to post a strong batting average early in the Phillies ' 2005 season , as he too tried to hit home runs . Nevertheless , he was again selected to the NL All @-@ Star team . His offensive strategy changed in early August , when he began a hitting streak that spanned the season 's final 36 games ; during the streak , he hit .379 . It was the longest hitting streak in Phillies ' history , surpassing Ed Delahanty , whose streak lasted 31 games . Throughout the streak , Rollins aspired to maintain a team @-@ first mentality , and noted that he would trade the streak for a playoff berth : " If we lose and I keep the streak , what does that mean ? The season is automatically over . The playoffs is everything . That 's what we all want . " Ultimately , the Phillies missed the playoffs by one game . Overall , Rollins compiled his fourth career quadruple @-@ double , tying Jonny Damon for most among active players , and posted a .290 batting average with 12 home runs , 54 RBIs , and 41 stolen bases . 
 The 2006 Phillies season began with much hype surrounding Rollins , and whether he could extend his hitting streak to pass Joe DiMaggio 's record 56 games . He extended the streak two games into the season , but it ended on April 6 when he failed to get a hit in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals . He struggled during the first half of the season , posting a batting average of just .259 , but rebounded during the second half , ultimately posting strong cumulative numbers once again . He became the third player in Phillies ' history to score at least 100 runs in three consecutive seasons ( Chuck Klein and Bobby Abreu ) , and led all NL shortstops in RBIs , runs scored , extra @-@ base hits , and total bases . He was just short , however , of another quadruple @-@ double . Cumulatively , he hit .277 with 25 home runs and 83 RBIs ( at the time , the latter two were career @-@ highs ) . Once again , the Phillies barely missed the playoffs . 
 Before spring training , Rollins announced that the Phillies were the " Team to Beat " in the National League East : 
 The Mets had a chance to win the World Series last year . Last year is over . I think we are the team to beat in the NL East , finally . But , that 's only on paper . " 
 It became a sports media sensation , especially given that the New York Mets had won the division in 2006 with relative ease . The claim was widely reported , often without the second part of the quote ( " only on paper " ) . USA Today columnist Hal Bodley opined , " The Phillies have needed someone to light a fire , especially in April . Rollins ' bold , if not arrogant , prediction might just do that . " During the first half of the season , it appeared Rollins had spoken prematurely , as the Mets jumped out to an early divisional lead . On June 28 , Rollins had a four @-@ hit game against the Cincinnati Reds , including a game @-@ tying triple . The triple was Rollins ' 10th , which gave him his fifth career " quadruple – double " . 
 In August , the Mets ' lead began to dissipate , as the Phillies combined several solid series ; Rollins was a key component of their success . Rollins was named the National League Player of the Week for August 27 to September 2 , 2007 . On September 25 against the Atlanta Braves , Rollins hit the home run that completed his 30 – 30 season . On the last day of the 2007 season , Rollins became the seventh player to collect at least 20 doubles , 20 triples , and 20 home runs in one season when he hit his 20th triple of the year in a 6 – 1 win over the Washington Nationals that clinched the National League East division championship for the Phillies , which confirmed Rollins ' preseason assertion of the Phillies preeminence . The club advanced to the playoffs for the first time since their 1993 World Series loss ; however , they were swept by the Colorado Rockies in the National League Division Series . 
 Rollins was named the National League 's Most Valuable Player . He also received the <unk> Oscar Charleston Legacy Award ( NL MVP ) , and won the first of three consecutive Gold Glove Awards , becoming the first Phillies shortstop to win a Gold Glove since Larry Bowa in 1978 . He was the first player in MLB history to record 200 hits , 20 triples , 30 home runs , and 30 stolen bases in a season .

 Unlike in spring training 2007 , Rollins " made no guarantees heading into the next season , but that didn 't mean the Phillies weren 't confident " entering their 2008 season , despite the Mets ' acquisition of Johan Santana and a " 2007 Rollins @-@ esque " guarantee of winning the division from Carlos Beltrán . After beginning the season by hitting a home run on opening day , Rollins landed on the disabled list ( DL ) for the first time in his career in early April , suffering an ankle sprain . He returned in May , and had a " productive " summer , ultimately posting a career @-@ high 47 stolen bases , notwithstanding his batting average dropping to .277 , and his home run and RBI totals dropping to 11 and 59 respectively . In the postseason , Rollins was a focal point of the team , which ultimately won the 2008 World Series ; in the division series ( NLDS ) , he hit a leadoff home run in game four , and in the championship series ( NLCS ) , he hit a leadoff home run in game five , and despite struggles early in the World Series , he eventually contributed with strong situational hitting , helping the Phillies win the series in five games . At the conclusion of the season , Rollins was honored with a Fielding Bible Award for defensive excellence as the top MLB shortstop during the year . 
 Rollins began 2009 by participating in the 2009 World Baseball Classic ( WBC ) as a member of Team USA ; he hit .417 and was named to the all @-@ tournament team . After setting a career high in stolen bases in 2008 , he did not steal one in the season 's first 17 games , his longest drought to begin a season since 2004 . On May 21 , he reached the 1500 @-@ hit milestone in a game against the Cincinnati Reds . As of the end of June , however , he was hitting just .205 ( he went 28 consecutive at @-@ bats without a hit from the end of June until July 2 ) , and was benched for four games by Charlie Manuel in an effort to encourage him to regain the shorter , lower half @-@ driven swing that he used in his 2007 MVP campaign . He did improve in the second half of the season , batting .288 from July 3 to the end of the year . Overall , he compiled an NL @-@ leading 672 at @-@ bats , finished fourth in doubles ( 43 ) and stolen bases ( 31 ) , and tenth in runs ( 100 ) ; in addition , he had a .250 batting average , 21 home runs ( five of which were leadoff , the most in his career ) , and 77 RBIs , also winning the National League Gold Glove award for shortstops . In the postseason , he helped the Phillies reach the 2009 World Series by hitting a walk @-@ off double in game four of the NLCS . The Phillies failed to repeat as champions , however . They lost to the New York Yankees . 
 Rollins ' 2010 season was marked by injuries ; he missed a total of 74 games , playing in only 88 , the lowest total of his major league career . While warming up in the outfield prior to the Phillies ' game on April 12 , he strained his right calf , and eventually was placed on the disabled list . He spent April 13 – May 16 , and May 22 – June 21 on the DL with that injury ; Wilson Valdez served as his backup . When he returned , he hit his first career walk @-@ off home run on June 23 , powering the Phillies to a 7 – 6 victory over the Cleveland Indians . On July 3 , he hit his 150th career home run in a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates , and on October 1 , he hit his third career grand slam in a game against the Atlanta Braves . Overall , he hit .243 with eight home runs and 41 RBIs . He maintained his strong defense despite poor offense , but after his third consecutive mediocre offensive season , some questioned whether his MVP campaign in 2007 was a fluke . 
 2011 was a contract year for Rollins , and his performance concurrently rebounded , insofar as he improved his batting average , and home run and RBI totals . He made his 11th consecutive opening day start , and , for the first time in several seasons , he was healthy at the beginning of the season , starting the season 's first 49 games . Nevertheless , it took him 54 plate appearances to record his first RBI , the longest drought of his career . On July 20 , for the second time in his career , he had a multi @-@ home run game in which one home run came batting right @-@ handed and the other left @-@ handed , the first Phillies player to do it multiple times . His season was not entirely devoid of injuries ; on August 22 , a right groin strain landed him on the DL , causing him to miss 18 games . He returned in time for the playoffs , and set several Phillies records in the 2011 NLDS , including hits ( 9 ) , doubles ( 4 ) , and multi @-@ hit games ( 4 ) . Despite the records , the Phillies lost the series to the St. Louis Cardinals . Overall , he posted a .268 batting average with 16 home runs and 63 RBIs . At the season 's conclusion , Rollins was selected as the shortstop on the MLB Insiders Club Magazine All @-@ Postseason Team . On December 17 , 2011 , Rollins signed a three @-@ year , $ 33 million deal with a vesting option for a fourth year , worth another $ 11 million . The option vested when he reached 1 @,@ 100 plate appearances in 2013 @-@ 14 . 
 = = = = 2012 – 2014 = = = = 
 In 2012 , Rollins epitomized the Phillies ' general " <unk> " by posting a .250 batting average with 23 home runs and 68 RBIs . He hit poorly in the beginning of the season , and did not hit a home run until his 136th at bat of the season , the second @-@ longest it had ever taken him to hit a home run at the beginning of a season . He missed three games from May 21 – 23 for the birth of his first daughter . On July 31 , he hit his fourth career inside @-@ the @-@ park home run , which led active players . His hitting improved over the latter half of the season , and in September , he hit eight home runs . He missed the final three games of the season with a calf strain . During the season , he joined Craig Biggio , Barry Larkin , and Paul Molitor as the only players in MLB history to record 2000 hits , 350 stolen bases , and 150 home runs as a member of one team . It was his fourth career season during which he hit at least 20 home runs and stole 30 bases , which trailed only Bobby and Barry Bonds . 
 Prior to the 2013 season , Rollins played for Team USA in the 2013 World Baseball Classic ( WBC ) , and was the only player from Team USA to make the event 's all @-@ star team ; it was his second WBC , and second placement on the all @-@ star team . He was back to the Phillies in time for opening day , and made his 13th consecutive start on opening day . Overall , he tied for fifth in the NL in games ( 160 ) , and led the team with 600 at @-@ bats , 151 hits , 36 doubles , and 59 walks . He achieved several career milestones during the season , including his 800th RBI ( April 22 ) , his 433 double ( breaking Ed Delahanty 's record on May 15 ) , and his 45th career leadoff home run ( fourth most in MLB history ; hit on July 20 ) . Despite the achievements , overall , the season was a decline from previous years ; his isolated power ( ISO ) was among the worst in the major leagues , he attempted to steal the fewest amount of bases in his career , and his defense " tanked " according to fielding metrics . He " struggled mightily " , and ultimately posted a .252 batting average with six home runs and 39 <unk> which " could be the beginning of his decline as an effective Major League hitter " . 
 Rollins attracted media attention in the offseason prior to 2014 when he supposedly expressed disinclination or lack of motivation after commenting " who cares " in regards to spring training ; Buster Olney penned a column suggesting that there was a sentiment within the Phillies ' organization that he should be traded ( the rumors were dispelled by Rollins and Phillies general manager Rubén Amaro , Jr. as ridiculous ) . He opened the season by hitting a grand slam against the Texas Rangers , which was also his 200th career home run . After two games , Rollins left the team on paternity leave to be with his wife as the couple had their second child . On April 12 , he hit a walk @-@ off home run against the Miami Marlins . On June 14 , Rollins singled to right field for his <unk> hit to surpass Mike Schmidt as the Phillies ' all @-@ time leader in hits . The game paused as Schmidt and the remainder of the Phillies congratulated Rollins at first base . Following the season , Rollins became the first ever co @-@ winner of the Roberto Clemente Award when he and recently retired Chicago White Sox captain Paul Konerko being announced as the awards ' recipients .

 On December 19 , 2014 , Rollins was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for minor league pitchers Tom Windle and Zach <unk> . Rollins waived his no @-@ trade clause in order for the trade to be accomplished and he stated that he was expecting to take on a leadership position with his new team . 
 Rollins played his first game with the Dodgers during opening day against the San Diego Padres on April 6 , 2015 , hitting a 3 @-@ run homer off of Shawn Kelley , giving the Dodgers a 6 @-@ 3 victory over the Padres . He struggled offensively with the Dodgers , hitting a career low .224 with 13 homers and 41 RBI . He also stole eight bases . In September , he lost his starting job to rookie Corey Seager . On the final day of the season , in a meaningless game , manager Don Mattingly let Rollins manage the club for the game .

 On February 22 , 2016 , Rollins signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox that included an invitation to major league spring training . He competed with Tyler Saladino for a starting role at shortstop . At the end of spring training , the team announced that Rollins would serve as their Opening Day shortstop . 
 Rollins batted .221 in 41 games for the White Sox . On June 10 , he was designated for assignment so the White Sox could promote Tim Anderson from the minor leagues .

 Growing up , Rollins admired Rickey Henderson , one of the best leadoff hitters in MLB history , and especially early in his career , sought to emulate Henderson at the plate . This contributed to his propensity to swing early in the count , and chase high pitches , seeking to hit home runs rather than get on base , the stereotypical role of a leadoff hitter . Consequently , he struggled to make contact with the ball , striking out too much , and rarely walking . To help alleviate those predominantly negative tendencies , he worked with Tony Gwynn , Sr. prior to the 2003 season to work on using the whole field , and hit more ground balls than pop @-@ ups . Overall , he " always had a hard time accepting that he is vertically challenged at 5 @-@ foot @-@ 8 " , which contributed to his inclination to strive to hit for power rather than contact , and to seek to pull the ball rather than use the whole field . The Phillies all @-@ time leader in hits , he also is second in Phillies history in stolen bases . 
 = = = Defense = = = 
 A " supreme defensive shortstop " , Rollins has won four Gold Glove Awards , and only Omar Vizquel has a better fielding percentage among shortstops who have played at least 10 seasons . Rollins attributes some of his defensive prowess to experience , noting that he has played in MLB for a long enough time to know most hitters ' tendencies and to learn how to read swings , both of which help him appropriately position himself to get to as many balls as possible . In their 2011 season preview , Lindy 's Sports commented that Rollins is an upper @-@ echelon shortstop " with soft hands , excellent agility and plus range left and right " , going on to praise his strong throwing arm , especially from the hole .

 An active philanthropist , Rollins and his wife Johari have participated in several charitable endeavors including the creation of The Johari & Jimmy Rollins Center for Animal Rehabilitation , which is located in Woolwich Township , New Jersey and provides several medical rehabilitation services for animals , and an annual <unk> charity bowling tournament to benefit the Arthritis Foundation . Rollins is also active politically , and campaigned for Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential Election . His second daughter , Logan Aliya , was born in early April 2014 .

 = Washington State Route 21 = 
 State Route 21 ( SR 21 ) is a 191 @.@ 34 @-@ mile ( 307 @.@ 93 km ) long state highway in the U.S. state of Washington that traverses four counties : Franklin , Adams , Lincoln and Ferry . The highway extends from an intersection with SR 260 in Kahlotus north through Lind , Odessa , Keller , Republic and Curlew before becoming Highway 41 ( BC 41 ) at the Canada – US border in Danville . SR 21 is concurrent with U.S. Route 2 ( US 2 ) in Wilbur and SR 20 in Republic and has two diamond interchanges : at US 395 in Lind and Interstate 90 ( I @-@ 90 ) south of Odessa . Between Lincoln and Ferry counties , the roadway crosses Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake on the Keller Ferry , operated fare free by the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) and the Department of Highways ( DoH ) since 1930 . 
 Since 1899 , at least one segment of the current highway has been in the state highway system . In 1899 , the Marble Mount Road was established and later numbered State Road 4 in 1905 and renamed to the Sans <unk> @-@ Loomis Road in 1907 . In 1915 , a branch to the Canada – US border was added to the highway , but was removed in 1923 . In 1937 , the Primary state highways were established and State Road 4 became Primary State Highway 4 ( PSH 4 ) , while the former Canadian branch became Secondary State Highway 4A ( SSH 4A ) . Another highway , extending from Lind to Wilbur , became SSH 4B . In 1964 , PSH 4 was split into SR 20 and SR 21 while SSH 2A and SSH 2B also became SR 21 . In 1983 , a road between Lind and Kahlotus became part of SR 21 . 
 The Keller Ferry , which travels across the Columbia River at Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake to connect the two segments of SR 21 , was originally a cable ferry operated in the early 1890s . J.C. Keller , founder of Keller , purchased the ferry in 1899 and traded ownership to Lincoln and Ferry counties in 1925 . In 1929 , the two counties unveiled a new eight @-@ car cable ferry , named the Keller of Seattle , which served the two counties until 1930 , when the predecessor of the current WSDOT , the DoH , purchased the ferry , but still operated Keller of Seattle until replacing it with the L.A. McLeod in 1939 . In 1944 , the Ann of Wilbur tugboat and Sanpoil barge acted as a ferry before a new replacement , the Martha S. was launched in 1948 . The Martha S. has been in continual operation since 1948 and WSDOT planned to replace the ferry in the near future , but funding came $ 5 @.@ 5 million US $ short . The ferry was suspended in early October 2009 after a leak was found in the hull of the Martha S. 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 21 originates at an intersection with SR 260 , about 0 @.@ 28 miles ( 0 @.@ 45 km ) east of the northern terminus of SR 263 ; both intersections are in the city of Kahlotus , which is located in a narrow valley near several coulees in Franklin County . After leaving Kahlotus as the Lind – Kahlotus Road , the highway turns northeast and later west as it passes over the Sand Hills Coulee four times . Curving due north , the roadway leaves Franklin County to enter Adams County . Passing farmland in the flat landscape , SR 21 intersects SR 26 and continues through an unnamed coulee to intersect Smart Road . Smart Road was the former alignment of SR 21 prior to the U.S. Route 395 ( US 395 ) interchange being built . SR 21 intersects US 395 in a diamond interchange east of Downtown Lind . From the interchange , the highway travels west and intersects Smart Road again before crossing over the Centennial Trail and entering Downtown Lind . In Downtown , the roadway is named Second , I and First Streets and serves as the main connector to other areas . After turning north to leave Lind , the road encounters the John Wayne Pioneer Trail and more plains before intersecting the pre @-@ interstate alignment of Interstate 90 ( I @-@ 90 ) and interchanging with I @-@ 90 at exit 206 , another diamond interchange . North of the interchange , SR 21 travels through more plains and a coulee to leave Adams County and enter Lincoln County . 
 In Lincoln County , the highway travels through farmland to encounter Odessa as Division Street , intersecting SR 28 . The roadway turns northwest at Pacific Lake and reverts northwards into farmland . After temporarily turning east into more farmland , the road enters Wilbur , named Bruce Avenue . In Wilbur , SR 21 turns west , concurrent with US 2 , for 0 @.@ 65 miles ( 1 @.@ 05 km ) before branching off north to intersect SR 174 and leave Wilbur towards dense forests . North of Wilbur , the roadway approaches <unk> Canyon and makes several turns before exiting the canyon and nearing Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake ; at 80 @,@ 000 acres ( 323 @.@ 75 km2 ) , the lake is the largest in Washington . Paralleling the lake , the road then uses the Keller Ferry , a 80 @-@ foot ( 24 @.@ 38 m ) long boat used as a fare @-@ free ferry across Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake , part of the Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area , operated by the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) and its previous counterparts since 1930 . 
 The ferry travels across the Lincoln County line to enter Ferry County , named after Elisha P. Ferry , the first Washington governor , southwest of Keller in the Colville Indian Reservation . Traveling northeast , between the Sanpoil River and the southern end of the Okanagan Highlands , SR 21 passes Keller and continues inland into the Columbia Mountains on the banks of the river . The river forms a canyon that the highway passes through and eventually both the river and road leave the Colville Indian Reservation . Shortly after leaving the reservation , the roadway enters Republic and becomes concurrent with SR 20 for 2 @.@ 56 miles ( 4 @.@ 12 km ) before exiting the concurrency and Republic . Between Republic and the Canada – US border , an estimated daily average of 1 @,@ 600 motorists used this segment of SR 21 , making this section the busiest . The daily average has declined since 2006 and 2007 , when a daily average of 1 @,@ 700 motorists utilized the segment . Northeast of Republic , the highway passes Curlew Lake , the 123 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 50 km2 ) Curlew Lake State Park and the communities of Malo and Curlew . After passing through more dense forests , the roadway enters Danville , where SR 21 crosses the Canada – US border into British Columbia as Highway 41 ( BC 41 ) . BC 41 continues 1 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 7 mi ) north to end at BC 3 southwest of Grand Forks , BC . 
 = = History = = 
 SR 21 originated as the Marble Mount Road that extended from the north end of the Keller Ferry to Republic and was established in 1899 . The Marble Mount Road was later numbered State Road 4 in 1905 and renamed to the Sans <unk> @-@ Loomis Road in 1907 . An extension of State Road 4 from Republic to the Canada – US border existed from 1915 until 1923 . When the Primary and secondary highway system was established in 1937 , Primary State Highway 4 ( PSH 4 ) replaced State Road 4 and was extended south from the Keller Ferry to Wilbur . The Canada – US border branch of State Road 4 that was deleted in 1923 was re @-@ added as Secondary State Highway 4A ( SSH 4A ) and a highway extending south from Wilbur to Lind became SSH 2B . All three roadways were later combined as SR 21 in a highway renumbering in 1964 . In 1983 , SR 21 was extended south to SR 260 in Kahlotus . Since 1983 , the road has not been realigned with the exception of the U.S. Route 395 ( US 395 ) interchange in Lind . The speed limit between Curlew Lake State Park and the community of the same name was temporarily lowered on March 9 , 2009 to 35 miles per hour ( 56 km / h ) due to cracks in the pavement . The speed limit was restored to 55 miles per hour ( 89 km / h ) on March 9 . 
 = = = Keller Ferry history = = = 
 The Keller Ferry connects SR 21 between Lincoln and Ferry counties , which are separated by Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake . The ferry originated as an oar @-@ propelled canoe that was used by Native Americans prior to the late 19th century . In the early 1890s a four @-@ car cable ferry , owned and operated by Todd Clark and William Robertson , was established . After the town of Keller was established north / upriver on the Sanpoil River in 1898 , J.C. Keller , the founder of the town , purchased the cable ferry in 1899 . In 1925 , Lincoln and Ferry counties jointly purchased Keller 's ferry and in 1929 replaced the original ferry with an eight @-@ car cable ferry that was later named Keller of Seattle . The Department of Highways ( DoH ) , the predecessor to the modern @-@ day Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) , purchased the ferry on September 1 , 1930 and ran it toll @-@ free as it is today . The original location of the ferry was flooded between 1939 and 1940 after the damming of the Grand Coulee Dam west / downriver on the Columbia River created Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake . In July 1939 , the L.A. McLeod was launched and replaced the earlier cable ferries . Between 1944 and 1948 , the Ann of Wilbur , a tug boat , tugged the Sanpoil barge that was used as a temporary replacement for the McLeod . On September 9 , 1948 , the Martha S. was launched and has been in continual operation since . Since the Martha S. is over seventy years old , the United States Coast Guard requires that the ferry undergo a full drydock inspection every five years . As of 2009 , WSDOT is $ 5 @.@ 5 million US $ short of being able to replace the ferry . Design work has already been completed , but the ferry is not expected to be replaced yet . The Keller Ferry was repaired on February 15 , 2007 to expand its lifespan ; WSDOT detoured traffic onto SR 174 . The Martha S. had a leak that was discovered in October 2009 and is suspended . Traffic has been detoured onto other highways . Ferry service resumed on October 19 , but one of the two engines overheated on October 26 , only one week later , needing to be replaced , thus shutting down the ferry a second time during the same month . Due to the prohibitive cost of having to specially manufacture many replacement parts , the Martha S was retired in July 2013 , and replaced shortly thereafter with the new M / V Sanpoil , which is now the vessel serving the Keller Ferry run .

 HMS Hero was an H @-@ class destroyer built for the Royal Navy in the mid @-@ 1930s . During the Spanish Civil War of 1936 – 1939 the ship enforced the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France on both sides as part of the Mediterranean Fleet . During the first few months of World War II , Hero searched for German commerce raiders in the Atlantic Ocean and participated in the Second Battle of Narvik during the Norwegian Campaign of April – June 1940 before she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in May where she escorted a number of convoys to Malta . The ship took part in the Battle of Cape Spada in July 1940 , Operation Abstention in February 1941 , and the evacuations of Greece and Crete in April – May 1941 . 
 The ship covered an amphibious landing during the Syria – Lebanon Campaign of June 1941 and began escorting supply convoys in June to Tobruk , Libya shortly afterwards . She was damaged by German dive bombers while rescuing survivors from the minelayer Latona in October 1941 and resumed escorting convoys to Malta . Hero participated in the Second Battle of Sirte in March 1942 and in Operation Vigorous in June . She sank two German submarines whilst stationed in the Mediterranean in 1942 , and was transferred back home late in the year to begin converting to an escort destroyer . The ship was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy ( RCN ) in 1943 and renamed HMCS Chaudière . She became part of the Mid @-@ Ocean Escort Force in early 1944 until her transfer back to British coastal waters in May to protect the build @-@ up for Operation Overlord . Together with other ships , she sank three more German submarines during the year . Chaudière was refitting when the war ended in May 1945 and was in poor shape . The ship was paid off in August and later sold for scrap . The process of breaking her up , however , was not completed until 1950 .

 Hero displaced 1 @,@ 350 long tons ( 1 @,@ 370 t ) at standard load and 1 @,@ 883 long tons ( 1 @,@ 913 t ) at deep load . The ship had an overall length of 323 feet ( 98 @.@ 5 m ) , a beam of 33 feet ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) and a draught of 12 feet 5 inches ( 3 @.@ 8 m ) . She was powered by Parsons geared steam turbines , driving two shafts , which developed a total of 34 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 25 @,@ 000 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 36 knots ( 67 km / h ; 41 mph ) . Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3 @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers . Hero carried a maximum of 470 long tons ( 480 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 5 @,@ 530 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 240 km ; 6 @,@ 360 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime , but this increased to 146 in wartime . In Canadian service , the crew numbered 10 officers and 171 men . 
 The ship mounted four 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch Mk IX guns in single mounts , designated ' A ' , ' B ' , ' X ' , and ' Y ' from front to rear . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , Hero had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0 @.@ 5 inch Vickers Mk III machine gun . She was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch torpedoes . One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began . By mid @-@ 1940 , this had increased to 44 depth charges . 
 Ordered on 13 December 1934 from Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company , Hero was subcontracted to Vickers @-@ Armstrongs and laid down by their High Walker Yard at Newcastle @-@ on @-@ Tyne , England , on 28 February 1935 . She was launched on 10 March 1936 and completed on 21 October 1936 . Excluding government @-@ furnished equipment like the armament , the ship cost £ 249 @,@ 858 .

 Most ships of Hero 's class had the rear torpedo tubes replaced by a 12 @-@ pounder AA gun after the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940 , but it is not clear if she underwent this refurbishment as she was deployed in the Mediterranean until 1943 . Other changes made before her conversion to an escort destroyer in 1943 probably included exchanging her two quadruple .50 @-@ calibre Vickers machine guns mounted between her funnels for two Oerlikon 20 mm AA guns , the addition of two Oerlikon guns to her searchlight platform and another pair on the wings of the ship 's bridge . The ship 's director @-@ control tower and rangefinder above the bridge were most likely removed in exchange for a Type 271 target indication radar during the conversion , as was the replacement of ' B ' gun by a Hedgehog anti @-@ submarine spigot mortar , and the addition of a Type 286 short @-@ range surface search radar . Two QF 6 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss guns were fitted on the wings of her bridge to deal with U @-@ boats at short ranges . The ship also received a HF / DF radio direction finder mounted on a pole mainmast . ' Y ' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased . Late in the war , her Type 286 was replaced by a Type 291 radar .

 Hero was assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning . She patrolled Spanish waters during the Spanish Civil War enforcing the policies of the Non @-@ Intervention Committee . Hyperion received a refit in June – July 1939 in the UK and rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet upon its completion . The ship remained in the Mediterranean until 5 October when she was transferred to Freetown , Sierra Leone to search for German commerce raiders . Hero returned to the UK in January 1940 and received a refit at Portsmouth from 15 February to 16 March . In the meantime , the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla had been assigned to Home Fleet and the ship rejoined them when her refit was finished . 
 On 5 April Hero escorted the battlecruiser Renown as she covered the minelayers preparing to implement Operation Wilfred , an operation to lay mines in the Vestfjord to prevent the transport of Swedish iron ore from Narvik to Germany . The ship and her sister Hyperion pretended to lay a minefield off Bud , Norway on 8 April and reported its location to the Norwegians . Hero and the destroyer Foxhound streamed their TSDS minesweeping gear in advance of the battleship Warspite and her escort as they steamed up the Vestfjord to engage the remaining German destroyers at Narvik on 13 April . The ship and four other British destroyers pursued the remaining German ships into the Rombaksfjorden ( the easternmost branch of the Ofotfjord ) , east of Narvik , where the lack of ammunition had forced the German ships to retreat . Most of the German destroyers had scuttled and beached themselves at the head of the fjord , but the scuttling charges on Z18 Hans Lüdemann had failed to detonate properly and she was boarded by a small party from Hero . They found nothing of any significance as she 'd been abandoned by her crew and the destroyer put a torpedo into her to prevent any salvage . 
 Hero was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet on 17 May as part of the reconstituted 2nd Destroyer Flotilla . During the Battle of Cape Spada on 19 July , the ship escorted Australian light cruiser Sydney and rescued some of the 525 survivors from the Italian cruiser Bartolomeo Colleoni together with the other escorting destroyers . Hero , together with her sister , Hostile , and the destroyers Nubian and Mohawk , were ordered to Gibraltar on 22 August where they were to join Force H. Hostile struck a mine en route on the early morning of 23 August off Cap Bon that broke her back . The explosion killed five men and wounded three others . Mohawk took off the survivors while Hero fired two torpedoes to scuttle her . The ship participated in Operation Hats in September , before refitting in Malta during November . She sortied into the North Atlantic when Convoy WS @-@ 5A reported that it had been attacked by the German cruiser Admiral Hipper on 25 December to round up the scattered ships . 
 On 1 January 1941 , Hero was one of the ships that intercepted a Vichy French convoy off Mellila and seized all four merchant ships of the convoy . The ship participated in Operation Excess in early January 1941 and was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet . On 27 February , she evacuated a few surviving commandos from the island of Kastelorizo who had attacked the island in Operation Abstention . In mid @-@ April she escorted the fast transport Breconshire and three battleships from Alexandria to Malta before going on to escort the battleships as they bombarded Tripoli on 20 April . After refueling in Alexandria on 23 April , Hero sailed for Greece to begin evacuating British and Australian troops from the beaches . During the evacuation of Crete , Hero and the destroyer Decoy evacuated the King of Greece and his entourage on the night of 22 / 23 May . 
 Hero escorted the LSI ( L ) Glengyle as she conducted an amphibious landing in early June 1941 on the Lebanese coast during the opening stages of the Operation Exporter . She spent most of the rest of the year escorting convoys to Tobruk . Together with her sister Hotspur and the destroyer Encounter , the ship escorted Latona on 25 October whilst en route to Tobruk . They were attacked by Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers of I. / StG 1 that hit Latona and set her afire . Hero and Encounter came alongside and rescued the crew and passengers before Latona 's magazine exploded , but Hero was damaged by three near misses whilst alongside . The ship returned to Alexandria for repairs and escorted a convoy to Malta in January 1942 . She participated in the 2nd Battle of Sirte on 22 March whilst escorting a convoy to Malta . Together with the Hunt @-@ class destroyers Eridge and Hurworth on 29 May , she sank the German submarine U @-@ 568 north @-@ east of Tobruk , at 32 ° 42 ′ N 24 ° 53 ′ E , and rescued 42 survivors . 
 During Operation Vigorous in June , Hero formed part of the escort for the covering force of the Mediterranean Fleet for the Malta @-@ bound convoy . At time the ship still had not been fitted for radar . After Panzer Army Africa occupied Mersa Matruh in late June , the Admiralty ordered the submarine tenders Medway and the Greek Corinthia transferred to Haifa , but Medway was torpedoed and sunk en route despite the strong escort . Hero and the destroyer Zulu rescued 1105 survivors between them . On 17 August , the ship rescued some 1100 survivors of the torpedoed troopship Princess Marguerite . In conjunction with four other destroyers and a Wellesley light bomber of the Royal Air Force , Hero sank U @-@ 559 60 nautical miles ( 110 km ; 69 mi ) north @-@ east of Port Said on 30 October . The ship was ordered back to the United Kingdom , via the Cape of Good Hope , to be converted to an escort destroyer late in the year . 
 = = = Transfer to the Royal Canadian Navy = = = 
 Her conversion at Portsmouth lasted from April to November 1943 and Hero was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy as a gift on 15 November 1943 and renamed HMCS Chaudière . After working up , the ship was assigned to the Escort Group C2 in February 1944 , based in Derry . On 6 March 1944 , whilst defending Convoy HX 228 west of Ireland , the escorts forced U @-@ 744 to the surface where she surrendered after a 32 @-@ hour hunt . The submarine could not be towed to port and was torpedoed by the British destroyer Icarus . The ship was reassigned to the 11th Escort Group in May 1944 in preparation for Operation Overlord . The group was tasked to protect Allied shipping in the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay and , together with the destroyers Ottawa and Kootenay , the ship sank U @-@ 621 in the Bay of Biscay near La Rochelle on 18 August . Two days later , the same ships sank U @-@ 984 in the Bay of Biscay west of Brest . In November , Chaudière was sent to Sydney , Nova Scotia for a refit . 
 The refit did not begin until late January 1945 and was still in progress when the war ended in May . She was found to be in the worst shape of any Canadian destroyer when inspected and was declared surplus to requirements on 13 June . She was paid off on 17 August 1945 and later sold for scrap to the Dominion Steel Company . Her demolition , however , was not completed until 1950 .

 = Laguna Madre ( United States ) = 
 The Laguna Madre is a long , shallow , hypersaline lagoon along the western coast of the Gulf of Mexico in Nueces , Kenedy , <unk> , Willacy and Cameron Counties in Texas , United States . It is separated by the roughly 20 @-@ mile ( 32 km ) long Saltillo Flats land bridge into Upper and Lower lagoons . The two are joined by the Intracoastal Waterway , which has been dredged through the lagoon . Cumulatively , Laguna Madre is approximately 130 miles ( 209 km ) long , the length of Padre Island . The main extensions include Baffin Bay in Upper Laguna Madre , Red Fish Bay just below the Saltillo Flats , and South Bay near the Mexican border . 
 The lagoon 's ecosystem is protected by the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge and the Padre Island National Seashore , as well as the privately owned King Ranch . The human history predates the formation of the Laguna Madre , and settlements have been established at Port Isabel and Port Mansfield on the lagoon 's shores . 
 = = History = = 
 Laguna Madre was formed about 3 @,@ 000 years ago , after the stabilization of the sea level on the Texas Coast , culminating in the rise of Padre Island . The Baffin Bay extension is considerably older than Laguna Madre , and formed as a river valley during the Pleistocene epoch , over 12 @,@ 000 years ago . Early peoples obtained oysters from the bay , which were eliminated due to changes in salinity after the full formation of Laguna Madre . The first people to encounter the new lagoon were most likely the nomadic Karankawa and Coahuiltecan Indians . The Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda is believed to be the first European to come in contact with Laguna Madre in the early 16th century , and is credited with giving it the name , which is Spanish for " mother lagoon " . 
 Several land grants were handed out by the Spanish government for ranching near the lagoon . The first was believed to have been given to José Nicolás <unk> in 1792 , which included 500 @,@ 000 acres ( 2 @,@ 000 km2 ) in the area south of Baffin Bay to the Rio Grande . <unk> stocked the land with 900 cattle . American ranching settlements developed following the Mexican War , including the King Ranch , which was established in 1847 by Richard King . The area near present @-@ day Port Isabel was used as a resort for Spaniards after <unk> came ashore in the late 18th century looking for freshwater supplies . A settlement known as Point Isabel was established at the location in the 1830s , and in 1853 , the Point Isabel Lighthouse was constructed to overlook the lagoon . The city was named Port Isabel in 1928 , and in 1954 , the Queen Isabella Causeway , the longest bridge in Texas , was constructed across Laguna Madre to South Padre Island . A newer bridge was built in 1974 , but part of it collapsed on September 15 , 2001 after being hit by a barge , causing eight people to plunge to their deaths and significantly hindering the economy of South Texas . It was rebuilt and reopened in November of that year . Port Isabel had 4 @,@ 865 residents during the 2000 census . To the north , Port Mansfield was established in 1950 , at the old fishing community of Red Fish Landing . It was named after United States Congressman Joseph J. Mansfield ( D @-@ TX ) , who introduced the bill that extended the Intracoastal Waterway from Corpus Christi to Brownsville in the 1940s . The Port Mansfield Ship Channel was dredged in 1957 across Padre Island and <unk> in 1962 after work was done to improve the jetties . The cut allows an influx of seawater into the Lower Laguna Madre to improve the fishing and shipping industry of Port Mansfield . The community had 415 residents in 2000 .

 Laguna Madre is found between the mainland of South Texas and Padre Island . At this location between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande , the climate is dry and it is sometimes referred to as the Wild Horse Desert . The western shore , a large part of which is included in the King Ranch , is usually marked by sand dunes , yucca , prickly pear , century plants and an occasional oak tree bent by the wind . The lagoon is split by a 20 @-@ mile ( 32 km ) expanse of sand flats , named the Saltillo Flats , which are located about 40 miles ( 64 km ) from the northern extreme near the John F. Kennedy Memorial Causeway in Corpus Christi . This part of the lagoon is known as the Upper Laguna Madre and includes the extension of Baffin Bay near Kingsville , and Bird Island on the eastern Padre Island shore , northeast of the opening of Baffin Bay . The Lower Laguna Madre includes the area south of the Saltillo Flats to the extension of South Bay near Port Isabel , and is crossed by the Queen Isabella Causeway . Included in the Lower Laguna Madre is Red Fish Bay , which is found along the shoreline of the King Ranch , south to Port Mansfield . 
 The lagoon is shallow and narrow , averaging only 3 @.@ 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) in depth and 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) to 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) in width . The depth is only 0 @.@ 66 feet ( 20 cm ) to 1 @.@ 1 feet ( 34 cm ) in the areas not dredged to form the 12 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) deep , 138 @-@ foot ( 42 m ) wide Gulf Intracoastal Waterway , which runs the bay 's length and joins the upper and lower stretches . Two types of hard reef are found in the lagoon bed and on the shoreline , including beach rock reefs ( shell and sand bound by calcium carbonate cement ) common south of Baffin Bay due to the occasional shifts in the Laguna Madre coastal shoreline ; and <unk> reefs , common in Baffin Bay , and elsewhere in the system , formed between 300 and 3 @,@ 000 years ago by the annelid 's calcareous tubes . 
 Laguna Madre has a salinity of 36 parts per thousand ( ppt ) , which is above the seawater average of 35 ppt . Because of the high salinity , it holds the distinction as one of the Earth 's six hypersaline lagoons / bays , the others being <unk> in Ukraine , Laguna Ojo de Liebre on the west coast of Baja California , Spencer Gulf and Shark Bay in Australia , and the Laguna Madre of Tamaulipas , which is sometimes grouped with the Laguna Madre of Texas as one system . The reasons for its hypersalinity include shallowness , the lack of a significant river source , dry climate , high evaporation and the isolation from other bodies of water . Its salinity was even greater before the Port Mansfield Gulf Channel was dredged on Padre Island , which allowed a larger amount of seawater exchange . However , very little water exchange occurs at all , every second only 25 cubic metres ( 6 @,@ 600 US gal ) of water flows into the lagoon . Rainwater from tropical storms and hurricanes is the only significant fresh water the bay receives . The salinity is greatest in the Lower Laguna Madre , where it averages around 45 ppt . 
 = = Ecosystem = = 
 The Laguna Madre is one of the most important and unspoiled lagoon ecosystems in Texas . It is also one of the most protected in the United States ; 75 % of its shores are protected by the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge to the west and the Padre Island National Seashore on the east . Fish , shrimp and crab , which feed the bird populations , depend on the lagoon and its plentiful beds of seagrass for survival . The seagrass of Laguna Madre accounts for 80 % of all seagrass found off the Texas Coast ; however , it is threatened by brown tides caused by poor circulation and dredging . An influx of seawater can sometimes replace the vital seagrass with oyster beds . 
 Laguna Madre is home to more finfish than anywhere else on the Texas coast , with such species as blue catfish , hardhead catfish , Atlantic croaker , black drum , red drum , southern flounder , alligator gar , <unk> , crevalle jack , southern kingfish , ladyfish , Atlantic midshipman , mojarras , striped mullet , pinfish , Florida <unk> , smooth butterfly ray , spotted seatrout , blacktip shark , sheepshead , <unk> sleeper , gray snapper , common snook , southern <unk> , southern stingray and <unk> . Many fowl migrate and live around the lagoon including 75 % of all redhead ducks . Other birds in the area include the peregrine falcon , piping plover , roseate spoonbill , long @-@ billed curlew , crane , egret and the brown pelican . Sea turtles and dolphins can be found in the bay , while cattle , white @-@ tailed deer , nilgai and bobcats can sometimes be seen near the shore . 
 = = Industry = = 
 The ports of Port Isabel and Port Mansfield rely on the fishing and shrimping industries . In the 1960s , Port Isabel averaged a catch of 3 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 3 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 long tons ; 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 short tons ) of shrimp annually , which accounted for 65 % of the entire production in Texas . In Port Mansfield , the fishing industry has greatly expanded with the opening of the Port Mansfield Channel , allowing a steady accumulation of red fish , brown shrimp , and flounder . Because of the bay 's environmental protections , very few manufacturing plants have been constructed in the area . Following an environmental campaign , the Valero Energy Corporation constructed an oil and gas pipeline from Corpus Christi to the Rio Grande Valley to decrease the shipment of oil and gas along the Intracoastal Waterway , greatly diminishing the chance of a spill . Activists have likewise railed against a proposed wind turbine farm off Baffin Bay , due to the potential harm to the scenic shores and the bird populations . 
 The tourism industry is also a mainstay for communities on the lagoon . Beach @-@ goers must pass the Laguna Madre to reach the prime beaching destination at both North and South Padre Islands . Fishing has drawn tourists to Port Isabel , where the Texas International Fishing Tournament has been held since 1934 . Visitors also flock to Bird Island off the western coast of Padre Island , for windsurfing , kayaking , and other water sports .

 Body Talk Pt . 2 is the sixth studio album by Swedish recording artist Robyn . It was released on 6 September 2010 , by <unk> Records . The album is the second part of the Body Talk trilogy , which consists of three mini @-@ albums , all released during 2010 . Robyn started working on songs for the album when Body Talk Pt . 1 ( 2010 ) was still in development , and she collaborated with Klas Åhlund , Kleerup , Savage Skulls , Diplo , Snoop Dogg and <unk> . Musically , the songs on Body Talk Pt . 2 are upbeat and a mixture between electro , house , hip hop and disco . 
 Critical reception of the album was generally positive . Although critics felt that it lacked a classic single and considered it a minor letdown compared to Body Talk Pt . 1 , it received praise for being solid and club @-@ ready . In Sweden , the album reached the top of the Sverigetopplistan chart . It also reached number one in Denmark and number three in Norway . In the United States , it peaked at number forty @-@ one , becoming Robyn 's highest position on the chart . 
 " Hang with Me " was released as the album 's only single in August 2010 . An acoustic version of the song was featured on Body Talk Pt . 1 . The single reached the top ten in Sweden and Norway . The last track on the album , " Indestructible " , appears in acoustic form and was later remixed and served as the lead single for Body Talk , the final installment in the trilogy . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 In February 2010 , Robyn announced in an interview with Swedish magazine Bon that she would release three albums during 2010 . She noted that it had been five years since she released her last effort , Robyn ( 2005 ) , and that she had not been in the studio " properly " since then . She explained that she did not want to wait until all the songs had been recorded ; she rather wanted to split up the songs in three different releases . She chose to name the trilogy Body Talk after a gay club in London that a friend of hers owns , commenting that the title " tickles [ her ] imagination " . In June 2010 , the first in the trilogy , Body Talk Pt . 1 , was released , and was quickly followed by the announcement of Body Talk Pt . 2 . The album 's lead single , " Hang with Me " and the track " Indestructible " , were among the first songs to be recorded for the trilogy . Robyn said that " we saved them for later because I knew they would be singles , or could be singles , and I wanted them to get that chance . " " Hang with Me " was originally recorded in 2002 , by Klas Åhlund 's then @-@ wife , Paola Bruna , for her album <unk> Girl . 
 The songs on the album were written at the same time as the songs on Body Talk Pt . 1 . In mid @-@ July 2010 , music magazine Billboard reported that the mixing of the songs had been completed . Robyn worked primary with Swedish producer and songwriter Klas Åhlund , who was heavily involved in the production of Body Talk Pt . 1 . Unlike the first installment , Body Talk Pt . 2 saw Robyn working with a few producers apart from Åhlund , such as Diplo , Kleerup , <unk> and electronic duo Savage Skulls . She also worked with American rapper Snoop Dogg on the song " U Should Know Better " . The two originally met when Robyn was asked to sing vocals on a remix of his single " Sexual Eruption " ( 2007 ) . Six months later , they met up once again to write and record " U Should Know Better . " While being interviewed by Billboard , Robyn spoke of the experience of working with the rapper , stating , " It was really cool to be able to be in the studio with him , first because I always was a fan but also because he was really creative and we had so much of an exchange in being there together , both as vocalists . I had an idea and he really got it and got into it , which was awesome . " She also worked with Savage Skulls on two songs on the album ; " Love Kills " and the iTunes exclusive " Bad Gal " . Robyn spoke of the duo , saying that " these really young guys who are part of a scene that I probably would 've gotten into if I wasn 't away so much when I was younger . "

 According to Tom Ewing of The Guardian , Body Talk Pt . 2 is " faster , harder , [ and ] <unk> " than its predecessor . The writer described it as " the Body Talk for people who like their Robyn upbeat , fierce and dancefloor @-@ ready . " According to Adam Johns of Drowned in Sound , the album marks a departure from Robyn 's " formula of ' creative ' tracks sprinkled through with low @-@ key pop gems . " He recalled her previous work as " high @-@ tech " and said that the songs on Body Talk Pt . 2 are " sprinkled with <unk> @-@ sounding synths , <unk> and minor @-@ key arrangements . " Joe Colly of Pitchfork noted that Robyn " primarily sticks with the quick @-@ moving , clubby synth @-@ pop that is her calling card . " Jaime Gill of BBC Music noted its " beats @-@ driven approach " and the mix between electro , house , hip hop , classic disco and " orchestral , tear @-@ teasing balladry . " 
 The opening track , " In My Eyes " utilizes tingling synths . Colly said that Robyn is " an encouraging den mother " on the song , singing " Little star , I got you . You 'll be okay . " Luke O 'Neill of The Boston Globe said that the song showcases " the tension @-@ and @-@ catharsis approach Robyn is capable of achieving with her vocals . " The second track , " Include Me Out " was referred to as " digitised stop @-@ start funk " . The song begins with the line , " It is really very simple , just a single pulse repeated at a regular interval " , which according to O 'Neill described " the main sonic trick employed on a lot of her dance @-@ ready songs . " On the song , Robyn plays a party @-@ starter that is " <unk> matriarchs and cross @-@ dressers alike " with the line " This one 's for the granny , take a bow ... Come on all you <unk> , click your heels for me . " " Hang with Me " , carries a " fierce , club @-@ wrecking beat " , with " relentlessly energetic bass " and synth arpeggios . Lyrically , the song speaks of trust in a relationship , with lines such as " Just don 't fall recklessly , headlessly in love with me . " Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music said that the song views " the perspective of someone who 's a bit too tightly buttoned @-@ up to let her defences down . " The fourth track , " Love Kills " was described as a " <unk> , sharp @-@ edged " song , with fierce vocals and " haunting Pet Shop Boys flourishes . " " We Dance to the Beat " is a techno song , with an " apocalyptic , big @-@ beat " . It features a " sort of spoken @-@ word hype @-@ up jam " that was compared to " Don 't Fucking Tell Me What to Do " . The song features lines such as " We dance to the beat of your brains not evolving fast enough " and " We dance to the beat of bad <unk> clicking teeth . " 
 The sixth track , " Criminal Intent " features Robyn rapping , which was compared to the rapping style of musician Peaches . The song is about Robyn getting arrested for " freaky dancing " to her own song . Ben Norman of About.com called it " a darker version of [ Robyn 's ] previous rap songs " . Comparisons were also drawn towards " Fembot " from Body Talk Pt . 1 , and " Piece of Me " by Britney Spears . " U Should Know Better " featuring Snoop Dogg was called the album 's highlight by several critics . It features Snoop Dogg rapping over an electro beat and Robyn delivering " quotable , ridiculous lines " , such as " You know when in Rome I sat down with the Romans . Said we need a black Pope and she 'd better be a woman . " Jaime Gill of BBC Music said that the song features " the teen @-@ pop singer and hip hop outlaw swapping louche quips over a relentless , grimy electro stomp . " The acoustic " Indestructible " reflects " the downside of needing someone " . Norman said that it " is sweeping and symphonic and has so much vulnerability and strength in it that you believe she really will love as if she is indestructible . "

 Body Talk Pt . 2 received mostly positive reviews from music critics . At Metacritic , which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 76 , based on 23 reviews , which indicates " generally favorable reviews " . Jaime Gill of BBC Music called the album a " brief , brilliant record that leaves you panting , Body Talk , Part 2 is the latest evidence that Robyn is probably the best , most versatile pop star currently at work . " Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine referred to the album as " pretty fucking fantastic " , despite stating that it was " a minor letdown following the near @-@ perfection of its predecessor " . Tom Ewing of The Guardian said that " the second episode [ in the trilogy ] has a different flavour from the first . " Ewing named " U Should Know Better " the best song on the record , calling it the " unlikeliest success " . In contrast , he considered " Criminal Intent " the worst song , but said that " even that has a lovely , draggy vibe . " Dan Martin of the NME wrote that the album " doesn 't quite end with a severed hand , but it does swing a little lower with an awesomeness that tries less hard to be liked straight away . " 
 Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone wrote that the album " offers up another batch of great , club @-@ ready songs that are a touch too weird for American hit radio . Robyn sings and raps about standard diva themes ( dance @-@ floor ecstasy , self @-@ reliance ) , but the music is deliciously wacked @-@ out . " Pitchfork 's Joe Colly felt the album needed a " classic single on par with ' Dancing on My Own ' or ' [ With Every ] Heartbeat ' " , but concluded , " Minor quibbles and missteps aside , Body Talk Pt . 2 is a perfectly solid — and occasionally awesome — record . " Heather Phares of Allmusic wrote that through the album , Robyn proves " that stylish , cutting @-@ edge pop doesn 't have to be competitive or egotistical . " Adam Johns of Drowned in Sound was mixed in his review , writing that " While it 's a fairly remarkable piece of craft , her icy disco diversion here leaves me somewhat flat [ ... ] It should satisfy the listeners who primarily show up for Creative Robyn . " Luke Winkie of musicOMH wrote a mixed review as well , saying that " Pt 2 doesn 't have the same feel [ as Pt 1 ] ; it 's as if Robyn may have exhausted her supply of great songs too soon . It has its moments , but in general just doesn 't compare to Pt 1 . "

 = Canadian horse = 
 The Canadian horse is a horse breed from Canada . It is a strong , well @-@ muscled breed of horse , usually dark in colour . The horses are generally used for riding and driving . Descended from draft and light riding horses imported to Canada in the late 1600s , it was later crossed with other British and American breeds . During the 18th century the Canadian horse spread throughout the northeastern US , where it contributed to the development of several horse breeds . During the peak popularity of the breed , three subtypes could be distinguished , a draft horse type , a trotting type and a pacing type . Thousands of horses were exported in the 19th century , many of whom were subsequently killed while acting as cavalry horses in the American Civil War . These exports decreased the purebred Canadian population almost to the point of extinction , prompting the formation of a studbook and the passage of a law against further export . 
 Experimental breeding programs in the early 20th century succeeded in re @-@ establishing the breed to some extent , but mechanization , combined with two world wars , again resulted in the breed almost becoming extinct . In the 1980s , concerned with the declining population numbers , interested breeders undertook a promotional program , which resulted in renewed interest in the breed . By the 1990s , population numbers were higher , and genetic studies in 1998 and 2012 found relatively high levels of genetic diversity for a small breed . However , livestock conservation organizations still consider the breed to be at risk , due to low population numbers . 
 = = Breed characteristics = = 
 Most Canadian Horses are dark coloured : black , bay , or brown . A few chestnuts are found , occasionally with flaxen manes and tails , and the cream gene appears in the breed as the result of the genetic influence of one stallion . While some sources state that the gene for gray is no longer found in the breed , after the genetic bottleneck of the late 20th century , the preservation society for the breed states that they can be " rarely grey " . Their height averages 14 to 16 hands ( 56 to 64 inches , 142 to 163 cm ) and stallions average 1 @,@ 050 to 1 @,@ 350 pounds ( 480 to 610 kg ) in weight , while mares weigh 1 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 250 pounds ( 450 to 570 kg ) . 
 The Canadian horse has a rather short , high @-@ set head with a broad forehead . The neck is arched and graceful , and the chest , back and loins broad and strongly muscled . The shoulders and croup are sloping , with a relatively high @-@ set tail . Overall , the breed gives the impression of strength and agility . Their heavy and wavy mane and tail , arched necks and finely boned heads are all reminiscent of Andalusian and Barb ancestry . Their trot is described as flashy . They are hardy horses and easy keepers . Today , most Canadian horses are used as riding and driving horses , and are known for their jumping ability . They are seen in competition in almost every discipline , as well as for leisure riding . They can also be found in light draft work , trail riding , and working as a stock horse . 
 Unlike most breeds , there is a set naming system that is used to identify individuals based on the registration format employed by the Canadian Livestock Records Corporation . First comes the prefix , the farm or breeding establishment of which the foal was born into , followed by the sire 's name , and lastly the given name for the foal . Each year a different letter is assigned to begin the given name for the foal , and it is by the year 's letter that the foal is named . Some older horses do not fall under this naming strategy , but it is now mandatory in naming registered offspring coming from purebred Canadian lines . Originally , horses were tattooed with identification numbers , but now <unk> is the identification technology chosen by the breed registry . 
 = = History = = 
 The Canadian Horse descended from the French stock Louis XIV sent to Canada in the late 17th century . The initial shipment , in 1665 , consisted of two stallions and twenty mares from the Royal Stables in Normandy and Brittany , the center of French horse breeding . Only 12 of the 20 mares survived the trip . Two more shipments followed , one in 1667 of 14 horses ( mostly mares , but with at least one stallion ) , and one in 1670 of 11 mares and a stallion . The shipments included a mix of draft horses and light horses , the latter of which included both pacing and trotting horses . The exact origins of all the horses are unknown , although the shipments probably included Bretons , Normans , Arabians , Andalusians and Barbs . 
 The horses were leased to gentleman farmers or religious orders for money or in exchange for a foal , and they remained the property of the king for three years . Despite poor conditions and hard work , the horses thrived in Canada , and were given nicknames that included " the little iron horse " and " the horse of steel " . Population numbers rose quickly from the early stock , with 148 horses by 1679 , 218 horses by 1688 , 684 by 1698 , and by 1709 , enough that the government limited farmers to owning two horses and a foal , with additional horses to be slaughtered , although this law was a failure in terms of enforcement . During the 1700s , the " French Canadian Horse " spread through what is now eastern Michigan and Illinois in the United States , and lived a generally feral existence , with many escaping human control completely . During the Expulsion of the Acadians in the mid @-@ 18th century , the English seized the livestock of the Acadians , including horses . Some of these animals were transported to Sable Island , where their descendents became the Sable Island horse . In the late 18th century , imported horses from the US and the British Isles were crossbred with existing Canadian stock . By the 19th century , they were found performing light draft work , as well as riding and driving duties . Cornelius <unk> , a 19th @-@ century Canadian painter , was known for his works featuring the Canadian horse , who he usually showed in association with the French habitants , as opposed to the English settlers in the area . His paintings generally portrayed the Canadian horse in a utilitarian , workhorse role , often in winter scenes . 
 In 1849 , there were estimated to be more than 150 @,@ 000 Canadian horses , and many were exported from Canada annually . Some were shipped to the West Indies , where they possibly contributed to gaited breeds such as the Paso Fino . By the middle of the 19th century , Canadian horses had spread through the northeastern US , where they were used for racing , as roadsters , and , due to their stamina , to pull freight wagons and stagecoaches . Many played a role in the development of other breeds , including the Morgan horse , the American Saddlebred and the Standardbred . Although used extensively in the US , no efforts were made to establish a purebred population , studbook , or breed association in that country . Thousands of horses imported to the US from Canada were used as artillery and cavalry horses in the American Civil War , where many were killed . One equine historian states that " The Canadian horse played a major role in the history of that war ; it has even been said that the North won simply on the fact that its soldiers had the better horse – the Canadian . " 
 By 1880 , through exports and war casualties , Canadian horses had almost become extinct . In 1885 , the Canadian Horse Breeders Association was formed to inspect and approve breeding stock with the aim of creating a studbook for the breed , and in 1886 , further export from Canada was forbidden by Quebec law . In 1913 , an experimental breeding program was begun at Cap @-@ Rouge by the Canadian government . The program 's goal was to breed larger horses that retained the endurance and vitality for which the breed was known , and succeeded in increasing the size of stallions to 15 @.@ 2 to 16 hands ( 62 to 64 inches , 157 to 163 cm ) high and 1 @,@ 200 to 1 @,@ 500 pounds ( 540 to 680 kg ) in weight , with mares slightly smaller . However , mechanization , combined with World War I and World War II , ended the federal breeding program , and in 1940 all breeding stock was sold at auction . However , the province of Quebec re @-@ established the program at Deschambault . The program lasted there until 1979 , when the herd was again disbanded and sold at auction . 
 = = = 1970s to present = = = 
 By the 1970s , the popularity of the breed had decreased significantly , and there were approximately 400 Canadian horses worldwide , with only around five annual registrations between 1970 and 1974 . Several interested breeders began a campaign of preservation and promotion , which resulted in a Canadian team winning the 1987 North American Driving Championships . Popularity began to increase , and by the mid @-@ 1990s population numbers were between 2 @,@ 500 and 3 @,@ 000 , and The Livestock Conservancy , which had classified the breed as " critical " , changed its designation to " rare " . With the increase in popularity came pressure for the breed standard to change to meet modern show and market trends , by breeding for taller horses with more refinement . In 2002 , the Canadian Horse Heritage and Preservation Society was formed in response to these pressures , with a goal of preserving the original Canadian horse type . The Canadian Horse Breeders Association remains the official registering body for the Canadian horse , as governed by the Canadian federal Animal Pedigree Act , with the responsibility to " monitor registration , identification , and the keeping of the stud book for Canadian horses " . It is also responsible for inspecting breeding stock before they are registered with the studbook . The studbook is maintained by the Canadian Livestock Records Corporation . Since the beginning of the studbook , there have been over 13 @,@ 600 horses registered . In 2012 , 208 new horses were registered , mainly in Quebec . The Livestock Conservancy still considers the breed to be threatened , a designation given to breeds with a global population of less than 5 @,@ 000 and annual US registrations of fewer than 1 @,@ 000 . Rare Breeds Canada considers the breed to be at risk , with fewer than 500 annual registrations of female breeding stock . 
 In a study of mitochondrial DNA published in 2012 , the Canadian horse and the Newfoundland pony were found to be the most genetically diverse of the Canadian breeds studied , which also included the Sable Island horse and the Lac La Croix pony . The Canadian horse showed high haplotype diversity , sharing haplotypes with all Canadian populations , as well as draft breeds , Nordic pony breeds and British mountain and moorland pony breeds also tested in the study . The Canadian horse had been shown to be related to draft horse breeds , including the Percheron , Belgian and Clydesdale , in previous microsatellite loci studies . This relationship was supported by findings in the 2012 study . The high levels of diversity in the Canadian horse supported the conclusions of a 1998 study , which determined that the small population size and historical genetic bottlenecks had not resulted in a significant loss of genetic variation . The 1998 paper also stated that the Canadian horse did not show inbreeding any more significant than other , more popular , breeds . 
 The Canadian horse is a common animal symbol of Canada . In 1909 , the Canadian Parliament declared it the national breed of the country , and in 2002 was made an official animal symbol of Canada by Parliamentary Act . In 2010 , the provincial legislature of Quebec named it a heritage breed of the province . 
 = = Sub @-@ types = = 
 During the peak popularity of the breed , three main types could be distinguished . All three are now considered extinct , having disappeared or been merged back into the main Canadian horse population . The first , the Canadian Heavy Draft or St. Lawrence , which disappeared by the late 1700s , probably developed from Shire and Clydesdale crosses . They were probably a popular export to New England , which bred large numbers of horses for Caribbean plantations . The second , the <unk> , sometimes also called the St. Lawrence , was a trotting horse known for its power and speed , resulting from crosses with Thoroughbreds . Mixed with French trotting lines , they played a role in the development of the US trotting horses . 
 = = = Canadian Pacer = = = 
 The third type was the Canadian Pacer , which was historically better documented than the other two types . Canadian Pacers were likely the result of breeding pacing horses imported from France with Narragansett Pacers from New England . The resulting horses were known for their ability to race on ice . From there , they were exported to the United States , where North Carolina became a breeding center , later exporting them to Tennessee in the late 1700s . Pedigrees were not maintained , so early breeding histories are often impossible to trace . The Canadian Pacer influenced the Tennessee Walker , the American Saddlebred and the Standardbred . 
 Commonly called " Canucks " , the fastest members of the breed came from Quebec near the St. Lawrence River . Racing began in this area during the long , severe winters , when Sunday races after attending church for Mass became common . Eventually these races became large enough to endanger the church @-@ going populace , and races were banned within a certain distance of churches . They instead moved to local rivers , whose smooth , frozen surfaces provided useful raceways , and the resulting contests drew attention to the pacers from Quebec . 
 Several horses imported to the United States from Canada had a lasting impact on American horse breeding . In the early 1800s , a roan @-@ coloured stallion named <unk> was imported to Lexington , Kentucky from Quebec , through Michigan . He began to be offered for stud service in 1816 , and his progeny spread throughout the eastern US . Known mainly as saddle stock , they also included several pacing horses . Another roan stallion , Tom Hal , a successful pacer in his own right , founded an important family of pacers in the US . Appearing in Kentucky in 1824 , he was offered for stud , and his offspring ( many of whom carried on the family name , being differentiated only by the name of the owner ) began the family of Standardbreds that included Little Brown Jug , Brown Hal , Star Pointer , Adios and Good Time , all champion harness racing horses . Another pacing import to the US was a black stallion named Old Pilot , said to have been bred near Montreal , who originated the Pilot family of trotting horses . Old Pilot produced a son , also named Pilot , who was acclaimed as a sire of trotting horses , as well as being a successful harness horse himself . 
 = Key ( company ) = 
 Key is a Japanese visual novel studio which formed on July 21 , 1998 as a brand under the publisher VisualArt 's and is located in Kita , Osaka , Japan . Key released their debut visual novel Kanon in June 1999 , which combined an elaborate storyline , an up @-@ to @-@ date anime @-@ style drawing style , and a musical score which helped to set the mood for the game . Key 's second game Air released in September 2000 had a similar if not more complex storyline to Kanon and a more thorough gameplay . Both Kanon and Air were originally produced as adult games , but Key broke this trend with their third title Clannad which was released in April 2004 for all ages . Key has worked in the past with Interchannel and Prototype for the consumer port releases of the brand 's games . Key collaborated with P.A. Works and Aniplex to produce the anime series Angel Beats ! ( 2010 ) and Charlotte ( 2015 ) . The brand 's ninth game Rewrite was released in June 2011 , and a fan disc for the game titled Rewrite Harvest festa ! was released in July 2012 . The first volume in the six @-@ part Angel Beats ! episodic visual novel was released in June 2015 . Key will release the kinetic novel Harmonia in 2016 . 
 Co @-@ founder Jun Maeda is a prominent figure in the brand , having contributed to the planning , scenario , and music composition in the majority of Key 's visual novels . Itaru Hinoue , also a co @-@ founder , is Key 's main artist and was the art director for Key 's first three games . Na @-@ Ga , another prominent artist in the brand , mainly worked with background art in earlier games , but with Key 's sixth game Little Busters ! was given the position of co @-@ art director with Hinoue . Shinji Orito , Key 's main composer and another co @-@ founder , has composed music for the majority of Key 's titles . Yūto Tonokawa , a scenario writer , first worked on the scenario in Little Busters ! . 
 Key has been an active participant at the Comiket convention since Comiket 57 in December 1999 , where they sold Kanon @-@ related products ; Key 's latest appearance at Comiket was at Comiket 89 in December 2015 . In 2001 , VisualArt 's created the record label Key Sounds Label to release music albums and singles with music related to Key 's visual novels . Between December 2007 and August 2010 , Key produced an Internet radio show called Key Net Radio in regards to the brand .

 Before forming Key , the founding members worked for another visual novel development company called Nexton under the brand Tactics . At the time of Dōsei 's production , Tactics ' first game , four of Key 's original staff worked on the game : Itaru Hinoue as art director , Shinji Orito as musical composer , and Miracle Mikipon and Shinory contributing to the computer graphics . After Dōsei , the rest of Key 's founding staff — Naoki Hisaya , Jun Maeda and OdiakeS — joined Tactics and contributed to two more games : Moon released on November 21 , 1997 , and One : Kagayaku Kisetsu e released on May 29 , 1998 . Due to differing opinions between Nexton and most of the production staff in Tactics on how to produce the brand 's next game , most of Tactics ' staff left Nexton to pursue work in another publishing company where they could have the freedom to produce their next game . 
 Itaru Hinoue , who had previously worked at VisualArt 's once before , introduced Key 's founding members to the president of VisualArt 's , Takahiro Baba . Baba gave the developers the freedom they desired , and they officially transferred to VisualArt 's where they formed Key on July 21 , 1998 . With the production of Key 's debut title Kanon still in its early stages , a brand name had still not been decided on by the developers . The tentative brand name was Azurite ( <unk> , <unk> ) at first , but Jun Maeda was not pleased with this and wanted a name that would capture the image of the brand . Maeda came upon the name Key when he saw it on a sign for a musical instrument store he would always pass on his way to work and instantly liked the name . The name Key for the studio was ultimately decided by majority rule . Key released Kanon on June 4 , 1999 as an adult game , though the scenes containing adult content were kept to a minimum . This gave the player more of a focus on the characters ' stories and on the visuals and music , especially for a visual novel at the time of its release . A year later , on September 8 , 2000 , Key released their second game Air , which was also an adult game and similar in storytelling to Kanon . 
 Key 's third game Clannad is a visual novel similar to Key 's previous games , but contains no adult content . Clannad was meant to be released in 2002 , but was delayed , leading to the game finally being released on April 28 , 2004 . Seven months after Clannad 's release , Key released their shortest game , Planetarian : The Reverie of a Little Planet , on November 29 , 2004 with a rating for all ages . Planetarian , in contrast to Key 's past games , is a linear visual novel that does not require the user to make choices during gameplay ; this is what is referred to as a kinetic novel . The brand 's fifth game is Tomoyo After : It 's a Wonderful Life , an adult game and spin @-@ off to Clannad released on November 25 , 2005 , which expanded on the scenario of the heroine Tomoyo Sakagami from Clannad . Key released their sixth game , Little Busters ! , on July 27 , 2007 with no adult content , but released another version of the game entitled Little Busters ! Ecstasy on July 25 , 2008 with added adult content , story , and visuals . 
 In commemoration of Key 's ten @-@ year anniversary , Key and VisualArt 's held a two @-@ day event between February 28 and March 1 , 2009 called " Key 10th Memorial Fes : Ano Hi kara <unk> Bokura no Toki o Kizamu Uta " ( ～ <unk> ～ ) . Key collaborated with P.A. Works and Aniplex to produce the anime series Angel Beats ! that aired between April and June 2010 . Key 's eighth game Kud Wafter was released on June 25 , 2010 as an adult spin @-@ off of Little Busters ! , which expanded on the scenario of the heroine Kudryavka Noumi from Little Busters ! and Ecstasy . Key released their ninth game Rewrite on June 24 , 2011 with a rating for all ages , and an all ages fan disc to Rewrite titled Rewrite Harvest festa ! was released on July 27 , 2012 . In commemoration of Key 's 15 @-@ year anniversary , the first volume in the six @-@ part Angel Beats ! episodic visual novel , Angel Beats ! -1st beat- , was released on June 26 , 2015 . Key again collaborated with P.A. Works and Aniplex to produce the anime series Charlotte that aired between July and September 2015 . Key is aiming to release the kinetic novel Harmonia in 2016 , and it will be released on Steam in English before it is released in Japan . 
 = = = Key Sounds Label = = = 
 In 2001 , VisualArt 's created the record label Key Sounds Label ( KSL ) . The music albums and singles released by Key after this were put under this label , meaning that this does not include the first two albums and one single which were released before it was officially formed . The first album on this label was Humanity ... , though the only direct connection to Key 's works is that it contains a remixed version of the opening theme to Air . The albums under the label are mainly composed by Key 's signature composers : Jun Maeda , Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi . Three of the singles feature songs sung by Lia and one album , Love Song , features the singer Riya from Eufonius . Three drama CDs have been released as well . 
 To celebrate Key 's ten @-@ year anniversary , Key hosted a concert called KSL Live World 2008 : Way to the Little Busters ! EX on May 10 , 2008 in Tokyo , Japan , and again on May 17 , 2008 in Osaka , Japan . Each time , the concert lasted for two and a half hours and featured songs sung by Lia , Rita , Chata , and Tomoe Tamiyasu who have previously sung songs for singles and albums released under Key Sounds Label . Another concert called KSL Live World 2010 : Way to the Kud @-@ Wafter was held in Tokyo between May 21 – 22 , 2010 . A third content called KSL Live World 2013 : Way to the Little Busters ! Refrain was held in Koto , Tokyo on September 16 , 2013 . A fourth concert called KSL Live World : Way to the Angel Beats ! -1st- was held in Akihabara , Tokyo on April 11 and April 12 , 2015 .

 = = = Key Net Radio = = = 
 Key produced 30 episodes of an Internet radio show called Key Net Radio ( <unk> , Key Raji ) in regards to the brand between December 13 , 2007 and August 30 , 2010 . It was hosted by Shinji Orito and Itaru Hinoue of Key , and another woman named Chiro who works for Pekoe , another visual novel studio under VisualArt 's . Listeners could submit thoughts about the show and any requests they may have for the show , along with submitting questions to the host trio . The broadcasts were available via download on Key 's official website and were available for download on the radio show 's official blog for the first nine broadcasts . The broadcasts could also be listened to on VisualArt 's ' YouTube channel named Visual Channel . 
 For the first six episodes , the show had five corners , or parts , which started with opening greetings from the hosts and went on to thoughts and impressions that listeners had about the show . This moved on to an informal talk between the hosts , followed by a section where entries previously submitted by listeners concerning their enthusiasm for Key were read by the hosts . The fourth corner concerned answering questions that had been submitted by listeners , and the final corner had Orito playing the flute ; listeners could submit suggestions for songs he was to play . Two more corners were added starting with the seventh broadcast . The first corner added concerns scary stories that the hosts can tell themselves , or read from submissions by listeners , and was added partly because Hinoue enjoys such stories . The second corner added deals with submissions by listeners describing a new fictional character , and Hinoue takes these submissions and forms a new fictional character out of combining elements from multiple submissions together . During the broadcasts , tracks from the soundtracks released under Key Sounds Label play in the background . 
 = = = Comiket involvement = = = 
 Comiket , short for Comic Market , is a large comic convention held twice a year in Tokyo , Japan during August and December , which are referred to as the summer and winter Comic Markets , respectively . Key has been an active participant in the convention since Comiket 57 in December 1999 , where they sold Kanon @-@ related products ( as Kanon was their only release at the time ) ; one such product was a Zippo lighter . The first Air @-@ related products Key sold at the convention were at Comiket 59 in December 2000 . Typical products include : postcards , telephone cards , calendars , posters , and albums . The products Key sells at Comiket are all related to the visual novels the brand produces . 
 Key , through VisualArt 's , generally participates at the winter Comiket in conjunction with other brands under VisualArt 's , but has been known to appear at the summer Comiket too , such as with Comiket 70 in August 2006 where they sold Planetarian : The Reverie of a Little Planet related products . The combined total of the products Key sells at a given Comiket range in price between 3 @,@ 000 and 5 @,@ 000 yen . This includes the selling of music albums released under Key 's record label Key Sounds Label which has been releasing albums since Comiket 60 in August 2001 with the release of the label 's first two albums , Humanity ... and " Natsukage / Nostalgia " . If there are any unsold products by the end of a given Comiket , VisualArt 's has been known to set up an online mail order to sell the remaining goods from all the brands under VisualArt 's that participated at Comiket . After Comiket 73 in December 2007 , VisualArt 's started taking mail orders on March 4 , 2008 , and only six days later on March 10 , 2008 , Key reported that all of Key 's goods sold at Comiket 73 were now sold out . At the end of the second day of Comiket 75 in December 2008 , all of Key 's goods at the convention were sold out .

 Key 's main staff members are attached to the visual novel studio , and therefore VisualArt 's . One of the founding members of Key , Jun Maeda , has worked on the planning for the individual projects and was one of the main scenario writers ; he has also composed music for the majority of Key 's games . Maeda stepped down as the main scenario writer after Little Busters ! Ecstasy , but continues to work on the music for Key 's games . Itaru Hinoue , another founding member , is Key 's main artist and was the sole art director and character designer for four of Key 's games . Na @-@ Ga , another prominent artist in the brand , mainly worked with background art in earlier games , but was first given the position of co @-@ art director with Hinoue with Little Busters ! . Further computer graphics have been provided in the past by Shinory and Mochisuke , two graphic artists in Key . Shinji Orito , another founding member and Key 's main composer , has composed music for the majority of Key 's games . With Maeda no longer contributing to the scenario , scenario writer Yūto Tonokawa joined Key and first worked on the scenario in Little Busters ! . 
 = = = Former and outsourced = = = 
 Many of Key 's staff have left the brand over time , or have been employed as outsourced contributors . Naoki Hisaya had worked as one of the main scenario writers for Kanon , but once the project was complete , he left the brand ; Hisaya later provided the original concept for Sola . Another member of the staff that made Kanon was OdiakeS , an outsourced composer who has since helped Key with two music albums , one each released for Air and Clannad , but has done nothing with Key since 2004 . Three staff members only worked with Key on Air : Takashi Ishikawa as one of the scenario writers , Kazuki Fujii as a scenario assistant , and Din as a background artist . Air and Clannad had Tōya Okano and Kai who contributed as scenario writers ; Kai later headed the planning and design of Kud Wafter . One of the original computer graphics artists , Miracle Mikipon , left after Clannad . Two other outsourced graphic artists , Minimo Tayama and Torino , have often contributed on Key 's games . 
 Scenario writer Yūichi Suzumoto worked with Key between Air and Planetarian . Eeji Komatsu worked as the art director for Planetarian , and another artist , Fumio , worked as the art director for Tomoyo After . Leo Kashida worked as an outsourced writer with Key on Tomoyo After and Little Busters ! . Chika Shirokiri , another outsourced writer who worked with Key on Little Busters ! , also wrote the scenario for Kud Wafter . Manack and members of PMMK composed music in Little Busters ! , and members of MintJam helped with arrangement . Magome Togoshi had been with Key since before Kanon 's release , working as one of the signature composers , but left the brand in October 2006 after contributing to the soundtrack of Little Busters ! . Jun 'ichi Shimizu composed all the music in Kud Wafter . Two outsourced writers worked on the scenario for Rewrite : Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion , and Romeo Tanaka .

 According to Satoshi <unk> 's work , A History of Adult Games , Key 's impact on the visual novel ( primarily the adult game variant ) world stems from before Key was formed and most of the founding members of Key worked for Tactics under Nexton . Due to an influence by Leaf 's visual novel To Heart released in 1997 , the developers at Tactics created a simple formula for a game : a comedic first half with a heart @-@ warming romantic middle followed by a tragic separation and finally an emotional reunion formed what is known as a " crying game " or " nakige " . The main purpose of such a game is to make the player feel for the characters and make them cry due to emotional scenarios which serves to leave a bigger impact on the player after the game is over . Tactics ' second title One : Kagayaku Kisetsu e was created based on this formula . 
 After One was complete , the development team quit Tactics to form Key where they developed their first title Kanon also based upon this formula . Kanon was " heavily hyped [ and ] had gamers impatient until its release . It was only one game released by Key so far , and yet [ it ] had already sent major shockwaves around the industry . And yet another game [ Air ] , two years later , sent even more shockwaves . Air was equally hyped and well received . " The success of One and Kanon on Key 's formula to create a " crying game " was later adopted by other visual novel developing companies which were influenced by this formula . Examples of this include : Kana : Little Sister by Digital Object , the Memories Off series by KID , D.C. : Da Capo by Circus , Snow by Studio Mebius ( also under VisualArt 's ) , and Wind : A Breath of Heart by Minori . 
 Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion wrote in 2004 how he was influenced by Key 's works during the planning of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni . Ryukishi07 played Key 's games as a reference , among other visual novels , and analyzed them to figure out the reason why they were found to be so popular . He figured that the secret was due to how the stories would start with ordinary , enjoyable days , but then a sudden occurrence would happen leading the player to cry due to the shock value . He used a similar model for the basis of Higurashi but instead of leading the player to cry , Ryukishi07 wanted to scare the player with the addition of horror elements . In this way , Ryukishi07 wished to be in some way associated with Key who he described as a " masterpiece maker " .

 = = = Leaf , Key BBS = = = 
 A bulletin board system ( BBS ) based on the interface of the large Japanese Internet forum 2channel ( 2ch ) was formed on January 26 , 2000 named " Leaf , Key BBS " ( leaf , <unk> , leaf , key <unk> ) , otherwise nicknamed as " Leaf @-@ Key Board " ( <unk> , Ha @-@ Kagi Ita ) . The board originated from 2ch 's video game discussion board due to a dispute involving the game Kizuato in December 1999 ; Kizuato was an early game of another visual novel producing brand named Leaf . Ultimately , fans of the game moved to 2ch 's adult game board , but there was not much resolution , and at the time Key fans on the board were being shunned for discussions on Kanon and , at the time , Key 's upcoming game Air . This resulted finally with the Leaf and Key fans moving away from 2ch and forming again on the <unk> Internet forum . The board serves as a discussion board for anything related to Leaf and Key . This includes the games the companies produce , but also the companies themselves and the staff that make up those companies . The BBS gets approximately 900 posts per day as of March 2010 . Like 2ch , the board has a default anonymous posting setting , and the default name is " <unk> @-@ san <unk> " ( <unk> , lit . " Mr. Nameless @-@ <unk> " ) , a reference to the heroine Mizuka Nagamori from One : Kagayaku Kisetsu e who uses the words " dayo " and " mon " frequently . 
 = Battle of Verrières Ridge = 
 The Battle of Verrières Ridge was a series of engagements fought as part of the Battle of Normandy , in western France , during the Second World War . The main combatants were two Canadian infantry divisions — with additional support from the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade — against elements of three German SS Panzer divisions . The battle was part of the British and Canadian attempts to break out of Caen , and took place from 19 – 25 July 1944 , being part of both Operation Atlantic ( 18 – 21 July ) and Operation Spring ( 25 – 27 July ) . 
 The immediate Allied objective was Verrières Ridge , a belt of high ground which dominates the route from Caen to Falaise . The ridge was invested by battle @-@ hardened German veterans , who had fallen back from Caen and entrenched to form a strong defensive position . Over the course of six days , substantial Canadian and British forces made repeated attempts to capture the ridge . Strict German adherence to defensive doctrine , as well as strong and effective counterattacks by Panzer formations , resulted in heavy Allied casualties for little strategic gain . 
 From the perspective of the Canadian 1st Army , the battle is remembered for its tactical and strategic miscalculations — the most notable being a highly controversial attack by the Royal Highland Regiment ( Black Watch ) of Canada on 25 July . This attack — the costliest single day for a Canadian battalion since the 1942 Dieppe Raid — has become one of the most contentious and critically analysed events in Canadian military history . 
 = = Background = = 
 Verrières Ridge lies 8 km ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) south of the city of Caen , overlooking broad plains and dominating the countryside between Caen and Falaise . Although a major D @-@ Day objective for Commonwealth forces , the Allied push inland was halted short of Caen and positional warfare ensued until the first week of July . On 9 July , Operation Charnwood succeeded in taking the northern half of the city , but the I SS Panzer Corps — under the command of SS @-@ <unk> Josef Dietrich — thwarted British ambitions . A week later , Operation Goodwood renewed the British offensive , and Caen finally fell on 19 July , although by this time the city had been largely devastated . The next Anglo @-@ Canadian goal was the town of Falaise , but Verrières Ridge — now strongly defended by the I SS Panzer Corps — stood in their path . Elements of the British 2nd Army secured part of the adjacent Bourguébus Ridge and managed to gain a foothold on Verrières Ridge but were unable to dislodge its German defenders . 
 = = Forces involved = = 
 The Canadian II Corps — commanded by Lieutenant @-@ General Guy Simonds — initially assigned two infantry divisions and one armoured brigade to the assault on the German positions around Verrières . The Canadian 3rd Infantry Division — having taken heavy casualties during the first six weeks of the Normandy campaign — was given a supporting role . The onus of the task therefore fell on the fresh , though relatively inexperienced , Canadian 2nd Infantry Division , along with the tanks of the Canadian 2nd Armoured Brigade . Additional forces were later made available in the shape of three divisions from the British I Corps : the 51st ( Highland ) Division , the Guards Armoured Division , and the British 7th Armoured Division . Despite having significantly more combat experience than their Canadian counterparts , the British units played a minor part in the battle . 
 While British forces had been battling for Caen , elements of Dietrich ′ s I SS Panzer Corps — part of Generalfeldmarshall Günther von Kluge ′ s Army Group B — had turned Verrières Ridge into their main defensive position along the Anglo @-@ Canadian front . Although not particularly high , the ridge 's topography meant that advancing forces would be exposed to fire from German positions across the River Orne , from the ridge and from the nearby German @-@ held industrial hamlet of St. Martin . Two powerful formations — the 12th SS and 1st SS Panzer Divisions — held the ridge supported by artillery , dug @-@ in Tiger tanks and mortar emplacements . A third — the 9th SS Panzer Division — was held in reserve . Further support was available from the 272nd Grenadier Infantry Division ( a force composed mainly of Russian and Polish combatants that had been raised in 1943 ) , the 116th Panzer Division and a battalion of Tiger tanks .

 = = = Attack of Calgary Highlanders = = = 
 In a follow @-@ up to Operation Goodwood on 19 July , the Calgary Highlanders attempted to take the northern spur of Verrières Ridge but German mortar fire limited their progress . Tanks from the Sherbrooke Fusiliers were sent to support the battalion and eliminated several machine @-@ gun positions on either side of Point 67 . The Highlanders eventually managed to dig in , despite accurate return fire . Over the next few hours , they strengthened their position and the 5th and 6th Canadian Infantry Brigades made repeated attempts to exploit the gains . Against a tenacious German defense and minor infantry and tank counterattacks , the Canadians were broadly repulsed with heavy casualties . Simonds rapidly prepared a new offensive for the following day , with the goals of capturing both the eastern side of the Orne river and the main slopes of Verrières Ridge . 
 = = = Operation Atlantic = = = 
 The next attack took place on 20 July as part of Operation Atlantic . It was led by the South Saskatchewan Regiment , with supporting units from the Cameron Highlanders . In the early hours of 20 July , the Highlanders secured a position in St André @-@ sur @-@ Orne but were quickly pinned down by German infantry and tanks . At the same time , the South Saskatchewan Regiment moved directly up the slopes of Verrières Ridge , supported by tanks and Hawker Typhoon ground attack aircraft . The Canadian attack faltered in torrential rain , which rendered air support useless and turned the ground into mud . Counterattacks by two Panzer divisions threw the South <unk> back past their support lines and their supporting battalion — the Essex Scottish — came under attack . The Essex Scottish lost over 300 men as it tried to hold back the advance of the 12th SS Panzer Division , while to the east the remainder of I SS Panzer Corps engaged British forces in the Operation Goodwood , the largest armoured battle of the campaign . By the end of the day , the South <unk> had taken 282 casualties and the ridge was still in enemy hands . 
 Despite these setbacks , Simonds was adamant that Verrières Ridge should be taken and sent in the Black Watch and the Calgary Highlanders to stabilise the precarious Allied position . Minor counterattacks by both battalions on 21 July managed to contain Dietrich 's armoured formations and by the time the operation was called off , Canadian forces held several footholds on the ridge , including a now secure position on Point 67 . Four German divisions still held the ridge . In all , the actions around Verrières Ridge during Operation Atlantic accounted for over 1 @,@ 300 Allied casualties . 
 = = = Operation Spring = = = 
 With the capture of Caen on 19 July , an Anglo @-@ Canadian breakout had become strategically feasible . In the American sector , Lieutenant General Omar Bradley — commander of the U.S. 1st Army — had been planning his own breakout ( codenamed Operation Cobra ) and Simonds too began preparing a new offensive , codenamed Operation Spring . Spring was originally conceived by Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery as a " holding attack " , designed to tie down German forces while Cobra was under way . On 22 July , however , with Operation Atlantic having failed to achieve its aims , Simonds changed the objective of Operation Spring to a breakout offensive . With Verrières Ridge taken , Simonds could launch armour and artillery attacks from its southern flank to push the Germans further back . This would clear the Caen @-@ Falaise road , and his two British armoured divisions could then advance south to Falaise . 
 Operation Spring was scheduled in four tightly timed phases . The Calgary Highlanders would attack Bourguébus Ridge and May @-@ sur @-@ Orne to secure the flanks of the main thrust , which was to be a move on Verrières Ridge by the Black Watch , along with armoured support from the British 7th Armoured Division and the 4th Canadian ( Armoured ) Division . The plan called for the offensive to start on 23 July but poor weather led to a postponement for 48 hours . Taking advantage of this respite , the I SS Panzer Corps reinforced the ridge with an additional four battalions , 480 tanks and 500 guns . Allied Intelligence learned of this reinforcement through Ultra signals intercepts and advised Simonds 's headquarters . 
 On 25 July , two days later than originally planned , Operation Spring was launched . The Black Watch were scheduled to begin their attack at about 05 : 30 from an assembly area at St Martin , 6 km ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) south of Caen . The Canadians ran into heavy German resistance on the St Martin road and did not arrive at their assembly area until close to 08 : 00 . By that time , the Black Watch 's two highest @-@ ranking officers had been killed and command fell to Major Phil Griffin . At 08 : 30 , he met with 5th Brigade commander , Brigadier General W. J. <unk> . Despite the non @-@ arrival of most of their promised armoured support , the decision was taken for the attack to proceed . 
 At 09 : 30 , as the Canadian infantry regiments advanced up the ridge , they were easy targets for the well @-@ entrenched German machine gun nests and mortar pits , supported by tanks , 88 mm ( 3 @.@ 46 in ) anti @-@ tank guns , and Nebelwerfer rocket artillery . To make matters worse , the Black Watch communications were knocked out within minutes of the start of their assault . Very few members of the Black Watch Regiment managed to make it to the crest of the ridge and those who did were subjected to an even heavier bombardment as they ran into the counterattacking forces of the 272nd Infantry Division and the 9th SS Kampfgruppe Sterz . Of the 325 men that left the assembly area , 315 were killed , wounded or captured . The Black Watch lost all its senior commanders , including Major Phil Griffin , with two companies virtually annihilated . This marked the costliest day for a Canadian battalion since the Dieppe Raid of 1942 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 All of the gains made by the Black Watch and Calgary Highlanders were lost to German counterattacks , which inflicted heavy losses on the Highlanders and the previously unscathed Black Watch support company . The Black Watch had to be reformed after Verrières Ridge , having sustained more casualties than any Canadian infantry battalion since the disastrous raid on Dieppe . 
 The central area of the ridge near Verrières Village , was eventually taken and held by the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry . The east side was also taken , but subsequently lost , although two British armoured brigades were able to secure significant footholds near the positions of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry . 
 The failure to capture the ridge had little effect on the overall Allied position , as the success of Operation Cobra was so overwhelming that the Germans diverted significant resources , including two Panzer divisions , from the ridge in their attempt to keep Bradley 's forces boxed in . With its defences weakened , subsequent Commonwealth attacks on the ridge were successful ; Operation Totalize finally managed to wrest the position from its SS defenders on 8 August . 
 = = = Casualties = = = 
 Allied casualty figures for the battle as a whole were not produced but can be inferred by examining the two operations . The accepted toll for Operation Atlantic is 1 @,@ 349 , with about 300 fatalities . Operation Spring 's losses were about 500 killed with a further 1 @,@ 000 captured or wounded . Working from these figures , historians estimate around 800 Canadian dead and 2 @,@ 000 wounded or captured . The Canadian dead are buried in Bretteville @-@ sur @-@ Laize Canadian War Cemetery , between Caen and Falaise . 
 The Canadian Official Historian Charles Stacey and military historian Michael Reynolds , wrote that German casualty figures for individual operations are difficult to determine ; Stacey attributes this to the gradual degradation of the German logistics chain leaving incomplete records and Reynolds wrote that units sometimes over @-@ reported their losses , in the hope of receiving more reinforcements . German losses for the battle were significantly fewer than those suffered by the Canadians . According to Reynolds , between 16 July and 1 August , the 1st SS Panzer Division lost 1 @,@ 092 men killed , wounded or captured — along with 11 Panzer IV tanks and 10 Sturmgeschütz III self @-@ propelled guns — in fighting across all its fronts including at Verrières . Over a similar period , he estimates the 12th SS Panzer Division — in all sectors — suffered only 134 casualties . Many of the German fallen are buried at La <unk> German war cemetery . 
 = = Historiography and controversy = = 
 The Battle of Verrières Ridge — although given no particular prominence in German military history — has earned the distinction of being one of the First Canadian Army 's most scrutinised actions . The matter was first brought to public attention by historian C.P. Stacey , who wrestled with the question of how to present the battle to the public in the Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War and was required to make minor changes to the narrative of the battle by Simonds . At the time Stacey was writing the history , as senior historian of the Historical Section of the Canadian Army , Simonds was the Chief of the General Staff of the Canadian Army , or in essence , his boss . The report on Operation Spring by Simonds was released after the war and blamed its failure on " 11th hour reinforcement " of German lines and " strategically unsound execution on the part of Major Phillip Griffin and the Black Watch " . 
 The battle was brought to greater public attention in 1992 by a CBC television docu @-@ drama , The Valour and the Horror , which made a number of controversial claims about senior leadership in the Second World War and devoted one of its three episodes to the Black Watch attack on Verrières Ridge . The episode raised a spirited debate among the historical and veterans ' communities and led to calls for apologies from the producers and an official investigation by the CBC Ombudsman into the veracity of the claims and the way in which they were presented . 
 Recently declassified wartime documents show that Simonds , along with several others in the Allied high command , had likely been notified on July 23 of a massive German buildup on the ridge . Some historians , including David O 'Keefe and David <unk> , accused Simonds of being careless with the lives of his men . Terry Copp and John A. English , wrote that given the amount of pressure that all Allied commanders were under to break out from Normandy , Simonds probably had little choice in the decision he made . 
 Operation Spring succeeded in its later @-@ defined objective of a " holding attack " and aided the overwhelming success of Operation Cobra , by tying down powerful German formations that might otherwise have been in the American sector , thus precluding any immediate inquiry into its failure . The German commander of the Normandy Sector — Günther von Kluge — was at the Canadian front on 25 July , instead of the American front where the eventual breakout occurred . The Battle of Verrières Ridge had little overall effect on British attempts to break out of Caen , as significant resources were transferred to the American front in the aftermath of Cobra , to exploit Bradley 's success and the ridge eventually fell to the general Allied advance . 
 = Chrisye = 
 <unk> Rahadi ( [ <unk> <unk> ] ; 16 September 1949 – 30 March 2007 ) , born Christian Rahadi but better known by his stage name of Chrisye ( [ <unk> ] ) , was an Indonesian progressive pop singer and songwriter . In his 40 @-@ year career he won many awards and accolades ; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third @-@ greatest Indonesian musician of all time . 
 Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese @-@ Indonesian descent , Chrisye became interested in music at an early age . At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother , Joris . In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada ( later Gipsy ) , a band led by his neighbours , the Nasutions . In 1973 , after a short hiatus , he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year . He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band , the Pro 's . After once again returning to Indonesia , he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy . 
 Following the success of Guruh Gipsy , in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works : " Lilin @-@ Lilin Kecil " by James F. <unk> , which eventually became his signature song , and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu . Their success landed him a recording contract with Musica Studios , with whom he released his first solo album , Sabda Alam , in 1978 . Over his almost 25 @-@ year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums , and in 1980 acted in a film , Seindah Rembulan . Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with lung cancer . 
 Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals , Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia . Five albums to which he contributed were included in Rolling Stone Indonesia 's list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time ; another four of his songs ( and a fifth to which he contributed ) were classified as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time in a later issue of the same magazine . Several of his albums received certification of silver or gold . He received two lifetime achievement awards , one in 1993 from the BASF Awards and another posthumously in 2007 from Indonesian television station SCTV .

 Chrisye was born Christian <unk> in Jakarta on 16 September 1949 to Laurens Rahadi , a Chinese @-@ Betawi entrepreneur , and Hanna Rahadi , a Chinese @-@ Sundanese housewife . He was the second of three sons born to the couple ; his brothers were Joris and Vicky . The family lived on Talang Street near Menteng , Central Jakarta , until 1954 , when they moved to <unk> Street ( also in Menteng ) . 
 While attending <unk> Elementary School , Chrisye befriended the neighbouring Nasution family ; he became especially close to <unk> Gauri , with whom he played badminton and flew kites . He also began listening to his father 's record collection , singing along to songs by Bing Crosby , Frank Sinatra , Nat King Cole , and Dean Martin . After graduating from elementary school , Chrisye attended Christian Middle School III Diponegoro . 
 Beatlemania reached Indonesia while Chrisye was in Senior High School <unk> Menteng , and increased his interest in music . Responding to Chrisye 's desire to play an instrument , his father bought him a guitar ; Chrisye chose the bass guitar , as he considered it the easiest to master . As they could not read music , Chrisye and Joris learned to play by accompanying their father 's records and songs recorded from the radio . In time they began playing at school events , with vocals by Chrisye . During this period he began smoking in school ; when caught , he was punished by being forced to smoke eight cigarettes at once , in front of the assembled pupils . However , this failed to cure his habit and he eventually became a chain smoker . 
 = = = Band member and early projects ( 1968 – 1977 ) = = = 
 In the mid @-@ 1960s , the Nasution siblings formed a band ; Chrisye and Joris watched them play songs by Uriah Heep and Blood , Sweat & Tears . In 1968 Chrisye registered at the Christian University of Indonesia ( <unk> ) to fulfill his father 's wish that he become an engineer . Around 1969 , however , Gauri invited him to join the Nasutions ' band , Sabda Nada , as a replacement for their bassist <unk> <unk> who was ill . Pleased with his performance , the Nasutions asked him to stay as a permanent member . The group had a regular gig at Mini Disko on Juanda Street and freelanced at birthday and wedding parties . When Chrisye had a chance to sing while performing covers , he attempted to sound as much like the original artist as he could . 
 The group was renamed Gipsy in 1969 , which they considered more macho and Western @-@ sounding . The schedule for the band , which had no manager , became increasingly busy , since they had begun giving regular performances at Ismail Marzuki Park . As a result , Chrisye decided to drop out of <unk> ; in 1970 he transferred to Trisakti Tourism Academy , where he considered the study schedule to be more flexible . 
 In 1972 <unk> Nasution offered Chrisye the opportunity to play in New York . Although ecstatic , Chrisye was afraid of telling his father , who he thought would disapprove of the idea . He eventually fell ill for several months , during which time the rest of the band left for New York . After Chrisye discussed his fears with Joris and his mother , his father agreed that he could drop out of college to join Gipsy . After his health improved , in mid @-@ 1973 , he left with <unk> to meet Gipsy in New York . That same year he dropped out of Trisakti . 
 While in New York , Gipsy performed at the Ramayana Restaurant , which was owned by the Indonesian gas company Pertamina . The band , housed in an apartment on Fifth Avenue , performed in New York for almost a year , providing Indonesian @-@ themed music and covering songs by Procol Harum , King Crimson , Emerson , Lake & Palmer , Genesis and Blood , Sweat & Tears . Although Chrisye became upset that he could not fully express himself through covers , he continued to work . 
 Upon returning to Indonesia at the end of 1973 Gauri and his brother Keenan introduced Chrisye to former president Sukarno 's son , the songwriter Guruh Sukarnoputra . As the Nasutions worked with Guruh to prepare for their next project , Chrisye began to write his own songs ; in doing so he noted that he had difficulty with lyrics that included hard consonants , and worked to avoid them . The following year , he went back to New York with another band , The Pro 's . In mid @-@ 1975 , with several weeks left on his contract , Chrisye 's parents called from Jakarta to tell him that his brother Vicky had died of a stomach infection . Unable to return home immediately , Chrisye became distracted by thoughts of his family and began to find playing difficult . As the band returned to Indonesia , Chrisye " cried for the duration of the flight " and sank into a depression . 
 Chrisye stopped playing altogether until the Nasutions invited him to rejoin Gipsy for their new project with Guruh , who offered Chrisye several songs in which he would be lead singer , with lyrics written especially for him . Overcoming his depression , he joined the group as they practised at Guruh 's house in <unk> Baru , South Jakarta . The band often rehearsed late into the night ; the indie project mixed Western rock and Balinese gamelan and was produced collaboratively . Recording took place in mid @-@ 1975 , with only four songs completed in the first several months . It was released to critical acclaim in 1976 , with a production of 5000 copies . The success of Guruh Gipsy convinced Chrisye that he could sing as a soloist . 
 In late 1976 Chrisye was approached by songwriter Jockie <unk> and Imran Amir , head of Prambors Radio , who asked him to provide the vocals for the Prambors Radio Teenage Songwriting Competition ; Chrisye refused , as he did not want to sing an Indonesian pop song . Several days later Sys NS , an employee of Prambors , approached Chrisye while he was meeting with Guruh and Eros Djarot . Sys emphasised that Prambors needed Chrisye for " Lilin @-@ Lilin Kecil " ( " Little Candles " ) , composed by James F. <unk> . After hearing the lyrics , Chrisye agreed . The song was recorded in Irama Mas Studio in <unk> , North Jakarta , and included on an album with the other contest winners . Originally the ninth track , " Lilin @-@ Lilin Kecil " was placed in the lead position to increase the album 's marketability after the original format sold poorly . The song then took off , receiving much airplay ; the album was the best @-@ selling of the year . 
 After the success of " Lilin @-@ Lilin Kecil " , in mid @-@ 1977 <unk> Records approached Chrisye and offered him a contract for an album , Jurang Pemisah ( Dividing Canyon ) . Working with Jockie , Ian Antono , and Teddy <unk> , Chrisye recorded seven songs for the album ; Jockie did two more . Although he was pleased with the results and had high hopes for the album , <unk> decided it was not commercially viable and refused to promote it until Chrisye 's subsequent album Badai Pasti Berlalu took off . After his unsuccessful attempt to buy up all the stock , the album was released , but because the general public considered it a sequel to Badai Pasti Berlalu , the sales were poor . Although the cassettes reached radio stations throughout the country , Chrisye later described the album as selling " as warmly as chicken shit " . 
 That same year , Chrisye and several artists including Djarot and Jockie recorded the soundtrack for the film Badai Pasti Berlalu over two months . After the soundtrack won a Citra Award at the 1978 Indonesian Film Festival , Irama Mas studios approached the group to do a soundtrack album for a flat fee . With Chrisye and <unk> <unk> on vocals , the soundtrack was rerecorded in album form in <unk> over 21 days . It was released under the same name as the film , with a picture of actress Christine Hakim on the cover . The album included Chrisye 's first songwriting credit , " <unk> Alam " ( " Fragile Nature " ) , but sales were stagnant for the first week until radio stations began to play the singles . 
 = = = Early solo and film career ( 1978 – 1982 ) = = = 
 Chrisye 's tenor voice and performance on Badai Pasti Berlalu led Amin Widjaja of Musica Studios to ask him to sign with Musica ; Widjaja had been scouting him since the release of Guruh Gipsy . Chrisye agreed on condition that he be allowed creative freedom , to which Widjaja reluctantly agreed . In May 1978 Chrisye began work on his first album with Musica , Sabda Alam ( Nature 's Order ) , incorporating several songs by other artists and some written by himself , including the title song . He recorded it after locking himself in the studio with the sound engineer and arranger ; despite Amin 's wanting to monitor their progress , Chrisye refused to allow him access . The album , greatly influenced by Badai Pasti Berlalu and drawing on the double tracking technique pioneered by the Beatles ( in which the vocals are recorded twice to achieve fuller sound ) , was released in August that year . Heavily promoted in a campaign during which Chrisye was interviewed on the national television station TVRI and on radio , the album eventually sold 400 @,@ 000 copies . 
 The following year Chrisye recorded Percik Pesona ( Stain of Enchantment ) with Jockie . Produced after Amin 's death , the album featured songs written by Chrisye 's close friend Junaidi Salat , as well as Jockie and Guruh . The album 's title was chosen by vote ; the titular song was not released as a single . Percik Pesona , released in August 1979 , was a critical and commercial failure . After discussing the issue with other artists , Chrisye blamed the album 's failure on its similarity to Badai Pasti Berlalu . As a result , following a period of contemplation , he began branching out into different genres . That same year he was on the panel of the Prambors Teenage Songwriting Competition , held on 5 May . 
 After deciding that romantic pop songs influenced by easy listening would suit him best , Chrisye began recording his next album , Puspa Indah ( Beautiful Flower ) . All but one of the songs were composed by Guruh Sukarnoputra ; the album also featured the English @-@ language " To My Friends on <unk> Beach " . Two of the songs , " Galih dan Ratna " ( " Galih and Ratna " ) and " Gita Cinta " ( " Love Song " ) , were used in the 1979 film Gita Cinta dari SMA ( Love Song from High School ) ; Chrisye played a minor part in the film 's sequel , Puspa Indah Taman Hati ( Beautiful Flower in the Heart 's Garden ) , as a singer . Due in part to the popularity of the film , Puspa Indah was well received and sold well ; " Galih dan Ratna " and " Gita Cinta " , released as singles , were also commercially successful . 
 In 1980 Chrisye appeared in the Indonesian film Seindah Rembulan ( As Beautiful as the Moon ) ; at first reluctant to accept the role , he was convinced by Sys NS that it would be fun . He later regretted the decision , considering the film crew unprofessional and often fighting with director <unk> Fuad . The following year , he released <unk> Cita ( Reflection of Dreams ) , a collaboration with Jockie . After the album flopped , Chrisye took a long sabbatical . 
 = = = Marriage and changing styles ( 1982 – 1993 ) = = = 
 Although popular with groupies , Chrisye had rarely dated . But in early 1981 he began courting Guruh Sukarnoputra 's secretary , Gusti Firoza Damayanti Noor ( Yanti ) . Yanti , of mixed Dayak and Minang ancestry , was a former singer and came from a musically inclined family ; she would often discuss music with Chrisye while he waited for Guruh , and he would also see her when visiting her brother <unk> , one of his friends . When she moved to Bali to work at a five @-@ star hotel there for several weeks , Chrisye followed her and told her that he would marry her when she returned to Jakarta ; although this was not a formal proposal , Yanti accepted . In 1982 Chrisye converted to Islam , as Islam does not permit interfaith marriages between Muslim women and non @-@ Muslim men , and changed his name to <unk> Rahadi ; Chrisye at the time had been growing increasingly discontent and disillusioned with Christianity . On 12 December 1982 he married Yanti in a Padang @-@ style wedding . 
 Driven by his poor financial position and invigorated by Djarot 's return from Germany , Chrisye began work on his next album with Djarot and Jockie in early 1983 . Aciu Widjaja , the new manager of Musica , speculated that they required a new sound ; as such , Chrisye , Djarot , and Jockie mixed art rock with Chrisye 's standard romantic pop and drew influences from The Police . The resulting album , Resesi ( Recession ) , was released in 1983 . The album was well received , selling 350 @,@ 000 copies and being certified silver ; the singles " Lenny " , " Hening " ( " Silent " ) , and " Malam Pertama " ( " Wedding Night " ) received much airplay . 
 After Resesi , Chrisye collaborated with Djarot and Jockie on the 1983 album Metropolitan . The album , drawing on new wave influences and dealing mainly with issues facing youth , was well received , later going silver ; the single " Selamat Jalan <unk> " ( " Goodbye Dear " ) also became a hit . That year , Chrisye and Yanti had their first daughter , <unk> <unk> . The following year , Chrisye , Djarot , and Jockie collaborated again on Nona ( Miss ) , which featured social criticism ; the album spawned four singles and went on to be certified platinum . Despite Nona 's warm sales , after some influence from Aciu , Chrisye decided to look for a new sound and broke off his partnership with Djarot and Jockie in mid @-@ 1984 . 
 Chrisye approached Addie MS , a young composer , and asked him to help with the next album . Addie , despite feeling that he was not in the same class as Djarot and Jockie , accepted , and suggested using similar melodies as in " Lilin @-@ Lilin Kecil " and Badai Pasti Berlalu . The resulting album , Sendiri ( Alone ) , with songs by Guruh and Junaidi Salat , included harps , oboes , cor anglais , and a string section . Spawning three singles , the album sold well and earned Chrisye his first BASF Award . 
 In late 1984 Chrisye approached another young composer , Adjie <unk> , to help him prepare his next album . Light beats and cheerful melodies were in vogue at the time ; therefore the two used a lighter style . Recording for the new album , titled Aku Cinta Dia ( I Love Her ) , began in 1985 , with additional songs from Guruh and <unk> S. Manaf . The titular song was chosen after Aciu heard a jam session led by Adjie and immediately decided that it would be the lead single . The album called for more emoting , which Chrisye – known as having a stiff stage persona – struggled to deliver , though Yanti prepared colourful costumes and Alex Hasyim trained him in choreography . Upon its release , Aku Cinta Dia sold hundreds of thousands of copies in the first week and was eventually certified gold . That same year , Chrisye and <unk> <unk> released Hip Hip Hura ( Hip Hip Hurray ! ) , and another collaboration , Nona Lisa ( Miss Lisa ) , was released in 1986 ; the later two albums had similar beats and rhythms and sold well , although not as well as Aku Cinta Dia . On 2 March 1986 Chrisye and Yanti had their second daughter , <unk> <unk> . 
 Despite the success of the trilogy , Chrisye and his family continued to struggle financially ; twice they had to sell their family car to raise cash . This led Chrisye to briefly consider quitting the music industry . In 1988 Chrisye recorded Jumpa Pertama ( First Meeting ) , and the following year he released Pergilah Kasih ( Go Away Dear ) . He later recalled that the album , with an arrangement by Younky <unk> , had a " beautiful touch " . The title song , " Pergilah Kasih " , was written by Tito <unk> and used to make Chrisye 's first music video ; the video , directed by Jay Subyakto , was the first Indonesian song to be shown on MTV Southeast Asia . 
 On 27 February of the following year , Chrisye and Yanti had twin sons , Randa <unk> and <unk> <unk> . In 1992 Chrisye recorded a cover single of <unk> Plus ' song " <unk> T 'lah Berlalu " ( " Your Love has Passed " ) with arrangement by Younky ; the music video was again broadcast on MTV Southeast Asia and became the first Indonesian music video to be broadcast on the American version of MTV . The following year , Chrisye paired up with Younky again to record Sendiri Lagi ( Alone Again ) , a project which required four months of planning and another four months of recording ; the music video for the title song was also circulated on MTV South @-@ East Asia .

 Although Sendiri Lagi did fairly well , in the beginning of the 1990s Chrisye began to feel pressure from the increasingly visual @-@ oriented music industry and growing amount of young talent . He again began considering leaving the music industry , feeling as if he had already " reached the finish line " . Despite reassurances from Yanti that many singers continue to perform into their sixties , Chrisye observed that increasing numbers of established acts were being pushed aside by newcomers . While in this state of despair , Chrisye was approached by Jay Subyakto and Gauri Nasution , who offered him a solo concert at the Plenary Hall of the Jakarta Convention Centre , which had never before hosted a solo concert by an Indonesian artist . Unconvinced he had sufficient fans to fill the hall , Chrisye initially refused . 
 Gauri tried for several weeks to persuade Chrisye to commit to the concert , and following Chrisye 's introduction to Erwin Gutawa , who was scheduled to handle the arrangements , Jay Subyakto succeeded in convincing him that it might be the last chance to revive his career . Lacking the necessary funding , they approached RCTI in search of sponsorship but were refused , and laughingly told that they should try holding a concert at the National Monument . Undeterred , Chrisye , <unk> , and Gutawa put together a group of artists and began rehearsals . Around the time of RCTI 's fourth anniversary , the television station relented and agreed to fund the concert as part of their celebrations ; the thousands of tickets available sold out within a week . 
 The concert , entitled Sendiri to demonstrate that " 100 % Indonesian " concerts could be successful , was held on 19 August 1994 . Chrisye performed a set that included his greatest hits and several duets , among them " Malam Pertama " with Ruth <unk> , in front of a full orchestra conducted by Gutawa . Chrisye recalled later that the audience – children and adults – had memorised the lyrics to his songs , classics and recent releases ; he said that this gesture made him feel incredibly small . <unk> by the concert 's success , Chrisye went on tour to Surabaya , Surakarta , and Bandung , using a convoy of 24 trucks and buses to transport the necessary equipment ; those concerts also sold out . 
 Following the success of his Sendiri tour , Chrisye began to explore the possibility of producing an album of his early hits , remastered by Gutawa . On the condition that they use an Australian orchestra to provide backing music , Gutawa agreed to an acoustic @-@ flavoured album . Aciu also agreed , despite the expected cost of Rp 600 million ( US $ 70 @,@ 000 ) . After basic recording in Jakarta , Chrisye , Gutawa , and sound engineer Dany <unk> spent two weeks in Studio 301 in Sydney finishing off the album . The Philip Hartl Chamber Orchestra provided the music ; the mixing and mastering was also completed in Sydney . AkustiChrisye was released in 1996 and sold well . 
 After AkustiChrisye , Gutawa suggested that Chrisye try a new style , with more serious songs . The two soon began collaborating on Kala Cinta Menggoda , again using an Australian orchestra . Chrisye , however , found himself unable to record one of the songs , " Ketika <unk> dan Kaki <unk> " ( " When Hands and Feet Speak " ) , written by poet Taufiq Ismail and based on verse 65 of the Qu 'ranic sura Ya Sin ; he would break into tears after singing only a couple of verses . Eventually , the day before he was to leave for Australia , he completed the song with Yanti 's support . On 11 October Chrisye performed " Indonesia Perkasa " ( " Powerful Indonesia " ) at the opening ceremony of the 1997 Southeast Asian Games ; the song was written for the event . The following month he released Kala Cinta Menggoda . The music video for the titular song , directed by Dimas <unk> , won the MTV Video Music Award for South @-@ East Asia on 10 September 1998 ; Chrisye went to Los Angeles to accept the award at the Universal Amphitheatre . 
 Chrisye began work on a rearrangement of Badai Pasti Berlalu in 1999 at the request of Musica Studios – although he felt that the original album was fine – and once again teamed up with Gutawa . The new album , which retained the title Badai Pasti Berlalu , cost <unk> million ( US $ 95 @,@ 000 ) to produce and promote , in part owing to the cost of employing an Australian orchestra , the Victorian Philharmonic Orchestra . After its release , the album sold well , breaking even within three months and selling 350 @,@ 000 copies . The album led to Chrisye 's second sold @-@ out solo concert at the Plenary Hall of Jakarta Convention Centre , known as the Badai concert , and he received numerous offers to perform at venues throughout the country . He later told Kompas that he felt as if he had reached a dead end , having tried all genres available . He continued performing , singing " Indonesia Perkasa " at the opening ceremony of the 15th National Games on 19 June 2000 in <unk> , East Java . 
 In 2001 Chrisye released the studio album Konser Tur 2001 ( Concert Tour 2001 ) , which included two new songs and several old ones . The music video for one of the new songs , " Setia " ( " Loyal " ) , was controversial owing to its portrayal of a woman in tight clothing . Soon afterwards , Chrisye decided to cover some of what he considered the most important Indonesian songs since the country 's independence in 1945 , ranging from songs from the 1940s like Ismail Marzuki 's " Kr . Pasar Gambir & <unk> Anak <unk> " ( " <unk> of Gambir Market and <unk> of the <unk> Child " ) , to the late 1990s such as Ahmad Dhani 's " <unk> " ( " Longing " ) . It also featured a song written exclusively for the album by <unk> of <unk> and two duets with Sophia Latjuba . The album , Dekade ( Decade ) , was released in 2002 ; by October 2003 it had sold 350 @,@ 000 copies . On 15 December 2002 Chrisye participated in the Bali for the World – Voices of Stars concert at Kartika Beach Plaza to raise funds for the victims of the bombings on 12 October ; other acts involved included Melly Goeslaw , Gigi , <unk> , and Superman is Dead . On 12 July 2004 Chrisye held a third concert , Dekade , at Plenary Hall . The concert , with a set that contained numerous classics included in Dekade , featured duets with Sophia Latjuba and several of the original performers , such as <unk> RM with " Sakura " and A. Rafiq with " Pengalaman Pertama " ( " First Experience " ) ; Gutawa 's orchestra again provided the music . 
 Chrisye then began work on his last studio album , Senyawa ( One Soul ) . In collaboration with other Indonesian artists including Project Pop , Ungu , and Peterpan , he also produced the album , replacing Gutawa . The song " Bur @-@ Kat " ( " Say It Quickly " ) , with Project Pop , marked his first attempt at rap . Released in November 2004 , the album was well received by the market , but Sony Music Entertainment Indonesia complained that the names of their artists were featured on the cover . As a result , the album was withdrawn , and re @-@ released without the offending names .

 In July 2005 Chrisye was admitted to Pondok Indah Hospital , complaining of breathing difficulties . After 13 days of treatment he was moved to the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore , where he was diagnosed with lung cancer . Although concerned about losing his hair , which he considered part of his image , he underwent the first of six rounds of chemotherapy on 2 August 2005 . 
 Chrisye 's health improved in 2006 and in May and November he undertook long interview sessions with his biographer Alberthiene Endah . He also released two compilation albums , Chrisye by Request and Chrisye Duets ; however , he reportedly did not feel well enough to release new songs . By February 2007 his health was again in decline . 
 Chrisye died on 30 March 2007 at his home in <unk> , South Jakarta . He was buried in <unk> <unk> Public Cemetery , South Jakarta . His funeral was attended by hundreds , including Indonesian celebrities such as his collaborator Erwin Gutawa and singers Titiek Puspa , Ahmad Albar , Sophia Latjuba , and <unk> Fawzi . 
 One hundred days after Chrisye 's death Musica released two compilation albums . Entitled Chrisye in Memoriam – Greatest Hits and Chrisye in Memoriam – Everlasting Hits , they contained fourteen hits from albums ranging from Sabda Alam to Senyawa . On 1 August 2008 Chrisye 's last single " <unk> " ( " Gentle Voice " ) , written by <unk> <unk> <unk> , was released . The song 's existence had been kept secret , and the recording date is unknown ; <unk> has said that it was recorded " for fun " . A music video directed by Vicky <unk> and featuring Ariel Peterpan , Giring from Nidji , and Chrisye 's widow was released later .

 According to Jockie , one of the main reasons that Chrisye was chosen to record " Lilin @-@ Lilin Kecil " was that he had a unique voice with a soft timbre , which went well with the keyboards used ; Jockie , however , felt that Chrisye 's voice lost its dynamics when mixed with mellow music , which led him to give their collaboration Jurang Pemisah more of a rock feel . Gutawa compared Chrisye 's voice to a blank sheet of paper , able to be applied to anything . Sys NS wrote in 2007 that he had been looking for " someone with the voice of an angel " to sing " Lilin @-@ Lilin Kecil " , and in his opinion Chrisye fitted the role perfectly . 
 A writer for the Indonesian magazine <unk> described Chrisye 's on @-@ stage persona as " stiff " , with very little movement . Alex Hasyim , who did the choreography for Aku Cinta Dia and Hip Hip Hura , recalled that Chrisye was in a cold sweat on their first day of practise and eventually created his own dancing style as he could not follow Hasyim 's instructions . 
 Chrisye chose his own costumes and at times experimented with different colours and designs . In all his music videos he preferred to wear the same style of shirt , quipping in an interview with Kompas that he would only wear a different one if he had fallen into a ditch .
