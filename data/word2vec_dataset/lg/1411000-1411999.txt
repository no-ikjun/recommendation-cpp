 Before starting a match , one is encouraged to splice the Matterhorn by insulting one 's opponents – though this might very well be a means , invented by Guy on the spur of the moment , for getting away with shouting abuse at a group of children . It starts when the official shouts Commence . 
 = = = Advanced rules = = = 
 The detailed rules of Guyball appear to depend on the variation being played . A " classic three @-@ person variation of the game " , in which two people chase the wearer of the toppmeiler , is described by Guy to his colleague Dr Martin Dear ( as Martin wears an improvised toppmeiler made of a wicker bin <unk> to his head ) as follows : 
 Don 't leave the parish , all right ? If you reach the maison , put your left arm in the air and shout ' Maison ! ' . [ ... ] There are no burrow tactics and there are no hedgehogs , OK ? [ ... ] I won the toss so <unk> are random [ ... ] and it 's a two @-@ bounce <unk> . Right . Go ! Move ! 
 One might also play with orthodox or alternate <unk> and a four @-@ bounce <unk> / <unk> / , though this tends to be in matches in which the two sides have an equal number of players , all of whom wear <unk> . Positions in which Guyball players may find themselves include : 
 The Emmental loop , in which one has a cleft mitten showing whilst one crouches to attack one 's opponent . 
 The classical heist , an attack in which one is standing with one 's foot on the opponent 's jaw and one 's toppmeiler is empty . 
 The fat chalet , similar to the classical heist except that one 's toppmeiler is geometrically loaded , that is , contains a large six @-@ sided die . 
 It is unknown who the reigning world Guyball champion is as of 2006 , though Guy is still an active player and taught Guyball to some local children as part of his community service . He has claimed that if he had twelve children himself he would teach Guyball to all of them . According to The Complete First Series Scripts , a player can also be sent off for " Illegal use of the hefty fondue . " This happened between Guy Secretan and Markus Geissler , during a match at the <unk> , Lausanne . Guy won 12 : 3 . 
 Whilst no guide to the rules has been officially published , there is a guide called The Guyball Rule Book that can be seen being read by Green Wing 's writers on the Green Wing Special DVD .

 In the first season , Guy receives a letter from the International Olympic Committee concerning the induction of Guyball as an Olympic sport . The results reached by the committee were : 
 " We do not think that Guyball is " The Bollocks " . " 
 " Guyball will not be included in the forthcoming Olympic Games . " 
 " Contrary to whatever your friend " Diggler " might have heard , we do not accept " <unk> " . " 
 " We are not biased against Switzerland or any other nation . " 
 " We do not care if you know where we live . " 
 However , in the " Green Wing Unmasked : Exclusive Collectors Booklet " , the letter was instead sent to the " European Team Sports Federation " .

 Despite the fact that Guyball is a fictional game , many fans have tried to play the game in real life , making their own rules and creating Guyball societies .

 Currently the only organised society to play Guyball in the UK is based in King 's College London . It was founded by Jane <unk> and Anna Jones , who claim that it has been approved by Stephen Mangan , the actor who plays Guy , and Green Wing 's writers . According to an audio commentary on series 2 , episode 4 of Green Wing , Tamsin Greig says that the students were given money to research the rules , and if none existed , to invent them . The only copy of the rules is on the society 's MySpace page .

 Only two games of Guyball have been recorded in real life . The first was at a barbecue for <unk> , Green Wing 's production company , at North Hampshire Hospital , Basingstoke , where Green Wing is partly filmed .

 The second was at the first Green Wing convention , Wingin ' It . The match was played at Brook Green , umpired by Stephen Mangan , and was organised by Green Wing 's production assistant Patrick Schulenburg . The six @-@ on @-@ six match was played using the Geneva variation , with free <unk> and geometric <unk> . Players were asked to " watch your <unk> " before the match commenced . The players spliced the <unk> , insulting Mangan . The first goal scored was an own goal , as the team ran into their own parish . It was reported that some of the players were injured during the match . A DVD of the convention is to be released . So far , the convention has raised in the order of £ 5 @,@ 000 for Great Ormond Street Hospital .

 = = Cast and characters = = 
 Prison Break maintains an ensemble cast for each season along with many recurring guest stars . The first season features a cast of ten actors who receive star billing , who were based in Chicago or at Fox River State Penitentiary . The second season features a cast of nine actors who receive billing ; three characters are downgraded from series regular to recurring status , another is upgraded , and a new character is introduced . The third season introduces four new characters ; two of whom are prisoners at Penitenciaría Federal de Sona . 
 Most of the changes in the cast have been due to character deaths . Series creator , Paul Scheuring , explains that killing off major characters " makes the audience that much more fearful for our protagonists " and that " it actually does help us in terms of reducing story lines " . The two protagonists of the series , Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows , are the only characters to have appeared in every episode of the series . 
 Dominic Purcell as Lincoln Burrows ( seasons 1 – 4 ) : Lincoln is a high school drop @-@ out and a convicted felon , who is wrongfully accused of and charged with the murder of Terence Steadman , the brother of the Vice President of the United States . Purcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently , he was the last actor to join the original cast . He auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as Tommy <unk> on North Shore . Since working on John Doe , Purcell has had an amiable relationship with Fox . Hence , he was sent the pilot script of Prison Break . Scheuring 's first impression of Purcell did not convince him as a fit for the role since the actor went to the audition with his hair styled and a tan . However , Purcell 's acting won the role . He arrived on the set on the first day of filming with a shaved head , which amazed Scheuring with the physical likeness of the series ' two leading actors . 
 Wentworth Miller as Michael Scofield ( seasons 1 – 4 ) : Michael is Lincoln 's brother and worked as a structural engineer before devoting full @-@ time to his brother 's case . In order to save his brother 's life , Michael creates an elaborate plan to help his brother escape from prison . In an interview , Paul Scheuring recalled that most of the actors who tested for the role " would come in playing mysterious , but it was so cheesy and false . " A week before the start of production , Miller auditioned for the role and impressed Scheuring with his performance ; he was cast the following day .

 Amaury Nolasco as Fernando Sucre ( seasons 1 – 4 ) : Sucre develops a friendship with Michael during time at Fox River State Penitentiary , where he was his cell @-@ mate . Initially , his character 's story focuses on his wish to reunite with his fiancée . Upon receiving the pilot script , Nolasco 's first thought was that it was " one of those failed pilots that the network did not really want " since most of the series pilots would have started production by that time . Admitting that he does not like to read , Nolasco was amazed that the script was a " huge page @-@ turner " . Prior to his last audition for the role , Nolasco recalled his nervousness , which grew when Paul Scheuring told him that he was their favorite choice . Subsequently , he was cast in the role .

 The original concept of Prison Break — a man deliberately getting himself sent to prison in order to help his brother escape — was suggested to Paul Scheuring by producer Dawn Parouse , who wanted to produce an action @-@ oriented series . Although Scheuring thought it was a good idea , he was initially stumped as to why someone would embark on such a mission or how he could develop it into a viable television show . He came up with the story of the wrongfully accused brother , and began working on the plot outline and devising the characters . In 2003 , he pitched the idea to the Fox Broadcasting Company but was turned down as Fox felt nervous about the long @-@ term possibilities of such a series . He subsequently showed the concept to other channels but was also turned down as it was thought to be more suited for a film project than a television series . Prison Break was later considered as a possible 14 @-@ part miniseries , which drew the interest of Steven Spielberg before his departure due to his involvement with War of the Worlds . Thus , the miniseries never materialized . Following the huge popularity of serialized prime time television series such as Lost and 24 , Fox decided to back the production in 2004 . The pilot episode was filmed a year after Scheuring wrote the script . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 The first three seasons of Prison Break were primarily filmed outside of Hollywood . The majority of the first season of the series was filmed on location in and around Chicago . After it was closed down in 2002 , Joliet Prison became the set of Prison Break in 2005 , standing in as Fox River State Penitentiary on screen . Scenes set in Lincoln 's cell , the infirmary , and the prison yard were all shot on location at the prison . Lincoln 's cell was alleged to be the same one in which serial killer John Wayne Gacy was incarcerated , a which at least one member of the production crew refused to enter , because it was alleged to be haunted . Other sets were built at the prison , including the cell blocks that housed the general prison population ; these blocks had three tiers of cells ( as opposed to the real cell block 's two ) and had cells much larger than real cells to allow more space for the actors and cameras . Exterior scenes were filmed in areas around Chicago , Woodstock , and Joliet in Illinois . Other locations included O 'Hare International Airport in Chicago and Toronto , Ontario in Canada . Prison Break spent $ 2 million per episode in the state of Illinois , which cost them a total of $ 24 million in 2005 . 
 Renewed for a second season , Prison Break resumed filming on June 15 , 2006 , in Dallas , Texas due to the close proximity of rural and urban settings . Locations within a 30 @-@ minute radius of Dallas were chosen which included Little Elm , Decatur , and Mineral Wells . Many of these locations were used to represent various American towns . The show was expected to spend in excess of $ 50 million in Texas over the course of the second season . For the final three episodes of the second season , filming took place in Pensacola , Florida to represent Panama . Each episode took eight days to film and approximately $ 1 @.@ 4 million went to the local economy per episode . 
 The third season was shot in Dallas and had a budget of $ 3 million per episode . Several of the exterior scenes with Lincoln and Gretchen negotiating the escape from the Panama jail were shot in the Casco Viejo quarter of Panama City . The principal photography for the fourth season was relocated to Los Angeles , California .

 The theme music of Prison Break and the incidental music of each episode was composed by Ramin Djawadi . The score for the first two seasons is featured in the Prison Break : Original Television Soundtrack , which was released on August 28 , 2007 . Djawadi and Ferry Corsten produced a remix of the theme music titled " Prison Break Theme ( Ferry Corsten Breakout Mix ) " as a single , which was released by Fox Music in 2006 . In Europe , rapper <unk> <unk> 's song " Pas le temps " is used by television network M6 in France and by RTL @-@ <unk> in Belgium to replace the show 's original theme music in the title sequence , which generated publicity and helped to localize the show .

 Prison Break features a serialized story structure , similar to that of its first season companion show 24 . At the 2009 TV Critics Press Tour , Kevin Reilly told reporters that the series would end with the fourth season . Despite decreasing ratings , Reilly attributed the cancellation to creativity : " The show has just played out . You get to a point creatively where you feel all the stories have been told , and you want to end strong and not gimp out in the end of the season . " Regarding the finale , Reilly stated , " They have a really cool ending , actually . I know where they end , and it 's a hell of an idea . " 
 On October 24 , 2007 , The Hollywood Reporter reported that a spin off was under development , tentatively titled Prison Break : Cherry Hill . The series was to revolve around an upper @-@ middle @-@ class housewife , Molly , and her stint in a women 's prison . However , the producers ' original idea to introduce Molly in the third season of Prison Break was later dropped due to the writers ' strike . The new series would instead begin under the Prison Break brand similar to CSI : Miami and CSI : NY .

 = = = Ratings and critical reception = = = 
 The following seasonal rankings are based on a weighted average total viewers per episode as recorded by Nielsen Media Research . The recording period begins in late September ( the start of the U.S. network television season ) and ends in late May . 
 The show debuted on August 29 , 2005 to an estimated audience of 10 @.@ 5 million viewers . Fox had not seen such success for summertime Monday numbers since Melrose Place and Ally McBeal aired in September 1998 . The premiere was ranked first in both the 18 – 49 and 18 – 34 demographics . The strong debut performance was also matched by various positive reviews . According to The New York Times , Prison Break was " more intriguing than most of the new network series , and it certainly is one of the most original " , complimenting its ability to create a " suspenseful thriller " and its " authentic look " . Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly dubbed it as one of the best new shows of 2005 . On the other hand , The Washington Post criticized the show for its " somber pretentiousness " and " uniformly overwrought " performances . Due to its ratings success , Fox decided to extend Prison Break by an extra nine episodes , making it the first new series in the 2005 – 2006 television season to receive a full season order of 22 episodes . The series averaged 9 @.@ 2 million viewers per week in its first season . 
 The premiere of the second season of Prison Break obtained an average of 9 @.@ 4 million viewers . The decline was steeper among young @-@ adult viewers with a decrease of 20 % in the 18 – 49 demographic compared to its series premiere , but its household rating grew from 3 @.@ 6 % to 3 @.@ 9 % during the last half @-@ hour . Robert Bianco of USA Today commented on the " harebrained absurdities that have swamped this show " , and blamed the writers for being " incredibly lazy " for the continuous use of the tattoo as an " all @-@ purpose plot fix " . In contrast , Detroit Free Press commended the second season premiere on matching the standard set by the first season , which delivered " rocking good entertainment " due to its " motley crew of cellblock characters " and the " taut , ingenious storytelling of series creator Paul T. Scheuring and his staff . " The second season obtained its largest audience on the original airdate of the episode , " Chicago " with an average of 10 @.@ 1 million viewers . Overall , the second season averaged 9 @.@ 3 million viewers per week . 
 The third and particularly fourth season received progressively more negative reviews , as the show 's plot diverged from its origin story of breaking out of prison , and focused more on conventional elements of a government conspiracy drama series . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 Concerns were raised by the Parents Television Council in the United States about the time slot in which Prison Break was broadcast ( 8 : 00 pm ET ) since the show features some scenes which contain graphic content . In France , the broadcasting watchdog , Conseil Supérieur de l <unk> ( CSA ) , also complained that the violence in some episodes exceeded the amount allowed for its rating , which is " not for under 10s " . Under France 's regulations , any higher ratings would move the show away from its current primetime timeslot to a later timeslot . However , their decision to change the rating would only affect the first season , which has already been broadcast , and not the second season .

 Following a successful airing of the series ' first thirteen episodes , Prison Break was nominated for its first award , the 2005 People 's Choice Award for Favorite New TV Drama .

 = Hygeberht = 
 Hygeberht ( also spelled <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> ; died after 803 ) was the Bishop of Lichfield from 779 and Archbishop of Lichfield after the elevation of Lichfield to an archdiocese some time after 787 , during the reign of the powerful Mercian king Offa . Little is known of Hygeberht 's background , although he was probably a native of Mercia . 
 Offa succeeded in having Lichfield elevated to an archbishopric , but the rise in Lichfield 's status was unpopular with Canterbury , the other southern English archbishopric . Offa was probably motivated by a desire to increase the status of his kingdom and to free his kingdom 's ecclesiastical affairs from the control of another kingdom 's archbishopric , and possibly the need to secure the coronation of Offa 's successor , which the Archbishop of Canterbury had opposed . After Offa 's death his distant relative Coenwulf became king , and petitioned the pope to have Lichfield returned to a simple bishopric . The pope agreed to do so in 803 , by which time Hygeberht was no longer even considered a bishop : he is listed as an abbot at the council that oversaw the demotion of Lichfield in 803 . The date of his death is unknown . 
 = = Background = = 
 Nothing is known of Hygeberht 's ancestry or his upbringing , but given his close ties to the kingdom of Mercia , he was probably a Mercian by birth . He became Bishop of Lichfield in 779 . At a Mercian council he attended that year at <unk> he was styled " electus <unk> " , or " bishop elect " . Two years later he witnessed a charter of Offa 's concerning an ecclesiastical claim on a church in Worcester . 
 Perhaps as early as 786 the creation of a Mercian archbishopric was being discussed at Offa 's court . A letter to the papacy written by Coenwulf , who succeeded Offa 's son Ecgfrith to the Mercian throne , claimed that Offa 's motives were his dislike of Jænberht , the Archbishop of Canterbury , and of the men of Kent . At the Council of Chelsea held in 787 , Offa secured the creation of an archbishopric for his kingdom centred on the diocese of Lichfield ( in modern Staffordshire ) . Offa may have justified the move by suggesting that Jænberht planned to allow the Frankish king Charlemagne to use a landing site in Kent if the latter decided to invade , although this is only known from a 13th @-@ century writer , Matthew Paris . Another concern was probably that of prestige , as having the main Mercian diocese held by an archbishop rather than a bishop would increase the kingdom 's status . 
 An archbishopric in Mercia would also reinforce the kingdom 's independence and free it from ecclesiastical dependence on Canterbury in the kingdom of Kent , which Offa had recently brought under Mercian control . Jænberht supported the Kentish king Egbert II , who was not known as a firm supporter of Offa 's ; an archbishop at Canterbury who was either indifferent or in active opposition to Offa would be an impediment to Offa 's ability to establish overlordship of Kent and other areas of England . By elevating another archbishop , Offa would reduce the political power of the archbishops of Canterbury . Elevation of a bishopric to an archbishopric was not unprecedented ; in 735 the papacy had elevated another Anglo @-@ Saxon bishopric to an archbishopric , when Ecgbert became the first Archbishop of York . 
 = = Council of Chelsea = = 
 Two different versions of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle record the proceedings of the council . The Peterborough Manuscript ( Version E ) of the Chronicle records the council under the year 785 , although the events took place in 787 , and states that " here there was a contentious synod at Chelsea and Archbishop Jænberht relinquished some part of his bishopric , and Hygeberht was chosen by King Offa , and Ecgfrith consecrated as king . " The Canterbury Manuscript ( Version F ) has the council under 785 also , and describes the council as " a full synod sat at <unk> " but otherwise relates much the same events . The historian Nicholas Brooks sees the coupling of the elevation of Lichfield with the consecration of Ecgfrith , who was Offa 's son , as significant . He argues that Offa desired to have Ecgfrith consecrated as his successor during Offa 's lifetime , but was unable to get Jænberht to agree , and this was another factor in the creation of Lichfield as an archbishopric . Hygeberht consecrated Ecgfrith after Hygeberht 's elevation to archiepiscopal status . 
 Offa vowed at the council to donate 365 mancuses each year to the papacy , to provide for poor people in Rome and to provide lights for St. Peter 's Basilica , stated to be a thanks @-@ offering for his victories . C. J. Godfrey has argued that the donation was really in return for the papal approval of Offa 's scheme to elevate the diocese of Lichfield to an archdiocese . Whatever Offa 's motivation , historians have generally seen the gift as the beginning of Peter 's Pence , an annual " tax " paid to Rome by the English Church . 
 Although it appears that the Council of Chelsea approved Lichfield 's elevation to an archdiocese , Hygeberht , who was present , remained a bishop at its conclusion ; he signed the council 's report still as a bishop . There is no indication that he played any significant part in the council nor in the actions that led to him becoming an archbishop . 
 = = Archbishop = = 
 In 788 Hygeberht traveled to Rome and received a pallium , the symbol of an archbishop 's authority , from Pope Hadrian I. In one surviving charter of 788 Hygeberht is listed with the title of bishop , but another from late 788 gives him the title of archbishop . More charters from 789 and 792 also give him the title of archbishop , and he continued to be named as such on charters until 799 . 
 Throughout the early part of Hygeberht 's episcopate , Jænberht of Canterbury was the senior archbishop and enjoyed precedence , although after Jænberht 's death in 792 Hygeberht became the foremost prelate in southern England . It is unknown if Jænberht ever acknowledged Hygeberht 's elevation as an archbishop , but there is no evidence that Jænberht contested the division of his archiepiscopal see and the creation of another archbishopric . Hygeberht consecrated Jænberht 's successor Æthelhard , after Offa consulted Alcuin of York about proper procedure . Hygeberht then was considered the senior prelate in the south of England , as shown by him being listed before Æthelhard in any charters they both appear on . 
 Canterbury retained as suffragans , or subordinates , the bishops of Winchester , Sherborne , Selsey , Rochester , and London . The dioceses of Worcester , Hereford , Leicester , Lindsey , Dommoc and Elmham were transferred to Lichfield . This listing , however , comes from the Gesta Pontificum Anglorum of the later medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury , written in about 1120 . Although the division is logical , William confuses Hygeberht with Hygeberht 's successor Ealdwulf , and does not give a source for his list , which suggest that it may be untrustworthy . The creation of a third archbishopric was controversial , and the community at Canterbury Cathedral seems never to have accepted Hygeberht as an archbishop . The historian D. P. Kirby speculates that there were always some in the Mercian kingdom who disapproved of the elevation of Lichfield to an archdiocese . 
 During Hygeberht 's archbishopric , joint synods for the provinces of Lichfield and Canterbury were held , presided over by both archbishops . These gatherings were canonically irregular , as the usual procedure was for each province to hold its own synod . The reasons for holding joint councils are unclear ; they may have been a manifestation of Offa 's desire to supervise the entire southern church , or an attempt by the archbishops of Canterbury to retain some authority over the province of Lichfield . 
 Offa died in July 796 and his son Ecgfrith 141 days later . Coenwulf , a distant relative , succeeded to the Mercian throne after Ecgfrith 's death . Soon after his accession Coenwulf sought to replace the two archdioceses with one at London , arguing that Pope Gregory I 's original plan had been that there be an archbishopric at London instead of at Canterbury . In 797 and 798 Coenwulf sent envoys to Rome to Pope Leo III , suggesting that a new archdiocese be created at London for Æthelhard . The king 's envoys laid the blame for the problems encountered with the Lichfield archdiocese on Pope Hadrian I 's incompetence . Displeased by criticism of the papacy , Leo ruled against the king 's plan . In 801 Coenwulf put down a Kentish rebellion , allowing him to once more assert his authority in Canterbury and control the archbishopric . Finally , in 802 , Pope Leo III granted that Hadrian 's decision was invalid , after the English clergy told him it had been achieved by Offa 's misrepresentation . Leo returned all jurisdiction to Canterbury , a decision announced by Æthelhard at the Council of Clovesho in 803 . 
 = = Resignation and death = = 
 Hygeberht had resigned his see before Lichfield was demoted back to a bishopric . He was still named as archbishop in 799 , but evidence suggests that he no longer controlled all of the suffragan bishops that he once had . Possibly , he was replaced at Lichfield ; his successor Ealdwulf attended a council in 801 , and was named bishop in the council 's records . By the time that Æthelhard held another council at Clovesho in 803 , Hygeberht was no longer even named as a bishop , and appears at that council as an abbot . Which abbey he was abbot of , and his exact date of death , are unknown . 
 Hygeberht 's contemporary at Canterbury , Æthelhard , was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to require an affirmation of faith from his subordinate bishops when they were elected . The historian Eric John argues that this custom began because of the creation of the archbishopric of Lichfield . 
 = Lepiota babruzalka = 
 Lepiota babruzalka is an agaric mushroom of the genus Lepiota in the order Agaricales . Described as new to science in 2009 , it is found in Kerala State , India , where it grows on the ground in litterfall around bamboo stems . Fruit bodies have caps that measure up to 1 @.@ 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 5 in ) in diameter , and are covered with reddish @-@ brown scales . The cap is supported by a long and slender stem up to 4 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) long and 1 @.@ 5 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 1 in ) thick . One of the distinguishing microscopic features of the species is the variably shaped cystidia found on the edges of the gills . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first described by Arun Kumar <unk> <unk> and P. <unk> in the journal Mycotaxon in 2009 , in a survey of the genus Lepiota in Kerala State in southern India . The holotype collection was made in 2004 in <unk> , located in the Kozhikode District ; it is now kept in the herbarium of Kew Gardens . The specific epithet babruzalka derives from the Sanskrit word for " brown @-@ scaled " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit bodies of Lepiota babruzalka have caps that start out roughly spherical , and as they expand become broadly convex , and eventually flat , with a blunt umbo . The cap attains a diameter of 1 – 1 @.@ 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 0 @.@ 5 in ) . Its whitish surface is covered with small , reddish @-@ brown , pressed @-@ down scales that are more numerous in the center . The margin is initially curved inward , but straightens out in age , and retains hanging remnants of the partial veil . The gills are white , and free from attachment to the stem . They are crowded together , with two or three tiers of interspersed lamellulae ( short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stem ) . Viewed with a hand lens , the edges of the gills appear to be fringed . The stem is cylindrical with a bulbous base , initially solid before becoming hollow , and measures 2 @.@ 6 – 4 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 0 – 1 @.@ 8 in ) long by 1 – 1 @.@ 5 mm thick . The stem surface is whitish , but will stain a light brown color if handled . In young fruit bodies , the stems have a whitish , membranous ring on the upper half , but the ring does not last long before disintegrating . The flesh is thin ( up to 1 mm ) , whitish , and lacks any appreciable odor . 
 Lepiota babruzalka produces a white spore print . Spores are roughly elliptical to somewhat cylindrical , hyaline ( translucent ) , and measure 5 @.@ 5 – 10 @.@ 5 by 3 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 5 µm . They are thick @-@ walled and contain a refractive oil droplet . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are club @-@ shaped , hyaline , and are one- to four @-@ spored with sterigmata up to 8 µm long ; the dimensions of the basidia are 15 – 20 by 7 – 8 µm . Cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the edge of the gill ) are plentiful , and can assume a number of shapes , including cylindrical to club @-@ shaped , utriform ( like a wineskin bottle ) , to ventricose @-@ rostrate ( where the basal and middle portions are swollen and the apex extends into a beak @-@ like protrusion ) . The cheilocystidia are thin @-@ walled , and measure 13 – 32 by 7 – 12 µm ; there are no cystidia on the gill faces ( pleurocystidia ) . 
 The gill tissue is made of thin @-@ walled hyphae containing a septum , which are hyaline to pale yellow , and measure 3 – 15 µm wide . The cap tissue comprises interwoven , inflated hyphae with widths between 2 and 25 µm . Neither the gill tissue nor the cap tissue show any color reaction when stained with Melzer 's reagent . Clamp connections are rare in the hyphae of Lepiota babruzalka .

 = Belgium in the long nineteenth century = 
 The History of Belgium from 1789 to 1914 , the period dubbed the " Long Nineteenth Century " by the historian Eric Hobsbawm , includes the end of Austrian rule and periods of French and Dutch occupation of the region , leading to the creation of the first independent Belgian state in 1830 . 
 In the years leading up to 1789 , the territory today known as Belgium was divided into two states , called the Austrian Netherlands and Prince @-@ Bishopric of Liège , both of which were part of the Holy Roman Empire . In the aftermath of the French Revolution , both states experienced revolutions in 1789 in which the old order was overthrown and new states created . These revolutions were condemned by the Holy Roman Empire and were crushed by 1792 . The territory was only briefly regained , however , as the area was captured by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars and incorporated into the French First Republic . This French period lasted roughly from 1794 to 1815 . In the aftermath of Napoleon 's final defeat in 1815 , the Congress of Vienna added the territory of Belgium to the Netherlands , and until 1830 , Belgium was part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands . 
 In 1830 , the Belgian provinces of the Netherlands revolted in the Belgian Revolution and declared their independence . Despite widespread international support for Belgian independence , fighting between Belgium and the Netherlands continued under the rule of King Leopold I. Belgian independence was finally recognized by the Dutch in 1839 . Under Leopold I 's reign , Belgium remained relatively stable and was only lightly affected by the Revolutions of 1848 . On his death in 1865 , his son Leopold II was inaugurated as King . Leopold II 's reign was dominated by the rise of the Socialist party and calls for reform to the voting system and military as well as the Schools ' War between Liberal and Catholic political factions . Although Belgian independence was briefly threatened during the Franco @-@ Prussian War , under Leopold II 's reign the country reached an unprecedented level of industrialization and prosperity , becoming the second most industrialized state in the world after Great Britain . The period was also marked by the creation of a personal colony by Leopold II , the Congo Free State . The subsequent international outcry over human rights abuses forced the Belgian state to annex the region in 1908 , forming the Belgian Congo . In 1909 , after his father 's death , Albert I began his reign , which lasted until 1934 . In the years leading up to the First World War , the process of military and voting reform begun in the 1880s was finally completed . Despite declaring neutrality , Belgium was invaded by the German Empire in August 1914 , beginning the country 's involvement in World War I. 
 The long nineteenth century saw profound cultural and economic changes in Belgium . The Industrial Revolution , which began to take effect in Belgium during the period of French rule , transformed the region 's economy over the course of the period . By 1914 , Belgium was acknowledged as one of the most densely industrialized countries in Europe , with notable coal mining and manufacturing industries . The period saw the gradual decline of the various dialects spoken in the country and the establishment of two distinct language groups , French in Wallonia and Dutch in Flanders . French , traditionally spoken by the elite , was given legal predominance across the country . During the nineteenth century , both linguistic groups witnessed a cultural resurgence and developed separate traditions in literature and culture . By the end of the period , the Flemish Movement , seeking legal equality for Dutch language and even regional independence , had emerged in Flanders and a similar movement developed in Wallonia . 
 = = General aspects = = 
 = = = Geography and demographics = = = 
 The territory of Belgium varied little over the period . Belgium 's border with the Netherlands was almost the same as that which had been created after the Dutch Revolt in the early 17th century , and its western border was almost the same as those of the 18th @-@ century polities the Austrian Netherlands and Prince @-@ Bishopric of Liège . It was only after the French annexation of 1795 that the territory became a single entity . In the 1830s , Belgian revolutionaries sought to create an independent state within the borders of the nine provinces that had been established under French occupation while ending the traditional roles of the small duchies , princedoms and counties which had traditionally been the basic territorial units . Aside from Zeelandic Flanders , part of Luxembourg , and Northern Limburg , which were ceded to the Dutch compensate for the loss of the rest of the territory , the outline of Belgium in 1914 was virtually identical to that established by the French in 1795 . The three ceded territories had a total of 300 @,@ 000 inhabitants at the time . 
 The northern half of Belgium , which would come to be known as Flanders , was a largely agricultural area containing the important port of Antwerp , the city of Ghent and the capital , Brussels . In the southern half , which would come to be known as Wallonia , a number of smaller towns and cities along the valley of the Sambre and Meuse rivers – the <unk> <unk> ( " industrial valley " ) – became the focus of industrialization . In the west of the valley , around Charleroi , was the Pays Noir ( " Black Country " ) , which held significant coal deposits . In southeast Belgium , along the border with Luxembourg and Prussia ( later Germany ) , was the heavily forested and agricultural region known as the Ardennes . 
 In 1784 , Belgium 's population was 2 @.@ 6 million , with just 25 percent living in cities . During the 19th century , the population both expanded and urbanized . Between 1830 and 1875 the population of Brussels grew from 100 @,@ 000 to 180 @,@ 000 , and by 1910 the population of the metropolitan area soared to 750 @,@ 000 . The population of Belgium was almost universally Roman Catholic , though free @-@ thinking movements like Freemasonry were also popular among intellectuals and the urban middle classes . 
 Throughout the long nineteenth century , as a common destination for political refugees , Belgium was home to important émigré communities , particularly in Brussels . From 1871 , many of the Paris Communards fled to Brussels , where they received political asylum . The far @-@ right politician General Georges Boulanger arrived in 1889 . Other notable exiles living in Belgium included the writer Victor Hugo and the theorist Karl Marx . 
 = = = Language = = = 
 While in control of Belgium , France and the Netherlands each tried to force assimilation of their national languages , but in neither case did their rule last long enough for the language to become fully entrenched across the region or for local dialects to be displaced . 
 In 1846 , 57 percent of Belgians spoke dialects of Dutch or Flemish as their primary language while 42 percent spoke dialects of French , such as Walloon , Picard or <unk> . Under one percent of the population spoke German . Across the country , the aristocracy and middle classes spoke French , often as a second language , and French was the language of the legal system and government . There was a huge variation in accents , spelling and grammar across the country , particularly in Flanders , where regional dialects were almost incomprehensible to those from other regions . 
 In Brussels , situated in a predominantly Dutch @-@ speaking area , 38 percent spoke French in 1842 while 61 percent spoke Dutch ; many residents spoke dialects such as <unk> instead of the standard languages . By the end of the period , social change and internal immigration from Wallonia contributed to the growing importance of French in Brussels .

 = = = Austrian rule and the Prince @-@ Bishopric of Liège = = = 
 In 1789 , the area of modern @-@ day Belgium was divided into two independently @-@ governed polities , both part of the Holy Roman Empire . The Austrian Netherlands , which included most of the territory of modern @-@ day Belgium , had been in existence since the end of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714 when the Habsburg Monarchy annexed the section called the Spanish Netherlands from the Spanish branch of the house . The traditional principalities , duchies and counties surviving from the Middle Ages retained great regional autonomy . The economy of the Austrian Netherlands developed little , as its neighboring states imposed high export tariffs and the port of Antwerp remained blocked by the Dutch . Although Enlightenment ideals developed among the urban bourgeoisie , most of the population remained suspicious of education and extremely politically conservative . The Catholic church was particularly influential , despite the attempts of Emperor Joseph II to reduce its power . 
 The Prince @-@ Bishopric of Liège was a small ecclesiastical state that had been in existence since the 10th century . It was ruled by a line of prince @-@ bishops . The state 's capital , Liège , was by the 1780s the largest city in Belgium . The prince @-@ bishopric was not a single continuous country , but rather consisted of several islands of territory surrounded by the Austrian Netherlands . One of the foremost industrial regions of the time , the prince @-@ bishopric was known for its successful wool , armaments and coal @-@ mining industries , and traded widely . The state was notionally governed by agreement of the Three Estates ( the clergy , the nobility , and commoners ) , but from 1684 , officials were elected by 16 separate chambers , each composed of wealthy nobles and guild members elected for life . Many groups were unrepresented , including the bourgeoisie , industrialists and lower clergy . The spread of the Enlightenment , which became popular in Liège in the 18th century , bred further discontent with the political system . 
 = = = = Revolutions of 1789 = = = = 
 On 18 August 1789 , just months after the start of the French Revolution , a revolution broke out in the Prince @-@ Bishopric of Liège . In a meeting at the town hall , the democrat Jean @-@ Nicolas <unk> called for the reinstatement of two popular mayors who had been dismissed by the prince @-@ bishop . The revolutionaries forced their way into the city 's citadel and forced Prince @-@ Bishop Constantin @-@ François de <unk> to ratify the appointments . The prince @-@ bishop acquiesced but fled the principality for Trier a few days later . With the prince @-@ bishop gone , the revolutionaries declared Liège a republic . Just twenty days after the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen had been approved in France , a nearly identical document was introduced in Liège declaring all citizens equal before the law and proclaiming freedom of thought and expression . Despite the revolutionaries pleading their case , the Diet of the Holy Roman Empire condemned the revolution and ordered the restoration of the old regime . The army of Liège was finally defeated by the Austrians , who re @-@ occupied the city in January 1791 . The Prince @-@ Bishop was reinstated . 
 In the Austrian Netherlands , a populist revolt called the Brabant Revolution broke out in 1789 as a result of the perceived injustices of the Austrian regime . Emperor Joseph II 's liberal reforms particularly angered Catholics , who feared a further decline in church influence , while for some his policies had not been sufficiently radical or liberal . Fighting began in October 1789 as an émigré patriot army in the neighboring Dutch Republic invaded the country and defeated the Austrians at Turnhout . The émigré army succeeded in pushing the Austrian forces out of all the territory except Luxembourg . A loose confederation of states in the region was formed as the United States of Belgium . The use of the word " Belgium " in 1789 was the first time that the term had been officially employed to denote the region since Roman times . The revolution was conservative in character , not seeking to create a radically different social or religious order . Once established , the revolutionaries divided into political factions . The liberal <unk> , led by Jan Frans Vonck , were eventually denounced and forced into exile by their conservative rivals , the <unk> , led by Henri Van der Noot . The Brabant revolutionaries were finally defeated by Holy Roman forces , who occupied Brussels in December 1790 . 
 Following the crushing of the two revolutions , a number of Brabant and Liège revolutionaries regrouped in Paris , where they formed the joint Committee of United Belgians and <unk> ( Comité des <unk> et <unk> <unk> ) , which united revolutionaries from both territories for the first time . Three Belgian corps and a Liège Legion were levied to continue the fight for the French against the Austrians .

Though the French defeated the Austrian army in the Battle of Jemappes in 1792 and briefly occupied the Austrian Netherlands and Prince @-@ Bishopric of Liège , they were pushed out by an Austrian counterattack in the Battle of Neerwinden the following year . In June 1794 , French revolutionary troops expelled Holy Roman forces from the region for the last time after the Battle of Fleurus . The French government voted to formally annex the territory in October 1795 and it was split into nine provincial départements within France . 
 French rule in the region was marked by the rapid implementation and extension of numerous reforms which had been passed in post @-@ Revolution France since 1789 . Administration was organized under the French model , with meritocratic selection . Legal equality and state secularism were also introduced . 
 The important University of Louvain was dissolved and re @-@ founded without its religious status . In Liège , Jacobin @-@ inspired locals pulled down the medieval St. Lambert 's Cathedral . Use of the French language was actively encouraged and publications in Dutch banned as the government tried to integrate the territory into France , leaving a lasting legacy . Contingents of Belgian revolutionaries had served in the French army since 1792 , but after the occupation , compulsory military conscription was extended to Belgians , 160 @,@ 000 of whom were forced into the French army by 1813 . The policy was extremely unpopular , and an insurrection known as the Peasants ' War broke out in East Flanders and the Ardennes in 1798 in response . The revolt , which spread rapidly , was quickly and violently suppressed by the French . Under Napoleon , the Code Napoleon , which would form the basis of all future Belgian legal codes , was implemented . 
 The period of French rule coincided with the start of the Industrial Revolution in Belgium . Use of mechanical production techniques was encouraged by the French state . The government particularly encouraged industrialization of Belgian industries of military use , such as the cannon foundries at Liège . 
 As the course of the Napoleonic Wars turned , the territory was invaded by Russian and Prussian forces . After Napoleon 's defeat and exile in 1814 , the Southern Netherlands were occupied jointly by the Austrians , Prussians and Dutch . In an attempt to strengthen their position in Belgium , the Austrians began to recruit a Belgian Legion of infantry , cavalry and artillery , which was merged with the Dutch army . The Hundred Days ' Campaign , launched by Napoleon after his escape from exile , was largely fought in Belgium in early 1815 , and Napoleon 's final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo occurred just miles from Brussels . 
 = = = Dutch rule = = = 
 After Napoleon 's total defeat in 1815 , the Congress of Vienna merged the French territory in Belgium with the Netherlands to form the United Kingdom of the Netherlands as a buffer state against the French . It was ruled by William I of Orange . The synergy of combining the manufacturing centers in Belgium with the important exporting ports in the Netherlands encouraged growth of the industrial cloth manufacturing and metallurgic centers in Wallonia . Keen to promote the economic development of the southern provinces as well , William I founded the Société Générale des Pays @-@ Bas in 1822 to provide businesses with capital to invest in machinery . The Société Générale served as a driving force behind Belgian industrialization in the 19th century , and at its height controlled large swathes of the national economy . William I also encouraged the creation of educational facilities in the Southern Provinces , founding the State University of Leuven , the University of Liège and Ghent University in 1817 . 
 The period of Dutch rule saw growing hostility between the Catholic Belgian provinces and the predominantly Protestant Dutch . The Belgian provinces also complained that they were underrepresented by the Kingdom 's system of government , where 55 Belgian deputies were allocated to represent 3 @.@ 5 million people , while an equal number of Dutch deputies represented just two million . When the States @-@ General voted against adopting the new unrepresentative constitution , William declared that the minority favorable vote outweighed the negative vote . Liberals in Belgium also accused William of attacking personal and religious freedoms . 
 = = = Belgian Revolution = = = 
 The Belgian Revolution broke out on 25 August 1830 , after the performance of a nationalist opera ( La muette de Portici ) in Brussels led to a minor insurrection among the capital 's bourgeoisie , who sang patriotic songs and captured some public buildings in the city . This early revolutionary group was swelled by a large number of urban workers . The following day , the revolutionaries began flying their own flag , clearly influenced by that of the Brabant Revolution of 1789 . To maintain order , several bourgeois militia groups were formed . The situation in Brussels led to widespread unrest across the country . William I rejected his son 's advice to negotiate with the rebels , forcing them towards a more radical , pro @-@ independence stance , and sent a large military force to Brussels suppress the insurrection . 
 Between 23 and 27 September 1830 , heavy fighting took place between Dutch forces and Brussels revolutionaries , who were reinforced by small contingents from across the country . The Dutch were eventually forced to retreat . In the aftermath of the failed attack and concurrent mass desertions of Belgian soldiers from the Dutch army , the revolution spread around Belgium . Dutch garrisons were pushed out of the area , until only Antwerp and Luxembourg remained occupied . The Provisional Government of Belgium , led by Charles Rogier , was formed on 24 September and Belgian independence was officially proclaimed on 4 October while work began on creating a constitution . In December , international governments at the Conference of London recognized the independence of Belgium and guaranteed its neutrality . The Dutch , however , only recognized Belgium 's independence and the terms of the Conference in 1839 and the Dutch @-@ Belgian frontier was only fixed by the 1843 Treaty of Maastricht . 
 = = = = Creation of the Belgian Constitution = = = = 
 In November 1830 , a National Congress was established to create a Belgian constitution . Fears of mob rule associated with republicanism after the French Revolution of 1789 , as well as the example of the recent July Revolution in France , led the Congress to decide that Belgium would be a popular , constitutional monarchy . The Congress approached several candidates , but chose Leopold of Saxe @-@ Coburg @-@ Gotha , a minor but well @-@ connected German noble , to be the first King of the Belgians . He was officially inaugurated on 21 July 1831 , after taking an oath to abide by the Constitution . Leopold I was generally unsatisfied with the amount of power allocated to the monarch , and sought to extend it wherever the Constitution was ambiguous or unclear while generally avoiding involvement in routine politics . 
 The Constitution developed by the National Congress was implemented in July 1831 . It guaranteed individual liberty , property rights , freedom of religion and the press , and equality before the law . Because of its perceived balance between freedom and rule of law , it was praised by liberals around the world and promoted as a model for future constitutions . Under the new constitution , Belgium had two chambers , a Chamber of Representatives and Senate , both elected by a small number of wealthy citizens . The King was allowed substantial power in military affairs , but was given little independent power in any other sphere , which was instead given to the elected chambers . 
 = = = Reign of Leopold I = = = 
 Leopold I was crowned on 21 July 1831 , replacing Baron <unk> de <unk> , who had served as regent since February . Before his selection by the National Congress , Leopold had been Duke of the minor German state of Saxe @-@ Coburg and Gotha . He had pursued a distinguished military career fighting for the Russian Empire during the Napoleonic Wars and was well connected to other European monarchies . 
 Despite the Congress of London 's verdict in 1830 , the Dutch continued to resist Belgian independence for much of Leopold I 's early reign . On 2 August 1831 , days after Leopold 's coronation , the Dutch launched an invasion known as the Ten Days ' Campaign . The 50 @,@ 000 @-@ strong Dutch force crossed the border and rapidly pushed the small Belgian army back as far as Leuven . Faced with a military disaster , the Belgian government appealed to the French for support . Without international support of their own and faced with an entire French army under General Étienne Gérard , the Dutch withdrew on 12 August . In 1832 the French pushed the Dutch out of Antwerp , their final garrison in Belgium . Much of the city was destroyed in the fighting . Sporadic skirmishes along the border continued until 1839 , when the Dutch signed the Treaty of London . The Ten Days ' Campaign revealed the fragility of the Belgian position , and although the Dutch finally recognized the independence of Belgium , the Belgians were forced to give up some disputed territories , including Zeelandic Flanders and the Duchy of Limburg . Part of Luxembourg , equivalent to the modern state , remained as a semi @-@ independent protectorate of the Dutch until 1890 . 
 = = = = Politics and the Crisis of the 1840s = = = = 
 Politics in Belgium under Leopold I were polarized between liberal and Catholic political factions , though before 1847 they collaborated in unionist governments . The liberals were opposed to the church and particularly opposed its influence in politics and society , while supporting free trade , personal liberties and secularization . The Catholics saw religious teachings as a fundamental basis for the state and society and opposed all attempts by the liberals to attack the church 's official privileges . Initially , these factions existed only as informal groups with which prominent politicians were generally identified . The liberals held power over much of Leopold I 's reign . An official Liberal Party was formed in 1846 , although a formal Catholic Party was only established in 1869 . Gradually , these political groups would also spread into Belgium 's society , creating a process of social stratification known as <unk> . Leopold , who was Protestant , tended to favor Liberals and shared their desire for reform , though he was not partisan . 
 Leopold I 's reign was marked by an economic crisis which lasted until the late 1850s . In the aftermath of the revolution , the Dutch had closed the Scheldt to Belgian shipping , making the port of Antwerp effectively useless . The Netherlands and the Dutch colonies , which had been profitable markets for Belgian manufacturers before 1830 , were totally closed to Belgian goods . The years between 1845 and 1849 , known as the Crisis of the 1840s , were particularly hard in Flanders where harvests failed and a third of the population became dependent on poor relief . The period has been described as the " worst years of Flemish history " . The economic situation in Flanders increased the internal migration to Brussels and the industrial areas of Wallonia , which continued throughout the period . 
 = = = = Upheaval of 1848 = = = = 
 By 1847 , Belgium was suffering from economic destabilization as Belgian exporters faced increasing competition from new British firms . Radical parties like the Association Démocratique , founded in 1847 at the instigation of Karl Marx , who had briefly lived in Brussels in exile , actively agitated against the unpopular Liberal government under Charles Rogier . However , the success of the Liberals ' economic reforms partially mitigated the effects of the economic downturn , which meant that Belgium was not as badly affected as its neighbors by the Revolutions of 1848 . Nevertheless , in early 1848 , a large number of radical publications appeared . 
 The most serious threat of the 1848 revolutions in Belgium was posed by Belgian émigré groups . Shortly after the revolution in France , Belgian migrant workers living in Paris were encouraged to return to Belgium to overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic . Around 6 @,@ 000 armed émigrés of the Belgian Legion attempted to cross the Belgian frontier . The first group , travelling by train , was stopped and quickly disarmed at <unk> on 26 March 1848 . The second group crossed the border on 29 March and headed for Brussels . They were confronted by Belgian troops at the hamlet of <unk> @-@ Tout and , during fighting , seven émigrés were killed and most of the rest were captured . The defeat at <unk> @-@ Tout effectively ended the revolutionary threat to Belgium . The situation stabilized that summer after a good harvest , and fresh elections returned a strong Liberal majority . 
 = = = Reign of Leopold II = = = 
 Leopold II was sworn in as king of the Belgians in 1865 . His reign coincided with the Belle Époque and rapid economic expansion from the 1880s . It was characterized by the resurgence of the Catholic Party , political confrontation over military action , educational and franchise reform and his creation of a personal empire in Africa . 
 One of Leopold 's long @-@ term preoccupations was increasing the international standing and influence of his country . Throughout much of his early reign , Leopold hoped to regain the territories which had been ceded to the Netherlands in 1839 , particularly Luxembourg , which he viewed as an integral piece of Belgian territory . He also pushed for the implementation of conscription and reforms to the military , many of which would only be realized after his death . From the 1870s , he tried to persuade several Belgian prime ministers to support the creation of an overseas colony in the Far East or Africa to increase Belgian wealth and political influence . After being repeatedly turned down , he launched a personal venture to colonize the Congo river basin in central Africa , without the backing or support of the Belgian state . Some of the vast personal wealth he accumulated from the colony was spent on construction of grandiose public buildings across Belgium , earning him the nickname " Builder King " ( roi <unk> ) . 
 Most of these projects were focused in Brussels , where he constructed two large palaces , and Ostende , where a vast colonnaded arcade was built along the seafront in an attempt to turn the town into a fashionable seaside resort . During Leopold 's reign , Belgium hosted five prestigious World Exhibitions , in 1885 , 1888 , 1894 , 1897 and 1905 , as well as a major national exhibition in 1880 to mark the 50th anniversary of Belgian independence . 
 Politically , Leopold disliked the Socialist party , preferring to negotiate with the Catholic Party , which held power for much of his reign . He was widely distrusted by politicians , who saw him as meddling in state business and seeking to expand the power of the monarchy . Towards the end of his reign , public awareness of the atrocities committed under his colonial regime , as well as his marital infidelity , led to a significant fall the monarchy 's popularity . Following his death in December 1909 , his funeral cortege was booed . 
 Although Belgium was officially neutral throughout his reign , significant numbers of Belgians volunteered to fight for right @-@ wing causes abroad . From 1860 , large numbers of Belgian Catholic volunteers went to Italy in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to defend the independence of the Papal States against Giuseppe Garibaldi 's revolutionaries . The Zouaves , as they were known , were ultimately unsuccessful and the Papal States fell in 1870 . A volunteer Belgian Legion fought alongside French forces in the Mexican Adventure from 1864 on behalf of Mexican Emperor Maximilian I , whose wife was the daughter of Leopold I. The unit suffered heavy casualties at the Battle of <unk> in 1865 , and after heavy fighting was disbanded in December 1866 . 
 = = = = " Belgian Question " and Franco @-@ Prussian War = = = = 
 When the Franco @-@ Prussian War broke out in July 1870 , Belgium was confronted with the greatest threat to its independence since 1848 . Shortly before the conflict , a draft treaty from the Austro @-@ Prussian War of 1866 between Napoleon III and German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck discussing the annexation of Belgium as the price for French neutrality was made public . Napoleon III had also attempted to annex Luxembourg into the French Empire in 1868 , which seemed to contemporaries a parallel of Belgium . European powers worried that French encroachment into Belgium would destabilize the Concert of Europe . The issue became known as the " Belgian Question " . As the conflict began , Leopold and his advisors believed that either France or Prussia might try to outflank their opponent by disregarding Belgian neutrality and launching an invasion . The Belgian army was mobilized on the same day that both French and Prussian reserves were called up . As French troops moved towards the border , panic ensued in Belgium . The national gold reserves were evacuated to the National Redoubt fortress at Antwerp . After a restatement of the British guarantee of Belgian neutrality by Prime Minister Gladstone , Belgium was able to remain neutral , though much of the fighting ( including the key Battle of Sedan ) occurred just south of the Belgian border . More crucially , the mobilization of the Belgian army , which was divided into a mobile Army of Observation to guard the frontier and the static Army of Antwerp to hold the National Redoubt , revealed key structural problems in the military , particularly with the system of conscription . Events also re @-@ emphasized the importance of the Treaty of London to Belgium 's survival . 
 = = = = Military reform = = = = 
 Leopold viewed a strong military as the key to maintaining Belgian independence against France and , after the Franco @-@ Prussian War , an expansionist Germany . After cutting the defense budget in the 1860s , the government was advised by a military commission to increase the size of the army and to abolish the system of Remplacement , whereby rich Belgians selected for military service by lot could pay for a substitute to take their place . Leopold II personally lobbied successive governments to implement the findings of the report and institute a fundamental reform of the army . Reform was opposed by both the Liberal and Catholic Parties , which viewed the army with suspicion and Remplacement as a key civil right . In a move supported only by the socialists , Remplacement was abolished in 1909 . This was the last legal document signed before Leopold 's death . Under the new system , one son per family would be liable for military service regardless of social class but the total size of the military remained the same . 
 Although military reform was delayed until the end of his reign , Leopold did succeed in convincing parliament of the need to extend Belgium 's defenses . Construction of fortresses along the border by both the French and Germans in the mid @-@ 1880s worried the Belgian government that their country might be used as an invasion route . In 1887 , a program of fortification construction began along the Sambre and Meuse rivers . Designed by the leading military architect Henri Alexis <unk> , nine forts were built at Namur to guard against an offensive from France , while twelve were built around Liège , near the German border . Completed in 1892 , they supplemented the existing National Redoubt at Antwerp , which was later modernized and extended . The fortifications would play a major role in the opening stages of the First World War . 
 = = = = School War = = = = 
 The political rivalry between Liberal and Catholic parties peaked between 1879 and 1884 , when they clashed on the issue of religion in primary education . In June 1879 , a Liberal majority government under Walthère Frère @-@ Orban succeeded in passing an Education Act <unk> primary education across the country , starting the so @-@ called First School War . New " neutral " schools funded by the local communes with assistance from national government were to be established in all municipalities , while Catholic schools were to receive no support at all . Outraged at the perceived challenge to its authority , the Catholic church encouraged a boycott of the schools . Though 3 @,@ 885 secular schools opened across the country by 1883 , attendance in private Catholic schools rose from 13 percent to over 60 percent of eligible students . 
 After elections in 1884 , a Catholic government under Jules <unk> passed a new Education Law providing public financial support for religious schools . Religious education became compulsory in all schools in 1895 . The Catholic Party 's triumph in the issue was another blow to the already @-@ weakened Liberal Party , and ushered in a period of almost unbroken Catholic government until World War II . 
 = = = = Colonialism = = = = 
 Even before his accession to the throne in 1865 , Leopold began lobbying leading Belgian politicians to create a colonial empire in the Far East or Africa , which would expand Belgian prestige . Politically , however , colonization was extremely unpopular , as it was perceived as a risky and expensive gamble with no obvious benefit to the country and his many attempts were rejected : 
 Belgium does not need a colony . Belgians are not drawn towards overseas enterprises : they prefer to spend their energy and capital in countries which have already been explored or on less risky schemes ... Still , you can assure His Majesty of my whole @-@ hearted sympathy for the generous plan he had conceived , as long as the Congo does not make any international difficulties for us . 
 Determined to look for a colony for himself and inspired by recent reports from central Africa , Leopold began patronizing a number of leading explorers , including Henry Morton Stanley . Leopold established the International African Association , a charitable organization to oversee the exploration and surveying of a territory based around the Congo River , with the stated goal of bringing humanitarian assistance and civilization to the natives . In the Berlin Conference of 1884 – 85 , European leaders officially recognized Leopold 's control over the 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 square miles ( 2 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 km2 ) of the notionally @-@ independent Congo Free State . 
 Leopold , however , reneged on his humanitarian promises , and instead brutally exploited the locals and the land to gain what profit he could . Initially , the Congo Free State relied on exporting ivory to pay for its upkeep and to fund the Congo Arab war and Emin Pasha Relief Expedition in the Eastern Congo . As rubber became an important resource in the 1890s , it quickly surpassed ivory as a profitable export , which allowed the colony to become extremely profitable for the first time . Monopoly concessions to collect rubber in large areas of territory were sold to private companies , and the Force Publique , the state 's private army , was used to force locals to collect it . In some cases , Congolese people who failed to meet their quota were killed or had one of their hands cut off . The system was immensely profitable , but the population of the Congo is thought to have been reduced by as many as ten million during the period that the colony was under Leopold 's control . 
 Eventually , growing scrutiny of Leopold 's regime led to a popular campaign movement , centered in Britain and America , to force Leopold to renounce his ownership of the Congo . The " Belgian solution " they proposed was for Belgium to annex it in order to end the overexploitation without disrupting the delicate balance of power in colonial Africa . In 1908 , as a direct result of this campaign , Belgium formally annexed the territory , creating the Belgian Congo . 
 = = = = Rise of socialism and franchise extension = = = = 
 The reign of Leopold II saw the rise of organized socialist political groups and parties , most notably among the industrial workers in Wallonia . The early socialist movement was characterized by a successful co @-@ operative movement in Flanders . Trade unions were legalized in 1866 , opening the way to organized labor politics . The International Workingmen 's Association held its first conference outside Switzerland in Brussels in 1868 as Belgian socialism , under figures such as César De <unk> , expanded dramatically . 
 The first real socialist political party in the country , the Belgian Workers ' Party ( POB @-@ <unk> ) , was founded in 1885 . The small numbers of workers who were allowed to vote in general elections meant that it achieved little success via conventional political channels . In 1886 , rioting and violence broke out among industrial workers in Liège , then spread across Wallonia , and was only repressed by the military . Numerous politicians of the Workers ' Party were arrested by the government in the subsequent backlash , but a wave of industrial legislation , including reforms to ban child labor and limit working hours , were introduced in the aftermath of the strike . The government reaction to the strikes and their bloody repression were criticized by contemporaries : 
 There exists but one country in the civilised world where every strike is eagerly and joyously turned into a pretext for the official massacre of the Working Class . That country of single blessedness is Belgium ! the [ sic ] model state of continental constitutionalism , the snug , well @-@ hedged , little paradise of the landlord , the capitalist , and the priest . ... The massacre of this year does not differ from last year 's massacre , but by the <unk> number of its victims , the more hideous ferocity of an otherwise ridiculous army , the noisier jubilation of the clerical and capitalist press , and the intensified frivolity of the pretexts put forward by the governmental butchers . 
 Despite making a rapid recovery , the Belgian Workers ' Party was still penalized by the Belgian electoral system , which based suffrage on wealth , stopping most of the party 's support base among industrial workers from voting . In August 1885 , the party began its Antwerp Programme , which called for universal suffrage while confirming the party 's intention to pursue its goals through parliamentary democracy rather than revolution . The culmination of this policy was the 1893 Belgian General Strike , involving some 250 @,@ 000 workers . Fearing a revolution , the government adopted universal male suffrage in 1894 , but only with plural voting , which allowed up to two additional votes for wealthy or educated citizens . Nevertheless , the percentage of the population eligible to vote rose from 3 @.@ 9 to 37 @.@ 3 percent , and in the 1894 elections the socialists won 28 of 152 seats . The Belgian Workers ' Party called two further unsuccessful general strikes in 1902 and 1913 in an attempt to end the plural voting system . 
 The new voting system increased the socialists ' influence in parliament significantly , but its major beneficiaries were the Catholic Party . Partly as a result of the creation of a Catholic populist challenger , the Christian People 's Party , the Catholic Party embraced the new ideology of Social Catholicism introduced following the papal Rerum <unk> encyclical of 1891 . This gained it considerable popular support , especially in Flanders . In 1894 , the Belgian Workers ' Party adopted the Charter of <unk> , which would form the basis of its ideology until 1979 . By 1911 , the party had 276 @,@ 000 members , making it one of the most successful Socialist parties in Europe . As a result of lobbying by the Belgian Workers ' Party , Belgium was one of the first countries in Europe to launch a comprehensive social insurance scheme , including sickness compensation ( from 1894 ) , voluntary old @-@ age insurance ( 1900 ) and unemployment insurance ( 1907 ) . The big losers from voting reform were the Liberals who lost almost all their parliamentary representation in the years between 1894 and 1900 . 
 = = = Reign of Albert I ( to 1914 ) = = = 
 Albert I inherited the throne after the death of Leopold II in 1909 . His rule ended with his death in 1934 , encompassing the final half @-@ decade of the long 19th century and continuing through the First World War and into the Interbellum . The period 1909 to 1913 was marked by continued economic confidence , and two World 's fair were hosted in Belgium in 1910 and in 1913 . 
 In 1913 , a huge general strike took place across the country at the instigation of the Belgian Workers ' Party on the issue of voting rights . The system of plural voting , in force since 1893 , was extremely unpopular because of its perceived unfairness , but also because the system tended to favor the Catholic Party . Although between 300 @,@ 000 and 450 @,@ 000 workers were involved , the strike was ultimately unsuccessful . The party voted in favor ending the strike and taking future action by parliamentary means , on 22 April 1913 . 
 The issue of military reform , which had been extremely contentious right up to the end of Leopold II 's reign , continued to be important up to the outbreak of the First World War . Under the influence of pro @-@ militarist lobbying , expansion and further reform of the army was discussed in parliament , and a new system of universal military conscription was adopted in 1913 . 
 = = = = Prelude to World War I = = = = 
 From as early as 1904 , Alfred von Schlieffen of the German General Staff began to draw up a military strategy , known as the Schlieffen Plan , which could be put into action if Germany found itself involved in a two @-@ front war against France and Russia . The core of the plan was a rapid attack on France on the outbreak of war , forcing a quick victory in the west before the Russians had time to fully mobilize their forces . The Schlieffen Plan took advantage of the French military 's concentration and fortifications along the Franco @-@ German border by prescribing an invasion of neutral Belgium and Luxembourg . According to the plan , the German army would rapidly overwhelm the Belgian military and then move quickly through the country and then towards Paris . The general staff believed that none of the signatories would be willing to honor their commitments from the 1839 Treaty of London , which a German diplomat dismissed as a " scrap of paper " . 
 On 2 August 1914 , following the events leading to the outbreak of World War I , the Germans presented an ultimatum to the Belgian government demanding permission to move German soldiers through the country . The ultimatum stated that Belgian independence would be reinstated upon German victory and that reparations would be made afterwards . Luxembourg was invaded and occupied by the Germans the same day . On 3 August , the Belgian government rejected the proposal and the German invasion began . Contrary to the Germans ' expectations , Great Britain , along with the British Empire , declared war on Germany as the Treaty of London had demanded . 
 The reorganization of the Belgian army that had begun in 1913 was only due to be completed in 1926 . Consequently at the outbreak of war , the Belgian army was under @-@ strength and largely unprepared . Albert I took personal command of the 265 @,@ 000 @-@ strong Belgian army . However , they could do little against the 1 @.@ 5 million @-@ strong German invading force . Between August and October 1914 , the Germans took the fortified cities of Liège , Namur and Antwerp and occupied Brussels . The fortified positions proved little match for the greatly improved siege artillery available to the Germans at the time , although the greater @-@ than @-@ expected defence did buy some time for the French and British to react . By the end of October , the Belgian army had been forced into a small pocket along the Yser river in the far west . In a surprising victory , the Belgian army managed to halt the German advance at the Yser , paving the way for the static trench warfare that which would characterize the Western Front for the next four years . Most of Belgium , however , was occupied by Germany and would remain under German control until 1918 .

 = = = Industrialisation = = = 
 Belgium was the first country in continental Europe to experience the Industrial Revolution , and was the most intensively industrialized country in the world throughout most of the period . Belgian industrialized rapidly over the nineteenth century , with a focus on iron , coal and textile production . By 1914 , Belgium had extensive rail networks , mines and factories , and a productive export sector . 
 The Industrial Revolution is usually considered to have been spread from Britain to Belgium by two British industrialists , William and John Cockerill , who moved to Liège in 1807 and formed a company producing industrial machinery and iron . Industrial development was possible in Belgium because of large coal deposits located in the <unk> <unk> along the Sambre @-@ Meuse river valley . Although the town of Ghent , a centre of cotton production in Flanders , industrialised rapidly , the effects of the Industrial Revolution were most felt in Wallonia , particularly in the cities of Mons , Charleroi , Liège and Verviers . By the 1840s , Cockerill was the world 's largest manufacturer of steel . Belgium also rapidly developed a large railway system . From the outset , the Belgian state supported the construction of railways , envisaging a railway link between the industrial region of Mons and the port of Antwerp via Brussels . The first stretch of this line , one of the first railways in Europe , opened in 1835 between Brussels and Mechelen . 
 Belgian firms initially copied and mass @-@ produced British designs , but soon began specializing in railway materials , chemicals , weapons and raw materials . These items were all widely exported , making Belgium one of the foremost industrial powers in the world . One of the most successful exporters was Édouard Empain , nicknamed the " Tramway King " , whose company ran infrastructure projects across Europe , Asia and South America . Empain 's projects included the Paris Métro system , completed in 1900 , and the entire Egyptian suburb of Heliopolis , which was finished in 1905 . 
 = = = Language division = = = 
 As the independent state of Belgium consolidated after the Revolution , the issue of a consensus language in the country became an increasingly important political question . At the start of the period , French was the dominant language , and was the only language that was approved for use in legal and government business anywhere in the country . It was also the language of the economic and social elite , even in Flanders . By the 1860s , with Flemish dialects in decline , increasing numbers of Flemish people of all social classes were bilingual , paralleling a similar decline in northern France . However , partly inspired by a resurgence in Flemish literature and culture , the <unk> political movement began to develop , with their first political parties formed in the 1860s and 70s . Political agitation by <unk> groups , often directed by local priests , led to Belgium becoming officially bilingual in 1870 . Teaching Dutch in all secondary schools in Flanders became compulsory , reinforcing the language 's presence . By 1898 , Dutch was officially recognized as an equal language to French in legal matters . During the first decades of the 20th century , the Flemish Movement became increasingly radicalized and began to develop as a mass political movement ( although not a united one ) , fully emerging during the First World War . 
 In the 1880s , a Walloon Movement began to emerge in parallel to the Flemish Movement . The early Walloon Movement developed in reaction to the perceived discrimination against French language as Dutch was progressively accorded equality . At the same time , the movement called on a " Walloon identity " rather than a Belgian one . In his famous Lettre au roi sur la <unk> de la Wallonie et de la Flandre ( " Letter to the King on the separation of Wallonia and Flanders " ) published in 1912 , the Walloon socialist Jules <unk> argued that the language division in Belgium was irreconcilable , famously stating that " In Belgium , there are the Walloons and the Flemish . There are no Belgians . " 
 = = = Literature = = = 
 The 19th century saw a flourishing of Belgian literature in both French and Dutch languages . In Flanders , the Literary Romanticist movement , aided by a renewed interest in Belgium 's medieval past , flourished under authors including Hendrik Conscience , who is credited as " father of the Flemish novel " , and poets like <unk> van <unk> . Conscience 's most famous work , De Leeuw van Vlaanderen ( " The Lion of Flanders " , 1838 ) , portrayed a romantic and heavily embellished account of the County of Flanders ' fight against the French in the 14th century , with the Flemish victory at the Battle of the Golden Spurs in 1302 as the centerpiece . De Leeuw van Vlaanderen became a source of inspiration for the Flemish Movement and remains one of the best examples of Flemish literature . 
 From the 1860s , Flemish literature began to reflect the Realist style already popular in France , under writers such as Anton Bergmann and Virginie <unk> . The works feature detailed depictions of ordinary aspects of daily life and often have a pessimistic tone . Heavily influenced by Belgian dialects such as West Flemish , the poet and priest Guido <unk> produced lyric poems in Dutch from the 1850s until his death in 1899 . In 1893 , the cultural magazine Van Nu en <unk> ( " Of Today and Tomorrow " ) was launched to bring Flemish literature to an audience outside Belgium . Flemish literature continued to flourish in the first decades of the 20th century under writers such as Stijn <unk> . 
 In Wallonia , literature in French began a revival in 1881 with the creation of the La Jeune Belgique ( " The Young Belgium " ) movement , which supported the creation of distinctively Belgian literature and opposed romanticism . Among the members of the Jeune Belgique were the writer Camille Lemonnier , whose works were often set against the background of Belgian peasant life in the naturalist style , and the poet Charles Van <unk> . French language poetry flourished in Belgium in the early 20th century under Émile <unk> and Maurice Maeterlinck ; Maeterlinck was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1911 . 
 = Kevin Clash = 
 Kevin Jeffrey Clash ( born September 17 , 1960 ) is an American puppeteer whose characters include Elmo , Clifford , Benny Rabbit , and Hoots the Owl . 
 Clash developed an interest in puppetry at an early age , and began performing for local TV children 's shows in his hometown of Baltimore , Maryland , as a teenager . In the early 1980s , he began working in Captain Kangaroo , and began performing in Sesame Street in 1984 . He was the fifth puppeteer to perform Elmo , the character he became the most famous for , and became an executive producer and director for the show . Clash worked in various productions for the Muppets and Jim Henson Productions and in other projects . He resigned from Sesame Street in late 2012 , after allegations of sexual impropriety , which he denied and were dismissed due to statute of limitations expiring . Clash wrote an autobiography , My Life as a Furry Red Monster , which was published in 2006 , and also featured in the 2011 documentary Being Elmo : A Puppeteer 's Journey . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Kevin Clash was born in Baltimore , Maryland , on September 17 , 1960 , the third of four children born to George Clash , a flash welder and handyman , and Gladys Clash , who ran a small daycare center in their two @-@ bedroom , one @-@ bath home in the Turner Station of Dundalk , Maryland . Clash developed an interest in puppetry at an early age , inspired by children 's shows like <unk> , Fran and Ollie and Sesame Street . He made his first puppet , a version of Mickey Mouse , at the age of 10 . When he was twelve , he created a monkey puppet out of the lining of his father 's coat . His first performances were for his mother 's daycare children . 
 By the time he was a teenager , he had built almost 90 puppets , which he based upon commercials , popular music , and his friends . While still in high school , Clash performed at venues throughout Baltimore , including schools , churches , fundraisers , and community events . While appearing at a neighborhood festival , Clash was discovered by Baltimore television personality Stu Kerr , who became Clash 's first mentor and hired him to perform in the children 's show Caboose at Channel 2 . Clash also built puppets for the Romper Room franchise . When he was 17 , he contacted and met puppeteer Kermit Love , who became Clash 's mentor , after seeing Love featured in an episode of the documentary Call It Macaroni . In 1979 , on Love 's recommendation , Clash appeared as Cookie Monster in the Sesame Street float during the Macy 's Thanksgiving Parade , and met Jim Henson , who later became his boss , mentor , and friend . 
 When he was nineteen , Clash became a puppeteer for Captain Kangaroo , initially as a guest performer , in which he also made occasional on @-@ camera appearances . The producers of Captain Kangaroo used some of Clash 's puppet creations for the show . In 1984 , Clash had to turn down Henson 's offer to work on his film The Dark Crystal because he was working on two TV shows at the same time , Captain Kangaroo and Love 's syndicated program The Great Space Coaster , in which he was producer for the first time . 
 = = Career = = 
 Captain Kangaroo was cancelled in 1984 after 29 seasons , and Great Space Coaster ended , freeing up Clash to work on projects with Henson such as the film Labyrinth and Sesame Street . Clash started working at Sesame Street for ten episodes in 1983 , mostly performing nondescript , stand @-@ in puppets known as Anything Muppets . Some of his earliest characters included the saxophone @-@ playing Hoots the Owl ( based on Louis Armstrong ) , the infant Baby Natasha , and inventor Dr. Nobel Price . After 1985 , Elmo , a furry red monster , became his main character . Four puppeteers , including Richard Hunt , had performed Elmo previously , but it was Clash 's development , with a falsetto voice , that established the character . He based Elmo 's character on the preschool children that attended his mother 's daycare in Baltimore and upon his own personality and the personality of his parents . Clash followed the advice of fellow puppeteer Frank Oz , who told Clash to always " find one special hook " for each character . Clash decided that the central characteristic for Elmo should be that he " should represent love " . 
 After the height of Elmo 's popularity , especially the " Tickle Me Elmo " craze in 1996 , Clash 's responsibilities at Sesame Street increased . He recruited , auditioned , and trained its puppeteers , and became the senior Muppet coordinator , a writer , director , and co @-@ producer of the " Elmo 's World " segment of the show . Clash worked with and mentored the puppeteers of Sesame Street 's international co @-@ productions . He found working with the co @-@ productions " a lot of fun " and " very rewarding " . He worked on the 1985 feature film Follow That Bird . In 2007 , he was promoted to senior creative adviser for the Sesame Workshop . Until 2011 , he was the sole performer as Elmo in all his public relations appearances , making his schedule , as he called it , " crazy " . Cheryl Henson , president of the Jim Henson Foundation , called him " essential " to the show . 
 Clash worked on the first film version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , which was dedicated to Henson , in 1990 , voicing Master Splinter . He performed in several productions with Jim Henson Productions , including as the Muppet Clifford in The Jim Henson Hour ( 1989 ) , and performing the puppetry for Frank Oz 's characters ( Miss Piggy , Fozzie Bear , Sam the Eagle , and Animal ) in Muppet Treasure Island ( 1996 ) . Clash performed in the films Muppets from Space ( 1999 ) and The Muppets ' Wizard of Oz ( 2005 ) , and the TV series Muppets Tonight ( 1996 — 1998 ) , in which he reprised Clifford , who served as the show 's host . He performed characters and worked behind the scenes on the sitcom Dinosaurs . In 1999 , Clash worked on a film starring Elmo , The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland . 
 In 2006 , Clash published his autobiography , co @-@ written by Gary <unk> and Louis Henry Mitchell , entitled My Life as a Furry Red Monster : What Being Elmo Has Taught Me About Life , Love and Laughing Out Loud . His life was featured in the 2011 documentary Being Elmo : A Puppeteer 's Journey . 
 = = = Resignation from Sesame Workshop = = = 
 In November 2012 , 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sheldon Stephens alleged that he had been in a sexual relationship with Clash which began when Stephens was 16 . Sesame Workshop had initially been presented with the allegation in June , and its investigation found the allegation to be unsubstantiated . Clash acknowledged that he had been in a relationship with the accuser ; however , he characterized the relationship as being between consenting adults . Stephens later recanted his accusation , but two weeks later , another accuser , Cecil Singleton , made similar accusations and lawsuits were filed by attorney Jeffrey Herman against Clash . 
 Clash resigned from Sesame Workshop on November 20 , 2012 , and released a statement saying , " Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work ' Sesame Street ' is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer . I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately . " Sesame Workshop also released a statement : " Unfortunately , the controversy surrounding Kevin 's personal life has become a distraction that none of us want , and he has concluded that he can no longer be effective in his job and has resigned from ' Sesame Street . ' " They stated that other puppeteers had been trained to serve as Clash 's understudy and would take over his roles on the show . 
 In July 2013 , the three cases against Clash were dismissed because the claims were made more than six years after each man reasonably should have become aware of Clash 's alleged violations during the three years after each turned 21 . Clash 's lawyers expressed his hope that the ruling would allow him to restore his personal and professional life . Lawyers for the plaintiffs appealed the ruling , alleging that the psychological effects of the abuse weren 't fully realized until 2012 . In April 2014 , the decision to dismiss the three lawsuits was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals . Months after the other alleged victims made legal accusations , Stephens filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania against Clash , but the case ultimately was dismissed in June 2014 because the statute of limitations had ended . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Clash was married for 17 years , and has a daughter who was born in 1993 . 
 In November 2012 , Clash came out publicly as gay in response to the allegations that led to his resignation from the Sesame Workshop , stating , " I am a gay man . I have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it , but felt it was a personal and private matter . " 
 Clash is African American and has stated that although children ignore him and speak directly to Elmo , African @-@ American adults tend to be surprised when they meet him . He has stated in interviews that his racial identity was pertinent to his work , and that it came through in his performances . 
 = = Awards and honors = = 
 Clash won Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Performer in a Children 's Series for his work as Elmo on Sesame Street in 1990 , 2005 – 2007 and 2009 – 2013 . In all , he has won 27 daytime Emmys and one prime @-@ time Emmy . 
 He was the first recipient of the ' Miss Jean ' <unk> Award for Service to Families and Children given by Maryland Public Television on June 9 , 2007 . 
 On May 19 , 2012 , Clash was presented with an honorary degree from Washington & Jefferson College . 
 = Sutton Wick air crash = 
 The Sutton Wick air crash occurred on 5 March 1957 when a Blackburn Beverley C Mk 1 heavy transport aircraft , serial number <unk> , of 53 Squadron Royal Air Force crashed at Sutton Wick , Drayton , Berkshire , England , following shut @-@ down of one engine and partial loss of power on another . After take @-@ off , No. 1 engine was shut down as a precautionary measure and whilst on final approach back to RAF Abingdon , No. 2 engine failed to respond to throttle inputs . The aeroplane struck cables and trees 18 minutes after lifting off . 
 Of 17 passengers and five crew aboard , all but four were killed in the accident . Two people on the ground were also killed . 
 An investigation found that a non @-@ return valve in the fuel system had been installed backwards , causing two of the engines to be starved of fuel . The technician found responsible for fitting the valve was charged under the Air Force Act . Following the accident , the non @-@ return valve was re @-@ designed so it could not be installed incorrectly . 
 Two RAF officers who took part in the rescue after the crash were highly praised for " refusing to give up while there was hope of finding survivors among the wreckage . " 
 = = Flight history = = 
 The Secretary of State for Air , George Ward , described the crash to the House of Commons . The Beverley took off from RAF Abingdon near Abingdon @-@ on @-@ Thames bound for RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus . It was carrying cargo , a relief crew , eight RAF police dog handlers and eight police dogs . There was low cloud at 500 feet ( 150 m ) , visibility was less than 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) , and there was an easterly wind of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ) . 
 As the aircraft climbed , No. 1 engine on the port wing developed a fuel leak . The flight crew responded by shutting down the engine and feathering its propeller . The flight crew declared an emergency and requested a blind approach to RAF Abingdon . The controller alerted emergency services on the ground . A short time later , cockpit instruments alerted the flight crew to a large loss of fuel from No. 2 fuel tank , the second of four such tanks in the port wing . In an effort to stop the leak , the crew de @-@ activated the fuel cocks and boosters for the No. 2 tank , but left them on for the No. 1 tank . As the Beverley turned on to final approach for RAF Abingdon the crew attempted to increase power from the remaining three Bristol Centaurus engines but No. 2 engine – also on the port wing – failed to respond and the aeroplane began to lose speed and height . 
 Knowing he could not reach the airfield , the captain tried to land in a field . However , the aircraft became uncontrollable and struck a number of high tension cables and a group of elm trees that tore the port wing from the fuselage . On impact with the ground , the aircraft destroyed a caravan and a prefabricated house before somersaulting and crashing upside down . John Dawson was in the garden of the Red Lion at Drayton and described what he witnessed : 
 The plane came towards me flying low when one wing hit a tree . It dived to the ground immediately , crashed through an ordinary brick house and a pre @-@ fab , slid along the ground for about 100 yards and burst into flames . The flames were terrific . It was so hot we could not get near to help those inside , but four of the occupants of the plane were thrown clear ... If the plane 's wing had not hit the tree it would have cleared the buildings and could have landed in the <unk> even if it could not have reached the airfield . 
 The aircraft crashed at 11 : 00 am , 18 minutes after take @-@ off , near Sutton Wick , 2 miles ( 3 km ) south of Abingdon . 50 @-@ year @-@ old Muriel Binnington lived in the prefabricated house . Eyewitness Eric Webb said it was " swept away " , and she must have been killed at once . 19 @-@ year @-@ old Mr J Maltravers from the Southern <unk> Board was in one of the houses to read the electricity meter , and was also killed . The tail section of the aircraft crashed on a farmhouse near the main wreckage , trapping and seriously injuring a Margaret Stanton in the kitchen of the house . She was later freed by emergency workers . 
 The plane was carrying a large amount of fuel for its flight to Cyprus and instantly caught fire . A newspaper reported : " Wreckage was scattered over three quarters of a mile . The force of the explosion sent the main part of the giant plane 's fuselage and tailplane tearing back over the field into the farmyard , carrying with it an inferno of blazing petrol and debris . " Emergency workers worked for several hours to free survivors and bodies from the charred fuselage . Two civilians in a prefabricated building on the ground , three crew , 15 passengers , and a number of RAF Police dogs were killed in the initial impact and ensuing fire . Two crew , two passengers and one RAF Police dog survived . 
 = = Rescue = = 
 Local farmworkers were first on scene . Eric Webb was stacking hay . When he realised that the aircraft was about to crash he ran to help . He was joined by P Richards , who had been working on a tractor in a farmyard less than 100 yards from the crash site . Webb and Richards helped to rescue two survivors from the wreckage . Webb said " We could hear the pilot shouting for help " . He and Richards climbed into the burning wreckage and rescued the pilot , who warned them that there were police dogs in cages in the plane that might be dangerous if they were loose , as their handlers were in the rear of the plane . The pilot asked Webb and Richards to help the 10 men in the tail of the aircraft . But , as Richards told a local newspaper " this was just a mass of flames and we could not get near it " . 
 Richards found one dog alive in its cage and released it . Webb found another suffering from burns and hiding behind a farmyard . An RSPCA inspector later arrived and took the injured dog to a vet in Abingdon . One badly injured dog was put down . Six dogs were later found dead in the wreckage . 
 Fire engines from RAF Abingdon and the Berkshire Fire Brigade station at Didcot fought the blaze . 
 Eight fire engines raced to the scene and firemen sprayed foam on to the wreckage . As soon as it was cool enough the firemen , assisted by policemen and RAF men from Abingdon , began the search . Within half an hour they had recovered 20 bodies . 
 Ambulances took four injured survivors of the crash to the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford . They were RAF men Leonard Andrews , Victor <unk> and Henry Ludlow from the aircraft , and civilian Margaret Stanton who had been trapped in her house . Another man was rescued alive but died on the way to hospital . The Oxford City Police force deployed eight officers to clear traffic to help ambulances to reach the Infirmary . Later that day the Infirmary described the three men as " dangerously ill " . 
 RAF Abingdon 's chaplain , Rev. Stanley Harrison , and medical officer , Flying Officer Charles Evans , joined the rescue . An hour and a half after the crash they rescued the surviving RAF Police dog . They continued rescue work for three hours and removed 14 bodies from the wreckage . An RAF document states : " At one stage a Calor gas cylinder bottle exploded near these officers and the fire thereupon began to gain ground . Undeterred by this , they continued their search of the wreckage until it was clear that there could be no survivors . " 
 = = Investigation = = 
 A Board of Inquiry investigated the crash and found it was caused by loss of power from Nos. 1 and 2 engines , both mounted on the port wing . George Ward told the House of Commons that " the four fuel tanks on the port side of the Beverley feed into a collector box from which the two port engines are fed . From the available evidence , including inspections of part of the aircraft 's fuel system , it is clear that a non @-@ return valve between No. 1 ( port ) tank and the collector box had been fitted in reverse and that the fuel supply from Nos. 3 and 4 ( port ) tanks were switched off throughout the flight . " Ward continued , saying that the loss of power from No. 1 was caused by it being shut down as a precautionary measure , and the fuel starvation to No. 2 engine was caused by an incorrectly fitted non @-@ return valve in the supply line from No. 1 fuel tank . No. 2 fuel tank had been isolated and two smaller fuel tanks in the port wing had not been selected during the flight . 
 The tradesman who had fitted the valve , and his supervisor , were prosecuted and charged , and the technician was court @-@ martialled for negligence and punished with a reprimand . The Board also noted that some fuel was available from two smaller tanks but they were not used during the flight , and that the captain " must bear some responsibility " for not using those tanks . Ward said , however , that " owing to the nature of the flight the amount of fuel in the two smaller tanks was not large , and it can only be assumed that the captain had no reason to believe that both port engines would not operate satisfactorily off the two main port tanks individually . " The captain was killed in the accident and no charges were brought against him or any of his crew . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 In response to the disaster at Sutton Wick , the non @-@ return valve was redesigned to make such an error impossible . Aviation author Graham Perry wrote that , after the crash , " airworthiness design standards were changed so that the threads at either end of all such valves manufactured since are now made totally different from each other . Items like a non @-@ return valve simply cannot now be assembled in the wrong sense . " Nevertheless , Perry wrote , " [ one ] would be amazed how many people have still tried to do so in the forty @-@ seven years since , most realising their mistake after looking in the manual and quietly and ruefully thanking those who had gone before them and made it impossible . " 
 = = = Awards = = = 
 For their parts in the rescue Rev. Harrison was made an OBE , Flying Officer Evans was made an MBE and Eric Webb was awarded the BEM and an <unk> medal for heroism . The RAF praised Harrison and Evans for " courage and resourcefulness of a high order , refusing to give up while there was hope of finding survivors among the wreckage . " 
 The Board of Inquiry also praised a Mrs Smith of Abingdon . Investigators praised the efforts of the Berkshire Constabulary .

 On 7 March 2015 The Veterans Charity unveiled a temporary monument at the crash site on the Green in Sutton Wick Lane . A Veterans Charity researcher working on a display of the crash , to be placed in Blackburn Beverley at Fort Paull , visited the site a few weeks before the anniversary and noted a lack of a local memorial at the site . So through the Charity , a memorial was rapidly ordered and efforts to locate survivors and families of those involved were made . Invitations were sent to local branches of the Royal British Legion , RAF Association , RAF Police Association , RAF Police , Thames Valley Police <unk> and the Air Training Corps . Despite very short notice about 100 people attended , including two RAF Police NCOs from RAF Benson . 
 Also representing the RAF Police and its dogs were Flight Sergeant Will Barrow and Air Dog Buster . A bugler from a Territorial Army unit in Kent played the Last Post . Buster and other dogs present joined in the Last Post . Buster has attended several memorial events before , but never before had he barked or howled at one . 
 At 1045 hrs a short service began unveiling the plaque , verses were read and the names of those killed and injured were read out . <unk> were laid on behalf of The Veterans Charity and the 1st Iver Heath Scouts who had helped with the research as their leader is a former RAF Police dog handler . After the event a local resident and former RAF member offered to create a more permanent memorial featuring the names of those lost and details of the incident . 
 On 5 March 2016 an oak pyramid inscribed with the names of the dead was installed at Sutton Wick a permanent monument . It was carved by Sutton Wick resident Brian <unk> , who served in the RAF 1952 – 54 . 
 Plans are being made for 2017 , which will be the 60th anniversary of the crash . To this end a not for profit group called The Memorial ' Mob ' is working with Drayton Parish Council and the South West Branch of the Royal Air Force Police Association ( <unk> ) . 
 = Hurricane Joanne ( 1972 ) = 
 Hurricane Joanne was one of four tropical cyclones to bring gale @-@ force winds to the Southwestern United States in the 20th century . A tropical depression developed on September 30 , 1972 . It then moved west northwest and intensified into a hurricane on October 1 . Hurricane Joanne peaked as a Category 2 hurricane , as measured by the modern Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane wind scale ( SSHWS ) , October 2 . Joanne then slowed down and began to re @-@ curve . Joanne made landfall along the northern portion of the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm . The tropical storm moved inland over Sonora on October 6 and was believed to have survived into Arizona as a tropical storm . In Arizona , many roads were closed and some water rescues had to be performed due to a prolonged period of heavy rains . One person was reportedly killed while another was electrocuted . A few weeks after the hurricane , Arizona would sustain additional flooding and eight additional deaths .

 On September 26 , ship reports and satellite imagery indicated an area of squally weather about 300 miles ( 485 km ) south of Guatemala . During September 27 and September 28 , the disturbance moved westward . On September 29 , the disturbance developed a closed low @-@ level atmospheric circulation . The following day , the system was designated as a tropical storm after a ship reported winds of 45 mph ( 70 km / h ) . A Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigated the growing storm on October 1 and estimated maximum sustained winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) , making Joanne a Category 1 hurricane . However , very few ships reported winds greater than 30 mph ( 50 km / h ) at that time . On October 2 , the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Database , noted that the hurricane had intensified into a Category 2 system , with winds peaking at 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) while turning towards the northwest . 
 On October 4 , Joanne began to recurve , and developed winds of 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) . Later that day , the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center ( EPHC ) downgraded Joanne into a tropical storm as the system weakened . Accelerating north and later northeast , Joanne made landfall near Laguna Chapala on Baja California while a tropical storm late on October 5 . Although records from the EPHC suggest that the tropical storm moved inland over Sonora on October 6 , it is likely that Joanne moved northeast into western Pima County as a minimal tropical storm . Tropical Storm Joanne weakened to a depression near Ajo , but made it all the way to Flagstaff before finally dissipating . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The initial disturbance to Joanne brought squally weather to Guatemala . Upon making landfall in Mexico , the highest rainfall total was 9 @.@ 45 in ( 240 mm ) in San Felipe / Mexicali . Puerto <unk> recorded winds of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . Further north , Joanne caused heavy surf in California , and brought tropical storm @-@ force winds to the state . 
 Prior to landfall , flash flood watches were issued for the southern portion of the state . Heavy rainfall was reported throughout Arizona . Over 5 inches ( 100 mm ) was measured at the Mogollon Rim . Many areas of the state received between 1 to 3 inches ( 25 to 76 mm ) of rainfall , with isolated locations receiving over 5 inches ( 130 mm ) . In Phoenix , <unk> in ( 20 mm ) of rain fell in a four @-@ hour period , compared to the October average of <unk> in ( 12 mm ) . The Nogales Highway Bridge over the Santa Cruz River was washed away by the flooding . Some secondary roads near Tucson were flooded . Numerous water rescues were conducted in central Tucson since several major streets turned into rivers . Severe flooding was recorded in Clifton , Duncan , and Safford . An official in Maricopa County lost track on the exact number of roads that were closed because of the hurricane . Many neighborhoods in northern Phoenix were evacuated early on October 7 when a canal overflowed its banks due to prolonged rainfall . Downtown , a young man was electrocuted when he tried to remove a downed power line that was on his car . One person was also killed in the city . Following the storm , heavy rain from Joanne set the stage for additional flooding in mid @-@ to late October from a Gulf of Alaska extratropical cyclone that brought more moisture to the area , causing $ 10 million ( 1972 USD ) in property damage and eight deaths . Further west in New Mexico , the hurricane produced 2 @.@ 48 in ( 63 mm ) of precipitation . 
 Hurricane Joanne is one of only four known Pacific hurricanes to bring gale @-@ force winds to the Continental United States , and was the first since the 1939 California tropical storm . According to the National Weather Service , it was the first time in recorded history that a tropical cyclone had brought gale force winds to Arizona . 
 = HD 217107 c = 
 HD 217107 c is an extrasolar planet approximately 64 light @-@ years away from Earth in the constellation of Pisces ( the Fish ) . The planet was the second planet to be discovered orbiting the star HD 217107 . HD 217107 c 's existence was hypothesized in 1998 due to the eccentricity of the inner planet 's orbit and confirmed in 2005 when radial velocity studies of the star indicated another , more distant and massive companion orbiting the star . The planet has an eccentric orbit lasting on order of a decade . 
 = = Detection and discovery = = 
 A study of the radial velocity of HD 217107 carried out in 1998 revealed that its motion along the line of sight varied over a 7 @.@ 1 day cycle , indicating the presence of a planet in orbit around the star . The planet was designated HD 217107 b , and was found to be somewhat heavier than Jupiter , and orbiting extremely close to the parent star in an orbit with quite a large eccentricity . 
 Most planets with orbital periods of less than 10 days have almost circular orbits , and its discoverers proposed that the high eccentricity of HD 217107 b 's orbit could be due to the gravitational influence of a second planet in the system at a distance of several astronomical units ( AU ) . Confirmation of the existence of the second planet followed in 2005 , and it was designated HD 217107 c . 
 The parameters of this planet was initially very weakly constrained , with a period in excess of 8 years with a high eccentricity and a minimum mass of approximately two times the mass of Jupiter . Continued observations restrained the plausible solutions substantially , resulting in the current parameters published in 2008 . 
 = Hooray Henry = 
 In British English slang , Hooray Henry or Hoorah Henry ( plural : Hoorah / Hooray Henrys / Henries ) is a pejorative term , comparable to " <unk> " , for an upper class British male who exudes loud @-@ mouthed arrogance and an air of superiority , often flaunting his public school upbringing . It is cited as the male equivalent of a " Sloane Ranger " , although the female equivalent of a Hooray Henry is sometimes referred to as a Hooray Henrietta . 
 Coined as " Hoorah Henry " in 1936 by American author Damon Runyon in his short story " Tight Shoes " , it became a common term in the UK in the 1950s when it was originally used to refer to the boisterous upper class fans of jazz trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton who would shout " Hoorah ! " between the pieces he performed at the 100 Club in London . More recently , the term has become commonly used in the British tabloid newspapers to express contempt towards the lifestyles of the upper class and their privileged upbringings in expensive public schools such as Eton College , and esteemed universities such as Oxford and Cambridge . Although with the demise of the old boy network other schools such as Sherborne School are more commonly associated with them . In both the United Kingdom and the United States , the term has frequently been used in a political context to refer to certain members of the British Conservative Party and Prime Minister David Cameron who had such upbringings , and has also been used negatively towards those associated with events such as the University Boat Race and Royal Ascot . Despite its generally negative connotation , several restaurants , clubs and boutiques have adopted the name in a more favourable light to imply class and style . 
 = = Definitions = = 
 Eric Partridge describes a Hooray Henry as a " male of the upper classes who exhibits a superior or anti @-@ social manner " . The Cambridge Dictionary defines it as a " young man from a high social class who speaks loudly and behaves in a noticeable way in public . " In the Cassell Dictionary of Slang ( 1998 ) , Jeff Grant defines a Hooray Henry as a " rich young man given to much public exhibitionism , drunkenness and similar antisocial activities , all based on an excess of snobbish self @-@ esteem . " Chambers Dictionary simply defines the term as " a young middle - or upper class man with a loud voice and ineffectual manner " . 
 The term has a similar meaning to " <unk> " and " rugger bugger " and is seen as the male equivalent of " Sloane Ranger " . It is usually applied to a snobbish , arrogant aristocratic male with a privileged public school and university ( Oxford or Cambridge ) background , or simply a well @-@ spoken , well @-@ educated , wealthy , pompous male who stands out among lower classes . Writing in New Zealand 's The Northern Standard in 2007 , Tim Eves indicates that the term in New Zealand is related to urban contempt of rural folk , explaining that " the latest fad among city folk is to discuss their rural friends with a mix of envy and downright resentment " . 
 = = Origins = = 
 The term was originally coined as " Hoorah Henry " in 1936 by American author Damon Runyon in his short story " Tight Shoes " . Runyon used it when describing his character Calvin Colby , a rich <unk> , saying , " He is without strict doubt a Hoorah Henry , and he is generally figured as nothing but a lob as far as doing anything useful in this world is concerned " . Albert Jack challenges the idea that Runyon made the term popular , crediting Jim Godbolt with the correct explanation of its popularity . Godbolt remembers that in 1951 it was used to refer to the fans of Old Etonian jazz trumpeter Humphrey Lyttelton who would turn up in droves to the 100 Club in Oxford Street , London and shout in loud , upper class voices between songs , " Hooray ! , Hooray ! " . Lyttelton himself has commented on the term but credits Runyon with coining it ; he once stated in an interview , " In jazz circles , aggressively " upper class " characters are known as <unk> , an adaption , I believe , of Damon Runyon 's " Hooray Henries " . For the English language specialist David Crystal , the term is usually given to the " loud @-@ mouthed ineffectual upper class twit " . He explains that it began appearing in British literature in the 1950s , although the Americans then " seemed to lose track of the term " . As a result , it was often included in British English guides in order to assist Americans . By the 1960s , the term was likened to Sloane Rangers , a term later applied to women such as Lady Diana Spencer before she married Prince Charles .

 The term is frequently used in tabloid newspapers and people continue to use " Hooray Henry " to refer to somebody of the upper class even outside the UK , although it is most commonly used in British English slang . British tabloids and American newspapers such as The Huffington Post of New York City often use the term " <unk> " or " Hooray Henry " to describe the elite of the British Conservative Party ; a 2012 article for instance referred to British Prime Minister David Cameron and the Tories as " Cameron and the Hooray Henry brigade " . Lindsay Johns of the Daily Mail cited the Bullingdon Club , a socially exclusive student dining club at Oxford University of which Cameron , George Osborne and Boris Johnson were former members , as a place for such people . She observed the " jarring Hooray Henry lexicon ( e.g. ' getting <unk> ' for drunk ) , the verbal jousting between fragile egos eager for one @-@ upmanship within the club ’ s rigid hierarchy , the endemic casual racism and the overwhelming sense of entitlement which are possessed by these obnoxious <unk> " in Laura Wade 's 2010 play Posh , which depicted the Bullingdon Club as the " Riot Club " . 
 Other institutions also have a reputation for having a " Hooray Henry " image . The participants and viewers of the University Boat Race are frequently referred to as Hooray Henries or toffs , even by non @-@ tabloid media like The Guardian who said that it is " easy to sneer at the kind of event where triumphant , red trouser @-@ wearing hooray @-@ <unk> greet their returning heroes with a rousing rendition of the timeless rowing shanty I 'd Rather Be a Leper Than a Cam " , and CNN who spoke of the " Barbour jacket @-@ wearing ' hooray @-@ henry ' crowd " , posing the question as to whether the boat race was a " prestigious battle , a vulgar display of elitism , or the ultimate meritocracy . " A 2005 Wales Online article reported on how the Countryside Alliance were acutely aware of their " Hooray Henry " image and that they were very keen to change their image and how they were perceived in Wales . The upper @-@ class people who turn up at horseracing events , particularly Royal Ascot , have also often been cited as Hoorah Henries . The journalist Robert <unk> spoke of the " Hooray Henry world of polo , <unk> balls and indolent ostentation at Ascot and Henley " in his 1987 book The Return of a Native Reporter . 
 In 2011 , the London Evening Standard mocked the debauchery by the Hooray Henries of Kings Road , Chelsea during the economic recession . Richard Godwin remarked : 
 " At a time when the economy teeters towards a double dip and their immediate peers are taking to the streets to rage against rising costs of education , a hopeless jobs market and dim prospects of affording a home , one set is partying like there 's no tomorrow . They 're not the ones who may actually have no tomorrow , though there is a distant worry that their privileged place in London society is under threat . Mostly , the Public kids - or the Jack Wills Generation , taking that ' outfitters to the gentry ' at its word - are above these concerns ... They are in their late teens and early twenties , fresh out of Eton , Charterhouse , Harrow and Stowe and revelling in the freedom from institution . Many of them are unemployed , or ' <unk> ' , as they like to call it . " 
 A 2012 Daily Mail article referred to the complaints that a " gang of Hooray Henrys from Prince William ’ s RAF base thundering overhead in their planes " had been getting in Anglesey . The cast of the series Made in Chelsea with their privileged upbringings and glamorous lifestyles , who inhabit some of London 's wealthiest areas including King 's Road , Belgravia and Knightsbridge , have also been referred to as Hooray Henries ; Glamour Magazine cites one of its stars as having a " wardrobe comprised entirely custom @-@ made suits " and " many luxury pads across the globe " .

 Though the term 's usage is generally limited to the UK , David Crystal notes that the term is in use in India , but is sometimes used in a less derogatory context to describe a man of class and style ; he states that a clothing line in Kolkata used the banner " Hoorah Henry " to promote a fashionable men 's clothing line . Restaurants , clubs , and boutiques have also embraced the term more favourably to indicate class , including Hooray Henry 's Restaurant and Hooray Henry 's Boutique in Great Yarmouth in England and Hooray Henry 's restaurant in West Hollywood , California in the US .

 = Interstate 215 ( Utah ) = 
 Interstate 215 ( I @-@ 215 ) , also known locally as the belt route or two @-@ fifteen , is an auxiliary interstate in the U.S. state of Utah that forms a 270 @-@ degree loop around Salt Lake City and many of its suburbs . The route begins at the mouth of Parley 's Canyon at the junction of I @-@ 80 and heads south through the edge of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area 's eastern suburbs of Millcreek , Holladay , and Cottonwood Heights . It continues west through Murray before turning north again , passing through the city 's first @-@ ring western suburbs of Taylorsville and West Valley City . It then enters North Salt Lake and Davis County for a short distance before reaching I @-@ 15 . 
 The interstate was proposed in the mid @-@ 1950s , along with I @-@ 15 and I @-@ 80 through Salt Lake City . At the time , only the western portion of the belt route was assigned as I @-@ 215 . The eastern portion of the belt route was designated Interstate 415 . However , the I @-@ 415 designation was scrapped to provide a single route number for the entire route in 1969 , with the I @-@ 215 designation covering the complete belt route . The freeway was constructed in segments , beginning with a section completed in 1963 from Redwood Road in North Salt Lake to 2100 North near the airport . Originally planned to be complete in the mid @-@ 1970s , challenges from citizens ' groups over environmental impact statements led to the completion of the last section of I @-@ 215 in 1989 between 6200 South and 4500 South in Holladay . 
 = = Route description = = 
 I @-@ 215 begins at an interchange at the mouth of Parley 's Canyon in Millcreek near the southeast corner of Salt Lake City that connects I @-@ 80 , Foothill Drive ( State Route 186 , or SR @-@ 186 ) and Parleys Way . At this point , I @-@ 215 splits into three legs , connecting I @-@ 80 toward Salt Lake City , Foothill Drive and Parleys Way , and I @-@ 80 through Parley 's Canyon . From here , the freeway travels southeast along the Salt Lake Valley 's east bench with three lanes in each direction . The route enters a residential area of East Millcreek and turns south . Then , the first exit appears , an incomplete diamond interchange with 3300 South ( SR @-@ 171 ) that lacks an off @-@ ramp from northbound I @-@ 215 . Past this interchange , an on @-@ ramp connects 3800 South to northbound I @-@ 215 . A block further south is a partial interchange lacking an off @-@ ramp from northbound I @-@ 215 onto 3900 South . Entering Holladay , I @-@ 215 is heading south but soon turns southwest . An off @-@ ramp here allows northbound motorists to connect to Wasatch Boulevard . However , this exit is signed as 3900 South and 3300 South because of the incomplete interchanges on both roads . Past an interchange at 4500 South ( SR @-@ 266 ) that serves southbound I @-@ 215 , the road turns south again and begins descending toward Knudsen 's Corner and Cottonwood Heights . At this point , the southbound lanes are lower than the parallel northbound lanes . The belt route flattens out upon reaching an interchange at 6200 South at Knudsen 's Corner . 
 As the freeway enters Cottonwood Heights , it turns west and becomes a sunken freeway . Then it reaches an interchange at Highland Drive , signed as 2000 East ( SR @-@ 152 ) . This interchange features a grade @-@ separated ramp from northbound 2000 East to eastbound I @-@ 215 . Past this junction , another interchange at Union Park Avenue appears . Another grade @-@ separated ramp from Union Park Avenue is present . The freeway enters Murray as an interchange serving westbound motorists connects to 280 East and State Street ( U.S. Route 89 , or US @-@ 89 ) . Eastbound travelers connect to State Street further west at a separate exit . The road turns northwest for a short time to approach a junction at I @-@ 15 ( often called the South Interchange , in ) . Approaching the interchange , the route gains two lanes and reverts to a ground @-@ level freeway . The freeway crosses I @-@ 15 and loses one lane as it enters Taylorsville and curves to the northwest , crossing the Jordan River in the process . Right before a partial cloverleaf interchange at Redwood Road ( SR @-@ 68 ) the route turns west one final time before turning north after the interchange . The freeway continues north and has another partial cloverleaf interchange at 4700 South ( SR @-@ 266 ) . The route enters West Valley City and encounters 3500 South ( SR @-@ 171 ) , where its eastbound lanes have a grade @-@ separated ramp to northbound I @-@ 215 . The road turns northeast and enters an industrial area of western Salt Lake City . After reaching a cloverleaf interchange at SR @-@ 201 , the route turns north again . Beyond a single @-@ point urban interchange at California Avenue , the freeway continues north . 
 A partial stack interchange involving I @-@ 80 , Redwood Road , and the access road to Salt Lake City International Airport is next . The freeway loses one lane in each direction as the interstate passes the airport to the east . Two diamond interchanges at 700 North and 2100 North occur as the freeway approaches Davis County . Past 2100 North , the freeway enters rural Salt Lake County , and the road curves to the northwest . An interchange at Legacy Parkway gives northbound I @-@ 215 motorists and southbound Legacy Parkway motorists their respective connections . The road turns east and loses one lane in each direction . There is a diamond interchange at SR @-@ 68 before the highway merges into northbound I @-@ 15 in North Salt Lake . 
 = = History = = 
 A belt route around Salt Lake City was first proposed in 1955 , with the Utah Highway Department ( the predecessor to the present @-@ day Utah Department of Transportation ) holding hearings concerning construction beginning in early 1958 . The southeast quadrant of the route was originally placed from a junction at proposed I @-@ 15 in Murray northeasterly through Murray and Holladay , eventually reaching the east bench at 3900 South . From there , it would have run north toward the mouth of Parley 's Canyon at proposed I @-@ 80 ( at the time US @-@ 40 ) . Almost immediately , this plan was met with opposition among local residents in the area . The proposed route would have bisected the primarily residential Holladay suburb , as well as the southern portion of Murray . After more than two years of hearings and widespread opposition from residents , the Highway Department released their proposed routing in June 1960 , which placed the southeast quadrant where it runs today . While quelling criticism from some , others remained in opposition , saying the route was still too intrusive along residential areas . The western quadrant was also admonished for being placed to close to other major arterials . In November 1963 , a small , two @-@ lane portion of the northwest quadrant of the belt route opened from Redwood Road ( SR @-@ 68 ) in Davis County west and south to 2100 North , north of the Salt Lake City International Airport . This portion of road was extended east to I @-@ 15 in North Salt Lake and upgraded to freeway standards by 1969 . 
 Construction of the southeast quadrant from I @-@ 80 ( at the time replacing US @-@ 40 ) at Parley 's Canyon to 4600 South in Holladay began in mid @-@ 1965 . This involved realigning Wasatch Boulevard to parallel the route and truncating that road at 3300 South . Prior to this , Wasatch Boulevard connected to US @-@ 40 . The section from I @-@ 80 to 3300 South opened by January 1967 , with the portion of roadway from 3300 South to 4500 South opening in November 1969 . 
 By 1973 , construction was progressing on the western quadrant between I @-@ 15 in Murray and SR @-@ 201 ( at the time US @-@ 40A / US @-@ 50A ) . Land acquisition was also taking place for the rest of the southeastern quadrant between 300 East in Murray and 4600 South in Holladay . However , a citizens ' group named Cottonwood Inc. halted right @-@ of @-@ way acquirements due to the lack of an environmental impact statement ( EIS ) . Also controversial was a proposed cloverleaf interchange at 2000 East . By mid @-@ 1975 , an EIS was released with four main alternatives : a no @-@ build alternative which would leave a gap in the southeast quadrant , building the road along the modern @-@ day path ( at about 6400 South ) , moving the southern portion southwest through Fort Union and Midvale to 7200 South , or extending the eastern portion further south to Sandy and then west along 9000 South . Cottonwood Inc. filed a lawsuit challenging the EIS . Meanwhile , I @-@ 215 from SR @-@ 201 in the western quadrant to 280 East in Murray opened in November 1976 . 
 After 1976 , gaps in the belt route were present from 2100 North near the airport to SR @-@ 201 and from State Street in Murray to 4600 South in Holladay . The first step in completing the gap was taken in June 1979 , when construction of the interstate from State Street to 700 East began . This was followed by the Cottonwood Inc. lawsuit being awarded in favor of UDOT in November 1979 . In July 1985 , the route from 280 East to Union Park Avenue was completed . At the time , this portion of road was the most expensive in the state in terms of cost per mile , due to the road being depressed below surrounding neighborhoods . The next section to open was from 2100 North south to I @-@ 80 in 1987 . This was followed by a section between Union Park Avenue and 2000 East , opened in November 1987 , which was also built as a sunken freeway . The western quadrant of the freeway was completed in October 1988 , closing the gap between SR @-@ 201 and I @-@ 80 ( however , the California Avenue interchange wasn 't opened until mid @-@ 1989 ) . In August 1989 , the road from 2000 East to 6200 South was finished , and the belt route was completed with the opening of freeway between 4500 South and 6200 South in October 1989 . 
 Since 1989 , the only major modifications that have occurred on the belt route have consisted of the rebuilding of the southern I @-@ 15 interchange in 2001 , widening from six to eight lanes from 4700 South in Taylorsville to I @-@ 15 in Murray in 2004 , and the addition of an interchange at Legacy Parkway in 2008 . The 3300 South and 4500 South overpasses were rebuilt as well , in 2008 and 2007 respectively . 
 As part of the original proposal of a belt route through Salt Lake City , the southeastern quadrant received the designation of I @-@ 415 . To maintain continuity in the belt route , the 415 number was replaced in favor of the I @-@ 215 designation covering the entire route in 1969 .

 = The Battle of Alexander at Issus = 
 The Battle of Alexander at Issus ( German : <unk> ) is a 1529 oil painting by the German artist Albrecht Altdorfer ( c . 1480 – 1538 ) , a pioneer of landscape art and a founding member of the Danube school . It portrays the 333 BC Battle of Issus , in which Alexander the Great secured a decisive victory over Darius III of Persia and gained crucial leverage in his campaign against the Persian Empire . The painting is widely regarded as Altdorfer 's masterpiece , and is one of the most famous examples of the type of Renaissance landscape painting known as the world landscape , which here reaches an unprecedented grandeur . 
 Duke William IV of Bavaria commissioned The Battle of Alexander at Issus in 1528 as part of a set of historical pieces that was to hang in his Munich residence . Modern commentators suggest that the painting , through its abundant use of anachronism , was intended to liken Alexander 's heroic victory at Issus to the contemporary European conflict with the Ottoman Empire . In particular , the defeat of Suleiman the Magnificent at the Siege of Vienna may have been an inspiration for Altdorfer . A religious undercurrent is detectable , especially in the extraordinary sky ; this was probably inspired by the prophecies of Daniel and contemporary concern within the Church about an impending apocalypse . The Battle of Alexander at Issus and four others that were part of William 's initial set are in the Alte Pinakothek art museum in Munich . 
 = = Subject matter = = 
 Alexander III of Macedon ( 356 – 323 BC ) , best known as Alexander the Great , was an Ancient Greek king of Macedon who reigned from 336 BC until his death . He is widely regarded as one of the greatest military tacticians and strategists in history , and is presumed undefeated in battle . Renowned for his military leadership and charisma , he always led his armies personally and took to the front ranks of battle . By conquering the Persian Empire and unifying Greece , Egypt and Babylon , he forged the largest empire of the ancient world and effected the spread of Hellenism throughout Europe and Northern Africa . 
 Alexander embarked on his expedition to conquer the Persian Empire in the spring of 334 BC , having pacified the warring Greek states and consolidated his military might . During the first months of the Macedonian passage into Persian Asia Minor , Darius III – king of Persia – largely ignored the presence of Alexander 's 40 @,@ 000 men . The Battle of the Granicus , fought in May , was Persia 's first major effort to confront the invaders , but resulted in an easy victory for Alexander . Over the next year , Alexander took most of western and coastal Asia Minor by forcing the capitulation of the satrapies in his path . He continued inland , travelling northeast through <unk> before turning southeast toward Cilicia . After passing the Cilician Gates in October , Alexander was delayed by fever in Tarsus . Darius meanwhile mustered an army of up to 100 @,@ 000 ( some ancient sources posit exaggerated figures of over 600 @,@ 000 ) and personally directed it over the eastern slopes of the Amanus Mountains . In early November , as Alexander proceeded about the Gulf of Issus from <unk> via Issus , the two armies inadvertently passed one another on opposite sides of the mountains . This was decidedly to Darius ' advantage : now at the rear of Alexander , he was able to prevent retreat and block the supply lines Alexander had established at Issus . It was not until Alexander had encamped at <unk> , a seaport on the southeastern shores of the Gulf of İskenderun , that he learned of the Persian position . He immediately retraced his route to the <unk> River , just south of Issus , to find Darius ' force assembled along the northern bank . The Battle of Issus ensued . 
 Darius ' initial response was defensive : he immediately stockaded the river bank with stakes to impede the enemy 's crossing . A core vanguard of traitorous Greek mercenaries and Persian royal guard was established ; as was usual for Persian kings , Darius positioned himself in the centre of this vanguard , in order that he might effectively dispatch commands to any part of his large army . A group of Persian light infantry was soon sent to the foothills , as it was suspected that Alexander would make an approach from the right , away from the coast . A mass of cavalry commanded by Nabarsanes occupied the Persian right . 
 Alexander made a cautious and slow advance , intending to base his strategy on the structure of the Persian force . He led a flank of his Companion cavalry on the right , while the Thessalian cavalry were dispatched to the left , as a counter to Nabarsanes ' mounted unit . Aware of the importance of the foothills to his right , Alexander sent a band of light infantry , archers , and cavalry to displace the defence Darius had stationed there . The enterprise was successful – those Persians not killed were forced to seek refuge higher in the mountains . 
 When within missile range of the enemy , Alexander gave the order to charge . He spearheaded the assault of his heavily armed Companion cavalry , who quickly made deep cuts into the Persian left flank . The Macedonian left wing , commanded by Parmenion , was meanwhile driven back by Nabarsanes ' large cavalry . The Macedonians ' central phalanx crossed the river and clashed with the renegade Greek mercenaries who fronted Darius ' vanguard . As the Companion cavalry pushed further into the Persian left , the danger arose that Darius would exploit the gap that had formed between Alexander and the rest of his army . When he was satisfied that the left wing was crippled and no longer a threat , Alexander remedied the situation by moving the Companions to assault the Persian centre in the flank . Unable to handle the added pressure , the Persian vanguard was forced to withdraw from the river bank , allowing the Macedonian phalanx to continue their advance and lifting the pressure on Parmenion 's left wing . 
 Upon realising that the onslaught of Alexander 's Companion cavalry was unstoppable , Darius and his army fled . Many were killed in the rush , trampled by those who fled with them or collapsed with their horses . Some escaped to regions as remote as Egypt , and others reunited with Darius in the north . The onset of darkness ended the chase after approximately 20 km ( 12 mi ) ; Alexander then recalled his army and set about burying the dead . Darius ' family were left behind in the Persian camp ; it is reported that Alexander treated them well and reassured them of Darius ' safety . Darius ' royal chariot was found discarded in a ditch , as were his bow and shield . 
 Ancient sources present disparate casualty figures for the Battle of Issus . Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus approximate 100 @,@ 000 Persian deaths , in contrast with the 450 Macedonian deaths reported by Quintus Curtius Rufus . In any case , it is probable that more Persians were killed as they fled than in battle ; Ptolemy I , who served with Alexander during the battle , recounts how the Macedonians crossed a ravine on the bodies of their enemies during the pursuit . 
 The Macedonian conquest of Persia continued until 330 BC , when Darius was killed and Alexander took his title as king . Alexander died in 323 BC , having recently returned from campaigning in the Indian subcontinent . The cause of death remains a subject of debate .

 Albrecht Altdorfer is regarded as one of the founders of Western landscape art . He was a painter , etcher , architect , and engraver , and the leader of the Danube school of German art . As evidenced by such paintings as Saint George and the Dragon ( 1510 ) and Allegory ( 1531 ) , much of Altdorfer 's work is characterised by an attachment to sprawling landscapes that dwarf the figures within them ; The Battle of Alexander at Issus epitomises this facet of his style . With reference to St George and the Dragon in particular , art historian Mark W. Roskill comments that " The accessory material of landscape [ in Altdorfer 's work ] is played with and ornamentally elaborated so that it reverberates with the sense of a sequestered and inhospitable environment " . Inspired by his travels around the Austrian Alps and the Danube River , Altdorfer painted a number of landscapes that contain no figures at all , including Landscape with a Footbridge ( c . 1516 ) and Danube Landscape near Regensburg ( c . 1522 – 25 ) . These were the first " pure " landscapes since antiquity . Most of Altdorfer 's landscapes were made with a vertical format , in contrast with the modern conception of the genre . The horizontal landscape was an innovation of Altdorfer 's Flemish contemporary Joachim Patinir and his followers . 
 Altdorfer also produced a great deal of religious artwork , in reflection of his devout Catholicism . His most frequent subjects were the Virgin Mary and the life and crucifixion of Christ . As in The Battle of Alexander at Issus , these paintings often feature settings of great majesty and use the sky to convey symbolic meaning . This meaning is not uniform throughout Altdorfer 's corpus – for example , the visage of the setting sun connotes loss and tragedy in Agony in the Garden , but serves as " the emblem of power and glory " in The Battle of Alexander at Issus . 
 Larry Silver of The Art Bulletin explains that The Battle of Alexander at Issus is both similar to and in direct contrast with Altdorfer 's previous work : " Instead of the peaceful landscape of retreat for Christian events or holy figures , this panel offers just the opposite : a battleground for one of ancient history 's principal epoch @-@ making encounters ... Yet despite its global or cosmic dimensions , the Battle of Issus still looks like Altdorfer 's earlier , contemplative liminal landscapes of retreat , complete with craggy peaks , bodies of water , and distant castles . " 
 Although the Battle of Alexander is atypical of Altdorfer in its size and in that it depicts war , his Triumphal Procession – a 1512 – 16 illuminated manuscript commissioned by Maximilian I of the Holy Roman Empire – has been described as a conceptual antecedent . The Procession was produced in parallel with the Triumph of Maximilian , a series of 137 woodcuts collaboratively executed by Altdorfer , Hans <unk> , Albrecht Dürer , Leonhard Beck and Hans <unk> . 
 = = = Influences and commission = = = 
 Altdorfer 's most significant contemporary influence was Matthias Grünewald ( c . 1470 – 1528 ) . Art historian Horst W. Janson remarked that their paintings " show the same ' unruly ' imagination " . Elements of The Battle of Alexander at Issus – particularly the sky – have been compared to Grünewald 's Heavenly Host above the Virgin and Child , which forms part of his masterpiece , the <unk> Altarpiece . Lucas Cranach the Elder ( 1472 – 1553 ) , also associated with the Danube school , was another important influence for Altdorfer . According to Roskill , works by Cranach from about 1500 " give a prominent role to landscape settings , using them as mood @-@ enhancing backgrounds for portraits , and for images of hermits and visionary saints " , and seem to play a " preparatory role " for the onset of pure landscape . Altdorfer owed much of his style , particularly in his religious artwork , to Albrecht Dürer ( 1471 – 1528 ) ; Larry Silver writes that Altdorfer 's " use of convincing German landscapes in combination with celestial phenomena for his religious narrative " is " firmly tied " to a tradition " modeled by Albrecht Dürer .

 William IV , Duke of Bavaria commissioned The Battle of Alexander at Issus in 1528 . Altdorfer was approximately 50 at the time , and was living in the Free Imperial City of Regensburg . As a result of over a decade of involvement with the Regensburg city council , Altdorfer was offered the position of Burgomaster on 18 September 1528 . He declined ; the council annals reported his reasoning as such : " He much desires to execute a special work in Bavaria for my Serene Highness and gracious Lord , Duke [ William ] . " William probably wanted the painting for his newly built summer <unk> ( " pleasure house " ) in the grounds of his palace in Munich , approximately 60 miles ( 97 km ) south of Regensburg . There , it was to hang alongside seven other paintings with a similar format and subject matter , including Ludwig <unk> 's The <unk> of Marcus Curtius , Melchior <unk> 's The Siege of Alesia by Caesar , and the painting of Battle of Cannae by Hans Burgkmair ( 1473 – 1531 ) . Another eight , each portraying a famous woman from history , were later added to the set , probably at the behest of the Duke 's wife , <unk> of Baden . Altdorfer 's Susanna and the Elders ( 1526 ) was among these . 
 = = = Earlier depictions = = = 
 Earlier depictions of the Battle of Issus are few . Battle of Issus , a fresco by Philoxenus of Eretria , is probably the first such . It was painted sometime around 310 BC for Cassander ( c . 350 – 297 BC ) , who was one of Alexander the Great 's successors . Alexander and Darius – each within a lance 's length of the other – are pictured among a wild fray of mounted and downed soldiers . While Alexander maintains an aura of unshaken confidence , fear is etched in Darius ' face , and his charioteer has already turned to rein his horses and escape . Roman author and natural philosopher Pliny the Elder claimed that Philoxenus ' portrayal of the battle was " inferior to none " . Some modern critics posit that Battle of Issus might not have been the work of Philoxenus , but of Helena of Egypt . One of the few named women painters who might have worked in Ancient Greece , she was reputed to have produced a painting of the battle of Issus which hung in the Temple of Peace during the time of Vespasian . 
 The Alexander Mosaic , a floor mosaic dating from c . 100 BC , is believed to be a " reasonably faithful " copy of Battle of Issus , though an alternative view holds it might instead be a copy of a work painted by Apelles of Kos , who produced several portraits of Alexander the Great . It measures 5 @.@ 82 m × 3 @.@ 13 m ( 19 ft 1 in × 10 ft 3 in ) , and consists of approximately 1 @.@ 5 million tesserae ( coloured tiles ) , each about 3 mm ( 0 @.@ 12 in ) square . The mosaicist is unknown . Since the mosaic was not rediscovered until 1831 , during excavations of Pompeii 's House of the Faun , Altdorfer could never have seen it . It was later moved to the Naples National Archaeological Museum in Naples , Italy , where it currently resides .

 The Battle of Alexander at Issus is painted on a <unk> panel measuring 158 @.@ 4 cm × 120 @.@ 3 cm ( 62 @.@ 4 in × 47 @.@ 4 in ) , and portrays the moment of Alexander the Great 's victory . The vertical format was dictated by the space available in the room for which the painting was commissioned – each in William 's set of eight was made to be the same size . At an unknown date , the panel was cut down on all sides , particularly at the top , so the sky was originally larger and the moon further from the corner of the scene . The scene is approached from an impossible viewpoint – at first only feet from the fray , the perspective gradually ascends to encompass the seas and continents in the background and eventually the curvature of the Earth itself . 
 Thousands of horse and foot soldiers immersed in a sea of spears and lances populate the foreground . The two armies are distinguished by their dress , anachronistic though it is : whereas Alexander 's men clad themselves and their horses in full suits of heavy armour , many of Darius ' wear turbans and ride naked mounts . The bodies of the many fallen soldiers lie underfoot . A front of Macedonian warriors in the centre pushes against the crumbling enemy force , who flee the battlefield on the far left . The Persian king joins his army on his chariot of three horses , and is narrowly pursued by Alexander and his uniformly attired Companion cavalry . The tract of soldiers continues down the gently sloped battlefield to the campsite and cityscape by the water , gravitating toward the mountainous rise at the scene 's centre . 
 Beyond is the Mediterranean Sea and the island of Cyprus . Here , a transition in hue is made , from the browns that prevail in the lower half of the painting to the <unk> that saturate the upper half . The Nile River meanders in the far distance , emptying its seven arms into the Mediterranean at the Nile Delta . South of Cyprus is the Sinai Peninsula , which forms a land bridge between Africa and Southwest Asia . The Red Sea lies beyond , eventually merging – as the mountain ranges to its left and right do – with the curved horizon . 
 A fierce sky caught in the dichotomy between the setting sun and the crescent moon dominates more than a third of the painting . The rain @-@ heavy clouds swirling ominously around each celestial entity are separated by a gulf of calmness , intensifying the contrast and infusing the heavens with an unearthly glow . Light from the sky spills onto the landscape : while the western continent and the Nile are bathed in the sun 's light , the east and the Tower of Babel are cloaked in shadow . 
 The painting 's subject is explained in the tablet suspended from the heavens . The wording , probably supplied by William 's court historian Johannes Aventinus , was originally in German but was later replaced by a Latin inscription . It translates : 
 Alexander the Great defeating the last Darius , after 100 @,@ 000 infantry and more than 10 @,@ 000 cavalrymen had been killed amongst the ranks of the Persians . Whilst King Darius was able to flee with no more than 1 @,@ 000 horsemen , his mother , wife , and children were taken prisoner . 
 No date is provided for the battle alongside these casualty figures . The lower left @-@ hand corner features Altdorfer 's monogram – an ' A ' within an ' A ' – and the lower edge of the tablet is inscribed with " <unk> <unk> ZU <unk> FECIT " ( " Albrecht Altdorfer from Regensburg made [ this ] " ) . Tiny inscriptions on their chariot and harness identify Darius and Alexander , respectively . Each army bears a banner that reports both its total strength and its future casualties . 
 = = = Analysis and interpretation = = = 
 <unk> is a major component of The Battle of Alexander at Issus . By dressing Alexander 's men in 16th @-@ century steel armour and Darius ' men in Turkish battle dress , Altdorfer draws deliberate parallels between the Macedonian campaign and the contemporary European – Ottoman conflict . In 1529 – the year of the painting 's commissioning – the Ottoman forces under Suleiman the Magnificent laid siege to the Austrian city of Vienna . Then also the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and called ' the golden apple ' by the Sultans . Although far inferior in number , the Austrian , German , Czech , and Spanish soldiers marshalled to defend Vienna were able to force the enemy into a retreat and stall the Ottoman advance on central Europe . It is probable the painting 's underlying allegory was inspired by the siege of Vienna , given its similarities to Alexander 's victory at Issus . Some critics go further , suggesting that the inclusion of anachronism may have been an element of Altdorfer 's commission . 
 In his Futures Past : On the Semantics of Historical Time , historian Reinhart Koselleck discusses Altdorfer 's representation of time in a more philosophical light . After differentiating between the superficial anachronism found in the casualty figures on the army banners and the deeper anachronism ingrained in the painting 's contemporary context , he posits that the latter type is less a superimposition of one historical event over another and more an acknowledgement of the recursive nature of history . With reference to Koselleck , Kathleen Davis argues : " ... for [ Altdorfer ] , 4th @-@ century Persians look like 16th @-@ century Turks not because he does not know the difference , but because the difference does not matter ... The <unk> , in other words , exemplifies a premodern , <unk> sense of time and a lack of historical consciousness ... Altdorfer 's historical overlays evince an eschatological vision of history , evidence that the 16th century ( and by degrees also the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries ) remained locked in a static , constant temporality that <unk> saturates the future as always a repetition of the same ... In such a system there can be no event as such : anticipation and arrival are together sucked into the black hole of sacred history , which is not <unk> because its time is essentially undifferentiated ... " 
 Featured alongside the anachronism in The Battle of Alexander at Issus is a genuine lack of historicity . Altdorfer demonstrates minimal hesitance in neglecting the painting 's historical integrity for the sake of its heroic style , in spite of the pains he took to research the battle . That the Persian army was up to twice the size of the Macedonian army is not clear , and the relative positioning of the soldiers as reported by ancient sources has been disregarded . According to art critic Rose @-@ Marie Hagen , " The artist was faithful to the historical truth only when it suited him , when historical facts were compatible with the demands of his composition . " Hagen also notes the historically baseless inclusion of women on the battlefield , attributing it to Altdorfer 's " passion for invention " and saying they " look like German courtly ladies , dressed for a hunting party " in their feathered <unk> . 
 Altdorfer 's primary point of reference in his research was probably Hartmann Schedel 's Nuremberg Chronicle ( <unk> <unk> ) , an illustrated world history published in Nuremberg in 1493 . Schedel was a physician , humanist , historian and cartographer , and his Chronicle was one of the first books produced on the printing press . With a heavy reliance on the Bible , it recounts the seven ages of human history , from Creation to the birth of Christ and ending with the Apocalypse . Altdorfer 's statistics for the battle of Issus mirror those of Schedel . Furthermore , the errors in Schedel 's maps of the Mediterranean and Northern Africa are also present in The Battle of Alexander at Issus : the island of Cyprus is noticeably oversized , and both the mountain rise in the painting 's centre and the range adjacent to the Nile do not exist . Since the Chronicle describes Alexander 's victory over the Persians in terms of its proximity to Tarsus and omits mention of Issus , it is likely that the cityscape by the sea is intended to be the former city rather than the latter . Issus in the 16th century was minor and relatively unknown , whereas Tarsus was renowned for its having been a major centre of learning and philosophy in Roman times . Tarsus was also said to be the birthplace of the Apostle Paul , which may explain the presence of the church towers in Altdorfer 's portrayal . Another source may have been the writings of Quintus Curtius Rufus , a 1st @-@ century Roman historian who presents inflated figures for the number of killed and taken prisoner and the sizes of the armies . 
 The sky bears overt metaphorical significance and is the centrepiece of the painting 's symbolism . Alexander , identified by the Egyptians and others as a god of the sun , finds his victory in the sun 's rays ; and the Persians are routed into the darkness beneath the crescent moon , a symbol of the Near East . Considered in terms of the painting 's contemporary context , the sun 's triumph over the moon represents Christendom 's victory over the Islamism of the Ottomans . <unk> meaning , probably inspired by prophecies in the Book of Daniel , is imbued in the heavenly setting . In particular , Daniel 7 predicts the rise and fall of four kingdoms before the Second Coming ; these were thought to be Babylon , Persia , Greece , and Rome at the time of the painting 's creation . Altdorfer saw the Battle of Issus as a principal indicator of the transition of power from Persia to Greece , and thus as an event of cosmic significance . The battle also marked a progression toward the end of the world – an important theological concern in the 16th century , given that the last traces of Rome were diminishing with the papacy . As a member of the Regensburg council and a practising Catholic , Altdorfer frequently interacted with the Church and was surely aware of this trend of eschatological thought . Schedel , too , had calculated that the final age of the seven he identified was nigh . It may therefore be inferred that the sky 's expression of the momentous event at Issus was intended to be of contemporary relevance as well . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The Battle of Alexander at Issus remained part of the royal collection of the Dukes of Bavaria for centuries . By the late 18th century , it was regularly featured in public galleries at the <unk> Palace . The painting was one of 72 taken to Paris in 1800 by the invading armies of Napoleon I ( 1769 – 1821 ) , who was a noted admirer of Alexander the Great . The Louvre held it until 1804 , when Napoleon declared himself Emperor of France and took it for his own use . When the Prussians captured the Château de Saint @-@ Cloud in 1814 as part of the War of the Sixth Coalition , they supposedly found the painting hanging in Napoleon 's bathroom . 
 The Battle of Alexander at Issus and 26 others taken in the 1800 invasion were subsequently restored to the King of Bavaria in 1815 . Five of the paintings in William IV 's original set of eight – including The Battle of Alexander at Issus – later passed from the royal collection to the Alte Pinakothek art museum in Munich , Germany , where they remain ; the other three are in the National Museum of Fine Arts in Stockholm , having been looted by the Swedish army in the Thirty Years War of 1618 – 1648 . Susannah and the Elders is the only other work by Altdorfer in the Alte Pinakothek . 
 <unk> , the painting forms part of the Northern Renaissance , a resurgence of classical humanism and culture in northern Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries . The Renaissance induced a new kind of social individualism which Altdorfer expressed through the heroic emphasis on Alexander and Darius , and which is reflected in the specifics of the painting 's commission and by the subjects of its companion pieces : " During the Renaissance people no longer saw themselves solely as members of a social group , as the citizens of a town , or as sinners before God in whose eyes all were equal . They had become aware of the unique qualities that distinguished one person from another . Unlike the Middle Ages , the Renaissance celebrated the individual . Altdorfer may have painted row after row of apparently identical warriors , but the spectators themselves would identify with Alexander and Darius , figures who had names , whose significance was indicated by the cord which hung down from the tablet above them . " 
 Altdorfer was not only a pioneer of landscape , but also a practitioner of early incarnations of the Romanticism and expressionism which impacted the arts so greatly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . Kenneth Clark writes of Altdorfer and contemporaries Grünewald and Bosch , " They are what we now call ' expressionist ' artists , a term which is not as worthless as it sounds , because , in fact , the symbols of expressionism are remarkably consistent , and we find in the work of these early 16th @-@ century landscape painters not only the same spirit but the same shapes and iconographical motives which recur in the work of such recent expressionists as van Gogh , Max Ernst , Graham Sutherland and Walt Disney . " According to art critic Pia F. Cuneo , " Altdorfer 's construction of landscape on a cosmic scale " in the Battle of Alexander at Issus , and his " spiritual and aesthetic affinities with Romanticism and Modern art ( in particular , German Expressionism ) " , " have been especially singled out for praise " . 
 The Battle of Alexander at Issus is typically considered to be Altdorfer 's masterpiece . Cuneo states that the painting is usually " considered in splendid isolation from its fifteen other companion pieces , based on the assumption that it either metonymically stands in for the entire cycle , or that its perceived aesthetic predominance merits exclusive focus . " German writer Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel ( 1772 – 1829 ) was one of many who saw the painting in the Louvre and marvelled , calling it a " small painted Iliad " . Reinhart Koselleck comments that Altdorfer 's depiction of the thousands of soldiers was executed with " a mastery previously unknown " , and Kathleen Davis describes the painting as " epochal in every sense " .

 = Black drongo = 
 The black drongo ( Dicrurus macrocercus ) is a small Asian passerine bird of the drongo family Dicruridae . It is a common resident breeder in much of tropical southern Asia from southwest Iran through India and Sri Lanka east to southern China and Indonesia . It is a wholly black bird with a distinctive forked tail and measures 28 cm ( 11 in ) in length . Feeding on insects , it is common in open agricultural areas and light forest throughout its range , perching conspicuously on a bare perch or along power or telephone lines . The species is known for its aggressive behaviour towards much larger birds , such as crows , never hesitating to dive @-@ bomb any bird of prey that invades its territory . This behaviour earns it the informal name of king crow . Smaller birds often nest in the well @-@ guarded vicinity of a nesting black drongo . Previously considered a subspecies ( Dicrurus adsimilis macrocercus ) of the African fork @-@ tailed drongo ( Dicrurus adsimilis ) , it is now recognized as a full species . 
 The black drongo has been introduced to some Pacific islands , where it has thrived and become abundant to the point of threatening and causing the extinction of native and endemic bird species there . 
 = = Taxonomy and systematics = = 
 The black drongo was once considered a subspecies of the fork @-@ tailed drongo ( Dicrurus adsimilis ) , a close relative that diverged relatively recently . The two are now considered distinct species , with the fork @-@ tailed drongo restricted to Africa and separated from the Asian range of the black drongo . 
 Seven subspecies have been named but the largely contiguous populations show clinal variation and intergrade with each other . Individuals from northern India ( ssp. <unk> ) are larger than those from the Sri Lankan population minor while those from the peninsular India ( nominate subspecies ) are intermediate in size . Race <unk> is found in Thailand , Hong Kong and China . This race has a much smaller rictal spot and the wings are dark with a greenish gloss . In southern Siam a race <unk> is resident , but overlaps with wintering <unk> . Race <unk> is found on the islands of Java and Bali . Race <unk> found in Formosa has the tail length less than the wing . 
 = = Description = = 
 This bird is glossy black with a wide fork to the tail . Adults usually have a small white spot at the base of the gape . The iris is dark brown ( not crimson as in the similar ashy drongo ) . The sexes cannot be told apart in the field . Juveniles are brownish and may have some white barring or speckling towards the belly and vent , and can be mistaken for the white @-@ bellied drongo . First @-@ year birds have white tips to the feathers of the belly , while second @-@ years have these white @-@ tipped feathers restricted to the vent . 
 They are aggressive and fearless birds , and although only 28 cm ( 11 in ) in length , they will attack much larger species that enter their nesting territory , including crows and birds of prey . This behaviour led to their former name of king crow . They fly with strong flaps of the wing and are capable of fast manoeuvres that enable them to capture flying insects . With short legs , they sit upright on thorny bushes , bare perches or electricity wires . They may also perch on grazing animals . 
 They are capable of producing a wide range of calls but a common call is a two note tee @-@ hee call resembling that of the <unk> ( Accipiter badius ) . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The black drongo is found predominantly in open country and usually perches and hunts close to the ground . They are mostly aerial predators of insects but also glean from the ground or off vegetation . They are found as summer visitors to northeastern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan but are residents from the Indus Valley until Bangladesh and into India and Sri Lanka . Some populations show seasonal movements that are poorly understood . The black drongo can be found in savannas , fields , and urban habitats . 
 Black drongos were introduced just before the Second World War from Taiwan to the island of Rota to help in the control of insects . It is believed that they dispersed over the sea to the island of Guam in the 1950s . By 1967 , they were the fourth most commonly seen birds in roadside counts on Guam and are today the most abundant bird there . Predation by and competition from black drongos have been suggested as factors in the decline of endemic bird species such as the Rota bridled white @-@ eye and the Guam flycatcher . 
 = = Behaviour and ecology = = 
 = = = Food and foraging = = = 
 Black drongos become active very early at dawn and roost later than many other birds . They feed mainly on insects such as grasshoppers , cicadas , termites , wasps , bees , ants , moths , beetles and dragonflies . They sometimes fly close to tree branches , attempting to disturb any insects that may be present . They congregate in fields that are being ploughed , picking up exposed caterpillars and beetle grubs . As many as 35 birds have been seen at such congregations . They are also attracted to burning grasslands where insects are disturbed . They appear to avoid flies . They associate with common mynas , cattle egrets and other birds that share a similar diet and habitat . <unk> benefit from this association and are more successful in their foraging . There is only partial overlap in the insect prey sought by mynas and drongos although in rare instances the drongos may rob prey from mynas . It is said that they imitate the call of the <unk> so as to put mynas to flight and then to steal prey . Similar behaviour , using false alarm calls , has been noted in the fork @-@ tailed drongo . There are some cases of the black drongo preying on small birds , reptiles , or maybe even bats . They have also been on occasion seen feeding on fish Flowers of trees such as Erythrina and <unk> may be visited for water and nectar and they are sometimes known to feed on grains . They are only rarely known to take larger arthropods such as scorpions and centipedes . They feed on milkweed butterflies that are often avoided by other predators and are known to feed late in the evening or night , often on insects attracted to artificial lights . 
 = = = Nesting and breeding = = = 
 Black drongos breed mainly in February and March in southern India , and until August in other parts of the country . Males and females sing in the mornings during the breeding season . Courtship can include aerobatic chases and they may lock their wings and beaks together , with the pair sometimes falling to the ground . Displays may be made on the ground . Pair bonds are retained for a whole breeding season . The nest is a cup made with a thin layer of sticks placed in the fork of branch , and is built in a week by both the male and female . Eggs are laid close to the first rains in April . The usual clutch is three or rarely four eggs laid in a cup nest placed in the fork of an outer branch of tree . Large leafy tree such as the jackfruit are preferred . The eggs are pale cream to red with spots and markings and are 26 mm ( 1 @.@ 0 in ) long and 19 mm ( 0 @.@ 75 in ) wide . The eggs are incubated by both parents and hatch after 14 to 15 days . Nestlings are brooded for the first five days , after which the young are capable of maintaining a fairly constant body temperature . A second clutch may be laid if the first is destroyed . Nests are sometimes built in telephone poles . A nesting territory of 0 @.@ 003 to 0 @.@ 012 km2 ( 0 @.@ 3 to 1 @.@ 2 hectares ) is maintained . 
 Helpers , offspring from the previous brood , have sometimes been noted to assist in feeding the fledglings at the nest of their parents . Cases of brood parasitism by the Asian koel have been noted . An average breeding success of 44 % has been noted with the main cause of fledgling mortality being shortage of insect food which in turn was dependent on rainfall . 
 = = = Mobbing and proximity nesting = = = 
 Their habit of driving away predators from near their nests is believed to encourage other birds such as orioles , doves , pigeons , babblers , and especially bulbuls , to nest in the vicinity . In one study 18 of 40 nests had red @-@ vented bulbuls nesting within 10 metres ( 33 ft ) . An abnormal case of a red @-@ vented bulbul feeding the chicks of a black drongo at their nest has been recorded . 
 They are so aggressive that they may sometimes land on large birds of prey and peck them when mobbing . It has been suggested that the Asian drongo @-@ cuckoo ( <unk> lugubris ) has evolved to mimic this species . The intensity of mobbing predators was studied in Java and observations showed that there was a significant increase in mobbing , during the nesting season , of some predators such as the Javan hawk @-@ eagle but the black eagle , a nest predator is mobbed with equal intensity in all seasons . It has been suggested that this strategy may avoid giving away the location of nests during the breeding season . 
 = = = Growth and development = = = 
 Young birds have a yellowish @-@ red gape . The feather follicles appear on the fourth day and pin feathers emerge after a week . Nestlings increase in weight steadily until they are 12 days old . The eyes open on the eighth day , the iris reddish @-@ black while the gape turns red . The young leave the nest after about 16 to 20 days after hatching . They do not have the fork in the tail until three weeks . The parents continue to feed and protect them for a month . Young birds may beg for food for longer , but are often ignored or chased away by the adults . Birds reach breeding condition in about two years . 
 Play behaviour has been observed with birds dropping a leaf in the air and catching it in mid @-@ air and these may possibly help young birds acquire aerobatic skills . 
 In southern India , they moult their feathers from June to October . The wing moult begins in July with the first primary and proceeds towards the tenth . Secondaries are replaced from August after the primaries are at the third quill . The secondary moult is not orderly , the 8th and 7th being dropped earlier than the rest . The tail feathers are moulted <unk> . Seasonal colour changes in the testicular tissues are caused by variation in melanin synthesis , with the dark pigmentation being lost during the breeding season .

 = Hurricane Bud ( 2006 ) = 
 Hurricane Bud was the first hurricane and second named tropical cyclone of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season . It formed as a tropical depression on July 10 , to the south of the southern tip of Baja California . Shortly after , it became a tropical storm , and soon after the storm began to develop an eye . It began to intensify rapidly and was upgraded to a hurricane on July 11 . Bud reached its peak intensity on July 13 , becoming a Category 3 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale at its peak . After reaching cooler waters and an unfavorable environment , the hurricane rapidly weakened and dropped to a tropical depression status on July 15 . The system continued to lose its convection and eventually degenerated by the next day . As the storm remained away from land , no effects were reported as a tropical cyclone , though its remnant brought precipitation to Hawaii . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On June 27 , 2006 , a tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa . It proceeded westward across the Atlantic Ocean and emerged into the eastern Pacific by July 7 . The wave spawned an area of low pressure , about 630 mi ( 1 @,@ 010 km ) to the south of Manzanillo , Mexico . Interest in the system grew over the next day , and convection gradually became better organized . Early on July 11 , the low was designated as a tropical depression . The storm tracked west @-@ northwestward throughout its entire duration , under the steering currents of a mid @-@ level subtropical ridge which extended westward from northern Mexico . 
 Initially , a small upper @-@ level low pressure system to the north of the depression generated northerly wind shear and dry air , which inhibited the development of thunderstorm activity . However , after the tropical depression was designated , the low weakened , and the wind shear relented . Located over warm waters , the storm attained tropical storm status at 0600 UTC on July 11 , and as such it was named Bud by the National Hurricane Center . Subsequently , the storm quickly intensified . With more favorable conditions , the storm displayed a fairly organized banding pattern , and the previously exposed center of circulation became surrounded by convection . At 0000 UTC on July 12 , the storm developed an eye and was upgraded to a hurricane . The convection surrounding the center deepened , and a burst of thunderstorm activity within the southeastern eyewall obscured the eye on satellite imagery . Outflow was well established in all quadrants , though it was slightly restricted to the east , which was believed to have resulted from interaction with Tropical Storm Carlotta . Later on July 12 , Bud was upgraded to a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . 
 The storm attained major hurricane status as a Category 3 storm early on July 13 . It presented a well @-@ defined eye that was about 23 mi ( 37 km ) in diameter , which was enveloped within by a complete ring of deep thunderstorms . A small cyclone , the area of winds contracted somewhat at around the same time . At 0600 UTC that day , the hurricane reached its peak intensity , with winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 953 mb . Subsequently encountering cooler waters and stable air , rapid weakening began . As a result of the weakening trend , Bud became a Category 2 storm at 1800 UTC . The eye became obscured , and core convective cloud tops began to warm . Early on July 14 , the storm dropped below hurricane status and lost much of its convection during the day . In addition to the cooler sea surface temperatures and an unfavorable environment , southeasterly shear contributed to the weakening . By the evening , only a patch of thunderstorm activity lingered to the north of the center . On July 15 , the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression , and it degenerated into a remnant low the next day . The low fully dissipated within the low @-@ level easterly trade winds on July 17 , about 750 mi ( 1 @,@ 210 km ) east @-@ northeast of Hawaii .

 As a tropical cyclone Bud did not impact land Bud remained away from land , no effects , property damage or fatalities were reported ; no ships were affected , and no tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued . The remnants of Bud later brought light rainfall to the Hawaiian islands on July 19 , two days after it dissipated .

Native to continental Australia , Tasmania and New Guinea , it is believed to have become extinct in the 20th century . It was the last extant member of its family , <unk> ; specimens of other members of the family have been found in the fossil record dating back to the late Oligocene . 
 Surviving evidence suggests that it was a relatively shy , nocturnal creature with the general appearance of a medium @-@ to @-@ large @-@ size dog , except for its stiff tail and abdominal pouch ( which was reminiscent of a kangaroo ) and a series of dark transverse stripes that radiated from the top of its back ( making it look a bit like a tiger ) . The thylacine was an apex predator , like the tigers and wolves of the Northern Hemisphere from which it obtained two of its common names . As a marsupial , it was not closely related to these placental mammals , but because of convergent evolution it displayed the same general form and adaptations . Its closest living relative is thought to be either the Tasmanian devil or the numbat . The thylacine was one of only two marsupials to have a pouch in both sexes ( the other being the water opossum ) . The male thylacine had a pouch that acted as a protective sheath , covering his external reproductive organs while he ran through thick brush . The thylacine has been described as a formidable predator because of its ability to survive and hunt prey in extremely sparsely populated areas . 
 The thylacine had become extremely rare or extinct on the Australian mainland before British settlement of the continent , but it survived on the island of Tasmania along with several other endemic species , including the Tasmanian devil . Intensive hunting encouraged by bounties is generally blamed for its extinction , but other contributing factors may have been disease , the introduction of dogs , and human encroachment into its habitat . Despite its official classification as extinct , sightings are still reported , though none has been conclusively proven . 
 = = Evolution = = 
 The modern thylacine first appeared about 4 million years ago . Species of the family <unk> date back to the beginning of the Miocene ; since the early 1990s , at least seven fossil species have been uncovered at Riversleigh , part of Lawn Hill National Park in northwest Queensland . Dickson 's thylacine ( <unk> <unk> ) is the oldest of the seven discovered fossil species , dating back to 23 million years ago . This <unk> was much smaller than its more recent relatives . The largest species , the powerful thylacine ( Thylacinus potens ) which grew to the size of a wolf , was the only species to survive into the late Miocene . In late Pleistocene and early Holocene times , the modern thylacine was widespread ( although never numerous ) throughout Australia and New Guinea . 
 An example of convergent evolution , the thylacine showed many similarities to the members of the dog family , Canidae , of the Northern Hemisphere : sharp teeth , powerful jaws , raised heels and the same general body form . Since the thylacine filled the same ecological niche in Australia as the dog family did elsewhere , it developed many of the same features . Despite this , it is unrelated to any of the Northern Hemisphere predators . 
 They are easy to tell from a true dog because of the stripes on the back but the skeleton is harder to distinguish . Zoology students at Oxford had to identify 100 zoological specimens as part of the final exam . Word soon got around that , if ever a ' dog ' skull was given , it was safe to identify it as Thylacinus on the grounds that anything as obvious as a dog skull had to be a catch . Then one year the examiners , to their credit , double bluffed and put in a real dog skull . The easiest way to tell the difference is by the two prominent holes in the palate bone , which are characteristic of marsupials generally . 
 = = Discovery and taxonomy = = 
 Numerous examples of thylacine engravings and rock art have been found dating back to at least 1000 BC . Petroglyph images of the thylacine can be found at the Dampier Rock Art Precinct on the <unk> Peninsula in Western Australia . By the time the first European explorers arrived , the animal was already extinct in mainland Australia and rare in Tasmania . Europeans may have encountered it as far back as 1642 when Abel Tasman first arrived in Tasmania . His shore party reported seeing the footprints of " wild beasts having claws like a Tyger " . Marc @-@ Joseph Marion du Fresne , arriving with the Mascarin in 1772 , reported seeing a " tiger cat " . Positive identification of the thylacine as the animal encountered cannot be made from this report since the tiger quoll ( Dasyurus maculatus ) is similarly described . The first definitive encounter was by French explorers on 13 May 1792 , as noted by the naturalist Jacques Labillardière , in his journal from the expedition led by D 'Entrecasteaux . However , it was not until 1805 that William Paterson , the Lieutenant Governor of Tasmania , sent a detailed description for publication in the Sydney Gazette . 
 The first detailed scientific description was made by Tasmania 's Deputy Surveyor @-@ General , George Harris in 1808 , five years after first settlement of the island . Harris originally placed the thylacine in the genus Didelphis , which had been created by Linnaeus for the American opossums , describing it as Didelphis <unk> , the " dog @-@ headed opossum " . Recognition that the Australian marsupials were fundamentally different from the known mammal genera led to the establishment of the modern classification scheme , and in 1796 , Geoffroy Saint @-@ Hilaire created the genus Dasyurus where he placed the thylacine in 1810 . To resolve the mixture of Greek and Latin nomenclature , the species name was altered to cynocephalus . In 1824 , it was separated out into its own genus , Thylacinus , by Temminck . The common name derives directly from the genus name , originally from the Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " pouch " or " sack " . 
 Several studies support the thylacine as being a basal member of the <unk> and the Tasmanian devil as its closest living relative . However , research published in Genome Research in January 2009 suggests the numbat may be more basal than the devil . The resulting cladogram follows below : 
 = = Description = = 
 Descriptions of the thylacine vary , as evidence is restricted to preserved joey specimens , fossil records , skins and skeletal remains , black and white photographs and film of the animal in captivity , and accounts from the field . 
 The thylacine held the title of Australia 's largest predator until about 3500 years ago . The thylacine resembled a large , short @-@ haired dog with a stiff tail which smoothly extended from the body in a way similar to that of a kangaroo . Many European settlers drew direct comparisons with the hyena , because of its unusual stance and general demeanour . Its yellow @-@ brown coat featured 13 to 21 distinctive dark stripes across its back , rump and the base of its tail , which earned the animal the nickname " tiger " . The stripes were more pronounced in younger specimens , fading as the animal got older . One of the stripes extended down the outside of the rear thigh . Its body hair was dense and soft , up to 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 6 in ) in length ; in juveniles the tip of the tail had a crest . Its rounded , erect ears were about 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) long and covered with short fur . Colouration varied from light fawn to a dark brown ; the belly was cream @-@ coloured . 
 The mature thylacine ranged from 100 to 130 cm ( 39 to 51 in ) long , plus a tail of around 50 to 65 cm ( 20 to 26 in ) . Adults stood about 60 cm ( 24 in ) at the shoulder and weighed 20 to 30 kg ( 40 to 70 lb ) . There was slight sexual dimorphism with the males being larger than females on average . 
 The female thylacine had a pouch with four teats , but unlike many other marsupials , the pouch opened to the rear of its body . Males had a scrotal pouch , unique amongst the Australian marsupials , into which they could withdraw their scrotal sac . 
 The thylacine was able to open its jaws to an unusual extent : up to 80 degrees . This capability can be seen in part in David Fleay 's short black @-@ and @-@ white film sequence of a captive thylacine from 1933 . The jaws were muscular but weak and had 46 teeth . 
 Thylacine footprints could be distinguished from other native or introduced animals ; unlike foxes , cats , dogs , wombats or Tasmanian devils , thylacines had a very large rear pad and four obvious front pads , arranged in almost a straight line . The hindfeet were similar to the forefeet but had four digits rather than five . Their claws were non @-@ retractable . 
 More detail can been seen in a cast taken ( below and to the left ) from a freshly dead thylacine . The cast shows the planter pad in more detail and shows that the planter pad is tri @-@ <unk> in that it exhibits three distinctive lobes . It is , however a single planter pad divided by three deep grooves . The distinctive planter pad shape along with the asymmetrical nature of the foot makes it quite different from animals such as dogs or foxes . This cast dates back to the early 1930s and is part of the Museum of Victoria 's thylacine collection . 
 The early scientific studies suggested it possessed an acute sense of smell which enabled it to track prey , but analysis of its brain structure revealed that its olfactory bulbs were not well developed . It is likely to have relied on sight and sound when hunting instead . Some observers described it having a strong and distinctive smell , others described a faint , clean , animal odour , and some no odour at all . It is possible that the thylacine , like its relative , the Tasmanian devil , gave off an odour when agitated . 
 The thylacine was noted as having a stiff and somewhat awkward gait , making it unable to run at high speed . It could also perform a bipedal hop , in a fashion similar to a kangaroo — demonstrated at various times by captive specimens . Guiler speculates that this was used as an accelerated form of motion when the animal became alarmed . The animal was also able to balance on its hind legs and stand upright for brief periods . 
 Observers of the animal in the wild and in captivity noted that it would growl and hiss when agitated , often accompanied by a threat @-@ yawn . During hunting it would emit a series of rapidly repeated guttural cough @-@ like barks ( described as " <unk> @-@ <unk> " , " cay @-@ <unk> " or " hop @-@ hop @-@ hop " ) , probably for communication between the family pack members . It also had a long whining cry , probably for identification at distance , and a low <unk> noise used for communication between family members . 
 Thylacines , uniquely for marsupials , have largely cartilaginous <unk> bones with a highly reduced osseous element . This has been once considered a synapomorphy with <unk> , though its now thought that both groups reduced their <unk> independently . 
 = = Ecology and behaviour = = 
 Little is known about the behaviour or habitat of the thylacine . A few observations were made of the animal in captivity , but only limited , anecdotal evidence exists of the animal 's behaviour in the wild . Most observations were made during the day whereas the thylacine was naturally nocturnal . Those observations , made in the twentieth century , may have been atypical as they were of a species already under the stresses that would soon lead to its extinction . Some behavioural characteristics have been extrapolated from the behaviour of its close relative , the Tasmanian devil . 
 The thylacine probably preferred the dry eucalyptus forests , wetlands , and grasslands in continental Australia . Indigenous Australian rock paintings indicate that the thylacine lived throughout mainland Australia and New Guinea . Proof of the animal 's existence in mainland Australia came from a desiccated carcass that was discovered in a cave in the Nullarbor Plain in Western Australia in 1990 ; carbon dating revealed it to be around 3 @,@ 300 years old . 
 In Tasmania it preferred the woodlands of the midlands and coastal heath , which eventually became the primary focus of British settlers seeking grazing land for their livestock . The striped pattern may have provided camouflage in woodland conditions , but it may have also served for identification purposes . The animal had a typical home range of between 40 and 80 km2 ( 15 and 31 sq mi ) . It appears to have kept to its home range without being territorial ; groups too large to be a family unit were sometimes observed together . 
 The thylacine was a nocturnal and crepuscular hunter , spending the daylight hours in small caves or hollow tree trunks in a nest of twigs , bark or fern fronds . It tended to retreat to the hills and forest for shelter during the day and hunted in the open heath at night . Early observers noted that the animal was typically shy and secretive , with awareness of the presence of humans and generally avoiding contact , though it occasionally showed inquisitive traits . At the time , much stigma existed in regard to its " fierce " nature , however this is likely to be due to its perceived threat to agriculture . 
 There is evidence for at least some year @-@ round breeding ( cull records show joeys discovered in the pouch at all times of the year ) , although the peak breeding season was in winter and spring . They would produce up to four cubs per litter ( typically two or three ) , carrying the young in a pouch for up to three months and protecting them until they were at least half adult size . Early pouch young were hairless and blind , but they had their eyes open and were fully furred by the time they left the pouch . After leaving the pouch , and until they were developed enough to assist , the juveniles would remain in the lair while their mother hunted . Thylacines only once bred successfully in captivity , in Melbourne Zoo in 1899 . Their life expectancy in the wild is estimated to have been 5 to 7 years , although captive specimens survived up to 9 years . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Although there are methods that can be used to identify the diet and feeding behavior of thylacine , findings and theories on this subject remain hotly debated . A study published in 2011 yields some insight : " Dental and biogeochemical evidence suggests that T. cynocephalus was a <unk> restricted to eating vertebrate flesh " The thylacine was exclusively carnivorous . Its stomach was muscular , and could distend to allow the animal to eat large amounts of food at one time , probably an adaptation to compensate for long periods when hunting was unsuccessful and food scarce . Analysis of the skeletal frame and observations of it in captivity suggest that it preferred to single out a target animal and pursue that animal until it was exhausted . Some studies conclude that the animal may have hunted in small family groups , with the main group herding prey in the general direction of an individual waiting in ambush . Trappers reported it as an ambush predator . 
 Little is known of the thylacine 's diet and feeding behaviour . Prey is believed to have included kangaroos , wallabies and wombats , birds and small animals such as <unk> and possums . One prey animal may have been the once common Tasmanian emu . The emu was a large , flightless bird which shared the habitat of the thylacine and was hunted to extinction around 1850 , possibly coinciding with the decline in thylacine numbers . Both dingoes and foxes have been noted to hunt the emu on the mainland . European settlers believed the thylacine to prey upon farmers ' sheep and poultry . Throughout the 20th century , the thylacine was often characterised as primarily a blood drinker ; according to Robert Paddle , the story 's popularity seems to have originated from a single second @-@ hand account heard by Geoffrey Smith ( 1881 – 1916 ) in a shepherd 's hut . In captivity , thylacines were fed a wide variety of foods , including dead rabbits and wallabies as well as beef , mutton , horse , and occasionally poultry . Tasmania 's leading naturalist Michael Sharland published an article in 1957 stating that a captive thylacine refused to eat dead wallaby flesh or to kill and eat a live wallaby offered to it , but " ultimately it was persuaded to eat by having the smell of blood from a freshly killed wallaby put before its nose . " 
 A 2011 study by the University of New South Wales using advanced computer modelling indicated that the thylacine had surprisingly feeble jaws . Animals usually take prey close to their own body size , but an adult thylacine of around 30 kilograms ( 66 lb ) was found to be incapable of handling prey much larger than 5 kilograms ( 11 lb ) . Researchers believe thylacines only ate small animals such as bandicoots and possums , putting them into direct competition with the Tasmanian devil and the tiger quoll . Such specialisation probably made the thylacine susceptible to small disturbances to the ecosystem . 
 Although the living grey wolf is widely seen as the thylacine 's counterpart , a recent study proposes that thylacine was more of an ambush predator as opposed to a pursuit predator . In fact , the predatory behaviour of the thylacine was probably closer to ambushing felids than to large pursuit canids . Consequently , at least in terms of the postcranial anatomy , the vernacular name of " Tasmanian tiger " may be more apt than " marsupial wolf " . 
 = = Extinction = = 
 = = = Extinction from mainland Australia = = = 
 The thylacine is likely to have become near @-@ extinct in mainland Australia about 2 @,@ 000 years ago , and possibly earlier in New Guinea . The absolute extinction is attributed to competition from indigenous humans and invasive dingoes . However , doubts exist over the impact of the dingo since the two species would not have been in direct competition with one another as the dingo hunts primarily during the day , whereas it is thought that the thylacine hunted mostly at night . In addition , the thylacine had a more powerful build , which would have given it an advantage in one @-@ on @-@ one encounters . Recent morphological examinations of dingo and thylacine skulls show that although the dingo had a weaker bite , its skull could resist greater stresses , allowing it to pull down larger prey than the thylacine could . The thylacine was also much less versatile in diet than the omnivorous dingo . Their environments clearly overlapped : thylacine subfossil remains have been discovered in proximity to those of dingoes . The adoption of the dingo as a hunting companion by the indigenous peoples would have put the thylacine under increased pressure . 
 Prideaux et al . ( 2010 ) examined the issue of extinction in the late Quaternary period in southwestern Australia . This paper notes that Australia lost 90 % or more of its larger terrestrial vertebrates during this time , with the notable exceptions of the kangaroo and the thylacine . The results show that the humans were obviously one of the major factors in the extinction of many species in Australia . But in reality , it was not until the humans had an adverse effect on the environment and brought disease to Australia that their arrival drove the thylacine to extinction . 
 Menzies et al . ( 2012 ) examined the relationship of the genetic diversity of the thylacines before their extinction . The results of their investigation indicated that the last of the thylacines in Australia , on top of the threats from dingoes , had limited genetic diversity , due to their complete geographic isolation from mainland Australia . 
 Johnson and Wroe ( 2003 ) observed the relationship between the dingo and the extinctions of the Tasmanian devil , the thylacine , and the Tasmanian native hen and the arrival of humans . The paper observed the obviously competitive relationship between the dingo and the thylacine and the Tasmanian devil , and noted that the dingo may have actually fed on the native hen . Yet , the paper concludes , people ignore the emergence of humans on the continent among all of this . In the end , the competitiveness of the dingo and thylacine populations led to the extinctions of the thylacine but the arrival of the humans only further exacerbated this . 
 Another study brings disease into the debate as a major factor in thylacine 's extinction : " Casually collected anecdotal records and early <unk> analyses have , at times , prompted the suggestion that disease was a major factor in the extinction of the species , that occurred when the last known specimen died in Hobart Zoo during the night of 7th September , 1936 . " This study also suggests that were it not for an epidemiological influence , the extinction of thylacine would have been at best prevented , at worst postponed . " The chance of saving the species , through changing public opinion , and the re @-@ establishment of captive breeding , could have been possible . But the <unk> @-@ carnivore disease , with its dramatic effect on individual thylacine longevity and juvenile mortality , came far too soon , and spread far too quickly . " 
 = = = Extinction in Tasmania = = = 
 Although the thylacine was extinct on mainland Australia , it survived into the 1930s on the island state of Tasmania . At the time of the first European settlement , the heaviest distributions were in the northeast , northwest and north @-@ midland regions of the state . They were rarely sighted during this time but slowly began to be credited with numerous attacks on sheep . This led to the establishment of bounty schemes in an attempt to control their numbers . The Van Diemen 's Land Company introduced bounties on the thylacine from as early as 1830 , and between 1888 and 1909 the Tasmanian government paid £ 1 per head . ( the equivalent of £ 100 or more today ) for dead adult thylacines and ten shillings for pups . In all they paid out 2 @,@ 184 bounties , but it is thought that many more thylacines were killed than were claimed for . Its extinction is popularly attributed to these relentless efforts by farmers and bounty hunters . However , it is likely that multiple factors led to its decline and eventual extinction , including competition with wild dogs introduced by European settlers , erosion of its habitat , the concurrent extinction of prey species , and a distemper @-@ like disease that also affected many captive specimens at the time . Whatever the reason , the animal had become extremely rare in the wild by the late 1920s . Despite the fact that the thylacine was believed by many to be responsible for attacks on sheep , in 1928 the Tasmanian Advisory Committee for Native Fauna recommended a reserve to protect any remaining thylacines , with potential sites of suitable habitat including the Arthur @-@ Pieman area of western Tasmania . 
 The last known thylacine to be killed in the wild was shot in 1930 by Wilf Batty , a farmer from <unk> , in the northeast of the state . The animal , believed to have been a male , had been seen around Batty 's house for several weeks . 
 = = = " Benjamin " and searches = = = 
 The last captive thylacine , later referred to as " Benjamin " , was trapped in the Florentine Valley by Elias Churchill in 1933 , and sent to the Hobart Zoo where it lived for three years . Frank Darby , who claimed to have been a keeper at Hobart Zoo , suggested " Benjamin " as having been the animal 's pet name in a newspaper article of May 1968 . However , no documentation exists to suggest that it ever had a pet name , and Alison Reid ( de facto curator at the zoo ) and Michael Sharland ( publicist for the zoo ) denied that Frank Darby had ever worked at the zoo or that the name " Benjamin " was ever used for the animal . Darby also appears to be the source for the claim that the last thylacine was a male ; photographic evidence suggested it was female . Paddle was unable to uncover any records of any Frank Darby having been employed by Beaumaris / Hobart Zoo during the time that Reid or her father was in charge and noted several inconsistencies in the story Darby told during his interview in 1968 . 
 The thylacine died on 7 September 1936 . It is believed to have died as the result of neglect — locked out of its sheltered sleeping quarters , it was exposed to a rare occurrence of extreme Tasmanian weather : extreme heat during the day and freezing temperatures at night . The thylacine features in the last known motion picture footage of a living specimen : 62 seconds of black @-@ and @-@ white footage showing the thylacine in its enclosure in a clip taken in 1933 , by naturalist David Fleay . In the film footage , the thylacine is seen seated , walking around the perimeter of its enclosure , yawning ( exposing its impressive gape ) , sniffing the air , scratching itself ( in the same manner as would a dog ) , and lying down . 
 The gender ( sex ) of the last captive thylacine has been a point of debate since its death at the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart , Tasmania . In 2011 , detailed examination of a single frame from the motion film footage confirmed that the thylacine was male . When frame III is enlarged the scrotum can clearly be seen , confirming the thylacine to be male . By enhancing the frame ( increasing exposure to 20 % and contrast to 45 % ) , the outline of the individual testes is discernable . 
 Although there had been a conservation movement pressing for the thylacine 's protection since 1901 , driven in part by the increasing difficulty in obtaining specimens for overseas collections , political difficulties prevented any form of protection coming into force until 1936 . Official protection of the species by the Tasmanian government was introduced on 10 July 1936 , 59 days before the last known specimen died in captivity . 
 The results of subsequent searches indicated a strong possibility of the survival of the species in Tasmania into the 1960s . Searches by Dr. Eric Guiler and David Fleay in the northwest of Tasmania found footprints and scats that may have belonged to the animal , heard vocalisations matching the description of those of the thylacine , and collected anecdotal evidence from people reported to have sighted the animal . Despite the searches , no conclusive evidence was found to point to its continued existence in the wild . Between 1967 and 1973 , zoologist Jeremy Griffith and dairy farmer James Malley conducted what is regarded as the most intensive search ever carried out , including exhaustive surveys along Tasmania 's west coast , installation of automatic camera stations , prompt investigations of claimed sightings , and in 1972 the creation of the Thylacine Expeditionary Research Team with Dr. Bob Brown , which concluded without finding any evidence of the thylacine 's existence . 
 The thylacine held the status of endangered species until the 1980s . International standards at the time stated that an animal could not be declared extinct until 50 years had passed without a confirmed record . Since no definitive proof of the thylacine 's existence in the wild had been obtained for more than 50 years , it met that official criterion and was declared extinct by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in 1982 and by the Tasmanian government in 1986 . The species was removed from Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) in 2013 . 
 = = = Unconfirmed sightings = = = 
 The Australian Rare Fauna Research Association reports having 3 @,@ 800 sightings on file from mainland Australia since the 1936 extinction date , while the Mystery Animal Research Centre of Australia recorded 138 up to 1998 , and the Department of Conservation and Land Management recorded 65 in Western Australia over the same period . Independent thylacine researchers Buck and Joan <unk> of Tasmania report 360 Tasmanian and 269 mainland post @-@ extinction 20th century sightings , figures compiled from a number of sources . On the mainland , sightings are most frequently reported in Southern Victoria . 
 Some sightings have generated a large amount of publicity . In 1973 , Gary and Liz Doyle shot ten seconds of 8 mm film showing an unidentified animal running across and alongside a South Australian road . Attempts to positively identify the creature as a thylacine have been impossible due to the poor quality of the film . In 1982 a researcher with the Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service , Hans <unk> , observed what he believed to be a thylacine for three minutes during the night at a site near Arthur River in northwestern Tasmania . The sighting led to an extensive year @-@ long government @-@ funded search . In 1985 , Aboriginal tracker Kevin Cameron produced five photographs which appear to show a digging thylacine , which he stated he took in Western Australia . In January 1995 , a Parks and Wildlife officer reported observing a thylacine in the <unk> region of northeastern Tasmania in the early hours of the morning . Later searches revealed no trace of the animal . In 1997 , it was reported that locals and missionaries near Mount Carstensz in Western New Guinea had sighted thylacines . The locals had apparently known about them for many years but had not made an official report . In February 2005 Klaus <unk> , a German tourist , claimed to have taken digital photographs of a thylacine he saw near the Lake St Clair National Park , but the authenticity of the photographs has not been established . The photos were published in April 2006 , fourteen months after the sighting . The photographs , which showed only the back of the animal , were said by those who studied them to be inconclusive as evidence of the thylacine 's continued existence . Due to the uncertainty of whether the species is still extant or not , the thylacine is sometimes regarded as a cryptid . 
 = = = Rewards = = = 
 In 1983 , the American media mogul Ted Turner offered a $ 100 @,@ 000 reward for proof of the continued existence of the thylacine . 
 A letter sent in response to an inquiry by a thylacine @-@ searcher , Murray McAllister in 2000 , indicated that the reward had been withdrawn . In March 2005 , Australian news magazine The Bulletin , as part of its 125th anniversary celebrations , offered a $ 1 @.@ 25 million reward for the safe capture of a live thylacine . When the offer closed at the end of June 2005 no one had produced any evidence of the animal 's existence . An offer of $ 1 @.@ 75 million has subsequently been offered by a Tasmanian tour operator , Stewart Malcolm . Trapping is illegal under the terms of the thylacine 's protection , so any reward made for its capture is invalid , since a trapping licence would not be issued . 
 = = Modern research and projects = = 
 Records of all specimens , many of which are in European collections , are now held in the International Thylacine Specimen Database . 
 The Australian Museum in Sydney began a cloning project in 1999 . The goal was to use genetic material from specimens taken and preserved in the early 20th century to clone new individuals and restore the species from extinction . Several molecular biologists have dismissed the project as a public relations stunt and its chief proponent , Mike Archer , received a 2002 nomination for the Australian Skeptics Bent Spoon Award for " the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudo @-@ scientific piffle . " 
 In late 2002 , the researchers had some success as they were able to extract replicable DNA from the specimens . On 15 February 2005 , the museum announced that it was stopping the project after tests showed the DNA retrieved from the specimens had been too badly degraded to be usable . In May 2005 , Archer , the University of New South Wales Dean of Science at the time , former director of the Australian Museum and evolutionary biologist , announced that the project was being restarted by a group of interested universities and a research institute . 
 The International Thylacine Specimen Database was completed in April 2005 , and is the culmination of a four @-@ year research project to catalog and digitally photograph , if possible , all known surviving thylacine specimen material held within museum , university and private collections . The master records are held by the Zoological Society of London . 
 In 2008 , researchers Andrew J. Pask and Marilyn B. <unk> from the University of Melbourne and Richard R. Behringer from the University of Texas at Austin reported that they managed to restore functionality of a gene <unk> enhancer obtained from 100 @-@ year @-@ old ethanol @-@ fixed thylacine tissues from museum collections . The genetic material was found working in transgenic mice . The research enhanced hopes of eventually restoring the population of thylacines . That same year , another group of researchers successfully sequenced the complete thylacine mitochondrial genome from two museum specimens . Their success suggests that it may be feasible to sequence the complete thylacine nuclear genome from museum specimens . Their results were published in the journal Genome Research in 2009 . 
 Mike Archer spoke about the possibilities of resurrecting the thylacine and the gastric @-@ brooding frog at <unk> . Stewart Brand spoke at <unk> about the ethics and possibilities of de @-@ extinction , and made reference to thylacine in his talk .

 The best known illustrations of Thylacinus cynocephalus were those in Gould 's The Mammals of Australia ( 1845 – 63 ) , often copied since its publication and the most frequently reproduced , and given further exposure by Cascade Brewery 's appropriation for its label in 1987 . The government of Tasmania published a monochromatic reproduction of the same image in 1934 , the author Louisa Anne Meredith also copied it for Tasmanian Friends and Foes ( 1881 ) . 
 The thylacine has been used extensively as a symbol of Tasmania . The animal is featured on the official Tasmanian coat of arms . It is used in the official logos for the Tasmanian government and the City of Launceston . It is also used on the University of Tasmania 's ceremonial mace and the badge of the submarine HMAS Dechaineux . Since 1998 , it has been prominently displayed on Tasmanian vehicle number plates . 
 The plight of the thylacine was featured in a campaign for The Wilderness Society entitled We used to hunt thylacines . In video games , boomerang @-@ wielding Ty the Tasmanian Tiger is the star of his own trilogy . Characters in the early 1990s cartoon Taz @-@ Mania included the neurotic Wendell T.

The thylacine character Rolf is featured in the extinction musical Rockford 's Rock Opera . The thylacine is the mascot for the Tasmanian cricket team , and has appeared in postage stamps from Australia , Equatorial Guinea , and Micronesia . 
 The Hunter is a novel by Julia Leigh about an Australian hunter who sets out to find the last thylacine . The novel has been adapted into a 2011 film by the same name directed by Daniel <unk> , and starring Willem Dafoe .

As of 2006 , there were a total of 11 Pūnana Leo preschools , with locations on five of the Hawaiian islands . 
 = = History = = 
 Establishment of the Pūnana Leo schools involved a long political struggle , including boycotts of the public schools ( Wilson 1998a : 335 – 336 ; McCarty 2003 : 155 ) . Using the Hawaiian language as a medium of education was outlawed in 1896 , and legal constraints against its use were maintained by territorial and U.S. state governments until 1986 ( Wilson 1998b : 128 – 129 ) . A renaissance of Hawaiian culture and politics in the 1970s brought a new focus to the topic of the revitalization of the Hawaiian language . Among its many consequences was the reestablishment of Hawaiian as an official language by a state constitutional convention in 1978 , as part of a recognition of the cultural and linguistic rights of the people of Hawaii . 
 Despite the revitalization of the Hawaiian language , many legal barriers remained in force as a legacy of past policies . In particular , public school education using Hawaiian as the language of instruction was banned by a law requiring the use of English as the medium of instruction through grade eight . The law more relevant to the private Pūnana Leo was one which effectively banned the last remaining native speakers of Hawaiian from being teachers because they lacked , and were very unlikely ever to obtain , the proper credentials ( Wilson 1998b : 132 ; Wilson 1999a : 333 ) . The initial removal of these legal barriers required three years of lobbying by families supporting the Pūnana Leo schools . Opponents to the lobbying effort , including in particular the existing the preschool establishment , cited the potential harm to a child ’ s development that being educated by untrained individuals might cause ( Wilson 1999a : 333 ) . After laws were revised , the public school system was slow to provide Hawaiian @-@ language instruction across all age levels of students , so parents in different communities began to boycott the public schools at each stage as their children advanced from preschool to kindergarten to elementary school to middle school , in a progression from " an initially illegal preschool to a boycott kindergarten , a state elementary school , [ and ] a boycott intermediate school " ( Wilson 1999b : 4 ; Wilson 1998b : 132 ) . 
 Eventually , these efforts led to the establishment of immersion streams or tracks , known as " schools @-@ within @-@ schools , " within existing school facilities ( McCarty 2003 : 153 ) . Today the Pūnana Leo preschools form the core of the ‘ Aha Pūnana Leo " Language nest corporation " or " Language nest gathering " ( Wilson & <unk> 2001 : 149 ) , the organization which has provided the impetus for the reestablishment of a Hawaiian @-@ language educational system which also includes K – 12 immersion schools and doctoral @-@ level programs in the language ( McIvor 2005 : 10 ; Leo 2006 ) . The ‘ Aha Pūnana Leo produces curriculum and teacher training for its preschools . The first @-@ ever class of Pūnana Leo students graduated from high school in 1999 , and in 2002 the Hilo campus of the University of Hawaii awarded the first master 's degree completed entirely in the Hawaiian language ( Edwards 2002 ) . As of 2006 , there were a total of 11 Pūnana Leo preschools , with locations on five of the Hawaiian islands : Hawai ‘ i , Maui , <unk> ‘ i , O ‘ <unk> and Kaua ‘ i ( Leo 2006 ) . 
 = = Goals = = 
 The schools ' goals include revitalization of the indigenous language , fostering Hawaiian identity , and " other central features of a person 's life and the life of a people " ( Wilson & <unk> 2001 : 161 ) . Their community @-@ based , Hawaiian educational philosophy – Ke <unk> <unk> <unk> Ola – includes the use of parental labor through in @-@ kind service , and requires that parents attended language classes and administer the schools through a parent committee ( McCarty 1998 : 320 ) . This philosophy was based on the practices of 19th century Hawaiian @-@ medium schools ( Wilson 1998a : 337 n 6 ) , as well as the <unk> reo Māori language kindergartens in New Zealand . The curriculum includes Hawaiian cultural practices such as gardening native plants and the foliage for lei ; visiting historically significant sites ; and the culturally @-@ important practice of ho <unk> ( hospitality ) . Although classes are conducted in Hawaiian , they are functionally different from foreign @-@ language immersion schools . 
 Although early opponents suggested the Pūnana Leo schools would harm students ' academic development , graduates from the schools have achieved several measures of academic success in later life . This is true despite the fact that the emphasis of the schools is on language revitalization rather than academic achievement : " Immersion students have garnered prestigious scholarships , enrolled in college courses while still in high school , and passed the state university 's English composition assessments , despite receiving the majority of their English , science and mathematics instruction in Hawaiian . Student achievement on standardised tests has equalled ... [ or ] surpassed that of Native Hawaiian children enrolled in English language schools , even in English language arts ( McCarty 2006 : 38 ) . " These academic benefits come in addition to language revitalization and an increased realization of cultural pride . 
 = HMS Magnificent ( 1894 ) = 
 HMS Magnificent was one of the nine Majestic @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of the Royal Navy . She entered service in late 1895 with the Channel Fleet , remaining with the fleet through its subsequent reorganisation into the Atlantic Fleet . In 1905 , an explosion caused the deaths of 18 men but she remained in service until 1906 , after which she underwent a refit . She served with the Home Fleet for most of her pre @-@ war service . 
 Among the oldest of Britain 's battleships at the time , Magnificent was a guard ship on the Humber when World War I broke out . She was then , together with her sister ship Hannibal , assigned to Scapa Flow as a guard ship . In 1915 , she was stripped of her main armament , and later in that year was converted to a troopship for use in the Dardanelles Campaign . Returning to England in 1916 , she was inactive until late 1917 , at which time she was converted to an ammunition ship . She continued to serve in this role until 1921 , at which time she was decommissioned before being scrapped the following year . 
 = = Design = = 
 Magnificent was laid down at the Chatham Dockyard on 18 December 1893 . She was launched a year and a day later , on 19 December 1894 , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . She was commissioned into the Royal Navy another year later , in December 1895 . The ship was 421 feet ( 128 m ) long overall and had a beam of 75 ft ( 23 m ) and a draft of 27 ft ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) . She displaced up to 16 @,@ 060 t ( 15 @,@ 810 long tons ; 17 @,@ 700 short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two 3 @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines powered by eight coal @-@ fired cylindrical boilers . By 1907 – 1908 , she was re @-@ boilered with oil @-@ fired models . Her engines provided a top speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) at 10 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 7 @,@ 500 kW ) . The Majestics were considered good seaboats with an easy roll and good steamers , although they suffered from high fuel consumption . She had a crew of 672 officers and enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with four BL 12 @-@ inch Mk VIII guns in twin turrets , one forward and one aft . The turrets were placed on pear @-@ shaped barbettes ; six of her sisters had the same arrangement , but her sisters Caesar and Illustrious and all future British battleship classes had circular barbettes . Magnificent also carried twelve QF 6 @-@ inch / 40 guns . They were mounted in casemates in two gun decks amidships . She also carried sixteen QF 12 @-@ pounder guns and twelve QF 2 @-@ pounder guns . She was also equipped with five 18 in ( 460 mm ) torpedo tubes , four of which were submerged in the ship 's hull , with the last in a deck @-@ mounted launcher . Magnificent and the other Majestic @-@ class ships had 9 inches ( 229 mm ) of Harvey armour , which allowed equal protection with less cost in weight compared to previous types of armour . This allowed Magnificent and her sisters to have a deeper and lighter belt than previous battleships without any loss in protection . The barbettes for the main battery were protected with 14 in ( 360 mm ) of armor , and the conning tower had the same thickness of steel on the sides . The ship 's armored deck was 2 @.@ 5 to 4 @.@ 5 in ( 64 to 114 mm ) thick . 
 = = Service history = = 
 HMS Magnificent was commissioned at Chatham Dockyard on 12 December 1895 to relieve the battleship Empress of India as second flagship of the Channel Fleet . On 26 June 1897 , she was present at the Fleet Review at Spithead for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria . Captain John Ferris was appointed in command in January 1899 , and from February the following year she joined the Eastern division of the Channel Fleet , flying the flag of Rear @-@ Admiral Arthur Dalrymple Fanshawe . On receiving word of the death of Queen Victoria on 21 January 1901 while stationed in Portsmouth , Magnificent flew the Royal Standard at half mast . Captain Arthur John Horsley was appointed in command in October 1900 , and in June the following year she became flagship of Rear @-@ Admiral Sir William Acland , second in command of the Channel Squadron . He relinquished the position one year later , and at sunset on 5 June 1902 struck his flag on board the Magnificent . Rear @-@ Admiral Assheton Curzon @-@ Howe , who had succeeded Acland , transferred to the vessel later the same month . 
 By January 1904 , the ship had become the flagship of the Channel Fleet . As a result of a reorganization in January 1905 , the Channel Fleet became the Atlantic Fleet , and Magnificent accordingly became a part of the Atlantic Fleet . A gun explosion aboard Magnificent on 14 June 1905 resulted in 18 casualties . The explosion was caused by a faulty shell in one of the 6 @-@ inch guns ; it failed to fire , and when the loader opened the breech , contact with the fresh air detonated the shell . On 15 November 1906 , she ended her Atlantic Fleet service and was paid off at Devonport . Magnificent was commissioned into reserve on 16 November 1906 , based at Chatham . During her reserve service , she was attached to the Gunnery School at Sheerness as a gunnery training ship in December 1906 . 
 Magnificent left Chatham in March 1907 and was assigned to the Nore Division of the Home Fleet at the Nore . During this service , she temporarily was flagship of the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief in November 1907 and underwent a refit at Chatham in 1908 during which she had new fire control systems installed and was converted to burn fuel oil . She served as the second flagship of the Home Fleet from August 1908 to January 1909 . Magnificent was reduced to a nucleus crew in February 1909 as part of the commissioned reserve . On 24 March 1909 , she became the flagship of the Vice Admiral , 3rd and 4th Divisions , Home Fleet , at the Nore . She was relieved as flagship on 1 March 1910 by the battleship Bulwark . On 27 September 1910 , Magnificent was recommissioned into the Home Fleet to serve as a turret drill ship and stokers ' training ship at Devonport . Her sternwalk was damaged in a collision in December 1910 . She became tender to the turret drill ship Vivid in February 1911 and a seagoing gunnery training ship at Devonport on 14 May 1912 . She was slightly damaged on 16 June 1913 when she ran aground in fog near Cawsand Bay . She recommissioned for 3rd Fleet service on 1 July 1913 . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 During a precautionary mobilization of the fleet immediately prior to the outbreak of World War I , Magnificent and her sister ships Hannibal , Mars , and Victorious on 27 July 1914 formed the 9th Battle Squadron , subordinate to the Admiral of Patrols and stationed at the Humber . Magnificent served as guard ship at the Humber . World War I began while she was stationed there . On 7 August 1914 , the 9th Battle Squadron was dissolved , and Magnificent and Hannibal transferred to Scapa Flow to reinforce the defences of the anchorage of the Grand Fleet there , becoming a guard ship at Scapa Flow . The Majestic @-@ class ships were by then the oldest and least effective battleships in service in the Royal Navy . The first @-@ class protected cruiser Crescent relieved Magnificent of guard ship duty on 16 February 1915 , at which point Magnificent was paid off . 
 Later in February 1915 , Magnificent arrived at Belfast to be disarmed . In March and April 1915 , all of her 12 @-@ inch guns and all except for four of her 6 @-@ inch guns were removed . Her 12 @-@ inch guns were taken to arm the new Lord Clive @-@ class monitors General Craufurd and Prince Eugene . After she was disarmed , Magnificent was laid up at Loch Goil in April 1915 . On 9 September 1915 , Magnificent was recommissioned to serve along with her similarly disarmed sister ships Hannibal and Mars as a troopship for the Dardanelles campaign . The three former battleships departed the United Kingdom on this duty on 22 September 1915 , arriving at Mudros on 7 October 1915 . On 18 December 1915 and 19 December 1915 , Magnificent took part in the evacuation of Allied troops from Suvla Bay . She departed the Dardanelles in February 1916 after the conclusion of the campaign and returned to England , where she was paid off at Devonport on 3 March 1916 . 
 Magnificent remained at Devonport until August 1917 , serving as an overflow ship . In August 1917 , she began a refit at Harland & Wolff in Belfast for conversion to an ammunition ship . When her refit was completed in October 1918 , she was transferred to Rosyth for service as an ammunition store ship . Magnificent was placed on the disposal list on 4 February 1920 , but continued to serve as an ammunition store ship at Rosyth until April 1921 . She was sold for scrapping on 9 May 1921 . Scrapping began at Inverkeithing the following year . 
 = Guanche mummies = 
 Guanche mummies are the intentionally desiccated remains of members of the indigenous Guanche people of the Canary Islands . The majority of Guanche mummies were made during the eras prior to Spanish settlement of the area in the 15th century . The methods of embalming are similar to those that were used by the Ancient Egyptians , though fewer mummies remain from the Guanche due to looting and desecration . 
 = = Archaeological record = = 
 Mummification on the Canaries remained confined to the islands of Tenerife , Gran Canaria , La Gomera , and El Hierro . The most well @-@ preserved , and therefore the most thoroughly @-@ studied , mummies were found on Tenerife . 
 In 1933 , the Guanche necropolis of <unk> was discovered in the municipality of San Miguel de Abona in southern Tenerife . It is estimated that it contained between 60 @-@ 74 mummies before the cemetery was almost completely looted . 
 Physical examination of the Guanche mummies of Tenerife found that they were quite tall . On average , the males stood 1 @.@ 70 m and the females were 1 @.@ 57 m in height . They were also generally of robust constitution . 
 = = Historical record = = 
 Medieval Spanish explorers arriving in the islands during the 14th Century reported the Guanche buried individuals of low social status in sandy graves , while upper class members were mummified and laid to rest in secluded caves . One of these mortuary caves may have held up to 1 @,@ 000 mummies , however , many of these have disappeared with only 20 complete mummies left on the islands . The loss of such a large amount of mummies is generally attributed to the popularity of <unk> , a pharmaceutical substance created out of pulverized mummies . 
 The Guanche had groups of males and females , working as mummification specialists , who would carry out the process according to the gender of the decedent . The Guanche culture considered these individuals unclean due to the nature of their work . 
 = = Mummification process = = 
 While early explorers reported various traditions associated with Guanche mummification , there are three methods identified in modern times through scientific analysis : evisceration , preservation , and stuffing . These methods have been used in various different combinations depending on the era in which the mummy was created . 
 In 1876 , Dr. Don Gregorio Chil y Naranjo discovered several incisions in some mummies that he speculated may have been used to remove the internal organs . Don Brothwell 's work in 1969 confirmed that evisceration was a method used by the Guanche . Along with a team of other scientists , Brothwell conducted a pathological examination of a Guanche mummy . The examination revealed that the body had been eviscerated , then the abdominal and thoracic cavities had been packed with a mud @-@ like substance that contained the bark of a pine tree . Some sort of packing was also applied subcutaneously , but the exact make @-@ up of this particular embalming substance is unknown . 
 An examination conducted by Patrick Horne in 1991 of a mummy held at the Redpath Museum at McGill University in Montreal , Canada revealed moss had been used to stuff the empty abdominal cavity . In addition to the moss , there were several other types of local plant that had been preserved inside the body as packing . 
 Preservation of the outer parts of the body was normally achieved through a combination of resins and animal skin wrappings . The resins were prepared with a mixture of minerals , plants , and fats . These were spread across the body prior to allowing it to dry , either in the sun or through smoking . Finally , the decedent was wrapped in animal skins and laid to rest . The number of animal skins used in wrapping corresponded with the individual ’ s social status , with kings being wrapped with up to 15 skins . 
 = Mouna Ragam = 
 Mouna Ragam ( English : Silent Symphony , also spelt Mouna Raagam ) is a 1986 Indian Tamil @-@ language romantic @-@ drama film written and directed by Mani Ratnam , and produced by G. Venkateswaran . The film narrates the life of Divya Chandramouli ( Revathi ) , who is robbed of her carefree existence when she reluctantly marries Chandrakumar ( Mohan ) . Divya does not wish to be married as she is still grieving over the shooting death of her former lover Manohar ( Karthik ) . The rest of the story follows Divya 's inner conflict between holding on to her past or coming to terms with the present and making a life with Chandrakumar . 
 Mouna Ragam 's development began when Ratnam wrote a short story titled " Divya " , while he was making his debut film Pallavi Anu Pallavi ( 1983 ) . As the script developed he renamed it . He did not plan to film the story until he finished writing it , but he could not start actual production on it until after his fourth film , Idaya Kovil ( 1985 ) , was released . Mouna Ragam was filmed mainly in Chennai ; additional filming took place in Delhi and Agra . The soundtrack album and background score were composed by Ilaiyaraaja with lyrics by Vaali ; cinematography was handled by P. C. Sreeram , and the art director was Thotta Tharani . The film was jointly edited by B. Lenin and V. T. Vijayan . 
 Mouna Ragam was released on 15 August 1986 , India 's Independence Day . Despite opening to modest audiences , it became a box office success , running for over 175 days in theatres . The film was critically acclaimed and won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil , while Ratnam won the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Director . Mouna Ragam was dubbed in Telugu under the same title and was released on 14 February 1987 ; this version was also a commercial success . The film was remade in Hindi in 1992 as <unk> , with Rishi Kapoor and Neelam Kothari in the lead roles . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Divya Chandramouli ( Revathi ) is a free @-@ spirited college student from a conservative family whose father , Chandramouli ( Ra . Sankaran ) , works for the government and is very strict about her conduct . Divya learns that her parents are eagerly awaiting a marriage proposal for her . Unwilling to get married , and hoping the groom 's family will reject her , she deliberately arrives home late only to find that the groom , Chandrakumar ( Mohan ) , and his family are patiently waiting for her . She talks arrogantly to Chandrakumar in an attempt to make him dislike her , but he is undeterred , says that he likes her , and agrees to the marriage . Divya refuses initially , but when her father suffers a heart attack , the family pleads with her to accept the proposal so as not to hinder his recovery . Succumbing to family pressure , Divya marries Chandrakumar . 
 After their marriage , Chandrakumar takes Divya to Delhi . She is unable to accept him as her husband and constantly snubs him . When Chandrakumar asks Divya what she wants as a wedding gift , she asks him for a divorce . Startled , Chandrakumar asks her the reason for wanting a divorce . In a flashback , Divya remembers when she was in love with a man named Manohar ( Karthik Muthuraman ) , whom she met during her college days . Manohar and his gang assault the son of an MP named <unk> and steal his money . Divya reports Manohar to the police who arrest him . She later learns that <unk> 's son had run over a poor girl with his car and Manohar had stolen the money to pay for the girl 's medical treatment . Divya feels guilty and bails him out of the police station . 
 Manohar falls in love with Divya and tries to win her love . Divya rejects him initially but eventually reciprocates his feelings . Manohar is a member of a revolutionary group planning to hold an illegal rally . Divya does not approve of his participation in such activities and asks him not to attend the rally . Manohar agrees to her request on the condition that she marry him . On their wedding day Manohar is falsely charged with participating in the rally and is arrested by police . He escapes and , pursued by police , runs to the marriage registrar 's office where Divya is waiting for him . A policeman shoots Manohar and he dies in front of Divya , leaving her distraught . 
 Chandrakumar is ready to overlook Divya 's past , but she is unable to accept another man in her life . Seeking a divorce , the pair approach a lawyer ( Kanchana ) , who tells them that according to the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 , since they are newly married , they must wait for at least one year before they can file for divorce . The couple are forced to live with each other for a year . 
 Later , Chandrakumar is attacked by his company 's labourers because he had earlier suspended their union leader . Divya takes him to a nearby hospital , where he survives after getting proper treatment . After his discharge from the hospital , Divya takes care of him and realises that she has fallen in love with him . She tries to show it by wearing the anklets he gave her just after their marriage . Irritated by Divya 's immature acts , Chandrakumar asks her to return to her parent 's home and books tickets for her travel . At the railway station , Chandrakumar gives Divya the divorce papers that she had earlier requested as a wedding gift . Divya breaks down and admits to Chandrakumar that she loves him . Chandrakumar comes to terms with his repressed feelings and finally unites with Divya .

 When the last schedule for Mani Ratnam 's debut film Pallavi Anu Pallavi ( 1983 ) was extended to a year , he began working on a script titled " Divya " , which eventually became his fifth film Mouna Ragam . Ratnam said he first wrote " Divya " as a short story about the " first night " between the female lead and her husband . He did not originally plan to film it , but after writing the story he realised that he could base a film on it . Ratnam took a month 's break between the schedules of Pallavi Anu Pallavi and wrote the script for Divya . Ratnam said Mouna Ragam 's script took five years to write . 
 The inspiration for the title Mouna Ragam came from the song " Naan <unk> Mouna Ragam " from Ratnam 's film Idaya Kovil ( 1985 ) . Although Ratnam began working on the script while making Pallavi Anu Pallavi , Mouna Ragam did not go into production until after Idaya Kovil 's release . Ratnam stated that due to budgetary constraints , it would have been easier for him to send the female lead to Bangalore instead of Delhi , but he wanted to ensure that she could not easily return to her parents because of her inability to adjust to her husband . 
 Mouna Ragam was Ratnam 's first film with P. C. Sreeram as cinematographer . It was produced by G. Venkateswaran under his banner Sujatha Films ( later renamed <unk> Films ) , and was jointly edited by B. Lenin and V. T. Vijayan . The film 's art director was Thota Tharani . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Ratnam cast Mohan , whom he had previously worked with in Idaya Kovil , as the male lead . Revathi , the female lead , had previously collaborated with Ratnam in Pagal Nilavu ( 1984 ) . Ratnam initially had " someone like Anant Nag and Supriya Pathak " in mind when he finished writing Mouna Ragam . Between finishing the story and making the film , he decided to include Revathi because he was impressed with her performance in Mann <unk> ( 1983 ) . Nadhiya was also considered for the role before Revathi , but she declined the offer because of prior commitments . Ra . Sankaran was cast as Divya 's father Chandramouli , Kanchana as the lawyer , and V. K. Ramasamy as Chandrakumar 's boss . Vani plays Divya 's mother and Bhaskar plays Divya 's brother , while actresses <unk> and " Baby " Sonia play Divya 's sisters . Prabhu Deva , who later went on to become a successful choreographer in Indian cinema , made his acting debut with this film with a special appearance in the song " Panivizhum Iravu " . 
 According to Ratnam , the only difference between Divya and Mouna Ragam was the inclusion of the portion featuring Karthik , which was not part of the earlier screenplay . Divya was the story about a young woman settling into an arranged marriage and did not mention her life before her marriage . Ratnam realised that the story needed to satisfy a wider audience , and decided to give them something that would make them accept the character as a plot point , preventing the audience from questioning Divya 's actions . The story became a film dealing with an arranged marriage — two strangers suddenly thrown together — and how they adjust . At first , Ratnam resisted this point , but he reconsidered because the suddenness of it provided a clear reason for the heroine 's resistance to the arranged marriage . Karthik said he was a " last @-@ minute addition " to the cast , and that his scenes were shot in a week . He also said his role was " but a cameo " . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Since the film was set mostly indoors in Delhi , both Ratnam and Sreeram wanted the indoor scenes to look as lively as those that were shot outdoors . As the cast was relatively small , Ratnam did not want the film to look like a play . The concept of backlighting inside a house was used . For this , Thotta Tharani found a house in Chennai that let in a lot of sunlight , making it different and convincing enough to have a setting similar to houses in Delhi . Mouna Ragam was Ratnam 's first film to make extensive use of staccato dialogues , which became his trademark style in his later films . In a bid to reduce the production costs , food for the film 's production unit was cooked at the producer 's home . 
 While filming the introductory scene of Karthik 's character Manohar , Sreeram had to lie on a bedsheet to film the sequence . The rest of the crew pulled the sheet along with Sreeram and the camera . Sreeram used frontal and profile close @-@ ups set against long shots with out @-@ of @-@ focus foregrounds extensively . The scene in which Manohar plays a prank on Divya 's father Chandramouli at a coffee shop , which later became known popularly as the " Mr. Chandramouli " scene , was shot at Nungambakkam . Filming also took place at Presidency College , Chennai , and the Schmidt Memorial on Edward Elliot ’ s Beach . 
 The crew filmed in Delhi for two days ; the portions set in Agra were shot in one day . The song " Panivizhum Iravu " was filmed at the Taj Mahal , while scenes from " Mandram Vandha " were shot at the India Gate and in Sikandra . The scenes involving Karthik were the last portions of the principal photography . In the post @-@ production phase , Mohan 's voice was dubbed by S. N. <unk> . The film 's final cut was 3 @,@ 987 @.@ 50 metres ( 13 @,@ 082 @.@ 3 ft ) long . 
 = = Themes and influences = = 
 Mouna Ragam is based on the management concept of transactional analysis , which describes the ego state theory of personality . In his book The Best of Tamil Cinema , G. Dhananjayan compares the relationship between Chandrakumar and Divya , at the beginning of the film , to a parent @-@ child relationship ; he says the relationship then changes to one of " parent @-@ adult " and finally to " adult @-@ adult " . Film critic Baradwaj Rangan compared Mouna Ragam to J. Mahendran 's <unk> <unk> ( 1980 ) , which is also based on a woman torn between the man she loves and the man she marries . He also compared the film to <unk> <unk> <unk> ( 1981 ) and its Hindi remake Woh Saat Din ( 1983 ) for the same reason . 
 Manohar was part of a group that was involved in anti @-@ government activities . Rangan drew similarities between the character 's motives and those of characters in the Italian film The Night of the Shooting Stars ( 1982 ) and Ratnam 's Malayalam film <unk> ( 1984 ) . Mouna Ragam 's introductory credits feature photographs of Revathi from her childhood through her teenage years which , according to rapper <unk> , helps viewers " understand the girl , the character , her nature " . According to Rangan , the scene in which Divya is at the hospital looking after Chandrakumar reflects the traditional quality that surfaces when she cares for her husband and fears for his life , and shows that , despite her strengths , she is humane and vulnerable . Divya 's mischievous nature is shown in a scene in which she deliberately teaches a Sardar to say offensive Tamil phrases , which he uses on V. K. Ramasamy 's character . 
 According to Rangan , Mouna Ragam 's background score was found by critics to be synonymous with its scenes and themes . According to the 2003 book The Cultural Study of Music : A Critical Introduction by Martin Clayton , Trevor Herbert and Richard Middleton , the picturisation of the song " Oho Megam Vandhadho " resembled the Broadway and MTV @-@ style of singing and dancing , while the main songs combine American music with Indian vocals provided by S. Janaki . The South Asian musical instruments Sarangi and Nadaswaram are used in the music accompanying the wedding scene with Chandrakumar and Divya . In the sequences showing the couple sightseeing in Delhi , light synth @-@ based music is used to depict them as modern tourists in their own country . The restaurant scene featuring Manohar and Divya includes sitar music being played awkwardly , indicating the couple 's emotions . Spanish music is used for the fight sequence when Manohar attacks the MP 's son . 
 The concept of the heroine moving to a strange place where she does not know the local language is a theme replicated in Mani Ratnam 's later films Roja ( 1992 ) and Bombay ( 1995 ) . The theme shows the heroine with a dilemma . Because she does not know the language in Delhi , she can barely socialise with local people , and she is in conflict with the only person with whom she can relate . According to Rangan , the restaurant scene with Manohar and Divya is notable for being the first occasion in Tamil cinema that a man invites a woman for a cup of coffee . He compared it to Oru <unk> Ragam ( 1980 ) , in which the protagonists hardly spoke . Ratnam said he was inspired by the bands The Doors and The Beatles , and though it was not uncommon to invite a woman for a cup of coffee , it was not reflected in Tamil cinema at that time .

" Writing for Firstpost , Apoorva <unk> said , " The film traces a couple 's marital discord — the heroine is torn between the man she loved and the man she finally marries — and the soundtrack beautifully mimics it . " She described " Mandram Vandha " as a " masterpiece , sung soulfully by SP Balasubramaniam . "

A Telugu film , also titled Mouna Ragam , was released in 2010 but had no connection with Ratnam 's film . Baradwaj Rangan compared Mouna Ragam to the Hindi film Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam ( 1999 ) because in both films , " the disengaged wife was tempted , at several points , to snap free of matrimony , but what held her back , eventually , was the innate decency of the man she married " . <unk> <unk> ( 2008 ) was compared by critics to Mouna Ragam because it also features a woman ( Chaya Singh ) reluctantly married to a man ( R.

 = Hurricane Gilma ( 1994 ) = 
 Hurricane Gilma was one of the most intense Pacific hurricanes on record and the second of three Category 5 hurricanes during the active 1994 Pacific hurricane season . Developing from a westward tracking tropical wave over the open waters of the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 21 , the pre @-@ Gilma tropical depression was initially large and disorganized . Gradual development took place over the following day before rapid intensification began . By July 23 , the storm intensified into a hurricane and later a Category 5 storm on July 24 . As Gilma reached this intensity , it crossed into the Central Pacific basin , the fourth consecutive storm to do so . 
 The storm peaked early on July 24 with winds of 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) and a barometric pressure estimated at 920 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 17 inHg ) . The following day , unknown factors caused the storm to suddenly weaken before increasing wind shear took over . The storm gradually weakened for the duration of its existence , turning slowly to the northwest . Late on July 28 , the storm brushed Johnston Atoll , bringing gusty winds and light rainfall to the region . Gilma persisted until July 31 at which time it was downgraded to a tropical depression and dissipated over open waters . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Gilma originated from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa and traversed the Atlantic Ocean during the second week of July 1994 . The wave was of little note until it crossed Central America and entered the Northeastern Pacific hurricane basin on July 15 @-@ 16 . Convection began to increase ; however , the system remained disorganized . Tracking westward , gradual development took place , leading to the Dvorak classification being initiated on July 20 . Several hours later , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) designated the system as Tropical Depression Seven @-@ E. A strong ridge situated north of the depression steered the system steadily westward . This movement would remain the same throughout most of the storm 's existence . The depression was initially hard to locate due to its large size . 
 Following an increase in organization , the depression intensified into a tropical storm early on July 22 , at which time it was named Gilma . Deep convection developed around the center of circulation throughout the day and banding features became apparent on the west and south sides of the storm . Only 24 hours after becoming a tropical storm , Gilma quickly intensified into a hurricane . Low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures , recorded up to 29 ° C ( 84 ° F ) by a ship near the hurricane , allowed the storm to undergo rapid intensification . This rate of intensification continued throughout most of July 23 , resulting in the system attaining Category 4 status on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale . By this time , a small , well @-@ defined eye had developed within the center of the hurricane surrounded by very deep convection . 
 On July 24 , the storm crossed 140 ° W , entering the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's ( CPHC ) area of responsibility . Upon entering the region , Gilma became the fourth consecutive cyclone to move into the CPHC region . Several hours later , Gilma attained its peak intensity as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) and a barometric pressure estimated at 920 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 17 inHg ) . After maintaining this intensity for roughly 12 hours , the storm abruptly weakened . Within a few hours , maximum winds decreased by 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) to 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) , a low @-@ end Category 3 hurricane . The reason for the sudden weakening is unknown ; although the tropical upper tropospheric trough originally located over the storm , providing it with a favorable anticyclonic flow , shifted westward to the International Date Line . Additionally , the storm 's eye became obscured by cirrus clouds . 
 After maintaining Category 3 intensity for 24 hours , the combination of increasing wind shear and degrading outflow , Gilma resumed its weakening trend . Late on July 27 , the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm as winds fell below the 74 mph ( 119 km / h ) threshold . Although weakening , CPHC forecaster Sasaki noted that the storm may have re @-@ intensified slightly shortly after being downgraded . The following morning , the center of Gilma became devoid of convection , exposing the low @-@ level circulation . By this time , the weakening storm began a west @-@ northwesterly track , eventually taking the storm within 100 mi ( 160 km ) of Johnston Atoll late on July 28 . Gradual weakening continued to take place throughout the rest of the storm 's existence , leading to its downgrade to a tropical depression on July 30 . Several hours after being declared a tropical depression , the storm dissipated early on July 31 over open waters south of Midway Atoll . 
 = = Impact = = 
 The hurricane 's only impact was on Johnston Atoll . The island received light rain , wind gusts to near gale force , and some surf . No loss of life or damage was reported . Gilma 's name was not retired after the 1994 season , and it was used again in the 2000 and 2006 seasons . However , in 2007 , the Central Pacific Hurricane Center requested that the name Gilma , along with 14 other names , be retired as they have become memorable due to the threat of damage . That proposal was not accepted and the name " Gilma " remains on the list for 2012 . 
 = Metamorfosis World Tour = 
 The Metamorfosis World Tour was a worldwide concert tour by Guatemalan singer – songwriter Ricardo Arjona in support of his thirteenth studio album , Independiente . Beginning in January 2012 , it was Arjona 's first tour since leaving Warner Music to become an independent artist . The tour was announced in December 2011 with dates at American , Argentinian and Chilean venues , and received a positive critical response . The show was designed for a revolving stage , with Arjona performing while the scenery changed with the songs being performed . Four changes of scenery were developed : a two @-@ floor apartment , a bar , a circus and a theatre . The number of songs played at each show varied from 19 to 23 . 
 The tour broke several records . In Buenos Aires it was the best @-@ attended show ever at Velez Stadium , attracting a total audience of more than 160 @,@ 000 . In Guatemala City , Arjona became the first artist with two consecutive sold @-@ out concerts at the Mateo Flores Stadium . The tour was seen by more than two million people in twenty countries . Most songs performed were from Independiente , and fellow Guatemalan singer – songwriter Gaby Moreno joined Arjona for " Fuiste Tú " . The Metamorfosis World Tour followed Arjona 's Quinto Piso Tour ( one of the most successful tours by a Latin artist , with a total attendance of over one million in 19 countries ) . 
 = = Background = = 
 Weeks before the release of Independiente , Arjona published an open letter concerning his past relationships with recording companies . He revealed the circumstances surrounding his first contract ( " a producer , friend of mine , told them [ the record label ] that if they did not sign me in , they won 't sign two artists he had [ at that time ] " ) , explaining that he received the " minimum royalty percentage " from his most successful albums . Independiente is Arjona 's first independent release on his own label : Metamorfosis , a company he created to refocus his career . The company is headed by Arjona and several friends ( including photographer – director Ricardo Calderón , Universal Music México executive Humberto Calderon and BMG 's Miriam Sommerz ) , and is based in Miami and Mexico City . Arjona asserted that his independence represented compromise more than freedom : " Inside the word ' Independent ' , even when it sounds like extreme freedom , there 's a big amount of compromise and the responsibility of being able to administrate , in the best way possible , such independence " . Billboard noted that while other groups have released independent albums following contracts with major labels , Arjona is the foremost Latin pop artist to do so . Although the album is marketed by the new label , its distribution is handled by Warner Music .
