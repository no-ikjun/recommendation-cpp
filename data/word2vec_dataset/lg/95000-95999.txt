 Early reviews of the promotional version of the game received by redeeming a code that came with Guitar Hero 5 were critical of the game . IGN 's Erik Brudvig rated the game 4 @.@ 9 / 10 , citing problems with the lack of relevance of Van Halen relative to the culture of the 2000s , including having their avatars based on their current appearances rather than that of their 80s heyday , the lack of songs from Sammy Hagar 's period in the band , and the lack of features since introduced with Guitar Hero 5 . Brudvig ultimately stated that those who got the game free through the Guitar Hero 5 promotion " got what they paid for " . Robert Workman of Game Daily was less critical of the title , but still noted that the game lacked features , including some mention of Hagar and Gary Cherone and songs from their period with the band , and felt that the title was below the quality of Guitar Hero : Metallica . Both Brudvig and Workman commented positively on the sound recordings and the note tracking of the Van Halen songs . 
 Guitar Hero : Van Halen reviews following its release were similarly negative . Ben Kuchera of Ars Technica considered the game 's limited coverage of the band 's history to be " a sadly revisionist and dishonest take " , and felt that the non @-@ Van Halen songs clashed with the band 's own material . Kuchera further pointed to Activision 's distribution strategy for the game , stating that he felt that giving the game away free with Guitar Hero 5 showed that Activision did not have confidence in the game . Philip Horton of The Telegraph was critical of the game 's song selection , the band 's modern appearance , and the lack of any additional extras compared with either the previous band @-@ centric games or Guitar Hero 5 , and described it as " the weakest offering in the series to date " . Kate Carter of The Guardian commented that the game is " neither one thing or the other " , as it neither succeeds at bringing anything new to the Guitar Hero series nor fully pays tribute to Van Halen . Computer and Video Games ' review complained about the " shoddy character models " and described it as " the laziest Guitar Hero yet " , and Nathan Meunier of GamePro said that while the Van Halen songs were good and challenging , the remaining tracks did not fit the theme of the game , and that " the lackluster presentation makes the game feel more like a glorified track pack than a true homage " . 
 Guitar Hero : Van Halen sold fewer than 75 @,@ 000 units across all platforms in North America from December 22 to 31 , 2009 , according to NPD Group . As of April 2010 , the game has sold fewer than 250 @,@ 000 copies worldwide , with only 95 @,@ 000 units sold in North America . These numbers do not include copies of the game distributed in conjunction with Guitar Hero 5 . 
 = Nancy Mitford = 
 Nancy Freeman @-@ Mitford CBE ( 28 November 1904 – 30 June 1973 ) , known as Nancy Mitford , was an English novelist , biographer and journalist . One of the renowned Mitford sisters and one of the " Bright Young People " on the London social scene in the inter @-@ war years , she is best remembered for her novels about upper @-@ class life in England and France and for her sharp and often provocative wit . She also established a reputation for herself as a writer of popular historical biographies . 
 Mitford enjoyed a privileged childhood as the eldest daughter of the Hon. David Freeman @-@ Mitford , later 2nd Baron Redesdale . Educated privately , she had no training as a writer before publishing her first novel in 1931 . This early effort and the three that followed it created little stir ; it was her two semi @-@ autobiographical postwar novels , The Pursuit of Love ( 1945 ) and Love in a Cold Climate ( 1949 ) , that established her reputation . Mitford 's marriage to Peter Rodd in 1933 proved unsatisfactory to both ( they divorced in 1957 after a lengthy separation ) , and during the Second World War she formed a liaison with a Free French officer , Gaston Palewski . He became the love of her life , although the pair were never a formal couple . After the war Mitford settled in France and lived there until her death , maintaining social contact with her many English friends through letters and regular visits . 
 During the 1950s Mitford was identified with the concept of " U " ( upper ) and " non @-@ U " language , whereby social origins and standing were identified by words used in everyday speech . She had intended this as a joke , but many took it seriously , and Mitford was considered an authority on manners and breeding — possibly her most recognised legacy . Her later years were bitter @-@ sweet , the success of her biographical studies of Madame de Pompadour , Voltaire and King Louis XIV contrasting with the ultimate failure of her relationship with Palewski . From the late 1960s her health deteriorated , and she endured several years of painful illness before her death in 1973 . 
 = = Life = = 
 = = = Family background and connections = = = 
 The Mitford family dates from the Norman era , when Sir John de Mitford held the Castle of Mitford in Northumberland . A later Sir John held several important public offices during the late 14th and early 15th centuries , and the family maintained a tradition of public service for many generations . In the 18th century William Mitford was a leading classical historian , responsible for the definitive history of ancient Greece . His great @-@ grandson Algernon Bertram Mitford , born in 1837 and known as " Bertie " , was a diplomat and traveller who held minor office in Disraeli 's second ministry , from 1874 to 1880 . In 1874 he married Clementina , the second daughter of David Ogilvy , 10th Earl of Airlie , a union that linked the <unk> to some of Britain 's most prominent aristocratic families . Blanche Ogilvy , Clementina 's elder sister , became the wife of Sir Henry Montague Hozier , a soldier turned businessman . Their four children included daughters Clementine ( " Clemmie " ) , who in 1908 married the future British prime minister Winston Churchill , and Nellie who married Bertram Romilly . Both Hozier and Blanche were promiscuous , and it is generally accepted by historians and family members that Hozier was not Clemmie 's father , although he was registered as such . Blanche told her friend Lady Londonderry , shortly before Clemmie 's birth , that the father of the expected child was her own brother @-@ in @-@ law , Bertie Mitford ; most historians believe that other candidates for the paternity are more likely . 
 Bertie Mitford 's marriage produced five sons and four daughters . His career in government service ended in 1886 , when after the death of a cousin he inherited a considerable fortune . A condition of the inheritance was that he adopt the surname " Freeman @-@ Mitford " . He rebuilt Batsford House , the family 's country seat , served briefly as a Unionist MP in the 1890s , and otherwise devoted himself to books , writings and travel . In 1902 he was raised to the peerage as 1st Baron Redesdale , a re @-@ creation of a title that had previously been held in the family but had lapsed in 1886 .

 Nancy Mitford 's father , David Bertram Ogilvy Freeman @-@ Mitford , was Bertie Mitford 's second son , born on 13 March 1878 . After several years as a tea planter in Ceylon he fought in the Boer War of 1899 – 1902 and was severely wounded . In 1903 he became engaged to Sydney Bowles , the elder daughter of Thomas Gibson Bowles , known as " Tap " , a journalist , editor and magazine proprietor whose publications included Vanity Fair and The Lady . The couple were married on 16 February 1904 , after which they rented a house in Graham Street in West London . Bowles provided his son @-@ in @-@ law with a job , as business manager of The Lady magazine . David had little interest in reading and knew nothing of business ; thus , according to Nancy Mitford 's biographer Selena Hastings , " a less congenial post ... could hardly have been imagined " . He remained in this position for ten years . The couple 's first child , a daughter , was born on 28 November 1904 ; they had intended to call her Ruby , but after she was born they changed their minds and named her Nancy . 
 = = = = First years = = = = 
 Responsibility for Nancy 's day @-@ to @-@ day upbringing was delegated to her nanny and nursemaid , within the framework of Sydney 's short @-@ lived belief that children should never be corrected or be spoken to in anger . Before this experiment was discontinued , Nancy had become self @-@ centred and uncontrollable ; Hastings writes that her first years were " characterised by roaring , red @-@ faced rages " . Just before her third birthday , a sister , Pamela , was born ; the nanny 's apparent change of loyalty in favour of the new arrival was a further source of outrage to Nancy , and throughout their childhood and into young adulthood she continued to vent her displeasure on her sister . 
 In January 1909 a brother , Tom was born , and in June 1910 another sister , Diana , followed . That summer , to relieve the pressure on what was becoming an overcrowded nursery , Nancy attended the nearby Francis Holland School . The few months she spent there represented almost the whole of her formal schooling ; in the autumn the family moved to a larger house in Victoria Road , Kensington , after which Nancy was educated at home by successive governesses . Summers were spent at the family 's cottage near High Wycombe , in Buckinghamshire , or with the children 's Redesdale grandparents at Batsford Park . In the winter of 1913 – 14 David and Sydney visited Canada , prospecting for gold on a claim that David had purchased in Swastika , Ontario . It was here that their fifth child was conceived , a daughter born in London on 8 August 1914 and christened Unity . 
 = = = = War , Batsford Park and Asthall Manor = = = = 
 On the outbreak of the First World War on 4 August 1914 , David rejoined his regiment and was soon in France . In May 1915 , Clement , David 's older brother , was killed while serving with the 10th Royal Hussars , which made David heir to the Redesdale title and lands . On 17 August 1916 Bertie Mitford died ; David , still serving at the front , became the 2nd Baron Redesdale . Sydney quickly took possession of Batsford House , much of which had been shut up for many years , and occupied the portion of it that she could afford to heat . The children had the run of the house and grounds , and were taught together in the schoolroom . This was a source of frustration for Nancy , whose lively intelligence required greater stimulus . She spent many hours reading in the Batsford House library where , according to Hastings , the foundations of her intellectual life were laid . 
 The Redesdale estates were extensive , but uneconomical . At the end of the war Redesdale decided to sell Batsford Park and move his increasing family ( a fifth daughter , Jessica , had been born in September 1917 ) to less extravagant accommodation . The house was sold early in 1919 , together with many of its contents — including , to Nancy 's great dismay , much of its library . The new family home was Asthall Manor , a Jacobean mansion near Swinbrook in Oxfordshire . This was intended as a short @-@ term measure while a new house was built on land nearby . The family stayed in Asthall Manor for seven years , and it became the basis of many of the family scenes which Nancy was later to portray in her semi @-@ autobiographical novels . 
 Growing up proved a difficult process for Nancy . Unable to form a relationship with Pamela , the sister nearest to her in age , she was bored and irritated by her younger siblings , and vented her feelings by teasing and tormenting them . Although there was undoubtedly cruelty in her taunting — the other children , led by Tom , formed a " <unk> ( sic ) against Nancy " — her teasing was also , according to the later reflections of her nephew Alexander Mosley : " a highly @-@ honed weapon to keep a lot of highly competitive , bright , energetic sisters in order . She used it ... as a form of self protection " . Not all her interactions with her siblings were hostile ; for their amusement she edited and produced a magazine , The Boiler , to which she contributed entertainingly gruesome murder stories . 
 In 1921 , after years of pleading for proper schooling , Nancy was allowed a year 's boarding at <unk> Castle , an informal private establishment for young ladies of good family . Laura Thompson , in her biography of Nancy , describes <unk> as not so much a school , " more a chaste foretaste of debutante life " . Here Nancy learned French and other subjects , played organised games and joined a Girl Guide troop . It was her first extended experience of life away from home , and she enjoyed it . The following year she was allowed to accompany four other girls on a cultural trip to Paris , Florence and Venice ; her letters home are full of expressions of wonder at the sights and treasures : " I had no idea I was so fond of pictures ... if only I had a room of my own I would make it a regular picture gallery " . 
 = = = Debutante and socialite = = = 
 Nancy 's eighteenth birthday in November 1922 was the occasion for a grand " coming @-@ out " ball , marking the beginning of her entry into Society . This was followed in June 1923 by her presentation at Court — a formal introduction to King George V at Buckingham Palace — after which she was officially " out " and could attend the balls and parties that constituted the London Season . She spent much of the next few years in a round of social events , making new friends and mixing with the " Bright Young People " of 1920s London . Nancy declared that " we hardly saw the light of day , except at dawn " . In 1926 Asthall Manor was finally sold . While the new house at Swinbrook was made ready , the female members of the family were sent for three months to Paris , a period which , says Hastings , began Nancy 's " lifelong love affair " with France . 
 Among Nancy 's new London friends was Evelyn Gardner who , Nancy informed her brother Tom , was engaged " to a man called Evelyn Waugh who writes , I believe , very well " . She and Waugh later developed a lasting friendship . Although she was now of age , her father maintained an aggressive hostility towards most of her male friends , particularly since , as Hastings remarks , these tended towards the frivolous , the aesthetic and the effeminate . Among them was Hamish St Clair Erskine , the second son of the 5th Earl of Rosslyn , an Oxford undergraduate four years Nancy 's junior . He was , according to Hastings , the least suitable partner of all , " the most shimmering and narcissistic of all the beautiful butterflies " — and the one most likely to offend Lord Redesdale . The pair met in 1928 and became unofficially engaged , despite his homosexuality ( of which Nancy may not have been aware ) . Against a backdrop of negativity from family and friends — Waugh advised her to " dress better and catch a better man " — the affair endured sporadically for several years . 
 = = = <unk> writer = = = 
 As a means of augmenting the meagre allowance provided by her father , Mitford began writing , encouraged by Waugh . Her first efforts , anonymous contributions to gossip columns in society magazines , led to occasional signed articles , and in 1930 The Lady engaged her to write a regular column . That winter , she embarked on a full @-@ length novel , Highland Fling , in which various characters — mostly identifiable among her friends , acquaintances and family — attend a Scottish house @-@ party which develops chaotically . The book made little impact when it was published in March 1931 , and she immediately began work on another , Christmas Pudding . Like the earlier novel , the plot centres on a clash between the " Bright Young People " and the older generation . Hamish Erskine is clearly identifiable in the character of " Bobby Bobbin " , and John Betjeman is the basis for the supporting role of Bobby 's tutor . The thinly disguised caricatures pervading the book shocked Lady Redesdale , who thought it could not possibly be published under Mitford 's own name . 
 The affair between Erskine and Mitford continued intermittently . While she often despaired of the relationship , she refused other offers of marriage , saying that she would " never marry anyone except Hamish . " In 1932 her plight was overshadowed by a family scandal involving her younger sister Diana , who had married Bryan Guinness in 1928 and was the mother of two young sons . In 1932 Diana deserted her husband to become the mistress of Sir Oswald Mosley , the leader of the British Union of Fascists , himself married with three children . Almost alone of her family , Mitford offered her sister support , regularly visiting her and keeping her up to date with family news and social gossip . Her own love affair with Erskine came to an abrupt end when , in June 1933 , he informed her that he intended to marry the daughter of a London banker . In a final letter after their parting , Mitford wrote to him : " I thought in your soul you loved me & that in the end we should have children & look back on life together when we are old " . 
 = = = Marriage , writing , politics = = = 
 Within a month of Erskine 's departure , Mitford announced her engagement to Peter Rodd , the second son of Sir Rennell Rodd , a diplomat and politician who was ennobled that year as Baron Rennell . According to Mitford 's friend Harold Acton , Rodd was " a young man of boundless promise ... he had abundant qualifications for success in any profession he deigned to choose " . Other biographers describe him as irresponsible , unfaithful , a bore and unable to hold down a regular job , and as the model for Waugh 's unscrupulous , amoral character Basil Seal from Black Mischief . They were married on 4 December 1933 , after which they settled into a cottage at Strand @-@ on @-@ the @-@ Green on the western edges of London . Mitford 's initial delight in the marriage was soon tempered by money worries , Rodd 's fecklessness and her dislike of his family . 
 In 1934 Mitford began her third novel , Wigs on the Green , a satire on Mosley 's fascist " Blackshirt " movement . Mitford herself had briefly flirted with this cause , although her enthusiasm was short @-@ lived and she soon became a vociferous opponent of fascism . When the novel was published in 1935 it made little critical impact , while seriously offending members of her own family , particularly her sisters Diana and Unity , both of whom were supporters of Mosley 's movement and devotees of the German dictator Adolf Hitler . Diana eventually forgave her , but the rift with Unity , who was outraged by her depiction in the book as the ridiculous " Eugenia <unk> " , was never fully healed . 
 By 1936 Mitford 's marriage was largely a sham . Rodd was engaged in an affair with the wife of a friend , a situation that continued into the new year , when the Mitford family was further shaken by the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Jessica 's elopement with her cousin Esmond Romilly . A rebellious ex @-@ Wellington schoolboy and avowed Communist , Romilly had been invalided home after fighting on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War . The young couple were traced to Bilbao ; Mitford was despatched to bring them home , but failed to persuade them , and they were married in May . 
 Through the winter of 1937 – 38 Mitford 's main literary task was editing the letters of her cousins the Stanleys of Alderley , with whom she was connected through her great @-@ grandmother Blanche Airlie . Her preoccupation with this project — nine or ten hours a day , she informed her friend Robert Byron — further damaged her relationship with Rodd , who resented the time thus spent . Nevertheless , in the summer of 1938 she discovered she was pregnant . She hoped for a girl : " 2 Peter <unk> in 1 house is unthinkable " , but in September she miscarried . Early in 1939 Rodd left for the South of France , to work with the relief organisations assisting the thousands of Spanish refugees who had fled from General Franco 's armies in the final stages of the civil war . In May Mitford joined him , and spent several weeks there as a relief worker . She was much affected by what she saw : " I have never cried so much in all my life " . The experience hardened her anti @-@ fascism to the extent that she wrote : " I would join hands with the devil himself to stop any further extension of the disease " . 
 Having rejected the political extremes within her family , Mitford affected a stance of moderate socialism , though as Hastings points out , without much depth or conviction . Many of her writings — for example , her introductions to the Stanley letter collections , and her " U – non @-@ U " essay of 1955 — are staunch defences of aristocratic traditions and values . 
 = = = Second World War = = = 
 The outbreak of war in September 1939 divided the Mitford family . Nancy and Rodd supported the war ; the <unk> had by this time departed for America , while the others either hoped for an Anglo @-@ German détente or , as with Unity , were openly pro @-@ Nazi . Unity was in Munich when war was declared ; in despair she attempted suicide by shooting herself in the head . She survived , and was sent home through neutral Switzerland . Mosley and Diana , who had married secretly in 1936 , were detained under Defence Regulation 18B . Nancy , in full anti @-@ fascist mode , had described her sister to the British Intelligence agency MI5 as " a ruthless and shrewd egotist , a devoted fascist and admirer of Hitler [ who ] sincerely desires the downfall of England and democracy in general . " During the " phoney war " of 1939 – 40 , Nancy was briefly an Air Raid Precautions ( ARP ) driver , and later worked shifts at a first @-@ aid post in Paddington . She drew on these experiences in her fourth novel , Pigeon Pie , a comedy about spying . It was published by Hamish Hamilton in May 1940 , at a time when there was little public appetite for lighthearted war satire , and the book was a commercial failure . 
 In April 1940 Mitford suffered her second miscarriage . Shortly afterwards Rodd , who had been commissioned into the Welsh Guards , departed overseas . Alone in London , Mitford moved to the family 's Rutland Gate house where she remained during the London blitz . The main house had been requisitioned to provide a refuge for Jewish families evacuated from the bombed areas of the East End . Mitford spent much of her time looking after these families , " so hard @-@ working , clean and grateful " . A brief affair with a Free French officer , André Roy , resulted in a third pregnancy . Mitford again miscarried , with complications that led , in November 1941 , to a hysterectomy . After convalescence , at a loose end , she began working as an assistant at the Heywood Hill bookshop in Curzon Street . The shop became the centre of Mitford 's daily activities , and was a favoured meeting place for London 's literati . In September 1942 she met Gaston Palewski , a French colonel attached to General Charles de Gaulle 's London staff . She found him fascinating , and he became the love of her life — though her feelings were never fully reciprocated — and an inspiration for much of her future writing . For the sake of Mitford 's reputation the affair was pursued with discretion , before Palewski left for Algeria in May 1943 . Thereafter the relationship was conducted mainly by letters and occasional phone calls , since Palewski was only intermittently in England before the end of the war . 
 Pigeon Pie 's failure had cooled Mitford 's desire to write , but in 1944 , with Waugh 's encouragement , she began planning a new novel . In March 1945 she was given three months ' leave from the shop to write it . The Pursuit of Love is a heavily autobiographical romantic comedy in which many of her family and acquaintances appear in thin disguises . Despite the distraction of learning that her brother Tom had died fighting in Burma , she finished the book and , in September , went to Paris . Ostensibly this was to establish a French branch of Heywood Hill but in reality she wished to be close to Palewski , who was now a member of de Gaulle 's postwar provisional government . She was back in London in December 1945 for the publication of The Pursuit of Love which was , Hastings records , " an instant and phenomenal success ... the perfect antidote to the long war years of hardship and austerity , providing the undernourished public with its favourite ingredients : love , childhood and the English upper classes " . The book sold 200 @,@ 000 copies within a year of publication , and firmly established Mitford as a best @-@ selling author . 
 = = = Move to Paris = = = 
 At the end of the war Rodd returned home , but the marriage was essentially over ; although remaining on friendly terms , the couple led separate lives . Mitford 's visit to France in late 1945 had revived her longing to be there , and in April 1946 , having given up working in the shop the previous month , she left London to make her permanent home in Paris ; she never lived in England again . She was a prolific letter writer , and kept contact with her large cohort of friends by a voluminous correspondence . According to Hastings , she developed many of her friendships far further on paper than she could have done through normal social intercourse . 
 = = = = Rue Monsieur = = = = 
 During her first 18 months in Paris Mitford lived in several short @-@ term lodgings while enjoying a hectic social life , the hub of which was the British Embassy under the regime of the ambassador , Duff Cooper , and his socialite wife Lady Diana Cooper . Eventually Mitford found a comfortable apartment , with a maid , at No. 7 rue Monsieur on the Left Bank , close to Palewski 's residence . Settled there in comfort , she established a pattern to her life that she mostly followed for the next 20 years , her precise timetable determined by Palewski 's varying availability . Her socialising , entertaining and working were interspersed with regular short visits to family and friends in England and summers generally spent in Venice . 
 In 1948 Mitford completed a new novel , a sequel to The Pursuit of Love she called Love in a Cold Climate , with the same country house ambience as the earlier book and many of the same characters . The novel 's reception was even warmer than that of its predecessor ; Waugh was one of the few critics to qualify his praise — he thought the descriptions were good but the conversations poor . In 1950 she translated and adapted André Roussin 's play La petite <unk> ( " The Little Hut " ) , in preparation for its successful West End début in August , The Times 's critic noted the " habit of speech at once colloquial and unexpected which instantly declares itself the creation of Miss Mitford . " The play ran for 1 @,@ 261 performances , and provided Mitford with a steady £ 300 per month in royalties . The same year The Sunday Times asked her to contribute a regular column , which she did for four years . This busy period in her writing life continued in 1951 with her third postwar novel , The Blessing , another semi @-@ autobiographical romance this time set in Paris , in which an aristocratic young Englishwoman is married to a libidinous French marquis . Harold Acton deems it her most accomplished novel , " permeated with her joyous love of France " . This time Waugh ( to whom the book was dedicated ) had no criticism ; he found the book " admirable , deliciously funny , consistent and complete , by far the best of your writings " . 
 Mitford then began her first serious non @-@ fiction work , a biography of Madame de Pompadour . The general view of the critics , when the book was published in March 1954 , was that it was " marvellous entertainment , if hardly to be taken as history " . The historian A.J.P. Taylor likened Mitford 's evocation of 18th @-@ century Versailles to " <unk> " , the fictitious country house that formed the background to her recent best @-@ selling novels , a comparison that she found offensive . 
 = = = = Noblesse Oblige = = = = 
 In 1954 Alan Ross , a University of Birmingham professor of linguistics , devised the terms " U " and " Non @-@ U " to differentiate the speech patterns of the social classes in England . " U " indicated upper @-@ class usage , and " Non @-@ U " the conventions of the lower strata of society . His article , in a learned Finnish journal and with an illustrative glossary , used The Pursuit of Love to exemplify upper @-@ class speech patterns . In a spirit of mischief , Mitford incorporated the U and Non @-@ U thesis into an article she was writing for Encounter on the English aristocracy . Although this aspect formed only a small section of Mitford 's article , when it was published in September 1955 it caused a major stir . Few recognised the tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek aspect ; Mitford received hundreds of letters from worried readers desperate to know if they were snobs or merely " common " . The level of anxious or amused interest was sustained to such an extent that in 1956 Hamish Hamilton reproduced the article in a short book , entitled Noblesse Oblige . The book also included an abbreviated version of Ross 's original article , and contributions from Waugh , Betjeman , Peter Fleming and Christopher Sykes , It was a tremendous success ; as Lovell records , " ' U and Non @-@ U ' was the buzz phrase of the day ... Nancy 's comments made her the arbiter of good manners for several generations " . Thompson notes the irony that the U and Non @-@ U labels , perhaps Mitford 's best @-@ known legacy , were not her own but were borrowed for the purpose of a " tease " . 
 = = = = Later career = = = = 
 In October 1957 Palewski was appointed as France 's ambassador to Italy . Mitford 's meetings with him , which had become increasingly rare because of his many political and social commitments , were now reduced to a single visit a year , supplemented with occasional letters . Mitford mainly concealed her true feelings on this separation , although one acquaintance noted her increasingly " savage " teasing of friends , which was perhaps a safety valve : " If she would only tell one she is unhappy one would do what one could to comfort her " . In March 1958 Mitford 's father , Lord Redesdale , died . After the cremation , she informed her sister Jessica , " the ashes were done up in the sort of parcel he used to bring back from London , rich thick brown paper & incredibly neat knots " . 
 Meanwhile Mitford had completed her latest book , Voltaire in Love , an account of the love affair between Voltaire and the Marquise du Châtelet . She considered it her first truly grown @-@ up work , and her best . Published in 1957 , it sold well , was taken seriously by the critics and was warmly praised by Mitford 's friends . Its writing had been hampered by painful headaches arising from her apparently failing eyesight and worries that she might be going blind . The problem was resolved after a visit to the <unk> surgeon Patrick Trevor @-@ Roper , who gave her new spectacles : " It is heavenly to be able to read for a long time on end & now I see how handicapped I was when doing Voltaire " . She then returned to writing fiction , with Don 't Tell Alfred , in which she revived Fanny <unk> , the narrator of The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate , and placed her in a Paris setting as wife of the British ambassador . Several characters familiar from the earlier novels appear in minor roles . The book , published in October 1960 , was popular with the public , but received indifferent reviews . Some of Mitford 's friends disliked it , and she decided she would write no more fiction . 
 In August 1962 Palewski was appointed a minister in Georges Pompidou 's government , and returned to Paris . This did not mean more regular or frequent meetings , and the affair with Mitford continued at arm 's length . In April 1963 Mitford was in England for the wedding of her cousin Angus Ogilvy to Princess Alexandra . A month later she was back for the funeral of her mother , Lady Redesdale , who died on 25 May . Mitford 's friends were dying , too , " in middle age " , she informed her long @-@ time friend Violet Hammersley . The premature deaths included that of Evelyn Waugh , who died on 10 April 1966 . Mitford saw the kindness and humour concealed behind his hostile public image , and said after his death : " What nobody ever remembers about Evelyn is everything with him was jokes . Everything " . Thompson calls their relationship " one of the great literary friendships of the twentieth century " . 
 Amidst these personal upheavals Mitford continued writing . In 1964 she began work on The Sun King , a biography of King Louis XIV . Her publishers decided to issue it as a lavishly illustrated " coffee table " book . When it was published in August 1966 , among the many tributes to the book was that of President de Gaulle , who recommended it to every member of his cabinet . By this time , Mitford 's relationship with Palewski had become dormant , and she recognised that the best days would never return . Under pressure from her landlords to leave her rue Monsieur apartment — they had raised her rent " exorbitantly " — she decided to leave Paris and buy herself a house in Versailles . 
 = = = Final years = = = 
 Mitford moved to No. 4 rue d 'Artois , Versailles , in January 1967 . The modest house had a half @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 2 hectare ) garden , which soon became one of her chief delights . In 1968 she began work on her final book , a biography of Frederick the Great . While confined at home in March 1969 after a series of illnesses she learned from a newspaper announcement that Palewski had married the Duchesse de Sagan , a rich divorcée . Mitford had long accepted that Palewski would never marry her . Nevertheless , she was deeply hurt by the news , although she affected a typical nonchalance . Shortly after , she entered hospital for the removal of a tumour . After the operation she continued to suffer pain , although she was able to continue working on her book . In October 1969 she undertook a tour of East Germany , to visit former royal palaces and battlefields . She finished the book , but in April 1970 was back in hospital for further tests , which did not lead to either a diagnosis or effective treatment . 
 Frederick the Great was published later in 1970 to a muted reception . Mitford 's remaining years were dominated by her illness , although for a time she enjoyed visits from her sisters and friends , and working in her garden . In April 1972 the French government made her a Chevalier of the Légion d 'Honneur , and later that year the British government appointed her a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) . She was delighted by the former honour , and amused by the latter — which she remembered Waugh had called an " insult " and turned down . At the end of 1972 she entered the Nuffield Clinic in London , where she was diagnosed with Hodgkin 's lymphoma , a cancer of the blood . She lived for another six months , unable to look after herself and in almost constant pain , struggling to keep her spirits up . She wrote to her friend James Lees @-@ Milne : " It 's very curious , dying , and would have many a <unk> amusing & charming side were it not for the pain " . She died on 30 June 1973 at her home in the rue d 'Artois and was cremated in Versailles , after which her ashes were taken to Swinbrook for burial alongside her sister Unity .

 Mitford had no training as a writer or journalist ; her style , particularly in the pre @-@ war novels , is chatty and informal , much as in her letters . She may have inherited some of her natural wit and sharpness of expression from her maternal grandfather Thomas Bowles , who in his youth during the Franco @-@ Prussian War had provided dispatches which Acton describes as " extremely graphic and amusing " . Mitford 's fiction , based on upper @-@ class family life and mores , belongs to the genre of the comedy of manners . Her protagonists — typically , intelligent women surrounded by eccentric characters determined to find life amusing — are broadly autobiographical . It is unsurprising , says Thompson , that Mitford should first attempt to write a novel in the early 1930s , since many of her friends were doing the same thing . What is surprising , Thompson adds , is the ease with which she found a publisher for this first book . Perhaps , says Thompson , her publishers Thornton Butterworth " liked the idea of this pretty , well @-@ connected girl who wrote in the style du jour " . Mitford was later embarrassed by her prewar novels ; Rachel Cooke , writing on their reissue in 2011 , believes she had no reason to be : " There is a special kind of energy here , and its engine is the admirable and irresistible commitment of a writer who would rather die than be boring " . 
 Critics generally place the postwar novels in a different league from the earlier efforts ; Cooke describes The Pursuit of Love as " an immaculate novel that soars many miles above what came before " . In Acton 's view it and its companion volume Love in a Cold Climate present an entirely authentic picture of country house life in England between the wars , and will long be consulted by historians of the period . In these later novels Zoë Heller of the Daily Telegraph hears in the prose , behind a new level of care and <unk> . " the unmistakeable Mitford trill , in whose light , bright cadences an entire hard @-@ to @-@ shock and easy @-@ to @-@ bore view of life is made manifest " . At times a more serious undertone , contrasting with the " bright , brittle , essentially ephemeral " nature of her early works , becomes evident ; Olivia Laing in the Guardian , discerns " a faint and beguiling pessimism about love 's pursuit and its consequences " beneath the light superficiality . 
 The Blessing has provoked a more divided response . Waugh 's judgement was that those who criticised the book were " lazy brutes ... [ who ] ... can 't bear to see a writer grow up " . More recently , Philip Hensher and others have argued that although the novel is immensely enjoyable and that Mitford 's " marvellous voice " is undiminished , she is on less sure ground with her " <unk> " than with the English country house ambience , and her picture of France as the embodiment of everything civilised is less than convincing . Similar mixed comments greeted Mitford 's final novel , Don 't Tell Alfred , Waugh again hailing it as her best , " clamouring for a sequel " . In this judgement he was largely alone ; other critics perceived in the anecdotal framework of the book an uncertainty as to what it was about . An American reviewer wondered what parts were to be taken seriously : " What exactly goes on ? ... Can you always tell an Etonian , even when he goes beat ? Is all modern architecture a fraud ? Do U @-@ people really talk this way ? " Similar questions were raised in the Times Literary Supplement 's review , in relation to Mitford 's fictional output as a whole : " Would she have been a better novelist if she had ' tried harder ' , gone in further , dropped the pose of <unk> , cut the charm , looked beyond the worlds that she knew and , more importantly , loved ? " 
 = = = Biographical works = = = 
 The gift for vivid characterisation , which Mitford developed in her fiction , was used to full effect in her four biographical works . In the first of these , Madame de Pompadour , she followed Waugh 's advice not to write for experts but to fashion " a popular life like Strachey 's Queen Victoria " , with " plenty of period prettiness " . This remained her yardstick in her subsequent biographical writings . Her own description of Voltaire in Love is " a Kinsey report of his romps with Mme de Châtelet and her romps with Saint @-@ Lambert and his romps with Mme de Boufflers ... I could go on for pages " . Acton thought The Sun King the most entertaining introduction to the subject in the English language . Mitford 's informal style was remarked on by the literary critic Cyril Connolly , who wrote that her facility for transforming unpromising source material into readable form was a skill that any professional historian might envy . The historian Antonia Fraser considered Mitford an important contributor to the " remorseless process by which historical and biographical sales have soared since 1950 " . 
 = = = Journalism , letters and other works = = = 
 Mitford did not regard herself as a journalist : nevertheless , her articles were popular , particularly those she contributed on Paris life to The Sunday Times . Thomson describes this series as " a more sophisticated version of A Year in Provence , bringing France to the English in just the way that they most like it " . Thompson adds that although Mitford was always a competent writer , it is in her letters , with their freedom of expression and flights of fancy , that her true character emerges . Many have been published within collections ; they are , according to The Independent 's reviewer : " a delight , full of the sparks of an abrasive and entertaining wit , refreshingly free from politeness " .

 Mitford was a prolific writer of articles , reviews , essays and prefaces , some of which were published in two collections : The Water Beetle ( Hamish Hamilton , 1962 ) and A Talent to <unk> ( Hamish Hamilton , 1986 ) . Her translation of Madame Lafayette 's romantic novel La Princess de <unk> was published in America in 1950 , but was heavily criticised . 
 = Amphicoelias = 
 Amphicoelias ( / <unk> / , meaning " <unk> " , from the Greek <unk> , <unk> : " on both sides " , and κοιλος , koilos : " hollow , concave " ) is a genus of herbivorous sauropod dinosaur that is probably synonymous with the genus Diplodocus . It includes what has sometimes been estimated to be the largest dinosaur specimen ever discovered , originally named " A. fragillimus " . Based on surviving descriptions of a single fossil bone , scientists had over the years estimated A. fragillimus to have been the longest known animal at 58 metres ( 190 ft ) in length , with potentially a mass of up to 122 @.@ 4 tonnes ( 135 short tons ) . However , because the only fossil remains were lost at some point after being studied and described in the 1870s , evidence survived only in drawings and field notes . More recent analysis of the surviving evidence , and the biological plausibility of such a large land animal , has suggested that the enormous size of this animal were over @-@ estimates due partly to typographical errors in the original 1878 description . 
 = = Description = = 
 The type species of Amphicoelias , A. altus , was named by paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in December 1877 ( though not published until 1878 ) for an incomplete skeleton consisting of two vertebrae , a pubis ( hip bone ) , and a femur ( upper leg bone ) . Cope also named a second species , A. fragillimus , in the same paper . However , all subsequent researchers have considered A. fragillimus to be a synonym of A. altus . Even by 1881 however , it was recognized that A. altus could not be distinguished from other genera , as the features described by Cope were misinterpreted and are widespread . In 1921 , Osborn and Mook assigned additional bones to A. altus — a scapula ( shoulder blade ) , a coracoid ( shoulder bone ) , an ulna ( lower arm bone ) , and a tooth . Henry Fairfield Osborn and Charles Craig Mook noted the overall close similarity between Amphicoelias and Diplodocus , as well as a few key differences , such as proportionally longer forelimbs in Amphicoelias than in Diplodocus . The dentition of Amphicoelias is <unk> . Its teeth are shaped like long slender cylindrical rods , are spaced apart and project forward towards the front of the mouth . The femur of Amphicoelias is unusually long , slender , and round in cross section ; while this roundness was once thought to be another distinguishing characteristic of Amphicoelias , it has since been found in some specimens of Diplodocus as well . A. altus was also similar in size to Diplodocus , estimated to be about 25 m ( 82 ft ) long . While most scientists have used these details to distinguish Amphicoelias and Diplodocus as separate genera , at least one has suggested that Amphicoelias is probably the senior synonym of Diplodocus . 
 = = History = = 
 Amphicoelias fragillimus was collected by <unk> Lucas , a fossil collector employed by E. D. Cope , shortly after he was hired by Cope in 1877 . Lucas discovered a partial vertebra ( the neural arch and spine ) of the new sauropod species in Garden Park , north of Cañon City , Colorado , close to the quarry that yielded Camarasaurus . The vertebra was in poor condition , but astonishingly large , measuring 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) up to 2 @.@ 7 metres ( 8 @.@ 9 ft ) in height . Lucas shipped the specimen to Cope in the spring or early summer of 1878 , and Cope published it as the holotype specimen ( catalogue number AMNH 5777 ) of a new species , A. fragillimus , that August . The name derives from the Latin fragillimus ( " very fragile " ) , referring to the delicateness of the bone produced by very thin laminae ( vertebral walls ) . As revealed in Cope 's notebooks , which he recorded based on Lucas ' report on excavation site locations in 1879 , the specimen came from a hill south of the Camarasaurus quarry now known as " Cope 's Nipple . " While Cope originally wrote that the site belonged to the Dakota Formation ( mid @-@ Cretaceous in age ) , the presence of dinosaurs such as Camarasaurus in the same rocks indicates that they probably belong to the Morrison Formation , which places the age of the site at 150 million years ago in the late Jurassic period , specifically the Tithonian age . 
 The gigantic bones attributed to A. fragillimus have often been ignored in summaries of the largest dinosaurs partly because , according to various subsequent reports , the whereabouts of both the vertebra and the femur are unknown , and all attempts to locate them have failed . Carpenter , in 2006 , presented a possible scenario for the disappearance of the A. fragillimus specimens . As Cope noted in his description , the neural arch bone material was very fragile , and techniques to harden and preserve fossil bone had not yet been invented ( Cope 's rival , paleontologist O.C. Marsh , was the first to use such chemicals , in the early 1880s ) . Carpenter observed that the fossil bones known from the A. fragillimus quarry would have been preserved in deeply weathered mudstone , which tends to crumble easily and fragment into small , irregular cubes . Therefore , the bone may have crumbled badly and been discarded by someone at the American Museum of Natural History ( possibly even by Cope himself ) soon after he illustrated it in rear view for his paper . Carpenter suggested that this may explain why Cope drew the vertebra in only one view , rather than from multiple angles as he did for his other discoveries . 
 In 1994 , an attempt was made to relocate the original quarry where A. fragillimus and other species had been found , using ground @-@ penetrating radar in an attempt to image bones still buried in the ground . This attempt failed because the fossilized mudstone bones were the same density as the surrounding rock , making it impossible to differentiate the two . A study of the local topography also showed that the fossil @-@ bearing rock strata was severely eroded , and probably was so at the time Lucas made his discovery of A. fragillimus , indicating that a majority of the skeleton was gone by the time the vertebra and femur were recovered . 
 Cope 's description of A. fragillimus has been met with skepticism , with some researchers noting that there were typographical errors in his measurements . For example , the measurement units are given in ( obviously incorrect ) centimeters rather than millimeters . Carpenter argued that there is every reason to take Cope at his word , noting that the paleontologist 's reputation was at stake . The discovery took place during the Bone Wars , and Cope 's rival Marsh , who was " ever ready to humiliate " Cope , never called the claims into question . Marsh was known to have employed spies to monitor Cope 's discoveries , and may have even had confirmation of the enormous size of the Amphicoelias fragillimus bones . Paleontologists Henry Fairfield Osborn and C.C. Mook in 1921 , as well as John S. McIntosh in 1998 , also accepted Cope 's data without question in published reviews . In 2015 , Woodruff and Foster published an analysis of the evidence and circumstances surrounding the publication and interpretation of A. fragillimus . 
 = = Size = = 
 Producing an estimate of the complete size of A. fragillimus requires scaling the bones of better @-@ known species of diplodocid ( a family of extremely long and slender sauropods ) in the assumption that their relative proportions were similar . In his original paper , Cope did this by speculating on the size of a hypothetical A. fragillimus femur ( upper leg bone ) . Cope noticed that in other sauropod dinosaurs , specifically A. altus and Camarasaurus supremus , the femora were always twice as tall as the tallest dorsal vertebra , and estimated the size of an A. fragillimus femur to be 12 ft ( 3 @.@ 6 m ) tall . 
 In 1994 , using the related Diplodocus as a reference , Gregory S. Paul estimated a femur length of 3 @.@ 1 to 4 metres ( 10 to 13 ft ) for A. fragillimus . The 2006 re @-@ evaluation of A. fragillimus by Ken Carpenter also used Diplodocus as a scale guide , finding a femur height of 4 @.@ 3 to 4 @.@ 6 metres ( 14 to 15 ft ) . Carpenter went on to estimate the complete size of A. fragillimus , though he cautioned that relative proportions in diplodocids could vary from species to species . Assuming the same proportions as the well @-@ known Diplodocus , Carpenter presented an estimated total length of 58 m ( 190 ft ) , which he noted fell within the range presented by Paul in 1994 ( 40 to 60 metres ( 130 to 200 ft ) ) . Carpenter pointed out that even the lowest length estimates for A. fragillimus were higher than those for other giant sauropods , such as the diplodocid Supersaurus ( 32 @.@ 5 metres ( 107 ft ) ) , the brachiosaurid Sauroposeidon ( 34 metres ( 112 ft ) ) , and the titanosaur Argentinosaurus ( 30 metres ( 98 ft ) ) . Carpenter presented more speculative , specific proportions for A. fragillimus ( again , based on a scaled @-@ up Diplodocus ) , including a neck length of 16 @.@ 75 metres ( 55 @.@ 0 ft ) , a body length of 9 @.@ 25 metres ( 30 @.@ 3 ft ) , and a tail length of 32 metres ( 105 ft ) . He estimated the total forelimb height at 5 @.@ 75 metres ( 18 @.@ 9 ft ) and hind limb height at 7 @.@ 5 metres ( 25 ft ) , and the overall height ( at the highest point on the back ) at 9 @.@ 25 metres ( 30 @.@ 3 ft ) . By comparison the blue whale , which is on average the longest living creature , reaches 30 metres ( 98 ft ) in length . 
 While A. fragillimus was relatively thin , its enormous size still made it very massive . Weight is much more difficult to determine than length in sauropods , as the more complex equations needed are prone to greater margins of error based on smaller variations in the overall proportions of the animal . Carpenter used Paul 's 1994 estimate of the mass of Diplodocus carnegii ( 11 @.@ 5 metric tons ( 11 @.@ 3 long tons ; 12 @.@ 7 short tons ) ) to speculate that A. fragillimus could have weighed up to 122 @.@ 4 metric tons ( 120 @.@ 5 long tons ; 134 @.@ 9 short tons ) . The heaviest blue whale on record weighed about 190 metric tons ( 190 long tons ; 210 short tons ) , and the heaviest dinosaur known from reasonably good remains , Argentinosaurus , weighed 80 to 100 metric tons ( 79 to 98 long tons ; 88 to 110 short tons ) , although if the size estimates can be validated , it could still be lighter than <unk> , which has been estimated to have weighed 126 metric tons ( 124 long tons ; 139 short tons ) , but is also known from highly fragmentary remains . 
 Other unpublished estimates have appeared online . A <unk> on DeviantArt estimated the length of A. fragillimus to be around 73 m ( 240 ft ) , based on a linear scaling of a 26 @.@ 25 meter long , 11 @.@ 5 tonne Diplodocus , assuming that A fragillimus was 2 @.@ 79 times larger in linear dimension . In 2010 , Mike Taylor addressed the issue of A. fragillimus 's size on the blog SV @-@ POW ( Sauropod Vertebrae Picture of the Week ) . Based on comparisons to A. altus and to Diplodocus , he estimated that it may have been around 49 m ( 161 ft ) long and 78 @.@ 5 tonnes . However , he concluded with the disclaimer that it is impossible to determine with any degree of certainty at all how large A. fragillimus was in reality because of the lack of accurate information . 
 = = Classification and species = = 
 Edward Drinker Cope described his finds in two 1878 issues of the American Naturalist , and assigned them to the new genus Amphicoelias . He placed it in a unique family , <unk> , though this is now considered a nomen oblitum ( forgotten name ) . The genus is usually assigned to the family Diplodocidae , though some modern analyses have found it at the base of the larger group Diplodocoidea or as a diplodocid incertae sedis ( uncertain placement ) . The first named species in the genus , Amphicoelias altus ( holotype specimen <unk> <unk> ) , was discovered by Cope in 1877 . But while it is only represented by a partial skeleton , there are enough diagnostic characteristics to provisionally define the genus . A. altus is known from better remains , but is smaller than A. fragillimus . Cope also named a second species in 1878 : Amphicoelias latus . 
 The third named Amphicoelias species , A. fragillimus , was known only from a single , incomplete 1 @.@ 5 m tall neural arch ( the part of a vertebra with spines and processes ) , either last or second to last in the series of back vertebrae , D ( dorsal ) 10 or D9 . Based only on an illustration published in 1878 , this vertebra would have measured 2 @.@ 7 metres ( 8 @.@ 9 ft ) tall in life . However , it has been argued that the scale bar in the published description contained a typographical error , and the fossil vertebra was in fact only 1 @.@ 38 metres ( 4 @.@ 5 ft ) tall . In addition to this vertebra , Cope 's field notes contain an entry for an " [ i ] <unk> distal end of femur ” , located only a few tens of meters away from the giant vertebra . It is likely that this undescribed leg bone belonged to the same individual animal as the neural spine . 
 In 2010 , a monograph was made available , but not formally published , by Henry Galiano and Raimund <unk> in which they referred a fourth species to Amphicoelias , as " A. <unk> " based on several complete specimens found in the Dana Quarry of Big Horn Basin , Wyoming and held in a private collection . The specific name referred to their hypothesis based on these specimens that nearly all Morrison diplodocid species are either growth stages or represent sexual dimorphism among members of the genus Amphicoelias , but this analysis has been met with skepticism and the publication itself has been disclaimed by its lead author , explaining that it is " obviously a drafted manuscript complete with typos , etc . , and not a final paper . In fact , no printing or distribution has been attempted " . 
 Osborn and Mook , in 1921 , provisionally synonymized the three species , sinking A. latus into Camarasaurus supremus , and suggesting also that A. fragillimus is just a very large individual of A. altus , a position which most subsequent studies , including McIntosh 1998 , Foster ( 2007 ) , and Woodruff and Foster ( 2015 ) have agreed with . Carpenter ( 2006 ) disagreed about the synonymy of A. altus and A. fragillimus , however , citing numerous differences in the construction of the vertebra also noted by Cope , and suggested these differences are enough to warrant a separate species or even a separate genus for A. fragillimus . However , he went on to caution that the validity of A. fragillimus as a separate species is nearly impossible to determine without the original specimen to study . Although Amphicoelias latus is clearly not Amphicoelias , it is probably synonymous with Camarasaurus grandis rather than C. supremus because it was found lower in the Morrison Formation and the deeply concave articular faces on the caudal vertebrae are more consistent with C. grandis . 
 In 2007 , John Foster suggested that the differences usually cited to differentiate Amphicoelias altus from the more well known Diplodocus are not significant and may be due to individual variation . Foster argued that Amphicoelias is probably the senior synonym of Diplodocus , and that if further research bears this out , the familiar name Diplodocus would need to be abandoned in favor of Amphicoelias , as was the case with Brontosaurus and its senior synonym Apatosaurus . In 2015 , Woodruff and Foster reiterated this conclusion , stating that there is only one species of Amphicoelias and that it could be referred to Diplodocus as Diplodocus altus . They considered the name Amphicoelias to be a nomen oblitum . It has also been hypothesized that Amphicoelias should be considered an <unk> , and therefore should be placed in the subfamily Apatosaurinae . 
 The following cladogram of the Diplodocidae after Tschopp , Mateus , and Benson ( 2015 ) instead shows A. altus outside Diplodocinae . 
 = = Paleobiology = = 
 In his 2006 re @-@ evaluation , Carpenter examined the paleobiology of giant sauropods , including Amphicoelias , and addresses the question of why this group attained such a huge size . He pointed out that gigantic sizes were reached early in sauropod evolution , with very large sized species present as early as the late Triassic Period , and concluded that whatever evolutionary pressure caused large size was present from the early origins of the group . Carpenter cited several studies of giant mammalian herbivores , such as elephants and rhinoceros , which showed that larger size in plant @-@ eating animals leads to greater efficiency in digesting food . Since larger animals have longer digestive systems , food is kept in digestion for significantly longer periods of time , allowing large animals to survive on lower @-@ quality food sources . This is especially true of animals with a large number of ' fermentation chambers ' along the intestine which allow microbes to accumulate and ferment plant material , aiding digestion . Throughout their evolutionary history , sauropod dinosaurs were found primarily in semi @-@ arid , seasonally dry environments , with a corresponding seasonal drop in the quality of food during the dry season . The environment of Amphicoelias was essentially a savanna , similar to the arid environments in which modern giant herbivores are found , supporting the idea that poor @-@ quality food in an arid environment promotes the evolution of giant herbivores . Carpenter argued that other benefits of large size , such as relative immunity from predators , lower energy expenditure , and longer life span , are probably secondary advantages . 
 The Morrison Formation environment in which Amphicoelias lived would have resembled a modern savanna , though since grass did not appear until the Late Cretaceous , ferns were probably the dominant plant and main food source for Amphicoelias . Though Engelmann et al . ( 2004 ) dismissed ferns as a sauropod food source due to their relatively low caloric content , Carpenter argued that the sauropod digestive system , well adapted to handle low @-@ quality food , allows for the consumption of ferns as a large part of the sauropod diet . Carpenter also noted that the occasional presence of large petrified logs indicate the presence of 20 – 30 m ( 66 – 98 ft ) tall trees , which would seem to conflict with the savanna comparison . However , the trees are rare , and since tall trees require more water than the savanna environment could generally provide , they probably existed in narrow tracts or " gallery forests " along rivers and gulleys where water could accumulate . Carpenter speculated that giant herbivores like Amphicoelias may have used the shade of the gallery forests to stay cool during the day , and done most of their feeding on the open savanna at night . 
 = Kesha = 
 Kesha Rose Sebert ( born March 1 , 1987 ) ( formerly stylized as Ke $ ha ) is an American singer , songwriter , and rapper . In 2005 , at age 18 , Kesha was signed to producer Dr. Luke 's label Kemosabe Records . Her breakthrough came in early 2009 after appearing on American rapper Flo Rida 's number @-@ one single " Right Round " . Her debut album , Animal , and her first extended play , Cannibal , were released in 2010 . Kesha 's music and image propelled her to immediate commercial success , with Animal debuting as the number @-@ one album in the United States . She also achieved two number @-@ one singles , " Tik Tok " and " We R Who We R " , and a string of top @-@ ten singles from the album and its re @-@ release . At the same time , she continued to write songs for other artists , including " Till the World Ends " for Britney Spears . Warrior , her second studio album , was released in December 2012 , spawning Kesha 's eighth top @-@ ten single with " Die Young " , and her ninth and tenth Top 40 hits with " C 'Mon " and " Crazy Kids " . " Tik Tok " is among the best @-@ selling digital singles in history , selling over 14 million units internationally . 
 Influenced by various genres and artists , Kesha primarily draws inspiration from music of the 1980s ; Madonna , Queen , and Beck have been cited as instrumental to her music . After experimenting with country , pop rock , and electronic music , Kesha stuck with the latter . Thematically , her music generally revolves around escapism , partying , individuality , supernatural moments , rebellion , and grief . Kesha has been involved with animal rights and LGBT activism . She has received several awards and nominations , including her win for MTV Europe Music Award for Best New Act in 2010 . As of November 2013 , she has reportedly sold over 33 million records ( albums , tracks , and ringtones ) in the United States and 60 million records worldwide . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Kesha was born in Los Angeles , California . Her mother , Patricia Rose " Pebe " Sebert , is a singer @-@ songwriter who co @-@ wrote the 1978 single " Old Flames Can 't Hold a Candle to You " with Hugh Moffatt for Joe Sun , made popular by country music artist Dolly Parton on her 1980 album Dolly , Dolly , Dolly . Pebe , a single mother , struggled financially while supporting herself , Kesha , and Kesha 's older brother Lagan ; they relied on welfare payments and food stamps to get by . When Kesha was an infant , Pebe would often have to look after her onstage while performing . Kesha says she has no knowledge of her father 's identity . However , a man named Bob Chamberlain who called himself her father approached Star magazine in 2011 with pictures and letters , claiming them as proof that they had been in regular contact as father and daughter before she turned 19 . Her mother is of German and Hungarian ( from <unk> ) descent . One of Kesha 's great @-@ grandfathers was Polish . 
 Pebe moved the family to Nashville , Tennessee , in 1991 after securing a new publishing deal for her songwriting . Pebe frequently brought Kesha and her brothers along to recording studios and encouraged Kesha to sing when she noticed Kesha 's vocal talent . Kesha attended Franklin High School and Brentwood High School , but claimed that she did not fit in , explaining that her unconventional style ( e.g. , homemade purple velvet pants and purple hair ) did not endear her to other students . She played the trumpet and later the saxophone in the marching band in school , and described herself in an interview with NPR as being a diligent student . After attaining a near @-@ perfect score on her SATs , she was offered a full scholarship at Barnard College , but instead chose to drop out before graduation to pursue her music career . 
 In addition to taking songwriting classes , Kesha was also taught how to write songs by Pebe , and they would often write together when she returned home from high school . Kesha began recording demos which Pebe would give to people she knew . Kesha was also in a band with Lagan . Kesha and Pebe co @-@ wrote the song " Stephen " together when Kesha was 16 , Kesha then tracked down David Gamson , a producer that she admired , from Scritti Politti who agreed to produce the song . She dropped out of school at 17 , after being convinced by Dr. Luke and Max Martin to return to Los Angeles to pursue a music career , and earned her GED after . Around this time , Pebe answered an ad by reality series The Simple Life , looking for an " eccentric " family to host Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie . The episode aired in 2005 . Luke and Martin had received one of Kesha 's demos from Samantha Cox , senior director of writer / publisher relations at Broadcast Music Incorporated , and were impressed . Two of the demos were described in a cover story for Billboard , the first " a gorgeously sung , self @-@ penned country ballad " and the second " a <unk> awful trip @-@ hop track " where Kesha raps ad lib for a minute when she runs out of lyrics near the end . Dr. Luke stated in an interview for the story that it was the latter track that caught his attention , saying " when you 're listening to 100 CDs , that kind of bravado and chutzpah stand out . "

 In 2005 , at 18 , Kesha was signed to Dr. Luke 's label , Kemosabe Entertainment , and his music publishing company , Prescription Songs . Kemosabe Records is owned by Sony Music Entertainment and is located in Los Angeles , California . Sony Music Entertainment partnered with Dr. Luke to create Kemosabe Records . Some artists that have signed with Kemosabe Records are Juicy J , Rock City , Zara Larsson , Lil Bibby and many others . Kesha later sang background vocals for Paris Hilton 's single , " Nothing in This World " . Dr. Luke became preoccupied with other incoming projects , having enjoyed success writing and producing for pop star Kelly Clarkson 's album , Breakaway . Kesha then signed with David Sonenberg 's management company , DAS Communications Inc . , in 2006 , hardly interacting with Dr. Luke after that . DAS was tasked with obtaining a major label record deal for Kesha in a year 's time in exchange for 20 percent of her music income , with her having the option of ending the relationship if they failed . She worked with several writers and producers while at the company and ended up co @-@ writing Australian pop group The Veronicas ' single , " This Love " with producer Toby Gad . While furthering her career in studio , Kesha earned her living as a waitress . While struggling to get by , she began <unk> her name as Ke $ ha , explaining the dollar sign as an ironic gesture . 
 Kesha appeared in the video for her friend Katy Perry 's single " I Kissed a Girl " , and sang background vocals for the Dr. Luke @-@ produced song , " Lace and Leather " by Britney Spears in 2008 . DAS soon attracted the attention of songwriter and A & R Kara DioGuardi , who wanted to sign Kesha to Warner Bros. Records . The deal fell through due to her existing contract with Dr. Luke 's label . In September , she terminated her contract with DAS , reuniting with Dr. Luke . Kesha gained exposure in the mainstream media in early 2009 after appearing on rapper Flo Rida 's number one single , " Right Round " . The collaboration happened by accident ; she had walked into a recording session for the song with Flo Rida and Dr. Luke . Flo Rida wanted a female voice for the song ; Dr. Luke then suggested Kesha for the part . Flo Rida liked the end result so much that they did two more tracks . However , she is not credited for her feature on the United States release of " Right Round " and did not collect any money for the part . She also refused to appear in the video , explaining to men 's magazine Esquire that she wanted to make a name for herself on her own terms .

 After failing to negotiate with Lava Records and Atlantic Records in 2009 , Kesha signed a multi @-@ album deal with RCA Records through Dr. Luke 's imprint . Having spent the previous six years working on material for her debut album , she began putting finishing touches to the album with Luke and Max Martin . For the album , she wrote 200 songs . The album was executive produced by Luke , who produced the majority of the songs with Martin , and producers Benny Blanco and Ammo . The album is primarily of the electropop genre with beats and synths , marking a shift in sound for Luke from then on from his signature pop @-@ rock productions . Animal debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 when it was released in January 2010 . It was certified platinum in the United States and had sold two million albums worldwide by September . The lead single of the album , " Tik Tok " , broke the record in the United States for the highest single week sales , selling 610 @,@ 000 digital downloads , the highest ever by a female artist since tracking began in 2003 . It spent nine weeks at number one and became the longest running number one by a female artist on her debut single since Debby Boone and " You Light Up My Life " in 1977 . As of 2015 , " Tik Tok " has sold about 15 million copies , becoming the second best @-@ selling single in the digital history – being the most sold single in history by a female solo artist . Subsequent singles from the album , " Blah Blah Blah " , " Your Love Is My Drug " and " Take It Off " achieved similar commercial success each reaching the top ten in Australia , Canada , and the United States . Kesha was also featured on two top ten singles by musician Taio Cruz and electro @-@ pop duo 3OH ! 3 . 
 Kesha 's deliberately unpolished aesthetic and juvenile stage persona , which she described as her own personality " times ten " , quickly made her a deeply polarizing figure . Some of her critics found her output to be unsophisticated , while others felt that she was manufactured and lacked credibility . Kesha 's former managers from DAS Communications Inc. filed a lawsuit later that month , seeking $ 14 million from Kesha and $ 12 million from Luke for commissions on her RCA Records deal , alleging that she had extended the deadline for them to get her a major record label contract and squeezed them out of her career under pressure from Dr. Luke . Kesha launched her own lawsuit in October , citing the California @-@ exclusive Talent Agencies Act and asking the California Labor Commissioner to declare her contract with DAS void because it had acted as an unlicensed talent agent while procuring work for her in California , where only licensed agents can do so . The case was settled in 2012 before the release of her second album . Kesha held a benefit concert on June 16 , 2010 where all proceeds went to aid victims of the May 2010 Tennessee floods from her hometown Nashville . She raised close to $ 70 @,@ 000 from the event . She was a supporting act on the summer North American leg of Rihanna 's Last Girl on Earth Tour and was awarded Best New Act at the 2010 MTV Europe Music Awards . In November 2010 , Animal was re @-@ released with a companion extended play , Cannibal . The lead single taken from Cannibal , " We R Who We R " debuted at the top of the Billboard Hot 100 . With two number ones and four top ten hits , Kesha was named Hot 100 Artist of 2010 by Billboard , with " Tik Tok " topping the year @-@ end chart . The follow @-@ up single from Cannibal , " Blow " charted in the top ten on the Hot 100 . As of June 2011 , she has accumulated almost 21 million digital single downloads in the United States alone . In February 2011 , Kesha embarked on her first headlining world tour , Get Sleazy . The tour was expanded with a summer leg due to the first leg selling out and spanned three continents . Kesha also co @-@ wrote the song " Till the World Ends " for American popstar Britney Spears and she was featured on the remix of the song along with rapper Nicki Minaj . After meeting Kesha at the 2010 Grammy Awards and guesting at a number of her concerts , rock singer Alice Cooper asked her to write lyrics for and vocally perform as a devil character for their duet track , " What Baby Wants " , on Cooper 's album , Welcome 2 My Nightmare . 
 Kesha was named rights group Humane Society of the United States 's first global ambassador for animal rights , for which she is expected to bring attention to such practices as cosmetics testing on animals and shark finning . Kesha received the Wyler Award presented by The Humane Society as a celebrity or public figure who increases awareness of animal issues via the media . She received the award March 23 , 2013 at The 2013 Genesis Awards Benefit Gala . She also appeared alongside rock singer Iggy Pop in a campaign for PETA , protesting the clubbing of baby seals in Canada and later wrote on behalf of the organization to fast food chain McDonald 's over the conditions of their slaughterhouses .

 Kesha 's second studio album , Warrior was released on November 30 , 2012 . She began writing for the album while on her own headlining tour in 2011 . The album featured productions from her main collaborators Dr. Luke and Max Martin , as well as a song by Wayne Coyne , the lead singer of the alternative band The Flaming Lips . Coyne had reached out to Kesha for a collaboration after hearing that she was a fan of the band . Besides working on Kesha 's album , they recorded the song " 2012 ( You Must Be Upgraded ) " for the band 's album , The Flaming Lips and Heady <unk> . To coincide with the release of the album , Kesha released an illustrated autobiography , My Crazy Beautiful Life through Touchstone Books in November 2012 . The first single taken from Warrior was " Die Young " . The song debuted at number thirteen on Billboard Hot 100 and eventually peaked at number 2 . The song also charted across Europe and the Anglosphere and reached the top ten in Australia , Canada , and Belgium . " C 'Mon " , the album 's second single , underperformed commercially ; only peaking at 27 on Billboard Hot 100 and ending her string of top ten hits on the chart . Despite this , " C 'Mon " continued Kesha 's streak of top ten hits ( with nine ) on the Mainstream Top 40 Pop Songs chart graphed by Billboard . In March 2013 , Kesha announced the Warrior Tour , which will support the album . The North American leg was co @-@ headlined with rapper Pitbull . Kesha 's third single from Warrior , " Crazy Kids " , was released in April 2013 and also under @-@ performed , peaking at number 40 on the Hot 100 , number 19 on Mainstream Top 40 , yet did achieve massive success in South Korea and Belgium peaking at numbers 2 , and 5 in those countries respectively . A TV series documentary , Kesha : My Crazy Beautiful Life began airing on MTV in April 2013 . 
 In July 2013 , The Flaming Lips announced that they hoped to release a full @-@ length collaborative album with Kesha , called <unk> , although it was eventually cancelled in the winter of the same year . Kesha sent a message to a fan expressing how it was out of her control and that she wanted to release the material , even for free , saying that she did not care about the money . On October 7 , 2013 , Kesha and Pitbull released a collaboration , " Timber " , produced by Luke , which was an international commercial success and became Kesha 's third number @-@ one and her eleventh top 10 single on the Hot 100 chart .

 In January 2014 , Kesha checked into rehab , following this she chose to use her birth name in favor of her previous moniker , using a normal " s " instead of the symbol " $ " . In June 2014 , Kesha claimed a seat as an Expert in ABC 's Rising Star alongside Brad Paisley and Ludacris . 
 In October 2014 , Kesha sued producer Dr. Luke for alleged sexual assault and battery , sexual harassment , gender violence , emotional abuse , and violation of California business practices which had occurred over 10 years working together . The lawsuit went on for about a year before Kesha sought a preliminary injunction to release her from Kemosabe Records . On February 19 , 2016 , New York Supreme Court Justice Shirley <unk> ruled against Kesha 's request . On April 6 , 2016 , Judge Shirley <unk> rejected all of Kesha 's claims against Dr Luke . 
 On June 13 , 2015 , Kesha headlined LA ! Pride 2015 Presented by Christopher Street West in West Hollywood , California . On August 4 , 2015 , Kesha signed with SESAC Inc . Kesha guest starred in the second season of the U.S. television series Jane the Virgin , which aired on October 12 , 2015 . The singer played Annabelle , Jane 's hostile neighbor . As of August 2015 , Kesha has released little information about her upcoming third studio album . In her August 2014 Teen Vogue cover interview , Kesha revealed she had recorded 14 new songs while in rehab . On November 2 , 2014 , a new song written by Kesha titled " Lover " , reportedly from Kesha 's upcoming third studio album , was uploaded to <unk> ' SoundCloud , who produced the track alongside <unk> Ruben . The track was later included on Ruben 's album " Welsh <unk> " . On June 10 , 2015 , Kesha posted a photo to Instagram that supposedly teased the title of her upcoming single " Child of the Moon " , but the photo has since been removed . Kesha also spoke about the song in her Teen Vogue interview , saying that it had a " Stevie Nicks @-@ witchy vibe " . In December 2015 , Kesha revealed that she had formed a country music and classic rock @-@ influenced band called Yeast Infection and performed a live show with the band in Nashville on December 23 . 
 Kesha appeared during Zedd 's slot at the 2016 Coachella festival to perform " True Colors " , a track from Zedd 's second studio album . The cameo marked her first high profile public performance since her ongoing legal battle with Dr. Luke . A studio version of the collaboration was released as a single on April 29 , 2016 . Kesha covered Bob Dylan 's song " It Ain 't Me Babe " at the 2016 Billboard Music Awards .

 = = = Musical style and image = = = 
 Kesha wrote or co @-@ wrote every song on her first two albums and considers herself a songwriter primarily , writing for artists including Britney Spears and Miley Cyrus . She possesses a " strong , sneering vibrato " , with a distinct yodel @-@ like quality to her voice ; she employs actual yodeling on the songs , " Tik Tok " and " Cannibal " . Having previously done country , pop rock , and electro , she had a clear idea of the synthpop sound that she wanted for her debut album . The genre was popular at the time , with many of her peers releasing similar output as well . Both of her albums are of the genre with catchy hooks and synthesized productions often compared to pop singer Dev by music critics , creating misunderstandings among the fans of the two . " Party at a Rich Dude 's House " and " C U Next Tuesday " have 1980s derived backing , while " Stephen " begins with " Kansas @-@ style vocal harmonies " . With the lyrics , " Oh my Nicolas Cage , you 're so old / you 're prehistoric / you 're like a dinosaur / D @-@ I @-@ N @-@ O @-@ S @-@ A @-@ you are a dinosaur " , " Dinosaur " follows a verse @-@ chorus formula , reminiscent of " Girlfriend " ( 2007 ) by Avril Lavigne and " Hollaback Girl " ( 2005 ) by Gwen Stefani ; the song uses the overt symbolism of dinosaurs , carnivory , and other primitive motifs to tell the story of an older man who preys on younger women . According to Kesha , the song is based on true events . While her vocals on Animal were heavily processed with auto @-@ tune , often to produce rapid stuttering or over @-@ pitch corrected vocal effects , leading to questions on vocal talent , she expressed confidence in her abilities , showing some of her vocal talent in the ballads " Animal " and " <unk> " on the album . 
 Kesha 's second studio album Warrior used considerably less autotune , although it still showed in a number of songs . The album 's piano and guitar @-@ driven ballads such as " Love Into The Light " , " Wonderland " and " Past Lives " display Kesha 's vocal ability . Kesha also uses a trademark talky " white @-@ girl " rapping style with exaggerated discordant phrasing and enunciation . Her vocal technique has led her to be credited as a rapper , a topic she disagreed with until fellow rappers André 3000 , Wiz Khalifa , and Snoop Dogg endorsed her . On the subject , she said : " The first time someone called me a rapper , I started laughing . I was shocked , and thought it was hilarious . It 's crazy and funny to me . " The New York Times said Kesha " threatens to become the most influential female rapper of the day , or at least the most popular . Pretending Kesha isn 't a rapper is no longer feasible . " " Crazy Kids " and " C 'Mon " took greater shifts into " party rap " . Most of her lyrics chronicle her relationships and partying ; the lighthearted subject matter of the latter and her unfiltered language saw many critics criticizing her for releasing frivolous and crass music . Jonah Weiner of Slate , however , stated that her jarring lyrics allowed her songs to become more memorable . In " Blah Blah Blah " and " Boots & Boys " , she objectifies men to poke fun at how male fronted rock bands and rappers can get away with objectifying women and not vice versa . The title track to her debut , " Animal " , is more aspirational and is intended to inspire people to embrace their individuality . Much more experimental than Animal , her second album , Warrior , contains dubstep elements and explores erotic experiences Kesha encountered with ghosts on the song , " Supernatural " . Overall , Kesha said the theme of Warrior is magic . 
 Critics praised Warrior for its rock music influences , despite the album being deeply rooted in technopop . Applauding the album 's rock sound , Rolling Stone called the album Kesha 's rock manifesto . Rock icons The Flaming Lips , Iggy Pop , and Alice Cooper have collaborated with Kesha , endorsing her as a rock singer . Cooper told Billboard , " I immediately looked at her and went , ' This girl is not a pop diva . She 's a rock singer . ' She would much rather be the female Robert Plant than the next Britney Spears . " The A.V. Club noted that Warrior proved Kesha a capable vocalist and songwriter . The Washington Post said that the album the is " pure fun " , acknowledging her proneness for finding good hooks despite her sometimes vapid lyricism . 
 = = = Influences = = = 
 Kesha 's musical influences consist of hip hop , punk rock , <unk> , glam rock , 1980s pop , dance music and classic country . Her country influences of Dolly Parton and Johnny Cash come from her mother 's country songwriting , while her older brother exposed her to hip @-@ hop and punk bands , Fugazi , Dinosaur Jr. and the Beastie Boys . She has additionally cited Beck , Queen , David Bowie , Led Zeppelin , Madonna , Elton John , Aaron Neville , Britney Spears , Bob Dylan , The Damned , The Velvet Underground , Blondie and graffiti artist Banksy as influences . She credits her straightforward story @-@ based lyrics to her love for the honest storytelling style of country music , while the title track from her debut album was created with music from alternative rock bands The Flaming Lips and Arcade Fire in mind . She singled out the Beastie Boys as a major influence , telling Newsweek that she had always wanted to be like them and aspired to make " youthful , irreverent anthems " as well . She called her debut album , Animal , an homage to the Beastie Boys ' Licensed to Ill and credited the creation of the rap driven " Tik Tok " to her love for the Beastie Boys ' rap music . For her first headlining tour , Kesha wanted to emulate the stage theatrics of Iggy Pop 's performances . She listed Pop 's The Idiot as well as Led Zeppelin and AC / DC as inspirations for her second studio album , Warrior , intended to feature 1970s rock inspired music . Warrior , to this effect , includes a collaboration with Pop himself . 
 She draws inspiration from classic films as well . Her stage makeup is characterized by dramatic glitter makeup at her right eye , inspired by A Clockwork Orange . The video for " Your Love is My Drug " features animated sequences inspired by the The Beatles ' film , Yellow Submarine , while the Get Sleazy tour was described as having a " post @-@ apocalyptic Mad Max vibe . "

 Kesha is a vegetarian and an ordained minister , having been ordained online . She also has performed legal commitment ceremonies for both gay and heterosexual couples . She talked about her sexual orientation with Seventeen magazine in 2013 , " I don 't love just men . I love people . It 's not about a gender . " She made a similar statement to Out magazine in 2010 , when she confessed to simply " liking people " : " I wouldn ’ t say I ’ m gay or straight . I don ’ t like labeling things anyway . " 
 On January 3 , 2014 , Kesha checked into Timberline Knolls Residential Treatment Center , the rehab facility in Lemont , Illinois , for eating disorder treatment . Kesha 's mother Pebe Sebert confirmed that the eating disorder Kesha was suffering with is bulimia nervosa and that she had been struggling with it since she was signed . She also alleged that Dr. Luke was partly the cause of Kesha 's eating disorder , saying that Luke had allegedly told her to lose weight after he signed her , comparing the shape of her body to a refrigerator . Sebert asserted that this had caused Kesha 's disorder to worsen . Kesha had completed her treatment on March 6 , 2014 , after spending two months in rehab .

 " The Devil Wears Nada " is the fifth episode of the twenty @-@ first season of The Simpsons . It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 15 , 2009 . In the episode , Marge and a group called the " Charity Chicks " pose for a history @-@ oriented calendar in hopes of raising money for charity , but Marge becomes the talk of the town due to the erotic poses she made after a few drinks of red wine . Meanwhile , Carl is chosen as the newest supervisor at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant , and hires Homer to be his personal assistant . 
 The episode was written by Tim Long and directed by Nancy Kruse . It was broadcast soon after the character Marge had appeared on the cover of Playboy , though there was no connection between the episode and the cover ; the idea for the episode was conceived first , and Marge 's appearance was due to an unrelated offer from Playboy . Since airing , " The Devil Wears Nada " has received mixed reviews from television critics . It was watched by approximately 9 @.@ 04 million viewers during its original broadcast . Clips showing the satirical appearances of French president Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni in the episode became Internet hits in France , with hundreds of thousands of views on Dailymotion and YouTube .

 The episode opens at a retirement party for the current Sector 7G supervisor at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant . Just as Homer , Lenny , and Carl are celebrating their freedom from supervision , plant owner Mr. Burns arrives and chooses Carl as the new supervisor , after quickly deducing that he is the only semi @-@ competent employee of the three . Meanwhile , in an effort to raise money , Marge and her " Charity Chicks " philanthropic group decide to follow the Springfield Police Department 's lead and pose for a history @-@ themed " sexy " calendar . At the photo studio , however , Marge does not want to show any skin . The photographer loosens her up with red wine , and she ends up revealing more than she planned . Marge and her erotic poses are soon the hottest talk in town . 
 Back at the plant , Carl makes Homer his new executive assistant . That evening , Marge 's libido pumped up by the male population 's positive feedback on her calendar is running high , but Homer is too overworked and exhausted to satisfy her . This becomes an unhappy trend , and Marge feels ignored . Homer tries to make up for it by taking Marge out to a hotel . During their attempt to have a romantic night together , Homer receives a phone call from Carl who tells him they are going to Paris on a business trip . When Homer leaves the Simpsons ' house the next morning , a frustrated Marge throws a mallet after his retreating taxicab , and she accidentally knocks out neighbor Ned Flanders instead and invites him and his children over for a family dinner by way of apology . 
 In Paris , Carl is having a great time flirting with a beautiful woman , and he reveals to Homer that he plans to extend their stay indefinitely . Homer is devastated , and walks forlornly through the streets where everything reminds him of Marge . Back in Springfield , Bart and Lisa bail on Marge 's dinner , and Ned shows up alone because Rod and Todd have been grounded . The innocent dinner soon turns romantic , and Marge and Ned nearly kiss , until Marge catches sight of her wedding photo in Ned 's glasses and realizes that it would be wrong . Homer , meanwhile , has forced Carl to give him his old job back by revealing that the woman Carl has been flirting with is actually Carla Bruni , the wife of Nicolas Sarkozy , the President of France . Homer arrives home just as Marge is bidding Ned goodnight , and Homer and Marge make love , undisturbed at last .

 " The Devil Wears Nada " was written by Tim Long and directed by Nancy Kruse . It is partly based on the film The Devil Wears Prada , especially the scenes that feature an overworked and over @-@ utilized Homer . The episode aired soon after the character Marge had appeared on the cover of the real @-@ life adult magazine Playboy . Executive producer Al Jean told the Toronto Sun that this episode was " a little bit of a reference to Marge 's recent encounter with Playboy " . Jean explained , though , that the writers came up with the storyline for " The Devil Wears Nada " over a year before the episode aired and they did not know back then that Marge would become a Playboy cover girl . Jean said that was " an independent offer from Playboy . But we thought , to be smart , we should probably have the episode and Marge 's cover come out around the same time . " In regards to Marge 's explicit plotline in the episode , Jean commented that the Simpsons staff is " always a bit nervous when we push the boundaries or do something unusual and I usually think that 's where we do our best stuff , and this episode is definitely one of those cases . "

 During the episode 's original broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on November 15 , 2009 , it was watched by approximately 9 @.@ 04 million viewers . In the demographic for adults aged 18 – 49 , the episode received a 4 @.@ 2 rating ( up 2 % from the previous episode ) and a 10 % share . It was the second @-@ highest rated television series in the 8 : 00 p.m. timeslot , following Football Night in America , which received a 5 @.@ 3 rating and 15 @.@ 1 million viewers . 
 Since airing , " The Devil Wears Nada " has received mixed reviews from television critics . AOL TV 's Jason Hughes was positive about it , commenting that " everything about the episode worked , from Marge 's sexy calendar to Ned Flanders ' role in the final moments . " He added that he thought the episode featured " the heart I felt was missing all season . The love between Homer and Marge dominated this episode , coming in equal strength from both sides . " Hughes concluded that " The Devil Wears Nada " featured " good moments for humor " and that it was " perfectly balanced , written and executed " . 
 Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was less positive , giving the episode a C + rating . He commented that because there have already been so many episodes about Homer and Marge 's marital troubles , it becomes more difficult every time to make the episodes emotional . VanDerWerff added that " while the flip side of the usual husband / wife sexual dynamics had a few promising jokes in it and while there were the usual funny sight gags and one @-@ liners , the entirety of the episode felt stale . [ ... ] There 's no way Homer or Marge will ever cheat on each other , and that makes a story like this essentially boring . " IGN 's Robert Canning gave the episode a rating of 6 @.@ 2 out of 10 , calling it disappointing . He commented that he enjoyed the first act of the episode because it had a lot of potential storylines , but it went downhill from there and became boring . Canning added : " This was another case of the series returning to familiar storylines . It 's tough to get away from this one — trouble in the bedroom — as they are a married couple and this is , essentially , a sitcom . Unfortunately , ' The Devil Wears Nada ' doesn 't give the story anything new . " Similarly to VanDerWerff , Canning did not find the episode enjoying because it was obvious that Marge and Ned would not have " a night of passion " since " Marge is too loving a wife and Ned is too good a Christian " .

 " The Devil Wears Nada " features the satirical appearances of French president Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni . In the episode , Carl is approached by Bruni at a reception at Élysée Palace , the official residence of the president , where she tells him that she wants " to make love , right now . " Homer later reveals to Carl that the woman he has been seeing is Bruni , and threatens to tell Sarkozy if he does not get his old job back . Carl does not believe Homer will tell , so Homer calls Sarkozy ( who is seen eating cheese and drinking red wine in his office with Bruni ) . Sarkozy answers the phone saying " You 're getting cosy with Sarkozy . " At this point , Carl gives in , and Homer hangs up the phone . 
 Unlike other high @-@ ranking politicians such as Tony Blair , who have guest starred on The Simpsons , the couple did not actually lend their voices to the show and the appearances were made without their permission . Agence France @-@ Presse wrote that as a result , it was a " harsher " parody in comparison to the parodies on the show of people that have provided their own voices . The Daily Mail described Bruni 's portrayal in the episode as a " sex @-@ mad femme fatale " and " chain @-@ smoking man @-@ eater " , and the French newspaper Le Figaro said she was characterized as " a nymphomaniac with an exaggerated French accent " . Bruni had previously attracted media attention in the United States because of her many reported partners and lovers . A reporter for The Times in Paris , Charles Bremner , wrote that her " sulphurous former image as the girlfriend of rock stars and celebrities was mocked by [ the episode ] . " 
 Clips on YouTube and Dailymotion showing Sarkozy 's and Bruni 's appearances were viewed hundreds of thousands of times in France , becoming Internet hits . According to Agence France @-@ Presse , the cameos " passed largely unnoticed in France until Friday [ November 22 ] , when news websites started linking to pirated clips of the episode , creating a buzz which saw more than 117 @,@ 000 fans linking to the <unk> site alone . " As of Saturday November 23 , the Dailymotion clip had received 440 @,@ 000 hits . Reactions to the clips were mixed from the French viewers . The Daily Mail wrote that a spokesman working for the Élysée Palace said in November 2009 that " they had no comment to make on the latest mockery of their first couple " . Bruni 's spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment either , but Bremner reported that Bruni " laughed when asked about the programme " . 
 The French news website Rue 89 commented that the episode provided the writers with a good opportunity to mock all the French clichés , including the accent , the cheese , the cheek kissing between men , and the supposed <unk> . This was not the first time that France had been made fun of on The Simpsons . For example , the writers had previously come up with the derogatory phrase " cheese @-@ eating surrender monkeys " as a description of the French people , and had made fun of the French in the first season episode The Crepes of Wrath .

 Following the poor reception of Echo & the Bunnymen 's third album , 1983 's Porcupine , the band recorded the single " Never Stop " . The title track of the single was produced by Hugh Jones , who had produced the band 's second album , 1981 's Heaven Up Here . The single introduced a new sound for the band with an expanded arrangement including congas , marimbas , violins and cellos . After " Never Stop " was released on 8 July 1983 the band toured the Outer Hebrides in Scotland before two successful concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 18 and 19 July . Also that month , the band was filmed by RPM Productions for the Channel 4 documentary series Play at Home . Filmed in a café used by the band they recorded acoustic versions of two old songs , " Stars Are Stars " and " Villiers Terrace " , as well as two new songs , " The Killing Moon " and " Silver " , for their episode of Play at Home titled Life at Brian 's . 
 After spending some time in Liverpool writing new songs for the album , the band recorded their sixth session for John Peel 's radio show on BBC Radio 1 on 6 September 1983 . The songs recorded were " Nocturnal Me " , " Ocean Rain " , " My Kingdom " and " Watch Out Below " , which would all later appear on the band 's fourth album Ocean Rain – " Watch Out Below " was later renamed " The Yo Yo Man " . When the band 's John Peel session was broadcast on 10 October 1983 , the punk zine Jamming said , " [ The songs ] hint at a readjustment and a period of new positive recovery . " 
 Echo & the Bunnymen were booked to headline a two @-@ week youth festival at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon on the evening of 23 October 1983 . Due to a high demand for tickets a matinee performance was added . The matinee concert at Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon saw the live debut of " The Killing Moon " , " Seven Seas " and " Silver " . With representatives from the band 's record company and lead singer Ian McCulloch 's mother in the audience , the performance was nervous and uncertain ; although the evening performance , without the record company representatives and McCulloch 's mother , was much improved . 
 At the end of 1983 Echo & the Bunnymen recorded a live special called A Crystal Day for the Channel 4 programme The Tube . Ignoring their old material , the band played " The Killing Moon " , " Nocturnal Me " , " Ocean Rain " – which had now developed into a ballad – and an early version of " Thorn of Crowns " called " Cucumber " . 
 = = Recording and music = = 
 The band recorded and self @-@ produced " The Killing Moon " – which was released on 20 January 1984 – at Crescent Studio in Bath , Somerset . After catching a cold , McCulloch completed the recording of the vocals for the song at Amazon Studio in Liverpool , where de Freitas also completed the drumming . The band then went to Paris where they were booked into Les Studios des Dames and Studio Davout . Henri <unk> , the engineer at des Dames , assisted on the string passages and Adam Peters provided the string arrangements and played cello and piano . McCulloch , not happy with the lead vocals he had recorded in Paris , re @-@ recorded most of the vocals at Amazon Studio in Liverpool . 
 Continuing the band 's prominent use of strings – which began with the 1982 single " The Back of Love " – they recorded Ocean Rain using a 35 @-@ piece orchestra . Lead guitarist Will Sergeant said , " We wanted to make something conceptual with lush orchestration ; not Mantovani , something with a twist . It 's all pretty dark . ' Thorn of Crowns ' is based on an eastern scale . The whole mood is very windswept : European pirates , a bit Ben Gunn ; dark and stormy , battering rain ; all of that . " During recording De Freitas used xylophones and glockenspiels in addition to his usual percussion , bass player Les Pattinson used an old reverb machine at des Dames and Sergeant 's solo on " My Kingdom " was played using a Washburn acoustic guitar which he distorted through a valve radio .

 As with their previous albums , the album cover was designed by Martyn Atkins and the photography was by Brian Griffin . With the band wanting to continue the elemental theme of the previous three albums , the photograph used on the front cover of the album is a picture of the band in a rowing boat which was taken inside <unk> Caverns , Liskeard , Cornwall . In his 2002 book Turquoise Days : The Weird World of Echo & the Bunnymen , author Chris Adams describes the cover as " a perfect visual representation of arguably the Bunnymen 's finest album " . 
 The picture on the front cover of the original album was kept for the 2003 reissue . However , the design was altered slightly by graphic designer Rachel Gutek of the design company <unk> . This release contains an expanded booklet written by music journalist Max Bell giving the background to the album . The booklet contains a number of photographs which are credited to Sergeant and Pattinson .

 Ocean Rain was first released on 4 May 1984 as an LP and on cassette by Korova in Europe . It was subsequently released by Sire Records in the United States on 14 May and on CD in Europe and the United States on 24 August 1984 . The album was marketed as " the greatest album ever made " and McCulloch later said it was because they believed it was . Although he also said it was meant as a joke when he said , " That wasn 't my idea ! I was on the phone to [ Rob Dickins , managing director of Warner Bros. ] , just <unk> and I said ' Oh , it 's the greatest album ever made . ' And he used it on the poster . " In a 2005 interview for Record Collector magazine , Sergeant asked , " Why not ? " . After wondering " what all the fuss was about " , he went on to ask , " Doesn 't every band think that way when they 've got a new record out ? " 
 Along with the other four of the band 's first five albums , Ocean Rain was remastered and reissued on CD in 2003 – these releases were marketed as 25th anniversary editions . Eight bonus tracks were added to the album : " Angels and Devils " , which had been recorded at The <unk> in San Francisco , was the B @-@ side to the single " Silver " and was produced by The Bunnymen and Alan <unk> ; five Life at Brian 's – Lean and Hungry tracks ( " All You Need Is Love " , " The Killing Moon " , " Stars Are Stars " , " Villiers Terrace " and " Silver " ) which had been recorded for the Channel 4 programme Play at Home ; and two live tracks ( " My Kingdom " and " Ocean Rain " ) which were recorded for A Crystal Day , a Channel 4 special for The Tube . The Life at Brian 's – Lean and Hungry track , " Silver " , and the two A Crystal Day tracks had previously been unreleased . 
 The reissued album in 2003 was produced by Andy Zax and Bill Inglot . A collector 's edition was released in October 2008 which , while still including " Angels and Devils " , replaced the bonus tracks of the 25th anniversary edition with the extended 12 @-@ inch single versions of " Silver " and " The Killing Moon " . The collector 's edition also includes a bonus disc containing a recording of the band 's 1983 Royal Albert Hall concert . 
 There were three tracks from the original Ocean Rain album which have been released as singles . The first of these was " The Killing Moon " which was released on 20 January 1984 . The second single was " Silver " which was released on 13 April 1984 . The final single to be released from the original album was " Seven Seas " which was released on 6 July 1984 . This was the first time Echo & the Bunnymen have released more than two singles from one album . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The album was released to mixed reviews . Describing Echo & the Bunnymen 's change from the more rock sound of their previous albums to the lighter sound of Ocean Rain , music journalist Max Bell said in his 1984 review for The Times newspaper , " This time vocalist Ian McCulloch has tempered his metaphysical songs with a romantic sweetness and the band 's melodies are more to the fore . Acoustic guitars , brushes and sparingly used keyboards all add to the album 's optimistic warmth and there is a consistency of atmosphere in songs like ' Seven Seas ' and ' Silver ' , the current single , which justifies the departure . " 
 However , Rolling Stone described the album as " too often a monochromatic dirge of banal existential imagery cloaked around the mere skeleton of a musical idea " . Saying that the album had some nifty choruses and nice atmospheres , the review went on to say it " evinces too little melodic development and too much tortured soul @-@ gazing " . In his 1984 review for NME , Biba Kopf said , " ... Ocean Rain has been designed to buttress the notion of the group 's importance . Not unnaturally the results have the opposite effect . " He went on to criticise McCulloch 's lyrics , which he described as " tired juxtapositions of mysterious buzzwords , nonsense , and banality " , and the music , " mellotron @-@ style wash of strings and bleating wood winds " . 
 Ocean Rain reached number four on the UK Albums Chart in its first week of release and stayed on the chart for 26 weeks . In the United States it entered the Billboard 200 at number 172 on 9 June 1984 and stayed on the chart for 11 weeks , reaching a peak of number 87 . It entered the Canadian RPM 100 Albums chart at number 89 before it reached a peak of number 41 . Staying on the Swedish chart for three weeks the album reached a peak of number 22 . As of 1984 , Ocean Rain has been certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry for having sold more than 100 @,@ 000 copies . 
 Of the singles from the album ; " The Killing Moon " , which was released on 20 January 1984 , reached number nine on the UK Singles Chart and number seven on the Irish Singles Chart ; " Silver " , released on 13 April 1984 , reached number 30 on the UK Singles Chart and number 14 on the Irish Singles Chart ; and " Seven Seas " , released on 6 July 1984 , reached number 16 on the UK Singles Chart and number 10 on the Irish Singles Chart .

 The album still attracts mixed critical commentary . In a highly positive retrospective review on AllMusic , Jason Ankeny gave the album a 5 @-@ star rating . He described the album as " dramatic and majestic " , praising the " sweeping string arrangements and hauntingly evocative production . " He felt that in comparison to the band 's album Porcupine , the " conventional and simple structural parameters " of Ocean Rain made it Echo & the Bunnymen 's " most beautiful and memorable effort " and he asserted that " The Killing Moon " was the band 's " unrivalled pinnacle " . 
 When reissued in 2003 , Andrew Harrison in Blender described the album as " a portrait of splendid derangement with spectacular orchestrations " . Mojo said the album had " effervescent songs , sympathetically orchestrated " . 
 In his 2005 book Rip It Up and Start Again : Post Punk 1978 – 1984 , British music journalist Simon Reynolds describes the album as " lush , orchestrated and [ ... ] overtly erotic " . Mark Blacklock , in Robert Dimery 's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die , wrote that the album 's confidence , lush strings , romance , warmth and poetry , means that " it stands the test of time better than any other Bunnymen album " . 
 Among less positive commentaries , Pitchfork described the album as being " stuffed with queasy midtempo tracks and bizarre orchestration " although they did say that the album was not impenetrable , ultimately giving it an 8 @.@ 6 / 10 . Reviewing the collector 's edition for the BBC , Chris Jones described the album as " the point where the cracks began to show , but were masked with such beauty as to hardly matter " . Jones went on to say how the 35 @-@ piece orchestra helped on tracks such as " Nocturnal Me " but made others , such as " The Yo @-@ Yo Man " , " flounder under the weight of intrusive arrangements " .

 On 16 September 2008 , Echo & the Bunnymen played a concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London playing the album with the backing of a 16 @-@ piece orchestra . Two similar concerts subsequently took place at Radio City in New York City on 1 October 2008 and at the Liverpool Echo Arena on 27 November 2008 . These concerts were played with a 10 @-@ piece orchestra which was conducted by Rupert Christie . The posters used to advertise the concerts have the image of the band from the cover of the album overlaying an image of the venue . Further concerts took place in Europe and North America during 2009 . 
 The concerts were received well . Simon O 'Hagan , reviewing the London concert in The Independent , described it as " a moving , memorable evening " and went on to describe McCulloch 's voice as " torn silk " and " magnificent " . Giving the London concert five out of five stars , Angus Batey , writing in The Guardian , described " The Killing Moon " as a " dizzying high " which was " topped by ' Ocean Rain ' itself , where the strings are held back until the end of the second verse so that they hit with a euphoric punch of almost physical intensity , sunny melodic optimism piercing the lyrics ' chiaroscuro of storm clouds and ' blackest thoughts ' . " However , Adam Sweeting , for The Daily Telegraph , said the orchestra " often didn 't add much beyond a vague sonic sludge " . 
 Reviewing the New York concert for Rolling Stone , Jim Allen described Radio City as an " appropriately dramatic , grandiose setting " , and added that McCulloch " was in fine voice , growling and sneering wondrously " . Reviewing the Liverpool concert , Jade Wright wrote in the Liverpool Echo that McCulloch " was on form – one part Lou Reed , one part Oliver Reed , with a bit of Jim Morrison thrown in for good measure .

 = Washington State Route 161 = 
 State Route 161 ( SR 161 ) is a 36 @.@ 25 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 58 @.@ 34 km ) state highway serving Pierce and King counties in the U.S. state of Washington . The highway begins at SR 7 southwest of Eatonville and travels north as Meridian Avenue to Puyallup , becoming concurrent with SR 512 and SR 167 . SR 161 continues northwest as the Enchanted Parkway to end at an intersection with SR 18 in Federal Way , west of Interstate 5 ( I @-@ 5 ) . The highway serves the communities of Graham and South Hill before reaching Puyallup and the communities of Edgewood , Milton , and Lakeland South before reaching Federal Way . 
 SR 161 was established during the 1964 highway renumbering , replacing three Secondary State Highways ( <unk> ) : Secondary State Highway 5D ( SSH 5D ) and SSH 5G , both established in 1937 , and SSH 5N , established in 1955 . SSH 5D served as a connector between Federal Way and Puyallup and SSH 5G served as a connector between Puyallup and South Hill . SSH 5N connected Eatonville to South Hill and was extended south towards La Grande in 1967 . SR 161 was moved onto a bypass of Puyallup in the 1980s and formed concurrencies with SR 167 and SR 512 as a result . As of 2013 , projects to expand the highway in Edgewood and Milton and adding new <unk> at the I @-@ 5 and SR 18 interchange are in progress . 
 = = Route description = = 
 SR 161 begins southwest of Eatonville and north of La Grande in rural Pierce County at an intersection with SR 7 . The highway travels northeast to pass the Charles Lathrop Pack Experimental and Demonstration Forest and cross the Little <unk> River into Eatonville . The roadway crosses the <unk> River into Downtown Eatonville , turning north onto <unk> Avenue and later Washington Avenue . SR 161 turns west onto Meridian Avenue north of Eatonville High School and leaves the city on a two @-@ lane highway . Meridian Avenue continues north through rural Pierce County , passing Clear Lake and <unk> Lake , before entering the community of Graham and crossing a Tacoma Rail line near Graham @-@ <unk> High School . SR 161 travels north and passes South Hill and Pierce County Airport ( Thun Field ) before entering Puyallup . The highway turns northwest at the South Hill Mall onto 31st Avenue and intersects the SR 512 freeway in a partial cloverleaf interchange , beginning a 3 @.@ 41 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 5 @.@ 49 km ) concurrency . 
 SR 161 and SR 512 travel north on a freeway in Puyallup , intersecting Meridian Street at the Puyallup Fairgrounds and Pioneer Avenue at a partial cloverleaf interchange . After the intersection with Pioneer Avenue , the freeway travels over a BNSF rail line that serves Puyallup Station and crosses the Puyallup River before a trumpet interchange with SR 167 . At the interchange , SR 512 ends and SR 161 northbound turns west on a 1 @.@ 83 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 2 @.@ 95 km ) wrong @-@ way concurrency with SR 167 , designated as traveling southbound . SR 161 turns north onto Meridian Avenue at Fort Malone as SR 167 travels south into Downtown Puyallup , and the highway continues north and crosses a Union Pacific rail line . Meridian Avenue continues north into to form the boundary between Edgewood and Milton , where the highway intersects Milton Way , the former route of SR 514 . SR 161 turns northwest into King County as the Enchanted Parkway , passing through Lakeland South and Wild Waves Theme Park before crossing over I @-@ 5 . The Enchanted Parkway turns north into Federal Way and ends at an intersection with SR 18 , located between SR 99 and I @-@ 5 . 
 Every year , the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2011 , WSDOT calculated that between 340 and 99 @,@ 000 vehicles per day used the highway , mostly in the Puyallup area . 
 = = History = = 
 SR 161 was formed during the 1964 highway renumbering as the successor to SSH 5N from Primary State Highway 5 ( PSH 5 ) north of La Grande to South Hill , SSH 5G from South Hill to U.S. Route 410 ( US 410 ) in Puyallup , and SSH 5D from US 410 north of Puyallup to US 99 Federal Way . The highway was also concurrent with US 410 , signed in 1926 , between the eastern end of SSH 5G in Downtown Puyallup and the southern end of SSH 5D . SSH 5D and SSH 5G were established during the creation of the Primary and secondary state highways in 1937 , and SSH 5N was established in 1955 to Eatonville and extended south to PSH 5 near La Grande in 1967 after SR 161 was created . SR 161 , including the concurrency with US 410 , was signed into law in 1970 as a highway extending from SR 7 near Eatonville to US 99 . US 410 was replaced with an extension of SR 167 in the Tacoma area and US 12 east of the Cascade Mountains in 1967 and the highway was shortened from US 99 to SR 18 in 1971 . 
 SR 161 was moved east onto a bypass of Puyallup , creating <unk> with SR 512 and SR 167 , in the late 1980s , and designated , within King County , as the Enchanted Parkway in 1987 as the last major revision to the highway . A freeway extension to SR 167 between Tacoma and Puyallup has been proposed since the 1990s and would create a new interchange with SR 161 north of the Puyallup River , but as of 2013 the freeway has not been built . The eastbound ramps at end of the concurrency between SR 161 and SR 167 was realigned in late 2008 to reduce congestion and started recent improvements to the highway . WSDOT is widening the Enchanted Parkway through the Edgewood and Milton area from 2 lanes to 4 lanes with wider shoulders and sidewalks to be completed by 2027 . The interchange between I @-@ 5 and SR 18 is being reconstructed in Federal Way , with a new flyover ramp from westbound SR 18 to SR 161 being completed in September 2012 . Another ramp , from southbound I @-@ 5 to SR 161 , is under construction .

 = Glutinoglossum glutinosum = 
 Glutinoglossum glutinosum , commonly known as the viscid black earth tongue or the glutinous <unk> , is a species of fungus in the family Geoglossaceae ( the earth tongues ) . Widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere , it has been found in northern Africa , Asia , Europe , and North America . Although previously thought to exist in Australasia , collections made from these locations have since been referred to new species . G. glutinosum is a saprophytic species that grows on soil in moss or in grassy areas . The smooth , nearly black , club @-@ shaped fruitbodies grow to heights ranging from 1 @.@ 5 to 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 to 2 @.@ 0 in ) . The head is up to 0 @.@ 7 cm ( 0 @.@ 3 in ) long , and the stipes are sticky . Several other black earth tongue species are quite similar in external appearance , and many can be reliably distinguished only by examining differences in microscopic characteristics , such as spores , asci , and paraphyses . First described in 1796 as a species of Geoglossum , the fungus has gone through several changes of genera in its taxonomic history . It was placed in its current genus , Glutinoglossum , in 2013 . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The fungus was first officially described in 1796 as Geoglossum glutinosum by Dutch mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon , who proposed several defining characteristics , including the black color ; the smooth , compressed , club @-@ shaped head ( <unk> ) with grooves ; and the somewhat curved and glutinous stipe . In 1908 , Elias Judah Durand transferred it to <unk> , a genus he circumscribed to contain species with paraphyses ( filamentous , sterile cells interspersed between the asci ) present as a continuous gelatinous layer on the stipe ; <unk> has since been reduced to synonymy with Geoglossum . In 1942 Japanese mycologist Sanshi Imai thought the species should be in Cibalocoryne , a genus name used earlier by Frigyes Ákos <unk> , and so published Cibalocoryne glutinosa . Later authors thought Cibalocoryne to be ambiguous , and the name was synonymized with Geoglossum . Persoon also described the species Geoglossum viscosum ( 1801 ) and the variety Geoglossum glutinosum var. <unk> ( 1822 ) , but both of these taxa were placed into synonymy with G. glutinosum by Elias Judah Durand in 1908 . 
 The species was transferred by Vincent Hustad and colleagues to the newly created genus Glutinoglossum in 2013 when molecular analysis revealed that it and the species G. <unk> formed a well @-@ defined clade in the Geoglossaceae . In 2015 , Hustad and Andrew Miller published an emended description of G. glutinosum with a narrower range of spore dimensions , suggesting that material collected in Australia and New Zealand represent unique species , which they referred to G. australasicum and G. exiguum . These species , along with G. americanum and G. <unk> , were added to Glutinoglossum in 2015 . Hustad and Miller noted their new spore size range for G. glutinosum were more closely aligned with those given by Durand in his measurements of Persoon 's type specimen . 
 The specific epithet glutinosum is derived from the Latin word gluten , meaning " glue " . The species is commonly known as the " viscid black earth tongue " or the " glutinous <unk> " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The club @-@ shaped fruitbodies , which have a distinct blackish head and a more lightly colored stipe ( dark brown ) , grow to heights ranging from 1 @.@ 5 to 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 6 to 2 @.@ 0 in ) . The head is up to 0 @.@ 7 cm ( 0 @.@ 3 in ) tall and ranges in shape from fuse @-@ shaped to narrowly ellipsoidal to nearly cylindrical , and is somewhat compressed on the sides . The nearly black , somewhat waxy head has a vertical groove down the middle . The stipe has a glutinous , dark grey @-@ brown surface . 
 The spores are smooth and cylindrical , sometimes with a slight swelling in the middle , and sometimes slightly curved ; they measure 59 – 65 by 4 – 5 µm . G. glutinosum spores have between two and seven septa , although three is most typical in mature specimens . The thin @-@ walled asci ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are cylindrical to narrowly club @-@ shaped , eight @-@ spored , and typically measure 200 – 265 µm long by 12 – 16 µm wide . Ascospores occupy about the upper two @-@ thirds to three @-@ quarters of the ascus , leaving a hyaline ( transparent ) base . The paraphyses , hyaline at the base and brown in the upper regions , are 4 – 11 µm wide , and longer than the asci . Cells at the end of the paraphyses are pear @-@ shaped ( piriform ) or spherical , brownish , and measure 8 – 10 µm wide . The sticky material on the stipe is a gelatinous matrix made of a layer of paraphyses . 
 Although black earth tongue species are generally not worth eating , Charles McIlvaine opined in his 1902 work One Thousand American Fungi that , if stewed , G. glutinosum is " delicious . " 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Geoglossum <unk> is similar in appearance to Glutinoglossum glutinosum , but lacks a slimy stipe . <unk> species , such as the common T. hirsutum , have a velvety surface texture acquired from thick @-@ walled bristles called setae . Several other earth tongue species are roughly similar in external appearance to G. glutinosum , and can be difficult to distinguish from that species without considering distribution and microscopic characteristics such as the size and shape of the asci , ascospores , and paraphyses . Geoglossum <unk> and G. <unk> can develop a glutinous stipe ; the former has spores measuring 90 – 120 by 6 – 7 µm with 14 septa , while the latter has spores that are 60 – 80 by 4 @.@ 5 – 6 µm with 7 septa . The Australasian species Glutinoglossum <unk> is distinguished from G. glutinosum by its short , stout ascospores ( mostly measuring 70 – 80 by 5 – 6 µm ) and the presence of curved to hooked paraphyses tips . G. australasicum , the most abundant Glutinoglossum species in Australasia , has asci measuring 205 – 270 by 17 – 20 µm , while those of G. exiguum are 165 – 260 by 13 @.@ 5 – 17 µm . The latter species tends to have smaller fruitbodies , up to 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) tall . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Glutinoglossum glutinosum is a saprophytic species . Its fruitbodies grow scattered on soil in moss beds or in grassy areas . North American collections are typically associated with hardwoods , while European collections are often made in pasture and dune slacks . The fungus has been used as an indicator of medium @-@ quality grassland in the UK . In India , it has been encountered on the soil of oak forests , and among mosses on stony slopes at an elevation of 2 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) . 
 A widely distributed species , Glutinoglossum glutinosum has been recorded from northern Africa ( Macaronesia and Morocco ) , Asia ( Bhutan , China , India , Japan , and the Philippines ) and Europe . It is listed as vulnerable in Switzerland . In Bulgaria , where it is considered critically endangered , threats to G. glutinosum include " habitat changes as result of agriculture activities ( crops , livestock ) , atmospheric and land pollution , drought , global warming . " In a preliminary Regional Red List of Dutch macrofungi , G. glutinosum was considered threatened , and it was noted that before 1970 , the fungus was " rather common " , compared to " rather rare " after that year . The North American distribution includes Canada , the United States , and Mexico . 
 Although G. glutinosum was previously thought to have occurred in Australia and New Zealand , later examination and genetic analysis of collections from these locations showed the material to belong to what have since been described as the new species G. australasicum or G. exiguum .

 Nevin attended El Dorado High School in Placentia , California . After graduating , he was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the third round of the 1989 Major League Baseball draft with the 82nd overall selection . He decided to attend California State University , Fullerton after turning down an offer that included a signing bonus of $ 100 @,@ 000 . 
 A two @-@ sport star , Nevin played American football and baseball for the Cal State Fullerton Titans , competing in the Big West Conference of NCAA Division I. He was a punter and placekicker on the Cal State Fullerton Titans football team . He was named an All @-@ American placekicker his freshman year for the Titans as he connected successfully on his first nine field goal attempts and finished the year with a 15 @-@ for @-@ 21 field goal percentage . His longest field goal of the season was 54 yards ( 49 m ) . In his junior year , he averaged 40 @.@ 9 yards ( 37 @.@ 4 m ) per punt . 
 For the Cal State Fullerton Titans baseball team , Nevin batted .358 with 56 runs batted in ( RBI ) as a freshman . The Titans won the conference championship and reached the 1990 College World Series ( CWS ) that year . The Titans lost two games in the 1990 CWS , however , and were eliminated . Nevin batted .335 in his sophomore season . As a junior , he batted .391 with 20 home runs and 71 RBI , winning the Big West Conference Triple Crown . Collegiate Baseball and Baseball America named Nevin the College Player of the Year . He credited his past CWS experience with allowing him to remain calm . 
 In three seasons at Cal State Fullerton , Nevin had a .364 average with 39 home runs and 184 RBI . He led the Titans to the finals of the 1992 CWS , where the Titans lost to the Pepperdine Waves baseball team , which represented the West Coast Conference . Despite the loss , Nevin was voted the CWS Most Outstanding Player after he batted 10 @-@ for @-@ 19 with two home runs and 11 RBI . He also won the Golden Spikes Award , given to the best amateur player in the nation .

 The Houston Astros chose Nevin with the first overall pick in the 1992 Major League Baseball draft . Hal Newhouser , a scout for the Astros , had evaluated Derek Jeter extensively prior to the draft . Convinced that Jeter would anchor a winning team , Newhouser lobbied team management to select Jeter , and quit in protest over the Astros ' decision to take Nevin instead . The Astros believed that Jeter would insist on a salary bonus of at least $ 1 million to forgo his college scholarship for a professional contract . Signing bonuses given to the best player in the draft were increasing rapidly . Todd Van Poppel , regarded by many at the time the first pick of the 1990 MLB draft , signed for $ 1 @.@ 2 million , while the 1991 MLB draft 's first pick , Brien Taylor , signed for $ 1 @.@ 55 million after insisting he would otherwise enroll in college . Meanwhile , the Astros were unable to sign their first @-@ round draft pick in 1991 , John Burke , who insisted on a bonus of $ 500 @,@ 000 as the sixth overall selection . Consequently , the Astros passed on Jeter in the draft . 
 Bill Wood , the Astros ' general manager , said the team believed Nevin was close to a major @-@ league level and would require little development in minor league baseball . As evidence for this , the Astros pointed to Nevin 's training with the wooden bats used in professional baseball in an effort to prepare himself for the transition from metal bats . The Astros believed he would be a solid power hitter and have a strong work ethic . Nevin also did not intend to seek a signing bonus approaching those received by Van Poppel and Taylor . The Astros decided to employ Nevin as a third baseman . Not wanting to draw out his contract negotiations , Nevin signed with Houston in June , receiving a $ 700 @,@ 000 bonus .

 Nevin tried out for the United States national baseball team in the summer of 1990 to play in that year 's Goodwill Games and World University Baseball Championship ( <unk> ) . To prepare for those tournaments , the team played a series against Japan and a game in Cuba . Nevin played second and third base for Team USA in 13 of its 22 games , batting .229 . The team released him before the Goodwill Games and <unk> as it cut players to meet the roster maximum . Nevin was also considered for the 1991 Pan American Games . 
 Nevin tried out for Team USA again before the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona . The team embarked on a 30 @-@ game tour and 38 @-@ city exhibition @-@ game schedule in the United States before leaving for Spain . He made the team and served as its starting third baseman throughout the tournament . Olympic coach Ron Fraser called Nevin an excellent player and student of the game . The United States finished fourth out of eight teams in the Olympics .

 Nevin traveled with the Astros at the end of their 1992 season but was not on the team 's roster . The Astros sent Nevin to the instructional Arizona Fall League during the off @-@ season . Before the 1993 season , Baseball America ranked Nevin as the 30th @-@ best prospect in baseball . 
 The Astros considered sending Nevin to the Jackson Generals of the Class AA Texas League to start his professional career . The team also considered promoting him directly to the major leagues , skipping the minor leagues entirely . At the Astros ' spring training in 1993 , Nevin batted .350 and showed good power hitting . The Astros weighed bringing Nevin to Houston for Opening Day as they sought to add a right @-@ handed batter to complement the left @-@ handed power of Luis Gonzalez , Steve Finley and Eric Anthony and make the team less vulnerable to left @-@ handed pitching . But with Ken Caminiti in the first year of a three @-@ year contract to play as the starting third baseman , Nevin had nowhere to play defensively . The Astros assigned him to the Class AAA Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League , one level below the major leagues , where he made his professional debut . 
 While Nevin was with the Toros , the Astros asked Toros manager Rick Sweet to play Nevin as a left fielder , which would allow the Astros to promote Nevin sooner , as he and Caminiti could play different positions . Veteran first baseman Jim Lindeman served as Nevin 's mentor , helping him keep his composure under significant attention and pressure to perform . Nevin started the 1993 season with a .247 batting average , but batted .309 with baserunners in scoring position and had 49 RBI . By July , he had made ten starts in left field , without committing an error . The Astros , however , were concerned that Nevin did not apply the level of intensity he had in " clutch " situations to cases where there were no baserunners and the score was not close . 
 Nevin 's intensity almost got the best of him during a June 1993 game with Tucson . He was taunted by a man seated in the front row , and nearly attempted to jump into the stands to confront the fan before he was restrained by teammates . The fan was arrested . 
 Nevin played third base and left field in 1993 . He batted .286 that season , with 10 home runs and 91 RBI . He had a .359 on @-@ base percentage ( OBP ) and .413 slugging percentage ( SLG ) . Baseball America rated him the 24th best prospect before the 1994 season . He returned to Tucson that year , posting a .263 batting average with 12 home runs and 71 RBI . He had a .343 OBP , and .393 SLG . Nevin also played first base . His major @-@ league debut , however , was delayed both by his defense ( 61 errors in his first two seasons ) and the MLB 1994 – 95 work stoppage . 
 The Astros traded Caminiti to the San Diego Padres before the 1995 season . With Caminiti no longer blocking his path to the major leagues , Nevin hoped he would be named the Astros ' starting third baseman . But the Astros did not invite him to spring training . Nevin attributed the snub to his refusal to work out with replacement players during the work stoppage . Not wanting to be seen as " scabs " by the Major League Baseball Players Association , minor league players who felt they would play in MLB after the resolution of the strike felt pressure to avoid playing with replacement players , while career minor @-@ leaguers were happy to get a taste of the major leagues . When prospects including Nevin and Billy Wagner refused to play with the replacement players , Astros ' general manager Bob Watson issued an ultimatum , saying anyone who refused to play in the team 's first exhibition game would be sent out of camp until further notice and be held in breach of contract . The Astros sent Nevin back to Tucson to start the 1995 season , while Dave Magadan started at third base on Opening Day . The Astros also planned to use Shipley and Chris <unk> at third base . 
 With the Toros in 1995 , Nevin 's batting average improved to .291 . He also posted a .367 OBP , and .463 SLG , while contributing seven home runs and 41 RBI . The Astros promoted him on June 10 , 1995 , and he made his major @-@ league debut a day later . Nevin played 18 games for the Astros during the 1995 season . He struggled with the Astros , however , batting <unk> with no home runs , one RBI , a .221 OBP , and .133 SLG in 60 at @-@ bats . When he learned of his demotion to Tucson on July 5 in Colorado , Nevin cursed at Watson and Astros manager Terry Collins . After Watson called for an apology , Nevin said he would use the incident as a learning experience in controlling his temper . 
 The Astros acquired pitcher Mike Henneman from the Detroit Tigers for a player to be named later on August 10 ; Nevin was identified as the player five days later . In 1996 , Nevin played in Class AA for the Tigers with the Jacksonville Suns of the Southern League , where he was converted into a catcher . 
 = = = = Recovering from earlier struggles ( 1998 – 2001 ) = = = = 
 After the 1997 season , the Tigers traded Nevin and catcher Matt Walbeck to the Anaheim Angels , where Collins was manager , for minor league player Nick <unk> . After an injury to starting catcher Todd Greene , Collins gave Nevin the opportunity to compete for the starting job with Walbeck . Nevin , by then well known for his volatile temper , tore off his jersey while arguing balls and strike calls with the home plate umpire in a 1998 game . 
 Before the 1999 season , the Angels traded Nevin and minor league player Keith <unk> to the San Diego Padres . Nevin made a late @-@ career break with the Padres , appearing in 100 games for the first time during the 1999 season . He then had the best offensive years of his career : he hit 31 home runs with a .916 on @-@ base plus slugging ( OPS ) during the 2000 season . He was named to the National League All @-@ Star team in 2001 , when he hit 41 home runs with 126 RBI and had a .976 OPS . He also led major @-@ league third basemen in errors , however , with 27 , and had the lowest fielding percentage of all major league third basemen ( <unk> ) . 
 = = = = Injuries and final seasons ( 2002 – 2006 ) = = = = 
 Nevin in 2002 played first base , which was considered his strongest defensive position . But injuries shortened his 2002 and 2003 seasons . In 2002 , he missed time with a strained left elbow . Three games after returning from the elbow injury , he broke his arm diving for a ground ball , causing him to miss another six weeks . After being heckled by a fan during a September 2002 game , Nevin gave the fan the finger , for which he apologized . 
 Nevin suffered a dislocated shoulder in spring training in 2003 while making a diving catch . He had surgery on his left shoulder and returned to the Padres in June . The Padres acquired Rondell White to replace Nevin , and White went on to have an All @-@ Star season in left field . Ryan Klesko filled in at first base and rookie Sean Burroughs played well at third base , Nevin 's favorite position . Nevin offered to be used in a utility role , alternating with White , Klesko , and Burroughs , as well as Xavier Nady in right field . In 2004 , Nevin had more than 100 RBI for the third time in his career , but underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right knee in July . 
 Nevin was often frustrated with the dimensions of Petco Park . He hit a double during a 2004 game that he believed would have been a home run in other stadiums ; when he reached second base , he pointed toward Padres ' general manager Kevin Towers ' suite and threw down his helmet , resulting in a postgame argument . Towers said the two had a " love @-@ hate " relationship . 
 Two nights after San Diego Padres management informed Nevin that Xavier Nady would replace him as the starting first baseman , Nevin rejected a trade to the Baltimore Orioles for Sidney Ponson on July 25 , 2005 . Nevin exercised a clause in his contract that gave him the right to block transactions that would send him to any of eight franchises , one of which was the Orioles . He was instead traded on July 30 , a day before the non @-@ waiver trade deadline , to the Texas Rangers for Chan Ho Park , whose salary the Rangers wanted to dump . In his first thirteen games with the Rangers , the team posted a 1 – 12 record as Nevin batted 5 @-@ for @-@ 44 . That put his season batting average under .200 , known as the " Mendoza Line " . The Rangers benched Nevin in September , giving his starts to prospect first baseman Adrian Gonzalez after the team was eliminated from playoff contention . In his first game back in the lineup on September 24 , his average dropped to .182 . He refuted opinions that he was losing bat speed . 
 Nevin had one year remaining on a contract worth $ 9 million . Manager Buck Showalter said that despite Nevin 's benching at the end of the 2005 season , he was his starting designated hitter for the 2006 season . Despite hopes that help from renowned hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo and the hitter @-@ friendly <unk> Field would increase Nevin 's offensive production in 2006 , he continued to struggle . He batted .216 with nine home runs and 31 RBI in 46 games . The Rangers promoted rookie Jason Botts on May 23 , and Botts began to receive Nevin 's playing time . 
 Nevin had only two hits in his last 32 at @-@ bats with the Rangers , though both of them were home runs . The Chicago Cubs sought a slugging first baseman to replace the injured Derrek Lee , and the Rangers traded Nevin to Chicago on May 31 , 2006 . The Rangers received second baseman and outfielder Jerry Hairston , Jr. in return . The Rangers also agreed to pay the difference in the two players ' salaries . On August 31 , the deadline for trades of players who had cleared waivers , the Cubs traded Nevin to the Twins for cash and a player to be named later . To make room for Nevin , Twins ' outfielder Shannon Stewart was placed on the 60 @-@ day disabled list . 
 With the Twins , Nevin stopped worrying about his statistics and enjoyed playing in a pennant race . Nevin appeared in the MLB postseason for the first time in his career with the Twins in 2006 . The Twins were swept by the Oakland Athletics in three games ; Nevin appeared in one of the three games , batting 0 @-@ for @-@ 3 . 
 = = Post @-@ playing career = = 
 Unsigned at the beginning of the following season , Nevin announced his retirement on May 12 , 2007 . During his twelve @-@ season career , Nevin had a .270 batting average with 208 home runs and 743 RBI in 1 @,@ 217 games . After retiring , Nevin joined the Padres ' pre @-@ game radio show . He also joined ESPN as an analyst for the college baseball regionals during the College World Series . 
 Two seasons removed from his playing career , Nevin decided to return to baseball as a manager in 2008 . That December , he was named the manager of the Orange County Flyers in the independent Golden Baseball League ( GBL ) . The Flyers finished with a 37 – 39 record in 2009 , fourth in the five @-@ team GBL . Nevin planned to return to the Flyers in 2010 , but a chance meeting at baseball 's winter meetings led to Nevin 's hiring as manager of the Erie SeaWolves , the Class @-@ AA minor @-@ league affiliate of the Detroit Tigers . He replaced the previous manager , Tom Brookens after Brookens was promoted to the Tigers ' major @-@ league first @-@ base coach . 
 Nevin managed the SeaWolves for one season . On November 11 , 2010 , Nevin was named manager of the Toledo Mud Hens , the Tigers ' Class AAA minor league affiliate . He is considered a potential future MLB manager . Catcher <unk> Santos described his managing the Mud Hens as " like having a big league manager in [ Class AAA ] . " On August 31 , 2013 , Nevin was fired after the team 's final home game of the season . Nevin 's record as manager was 192 – 238 ; the team never finished higher than third in the International League 's West division . 
 The Arizona Diamondbacks named Nevin as manager of the Reno Aces , their Class AAA affiliate , for the 2014 season . In his first season with Reno , he guided the Aces to a Pacific Coast League @-@ best 81 @-@ 63 record and an eventual Pacific Coast League Championship Series berth . After the season , the Astros interviewed Nevin for their open managerial position . However Nevin remained the manager of the Reno Aces for the 2015 season and returned as manager in 2016 .

 = Body Language ( Kylie Minogue album ) = 
 Body Language is the ninth studio album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue , released on 10 November 2003 by Parlophone . Following the massive commercial success of her eighth studio album Fever ( 2001 ) , Minogue enlisted a diverse group of writers and producers to aid in creating a new album , including Cathy Dennis , Dan Carey , <unk> Torrini , Johnny Douglas and Mantronix among others . Influenced by the musical works of the 1980s and artists like Prince and Scritti Politti , Body Language musically differs from Minogue 's previous albums , which mainly featured disco @-@ oriented dance @-@ pop tracks , and instead explores genres like synthpop , electroclash , R & B , and hip hop . Many tracks in Body Language contain references to songs from the 1980s and lyrically , the album touches upon themes of enjoyment , flirting , and sex . 
 Three singles were released from Body Language . " Slow " was released as the lead single in November 2003 and was a commercial success , peaking at number one on the singles charts of Australia , Denmark , Spain and the United Kingdom . " Red Blooded Woman " was released as the second single in March 2004 and reached the top five in Australia and the United Kingdom . " Chocolate " was released as the final single in June 2004 and peaked inside the top 10 in the United Kingdom . Minogue performed at a one @-@ off concert show held at entertainment venue Hammersmith Apollo , London , on 15 November 2003 to mark the release of the album . No tickets were publicly made available for sale and only fans with invitations were allowed to attend the show , which was entitled " Money Can 't Buy " . 
 Upon its release , Body Language received generally favourable to mixed reviews from music critics , many of whom complimented Minogue for experimenting with new genres and the overall production of the album . Some critics , however , opined that many songs lacked catchy material and were not suitable for dancing . Commercially , Body Language performed well , although it was not as successful as Fever . It peaked at number two on the albums chart of Australia and was certified double @-@ platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) . In the United Kingdom , Body Language peaked at number six and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) . Elsewhere , the album performed well in Austria and Switzerland . Body Language became notable for displaying another change in Minogue 's persona and is cited as an example of her numerous " reinventions " . 
 = = Background and development = = 
 In October 2001 , Minogue released her eighth studio album Fever . The disco and Europop @-@ influenced dance @-@ pop album became an international commercial success , debuting at number one on the record charts of Minogue 's native Australia and the United Kingdom . It was Minogue 's first album to be released in the United States since her second studio album Enjoy Yourself ( 1989 ) , and became her biggest commercial success in the region after peaking at number three on the Billboard 200 chart . Fever was certified seven @-@ times platinum in Australia by the Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) , five @-@ times platinum in the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) , and platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . With worldwide sales over six million copies , Fever became Minogue 's highest selling album to date . The success of the album , particularly in the US , was credited to the commercial impact of its lead single " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " , which reached number one in 40 countries , including every European country except Finland , and Australia and New Zealand . " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " sold over five million copies worldwide , becoming Minogue 's highest selling single to date and also one of the best @-@ selling singles of all time . 
 Soon , Minogue began work on her ninth studio album Body Language . Aiming to create a dance @-@ pop album inspired by electronic music from the 1980s , Minogue enlisted collaborators such as Cathy Dennis , Dan Carey , <unk> Torrini , Johnny Douglas and Mantronix . In an interview with VH1 , Minogue explained how 1980s music , had influenced her , saying : 
 " I first got into pop music in ' 81 , I 'd say . It was all about Prince , Adam [ and ] the Ants , that whole New Romantic period . Prior to that , it was the Jackson 5 , Donna Summer , and my dad 's records – the [ Rolling ] Stones and Beatles . The influence we used on Body Language was more mid- ' 80s , specifically Scritti Politti " 
 Talking further about Scritti Politti , a British post @-@ punk band , Minogue reminisced about her collaboration with the band 's frontman Green Gartside , who provides vocals on the track " Someday " , saying , " To this day I haven 't met him ! I left a message on his answering machine , saying , " Hi , it 's Kylie ! I just wanted to say thanks so much ! You sound brilliant ! " " After Dark " was co @-@ written by Dennis , who had previously co @-@ written " Can 't Get You Out of My Head " for Minogue . Torrini , who co @-@ wrote " Slow " , revealed how she was approached for writing the song , saying " It was like I had just accidentally walked into the line of fire with , " Hey ! You There ! It was all quite surreal . I still think Kylie 's people were trying to call Jamelia , and they just got the wrong number . It 'd be much more funny if that is how it actually happened " . The recording of Body Language took place during the summer of 2003 , in locations such as London , Ireland , and Spain . 
 = = Musical styles and lyrical content = = 
 Inspired by music from the 1980s , Body Language deviates from Minogue 's usual disco @-@ influenced dance @-@ pop style , evident on albums like Light Years ( 2000 ) and Fever , and instead explores genres like synthpop , electroclash , club and R & B. In comparison to her previous work , Body Language is a " slower @-@ burning record " and begins with the song " Slow " , a " minimal " and simple track which serves as a primary example of the synthpop @-@ styled production of the album . Adrien Begrand from PopMatters compared it to " More More More " , the opening track of Fever , saying " In contrast to the pulsating , hi @-@ hat driven dance beat of Fever 's " More More More " , Body Language gets off to a more understated start " . Other synthpop songs on the album include " Still Standing " and " Promises " , which make use of " buzzing , low synth lines driving the beats , and chord flourishes that sound straight out of 1984 " . The former track also displays influences of nu @-@ disco and club music . Many songs on Body Language are influenced by R & B and hip hop music , two genres Minogue newly experimented with on the album . " Red Blooded Woman " " blends the 1980s sound with an almost garage @-@ like beat " and contains a " Boy ! Boy ! " hook and " la la la " bridge . Critics felt its production was similar to that by American hip hop and R & B producer Timbaland . Elements of funk are also present and are notably clear on tracks like " Sweet Music " and " I Feel For You " . " Secret ( Take You Home ) " received considerable coverage as it features a " coquettish " rap section delivered by Minogue . Body Language also contains ballads such as the quiet storm @-@ influenced " Chocolate " and " Obsession " . Minogue 's vocal delivery on the album is mostly seductive and breathy in tone , such as in songs like " Slow " and " Chocolate " , although the track " Obsession " features raspy vocals . 
 Critics noted references and similarities to 1980s pop music throughout the album . Adrien Begrand from PopMatters found the hook of " Sweet Music " similar to those in songs by Prince and INXS . " Still Standing " was described by Helen Pidd from The Guardian as " a magnificent blend of Prince 's " Kiss " and Peter Gabriel 's " Sledgehammer " " . " Red Blooded Woman " contains a reference to British band Dead or Alive 's 1985 song " You Spin Me Round ( Like a Record ) " , in the line " You got me spinning round , round , round , round like a record " . The title of " I Feel For You " is the same as the 1979 / 1984 song by Prince and Chaka Khan , although it is not a cover of the song . " Secret ( Take You Home ) " directly refers to urban contemporary band Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam 's 1984 song " I Wonder If I Take You Home " , both in its title and refrain . The line of the song in which Minogue sings " don 't confuse emotions with the pleasure principle " also refers to American recording artist Janet Jackson 's 1987 song " The Pleasure Principle " . 
 Lyrically , Body Language touches upon themes like enjoyment , flirting , sex , and " partying like it 's 1987 all over again " . In an interview with VH1 , Minogue was asked why the lyrics on the album " sound more personal than they might have been a few years ago " , and she responded by saying " Some of that could be just chance ! I wrote lyrics that were intensely personal to me on an album a few years ago . Maybe people know me better now , and therefore , if a songwriter pitches me a song , they might tailor it [ to fit me ] . I get the lyrics of a tune and interpret them my way " . Although the lyrics of " Slow " seem like an invitation to the dance floor , Minogue revealed that " it 's about how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone [ you really like ] " . In " Sweet Music " , Minogue sings about the " magic of the modern singer / producer partnership " in lines like " I think we 're on to something / Your taste it mirrors mine / So hot and in the moment " and " Let 's make this demo right " . The song also makes use of double entendre in some lines . Similarly , " Chocolate " is " packed with saccharine innuendo " . " Secret ( Take You Home ) " contains various metaphors that compare flirting and sex to car racing . Ballads like " Obsession " deal with issues of loss and the ending of a relationship .

 Body Language was released on 14 November 2003 in Australia , while in the United Kingdom it was released three days later . In the United States , Body Language was released on 10 February 2004 . The cover art of the album , as well as other promotion shoots , show Minogue striking a pose in a black and white striped crop top , which reveals her midriff , and low @-@ cut pants . Her appearance is similar to that of French actress and singer Brigitte Bardot , who was regarded as the " first foreign @-@ language star ever to attain a level of international success comparable to America 's most popular homegrown talents " and one of the best known sex symbols of the 1950s and 1960s , frequently cited as the " archetypal sex kitten " and " sex goddess " . Minogue described the promotion shoots as " the perfect mix of coquette , kitten and rock ' n ' roll " , and revealed that " We shot it on location in the South of France , so it was [ easy to ] channel the spirit of [ Brigitte ] Bardot . She 's a great iconic reference , particularly that period where she was working with Serge Gainsbourg " . The title of the album was taken from a line from the song " Slow " in which Minogue sings " Read my body language " .

Chris True from AllMusic complimented Minogue for expanding her " horizons " and felt that the album was consistent and worked as a " piece " , calling it " stylish without being smarmy , retro without being ironic " . He favoured the overall production of the album and praised Minogue for displaying a " sense of class " , which he felt was lacking in the work of female artists like Britney Spears , Christina Aguilera , and Madonna ; he concluded by labelling Body Language a " near perfect pop record " and " what may well be the best album of her [ Minogue 's ] career " . Keith Caulfield from Billboard was also positive in his review and complimented Minogue for selecting a talented creative team , saying " The sexy , solid set is glued together by danceable beats and Minogue 's knack for picking great songs and producers . " The The Irish Times review of the song called the album a " worthy successor to 2001 's smash hit Fever , a supremely danceable collection of electro @-@ pop songs that 's clearly in thrall to the 80s " and complimented Minogue 's versatile vocal delivery . Ethan Brown from New York was greatly impressed by opening track " Slow " , and commented that most of the songs on the album " mimic its sound , none of the other songs on Body Language comes close to the achievement of " Slow " " . Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine felt Body Language was a better album than Fever , calling it " less immediate and more experimental , a midway point between the alternative / electronica of 1997 's Impossible Princess and Minogue 's more mainstream post @-@ millennium work " , and praised it for being cohesive . He also complimented Minogue 's " willingness to try something new – even if it 's within the confines of dance @-@ pop – is what 's made her an international sensation 15 years running " . Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone favoured the sensual nature of the album , calling it " fantastic " and that " At thirty @-@ five , she 's ten times hotter than she was ten years ago – on Body Language , Kylie Minogue definitely sounds like she has a few more tricks stored on her hard drive than Britney [ Spears ] or Christina [ Aguilera ] " . 
 Chris Willman from Entertainment Weekly called it Minogue 's " Madonna @-@ meets @-@ Mirwais move " and felt that her exploration of new genres is " ludicrously enjoyable " , although he opined that the album was " synthetic " and " all Body [ sic ] no soul " . Helen Pidd from The Guardian favoured the blend of 1980s musical styles on the album , but felt that it lacked danceable songs , saying " Problem is , as with the majority of other tracks – including , most disappointingly , the Dennis @-@ penned " After Dark " – you would be hard pushed to dance to it , which could well be Body Language 's downfall " . John Robinson from NME gave Body Language an overall positive review and called it " an extremely tastefully done , soulful modern r <unk> record " , but felt that it " fails to live up to its predecessor [ Fever ] " . Likewise , Adrien <unk> from PopMatters felt that Body Language lacked the " undeniably catchy " material which was present in Fever , but praised the overall production and the first half of the album ; he concluded that " Even though Body Language is a bit of a misstep for Minogue , there 's a sense of class to it " and that " Britney [ Spears ] could learn a thing or two " . The Spin review of the album commented that Minogue " wears the ' 80s well " and praised the dance @-@ oriented songs on the tracklist , although they criticised the ballads and pointed out that " [ at times ] Minogue 's vocals are so over @-@ processed that they barely seem to exist at all " . On the other hand , Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club opined that the ballads " work " and concluded that " Body Language shows Minogue as a surprisingly impressive presence in spurts , but she sounds better with her pleasure engine revving at full purr " .

 Although Body Language was not as much of a commercial success as Fever , it performed well nonetheless . In Minogue 's native Australia , Body Language entered and peaked at number two on the albums chart and spent a total of 18 weeks on the chart . The Australian Recording Industry Association ( ARIA ) certified the album double @-@ platinum for shipping 140 @,@ 000 units in the country . In the United Kingdom , the album entered and peaked at number six on the UK Albums Chart . It remained inside the top 10 for one week , and for two weeks in the top 20 . In total , it stayed on the chart for a total of 30 weeks . Body Language was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) for shipments of 300 @,@ 000 units . 
 Elsewhere , Body Language peaked at number 23 on the Austrian Albums Chart and was certified gold by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) for selling 7 @,@ 500 units . In the Dutch @-@ speaking Flanders region of Belgium , it peaked at number 10 on the Ultratop chart and spent a total of 17 weeks on the chart . It became Minogue 's first album to reach the top 10 in the region . Body Language entered and peaked at number eight on the Swiss Albums Chart , and spent a total of 17 weeks on the chart . In this region , the IFPI certified it gold for selling 20 @,@ 000 units . In the United States , Body Language debuted at number 42 on the Billboard 200 chart with " meagre " first @-@ week sales of 43 @,@ 000 units . According to Nielson SoundScan , Body Language had sold 177 @,@ 000 units in the US as of March 2011 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Following its release , Body Language was considered to be an example of Minogue 's constant " reinventions " . During this period , Minogue was often referred to as " Bardot Kylie " due to the Brigitte Bardot @-@ inspired look she sported on the cover , and Body Language was seen as a step forward from the " slick , minimalist and postmodern " image she had adopted during the release of Fever . Chris True from AllMusic regarded the album as " another successful attempt [ by Minogue ] at broadening her sound ( with electro and hip @-@ hop for instance ) and winning more fans " . Later in his review of Minogue 's tenth studio album X ( 2007 ) , he remarked that " By the time of 2004 's Body Language , Kylie Minogue was seemingly unassailable , with three hit albums , a number of hit singles , and a recharged career that only a few years before had seemed precarious at best " . In 2006 , Larissa Dubecki from The Age commented that " Kylie has beaten her early detractors by inhabiting almost a dozen identities , from the " singing budgie " who emerged from Neighbours to score her first hit single with a cover of the Little Eva classic " Locomotion " in 1987 , to the 1960s ingenue of her most recent album , 2003 's Body Language " . She used the title " Eurotrash princess " to describe Minogue during this period . 
 In 2004 , Minogue was nominated for " Best Female Artist " at the 18th Annual Australian Recording Industry Association Music Awards and Body Language was nominated for " Best Pop Release " . At the 2004 Brit Awards , the singer received her third @-@ consecutive nomination for " Best International Female Solo Artist " . At the 47th Grammy Awards ceremony held in the year 2005 , lead single " Slow " was nominated for " Best Dance Recording " , and in 2012 , Minogue picked the song as her all @-@ time favourite song from her 25 years in music .

 = Heather Mills = 
 Heather Anne Mills ( born 12 January 1968 ) is an English media personality . 
 Mills came to public attention in 1993 , when a collision with a police motorcycle in London resulted in the amputation of her left leg below the knee . She continued to model using a prosthetic limb and sold her story to a tabloid newspaper . 
 Her relationship with Sir Paul McCartney brought further public attention in the year 2000 . They married in June 2002 and Mills gave birth to Beatrice Milly McCartney on 28 October 2003 . The couple separated in 2006 and finalised their divorce in 2008 . 
 After her marriage to McCartney , Mills became involved in animal rights advocacy and as of 2012 is a patron of Viva ! ( Vegetarians ' International Voice for Animals ) and the Vegetarian and Vegan Foundation . She is also vice @-@ president of the Limbless Association and skied in the British disabled ski team 's development squad in 2013 
 = = Early life = = 
 Heather Mills was born in Aldershot , Hampshire , to John " Mark " Francis Mills , a former British paratrooper , and his wife , Beatrice Mary Mills , née Finlay , who was the daughter of a colonel in the British Army . Her father was adopted at age seven and grew up in Brighton , where his foster parents had a grocery shop , although his foster @-@ father also worked as a mechanic for a Grand Prix racing team . Her mother was born in India , during World War II , but was educated at English boarding schools . They met at Newcastle University , and were married against the wishes of Finlay 's father , who did not attend the wedding and only saw his daughter once more before he died . 
 Beatrice spoke several languages and played the piano , and Mark played banjo and guitar , liked photography ( winning an Evening Standard award ) , and took part in numerous sports . He was very fond of animals ( working for the RSPCA for a time ) , and Mills remembered her family always having a dog and a cat , as well as once having a pet goose and a white nanny goat that was allowed to roam the house owned by Mark 's parents in <unk> , near Brecon . 
 The Mills family spent their holidays in <unk> and also lived there for a time . When Mills was six years old , the family moved north to Alnwick , in Northumberland , but moved shortly after to a block of flats in Washington , Tyne and Wear , and then on to <unk> Farm , in Rothbury , Northumberland . She attended Usworth Grange Primary school , and then Usworth Comprehensive school in Washington . She visited Usworth Comprehensive in 2003 , as guest of honour at a prize @-@ giving event and to support the school against plans for its closure . 
 Mills later wrote that she was kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a swimming pool attendant when she was eight years old , but her next @-@ door neighbour , Margaret Ambler , who was sexually abused by the swimming pool attendant , alleged that Mills ' story was " nothing what she made it out to be " , that Mills was never a victim , and the pool attendant did not commit suicide , as Mills had written . Although having received a letter from Mills offering £ 10 @,@ 000 to stop a court case , Ambler complained that the story had caused her deep discomfort by bringing the incident to national attention , so she sued for breach of privacy , accepting an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement of £ 5 @,@ 000 in compensation , and £ 54 @,@ 000 legal costs . 
 Beatrice left home when Mills was nine years old , which left her , her older brother Shane , and her younger sister , Fiona , in the care of their father . Mills said that her father once threw her brother against a window for making a mess on the carpet with crayons . The window broke and her brother had to be taken to hospital , where their father explained that the boy had fallen on some glass in the garden . Fiona said : " Our family were always short of money and our father demanded that we find food and clothes so we turned to shoplifting , learnt to hide from the bailiffs and became experts at domestic duties . I ’ m not ashamed to say that we were forced to steal because when you are a young child , you ’ d rather do that than face a beating from your father " . ( Their father disputed his daughters ' allegations that he was violent towards them , later releasing home movies of family holidays in Wales , showing Mills playing happily ) . 
 = = London and modelling = = 
 When her father was jailed for 18 months after being convicted of fraud , she left home with her sister to live with her mother and partner ( Crossroads actor Charles Stapley ) , in Clapham , London , although her brother went to Brighton to live with his paternal grandparents . She later wrote that at the age of 15 she ran away to join a funfair , and then lived in a cardboard box under Waterloo Station for four months , although Stapley denied this by saying that she occasionally left home at weekends to travel with a young man who worked for a funfair in London . During her stated period of homelessness , her school records indicate that she and her sister were both enrolled at Usworth comprehensive in Tyne and Wear until April 1983 , and then at <unk> Comprehensive , in Balham , on 6 June 1983 , where they both stayed until 2 July 1984 . She remembered that a teacher at the <unk> once said , " there 's no hope for her at all " , and that she left school with no academic qualifications . In the same year , her father had another daughter , Claire Mills , with a new partner . Mills worked for a croissant shop , but was sacked , and vowed " never to work for anyone else again " . She later wrote that the owner of a jewellery shop in Clapham gave her a job on Saturdays , but Jim Guy , the owner of Penrose Jewellers , later stated : " Everything she wrote about me was lies , I never gave her a job ; she just hung around and made tea . She told me her father was dead . The only thing that was true was she nicked stuff from the shop " , which Guy said was worth £ 20 @,@ 000 . She admitted that she had stolen some gold chains and sold them to buy a moped , and when Guy reported the theft , she was put on probation . 
 Alfie Karmal ( the son of a Palestinian father and Greek mother ) was ten years older than Mills when they met in 1986 . Karmal bought her new clothes and Cartier jewellery , and paid for cosmetic surgery when she complained that her breasts were sagging . She later said that she had had a breast reduction operation , reducing her bra size from a <unk> to a <unk> so Karmal , who had moved into the computer industry , set up a model agency for her , <unk> Management , although it was not successful . In 1987 , Mills went to live in Paris , telling Karmal that a cosmetics company had given her a modelling contract , but became the mistress of millionaire Lebanese businessman George Kazan for two years and took part in a photo session for a stills @-@ only German sex education manual called Die Freuden der Liebe ( The Joys of Love ) . She also modelled for full @-@ frontal nude photographs . 
 After returning to London , Mills asked Karmal to marry her . Karmal said yes , but on one condition : " I told her I couldn 't marry her until she did something about her compulsive lying , and she agreed to see a psychiatrist for eight weeks . She admitted she had a problem and said it was because she 'd been forced to lie as a child by her father " . Although Mills proposed to Karmal , she later said that every man she has been out with " has asked me to marry him within a week " . While married to Karmal , she suffered two ectopic pregnancies , so Karmal paid for her to go on holiday to Croatia with his children and ex @-@ wife ( with whom Mills had become friends ) in 1990 , but Mills ended up living with her ski instructor , Miloš <unk> , shortly before the Croatian War began . Mills then set up a refugee crisis centre in London , helping over 20 people to escape the war . She drove by herself to deliver donations to Croatia , taking modelling assignments in Austria on the way to pay for the trip , later saying that she " worked on the front line in a war zone in the former Yugoslavia for two years where there were mines everywhere that weren 't marked " . Karmal and Mills were divorced and Mills was later engaged to Raffaele <unk> ( a bond dealer for the Industrial Bank of Japan ) in 1993 . 
 = = Accident and amputees = = 
 On 8 August 1993 , Mills and <unk> walked to the corner of De Vere Gardens and Kensington Road , London , but while crossing Kensington Road , Mills was knocked down by a police motorcycle ( the last in a convoy of three ) , which was responding to an emergency call . Mills suffered crushed ribs , a punctured lung , and the loss of her left leg 6 inches below the knee ; a metal plate was later attached to her pelvis . In October 1993 , she had another operation which further shortened her leg . Mills was awarded £ 200 @,@ 000 by the police authority as recompense for her injuries , even though the police motorcyclist , PC Osbourne , was later cleared by magistrates of driving without due care and attention . After the accident , Mills sold her story to the News of the World , and gave other interviews , saying she earned £ 180 @,@ 000 . She used the money to set up the Heather Mills Health Trust ( existed 2000 – 2004 ) which delivered prosthetic limbs to people , particularly children , who had lost limbs after stepping on landmines . Mills often shows people her prosthetic leg , once taking it off during an interview on the American talk show Larry King Live , in 2002 . 
 Mills booked herself into the Hippocrates Health Institute in Florida , which put her on a raw food vegan diet , using wheat grass and garlic poultices to heal her wound . After an operation , Mills discovered that she had been previously identified as having an O rhesus negative blood type , when in fact she was A rhesus negative , which had interfered with her attempts to follow the so @-@ called blood type diet . As her prosthetic leg had to be replaced on a regular basis ( because the size of the amputated stump kept changing as it healed ) , she had the idea to collect thousands of discarded prosthetic limbs for amputees in Croatia . Mills persuaded the Brixton prison governor to get inmates to dismantle and pack the prosthetic limbs before being transported , which resulted in 22 @,@ 000 amputees obtaining limbs in addition to the Croatian citizens who were already supplied with prosthetic limbs by the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance , which paid for the fitting of limbs and rehabilitation of patients . The first convoy of limbs arrived in Zagreb in October 1994 and Mills travelled with the convoy to film interviews with some of the recipients for the Good Morning with Anne and Nick daytime TV show . She received an award in 2001 from Croatia 's prime minister for the money she raised to help clear that country of landmines . 
 With the help of ghostwriter Pamela Cockerill , Mills wrote a book about her experience titled Out on a Limb ( 1995 ) , which was republished in the United States as A Single Step ( 2002 ) . Extracts from Out on a Limb were serialised in The Daily Mail in March 2000 . Mills handed all the proceeds from the book to Adopt @-@ A @-@ Minefield , and stated that it was one of " the few charities that 100 % of their donations goes to clear minefields and survivor assistance " . In 1995 , Mills got engaged to British media executive Marcus Stapleton , after being together for only 16 days , and was then engaged to respected documentary filmmaker Chris Terrill in 1999 , after only 12 days in Cambodia , where they were making a film about landmines . Mills ended their relationship five days before their planned wedding day , later telling friends in the media that she had called the wedding off because Terrill was gay , an MI6 agent , and that his mission was to sabotage her anti @-@ landmine work . Terrill had once told Mills that he had been interviewed by the intelligence services when he was thinking of a career with the Foreign Office , but later said , " I soon realised that Heather [ Mills ] had a somewhat elastic relationship with the truth , which she was able to stretch impressively sometimes " . Terrill also claims that although Mills said she was a vegetarian at the time , she often cooked her speciality dish , Lancashire hotpot , which contains lamb , for him ; and her ex sister @-@ in @-@ law , Dianna Karmal , claims that Mills only became a vegetarian after meeting McCartney . 
 In 2003 , the Open University awarded her an honorary doctorate for her philanthropic work on behalf of amputees . She continues to campaign , in addition to promoting the distribution of prostheses around the world and has been involved with the development of the Heather Mills McCartney <unk> , which gives amputees in America the chance to wear a Dorset Orthopaedic <unk> , without having to travel to the UK . Mills is also vice @-@ president of the Limbless Association . In 2004 , she received a " Children in Need " award from the annual International Charity Gala in Düsseldorf and in the same year , the University of California , Irvine , gave her their 2004 Human Security Award and created the Heather Mills McCartney Fellowship in Human Security to support graduate students conducting research on pressing human security issues . She is a former Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Association Adopt @-@ A @-@ Minefield programme .

 Mills met McCartney at the Dorchester Hotel , during the Pride of Britain Awards event in April 1999 , which McCartney had attended to present an award to an animal rights activist . Mills presented the Outstanding Bravery Award to Helen Smith ; also making an appeal on behalf of the Heather Mills Health Trust . McCartney also presented an award dedicated to his late wife , Linda McCartney . McCartney talked to Mills about donating to her charity – later giving her £ 150 @,@ 000 . In the autumn of 1999 , Mills and her sister recorded " VO ! CE " ; a song they wrote to raise funds for Mills ' charity , with McCartney agreeing to sing backing vocals . After recording the song in Greece ( where Mills ' sister lived , running the independent label Coda Records ) , the sisters stayed overnight at McCartney 's estate in Peasmarsh , Sussex , in early November , where McCartney added vocals to the song . Having sparked the interest of the tabloids about his appearances with Mills at events , McCartney appeared publicly beside her at a party in January 2000 to celebrate her 32nd birthday . 
 While on holiday in the Lake District , McCartney proposed to Mills on 23 July 2001 , giving her a £ 15 @,@ 000 diamond and sapphire ring he had purchased in Jaipur , India , while they were both there on holiday . 
 = = = Marriage = = = 
 Mills and McCartney were married on 11 June 2002 , four years after McCartney 's first wife had died of breast cancer . The McCartney – Mills wedding was an elaborate ceremony at Castle Leslie ( once the home of Shane Leslie ) , in the village of Glaslough in County Monaghan , Ireland . A song specially composed by McCartney , called " Heather " , was played , which had been included on the 2001 album , Driving Rain . 
 Mills said that she liked to cook traditional ( but meat @-@ free ) Christmas dinners for McCartney and as many of his family as possible , and that McCartney had encouraged her to give up her self @-@ confessed addiction to chocolate and Snickers bars . When asked by chat @-@ show host Larry King ( in 2003 ) , how life was with McCartney , Mills replied " Great , really great , " but also said that she was surprised at how tidy McCartney was : " He always cleans up before the cleaner comes . So I said for a while that 's crazy , but what 's good is if I cook the dinner , he 'll clean everything up . " 
 In 2003 , McCartney played a concert in Red Square , Russia . Vladimir Putin gave the couple a tour of the Kremlin . McCartney later said that Mills ' contribution was giving him an acrylic fingernail to protect a finger on his left hand that often bled after playing guitar . McCartney admitted that Mills inspired him , as " Being in love with her makes me want to write songs " , such as " Too Much Rain " on Chaos and Creation in the Backyard , and " See Your Sunshine " ( " She makes me feel glad / I want her so bad " ) from Memory Almost Full . Another composition inspired by Mills was used as the bridal march at their wedding . 
 During a Parkinson chat show on 22 February 2003 , host Michael Parkinson asked if it was because of McCartney that Mills did not give any interviews , and she replied that she wanted to protect McCartney , his children , and their privacy . On the same show she said that her previous ectopic pregnancies had damaged her fertility , and that her chances of getting pregnant were small , although the couple announced that they were expecting their first child in May 2003 . Mills gave birth to Beatrice Milly McCartney on 28 October 2003 , who was named after Mills ' mother , and McCartney 's aunt . It was later revealed that Mills had suffered a miscarriage in the first year of marriage to McCartney . Mills was invited by Larry King to interview Paul Newman , which was broadcast by CNN on 17 April 2004 . McCartney had arranged for Newman to be interviewed by Mills , but critical reactions to the show were mixed . Mills appeared on other TV programmes , such as BBC1 's Question Time and GMTV , and persuaded McCartney to join her on ITV 's Who Wants To Be A Millionaire ? 
 = = = = Split = = = = 
 After some time apart , Mills and McCartney separated on 17 May 2006 . In November 2007 , Mills gave a number of interviews , saying that the breakdown of the marriage was caused by her husband 's daughter , Stella , whom she described as " jealous " and " evil " . Mills had previously talked with New York magazine , saying Stella had once issued a press release confirming how much she liked her new stepmother , although Stella 's publicist denied that such a statement had ever been issued . 
 After dismissing Anthony Julius , a <unk> de <unk> lawyer , Mills stated she would represent herself in the upcoming divorce hearing , with help from her sister Fiona , David Rosen ( a solicitor @-@ advocate ) , and Michael <unk> , an American attorney . In leaked documents , Mills complained that McCartney was often drunk , smoked cannabis , stabbed her with a broken wine glass , pushed her over a table , and pushed her into a bathtub when she was pregnant . Referring to her part in the marriage , Mills said that she had been a full @-@ time wife , mother , lover , confidante , business partner and psychologist to McCartney . McCartney 's lawyers studied Mills ' book : Life Balance : The Essential Keys to a Lifetime of Wellbeing ( published on 25 May 2006 ) , as it contradicted many of her claims , such as when she praised McCartney for " Bringing me breakfast in bed every morning , no matter how he feels , and I do the dinner , so we ’ ve got that agreement . It ’ s thoughtfulness " . Mills ' father reconciled with his daughter after meeting her and McCartney , when they introduced him to his granddaughter , Beatrice . After their separation , he said that it " took guts to represent yourself at the High Court " , and that he was proud of his daughter , even though he thought she would be " torn to shreds " by McCartney 's lawyers . 
 = = = Divorce = = = 
 The case was heard in court 34 at the Royal Courts of Justice in London . At the start of the proceedings Mills asked for £ 125 million , but McCartney offered £ 15 @.@ 8 million . Before the court case , Mills had employed the accountancy firm Lee and Allen to examine McCartney 's publishing company , business assets and properties , saying that she had a tape recording of McCartney admitting his true worth , but the presiding judge , Mr Justice Bennett , turned down numerous requests for information by Lee and Allen . 
 The hearing took six days , finishing on 18 February 2008 , with the judgment being made public on 17 March 2008 . Mills was eventually awarded a lump sum of £ <unk> , together with assets of £ <unk> , which included the properties she owned at the time . The total was £ 24 @.@ 3 million , plus payments of £ 35 @,@ 000 per annum , for a nanny and school costs for their daughter . In his judgment , Justice Bennett stated : " The husband 's evidence was , in my judgment , balanced . He expressed himself moderately though at times with justifiable irritation , if not anger . He was consistent , accurate and honest . But I regret to have to say I cannot say the same about the wife 's evidence . Having watched and listened to her give evidence , having studied the documents , and having given in her favour every allowance for the enormous strain she must have been under ( and in conducting her own case ) I am driven to the conclusion that much of her evidence , both written and oral , was not just inconsistent and inaccurate but also less than candid . Overall she was a less than impressive witness . " The divorce was granted on 12 May 2008 , and the preliminary divorce decree was finalised six weeks later . She later considered trying to have the injunction lifted that stopped her talking publicly about the case , as the sections released were against her wishes , saying that it would " perhaps be better for the public to see everything " . 
 Long before the decision , Mills talked about McCartney : " I will never get over it . I will always love Paul . He is the father of my child , but I just have to move on and deal with it and there is nothing I can do ... I have never spoken badly about my husband . I never will , he is the father of my child " . After the judgement was issued , however , she said to the press , " I can 't say if Paul is cruel . For the sake of my daughter , I can 't say that but my sister thinks he is . " This statement to the press was accompanied by her sister , Fiona Mills , saying " I just think he didn 't need to put her through this . I just think it is really sad . Why can 't he look after the mother of his child ? " She continued , " He wants to make himself look good , " she said . " To him the most important person is him . It has been a nightmare and I am not exaggerating . " 
 During their marriage she was known as Heather Mills McCartney , but after her divorce she reverted to Heather Mills , although she should still be correctly referred to as Lady McCartney ; as the former wife of a knight , she technically retains that title . She was addressed as such by Lord Justice Leveson , during the Leveson Inquiry . 
 = = Media image and criticism = = 
 Mills ' relationship with McCartney triggered considerable media interest , but after her divorce , the attitude of the British media was hostile . Mills frequently accuses the press of misquoting her , and of using material out of context to give a negative impression of her , telling the Evening Standard that the claims that she had married McCartney for his money were more hurtful than losing her leg . 
 Mills has been accused by several newspapers of having embellished her life story . A journalist with the same name , Heather Mills , then at The Observer , accused Mills of impersonating her for over a year in the late 1990s , showing people cuttings of articles the journalist had written , which helped Mills secure a job presenting The General , a BBC TV programme about Southampton General Hospital . There were also doubts about Mills ' claim that she had been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize ( because the Heather Mills Health Trust had given away thousands of prosthetic limbs to landmine victims ) , but the nomination cannot yet be proven because the identities of all nominees remain secret for 50 years . 
 <unk> ( Mills ' stepfather ) disputed Mills ' statement that her mother had nearly lost a leg in a car crash , after Mills said , " her leg was only hanging on by a tiny flap of skin and flesh ... miraculously the surgeons managed to insert a metal plate and reattach it " . <unk> said that Mills ' mother had suffered a leg injury after a car crash , but recovered and was " a keen tennis player " and that Mills , " is simply a very confused woman for whom reality and fantasy have become blurred " . 
 Mills said that she had once been asked to stand for parliament by the three main political parties , and had been offered a peerage in 2001 ( to become Baroness Mills ) by the then British Prime Minister , Tony Blair , and a certain " Lord Macdonald " . An ITV documentary ( McCartney vs McCartney : The Ex Files ) interviewed three Lord Macdonalds , but not one of them could remember ever meeting Mills . British journalist Jasper Gerard , to whom Mills made the claims , also says she told him that she had cancelled a meeting with Bill Clinton in case her endorsement affected a US election outcome . Mills stated that she was once awarded the Outstanding Young Person of the Year award by the British Chambers of Commerce , but did not challenge newspapers after they discovered there was no such award . 
 In October 2006 , Mills announced her intention to sue The Daily Mail , The Sun and the Evening Standard . All the newspapers said that their stories " were obtained by proper methods and in accordance with good journalistic practice " . The Sun , which regularly refers to Mills as " <unk> " – a play on McCartney 's nickname " Macca " – responded by asking her to " tick the boxes " on a series of allegations the newspaper had made , stating , " It is not clear what exactly she plans to sue us about " . Underneath the questions , The Sun listed six allegations about her , with a blank box beside each one . The words beside the boxes read : " Hooker , Liar , Porn Star , <unk> , Trouble Maker , <unk> " . 
 In December 2006 , Mills told the BBC that she had received death threats , and on 17 December 2006 , police stated that a " non @-@ specific threat " had been made to her safety . This led to more criticism that she was calling out the emergency services too often . In March 2007 , Kevin Moore , Chief Superintendent of Sussex Police , said that Mills was running " the risk of being treated as the little boy who cried wolf " , and added , " We do have to respond to a disproportionate high volume of calls from Heather Mills McCartney because of the situations she finds herself in , and this is regrettable as it takes officers away from other policing matters " . Mills responded that the police had told her to contact them whenever she was being harassed . 
 During a 5 @-@ day trial in July 2007 , it was revealed that Mills had been physically assaulted by Jay Kaycappa in Brighton . Kaycappa was a notorious paparazzo trying to photograph Mills while on shifts for a national newspaper and a regional press agency . Kaycappa , who had 132 previous criminal convictions , including perverting the course of justice , obtaining property by deception , driving offences and using ten aliases , was found guilty and sentenced to a 140 @-@ hour community order and ordered to pay Mills £ 100 , plus £ 1 @,@ 000 court costs . 
 During several interviews in October 2007 , Mills accused the media of giving her " worse press than a paedophile or a murderer " . She also criticised the media over the treatment of Diana , Princess of Wales – who , according to Mills , was " chased and killed " by paparazzi – and of Kate McCann . Immediately before giving these interviews , her PR adviser , Phil Hall ( the ex @-@ Editor of the News of the World ) , quit . In 2008 , a survey commissioned by Marketing magazine showed Mills as one of the top five most hated celebrity women , along with Amy Winehouse , Victoria Beckham and Kerry Katona . 
 In December 2008 , the Channel 4 television comedy series Star Stories broadcast a satirical mockumentary of Mills ' life story from her point of view . In 2009 , after petitioning the Press Complaints Commission in the UK about being lied about in the press , five British tabloids ( The Sun , The Daily Express , News of the World , Sunday Mirror and Daily Mirror ) publicly apologised to Mills about printing false , hurtful or defamatory stories about her . Another tabloid ( the Daily Mail ) , sent a private letter of apology . Mills has complained that over 4 @,@ 400 abusive articles about her have been published .

 In 2002 , Mills accepted damages of £ 50 @,@ 000 plus costs from the Sunday Mirror , after a false report that the Charity Commission had investigated her about the money she raised for the Indian earthquake victims appeal in 2001 . The extent and nature of the British press coverage of Mills has been criticised , as in May 2003 , when Guardian columnist Matt Seaton wrote a piece declaring " There is little that is edifying in the symbolic lynching of Heather . The poisonous <unk> that drives it is in the worst tradition of small town gossip . It is prurient , spiteful , hypocritical , and we should cry ' shame ' on it " . Publicist Mark Borkowski wrote in the Independent on Sunday , on 23 March 2008 : " Not since the cult of Myra Hindley have we encountered so much vitriol aimed at one woman " . Feminist writer Natasha Walter has compared the coverage to that of Britney Spears . Terence Blacker wrote that public figures who are young , female , pretty and fair @-@ haired , are often subjected to public bullying which is explained as " intense media interest " , such as Diana , Princess of Wales , Paula Yates , Ulrika Jonsson and Mills . 
 Kira Cochrane , in The Guardian , said that " every misogynist epithet available " has been used against Mills . " She has somehow become the vessel through which it is acceptable for both pundits and the public to express their very worst feelings about women " . Joan Smith , writing in The Independent , said that newspaper " Bullies love a weakling " ; quoting the Daily Mirror 's front page headline : " Lady Liar " and The Sun newspaper writing " <unk> " over Mills ' face ( in reference to Pinocchio 's nose getting longer when he lied and her past photographs ) . Smith went on to say that Mills had " dreamt of becoming the wife of a famous man but did not realise that he had fantasies of his own , marrying an attractive younger woman when he hadn 't got over the loss of his first wife . Mills behaved foolishly when the marriage failed but she does not deserve the treatment she has had in the mass @-@ market press . It is merciless bullying of an unstable , vulnerable woman " . In 2009 , Mills reported a bogus charity had been set up to extract information about her marriage . News Corp , owned by Rupert Murdoch , is alleged to have set up the sting . The British tabloid newspaper the Daily Mirror ran the headline " Macca marriage to Heather was mistake of the decade " following an interview McCartney gave to Q magazine . McCartney immediately moved to deny this statement and then went on to publicly print the original transcript on his official website to prove the Daily Mirror article was false . 
 Celia Larkin , writing on 12 February 2012 in the Irish Sunday Independent , said " There was something very satisfying about Heather Mills finally having her voice heard above the roar of the Red Tops . If you actually take the time to listen to Mills , I mean listen , not just read what 's written about her , you 'll see she is a strong , sincere , independent woman . She didn 't lie down under the weight of McCartney 's fame and wealth , she continued to plough her own furrow , campaigning for her charities , maintaining a strong individuality . And that , it seems , is the greatest sin of all . Is it any wonder she was reduced to tears in the October 2007 GMTV interview ? Did we feel sympathy for her then ? No . ' Heather Mills has Melt Down ' screamed the headlines , so now she had lost her marbles to boot . And if that wasn 't enough , Carole Malone of the Sunday Mirror , one of the papers that was relentless in its attacks on Mills , accused her of staging an act on live TV in order to further her cause in the upcoming divorce hearing . How cruel can you get ? " 
 = = = Phone hacking and Leveson Inquiry = = = 
 On 5 May 2011 , The Guardian reported that Mills had met with officers from the London Metropolitan Police who showed her evidence , seized from private investigator Glenn <unk> , which could form the basis of a claim against the News of the World for breach of privacy over alleged phone hacking . Mills ' name and private mobile phone number were listed in <unk> 's notes along with those of her friends and associates . Mills later alleged that a journalist working for the Mirror Group had admitted to her in 2001 that he had hacked her phone . 
 Appearing as a witness at the Leveson Inquiry on 9 February 2012 , Mills was asked under oath if she had ever made a recording of Paul McCartney 's phone calls or answer phone messages and had ever played it to Piers Morgan or " anybody else " , she replied , " Never , ever . " Giving evidence in December 2011 , Morgan , who bragged in a newspaper column for the Daily Mail in 2006 about hearing the message , refused to say who had played him the recorded message of the call , saying he was protecting a source . Mills told the inquiry that Morgan was " a man that has written nothing but awful things about me for years and would have relished telling the inquiry if I had played a personal voicemail message to him . " In the official findings of his Inquiry , Lord Justice Leveson said Morgan 's testimony under oath on phone hacking was " utterly unpersuasive . This was not , in any sense at all , a convincing answer " and " What it does , however , clearly prove is that he was aware that it was taking place in the press as a whole and that he was sufficiently unembarrassed by what was criminal behaviour that he was prepared to joke about it . " ( see the testimony : [ 1 ] ) 
 = = Activism = = 
 In 2005 , Mills became a patron of the British animal rights organisation Viva ! , and the Vegetarian and Vegan Foundation , which are both run by Juliet <unk> . In 2006 , Mills and <unk> attended a debate on fur at the Oxford Union , where she presented a video depicting the skinning of a dog . She posed with her own dog in an anti @-@ fur advertisement for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) , which read : " If you wouldn 't wear your dog , please don 't wear fur " . 
 In March 2006 , Mills and McCartney travelled to Canada to bring attention to the country 's annual seal hunt . Sponsored by the Humane Society of the United States , they complained that the hunt was inhumane , and called on the Canadian government to put an end to it . Their arrival on the floes sparked much attention in Newfoundland and Labrador , where 90 per cent of the sealers live . Mills and McCartney protested against seals being clubbed to death , pierced with boat hooks and sometimes skinned alive . Newfoundland and Labrador 's Premier , Danny Williams , debated the issue with them on Larry King Live , the issue being that seals are no longer hunted that way , and have not been for a while . Mills joined a Viva ! film team at a pig farm in Somerset , in February 2007 , to publicise the use of restrictive farrowing crates , which are used for sows who are suckling piglets . A video of the investigation was made available on the Internet . 
 Mills 's relationship with PETA ended in 2007 , when McCartney 's daughter , Mary , said she would not continue to take photographs for the organisation if Mills was involved with them . A PETA representative told the New York Post : " Heather 's exposé of the Chinese fur industry remains one of the most popular videos on our site , but we don 't have any imminent campaigns planned with her " . 
 Mills spoke in Hyde Park , London , on 19 November 2007 . Mills said : " Eighty per cent of global warming comes from livestock and deforestation . I 'm not telling people to go vegan overnight . But if they stop drinking their cows ' milk lattes , maybe this sort of thing won 't have to happen " . 
 In 2008 , an old video surfaced of Mills wearing a mink coat she had owned in 1989 , but explained to reporters that she had bought it years before becoming involved in animal rights organisations or vegetarianism . Although she had separated from McCartney , Mills said : " It 's only since I met Paul [ McCartney ] that I really got to understand how vegetarianism not only benefits your health massively but also makes a huge difference to the planet , to animals , and to feeding the world . " In August 2008 , she was honoured by the organisation Farm Animal Rights Movement ( <unk> ) , with the Celebrity Animal Activist Award , presented at the Animal Rights National Conference . On 28 August 2009 , at the Celebrity <unk> event in Hollywood , Mills showed off her new " recycled clothes from charity shops " range , called Be @ one . After her divorce , Mills pledged to give a " large portion " of her £ 24 @.@ 3 million divorce settlement to Adopt @-@ A @-@ Minefield , but the charity has not received any to date . In June 2008 , Mills was asked to talk at a New York party about the cruelty of puppy farms and to promote her book about animals , but was angry about the guests speaking over her speech , saying : " Listen up at the back . I haven ’ t been up for 24 hours and flew here from London to be ignored " . Mills 's publicist of four years , Michele <unk> , stopped representing her on 25 July 2008 . 
 = = Commercial interests = = 
 On 4 July 2009 , Mills opened a vegan restaurant called VBites at Hove Lagoon , Hove , Sussex . Mills is quoted as saying that she intends it to be the first in a worldwide chain of vegan restaurants . Whilst promoting the restaurant , Mills gave an interview to the BBC , stating that she 'd been very proactive in the building stages and now that it was open , would give as much time to it as she could – working it around her charity work . In May 2013 she sold the restaurant premises to local record producer Fatboy Slim and opened a new , enlarged VBites in East Street in Brighton . 
 In 2009 , Mills bought the vegan food company VBites Foods ( then known as Redwood Foods ) . The company in Corby , Northamptonshire , sells 50 meat @-@ free products under the brand names Cheatin ' , <unk> and <unk> . In 2014 products sold under the brand " Wot no Dairy " were recalled , because it was revealed that they contained traces of dairy and were dangerous for those with dairy intolerance . 
 Mills was one of the celebrity performers competing on the US television series Dancing with the Stars in 2007 , with dancing partner Jonathan Roberts . On 21 December 2009 , she was revealed as one of the contestants on the fifth series of Dancing on Ice , being paired with Matt Evers .

 On 4 June 2010 , a claim for compensation alleging sexual and maternity discrimination and unfair dismissal was brought by Sara Trumble , who had been employed as a nanny for Mills ' daughter since April 2004 .

Employment judge Steven <unk> said that " Mills ' kindness towards Miss Trumble showed that she genuinely cared about her as both an employee and a friend " .

 = SM UB @-@ 13 = 
 SM UB @-@ 13 was a German Type UB I submarine or U @-@ boat in the German Imperial Navy ( German : Kaiserliche Marine ) during World War I. The submarine was probably sunk by a British mine net in April 1916 . 
 UB @-@ 13 was ordered in October 1914 and was laid down at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen in November . UB @-@ 13 was a little under 28 metres ( 92 ft ) in length and displaced between 127 and 141 tonnes ( 125 and 139 long tons ) , depending on whether surfaced or submerged . She carried two torpedoes for her two bow torpedo tubes and was also armed with a deck @-@ mounted machine gun . UB @-@ 13 was broken into sections and shipped by rail to Antwerp for reassembly . She was launched in March 1915 and commissioned as SM UB @-@ 13 in April . 
 UB @-@ 13 spent her entire career in the Flanders Flotilla and sank 11 merchant ships , about half of them British fishing vessels . In March 1916 , UB @-@ 13 was responsible for sinking the Dutch ocean liner Tubantia , raising the ire of the Dutch public . Tubantia was the largest neutral vessel sunk during the war and among the 30 largest ships sunk by U @-@ boats . On 24 April 1916 , UB @-@ 13 was sunk with all hands . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 After the German Army 's rapid advance along the North Sea coast in the earliest stages of World War I , the German Imperial Navy found itself without suitable submarines that could be operated in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders . Project 34 , a design effort begun in mid @-@ August 1914 , produced the Type UB I design : a small submarine that could be shipped by rail to a port of operations and quickly assembled . Constrained by railroad size limitations , the UB I design called for a boat about 28 metres ( 92 ft ) long and displacing about 125 tonnes ( 123 long tons ) with two torpedo tubes . 
 UB @-@ 13 was part of the initial allotment of seven submarines — numbered UB @-@ 9 to UB @-@ 15 — ordered on 15 October from AG Weser of Bremen , just shy of two months after planning for the class began . UB @-@ 13 was laid down by Weser in Bremen on 7 November . As built , UB @-@ 13 was 27 @.@ 88 metres ( 91 ft 6 in ) long , 3 @.@ 15 metres ( 10 ft 4 in ) abeam , and had a draft of 3 @.@ 03 metres ( 9 ft 11 in ) . She had a single 59 @-@ brake @-@ horsepower ( 44 kW ) Körting 4 @-@ cylinder diesel engine for surface travel , and a single 119 @-@ shaft @-@ horsepower ( 89 kW ) Siemens @-@ Schuckert electric motor for underwater travel , both attached to a single propeller shaft . Her top speeds were 7 @.@ 45 knots ( 13 @.@ 80 km / h ; 8 @.@ 57 mph ) , surfaced , and 6 @.@ 24 knots ( 11 @.@ 56 km / h ; 7 @.@ 18 mph ) , submerged . At more moderate speeds , she could sail up to 1 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 2 @,@ 800 km ; 1 @,@ 700 mi ) on the surface before refueling , and up to 45 nautical miles ( 83 km ; 52 mi ) submerged before recharging her batteries . Like all boats of the class , UB @-@ 13 was rated to a diving depth of 50 metres ( 160 ft ) , and could completely submerge in 33 seconds . 
 UB @-@ 13 was armed with two 45 @-@ centimeter ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedoes in two bow torpedo tubes . She was also outfitted for a single 8 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun on deck . UB @-@ 13 's standard complement consisted of one officer and thirteen enlisted men . 
 After work on UB @-@ 13 was complete at the Weser yard , she was readied for rail shipment . The process of shipping a UB I boat involved breaking the submarine down into what was essentially a knock down kit . Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway flatcars . In February 1915 , the sections of UB @-@ 13 were shipped to Antwerp for assembly in what was typically a two- to three @-@ week process . After UB @-@ 13 was assembled and launched on 8 March , she was loaded on a barge and taken through canals to Bruges where she underwent trials . 
 = = Early career = = 
 The submarine was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy as SM UB @-@ 13 on 6 April 1915 under the command of Oberleutnant zur See Walter Gustav Becker , a 29 @-@ year @-@ old first @-@ time U @-@ boat commander . On 26 April , UB @-@ 13 joined the Flanders Flotilla ( German : U @-@ boote des Marinekorps U @-@ Flotille Flandern ) , which had been organized on 29 March . When UB @-@ 13 joined the flotilla , Germany was in the midst of its first submarine offensive , begun in February . During this campaign , enemy vessels in the German @-@ defined war zone ( German : Kriegsgebiet ) , which encompassed all waters around the United Kingdom , were to be sunk . Vessels of neutral countries were not to be attacked unless they definitively could be identified as enemy vessels operating under a false flag . 
 Submarines of the Flanders Flotilla sank over 14 @,@ 000 tons of merchant vessels in June 1915 , and UB @-@ 13 's first ship sunk , Dulcie , contributed almost one @-@ seventh of that total . The British steamer Dulcie , listed at 2 @,@ 033 gross register tons ( GRT ) , was headed from Dunston for Le Havre with a load of coal when Becker torpedoed her 6 nautical miles ( 11 km ; 6 @.@ 9 mi ) east of Aldeburgh . One man on Dulcie lost his life in the attack . Dulcie was the only ship sunk by UB @-@ 13 in June . 
 On 27 and 28 July , Becker and UB @-@ 13 sank three British fishing vessels while patrolling between 15 and 30 nautical miles ( 28 and 56 km ; 17 and 35 mi ) off Lowestoft . All three of the sunken ships were smacks — sailing vessels traditionally rigged with red ochre sails — which were stopped , boarded by crewmen from UB @-@ 16 , and sunk with explosives . 
 In response to American demands after German submarines had sunk the Cunard Line steamer Lusitania in May 1915 and other high profile sinkings in August and September , the chief of the Admiralstab , Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff , issued orders suspending the first offensive on 18 September . His directive ordered all U @-@ boats out of the English Channel and the South @-@ Western Approaches and required that all submarine activity in the North Sea be conducted strictly along prize regulations . On 20 February 1916 , under the command of Kapitänleutnant Karl Neumann , who replaced Becker in December 1915 , UB @-@ 13 captured a Belgian ship named Z10 David Marie and retained her as a prize . There are no further details about where Z10 David Marie was taken or her final disposition , but other ships captured as prizes by Flanders boats were sailed into Zeebrugge by prize crews . 
 = = Second submarine offensive = = 
 By early 1916 , the British blockade of Germany was beginning to have an effect on Germany and her imports . The Royal Navy had stopped and seized more cargo destined for Germany than the quantity of cargo sunk by German U @-@ boats in the first submarine offensive . As a result , the German Imperial Navy began a second offensive against merchant shipping on 29 February . The final ground rules agreed upon by the German Admiralstab were that all enemy vessels in Germany 's self @-@ proclaimed war zone would be destroyed without warning , that enemy vessels outside the war zone would be destroyed only if armed , and — to avoid antagonizing the United States — that enemy passenger steamers were not to be attacked , regardless of whether in the war zone or not . The day after the beginning of the second offensive , Neumann and UB @-@ 13 sank four more fishing smacks northeast of Lowestoft . All four ships were boarded and sunk in the same manner as the three sunk the previous July . Shortly after , Neumann was transferred to command UB @-@ 2 in early March , and was replaced by Oberleutnant zur See Arthur Metz , who had been in command of UB @-@ 17 for the preceding month . 
 = = = SS Tubantia = = = 
 Shortly after 02 : 30 on 16 March , a torpedo from UB @-@ 13 struck the starboard side of the neutral Dutch ocean liner Tubantia , which was at anchor near the North Hinder Lightship , about 50 nautical miles ( 93 km ; 58 mi ) off the Dutch coast . The Royal Holland Lloyd ( Dutch : Koninklijke Hollandsche Lloyd ) ship had been fully illuminated , with her name spelled out in electric lights between the twin funnels . Distress calls from Tubantia were heeded and all 80 passengers and 294 crew were rescued by three nearby ships before the ship foundered . Tubantia was the largest neutral ship sunk during the war , and among the 30 largest ships sunk by U @-@ boats . 
 Germany initially tried to implicate British mines or torpedoes , but relented when confronted with evidence that it was one of their own torpedoes — which had been assigned to UB @-@ 13 — that had sunk Tubantia . The Germans , however , presented a forged log from UB @-@ 13 that showed her nowhere near Tubantia at the time of the attack . Further , they reported , UB @-@ 13 had fired that specific torpedo at a British warship on 6 March — ten days before Tubantia was sunk — which would have been under her previous commander , Kapitänleutnant Neumann . The U.S. Minister to the Netherlands , Henry van Dyke , writing in Fighting for Peace in 1917 , called this explanation " amazing " and derided it : 
 This certain U @-@ boat had fired this particular torpedo at a British war @-@ vessel somewhere in the North Sea ten days before the Tubantia was sunk . The shot missed its mark . But the naughty undisciplined little torpedo went cruising around in the sea on its own hook for ten days waiting for a chance to kill somebody . Then the Tubantia came along and the wandering @-@ Willy torpedo promptly , obstinately , ran into the ship and sank her . This was the explanation . Germany was not to blame . 
 The Dutch public was furious at what they believed a hostile German act , which caused German diplomats to spread rumors of an impending British invasion of the Netherlands to divert the unwanted attention . 
 Amidst all of the denials and diplomatic wrangling over Tubantia 's sinking , UB @-@ 13 continued to sink ships . On 31 March , off Lowestoft , Metz and UB @-@ 13 sank the Norwegian steamer Memento . The 1 @,@ 076 GRT ship was carrying a load of coke destined for Porsgrunn when she went down with one crewman . Twelve days later , in the Kentish Knock area , UB @-@ 13 sank the Danish ship <unk> . The 276 @-@ ton sailing vessel was the last ship sunk by UB @-@ 13 . 
 = = Sinking = = 
 On the evening of 23 April 1916 , UB @-@ 13 departed Zeebrugge for a patrol off the mouth of the Thames and was never heard from again . Author Dwight Messimer , in his book <unk> : World War I U @-@ boat Losses , reports that the British had deployed a new explosive anti @-@ submarine net at position 51 ° 33 ′ N 2 ° 45 ′ E in the early morning hours of 24 April . He suggests that it was possible UB @-@ 13 had set off some of the contact mines on the net , or possible that the submarine had struck a mine in one of the many British minefields off the Flemish coast . However , according to authors R. H. Gibson and Maurice Prendergast , in their book The German Submarine War , 1914 – 1918 , UB @-@ 13 fouled the anchor cable of the British naval drifter Gleaner of the Sea on 24 April , and was depth charged by <unk> .. Then for good measure , the British destroyer Afridi deployed explosive sweeps against the submarine . Whatever the specific cause of her demise , all seventeen crewmen on board the submarine were killed .

 The credits cite the bestselling book Fingerprints of the Gods by author Graham Hancock as inspiration for the film , and in an interview with the London magazine Time Out , Emmerich states : " I always wanted to do a biblical flood movie , but I never felt I had the hook . I first read about the Earth 's Crust Displacement Theory in Graham Hancock 's Fingerprints of the Gods . " 
 Director Emmerich and composer @-@ producer Harald Kloser had an extremely close relationship and also co @-@ wrote a spec script entitled 2012 , which was marketed to major studios in February 2008 . Nearly all studios met with Emmerich and his representatives to hear the director 's budget projection and story plans , a process that the director had previously gone through with the films Independence Day ( 1996 ) and The Day After Tomorrow ( 2004 ) . Later that month , Sony Pictures Entertainment won the rights for the spec script , planning to distribute it under Columbia Pictures and was produced for less than budgeted . According to Emmerich , the film was eventually produced for about $ 200 million . 
 Filming was originally scheduled to begin in Los Angeles , California , in July 2008 but instead commenced in Kamloops , Savona , Cache Creek and Ashcroft in British Columbia , Canada . Due to the possible 2008 Screen Actors Guild strike , filmmakers set up a contingency plan for salvaging the film . Uncharted Territory , Digital Domain , Double Negative , Scanline , Sony Pictures Imageworks and others were hired to create computer animated visual effects for 2012 . 
 Although the film depicts the destruction of several major cultural and historical icons around the world , Emmerich stated that the Kaaba was also considered for selection . Kloser opposed the idea out of fear that a fatwā might be issued against him .

 The film was promoted in a marketing campaign by a fictional organization , the " Institute for Human Continuity " ; this entailed a fictitious book written by Jackson Curtis entitled Farewell Atlantis , and streaming media , blog updates and radio broadcasts from the apocalyptic zealot Charlie Frost on his website This Is The End . 
 On November 12 , 2008 , the new studio released the first teaser trailer for 2012 that showed a tsunami surging over the Himalayas and interlaced a purportedly scientific message suggesting that the world would end in 2012 , and that the world 's governments were not preparing its population for the event . The trailer ended with a message to viewers to " find out the truth " by searching " 2012 " on search engines . The Guardian criticized the marketing effectiveness as " deeply flawed " and associated it with " websites that make even more spurious claims about 2012 " . 
 The studio also launched a viral marketing website operated by the fictional Institute for Human Continuity , where filmgoers could register for a lottery number to be part of a small population that would be rescued from the global destruction . David Morrison of NASA received over 1000 inquiries from people who thought the website was genuine , and condemned it . " I 've even had cases of teenagers writing to me saying they are contemplating suicide because they don 't want to see the world end , " he said . " I think when you lie on the internet and scare children to make a buck , that is ethically wrong . " Another viral marketing website promotes Farewell Atlantis , a fictional suspense novel about the events of 2012 . 
 Comcast had also organized a " roadblock campaign " to promote the film , where a two @-@ minute scene from the film was broadcast across 450 American commercial television networks , local English @-@ language and Spanish @-@ language stations , and 89 cable outlets within a ten @-@ minute window between 10 : 50 PM EDT / PDT and 11 : 00 PM EDT / PDT on October 1 , 2015 .

 Roger Ebert was enthusiastic about the film , giving it 3 ½ stars out of 4 , saying it " delivers what it promises , and since no sentient being will buy a ticket expecting anything else , it will be , for its audiences , one of the most satisfactory films of the year " . Both Ebert and Claudia Puig of USA Today called the film the " mother of all disaster movies " .

Jayson Rodriguez of MTV noted that the concept and theme of the song were similar to events in Diddy 's life , " referencing mistakes he has made in the past and that he wants to put behind him . " Rodriguez also noted the song 's tribute to The Notorious B.I.G , in the line " I miss you , B.I.G. " The chorus features vocals from the group 's female members , Kalenna Harper and Dawn Richards , as well as background vocals from fellow Bad Boy Records recording artist Cassie . The trio use a vocal range of A3 – A4 . Grey also sings some of the vocals , predominately during the song 's opening chorus . 
 Rap @-@ Up magazine reflected on the lyrics of the song , calling them a personal reflection of Diddy 's life and career thanks to lines like " What am I ‘ posed to do when the club lights come on / It ’ s easy to be Puff , but it ’ s harder to be Sean / What if my twins ask why I ain ’ t married their mom ? " Scott <unk> from AOL Radio Blog noted how Diddy referenced a different popular song in each verse . Lamb particularly noted the strong autobiographical lyrics , and the references to the 1979 hit song " Ain 't No Stoppin ' Us Now " by McFadden & Whitehead . Other songs referenced include Dionne Warwick 's " A House Is Not a Home " ( 1964 ) and Smokey Robinson & the Miracles ' " The Tears of a Clown " ( 1970 ) . Rodriguez said " Diddy do [ es ] some soul @-@ searching in his rhymes as the chorus echoes his need for salvation . " 
 Lamb compared the song to Diddy 's early releases , saying that " ' Coming Home ' [ welcomes ] Diddy back to the upper ranks of pop @-@ oriented hip hop artists " . Additionally , Diddy told MTV that although the track had autobiographical elements , it was part of the album 's " conceptual love story narrated by his character " . When asked by Live Lounge 's Trevor Nelson what " Coming Home " was based on , Diddy said : 
 " Coming Home " goes to everybody out there who 's going through a struggle or obstacle . I 've been lost in life , I 'm still lost in life in these sense of trying to find your way back to that person who your grandmother or father wanted you to be . Sometimes you get lost through drug addiction or you break up with up your partner or remission from cancer etc. you struggle to find your way back to yourself . That 's what " Coming Home " is about . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Upon release , " Coming Home " was generally met with a positive reception from music critics , who praised the autobiographical lyrics and composition of Skylar Grey 's vocals with the Alex da Kid and Jay @-@ Z production . Becky Bain of Idolator wrote , " We have to give some credit to Diddy ( or Jay @-@ Z , if he did indeed write [ the lyrics ] ) for dropping some truly introspective lyrics instead of the usual not @-@ so @-@ subtle Cîroc vodka promotions . Simon Vozick @-@ Levinson from Entertainment Weekly agreed , and noted " Coming Home " as one of Last Train to Paris ' highlights , saying it was a " must download " as the album 's only " redemptive ballad " . Jim Farber of the New York Daily News also noted the song 's redemptive themes . He said ' Coming Home ' is the " only song which breaks the flow " of Last Train to Paris , " Diddy confesses to everything from bad parenting to fear of commitment . It 's an interesting moment but an unnecessary one . " Meanwhile , About.com 's Bill Lamb awarded the song four out of five stars , calling it the first " pop hit single " in a long time " [ which ] matches the size of his public persona " . He praised the " beautifully sung chorus by Skylar Grey " and Diddy 's deep " autobiographical lyrics " . Lamb noted that the song " didn 't have the same intensity of emotional impact " other Alex da Kid productions ( Eminem 's " Love the Way You Lie " ) but it did " deliver a warmth and sense of hope that is a good match with the current holiday season . " A reviewer from Sound Savvy said " The latest single ' Coming Home ' is another example of some of the great work found on the album . ... it ’ s a heartfelt anthem of triumph and survival – somber but not depressing .

 = Cardiff Blues vs Leicester Tigers ( 2008 – 09 Heineken Cup ) = 
 The second semi @-@ final of the 2008 – 09 Heineken Cup , the premier European club rugby union competition , saw Cardiff Blues take on Leicester Tigers at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on 3 May 2009 . The scores were level after regular time and neither team was able to score during extra time , resulting in the first ever penalty shoot @-@ out in a professional rugby match . Both teams missed one of their first five kicks , taking the shoot @-@ out to sudden death . Both teams were successful with their kicks in the first two rounds of sudden death , before Martyn Williams missed Cardiff 's eighth kick allowing Jordan Crane to hit the winner . 
 In regular time , Cardiff took an early lead with a penalty before Leicester 's Scott Hamilton scored a converted try and they kicked another penalty . Cardiff scored three further penalties to put them back into the lead , before another successful penalty by Leicester gave them a one @-@ point lead going into half @-@ time . Early in the second half , Geordan Murphy scored another try for Leicester , which again was converted and kicked two more penalties to extend their lead to 26 – 12 with 20 minutes remaining . Leicester then had two players sent to the sin bin , and Cardiff scored two tries in the last 10 minutes of regular time , first by Jamie Roberts and then Tom James , with both conversions successful to bring the scores level at 26 – 26 and take the game into extra time . 
 Following the match , there was criticism of the format used for the penalty shoot @-@ out , specifically the way that the game was decided by kicks at goal attempted by players who wouldn 't ordinarily kick the ball during a rugby match . One journalist commented that was a " ludicrous " way of deciding a game , while another believed it had turned the semi @-@ final into a " pantomime " and was an " unnecessarily demeaning way " of deciding a winner . A review was promised by tournament organisers , and changes were made to the format ahead of the following season 's tournament , though no other Heineken Cup match ever needed to be decided by a penalty shoot @-@ out . 
 = = Background = = 
 Cardiff Blues had been the only team to finish the pool stage of the Heineken Cup unbeaten during the 2008 – 09 season , which saw them given top seeding for the quarter @-@ finals . This meant that they would have a home quarter @-@ final against the second @-@ best runners @-@ up from the pool stage , Toulouse . Cardiff won the quarter @-@ final 9 – 6 . 
 Leicester lost two games during the pool stage , but amassed sufficient points to finish as the top side in the pool and to be seeded fourth , which meant they were given the last of the home draws against the fifth @-@ seeded side , Bath . Leicester beat Bath 20 – 15 to reach the semi @-@ final . 
 In a draw made prior to the quarter @-@ finals , it was determined that the winner of the match between Cardiff and Toulouse would have home country advantage , meaning that they could choose any venue in their own country for the semi @-@ finals , provided it was not their designated home ground . The winner of the match between Leicester and Bath was drawn against them as the away team . Cardiff elected to stage the game at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff , which is located adjacent to their usual Cardiff Arms Park ground and has a much larger capacity of 74 @,@ 500 , compared to the 12 @,@ 500 capacity of the Arms Park . Cardiff had already moved their quarter @-@ final game against Toulouse to the Millennium Stadium , despite being able to use their own ground at that stage of the competition , to take advantage of the increased capacity . 
 = = Regular time = = 
 Cardiff suffered an early setback when their captain , Paul Tito , was injured after nine minutes and had to be replaced . Ben Blair gave Cardiff the lead with a penalty kick before the 15 @-@ minute mark , but Leicester were then awarded three penalties in quick succession due to infringements by Cardiff . For each , Julien Dupuy elected to attempt a kick at goal , but was unsuccessful with all three attempts . Leicester 's first score came in the form of a try from Scott Hamilton after 21 minutes , following a line break by Toby Flood , who then drew two defenders towards him before passing the ball to Hamilton . The try was converted by Dupuy , and a successful Dupuy penalty kick on 24 minutes made the score 10 – 3 to Leicester . Cardiff hit back with three successful penalty kicks of their own , one from Blair and two from Leigh Halfpenny , before Dupuy successfully kicked another penalty just before half @-@ time to give Leicester a 13 – 12 lead at the break . 
 After half @-@ time , Leicester increased their lead with a converted try from Geordan Murphy after 45 minutes and two more penalties from Dupuy extended Leicester 's lead further to 26 – 12 going into the last 20 minutes . Flood left the field due to an injury and was replaced by Aaron Mauger . Leicester then had two players sent to the sin bin in quick succession . First , Craig Newby was shown a yellow card on 62 minutes for killing the ball during a Cardiff attack , and then Geordan Murphy was shown a yellow card on 68 minutes for what was adjudged to be a deliberate knock @-@ on during another Cardiff attack . Leicester did not concede during Newby 's absence , but shortly after his return and with Murphy still off the pitch in the sin bin , Cardiff 's Jamie Roberts scored a try with Ben Blair successfully kicking the conversion from within five metres of the touchline . At the restart , Cardiff gathered the ball and Roberts made a break from within 22 metres of Cardiff 's own goal line before passing to Tom James , who ran 60 metres to score a try in almost exactly the same place as Roberts . Blair again kicked the conversion from the touchline to tie the scores at 26 – 26 with three minutes remaining . With no further scores , the match went into extra time . 
 = = Extra time = = 
 This was the second occasion a Heineken Cup semi @-@ final match had gone to extra time – it had only previously been required in the match between Toulouse and Brive in 1998 . Extra time consisted of two halves of 10 minutes each . A winner would be decided only if one team 's score was higher than the other at the end of extra time , not by the " first to score " system used in some other sports . The rules also provided a tiebreaker if the scores were level after extra time ; the team that had scored the most tries in the match would be the winner . In the event , neither team made any score during extra time , and both had scored the same number of tries during the match , which meant that the match would be decided by a penalty shoot @-@ out , the first time such an occurrence had happened in a professional rugby match . 
 In the final minute of extra time , Leicester medical staff indicated they needed to make a blood injury replacement for Dan <unk> , and elected to bring Julien Dupuy , who had been substituted in the last 10 minutes of regular time , back onto the field as the replacement . The match officials requested the Leicester physiotherapist demonstrate an open wound by wiping the blood from the cut , and satisfied the injury was legitimate , allowed the replacement . With the penalty shoot @-@ out approaching , Cardiff decided to use a substitution to bring Ceri Sweeney , an experienced goal @-@ kicker , onto the field in place of Jamie Roberts . 
 = = Penalty shoot @-@ out = = 
 The rarity of a penalty shoot @-@ out in rugby meant that no standard format existed and tournament organisers were left to devise their own rules on the format a shoot @-@ out would take in the event it was required , such as the positions the kicks would be taken from , the type of kick used and the number and order of players who would participate . In the case of the Heineken Cup , the rules set by organisers European Rugby Cup ( ERC ) prescribed a format closely resembling that used in soccer matches . Each team would alternately take five place kicks , each from the same position on the 22 @-@ metre line , directly in front of the posts . Each kick had to be taken by a different player from the 15 players that were present on the pitch at the end of extra time . In the event the scores were level after the five kicks , " sudden death " would take place , with each team alternately taking a kick until a round occurred where one team was successful with their kick and the other team missed . Again , each kick was required to be taken by a different player , starting with players that had yet to take a kick in the first part of the shoot @-@ out . If no winner had been decided after all 15 players had attempted a kick , the process would continue with each player eligible to take a kick again until all 15 players had made another attempt . 
 Cardiff won the coin toss and elected to kick first . Ben Blair and Julien Dupuy , the goal @-@ kickers used during the match were the first to attempt kicks for their respective sides , were both successful . The teams then nominated other players on their team who had experience at goal @-@ kicking , both teams being successful with their second and third kicks . Cardiff 's fourth player Ceri Sweeney , was also an experienced goal @-@ kicker and was successful ; however , Leicester selected Johne Murphy , who was not a regular kicker , and he missed to make the score 4 – 3 after four of the five rounds . This meant if Cardiff were successful with their next kick , they would have an unassailable lead and would win the match . With no more experienced goal kickers to choose from , winger Tom James stepped up to take the kick , but missed , allowing Leicester the chance to draw level . Scott Hamilton scored with his kick to bring the scores to 4 – 4 after five kicks and take the shoot @-@ out to sudden death . The teams were both successful with their next two kicks , including Craig Newby for Leicester who was the first forward to take a kick in the shoot @-@ out . With all seven backs having already attempted a kick , Cardiff were required to select a forward player for their eighth kick , and chose flanker Martyn Williams . He missed , giving Leicester the chance to win the match if they were successful with their eighth kick . Number 8 Jordan Crane was selected for the attempt and was successful , resulting in Leicester winning the shoot @-@ out 7 – 6 and advancing to the 2009 Heineken Cup Final .

 Martyn Williams remained in the dressing room for 90 minutes after the game , and when he emerged opted not to speak to the media . He later did give his reaction , expressing his opinion that the format was a bit of a lottery and observed " somebody was going to miss – I 've just got to live with the fact that it was me . " He also credited several of the victorious Leicester players who had commiserated with him after the game and others who had sent messages of support to him . Jordan Crane said after the match that he had felt calm prior to taking his kick , as Williams ' miss meant that in the event Crane also missed , the scores would remain level and sudden death would continue . Tom James who had missed a kick earlier in the shoot @-@ out which would have won the match for Cardiff said that " gutted is the only word that properly describes how I am feeling " . 
 A number of outlets expressed disappointment at the penalty shoot @-@ out , in particular the way that Martin Williams , who as a flanker who would not ordinarily take a kick at goal , had been to " blame " for Cardiff 's loss . The Guardian 's Paul Rees expressed the opinion that asking forwards to take kicks at goal " is demanding something not only unnatural but untried and it turned a rousing semi @-@ final into a pantomime , an unnecessarily demeaning way of settling the issue . " Brendan Gallagher writing in The Daily Telegraph noted that only three or four players on a rugby team would kick the ball during a match in a meaningful way , and said it was " ludicrous that a game should be decided by emphasising that particular skill " . He also questioned what would have happened in the event the shoot @-@ out continued and the game been decided between props Martin <unk> and Gethin Jenkins , both considered amongst the finest players in their position but never ordinarily being required to kick the ball at goal . Chris Hewett expressed similar views in The Independent , observing that Martyn Williams " lost the game by failing to perform a task outside the skill @-@ set of the majority of players " and commenting that " short of asking a cat to bark , it is hard to imagine anything more preposterous . " 
 In light of the criticism , tournament organisers ERC agreed to review the penalty shoot @-@ out system , although they confirmed that they had already considered and dismissed some other possible ways of deciding matches , including replaying the game , having a ' next try wins ' rule in extra time , reducing the number of players on the pitch periodically in extra time to create more space and deciding the game on a coin toss . The format for the penalty shoot @-@ out was changed prior to the following season 's tournament , removing the requirement for all players on the field ( including forwards ) to participate , however for the remainder of its existence , the Heineken Cup retained the penalty shoot @-@ out as the final system for deciding a winner if required . No other Heineken Cup match needed to use it . 
 In August 2009 , Martin <unk> , who was working as a pundit for broadcaster Sky Sports during the match , spoke to the News of the World , stating that he believed the blood replacement in the final minute of extra time where Julien Dupuy returned to the field " looked very suspicious and , in light of what happened in the previous round with Harlequins , I think <unk> and Leicester should be called to question . " Leicester coach Richard Cockerill responded that the replacement was within the laws of the game and that the club had done nothing illegal . ERC confirmed that the match commissioner had spoken to the referee regarding the incident and on the basis that the referee was satisfied , no further action was required . Cardiff also confirmed that they were satisfied that no wrongdoing had taken place and would not seek any further action . 
 = Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore = 
 MINDS ( Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore ) is a voluntary welfare organisation based in Singapore , that provides services for the intellectually disabled . They run four special schools and a centre called MINDSville @ Napiri which offers therapy and residential care . Other MINDS services include sheltered workshops , social enterprises , weekly activities , and trust fund management . Founded in 1962 , MINDS is among the largest charities in Singapore , with a staff of 420 helping 2400 beneficiaries . MINDS generates yearly expenses of 21 million Singapore dollars , as of 2005 . Two other organisations , the Association for Persons with Special Needs ( formerly the Association for the Educationally <unk> ) and Special Olympics Singapore , originated as MINDS projects . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1960 , the Singapore Children 's Society initiated several educational and training programmes for intellectually disabled children , leading to the formation of the Singapore Association for Retarded Children ( SARC ) in 1962 . Beginning with only two teachers and 26 students in a single classroom in Towner Road , the new association rapidly expanded over the 1960s , building special schools at Margaret Drive and Jurong , a sheltered workshop at Geylang , a residential home at Tampines as well as their main administration centre , Lee Kong Chian Centre . SARC started a subcommittee for services for those with less severe intellectual disabilities in 1971 and a youth volunteering group the year after ; the subcommittee was split into an independent organisation , the Association for the Educationally <unk> ( <unk> ) , in 1976 . In 1983 SARC launched the first early intervention programme in Singapore , prompting other organisations to follow suit and set up an adjunct subcommittee that became Special Olympics Singapore . 
 Since the term " retarded " had acquired negative connotations and the organisation had started services for adults , SARC changed their name to the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore ( MINDS ) in 1985 . In 1987 , the organisation benefitted by being primarily funded from The Community Chest of Singapore , and in 1993 MINDS became the largest voluntary welfare organisation in Singapore , with <unk> in second place . Relocation of the MINDS special schools , from premises of closed @-@ down primary schools to new buildings with customised facilities , began in 1998 . The association started their first social enterprise , a car washing service along Pasir Panjang Road , in 2001 . Their residential homes and training centres were merged into the MINDSville @ Napiri centre , which opened in 2007 , and the relocation programme was completed two years later . 
 = = Activities = = 
 MINDS runs four special schools for intellectually disabled students aged 4 to 18 , who are taught various life skills , such as personal grooming and money management . They are also taken on outings to learn how to handle common tasks , such as buying groceries and taking public transport . Students undergo physiotherapy , pre @-@ vocational training , as well as basic instruction in some mainstream academic subjects , including languages , mathematics , art , and science . To help the intellectually disabled gain employment , MINDS trains them for simple sorting and packing jobs at sheltered workshops , then negotiates contracts with potential employers : for example , some were hired by Singapore Airlines to recycle headsets . The organisation also manages several social enterprises , including a thrift shop , a car washing service , a food catering company , and a performing arts troupe , that increase employment opportunities for the intellectually disabled . 
 Under the MINDS Trusteeship Scheme , parents of the intellectually disabled can deposit their savings into a trust account , safeguarded by the public trustee , and after they die , MINDS ensures the money is used to fund caregiving of the beneficiary . Other MINDS services , including counselling , behaviour therapy and rehabilitation , are concentrated at their integrated service centre called MINDSville @ Napiri . The centre contains a nursing home for adults with high support needs , another home for intellectually disabled children from broken families , and a hostel , which provides flexible accommodation options for clients who need less @-@ intensive care . In addition , volunteers from the MINDS Youth Group conduct weekly educational , social , and recreational activities , such as swimming classes and singing sessions , for around 170 intellectually disabled people .

 Wilco was touring to promote Mermaid Avenue Vol . II in May 2000 when Jeff Tweedy was invited to play at the Noise Pop festival in Chicago . The festival promoter offered to pair Tweedy with a collaborator of his choosing , and Tweedy decided to perform with Jim O 'Rourke . Tweedy frequently played O 'Rourke 's album Bad Timing in his car while he traveled during the previous winter . O 'Rourke was an accomplished producer as well as a musician , and had produced over 200 albums by the time that Tweedy requested the collaboration . O 'Rourke offered the services of drummer Glenn Kotche , and the trio performed at Double Door for the festival on May 14 , 2000 . Tweedy enjoyed the performance so much that he suggested that the trio record an album together . They chose the name Loose Fur , and recorded six songs during the following summer . 
 By the end of the year , Wilco had recorded enough demo tracks to release a fourth studio album ( the working title was Here Comes Everybody ) , but the band was unhappy with some of the takes of the songs . This was attributed to the inflexibility of Ken Coomer 's drumming . According to American Songwriter Magazine , " Virtually every attempt the singer made to steer Coomer toward the percussive sound he had envisioned for the record sparked a fight . " The band decided to bring Glenn Kotche into the studio to record with the band . Wilco officially replaced Coomer with Kotche in January 2001 , a decision originally proposed by Tweedy and almost immediately approved by the rest of the band . 
 Wilco guitarist Jay Bennett recorded the entire album with Chris Brickley , and agreed with Tweedy that O 'Rourke would be a good choice to mix the album , after a failed attempt by Bennett and Brickley to mix a few of the songs at CRC and after hearing O 'Rourke 's " audition mix " . One of the conflicts , exhibited in the film I Am Trying to Break Your Heart : A Film About Wilco , was over the ten @-@ second transition between " Ashes of American Flags " and " Heavy Metal Drummer " . Bennett attempted to explain to Tweedy that there were several slightly different ways to approach the transition , each of which would yield slightly different results , but Tweedy explained that he just wanted the problem fixed , and was not concerned with understanding the different approaches . Bennett focused on the individual songs , while Tweedy focused on larger conceptual and thematic issues — a tried and true division of labor that had worked well on the four releases on which they co @-@ wrote the material . In order to achieve the band 's musical goals , Tweedy invited Jim O 'Rourke into the studio to mix " I Am Trying to Break Your Heart " ( sample ) , and the results impressed the band members . O 'Rourke was then asked to mix the rest of the album . 
 The cover of the album is a picture of Marina City in the band 's adopted hometown of Chicago . The album was named after a series of letters in the phonetic alphabet that Tweedy had heard on the <unk> box set The <unk> Project : Recordings of Shortwave Numbers Stations . On the fourth track of the album Phonetic Alphabet - Nato , a woman repeats the words " Yankee Hotel Foxtrot " numerous times ; a clip from this Numbers Station transmission was placed in the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot song " Poor Places " . <unk> sued Wilco for copyright infringement , and a settlement was reached out of court . 
 After the album 's completion , Tweedy decided to remove Bennett from the band . The album was completed in 2001 , and Tweedy believed it to be ready for release .

 Los Angeles photographer Sam Jones contacted Wilco in 2000 about producing a documentary film about the creation of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot . Jones shot over 80 hours of footage for I Am Trying to Break Your Heart ( named after the opening song of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot ) beginning on the day that Coomer was dismissed from the band . The footage was edited down to 92 minutes , and the film was released to theaters in 2002 . The documentary has received generally positive reviews .

 In 2001 , AOL merged with Time Warner to form AOL Time Warner . Time Warner 's market share of the music industry had dropped by almost five percent from the mid @-@ 1990s , and the new executives ordered the termination of 600 jobs . One of those jobs was Reprise Records president Howie Klein , who had been a big supporter of Wilco on the label . Klein 's dismissal placed head A & R representative David Kahne in charge of the decision whether to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot .
