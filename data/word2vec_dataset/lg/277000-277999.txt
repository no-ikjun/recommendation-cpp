 Valley View is located on land that was originally part of the Northern Neck Proprietary , a land grant first awarded in 1649 by Charles II of England to seven of his supporters and again in 1688 by official patent . One of the seven , Thomas Colepeper , 2nd Baron Colepeper , acquired the right to the entire grant in 1681 . This was confirmed by King James II , and Colepeper 's grandson Thomas Fairfax , 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron , inherited it in 1719 . Lord Fairfax selected a portion of the proprietary for his manor . This tract , known as the South Branch Survey of the Northern Neck Proprietary , extended from the north end of the Trough to the junction of the North and South Branches of the Potomac River . In 1748 , Fairfax commissioned James Genn to survey the South Branch Potomac River lowlands for sale and lease , with lots ranging in size from 300 to 400 acres ( 120 to 160 ha ) . 
 In 1749 , the tract on which Valley View stands was purchased from Lord Fairfax by John Collins . The 425 @-@ acre ( 172 ha ) lot was Lot Number 20 on the South Branch Survey . Collins also owned a large tract of land spanning present @-@ day Hampshire and Hardy counties . His son Thomas Collins is thought to have inherited his father 's landholdings as an " heir at law " , since there is no record of a will by John Collins dispensing of his properties . By 1772 , Thomas Collins acquired Lot Number 20 , where he lived with his wife Elizabeth . In 1816 , Collins was serving as a magistrate when the town of Romney held a Virginia state election for the Electoral College . One representative from each of Virginia 's then @-@ 25 counties traveled to Romney to cast his vote . Collins and county commissioner William Donaldson certified the convention 's election results . 
 In 1817 , Thomas Collins sold Lot Number 20 to James Gregg Parsons . It is unknown whether the Collinses moved from the tract or continued living on it after the sale . Thomas Collins died in 1822 , and Elizabeth Collins in 1823 . 
 = = = Parsons family ownership = = = 
 The Parsons family was among the first English settlers in the Thirteen Colonies in 1635 ; around 1740 , they settled in Hampshire County . By 1778 , Isaac Parsons ( 1752 – 1796 ) , a member of the Virginia House of Delegates , owned 161 acres ( 65 ha ) of Lot Number 16 and all of Lot Number 17 in the Proprietary . James Gregg Parsons , his eldest son , was born in Hampshire County in 1773 . In 1795 he married Mary Catherine Casey ( 1773 – 1846 ) , whose family owned the adjoining Lot Number 21 . After their marriage they lived in the main house at Wappocomo ( built by Mary Catherine 's father ) , inheriting the house at his death in 1833 . 
 Parsons died on January 25 , 1847 , leaving most of his land to his three sons : James ( Big Jim ) Parsons Jr . ( 1798 – 1858 ) , David C. Parsons ( 1803 – 1860 ) , and Isaac Parsons ( 1814 – 1862 ) . James , his eldest son , inherited Lot Number 20 ; his second son David inherited Lot Number 13 south of Romney ( on which Hickory Grove was later located ) ; and his youngest son Isaac inherited Lot Number 21 ( which included Wappocomo ) . His sons also inherited the nearby " Jake Sugar Rum Tract , the McGuire Tract , and five town lots in Romney " . According to historian William K. Rice , by 1846 Parsons ' sons and their families were all living on the tracts they would subsequently inherit . Rice determined that James Parsons Jr. moved to the Collins Tract around 1826 , and was living there when his father died . 
 James Parsons Jr . , known as " Big Jim " because of his size , was a farmer and cattleman who was born in Hampshire County . In her 1913 Parsons ' Family History and Record , Parsons ' relative ( and family genealogist ) Virginia Parsons MacCabe wrote about him : " He was square and honorable in business , and had a large circle of friends ; he had the urbanity and the gentility of manner which characterizes the true gentleman " . Parsons married Elizabeth Miller on January 8 , 1829 . The couple had eleven children , several of whom attended college . 
 In 1855 , Parsons began building the present @-@ day Valley View house , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of Romney on the Collins Tract . Although he wrote many letters to his sister Mary Gregg Parsons Stump about farming , cattle , family , health and community events , no letters are known to remain from the time of the house 's construction . The Parsons family owned several slaves who are thought to have assisted with construction . 
 After living in his new house for three years , Big Jim died of tuberculosis on October 14 , 1858 . His widow , Elizabeth , lived in the house until after the Civil War . In 1867 or 1869 , she sold the house , the Collins Tract and the remainder of Lot Number 20 to Charles Harmison ( 1823 – 1896 ) for $ 8 @,@ 500 , moving with her remaining children to Missouri ( where she died in 1883 ) . The cost of building the house financially strained the Parsons family ; historian Catherine Snider Long suggests that Elizabeth Miller Parsons sold the house as a result of additional , war @-@ related financial stress from which the family could not recover . 
 = = = Harmison family ownership = = = 
 Charles Harmison was born in Franklin County , Illinois , to Nathaniel and Lydia Harmison , and married Elizabeth " Bettie " Ann Smith ( 1827 – 1903 ) on May 4 , 1854 , in Taylor County , West Virginia . Bettie , the daughter of C. C. and Martha W. Smith , was raised at Western View ( their Fauquier County , Virginia , home ) . By 1867 , Harmison and his family were living in Harrison County . 
 Charles Harmison 's older brother had moved to Romney , where he established and operated a hotel ( the Virginia House ) . In 1867 , the brother learned that the Parsons farm was for sale , and he advised Charles to buy it . Charles ' wife , who wanted to live nearer to Virginia , also urged her husband to buy the property . Charles did , and he , his wife , their ( then ) seven children and a young African American boy named <unk> moved from Harrison to Hampshire County in three days . They traveled on the Northwestern Turnpike in an ambulance Charles had bought after the war . Influenced by her childhood home and by its view of the South Branch Potomac River valley , Elizabeth Harmison named their new house and farm Valley View . 
 Harmison prospered in Hampshire County , acquiring additional land and enlarging his Valley View estate . He later gave this acquired land to his children to establish their own homes when they married . In 1884 , the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad completed its South Branch , connecting the main line at Green Spring to Romney ; this branch bisected the Valley View property . Charles Harmison lived at Valley View until his death on October 31 , 1896 . 
 Charles and Elizabeth 's son , George Edward Harmison ( 1863 – 1916 ) , inherited Valley View around 1903 and brought his wife , Carrie Belle Fox ( 1870 – 1953 ) , there after their marriage on October 4 , 1905 . George demolished the old log kitchen at Valley View , replacing it with a contemporary kitchen building . 
 The Hampshire Southern Railroad was completed from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad 's Romney Depot spur to the South Branch Potomac River by 1909 . In October of that year , the first train on the line passed over Harmison 's bottomlands and crossed the river on an unfinished wooden trestle . By 1910 , the 18 @-@ mile ( 29 km ) line from the Romney spur terminus at Valley View to McNeill was in operation . Later that year , freight and passenger service between Romney and Moorefield began , providing a direct rail link between Moorefield and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad main line at Green Spring . The Hampshire Southern Railroad Company operated this line until 1911 , when it was purchased by the Moorefield and Virginia Railroad Company . Moorefield and Virginia transferred the rail line to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company in 1913 , when it became part of the B & O 's South Branch . 
 In 1911 , George Harmison subdivided the Valley View fields on the Yellow Banks overlooking the South Branch Potomac River . The new development , known as the Valley View Addition to Romney , was south of the Valley View house and west of Romney Depot . Twenty @-@ one lots were sold at public auction on September 27 , 1911 , and several more were sold privately . 
 Harmison died in 1916 , and Carrie continued to live at Valley View until her death on February 8 , 1953 . Harmison 's nephew , Paul Cresap Harmison ( 1893 – 1972 , a grandson of Charles Harmison 's brother Jonathan Harmison ) , and his wife Nancy Parker Harmison ( 1896 – 1981 ) had moved to Valley View to live with her . After Carrie 's death , Paul and Nancy Parker Harmison inherited the house and farm . Valley View remained in the Harmison family until 1963 , when it was sold to Philip Newell and his wife Martha .

 The psychedelic rock band Mind Garage lived at Valley View during the summer of 1968 . During its stay , the band wrote many songs that were later included in their first , self @-@ titled RCA Records album and Mind Garage Early Years . Several songs were conceived on the porch overlooking the valley , then developed and practiced in the barn downhill from the house 's backyard . Among the songs written at Valley View was " Circus Farm " , inspired by the view of the South Branch Potomac River valley from the house 's rear second @-@ floor porch . 
 = = = Mayhew family ownership = = = 
 During its changes in ownership , the original Lot Number 20 of the South Branch Survey was repeatedly partitioned and sold . By 1976 , the original property was divided into five farms and additional parcels , including the Valley View Addition . The tract on which the Valley View residence is located currently measures 6 @.@ 63 acres ( 2 @.@ 68 ha ) . 
 Valley View was purchased by Robert Mayhew 's father and a business associate in 1979 . Mayhew subsequently purchased it from his father , and he and his wife Kim have restored the residence and grounds . 
 After surveys of historic properties in the county , in 2008 the Hampshire County Historic Landmarks Commission and the Hampshire County Commission began an initiative to place structures and districts on the National Register of Historic Places . The county received funding from the State Historic Preservation Office of the West Virginia Division of Culture and History to survey and document its architecture and history . As a result of this initiative , Valley View was one of the first eight historic properties to be considered for placement on the register . The other seven were Capon Chapel , Fort Kuykendall , Hickory Grove , Hook Tavern , North River Mills Historic District , Old Pine Church and Springfield Brick House . The house at Valley View was listed on the NRHP on December 12 , 2012 . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The house at Valley View is significant for its Greek Revival architecture . According to architectural historian Courtney <unk> Zimmerman , " Valley View is a characteristic example of the Greek Revival style for more practical residential applications in outlying areas " . The Valley View house has several Greek Revival design characteristics , including a symmetrical architectural plan and elevations and " substantial , formal " mass . Zimmerman ( who prepared Valley View 's registration form for the NRHP ) said , " Valley View 's applied details in the Greek Revival style , including the front entrance entablature and portico , are more limited , yet the variations that can be seen on Valley View and other estates in the South Branch Valley illustrate the flexibility inherent in the style " . 
 Valley View 's house consists of the original 1855 brick section and a board @-@ and @-@ batten 1961 – 1962 kitchen addition . The grounds contain a smokehouse , a water well , the foundations of an ice house , and a summer kitchen . 
 The bricks from which the house was built were fired in the immediate vicinity ( along the banks of the South Branch Potomac River ) , and the brick walls were reinforced with hand @-@ wrought structural iron angles . The nails used in its construction were fabricated by a local blacksmith , and the wooden sills and joists were sawn by hand . As of 2012 , all the original windows , trim and building materials in the main section of the house were still present . 
 = = = Exterior = = = 
 Valley View 's house is a two @-@ story brick structure with a rectangular architectural plan and exterior dimensions measuring about 49 by 32 feet ( 14 @.@ 9 by 9 @.@ 8 m ) . The house 's exterior brick walls are 9 inches ( 23 cm ) thick and laid in an American bond . The house is topped with a steep metal gabled roof with standing seam profiles . Two sets of double inside chimneys extend above the steep roofline on the northwestern and southeastern ends . 
 The front façade of the house faces a hill to the southwest . It is five bays wide , with the front entrance at the first floor 's center bay . Wide double @-@ hung sash windows are uniformly placed on the house 's front façade , with four nine @-@ over @-@ six double @-@ hung wooden sashes on the first story and five six @-@ over @-@ six double @-@ hung wooden sashes on the second . Each window is surrounded by green @-@ painted wooden shutters and white @-@ painted wooden lintels and sills . 
 The front entrance is covered by a small Greek Revival portico measuring about 12 by 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 by 3 @.@ 7 m ) , topped with a pediment supported by wooden Doric columns and engaged columns at the wall . The front porch is flanked by modest wooden handrails and balusters on its left and right sides . The front entrance is post and lintel construction , with a six @-@ pane transom and two three @-@ pane <unk> windows around the doorway . Zimmerman suggests that " Big Jim " Parsons embellished his home 's front entrance to assert his " wealth and status " and provide " an honored welcome to visitors " . 
 The rear façade of the house faces northeast , across the South Branch Potomac River valley toward Mill Creek Mountain . A two @-@ story ( double ) wooden porch about 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) deep extends across the rear of the house , topped by a shed roof extending from the main gabled roof at a shallower pitch . The first @-@ story porch supports are brown wooden turned posts with no handrail or balusters , and the porch 's second story has white painted square wood posts and vertical railings . Like the front façade , the rear façade is five bays wide ; access to the double porch is through a door in the central bay on both levels . The other four bays have nine @-@ over @-@ six double @-@ hung wooden sash windows on the first story and six @-@ over @-@ six double @-@ hung wooden sash windows on the second story . The northwestern and southeastern sides of the house have one small square window at attic level , between each pair of inside chimneys .

 The interior of the Valley View house has a two @-@ room @-@ deep , central @-@ hallway floor plan . Its wide central hallway contains a staircase from the first floor to the attic , with a wooden handrail supported with square balusters and a modest wooden turned newel post . The ceilings are 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) high . Although the house 's foundation is low , the height of the interior walls and the full @-@ sized attic make it appear tall from the outside . 
 The original house has eight large rooms , each with a fireplace framed by a wooden geometric trabeated mantelpiece with classical elements . The four large rooms on the first floor open from either side of the center hallway . They contain simple wide wood trim , including skirting boards and door frame moldings with " subtly demarcated corners " . The house 's living and dining rooms have wide , wooden dado rails . Most of the wooden decorative trim is painted white , and the walls are plaster . The lone exception is the room serving as an office and den , which has dark stained wooden trim and interior brick structural walls ( exposed by the removal of its plaster during the 1960s ) . All rooms have the original wide plank wooden floors . The second floor has four bedrooms , with closets on either side of a fireplace and simple wood skirting boards and door frames . Parsons family members painted signatures and graffiti in the attic around 1856 , which remain visible on the stairwell wall .

The original basement under the 1855 house is accessible through this porch extension . A ghost building outline on the northwest side of the 1855 house indicates an earlier structure where the present kitchen addition stands . 
 = = = Ancillary structures = = = 
 There are several ancillary structures near the house at Valley View , including a smokehouse and a water well , and the foundations of an ice house and a summer kitchen . Although the smokehouse , the summer kitchen and the ice house are believed to have been built by the Collinses before Big Jim Parsons built Valley View , the dates of construction are uncertain . 
 The smokehouse , measuring about 15 by 20 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 by 6 @.@ 1 m ) , is adjacent to the kitchen addition . It is set into a hillside , allowing at @-@ grade entry to its two levels . Built of square @-@ cut logs with white chinking atop a rubble masonry foundation , the smokehouse is topped with a standing seam metal gabled roof . 
 South of the smokehouse is the brick foundation of an ice house measuring about 15 by 20 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 by 6 @.@ 1 m ) and topped by modern wooden pergola and patio structures . The 15 @-@ by @-@ 20 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 by 6 @.@ 1 m ) brick foundation of Valley View 's summer kitchen is north of the smokehouse and topped by a contemporary wooden pavilion with a gabled roof . 
 In the rear yard of the house is a water well , enclosed by a brick building about 7 by 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 by 2 @.@ 1 m ) in area and 3 @.@ 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) in height . In the center of the well cap is a metal hand pump . Although the well cap 's bricks are similar to those used in the construction of the main house , the well may date from an earlier residence on the site . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The Valley View house is about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) northwest of downtown Romney , atop a promontory ( known locally as the Yellow Banks ) where Depot Valley joins the South Branch Potomac River valley . Depot Valley runs 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) from West Sioux Lane to Valley View , and an unnamed tributary of Big Run flows north along its bottom . Depot Valley Road parallels the stream . 
 Depot Valley is named for Romney Depot , located at the end of a former spur of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad 's South Branch line near the intersection of present @-@ day West Sioux Lane and Depot Valley Road . The unincorporated area around the depot was once known as Valley . A post office operated there from 1928 until 1937 , when its mail was routed through Romney ; it is assumed that Valley View farm used it , since it was 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) south of the house . 
 The Valley View farm property adjoins the Wappocomo farm on the northeast , the corporate limits of Romney on the east and south and the Yellow Banks on the west . In addition to Valley View 's 6 @.@ 63 acres ( 2 @.@ 68 ha ) tract , the Mayhew family owns agricultural land rich in alluvial soils along the South Branch Potomac River west of the house . The South Branch Valley Railroad bisects this farmland , crossing the South Branch Potomac River via a wooden trestle . 
 The <unk> also own Valley View Island , an island in the South Branch Potomac River north of the mouth of Sulphur Spring Run and about 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) southwest of Valley View . The island is ringed by forests , with agricultural fields in its center . When Lots Number 17 and 19 of the South Branch Survey were surveyed in 1749 and resurveyed in 1788 , the island belonged to Lot Number 19 . At that time , the river flowed east of the island , along the base of the Yellow Banks ; its course later changed to run around the west side of the island . 
 Mill Creek Mountain , a narrow anticlinal mountain ridge , rises westward from the South Branch Potomac River across from Valley View . The western foothills of South Branch Mountain rise to the east . Both mountains are covered with Appalachian @-@ Blue Ridge forests of hardwoods and pine .

 = Interstellar Overdrive = 
 " Interstellar Overdrive " is an instrumental psychedelic rock song written and performed by Pink Floyd . The song was written in 1966 , and is listed on their debut album , The Piper at the Gates of Dawn , released in 1967 , clocking in at almost ten minutes in length . 
 The song originated when guitarist Syd Barrett heard the band 's manager Peter Jenner humming a song , which Barrett tried to interpret by playing it on his guitar . Musically sharing the same theme with " Astronomy Domine " , the piece was recorded in several takes between March and April 1967 . An earlier , longer recording of the song can be heard on the soundtrack to the film Tonite Lets All Make Love in London , which was recorded at Sound Technique Studios in early 1967 , and was released in the same year . Other versions of the track appear on various bootleg recordings . The piece has been covered by acts such as T. Rex , Pearl Jam , Hawkwind , the Melvins , and Simon House . 
 = = Composition and music = = 
 " Interstellar Overdrive " was one of the first very psychedelic instrumental improvisations recorded by a rock band . It was seen as Pink Floyd 's first foray into space rock ( along with " Astronomy Domine " ) , although band members would later disparage this term . " Interstellar Overdrive " originated when early Pink Floyd manager Peter Jenner was trying to hum a song he could not remember the name of ( most commonly identified as Love 's cover of " My Little Red Book " ) . Guitarist and vocalist Syd Barrett followed Jenner 's humming with his guitar and used it as the basis for the principal melody of " Interstellar Overdrive " . Bassist Roger Waters once told Barrett that the song 's riff reminded him of the theme tune from Steptoe and Son ( by Ron <unk> ) . Around the time the song was written , Barrett was also inspired by AMM and its guitarist Keith Rowe , who had a pattern of moving pieces of metal along his guitar 's fretboard . The free @-@ form section ( and also , " Pow R. Toc H. " ) was inspired by Frank Zappa 's free @-@ form freak @-@ outs and The Byrds ' " Eight Miles High " . 
 " Interstellar Overdrive " shares an emphasis on chromaticism with " Astronomy Domine " . The main theme descends chromatically from B to G , before resolving to E , all chords major . The opening hook of the piece is a distorted , descending guitar riff , played by Barrett , its composer , with Waters on bass and Richard Wright on organ . Nick Mason 's drums then kick in , and after the riff repeats itself a bit , the track turns into improvisation , including modal improvisations , flourishes on the Farfisa organ , and quiet interludes . The song gradually becomes almost structureless and in free @-@ form tempo , punctuated only by strange guitar noises . Eventually , however , the entire band restates the main theme , which is repeated with decreasing tempo and more deliberate intensity . Waters once called the song " an abstract piece " . A bass riff in the song later evolved into another Pink Floyd song , " Let There Be More Light " , which was written by Waters . 
 = = Recording = = 
 The stereo version of the song has an organ moving from speaker to speaker ; the effect is lost on the mono version of the song , where it simply gains an extra organ and guitar sound . Five takes of the song were originally recorded on 27 February 1967 , with a sixth later recorded on 16 March 1967 , in an attempt to create a shorter version , with overdubs in June of that year , the Piper version also appears on the official compilation albums Relics and A Nice Pair . Despite Smith trying to bring the rest of the album 's tracks from a jam @-@ long length to something more manageable , Smith relented for " Interstellar Overdrive " , as Jenner recalled : " It was definitely the deal that — hey , here you can do ' Interstellar Overdrive ' , you can do what you like , you can do your weird shit . So ' Interstellar Overdrive ' was the weird shit . . . and again , hats off to Norman for letting them do that . " A delay effect was created by producer Norman Smith by superimposing a second version of the song over a previous version . Smith played the drum roll on the song .

 The studio recording on The Piper at the Gates of Dawn is the one that most listeners are familiar with , yet several other versions survive from both the recording studio and the stage . It was first recorded as a demo on 31 October 1966 , recorded live @-@ in @-@ studio at Thompson Private Recording Company . This version was used as the audio sound to the film San Francisco , which was made by a friend of Barrett 's , Anthony Stern . While film @-@ maker Peter Whitehead and his secondhand Stern were having a discussion , the topic about Pink Floyd was brought about by Stern , to which Whitehead told him , " Yeah , terrible music " . Stern said that " they 're successful now " , and suggest the pair go watch Pink Floyd , at their gig at the Royal College of Art . Whitehead recalled that they " went to UFO and I liked them . Not connected to pop music , a long improvisatory quality , ideal for what I wanted . " Whitehead convinced Pink Floyd to record " Interstellar Overdrive " for a film he was working on . Before turning up at the recording studio , the band held a rehearsal , and the next day , 11 January 1967 , went to Sound Techniques studios . The studio , which was originally a dairy factory , was run by engineers Geoff Frost and John Wood . 
 For the session , which was booked for two hours , Wood and Joe Boyd operated the mixing desk , while Whitehead and Stern were filming . This recording of the song lasted nearly 16 @-@ minutes in length , recorded onto a 4 @-@ track recorder in one take , as the band didn 't want to have to play through the song again . The band then played another original instrumental , titled " Nick 's Boogie " . While 5 seconds of the band playing was included in Whitehead 's Tonite Lets All Make Love in London film , edits of the recording was included on the film 's respective soundtrack . The soundtrack ( released in 1968 ) includes an edited version of the song and two reprises of it . The full version is available on the album London ' 66 – ' 67 . While attempting to get the band a record deal , Joe Boyd returned ( and produced ) with the group to Sound Techniques studios . There , the band recorded a demo tape which was to be given to various record labels , one of the songs that features on the tape was " Interstellar Overdrive " . An early , <unk> , shortened mix of the album 's " Interstellar Overdrive " was used for a French EP released in July 1967 . The 40th anniversary edition of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn contains two different , five @-@ minute @-@ long versions of the song , one of them being take 6 from 16 March . 
 Despite its encapsulation of their concert repertoire under the leadership of guitarist and composer Barrett , the long , improvisational , freeform structure of the piece is not particularly representative of the group 's recorded output . As drummer Mason states in his book Inside Out : A Personal History of Pink Floyd , live versions of the song featured many sections that did not appear on the album , and would often last more than 20 minutes . During the band 's days playing in residence at London underground clubs such as the UFO ( Underground Freak Out ) , the song usually opened their show . It occupied other positions , including the encore , until it was retired from the band 's setlist in 1970 . The song had first appeared in live performances in the autumn of 1966 . During one performance of the song , at a gig organized by <unk> Hopkins , Pink Floyd managed to blow out the power of a venue . Hopkins called it " Very cold , very dirty but very nice . " After recording session for Piper were over , Pink Floyd played a 30 @-@ minute version of " Interstellar Overdrive " . Pink Floyd were filmed performing the song for Granada Television 's Scene Special documentary , in January 1967 at the UFO Club . A late @-@ Barrett era rendition was recorded live in Rotterdam in November 1967 , at the Hippy @-@ Happy Fair . The song was later replaced by " Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun " as the main part of the band 's set lists , after Barrett left the band .

 The Sonderkraftfahrzeug 8 ( " special motorized vehicle 8 " ) was a German half @-@ track that saw widespread use in World War II . Its main roles were as a prime mover for heavy towed guns such as the 21 cm <unk> 18 , the 15 cm <unk> 18 and the 10 @.@ 5 cm FlaK 38 . Approximately 4 @,@ 000 were produced between 1938 and 1945 . It was used in every campaign fought by the Germans in World War II , notably the Invasion of Poland , the Battle of France , the Balkans Campaign , the Eastern Front , the North African Campaign , the Battle of Normandy and the Italian Campaign . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Sd.Kfz. 8 had a ladder frame chassis . Power was provided by a Maybach 12 @-@ cylinder , water @-@ cooled , 8 @.@ 52 litre ( 520 cu in ) HL 85 <unk> gasoline engine of 185 horsepower ( 188 PS ) . It had a semi @-@ automatic ZF transmission with four forward and one reverse gears . The driver selected the desired gear and initiated the shift by depressing the clutch . It had two fuel tanks , one of 40 litres ( 11 US gal ) and the other of 210 litres ( 55 US gal ) capacity . 
 Both tracks and wheels were used for steering . The steering system was set up so that shallow turns used only the wheels , but brakes would be applied to the tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned . The drive sprocket had rollers rather than the more common teeth . The rear suspension consisted of six double roadwheels , overlapping and interleaved in the usual Schachtellaufwerk system used for German half @-@ track vehicles , mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars . An idler wheel , mounted at the rear of the vehicle , was used to control track tension . The front wheels had leaf springs and shock absorbers . 
 The upper body had a crew compartment with three bench seats , one for the driver and his assistant , and two others for the crew . The rear cargo area contained storage compartments , one on each side and two in the rear . The windshield could fold forward and was also removable . A convertible canvas top was mounted above the rear storage compartments . It fastened to the windshield when erected . 
 The Sd.Kfz. 8 was initially designed to have a towing capacity of 12 tonnes ( 12 long tons ; 13 short tons ) , but the wartime DB 10 could tow 14 tonnes ( 14 long tons ; 15 short tons ) . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 Preliminary design of all the German half @-@ tracks of the early part of the war was done by Dipl.Ing. Ernst Kniepkamp of the " Military Automotive Department " ( Wa Prüf 6 ) before the Nazis took power in 1933 . His designs were then turned over to commercial firms for development and testing . Daimler @-@ Benz had been working on its own half @-@ track design during 1931 — 32 , the <unk> It weighed 9 @.@ 3 tonnes ( 9 @.@ 2 long tons ; 10 @.@ 3 short tons ) , used a twelve @-@ cylinder , 150 horsepower ( 150 PS ) Maybach DSO 8 gasoline engine and its upper body had three bench seats behind the driver . Its suspension was based on the World War I @-@ era <unk> II and bore absolutely no relation to the interleaved roadwheels and torsion bars used by the various models of the Sd.Kfz. 8 . 
 Daimler @-@ Benz combined the best of both designs in the DB <unk> prototype which appeared in 1934 . It used the same engine as the <unk> , but otherwise bore little resemblance to the older model other than an upper body that had two bench seats for the crew behind the driver 's seat . This upper body remained the same over the life of the Sd.Kfz. 8 . It weighed 14 @.@ 4 tonnes ( 14 @.@ 2 long tons ; 15 @.@ 9 short tons ) and could pull loads of 12 tonnes ( 12 long tons ; 13 short tons ) . An improved version was introduced in 1936 as the DB <unk> . The heavier ( 15 tonnes ( 15 long tons ; 17 short tons ) ) DB 9 model appeared in 1938 . It used the Maybach HL 85 <unk> engine , could carry an 800 kilograms ( 1 @,@ 800 lb ) payload and could tow a 14 tonnes ( 14 long tons ; 15 short tons ) load . Daimler @-@ Benz tried unsuccessfully to use their diesel OM 48 / 1 engine , but it was repeatedly rejected by the Army Weapons Office . The DB 10 was a refined version of the DB 9 and was introduced in October 1939 and was produced for the duration of the war .

 Ten 8 @.@ 8 cm Flak 18 anti @-@ aircraft guns were mounted on pedestals on DB <unk> and DB 9 chassis in 1939 as the 8 @.@ 8 cm Flak 18 ( <unk> . ) auf Zugkraftwagen <unk> ( Sd.Kfz. 8 ) for anti @-@ tank duties . A gun shield was provided for the 88 , but the gun crew had no other protection . The driver 's cab was replaced by a lower , armored cupola and the engine compartment was lightly ( 14 @.@ 5 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 57 in ) ) armored . The vehicle weighed 20 tonnes ( 20 long tons ; 22 short tons ) , was 7 @.@ 35 metres ( 24 @.@ 1 ft ) long , 2 @.@ 8 metres ( 9 @.@ 2 ft ) tall and 2 @.@ 65 metres ( 8 @.@ 7 ft ) wide . The gun could fire directly ahead without any problem , but traverse was limited to 151 ° to each side by the gun shield . Elevation was between -3 ° and + 15 ° . All ten were assigned to the first company of the anti @-@ tank battalion Panzerjäger @-@ Abteilung 8 which participated in the Invasion of Poland in 1939 , the Battle of France in 1940 and Operation Barbarossa in 1941 . The company was redesignated as Panzerjäger @-@ Kompanie ( " Anti @-@ Tank Company " ) 601 in January 1942 and then as the third company of Anti @-@ Tank Battalion 559 the following April . It reported that the last three vehicles had been lost by March 1943 . 
 = = Production and use = = 
 Daimler @-@ Benz and Krupp were the main builders of the Sd.Kfz. 8 during the war , but Krauss @-@ Maffei produced 315 in 1940 — 41 and Škoda joined in the last years of the war . 1615 were on hand on 20 December 1942 . 507 were built in 1943 and 602 in 1944 . Approximately 4000 were built in total . The Sd.Kfz. 8 was used by Czechoslovakia after the war , but it is not known if production continued at Škoda or when they were finally discarded . 
 Unlike most of the other German half @-@ tracks , the Sd.Kfz. 8 was almost always used as a tractor for heavy artillery pieces and was not modified for other roles . 
 = 1940 Pacific typhoon season = 
 The 1940 Pacific typhoon season marked an interruption in meteorological records in both the Philippines and Hong Kong due to the start of World War II . There were 43 reported tropical cyclone , including 27 that attained typhoon status . The first storm was observed in February , and the first typhoon formed two months later , killing three people along Mindanao . Several storms formed in June and July , including reports of a typhoon in the newspapers that killed 52 in South Korea , and another typhoon reported in newspapers that killed one person on Samar after dropping heavy rainfall . The strongest typhoon of the season originated in July and attained a minimum pressure of 927 mbar ( 27 @.@ 4 inHg ) , as reported by a ship northeast of the Philippines . 
 On August 18 , a typhoon moved near or over northeastern Luzon , killing nine people . In early September , a typhoon passed through the Bonin Islands south of Japan and later moved near Kyushu ; heavy rainfall caused a reservoir to collapse in Ōita Prefecture , killing 50 people . On September 18 , a typhoon caused a tram collision in Tokyo due to poor visibility , killing 20 . Another typhoon struck southern Taiwan on September 29 , causing 50 fatalities . On October 19 , Wake Island recorded typhoon @-@ force winds for the first time since observations began five years prior . A strong typhoon passed near Guam on November 3 with winds of 200 km / h ( 125 mph ) , damaging most of the buildings on the island and killing five . Three storms affected the Philippines in December , the second of which was the most notable ; it killed 63 people and left 75 @,@ 000 homeless on Catanduanes . The third of the Philippine storms dissipated on December 24 , ending activity for the season . There was another December typhoon that killed two people on a ship to the northeast of Guam . 
 = = Storms = = 
 Data for most of the storms were provided through the World Wide Consolidated Tropical Cyclone data file known as TD @-@ <unk> . The document utilized several sources to indicate where storms were located , and as a result there were duplications . During the season , the Philippine Weather Bureau issued monthly bulletins , which later provided info for tropical cyclone tracks . The agency used weather stations that were established by Spain and the United States after each country ruled over the archipelago . The weather data ceased in August 1940 , which were later rebuilt in 1945 . Also in 1940 , meteorology records were disrupted in Hong Kong , which were later restored in 1947 , due to World War II . 
 = = = February and April = = = 
 On February 1 , a tropical cyclone formed over western Mindanao in the Philippines . It moved northwestward across Palawan island and was last noted later on February 1 . Historical weather maps show only a circulation near 9 N 121 E. This was a weak system , likely a depression but may have been a weak Tropical Storm . 
 Two months later , a tropical depression developed on April 9 to the east of Yap in the western Caroline Islands . It moved west @-@ northwestward , passing south of the island without gaining much intensity . The depression later bypassed Palau to the north , dissipating on April 13 about 400 km ( 250 mi ) west @-@ northwest of the island . 
 On April 23 , a tropical cyclone was observed east of Palau , moving to the west @-@ southwest . It curved south of the island before turning to the west @-@ northwest . While the storm was approaching Mindanao , a ship reported a minimum pressure of 985 mbar ( 29 @.@ 09 inHg ) and force 12 on the Beaufort scale , indicating that the system was a typhoon . Early on April 26 , the typhoon made landfall just south of Port Lamon on eastern Mindanao , where a pressure of 980 mbar ( 29 inHg ) was reported . Along the coast , the storm produced strong winds and heavy rainfall , and killed three people after capsizing a boat . The storm later crossed over Negros island and near Cebu , where winds of 70 km / h ( 43 mph ) were reported . The storm later entered the South China Sea , dissipating near Palawan on April 28 . 
 = = = June and July = = = 
 A preexisting low pressure area organized into a tropical cyclone on June 9 near Chuuk State . It moved to the northwest as a tropical depression , influencing the trade winds on Yap . On June 13 , the storm executed a small loop to the southwest , later turning back to the northwest . It eventually intensified into a typhoon , producing a pressure of 999 mbar ( 29 @.@ 5 inHg ) in the Ryukyu Islands while passing to the east . The system was no a longer a tropical cyclone by June 16 , either due to dissipation or becoming an extratropical cyclone that continued to the northeast toward Alaska . 
 Toward the end of June , a tropical depression moved across the Philippines through the Visayas , first observed on June 26 . After moving westward into the South China Sea , the depression turned to the northeast , reaching the Luzon Strait . Later , the depression recurved back to the west , dissipating over China on July 3 . 
 On June 29 , a tropical cyclone developed southeast of Palau . It moved to the northwest , remaining east of Palau and the Philippines . Later classified as a typhoon , the system turned to the west and struck Taiwan , then known as Formosa , on July 7 . It moved across the island , crossed the Taiwan Strait , and dissipated over China on July 9 . 
 Another tropical depression formed on July 4 near Chuuk . It moved generally to the west @-@ northwest , although it curved southwestward on July 6 . The next day , the system passed about 480 km ( 300 mi ) south of Guam , by which time it attained typhoon status . It resumed its movement to the northwest , remaining east of the Philippines . On July 11 , a nearby ship reported a pressure of 959 mbar ( 28 @.@ 3 inHg ) and winds of Force 12 on the Beaufort scale . Two days later , the typhoon passed about 95 km ( 60 mi ) west of Naha , Okinawa into the East China Sea , after turning more to the north . On July 14 , the typhoon turned to the northeast into the Sea of Japan , moving between Japan and South Korea . It later crossed Hokkaido , dissipating on July 17 in the Sea of Okhotsk . 
 On July 8 , the Australian Associated Press reported that there was a typhoon about 195 km ( 120 mi ) east of Samar . The storm dropped heavy rainfall over a period of a week , the most since 1919 in one area , which caused river flooding and one death . On July 12 , local newspapers also reported a typhoon striking Seoul , South Korea , killing 52 people and leaving thousands homeless . However , neither of the two storms were mentioned in the Monthly Weather Review summary for the month . 
 A short @-@ lived tropical cyclone appeared on July 11 in the South China Sea , but dissipated the next day . Another short @-@ lived system developed on July 13 near Yap , dissipating on the next day . A few days later on July 18 , a tropical cyclone formed west of Guam ; the system moved westward and was no longer observed by July 23 . 
 On July 12 , a tropical depression formed to the east @-@ southeast of Guam . It moved westward , passing through the Marianas Islands on July 14 . Around July 18 , the storm turned toward the north , passing east of Taiwan . Three days later , the storm approached the Japanese island of Ishigaki 100 km ( 60 mi ) to the west , where a pressure of 985 @.@ 3 mbar ( 29 @.@ 10 inHg ) confirmed the system attained typhoon status . On July 23 , the typhoon turned to the northeast and moved across the Korean Peninsula . The storm turned to the east , later moving across northern Honshu on July 24 , and dissipating two days later . 
 Another tropical depression formed east of Guam on July 21 . It tracked westward , passing near the island on July 23 , and later shifted more to the west @-@ northwest . On July 26 , a ship reported a low pressure of 927 mbar ( 27 @.@ 4 inHg ) , indicating that the system was a typhoon . The system later passed between the Philippines and Taiwan as it entered the South China Sea , but no land areas reported strong winds , suggesting the typhoon was either very small or had weakened from its peak . On July 29 , the typhoon made landfall between Hong Kong and Shantou in southeastern China , quickly dissipating . 
 On July 24 , a tropical depression appeared east of Guam , and soon after passed near the island while tracking northwestward . The system eventually passed between Okinawa and Taiwan , reaching a position 100 km ( 60 mi ) southwest of Naha , Okinawa on July 30 ; a station on the island reported a pressure of 990 mbar ( 29 inHg ) , suggesting the storm attained typhoon status . By the next day , the storm was no longer being tracked in the East China Sea , although the Monthly Weather Review summary indicated that the typhoon continued to the northwest , attaining a pressure of 973 mbar ( 28 @.@ 7 inHg ) . The storm reached a position northeast of Shanghai and dissipated on August 4 after crossing the Shandong Peninsula . 
 = = = August = = = 
 Activity in August began when a tropical depression formed on August 1 to the west of Guam . It exhibited a <unk> track , moving west @-@ northwestward before turning to the south , ultimately dissipating on August 4 ; it never intensified beyond tropical depression status . Another short @-@ lived tropical depression formed on August 1 near Guam , dissipating on August 3 after having moved to the north and west . 
 On August 11 , a tropical cyclone appeared east of Luzon . Over the next few days , it moved across the Philippines , passing near the island of Mindoro on August 13 . The system moved across the South China Sea , intensifying into a typhoon as it approached Vietnam . Although it paralleled the coast , the system dissipated over the Gulf of Tonkin on August 17 . 
 A tropical depression formed on August 13 to the southwest of Guam . It gradually strengthened while tracking west @-@ northwestward , becoming a typhoon on August 16 . Two days later , the storm passed near or over northeastern Luzon and moved into the South China Sea . After approaching Hong Kong , the typhoon turned to the west @-@ southwest , paralleling the southern China coast . Although the track for the storm ended on August 22 , the Monthly Weather Review summary indicated that the typhoon crossed Hainan . The storm then moved across the Gulf of Tonkin and dissipated on August 25 over Vietnam . In Luzon , stations reported a minimum pressure of 975 mbar ( 28 @.@ 8 inHg ) in Palanan , Isabela . The storm produced widespread flooding in Luzon , which damaged crops and cut communications , and killed nine people . In Ilocos Norte , the typhoon caused a shipwreck , although the passengers and crew were rescued . Later , the typhoon brought gusts of 134 km / h ( 83 mph ) to Hong Kong . 
 A short @-@ lived tropical depression formed east of Guam on August 14 , dissipating a day later . The next tropical system developed about 565 km ( 350 mi ) north of Yap on August 19 . It moved generally to the northwest , interrupted a brief turn to the northeast before resuming its trajectory . It quickly intensified into a typhoon , and Naha , Okinawa reported a pressure of 987 mbar ( 29 @.@ 1 inHg ) on August 23 . After passing near the island , the typhoon turned sharply to the northeast . It moved along the southern coast of Japan before coming ashore west of Tokyo on August 26 . Soon after , the storm reached open waters and later passed over eastern Hokkaido , dissipating on August 28 . 
 On August 21 , a tropical depression formed near Yap . After moving erratically to the south and northwest , the system dissipated on August 25 to the east of the Philippines . There was another short @-@ lived depression on August 28 to the east of Guam , dissipating a day later . 
 Another tropical depression formed on August 24 to the east @-@ southeast of Guam . After passing south of the island , the system maintained a steady west @-@ northwest trajectory and quickly intensified into a typhoon . On August 29 , the storm passed east of the Batanes islands that are between Taiwan and Luzon ; a station there recorded a pressure of 987 mbar ( 29 @.@ 1 inHg ) . A day later , the typhoon made landfall in northern Taiwan , and after crossing the island , moved ashore in southeastern China near Fuzhou with a pressure of 979 mbar ( 28 @.@ 9 inHg ) . The storm remained distinct over land , turning to the northeast and passing west of Shanghai . On September 3 , the system dissipated off the south coast of South Korea . 
 The last storm to form in August developed on August 30 to the northwest of Guam . It briefly moved to the north @-@ northeast before maintaining a steady northwest track . The system attained typhoon status , later dissipating on September 4 near Okinawa . 
 = = = September = = = 
 On September 2 , a tropical depression developed to the east of Guam . The system moved northwestward , remaining east and north of the Marianas Islands . Around September 6 , the system passed through the Bonin Islands to the south of Japan , where a station recorded a pressure of 964 mbar ( 28 @.@ 5 inHg ) ; this indicated that the storm attained typhoon status . The storm turned to the west , influenced by a high pressure area over Japan . It is possible the storm executed a loop , or it traversed to the north , before resuming a westerly track on September 9 . The typhoon later passed over southern Kyushu , later turning abruptly to the northeast and east . On September 12 , the system dissipated over central Honshu . While moving through the Bonin Islands , the typhoon destroyed schools , government offices , and power plants . Several people were killed , and 500 were left homeless . Later , the storm disrupted shipping in and around Kyushu , damaging the port at Nagasaki . In Ōita Prefecture , rains from the typhoon caused a reservoir on Kyushu to collapse , killing 50 people . 
 Also on September 2 , a tropical depression formed between Guam and Luzon . It moved to the northwest , then turned to the northeast , intensifying into a typhoon ; this was based on a pressure reading of 993 mbar ( 29 @.@ 3 inHg ) from a nearby ship . On September 6 , the system dissipated . 
 A short @-@ lived tropical depression formed on September 3 in the South China Sea , dissipating the next day while moving eastward . There was another short @-@ lived tropical depression that developed on September 4 near the Marianas Islands , but dissipated within one day . Another tropical depression formed on September 4 to the west of the Marianas Islands , which moved to the south and later northeast , dissipating on September 6 . On September 10 , a tropical depression formed northeast of Luzon , lasting only two days while moving in a circular track . 
 On September 9 , a tropical depression formed near Chuuk . Two days later , the system passed south of Guam while maintaining a general west trajectory , although it later turned to the north @-@ northwest . By September 13 , the system attained typhoon status . Three days later , the storm 's track shifted to the north @-@ northeast , bringing it near Hachijō @-@ jima on September 18 which recorded a pressure of 983 mbar ( 29 @.@ 0 inHg ) . That day , it approached southeastern Honshu but remained offshore . After accelerating to the northeast , the system was no longer observed on September 20 to the southeast of the Kamchatka Peninsula . While passing east of Japan , the typhoon caused a tram collision due to poor visibility , killing 20 people . 
 On September 22 , a well @-@ developed typhoon was first observed east @-@ southeast of Guam . The storm moved to the west and later west @-@ northwest , bypassing the island to the south . On September 29 , the system entered the <unk> Channel between Taiwan and Luzon , where a station recorded a pressure of 965 mbar ( 28 @.@ 5 inHg ) at Basco , Batanes . That day , the typhoon passed over or very near southern Taiwan as it continued to the northwest . On September 30 , it made landfall about 160 km ( 100 mi ) northeast of Xiamen , weakening over land . The storm turned to the north and northeast , reaching the East China Sea and dissipating on October 2 . In Taiwan , the typhoon killed 50 people and wrecked 5 @,@ 000 houses . 
 The final September storm originated east of Guam on September 29 . It moved westward , intensifying into a typhoon and passing north of Guam . After varying its track toward the north or south , the typhoon dissipated on October 5 . 
 = = = October through December = = = 
 On October 8 , a tropical depression formed west of Luzon . Its track shifted from the northwest to the southwest and later back to the northwest . On October 12 , the system passed through the Paracel Islands , where a pressure of 996 mbar ( 29 @.@ 4 inHg ) was recorded . The storm attained typhoon status , moving ashore in Vietnam on October 15 . The tropical cyclone database listed a separate tropical cyclone that lasted from October 11 to 15 in the South China Sea that also struck Vietnam . 
 A typhoon was observed on October 13 to the northeast of Guam , with nearby ships reporting a pressure of 985 mbar ( 29 @.@ 1 inHg ) . After moving to the northwest , the system turned to the northeast and was no longer observed after October 17 . 
 On October 19 , a typhoon passed near Wake Island , where a pressure of 968 mbar ( 28 @.@ 6 inHg ) was recorded . Winds reached 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) , which was the first instance of typhoon @-@ force winds on the island since observations began in 1935 . The winds were strong enough to cut radio communications and damage the Pan American World Airways base . The only people on the island were two dozen Pan American workers , who survived by staying in a storm shelter that previously never experienced gale @-@ force winds . After striking the island , the typhoon turned to the northeast , crossing the International Date Line on October 21 . 
 A tropical depression formed on October 29 near Pohnpei . It moved to the northeast initially , but on October 31 began tracking to the west . On November 3 , the system passed just south of Guam as a typhoon , where a pressure of 956 mbar ( 28 @.@ 2 inHg ) was recorded . Winds reached over 200 km / h ( 125 mph ) , and there was a slight decrease during the passage of the eyewall . The typhoon turned to the northwest , passing near the Bonin Islands . On November 8 , the typhoon accelerated to the northeast , crossing the International Date Line on November 10 . When the storm struck Guam , it damaged nearly every building on the island . Most of the damage occurred after the center of the storm passed and the onslaught of easterly winds began . The storm also damaged the Pan American tourist hotel and a hangar . Downed trees killed two or three people , and five people in total died on the island , the others likely due to drowning . After the storm , Naval Governor George McMillin sought aid from the American Red Cross to assist residents in rebuilding . It was considered among the worst typhoons on record in Guam . 
 On November 22 , a tropical depression developed near Chuuk and moved westward . It crossed over Palau on November 24 , and later turned more to the northwest . The system paralleled the east coast of Mindanao , briefly moving ashore on November 26 . It turned to the northeast , dissipating on November 29 . 
 The first in a series of storms to form in December was first observed on December 2 to the east of Samar . The storm moved to the west across the island and through the central Philippines , with a station in Samar reporting a minimum pressure of 979 mbar ( 28 @.@ 9 inHg ) . This indicated the system attained typhoon status . While moving westward , it moved through Panay and later across Palawan before entering the South China Sea . On Panay island , Capiz recorded typhoon @-@ force winds , and throughout the Visayas , the storm damaged roads and bridges , but caused no deaths . The system dissipated on December 6 . 
 On December 3 , a tropical depression formed about 485 km ( 300 mi ) east of Yap . Tracking westward , it intensified into a typhoon on December 5 while approaching the Philippines . The system turned to the northwest , moving over eastern Samar and crossing Catanduanes island with a recorded pressure of 992 mbar ( 29 @.@ 3 inHg ) . Subsequently , there is contradictory information on the path ; the storm either continued to the northwest , dissipating over northeastern Luzon on December 8 , or it turned to the southwest . <unk> in eastern Luzon reported a pressure of 989 mbar ( 29 @.@ 2 inHg ) on December 8 , and later , a station on Marinduque island reported a pressure of 987 mbar ( 29 @.@ 1 inHg ) . The Monthly Weather Report tracked the storm over the Philippines into the South China Sea , reporting its dissipation on December 13 to the east of Vietnam . Across its path through the Philippines , the typhoon brought heavy rains and strong winds , which downed trees and power lines . On Catanduanes , the storm left about 75 @,@ 000 people homeless , and killed 60 . At <unk> , Camarines Norte , ten people died when a tree fell onto a house . Another three people drowned between Polillo Island and Camarines Norte . 
 A tropical cyclone was observed on December 8 southeast of Guam . It moved northwestward and passed about 160 km ( 100 mi ) north of the island on December 10 , where a pressure of 999 mbar ( 29 @.@ 5 inHg ) was recorded . The typhoon turned to the west and later to the southwest . Around December 14 , the system stalled to the east of the Philippines , later drifting to the east . On December 19 , the system weakened , although it remained a distinct entity as it recurved back to the south and west . On December 24 , the storm dissipated after striking Mindanao . 
 The final storm of the season was observed on December 18 to the northeast of Guam . It affected a nearby ship on December 20 , causing the deaths of two members of the crew in the subsequent day . The typhoon tracked to the northeast , crossing the International Date Line on December 21 .

 = Collybia cookei = 
 Collybia cookei is a species of fungus in the Tricholomataceae family , and one of three species in the genus Collybia . It is known from Europe , Asia , and North America . The fungus produces fruit bodies that usually grow on the decomposing remains of other mushrooms , like Meripilus giganteus , Inonotus hispidus , or species of Russula ; occasionally fruit bodies are found on rich humus or well @-@ decayed wood . The fungus produces small white mushrooms with caps up to 9 mm ( 0 @.@ 35 in ) in diameter , supported by thin stems that originate from a yellowish @-@ brown sclerotium . The mushroom is difficult to distinguish from the other two species of Collybia unless an effort is made to examine the sclerotia , which is usually buried in the substrate . The edibility of the mushroom has not been determined . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The species was first described in the scientific literature in 1928 as Collybia cirrhata var. cookei by the Italian mycologist Giacomo Bresadola . In a 1935 publication , Jean D. Arnold reported a series of cultural studies with <unk> isolates ( hypha having only a single haploid nucleus ) of several Collybia species to determine their mating type . All attempts to produce hybrids between C. cirrhata var. cookei and C. <unk> or mycelial fusions between the two species failed . This sexual incompatibility indicated that the two taxa were separate species , and she raised the taxon from varietal to specific status , calling it Collybia cookei . The species has also been called Microcollybia cookei in a 1979 publication by Joanne Lennox , but the genus Microcollybia has since been folded into Collybia . Marcel Bon and Régis Courtecuisse considered the species a variety of Collybia tuberosa in a 1988 publication . A 2001 molecular analysis based on the ribosomal DNA sequences confirmed that C. cookei is phylogenetically related to C. tuberosa and C. cirrhata , and that the three species form a monophyletic group that comprise the genus Collybia . 
 The specific epithet cookei honors the British mycologist Mordecai Cubitt Cooke . 
 = = Description = = 
 The caps of young mushrooms are roughly spherical , but soon become convex to flattened in maturity , and reach diameters of 2 – 9 mm ( 0 @.@ 08 – 0 @.@ 35 in ) . The cap margin is rolled or curled inward when young , but straightens out as it matures . The cap color is white to cream . The gills are broadly adnate to slightly decurrent , with a color similar to the cap ; their spacing is close to subdistant . The whitish stem is equal in width throughout , usually not straight but with curves , and 2 – 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 2 @.@ 0 in ) long by 0 @.@ 3 – 1 @.@ 0 mm ( 0 @.@ 01 – 0 @.@ 04 in ) thick . The upper region of the stem surface can be covered with what appears to be a white powder , and there are thin hairs near the base . The stems originate from a yellowish @-@ brown sclerotium that is up to 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 24 in ) long . The sclerotium ranges in shape from roughly spherical to almond @-@ shaped to irregular , and its surface is often wrinkled and pitted . The mushroom has no distinctive odor or taste , and its edibility is unknown . 
 In deposit , the spore color is white . The spores are smooth , ellipsoidal to tear @-@ shaped , hyaline ( translucent ) , not amyloid , and measure 3 @.@ 9 – 5 @.@ 2 by 2 @.@ 6 – 3 @.@ 3 μm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells in the hymenium ) are four @-@ spored and hyaline , with dimensions of 16 – 20 by 4 – 5 μm . They have clamps at their bases . There are no cystidia on either the edges ( cheilocystidia ) or faces ( pleurocystidia ) of the gills . The arrangement of the hyphae in the hymenophoral tissue varies from regular to interwoven . The cap cuticle is a cutis ( a type of tissue where the hyphae are arranged more or less parallel to the surface ) , formed by hyphae with septa , roughly 4 – 9 μm in diameter . Clamp connections are present in the hyphae . The sclerotium is made of hyphae that have yellow pigment in their walls that appear in cross @-@ section to be pseudoparenchymatous ( compactly interwoven short @-@ celled hyphae that resemble parenchyma of higher plants ) , and measure 5 – 10 μm in diameter . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Collybia cookei is most likely to be confused with the two other members of Collybia , both of which are outwardly similar in appearance ; distinguishing between the three typically requires excavating the stem base away from the moss or debris in which the stem is embedded . In the field , C. tuberosa may be distinguished from C. cookei by its dark brown sclerotia that somewhat resembles an appleseed . Using a microscope provides a more definitive way of distinguishing the two : the hyphae in the sclerotia of C. cookei are rounded , while those of C. tuberosa are elongated ; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh and dried material of the two species . C. cirrhata does not produce sclerotia . 
 Another mushroom that grows on decomposing fruit bodies is Asterophora lycoperdoides , which is distinct from C. cookei because of the powdery brown asexual spores ( chlamydospores ) produced on the cap surface . Alexander H. Smith has noted a general similarity in appearance between C. cookei and the North American species Clitocybe <unk> ( then known as Tricholoma <unk> ) , which is parasitic to Helvella lacunosa . However , C. <unk> is larger than C. cookei , with cap diameters up to 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) , and has more distantly spaced gills . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Like all members of the genus Collybia , C. cookei grows on the well @-@ rotted , blackened remains of mushrooms , such as species of Russula , Meripilus giganteus , and Inonotus hispidus . Fruit bodies occasionally grow on well @-@ decayed wood or rich humus . The fruit bodies grow scattered , clustered , or in groups . A field study conducted near a Brass mill in Sweden revealed that heavy metal contamination had little effect on the appearance of the mushroom , possibly because its substrate of partially decomposed fruit bodies has a lower metal concentration that the underlying topsoil . 
 Collybia cookei is found in Europe , Asia ( Japan ) , and North America . The European distribution extends north to the Arctic Circle and the Lofoten Islands . The species is widely distributed in North America ; it was reported from Mexico for the first time in 1998 . The fungus is partial to mixed forest dominated by aspen and conifers in montane and subalpine environments . In The Netherlands , it was a component of one of three communities of saprobic fungi associated with roadside verges ( the land between the road edge and the adjacent wall , fence or hedge ) planted with common oak ( Quercus robur ) ; the verges also supported the growth of the mushroom Russula <unk> , a host of C. cookei . 
 = Entranceway at Main Street at Roycroft Boulevard = 
 Entranceway at Main Street at Roycroft Boulevard is a suburban residential subdivision entranceway built in 1918 . It is on Main Street ( New York State Route 5 ) in the hamlet of Snyder , New York , in the town of Amherst within Erie County . The entranceway is a marker that represents the American suburbanization of rural areas , suburbanization that occurred through transportation @-@ related land development on the edges of urban areas . It consists of a variety of half @-@ height wall formations , featuring a semicircular wall on the Roycroft Boulevard median 's intersection with Main Street . The entranceway was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 7 , 2005 . 
 = = History = = 
 Williamsville developed around a mill erected in 1811 , and the town of Amherst was born in 1818 . At that time , Main Street was the main link from Williamsville and Amherst to Buffalo . Main Street was displaced as " the unchallenged main artery of Amherst and Western New York " by the Erie Canal in 1825 and later by adjacent railroads . By 1866 , Buffalo Street Railway Company built a street car system that ran on Main Street from Amherst to Buffalo . Daily stage coach service also began in 1866 along Main Street and continued until it was displaced by an electric trolley in 1893 , the track ran 4 @.@ 5 miles ( 7 @.@ 2 km ) from Main and Bailey Avenue ( U.S. Route 62 in New York ) to the east with stops that included Entranceways at Main Street at Lamarck Drive and Smallwood Drive . 
 The early 20th century estate era gave way to the residential subdivision era . Suburban Buffalo 's subdivisions took on an urban flavor along the area 's main thoroughfares and paths of migration . Charles S. Burkhardt began Audubon Terrace on 400 acres north of Main Street in October 1919 on the Taylor and Satterfield Estates . 
 = = Location = = 
 Today , Main Street is a four @-@ lane road running east @-@ west through Snyder connecting Williamsville ( the other side of Interstate 290 , known as the Youngman Expressway ) to points westward such as the neighboring hamlet of Eggertsville and downtown Buffalo . The entranceway is located proximate to large residential areas of trees and grass , 1920s @-@ built subdivisions flanking a wide central median . It is situated three blocks east of Harlem Road ( New York State Route 240 ) . Across Main Street and northeast from the Entranceway is the Eggertsville @-@ Snyder Branch Library of the Buffalo & Erie County Public Library located at 4622 Main Street . Each side of the median serves one @-@ way traffic . The entranceways sit on the two south side corners of this T @-@ junction intersection .

 Completed in 1918 , the entranceway 's featured element is the nearly semi @-@ circular random ashlar stone half @-@ walls on Roycroft Boulevard 's axis of symmetry , which is at a 22 degree angle to Main Street . The wall has one central and two end square posts that are approximately 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) in height and that have poured concrete caps that are not original . Each post has a metal and glass contemporary street lamp projecting from its center . Quarter points of the arc have stone pilaster ornamentation . The running portion of the wall has a continuous cast in place coping cap shaped at a 45 degree angle , which forms an attached buttress three quarters the height of the posts . Past repairs have included incompatible stone and mortar patches . The Main Street paving and the grassy median abut the convex and concave sides , respectively . According to the August 5 , 2005 , application , the entranceway is in a state of disrepair , lacking a visible base and having a tilt . 
 On opposite sides of the Roycroft Boulevard roadways from the central feature are flanking structures with random ashlar stone posts and half @-@ height walls . They are oriented parallel to the angular Roycroft Boulevard and have lengths proportionate to the central wall end post 's distance from Main Street . Both walls are L @-@ shaped with the longer length extending along Roycroft Boulevard and having a short cornered length along Main Street . These walls have capped , square stone buttress @-@ less posts and corners marked by wall @-@ height stone pilaster . On the opposite side of each from the a concrete sidewalk parallel to Roycroft Boulevard is a free @-@ standing stone post . The west side is in fair condition , while the east side is out of vertical alignment and is in poor condition . The east side has the distinction of retaining the only original cast concrete cap with a circular recess on its north end post . It presumably once held an original lamp post and was once painted white . Its south end post has a four piece , white terra cotta cap resembling the other non @-@ original end posts in the set of structures .

 The entryways remain in their original location , retain original design , and setting . They continue to mark the entrance to the subdivision 's entrance for vehicular and pedestrian traffic as they were originally designed to do . Abbott and Beymer Land Co. purchased the land for the Aurora Park subdivision that the entranceway has marked since its 1918 construction . The street and plot plan were designed by the Straley Brothers , who were civil engineers and surveyors from Buffalo . County engineer , George C. Diehl , had a role in the development of this subdivision . The entranceway was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 7 , 2005 . 
 = Battle of Gettysburg , First Day = 
 The First Day of the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War took place on July 1 , 1863 , and began as an engagement between isolated units of the Army of Northern Virginia under Confederate General Robert E. Lee and the Army of the Potomac under Union Maj. Gen. George G. Meade . It soon escalated into a major battle which culminated in the outnumbered and defeated Union forces retreating to the high ground south of Gettysburg , Pennsylvania . 
 The first @-@ day battle proceeded in three phases as combatants continued to arrive at the battlefield . In the morning , two brigades of Confederate Maj. Gen. Henry Heth 's division ( of Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill 's Third Corps ) were delayed by dismounted Union cavalrymen under Brig. Gen. John Buford . As infantry reinforcements arrived under Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds of the Union I Corps , the Confederate assaults down the Chambersburg Pike were repulsed , although Gen. Reynolds was killed . 
 By early afternoon , the Union XI Corps had arrived , and the Union position was in a semicircle from west to north of the town . The Confederate Second Corps under Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell began a massive assault from the north , with Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes 's division attacking from Oak Hill and Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early 's division attacking across the open fields north of town . The Union lines generally held under extremely heavy pressure , although the salient at Barlow 's Knoll was overrun . 
 The third phase of the battle came as Rodes renewed his assault from the north and Heth returned with his entire division from the west , accompanied by the division of Maj. Gen. W. Dorsey Pender . Heavy fighting in Herbst 's Woods ( near the Lutheran Theological Seminary ) and on Oak Ridge finally caused the Union line to collapse . Some of the Federals conducted a fighting withdrawal through the town , suffering heavy casualties and losing many prisoners ; others simply retreated . They took up good defensive positions on Cemetery Hill and waited for additional attacks . Despite discretionary orders from Robert E. Lee to take the heights " if practicable , " Richard Ewell chose not to attack . Historians have debated ever since how the battle might have ended differently if he had found it practicable to do so .

 On the morning of July 1 , Union cavalry in the division of Brig. Gen. John Buford were awaiting the approach of Confederate infantry forces from the direction of Cashtown , to the northwest . Confederate forces from the brigade of Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew had briefly clashed with Union forces the day before but believed they were Pennsylvania militia of little consequence , not the regular army cavalry that was screening the approach of the Army of the Potomac . 
 General Buford realized the importance of the high ground directly to the south of Gettysburg . He knew that if the Confederates could gain control of the heights , Meade 's army would have a hard time dislodging them . He decided to utilize three ridges west of Gettysburg : Herr Ridge , McPherson Ridge , and Seminary Ridge ( proceeding west to east toward the town ) . These were appropriate terrain for a delaying action by his small division against superior Confederate infantry forces , meant to buy time awaiting the arrival of Union infantrymen who could occupy the strong defensive positions south of town , Cemetery Hill , Cemetery Ridge , and Culp 's Hill . Early that morning , Reynolds , who was commanding the Left Wing of the Army of the Potomac , ordered his corps to march to Buford 's location , with the XI Corps ( Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard ) to follow closely behind . 
 Confederate Maj. Gen. Henry Heth 's division , from Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill 's Third Corps , advanced towards Gettysburg . Heth deployed no cavalry and led , unconventionally , with the artillery battalion of Major William J. Pegram . Two infantry brigades followed , commanded by Brig. Gens . James J. Archer and Joseph R. Davis , proceeding easterly in columns along the Chambersburg Pike . Three miles ( 5 km ) west of town , about 7 : 30 a.m. , Heth 's two brigades met light resistance from cavalry vedettes and deployed into line . Eventually , they reached dismounted troopers from Col. William Gamble 's cavalry brigade . The first shot of the battle was claimed to be fired by Lieutenant Marcellus E. Jones of the 8th Illinois Cavalry , fired at an unidentified man on a gray horse over a half @-@ mile away ; the act was merely symbolic . Buford 's 2 @,@ 748 troopers would soon be faced with 7 @,@ 600 Confederate infantrymen , deploying from columns into line of battle . 
 Gamble 's men mounted determined resistance and delaying tactics from behind fence posts with rapid fire from their breech @-@ loading carbines . It is a modern myth that they were armed with multi @-@ shot repeating carbines . Nevertheless , they were able to fire two or three times faster than a muzzle @-@ loaded carbine or rifle . Also , the breech @-@ loading design meant that Union troops did not have to stand to reload and could do so safely behind cover . This was a great advantage over the Confederates , who still had to stand to reload , thus providing an easier target . But this was so far a relatively bloodless affair . By 10 : 20 a.m. , the Confederates had reached Herr Ridge and had pushed the Federal cavalrymen east to McPherson Ridge , when the vanguard of the I Corps finally arrived , the division of Maj. Gen. James S. Wadsworth . The troops were led personally by Gen. Reynolds , who conferred briefly with Buford and hurried back to bring more men forward . 
 = = = Davis versus Cutler = = = 
 The morning infantry fighting occurred on either side of the Chambersburg Pike , mostly on McPherson Ridge . To the north , an unfinished railroad bed opened three shallow cuts in the ridges . To the south , the dominant features were Willoughby Run and Herbst Woods ( sometimes called McPherson Woods , but they were the property of John Herbst ) . Brig. Gen. Lysander Cutler 's Union brigade opposed Davis 's brigade ; three of Cutler 's regiments were north of the Pike , two to the south . To the left of Cutler , Brig. Gen. Solomon Meredith 's Iron Brigade opposed Archer . 
 General Reynolds directed both brigades into position and placed guns from the Maine battery of Capt. James A. Hall where Calef 's had stood earlier . While the general rode his horse along the east end of Herbst Woods , shouting " Forward men ! Forward for God 's sake , and drive those fellows out of the woods , " he fell from his horse , killed instantly by a bullet striking him behind the ear . ( Some historians believe Reynolds was felled by a sharpshooter , but it is more likely that he was killed by random shot in a volley of rifle fire directed at the 2nd Wisconsin . ) Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday assumed command of the I Corps . 
 On the right of the Union line , three regiments of Cutler 's brigade were fired on by Davis 's brigade before they could get into position on the ridge . Davis 's line overlapped the right of Cutler 's , making the Union position untenable , and Wadsworth ordered Cutler 's regiments back to Seminary Ridge . The commander of the 147th New York , Lt. Col. Francis C. Miller , was shot before he could inform his troops of the withdrawal , and they remained to fight under heavy pressure until a second order came . In under 30 minutes , 45 % of Gen. Cutler 's 1 @,@ 007 men became casualties , with the 147th losing 207 of its 380 officers and men . Some of Davis 's victorious men turned toward the Union positions south of the railroad bed while others drove east toward Seminary Ridge . This <unk> the Confederate effort north of the pike . 
 = = = Archer versus Meredith = = = 
 South of the pike , Archer 's men were expecting an easy fight against dismounted cavalrymen and were astonished to recognize the black Hardee hats worn by the men facing them through the woods : the famous Iron Brigade , formed from regiments in the Western states of Indiana , Michigan , and Wisconsin , had a reputation as fierce , tenacious fighters . As the Confederates crossed Willoughby Run and climbed the slope into Herbst Woods , they were enveloped on their right by the longer Union line , the reverse of the situation north of the pike . 
 Brig. Gen. Archer was captured in the fighting , the first general officer in Robert E. Lee 's army to suffer that fate . Archer was most likely positioned around the 14th Tennessee when he was captured by Private Patrick Moloney of Company G. , 2nd Wisconsin , " a brave patriotic and fervent young Irishman . " Archer resisted capture , but Moloney overpowered him . Moloney was killed later that day , but he received the Medal of Honor for his exploit . When Archer was taken to the rear , he encountered his former Army colleague Gen. Doubleday , who greeted him good @-@ naturedly , " Good morning , Archer ! How are you ? I am glad to see you ! " Archer replied , " Well , I am not glad to see you by a damn sight ! " 
 = = = Railroad cut = = = 
 At around 11 a.m. , Doubleday sent his reserve regiment , the 6th Wisconsin , an Iron Brigade regiment , commanded by Lt. Col. Rufus R. Dawes , north in the direction of Davis 's disorganized brigade . The Wisconsin men paused at the fence along the pike and fired , which halted Davis 's attack on Cutler 's men and caused many of them to seek cover in the unfinished railroad cut . The 6th joined the 95th New York and the 84th New York ( also known as the 14th Brooklyn ) , a " demi @-@ brigade " commanded by Col. E.B. Fowler , along the pike . The three regiments charged to the railroad cut , where Davis 's men were seeking cover . The majority of the 600 @-@ foot ( 180 m ) cut ( shown on the map as the center cut of three ) was too deep to be an effective firing position — as deep as 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 5 m ) . Making the situation more difficult was the absence of their overall commander , General Davis , whose location was unknown . 
 The men of the three regiments nevertheless faced daunting fire as they charged toward the cut . The 6th Wisconsin 's American flag went down at least three times during the charge . At one point Dawes took up the fallen flag before it was seized from him by a corporal of the color guard . As the Union line neared the Confederates , its flanks became folded back and it took on the appearance of an inverted V. When the Union men reached the railroad cut , vicious hand @-@ to @-@ hand and bayonet fighting broke out . They were able to pour enfilading fire from both ends of the cut , and many Confederates considered surrender . Colonel Dawes took the initiative by shouting " Where is the colonel of this regiment ? " Major John Blair of the 2nd Mississippi stood up and responded , " Who are you ? " Dawes replied , " I command this regiment . Surrender or I will fire . " Dawes later described what happened next : 
 The officer replied not a word , but promptly handed me his sword , and his men , who still held them , threw down their muskets . The coolness , self possession , and discipline which held back our men from pouring a general volley saved a hundred lives of the enemy , and as my mind goes back to the fearful excitement of the moment , I marvel at it . 
 Despite this surrender , leaving Dawes standing awkwardly holding seven swords , the fighting continued for minutes more and numerous Confederates were able to escape back to Herr Ridge . The three Union regiments lost 390 – 440 of 1 @,@ 184 engaged , but they had blunted Davis 's attack , prevented them from striking the rear of the Iron Brigade , and so overwhelmed the Confederate brigade that it was unable to participate significantly in combat for the rest of the day . The Confederate losses were about 500 killed and wounded and over 200 prisoners out of 1 @,@ 707 engaged . 
 = = Midday lull = = 
 By 11 : 30 a.m. , the battlefield was temporarily quiet . On the Confederate side , Henry Heth faced an embarrassing situation . He had been under orders from General Lee to avoid a general engagement until the full Army of Northern Virginia had concentrated in the area . But his excursion to Gettysburg , ostensibly to find shoes , was essentially a reconnaissance in force conducted by a full infantry division . This indeed had started a general engagement and Heth was on the losing side so far . By 12 : 30 p.m. , his remaining two brigades , under Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew and Col. John M. Brockenbrough , had arrived on the scene , as had the division ( four brigades ) of Maj. Gen. Dorsey Pender , also from Hill 's Corps . Hill 's remaining division ( Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson ) did not arrive until late in the day . 
 Considerably more Confederate forces were on the way , however . Two divisions of the Second Corps , commanded by Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell , were approaching Gettysburg from the north , from the towns of Carlisle and York . The five brigades of Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes marched down the Carlisle Road but left it before reaching town to advance down the wooded crest of Oak Ridge , where they could link up with the left flank of Hill 's Corps . The four brigades under Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early approached on the Harrisburg Road . Union cavalry outposts north of the town detected both movements . Ewell 's remaining division ( Maj. Gen. Edward " Allegheny " Johnson ) did not arrive until late in the day . 
 On the Union side , Doubleday reorganized his lines as more units of the I Corps arrived . First on hand was the Corps Artillery under Col. Charles S. Wainwright , followed by two brigades from Doubleday 's division , now commanded by Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Rowley , which Doubleday placed on either end of his line . The XI Corps arrived from the south before noon , moving up the Taneytown and Emmitsburg Roads . Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard was surveying the area from the roof of the Fahnestock Brothers ' dry @-@ goods store downtown at about 11 : 30 when he heard that Reynolds had been killed and that he was now in command of all Union forces on the field . He recalled : " My heart was heavy and the situation was grave indeed , but surely I did not hesitate a moment . God helping us , we will stay here till the Army comes . I assumed the command of the field . " 
 Howard immediately sent messengers to summon reinforcements from the III Corps ( Maj. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles ) and the XII Corps ( Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum ) . Howard 's first XI Corps division to arrive , under Maj. Gen. Carl Schurz , was sent north to take a position on Oak Ridge and link up with the right of the I Corps . ( The division was commanded temporarily by Brig. Gen. Alexander Schimmelfennig while Schurz filled in for Howard as XI Corps commander . ) The division of Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow was placed on Schurz 's right to support him . The third division to arrive , under Brig. Gen. Adolph von Steinwehr , was placed on Cemetery Hill along with two batteries of artillery to hold the hill as a rallying point if the Union troops could not hold their positions ; this placement on the hill corresponded with orders sent earlier in the day to Howard by Reynolds just before he was killed . 
 However , Rodes beat Schurz to Oak Hill , so the XI Corps division was forced to take up positions in the broad plain north of the town , below and to the east of Oak Hill . They linked up with the I Corps reserve division of Brig. Gen. John C. Robinson , whose two brigades had been sent forward by Doubleday when he heard about Ewell 's arrival . Howard 's defensive line was not a particularly strong one in the north . He was soon outnumbered ( his XI Corps , still suffering the effects of their defeat at the Battle of Chancellorsville , had only 8 @,@ 700 effectives ) , and the terrain his men occupied in the north was poorly selected for defense . He held out some hope that reinforcements from Slocum 's XII Corps would arrive up the Baltimore Pike in time to make a difference . 
 = = Afternoon = = 
 In the afternoon , there was fighting both west ( Hill 's Corps renewing their attacks on the I Corps ) and north ( Ewell 's Corps attacking the I and XI Corps ) of Gettysburg . Ewell , on Oak Hill with Rodes , saw Howard 's troops deploying before him , and he interpreted this as the start of an attack and implicit permission to set aside Gen. Lee 's order not to bring about a general engagement . 
 = = = Rodes attacks from Oak Hill = = = 
 Rodes initially sent three brigades south against Union troops that represented the right flank of the I Corps and the left flank of the XI Corps : from east to west , Brig. Gen. George P. Doles , Col. Edward A. O 'Neal , and Brig. Gen. Alfred Iverson . Doles 's Georgia brigade stood guarding the flank , awaiting the arrival of Early 's division . Both O 'Neal 's and Iverson 's attacks fared poorly against the six veteran regiments in the brigade of Brig. Gen. Henry Baxter , manning a line in a shallow inverted V , facing north on the ridge behind the Mummasburg Road . O 'Neal 's men were sent forward without coordinating with Iverson on their flank and fell back under heavy fire from the I Corps troops . 
 Iverson failed to perform even a rudimentary reconnaissance and sent his men forward blindly while he stayed in the rear ( as had O 'Neal , minutes earlier ) . More of Baxter 's men were concealed in woods behind a stone wall and rose to fire withering volleys from less than 100 yards ( 91 m ) away , creating over 800 casualties among the 1 @,@ 350 North Carolinians . Stories are told about groups of dead bodies lying in almost parade @-@ ground formations , heels of their boots perfectly aligned . ( The bodies were later buried on the scene , and this area is today known as " Iverson 's Pits " , source of many local tales of supernatural phenomena . ) 
 Baxter 's brigade was worn down and out of ammunition . At 3 : 00 p.m. he withdrew his brigade , and Gen. Robinson replaced it with the brigade of Brig. Gen. Gabriel R. Paul . Rodes then committed his two reserve brigades : Brig. Gens . Junius Daniel and Dodson Ramseur . Ramseur attacked first , but Paul 's brigade held its crucial position . Paul had a bullet go in one temple and out the other , blinding him permanently ( he survived the wound and lived 20 more years after the battle ) . Before the end of the day , three other commanders of that brigade were wounded . 
 Daniel 's North Carolina brigade then attempted to break the I Corps line to the southwest along the Chambersburg Pike . They ran into stiff resistance from Col. Roy Stone 's Pennsylvania " <unk> Brigade " in the same area around the railroad cut as the morning 's battle . Fierce fighting eventually ground to a standstill . 
 = = = Heth renews his attack = = = 
 Gen. Lee arrived on the battlefield at about 2 : 30 p.m. , as Rodes 's men were in mid @-@ attack . Seeing that a major assault was underway , he lifted his restriction on a general engagement and gave permission to Hill to resume his attacks from the morning . First in line was Heth 's division again , with two fresh brigades : Pettigrew 's North Carolinians and Col. John M. Brockenbrough 's Virginians . 
 Pettigrew 's Brigade was deployed in a line that extended south beyond the ground defended by the Iron Brigade . <unk> the left flank of the 19th Indiana , Pettigrew 's North Carolinians , the largest brigade in the army , drove back the Iron Brigade in some of the fiercest fighting of the war . The Iron Brigade was pushed out of the woods , made three temporary stands in the open ground to the east , but then had to fall back toward the Lutheran Theological Seminary . Gen. Meredith was downed with a head wound , made all the worse when his horse fell on him . To the left of the Iron Brigade was the brigade of Col. Chapman Biddle , defending open ground on McPherson Ridge , but they were outflanked and decimated . To the right , Stone 's <unk> , facing both west and north along the Chambersburg Pike , were attacked by both Brockenbrough and Daniel . 
 Casualties were severe that afternoon . The 26th North Carolina ( the largest regiment of the army with 839 men ) lost heavily , leaving the first day 's fight with around 212 men . Their commander , Colonel Henry K. <unk> , was fatally wounded by a bullet through his chest . By the end of the three @-@ day battle , they had about 152 men standing , the highest casualty percentage for one battle of any regiment , North or South . One of the Union regiments , the 24th Michigan , lost 399 of 496 . It had nine color bearers shot down , and its commander , Col. Henry A. Morrow , was wounded in the head and captured . The 151st Pennsylvania of Biddle 's brigade lost 337 of 467 . 
 The highest ranking casualty of this engagement was Gen. Heth , who was struck by a bullet in the head . He was apparently saved because he had stuffed wads of paper into a new hat , which was otherwise too large for his head . But there were two consequences to this glancing blow . Heth was unconscious for over 24 hours and had no further command involvement in the three @-@ day battle . He was also unable to urge Pender 's division to move forward and supplement his struggling assault . Pender was oddly passive during this phase of the battle ; the typically more aggressive tendencies of a young general in Lee 's army would have seen him move forward on his own accord . Hill shared the blame for failing to order him forward as well , but he claimed illness . History cannot know Pender 's motivations ; he was mortally wounded the next day and left no report . 
 = = = Early attacks XI Corps = = = 
 Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard of the XI Corps had a difficult defensive problem . He had only two divisions ( four brigades ) to cover the wide expanse of featureless farmland north of town . He and Maj. Gen. Carl Schurz , temporarily in command of the corps while Howard was in overall command on the field , deployed the division of Brig. Gen. Alexander Schimmelfennig on the left and Brig. Gen. Francis C. Barlow on the right . From the left , the brigades were Schimmelfennig 's ( under Col. George von <unk> ) , Col. Włodzimierz <unk> , Brig. Gen. Adelbert Ames , and Col. Leopold von Gilsa . Howard recalled that he selected this line as a logical continuation of the I Corps line formed on his left . This decision has been criticized by historians , such as Edwin B. Coddington , as being too far forward , with a right flank vulnerable to envelopment by the enemy . ( Coddington suggests that a more defensible line would have been along Stevens Run , about 600 feet north of the railroad , a shorter line to defend , with better fields of fire , and with a more secure right flank . ) 
 Making the Federal defense more difficult , Barlow advanced farther north than Schimmelfennig 's division , occupying a 50 @-@ foot ( 15 m ) elevation above Rock Creek named Blocher 's Knoll ( known today as Barlow 's Knoll ) . Barlow 's justification was that he wanted to prevent Doles 's Brigade , of Rodes 's division , from occupying it and using it as an artillery platform against him . General Schurz claimed afterward that Barlow had misunderstood his orders by taking this position . ( In Schurz 's official report , however , he states that Barlow " had been directing the movements of his troops with the most praiseworthy coolness and intrepidity , unmindful of the shower of bullets around , " and " was severely wounded , and had to be carried off the battle @-@ field . " ) By taking the knoll , Barlow was following Howard 's directive to obstruct the advance of Early 's division , and in doing so , deprive him of an artillery platform , as von Steinwehr fortified the position on Cemetery Hill . The position on the knoll turned out to be unfortunate , as it created a salient in the line that could be assaulted from multiple sides . Schurz ordered <unk> 's brigade , which had heretofore been sitting en masse at the north end of town ( without further order to position from Schurz ) forward to assist Barlow 's two brigades on the knoll , but they arrived too late and in insufficient numbers to help . Historian Harry W. Pfanz judges Barlow 's decision to be a " blunder " that " ensured the defeat of the corps . " 
 Richard Ewell 's second division , under Jubal Early , swept down the Harrisburg Road , deployed in a battle line three brigades wide , almost a mile across ( 1 @,@ 600 m ) and almost half a mile ( 800 m ) wider than the Union defensive line . Early started with a large @-@ scale artillery bombardment . The Georgia brigade of Brigadier @-@ General John B. Gordon was then directed for a frontal attack against Barlow 's Knoll , pinning down the defenders , while the brigades of Brigadier @-@ General Harry T. Hays and Colonel Isaac E. Avery swung around their exposed flank . At the same time the Georgians under Doles launched a synchronized assault with Gordon . The defenders of Barlow 's Knoll targeted by Gordon were 900 men of von Gilsa 's brigade ; in May , two of his regiments had been the initial target of Thomas J. " Stonewall " Jackson 's flanking attack at Chancellorsville . The men of the 54th and 68th New York held out as long as they could , but they were overwhelmed . Then the 153rd Pennsylvania succumbed . Barlow , attempting to rally his troops , was shot in the side and captured . Barlow 's second brigade , under Ames , came under attack by Doles and Gordon . Both Union brigades conducted a disorderly retreat to the south . 
 On the left flank of the XI Corps , the attack focused on Gen. Schimmelfennig 's division . They were subjected to a deadly artillery crossfire from Rodes ' and Early 's batteries , and as they deployed they were attacked by Doles ' infantry . Early 's troops were able to employ a flanking attack and roll up the division from the right , and they fell back in confusion toward the town . A desperate counterattack by the 157th New York from von <unk> 's brigade was surrounded on three sides , causing it to suffer 307 casualties ( 75 % ) . 
 Gen. Howard , witnessing this disaster , sent forward an artillery battery and an infantry brigade from von Steinwehr 's reserve force , under Col. Charles Coster . Coster 's battle line just north of the town in Kuhn 's brickyard was overwhelmed by Hays and Avery . He provided valuable cover for the retreating soldiers , but at a high price : of Coster 's 800 men , 313 were captured , as were two of the four guns from the battery . 
 The collapse of the XI Corps was completed by 4 p.m. , after a fight of less than an hour . They suffered 3 @,@ 200 casualties ( 1 @,@ 400 of them prisoners ) , about half the number sent forward from Cemetery Hill . The losses in Gordon 's and Doles 's brigades were under 750 .

 Rodes 's original faulty attack at 2 : 00 had stalled , but he launched his reserve brigade , under Ramseur , against Paul 's Brigade in the salient on the Mummasburg Road , with Doles 's Brigade against the left flank of the XI Corps . Daniel 's Brigade resumed its attack , now to the east against Baxter on Oak Ridge . This time Rodes was more successful , mostly because Early coordinated an attack on his flank . 
 In the west , the Union troops had fallen back to the Seminary and built hasty breastworks running 600 yards ( 550 m ) north @-@ south before the western face of Schmucker Hall , bolstered by 20 guns of Wainwright 's battalion . Dorsey Pender 's division of Hill 's Corps stepped through the exhausted lines of Heth 's men at about 4 : 00 p.m. to finish off the I Corps survivors . The brigade of Brig. Gen. Alfred M. Scales attacked first , on the northern flank . His five regiments of 1 @,@ 400 North Carolinians were virtually annihilated in one of the fiercest artillery barrages of the war , rivaling Pickett 's Charge to come , but on a more concentrated scale . Twenty guns spaced only 5 yards ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) apart fired spherical case , explosive shells , canister , and double canister rounds into the approaching brigade , which emerged from the fight with only 500 men standing and a single lieutenant in command . Scales wrote afterwards that he found " only a squad here and there marked the place where regiments had rested . " 
 The attack continued in the southern @-@ central area , where Col. Abner M. Perrin ordered his South Carolina brigade ( four regiments of 1 @,@ 500 men ) to advance rapidly without pausing to fire . Perrin was prominently on horseback leading his men but miraculously was untouched . He directed his men to a weak point in the breastworks on the Union left , a 50 @-@ yard ( 46 m ) gap between Biddle 's left @-@ hand regiment , the 121st Pennsylvania , and Gamble 's cavalrymen , attempting to guard the flank . They broke through , enveloping the Union line and rolling it up to the north as Scales 's men continued to pin down the right flank . By 4 : 30 p.m. , the Union position was untenable , and the men could see the XI Corps retreating from the northern battle , pursued by masses of Confederates . Doubleday ordered a withdrawal east to Cemetery Hill . 
 On the southern flank , the North Carolina brigade of Brig. Gen. James H. Lane contributed little to the assault ; he was kept busy by a clash with Union cavalry on the Hagerstown Road . Brig. Gen. Edward L. Thomas 's Georgia Brigade was in reserve well to the rear , not summoned by Pender or Hill to assist or exploit the breakthrough . 
 = = = Union retreat = = = 
 The sequence of retreating units remains unclear . Each of the two corps cast blame on the other . There are three main versions of events extant . The first , most prevalent , version is that the fiasco on Barlow 's Knoll triggered a collapse that ran counterclockwise around the line . The second is that both Barlow 's line and the Seminary defense collapsed at about the same time . The third is that Robinson 's division in the center gave way and that spread both left and right . Gen. Howard told Gen. Meade that his corps was forced to retreat only because the I Corps collapsed first on his flank , which may have reduced his embarrassment but was unappreciated by Doubleday and his men . ( Doubleday 's career was effectively ruined by Howard 's story . ) 
 Union troops retreated in different states of order . The brigades on Seminary Ridge were said to move deliberately and slowly , keeping in control , although Col. Wainwright 's artillery was not informed of the order to retreat and found themselves alone . When Wainwright realized his situation , he ordered his gun crews to withdraw at a walk , not wishing to panic the infantry and start a rout . As pressure eventually increased , Wainwright ordered his 17 remaining guns to gallop down Chambersburg Street , three abreast . A.P. Hill failed to commit any of his reserves to the pursuit of the Seminary defenders , a great missed opportunity . 
 Near the railroad cut , Daniel 's Brigade renewed their assault , and almost 500 Union soldiers surrendered and were taken prisoner . Paul 's Brigade , under attack by Ramseur , became seriously isolated and Gen. Robinson ordered it to withdraw . He ordered the 16th Maine to hold its position " at any cost " as a rear guard against the enemy pursuit . The regiment , commanded by Col. Charles Tilden , returned to the stone wall on the Mummasburg Road , and their fierce fire gave sufficient time for the rest of the brigade to escape , which they did , in considerably more disarray than those from the Seminary . The 16th Maine started the day with 298 men , but at the end of this holding action there were only 35 survivors . 
 For the XI Corps , it was a sad reminder of their retreat at Chancellorsville in May . Under heavy pursuit by Hays and Avery , they clogged the streets of the town ; no one in the corps had planned routes for this contingency . Hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting broke out in various places . Parts of the corps conducted an organized fighting retreat , such as Coster 's stand in the brickyard . The private citizens of Gettysburg panicked amidst the turmoil , and artillery shells bursting overhead and fleeing refugees added to the congestion . Some soldiers sought to avoid capture by hiding in basements and in fenced backyards . Gen. Alexander Schimmelfennig was one such person who climbed a fence and hid behind a woodpile in the kitchen garden of the <unk> family for the rest of the three @-@ day battle . The only advantage that the XI Corps soldiers had was that they were familiar with the route to Cemetery Hill , having passed through that way in the morning ; many in the I Corps , including senior officers , did not know where the cemetery was . 
 As the Union troops climbed Cemetery Hill , they encountered the determined Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock . At midday , Gen. Meade was nine miles ( 14 km ) south of Gettysburg in Taneytown , Maryland , when he heard that Reynolds had been killed . He immediately dispatched Hancock , commander of the II Corps and his most trusted subordinate , to the scene with orders to take command of the field and to determine whether Gettysburg was an appropriate place for a major battle . ( Meade 's original plan had been to man a defensive line on Pipe Creek , a few miles south in Maryland . But the serious battle underway was making that a difficult option . ) 
 When Hancock arrived on Cemetery Hill , he met with Howard and they had a brief disagreement about Meade 's command order . As the senior officer , Howard yielded only grudgingly to Hancock 's direction . Although Hancock arrived after 4 : 00 p.m. and commanded no units on the field that day , he took control of the Union troops arriving on the hill and directed them to defensive positions with his " imperious and defiant " ( and profane ) persona . As to the choice of Gettysburg as the battlefield , Hancock told Howard " I think this the strongest position by nature upon which to fight a battle that I ever saw . " When Howard agreed , Hancock concluded the discussion : " Very well , sir , I select this as the battle @-@ field . " Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren , chief engineer of the Army of the Potomac , inspected the ground and concurred with Hancock . 
 = = Evening = = 
 Gen. Lee also understood the defensive potential to the Union army if they held the high ground of Cemetery Hill . He sent orders to Ewell to " carry the hill occupied by the enemy , if he found it practicable , but to avoid a general engagement until the arrival of the other divisions of the army . " In the face of this discretionary , and possibly contradictory , order , Ewell chose not to attempt the assault . One reason posited was the battle fatigue of his men in the late afternoon , although " Allegheny " Johnson 's division of Ewell 's Corps was within an hour of arriving on the battlefield . Another was the difficulty of assaulting the hill through the narrow corridors afforded by the streets of Gettysburg immediately to the north . Ewell requested assistance from A.P. Hill , but that general felt his corps was too depleted from the day 's battle and General Lee did not want to bring up Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson 's division from the reserve . Ewell did consider taking Culp 's Hill , which would have made the Union position on Cemetery Hill untenable . However , Jubal Early opposed the idea when it was reported that Union troops ( probably Slocum 's XII Corps ) were approaching on the York Pike , and he sent the brigades of John B. Gordon and Brig. Gen. William " Extra Billy " Smith to block that perceived threat ; Early urged waiting for Johnson 's division to take the hill . After Johnson 's division arrived via the Chambersburg Pike , it maneuvered toward the east of town in preparation to take the hill , but a small reconnaissance party sent in advance encountered a picket line of the 7th Indiana Infantry , which opened fire and captured a Confederate officer and soldier . The remainder of the Confederates fled and attempts to seize Culp 's Hill on July 1 came to an end . 
 Lee 's order has been criticized because it left too much discretion to Ewell . Numerous historians and proponents of the Lost Cause movement ( most prominently Jubal Early , despite his own reluctance to support an attack at the time ) have speculated how the more aggressive Stonewall Jackson would have acted on this order if he had lived to command this wing of Lee 's army , and how differently the second day of battle would have proceeded with Confederate artillery on Cemetery Hill , commanding the length of Cemetery Ridge and the Federal lines of communications on the Baltimore Pike . Stephen W. Sears has suggested that Gen. Meade would have invoked his original plan for a defensive line on Pipe Creek and withdrawn the Army of the Potomac , although that movement would have been a dangerous operation under pressure from Lee . 
 Most of the rest of both armies arrived that evening or early the next morning . Johnson 's division joined Ewell and Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson 's joined Hill . Two of the three divisions of the First Corps , commanded by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet , arrived in the morning . Three cavalry brigades under Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart were still out of the area , on a wide @-@ ranging raid to the northeast . Gen. Lee sorely felt the loss of the " eyes and ears of the Army " ; Stuart 's absence had contributed to the accidental start of the battle that morning and left Lee unsure about enemy dispositions through most of July 2 . On the Union side , Meade arrived after midnight . The II Corps and III Corps took up positions on Cemetery Ridge , and the XII Corps and the V Corps were nearby to the east . Only the VI Corps was a significant distance from the battlefield , marching rapidly to join the Army of the Potomac . 
 The first day at Gettysburg — more significant than simply a prelude to the bloody second and third days — ranks as the 23rd biggest battle of the war by number of troops engaged . About one quarter of Meade 's army ( 22 @,@ 000 men ) and one third of Lee 's army ( 27 @,@ 000 ) were engaged . Union casualties were almost 9 @,@ 000 , Confederate slightly more than 6 @,@ 000 . 
 = Strange Tales ( pulp magazine ) = 
 Strange Tales ( cover @-@ titled Strange Tales of Mystery and Terror ) was a U.S. pulp magazine first published from 1931 to 1933 by Clayton Publications . It specialized in fantasy and weird fiction , and was a significant competitor to Weird Tales , the leading magazine in the field . Its published stories include " Wolves of Darkness " by Jack Williamson , as well as work by Robert E. Howard and Clark Ashton Smith . The magazine ceased publication when Clayton entered bankruptcy . It was temporarily revived by Wildside Press , which published three issues edited by Robert M. Price from 2003 to 2007 . 
 = = Publication history and contents = = 
 Fantasy and occult fiction had often appeared in popular magazines prior to the twentieth century , but the first magazine to specialize in the genre , Weird Tales , appeared in 1923 and by the 1930s was the genre 's industry leader . Strange Tales , launched in 1931 by Clayton Publications as a direct rival to Weird Tales , was one of a handful of magazines to seriously challenge for leadership of the field . It was edited by Harry Bates , who also edited Clayton 's Astounding Stories of Super Science , which had begun publication the previous year . Strange Tales was launched as a fantasy magazine , but like Weird Tales it often published science @-@ fiction stories , although unlike its rival its focus was on action stories rather than strange ideas . The title was originally planned to be Strange Stories , but Macfadden Publications , who had published True Strange Stories in 1929 , challenged the title and forced Clayton to change it . 
 Bates paid two cents per word , a higher rate than Weird Tales . As a result , Strange Tales attracted some of the better writers of the day . Well @-@ received stories included " Wolves of Darkness " by Jack Williamson , " <unk> " by Hugh B. Cave , and " Cassius " by Henry Whitehead . Clark Ashton Smith contributed five stories , including " The Return of the Sorcerer " in the first issue , and Edmond Hamilton and August Derleth also appeared in the magazine . Robert E. Howard , later to become famous as the author of the Conan the Barbarian stories , sent several stories to Strange Tales ; some of the stories Bates rejected , such as " The Thing on the Roof " and " The Horror from the Mound " , later appeared in Weird Tales , but Bates accepted " The People of the Dark " after asking for revisions , and it was published in the June 1932 issue . Howard also sold " The Valley of the Lost " to Bates , but it had not yet appeared when Clayton went bankrupt , and did not finally see publication until the 1960s . H.P. Lovecraft submitted several stories to Bates in early 1931 , before the first issue had appeared , but the only work of his that appeared in Strange Tales was Henry Whitehead 's " The Trap " , part of which had been ghost @-@ written by Lovecraft , and which appeared in the March 1932 issue . In one of Lovecraft 's letters he comments that he would not contribute to Strange Tales because " Bates couldn 't guarantee me immunity from the copy @-@ slasher 's shears and blue pencil " , but unpublished letters of his make it clear that his stories were too atmospheric and lacking in action for Bates . Lovecraft 's response was dismissive , and he was subsequently contemptuous of both Bates and Clayton in his letters . The cover art for all seven covers was painted by Hans Wessolowski , under his professional name of " <unk> " . Science @-@ fiction historian Robert Weinberg asserts that Strange Tales published better material than Weird Tales during its short run , and fellow historian Mike Ashley regards it as a " close rival " to Weird Tales . 
 Between 2003 and 2007 , Wildside Press brought out three further issues , undated and numbered 8 through 10 , edited by Robert M. Price . The contents included stories by L. Sprague de Camp , Richard Lupoff , and John Betancourt , and a reprint of " The Devil 's Crypt " , a story by E. Hoffmann Price that had appeared in Strange Detective Stories . 
 = = Bibliographic details = = 
 The full title was Strange Tales of Mystery and Terror , and the magazine is sometimes indexed under this title . Each issue was 144 pages long and priced at US $ 0 @.@ 25 ( equivalent to about $ 4 in 2015 ) . The seven issues were divided into two volumes of three and a final volume of a single issue . A reprint anthology in facsimile format , also titled Strange Tales , appeared in 1976 from Odyssey Press , edited by Diane Howard , William H. Desmond , John Howard , and Robert K. Wiener . In addition , all stories from the first four issues , and most from the next two , were reprinted in four magazines edited by Robert A.W. Lowndes from the mid @-@ 1960s to the early 1970s : Magazine of Horror , Startling Mystery Stories , Weird Terror Tales , and Bizarre Fantasy Tales . 
 The three Wildside Press revival issues were 112 pages , 92 pages , and 58 pages long , respectively ; the size increased with each issue , from small pulp size , to a slightly larger format , to a full size pulp layout . They were not printed on pulp paper . Between 2004 and 2008 Wildside also reissued three of the original magazines in facsimile format ; the issues chosen were dated March and October 1932 , and January 1933 . 
 = Sonic Advance 3 = 
 Sonic Advance 3 ( <unk> , Sonikku Adobansu Surī ) is a platform video game developed by Dimps and Sonic Team and published by Sega in Japan and THQ in North America and Europe for the Game Boy Advance . It was released worldwide in June 2004 . It is part of the Sonic the Hedgehog series ; and the chronological sequel to Sonic Battle . The game stars the characters Sonic , Tails , Amy , Knuckles , and Cream as they seek to keep Doctor Eggman and his robot assistant Gemerl from building empires on each of seven chunks Eggman has divided the Earth into . 
 The game is a fast @-@ paced 2D platformer that takes place across seven zones , each divided into three acts and a boss fight . It allows one or two players to control any two of the five characters ; each one has different abilities that allow players varying access to parts of levels . While the graphics are mainly 2D , the game features some 3D rotation effects . It sold quickly upon release and received positive reviews from critics , who praised its gameplay and aesthetics , though they were more divided on the team @-@ up dynamic . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Similarly to Sonic Advance 1 and 2 before it , Advance 3 is a fast @-@ paced 2D platformer . The player controls one of five characters simultaneously with a second one as a sidekick ; alternately , a second player joins and one controls each character . The two characters run and jump through a series of seven levels , destroying robots along the way . The player collects rings in levels and boss battles as a form of health : upon being hit by an enemy or harmful obstacle , the player 's rings will scatter and can be recollected . Being hit while carrying no rings , being crushed by an obstacle , or falling into a bottomless pit causes death ; running out of lives incurs a game over screen . 
 The levels contain features like vertical loops , springs , and rails that the player can grind on . Each level is divided into three acts , punctuated by a boss fight with Doctor Eggman at the end ; all three acts , the boss fight , and two minigames that grant the player extra lives are bound by a hub world . Within each act , the player collects Chao creatures ; finding 10 in all 3 acts in one zone grants the player access to a special stage , where a Chaos Emerald can be found . Collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds , which can be done after completion of the main campaign , allows the player to fight an extra final boss for the game 's true ending . 
 The player can select any two @-@ member permutation of its five playable characters : Sonic the Hedgehog , Tails , Amy Rose , Knuckles the Echidna , and Cream the Rabbit , provided the two desired characters have been unlocked ; only Sonic and Tails are available at the beginning , while the other three must be rescued from Eggman over the course of the game . Each character has a unique ability : Sonic can perform a spinning attack in mid @-@ air , Tails can fly using his two tails as a propeller , Amy can smash enemies with her hammer , Knuckles can glide long distances and climb walls , and Cream can fly using her ears as wings and attack enemies with her Chao friend , Cheese . The second player character can also give powers to the first by pressing the R button ; for example , pressing and holding R while Tails is the sidekick blasts both characters into the air . In addition , the second character will collect rings and destroy enemies the first has not . Outside the main game , there are two battle modes for two to four players , in which any of the characters can be selected : racing and Chao collecting . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Before the events of the game , Doctor Eggman builds a robotic assistant named Gemerl , who is based on Emerl , another robot that appeared in Sonic Battle . Eggman uses the Chaos Emeralds to perform a technique called Chaos Control and tear the Earth apart , with the intention of creating a segment of his impending empire on each chunk of the planet . This action separates Sonic and Tails from Amy , Knuckles , and Cream , all of whom Eggman finds and captures . The two friends travel through the game 's seven levels to recapture their friends and the Emeralds . 
 The final boss fight takes place at a temple . If the player defeats Eggman there without having all seven Emeralds , Eggman and Gemerl escape and fall off the edge of the temple . Peace is restored to the world , and Omochao snaps a picture of the five heroes . However , the game alerts the player that the Emeralds must still be collected for the true ending . If the player defeats Eggman at the temple with the Emeralds , Gemerl stops in his tracks while running away with Eggman and attacks Sonic , causing the Emeralds to scatter . Gemerl uses them to take on a giant , orb @-@ shaped form , but Sonic also uses their power to attain his Super Sonic form . With Eggman 's help , Super Sonic destroys Gemerl . Tails later finds Gemerl 's broken body on a beach and repairs it such that it is non @-@ aggressive , and the game ends with Cream playing with Gemerl at her mother Vanilla 's house .

 Sonic Advance 3 was published by Sega in Japan and by THQ in North America and Europe . Like Advance 1 and 2 , its development was shared by Dimps and Sega subsidiary Sonic Team since the latter was understaffed on employees familiar with the Game Boy Advance hardware . Yuji Naka , then President of Sonic Team , had limited involvement in the development of Sonic Advance 3 , and he conceived of the team @-@ up dynamic . While the game is fundamentally 2D , it features some Mode 7 3D rotation effects . THQ announced the game in a press release on September 11 , 2003 . The game was later exhibited at E3 2003 . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Sonic Advance 3 was reportedly " racing off store shelves " as soon as it was released . The game also received positive reviews from critics , with respective scores of 79 % and 80 % at review aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings . It later won Handheld Game of the Year at the 2004 Golden Joystick Awards and sold over 100 @,@ 000 copies in the United Kingdom alone . 
 Critics gave mixed opinions to the team @-@ up dynamic . Nich Maragos from 1UP.com celebrated that Sonic Team had " finally [ come ] up with a way of introducing teamwork and variance between characters that doesn 't overwhelm Sonic 's bread @-@ and @-@ butter gameplay . " Maragos singled this out as the main divider between Advance 3 and Sonic Heroes , a game that he found surprisingly linear in level design considering that it , unlike Advance 3 , was in 3D . Maragos , GameSpot 's Frank Provo , IGN 's Craig Harris , and Game Informer 's Lisa Mason appreciated the increase in replayability Sonic 's friends brought . However , Mason , as well as reviewer Stardingo from GamePro , thought that they played too much like Sonic and did not add much to the experience . Darryl Vassar of GameSpy took a different point of criticism : he acknowledged the presence of genuinely different character abilities , but perceived that their only purpose was to find Chao , whom he called " pointless " . Maragos noted that the " mid @-@ air trick " system from Advance 2 was optional in Advance 3 , but spoke positively about its usefulness in locating " hidden areas " . Harris argued that such varying team abilities contributed to occasional " cheapness " in the level design , because " most of the characters have absolutely no defense when hopping off items like springboards " . 
 However , the gameplay was mostly well @-@ received otherwise . Vassar acclaimed the level design : he both called the levels " enormous and fast " and praised the slower , smaller sections for " keeping the levels distinct and adding short interludes to the constant running and loops . " Harris also praised the " clever " level design . However , Mason found it " simplistic " , while Stardingo saw " repetition " in the typical formula . Maragos criticized the bipolar difficulty of the bosses and some minor control issues . Vassar , however , appreciated the return from Advance 2 's running @-@ based boss battles to more traditional ones . Further praise from Harris , conversely , went to the multiplayer mode and — along with Stardingo — to the presence of a hub world , which Harris and Stardingo thought gave the game structure . 
 The game 's aesthetics were also well received . Provo stated that " in terms of graphics and sound , Sonic Advance 3 is on par with the best that companies like Nintendo and Konami have had to offer this year " . He specifically complimented the character animations , simulations of underwater waves , and in @-@ depth background effects . Vassar praised Advance 3 for continuing Advance 1 and 2 's emulation of the " colorful , angular , and stylized look " of the original Sonic the Hedgehog for the Sega Genesis , as well as its " twangy , upbeat tunes " . Stardingo thought similarly overall but criticized the " garish " themes of the level Toy Kingdom . 
 = Falstaff ( opera ) = 
 Falstaff ( Italian pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) is an opera in three acts by the Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi ( 1813 – 1901 ) . The libretto was adapted by Arrigo Boito from Shakespeare 's The Merry Wives of Windsor and scenes from Henry IV , parts 1 and 2 . The work premiered on 9 February 1893 at La Scala , Milan . 
 Verdi wrote Falstaff , which was the last of his 28 operas , as he was approaching the age of 80 . It was his second comedy , and his third work based on a Shakespeare play , following Macbeth and Otello . The plot revolves around the thwarted , sometimes farcical , efforts of the fat knight , Sir John Falstaff , to seduce two married women to gain access to their husbands ' wealth . 
 Verdi was concerned about working on a new opera at his advanced age , but he yearned to write a comic work and was pleased with Boito 's draft libretto . It took the collaborators three years from mid @-@ 1889 to complete . Although the prospect of a new opera from Verdi aroused immense interest in Italy and around the world , Falstaff did not prove to be as popular as earlier works in the composer 's canon . After the initial performances in Italy , other European countries and the US , the work was neglected until the conductor Arturo Toscanini insisted on its revival at La Scala and the Metropolitan Opera in New York from the late 1890s into the next century . Some felt that the piece suffered from a lack of the full @-@ blooded melodies of the best of Verdi 's previous operas , a view strongly contradicted by Toscanini . Conductors of the generation after Toscanini to champion the work included Herbert von Karajan , Georg Solti and Leonard Bernstein . The work is now part of the regular operatic repertory . 
 Verdi made numerous changes to the music after the first performance , and editors have found difficulty in agreeing on a definitive score . The work was first recorded in 1932 and has subsequently received many studio and live recordings . Singers closely associated with the title role have included Victor Maurel ( the first Falstaff ) , Mariano Stabile , Giuseppe <unk> , Tito Gobbi , Geraint Evans and Bryn Terfel . 
 = = Composition history = = 
 = = = Conception = = = 
 By 1889 Verdi had been an opera composer for more than fifty years . He had written 27 operas , of which only one was a comedy , his second work , Un giorno di regno , staged unsuccessfully in 1840 . His fellow composer Rossini commented that he admired Verdi greatly , but thought him incapable of writing a comedy . Verdi disagreed and said that he longed to write another light @-@ hearted opera , but nobody would give him the chance . He had included moments of comedy even in his tragic operas , for example in Un ballo in maschera and La forza del destino . 
 For a comic subject Verdi considered Cervantes 's Don Quixote and plays by <unk> , Molière and <unk> , but found none of them wholly suitable . The singer Victor Maurel sent him a French libretto based on Shakespeare 's The Taming of the Shrew . Verdi liked it , but replied that " to deal with it properly you need a Rossini or a Donizetti " . Following the success of Otello in 1887 he commented , " After having relentlessly massacred so many heroes and heroines , I have at last the right to laugh a little . " He confided his ambition to the librettist of Otello , Arrigo Boito . Boito said nothing at the time , but he secretly began work on a libretto based on The Merry Wives of Windsor with additional material taken from Henry IV , parts 1 and 2 . Many composers had set the play to music , with little success , among them Carl <unk> von <unk> ( 1796 ) , Antonio Salieri ( 1799 ) , Michael William Balfe ( 1835 ) and Adolphe Adam ( 1856 ) . The first version to secure a place in the operatic repertoire was Otto Nicolai 's The Merry Wives of Windsor in 1849 , but its success was largely confined to German opera houses . 
 Boito was doubly pleased with The Merry Wives as a plot . Not only was it Shakespearian , it was based in part on Trecento Italian works – Il <unk> by Ser Giovanni Fiorentino , and Boccaccio 's Decameron . Boito adopted a deliberately archaic form of Italian to " lead Shakespeare 's farce back to its clear Tuscan source " , as he put it . He trimmed the plot , halved the number of characters in the play , and gave the character of Falstaff more depth by incorporating dozens of passages from Henry IV . 
 Verdi received the draft libretto a few weeks later , by early July 1889 , at a time when his interest had been piqued by reading Shakespeare 's play : " Benissimo ! Benissimo ! ... No one could have done better than you " , he wrote back . Like Boito , Verdi loved and revered Shakespeare . The composer did not speak English , but he owned and frequently re @-@ read Shakespeare 's plays in Italian translations by Carlo Rusconi and Giulio Carcano , which he kept by his bedside . He had earlier set operatic adaptations of Shakespeare 's Macbeth ( in 1847 ) and Othello ( in 1887 ) and had considered King Lear as a subject ; Boito had suggested Antony and Cleopatra . 
 Verdi still had doubts , and on the next day sent another letter to Boito expressing his concerns . He wrote of " the large number of years " in his age , his health ( which he admitted was still good ) and his ability to complete the project : " if I were not to finish the music ? " He said that the project could all be a waste of the younger man 's time and distract Boito from completing his own new opera ( which became Nerone ) . Yet , as his biographer Mary Jane Phillips @-@ Matz notes , " Verdi could not hide his delight at the idea of writing another opera " . On 10 July 1889 he wrote again : 
 Amen ; so be it ! So let 's do Falstaff ! For now , let 's not think of obstacles , of age , of illnesses ! I also want to keep the deepest secrecy : a word that I underline three times to you that no one must know anything about it ! [ He notes that his wife will know about it , but assures Boito that she can keep a secret . ] Anyway , if you are in the mood , then start to write . 
 = = = Composition = = = 
 Boito 's original sketch is lost , but surviving correspondence shows that the finished opera is not greatly different from his first thoughts . The major differences were that an act 2 monologue for Ford was moved from scene 2 to scene 1 , and that the last act originally ended with the marriage of the lovers rather than with the lively vocal and orchestral fugue , which was Verdi 's idea . He wrote to Boito in August 1889 telling him that he was writing a fugue : " Yes , Sir ! A fugue ... and a buffa fugue " , which " could probably be fitted in " . 
 Verdi accepted the need to trim Shakespeare 's plot to keep the opera within an acceptable length . He was sorry , nonetheless , to see the loss of Falstaff 's second humiliation , dressed up as the Wise Woman of Brentford to escape from Ford . He wrote of his desire to do justice to Shakespeare : " To sketch the characters in a few strokes , to weave the plot , to extract all the juice from that enormous Shakespearian orange " . Shortly after the premiere an English critic , R A Streatfeild , remarked on how Verdi succeeded : 
 The leading note of [ Falstaff ] ' s character is sublime self @-@ conceit . If his belief in himself were shattered , he would be merely a vulgar sensualist and <unk> . As it is , he is a hero . For one terrible moment in the last act his self @-@ satisfaction wavers . He looks round and sees every one laughing at him . Can it be that he has been made a fool of ? But no , he puts the horrible suggestion from him , and in a flash is himself again . " Son io , " he exclaims with a triumphant inspiration , " che vi fa <unk> . L <unk> mia <unk> l <unk> degli <unk> . " [ " I am not only witty in myself , but the cause that wit is in other men " , a line from Henry IV part 2 . ] Verdi has caught this touch and indeed a hundred others throughout the opera with astonishing truth and delicacy . 
 In November Boito took the completed first act to Verdi at Sant 'Agata , along with the second act , which was still under construction : " That act has the devil on its back ; and when you touch it , it burns " , Boito complained . They worked on the opera for a week , then Verdi and his wife Giuseppina Strepponi went to Genoa . No more work was done for some time . 
 The writer Russ McDonald observes that a letter from Boito to Verdi touches on the musical techniques used in the opera – he wrote of how to portray the characters Nannetta and Fenton : " I can 't quite explain it : I would like as one sprinkles sugar on a tart to sprinkle the whole comedy with that happy love without concentrating it at any one point . " 
 The first act was completed by March 1890 ; the rest of the opera was not composed in chronological order , as had been Verdi 's usual practice . The musicologist Roger Parker comments that this piecemeal approach may have been " an indication of the relative independence of individual scenes " . Progress was slow , with composition " carried out in short bursts of activity interspersed with long fallow periods " partly caused by the composer 's depression . Verdi was weighed down by the fear of being unable to complete the score , and also by the deaths and impending deaths of close friends , including the conductors Franco <unk> and Emanuele Muzio . There was no pressure on the composer to hurry . As he observed at the time , he was not working on a commission from a particular opera house , as he had in the past , but was composing for his own pleasure : " in writing Falstaff , I haven 't thought about either theatres or singers " . He reiterated this idea in December 1890 , a time when his spirits were very low after Muzio 's death that November : " Will I finish it [ Falstaff ] ? Or will I not finish it ? Who knows ! I am writing without any aim , without a goal , just to pass a few hours of the day " . By early 1891 he was declaring that he could not finish the work that year , but in May he expressed some small optimism , which by mid @-@ June , had turned into : 
 The Big Belly [ " <unk> " , the name given to the opera before the composition of Falstaff became public knowledge ] is on the road to madness . There are some days when he does not move , he sleeps , and is in a bad humour . At other times he shouts , runs , jumps , and tears the place apart ; I let him act up a bit , but if he goes on like this , I will put him in a muzzle and straitjacket . 
 Boito was overjoyed , and Verdi reported that he was still working on the opera . The two men met in October or November 1891 , after which the Verdis were in Genoa for the winter . They were both taken ill there , and two months of work were lost . By mid @-@ April 1892 the scoring of the first act was complete and by June – July Verdi was considering potential singers for roles in Falstaff . For the title role he wanted Victor Maurel , the baritone who had sung Iago in Otello , but at first the singer sought contractual terms that Verdi found unacceptable : " His demands were so outrageous , exorbitant , [ and ] incredible that there was nothing else to do but stop the entire project " . Eventually they reached agreement and Maurel was cast . 
 By September Verdi had agreed in a letter to his publisher Casa Ricordi that La Scala could present the premiere during the 1892 – 93 season , but that he would retain control over every aspect of the production . An early February date was mentioned along with the demand that the house would be available exclusively after 2 January 1893 and that , even after the dress rehearsal , he could withdraw the opera : " I will leave the theatre , and [ Ricordi ] will have to take the score away " . The public learned of the new opera towards the end of 1892 , and intense interest was aroused , increased rather than diminished by the secrecy with which Verdi surrounded the preparations ; rehearsals were in private , and the press was kept at arm 's length . Apart from Verdi 's outrage at the way that La Scala announced the season 's programme on 7 December – " either a revival of Tannhäuser or Falstaff " – things went smoothly in January 1893 up to the premiere performance on 9 February .

 = = = Premieres = = = 
 The first performance of Falstaff was at La Scala in Milan on 9 February 1893 , nearly six years after Verdi 's previous premiere . For the first night , official ticket prices were thirty times greater than usual . Royalty , aristocracy , critics and leading figures from the arts all over Europe were present . The performance was a huge success under the baton of Edoardo Mascheroni ; numbers were encored , and at the end the applause for Verdi and the cast lasted an hour . That was followed by a tumultuous welcome when the composer , his wife and Boito arrived at the Grand Hotel de Milan . 
 Over the next two months the work was given twenty @-@ two performances in Milan and then taken by the original company , led by Maurel , to Genoa , Rome , Venice , Trieste , Vienna and , without Maurel , to Berlin . Verdi and his wife left Milan on 2 March ; Ricordi encouraged the composer to go to the planned Rome performance of 14 April , to maintain the momentum and excitement that the opera had generated . The Verdis , along with Boito and Giulio Ricordi , attended together with King Umberto I and other major royal and political figures of the day . The king introduced Verdi to the audience from the Royal Box to great acclaim , " a national recognition and apotheosis of Verdi that had never been tendered him before " , notes Phillips @-@ Matz . 
 During these early performances Verdi made substantial changes to the score . For some of these he altered his manuscript , but for others musicologists have had to rely on the numerous full and piano scores put out by Ricordi . Further changes were made for the Paris premiere in 1894 , which are also inadequately documented . Ricordi attempted to keep up with the changes , issuing new edition after new edition , but the orchestral and piano scores were often mutually contradictory . The Verdi scholar James Hepokoski considers that a definitive score of the opera is impossible , leaving companies and conductors to choose between a variety of options . In a 2013 study Philip Gossett disagrees , believing that the autograph is essentially a reliable source , augmented by contemporary Ricordi editions for the few passages that Verdi omitted to amend in his own score . 
 The first performances outside the Kingdom of Italy were in Trieste and Vienna , in May 1893 . The work was given in the Americas and across Europe . The Berlin premiere of 1893 so excited Ferruccio Busoni that he drafted a letter to Verdi , in which he addressed him as " Italy 's leading composer " and " one of the noblest persons of our time " , and in which he explained that " Falstaff provoked in me such a revolution of spirit that I can ... date [ to the experience ] the beginning of a new epoch in my artistic life . " Antonio Scotti played the title role in Buenos Aires in July 1893 ; Gustav Mahler conducted the opera in Hamburg in January 1894 ; a Russian translation was presented in St Petersburg in the same month . Paris was regarded by many as the operatic capital of Europe , and for the production there in April 1894 Boito , who was fluent in French , made his own translation with the help of the Parisian poet Paul <unk> . This translation , approved by Verdi , is quite free in its rendering of Boito 's original Italian text . Boito was content to delegate the English and German translations to William Beatty Kingston and Max <unk> respectively . The London premiere , sung in Italian , was at Covent Garden on 19 May 1894 . The conductor was Mancinelli , and <unk> and Pini Corsi repeated their original roles . Falstaff was sung by Arturo <unk> ; Maurel played the role at Covent Garden the following season . On 4 February 1895 the work was first presented at the Metropolitan Opera , New York ; Mancinelli conducted and the cast included Maurel as Falstaff , Emma Eames as Alice , <unk> de Lussan as Nannetta and Sofia <unk> as Mistress Quickly . 
 = = = Neglect = = = 
 After the initial excitement , audiences quickly diminished . <unk> were nonplussed by the absence of big traditional arias and choruses . A contemporary critic summed it up : " ' Is this our Verdi ? ' they asked themselves . ' But where is the motive ; where are the broad melodies ... where are the usual ensembles ; the finales ? ' " By the time of Verdi 's death in 1901 the work had fallen out of the international repertoire . The rising young conductor Arturo Toscanini was a strong advocate of the work , and did much to save it from neglect . As musical director of La Scala ( from 1898 ) and the Metropolitan Opera ( from 1908 ) , he programmed Falstaff from the start of his tenure . Richard Aldrich , music critic of The New York Times , wrote that Toscanini 's revival " ought to be marked in red letters in the record of the season . Falstaff , which was first produced here on Feb. 4 . 1895 , has not been given since the following season , and was heard in these two seasons only half a dozen times in all . " Aldrich added that though the general public might have had difficulty with the work , " to connoisseurs it was an unending delight " . 
 In Britain , as in continental Europe and the US , the work fell out of the repertoire . Sir Thomas Beecham revived it in 1919 , and recalling in his memoirs that the public had stayed away he commented : 
 I have often been asked why I think Falstaff is not more of a box @-@ office attraction , and I do not think the answer is far to seek . Let it be admitted that there are fragments of melody as exquisite and haunting as anything that Verdi has written elsewhere , such as the duet of <unk> and Fenton in the first act and the song of Fenton at the beginning of the final scene , which have something of the lingering beauty of an Indian summer . But in comparison with every other work of the composer , it is wanting in tunes of a broad and impressive character , and one or two of the type of " O Mia Regina " , " <unk> <unk> " , or " Ora per sempre addio " might have helped the situation . 
 Toscanini recognised that this was the view of many , but he believed the work to be Verdi 's greatest opera ; he said , " I believe it will take years and years before the general public understand this masterpiece , but when they really know it they will run to hear it like they do now for Rigoletto and La traviata . " 
 = = = Re @-@ emergence = = = 
 Toscanini returned to La Scala in 1921 and remained in charge there until 1929 , presenting Falstaff in every season . He took the work to Germany and Austria in the late 1920s and the 1930s , conducting it in Vienna , Berlin and at three successive Salzburg Festivals . Among those inspired by Toscanini 's performances were Herbert von Karajan and Georg Solti , who were among his <unk> at Salzburg . Toscanini 's younger colleague Tullio Serafin continued to present the work in Germany and Austria after Toscanini refused to perform there because of his loathing of the Nazi regime . 
 When Karajan was in a position to do so he added Falstaff to the repertoire of his opera company at Aachen in 1941 , and he remained a proponent of the work for the rest of his career , presenting it frequently in Vienna , Salzburg and elsewhere , and making audio and video recordings of it . Solti also became closely associated with Falstaff , as did Carlo Maria Giulini ; they both conducted many performances of the work in mainland Europe , Britain and the US and made several recordings . Leonard Bernstein conducted the work at the Met and the Vienna State Opera , and on record . The advocacy of these and later conductors has given the work an assured place in the modern repertoire . 
 Among revivals in the 1950s and later , Hepokoski singles out as particularly notable the Glyndebourne productions with Fernando <unk> and later Geraint Evans in the title role ; three different stagings by Franco Zeffirelli , for the Holland Festival ( 1956 ) , Covent Garden ( 1961 ) and the Metropolitan Opera ( 1964 ) ; and Luchino Visconti 's 1966 version in Vienna . A 1982 production by Ronald Eyre , more reflective and melancholy than usual , was staged in Los Angeles , London and Florence ; Renato <unk> was Falstaff and Giulini conducted . Among more recent players of the title role Bryn Terfel has taken the part at Covent Garden in 1999 , in a production by Graham Vick , conducted by Bernard <unk> and at the Metropolitan Opera in a revival of the Zeffirelli production , conducted by James Levine in 2006 . 
 Although Falstaff has become a regular repertoire work there nonetheless remains a view expressed by John von Rhein in The Chicago Tribune in 1985 : " Falstaff probably always will fall into the category of ' connoisseur 's opera ' rather than taking its place as a popular favorite on the order of La Traviata or Aida . " As noted by Operabase , during the 2012 – 13 season , the work appeared at number 32 of the 50 operas most often performed ; in the 2009 – 10 season it ranked at number 24 .

 A room at the Garter Inn 
 Falstaff and his servants , Bardolfo and Pistola , are drinking at the inn . Dr Caius bursts in and accuses Falstaff of burgling his house and Bardolfo of picking his pocket . He is ejected . Falstaff hands a letter to each of his servants for delivery to Alice Ford and Meg Page , two wealthy married women . In these two identical letters , Falstaff professes his love for each of the women , although it is access to their husbands ' money that he chiefly covets . Bardolfo and Pistola refuse , claiming that honour prevents them from obeying him . Falstaff dispatches his page , Robin , to deliver the letters . Falstaff delivers a tirade at his rebellious followers ( L <unk> ! <unk> ... ! / " Honour ! You rogues ... ! " ) telling them that honour is a mere word and is of no practical value . He chases them out of his sight . 
 Ford 's garden 
 Alice and Meg have received Falstaff 's letters . They compare them , see that they are identical and , together with Mistress Quickly and Nannetta Ford , resolve to punish Falstaff . Meanwhile , Ford has been warned of the letters by Bardolfo and Pistola . All three are thirsty for revenge and are supported by Dr Caius and Fenton , a young gentleman . To Ford 's disapproval , Fenton is in love with Nannetta . Finding a moment to be alone , the young lovers exchange banter . They are interrupted by the return of Alice , Meg and Mistress Quickly . The act ends with an ensemble in which the women and the men separately plan revenge on Falstaff .

 A room at the Garter Inn 
 Falstaff is alone at the inn . Bardolfo and Pistola , now in the pay of Ford , enter and pretend to beg for forgiveness for past transgressions . They announce to their master the arrival of Mistress Quickly , who delivers an invitation to go to Alice 's house that afternoon between the hours of two and three . She also delivers an answer from Meg Page and assures Falstaff that neither is aware of the other 's letter . Falstaff celebrates his potential success ( " Va , <unk> John " / " Go , old Jack , go your own way " ) . Ford arrives , masquerading as " Signor Fontana " , supposedly an admirer of Alice ; he offers money to the fat knight to seduce her . Falstaff is puzzled at the request , and " Fontana " explains that if Alice succumbs to Falstaff , it will then be easier for Fontana to overcome her virtuous scruples . Falstaff agrees with pleasure and reveals that he already has a rendezvous arranged with Alice for two o 'clock – the hour when Ford is always absent from home . Falstaff goes off to change into his best clothes ; Ford is consumed with jealousy ( È <unk> o <unk> ? / " Is it a dream or reality ? " ) . When Falstaff returns in his finery , they leave together with elaborate displays of mutual courtesy . 
 A room in Ford 's house 
 The three women plot their strategy ( " <unk> <unk> di Windsor " / " Merry wives of Windsor , the time has come ! " ) . They are in high spirits , but Alice notices that Nannetta is not . This is because Ford plans to marry her to Dr Caius , a man old enough to be her grandfather ; the women reassure her that they will prevent it . Mistress Quickly announces Falstaff 's arrival , and Mistress Ford has a large laundry basket and a screen placed in readiness . Falstaff 's attempts to seduce Alice with tales of his past glory ( " Quand 'ero paggio del Duca di Norfolk " / " When I was page to the Duke of Norfolk I was slender " ) are cut short , as Mistress Quickly reports the impending arrival of Ford with a retinue of henchmen to catch his wife 's lover . Falstaff hides first behind the screen , and then the women hide him in the laundry basket . In the meantime Fenton and Nannetta hide behind the screen . The men hear the sound of a kiss behind it . They assume it is Falstaff with Alice , but instead they find the young lovers . Ford orders Fenton to leave . Inside the hamper Falstaff is almost suffocating . While the men resume the search of the house Alice orders her servants to throw the laundry basket through the window into the River Thames , where Falstaff endures the jeers of the crowd .

 Before the inn 
 Falstaff glumly curses the sorry state of the world . Some mulled wine soon improves his mood . Mistress Quickly arrives and delivers another invitation to meet Alice . Falstaff at first wants nothing to do with it , but she persuades him . He is to meet Alice at midnight at Herne 's Oak in Windsor Great Park dressed up as Herne the Hunter . He and Mistress Quickly go inside the inn . Ford has realised his error in suspecting his wife , and they and their allies have been watching secretly . They now concoct a plan for Falstaff 's punishment : dressed as supernatural creatures , they will ambush and torment him at midnight . Ford privately proposes a separate plot to Caius : Nannetta will be disguised as Queen of the Fairies , Caius will wear a monk 's costume , and Ford will join the two of them with a nuptial blessing . Mistress Quickly overhears and quietly vows to thwart Ford 's scheme . 
 Herne 's Oak in Windsor Park on a moonlit midnight 
 Fenton arrives at the oak tree and sings of his happiness ( " Dal <unk> il canto <unk> vola " / " From my lips , a song of ecstasy flies " ) ending with " Lips that are kissed lose none of their allure . " Nannetta enters to finish the line with " Indeed , they renew it , like the moon . " The women arrive and disguise Fenton as a monk , telling him that they have arranged to spoil Ford 's and Caius 's plans . Nannetta , as the Fairy Queen , instructs her helpers ( " Sul fil d 'un <unk> <unk> " / " On the breath of a fragrant breeze , fly , nimble spirits " ) before all the characters arrive on the scene . Falstaff 's attempted love scene with Alice is interrupted by the announcement that witches are approaching , and the men , disguised as elves and fairies , soundly thrash Falstaff . At length he recognises Bardolfo in disguise . The joke is over , and Falstaff acknowledges that he has received his due . Ford announces that a wedding shall ensue . Caius and the Queen of the Fairies enter . A second couple , also in masquerade , ask Ford to deliver the same blessing for them as well . Ford conducts the double ceremony . Caius finds that instead of Nannetta , his bride is the disguised Bardolfo , and Ford has unwittingly blessed the marriage of Fenton and Nannetta . Ford accepts the fait accompli with good grace . Falstaff , pleased to find himself not the only dupe , proclaims in a fugue , which the entire company sings , that all the world is folly , and all are figures of fun ( <unk> nel mondo è <unk> ... Tutti <unk> ! / " Everything in the world is a jest ... " ) . 
 = = Music and drama = = 
 Verdi scored Falstaff for three flutes ( third doubling piccolo ) , two oboes , English horn , two clarinets , bass clarinet , two bassoons , four horns , three trumpets , four trombones , timpani , percussion ( triangle , cymbals , bass drum ) , harp , and strings . In addition , a guitar , natural horn , and bell are heard from offstage . Unlike most of Verdi 's earlier operatic scores , Falstaff is through @-@ composed . No list of numbers is printed in the published full score . The score differs from much of Verdi 's earlier work by having no overture : there are seven bars for the orchestra before the first voice ( Dr Caius ) enters . The critic Rodney Milnes comments that " enjoyment ... shines from every bar in its irresistible forward impulse , its effortless melody , its rhythmic vitality , and sureness of dramatic pace and construction . " In The New Grove Dictionary of Opera , Roger Parker writes that : 
 the listener is bombarded by a stunning diversity of rhythms , orchestral textures , melodic motifs and harmonic devices . Passages that in earlier times would have furnished material for an entire number here crowd in on each other , shouldering themselves unceremoniously to the fore in bewildering succession . 
 The opera was described by its creators as a commedia <unk> . McDonald commented in 2009 that Falstaff is very different – a stylistic departure – from Verdi 's earlier work . In McDonald 's view most of the musical expression is in the dialogue , and there is only one traditional aria . The result is that " such stylistic economy – more sophisticated , more challenging than he had employed before – is the keynote of the work . " McDonald argues that consciously or unconsciously , Verdi was developing the idiom that would come to dominate the music of the 20th century : " the lyricism is abbreviated , glanced at rather than indulged . Melodies bloom suddenly and then vanish , replaced by contrasting tempo or an unexpected phrase that introduces another character or idea " . In McDonald 's view the orchestral writing acts as a sophisticated commentator on the action . It has influenced at least one of Verdi 's operatic successors : in 1952 Imogen Holst , musical assistant to Benjamin Britten , wrote , after a performance of Falstaff , " I realised for the first time how much Ben owes to [ Verdi ] . There are orchestral bits which are just as funny to listen to as the comic instrumental bits in A. Herring ! " 
 The extent to which Falstaff is a " Shakespearian " opera has often been debated by critics . Although the action is taken from The Merry Wives of Windsor , some commentators feel that Boito and Verdi have transmuted Shakespeare 's play into a wholly Italian work . The soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf believed there was nothing English or Shakespearian about the comedy : " it was all done through the music " . In 1961 Peter Heyworth wrote in The Observer , " Because of Shakespeare we like to think of Falstaff as a work that has a certain Englishness . In fact the opera is no more English than Aida is Egyptian . Boito and Verdi between them transformed the fat knight into one of the archetypes of opera buffa . " Verdi himself , however , felt that the Falstaff of the opera is not a conventional Italian <unk> character , but portrays Shakespeare 's fuller , more ambiguous Falstaff of the Henry IV plays : " My Falstaff is not merely the hero of The Merry Wives of Windsor , who is simply a buffoon , and allows himself to be tricked by the women , but also the Falstaff of the two parts of Henry IV . Boito has written the libretto in accordance . " A contemporary critic argued that the text " imitated with marvellous accuracy the metre and rhythm of Shakespeare 's verse " , but Hepokoski notes Boito 's use of traditional Italian metric conventions . 
 Another recurrent question is how much , if at all , Verdi was influenced by Wagner 's comic opera Die Meistersinger . At the time of the premiere this was a sensitive subject ; many Italians were suspicious of or hostile to Wagner 's music , and were protective in a nationalistic way of Verdi 's reputation . Nevertheless , Verdi 's new style was markedly different from that of his popular works of the 1850s and 1860s , and it seemed to some to have Wagnerian echoes . In 1999 the critic Andrew Porter wrote , " That Falstaff was Verdi 's and Boito 's answer to Wagner 's Meistersinger seems evident now . But the Italian Falstaff moves more quickly . " Toscanini , who did more than anyone else to bring Falstaff into the regular operatic repertoire , commented : 
 the difference between Falstaff , which is the absolute masterpiece , and Die Meistersinger , which is an outstanding Wagnerian opera . Just think for a moment how many musical means – beautiful ones , certainly – Wagner must make use of to describe the Nuremberg night . And look how Verdi gets a similarly startling effect at a similar moment with three notes . 
 Verdi scholars including Julian Budden have analysed the music in symphonic terms – the opening section " a perfect little sonata movement " , the second act concluding with a variant of the classic slow concertante ensemble leading to a fast stretto , and the whole opera ending with " the most academic of musical forms " , a fugue . Milnes suggests that this shows " a wise old conservative 's warning about the excesses of the verismo school of Italian opera " already on the rise by the 1890s . Among the solo numbers woven into the continuous score are Falstaff 's " honour " monologue , which concludes the first scene , and his reminiscent arietta ( " Quand 'ero paggio " ) about himself as a young page . The young lovers , Nannetta and Fenton , are given a lyrical and playful duet ( " <unk> di foco " ) in Act I ; in Act III , Fenton 's impassioned love song , " Dal <unk> il canto <unk> vola " briefly becomes a duet when Nannetta joins him . She then has the last substantial solo section of the score , the " fairy " aria , " Sul fil d 'un <unk> <unk> " , described by Parker as " yet another aria suffused with the soft orchestral colours that characterize this scene " . 
 The score is seen by the critic Richard Osborne as rich in self @-@ parody , with sinister themes from Rigoletto and Un ballo in maschera transmuted into comedy . For Osborne the nocturnal music of Act III draws on the examples of Weber , Berlioz and Mendelssohn , creating a mood akin to that of Shakespeare 's A Midsummer Night 's Dream . Osborne views the whole opera as an ensemble piece , and he comments that grand soliloquy in the old Verdian style is reserved for Ford 's " jealousy " aria in Act II , which is almost tragic in style but comic in effect , making Ford " a figure to be laughed at . " Osborne concludes his analysis , " Falstaff is comedy 's musical apogee : the finest opera , inspired by the finest dramatist , by the finest opera composer the world has known " . 
 = = Recordings = = 
 There are two early recordings of Falstaff 's short arietta " Quand 'ero paggio " . Pini Corsi , the original Ford , recorded it in 1904 , and Maurel followed in 1907 . The first recording of the complete opera was made by Italian Columbia in March and April 1932 . It was conducted by Lorenzo <unk> with the chorus and orchestra of La Scala , and a cast including Giacomo Rimini as Falstaff and Pia <unk> as Alice . Some live stage performances were recorded in the 1930s , but the next studio recording was that conducted by Toscanini for broadcast by NBC in 1950 , released on disc by RCA . The first stereophonic recording was conducted by Herbert von Karajan for EMI in 1956 . 
 Among the singers whose performances of the title role are on live or studio recordings , Italians include Renato <unk> , Tito Gobbi , Rolando <unk> , Ruggero Raimondi , Mariano Stabile , Giuseppe <unk> and Giuseppe <unk> ; Francophone singers include Gabriel <unk> , Jean @-@ Philippe Lafont and José van Dam ; Germans include Walter Berry , Dietrich Fischer @-@ Dieskau and Hans Hotter ; and UK and US singers include Geraint Evans , Donald Gramm , Bryn Terfel , Leonard Warren and Willard White . 
 = Cy Young = 
 Denton True " Cy " Young ( March 29 , 1867 – November 4 , 1955 ) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher . During his 22 @-@ season baseball career ( 1890 – 1911 ) , he pitched for five different teams . Young established numerous pitching records , some of which have stood for a century . Young compiled 511 wins , which is most in Major League history and 94 ahead of Walter Johnson who is second on the list . Young was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937 . 
 One year after Young 's death , the Cy Young Award was created to honor the previous season 's best pitcher . 
 In addition to wins , Young still holds the major league records for most career innings pitched ( 7 @,@ 356 ) , most career games started ( 815 ) , and most complete games ( 749 ) . He also retired with 316 losses , the most in MLB history . Young 's 76 career shutouts are fourth all @-@ time . He also won at least 30 games in a season five times , with ten other seasons of 20 or more wins . In addition , Young pitched three no @-@ hitters , including the third perfect game in baseball history , first in baseball 's " modern era " . In 1999 , 88 years after his final major league appearance and 44 years after his death , editors at The Sporting News ranked Young 14th on their list of " Baseball 's 100 Greatest Players " . That same year , baseball fans named him to the Major League Baseball All @-@ Century Team . 
 Young 's career started in 1890 with the Cleveland Spiders . After eight years with the Spiders , Young was moved to St. Louis in 1899 . After two years there , Young jumped to the newly created American League , joining the Boston franchise . He was traded back to Cleveland in 1909 , before spending the final two months of his career with the Boston Rustlers . After his retirement , Young went back to his farm in Ohio , where he stayed until his death at age 88 in 1955 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Cy Young was the oldest child born to McKinzie Young , Jr. and German American Nancy <unk> . The couple had four more children : Jesse Carlton , Alonzo , Ella , and Anthony . When the couple married , McKinzie 's father gave him the 54 acres ( 220 @,@ 000 m2 ) of farm land he owned . Young was born in Gilmore , a tiny farming community located in Washington Township , <unk> County , Ohio . He was christened Denton True Young . Some sources later , and even today , list his middle name erroneously as " Tecumseh " , apparently as a result of being nicknamed " The Chief " by teammates . 
 He was raised on one of the local farms and went by the name Dent Young in his early years . Young was also known as " Farmer Young " and " <unk> Young " . Young stopped his formal education after he completed the sixth grade so he could help out on the family 's farm . In 1885 , Young moved with his father to Nebraska , and in the summer of 1887 , they returned to Gilmore . 
 Young played for many amateur baseball leagues during his youth , including a " semi @-@ pro " Carrollton team in 1888 . Young pitched and played second base . The first box score known containing the name Young came from that season . In that game , Young played first base and had three hits in three at @-@ bats . After the season , Young received an offer to play for the minor league Canton team , which started Young 's professional career .

 = = = Before Major League Baseball = = = 
 Young began his professional career in 1889 with the Canton , Ohio team of the Tri @-@ State League , a professional minor league . During his tryout , Young impressed the scouts , recalling years later , " I almost tore the boards off the grandstand with my fast ball . " Cy Young 's nickname came from the fences that he had destroyed using his fastball . The fences looked like a cyclone had hit them . Reporters later shortened the name to " Cy " , which became the nickname Young used for the rest of his life . During Young 's one year with the Canton team , he won 15 games and lost 15 . 
 Franchises in the National League , the major professional baseball league at the time , wanted the best players available to them . Therefore , in 1890 , Young signed with the Cleveland Spiders , a team which had moved from the American Association to the National League the previous year . 
 = = = Cleveland Spiders = = = 
 On August 6 , 1890 , Young 's major league debut , he pitched a three @-@ hit shutout . While Young was on the Spiders , Chief Zimmer was his catcher more often than any other player . Bill James , a baseball statistician , estimated that Zimmer caught Young in more games than any other battery in baseball history . 
 Early on , Young established himself as one of the harder @-@ throwing pitchers in the game . Bill James wrote that Zimmer often put a piece of beefsteak inside his baseball glove to protect his catching hand from Young 's fastball . In the absence of radar guns , however , it is impossible to say just how hard Young actually threw . Young continued to perform at a high level during the 1890 season . On the last day of the season , Young won both games of a doubleheader . In the first weeks of Young 's career , Cap Anson , the player @-@ manager of the Chicago Colts spotted Young 's ability . Anson told Spiders ' manager Gus <unk> , " He 's too green to do your club much good , but I believe if I taught him what I know , I might make a pitcher out of him in a couple of years . He 's not worth it now , but I 'm willing to give you $ 1 @,@ 000 ( $ 26 @,@ 337 today ) for him . " <unk> replied , " Cap , you can keep your thousand and we 'll keep the rube . " 
 Two years after Young 's debut , the National League moved the pitcher 's position back by 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) . Since 1881 , pitchers had pitched within a " box " whose front line was 50 feet ( 15 m ) from home base , and since 1887 they had been compelled to toe the back line of the box when delivering the ball . The back line was 55 feet 6 inches ( 16 @.@ 92 m ) away from home . In 1893 , 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) was added to the back line , yielding the modern pitching distance of 60 feet 6 inches ( 18 @.@ 44 m ) . In the book The Neyer / James Guide to Pitchers , sports journalist Rob Neyer wrote that the speed with which pitchers like Cy Young , Amos Rusie , and Jouett <unk> threw was the impetus that caused the move . 
 The 1892 regular season was a success for Young , who led the National League in wins ( 36 ) , ERA ( 1 @.@ 93 ) , and shutouts ( 9 ) . Just as many contemporary Minor League Baseball leagues operate today , the National League was using a split season format during the 1892 season . The Boston Beaneaters won the first @-@ half title , and the Spiders won the second @-@ half title , with a best @-@ of @-@ nine series determining the league champion . Despite the Spiders ' second half run , the Beaneaters swept the series , five games to none . Young pitched three complete games in the series , but lost two decisions . He also threw a complete game shutout , but the game ended in a 0 – 0 tie . 
 The Spiders faced the Baltimore Orioles in the Temple Cup , a precursor to the World Series , in 1895 . Young won three games in the series and Cleveland won the Cup , four games to one . It was around this time that Young added what he called a " slow ball " to his pitching repertoire to reduce stress on his arm . The pitch today is called a changeup . 
 In 1896 , Young lost a no @-@ hitter with two outs in the ninth inning when Ed Delahanty of the Philadelphia Phillies hit a single . On September 18 , 1897 , Young pitched the first no @-@ hitter of his career in a game against the Cincinnati Reds . Although Young did not walk a batter , the Spiders committed four errors while on defense . One of the errors had originally been ruled a hit , but the Cleveland third baseman sent a note to the press box after the eighth inning , saying he had made an error , and the ruling was changed . Young later said , that , despite his teammate 's gesture , he considered the game to be a one @-@ hitter . 
 = = = Shift to St. Louis = = = 
 Prior to the 1899 season , Frank Robison , the Spiders owner , bought the St. Louis Browns , thus owning two clubs simultaneously . The Browns were renamed the " Perfectos " , and restocked with Cleveland talent . Just weeks before the season opener , most of the better Spiders players were transferred to St. Louis , including fellow pitcher Pete McBride and three future Hall of Famers : Young , Jesse Burkett , and Bobby Wallace . The roster maneuvers failed to create a powerhouse Perfectos team , as St. Louis finished fifth in both 1899 and 1900 . Meanwhile , the depleted Spiders lost 134 games , the most in MLB history , before folding . Young spent two years with St. Louis , which is where he found his favorite catcher , Lou <unk> . The two men were teammates for a decade . 
 = = = Move to the American League = = = 
 In 1901 , the rival American League declared major league status and set about raiding National League rosters . Young left St. Louis and joined the American League 's Boston Americans for a $ 3 @,@ 500 contract ( $ 99 @,@ 554 today ) . Young would remain with the Boston team until 1909 . In his first year in the American League , Young was dominant . Pitching to <unk> , who had also jumped to Boston , Young led the league in wins , strikeouts , and ERA , thus earning the colloquial AL Triple Crown for pitchers . Young won almost 42 % of his team 's games in 1901 , accounting for 33 of his team 's 79 wins . In February 1902 , before the start of the baseball season , Young served as a pitching coach at Harvard University . The sixth @-@ grade graduate instructing Harvard students delighted Boston newspapers . The following year , Young coached at Mercer University during the spring . The team went on to win the Georgia state championship in 1903 , 1904 , and 1905 . 
 The Boston Americans played the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first modern World Series in 1903 . Young , who started Game One against the visiting Pirates , thus threw the first pitch in modern World Series history . The Pirates scored four runs in that first inning , and Young lost the game . Young performed better in subsequent games , winning his next two starts . He also drove in three runs in Game Five . Young finished the series with a 2 – 1 record and a 1 @.@ 85 ERA in four appearances , and Boston defeated Pittsburgh , five games to three games . 
 After one @-@ hitting Boston on May 2 , 1904 , Philadelphia Athletics pitcher Rube Waddell taunted Young to face him so that he could repeat his performance against Boston 's ace . Three days later , Young pitched a perfect game against Waddell and the Athletics . It was the first perfect game in American League history . Waddell was the 27th and last batter , and when he flied out , Young shouted , " How do you like that , you <unk> ? " Waddell had picked an inauspicious time to issue his challenge . Young 's perfect game was the centerpiece of a pitching streak . Young set major league records for the most consecutive scoreless innings pitched and the most consecutive innings without allowing a hit ; the latter record still stands at 25 @.@ 1 innings , or 76 hitless batters . Even after allowing a hit , Young 's scoreless streak reached a then @-@ record 45 shutout innings . Before Young , only two pitchers had thrown perfect games . This occurred in 1880 , when Lee Richmond and John Montgomery Ward pitched perfect games within five days of each other , although under somewhat different rules : the front edge of the pitcher 's box was only 45 feet ( 14 m ) from home base ( the modern release point is about 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) farther away ) ; walks required eight balls ; and pitchers were obliged to throw side @-@ armed . Young 's perfect game was the first under the modern rules established in 1893 . One year later , on July 4 , 1905 , Rube Waddell beat Young and the Americans , 4 – 2 , in a 20 @-@ inning matchup . Young pitched 13 consecutive scoreless innings before he gave up a pair of unearned runs in the final inning . Young did not walk a batter and was later quoted : " For my part , I think it was the greatest game of ball I ever took part in . " In 1907 , Young and Waddell faced off in a scoreless 13 @-@ inning tie . 
 In 1908 , Young pitched the third no @-@ hitter of his career . Three months past his 41st birthday , Cy Young was the oldest pitcher to record a no @-@ hitter , a record which would stand 82 years until 43 @-@ year @-@ old Nolan Ryan surpassed the feat . Only a walk kept Young from his second perfect game . After that runner was caught stealing , no other batter reached base . At this time , Young was the second @-@ oldest player in either league . In another game one month before his no @-@ hitter , he allowed just one single while facing 28 batters . On August 13 , 1908 , the league celebrated " Cy Young Day . " No American League games were played on that day , and a group of All @-@ Stars from the league 's other teams gathered in Boston to play against Young and the Red Sox . When the season ended , he posted a 1 @.@ 26 ERA , which gave him not only the lowest in his career , but also gave him a Major League record of being the oldest pitcher with 150 + innings pitched to post a season ERA under 1 @.@ 50 . 
 = = = Cleveland Naps and retirement = = = 
 Young was traded back to Cleveland , the place where he played over half his career , before the 1909 season , to the Cleveland Naps of the American League . The following season , 1910 , he won his 500th career game on July 19 against Washington . He split 1911 , his final year , between the Naps and the Boston Rustlers . 
 On September 22 , 1911 , Young shut out the Pittsburgh Pirates , 1 – 0 , for his last career victory . In his final start two weeks later , the last eight batters of Young 's career combined to hit a triple , four singles , and three doubles .

 In February 1902 , before the start of the baseball season , Young served as a pitching coach at Harvard University . The sixth @-@ grade graduate instructing Harvard students delighted Boston newspapers . The following year , Young coached at Mercer University , in Macon , Georgia during the spring . The team went on to win the Georgia state championship in 1903 , 1904 , and 1905 . 
 = = After baseball = = 
 Beginning in 1912 , Young lived and worked on his farm . In 1913 , he served as manager of the Cleveland Green Sox of the Federal League , which was at the time an outlaw minor league . However , he never worked in baseball after that . 
 Young 's wife , Roba , whom he had known since childhood , died in 1933 . After she died , Young tried several jobs , and eventually moved in with friends John and Ruth Benedum and did odd jobs for them . Young took part in many baseball events after his retirement . In 1937 , 26 years after he retired from baseball , Young was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame . He was among the first to donate mementos to the Hall . 
 By 1940 , Young 's only source of income was stock dividends of $ 300 per year ( $ 5 @,@ 067 today ) . On November 4 , 1955 , Young died on the Benedum 's farm at the age of 88 . He was buried in <unk> , Ohio . 
 = = Baseball legacy = = 
 Young retired with 511 career wins , which remains the record for most career wins by a pitcher . At the time , Pud Galvin had the second most career wins with 364 . Walter Johnson , then in his fourth season , finished his career with 417 wins and , as of 2015 , remains second on the list . In 1921 , Johnson broke Young 's career record for strikeouts . 
 Young 's career is seen as a bridge from baseball 's earliest days to its modern era ; he pitched against stars such as Cap Anson , already an established player when the National League was first formed in 1876 , as well as against Eddie Collins , who played until 1930 . When Young 's career began , pitchers delivered the baseball underhand and fouls were not counted as strikes . The pitcher 's mound was not moved back to its present position of 60 feet 6 inches ( 18 @.@ 44 m ) until Young 's fourth season ; he did not wear a glove until his sixth season . 
 Young led his league in wins five times ( 1892 , 1895 , and 1901 – 1903 ) , finishing second twice . His career high was 36 in 1892 . He had fifteen seasons with twenty or more wins , two more than the runners @-@ up , Christy Mathewson and Warren Spahn . Young won two ERA titles during his career , in 1892 ( 1 @.@ 93 ) and in 1901 ( 1 @.@ 62 ) , and was three times the runner @-@ up . Young 's earned run average was below 2 @.@ 00 six times , but this was not uncommon during the dead @-@ ball era . Although Young threw over 400 innings in each of his first four full seasons , he did not lead his league until 1902 . He had 40 or more complete games nine times . Young also led his league in strikeouts twice ( with 140 in 1896 , and 158 in 1901 ) , and in shutouts seven times . Young led his league in fewest walks per nine innings thirteen times and finished second one season . Only twice in his 22 @-@ year career did Young finish lower than 5th in the category . Although the WHIP ratio was not calculated until well after Young 's death , Young was the retroactive league leader in this category seven times and was second or third another seven times . Young is tied with Roger Clemens for the most career wins by a Boston Red Sox pitcher . They each won 192 games while with the franchise . 
 Particularly after his fastball slowed , Young relied upon his control . Young was once quoted as saying , " Some may have thought it was essential to know how to curve a ball before anything else . Experience , to my mind , teaches to the contrary . Any young player who has good control will become a successful curve pitcher long before the pitcher who is endeavoring to master both curves and control at the same time . The curve is merely an accessory to control . " In addition to his exceptional control , Young was also a workhorse who avoided injury . For nineteen consecutive years , from 1891 through 1909 , Young was in his leagues ' top ten for innings pitched ; in fourteen of the seasons , he was in the top five . Not until 1900 , a decade into his career , did Young pitch two consecutive incomplete games . By habit , Young restricted his practice throws in spring training . " I figured the old arm had just so many throws in it " , said Young , " and there wasn 't any use wasting them . " Young once described his approach before a game : 
 I never warmed up ten , fifteen minutes before a game like most pitchers do . I 'd loosen up , three , four minutes . Five at the outside . And I never went to the bullpen . Oh , I 'd relieve all right , plenty of times , but I went right from the bench to the box , and I 'd take a few warm @-@ up pitches and be ready . Then I had good control . I aimed to make the batter hit the ball , and I threw as few pitches as possible . That 's why I was able to work every other day . 
 By the time of his retirement , Young 's control had faltered . He had also gained weight . In three of his last four years , he was the oldest player in the league . 
 In 1956 , about one year after Young 's death , the Cy Young Award was created . The first award was given to Brooklyn 's Don Newcombe . Originally , it was a single award covering the whole of baseball . The honor was divided into two Cy Young Awards in 1967 , one for each league . 
 On September 23 , 1993 , a statue dedicated to him was unveiled by Northeastern University on the site of the Red Sox 's original stadium , the Huntington Avenue Grounds . It was there that Young had pitched the first game of the 1903 World Series , as well as the first perfect game in the modern era of baseball . A home plate @-@ shaped plaque next to the statue reads : 
 On October 1 , 1903 the first modern World Series between the American League champion Boston Pilgrims ( later known as the Red Sox ) and the National League champion Pittsburgh Pirates was played on this site . General admission tickets were fifty cents . The Pilgrims , led by twenty @-@ eight game winner Cy Young , trailed the series three games to one but then swept four consecutive victories to win the championship five games to three . 
 = Siward Barn = 
 Siward Barn ( Old English : <unk> Bearn ) was an 11th @-@ century English thegn and landowner @-@ warrior . He appears in the extant sources in the period following the Norman Conquest of England , joining the northern resistance to William the Conqueror by the end of the 1060s . Siward 's resistance continued until his capture on the Isle of Ely alongside Æthelwine , Bishop of Durham , Earl Morcar , and Hereward ( " the Wake " ) as cited in the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle . Siward and his confiscated properties in central and northern England were mentioned in Domesday Book , and from this it is clear that he was one of the main <unk> of Henry de Ferrers , father of Robert de Ferrers , the first Earl of Derby . 
 Following his capture in 1071 , he was imprisoned . This incarceration lasted until 1087 , when a guilt @-@ ridden King William , in expectation of his own death , ordered Siward 's release . Firm evidence of Siward 's later life is non @-@ existent , but some historians have argued that he took up a career in the Varangian Guard at Constantinople , in the service of the Emperor Alexios I Komnenos . The sources upon which this theory is based also allege that Siward led a party of English colonists to the Black Sea , who renamed their conquered territory New England . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Identifying Siward 's origin is difficult for historians because of the large number of Siwards in England in the mid @-@ 11th century . Other notable Siwards include Siward of Maldon and Siward Grossus , both men of substance with landholdings larger or comparable to Siward Barn 's . The Anglo @-@ Norman writer Orderic Vitalis , when describing William the Conqueror 's stay at Barking , says that Morcar , formerly Earl of Northumbria , and <unk> , Earl of Mercia , came and submitted to King William , followed by <unk> , Earl of Northumbria , along with <unk> of <unk> , Eadric the Wild , and " Ealdred and Siward , the sons of Æthelgar , grandsons [ or grand @-@ nephews ] ( <unk> ) of King Edward " . 
 Edward Augustus Freeman and other historians have thought that this Siward was Siward Barn , arguing that Siward must have been a descendant of Uhtred the Bold , Earl of Northumbria , and Ælfgifu , daughter of King Æthelred the Unready , King Edward 's father . Historian and translator of Orderic , Marjorie Chibnall , pointed out that this Siward is mentioned later in his Ecclesiastical History as a Shropshire landowner , in connection with the foundation of Shrewsbury Abbey . Ann Williams likewise rejected this identification , identifying this Siward firmly with the Shropshire thegn Siward Grossus . According to Williams ' reconstruction , Siward Grossus and his brother Ealdred were the sons of Æthelgar by a daughter of Eadric Streona , Ealdorman of Mercia and Eadgyth , another daughter of King Æthelred , explaining the relationship Orderic believed they had with Edward the Confessor . 
 Another historian , Forrest Scott , guessed that Siward was a member of the family of Northumbrian earls , presumably connected in some way to Siward , Earl of Northumbria . Margaret <unk> and Marie Stinson , the editors of the <unk> Domesday Book for Yorkshire , believed that Siward was " a senior member of the house of Bamburgh and possibly a brother or half @-@ brother of Earl Gospatric " . Another historian , Geoffrey Barrow , pointed out that <unk> and Stinson gave no evidence for this assertion , and doubted the hypothesis because of Siward 's Danish name . 
 = = From York to Ely = = 
 In 1068 , there was a revolt in the north of England against the rule of King William , few details of which are recorded . It was serious enough to worry King William , who marched north and began the construction of castles at Warwick , Nottingham , York , Lincoln , Huntingdon and Cambridge . Earl <unk> apparently fled to Scotland and in the beginning of 1069 King William appointed the Picard Robert de Comines as the new earl of Northumbria . 
 During the winter the English murdered Earl William and Robert fitz Richard , the custodian of the new castle at York , and trapped William Malet , the first Norman sheriff of York , in the castle . King William went north in the spring or summer of 1069 , relieved the siege of Malet , and restored the castle , placing William fitz Osbern in charge . The leaders of the revolt were Edgar the Ætheling ( claimant to the English throne ) , Gospatric of Northumbria , and , among others , Mærle @-@ Sveinn , former sheriff of Lincoln , and many senior Northumbria nobles . 
 In the autumn of 1069 , a fleet under the Danish king Sweyn Estridsson and his brother Earl Osbjorn arrived off the coast of England . It is from this point that Siward 's involvement in the revolt is documented . Orderic Vitalis related that : 
 The Ætheling , Waltheof , Siward , and the other English leaders had joined the Danes ... The Danes reached York , and a general rising of the inhabitants swelled their ranks . Waltheof , Gospatric ( Gaius Patricius ) , Mærle @-@ Sveinn ( Marius <unk> ) , <unk> , <unk> , and the four sons of Karle were in the advance guard and led the Danish and Norwegian forces . 
 What followed was William 's most devastating punitive expedition , the so @-@ called " Harrying of the North " , conducted during the winter of 1069 / 70 . After two minor engagements disadvantageous to the Danes , King William came to an agreement with Earl Osbjorn that neutralised them . William held Christmas court at the ruined city of York , and brought Waltheof and Gospatric back into his peace at the River Tees . 
 Siward was at Wearmouth in the summer of 1070 , with Edgar and Mærle @-@ Sveinn , while William marched to the River Tyne with his marauding army . Although William burnt down the church of Jarrow , he left Edgar 's party undisturbed . Siward must have gone to Scotland in this year , for the Historia Regum reports that in 1071 Morcar ( previously earl of Northumbria ) and Hereward went by ship to the Isle of Ely , and that " Æthelwine , bishop of Durham , and Siward , nicknamed Barn , sailing back from Scotland " arrived there too . This is also related by the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , which confirms that : 
 Bishop Æthelwine and <unk> Bearn came to Ely and many hundred men with them " . 
 It was at Ely that Siward and all the other notables , save Hereward , were captured by King William . 
 = = Confiscation and release = = 
 By 1086 , perhaps soon before or after his capture , many of Siward 's lands were given to the Norman warrior Henry de Ferrers , though other successors included Geoffrey de La <unk> and William d <unk> . According to the Domesday Book , in " the time of Edward " ( TRE ) , or rather on the day of the death of Edward the Confessor , Siward held twenty @-@ one manors in eight different English counties . 
 In Berkshire , Greenham ( £ 8 ) , <unk> ( £ 10 ) and Stanford in the Vale ( £ 30 ; now in Oxfordshire ) ; in Gloucestershire , Lechlade ( £ 20 ) ; in Warwickshire , Grendon ( £ 2 ) , Burton Hastings ( £ 4 ) and Harbury ( £ 2 ) ; in Derbyshire , <unk> ( £ 6 ) , <unk> ( £ 3 ) , Catton ( £ 3 ) , <unk> ( £ 5 ) , Norbury and <unk> ( £ 5 ) , Duffield ( £ 9 ) , <unk> ( £ 4 ) , " <unk> " ( waste ) and <unk> ( waste ) ; in Nottinghamshire , Leake ( £ 6 ) and Bonnington ( s . 6 ) ; in Yorkshire Adlingfleet ( £ 4 ) ; in Lincolnshire , Whitton ( £ 10 ) and <unk> ( 5 ) ; and in Norfolk Sheringham ( £ 4 ) and Salthouse ( £ 2 ) . Ann Williams doubted that the estates in Berkshire belonged to Siward Barn , noting the possibility that these estates belonged to Siward of Maldon . 
 The total value of his holdings is put at 142 libra ( " pounds " ) and 6 solidi ( " shillings " ) . Siward Barn ranks 21st out of all the English landowners in the time of King Edward below the rank of earl . 
 Nothing more is heard of Siward until 1087 , the year of the death of William the Conqueror . The Chronicle of John of Worcester relates that : 
 On his [ King William 's ] return [ from France ] fierce intestinal pains afflicted him , and he got worse from day to day . When , as his illness worsened , he felt the day of his death approaching , he set free his brother , Odo , bishop of Bayeux , earls <unk> and Roger , Siward called Barn , and Wulfnoth , King Harold 's brother ( whom he had kept in custody since childhood ) , as well as all he had kept imprisoned either in England or Normandy . Then he handed the English kingdom over to William [ Rufus ] , and granted the Norman duchy to Robert [ Curthose ] , who was then exiled in France . In this way , fortified by the holy viaticum , he abandoned both life and kingdom on Thursday , 9 September , after ruling the English kingdom for twenty years , ten months , and twenty @-@ eight days . 
 A similar account is in the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , recension E , though specific names are omitted . This unfortunately is also the last notice of Siward in any near @-@ contemporary , reliable source . 
 = = Varangian and colonist ? = = 
 Two modern historians , however , have argued that Siward subsequently became a mercenary in the service of the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos . A 13th @-@ century French chronicle known as the Chronicon Laudunensis ( or Chronicon universale <unk> Laudunensis , " the anonymous universal chronicle of Laon " ) and the 14th century Icelandic text , the Játvarðar Saga , a short saga devoted to the life of Edward the Confessor , both relate a story about English warriors who sail to Constantinople to escape the dominion of the Normans , and found a colony in the Black Sea called New England . The Játvarðar Saga says that the leader of this expedition was one " Siward earl of Gloucester " ( <unk> jarl af <unk> ) . 
 Siward and his force were said to have rescued Constantinople from a siege by " heathens " , after which the emperor Alexios offered Siward and his men positions in the Varangian Guard . According to both sources , Siward and some of the English expressed their desire to have a territory of their own , and so Alexius told them of a land over the sea that had formerly been part of the empire , but was now occupied by heathens . The emperor subsequently granted this land to the English , and a party led by Earl Siward sailed onwards to take control of it . The land , the sources allege , lay " 6 days north and north @-@ east of Constantinople " , a distance and direction that puts the territory somewhere in or around the Crimea and Sea of Azov . Earl Siward , after many battles , defeated and drove away the heathens . The Chronicon Laudunensis says that this territory was renamed " New England " , while the Játvarðar Saga claims that the towns of the land were named after English towns , including London and York . The Chronicon alleges that , later , the English rebelled against Byzantine authority and became pirates . 
 The theory that this Siward is Siward Barn was advocated by Jonathan Shepard and Christine Fell . Shepard pointed out , although never called " Earl of Gloucester " , Siward had holdings in Gloucestershire – the only substantial Siward in Domesday Book with property in that county — and was indeed a participant in resistance to the Normans . Shepard argued that the narrative in question referred not , as the Chronicon Laudunensis had asserted , to the 1070s , but to the 1090s , after Siward 's release from prison . Fell , while acknowledging that there were two Siwards participating in resistance to William the Conqueror , Siward Barn and Siward of Maldon , pointed out that Siward Barn is more prominent in the literary sources and , unlike Siward of Maldon , had property in Gloucestershire . Two other historians who have since commented on the point , John Godfrey and Ann Williams , accepted that the identification is tenuous and remained neutral . 
 = Readville ( MBTA station ) = 
 Readville is a passenger rail station located slightly northwest of Wolcott Square in the Readville section of the Hyde Park neighborhood of Boston , Massachusetts . It serves multiple lines on the MBTA ( Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority ) Commuter Rail system , with access to the Fairmount Line and Franklin Line on separate platforms . Readville is the terminus of the Fairmount Line , although a small number of rush hour trains continue through the station to and from the Franklin Line . The station has platforms in place on the Northeast Corridor , but they are not used by Providence / Stoughton Line trains except during service disruptions . 
 Passenger service has run to Readville continuously since the Boston and Providence Railroad opened in 1834 . Separate stations on two levels were consolidated by the New Haven Railroad around 1898 . Until 1958 , the railroad had its heavy maintenance facilities located in Readville 5 @-@ Yard to the west of the station . The station building burned down in 1983 , but the MBTA built replacement platforms and ramps in 1992 .

 = = = Early stations = = = 
 The Boston and Providence Railroad was built through Readville starting in 1832 , and passenger service on the main line and a branch to Dedham began in 1834 . The Norfolk County Railroad built the Midland Division starting in 1853 from Islington to Boston through Readville , and full service began in July 1855 . The Midland Branch , also called the Dorchester Branch , connected the Norfolk County Railroad ( which then ran to Blackstone , Massachusetts to Boston . The Midland Division crossed the Boston & Providence on a high grade and bridge ; there was initially no track connection between the two railroads . The Norfolk County was acquired by the Boston , Hartford and Erie Railroad in 1868 and then to the New York and New England Railroad in 1875 , becoming the latter 's primary route into Boston . Readville served as a short turn turnback point for B & P trains from 1867 to 1880 and after 1899 . 
 The Midland Branch station , located on the upper level closer to Wolcott Square , was originally known as Blue Hills after the nearby range of hills However , by 1888 it too was known as Readville . Near the beginning of the 20th century , the two stations were consolidated as one under the New Haven . After the New York , New Haven and Hartford Railroad acquired the Boston & Providence in 1893 and the NY & NE in 1898 , the two stations were consolidated . A connecting track was built in 1899 allowing trains from Franklin and beyond to run on the Northeast Corridor to Boston , and the two @-@ story Readville depot was built to serve both levels on the station . An under @-@ track passage provided access to the southbound B & P platform and the NY & NE track area . 
 = = = Dedham and Midland branches = = = 
 The Dedham Branch briefly became an important piece of the New Haven 's commuter system . Between 1926 and 1938 , trains operated on a loop using the Dedham Branch and the Norfolk County Railroad 's former route through West Roxbury ( part of which is now part of the Needham Line ) . In 1940 , service to Dedham via West Roxbury was discontinued , leaving the Dedham Branch as the only rail access to Dedham . However , traffic to Dedham continued to decline , and the last service ( a single daily round trip ) to Dedham via the Dedham Branch ended on April 21 , 1967 . The MBTA purchased the abandoned right of way from Penn Central on January 27 , 1973 . 
 The Midland Branch also declined in importance after the Franklin division was connected to the New Haven mainline in 1899 . Through trains from Connecticut were redirected to the mainline at Readville , leaving only Franklin and Readville locals to use the Midland . Service on the line from Boston to Readville was discontinued in 1938 ; it returned in 1940 but ended more permanently in March 1944 . Through trains to Connecticut ( discontinued in 1955 ) and commuter trains to Blackstone ( discontinued April 24 , 1966 ) and Franklin continued to use the section from Readville to Islington .

 From 1944 to 1979 , the configuration of Readville was static : the two @-@ story depot served the lower level ( Northeast Corridor ) tracks , while the elevated track to Franklin and beyond was served by a small shack with stairs to the lower level . Starting in 1979 , construction of the Southwest Corridor necessitated closure of the main line between Back Bay and Forest Hills . From November 3 , 1979 until October 5 , 1987 , all Franklin Line and Providence / Stoughton Line service ran to Boston on the Midland Division via Readville . 
 The two @-@ story station building was destroyed by a fire on June 11 , 1983 . The building had been vacant since the early 1970s and was a frequent target of vandalism ; the fire was judged to be of suspicious origin . The MBTA did not replace the building , but handicapped @-@ accessible platforms were installed in 1992 and were connected with footbridges . 
 When Franklin and Providence / Stoughton service returned to the main line , service on the Midland had become popular enough to justify a continued shuttle service along the line from Boston to Fairmount . The Fairmount Shuttle was extended to Readville on November 30 , 1987 as the Fairmount Line . Since 1987 , Providence / Stoughton Line service has run through Readville without making a station stop , even though there are platforms in place to allow such use . 
 The 1898 @-@ built bridge over the Northeast Corridor , now used by Franklin Line trains running via Fairmount , is planned for replacement . The span will be replaced with a <unk> bridge in a single weekend with minimal impact to Amtrak and MBTA service on the Corridor , with the old abutments left in place as retaining walls . The design contract was awarded in 2012 , and a construction contract was to be awarded in 2015 . 
 = = = Proposed Orange Line extension = = = 
 Readville is located in a densely populated neighborhood just nine miles from downtown Boston , making it a strong candidate for rapid transit service rather than conventional low @-@ frequency commuter rail service . The 1945 Coolidge Commission Report recommended that an extension of the Orange Line south from Forest Hills be built to Dedham via West Roxbury rather than Hyde Park and Readville . The 1966 Program for Mass Transportation recommended a bifurcated Orange Line , with one branch to West Roxbury or Hersey and another to Readville or Route 128 via Hyde Park . Various reports over the next two decades continued to recommend various combinations of the extensions ; however , due to cost , the 1987 relocation of the Orange Line to the Southwest Corridor was terminated at Forest Hills . Hyde Park , Readville , and the Needham Line instead received limited upgrades like handicapped @-@ accessible platforms . 
 The 2004 Program for Mass Transportation listed an extension to Route 128 with intermediate stops at Mount Hope , Hyde Park , and Readville at a cost of $ 342 @.@ 8 million . The extension was listed as low priority due to environmental issue with crossing the wetlands south of Readville , and because the corridor already had commuter rail service .

 Readville has an unusual layout because it is built on the crossing of two rail lines . The Fairmount Line and Franklin Line each have a single track atop an embankment . The Fairmount Line has a single side platform , while the Franklin Line has two . The Fairmount Line track continues atop a bridge over the Northeast Corridor to join with the Franklin Line . This connection is used by several trains each rush hour , allowing trains from the Franklin Line to avoid congestion in the crowded Southwest Corridor . 
 At ground level , the three @-@ track Northeast Corridor runs through the station . There are two side platforms ; however , Providence / Stoughton Line trains do not stop at Readville in regular service . The platforms are occasionally used during service disruptions when Fairmount Line service is not running or when trains cannot stop at Hyde Park . 
 Next to the Franklin Line embankment , two abandoned tracks run to the former Dedham Branch and Readville 5 @-@ Yard . 
 Readville station is fully handicapped accessible , although accessible routes are only available from the Hyde Park Avenue entrance . Every platform includes a 1 @-@ car length ( " mini @-@ high " ) high @-@ level platform , which allows passengers to board level with the train car floors . The platforms are all connected by a system of pedestrian bridges which include accessible ramps . 
 = = = Railroad yards = = = 
 Readville station is bounded by several railroad yards which were mostly built in the first half of the 20th century . East of the station on the Fairmount Line is the Readville Interim Repair Facility , an MBTA commuter rail maintenance facility and layover yard . Readville 1 @-@ Yard is an active CSX freight yard located south of the station , on tracks connecting the Fairmount Line to the Northeast Corridor . Additionally , there were formerly several yard tracks along the Northeast Corridor north of the station . 
 West of the station , Readville 5 @-@ Yard lies south of the former Dedham branch . The 42 @-@ acre ( 17 ha ) 5 @-@ Yard is split between Boston and Dedham , Massachusetts and was formerly owned and used by the New York , New Haven and Hartford Railroad , which had shops on the site until 1958 . The Penn Central Railroad acquired the yard along with the rest of the New Haven in 1968 ; the property was transferred to Conrail on March 30 , 1976 , and to Amtrak a day later . The MBTA acquired the yard from Amtrak on November 11 , 1987 and used it to store railroad @-@ related materials . Site remediation for environmental contamination including lead , arsenic , and PAHs was completed in 2011 . 
 In March 2012 , the MBTA announced that the contamination had been fully removed , and revealed plans to place solar panels in the west part of 5 @-@ Yard . The panels would be installed and maintained for at least 20 years by an outside contractor . Bidding began in May 2012 , with the stipulation that the solar array would be operational by the spring of 2013 . The contract was chosen in September 2012 , with a revised completion date of October 2013 . In July 2013 , MassDOT ( the MBTA 's parent agency ) announced that construction would not begin until at least 2014 due to a state solar program reaching capacity earlier than expected . As of January 2015 , the installation was to occur in June 2015 .

 = Snuffy 's Parents Get a Divorce = 
 " Snuffy 's Parents Get a Divorce " is an episode of the children 's television program Sesame Street . Produced in 1992 , it never aired because tests showed several unintended negative effects . Sesame Street has had a history of presenting difficult topics as part of its affective curriculum goals , including death , marriage , childbirth , and disaster . Extensive research was done before these episodes were written and produced , to ascertain their focus , and after they aired , to analyze the effect they had on viewers , and that was the case for " Snuffy 's Parents Get a Divorce " . The show 's producers had expressed a desire to produce the episode as early as 1989 , and they were convinced that it was a topic they should address after the US Census Bureau reported that 40 % of American children had experienced divorce . 
 The producers chose to present the Muppet Mr. Snuffleupagus ( " Snuffy " ) and his family 's experience of divorce . The episode was written by staff writer Norman Stiles , who also wrote the 1983 episode in which Mr. Hooper 's death was explained . Every word of the divorce episode was reviewed by the Children 's Television Workshop 's ( CTW ) advisory board , content experts , and developmental psychologists . After tests showed that their young viewers were confused by the episode and did not understand important concepts about divorce , the producers decided to not air it , despite the investment they had made . It was the first time the show 's producers made this kind of decision , and was cited as an example of the producer 's practice of " listening to the voices of children and by putting their needs first " , despite the costs . 
 Sesame Street did not address the topic of divorce until November 2012 , when they produced , for limited audiences , Little Children , Big Challenges : Divorce , as part of their resiliency initiative . Like in " Snuffy 's Parents Get a Divorce " , the production used a Muppet , Abby Cadabby , to represent the child experiencing divorce . Whereas Snuffy was shown going through it in real time , Abby 's parents ' divorce was in the past , which gave her time to adjust . 
 = = Background = = 
 Sesame Street , which premiered in 1969 , was the first children 's television program to use a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum , with specific educational goals , in its content . The show 's goals included both cognitive and affective objectives . Initially , the cognitive skills of its young viewers were stressed over affective skills , which were addressed indirectly because the producers , writers , and researchers believed that focusing on cognitive skills would increase children 's self @-@ esteem and feelings of competency . Eventually , after the show 's first season , its critics forced its staff to address affective goals more overtly , which occurred after " extensive research and planning " . 
 According to writer Michael Davis , Sesame Street 's curriculum began addressing affective goals more overtly during the 1980s . For example , the producers addressed grief after the 1982 death of Will Lee , who had played Mr. Hooper since the show 's premiere . Author David Borgenicht called the episode " poignant " , and Davis called it " a landmark broadcast " and " a truly memorable episode , one of the show 's best " . For the 1988 and 1989 seasons , the topics of love , marriage , and childbirth were addressed when the show 's staff created a storyline in which the characters Luis and Maria fall in love , marry , and have a child , Gabi . Extensive research was done before these episodes were written and produced , to ascertain their focus , and after they aired , to analyze the effect they had on viewers . The show also addressed real @-@ life disasters . For example , the producers addressed the September 11 terrorist attacks with an episode that aired in early 2002 . They also produced a series of four episodes that aired after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 . 
 = = Development = = 
 The Children 's Television Workshop ( CTW , later Sesame Workshop ) , the organization responsible for the production of Sesame Street , considered and discussed addressing the topic of divorce for many years before developing an episode . As early as 1989 , writer and director Jon Stone expressed his intention of writing a script about it , stating , " My two projects for this year are drugs and divorce . Divorce is a difficult one . Perhaps we could do it with puppets . I am also writing a script on drugs and peer pressure " . Executive producer Dulcy Singer vetoed the idea in 1990 , before it reached development . While she felt complex social matters should be discussed on the series , she felt the issue was irrelevant to inner city and financially disadvantaged families , which was the show 's target audience . She said that " divorce is a middle @-@ class thing , " and suggested instead that an episode focus on a single @-@ parent family , with the child born out of wedlock with an absent father . Singer stated , even after the episode was filmed , " We were really nervous about the show , and we didn 't think it was a shoo @-@ in . When you 're dealing with something like death , the approach can be universal . But with divorce , it 's so personal . People react differently . " The topic of divorce was discussed again the following year , after the US Census Bureau released statistics suggesting 40 percent of all children in the United States , not just the middle classes , would soon live in divorced households . 
 Producer / director Lisa Simon stated , regarding the difficulty the producers and writers had with crafting the episode , " We hope to get to it by the end of the season . It always takes us a while to figure out how to do an issue appropriately , from a child 's point of view " . Puppeteer Jerry Nelson , who was one of the original performers of Snuffy , noted , " Now we delve into things like divorce that are likely to affect small children very heavily . We didn 't touch those things before " . 
 Instead of using the human characters in the show 's cast , the writers and producers decided to use Muppets to present their narrative about the effects of divorce on young children . They chose to use the family of Mr. Snuffleupagus ( " Snuffy " ) , a large Muppet that had been on the show since 1971 . Long @-@ time cast member Bob McGrath stated , " They knew they couldn 't do it with either of our married couples — Gordon and Susan or Maria and Luis — so they tried it with Snuffleupagus , writing a show about his parents getting divorced " . According to Simon , " With puppets , it 's slightly less frightening ... The kids have somebody to identify with . They see the puppet characters have feelings and work through a difficult issue many of them will have to face " . 
 Staff writer Norman Stiles , who also wrote the episode in which Mr. Hooper 's death was explained , was assigned to compose the script . Every word of the divorce episode was reviewed by CTW 's advisory board , content experts , and developmental psychologists . The episode featured Gordon explaining the concept of divorce , Snuffy being assured that his parents still loved him , and the characters talking and singing " about how Snuffy will have good homes , and so on and so on " . 
 = = Test results = = 
 As with the Mr. Hooper episode , " Snuffy 's Parents Get a Divorce " was studied extensively for comprehension and attention . After it was filmed , it was screened before a test audience of 60 children in four daycare centers . The results found several unintended negative effects . As The Christian Science Monitor said , " it bombed " . Despite Gordon 's reassuring the Muppets Elmo , Big Bird , and Telly , children believed that their parents ' arguments would lead to their divorce . They also were unsure that Snuffy and his little sister Alice 's parents loved them despite the divorce , were unclear where the characters ' parents lived ( especially their father , who had never appeared on the show before ) . Many viewers also thought that Snuffy and Alice would never see their father again . According to Singer , " The kids came away with negative messages ... The kids misunderstood arguments . They said arguments did mean divorce . Some thought Snuffy 's parents were moving away even though we said just the opposite . A number said the parents would no longer be in love with them " . 
 Based upon their findings , and despite the expense and their intention to air " Snuffy 's Parents Get a Divorce " in April 1992 , the CTW decided not to risk possibly harming their audience and not air the episode . McGrath said , " They wrote a whole show and taped it , and it was just devastating for test groups of kids . So they just threw the whole thing in the garbage and never tried it again . It was just too difficult a concept for a 3 @-@ year @-@ old " . CTW Research director Valeria Lovelace recommended scrapping the episode and going " back to the drawing board " , and the idea was abandoned , at least for the season . Producer Michael Loman recalled , " We ate the cost and never aired it . We feel there are a range of issues that we can deal with in the family that do not go to the extreme of divorce " . According to Sesame Street researcher Susan Scheiner , it was the first time the CTW had produced an episode , and after making a large investment , found after tests that the episode did not work . Rosemarie T. Truglio and her colleagues at the CTW cited the episode as an example of the CTW 's practice of " listening to the voices of children and by putting their needs first " .

 Sesame Street did not address the subject of divorce until November 2012 , when its producers created , as part of their resiliency initiative , Little Children , Big Challenges : Divorce . It was made available to military families and to the general public through family courts , counseling services , and parenting and child care programs . It included a 22 @-@ minute DVD , a caregiver guide , a storybook , a tip sheet for extended families and friends , mobile apps and social networking sites , and an online toolkit .

 = Walther von Brauchitsch = 
 Heinrich Alfred Hermann Walther von Brauchitsch ( 4 October 1881 – 18 October 1948 ) was a German field marshal and the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the German Army in the early years of World War II . 
 Born into an aristocratic military family , Brauchitsch joined the 3rd Guards Grenadier Regiment 1901 . He served on the staff of several formations that fought over a dozen major battles of World War I , serving with the XVI Corps , 34th Infantry Division and Guards Reserve Corps as a staff officer before taking part in no fewer than twenty @-@ eight notable clashes on the Western Front , including the Battle of Verdun , the Battle of Armentières , the Battle at the Aisne , and the Battle of the Lys . For his service on the Western Front , he was awarded the Iron Cross and the House Order of Hohenzollern . 
 After Hitler 's rise to power in 1933 , Brauchitsch was put in charge of the East Prussian Military District , and became a popular officer because of his kindness to the civilian Prussian population in times of local fires . Although he personally disliked Nazism , he borrowed immense sums of money from Hitler and eventually became dependent on his financial help . Brauchitsch primarily served as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the German Army before World War II , from 1938 , and during the two first years of war , until 1941 . He played a key role in the Battle of France and oversaw the German military campaigns in Yugoslavia and Greece . For his part in Battle of France , Brauchitsch became one of 12 generals promoted to field marshal on 19 July 1940 . After a first heart attack in November 1941 and the failed Moscow offensive in December 1941 , Hitler dismissed him as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Army ; he spent the rest of the war in enforced retirement , and never saw Hitler again . After World War II , Brauchitsch was arrested on charges of war crimes , but died of a heart attack in 1948 before he could be prosecuted . 
 Brauchitsch married Elizabeth von Karstedt , an heiress from Brandenburg , in 1910 , with whom he had three children . They were divorced in 1938 and , shortly after , he married Charlotte <unk> . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Brauchitsch was born in Berlin on 4 October 1881 as the sixth child of Bernhard Eduard von Brauchitsch , a cavalry general , and his wife Charlotte Bertha von Gordon , a housewife . The Brauchitsch family , which originally came from Silesia , had a long tradition of military service , and like his forefathers , Brauchitsch was raised in the tradition of the Prussian officer corps . His family moved in the leading social circles of Berlin 's high society , and his family name and father 's military rank put him on equal footing with any officer or official . In his teens , Brauchitsch was interested in liberal and conservative politics , and was fascinated by the fine art pieces that were sculpted in Berlin in the late 1880s . To help him pursue these interests , his father enrolled him at <unk> Gymnasium Berlin rather than a military academy . 
 In 1895 Brauchitsch joined the military academy in Potsdam . He later transferred to the <unk> Groß Lichterfelde , where in his final year he belonged to the " <unk> " ( top class for gifted students ) . and was chosen , as his brother Adolf five years before , as a page by Empress Augusta Victoria . During his time serving the empress at court , he learned manners and bearing that were noted for the rest of his life . 
 Upon graduation he received his commission and joined the 9th Company of the 3 . Garde @-@ Grenadier @-@ Regiment " Königin @-@ Elisabeth " in Charlottenburg as second lieutenant on 22 March 1900 . A medical condition made him unfit for service in the infantry , and Brauchitsch made a request for secondment to the recently formed 3 . Garde @-@ <unk> @-@ Regiment ( 3rd Guards Field Artillery Regiment ) , which was granted on 1 December 1900 . After the secondment of six months , the commander of the regiment approved his permanent transfer to the regiment , where Brauchitsch , himself a keen horseman , was put in charge of training recruits in riding and driving . 
 While serving as an adjutant and later staff officer of his regiment , he noticed that his fellow officers and superiors showed no particular interest in artillery tactics . As he considered artillery to be his specialty , he instead joined the General Staff office in Berlin , where he was promoted to first lieutenant ( in 1909 ) . 
 = = World War I = = 
 By the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Brauchitsch had reached the rank of captain ( promoted in 1913 ) , and was appointed staff officer to the XVI Army Corps stationed near Metz . He would be in the thick of the Great War from start to finish serving in the 34th Infantry Division and Guards Reserve Corps . Between 1914 and 1916 , he was based near <unk> , <unk> , and Varennes , where he took part in the Battle of Verdun and Battle of the Argonne Forest . In the remaining two years of the conflict , Brauchitsch saw more action , taking part in notable engagements such as the third Battle of the Aisne , the Battle of Aisne @-@ Marne , the second Battle of the Aisne , the Battle of Armentières , and the Battle of Flanders . His contributions to the war effort did not go unnoticed ; Brauchitsch was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class and the House Order of Hohenzollern , and ended the war with the rank of major . 
 = = Weimar Republic = = 
 The German military underwent a forced reduction in 1919 to comply with the Treaty of Versailles , but Brauchitsch managed to stay in the military . He remained with the General Staff , where he had no opportunity to use his knowledge of artillery . Eventually , in 1920 , he was permitted to transfer to the staff of the 2nd Artillery Regiment . The following year , he worked in the Ministry of the Reichswehr , in the Artillery Department . 
 Brauchitsch 's assignment in the Artillery Department was to reorganize artillery formations and implement lessons learned in the closing months of the war . He added ideas of his own , including modifying the classification system for light , medium , and heavy artillery . Heavy artillery , formerly known as " corps artillery " , now became " reinforcement artillery " . He also added emphasis on the combination and co @-@ operation between artillery and infantry . 
 After three years in the Artillery Department , he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1925 . As of 1 November 1927 , Brauchitsch was appointed Chief of Staff of the 6th Infantry Division in Münster , Westphalia , one of the strongest garrisons in the west of Germany . In the last years of the Weimar Republic , he took over the Army Training Department and became a colonel ( promoted in 1928 ) . 
 = = Nazi Germany = = 
 In 1933 , Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power and began to expand the military , in order to realize Hitler 's military ambitions . Two years before , Brauchitsch had received his major general promotion . On 1 February 1933 , he was named commander of the East Prussian Military District ( Wehrkreis I ) and Chief of the 1st Division in Königsberg . As a consequence of the German re @-@ armament the command position Befehlshaber im Wehrkreis I ( Commander of the 1st Military District ) was expanded . The staff of the 1st Division formed the staff of the 1st Army Corps and Brauchitsch was appointed its first commanding general on 21 June 1935 . 
 Although Brauchitsch felt at home in Prussia , he had a clash with Erich Koch , the local Gauleiter ( party head and de facto head of civil administration of the province ) . Koch was known as somewhat of a crook who greatly enjoyed the power he possessed , and who would bring violence to his enemies . As neither Koch nor Brauchitsch wanted to lose their jobs in the region , the two attempted to keep their feud unofficial . As a result , Berlin hardly learned of their dispute . 
 A dispute emerged a few years later , when Brauchitsch learned that Reichsführer @-@ SS Heinrich Himmler planned to replace the army guards in East Prussia with SS men , with the purpose of persecuting Jews , Protestant and Catholic churches in the district . Even though Brauchitsch managed to prevent the SS replacement of the army troops in the region , Himmler categorized him as " a junker " , and informed Hitler of the disagreement . Brauchitsch claimed he had done his duty , saying laconically , " Civilians are not allowed to enter that area . " 
 Brauchitsch obtained the rank of general of artillery in 1936 . So when the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Army , Werner von Fritsch , was accused of homosexuality , Hitler appointed Brauchitsch a colonel general and the new army chief , on the recommendation of the Army High Command on 4 February 1938 . The homosexual allegations were in reality a trap set by Hitler as an excuse to dismiss one of the aristocratic senior officers within the Army High Command . Fritsch 's removal was a severe test of the stability of the German internal administration of that time . 
 Brauchitsch welcomed the Nazi policy of rearmament . The relationship between Hitler and Brauchitsch improved during Brauchitsch 's confusion about whether to leave his wife for his mistress , in the middle of the Munich Crisis ; Hitler set aside his usual anti @-@ divorce sentiments and encouraged Brauchitsch to divorce and remarry . Hitler even lent him 80 @,@ 000 Reichsmarks so he could afford the divorce . Over time , Brauchitsch became largely reliant on Hitler for financial help . 
 Like Colonel General Ludwig Beck , Brauchitsch opposed Hitler 's annexation of Austria and intervention in Czechoslovakia , although he did not resist Hitler 's plans for war , again preferring to refrain from politics . 
 In the final months before World War II , Brauchitsch focused on Italy 's potential to aid the Nazi military cause . This turned out not to be an easy task , as the Italian leader Benito Mussolini expected economic support from the Reich in return for his military collaboration . Fritsch had already told Brauchitsch that the Italian military was in " extremely poor fighting shape " . Joachim von Ribbentrop , Germany 's Foreign Minister and the main architect of the Axis alliance , constantly interfered with Brauchitsch 's efforts , as he wanted to see his work consolidated at all costs . 
 = = World War II = = 
 Even though Brauchitsch was in charge of operational affairs during the Polish and French campaigns , he had very little influence , as a whole , as to the war 's progress . During the invasion of Poland , he oversaw most plans . The campaign was often cited as the first example of " blitzkrieg " . Blitzkrieg was not a theory or an official doctrine . The Polish Campaign did not resemble the popular perception of what became known as blitzkrieg . The Panzer Divisions were spread thinly among the infantry and were not granted operational independence or grouped en masse , as they would in Western Europe . The operative method of the Wehrmacht in Poland followed the more traditional <unk> . What is commonly referred to as blitzkrieg did not develop until after the campaign in the west in June 1940 . It was not the cause but rather the consequence of victory . Brauchitsch himself had to be convinced that armour could act independently at the operational level , before the campaign . 
 By early November 1939 , Brauchitsch and Chief of the General Staff Franz Halder started to consider overthrowing Hitler , who had fixed " X @-@ day " , the invasion of France , as 12 November 1939 . Both officers believed that the invasion was doomed to fail . On 5 November 1939 , the Army General Staff prepared a special memorandum purporting to recommend against launching an attack on the Western powers that year . Brauchitsch reluctantly agreed to read the document to Hitler and did so in a meeting on 5 November . Brauchitsch attempted to talk Hitler into putting off X @-@ day by saying that morale in the German Army was worse than in 1918 , a statement that enraged Hitler . He harshly berated Brauchitsch for incompetence . Brauchitsch went on to complain : 
 The aggressive spirit of the German infantry is sadly below the standard of the First World War ... [ there has been ] certain symptoms of insubordination similar to those of 1917 – 18 . " 
 Hitler flew into a rage , accusing the General Staff and Brauchitsch personally of disloyalty , cowardice , sabotage , and defeatism . He returned to the army headquarters at Zossen , where he " arrived in such poor shape that at first he could only give a somewhat incoherent account of the proceedings . " After that meeting , both Brauchitsch and Halder told Carl Friedrich Goerdeler , a key leader of the anti @-@ Nazi movement , that overthrowing Hitler was simply something that they could not do and that he should find other officers to take part in the plot . Hitler called a meeting of the General Staff , where he declared that he would smash the West within a year . He also vowed to " destroy the spirit of Zossen " , a threat that panicked Halder to such an extent that he forced the conspirators to abort their second planned coup attempt . On 7 November , following heavy snowstorms , Hitler put off X @-@ Day until further notice , which removed Brauchitsch and Halder 's primary motivation for the plot . 
 While preparations were underway for the Battle of France , a German planner and strategist named Erich von Manstein , then serving as chief of staff of Army Group A , presented his famous Sichelschnitt ( " sickle cut " ) plan . Brauchitsch and Halder , however , did not approve of the plan . When Manstein insisted on the plan being accepted , Halder suggested transferring Manstein far away to the east , so as to reduce his influence in the planning process . Brauchitsch agreed and transferred him to Silesia . However , Hitler invited a group of officers to lunch , and Manstein was among them . He managed to present his plan directly to Hitler . The following day , Hitler ordered Brauchitsch to accept Manstein 's plan , which the Führer presented as his own . 
 Despite his original scepticism , Brauchitsch eventually saw the plan 's potential and felt that the army had a real chance of success in France . 
 After the surprisingly swift fall of France , Brauchitsch was promoted to field marshal in July 1940 , during the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony . After France had been occupied and divided , he and the rest of the high command were looking forward to a similarly easy and swift campaign against Great Britain , now seriously weakened by the French campaign . He was confident that Britain would be easily defeated : " We consider the victory already won . England remains secure , but only so long as we choose . " 
 Had Operation Sealion , the plan for the invasion of Britain , succeeded , Hitler intended to place Brauchitsch in charge of the new conquest . As the Luftwaffe could not gain the requisite air superiority , the Battle of Britain was lost and so the plan was shelved and eventually cancelled . 
 In the swift invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia and Greece in early April 1941 , the Germans committed some 337 @,@ 000 men , 2 @,@ 000 mortars , 1 @,@ 500 artillery pieces , 1 @,@ 100 anti @-@ tank guns , 875 tanks and 740 other armoured fighting vehicles , all of which were under the overall command of Brauchitsch . By the end of the month , all of Yugoslavia and Greece were in German hands . 
 Brauchitsch supported harsh measures against the Polish population , which he claimed were needed for securing German Lebensraum ( " living space " ) . He had a central role in the death sentences for Polish prisoners taken in the defense of the Polish Post Office in Danzig , rejecting the clemency appeal . 
 He ordered his army and commanders to cease criticism of racist Nazi policies , as harsh measures were needed for the " forthcoming battle of destiny of the German people " . When Germany turned East and invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 , he again played a key part , making modifications to the original plan . Like his friend and colleague , Wilhelm Keitel , Brauchitsch did not protest when Hitler gave the German army the same instructions as the SS on who to kill in the occupied territory , but he later issued a series of decrees that ordered that Commissars were to be shot only if their anti @-@ German sentiments were " especially recognizable " . 
 As the Battle of Moscow got underway , his health was starting to fail . Even so , he continued his work , as he was determined to take Moscow before the start of the severe Russian winter . The army 's failure to take Moscow earned Hitler 's enmity , and things worsened for him , as he endured a serious heart attack in November . He was also informed that he had a malignant cardiac disease , most likely incurable . 
 Like other generals in the aftermath of the failure at Moscow , Brauchitsch was made a scapegoat . He was dismissed as Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the German Army on 19 December and was transferred to the Führerreserve ( officers reserve ) , where he remained without assignment until the end of the war ; he never saw Hitler again . 
 Brauchitsch spent the last three years of the war in the <unk> <unk> hunting lodge in the <unk> mountains southwest of Prague . One of his few public comments after retirement was a statement condemning the 20 July plot against Hitler for which he denounced several former colleagues . Later , he excused himself to Halder , claiming he had been forced to do so to save a relative 's life . 
 = = = Trial and death = = = 
 After the war , in August 1945 , Brauchitsch was arrested at his estate and imprisoned at Camp 198 in South Wales . His war crime charges included conspiracy and crimes against humanity . He died on 18 October 1948 of bronchial pneumonia in a British @-@ controlled military hospital in Hamburg , aged 67 , before he could be prosecuted . He was buried at Salzgitter cemetery , Lower Saxony , Germany . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 In 1910 , Brauchitsch married his first wife , Elizabeth von Karstedt , a wealthy heiress to 300 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 200 km2 ) in Brandenburg . The couple had two sons and a daughter , including Bernd von Brauchitsch , who later served in the Luftwaffe during World War II as Hermann Göring 's adjutant . They were divorced in 1938 after 28 years of marriage , as Brauchitsch had developed another romantic interest . 
 In 1925 , Brauchitsch met Charlotte <unk> , the daughter of a Silesian judge . He wanted a divorce , but his wife refused . <unk> later married a bank director named Schmidt , who drowned in his bath during a visit to Berlin . When Brauchitsch returned from East Prussia in 1937 , the pair resumed their affair . They married immediately after Brauchitsch had divorced Karstedt . 
 Brauchitsch was the uncle of Manfred von Brauchitsch , a 1930s Mercedes @-@ Benz " Silver Arrow " Grand Prix driver , and also Hans Bernd von Haeften and Werner von Haeften , who were members of the German resistance against Hitler . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 Historian Helmut <unk> characterizes Brauchitsch as " an outstanding professional who lived up to the traditions of his profession , but especially lacked the strength of personality to deal with Hitler " . Historian Ian Kershaw on the other hand regards Brauchitsch as a " spineless individual , who was frightened by Hitler . He was no person to lead any type of front or revolt . "

 = It 's All Coming Back to Me Now = 
 " It 's All Coming Back to Me Now " is a power ballad written by Jim Steinman . According to Steinman , the song was inspired by Wuthering Heights , and was an attempt to write " the most passionate , romantic song " he could ever create . The Sunday Times posits that " Steinman protects his songs as if they were his children " . Meat Loaf had wanted to record " It 's All Coming Back ... " for years , but Steinman saw it as a " woman 's song . " Steinman won a court movement preventing Meat Loaf from recording it . Girl group Pandora 's Box went on to record it and it was subsequently made famous through a cover by Celine Dion , which upset Meat Loaf because he was going to use it for a planned album with the working title Bat Out of Hell III . Alternately , Meat Loaf has said the song was intended for Bat Out of Hell II and given to the singer in 1986 , but that they both decided to use " I 'd Do Anything for Love ( But I Won 't Do That ) " for Bat II , and save this song for Bat III . 
 The song has had three major releases . The first version appeared on the concept album Original Sin , recorded by Pandora 's Box . It was then recorded by Celine Dion for her album Falling into You , and her version was a commercial hit , reaching No. 2 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart . Meat Loaf recorded it as a duet with Norwegian singer Marion Raven for Bat III and released it as a single in 2006 . 
 A music video was produced for each of the three versions ; death is a recurring theme in all of these videos , fitting in with the suggestion in Virgin 's press release for Original Sin that " in Steinman 's songs , the dead come to life and the living are doomed to die . " This is particularly evident when the dead characters seem to be resurrected in the memories of the main vocalist . Although in the case of Celine Dion 's video , the theme is less about the living being doomed and more about a lost love . 
 = = Inspiration = = 
 Influenced by Emily Brontë 's novel Wuthering Heights , Steinman compared the song to ' Heathcliff digging up Cathy 's corpse and dancing with it in the cold moonlight ' . In the Jim Steinman Opens Pandora 's Box promotional video , he posits that the novel : 
 is always made much too polite ; it always has been in movies . This isn 't the Wuthering Heights of Kate Bush -- that little fanciful Wuthering Heights . The scene they always cut out is the scene when Heathcliff digs up Catherine 's body and dances in the moonlight and on the beach with it . I think you can 't get much more operatic or passionate than that . I was trying to write a song about dead things coming to life . I was trying to write a song about being enslaved and obsessed by love , not just enchanted and happy with it . It was about the dark side of love ; about the ability to be resurrected by it ... I just tried to put everything I could into it , and I 'm real proud of it . 
 In another interview , Steinman expands on his comments about the song being about the ' dark side of love ' . 
 It 's about obsession , and that can be scary because you 're not in control and you don 't know where it 's going to stop . It says that , at any point in somebody 's life , when they loved somebody strongly enough and that person returns , a certain touch , a certain physical gesture can turn them from being defiant and disgusted with this person to being subservient again . And it 's not just a pleasurable feeling that comes back , it 's the complete terror and loss of control that comes back . And I think that 's ultimately a great weapon . 
 The website Allmusic called the song ' a tormented ballad about romantic loss and regret built on a spooky yet heart @-@ wrenching piano melody ' . The torment is present in the song 's opening ( ' There were nights when the wind was so cold ' ) , from which the singer recovers ( ' I finished crying in the instant that you left ... And I banished every memory you and I had ever made ' ) . However , the defiance in the verses are replaced by the return of the ' subservient ' feelings in the chorus ( ' when you touch me like this , and you hold me like that ... ' ) ; this juxtaposition continues throughout the song . 
 'There were those empty threats and hollow lies 
 <unk> whenever you tried to hurt me 
 'I just hurt you even worse and so much <unk> 
 <unk> is implied in the lines ' There were nights of endless pleasure ' and ' The flesh and the fantasies : all coming back to me ' . The song ends with a passionate , quiet reprise of the chorus . Critics have also identified Wagner , of whom Steinman is an admirer , as an inspiration . Specifying this song , the Sunday Times said " the theme of Wagner 's opera Tristan and Isolde , with its extreme passions and obsessive love , informs all his best work . " 
 A 2007 article in the Toronto Star claims that the song was written as Steinman 's " tryout " as lyricist for Andrew Lloyd Webber 's Sunset Boulevard . 
 = = Pandora 's Box = = 
 In 1989 , Steinman produced a concept album , Original Sin , with an all @-@ female group called Pandora 's Box . The album featured many tracks that would later be recorded by other artists , particularly Meat Loaf . Elaine Caswell was the lead vocalist for " It 's All Coming Back To Me Now " , who apparently collapsed five times during its recording . Caswell has since performed the song as part of The Dream Engine at Joe 's Pub in New York City . 
 For the track , Roy Bittan performed on the grand piano , with Steinman and Jeff Bova on keyboards . Guitars were by Eddie Martinez , with Steve <unk> on bass guitar . Todd Rundgren arranged the background vocals , which were performed by Ellen Foley , Gina Taylor and <unk> Wilde . The song was released as a single in the United Kingdom during October 1989 , but only reached No. 51 in the singles charts . In its review of the album , Kerrang ! magazine called the song ' excruciatingly operatic ' . 
 Ken Russell directed the video , which was filmed at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire . Steinman wrote the script , based on Russell 's " Nessun Dorma " segment in the compilation opera movie Aria . Scholar Joseph Lanza describes the video : 
 a woman 's near @-@ death experience [ from a motorcycle crash ] is set amid operatic excesses and black leather . In a simulated city engulfed by an apocalyptic blaze , British vocalist Elaine Caswell sings and participates in a ritual to celebrate the song 's " nights of sacred pleasure " ... [ The <unk> ] is stocked with gravestones , motorcycles , python and dancers ( allegedly from the London production of Cats ) , strapped in chaps , studded bras , and spiked codpieces . 
 The girl , near death , is being ministered to by paramedics , fantasizing and being ' sexually aroused by a large python and writhing on a bed that lit up in time with the music , while surrounded by a group of bemused , semi @-@ naked dancers ' . When Steinman 's manager saw it , he responded ' It 's a porno movie ! ' The two @-@ day shoot ran over schedule and budget , costing £ 35 @,@ 000 an hour . Russell and Steinman even designed a sequence where a motorcyclist would cycle up the steps of a local church @-@ tower , jump out of the turrets at the top , and then explode ; alas , the wardens of the church refused permission . 
 The 7 " , 12 " and CD singles featured Steven Margoshes 's piano solo " Pray Lewd " ( containing elements of " It 's All Coming Back to Me Now " ) , Steinman 's monologue " I 've Been Dreaming Up a Storm Lately " , and " Requiem Metal " , a sample from Verdi 's Requiem Mass , all from the album Original Sin . 
 = = Celine Dion = = 
 The song is the first on Dion 's album Falling into You . Jim Steinman produced the track , with Steven Rinkoff and Roy Bittan as co @-@ producers . Bat Out of Hell and Meat Loaf collaborators Todd Rundgren , Eric Troyer , Rory Dodd , Glen <unk> and Kasim Sulton provided backing vocals . An edited version of the song was then released on Celine 's album All the Way ... A Decade of Song . On Celine 's Falling Into You album the song 's original length is seven minutes and thirty @-@ seven seconds while on her All The Way album it is only five minutes and thirty @-@ one seconds . 
 In 2008 , " It 's All Coming Back to Me Now " was included on Celine 's greatest hits compilation My Love : Essential Collection . Live performances can be found in the A New Day ... Live in Las Vegas , Taking Chances World Tour : The Concert , and Céline ... une <unk> fois / Live 2013 albums . Dion also performed this song during her 2016 Summer <unk> song was included in My Love : Essential Collection , which on some editions restores the song back to its original length .

 The cover has received acclaim from international critics . The Calgary Sun stated : " [ The song ] is undoubtedly the highlight of her English @-@ language recording career . Dion 's over @-@ the @-@ top vocals soar and swoop around Steinman 's epic , ostentatious arrangement . Not surprisingly , everything else that follows ... pales in comparison . " Toronto 's Eye Weekly said Steinman 's " fatal absence from the last Meat Loaf record is finally justified here , " and The Miami Herald said " Dion knocks a couple out of the ballpark ... [ the song ] features seven minutes of Wagnerian bombast , thunderclap piano chords and emoting that would wither an opera diva . Sure , it 's over @-@ the @-@ top but it 's passionate and musical . " Allmusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine marked this song as a standout along with " Falling Into You " and praised it : " Dion shines on mock epics like Jim Steinman 's " It 's All Coming Back to Me Now . " The New York Times ' Stephen Holden wrote : " The melodrama peaks with two overblown Jim Steinman productions : " It 's All Coming Back to Me Now " , a romantic flashback replete with <unk> ... " 
 Some other reviews were less enthusiastic . After labelling Dion " a Madonna @-@ meets @-@ Meat Loaf vocal freak " , The Vancouver Sun called the song " intensely self @-@ indulgent , <unk> self @-@ important and mediocre beyond belief , the song just never ends . " The Ottawa Sun called it ' turgid ' , while The Toronto Sun , coincidentally , said that it " sounds like a Meat Loaf reject . " 
 According to the Sunday Times , Andrew Lloyd Webber told Steinman he thought this song " the greatest love song ever written , " and on hearing the Dion version reportedly said : " This will be the record of the millennium . " 
 = = = Music video = = = 
 Nigel Dick directed the music video for Dion 's version , with Simon Archer as cinematographer and Jaromir <unk> as art director . It was shot between June 29 and July 3 , 1996 in the summer palace of the Austrian Emperor , Ploskovice and <unk> Studios , Prague , Czech Republic ; it was later released in July 1996 . Castle Ploskovice in Ploskovice supplied the exterior of the gothic mansion . There are two versions of this music video ; the full version ( about 7 : 44 in length ) and the single version ( about 6 : 00 in length ) . Both of them are included on Dion 's 2001 DVD video collection All the Way ... A Decade of Song & Video . 
 The video opens with a man dying in an explosive motorcycle crash , after lightning strikes a tree down in his path . Dion 's character is haunted by her lover 's image , which she sees through a mirror , and images of them together through picture frames . There are stylistic similarities to Russell Mulcahy 's video for Steinman 's " Total Eclipse of the Heart " , to the extent that Slant Magazine calls Dick 's video an update .

 Several versions of the CD single were released in 1996 . They featured the songs " The Power of the Dream " , " Le fils de Superman " , " Fly " , " To Love You More " , and a live version of " Where Does My Heart Beat Now " ; a cassette and 7 " vinyl version were also released . Another CD contained several dance remixes , although these attracted negative reviews . While praising its original form , Allmusic said that ' as a dance song , it misses the mark ... the final ' Moran ' mix is a little better [ than the other dance mixes ] because the vocals don 't pop up until three and a half minutes into the song ' .

 In interviews , Meat Loaf has said that , in his mind , the song was always meant to be a duet . It was recorded as a duet by Meat Loaf and Marion Raven for the album Bat Out of Hell III : The Monster Is Loose , produced by Desmond Child . Raven had been working on her solo album with Child , and was chosen because the timbre of her voice starkly contrasts to Meat Loaf 's . In promotional interviews , Meat Loaf said that " I believe that the version that Marion Raven and myself did on this album is the definitive version . " 
 Meat Loaf cried when he first heard the song , which " is the only time that 's happened . " He has also said that the song could refer to Steinman and himself , with an array of emotions coming back every time they work together . Referring to lines like ' when I kiss you like that ' , he said that although " I love Jim Steinman " , he wouldn 't French kiss him . 
 To me it wasn 't a song about romance , it was about me and Jim Steinman . We 'd had a load of problems with managers in the early ' 80s and all of a sudden after five years we started to communicate . After I 'd been to his house , he sent me the song , and it was " It 's All Coming Back To Me Now " . Not the line ' When you kiss me like that ' , but the emotional connection . It doesn 't have to be literal . 
 P. R. Brown directed this video , which premiered on VH1 Classic on August 8 , 2006 . There are similarities between the video for Meat Loaf 's version of the song , and that the video for that of Celine Dion , with Meat Loaf being haunted by the memory of his lover . It is structured differently , however , with the story being told through flashback . Shots when Raven 's character is alive have a distinct yellow tint , with a darker , blue tint for those after her death . Whereas the motorcyclist dies before the first verse in the Dion version , Raven 's crash and resulting death is not shown until the final chorus . Meat Loaf becomes angry with Raven because the ghost of Raven 's former lover appears at a masquerade ball they are attending ( some reviewers have compared this to the Stanley Kubrick film Eyes Wide Shut ) . 
 This version of the song replaces the word ' nights ' with ' lights ' , in the line ' There were nights of endless pleasure ' . The ending of the single version is different , concluding with an additional ' We forgive and forget and it 's all coming back to me now ' . The album version , following those recorded by Pandora 's Box and Celine Dion , ends with the female voice whispering ' And if we ... ' , followed by four piano notes . 
 The track was available to download from iTunes in the United Kingdom in August 2006 , two months before its UK release on October 16 . The CD single includes the song " Black Betty " , with the limited edition 7 " featuring " Whore " , a rock duet with Patti Russo ; it was also released as a DVD single . The album version was made available on Meat Loaf and Marion Raven 's respective MySpace sites in August , with the single version being played during some of their promotional interviews , such as that on BBC Radio 2 . The cover art is by Julie Bell , who is also the artist for the album Bat out Of Hell III . 
 The single entered the UK charts at No. 6 on October 22 , 2006 , giving Meat Loaf his highest position in the UK charts since " I 'd Lie for You ( And That 's the Truth ) " reached No. 2 in 1995 . Critical reaction was generally positive , with The Guardian saying that the song is " ostensibly a reflection on love , but imbued with the delicacy of aircraft carriers colliding at sea . " 
 Marion Raven joined Meat Loaf for his 2007 tour of Europe . She was the supporting act , promoting her album Set Me Free . Meat Loaf introduced her again on stage at the latter stages of the concerts to duet on " It 's All Coming Back to Me Now " . A performance was recorded and released on DVD as 3 Bats Live .

 = The Sword of Shannara = 
 The Sword of Shannara is a 1977 epic fantasy novel by Terry Brooks . It is the first book of the Original Shannara Trilogy , followed by The Elfstones of Shannara and The <unk> of Shannara . Brooks was heavily influenced by J.R.R. Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings and began writing The Sword of Shannara in 1967 . It took him seven years to complete , as he was writing the novel while attending law school . Ballantine Books used it to launch the company 's new subsidiary Del Rey Books . Its success boosted the commercial expansion of the fantasy genre . 
 The novel interweaves two major plots into a fictional world called the Four Lands . One follows the protagonist Shea Ohmsford on his quest to obtain the Sword of Shannara and confront the Warlock Lord ( the antagonist ) with it . The other plot shadows Prince Balinor Buckhannah 's attempt to oust his insane brother Palance from the throne of Callahorn while the country and its capital ( Tyrsis ) come under attack from overwhelming armies of the Warlock Lord . Throughout the novel , underlying themes appear of mundane heroism and nuclear holocaust . 
 Critics have derided the novel for being derivative of J.R.R. Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings . Some have accused Brooks of lifting the entire plot and many of his characters directly from Lord of the Rings ; others have regarded the book more favorably and say that new writers often start by copying the style of established writers .

 = = = History = = = 
 The Sword of Shannara 's events take place 2000 years after a Great War : nuclear holocaust has wiped out most of the planet . During this time , Mankind mutates into several distinct races : Men , Dwarves , Gnomes , and Trolls , all named after creatures from " age @-@ old " myths . Also , the Elves begin to emerge after having been in seclusion and hiding for centuries . The warring that caused the holocaust is referred to as the " Great Wars " throughout the novel . These wars rearranged the planet 's geographical attributes and wiped out most human life on Earth . Most advanced technology has been lost , but magic has been rediscovered . 
 A thousand years before The Sword of Shannara , an Elf named <unk> gathers all of the people who still had some knowledge of the old world to Paranor to try to bring peace and order to all of the races . They name themselves the First Druid Council . Brona , a rogue Druid , and his followers leave , taking the <unk> with them ; this magical tome controls their minds . 250 years later , Brona begins the First War of the Races when he convinces all Men to attack the other races . He almost succeeds in seizing rule of the Four Lands , but the tide turns , and the war ends with his defeat and disappearance . The Druids divide the Four Lands among the races and become reclusive , withdrawing to Paranor because of their shame at the betrayal by one of their own members . 
 Two and a half centuries after the First War of the Races , Brona returns as the Warlock Lord , now with Skull Bearers as his servants . <unk> in the prequel novel First King of Shannara , the Second War of the Races begins with the destruction of the Druid Order . A lone Druid , Bremen , forges a magical talisman to destroy the Warlock Lord ; it is given to the Elven King , Jerle Shannara . As it takes the form of a blade , the talisman is named the Sword of Shannara . It succeeds in banishing the Warlock Lord . He is not killed , but his army is defeated by the combined armies of the Elves and Dwarves . Peace comes at a high price , interracial tension is renewed and the Druids have vanished .

 Five centuries later , the Ohmsford family of Shady Vale in the Southland takes in the half @-@ Elven child Shea . He takes the name Ohmsford and is raised as a brother to the family 's son Flick . Becoming inseparable , the brothers run the family inn . 
 Some time later , the last Druid Allanon arrives in Shady Vale . Allanon warns the Ohmsford brothers that the Warlock Lord has returned to the Skull Kingdom in the Northland and is coming for Shea . As the last descendant of Jerle Shannara , Shea is the only one capable of wielding the Sword of Shannara against the Warlock Lord . 
 Allanon departs , leaving Shea three Blue Elfstones for protection . He tells Shea to flee at the sign of the Skull . A few weeks later , a creature bearing a symbol of a skull shows up : a Skull Bearer , one of the Warlock Lord 's " winged black destroyers " , has arrived to search for Shea . The brothers are forced to flee with the Skull Bearer on their heels . They take refuge in the nearby city of Leah where they find Shea 's friend Menion , the son of the city 's lord . Menion decides to accompany the two , and he travels with them to Culhaven , to meet with Allanon . While at Culhaven , they are joined by a prince of Callahorn , Balinor Buckhannah , two elven brothers , Durin and Dayel Elessedil , and the dwarf Hendel . 
 The party sets out for Paranor . But along the way , Shea falls over a waterfall and becomes separated from the group . Allanon spurs the group to continue to Paranor . Once there , the party gets into a battle with minions of the Warlock Lord and find that the Sword of Shannara has already been removed . The party then learns of the Warlock Lord 's invasion of the Southland , and decide to split up to do what they can to stop it .

 Disguised by Allanon , Flick infiltrates the enemy camp and rescues the captive Elven King , Eventine Elessedil ; at the same time , in Kern , Menion saves a woman named Shirl <unk> and falls in love with her . They organize an evacuation of Kern before the Northland army reaches the city . 
 Balinor returns to Tyrsis to activate the Border Legion only to find that it has been disbanded . Balinor is then imprisoned by his insane brother Palance Buckhannah , who has taken control of Callahorn 's rule . His advisor , Stenmin , has driven Palance insane with drugs , making him his pawn . With help from Menion , Balinor escapes and confronts both Palance and Stenmin . Practically cornered , Stenmin stabs Palance as a distraction and flees . 
 Now commanded by Balinor , Callahorn 's reformed Border Legion marches out of Tyrsis and engages the Northland army at the <unk> River , killing many <unk> before being forced to pull back ; the Border Legion retreats to Tyrsis and make preparations for defense . During the siege of Tyrsis , Hendel and Menion come upon Stenmin and some of his supporters . Hendel is killed , but Menion kills Stenmin . After three days , the Border Legion is beaten back from the Outer Wall of Tyrsis as a result of treachery — the wall falls when the traitors destroy the locks on the main gate , jamming it open . At the defenders ' last stand on the Bridge of <unk> , the <unk> abruptly break and run .

 Infiltrating the Warlock Lord 's fortress in the Skull Mountain , Shea reaches the sword and unsheathes it . He learns about its true power , the ability to confront those with the truth about their lives . The Warlock Lord materializes and tries to destroy Shea , but the youth stands his ground and confronts his enemy with the sword . Although immune to physical weapons , the Warlock Lord vanishes after being forced to confront the truth about himself : he had deluded himself into believing that he is immortal , but this is impossible . The Sword forces him to confront this paradox , and it kills him . 
 Keltset sacrifices himself to save his companions during the Skull Kingdom 's destruction . In the south , the Northland army retreats after the Warlock Lord 's downfall . Allanon saves Shea 's life and reveals himself as Bremen 's centuries @-@ old son , before disappearing to sleep . Peace returns to the Four Lands .

 Brooks began writing The Sword of Shannara in 1967 when he was twenty @-@ three years old . He started writing the novel to challenge himself and as a way of staying " sane " while he attended law school at Washington and Lee University . Brooks had been a writer since high school , but he had never found ' his ' genre : " I tried my hand at science fiction , westerns , war stories , you name it . All those efforts ... weren 't very good . " When he was starting college , he was given a copy of Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings to read for the first time . From then on , Brooks knew that he had found a genre he could write in . Writing Sword took seven years , as Brooks worked on it only sporadically while also completing his law school courses and rewrote it many times . 
 Brooks initially submitted his manuscript to DAW Books , whose editor Donald A. Wollheim rejected it and recommended submission to Judy @-@ Lynn del Rey at Ballantine Books instead . Ballantine Books accepted The Sword of Shannara in November 1974 . Brooks ' editor was Lester del Rey , who used the book to launch Ballantine 's new Del Rey Books imprint / subsidiary . Del Rey chose it because he felt that it was " the first long epic fantasy adventure which had any chance of meeting the demands of Tolkien readers for similar pleasures . " 
 In 1977 , The Sword of Shannara was simultaneously released as a trade paperback by Ballantine Books and hardback by Random House . The Brothers Hildebrandt , who had previously done illustration work for the work of Tolkien , was asked to make the cover . Greg Hildebrandt remembers the Del <unk> as being " obsessed with the project . It was their baby . " The novel was a commercial success , becoming the first fantasy fiction novel to appear on The New York Times trade paperback bestseller list . 
 The original inspiration for The Sword of Shannara was Brooks ' desire to put " Tolkien 's magic and fairy creatures [ into ] the worlds of Walter Scott and [ Alexander ] Dumas " . Later , other inspirations jumped onto Brooks ' bandwagon . Brooks was inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien The Lord of the Rings and adventure fiction such as Alexandre Dumas ' The Three Musketeers , Robert Louis Stevenson 's Treasure Island , Arthur Conan Doyle 's The White Company and Walter Scott 's Ivanhoe . 
 Brooks decided not to use historical settings like these works . He instead followed Tolkien 's use of a fantasy setting instead : 
 I would set my adventure story in an imaginary world , a vast , sprawling , mythical world like that of Tolkien , filled with magic that had replaced science and races that had evolved from Man . But I was not Tolkien and did not share his background in academia or his interest in cultural study . So I would eliminate the poetry and songs , the digressions on the ways and habits of types of characters , and the appendices of language and backstory that characterized and informed Tolkien 's work . I would write the sort of straightforward adventure story that barreled ahead , picking up speed as it went , compelling a turning of pages until there were no more pages to be turned . 
 He admits that he was very influenced by The Lord of the Rings when writing it , being his first novel , but that he has evolved his own style since : 
 Tolkien approached it as an academic , and he was writing it as an academic effort , not as popular fiction . I ’ m a popular fiction writer , that 's the way I approached it . And I think that you 're right , too , about the fact that I was heavily under the influence of Tolkien when I wrote Sword of Shannara and it shows in that particular book . But I 've really gotten a long way away from Tolkien these days and not very many people come up to me any more and say , “ Well , gee , you 're writing an awful lot like Tolkien . ” They don ’ t say that any more . 
 Brooks also made decisions about his novel 's characterization and use of magic , saying that the magic " couldn 't be dependable or simply good or bad " . Also , he wanted to blur the distinctions between good and evil , " because life simply [ doesn 't ] work that way . " He wanted to ensure that readers would identify with his protagonist , Shea , which he accomplished by casting Shea as " a person simply trying to muddle through " . 
 = = Major themes = = 
 " Ordinary men placed in extraordinary circumstances " is a prevalent theme in The Sword of Shannara . Brooks credits Tolkien with introducing this theme of mundane heroism into fantasy literature and influencing his own fiction . " [ M ] y protagonists are cut from the same bolt of cloth as Bilbo and Frodo Baggins . It was Tolkien 's genius to reinvent the traditional epic fantasy by making the central character neither God nor hero , but a simple man in search of a way to do the right thing . ... I was impressed enough by how it had changed the face of epic fantasy that I never gave a second thought to not using it as the cornerstone of my own writing . " 
 The Sword of Shannara is set in a post @-@ apocalyptic Earth , where chemical and nuclear holocaust devastated the land in the distant past . Due to the numerous references in Sword to this catastrophe , Brooks was asked a question about whether he thought that his ' prediction ' might come true . He answered : 
 I don 't see myself as a negative person , so I don 't think I 've ever thought we would destroy ourselves . But it does worry me that not only are we capable of [ nuclear war ] , but [ we also ] flirt with the idea periodically . One mistake , after all . . . Anyway , I used the background in [ The ] Sword of Shannara more in a cautionary vein than as a prophecy . Also , it was necessary to destroy civilization in order to take a look at what it would mean to have to build it back up again using magic . A civilization once destroyed by misuse of power is a bit wary the second time out about what new power can do . 
 Environment plays a role in all of the Shannara novels : " Environment is a character in my story and almost always plays a major role in affecting the story 's outcome . I have always believed that fantasy , in particular , because it takes place in an imaginary world with at least some imaginary characters , needs to make the reader feel at home in the setting . That means bringing the setting alive for the reader , which is what creating environment as a character is really all about . " However , Brooks believes that Sword was more about behavioral issues and personal sacrifice .

 The Sword of Shannara received mixed reviews following its publication , most of which remarked on its similarity to J. R. R. Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings . Choice stated that the novel was an " exceptionally well @-@ written , very readable ... entrance into the genre ... [ that ] will be accepted by most teenagers . " Marshall Tymn also thought that it contained quality prose . Tymn believed that Sword followed Lord of the Rings too closely , but he also cited some of the differences , such as the use of a post @-@ holocaust setting with the races that sprang from that , and the " entertaining <unk> , Panamon Creel , ... and ... an unexpected ending springing from the nature of the sword . " <unk> Dunn MacRae assessed all of Brooks ' works in her 1998 book Presenting Young Adult Fantasy Fiction . On The Sword of Shannara , she thought this : 
 In this <unk> world of our future , Brooks parallels the mystic arts ... with science , two powers that are not good or evil but become either by the way we use them . Evil is a corruption of truth , erupting from the selfish use of power for one 's own ends . Good arises from the insistence on truth , allowing us to realize our indelible bonds with others of all races , and our connection with nature and earth . Anything unnatural is evil , such as the Warlock Lord 's immortality , which recalls similar abuse of nature by Le Guin 's Cob and by Barbara Hambly 's wizard <unk> . 
 One of Brooks ' strengths is his plot 's momentum , maintained through cliffhangers , unexpected twists of fortune , and the dance of many characters ' constant movements . This brisk pace alters when characters pause to ruminate , which draws out suspense and reveals motivation . However , first novelist Brooks as puppet master is not always in control of the strings . With no single point of view centered in one character , his focus is diffused , and the anxieties and realizations of each character beg [ an ] to sound the same , blurring their identities with repetition .

 The Sword of Shannara has drawn extensive criticism from critics who believe that Brooks derived too much of his novel from Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings . In 1978 , influential fantasy editor Lin Carter denounced The Sword of Shannara as " the single most cold @-@ blooded , complete rip @-@ off of another book that I have ever read " . Elaborating on his disapproval of the book , Carter wrote that " Terry Brooks wasn 't trying to imitate Tolkien 's prose , just steal his story line and complete cast of characters , and [ Brooks ] did it with such clumsiness and so heavy @-@ handedly , that he virtually rubbed your nose in it . " Roger C. <unk> was kinder in his assessment , though he still thought that The Sword of Shannara was a disappointment because of its similarities to The Lord of the Rings . Brian Attebery accused The Sword of Shannara of being " undigested Tolkien " which was " especially blatant in its point @-@ for @-@ point correspondence " with The Lord of the Rings . In an educational article on writing , author Orson Scott Card cited The Sword of Shannara as a cautionary example of overly derivative writing , finding the work " artistically displeasing " for this reason . 
 Assessing The Sword of Shannara three decades after its publication , Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey agreed with Attebery , as Shippey found that the novel was distinctive for " the dogged way in which it follow [ ed ] Tolkien point for point " . Within Brooks ' novel , Shippey located " analogues " for Tolkien characters such as Sauron ( Brona ) , Gandalf ( Allanon ) , the Hobbits ( Shea and Flick ) , Aragorn ( Menion ) , Boromir ( Balinor ) , Gimli ( Hendel ) , Legolas ( Durin and Dayel ) , Gollum ( Orl Fane ) , the Barrow @-@ wight ( Mist Wraith ) , and the Nazgûl ( Skull Bearers ) , among others . He also found plot similarities to events in The Lord of the Rings such as the Fellowship of the Ring 's formation and adventures , the journeys to Rivendell ( Culhaven ) and Lothlórien ( <unk> ) , Gandalf 's ( Allanon ) fall in Moria ( Paranor ) and subsequent reappearance , and the Rohirrim 's arrival at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields ( Battle of <unk> ) , among others . Avoiding direct commentary on the book 's quality , Shippey attributed the book 's success to the post @-@ <unk> advent of the fantasy genre : " What The Sword of Shannara seems to show is that many readers had developed the taste ... for heroic fantasy so strongly that if they could not get the real thing they would take any substitute , no matter how diluted . " 
 Terry Brooks has said that Tolkien 's works were a major influence in his writing , though he has also said that Tolkien was not his only influence . Other influences included his editor Lester del Rey , as well as the many different books which he had read over his life . Also , mythology and ancient civilizations that he had learned about in school gave him a wealth of knowledge from which he drew . Many of these influences are reflected in Brooks ' works . 
 In a 2001 Interzone essay , author Gene Wolfe defended Brooks ' derivation of material from Tolkien : " Terry Brooks has often been disparaged for imitating Tolkien , particularly by those reviewers who find his books inferior to Tolkien 's own . I can say only that I wish there were more imitators -- we need them -- and that all imitations of so great an original must necessarily be inferior . " In a commentary for The New York Times Book Review , Frank Herbert , author of the science fiction novel Dune , also defended Brooks , saying : 
 Don 't fault Brooks for entering the world of letters through the Tolkien door . Every writer owes a similar debt to those who have come before . Some will admit it . Tolkien 's debt was equally obvious . The classical myth structure is deeply embedded in Western society . 
 That 's why you should not be surprised at finding these elements in The Sword of Shannara . Yes , you will find here the young prince in search of his grail ; the secret ( and not always benign ) powers of nature ; the magician ; the wise old man ; the witch mother ; the malignant threat from a sorcerer ; the holy talisman ; the virgin queen ; the fool ( in the ancient tarot sense of the one who asks the disturbing questions ) and all of the other Arthurian trappings . 
 What Brooks has done is to present a marvelous exposition of why the idea is not the story . Because of the popular assumption ( which assumes mythic proportions of its own ) that ideas form 99 percent of a story , writers are plagued by that foolish question , " Where do you get your ideas ? " Brooks demonstrates that it doesn 't matter where you get the idea ; what matters is that you tell a rousing story . 
 Herbert said that " Brooks revert [ ed ] to his own style ... somewhere around Chapter 20 " and remarked upon what Brooks did not take from Tolkien : 
 In the last chapters , you get the <unk> innovations — the Rock Troll [ Keltset ] , who is deep and mute and whose actions , thus , are far more important than any words could be ; the Grim Druid , who really changes character in the second half of the book , becoming far more complex and devious ( the name Allanon should give you a clue ) ; Balinor , the Prince of Callahorn , whose role breaks with myth tradition ; the Warlock Lord , who pretty much fills the traditional role of evil — but that 's what you expect of evil and it doesn 't blight a good story . 
 Herbert also praised the characters of evil in the book : " Ah , the monsters in this book . Brooks creates distillations of horror that hark back to childhood 's shadows , when the most important thing about a fearful creature was that you didn 't know its exact shape and intent . You only knew that it wanted you . The black @-@ winged skull bearer , for instance , is more than a euphemism for death . In a 2001 article for Seattle Weekly , David <unk> also commented upon Brooks ' main characters , calling them " idiosyncratic adventurers . " 
 Other contemporary newspapers took separate sides on the Sword and Lord of the Rings issue . John Batchelor , writing for The Village Voice , thought that it was the weakest of the 1977 surge in fantasy , ranking it below Stephen R. Donaldson 's The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant , the Unbeliever , Seamus Cullen 's Astra and <unk> , and The Silmarillion , edited by Christopher Tolkien , while commenting that it " unabashedly cop [ ied ] " Lord of the Rings . However , he also believed that it was serviceable , simply because there is something exciting about sending off a group to face evil alone . Taking the opposite stance , L.V. <unk> in the Sydney Morning Herald believed that the book was similar enough to Tolkien that it would draw the many fans of that book to Sword , but it was only similar on a most basic level , and a valid comparison could not be made between the two . The Pittsburgh Press took a similar stance , saying that Sword embodied the Tolkien spirit and tradition but was quite able to stand apart from Lord of the Rings .

 The Sword of Shannara sold about 125 @,@ 000 copies in its first month in print . This success provided a major boost to the fantasy genre . 
 Louise J. Winters writes that " until Shannara , no fantasy writer except J. R. R. Tolkien had made such an impression on the general public . " Critic David Pringle credits Brooks for " demonstrat [ ing ] in 1977 that the commercial success of Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings had not been a fluke , and that fantasy really did have the potential to become a mass @-@ market genre " . With Stephen R. Donaldson 's The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant , the Unbeliever , The Sword of Shannara ushered in " the era of the big commercial fantasy " and helped make epic fantasy the leading fantasy subgenre . The Sword of Shannara and its sequels helped inspire later versions of Dungeons and Dragons .
