 Upon leaving hockey in 1963 , he focused on a career in harness racing . Stewart 's father built a track on the family farm and held a horse racing meet each year to entertain the residents of Pilot Mound . He also followed and assisted his father when the elder Stewart acted as a race judge at fairs held in Manitoba . Stewart was actively involved in the sport from the time he retired as a player . He worked as a race timer and held various judging roles during the summers . He was a judge with the Ontario Racing Commission for nearly 30 years where his reputation matched that of his playing days . 
 Stewart retired to Florida but returned to Michigan to undergo treatment for cancer . He died on May 6 , 1983 , at his home in Troy following a lengthy battle with the disease . A widower , he was survived by two children , son Barclay and daughter <unk> .

 = <unk> Somerset = 
 The <unk> Somerset ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> dàshà ) is a high @-@ rise commercial building and shopping mall on Somerset Road in Orchard , Singapore . The building was first known as Public Utilities Board Building ( PUB Building ) until 1995 , and was later known as Singapore Power Building until 2008 when acquired by YTL Corporation Pacific Star . It currently houses the corporate headquarters of Singapore Power . 
 The Embassy of Sweden is located on the 5th floor of the building . 
 = = History = = 
 The PUB Building , located near Singapore 's main shopping belt of Orchard Road , was built to accommodate several departments of the Public Utilities Board which had outgrown its office space in City Hall . 
 The building was the result of an architectural design competition . In July 1971 , a contest to design PUB 's corporate headquarters was launched . Of 23 submissions , four were picked by a jury headed by then PUB chairman Lim Kim San . The proposal by the now @-@ defunct Singapore architectural firm Group 2 Architects ( 1970 – 1978 ) , formed by Ong Chin Bee and Tan <unk> Huat , won . 
 Built to a height of 100 metres ( 328 ft ) , the PUB Building was completed in 1977 ; construction cost S $ 32 million . It was renamed as the Singapore Power Building , after PUB 's electricity and gas operations were <unk> to Singapore Power on 1 October 1995 . The Singapore Power Building was renovated in 2006 , when Singapore Power chose not to redevelop its corporate headquarters . Instead , it opted to refurbish and reclad the building in silvery metal . 
 On 29 January 2007 , PUB moved out of the building to join its parent ministry , Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources , at the Environment Building on Scotts Road . When YTL Pacific Star acquired the building in February 2008 , it was renamed to its present name . The new owner undertook a S $ 50 million renovation and added more retail space to the building by converting offices , a cafeteria , empty spaces in the lobby areas as well as the carpark and the auditorium . It now has 500 @,@ 000 square feet ( 46 @,@ 000 m2 ) of offices , 60 @,@ 000 square feet ( 5 @,@ 600 m2 ) of retail space and a 5 @,@ 000 square feet ( 460 m2 ) outdoor refreshment area . The complex now houses a <unk> Finest supermarket when the retail area opened in January 2010 .

 In the 1971 design competition for the PUB Building , the other three finalists proposed high @-@ rise structures to project a corporate image . However , Group 2 Architect 's winning design , in the jury 's words , allowed " natural form and function to achieve character and dignity " for the building . The 17 @-@ storey high PUB building shows the influence of Gerhard M. <unk> 's 1962 Boston City Hall , also a competition winner , which was , in turn , influenced by Le Corbusier 's Sainte Marie de La Tourette ( 1957 – 1960 ) by . The development of the form of the PUB Building was mannerist , however , in contrast to the inherent logic evident in La Tourette , and to some degree in in the City Hall . 
 Situated between Somerset Road and Devonshire Road , Group 2 Architects designed the PUB Building as an H @-@ shaped block with a central service core and a naturally @-@ ventilated lobby . Facing north and south , the two parallel wings are of unequal height , and are linked by a wider transverse area three floors in height , and further up by the lift shaft and the access to each floor . Between the two wings is a landscaped courtyard . 
 = = = Horizontal emphasis = = = 
 The architects sought to create an approachable building that reflected the role of the PUB as a public supplier of gas and electricity , and this led them to choose strong horizontal elements for the design . In the building 's façade , this is achieved with distinctive rows of vertical fins , staggered so as to emphasise horizontal movement ; these fins also provide shade . A secondary horizontal pattern results from grouping two or more rows of these fins in blocks . 
 The Singapore Power Building 's defining architectural motif is its " inverted ziggurat " façade . The building tapers from cantilevered upper floors to recessed lower floors , and the resulting overhangs help to shade the lower levels , a logical response to the tropical climate . The tropical setting also led to the provision of a generous shaded concourse at ground level . It was the combination of design features intended to reflect the climate , together with an objective of making the floor areas congruent with the size of the administrative elements of the utility that occupied them , that resulted in the building 's distinctive structural profile . Internally , the building was organised to reflect the distribution of office spaces required by PUB 's departments at the time , with more space needed on the upper floors . The chamfered parapets at the ends soften the corners of the building . The length of the building is emphasised and the design elements are visually integrated by vertical projections housing staircases . The staggered façade provides views to the exterior , while offering voids in between that afford " breathing space " . 
 The ground floor of the building was dedicated to public access and use . It is entered via wide steps under columns that are three- or four @-@ storeys high , and these pilotis create a sense of space for the naturally ventilated public lobby areas . From the concourse , which is decorated with wall @-@ relief sculptures , steps lead to upper and lower public service areas , a cafeteria and carparks . 
 The original design of the Singapore Power Building was executed virtually without later alteration although it would later be surrounded by hotels , the Somerset MRT Station and shopping complexes . 
 = = = Structural framework = = = 
 The structural framework of the building utilises a simple system of reinforced concrete beams and slabs , and was originally clad in square mosaic and rectangular ceramic tiles on its walls and columns . The building 's foundation comprises large diameter bored piles installed in decomposed sandstone . Beams span an average 7 @.@ 6 metres except at the main entrance where post @-@ tensioned concrete beams span 15 metres . The auditorium is roofed over by 24 @-@ metre long steel trusses with a composite reinforced concrete covering . 
 = Love Won 't Wait = 
 " Love Won 't Wait " is a song by English singer @-@ songwriter Gary Barlow from his debut album Open Road . It was released as the second single from the album on 25 April 1997 by BMG and RCA Records . The song was written by Madonna and Shep Pettibone , and was an unreleased demo from her Bedtime Stories ( 1994 ) studio sessions . Barlow came by the demo in 1997 , while looking to record more songs for Open Road . He changed the lyrics to represent a male point of view rather than Madonna 's , and recorded the track with Stephen Lipson as producer . 
 Barlow was apprehensive about releasing the track , but due to contractual obligations he had to release it . The song became Barlow 's second consecutive number one release on the UK Singles Chart , following " Forever Love " , and was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) . Elsewhere it received moderate success . A music video for the song was directed by Rocky Schenck and showed Barlow singing " Love Won 't Wait " across different locations . He also performed the song at the 1997 pre @-@ Grammy Award party , where his performance was negatively received .

 Following the release of her fifth studio album , Erotica ( 1992 ) , Madonna and her producer Shep Pettibone continued writing more songs in the same vein as present in the album . However , she later abandoned the project and collaborated with record producers Dallas Austin and Nellee Hooper to create Bedtime Stories , her sixth studio album , released in 1994 . Many of the songs from the writing sessions with Pettibone were not included and remained as demos . In the meantime , Gary Barlow wanted to release his debut album , Open Road , to coincide with his first single , " Forever Love " . However , he wanted to continue recording songs for the album . He came across one of Madonna 's demos called " Love Won 't Wait " and decided to record it , after shortening the lyrics . 
 Barlow 's manager , Simon Fuller , chose Stephen Lipson to produce the song , seeing his success with 1980s artists like Grace Jones and Frankie Goes to Hollywood . Although the song did not sound like what Barlow would usually record , he nevertheless explained in an interview : " It took me a while to get my interpretation right because Madonna had written from a female point of view . It 's not the kind of song I would write myself . But as soon as I heard it , I thought ' This is a hit ' . " A dance @-@ pop song , " Love Won 't Wait " is set in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute . Barlow 's voice spans between the nodes of C ♯ m and A3 and has a basic chord progression of C – A – B – C ♯ m in the pre @-@ chorus and E – B – D – A – C – E – A – C ♯ m in the chorus .

 Barlow had arrived in the United States in February 1997 for recording the track , where Clive Davis , who was managing his career in the United States , played him a " poppier " version of the song , remixed by Junior Vasquez . He also requested Barlow to perform " Love Won 't Wait " at the 1997 pre @-@ Grammy Award party . However , the singer did not have any time to rehearse or memorize the lyrics , resulting in the performance receiving negative reviews from critics and audience alike . With The Times Barlow recounted the evening saying , " I don 't remember the words . I came in at all the wrong times . I can see people drifting off to the toilet in droves . Talk about dying on your arse ! " The combination of the negative review towards his performance and contractual obligations led to Barlow release " Love Won 't Wait " as his second single on 24 April 1997 in the United Kingdom . The CD single consisted of the single version along with the Vasquez remix and two other tracks from Open Road , " Meaning Of A Love Song " and " Always " . Another song , " Cuddly Toy " , was released on the B @-@ side of another CD single for the song , released in May 1997 . " Love Won 't Wait " was also remixed by DJs Cuca and Monster Makers , and was released in a CD single in June 1997 . 
 An accompanying music video was directed by Rocky Schenck and was released on 28 April 1997 . It features Barlow performing the song in France , walking down a highway littered with stage props and crew members actively changing the scenes as he walks forward . As he performs the chorus , he jumps off the set and walks towards his stage chair , where he sits and observes his surroundings . The video ends with Barlow running away from a woman down a country road , as the video fades from view .

 While the album received mostly negative reviews , songs like " Love Won 't Wait " were considered a stand @-@ out by The Times . The Daily Mirror noted it as a " classic track you 've known all your life " , while a reviewer from The Sunday Mirror rated it seven out of ten , and cautioned that " Take That fans will lap up another smooth one from Gary , but I can 't help thinking he 's trying to turn into Elton John far too soon . " In the United Kingdom , " Love Won 't Wait " became Barlow 's second solo number one single on the UK Singles Chart , following " Forever Love " . It was number one for one week , and was present for a total of nine weeks within the top 100 of the chart . The British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) certified it silver , for shipment of 200 @,@ 000 copies of the single .

 = Hurricane Karl ( 2004 ) = 
 Hurricane Karl was a powerful Cape Verde @-@ type hurricane during the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season . It was the eleventh named storm , eighth hurricane and sixth major hurricane of the 2004 season . Karl formed on September 16 , originating from a strong tropical wave that emerged off of Africa . It rapidly intensified , becoming a major hurricane on two occasions . Karl peaked as a strong Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane scale on September 21 with 145 mph ( 230 km / h ) winds . It weakened as it moved northward , becoming extratropical on September 24 in the north Atlantic and becoming absorbed by another system on September 28 . The extratropical storm affected the Faroe Islands , but no damage was reported there and no lives were lost . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Karl originated in a strong tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on September 13 . The wave gradually became better organized , and it was declared Tropical Depression Twelve about 670 miles ( 1 @,@ 080 km ) west @-@ southwest of the Cape Verde islands on the morning of September 16 , as it headed westward in the open tropical Atlantic following the periphery of the subtropical ridge . That afternoon , the depression continued to rapidly organize and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Karl . Due to healthy outflow around an upper @-@ level anticyclone over Karl and a favorable environment with the warmest sea surface temperatures of the year , rapid deepening began on the evening of September 17 , with the storm developing a small eye and being upgraded to Hurricane Karl . With water around 28 ° C ( 83 ° F ) and low wind shear , the cyclone continued to rapidly intensify on the morning of September 18 . The intensity leveled off somewhat that afternoon as a strong Category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) . 
 Late in the evening of September 18 , Karl attained Category 3 status , becoming the sixth major hurricane of 2004 . On September 19 , Karl continued to strengthen , maintaining a well @-@ defined eye , and strengthening late that day into a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 135 mph ( 215 km / h ) and a minimum pressure of 948 mbar . Early on September 20 , the storm weakened slightly as a result of an eyewall replacement cycle , weakening back to a strong Category 3 hurricane . At this time Karl began to turn sharply northward into a weakness in the subtropical ridge . 
 After intensification stopped on September 20 due to the eyewall cycle and slightly increased wind shear , Karl quickly restrengthened that evening over very warm water , and early on September 21 reached its peak intensity as a powerful Category 4 hurricane with 145 mph ( 230 km / h ) winds and a minimum central pressure of 938 mbar . That morning , as Karl was moving northward , another eyewall replacement cycle began to take place and vertical shear increased , again weakening the storm temporarily . The trend continued into the evening , and the storm weakened to a Category 2 hurricane by early on September 22 . The weakening trend slowed down and eventually leveled off that afternoon with Karl remaining a Category 2 hurricane as the storm turned towards the north @-@ northeast . Late that evening , Karl began to restrengthen once again as wind shear diminished . The intensification continued into the morning of September 23 , as Karl became a major hurricane a second time , reaching a final peak of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) winds . Cooler waters and increased shear soon prevailed , however , and the storm quickly weakened , dropping to a Category 1 hurricane by late that evening as the low @-@ level circulation became detached from the mid @-@ level circulation due to the strong southwesterly vertical wind shear . 
 Early on September 24 , Karl continued its north @-@ northeast track over the open north @-@ central Atlantic and continued to gradually weaken . It started to come in contact with the baroclinic zone and began to lose tropical characteristics , while still a Category 1 hurricane . Karl became extratropical shortly afterward over the northern Atlantic at about 47 ° N , with its winds dropping below hurricane strength shortly thereafter . The extratropical storm made landfall on the Faroe Islands with hurricane @-@ force wind gusts . As an extratropical low , the cyclone moved northeastward and eastward across the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea , eventually reaching Norway before it was absorbed into another extratropical low late on September 28 . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Karl made landfall on Norway as an extratropical storm with sustained winds near 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) and with wind gusts up to 89 mph ( 144 km / h ) . No damages or deaths were reported , and no ships came directly into contact with Karl ; the strongest winds reported were from the ship Rotterdam , which reported 52 mph ( 83 km / h ) sustained winds in the north Atlantic while Karl was a Category 1 storm in extratropical transition . 
 = Winnie Winkle = 
 Winnie Winkle is an American comic strip which appeared over a 76 @-@ year span ( 1920 – 96 ) . The strip 's premise was conceived by Joseph Medill Patterson , but the stories and artwork were by Martin Branner , who wrote the strip for over 40 years . Winnie Winkle was one of the first comic strips about working women . The main character Winnie was a young woman who had to support her parents and adopted brother , serving as a reflection of the changing role of women in society . It ran in more than 100 newspapers for several decades , and translations of the strip 's Sunday pages were made available in Europe , focusing on her little brother Perry Winkle and his gang . 
 Due to its originality and longevity , Winnie Winkle became a household name and an icon , inspiring even Pop Art artist Roy Lichtenstein . Winnie Winkle was reprinted in Dell Comics , and for a time her face appeared on a cigar box lid . In retrospect , Winnie Winkle is seen as one of the comic strips heralding a new , more independent role for American women after World War I. 
 = = Publication history = = 
 The Chicago Tribune Syndicate launched the comic strip on September 20 , 1920 . By 1939 , Winnie Winkle was running in more than 140 newspapers . It was titled Winnie Winkle the <unk> until 1943 . By 1970 , Winnie Winkle still ran in more than 150 newspapers . 
 Winnie Winkle ended July 28 , 1996 , after 76 years , one of the longest runs in American comic strip history . Tribune Media Services , the syndicate that distributed the comic strip , " felt that the Winnie Winkle character was not recognized as a contemporary role model for the ' 90s . " At the time , the strip was carried by only a handful of newspapers . 
 = = Characters and story = = 
 The eponymous character Winnie Winkle was a young , unmarried woman who had to support her parents , making it the first popular comic strip about working women . It was a reflection of the new role of women in society , as could also be seen in comics such as Tillie the Toiler from 1921 . Writing for the Associated Press in 1993 , Hugh A. Mulligan noted , " After women got the vote and joined the work force , family @-@ centered comics were joined by working @-@ girl strips like Winnie Winkle , Tillie the Toiler , Dixie Dugan , Somebody 's <unk> and Brenda Starr , which was drawn by a woman , Dale Messick . Almost from the beginning , politics and a social conscience hovered over the drawing board . " 
 During its first years , the daily Winnie Winkle evolved from simple gags to more complex humorous situations . A new character was introduced in the form of Perry , a little boy from the backstreets , whom the <unk> adopted in 1922 . The focus of the Sunday pages then shifted to the adventures of Perry at home , school and on the streets . Although compelled to wear a duffle coat and fancy clothes , he continued to frequent his old neighborhood . The local gang , the Rinkydinks , in contrast , still wore torn and patchy clothing , and were regarded by Winnie as " loafers . " One member of the Rinkydinks was the dunce , Denny <unk> , who popularized the catch phrase , " <unk> is a good boy , Denny . " 
 Other major plot elements were the 1937 marriage of Winnie to engineer Will Wright and the disappearance of Will during World War II , leaving a pregnant Winnie behind . This realistic and unfortunate situation was too risqué for some newspapers : The Baltimore Sun dropped the strip early in 1941 because of the pregnancy of Winnie . The comic strip changed significantly over the years ; with Winnie working in the fashion industry after the war , seemingly as a widow until her husband returned after a few decades . She took on various other jobs and endeavors over the years , including a stint in the Peace Corps . 
 = = Artists = = 
 Branner employed a number of assistants , including Royal King Cole ( during the 1930s ) , Rolf <unk> , Mike <unk> , and Max Van Bibber ( 1938 – 1962 ) . Another assistant was the young French author Robert <unk> , who on his return to Europe created the famous series Spirou et Fantasio . 
 From 1941 until 1958 , Branner 's assistant was John A. <unk> , who later created Gil Thorp . After Branner suffered a stroke in 1962 , Van Bibber continued the series until 1980 , later followed by students from the Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art , and finally by veteran artist Frank Bolle . Bolle recalled : 
 I did Winnie Winkle for 20 years , and when they told me , " You have 90 days to wrap it up , " because they were discontinuing it , I felt terrible , but after I finished it , I didn 't even miss it . I was depressed because I lost a good job , but I just didn 't miss it . Maybe it was the routine of it every week I didn 't miss , but I have a lot of good memories of doing that strip .

 In 1923 , Winnie 's adopted younger brother Perry Winkle and his friends the Rinkydinks became the focus of the Sunday pages . In Europe , only the Sunday pages were translated . In Holland and France , local artists made new comics about Perry when the number of weekly pages by Branner was no longer sufficient . 
 The Dutch translated the strip as <unk> van de <unk> which became very popular in the Netherlands , where it was the predecessor of the long @-@ running series <unk> en <unk> by Frans <unk> . 
 In France , it was known as <unk> and published by Hachette in 14 albums between 1926 and 1939 . 
 In Flanders , Belgium the series De <unk> <unk> by Willy Vandersteen and De <unk> <unk> by Marc Sleen were directly inspired by this strip . 
 The Sunday page of Winnie Winkle was the first American comic published in a Yugoslavian daily newspaper , Jutarnji list from Zagreb . It first appeared on August 5 , 1923 , and lasted until April 1941 , the beginning of World War II in that country . Perry , the hero , was renamed " Ivica " ( Johnny ) , and Winnie " Suzana . " The Rinkydinks were rechristened " <unk> , " allegedly after a group of kids from a contemporary Hollywood film series . The title was <unk> Ivica ( " Adventurous Johnny " ) . A single Christmas episode taking place in Zagreb was published , the work of unknown local authors . Three albums collected the stories published in the newspaper .

 " Strawberry Bubblegum " is characterized as a pop song by HitFix 's Melinda Newman , an R & B song by Billboard magazine 's Jason Lipshutz , and a combination of slick grooves and psychedelic soul by Arwa Haider of Metro . Jean Bentley of Hollywood.com found the song influenced by electro , while Pitchfork Media 's Ryan Dombal said that it evokes music by Barry White , Sly Stone , and Drake 's " ambient R & B " style . According to Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times , the song transitions from a stark electro song to an amiable keyboard vamp comparable to Stevie Wonder 's 1973 song " You Are the Sunshine of My Life " . The song features electronic blips , string movements , and upbeat percussion breaks . Mesfin Fekadu of Times Colonist wrote that the song is " smooth , airy and full of sexual innuendoes , and it transitions into something that 's heaven @-@ like . " Timberlake sings in a falsetto voice and refers to a mature woman as his strawberry bubblegum in the song 's lyrics . Joey Guerra of The Houston Chronicle remarked that the eccentric song recalls the work of Prince . Helen Brown of The Daily Telegraph attributed the song 's relaxing style to how it samples Barry White , while Lauren Martin of Fact found the song to be in the style of Frank Ocean . 
 " Strawberry Bubblegum " begins with the sound of a stylus dropping on a vinyl record . The line " Hey , pretty lady " is declared by a deep voice , and Timberlake sings " This goes out to you ! " . ABC News reporter Allan Raible wrote that " such a move seems engineered to make gullible teen girls in the audience scream " . The lyrics feature daft double @-@ entendres and are complemented by spoken @-@ word background vocals . MusicOMH 's David Meller wrote that the song 's transition into " ’ 70s funk @-@ cum @-@ porno keyboards " is likable , but may seem ridiculous to many listeners . The string loops and the record scratches on the song complete " the faux @-@ vintage " vibe of " Strawberry Bubblegum " . Raible concluded that it attempts to sound like Michael Jackson 's 2002 song " Butterflies " because of its delicate tone . According to Clyde Erwin Barretto of Prefix Mag , " Strawberry Bubblegum " takes its R & B style in a more avant @-@ garde direction , but its second half is more classic @-@ sounding . Craig Manning of the Western Herald said that the first half of " Strawberry Bubblegum " draws from Frank Ocean 's psychedelic style of R & B , while the outro is more comparable to the music of ' NSYNC , Timberlake 's former group . Jason Lipshutz called the outro " sashaying " and " pleasant " . 
 Lyrically , Timberlake assures his love interest that they are " making love like professionals " and declares : " If you ’ ll be my strawberry bubblegum , I ’ ll be your blueberry lollipop " . In addition , he sings about the girl 's many characteristics and sensual qualities , and proclaims that he will love her until they " make it pop " . The Boston Globe 's James Reed wrote that the lyrics are silly , but irresistible , while Sarah Dean of The Huffington Post found " Strawberry Bubblegum " as seductive as its title , but according to her , " if you had too much of it you might end up feeling a little sick " . Additionally , Timberlake sings lyrics about he has " recipe for a good time " . Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club felt that the lyrics ' sense of humor is somewhat similar to " Pop " by ' NSYNC .

Kitty Empire of The Observer wrote that the " surface silliness " of the song " deepens to a feeling of respect a few plays in , when the penny drops , and everything suddenly makes sense " . 
 Robert Copsey of Digital Spy wrote that while " Strawberry Bubblegum " is musically " rich and rewarding " , the lyrics are " embarrassingly cliché " . According to VH1 's <unk> Viera , one would expect a cliché such as " Strawberry Bubblegum " to " fall flat " . He wrote that Timberlake 's falsettos " make it almost cute " to hear a " grown man referring to a grown woman as his strawberry bubblegum " . He concluded that envisioning Timberlake perform on stage at a " small juke joint on Bill Street " is not " far fetched " . Lauren Martin of Fact wrote that " if you ’ re going to release an eight minute song with only two verses and a hook " , singing the words " strawberry " and " bubblegum " 34 and 20 times respectively " begins to grate " . Jed Gottlieb of The Boston Herald wrote that " Strawberry Bubblegum " is a " killer vamp " without a " killer change to hook us " .

 The word cock was first recorded in use as a vulgar term for the penis in 1618 , perhaps deriving from one of the word 's other meanings " a spout or short pipe serving as a channel for passing liquids through " . It was once common in England for areas to be given names that reflected their function or the activity taking place within them . Local historian Brian Lewis believes that may be the explanation for the name that locals gave to the bridge during the late 19th or early 20th century : " [ the underpass ] would function in the same way as any ' monkey run ' , where you paraded up and down to find a boyfriend or girlfriend " . 
 = = Replacement = = 
 The new underpass was designed by architects Deborah <unk> and Sam Potter of <unk> in collaboration with Brian Lewis and artist Martin Richman . Funding for the project was provided jointly by Wakefield Council , the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund , Network Rail , and the Arts Council England , Yorkshire . 
 After a competition in 2003 , design and planning work continued until 2007 . The Victorian underpass was replaced by a prefabricated concrete tunnel , twice the width and 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) taller than the original , by construction engineers Jane Wernick Associates in December 2005 . As the installation took place under a live railway line that was supported by the underpass , work was planned to cause the minimum disruption to train services ; the line had to be closed for only two days – Christmas Day and Boxing Day 2005 . The bridge 's surroundings were improved in 2008 , with better lighting , a new green space , and an angular seating shelter facing south @-@ west to catch the sun in the evening . Richman worked on the lighting scheme , and the designers decided to line the walls of the underpass with a tactile red flock material , as an allusion to its " colourful history " . 
 The new bridge was opened on 27 June 2008 by Councillors Denise Jefferey and Mark Burns Williamson . The Times newspaper described the £ 200 @,@ 000 structure as a " piece of sophisticated concrete geometry " . <unk> commented that it " is about cheering up those spots planning usually forgets about " . 
 The replacement of the underpass was one of twelve elements in the Castleford Regeneration Project , originally proposed in 2001 . It was featured in a four @-@ part television series , Kevin McCloud and the Big Town Plan , broadcast by Channel 4 in August – September 2008 . 
 = = Naming controversy = = 
 The council decided to name the new underpass Tittle Cott , a move that was met with dismay by local residents . The Castleford Area Voice for the Elderly , an over @-@ 50s group , organised a campaign to have the name Tickle Cock restored . The group 's chairman , Margaret Shillito , was quoted in the press as saying " the old plaque was wrong , it had the wrong name on and we were offended by it " . Brian Lewis was quoted as saying " I feel we should never alter names and Tickle Cock has a very clear message behind it " . A public meeting was held at which a " large majority " voted in favour of reverting to the original name , a decision that persuaded the council to replace the bridge 's plaque with one bearing the legend Tickle Cock . 
 = The Boat Race 1873 = 
 The 30th Boat Race took place on the 29 March 1873 . The Boat Race is an annual side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . In a race umpired by former Oxford rower Joseph William Chitty , Cambridge won by three lengths in a time of 19 minutes and 35 seconds , the fastest time in the history of the event . It was the first time that rowers raced on sliding seats .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having defeated Oxford by two lengths in the previous year 's race , while Oxford led overall with sixteen wins to Cambridge 's thirteen . 
 Although the use of sliding seats had been considered the previous year , the then @-@ Cambridge boat club president John Goldie disallowed the Light Blue boat manufacturer Harry Clasper from fitting them . However , for the 1873 race , both boats were , for the first time , fitted with the innovation . 
 Cambridge were coached by John Graham Chambers ( who rowed for Cambridge in the 1862 and 1863 races , and was non @-@ rowing boat club president for the 1865 race ) Oxford 's coaches was Robert Lesley , the non @-@ rowing president of Oxford University Boat Club ( who had rowed in the 1871 and 1872 races ) . 
 Joseph William Chitty ( who had rowed for Oxford twice in 1849 ( in the March and December races ) and the 1852 race ) returned as umpire for the race ( with Robert Lewis @-@ Lloyd having officiated the previous year ) while the starter was Edward Searle .

 = AgustaWestland AW101 = 
 The AgustaWestland AW101 is a medium @-@ lift helicopter used in both military and civil applications . It was developed by a joint venture between Westland Helicopters in the UK and Agusta in Italy in response to national requirements for a modern naval utility helicopter . Several operators , including the armed forces of Britain , Denmark , Norway and Portugal , use the name Merlin for their AW101 aircraft . It is manufactured at factories in Yeovil , England and <unk> , Italy ; licensed assembly work has also taken place in Japan and the United States . 
 Prior to 2007 , the aircraft had been marketed under the designation EH101 . The original designation was EHI 01 but a transcription error of a handwritten note changed this to EH101 and the designation stuck . In 2000 , Westland Helicopters and Agusta merged to form AgustaWestland , leading to the type 's redesignation as AW101 . The AW101 first flew in 1987 , and entered into service in 1999 . Since the AW101 's introduction , it has replaced several older helicopter types , such as the Sikorsky S @-@ 61 , performing roles such as medium @-@ sized transport , anti @-@ submarine warfare , and ship @-@ based utility operations . 
 The Royal Canadian Air Force ( RCAF ) operates a variant of the AW101 , designated CH @-@ 149 Cormorant , in the air @-@ sea rescue role . Another variant , designated VH @-@ 71 Kestrel , was developed to serve in the US presidential transport fleet ; however , the program was cancelled . Civil operators also use AW101s in roles such as passenger and VIP transportation . The type has been deployed to active combat theatres , such as in support of coalition forces during the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan .

 = = = Origins = = = 
 In 1977 , the UK Ministry of Defence issued a requirement for an anti @-@ submarine warfare ( ASW ) helicopter to replace the Royal Navy 's Westland Sea Kings , which were becoming inadequate in the face of advances in Soviet submarine technology . Westland Helicopters put together a proposal , designated <unk> , for a three @-@ engined helicopter of similar dimensions to the Sea King ; the <unk> was to feature more autonomy and a greater range than its predecessor . At the same time , the Italian Navy ( Marina Militare ) was also considering the replacement of its fleet of Sea Kings , which had been built by the Italian company Agusta ; Westland and Agusta soon began talks regarding the joint development of a successor helicopter . 
 Agusta and Westland finalised an agreement to work on the project together , and formed a jointly owned new company , EH Industries Limited ( EHI ) , to pursue the development and marketing of the new helicopter to potential operators . On 12 June 1981 , the UK government confirmed its participation in the project , allocated an initial budget of £ 20 million to develop nine pre @-@ series examples . A major agreement , which secured funding for the majority of the EH101 's development program , was signed by both the British and Italian governments in 1984 . At the 1985 Paris Air Show , Agusta showed a mock @-@ up of a utility version of the new helicopter , leading to a more generalised design that could be customised to meet the needs of various civilian or military customers . The first prototype flew on 9 October 1987 . 
 In 1987 , Canada had selected the EH101 to replace their Sea Kings in anti @-@ submarine warfare and search and rescue roles ; the EH101 's third engine and increased autonomy compared favorably against rivals such as the Sikorsky Seahawk , its range and de @-@ icing capability were also seen as vital for North Atlantic operations . The fledgling EH101 , of which up to 50 were on order to replace the Canadian Armed Forces 's ( CAF ) Sea Kings , found itself subject to a wider political battle between the Conservative and Liberal parties , the latter viewing the aircraft as too costly . Critics attacked the EH101 purchase as excessive and unnecessary after the Cold War 's end in the early 1990s . Wide @-@ ranging cost estimates were presented by both proponents and opponents of the EH101 procurement , with opponents backing life extensions of Sikorsky CH @-@ 124 Sea King and Boeing Vertol CH @-@ 113 Labrador helicopter fleets . The EH101 controversy was seen as a factor in the 1993 Canadian federal election . The order was cancelled by the new Liberal government in 1993 resulting in a $ 470 million cancellation fee . 
 = = = Into production = = = 
 Several pre @-@ production aircraft were assembled during the late 1980s and early 1990s . Flight tests were suspended for six months following the crash of the second pre @-@ production aircraft on 21 January 1993 . On 6 June 1993 , the first EH101 flew with the Rolls @-@ Royce / Turbomeca RTM322 turboshaft engine . Nine prototypes were built to explore military and civil applications , including a " <unk> " configuration . In February 1995 , Britain formally placed its first order for a total of 22 EH101s ; this was quickly followed by Italy 's order for 16 EH101s in October 1995 . The EH101 order was not without controversy , the RAF had declared its preference for an all @-@ Chinook fleet ; also , Boeing allegedly offered cheaper terms for the Chinook . RAF deliveries began in 1997 ; RN deliveries started the following year . 
 In 2005 , a team of AgustaWestland and Lockheed Martin was selected as the winners of the US VXX competition to replace the President 's Marine One helicopters of the United States Marine Corps . A variant of the AW101 , designated VH @-@ 71 Kestrel , was to be manufactured domestically and had proceeded into the flight testing stages . However the programme encountered significant cost overruns and political opposition , which led to the procurement being scrapped in June 2009 . Separately , the Marine Corps had also conducted studies into the adoption of the EH101 as a fallback option to the Bell @-@ Boeing V @-@ 22 Osprey tiltrotor during the 1990s . 
 Following the merger of Westland and Agusta to form AgustaWestland in 2000 , there was no need for the separate EHI entity ; the EH101 was formally re @-@ branded as the AW101 in 2007 . In 2008 , the volume of AW101 orders was reported as having filled production capacity in excess of the following five years . By April 2009 , more than 180 AW101s had been sold worldwide ; the combined operational fleet had also accumulated a total of 170 @,@ 000 flying hours .

 In November 2007 , Algeria signed a contract for 6 AW101 helicopters . In August 2012 , it was reported that Algeria had signed an agreement with AgustaWestland for the provision of up to 80 helicopters , 42 of which were to be AW101s . Under the terms of this arrangement , early aircraft were to be manufactured by AgustaWestland , while Algeria was to commence the assembly of some AW101s later on . 
 The AW101 was a candidate in the Norwegian All Weather Search and Rescue Helicopter ( NAWSARH ) programme to replace the Royal Norwegian Air Force 's Westland Sea King <unk> helicopter fleet . Other candidates included Bell Boeing V @-@ 22 Osprey , Eurocopter EC225 , NHIndustries NH90 , and Sikorsky S @-@ 92 . Iceland cooperated with Norway on the programme and was to buy 3 – 4 helicopters to replace its Super Puma helicopters , but withdrew in 2012 due to limited finances . The AW101 was selected in November 2013 . 
 On 7 June 2010 , it was announced that Boeing had acquired a manufacturing license and the rights from AgustaWestland for US production of a localised AW101 variant , designated as the Boeing 101 . In October 2012 , the AW101 was submitted in a U.S. Air Force competition to replace the HH @-@ 60 Pave Hawk ; however , the bid was dropped three months later . 
 In September 2013 , AgustaWestland was reportedly in the process of acquiring new civil certification for the AW101 , target customers include long @-@ range offshore oil platform transport operators and VIP clients . As of February 2014 , AgustaWestland was considering adapting the AW101 as a heavyweight unmanned aerial vehicle , it is proposed that in this configuration an AW101 could be optionally manned . 
 = = Design = = 
 = = = Overview = = = 
 The AW101 Merlin follows a conventional design layout , but makes use of advanced technologies , such as the design of the rotor blades , avionics systems , and the extensive use of composite materials . The fuselage structure is modular and comprises an aluminium @-@ lithium alloy , designed to be both light and damage @-@ resistant . The AW101 is designed for operating in extreme weather conditions ; it is fitted with a de @-@ icing system and rated to operate in temperatures ranging between − 45 to + 50 ° C. The aircraft 's control systems allow the AW101 to maintain a stable hover in 74 km / h ( 40 kn ) crosswinds . 
 An active vibration control system , known as the active control of structural response system , reduces airframe vibration by up to 80 % which increases crew comfort and minimises the buildup of stress on the airframe . The cockpit is fitted with armoured seats for the crew , and can withstand an impact velocity of over 10 m / s . Dual flight controls are provided , though the AW101 can be flown by a single person . The pilots ' instrument displays include six full @-@ colour high @-@ definition screens and an optional mission display ; a digital map or forward looking infrared ( FLIR ) display can also be installed . 
 = = = Powerplant = = = 
 The AW101 is powered by three turboshaft engines . The Rolls @-@ Royce / Turbomeca RTM322 and General Electric <unk> are the two available engine types . The Rolls @-@ Royce RTM322 was specifically developed for the AW101 ; it was subsequently adopted on the WAH @-@ 64 Apache and the NHIndustries NH90 helicopters . About 80 % of AW101s use the RTM322 powerplant , according to Rolls @-@ Royce . 
 The engines power an 18 @.@ 59 metre diameter five @-@ bladed main rotor . The rotor blades are constructed from carbon / glass with <unk> honeycomb and <unk> foam , edged with titanium alloy in a sandwich construction . The shaping of the main rotor blades is derived from the BERP rotor blades first used on the Westland Lynx . This blade design improves aerodynamic efficiency at the blade tip and reduces the acoustic signature . Improved BERP IV rotors have since been developed ; when installed , this increases the AW101 's maximum takeoff weight . 
 Each engine is supplied by a separate 1 @,@ 074 litre ( 276 US Gallon , 230 Imperial Gallon ) fuel tank using dual booster pumps . Optional fourth and fifth tanks can be added to act as a reservoir supply , topping up the main tanks during flight , increasing range or endurance . The AW101 can also be outfitted with a probe for aerial refuelling . Self @-@ sealing fuel tanks are an optional item to be selected by the customer . An inlet particle separator system can be installed , protecting the engine when operating in sandy environments . 
 = = = Armament and defensive systems = = = 
 Most variants of the AW101 are equipped with self @-@ defence systems , such as chaff and flare dispensers , directed infrared countermeasures ( infrared jammers ) , ESM ( electronic support measures in the form of RF heads ) , and a laser detection and warning system . British Merlins have been outfitted with protective armour against small @-@ arms fire . A chin @-@ mounted forward looking infrared ( FLIR ) imaging sensor has been fitted to some variants . 
 Two hardpoints are present on the underside of the airframe on which the HM1 model can carry four Sting Ray torpedoes or Mk 11 Mod 3 depth charges . Some customers have chosen to deploy the Marte anti @-@ ship missile on the AW101 ; as of 2011 , the Royal Navy is considering equipping their Merlin fleet with an anti @-@ surface missile . The Mk1 , Mk3 and <unk> variants can mount general purpose machine guns in up to five locations in the main cabin , aimed out of both door and window apertures . AgustaWestland has examined the integration of rockets and additional ground @-@ attack weapons . 
 = = = Avionics = = = 
 Westland and IBM formed a consortium in 1991 to perform the helicopter 's complex systems integration . The AW101 features a network of helicopter management and mission systems designed to reduce pilot workload and enable the helicopter to undertake a wide variety of missions . A digital automatic flight control system ( AFCS ) is employed by the AW101 . The AFCS allows the operation of a four @-@ axis ( pitch , roll , yaw and collective ) autopilot and the automatic stabilisation system , and is linked in with the aircraft 's flight management systems . The AFCS , manufactured by Smiths Aerospace , is a dual @-@ duplex system using two flight computers to provide redundancy and fault @-@ tolerance . 
 The AW101 's navigation system includes a GPS receiver and inertial navigation system , VHF omnidirectional radio range ( VOR ) , instrument landing system ( ILS ) , TACAN , and automatic direction finding . The Mk1 and Mk3 are equipped with a Doppler velocity system ( DVS ) which provides relative ground velocities ; the DVS is also linked into the AFCS as part of the <unk> system . For safety , the aircraft is equipped with obstacle and terrain avoidance warning systems , traffic collision avoidance system ( TCAS ) , and both voice and flight data recorders . 
 The AW101 is equipped with the Blue Kestrel search and detection radar which is capable of 360 degree scanning and can detect small targets as far as 25 nautical miles . As part of the Royal Navy 's Merlin HM2 upgrade program , Lockheed Martin implemented a series of improvements to the radar , notably allowing it to track 40 times the number of targets previously capable . Danish EH101s are fitted with the <unk> @-@ 1600 search and weather radar . Royal Navy Merlins are equipped with the <unk> anti @-@ submarine system for processing <unk> data from sonobuoys to detect and target submerged submarines . The <unk> was derived from the system on the earlier Hawker Siddeley Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft . 
 = = = Crew and cargo = = = 
 The AW101 is typically operated by a crew of three : a pilot , an observer , and a crewman / operator . The pilot is able to fly for the majority of a mission in a hands @-@ off mode , enabled by the sophisticated autopilot . All crew members have individual access to management computers and tactical information . 
 The fuselage has a volume of 31 @.@ 91 cubic metres ( 1 @,@ 127 cu ft ) and the cargo compartment is 6 @.@ 5 metres ( 21 ft ) in length , 2 @.@ 3 metres ( 7 ft 7 in ) wide and 1 @.@ 91 metres ( 6 ft 3 in ) high . The military version of the AW101 can accommodate up to 24 seated or 45 standing combat troops and their equipment . Alternative loads include a medical team and 16 stretchers , and cargo pallets . 
 The ramp , 1 @.@ 91 by 2 @.@ 3 metres ( 6 ft 3 in × 7 ft 7 in ) , can take a 3 @,@ 050 @-@ kilogram ( 6 @,@ 720 lb ) load , allowing it to carry vehicles such as Land Rovers . The ramp and cabin floor are fitted with flush tie @-@ down points . A cargo hook under the fuselage can carry external loads of 5 @,@ 440 kilograms ( 11 @,@ 990 lb ) via the use of a semi @-@ automatic cargo release unit ( <unk> ) . A rescue hoist and a hover trim controller are fitted at the cargo door . An optional cargo winch can be installed near to the rear ramp .

 The RN 's final order was for 44 ASW aircraft , originally designated Merlin HAS.1 but soon changed to Merlin HM1 . The first fully operational Merlin was delivered on 17 May 1997 , entering service on 2 June 2000 . All aircraft were delivered by the end of 2002 , and are operated by four Fleet Air Arm squadrons : 814 NAS , 820 NAS , 824 NAS and 829 NAS , all based at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall . 700 NAS was the Merlin Operational Evaluation Unit from 2000 to 2008 . In March 2004 , Navy Merlins were temporarily grounded following an incident at RNAS Culdrose in which a tail rotor failed due to a manufacturing defect . An improved tail rotor was designed and adopted on most AW101s ; according to AgustaWestland , the redesigned rotor also significantly reduced associated maintenance . 
 In 1995 , it was announced that the Navy 's Westland Lynx helicopters would be retired in favour of an all @-@ Merlin fleet . However , the subsequent 2010 SDSR stated that the future naval helicopters would be the Merlin and the Wildcat , a derivative of the Lynx . Royal Navy Merlins have seen action in the Caribbean , on counter @-@ narcotics and hurricane support duties , as well as maritime security duties in the Persian Gulf . Merlins have also seen active duty in Iraq , providing support to British and coalition forces based in the region . 
 The Merlin HM1 has been cleared to operate from the Royal Navy 's aircraft carriers , amphibious assault ships , Type 23 frigates and several Royal Fleet Auxiliary ( RFA ) vessels including the Fort Victoria @-@ class ; it is also to equip the Type 45 destroyer . 30 aircraft have been upgraded to Merlin HM2 standard under the £ 750m Merlin Capability Sustainment Programme ; Lockheed Martin UK delivered the final HM2 on 11 July 2016 . The HM2 has a new mission system , digital cockpit , electro @-@ optical camera and multi @-@ static processing for the sonar system . The HM2 performed its first ship @-@ borne test flight in September 2012 and achieved IOC on 30 June 2014 , after nine HM2 had flown 480 hours from Illustrious during Exercise Deep Blue earlier that month . It was also reported that some of the eight airframes not scheduled to be upgraded for financial reasons may be updated . 
 Five <unk> are in maintenance at any one time , leaving 25 available at readiness , of which 14 will be assigned to the Queen Elizabeth @-@ class aircraft carrier . In addition to its anti @-@ submarine role , the HM2 will be able to carry an airborne early warning ( AEW ) pod under procurement through the Crowsnest programme to replace the Sea King ASaC7 . In September 2011 , Thales UK proposed re @-@ using Sea King ASaC7 equipment , such as the Searchwater 2000 , on the Merlin ; Lockheed Martin has proposed developing a new multi @-@ functional sensor for either the AW101 or other aircraft . Lockheed originally planned to use a derivative of the F @-@ 35 's APG @-@ 81 radar but is now believed to be using an Elta system ; both it and the Thales system will begin flight trials in the summer of 2014 with Main Gate in 2016 . Ten pods are planned with IOC in 2019 . On 22 May 2015 , The MOD and Lockheed Martin UK , as the prime contractor for Crowsnest , selected Thales as the chosen bidder to provide the radar and mission system at the heart of the Crowsnest capability . 
 On 15 December 2009 , plans were announced to transfer RAF Merlin <unk> and <unk> to the Commando Helicopter Force to replace retiring Sea King HC4 helicopters . The Sea King is to retire in 2016 , after which the Navy will operate a combination of the Wildcat and Merlin . 846 NAS reformed with ex @-@ RAF Merlin <unk> on 30 September 2014 ; 845 NAS followed on 9 July 2015 .

 The RAF ordered 22 Merlin HC3 for transport missions , the first of which entered service in January 2001 with No. 28 Squadron RAF based at RAF Benson . The type is equipped with extended @-@ range fuel tanks and is capable of air @-@ to @-@ air refuelling . The Merlin is frequently utilised for troop transport duties and for the transport of bulky objects , either internally or underslung , including vehicles and artillery . The Merlin Depth Maintenance Facility at RNAS Culdrose performed most tasks upon the Merlin HC3 . 
 The Merlin 's first operational deployment was to the Balkans region in 2003 . RAF Merlins were first deployed to Iraq as part of Operation Telic in 2004 , supporting coalition forces and were operated as the main medevac asset in southern Iraq ; both Flight Lieutenant Kev Harris and Flight Lieutenant Michelle Goodman were awarded the DFC during this period . Merlins routinely operated around Basra until Britain 's withdrawal in June 2009 . 
 In 2002 , Westland made an unsuccessful unsolicited offer to the British Ministry of Defence , proposing an enhanced Merlin variant intended to satisfy the demand for additional lift capacity . An alternative measure was the acquisition of six AW101s from Denmark in 2007 ; designated Merlin HC3A , these were assigned to the RAF , allowing Merlins to be deployed in Afghanistan . The HC3A is used for training and not for frontline operations due to various configuration differences . In December 2007 , a second Merlin squadron , No. 78 Squadron was formed at Benson . 
 In 2009 , five Merlin Mk3s were operating in Afghanistan , transporting troops and supplies . The deployment to Afghanistan was criticized as the aircraft reportedly lacked protective Kevlar armour . By July 2010 , the Merlin fleet was fully fitted with ballistic armour . The deployment of Merlins to Afghanistan allowed the detachment of Sea Kings to be withdrawn from the region in October 2011 . As part of the UK drawdown in Afghanistan , Merlins were withdrawn from theatre in June 2013 . 
 In 2012 , the RAF 's Merlin HC3 / 3A fleet began to be transferred to the Royal Navy for use by the Commando Helicopter Force . Royal Navy personnel worked alongside RAF crew at Benson to build experience during the transition . A £ <unk> Merlin Life Sustainment Programme will see 25 HC3 / 3A airframes fitted with the cockpit electronics of the HM2 , folding tails and main rotor heads , strengthened landing gear , deck lashing mounting points , obsolescence updates , fast @-@ roping points and a common emergency egress system . The first HC4 will begin flight trials in September 2017 , with an IOC in mid @-@ 2018 ; an interim folding main rotor head will be fitted to some HC3 for shipborne operations prior to the HC4 upgrade . Command of the UK Merlin HC3 / 3A fleet was formally transferred from the RAF to the Royal Navy during a ceremony at RAF Benson on 30 September 2014 . As part of the same ceremony , the RAF 's 78 Sqn was disbanded and the Royal Navy 's 846 Naval Air Squadron stood @-@ up with the Merlin . The RAF 's 28 ( AC ) continued to operate as part of the Commando Helicopter Force until July 2015 , when 28 ( AC ) Sqn stood down and 845 Naval Air Squadron stood @-@ up . 846 NAS relocated from RAF Benson to RNAS Yeovilton in March 2015 , with 845 NAS due to follow in July 2016 .

 In 1997 , the Italian government ordered twenty EH101 helicopters for the Italian Navy , with options for four more . These EH101s included ten of the anti @-@ surface / submarine ( ASuW / ASW ) version , four airborne early warning ( AEW ) , four utility , and four amphibious support helicopters ( <unk> ) . As of June 2011 , the AW101 has also been chosen to meet an Italian Air Force ( Aeronautica Militare Italiana ) requirement for up to 12 helicopters in the combat search and rescue role to replace several ageing Sea King HH @-@ 3F ; deliveries are expected from 2014 onwards . 
 The first Italian Navy production helicopter ( <unk> ) flew on 4 October 1999 and was officially presented to the press on 6 December 1999 . Italy accepted delivery of the 21st AW101 , configured for anti @-@ submarine warfare , on 4 August 2009 . Italian EH101s have operated from a variety of ships and have seen service overseas ; in 2009 the Italian Navy used its AW101 fleet as executive transports for visiting heads of state and officials during the 35th G8 summit . 
 In 2010 , the Italian Navy deployed three AW101s to Afghanistan , where they were flown in both the transport and utility roles . In 2011 , it was reported that the Italian contingent in Afghanistan , consisting of AW101s , had been providing coverage of a wide area of the country .

 In 1997 , in light of the declining condition of its helicopter fleet , Canada launched the Canadian Search and Rescue Helicopter competition . It was won by the EH101 , which was designated CH @-@ 149 Cormorant in Canadian service . 
 In 2004 , the EH101 was entered into a Canadian competition to replace the shipboard Sea King fleet , but the Sikorsky CH @-@ 148 Cyclone was selected . In 2013 , following difficulties with the CH @-@ 148 procurement , the Royal Canadian Air Force ( RCAF ) was reported to be seriously considering canceling the contract with Sikorsky and was investigating the possibility of procuring the AW101 instead . 
 = = = Royal Danish Air Force = = = 
 In 2001 , the Royal Danish Air Force ( RDAF ) announced the purchase of eight EH101s for SAR duties and six tactical troop transports for 722 Squadron . The last of the 14 AW101s was delivered in March 2007 and the first SAR AW101s became operational out of <unk> Airport in April 2007 . In 2007 , the six troop transport AW101s were transferred to the British MOD ; in exchange , the British government ordered six new @-@ build AW101s as replacements for the RDAF . 
 Danish AW101s have a higher gross weight capacity of 15 @,@ 600 kg and were , as delivered , coated in a paint designed to reduce the aircraft 's infrared signature . In the SAR role , RDAF AW101s have a crew of six and were initially painted yellow to distinguish themselves from AW101 allocated to military duties , but were later painted green , and all 14 AW101s are used for SAR and troop transport . 
 On 28 January 2008 , the drive shaft of a Danish AW101 broke , leading to an emergency landing at Billund Airport . Following the incident , the Danish fleet was grounded as a precaution and the AW101 's future was publicly debated . In the first six months of 2008 , the RDAF reported an operational availability of roughly 50 % , well below the target of 80 % , partly due to an inadequate maintenance organization and staff shortages . 
 In January 2011 , the Danish Ministry of Defence reportedly could not afford the retrofitting of the AW101 fleet for Afghanistan operations , against earlier reports of a deployment in 2012 . In February 2013 , Aviation Week reported that earlier reliability problems had been resolved and that a full upgrade package would be applied to Danish AW101s ; these included the addition of electronic warfare pods and a new electro @-@ optical system , in advance of a deployment in Afghanistan in 2014 . In September 2013 , Danish AW101s were to receive L @-@ 3 Wescam MX @-@ 15 electro @-@ optical / infrared ( EO / IR ) sensors ; SAR aircraft already carry the FLIR Systems Star Safire II EO / IR sensor .

 On 25 October 2007 , a project started that had the intent to replace all Westland Sea King search and rescue helicopters with new , temporal rescue helicopters by 2020 . On 19 December 2013 , a contract was signed between AgustaWestland and the government , for the purchase of 16 AgustaWestland AW101 helicopters . The agreement came about after fierce competition between different manufacturers to satisfy the Norwegian requirements . Participants were AgustaWestland , Eurocopter , NHIndustries , Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation and The Boeing Company . The Government considered that AgustaWestland AW101 met the requirements and specifications in the best possible way .

 The Portuguese Air Force had purchased 12 Merlins under a € 446 million contract , the first of which was delivered on 22 December 2004 . The type has been used to conduct transport , search and rescue , and maritime surveillance missions , progressively replacing the Aérospatiale Puma previously tasked with these missions . The main role of Portuguese AW101s is to perform search and rescue missions within Portugal 's maritime zone . They are operated by 751 Squadron and are kept on constant alert at three bases : Montijo near Lisbon , Lajes Field on the Azores , and Porto Santo Island .

 The Japan Maritime Self @-@ Defense Force ( JMSDF ) ordered 14 aircraft in 2003 to use in both the airborne mine countermeasures ( <unk> ) and transport roles . The AW101 was modified by Kawasaki Heavy Industries , and the Japan Defense Agency designated the model MCH @-@ 101 . Special features of the MCH @-@ 101 include the automated folding of the rotor and tail . The MCH @-@ 101 has also been outfitted with Northrop Grumman 's <unk> @-@ 24A for the mine @-@ hunting role . 
 In 2002 , AgustaWestland , Kawasaki and Marubeni entered a general agreement for cooperation ; Kawasaki began the assembly of both the CH @-@ 101 and the MCH @-@ 101 in 2003 . Kawasaki also began licensed production of the RTM322 engines in 2005 . In a separate agreement between Marubeni and AgustaWestland , a supply depot was established in Japan to support the MCH @-@ 101 and CH @-@ 101 fleets . The first MCH @-@ 101 was delivered to the JMSDF on 3 March 2006 . 
 The MCH @-@ 101 will replace the MH @-@ 53E ( S @-@ 80 @-@ M @-@ 1 ) in the <unk> role . The CH @-@ 101 will operate in the transport / support role for Antarctic missions , replacing the Sikorsky S @-@ 61A , and will be working in coordination with the Ministry of Education , Culture , Sports , Science and Technology . 
 = = = VIP and other usage = = = 
 AgustaWestland developed a specialized luxury variant , the AW101 VVIP ( Very Very Important Person , i.e. a head of state ) , aimed at business and VIP customers . As of April 2009 , 15 % of all AW101s sold were for VIP purposes . By September 2013 , customers operating the VIP variant included Saudi Arabia , Algeria , Nigeria and Turkmenistan . 
 The AW101 was being acquired by the United States Marine Corps under the VXX program as a replacement for the Presidential Marine One helicopters . Designated VH @-@ 71 Kestrel , the variant was heavily customized and equipped with various self @-@ defense systems . However , in 2009 the VH @-@ 71 procurement was abruptly terminated following the withdrawal of funding . In 2010 , Boeing considered an AW101 submission in the restarted VXX program . 
 In April 2009 , India ordered 12 AW101 to serve as executive transport helicopters for the Indian President and Prime Minister . The selection followed field trial assessments between the AW101 and the Sikorsky S @-@ 92 held in 2008 . However , the procurement was put on hold and subsequently cancelled due to the 2013 Indian helicopter bribery scandal , in which Finmeccanica , AgustaWestland 's parent company , had allegedly used bribes to win the contract . The three helicopters delivered as part of the contract may be returned to the manufacturer as part of the arbitration process .

" About.com described it as a " solid midtempo beat . " The song is composed in the key of C ♯ minor . The song is moderately paced , and the introduction and outro are sung in a sing @-@ and @-@ tell format with Bieber repetitively voicing the line " Me plus you / Imma tell you one time . " The verses are sung with backing R & B infused bass beats with a light string background in the same moderate pace before the bridge prepares for the refrain through the lines " Your world is my world / My fight is your fight / My breath is your breath / And your heart . " Bieber goes into the middle eight the backing is not as much indistinguishable from the rest of the song , but is delivered a little slower leading up to the chorus and outro .

Billboard 's Michael Menachem called the song " a hallmark pop song that also taps into a prevalent teen hip @-@ hop aesthetic " . He also compared Bieber to Brown on the track , and said that " [ Bieber 's ] tenor brings to mind [ Brown 's ] vocal debut on " Run It ! " in 2005 , when he , too , was 15 and on the cusp of stardom " . Unlike Lamb , Menachem said the song gave Bieber 's vocals plenty of room to shine as he confidently breaks into the chorus .

 = Battle of the Bismarck Sea = 
 The Battle of the Bismarck Sea ( 2 – 4 March 1943 ) took place in the South West Pacific Area ( SWPA ) during World War II when aircraft of the U.S. Fifth Air Force and the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) attacked a Japanese convoy carrying troops to Lae , New Guinea . Most of the task force was destroyed , and Japanese troop losses were heavy . 
 The Japanese convoy was a result of a Japanese Imperial General Headquarters decision in December 1942 to reinforce their position in the South West Pacific . A plan was devised to move some 6 @,@ 900 troops from Rabaul directly to Lae . The plan was understood to be risky , because Allied air power in the area was strong , but it was decided to proceed because otherwise the troops would have to be landed a considerable distance away and march through inhospitable swamp , mountain and jungle terrain without roads before reaching their destination . On 28 February 1943 , the convoy – comprising eight destroyers and eight troop transports with an escort of approximately 100 fighters – set out from Simpson Harbour in Rabaul . 
 The Allies had detected preparations for the convoy , and naval codebreakers in Melbourne ( FRUMEL ) and Washington , D.C. , had decrypted and translated messages indicating the convoy ’ s intended destination and date of arrival . The Allied Air Forces had developed new techniques they hoped would improve the chances of successful air attack on ships . They detected and shadowed the convoy , which came under sustained air attack on 2 – 3 March 1943 . Follow @-@ up attacks by PT boats and aircraft were made on 4 March . All eight transports and four of the escorting destroyers were sunk . Out of 6 @,@ 900 troops who were badly needed in New Guinea , only about 1 @,@ 200 made it to Lae . Another 2 @,@ 700 were rescued by destroyers and submarines and returned to Rabaul . The Japanese made no further attempts to reinforce Lae by ship , greatly hindering their ultimately unsuccessful efforts to stop Allied offensives in New Guinea .

 Six months after Imperial Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941 , the United States won a strategic victory at the Battle of Midway . Seizing the strategic initiative , the United States and its Allies landed on Guadalcanal in the southern Solomon Islands in August 1942 , beginning the Solomon Islands Campaign . The battle for Guadalcanal ended in victory for the Allies with the withdrawal of Japanese forces from the island in early February 1943 . At the same time , Australian and American forces in New Guinea repulsed the Japanese land offensive along the Kokoda Track . Going on the offensive , the Allied forces captured Buna – Gona , destroying Japanese forces in that area . 
 The ultimate goal of the Allied counter @-@ offensives in New Guinea and the Solomons was to capture the main Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain , later codified as Operation Cartwheel , and clear the way for the eventual reconquest of the Philippines . Recognising the threat , the Japanese continued to send land , naval , and aerial reinforcements to the area in an attempt to check the Allied advances . 
 = = = Japanese plans = = = 
 Reviewing the progress of the Battle of Guadalcanal and the Battle of Buna – Gona in December 1942 , the Japanese faced the prospect that neither could be held . Accordingly , Imperial General Headquarters decided to take steps to strengthen the Japanese position in the South West Pacific by sending Lieutenant General <unk> Aoki ’ s 20th Division from Korea to Guadalcanal and Lieutenant General Heisuke Abe ’ s 41st Division from China to Rabaul . Lieutenant General Hitoshi Imamura , the commander of the Japanese Eighth Area Army at Rabaul , ordered Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi ’ s XVIII Army to secure Madang , Wewak and <unk> in New Guinea . On 29 December , Adachi ordered the 102nd Infantry Regiment and other units under the command of Major General Toru Okabe , the commander of the infantry group of the 51st Division , to move from Rabaul to Lae and advance inland to capture Wau . Following the decision to evacuate Guadalcanal on 4 January , the Japanese switched priorities from the Solomon Islands to New Guinea , and it was decided to send the 20th and 41st Divisions to Wewak . 
 On 5 January 1943 , the convoy , which consisted of five destroyers and five troop transports carrying Okabe ’ s force , set out for Lae from Rabaul . Forewarned by Ultra , United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) and Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) aircraft spotted , shadowed and attacked the convoy , which was shielded by low clouds and Japanese fighters . The Allies claimed to have shot down 69 Japanese aircraft for the loss of 10 of their own . An RAAF Consolidated PBY Catalina sank the transport <unk> Maru . Although destroyers rescued 739 of the 1 @,@ 100 troops on board , the ship took with it all of Okabe ’ s medical supplies . Another transport , <unk> Maru , was so badly damaged at Lae by USAAF North American B @-@ 25 Mitchells that it had to be beached . Nonetheless , the convoy succeeded in reaching Lae on 7 January and landing its troops , but Okabe was defeated in the Battle of Wau . 
 Most of the 20th Division was landed at Wewak from naval high speed transports on 19 January 1943 . The bulk of the 41st Division followed on 12 February . Imamura and Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa , the commander of the South East Area Fleet , developed a plan to move the command post of the headquarters of the Japanese XVIII Army and the main body of the 51st Division from Rabaul to Lae on 3 March , followed by moving the remainder of the 20th Division to Madang on 10 March . This plan was acknowledged to be risky because Allied air power in the area was strong . The XVIII Army staff held war games that predicted losses of four out of ten transports , and between 30 and 40 aircraft . They gave the operation only a 50 – 50 chance of success . On the other hand , if the troops were landed at Madang , they faced a march of more than 140 mi ( 230 km ) over inhospitable swamp , mountain and jungle terrain without roads . To augment the three naval and two army fighter groups in the area assigned to protect the convoy , the Imperial Japanese Navy temporarily detached 18 fighters from the aircraft carrier Zuihō ’ s fighter group from Truk to Kavieng . 
 = = = Allied intelligence = = = 
 The Allies soon began detecting signs of preparations for a new convoy . A Japanese floatplane of the type normally used for anti @-@ submarine patrols in advance of convoys was sighted on 7 February 1943 . The Allied Air Forces South West Pacific Area commander – Lieutenant General George Kenney – ordered an increase in reconnaissance patrols over Rabaul . On 14 February , aerial photographs were taken that showed 79 vessels in port , including 45 merchant ships and six transports . It was clear that another convoy was being prepared , but its destination was unknown . On 16 February , naval codebreakers in Melbourne ( FRUMEL ) and Washington , D.C. finished decrypting and translating a coded message revealing the Japanese intention to land convoys at Wewak , Madang and Lae . Subsequently , codebreakers decrypted a message from the Japanese 11th Air Fleet to the effect that destroyers and six transports would reach Lae about 5 March . Another report indicated that they would reach Lae by 12 March . On 22 February , reconnaissance aircraft reported 59 merchant vessels in the harbour at Rabaul . 
 Kenney read this Ultra intelligence in the office of the Supreme Allied Commander , South West Pacific Area – General Douglas MacArthur – on 25 February . The prospect of an additional 6 @,@ 900 Japanese troops in the Lae area greatly disturbed MacArthur , as they might seriously affect his plans to capture and develop the area . Kenney wrote out orders , which were sent by courier , for Brigadier General Ennis Whitehead , the deputy commander of the Fifth Air Force , and the commander of its Advance Echelon ( ADVON ) in New Guinea . Under the Fifth Air Force ’ s unusual command arrangements , Whitehead controlled the Allied Air Forces units of all types in New Guinea . This included the RAAF units there , which were grouped as No. 9 Operational Group RAAF , under the command of Air Commodore Joe Hewitt . 
 Kenney informed Whitehead of the proposed convoy date , and warned him about the usual Japanese pre @-@ convoy air attack . He also urged that flying hours be cut back so as to allow for a large strike on the convoy , and instructed him to move forward as many aircraft as possible so that they could be close to the nearby captured airfields around Dobodura , where they would not be subject to the vagaries of weather over the Owen Stanley Range . Kenney flew up to Port Moresby on 26 February , where he met with Whitehead . The two generals inspected fighter and bomber units in the area , and agreed to attack the Japanese convoy in the Vitiaz Strait . Kenney returned to Brisbane on 28 February .

 In the South West Pacific , a conventional strategic bombing campaign was out of the question , as industrial targets in Japan were well beyond the range of even the largest strategic bombers operating from bases in Australia and New Guinea . Therefore , the primary mission of the Allied bomber force was interdiction of Japanese supply lines , especially the sea lanes . The results of the effort against the Japanese convoy in January were very disappointing ; some 416 sorties had been flown with only two ships sunk and three damaged , so clearly , a change of tactics was in order . Group Captain Bill Garing , an RAAF officer on Kenney ’ s staff with considerable experience in air @-@ sea operations , including a tour of duty in Europe , recommended that Japanese convoys be subjected to simultaneous attack from different altitudes and directions . 
 Major Paul I. " Pappy " Gunn and his men at the 81st Depot Repair Squadron in Townsville , Queensland , modified some USAAF Douglas A @-@ 20 Havoc light bombers by installing four .50 @-@ inch ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) machine guns in their noses in September 1942 . Two 450 @-@ US @-@ gallon ( 1 @,@ 700 l ; 370 imp gal ) fuel tanks were added , giving the aircraft more range . An attempt was then made in December 1942 to create a longer range attack aircraft by doing the same thing to a B @-@ 25 medium bomber to convert it to a " commerce destroyer " , but this proved to be somewhat more difficult . The resulting aircraft was nose heavy despite added lead ballast in the tail , and the vibrations caused by firing the machine guns were enough to make rivets pop out of the skin of the aircraft . The tail guns and belly turrets were removed , the latter being of little use if the aircraft was flying low . The new tactic of having the B @-@ 25 strafe ships would be tried in this battle . 
 The Allied Air Forces also adopted other innovative tactics . In February 1942 , the RAAF began experimenting with skip bombing , an anti @-@ shipping technique used by the British and Germans . Flying only a few dozen feet above the sea toward their targets , bombers would release their bombs which would then , ideally , ricochet across the surface of the water and explode at the side of the target ship , under it , or just over it . A similar technique was mast @-@ height bombing , in which bombers would approach the target at low altitude , 200 to 500 feet ( 61 to 152 m ) , at about 265 to 275 miles per hour ( 426 to 443 km / h ) , and then drop down to mast height , 10 to 15 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 to 4 @.@ 6 m ) at about 600 yards ( 550 m ) from the target . They would release their bombs at around 300 yards ( 270 m ) , aiming directly at the side of the ship . The Battle of the Bismarck Sea would demonstrate that this was the more successful of the two tactics . The two techniques were not mutually exclusive : a bomber could drop two bombs , skipping the first and launching the second at mast height . Practice missions were carried out against the wreck of the SS Pruth , a liner that had run aground in 1923 . 
 The Fifth Air Force had two heavy bomber groups . The 43rd Bombardment Group was equipped with about 55 Boeing B @-@ 17 Flying Fortresses . Most of these had seen hard war service over the previous six months and the availability rate was low . The recently arrived 90th Bombardment Group was equipped with Consolidated B @-@ 24 Liberators , but they too had maintenance problems . There were two medium groups : the 38th Bombardment Group , equipped with B @-@ 25 Mitchells , and the 22nd Bombardment Group , equipped with Martin B @-@ 26 Marauders , but two of the former ’ s four squadrons had been diverted to the South Pacific Area , and the latter had taken so many losses that it had been withdrawn to Australia to be rebuilt . 
 There was also a light group , the 3rd Attack Group , equipped with a mixture of Douglas A @-@ 20 Havocs and B @-@ 25 Mitchells . This group was not just short of aircraft ; it was critically short of aircrew as well . To make up the numbers the USAAF turned to the RAAF for help . Australian aircrew were assigned to most of the group ’ s aircraft , serving in every role except aircraft commander . In addition to the RAAF aircrew with the USAAF squadrons , there were RAAF units in the Port Moresby area . No. 30 Squadron RAAF , which had arrived in Port Moresby in September 1942 , was equipped with the Bristol Beaufighter . Both the aircraft and the squadron proved adept at low level attacks . Also in the Port Moresby area were the 35th and 49th Fighter Groups , both equipped with Bell P @-@ 400 , Curtiss P @-@ 40 Warhawk and Lockheed P @-@ 38 Lightning fighters , but only the last were suitable for long range escort missions .

 The Japanese convoy – comprising eight destroyers and eight troop transports with an escort of approximately 100 fighters – assembled and departed from Simpson Harbour in Rabaul on 28 February . During the January operation , a course was followed that hugged the south coast of New Britain . This had made it easy to provide air cover , but being close to the airfields also made it possible for the Allied Air Forces to attack both the convoy and the airfields at the same time . This time , a route was chosen along the north coast , in the hope that the Allies would be deceived into thinking that the convoy ’ s objective was Madang . Allied air attacks on the convoy at this point would have to fly over New Britain , allowing interdiction from Japanese air bases there , but the final leg of the voyage would be particularly dangerous , because the convoy would have to negotiate the restricted waters of the Vitiaz Strait . The Japanese named the convoy " Operation 81 . " 
 The destroyers carried 958 troops while the transports took 5 @,@ 954 . All the ships were combat loaded to expedite unloading at Lae . The commander of the Japanese XVIII Army – Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi – travelled on the destroyer Tokitsukaze , while that of the 51st Division – Lieutenant General Hidemitsu Nakano – was on board the destroyer Yukikaze . The escort commander – Rear Admiral <unk> Kimura of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla – flew his flag from the destroyer Shirayuki . The other five destroyers were Arashio , Asashio , Asagumo , Shikinami and Uranami . They escorted seven Army transports : <unk> Maru ( 2 @,@ 716 gross register tons ) , <unk> Maru ( 950 tons ) , Kyokusei Maru ( 5 @,@ 493 tons ) , <unk> Maru ( 6 @,@ 494 tons ) , Sin @-@ ai Maru ( 3 @,@ 793 tons ) , <unk> Maru ( 2 @,@ 883 tons ) and <unk> Maru ( 6 @,@ 870 tons ) . Rounding out the force was the lone Navy transport Nojima ( 8 @,@ 125 tons ) . All the ships carried troops , equipment and ammunition , except for the <unk> Maru , which carried 1 @,@ 000 drums of avgas and 650 drums of other fuel . 
 The convoy , moving at 7 kn ( 8 @.@ 1 mph ; 13 km / h ) , was not detected for some time , because of two tropical storms that struck the Solomon and Bismarck Seas between 27 February and 1 March , but at about 15 : 00 on 1 March , the crew of a patrolling B @-@ 24 Liberator heavy bomber spotted the convoy . Eight B @-@ 17 Flying Fortresses were sent to the location but failed to locate the ships . 
 At dawn on 2 March , a force of six RAAF A @-@ 20 Bostons attacked Lae to reduce its ability to provide support . At about 10 : 00 , another Liberator found the convoy . Eight B @-@ 17s took off to attack the ships , followed an hour later by another 20 . They found the convoy and attacked with 1 @,@ 000 lb ( 450 kg ) bombs from 5 @,@ 000 ft ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) . They claimed to have sunk up to three merchant ships . Kyokusei Maru had sunk carrying 1 @,@ 200 army troops , and two other transports , <unk> Maru and Nojima , were damaged . Eight Japanese fighters were destroyed and 13 damaged in the day ’ s action . 
 The destroyers Yukikaze and Asagumo plucked 950 survivors of Kyokusei Maru from the water . These two destroyers , being faster than the convoy since its speed was dictated by the slower transports , broke away from the group to disembark the survivors at Lae . The destroyers resumed their escort duties the next day . The convoy – without the troop transport and two destroyers – was attacked again on the evening of 2 March by 11 B @-@ 17s , with minor damage to one transport . During the night , PBY Catalina flying boats from No. 11 Squadron RAAF took over the task of shadowing the convoy . 
 = = = Further attacks = = = 
 By 3 March , the convoy was within range of the air base at Milne Bay , and eight Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers from No. 100 Squadron RAAF took off from there . Because of bad weather only two found the convoy , and neither scored any hits , but the weather cleared after they rounded the Huon Peninsula . A force of 90 Allied aircraft took off from Port Moresby , and headed for Cape Ward Hunt , while 22 A @-@ 20 Bostons of No. 22 Squadron RAAF attacked the Japanese fighter base at Lae , reducing the convoy ’ s air cover . Attacks on the base continued throughout the day . 
 At 10 : 00 , 13 B @-@ 17s reached the convoy and bombed from medium altitude of 7 @,@ 000 feet , causing the ships to maneuver , which dispersed the convoy formation and reduced their concentrated anti @-@ aircraft firepower . The B @-@ 17s attracted a number of Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters , which were in turn attacked by the P @-@ 38 Lightning escorts . A B @-@ 17 broke up in the air , and its crew was forced to take to their parachutes . Japanese fighter pilots machine @-@ gunned some of the B @-@ 17 crew members as they descended and attacked others in the water after they landed . Five of the Japanese fighters strafing the B @-@ 17 aircrew were promptly engaged and shot down by three Lightnings , which were also lost . The Allied fighter pilots claimed 15 Zeros destroyed , while the B @-@ 17 crews claimed five more . Actual Japanese fighter losses for the day were seven destroyed and three damaged . B @-@ 25s arrived shortly afterward and released their 500 @-@ pound bombs between 3 @,@ 000 and 6 @,@ 000 feet , reportedly causing two Japanese vessels to collide . The result of the B @-@ 17 and B @-@ 25 sorties scored few hits but left the convoy ships separated making them vulnerable to strafers and masthead bombers , and with the Japanese anti @-@ aircraft fire being focused on the medium @-@ altitude bombers this left an opening for minimum altitude attacks . 
 The 13 Beaufighters from No. 30 Squadron RAAF approached the convoy at low level to give the impression they were Beauforts making a torpedo attack . The ships turned to face them , the standard procedure to present a smaller target to torpedo bombers , allowing the Beaufighters to maximise the damage they inflicted on the ships ’ anti @-@ aircraft guns , bridges and crews in strafing runs with their four 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) nose cannons and six wing @-@ mounted .303 in ( 7 @.@ 70 mm ) machine guns . On board one of the Beaufighters was cameraman Damien Parer , who shot dramatic footage of the battle . Immediately afterward , seven B @-@ 25s of the 38th Bombardment Group ’ s 71st Bombardment Squadron bombed from about 750 m ( 2 @,@ 460 ft ) , while six from the <unk> Bombardment Squadron attacked at mast height . 
 Shirayuki was the first ship to be hit , by a combination of strafing and bombing attacks . Almost all the men on the bridge became casualties , including Kimura , who was wounded . One bomb hit started a magazine explosion that caused the stern to break off , and the ship to sink . Her crew was transferred to Shikinami , and Shirayuki was scuttled . The destroyer Tokitsukaze was also hit and fatally damaged . Its crew was taken off by Yukikaze . The destroyer Arashio was hit , and collided with the transport Nojima , disabling her . Both the destroyer and the transport were abandoned , and Nojima was later sunk by an air attack . 
 Fourteen B @-@ 25s returned that afternoon , reportedly claiming 17 hits or near misses . By this time , a third of the transports were sunk or sinking . As the Beaufighters and B @-@ 25s had expended their munitions , some USAAF A @-@ 20 Havocs of the 3rd Attack Group joined in . Another five hits were claimed by B @-@ 17s of the 43rd Bombardment Group from higher altitudes . During the afternoon , further attacks from USAAF B @-@ 25s and Bostons of No. 22 Squadron RAAF followed . 
 Garrett Middlebrook , a co @-@ pilot in one of the B @-@ 25s , described the ferocity of the strafing attacks : 
 They went in and hit this troop ship . What I saw looked like little sticks , maybe a foot long or something like that , or splinters flying up off the deck of ship ; they ’ d fly all around ... and twist crazily in the air and fall out in the water . Then I realized what I was watching were human beings . I was watching hundreds of those Japanese just blown off the deck by those machine guns . They just splintered around the air like sticks in a whirlwind and they ’ d fall in the water . 
 All seven of the transports were hit and most were burning or sinking about 100 km ( 54 nmi ; 62 mi ) south east of Finschhafen , along with the destroyers Shirayuki , Tokitsukaze and Arashio . Four of the destroyers – Shikinami , Yukikaze , Uranami and Asagumo – picked up as many survivors as possible and then retired to Rabaul , accompanied by the destroyer Hatsuyuki , which had come from Rabaul to assist . That night , a force of ten U.S. Navy PT boats – under the command of Lieutenant Commander Barry Atkins – set out to attack the convoy . Two boats struck submerged debris and were forced to return . The other eight arrived off Lae in the early hours of 4 March . Atkins spotted a fire that turned out to be the transport <unk> Maru . PT @-@ 143 and PT @-@ 150 fired torpedoes at it , sinking the crippled vessel . In the morning , a fourth destroyer – Asashio – was sunk when a B @-@ 17 hit her with a 500 lb ( 230 kg ) bomb while she was picking up survivors from Arashio . 
 Some 2 @,@ 700 survivors were taken to Rabaul by the destroyers . On 4 March , another 1 @,@ 000 or so survivors were adrift on rafts . On the evenings of 3 – 5 March , PT boats and planes attacked Japanese rescue vessels , as well as the survivors from the sunken vessels on life rafts and swimming or floating in the sea . This was later justified on the grounds that rescued servicemen would have been rapidly landed at their military destination and promptly returned to active service , as well as being retaliation for the Japanese fighter planes attacking survivors of the downed B @-@ 17 bomber . While many of the Allied aircrew accepted these attacks as being necessary , others were sickened . On 6 March , the Japanese submarines I @-@ 17 and I @-@ 26 picked up 170 survivors . Two days later , I @-@ 26 found another 54 and put them ashore at Lae . Hundreds made their way to various islands . One band of 18 survivors landed on Kiriwina , where they were captured by PT @-@ 114 . Another made its way to Guadalcanal , only to be killed by an American patrol . 
 On 4 March the Japanese mounted a retaliatory raid on the Buna airfield , the site of a base that the Allies had captured back in January , though the fighters did little damage . Kenney wrote in his memoir that the Japanese reprisal occurred " after the horse had been stolen from the barn . It was a good thing that the Nip air commander was stupid . Those hundred airplanes would have made our job awfully hard if they had taken part in the big fight over the convoy on March 3rd . " 
 On Goodenough Island , between 8 and 14 March 1943 , Australian patrols from the 47th Infantry Battalion found and killed 72 Japanese , captured 42 and found another nine dead on a raft . One patrol killed eight Japanese who had landed in two flat @-@ bottomed boats , in which were found some documents in sealed tins . On translation by the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section , one document turned out to be a copy of the Japanese Army List , with the names and postings of every officer in the Japanese Army . It therefore provided a complete order of battle of the Japanese Army , including many units that had never before been reported . A mention of any Japanese officer could now be correlated with his unit . Copies were made available to intelligence units in every theatre of war against Japan . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The battle was a disaster for the Japanese . Out of 6 @,@ 900 troops who were badly needed in New Guinea , only about 1 @,@ 200 made it to Lae . Another 2 @,@ 700 were saved by destroyers and submarines and returned to Rabaul . About 2 @,@ 890 Japanese soldiers and sailors were killed . The Allies lost 13 aircrew , 10 of whom were lost in combat while three others died in an accident . There were also eight wounded . Aircraft losses were one B @-@ 17 and three P @-@ 38s in combat , and one B @-@ 25 and one Beaufighter in accidents . MacArthur issued a communiqué on 7 March claiming that 22 ships , including 12 transports , three cruisers and seven destroyers , had been sunk along with 12 @,@ 792 troops . Army Air Force Headquarters in Washington , D.C. looked into the matter in mid @-@ 1943 and concluded that there were only 16 ships involved , but GHQ SWPA elected to stick to its original story . After the war , Kenney would repeat the claim . 
 The Allied Air Forces had used 233 @,@ 847 rounds of ammunition , and dropped 261 500 @-@ pound and 253 thousand @-@ pound bombs . They claimed 19 hits and 42 near misses with the former , and 59 hits and 39 near misses from the latter . Of the 137 bombs dropped in low level attacks , 48 , or 35 percent , were claimed to have hit , but only 29 , or 7 @.@ 5 percent , of the 387 bombs dropped from medium altitude . This compared favourably with efforts in August and September 1942 when only 3 percent of bombs dropped were claimed to have scored hits . It was noted that the high and medium altitude attacks scored few hits but dispersed the convoy , while the strafing runs from the Beaufighters had knocked out many of the ships ' anti @-@ aircraft defences . Aircraft attacking from multiple directions had confused and overwhelmed the Japanese defences , resulting in lower casualties and more accurate bombing . The results therefore vindicated not just the tactics of mast height attack , but of mounting coordinated attacks from multiple directions . The Japanese estimated that at least 29 bombs had hit a ship during the battle . This was a big improvement over the Battle of Wau back in January , when Allied aircraft attacked a Japanese convoy consisting of five destroyers and five troop transports travelling from Rabaul to Lae , but managed to sink just one transport and beach another . 
 There was no doubt that the Japanese had suffered a major defeat . Imamura 's chief of staff flew to Imperial General Headquarters to report on the disaster . It was decided that there would be no more attempts to land troops at Lae . The losses incurred in the Bismarck Sea caused grave concern for the security of Lae and Rabaul . This resulted in a change of strategy . On 25 March a joint Army @-@ Navy Central Agreement on South West Area Operations gave operations in New Guinea priority over those in the Solomon Islands campaign . The XVIII Army was allocated additional shipping , ordnance and anti @-@ aircraft units , which were sent to Wewak or Hansa Bay . Of the defeat , Rabaul staff officer Masatake Okumiya said , " Our losses for this single battle were fantastic . Not during the entire savage fighting at Guadalcanal did we suffer a single comparable blow . We knew we could no longer run cargo ships or even fast destroyer transports to any front on the north coast of New Guinea , east of Wewak . " 
 The planned movement of the 20th Division to Madang was revised in the light of events in the Bismarck Sea . The operation was postponed for two days , and the destination was altered from Madang to Hansa Bay further west . To reduce the Allied air threat , the Allied airfield at Wau was bombed on 9 March , and that at Dobodura on 11 March . Three Allied aircraft were destroyed on the ground , and one P @-@ 40 was lost in the air , but the Allied fighters claimed to have shot down nine Japanese planes . The transports reached Hansa Bay unscathed on 12 March , and the troops made their way down to Madang on foot or in barges . The 20th Division then became involved in an attempt to construct a road from Madang to Lae through the Ramu and Markham Valleys . It toiled on the road for the next few months , but its efforts were ultimately frustrated by New Guinea 's weather and the rugged terrain of the Finisterre Range . 
 Some submarines were made available for supply runs to Lae , but they did not have the capacity to support the troops there by themselves . An operation was carried out on 29 March in which four destroyers successfully delivered 800 troops to Finschhafen , but the growing threat from Allied aircraft led to the development of routes along the coast of New Guinea from Madang to Finschhafen , and along both the north and south coasts of New Britain to Finschhafen , and thence to Lae using Army landing craft . It was by this means that the remainder of the 51st Division finally made the trip to Lae in May . The necessity of delivering troops and supplies to the front in this manner caused immense difficulties for the Japanese in their attempts to halt further Allied advances . After the war , Japanese officers at Rabaul estimated that around 20 @,@ 000 troops were lost in transit to New Guinea from Rabaul , a significant factor in Japan 's ultimate defeat in the New Guinea campaign . 
 In April , Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto used the additional air resources allocated to Rabaul in Operation I @-@ Go , an air offensive designed to redress the situation by destroying Allied ships and aircraft in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands . The operation was indecisive , and Yamamoto himself became a casualty of Allied intelligence and air power in the Solomon Islands later that year .

 A documentary film crew is chronicling a teenager named Kenny ( <unk> Thomas ) with a major facial deformity who opts to undergo a dramatic reconstructive procedure . When Kenny suffers a heart attack just prior to the surgery , House and the team are called in to determine the cause , since the surgery cannot proceed until Kenny 's cardiac condition is diagnosed . 
 As the film crew continues to document Kenny , House becomes increasingly annoyed and tries to avoid them by briefing his team by the MRI machine and in surgery . However , ultimately he cannot escape the cameras and the candidates find themselves acting self @-@ consciously in front of the lens . Meanwhile , House begins to regret recruiting former CIA doctor Samira Terzi ( Michael Michele ) when she fails to demonstrate the intelligence he witnessed at Langley . Wilson , who believes that House is being distracted by Terzi 's looks , offers up the solution to quickly fire her and then ask her out on a date . He also notes House 's propensity to hire attractive women , which led him to this situation . House argues that he 's " not that guy " ; Wilson retorts " every guy is that guy " . During the episode the film crew also interviews Cameron , asking why she resigned and making it look like she was romantically attracted to House . 
 Dr. Taub , using his experience as a plastic surgeon , gains Kenny 's and his father 's trust and frequently clashes with House on the diagnosis . House believes Kenny is suffering juvenile rheumatoid arthritis while Taub believes it is merely the side effects of increased intracranial pressure . By persuading Kenny 's father not to follow House 's treatment and by attempting to kick him off the case , House fires Taub , only to have his decision reversed by Cuddy . Ultimately both House and Taub are proven wrong when Thirteen realizes Kenny is suffering Lyme disease , with the telltale rash hidden by his hair . Incensed by Taub 's actions , House begins to dig into his life , and gets him to confess that he resigned his old position as a plastic surgeon because he was discovered having a secret affair with his nurse . He signed a non @-@ compete agreement with his former partners in exchange for their keeping quiet about the affair , effectively blackballing him out of his area of expertise . 
 In the end Taub is not fired , but Dr. Terzi is let go and House 's request for a date is turned down . Cuddy and House watch an early cut of the documentary , which has been edited to portray House as a compassionate , sympathetic doctor . House is aghast and leaves the room , questioning whether he can still trust Michael Moore movies . The documentary continues , revealing that the surgery was successful , and that Kenny thanks Dr. House .

 The episode was written by Sean Whitesell , who had previously worked as co @-@ executive producer on the series . To date , this is the only House episode Whitesell has written . The episode became the second House episode to be directed by David Straiton , who had previously directed " Family " . " Ugly " featured the second appearance of Dr. Samira Terzi ( Michael Michele ) , who made her first appearance in " Whatever it Takes " . Michele had previously played a doctor named Cleo Finch on the medical drama ER . Omar Epps , who stars in House as Dr. Eric Foreman , also starred on ER , but two years before Michele . As usual , the filming took place on the Fox lot in Century City . This episode contained the song ' My home is your head ' by Joseph Arthur .

 The episode was the eighth most @-@ watched program of the week along with NBC 's Sunday Night Football , with 11 @.@ 4 million viewers , it received a 17 share in the ratings . Overall , the episode was well received by critics . Nina <unk> Smith of TV Guide quoted : " Perhaps the best thing about the episode was the amount of screen time given to old favorites like Wilson ( Robert Sean Leonard ) and Cuddy ( Lisa Edelstein ) . The show 's most convincing writing has always been in the scenes when those two spar with House , and I was thrilled to see more of that " . Most critics were surprised and interested by the performance of Chris Taub in this episode . Richard Keller of TV Squad , wrote that he was almost certain of the fact that Taub was going to be fired and he was glad that he wasn 't . He also quoted , " For some reason I like Taub . Maybe because he 's not pretty like the rest of them . He 's just an everyday <unk> who 's a pretty decent doctor " . 
 Buzz Byrne from Critics rant called Taub , " interesting " . James Chamberlin of IGN did not think that the black and white documentary really worked for him , and when it was over he didn 't feel like he had just watched an episode of House . Chamberlin graded the episode with a 7 @.@ 7 . Michelle Romero , of Entertainment Weekly commented " I loved it when House told his crew that she Dr. Terzi got the gig because she had more experience than the swimsuit model " . Television without Pity graded the episode with a B- ( out of 84 votes ) . According to Glen L. Diaz , of BuddyTV , various fans think that the smile on Cuddy 's face at the end of the episode explains everything about how she thinks of House . Peter Jacobson submitted the episode for a Primetime Emmy Award on his behalf in the category Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series . Sean Whitesell submitted the episode on his behalf in the category Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series . Neither nomination came through . 
 = The Care Bears ' Big Wish Movie = 
 The Care Bears ' Big Wish Movie is a 2005 children 's animated feature film , produced by Nelvana Limited and released by Lions Gate Home Entertainment . Directed by Larry Jacobs and Ron Pitts , and written by Jeffrey Alan Schechter , the film is a follow @-@ up to the Care Bears ' previous efforts in 2004 's Journey to Joke @-@ a @-@ lot . It was the fifth film to feature the Bears , and the second to be computer @-@ animated . 
 The Big Wish Movie centres on Wish Bear , a Care Bear who can make and grant wishes . After some of them do not work , she feels worried that the other bears have overlooked her abilities , and wishes for a few new friends who care more than she does . Those three — Messy Bear , Me Bear and Too Loud Bear — cause further trouble for Wish Bear , her wishing star Twinkers , and all of Care @-@ a @-@ lot . 
 As with Journey to Joke @-@ a @-@ lot , Toronto 's Nelvana produced and self @-@ financed the Big Wish Movie ; additional work was handled by India 's Crest Animation Productions . Production involved various personnel from the previous film , among them Ron Pitts , composer Ian Thomas and various voice actors including Stephanie Beard , Stevie Vallance and Julie Lemieux . The Big Wish Movie was released on DVD by Lions Gate on October 18 , 2005 ; prior to this , it premiered on U.S. and Canadian television , and was accompanied by a tie @-@ in book from Scholastic Press . It subsequently received favourable reviews from Parenting magazine and the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette . This was Nelvana 's final production with the Care Bears , before SD Entertainment of California assumed responsibility for future instalments in the franchise . 
 = = Plot = = 
 This movie starts when , atop the roof of an observatory at their cloud @-@ filled home of Care @-@ a @-@ lot , the Care Bears hear Wish Bear 's story of how she ( as a Cub ) found her new friend , a wishing star named Twinkers . The Care Bears are touched by this tale , but are a bit worried when she uses Twinkers ' inherent power to wish them all some popcorn . Cheer Bear raises concern that this may be a frivolous use of Twinkers ' power . Wish Bear , however , assures everyone that she is a trained professional . 
 The next day , Wish Bear uses the wishing power to help her friends . She wishes for plenty of rainbow sap for Share Bear , and for Grumpy Bear 's rocket to have " zoom " , but the wishes backfire when the sap overflows and the rocket spins out of control . 
 A monthly meeting of Care @-@ a @-@ lot 's steering committee ( with Champ Bear presiding ) reveals a problem with the Caring Meter . The machine , which measures how much caring there is in Care @-@ a @-@ lot , has moved towards the <unk> side . Wish Bear suggests using her wishes , but is rejected since not all of them work as intended ; they didn 't like their wishes ( " I Wish " ) . Disappointed , she decides to wish for other bears who like wishing as much as she does . This causes three new bears to arrive in Care @-@ a @-@ lot : Me Bear , Messy Bear , and Too Loud Bear . 
 Everyone is pleased to welcome the new neighbours at first , but things soon get out of control . The new bears unwittingly make a huge mess of everything ( especially when the huge mansion they asked for causes pollution ) . Then , after a confrontation with them at a picnic ( " Get a Lot " ) Wish Bear accidentally wishes Twinkers away to the new bears ; they soon abuse the star 's power with an amusement park focusing on Me Bear , a mud pie for Messy Bear , and a huge noisy motorcycle for Too Loud Bear . Once the new bears finally realise their problem , they try to fix it with more wishes , but to no avail — Care @-@ a @-@ lot becomes a blank white space ( wishing that all of this was gone ) , the bears begin to glow in color ( wishing for everything to be back how it was , but with more color ) , Grumpy Bear turns black and white ( wishing for less color ) , and Messy Bear turns into Messy Cub ( wishing for everything to be like it used to be ) . When they try to wish Twinkers back to Wish Bear , the star ultimately loses his power from exhaustion ( because they had been pushing him much too hard ) . Wish Bear uses Grumpy Bear 's rocket to bring him to the Big Wish , a grandmother star , in the sky . Big Wish restores his power , but not before Wish Bear assures her that she has learned her lesson , which is wishing is fun , but it is far more important to work hard to achieve your dreams . 
 Wish Bear tells them that wishes are not an effective solution any more , and everyone works together to make their home beautiful again ( " It Takes You and Me " ) . In the end , Me Bear , Messy Bear , and Too Loud Bear , having seen the error of their ways , apologize and ask if they can still live in Care @-@ a @-@ lot . The rest of the bears agree , and decide to go on a road trip , and the movie ends .

 The Care Bears ' Big Wish Movie first aired on Canadian television on October 3 , 2005 ; in the United States , it premiered on cable television 's Disney Channel on October 17 . The day after the U.S. premiere , it became one of Lions Gate Home Entertainment 's five direct @-@ to @-@ DVD " marquee " offerings for young viewers ; restaurant chain Burger King served as the promotional partner . Twice during 2005 , Stephanie Beard ( the voice of Wish Bear ) promoted the film in the Toronto Star under the alias Suga <unk> ; in October , she proclaimed that it " is going to be a classic " . The film charted on Video Business ' Top Kids Rentals list for January 23 , 2006 , where it ranked 20th . On August 11 , 2007 , it placed seventh on Billboard 's Top Kid DVD Sales chart . Jeffrey Alan Schechter , the film 's writer , was nominated for a Writers Guild of Canada Award . The film is known under two French @-@ language titles : À vos <unk> les <unk> ! ( in Canada 's Quebec province ) and De Nouveaux <unk> chez les Bisounours ( in France ) . 
 Days before the release of the Big Wish Movie , Scholastic Press published a Care Bears storybook based on the film ; it was written by Sonia Sander and illustrated by Jay Johnson . One scene in the book involves Wish Bear and the three new Bears grocery shopping ; this does not appear in the film . Later in the book , when Messy Bear wishes for everything to be like it used to be , it causes the Bears to travel back to the age of the dinosaurs ; in the film , Twinkers just turns Messy Bear into Messy Cub . 
 Bruce Kluger of Parenting magazine referred to the Big Wish Movie as " Cute stuff , if a tad sticky @-@ sweet : Heart @-@ shaped toothbrushes , toasters , and waffles abound . " Cristina <unk> of the Pittsburgh Post @-@ Gazette gave it three stars out of four , and said that " Young Care Bear fanatics will wish for more . " In April 2010 's Journal of Aging Studies , Sylvia <unk> commented that Big Wish , the grandmother star , served as " a poor substitute for a truly three @-@ dimensional maternal figure " .

 = International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry = 
 The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( IUPAC , / <unk> / or / <unk> / ) is an international federation of National Adhering Organizations that represents chemists in individual countries . It is a member of the International Council for Science ( <unk> ) . The international headquarters of IUPAC is in Zürich , Switzerland . The administrative office , known as the " IUPAC Secretariat " , is in Research Triangle Park , North Carolina , United States . This administrative office is headed by IUPAC 's executive director , currently Lynn <unk> . 
 IUPAC was established in 1919 as the successor of the International Congress of Applied Chemistry for the advancement of chemistry . Its members , the National Adhering Organizations , can be national chemistry societies , national academies of sciences , or other bodies representing chemists . There are fifty @-@ four National Adhering Organizations and three Associate National Adhering Organizations . IUPAC 's Inter @-@ divisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols ( IUPAC nomenclature ) is the recognized world authority in developing standards for the naming of the chemical elements and compounds . Since its creation , IUPAC has been run by many different committees with different responsibilities . These committees run different projects which include standardizing nomenclature , finding ways to bring chemistry to the world , and publishing works . 
 IUPAC is best known for its works standardizing nomenclature in chemistry and other fields of science , but IUPAC has publications in many fields including chemistry , biology and physics . Some important work IUPAC has done in these fields includes standardizing nucleotide base sequence code names ; publishing books for environmental scientists , chemists , and physicists ; and improving education in science . IUPAC is also known for standardizing the atomic weights of the elements through one of its oldest standing committees , the Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights . 
 = = Creation and history = = 
 The need for an international standard for chemistry was first addressed in 1860 by a committee headed by German scientist Friedrich August Kekulé von <unk> . This committee was the first international conference to create an international naming system for organic compounds . The ideas that were formulated in that conference evolved into the official IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry . IUPAC stands as a legacy of this meeting , making it one of the most important historical international collaborations of chemistry societies . Since this time , IUPAC has been the official organization held with the responsibility of updating and maintaining official organic nomenclature . IUPAC as such was established in 1919 . One notable country excluded from this early IUPAC is Germany . Germany 's exclusion was a result of prejudice towards Germans by the Allied powers after World War I. Germany was finally admitted into IUPAC during 1929 . However , Nazi Germany was removed from IUPAC during World War II . 
 During World War II , IUPAC was affiliated with the Allied powers , but had little involvement during the war effort itself . After the war , East and West Germany were eventually readmitted to IUPAC . Since World War II , IUPAC has been focused on standardizing nomenclature and methods in science without interruption . 
 = = Committees and governance = = 
 IUPAC is governed by several committees that all have different responsibilities . The committees are as follows : Bureau , <unk> ( Chem Research Applied to World Needs ) Committee , Committee on Chemistry Education , Committee on Chemistry and Industry , Committee on Printed and Electronic Publications , Evaluation Committee , Executive Committee , Finance Committee , <unk> Committee on Terminology , Nomenclature and Symbols , Project Committee , and Pure and Applied Chemistry Editorial Advisory Board . Each committee is made up of members of different National Adhering Organizations from different countries . 
 The steering committee hierarchy for IUPAC is as follows : 
 All committees have an allotted budget to which they must adhere . 
 Any committee may start a project . 
 If a project 's spending becomes too much for a committee to continue funding , it must take the issue to the Project Committee . 
 The project committee either increases the budget or decides on an external funding plan . 
 The Bureau and Executive Committee oversee operations of the other committees 
 = = Nomenclature = = 
 IUPAC committee has a long history of officially naming organic and inorganic compounds . IUPAC nomenclature is developed so that any compound can be named under one set of standardized rules to avoid duplicate names . The first publication , which is information from the International Congress of Applied Chemistry , on IUPAC nomenclature of organic compounds , can be found from the early 20th century in A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds ( 1900 ) . 
 = = = Organic nomenclature = = = 
 IUPAC organic nomenclature has three basic parts : the substituents , carbon chain length and chemical ending . The substituents are any functional groups attached to the main carbon chain . The main carbon chain is the longest possible continuous chain . The chemical ending denotes what type of molecule it is . For example , the ending ane denotes a single bonded carbon chain , as in " hexane " ( C 
 6H 
 14 ) . 
 Another example of IUPAC organic nomenclature is <unk> : 
 The substituent name for a ring compound is <unk> . 
 The indication ( substituent name ) for a six carbon chain is hex . 
 The chemical ending for a single bonded carbon chain is ane 
 The chemical ending for an alcohol is ol 
 The two chemical endings are combined for an ending of <unk> indicating a single bonded carbon chain with an alcohol attached to it . 
 = = = Inorganic nomenclature = = = 
 Basic IUPAC inorganic nomenclature has two main parts : the cation and the anion . The cation is the name for the positively charged ion and the anion is the name for the negatively charged ion . 
 An example of IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry is potassium chlorate ( <unk> ) : 
 " Potassium " is the cation name . 
 " <unk> " is the anion name . 
 = = Amino acid and nucleotide base codes = = 
 IUPAC also has a system for giving codes to identify amino acids and nucleotide bases . IUPAC needed a coding system that represented long sequences of amino acids . This would allow for these sequences to be compared to try to find homologies . These codes can consist of either a one letter code or a three letter code . 
 These codes make it easier and shorter to write down the amino acid sequences that make up proteins . The nucleotide bases are made up of purines ( adenine and guanine ) and pyrimidines ( cytosine and thymine or uracil ) . These nucleotide bases make up DNA and RNA . These nucleotide base codes make the genome of an organism much smaller and easier to read . 
 The codes for amino acids ( 24 amino acids and three special codes ) are :

 IUPAC color code their books in order to make each publication distinguishable .

 IUPAC and UNESCO were the lead organizations coordinating events for the International Year of Chemistry , which took place in 2011 . The International Year of Chemistry was originally proposed by IUPAC at the general assembly in Turin , Italy . This motion was adopted by UNESCO at a meeting in 2008 . The main objectives of the International Year of Chemistry were to increase public appreciation of chemistry and gain more interest in the world of chemistry . This event is also being held to encourage young people to get involved and contribute to chemistry . A further reason for this event being held is to honour how chemistry has made improvements to everyone 's way of life . 
 = William the Silent ( statue ) = 
 A bronze statue of William the Silent ( also known as Willie the Silent and Still Bill ) was installed in 1928 on the Voorhees Mall section of Rutgers University 's College Avenue Campus in New Brunswick , New Jersey . It is located along Seminary Place , a street at the western end of the Voorhees Mall , and is near several academic buildings , including the university 's Graduate School of Education , Van Dyke Hall , and Milledoler Hall . 
 The statue was donated to Rutgers by Dr. Fenton B. Turck to commemorate the university 's Dutch heritage . Turck , with the assistance of railroad executive and Rutgers alumnus Leonor F. Loree , collaborated to arrange the anonymous donation of the statue through the Holland Society of New York . It is a statue of William I , Prince of Orange ( 1533 @-@ 1584 ) , an early leader of the Dutch revolt against Habsburg Spain which led to the independence of the Netherlands in 1648 . The statue has continued to be included in student life as the Voorhees Mall was used as the site of student and community events , including graduation ceremonies , pep rallies , festivals , and protests . Occasionally , the statue is a target of vandalism in an ongoing historical rivalry between students of Rutgers and Princeton University . The statue was restored in 2006 in an effort funded by alumni donations .

 = = = Acquisition and installation = = = 
 While travelling in Europe after World War I , biologist and physician Dr. Fenton Benedict Turck ( 1857 – 1932 ) purchased a bronze statue of William I ( 1533 – 1584 ) , Count of Nassau , Prince of Orange , and national hero of the Netherlands . William , known as " William the Silent " ( Dutch : Willem de <unk> ) and " William of Orange " ( Dutch : Willem van Oranje ) , was the main leader of the Dutch revolt against the Spanish that set off the Eighty Years ' War and resulted in the formal independence of the United Provinces in 1648 . For this reason , William is known as the " Father of the Fatherland " ( Dutch : Vader des <unk> ) of the Netherlands . The statue is a replica of a similar monument created in 1848 by Dutch sculptor <unk> Royer ( 1793 – 1868 ) that was installed in Het Plein , a city square in the Hague 's Oude Centrum ( trans . " Old Center " ) . The plaster mold for Royer ’ s original statue was kept in Brussels during World War I and after the war , the Dutch government permitted one copy of the statue to be made by sculptor Toon Dupuis ( 1877 – 1937 ) at the Fonderie Nationale des Bronzes , a foundry in Brussels , before destroying the mold . 
 A graduate of Chicago 's Northwestern University Medical School , Turck was an internist , medical researcher in cell biology , inventor of <unk> serum , and author of The Action of the Living Cell ( 1933 ) as well as many tracts on gastrointestinal diseases . Turck was a direct descendant of Dr. <unk> Turck , a sixteenth @-@ century Dutch physician who treated William the Silent after he received severe wounds in a 1581 assassination attempt . During his return voyage to the United States , Turck " began to feel guilty about the great cost of the statue " and decided to keep the purchase hidden from his wife by storing the statue in the basement of his New York City laboratory at 428 Lafayette Street in Lower Manhattan . It remained in Turck 's possession , stored in the laboratory basement , for eight years ( 1920 – 1928 ) . 
 Turck had become a member of the Holland Society of New York in 1917 and was active in their events and affairs . As early as 1887 , the Holland Society had sought to install a prominent monument in New York City to celebrate the city ’ s Dutch heritage . The society agreed on William the Silent as the monument 's subject in 1892 and was urged to install the monument in the city 's Central Park . In the following years , the society considered commissioning the work from prominent American sculptors Augustus Saint @-@ Gaudens ( 1848 – 1907 ) and Daniel Chester French ( 1850 – 1931 ) . In 1913 , Tunis Bergen , a physician chairing the Holland Society 's committee investigating options for a monument , visited the Netherlands and enquired whether a copy of the Royer 's statue in the Hague could be made and took measurements and photographs of the work . Subsequently , World War I delayed the society 's plans . Throughout the 1920s , the Holland Society had proposed to install Turck 's statue in several locations in New York City , in Albany , New York , and other locations along the Hudson Valley . 
 In 1924 , the Holland Society of New York renewed its efforts to install a monument in a prominent location in New York City 's Central Park . The proposal was initially accepted by city Parks Commissioner Francis Dawson Gallatin ( 1870 @-@ 1933 ) , but opposed by the city 's Art Commission . The Art Commission 's assistant secretary H. R. Marshall recommended that the statue be donated to Rutgers College as they recently installed a new college president , John Martin Thomas , adding that it would be a " nice new and very visible gift , tying the university to its Dutch legacy at the height of the fashion for colonial revivals " . While Turck was having dinner with his close friend , railroad executive Leonor Fresnel Loree ( 1858 – 1940 ) discussed the Dutch roots of Rutgers University , his alma mater , and convinced Turck to donate the statue to the university . At the time , Loree was serving on the college 's board of trustees . Rutgers , chartered in 1766 as Queen 's College was the eighth of nine colleges established before the American Revolution and had been founded by Dutch Reformed clergymen from New York and New Jersey . After its founding , the college was affiliated with the church through the early nineteenth century , and graduated many students of Dutch ancestry . Turck desired to donate the statue anonymously , and with Loree 's assistance , arranged for the Holland Society to transfer the statue to Rutgers . Bergen , now a Rutgers trustee in addition to continuing his efforts as chairman of the Holland Society 's statue committee , said that it was " particularly fitting that the statue should stand on the grounds of the educational institution founded by descendants of the Netherlands . " The statue was delivered and installed at Rutgers at the western end of the Voorhees Mall . It was dedicated during a ceremony held on June 9 , 1928 . 
 = = = Involvement in campus life = = = 
 Rutgers students affectionately call the statue " Willie the Silent " and " Still Bill . " According to student tradition , the statue is expected to whistle should a virgin happen to walk by . However , Rutgers American studies professor and folklorist Angus Kress Gillespie remarked " But over the last 200 years , he hasn 't yet whistled . " Nevertheless , the statue has continued to be included in student life as the Voorhees Mall was used as the site of student and community events , graduation ceremonies ( until 2007 ) , pep rallies for the football team and other athletic teams , Dutch @-@ American festivals , as well as protests including anti @-@ war protests and strike rallies in the 1970s . On the afternoon of October 11 , 1976 , United States Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts held a campaign rally at Rutgers during the presidential election of 1976 . Kennedy addressed a crowd of approximately 1 @,@ 000 students the Voorhees Mall in front of the statue of William the Silent . Before Kennedy began his speech he " had to quell boos and heckling by some students holding anti @-@ Kennedy signs . " 
 Occasionally , the statue is a target of vandalism in ongoing historical rivalry between students of Rutgers and Princeton University . This rivalry which dates to the two schools playing the first intercollegiate football game in New Brunswick in 1869 and an escalating series of pranks and thefts " under the cover of night " including the theft of a cannon on the Princeton campus in 1875 that became known as the Rutgers – Princeton Cannon War . Over the years , Princeton students have frequently doused the William the Silent statue with orange paint , usually in advance of athletic events . On October 11 , 1947 , before the annual football game between the two schools , " in the early hours of the morning a group of Tigers ( i.e. Princeton students ) infiltrated the Rutgers campus and painted the statue of William the Silent " . In 2006 , Rutgers police officers chased several vandals from the site , allegedly Princeton students , who had painted a large penis and the word " Princeton " several times on the statue . 
 The statue was restored in 2006 with funds donated by the university 's alumni from the Class of 1956 . Approximately $ 150 @,@ 000 in reunion campaign funds were used to restore the four historic gates on the university 's historic Queens Campus and the William the Silent statue . It was cleaned to remove the effects of graffiti and transparent tape residue , and conservation efforts were needed to restore the statue 's bronze casting and granite base .

 In 1928 , the statue of William the Silent was installed at the western end of Voorhees Mall , a section of academic buildings on the College Avenue Campus in New Brunswick . It is located along Seminary Place , a city street that flanks the western side of the Mall , and separates the Rutgers campus from that of the New Brunswick Theological Seminary . The statue is placed near several academic buildings , including the university 's Graduate School of Education , Van Dyke Hall , and Milledoler Hall . 
 According to the Smithsonian Institution 's Art Inventories Catalog , the bronze sculpture is approximately 15 feet in height and installed on a square stone base approximately 6 feet in height . It is recorded as weighing 2 @,@ 000 pounds . The sculpture depicts William the Silent standing : 
 " ... with his proper right hand raised to his chest , pointing with his index finger . He holds an open scroll with his proper left hand . A small dog sits at his feet on his proper right . William the Silent wears the clothes of a civilian magistrate of the 16th century . He has a moustache and a beard , and he wears a ruffled collar , an open ankle @-@ length coat , a buttoned vest , and bloomers . The sculpture is mounted on a square base . " 
 Each of the four side of the statue 's square base is inscribed with incised letters : 
 Front : ( facing east ) : WILLIAM THE <unk> / COUNT OF <unk> / <unk> OF ORANGE / <unk> <unk>

 = M @-@ derived filter = 
 Parts of this article or section rely on the reader 's knowledge of the complex impedance representation of capacitors and inductors and on knowledge of the frequency domain representation of signals . 
 m @-@ derived filters or m @-@ type filters are a type of electronic filter designed using the image method . They were invented by Otto Zobel in the early 1920s . This filter type was originally intended for use with telephone multiplexing and was an improvement on the existing constant k type filter . The main problem being addressed was the need to achieve a better match of the filter into the terminating impedances . In general , all filters designed by the image method fail to give an exact match , but the m @-@ type filter is a big improvement with suitable choice of the parameter m . The m @-@ type filter section has a further advantage in that there is a rapid transition from the cut @-@ off frequency of the pass band to a pole of attenuation just inside the stop band . Despite these advantages , there is a drawback with m @-@ type filters ; at frequencies past the pole of attenuation , the response starts to rise again , and m @-@ types have poor stop band rejection . For this reason , filters designed using m @-@ type sections are often designed as composite filters with a mixture of k @-@ type and m @-@ type sections and different values of m at different points to get the optimum performance from both types .

 Zobel patented an impedance matching network in 1920 which , in essence , used the topology of what are now called m @-@ type filters , but Zobel did not name them as such or analyse them by the image method . This pre @-@ dated George Campbell 's publication of his constant k @-@ type design in 1922 on which the m @-@ type filter is based . Zobel published the image analysis theory of m @-@ type filters in 1923 . Once popular , M @-@ type filters and image parameter designed filters in general are now rarely designed , having been superseded by more advanced network synthesis methods . 
 = = Derivation = = 
 The building block of m @-@ derived filters , as with all image impedance filters , is the " L " network , called a half @-@ section and composed of a series impedance Z , and a shunt admittance Y. The m @-@ derived filter is a derivative of the constant k filter . The starting point of the design is the values of Z and Y derived from the constant k prototype and are given by 
 <formula> 
 where k is the nominal impedance of the filter , or R0 . The designer now multiplies Z and Y by an arbitrary constant m ( 0 < m < 1 ) . There are two different kinds of m @-@ derived section ; series and shunt . To obtain the m @-@ derived series half section , the designer determines the impedance that must be added to 1 / <unk> to make the image impedance ZiT the same as the image impedance of the original constant k section . From the general formula for image impedance , the additional impedance required can be shown to be 
 <formula> 
 To obtain the m @-@ derived shunt half section , an admittance is added to 1 / <unk> to make the image impedance ZiΠ the same as the image impedance of the original half section . The additional admittance required can be shown to be 
 <formula> 
 The general arrangements of these circuits are shown in the diagrams to the right along with a specific example of a low pass section . 
 A consequence of this design is that the m @-@ derived half section will match a k @-@ type section on one side only . Also , an m @-@ type section of one value of m will not match another m @-@ type section of another value of m except on the sides which offer the Zi of the k @-@ type . 
 = = = Operating frequency = = = 
 For the low @-@ pass half section shown , the cut @-@ off frequency of the m @-@ type is the same as the k @-@ type and is given by 
 <formula> 
 The pole of attenuation occurs at ; 
 <formula> 
 From this it is clear that smaller values of m will produce <formula> closer to the cut @-@ off frequency <formula> and hence will have a sharper cut @-@ off . Despite this cut @-@ off , it also brings the unwanted stop band response of the m @-@ type closer to the cut @-@ off frequency , making it more difficult for this to be filtered with subsequent sections . The value of m chosen is usually a compromise between these conflicting requirements . There is also a practical limit to how small m can be made due to the inherent resistance of the inductors . This has the effect of causing the pole of attenuation to be less deep ( that is , it is no longer a genuinely infinite pole ) and the slope of cut @-@ off to be less steep . This effect becomes more marked as <formula> is brought closer to <formula> , and there ceases to be any improvement in response with an m of about 0 @.@ 2 or less . 
 = = = Image impedance = = = 
 The following expressions for image impedances are all referenced to the low @-@ pass prototype section . They are scaled to the nominal impedance R0 
 = 1 , and the frequencies in those expressions are all scaled to the cut @-@ off frequency ωc = 
 1 . 
 = = = = Series sections = = = = 
 The image impedances of the series section are given by 
 <formula> 
 and is the same as that of the constant k section 
 <formula> 
 = = = = Shunt sections = = = = 
 The image impedances of the shunt section are given by 
 <formula> 
 and is the same as that of the constant k section 
 <formula> 
 As with the k @-@ type section , the image impedance of the m @-@ type low @-@ pass section is purely real below the cut @-@ off frequency and purely imaginary above it . From the chart it can be seen that in the passband the closest impedance match to a constant pure resistance termination occurs at approximately m = 0 @.@ 6 . 
 = = = Transmission parameters = = = 
 For an m @-@ derived section in general the transmission parameters for a half @-@ section are given by 
 <formula> 
 and for n half @-@ sections 
 <formula> 
 For the particular example of the low @-@ pass L section , the transmission parameters solve differently in three frequency bands . 
 For <formula> the transmission is lossless : 
 <formula> 
 For <formula> the transmission parameters are 
 <formula> 
 For <formula> the transmission parameters are 
 <formula> 
 = = = Prototype transformations = = = 
 The plots shown of image impedance , attenuation and phase change are the plots of a low @-@ pass prototype filter section . The prototype has a cut @-@ off frequency of ωc 
 = 1 rad / s and a nominal impedance R0 = 
 1 Ω . This is produced by a filter half @-@ section where L 
 = 1 henry and C = 
 1 farad . This prototype can be impedance scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values . The low @-@ pass prototype can also be transformed into high @-@ pass , band @-@ pass or band @-@ stop types by application of suitable frequency transformations . 
 = = Cascading sections = = 
 Several L half @-@ sections may be cascaded to form a composite filter . Like impedance must always face like in these combinations . There are therefore two circuits that can be formed with two identical L half @-@ sections . Where ZiT faces ZiT , the section is called a Π section . Where ZiΠ faces ZiΠ the section formed is a T section . Further additions of half @-@ sections to either of these forms a ladder network which may start and end with series or shunt elements . 
 It should be born in mind that the characteristics of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image impedance . This is usually not true of the sections at either end which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance . The further the section is from the end of the filter , the more accurate the prediction will become since the effects of the terminating impedances are masked by the intervening sections . It is usual to provide half half @-@ sections at the ends of the filter with m = 0 @.@ 6 as this value gives the flattest Zi in the passband and hence the best match in to a resistive termination .

 The Stanley Clarke Band is an album by jazz bassist Stanley Clarke . It was released by Heads Up Record in June 2010 and was produced by Clarke and Lenny White . Band members include Ruslan Sirota on keyboard , Ronald Bruner , Jr. on drums and Hiromi on piano . The album was awarded the 2011 Grammy for Best Contemporary Jazz Album and the track " No Mystery " was nominated for Best Pop Instrumental Performance . The Guardian gave the album three stars , calling it a " return to a funk repertoire reminiscent of Clarke 's roots in Chick Corea electric bands " , while Allmusic gave it a score of three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars . It is also the second Stanley Clarke album to be credited to The Stanley Clarke Band after his 1985 album Find Out ! .

 A core trio is constant throughout the album with Clarke joined by drummer Ronald Bruner , Jr. and keyboardist Ruslan Sirota . Hiromi is billed as a featured artist playing piano on " No Mystery " , " Larry Has Traveled 11 Miles and Waited a Lifetime for the Return of Vishnu ’ s Report " and her composition " Labyrinth " . Several additional musicians appear on most tracks . 
 Clarke , in discussing the band has said that " our common thread is improvisation " . Keyboardist Ruslan Sirota is from Israel , Clarke has compared him to Chick Corea and George Duke . Pianist Hiromi is from Japan , Clarke has said that she " plays the piano like a tornado " . Hiromi also played on Clarke 's 2009 album Jazz in the Garden . Clarke referred to drummer Ronald Bruner , from Compton , California , as " one of the most important drummers out there " . Bruner and Sirota had been playing with Clarke for five years or so before the album 's release . 
 The additional musicians include two guitarists Charles <unk> and Rob Bacon , bassist Armand Sabal @-@ Lecco on " Fulani " , keyboardist Felton Pilate on " Here 's Why Tears Dry " , saxophonists Bob Sheppard on " Larry Has Traveled 11 Miles and Waited a Lifetime for the Return of Vishnu ’ s Report " .

 In describing the album , Clarke said , " Technically , it 's a Stanley Clarke record , but it 's very much a band @-@ oriented record at the same time " . Comparing the album to a ship , he said , " I 'd be the one steering the ship and keeping everybody on course . But all hands were definitely on deck , and everyone played an important role in getting us to our destination " . Clarke has said that this will be his last electric album for a while . Clarke co @-@ produced the album with Lenny White who played drums on Clarke 's 2009 album Jazz in the Garden .

 " Soldier " , Ruslan Sirota 's compositional contribution to the album , includes a piano solo with elements borrowed from McCoy Tyner and Herbie Hancock . It was called " <unk> " by music critic John Fordham . The track " Fulani " was written by Armand Sabal @-@ Lecco and is " Africa @-@ inspired " and " has a crunching rock feel " . 
 Talking about the track " Here 's Why Tears Dry " Clarke said , " The tune came about when a family member was ending a long @-@ time love affair . There were a lot of tears , so I came up with that song . The tears evaporate into thin air , and the pain eventually goes away . " " I Wanna Play for You Too " was written by Felton Pilate who plays keyboards on the track . 
 " Bass Folk Song No. 10 " and the album 's closing track , " Bass Folk Song No. 6 " are both bass solo performances that Clarke wrote many years before they were recorded here . " No Mystery " is a reworking of the song written by Chick Corea when he and Clarke were bandmates in Return to Forever . 
 " How Is the Weather Up There ? " was written by Clarke and Ronald Bruner , Jr . , and deals with global warming . The song was built around comments left by his fans in response to a post on Clarke 's Facebook page asking for thoughts on global warming . 
 " Larry Has Traveled 11 Miles and Waited a Lifetime for the Return of Vishnu ’ s Report " pays homage in its name and musical stylings to Larry Coryell 's The Eleventh House , Miles Davis , Mahavishnu Orchestra , The Tony Williams Lifetime , Return to Forever , and Weather Report , all jazz fusion pioneers . 
 " Labyrinth " was composed by Hiromi and contains elements from " My Favorite Things " with a " funky touch " . " Sonny Rollins " is a Caribbean flavored tribute to saxophonist Sonny Rollins featuring Bob Sheppard on tenor sax and vocals by Cheryl Bentyne .

 John Fordham of The Guardian called the album a " return to a funk repertoire reminiscent of Clarke 's roots in Chick Corea electric bands " . He goes on to call it " more than just a box @-@ ticking piece of jazz @-@ funk commercialism " but laments " Clarke could probably play a lot of this kind of thing in his sleep " . William R. Wood wrote in the Kalamazoo Gazette that " Clarke ’ s complex bass work is invigorating as he blends jazz , rock and funk " . 
 Thom Jurek of Allmusic wrote that the album " feels more like a band record than anything [ Clarke has ] done in decades " . He praises Clarke 's choice in bandmates , calling them " prodigies in their own right " but does not praise the whole album . He called " Larry Has Traveled 11 Miles and Waited a Lifetime for the Return of Vishnu 's Report " a " clumsy , failed attempt at summing up the music 's history to date " and that " Bass Folk Song No. 6 " does not " work [ as ] well " as some of the other tracks but " these are minor complaints on an otherwise fine recording " . Jeff Winbush of All About Jazz commented that there " are no radical departures " on this album and it sounds as if Clarke is " taking a victory lap here , revisiting past triumphs " but that he " still pull [ s ] sounds out of his assortment of electric , acoustic and Alembic basses like nobody else , and [ is ] still slapping , plucking and thumbing his way through contemporary , fusion jazz , rock , funk and whatever else he puts his mind to " .

 = Climate Change Denial : Heads in the Sand = 
 Climate Change Denial : Heads in the Sand is a non @-@ fiction book about climate change denial , coauthored by Haydn Washington and John Cook , with a foreword by Naomi Oreskes . Washington had a background in environmental science prior to authoring the work , and Cook was educated in physics and founded the website Skeptical Science which compiles peer @-@ reviewed evidence of global warming . The book was first published in hardcover and paperback formats in 2011 by Earthscan , a division of Routledge . 
 The book presents an in @-@ depth analysis and refutation of climate change denial , going over several arguments point @-@ by @-@ point and disproving them with peer @-@ reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus for climate change . The authors assert that those denying climate change engage in tactics including cherry picking data purported to support their specific viewpoints , and attacking the integrity of climate scientists . They use social science theory to examine the phenomenon of climate change denial in the wider public , and call this phenomenon a form of pathology . 
 The book traces financial support for climate change denial to the fossil fuel industry , asserting these companies have attempted to influence public opinion on the matter . Washington and Cook write that politicians have a tendency to use weasel words as part of a propaganda tactic through use of spin , as a way to deflect public interest away from climate change and remain passive on the issue . The authors conclude that if the public ceased engaging in denial , the problem of climate change could be realistically addressed . 
 For his research on the book , and efforts in communicating the essence of climate change science to the general public , John Cook won the 2011 Australian Museum Eureka Prize for Advancement of Climate Change Knowledge . Climate Change Denial received a positive reception in reviews from publications including : The Ecologist , <unk> magazine , academic journal Natures Sciences Sociétés , the journal Education published by the New South Wales Teachers Federation , . An article in The New American was critical , describing the labels of " deniers " and " <unk> " as cruel and forms of character assassination .

 The book was coauthored by Australian environmental science researchers Haydn Washington and John Cook . Washington worked for over 30 years as an environmental scientist prior to writing the book . His previously published books on the subject of environmental science include : <unk> ( 1991 ) , A Sense of Wonder ( 2002 ) , and The Wilderness Knot ( 2009 ) . In 2015 , Washington was a Visiting Fellow with the Institute of Environmental Studies at the University of New South Wales . 
 Cook 's education includes a background in physics . Prior to his work on the book , Cook founded the website Skeptical Science , which compiles peer @-@ reviewed evidence of climate change . He placed on the site the most common assertions made by individuals arguing against the scientific consensus for climate change , with evidence to refute each point they made . After the publication of Climate Change Denial : Heads in the Sand , Cook coauthored another book on the subject , Climate Change Science : A Modern Synthesis : Volume 1 – The Physical Climate ( 2013 ) . In 2015 , Cook served as the climate communication fellow at the University of Queensland . 
 Climate Change Denial : Heads in the Sand was first published in 2011 by Earthscan , a division of Routledge . Both hardcover and paperback editions were released in April 2011 . It was released the same year by the publisher in an electronic book format . A second eBook release was published by Routledge in 2012 . The book was made available via Kindle by Amazon.com in May 2013 .

 Climate Change Denial : Heads in the Sand presents a detailed analysis and refutation of climate change denial . In her foreword to the book , Naomi Oreskes writes that people fall victim to the phenomenon of denial due to feeling frightened . The book examines several arguments against global warming , and uses peer @-@ reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus to back @-@ up rationale for disputing the validity of each argument . The methodology of those denying climate change is assessed , including : cherry picking data purporting to support their specific viewpoints , maintaining a high bar for evidence of climate change by those denying it , and criticism of the values of climate scientists themselves . The book puts forth an explanation why certain individuals , and the wider public , have a tendency to deny the scientific consensus for climate change . 
 The authors discuss the broader concept of denial using social science theory , noting its occurrence appears in society when individuals are frightened or ashamed of their actions . They write that these motivations , when expanded from an individual to wider society , present themselves as a form of disease . The book identifies climate change denial itself as a pathology afflicting the culture of the planet . The authors lament that an inverse relationship exists between an increasing scientific consensus regarding climate change , and a simultaneous increase in denial within the greater public about the same issue . 
 The book identifies a corporate underpinning influencing public opinion by way of companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry . Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words as a form of spin and propaganda , in order to act as if they are going to do something about climate change , while in actuality remaining passive on the issue . The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial — within the wider public itself . They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus . The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change , the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed .

 The book 's coauthor John Cook won the 2011 Eureka Prize for Advancement of Climate Change Knowledge , awarded by the New South Wales Government as part of the Australian Museum Eureka Prizes , and was honoured for his role in communicating the essence of climate change science to the general public . Director of the University of Queensland Global Change Institute , Professor Ove Hoegh @-@ Guldberg , cited Cook 's research and authorship of Climate Change Denial : Heads in the Sand as the rationale behind him winning the award . 
 The Ecologist reviewed the book and described it as : " well researched and painstakingly footnoted " . The review concluded : Climate Change Denial is a wise and timely book . ... It deserves an audience " . Writing for <unk> magazine , Mary @-@ Lou Considine wrote that the book " dissects objections to the peer @-@ reviewed science " in " forensic detail " . Considine recommended the book for those who had previously visited the website Skeptical Science and subsequently wanted to learn more about the wider topic discussed on the site . 
 In a review of the book by the academic journal Natures Sciences Sociétés , the authors ' thesis was praised for its ability to bring reason to their analysis : " This book shows how we can break through denial , accept reality , and thus solve the climate crisis " . Natures Sciences Sociétés recommended the work for multiple stakeholders , concluding : " It will engage scientists , university students , climate change activists as well as the general public seeking to roll back denial and act " . 
 Janine Kitson reviewed the book for the journal Education , a publication of the New South Wales Teachers Federation . Kitson described the work as timely and important within the context of a need for the public to act before a point of no return : " This is a crucial book to read before runaway climate change is truly beyond our control " . Her review concluded : " One can only hope that this book will be read by climate deniers so we can start the challenging journey to an ecologically sustainable future " . 
 In The New American , contributor William F. Jasper criticised the book 's authors ' characterization of those who engage in climate change denial as character assassination . He wrote that the labels " deniers " and " <unk> " were non @-@ constructive and cruel . Jasper disputed the book 's thesis that individuals who disagreed with anthropogenic global warming were organised and financed by the fossil fuel industry . 
 = Crysis 3 = 
 Crysis 3 is a first @-@ person shooter video game developed by Crytek and published by Electronic Arts for Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 , and Xbox 360 . It was released in North America on 19 February 2013 . Officially announced 16 April 2012 , it is the third main installment of the Crysis series , a sequel to the 2011 video game Crysis 2 . The multiplayer portion of the game was developed by Crytek UK . 
 Set in the year 2047 , the game takes place in New York City , which has been encased in a giant Nanodome created by the corrupt CELL corporation , and turned into a veritable urban rainforest . Crysis 3 's story revolves around Prophet , a Nanosuit holder who is on a quest to take revenge on the Alpha Ceph , the leader of the Ceph alien race , with the help of his former companion , Psycho . The game 's story serves as the end of the Crysis trilogy . Gameplay revolves around the use of the Nanosuit , which grants players a variety of abilities such as being invisible . New features introduced in Crysis 3 include a new Nanosuit ability called " Rip & Throw " , a new compound bow and the " hacking " feature , which allows players to hack into enemies ' equipment and weapons . 
 The game is set in a post @-@ apocalyptic New York City , in an effort to combine the urban landscape of Crysis 2 and the forest setting of the original Crysis . The game introduces the " Seven Wonders " , with each wonder having its own unique landscape . Due to complaints about Crysis 2 's linearity , the game 's levels were opened up so as to grant players more freedom . The development team also put efforts into creating a more emotional story , and the story 's protagonist , Prophet , was inspired by the lead character of District 9 . The game was developed by a team of 100 people during its 23 months development cycle . 
 Crysis 3 was met with positive reception after its release . Praise was directed at the game 's level design , visuals and multiplayer , while it was criticised for its story and length . With a budget of $ 66 million , the game sold 205 @,@ 000 copies in its debut month , and became a commercial failure for Electronic Arts . The game was later included in the The Crysis Trilogy bundle , which was released on February 20 , 2014 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Similar to the earlier games in the Crysis series , Crysis 3 is a first @-@ person shooter . Players take control of Prophet as he progresses through New York City to defeat the Ceph , an alien race . Throughout the game , players can slide , sprint , jump and crouch . When encountering enemies , players can defeat them by shooting guns or arrows , throwing explosives like grenades and C4 , or by performing a melee attack . Performing certain movements takes up energy from the Nanosuit , the armor worn by Prophet . Some abilities are not available for players to perform or utilize if the Nanosuit 's energy is too low ; they must wait until energy is refilled . As a result , players are tasked to manage the use of the energy . The game 's artificial intelligence was updated allowing enemies to react more quickly to players ' attacks . Enemies can take cover when attacked , and can deploy strategy to assist and support each other against attacks .
