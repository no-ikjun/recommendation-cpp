 = 1988 Bangladesh cyclone = 
 The 1988 Bangladesh cyclone ( designated as Tropical Cyclone 04B by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ) was one of the worst tropical cyclones in Bangladeshi history . Striking in November 1988 , the tropical system exacerbated the catastrophic damage from what was then considered the worst floods in Bangladesh 's history . The tropical cyclone originated from a disturbance that developed within the Strait of Malacca on November 21 . Tracking slowly westward , the initial tropical depression reached tropical storm status in the Andaman Sea . On November 26 , the storm reached an intensity equivalent to that of a modern @-@ day severe cyclonic storm and subsequently turned northward . Gradually intensifying as it had previously , the tropical cyclone reached peak intensity with winds of 125 mph ( 200 km / h ) as it was making landfall near the Bangladesh @-@ West Bengal border on November 29 . Although the storm retained strong winds well inland , it was last monitored over central Bangladesh as a moderate cyclonic storm @-@ equivalent on November 30 . 
 The brunt of the tropical cyclone 's damage was inflicted upon coastal areas of Bangladesh and West Bengal . A total of 6 @,@ 240 people were killed as a result of the storm , with 5 @,@ 708 in Bangladesh and 538 in West Bengal . Many of the deaths were a result of the destruction of homes or electrocution after strong winds toppled power poles across the region . Along the coast of Bangladesh , strong storm surge caused heavy infrastructure damage and contributed in wiping out an estimated 70 % of all harvestable Bangladeshi crops , with an estimated 200 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 220 @,@ 000 tons ) of crops being lost . Widespread power outages cut telecommunications across Bangladesh ; in Dhaka , Bangladesh 's capital city , debris @-@ laden streets paralyzed traffic while electrical outages caused water shortages . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 During November 1988 , weather patterns over the Bay of Bengal were dominated by the winter monsoon , leading to lower atmospheric pressures over the region and the conglomeration of moisture across the area . The genesis of the 1988 Bangladesh cyclone was preceded by floods that occurred over the Malay Peninsula as a result of a monsoon trough redeveloping over the region . By 18 : 00 UTC on November 21 , a low @-@ pressure area within the Strait of Malacca was sufficiently organized such that the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a Significant Tropical Weather Advisory ; thus , the JTWC began closely monitoring the newly developing storm . Over the next few days , the tropical depression tracked west @-@ northwestward into the Andaman Sea . The inchoate storm quickly organized during this period , and convection about the storm 's center intensified . These developments caused satellite intensity estimates to increasingly indicate a stronger storm , which in turn prompted the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert at 18 : 30 UTC on November 23 . At 06 : 00 UTC the following day , the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm status ( or modern @-@ day Cyclonic Storm @-@ equivalent ) and thus designate the storm as Tropical Cyclone 04B ; however , the storm 's " best track " listing , which details refined cyclone positions and is subject to revision , indicates that the storm reached tropical storm intensity six hours earlier . 
 After reaching tropical storm status , the system took on a slower and more westerly path across the Bay of Bengal . Gradually strengthening , the system attained typhoon intensity ( or modern @-@ day Severe Cyclonic Storm @-@ equivalent ) at 00 : 00 UTC on November 26 . Shortly after reaching this strength , the cyclone began to curve northward , rounding the western periphery of a subtropical ridge centered over Indochina . Due to the ridge 's broad size , the tropical cyclone was steered generally due north rather than northeast . Gradual intensification continued as the storm progressed closer to the coasts of Bangladesh and East India . At around 12 : 00 UTC on November 29 , the tropical cyclone made landfall near the border between Bangladesh and West Bengal at the mouth of the Hooghly River . At the time , the JTWC analyzed the storm to have had maximum sustained winds of 200 km / h ( 125 mph ) ; this was the cyclone 's peak intensity . After landfall , the storm slowly weakened over Bangladesh and was last noted as a cyclonic storm @-@ equivalent with sustained winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) on November 30 . 
 = = Impact and aftermath = = 
 The 1988 Bangladesh cyclone struck as Bangladesh was recovering from what had been considered the worst flood in Bangladeshi history earlier in the year . As a result , the additional effects of the passing cyclone exacerbated the flood 's impacts . Beginning two days before landfall , Bangladesh state radio and television continuously broadcast warning signals urging the evacuation of endangered residents along coastal areas . 
 The storm 's worst impacts were concentrated in the coastal Bangladeshi districts of Bagerhat , <unk> , Bhola , Jessore , Khulna , <unk> and Satkhira , as well as the Sundarbans . A 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) storm surge inflicted significant damage along the Bangladeshi coast and forced the temporary closure of the Port of Mongla , where nine were killed . Off the coast , waves generated by the tropical cyclone reached 4 @.@ 5 m ( 15 ft ) . Twenty vessels and barges and hundreds of small fishing boats sank as a result of the rough seas and storm surge generated by the storm . Another 37 vessels carrying ₤ 2 million ( US $ 3 @.@ 7 million ) of goods ran aground . Approximately 200 km ( 120 mi ) offshore , the Singaporean freighter <unk> capsized due to the cyclone , killing 19 . Initially reported as a much lower figure , 5 @,@ 708 fatalities occurred as a result of the tropical cyclone . Despite the high death toll , the Bangladeshi government stated that human casualties were minimized by efficient early warning systems . However , other deaths were blamed on poor communication systems , which did not effectively relay information to residents in more rural areas . Many of the deaths were caused by the collapse of dwellings or by electrocution due to the collapse of high tension power poles , and most of the deaths occurred in Khulna District . Nine people were killed in Khulna after a single power pole collapsed onto a house . A hundred corpses were discovered on the island of <unk> Char alone . In Satkhira , 100 people were killed due to flying debris kicked up by the storm 's fierce winds . In addition to the fatalities , nearly three million people were left homeless . 
 The storm 's effects also resulted in the deaths of over 33 @,@ 000 <unk> and inflicted a heavy blow to the country 's November – December rice harvest . Crop damage occurred across 174 @,@ 000 hectares ( 430 @,@ 000 acres ) of land in Bagerhat , Bhola , Khulna , and Satkhira districts as well as Cox 's Bazar . The total gross weight of crop losses was estimated at 200 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 220 @,@ 000 tons ) , accounting for 70 % of Bangladeshi crops that were ready for harvest . Extensive damage to infrastructure was reported across the nation . Most mud and straw houses and tin shed offices and schools were destroyed due to the storm . Telecommunications and electrical supplies were disrupted by the storm in at least sixteen towns and four coastal districts . In the capital city of Dhaka , debris and fallen trees caused by winds of up to 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) resulted in both power outages and paralyzed traffic . The power outages also disrupted the city 's distribution of water . In <unk> Upazila , all mud and straw @-@ constructed homes were destroyed . Overall , an official estimates suggested 50 @,@ 000 homes were destroyed across the country . However , independent investigations were more aggressive in their estimates , suggesting that over a million homes accounting for 60 – 80 % of homes in coastal Bangladesh were destroyed , displacing as many as seven million people . 
 In nearby West Bengal in India , the death toll was largely disputed between government agencies and news agencies , with the former generally indicating lower figures . While the Kolkata Police Force initially reported 210 deaths , various news agencies suggested that the death toll was around 500 . Ultimately , the official death toll in West Bengal reached 538 . In addition to human casualties , the cyclone also killed 57 @,@ 604 heads of cattle . The damage in West Bengal totaled US $ 13 million . 
 Following the cyclone 's passage , the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society began dispatching relief teams , food , and other supplies to impacted areas . The Bangladesh Army and non @-@ governmental organizations participated in both air- and water @-@ borne relief operations , though inclement weather initially forced the suspension of several planned helicopter flights . Both the Bangladesh Navy and Indian Navy convened in the northern littoral of the Bay of Bengal to search for the thousands of fishermen and islanders that went missing during the tropical cyclone 's landfall . Due to the wide scope of the disaster , the Bangladeshi government appealed for international aid , particularly from Japan and Canada as those countries had played large roles in the relief efforts of past Bangladeshi disasters . The Government of the Netherlands donated US $ 370 @,@ 000 for use in the relief efforts following the storm . Lord <unk> , then British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs , toured effected areas in Bangladesh for three days before announcing a ₤ 200 @,@ 000 grant ( US $ 370 @,@ 000 ) to voluntary relief agencies assisting in cyclone relief operations . Then @-@ Bangladeshi President Hussain Muhammad Ershad also visited the worst impacted districts , including Khulna and Bagerhat . Following these visits , Ershad 's administration established a national disaster committee composed of relief specialists to coordinate relief and rehabilitation efforts .

 = Exmoor pony = 
 The Exmoor pony is a horse breed native to the British Isles , where some still roam as semi @-@ feral livestock on Exmoor , a large area of moorland in Devon and Somerset in southwest England . The Exmoor has been given " endangered " status by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust , and " threatened " status by The Livestock Conservancy . It is one of the British Isles ' mountain and moorland pony breeds , having conformation similar to that of other cold @-@ weather @-@ adapted pony breeds . The Exmoor pony is hardy and used for a variety of equestrian activities . In its free @-@ roaming state , the breed 's presence on Exmoor contributes to the conservation and management of several natural pasture habitats . 
 Equines have been present in Britain since 700 @,@ 000 BC , and fossil remains have been found in the area of Exmoor dating back to about 50 @,@ 000 BC . Some claim that the breed has been purebred since the ice age ; others claim this is unsupported by modern DNA research . There is however a close morphological resemblance to the primitive wild horse . Archeological investigations have shown that horses were used for transport in the southwest of England as early as 400 BC , and Roman carvings show ponies phenotypically similar to the Exmoor pony . 
 The Domesday Book records ponies on Exmoor in 1086 , and descendants of ponies removed from the moor in 1818 form the foundation bloodstock of today 's Exmoor breed , although a breed society was not formed until 1921 . The breed nearly became extinct after the Second World War , owing to soldiers using them for target practice and thieves killing them for their meat . After the war a small group of breeders worked to save the Exmoor , and during the 1950s ponies began to be exported to North America . The first stud book was published in 1963 , and in 1981 publicity resulted in increased interest in the breed . As of 2010 there were an estimated 800 Exmoor ponies worldwide . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Exmoor ponies are usually a variant of dark bay , called " brown " , with pangaré ( " mealy " ) markings around the eyes , muzzle , flanks , and underbelly . Pangaré markings occur in other equines as well as horses , and are considered to be a primitive trait . Entry in the breed registry requires that the animal have no white markings . They usually stand 11 @.@ 1 to 12 @.@ 3 hands ( 45 to 51 inches , 114 to 130 cm ) , with the recommended height limit for mares being 12 @.@ 2 hands ( 50 inches , 127 cm ) and that for stallions and geldings 12 @.@ 3 hands ( 51 inches , 130 cm ) <unk> <unk> may be taller than this limit with some reaching <unk> 
 With a stocky , powerful build , the Exmoor pony is strong for its height , and noted for its hardiness and endurance . The chest is deep and the back broad , the croup level . The legs are short , with good bone and hard hooves . Although many sources state that the Exmoor has a distinctly different jaw structure from other horse breeds , which includes the beginnings of development of a seventh molar , this is a misunderstanding based on an incorrect translation of a German study . The study , when properly translated , refers to a feature , found in multiple horse breeds and perhaps all animals with sizable lower jaws , that appears to be an extra branch of blood supply in the area . While an extra tooth may have eventually developed from this extra blood supply , its frequency among the general horse population makes its appearance in the Exmoor pony unremarkable . 
 The head is somewhat large in proportion to the body , with small ears , and has a unique feature called a " toad eye " caused by extra fleshiness of the eyelids , which helps to deflect water and provide extra insulation . As with most cold @-@ weather pony breeds , the Exmoor grows a winter coat consisting of a highly insulating woolly <unk> and a <unk> of longer , oily hairs that prevent the undercoat from becoming waterlogged by diverting water down the sides of the animal to fall from just a few drip areas . The mane and tail are thick and long , and the dock of the tail is of a type common in cold @-@ weather ponies , having coarse hairs , called a " frost cap , " " snow chute , " or " ice tail " that deflects rainwater away from the groin and underbelly areas to fall from the long hairs on the back of the hind legs . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Prehistoric origin theories = = = 
 Exmoor fanciers claim the breed is directly descended from an isolated population of wild ancestors bred pure since the Ice Age , and thus more than 10 @,@ 000 years old . Modern DNA research to date has not supported that traditionally held view of the origin of the Exmoor pony however , as existing studies indicate they share their maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA with various other horse breeds from across the world , and their paternally inherited Y @-@ chromosome is identical to that of most other domesticated horses . 
 However , horses have been present in Britain for hundreds of thousands of years . Two species of wild horse were identified from remains at Pakefield , East Anglia , dating back to 700 @,@ 000 BC , and spear damage on a horse shoulder bone discovered at Eartham Pit , Boxgrove , dated 500 @,@ 000 BC , showed that early humans were hunting horses in the area at that time . Horse remains from about 50 @,@ 000 BC have been recovered from Kent 's Cavern in nearby Torquay , remains dating from around 7 @,@ 000 BC have been found in Gough 's Cave in Cheddar Gorge , less than 50 miles ( 80 km ) from Exmoor , subfossil horse tracks have been found in the Bristol Channel / Severn Estuary area , and pre @-@ domesticated horse bones have been found in Severn @-@ Cotswold chamber tombs dating to 3500 BC . 
 = = = Modern DNA studies and archaeology = = = 
 No genetic studies to date have correlated these prehistoric remains to any modern breed . What has been studied are Y @-@ chromosomes ( Y @-@ DNA ) and mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) obtained from Exmoor ponies . The Y @-@ chromosome is passed on through the male line , and worldwide shows very little genetic variation in horses , except for a second Y @-@ chromosome haplotype found in China , suggesting that a very limited number of stallions contributed to the original genome of the domestic horse . The Exmoor pony shares this general Y @-@ chromosome haplotype . In contrast , mitochondrial DNA is passed on though the female line , and shows far more variation than Y @-@ DNA , indicating that a large number of wild mares from several regions have contributed to modern domestic breeds . Some mtDNA @-@ haplotypes have been found in DNA samples obtained from wild horses in prehistoric deposits , while other mtDNA @-@ haplotypes have only been found in domesticated horses , from both living individuals and archeological finds . The Exmoor pony has a high frequency of pre @-@ domestication mtDNA @-@ haplotypes , but these are also found in different breeds all around the world . Currently , for the British Isles , there are only three DNA archeological samples available , all from Ireland . Although wild horses were abundant after the last ice age , the lack of sufficient pre @-@ domestication DNA samples makes it impossible to determine the contribution of the wild horses of the British Islands to modern breeds , including the Exmoor pony . A 1995 study of morphological characteristics , the outward appearance of organisms , indicated that the Exmoor , Pottock , and Tarpan have an extremely close resemblance ; these breeds were consistently grouped together in the results from several analyses , with the Exmoor showing the closest relationship to the Tarpan of all the breeds studied , at 0 @.@ 27 ; the next @-@ closest breeds to the Tarpan were the Pottock and Merens , both with a genetic distance from the Tarpan of 0 @.@ 47 . The distance between the Exmoor and Pottock was 0 @.@ 37 , and between the Exmoor and Merens was 0 @.@ 40 ; a significantly wider gap than the distance between the Exmoor and Tarpan . 
 The first indication of domesticated horses in England comes from archaeological investigations showing that the ancient Britons were using wheeled horse @-@ drawn transport extensively in southwest England as early as 400 BC . Recent research has indicated that there was significant Roman involvement in mining on Exmoor . Metals including iron , tin , and copper were transported to Hengistbury Head in neighbouring Dorset for export , and Roman carvings , showing British and Roman chariots pulled by ponies phenotypically similar to the Exmoor , have been found in Somerset . 
 = = = Recorded history and modern times = = = 
 The Domesday Book mentions ponies in Exmoor in 1086 . Mentions of the ponies are rare between then and 1818 , when the Royal Exmoor Forest was sold to a private buyer . Sir Thomas Acland , the Exmoor Royal Forest 's last warden , took 30 ponies from the area to Winsford Hill , where he owned land . This herd became known as the Anchor herd , and a small number of descendants of this original herd still remain at Winsford Hill . At the same time as Acland 's removal , the rest of the ponies were sold , but some stayed with breeders in the area , and their families still preserve the descendants of those animals . From the 1820s to 1860s Exmoors were used to produce crossbreds , which although successful were not as hardy as their ancestors . In 1893 , the ponies were described in Sidney 's Book of the Horse as around 12 hands ( 48 inches , 122 cm ) high , usually bay in color , and with conformation similar to what it is today . In the late 1800s , the National Pony Society began to register Exmoors and Exmoor crossbreds . In 1921 , the Exmoor Pony Society was formed , and published its first stud book in 1963 . 
 The Second World War led to a sharp decrease in the breed population as the moor became a training ground . The breed nearly became extinct , with only 50 ponies surviving the war . This was partially due to soldiers using some ponies for target practice and others being stolen and eaten by people in the cities . After the war , a small group of breeders continued to preserve the population , and publicity in 1981 resulted in increased interest in the breed . The first Exmoors in North America were imported to Canada in the 1950s , and several small herds are still maintained there . In the 1990s , small herds of Exmoor ponies were established in various areas of England . These herds are used to maintain vegetation on nature reserves , many being managed by organisations such as the National Trust , Natural England , and County Wildlife Trusts . 
 Every purebred registered Exmoor is branded with a four @-@ point star on the near ( left ) shoulder until the 2000s which attracted criticism . However it is now limited to semi feral ponies as the <unk> ' choice . In 2000 , the Moorland <unk> Trust , a British organisation , was established to assist in the preservation of the Exmoor pony . There is little market for Exmoor colts , so the organisation works to raise funds for the gelding and training of these horses . 
 Currently , The Livestock Conservancy considers the population of the Exmoor to be at " threatened " levels , meaning that the estimated global population of the breed is less than 5 @,@ 000 and there are less than 1 @,@ 000 registrations annually in the US . The UK Rare Breeds Survival Trust considers the breed to be " endangered " , meaning that population numbers are estimated to be less than 500 in Great Britain . The Equus Survival Trust considers the breed to be " critical " , meaning that there are between 100 and 300 active adult breeding mares . As of 2010 , there were estimated to be around 800 Exmoor ponies worldwide . 
 = = Uses = = 
 In the past , Exmoors were used as pit ponies . Ponies not kept in semi @-@ feral conditions are used for a variety of activities including showing , long @-@ distance riding , driving , and agility . Exmoor ponies won both divisions at the International Horse Agility Championships in 2011 , and took a third title at the 2012 Championships . The breed 's hardiness makes it suitable for conservation grazing , and it contributes to the management of many heathland , chalk grassland and other natural pasture habitats , as well as to the conservation of Exmoor itself . 
 A herd of 14 Exmoors from Exmoor National park were moved to the former military base of <unk> ( <unk> District ) , Czech Republic , in an effort to save biodiversity , in January 2015 . 
 = Ian Svenonius = 
 Ian F Svenonius is an American musician , notable as the singer of various Washington , D.C.-based bands including Nation of Ulysses , The Make @-@ Up , Weird War , and Chain and The Gang . Between his numerous projects , Svenonius has released more than 19 full @-@ length albums and more than 20 singles , EPs , and splits . Svenonius is also a published author and an online talk show host . 
 His first band , Nation of Ulysses , formed in 1988 , was influential in the Washington D.C. punk scene , dissolving in 1992 after failing to record their third studio album . After a short @-@ lived side @-@ project called Cupid Car Club , Svenonius formed The Make @-@ Up in 1995 , who combined garage rock , soul , and liberation theology to make a new genre they dubbed " Gospel Yeh @-@ Yeh " . The Make @-@ Up dissolved early in 2001 , and a year later , Svenonius formed the band Weird War , who were also known briefly as the Scene Creamers . Svenonius ' solo work includes the 2001 album Play Power under the fictional pseudonym of David Candy , the book The Psychic Soviet , and as host of Soft Focus on <unk> Svenonius ' projects and writings have all shared an anti @-@ authoritarian , Marxist political rhetoric . 
 = = Musical projects = = 
 = = = Nation of Ulysses = = = 
 Svenonius ' first musical group was Nation of Ulysses . The band formed in spring 1988 , initially composed of four members , Svenonius on vocals and trumpet , Steve Kroner on guitar , Steve Gamboa on bass guitar , and James Canty on drums , and known simply as " Ulysses " . In late 1989 , Tim Green joined the band as a second guitarist and the band was renamed to " Nation of Ulysses " . The Nation of Ulysses described themselves not as a rock and roll group in the traditional sense , but " as a political party " and as " a shout of secession " . Explaining their intent , Svenonius said " it 's basically a new nation underground for the dispossessed youth colony . It 's all about smashing the old edifice , the monolith of rock and roll " . 
 In 1991 , before the band had released any official recordings , Svenonius was featured as teen @-@ oriented Sassy Magazine 's first " Sassiest Boy in America " . He was interviewed in the magazine 's October issue , detailing the band 's sound and political motivations . Svenonius stated that the Nation of Ulysses ' intent was " to create a space of liberation where anything ’ s possible " . He criticized " traditional rock @-@ and @-@ roll " groups as a " corrupt medium " . The contest was reportedly a " nationwide search for the most perfect boyfriend material a girl could ask for " , and Svenonius was among 150 entries . 
 Nation of Ulysses was known for their extremely physical performances , during which Svenonius recalls many injuries , including breaking his arm , his leg , and his skull on numerous occasions . Audience members were also hurt during some performances . 
 The group disbanded in the fall of 1992 having failed to complete their third album ( the finished tracks were later released as The Embassy Tapes in 2000 ) . In a later interview , Svenonius explained the reason for the split : " Nation of Ulysses broke up because the epoch changed with the advent of digital music and the Nirvana explosion . We were faced with what 's now known as indie rock , a sort of vacuous form . We had to determine our next move and this [ the forming of The Make @-@ Up ] is it " . 
 = = = The Make @-@ Up = = = 
 The Make @-@ Up formed in 1995 , consisting of Svenonius , Canty , and Gamboa from Nation of Ulysses , and with the addition of Michelle Mae on bass guitar . The Make @-@ Up were joined in late 1999 by a fifth member , Alex Minoff , who played guitar with the group until their dissolution in 2001 . In the band 's five years of activity , they released four studio albums , two live albums , a posthumous compilation of singles and B @-@ sides , and a number of 12 @-@ inch singles and splits . The Make @-@ Up combined garage rock , soul , and self @-@ styled " liberation theology " to make a new genre they called " Gospel Yeh @-@ Yeh " . The Make @-@ Up were highly influenced by bubblegum music , particularly the French variety called Yé @-@ yé music . 
 As the Make @-@ Up 's frontman and mouthpiece , Ian Svenonius often contextualized the band 's music in terms of larger socio @-@ political themes , typically describing the band and its gospel attitude in Marxist and socialist terms , in opposition of what he saw as the capitalist , bourgeois , machismo paradigm of rock and roll . The band 's aversion to American culture was expressed through their self @-@ styled musical genre " Gospel Yeh @-@ Yeh , " a belief system through which they advocated to their audience to " get theirs " and to " off the pigs in all their forms " . The Make @-@ Up intended to create ad @-@ lib performances to re @-@ energize what they saw as the stale , bland and formal ritual of rock and roll . <unk> gospel music 's use of the congregate as a " fifth member , " the Make @-@ Up incorporated audience participation through call and response vocals , lyrical " discussion " techniques , and destruction of the fourth wall by physical transgression . 
 The Make @-@ Up dissolved in 2000 , reportedly " due to the large number of counter @-@ gang copy groups which had appropriated their look and sound and applied it to a vacuous and counter @-@ revolutionary forms " . Between projects , Svenonius released a solo album under the pseudonym David Candy . 
 = = = Weird War = = = 
 After The Make @-@ Up disbanded , Svenonius formed the group Weird War in 2001 , joined by Make @-@ Up members Michelle Mae and Alex Minoff . While the current lineup appears on the group 's first release I 'll Never Forget What 's His Name , the group 's first full @-@ length , eponymous release featured Neil Hagerty and Jessica <unk> on guitars , and Steve McCarty on drums . 
 These collaborators soon left to pursue other projects , and the band briefly changed its name to The Scene Creamers , with Svenonius on vocals , Michelle Mae on bass , Alex Minoff on guitar , and Blake Brunner on drums . In this incarnation , the band released I Suck on that Emotion , through Drag City . After being threatened with a legal suit for the name Scene Creamers by a French graffiti artist collective of the same name , the band reverted to the name Weird War . Since then , as its membership has become static , with the addition of Argentine Sebastian Thomson on drums , its intent has become more cosmic . Weird War claims that they are " the sole answer to the hype @-@ based careerism , empty formalism and vacuity which has infected what was once a genuinely creative underground rock ' n ' roll scene " . 
 = = = Chain and The Gang = = = 
 Svenonius ' latest musical project , Chain and The Gang , released the albums Down With Liberty ... Up With Chains ! , " Music 's Not For Everyone " , " In Cool Blood " on K Records , and " Minimum Rock ' n ' Roll " on Radical Elite Records . Some of the musicians featured on these records are Calvin Johnson , Brett Lyman ( Bad Thoughts / M <unk> 's Records ) , Fiona Campbell ( Vivian Girls / <unk> ) , Sarah Pedal of Seahorse Liberation Army , Katie Greer , <unk> Hudson ( The Curious Mystery ) , Brian Weber ( Dub Narcotic Sound System ) , Veronica <unk> ( Finally Punk / Carrots ) , Nicolaas <unk> ( Desolation Wilderness ) , Karl Blau , Chris Sutton ( Hornet Leg , The Gossip ) , Sixx ( The <unk> ) , Arrington de <unk> , Aaron Hartman , and Benjamin Hartman ( Old Time <unk> ) .

The book serves as an anthology of past articles and essays by Svenonius previously published in periodicals , edited for readability and flow , with a number of new essays included . 
 The " Instructions " that preface the book state that it " should clear up much of the confusion regarding events of the last millennium - artistic , geo @-@ political , philosophical , et al . " and encourages the reader to " refer to the book in case of ethical quandaries , arguments , and social feuds " . The writing addresses topics such as the ascent of the DJ as a " star , " the " cosmic depression " that followed the defeat of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the Cold War , and the status of rock and roll as a religion . To date , The Psychic Soviet is the most complete collection of written material by Svenonius .

 Throughout his career , Svenonius has disc jockeyed at clubs such as Cold Rice in Washington , D.C. In 1993 Svenonius and Nation of Ulysses / Make @-@ Up members James Canty and Steve Gamboa were involved in the short @-@ lived project Cupid Car Club , which released only one EP on Kill Rock Stars Records entitled Join our Club . In 2001 Svenonius collaborated with the English <unk> / producer Mike <unk> of If .. Records to create the record Play Power under the pseudonym David Candy . The album was released through Jet Set Records , Siesta Records , and If .. Records . Play Power was part of a series of " Magazine @-@ Style Records " which included other imaginary acts such as Death by Chocolate , Maria Napoleon , and Lollipop Train . 
 Svenonius wrote an afterword for Glen E.

 = Netball and the Olympic Movement = 
 Netball is an Olympic recognised sport , a status attained in 1995 after a twenty @-@ year period of lobbying . It has never been played at the Summer Olympics , but with recognition a formal requirement for inclusion is met . The absence at the Olympic Games was seen by the netball community as a hindrance to the global growth of the game , depriving it of media attention and funding . Inclusion is hampered , because it is mainly played by women , and mostly in Commonwealth countries . When the sport gained recognition , it opened up sources of funds that the global netball community had not been able to access before , including the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , national Olympic committees and sports organisations , and state and federal governments . 
 = = Women 's sport at the Olympics = = 
 According to Dyer in 1982 , exclusion of netball from the Summer Olympics is part of the historical pattern of the slow growth and gradual acceptance of women 's sports . Women first competed in the 1900 Summer Olympics in only three sports : tennis , croquet and golf . Women 's cycling was excluded for many years despite having world championships organised by 1958 . Field hockey , a sport included for men as early as 1908 , was not open to competition by women until 1980 . By the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona , there were 159 medal events for men , but only 86 for women , and 12 for both men and women , and as late as 1996 , 26 countries sent no women to the Olympics . There were still sports that excluded women at the 2000 Summer Olympics , such as boxing , wrestling and baseball . At the 2012 Summer Olympics , every country but Nauru did , and both men and women competed in 34 sports . 
 At the 2012 Olympics , there were two sports for women only : synchronized swimming and rhythmic gymnastics . That netball is also played mostly by women is seen as a drawback . Netball does allow for mixed teams , but the Olympics did not include mixed sex team sports . Rugby sevens and golf , primarily played by men , were chosen for inclusion in the 2016 Summer Olympics for both sexes ahead of netball . 
 The issue of male over @-@ representation in terms of total number of sports and athletes is structural . In the United Kingdom , for example , more male athletes than female ones receive financial support . Sports officials rationalise this uneven distribution by claiming that there are more opportunities for men to win at the highest level than there are for women . The importance of being part of the Summer Olympics is illustrated by softball , and the benefits the sport derived from its inclusion . This included additional media coverage , especially during Olympic years . Olympic recognition plays an important part in getting sponsorship for local competitions around the world and providing new opportunities for females . 
 = = Olympic recognition = = 
 Efforts to gain Olympic recognition started in 1967 , at the time when the International Federation of Netball Associations ( IFNA ) was founded . The Jamaican and Singaporean delegations present at the meeting suggested the newly created organisation become affiliated with the World Olympic Sports Council and try to get netball included on the Olympic programme . Opinions were initially split inside the newly formed organisation as to whether this was a goal worth striving for , but ultimately it was decided to work towards Olympic recognition . The federation 's first application was rejected because it referred to the sport as women 's basketball and the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) said there could not be two different sports with the same name on the Olympic programme . This rejection was a driving factor for changing the name of the sport . There was tremendous resistance in Australia and New Zealand to this . IFNA made " major concessions " to both countries to persuade them to change the name of their national federations . In 1965 , the IOC criteria required a sport must be played in at least 11 nations and the international body represented the sport must have at least 27 national organisations affiliated with it . 
 A second application was started in 1971 after the previous rejection which reflected the name change . While name changes and other International Olympic Committee suggestions were agreed upon as necessary to go forward , the integration of these changes into the Federation 's constitution and governance strategy took over four years and the application languished as a result until 1979 , when the IOC responded with a request for additional information on IFNA 's finances and governance . The decision to provide additional information was deferred until 1979 's Conference . The Jamaican representatives were frustrated with the slow process inside the organisation and tried to take steps to speed the process up inside IFNA . This included submitting proposals for organisational changes to address the most recent IOC feedback , addressing issues such as player drug testing , the selling of television and radio rights , and how to establish an Olympic draw among other points . Because of Jamaican influence , IFNA created a specific committee to work on the issue of addressing Olympic requirements , which was composed of New Zealanders Rena <unk> , Lorna <unk> and Anne Taylor . They were supposed to have these issues addressed by a meeting scheduled at the end of 1979 . 
 Delays happened because of the structure of IFNA and the required material was not ready for presenting before IFNA 's Council until 1983 . During this four @-@ year waiting period , Jamaica and Bermuda continued to agitate for the Federation to speed the process along as attaining recognition would provide their region with additional funding and make it easier to grow the sport regionally . The second application was eventually rejected in 1983 , with the IOC claiming the sport had " limited popularity " . While netball was not able to gain Olympic recognition during this period , it did gain recognition from General Assembly of International Sports Federations . This allowed netball to be played at the World Games in 1985 . 
 Because of the 1983 rejection , an earlier idea that had been tried and failed in 1979 was revisited : Creating regional Federations for the Americas , Europe , Oceania and Asia , regional groupings mirroring that of the Olympic organisers . This was implemented by 1987 , which was rejected later that year because the sport did not meet all the criteria established and it was not yet a global sport . The IOC viewed the sport as one belonging only to the Commonwealth of Nations . While the netball was rejected for a third time , the New Zealand hosts of the 1990 Commonwealth Games managed to get the sport to have demonstration status , with the news of this being announced in 1987 . That same year , netball also gained full member status from the General Assembly of International Sports Federations In the mean time , the IOC did provide the Federation with a US $ 1 @,@ 000 grant , though none of this grant money was used by 1991 . Because of what appeared to be the unlikely recognition by the IOC , the Federation urged its national members to seek membership with their national Olympic committees so national federations could access national funding in order to help grow the sport inside their home countries . 
 A decision was made to try again for Olympic recognition was made , but the Federation was irritated because they had never been given clear guidelines for what the IOC was looking for in terms of a sport gaining Olympic recognition . The Federation believed that every time they met the criteria they were given , there was a new hoop for them to jump through . An example of this was a requirement given to the Federation 1992 / 1993 that the IOC be given technical specs for venue space should the sport be included on the Olympic programme . The Federation continued to work to address these requirements and eventually , in October 1993 , netball through IFNA was given provisional Olympic recognition , requiring a two @-@ year probation period . This recognition came with a US $ 10 @,@ 000 per year per region for the Federation to develop the sport around the world . 
 In 1995 , netball became a permanent Olympic recognised sport after a twenty @-@ year period of lobbying and a two @-@ year probation period . This makes it eligible to be played in future Games . Recognition has meant national associations could become full members of their countries ' national Olympic committees . National members of IFNA were able to apply for that recognition by 1993 . The All Australia Netball Association is one national organisation that has become a full member of their national Olympic committee . In 2004 , International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) recognition of the IFNA was renewed . The IFNA has made Olympic recognition part of its long @-@ term strategy towards continuing to grow the game . 
 There have been multiple attempts by netball supporters to get the sport played in the Summer Olympics . In 1996 , the netball leadership actively pursued the possibility of netball being played at the 2000 Summer Olympics . The government of New South Wales encouraged the Australian Olympic Committee to lobby for the inclusion of netball in the 2008 Beijing Olympic games . Prime Minister Gordon Brown , Netball England national team member Tamsin Greenway , two time Olympic gold medallist Kelly Holmes and Olympic heptathlon competitor Denise Lewis are English supporters who would like to see netball in future Olympic games . The earliest the sport could be included on the programme would be 2024 . 
 In an extraordinary session in Mexico City in November 2002 , the IOC decided to limit the total number of sports to 28 , events to 301 and athletes to 10 @,@ 500 , slowing the process of adding new sports to future Olympic Games . At the extraordinary session , the IOC set forth the requirements that a sport must meet before it is eligible for inclusion in the Olympic programme . The table created in the documentation for this meeting is provided below : 
 = = Funding = = 
 The lack of Olympic recognition hampered the globalisation of the game in developing countries because the Olympic Solidarity Movement provides access to funding for these nations through the International Olympic Committee . In some countries , such as Tanzania , the lack of access to Olympic funding cut off other options such as funding by the British Council . With official recognition , funding from the IOC , the Olympic Solidarity Movement and the British Council became available to cover costs for travel to international competitions . For some nations , without that assistance , trying to maintain international calibre teams was difficult . Olympic recognition brought money for development into the sport . In 2004 , IFNA received a grant of US $ 10 @,@ 000 from the IOC for development . IFNA was given an additional US $ 3 @,@ 300 a year until 2007 by the Association of IOC Recognised International Sports ( <unk> ) . 
 Beyond access to funds from the IOC , state and national sporting bodies , and state and federal governments often use IOC status as a funding criteria . This has been the case in Australia , and British Columbia , Canada . In 1985 , the Australian Sports Commission and the Office of the Status of Women identified five criteria for obtaining federal funding . One of these was " status as an Olympic sport and its size by registrations . " In British Columbia , one of the guidelines says that in order to receive funding , " the sport must be on the program for either the 2011 or 2013 Canada Games and / or the next scheduled recognized International Multi @-@ Sport Games ( Olympics / Paralympics , Pan American or Commonwealth Games , Special Olympic World Games ) " . 
 The IOC and its daughter organisations give awards and scholarships . In 1995 , two of the scholarships offered by the Oceania Olympic Training Centre were given to <unk> : <unk> Snape and Darlene Marsters . The Oceania Olympic Training Centre also made it possible for Mona @-@ Lisa Leka from Papua New Guinea to go to Australia to train . In 2007 , the IOC awarded <unk> Apana <unk> , the Vice @-@ President of the NOC of Papua New , the Trophy for Oceania . This recognition came in part because she had created the nation 's national netball organisation in 1965 and actively promoted women 's involvement in netball around the country . 
 = = Media coverage = = 
 Netball is most popular Commonwealth countries , and the most popular women 's spectator sport in Australia and Tanzania and the effort to increase media attention and participation for women 's sport often goes to Olympic sports with low participation rates , low rates of interest and few facilities . Even then , historically , coverage of women 's team sports in the Olympics has been limited . Instead , according to Jones , the media focus on female athletes in non @-@ team competitions and on team sports played equally by both genders . 
 = = National associations = = 
 National netball associations have been involved with national Olympic committees as members or associate members , or had their administrators generally involved with national Olympic Committees , for a long time . In the case of the Bahamas , by 1960 the Bahamas Olympic Association had as one of its member organisations the national netball association . Netball was also represented in the Dominica Olympic Committee almost from the moment the organisation was founded . Some of the national netball federations that are affiliated with their national Olympic Committee include Netball Singapore and the All Australia Netball Association . 
 = Rambles in Germany and Italy = 
 Rambles in Germany and Italy , in 1840 , 1842 , and 1843 is a travel narrative by the British Romantic author Mary Shelley . Issued in 1844 , it is her last published work . Published in two volumes , the text describes two European trips that Mary Shelley took with her son , Percy Florence Shelley , and several of his university friends . Mary Shelley had lived in Italy with her husband , Percy Bysshe Shelley , between 1818 and 1823 . For her , Italy was associated with both joy and grief : she had written much while there but she had also lost her husband and two of her children . Thus , although she was anxious to return , the trip was tinged with sorrow . Shelley describes her journey as a pilgrimage , which will help cure her depression . 
 At the end of the second trip , Mary Shelley spent time in Paris and associated herself with the " Young Italy " movement , Italian exiles who were in favour of Italian independence and unification . One revolutionary in particular attracted her : Ferdinando Gatteschi . To assist him financially , Shelley decided to publish Rambles . However , Gatteschi became discontented with Shelley 's assistance and tried to blackmail her . She was forced to obtain her personal letters from Gatteschi through the intervention of the French police . 
 Shelley differentiates her travel book from others by presenting her material from what she describes as " a political point of view " . In so doing , she challenges the early nineteenth @-@ century convention that it was improper for women to write about politics , following in the tradition of her mother , Mary Wollstonecraft , and Lady Morgan . Shelley 's aim was to arouse sympathy in England for Italian revolutionaries , such as Gatteschi . She rails against the imperial rule of Austria and France over Italy and criticises the domination of the Catholic Church . She describes the Italians as having an untapped potential for greatness and a desire for freedom . 
 Though Shelley herself thought the work " poor " , it found favour with reviewers who praised its independence of thought , wit , and feeling . Shelley 's political commentary on Italy was specifically singled out for praise , particularly since it was written by a woman . For most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , Shelley was usually known only as the author of Frankenstein and the wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley . Rambles was not reprinted until the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1970s provoked a wider interest in Shelley 's entire corpus .

 = = = Risorgimento = = = 
 From the Middle Ages until the end of the nineteenth century , Italy was divided into many small duchies and city @-@ states , some of which were autonomous and some of which were controlled by Austria , France , Spain , or the Papacy . These multifarious governments and the diversity of Italian dialects spoken on the peninsula caused residents to identify as " Romans " or " Venetians " , for example , rather than as " Italians " . When Napoleon conquered parts of Italy during the French Revolutionary Wars ( 1792 – 1802 ) and the Napoleonic Wars ( 1803 – 15 ) , he unified many of the smaller principalities ; he centralised the governments and built roads and communication networks that helped to break down the barriers between and among Italians . Not all Italians welcomed French rule , however ; Giuseppe Capobianco founded a secret society called the Carbonari to resist both French rule and the Roman Catholic Church . After Napoleon was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and the Congress of Vienna left much of northern Italy in the hands of the Austrians , the Carbonari continued their resistance . The Carbonari led revolts in Naples and Piedmont in 1820 and 1821 and in Bologna , the Papal States , Parma , and Modena in the 1830s . After the failure of these revolts , Giuseppe Mazzini , a <unk> who was exiled from Italy , founded the " Young Italy " group to work toward the unification of Italy , to establish a democratic republic , and to force non @-@ Italian states to relinquish authority on the peninsula . By 1833 , 60 @,@ 000 people had joined the movement . These nationalist revolutionaries , with foreign support , attempted , but failed , to overthrow the Austrians in Genoa and Turin in 1833 and Calabria in 1844 . Italian unification , or Risorgimento , was finally achieved in 1870 under the leadership of Giuseppe Garibaldi .

 Mary Shelley and her husband Percy Bysshe Shelley had lived in Italy from 1818 to 1823 . Although Percy Shelley and two of their four children died there , Italy became for Mary Shelley " a country which memory painted as paradise " , as she put it . The couple 's Italian years were a time of intense intellectual and creative activity . Percy composed a series of major poems , and Mary wrote the autobiographical novel Matilda , the historical novel Valperga , and the plays Proserpine and Midas . Mary Shelley had always wanted to return to Italy and she excitedly planned her 1840 trip . The return was painful as she was constantly reminded of Percy Shelley . 
 In June 1840 , Mary Shelley , Percy Florence ( her one surviving child ) , and a few of his friends — George <unk> , Julian Robinson , and Robert Leslie Ellis — began their European tour . They travelled to Paris and then to Metz . From there , they went down the Moselle by boat to Coblenz and then up the Rhine to Mainz , Frankfurt , Heidelberg , Baden @-@ Baden , Freiburg , Schaffhausen , Zürich , the <unk> , and Chiavenna . Feeling ill , Shelley rested at a spa in Baden @-@ Baden ; she had wracking pains in her head and " convulsive shudders " , symptoms of the <unk> that would eventually kill her . This stop dismayed Percy Florence and his friends , as it provided no entertainment for them ; moreover , since none of them spoke German , the group was forced to remain together . After crossing Switzerland by carriage and railway , the group spent two months at Lake Como , where Mary relaxed and reminisced about how she and Percy had almost rented a villa with Lord Byron at the lake one summer . The group then travelled on to Milan , and from there , Percy Florence and his friends soon left for Cambridge to take their university finals . Mary Shelley remained , waiting for funds to complete her journey . In September , she returned to England via Geneva and Paris . Upon her return , she became depressed and could not write : " [ in Italy ] I might live – as once I lived — hoping — loving — aspiring enjoying ... I am placid now , & the days go by – I am happy in Percy [ Florence 's ] society & health – but no adjuncts ... gild the quiet hours & <unk> [ sic ] creeps over my intellect " . Despite this lethargy she managed to publish a second edition of Percy Shelley 's prose and began working on another edition of his poetry . 
 = = = = 1842 – 44 = = = = 
 Sir Timothy Shelley gave his grandson Percy Florence an increase in his allowance for his twenty @-@ first birthday , allowing Mary Shelley and Percy Florence to plan a second , longer trip to the Continent . In June 1842 , Mary Shelley and her son left for a fourteen @-@ month tour . They were accompanied by a few of his friends : Alexander Andrew Knox , a poet and classicist , whom Emily Sunstein , a biographer of Mary Shelley , describes as " reminiscent of [ Percy ] Shelley " ; Henry Hugh Pearson , a musician who had written musical accompaniments for several of Percy Shelley 's poems ; and Robert Leslie Ellis . Mary Shelley hoped that the easy manners of the other young men would rub off on her awkward son , but instead they became petty and jealous of each other . The group visited Liège , Cologne , Coblenz , Mainz , Frankfurt , Kissingen , Berlin , Dresden , Prague , Salzburg , the Tyrol , Innsbruck , Riva , Verona , Venice , Florence , and Rome . In Rome , Mary Shelley toured museums with the French art critic Alex Rio ; Percy Florence was unimpressed with the culture and refused to see the art , infuriating his mother , who spent an increasing amount of her time seeing the country with Knox instead . She also paid numerous visits to Percy Bysshe Shelley 's grave in Rome . After two months in the Sorrento Peninsula , the group was short of money ; Percy Florence and his friends returned home while Mary Shelley went on to Paris . 
 In Paris , Mary Shelley associated with many of the Italian expatriates who were part of the " Young Italy " movement . Her recent travels had made her particularly sympathetic to their revolutionary message . One Italian patriot captivated her in particular : Ferdinando Gatteschi , a smart , handsome , would @-@ be writer . He was young — not yet 30 — and in exile , following his participation in a failed Carbonari rebellion against Austria in 1830 – 31 . Shelley was fascinated by Gatteschi ; she described him as " a hero & an angel & martyr " . Jeanne Moskal , the most recent editor of Rambles , argues that Mary Shelley was attracted to Gatteschi because he resembled Percy Shelley : he was an aristocratic writer who had been cast off by his parents for his liberalism . Moskal argues that " the strength of [ Shelley 's ] devotion overturned her previous resolve not to publish again " . 
 At the end of September 1843 , Mary Shelley proposed to her publisher , Edward Moxon , that she write a travel book based on her 1840 and 1842 Continental journeys . Interested in assisting Gatteschi , she wrote to Moxon that she was writing " for a purpose most urgent & desirable " . She described the work as " light " , " personal " , and " amusing " . Moxon agreed to her proposal and advanced her £ 60 , which she promised to return if fewer than 300 copies of the work were sold . ( She subsequently gave this same amount to Gatteschi . ) By the end of January 1844 , Shelley had already completed most of the first volume . As Sunstein writes , " once started on Rambles , she worked fast and with pleasure , but her head and nerves were bad at times , and her eyes got so weak and inflamed that she wrote only until noon . " She left Paris at the end of January and returned to London , still infatuated with Gatteschi . The death of Sir Timothy Shelley , Percy Florence 's grandfather , in April 1844 , delayed the completion of the work . However , with material from Gatteschi on the Ancona uprising of 1831 and research help from German @-@ speaking friends , Shelley finished . The text was largely drawn from correspondence written during her travels to her step @-@ sister Claire Clairmont . Mary Shelley 's last published work , which was dedicated to the travel writer and poet Samuel Rogers , came out on 1 August 1844 . 
 Despite Mary Shelley 's attempts to assist Gatteschi financially , he tried to blackmail her one year later in 1845 using indiscreet letters she had written . After not hearing from Gatteschi for months , she received threatening letters , which claimed that she had promised him financial success and even possibly marriage . He claimed that her letters would demonstrate this . The contents of Mary Shelley 's letters are unknown as they were later destroyed , but she must have felt some danger , for she took great pains to recover the letters and wrote agonised letters to her friends : " [ The letters ] were written with an open heart – & contain details with regard to my past history , which it [ would ] destroy me for ever if they ever saw light . " Shelley turned to Alexander Knox for help . After obtaining help from the British government , he travelled to Paris and had the Paris police seize Gatteschi 's correspondence . <unk> that Gatteschi was a danger to the state , Knox and the Paris police called upon the cabinet noir system in order to retrieve the letters . On 11 October , Le National and Le Constitutionnel reported in outrage that Gatteschi 's personal papers were seized because he was a suspected revolutionary . Mary wrote to Claire that " It is an awful power this seizure " , but she did not regret using it . After Knox retrieved her letters , he burned them . Shelley spent £ 250 of her own money to finance the operation . She was embarrassed by the entire incident . 
 = = Description of text = = 
 The two volumes of Rambles are divided into three parts . Part I , which occupies part of the first volume , describes the four @-@ month trip Mary Shelley took with Percy Florence and his university friends in 1840 . Parts II and III , which comprise the remainder of the first volume and the entirety of the second volume , describe the fourteen @-@ month trip Mary Shelley took with Percy Florence , Alexander Knox , and other university friends in 1842 and 1843 . Part II covers June – August 1842 and Part III covers August 1842 – September 1843 . All three parts are epistolary and cover a wide range of topics : " these include personal narratives of the difficulty of a journey , on her varying health , her budgetary constraint ; comments on whether [ John ] Murray 's guide @-@ book advice as to hotels , routes or sights was reliable ; her subjective responses to the pictures , statues , cities and landscapes she has seen ; reports on her occupations and those of her companions ; historical disquisitions on such topics as the Tyrolean struggle against Napoleon , or the origins of the Carbonari ; and authoritative analysis of the present and future state of Italian literature . " 
 = = = Part I = = = 
 In twelve conversational letters written in the first person , Mary Shelley charts her travels through Europe during 1840 and her reflections on accommodations , scenery , peasants , economic relationships between the classes , art , literature , and memories of her 1814 and 1816 journeys ( recorded in History of a Six Weeks ' Tour ( 1817 ) ) . In the first letter , she muses on her return to Italy : 
 Can it , indeed , be true , that I am about to revisit Italy ? How many years are gone since I quitted that country ! There I left the mortal remains of those beloved — my husband and my children , whose loss changed my whole existence , substituting , for happy peace and the interchange of deep @-@ rooted affections , years of desolate solitude , and a hard struggle with the world ; which only now , as my son is growing up , is brightening into a better day . The name of Italy has magic in its very syllables . 
 After landing in France , Shelley continues to happily anticipate her travels and the benefits she will derive from them . Travelling throughout Germany , she complains about the slowness of travel but is pleased to discover that her memories of the Rhine correspond to the reality . Shelley becomes ill in Germany and pauses at Baden @-@ Baden to recover her health . Fearing Percy Florence 's ( referred to as P – in the text ) love of boats and the water , especially difficult for her after her own husband drowned in a boating accident , she is reluctant to continue to Italy and Lake Como while at the same time desiring to do so . After Shelley recovers her health and spirits , the group proceeds to Italy where she is overcome with nostalgia : 
 To me , indeed , there was something even thrilling and affecting in the aspect of the commonest objects around ... Window @-@ curtains , the very wash @-@ hand stands , they were all such as had been familiar to me in Italy long , long ago . I had not seen them since those young and happy days . Strange and indescribable emotions invaded me ; recollections , long forgotten , arose fresh and strong by mere force of association , produced by those objects being presented to my eye , inspiring a mixture of pleasure and pain , almost amounting to agony . 
 Shelley writes of her overwhelming happiness in Italy and her sadness at having to leave it . At the end of September , her money to return to England fails to arrive , so Percy Florence and his friends return without her . Her funds eventually arrive , and she journeys to England alone . In the letters covering her return journey , she describes the sublime scenery through which she travels , particularly the Simplon Pass and waterfalls in Switzerland . 
 = = = Part II = = = 
 Part II , which consists of eleven conversational letters , covers the first part of Shelley 's trip to Europe in 1842 , specifically her journey from Antwerp to Prague ; the names of her travelling companions are disguised in the text and she rarely alludes to them . She discusses art , sometimes spending several pages describing individual works of art ; the benefits and drawbacks of travel by railway versus carriage ; the German character and habits of the German people ; the history associated with the sights she sees ; the scenery and the weather ; and her problems as a traveller , for example , her inability to speak German , the dirtiness of the inns , and exorbitant pricing for tourists . Shelley begins this section by musing on the benefits of travel : 
 Travelling is occupation as well as amusement , and I firmly believe that renewed health will be the result of frequent change of place . Besides , what can be so delightful as the perpetual novelty — the <unk> current of new ideas suggested by travelling ? We read , to gather thought and knowledge ; travelling is a book of the Creator 's own writing , and imparts <unk> wisdom than the printed words of man . Were I exiled perforce , I might <unk> , for the heart naturally yearns for home . But to adorn that home with recollections ; to fly abroad from the hive , like a bee , and return laden with the sweets of travel — scenes , which haunt the eye — wild adventures , that enliven the imagination — knowledge , to enlighten and free the mind from clinging , deadening prejudices — a wider circle of sympathy with our fellow @-@ creatures ; — these are the uses of travel . 
 Briefly passing through a quick succession of German cities by railway , carriage , and boat , the group arrives at Kissingen , where they decide to remain for a month for Shelley to " take the cure " at the bath . While Shelley believes the waters will be efficacious , she <unk> at the restrictions put on those attempting to better their health , such as rising at five or six and eating no delicacies . Her companions are increasingly frustrated by the schedule and the lack of entertainment at the spa . After leaving Kissingen , the group travels through the area around Weimar , seeing sights associated with Martin Luther and the writers Wieland , Schiller , and Goethe . They continue to Berlin and Dresden , where they spend time viewing art and attending the opera , leaving for Prague in August 1842 .

 Throughout 23 informal letters , Shelley describes her travels from Prague to southern Italy . She ponders the scenery of the areas she passes through , the history of Germany and Italy ( e.g. the <unk> rebellion of April 1809 and the activities of the Carbonari ) , the art of Baroque and Renaissance Italy , the literature of Italy , and offers opinions on Italy 's recent governments , the national character of the German and Italian people , and Catholicism . She also ponders the changes in herself from who she was in the 1820s to who she is in the 1840s , particularly in relation to her grief : 
 Many a scene , which I have since visited and admired , has faded in my mind , as a painting in the Diorama melts away , and another struggles into the changing canvass ; but his road was as distinct in my mind as if traversed yesterday . I will not here dwell on the sad circumstances that clouded my first visit to Venice . Death hovered over the scene . <unk> into myself , with my ' mind 's eye ' I saw those before me long departed ; and I was agitated again by emotions — by passions — and those the deepest a woman 's heart can harbor — a dread to see her child even at that instant expire — which then occupied me .

 = = = History of the travel narrative = = = 
 Rambles is a travel narrative , part of a literary tradition begun in the seventeenth century . Through the sixteenth , seventeenth , and eighteenth centuries , Continental travel was considered educational : young , aristocratic gentlemen completed their studies by learning European languages abroad and visiting foreign courts . In the early seventeenth century , however , the emphasis shifted from classical learning to a focus on gaining experience in the real world , such as knowledge of topography , history , and culture . Detailed travel books , including personal travel narratives , began to be published and became popular in the eighteenth century : over 1 @,@ 000 individual travel narratives and travel <unk> were published between 1660 and 1800 . The empiricism that was driving the scientific revolution spread to travel literature ; for example , Lady Mary Wortley Montagu included information she learned in Turkey regarding smallpox inoculation in her travel letters . By 1742 , critic and essayist Samuel Johnson was recommending that travellers engage in " a moral and ethical study of men and manners " in addition to a scientific study of topography and geography . 
 Over the course of the eighteenth century , the Grand Tour became increasingly popular . Travel to the Continent for Britain 's elite was not only educational but also nationalistic . All aristocratic gentlemen took similar trips and visited similar sites , with the intention of developing an appreciation of Britain from abroad . The Grand Tour was celebrated as educational travel when it involved exchanging scientific information with the intellectual elite , learning about other cultures , and preparing for leadership . However , it was condemned as trivial when the tourist simply purchased curio collectibles , acquired a " superficial social polish " , and pursued fleeting sexual relationships . During the Napoleonic Wars , the Continent was closed to British travellers and the Grand Tour came under increasing criticism , particularly from radicals such as Mary Shelley 's father , William Godwin , who scorned its aristocratic associations . Young Romantic writers criticised its lack of spontaneity ; they celebrated Madame de <unk> 's novel Corinne ( 1807 ) , which depicts proper travel as " immediate , sensitive , and above all [ an ] enthusiastic experience " . 
 Travel literature changed in the 1840s as steam @-@ powered ships and trains made Continental journeys accessible to the middle class . Guidebooks and handbooks were published for this new traveller , who was unfamiliar with the tradition of the Grand Tour . The most famous of these was John Murray 's Handbook for Travellers on the Continent ( 1836 ) . By 1848 , Murray had published 60 such works , which " emphasised comprehensiveness , presenting numerous possible itineraries and including information on geology , history , and art galleries " . Whereas during the Romantic period , travel writers differentiated themselves from mere tourists through the spontaneity and exuberance of their reactions , during the Victorian period , travel writers attempted to legitimise their works through a " discourse of authenticity " . That is , they claimed to have experienced the true culture of an area and their reactions to it were specifically personal , as opposed to the writers of generic guidebooks , whose response was specifically impersonal . 
 = = = Rambles as a travel narrative = = = 
 Mary Shelley 's Rambles both resembles and attempts to separate itself from other travel narratives of the time . Elizabeth Nitchie , in her description of the text , writes , for example , that there is " little novelty either in what [ Shelley ] saw or in her account " of the Alps , the Rhine , or Italy , and Moskal notes that Shelley 's " book participates in the travel @-@ book convention of museum @-@ going " . Although Shelley drew on Murray 's famous handbooks and other guidebooks , she specifically attempted to differentiate her work from these . While Murray 's guidebooks , for example , were generally apolitical , Shelley argues in the preface to Rambles that the uniqueness of her work is in its portrayal of the Italian people from " a political point of view " . Shelley had sold her publisher on the idea of a travel narrative by describing the forthcoming book as " light " and " amusing " , in the style of Samuel Rogers , whose travel narrative of Italy , accompanied by illustrations by J. M. W. Turner , had been a best @-@ seller in the late 1820s . Rogers 's text had avoided politics and focused on picturesque and sublime scenery . Although Shelley dedicated Rambles to Rogers , her preface acknowledged the influence of Lady Morgan , whose travel work , Italy ( 1821 ) , had been vocal in its criticism of Austria 's rule over Italy and had been placed on the papal list of prohibited books . To make her politics more palatable to her audience , however , Shelley often uses analyses of literature and art to <unk> her points . 
 Shelley 's travel narrative , with its " informal " and " subjective " focus on her personal experiences , reflects the Romantic emphasis on the individual . Unlike Augustus <unk> Granville 's The Spas of Germany ( 1837 ) , which exudes a Victorian respect for order , political authority , and careful documentation , Shelley focuses on her own reactions to these experiences . She specifically criticises the surveillance and control methods used at the spas she visited , such as the strict dietary regimens and confiscation of letters . 
 = = = Travel narratives by women writers = = = 
 In choosing to focus her travel narrative on politics , Mary Shelley violated the mid @-@ nineteenth century taboo against women discussing politics , particularly in the public sphere . After the mid @-@ 1790s ( partly as a result of the French Revolution ) , Britain experienced an " antifeminist reaction " and women were increasingly discouraged from writing on so @-@ called " masculine " topics . As Moskal explains , there was a " massive cultural prejudice that equate [ d ] masculinity with mobility " , making travel writing itself a masculine genre ; there was even a " masculinist aesthetic vocabulary " . Women in the late eighteenth century and the early nineteenth century wrote travel narratives anyway , but at a cost . Wollstonecraft is described as asking " men 's questions " when she is curious about her surroundings and both Lady Morgan 's and Elizabeth Barrett Browning 's travel narratives received hostile reviews because they discussed political issues . 
 Both Shelley and her mother , Mary Wollstonecraft , exceeded the bounds of what would have been considered " the normal purview of the female writer " in their travel narratives . Shelley excitedly describes running the rapids in a canoe , for example , and describes the economic status and technological development of the areas she visits . In Paris , she comments on the lack of drains in the streets , in Berlin she visits a steel mill , and throughout the text she describes how the new railways are impacting on travel . Shelley 's travel narrative is marked by a specific " ethic of travel " — that one must learn to sympathise both physically and emotionally with those one encounters . Her travels are sentimental , and travel writing for her is " an exploration of the self through an encounter with the other " . Her language even mirrors that of her mother . Wollstonecraft describes the frontier of Sweden as " the bones of the world waiting to be clothed with everything necessary to give life and beauty " while Shelley describes the Simplon Pass as having " a majestic simplicity that inspired awe ; the naked bones of a gigantic world were here : the elemental substance of fair mother Earth " . 
 Also like her mother , whose Letters from Sweden was foundational to the writing of both History of a Six Weeks ' Tour and Rambles , Shelley emphasised her maternal role in the text . She describes herself as a conventional figure , worrying about her son . Rather than the scandal @-@ ridden young woman of her youth , which she wrote about in the Tour , she is now a demure , respectable , middle @-@ aged woman . 
 = = Themes = = 
 = = = Italian politics = = = 
 Shelley 's stated aim in Rambles is to raise awareness of the political situation in Italy and to convince readers to aid the revolutionaries in their fight for independence . She addresses her readers as English citizens , arguing that they in particular " ought to sympathise in [ the Italians ' ] struggles ; for the aspiration for free institutions all over the world has its source in England " . On a general level , she articulates an " opposition to monarchical government , disapproval of class distinction , abhorrence of slavery and war and their concomitant cruelties " similar to that in her historical novels Valperga ( 1823 ) and Perkin Warbeck ( 1830 ) . The central theme of the second journey is " the tyranny of Austrian and French imperialism , and the abuses of papal and priestly authority " . The solution to Italy 's problems , according to Shelley , is neither " subjugation " nor " revolution " but rather " peaceful mediation " . Ultimately , it is the lessons learned from history that Shelley feels are the most important , which is why she compares the past and present . Rambles articulates the " Whiggish ideology of political gradualism " , and is similar to Wollstonecraft 's Vindication of the Rights of Woman ( 1792 ) in that it argues that " a reformation of culture is necessary to reform oppressive and degrading power relations " . 
 Shelley 's political frame for her travel narrative was a difficult one to sell to readers . Her audience wanted to support the revolutionaries , especially exiles living among them , such as Mazzini , but they were also fearful of the violence of the Carbonari and its nationalist ideology . They connected nationalism to their historic enemy — Napoleonic France . In fact , other travel works published at the time made the argument that Napoleon was responsible for Italian unification . Shelley therefore contends that the Risorgimento is primarily inspired by the English and only secondarily by the French ( she never names Napoleon ) . Shelley writes a history of Italian nationalism acceptable to English readers , in which the French are the tyrants oppressing the rising nation of Italy , which the Carbonari , although violent , has inspired and created . Her readers could therefore comfortably support Italian nationalism without supporting policies reminiscent of Napoleon . She also placed most of her political commentary at the end of the text . As Moskal explains , " Shelley creates a structure in which the reader , having already befriended the traveller for some pages , receives this political matter from a friend , not from a stranger . " She also praises Italian literature , particularly the works of Alessandro Manzoni , Pietro Colletta , and Michele Amari , connecting it to Italian nationalism . 
 In writing about the Italian situation , Shelley is also advocating a general liberal agenda of rights for the working and middle classes , which had been crushed by the Reign of Terror and Napoleon . British reformers could look with hope towards Italy . 
 = = = National character = = = 
 Throughout Rambles , Shelley describes the national character of the peoples she visits . She describes the Italians as having an untapped potential for greatness , particularly the peasants : 
 No one can talk to them without perceiving latent , under ignorance and superstition , great natural abilities , and that heartfelt piety which springs ( as our higher virtues do , ) from the imagination which warms and colours their faith . Poor people ! how I long for a fairy wand which would make them proprietors of the earth which they till , but most not reap . How sad a thing is human society : yet ... it warms my heart when I find the individuals that compose a population , poor , humble , ignorant , misguided , yet endowed with some of the brightest gifts of our nature , and bearing in their faces the stamp of intelligence and feeling . 
 Shelley frequently laments the poor education on offer to Italians , although she hopes this will spur them to revolt . She does not think much of the Germans . In her earlier travels , she had described the Germans as rude and disgusting ; in 1842 , she wrote to her half @-@ sister Claire Clairmont , " I do dislike the Germans — & never wish to visit Germany again — but I would not put this in print — for the surface is all I know . " Rambles contains little commentary on the Germans , therefore , except to say that she was impressed by their public education system . 
 It was how political events affected people that Shelley was most interested in . In her History of a Six Weeks ' Tour , she had paused several times to discuss the effects of war and she does so again with her description of the Hessians in Rambles : 
 When we read of the Hessians in the American war , we have a vague idea that our government called in the aid of foreign mercenaries to subdue the revolved colonies ; an act which roused Lord Chatham to exclaim in the House of Peers , " If I were an American , as I am an Englishman , while a foreign troop was landed in my country I never would lay down my arms , never — never — never ! " We censure the policy of government , we lament the obstinacy of George III , who , exhausting the English levies , had recourse to ' the mercenary sons of <unk> and plunder ; ' and ' devoted the Americans and their possessions to the rapacity of hireling cruelty . ' But our imagination does not transport itself to the homes of the unfortunate Germans ; nor is our abhorrence of the tyranny that sent them to die in another hemisphere awakened . 
 = = = Memory and healing = = = 
 Shelley 's trips to Italy were a way for her to revisit memories of her dead husband , Percy Shelley , and the children they had buried there . Moskal argues that Shelley needed to " expiate " her survivor guilt and Dolan that she needed to recover from a damaging trauma . Shelley writes about this in Rambles , using the trope of a pilgrimage ; she believes that travelling to Italy and revisiting the scenes of her youth will cure her of her depression , writing , " Besides all that Rome itself affords of delightful [ sic ] to the eye and imagination , I revisit it as the bourne of a pious pilgrimage . The treasures of my youth lie buried here . " Shelley 's pilgrimage follows in the tradition of Chaucer as well as the nineteenth @-@ century trend to visit spas for healing , and like most pilgrimage narratives , hers does not relate the journey home . For Shelley , ultimately the most helpful part of travelling and visiting spas was seeing the beautiful scenery . In Rambles , Shelley contends that interacting with picturesque scenery can heal the body . Both the 1840 and 1842 trips followed times of ill health for Shelley and she used them as a way to recover both emotionally and physically . She opens Rambles by describing her poor health and hoping that by travelling her " mind will ... renew the outworn and tattered garments in which it has long been clothed " . 
 Shelley 's first travel narrative and first published work , History of a Six Weeks ' Tour , was published anonymously and was co @-@ written with her husband . Rambles , on the other hand , places Mary Shelley at the centre of the narrative . It tells the story of " the recovery of paradise " and the fears of a mother . Her maternal sorrow is generalised . For example , in discussing the death of her daughter in 1818 , she writes : " I was agitated again by emotions — by passions — and those the deepest a woman 's heart can harbour — a dread to see her child even at that instant expire — which then occupied me " . Connecting these deep feelings to writings by Shakespeare , Wordsworth , Coleridge , and Thomas Holcroft , she argues that intense emotion and environment are intertwined , contending that maternal grief is sublime . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Of Rambles , Mary Shelley wrote to her friend Leigh Hunt : " It seems to me such a wretched piece of work , written much of it in a state of pain that makes me look at its pages now as if written in a dream . " She disliked the work , describing it variously as " a poor affair " and " my poor book " , and claimed that Gatteschi had written the best parts . There are no statistics on the sales of the book , but it received at least seventeen reviews . In general , the reviews were favourable ; as Moskal explains , " with nationalist movements simmering in Europe , to culminate in the revolutions of 1848 , reviewers took Rambles seriously as a political as well as a literary endeavour . " 
 Reviewers praised the work as " entertaining , thoughtful and eminently readable " , although some thought it was too mournful in places . Separating Shelley 's travel memoir from the new guidebooks and handbooks , reviews such as that from the Atlas , praised her " rich fancy , her intense love of nature , and her sensitive apprehension of all that is good , and beautiful and free " . They praised its independence of thought , wit , and feeling . Shelley 's commentary on the social and political life of Italy , which was generally thought superior to the German sections , caused one reviewer to call the book the work of " a woman who thinks for herself on all subjects , and who dares to say what she thinks " , a woman with a " masculine and original mind " . Not all reviewers celebrated her independence of mind . The Observer wrote : " With her , as with all women , politics is a matter of the heart , and not as with the more robust nature of man , of the head ... It is an idle and unprofitable theme for a woman . " Most of the reviews responded positively to Shelley 's political aims ; those that were unsympathetic to her political position generally disputed her specific claims . For example , one reviewer claimed that Italy had been improved by Austrian rule . 
 For most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries , Mary Shelley was known as the author of Frankenstein and the wife of famous Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley . As late as 1961 , Rambles had never been reprinted and , as scholar Elizabeth Nitchie explained , " scant use has been made of it , and copies of it are rather scarce . " However , she argued that some of Mary Shelley 's " best writing " was in Rambles . Novelist Muriel Spark agreed in her book on Shelley , writing that Rambles " contains more humour and liveliness than occur in anything else she wrote " . In the 1970s , with the rise of feminist literary criticism , scholars began to pay attention to Shelley 's other works . With the publication of scholarship by Mary Poovey and Anne K. Mellor in the 1980s , Mary Shelley 's " other " works — her short stories , essays , reviews , dramas , biographies , travel narratives , and other novels — began to be recognised as literary achievements . In the 1990s , Mary Shelley 's entire corpus , including Rambles , was reprinted . 
 = Macbeth , King of Scotland = 
 Mac Bethad mac Findlaích ( Modern Gaelic : <unk> mac <unk> ; Medieval Gaelic : Mac Bethad mac Findlaích ; anglicised as Macbeth , and nicknamed Rí <unk> , " the Red King " ; died 15 August 1057 ) was King of the Scots ( also known as the King of Alba , and earlier as King of Moray and King of Fortriu ) from 1040 until his death . Recent evidence is indicating he spent much of his time in and around the Forres area of Moray , defeating his cousin Duncan , then king of Moray , in battle at nearby <unk> . He is best known as the subject of William Shakespeare 's tragedy Macbeth and the many works it has inspired , although the play is not an accurate portrait of the historical king . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The name Mac Bethad ( or , in modern Gaelic , <unk> ) , from which the anglicized " MacBeth " is derived , means " son of life " . Although it has the appearance of a Gaelic patronymic it does not have any meaning of filiation but instead carries an implication of " righteous man " or " religious man " . An alternative proposed derivation is that it is a corruption of <unk> @-@ <unk> meaning " one of the elect " . 
 = = Royal ancestry = = 
 Some sources make Macbeth a grandson of King Malcolm II and thus a cousin to Duncan I whom he succeeded . He was possibly also a cousin to Thorfinn the Mighty , Earl of Orkney and Caithness . Some historians claim , however , that Macbeth was Thorfinn 's half @-@ brother rather than his cousin . Much depends on whether Malcolm had three daughters or only two ( one of whom married twice ) – a point which is likely to remain uncertain . 
 = = Mormaer and dux = = 
 When Cnut the Great came north in 1031 to accept the submission of King Malcolm II , Macbeth too submitted to him : 
 ... Malcolm , king of the Scots , submitted to him , and became his man , with two other kings , Macbeth and <unk> ... 
 Some have seen this as a sign of Macbeth 's power ; others have seen his presence , together with <unk> , who may be Echmarcach mac Ragnaill , as proof that Malcolm II was overlord of Moray and of the Kingdom of the Isles . Whatever the true state of affairs in the early 1030s , it seems more probable that Macbeth was subject to the king of Alba , Malcolm II , who died at Glamis , on 25 November 1034 . The Prophecy of <unk> , apparently alone in near contemporary sources , says Malcolm died a violent death , calling it a " <unk> " without actually naming his killers . Tigernach 's chronicle says only : 
 Máel Coluim son of Cináed , king of Alba , the honour of western Europe , died . 
 Malcolm II 's grandson Duncan ( Donnchad mac Crínáin ) , later King Duncan I , was acclaimed as king of Alba on 30 November 1034 , apparently without opposition . Duncan appears to have been <unk> ríg , the king in waiting , so that far from being an abandonment of <unk> , as has sometimes been argued , his kingship was a vindication of the practice . Previous successions had involved strife between various <unk> – men of royal blood . Far from being the aged King Duncan of Shakespeare 's play , the real King Duncan was a young man in 1034 , and even at his death in 1040 his youthfulness is remarked upon . 
 Because of his youth , Duncan 's early reign was apparently uneventful . His later reign , in line with his description as " the man of many sorrows " in the Prophecy of Berchán , was not successful . In 1039 , Strathclyde was attacked by the Northumbrians , and a retaliatory raid led by Duncan against Durham turned into a disaster . Duncan survived the defeat , but the following year he led an army north into Moray , Macbeth 's domain , apparently on a punitive expedition against Moray . There he was killed in action , at <unk> , now <unk> , near Elgin , by the men of Moray led by Macbeth , probably on 14 August 1040 . 
 = = High King of Alba = = 
 On Duncan 's death , Macbeth became king . No resistance is known at that time , but it would have been entirely normal if his reign were not universally accepted . In 1045 , Duncan 's father Crínán of Dunkeld ( a scion of the Scottish branch of the Cenel Conaill and Hereditary Abbot of Iona ) was killed in a battle between two Scottish armies . 
 John of Fordun wrote that Duncan 's wife fled Scotland , taking her children , including the future kings Malcolm III ( Máel Coluim mac Donnchada ) and Donald III ( Domnall Bán mac Donnchada , or Donalbane ) with her . On the basis of the author 's beliefs as to whom Duncan married , various places of exile , Northumbria and Orkney among them , have been proposed . However , E. William Robertson proposes the safest place for Duncan 's widow and her children would be with her or Duncan 's kin and supporters in Atholl . 
 After the defeat of Crínán , Macbeth was evidently unchallenged . Marianus Scotus tells how the king made a pilgrimage to Rome in 1050 , where , Marianus says , he gave money to the poor as if it were seed . 
 = = = Karl Hundason = = = 
 The Orkneyinga Saga says that a dispute between Thorfinn Sigurdsson , Earl of Orkney , and Karl Hundason began when Karl Hundason became " King of Scots " and claimed Caithness . The identity of Karl Hundason , unknown to Scots and Irish sources , has long been a matter of dispute , and it is far from clear that the matter is settled . The most common assumption is that Karl Hundason was an insulting byname ( Old Norse for " <unk> , son of a Dog " ) given to Macbeth by his enemies . William Forbes Skene 's suggestion that he was Duncan I of Scotland has been revived in recent years . Lastly , the idea that the whole affair is a poetic invention has been raised . 
 According to the Orkneyinga Saga , in the war which followed , Thorfinn defeated Karl in a sea @-@ battle off Deerness at the east end of the Orkney Mainland . Then Karl 's nephew <unk> or <unk> , appointed to rule Caithness for him , was killed at Thurso by Thorkel the <unk> . Finally , a great battle at Tarbat Ness on the south side of the Dornoch Firth ended with Karl defeated and fugitive or dead . Thorfinn , the saga says , then marched south through Scotland as far as Fife , burning and plundering as he passed . A later note in the saga claims that Thorfinn won nine Scottish earldoms . 
 Whoever Karl Hundason may have been , it appears that the saga is reporting a local conflict with a Scots ruler of Moray or Ross : 
 [ T ] he whole narrative is consistent with the idea that the struggle of Thorfinn and Karl is a continuation of that which had been waged since the ninth century by the Orkney earls , notably Sigurd Rognvald 's son , Ljot , and Sigurd the Stout , against the princes or mormaers of Moray , Sutherland , Ross , and Argyll , and that , in fine , Malcolm and Karl were mormaers of one of these four provinces . 
 = = = Final years = = = 
 In 1052 , Macbeth was involved indirectly in the strife in the Kingdom of England between Godwin , Earl of Wessex and Edward the Confessor when he received a number of Norman exiles from England in his court , perhaps becoming the first king of Scots to introduce feudalism to Scotland . In 1054 , Edward 's Earl of Northumbria , Siward , led a very large invasion of Scotland ( Duncan 's widow and Malcolm 's mother , <unk> , was Northumbrian @-@ born ; it is probable but not proven that there was a family tie between Siward and Malcolm ) . The campaign led to a bloody battle in which the Annals of Ulster report 3 @,@ 000 Scots and 1 @,@ 500 English dead , which can be taken as meaning very many on both sides , and one of Siward 's sons and a son @-@ in @-@ law were among the dead . The result of the invasion was that one Máel Coluim , " son of the king of the Cumbrians " ( not to be confused with Máel Coluim mac Donnchada , the future Malcolm III of Scotland ) was restored to his throne , i.e. , as ruler of the kingdom of Strathclyde . It may be that the events of 1054 are responsible for the idea , which appears in Shakespeare 's play , that Malcolm III was put in power by the English . 
 Macbeth did not survive the English invasion for long , for he was defeated and mortally wounded or killed by the future Malcolm III ( " King Malcolm Ceann @-@ mor " , son of Duncan I ) on the north side of the Mounth in 1057 , after retreating with his men over the <unk> Pass to take his last stand at the battle at Lumphanan . The Prophecy of Berchán has it that he was wounded and died at Scone , sixty miles to the south , some days later . Macbeth 's stepson Lulach was installed as king soon after . 
 Unlike later writers , no near contemporary source remarks on Macbeth as a tyrant . The Duan Albanach , which survives in a form dating to the reign of Malcolm III , calls him " Mac Bethad the renowned " . The Prophecy of Berchán , a verse history which purports to be a prophecy , describes him as " the generous king of Fortriu " , and says : 
 The red , tall , golden @-@ haired one , he will be pleasant to me among them ; Scotland will be <unk> west and east during the reign of the furious red one . 
 = = Life to legend = = 
 Macbeth 's life , like that of King Duncan I , had progressed far towards legend by the end of the 14th century , when John of Fordun and Andrew of Wyntoun wrote their histories . Hector Boece , Walter Bower , and George Buchanan all contributed to the legend . 
 = = = William Shakespeare 's depiction and its influence = = = 
 In Shakespeare 's play , which is based mainly upon Raphael Holinshed 's account , Macbeth is initially a valorous and loyal general to the elderly King Duncan . After being flattered by Three Witches and his own wife , Macbeth rationalizes that murdering his king and usurping the throne is the right thing to do . Ultimately , however , the prophecies of the witches prove misleading , and Macbeth alienates the nobility of Scotland and is defeated in battle by Prince Malcolm . As the King 's armies disintegrate he encounters Macduff , a refugee nobleman whose wife and children had earlier been murdered by Macbeth 's death squads . Upon realizing that he will die if he duels Macduff , Macbeth at first refuses to do so . But when Macduff explains that if Macbeth surrenders he will be subjected to ridicule by his former subjects , Macbeth vows , " I will not yield to kiss the ground before young Malcolm 's feet , to be baited by a rabble 's curse . " He chooses instead to fight Macduff to the death . Macbeth is then slain and beheaded and the play ends with Prince Malcolm planning his coronation at Scone . 
 The likely reason for Shakespeare 's unflattering depiction of Macbeth is that King James VI and I was descended from Malcolm III via the <unk> kings , the House of Bruce and his own House of Stewart whereas Macbeth 's line died out with the death of Lulach six months after his step @-@ father . He was also thought to be a descendant of Banquo through Walter Stewart , 6th High Steward of Scotland . Shakespeare was too astute to risk causing any offence to his own monarch . 
 In a 1959 essay , Boris Pasternak compared Shakespeare 's Macbeth to Raskolnikov , the protagonist of Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky . Pasternak explained that neither character begins as a murderer , but becomes one by a set of faulty rationalizations and a belief that they are above the law . 
 Lady Macbeth has gained fame along the way . In his 1865 novel Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District , Nikolai Leskov updated The Tragedy of Macbeth so that it takes place among the Imperial Russian merchant class . In an ironic twist , however , Leskov reverses the gender roles – the woman is the murderer and the man is the instigator . Leskov 's novel was the basis for Dmitri Shostakovich 's 1936 opera of the same name .

 In modern times , Dorothy Dunnett 's novel King Hereafter aims to portray a historical Macbeth , but proposes that Macbeth and his rival and sometime ally Thorfinn of Orkney are one and the same ( Thorfinn is his birth name and Macbeth his baptismal name ) . John Cargill Thompson 's play Macbeth Speaks 1997 , a reworking of his earlier Macbeth Speaks , is a monologue delivered by the historical Macbeth , aware of what Shakespeare and posterity have done to him .

 A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New Testament : For the Use of Biblical Students is one of the books of Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener ( 1813 – 1891 ) , biblical scholar and textual critic . In this book Scrivener listed over 3 @,@ 000 Greek manuscripts of the New Testament , as well as manuscripts of early versions . It was used by Gregory for further work . 
 The book was published in four editions . The first edition , published in 1861 , contained 506 pages . The second edition ( 1874 ) was expanded into 626 pages ; the third into 751 pages ; and the fourth into 874 pages . Two first editions were issued in one volume ; in the third edition the material was divided into two volumes , with an increased number of chapters in each . The first volume was edited in 1883 , the second in 1887 . The fourth edition was also issued in two volumes ( 1894 ) . The fourth edition of the book was reprinted in 2005 by <unk> Classics . 
 = = First Edition = = 
 The text of the first edition was divided into nine chapters and three Indices were added at the end ( pp. 465 – 490 ) . All plates were placed at the end of book ( after Indices ) . The main part of the work are descriptions of the manuscripts . Scrivener concentrated his attention on the most important manuscripts ( especially five larger uncial codices ) . The later cursive manuscripts were too numerous to be minutely described as per the uncials . Scrivener described them with all possible brevity , dwelling only on a few which presented points of special interest and used a system of certain abbreviations . Lists of this abbreviations was included just before the Catalogue of cursive manuscripts . Examples of abbreviations , include : 
 Act . — MS. of Acts and Catholic epistles 
 Am . — the Ammonian Sections 
 <unk> . — the Eusebian Canons 
 <unk> t . — a table of the Eusebian Canons 
 Carp . — <unk> ad <unk> 
 <unk> . — the numbers of the κεφαλαια majora stand in the margin 
 <unk> t . — the tables of the κεφαλαια are prefixed to each book 
 <unk> . — the τιτλοι are given at the head or foot of the page 
 <unk> . — the book is adapted for Church @-@ reading by notices of the proper lessons , feasts etc. in the margin , or above , or below 
 men . — a menology , calendar of Saints ' Days , is found at the beginning or end of the book 
 syn . — Synaxarion , a calendar of the daily lessons throughout the year is given 
 mut . — the copy described is mutilated 
 <unk> . — the copy is illuminated with pictures 
 <unk> . — contains prolegomena before the several books 
 In every next edition of the Plain Introduction this system of abbreviations was expanded ( e.g. <unk> . , Argent . , etc . ) . At the end of lists the manuscripts are described more shortly , in two columns , only numbers of the manuscripts , with the corresponding number of other system of <unk> ( Scholz ) : 
 In the preface to the first edition , the editor announced : 
 The following pages are chiefly designed for the use of those who have no previous knowledge of the Textual Criticism of the New Testament ; but since the Author has endeavoured to embody in them the results of very recent investigations , he hopes that they may prove of service to more advanced students . He asks the reader 's indulgence for the annexed list of <unk> et <unk> , both by reason of the peculiar character of his work , and the remoteness of West Cornwall from Public Libraries . He might easily have suppressed the greater part of them , but that he has honestly tried to be accurate , and sees no cause to be ashamed of what Person has well called " the common lot of authorship . " He has only to add that he has not consciously borrowed from other writers without due acknowledgement , and to return his best thanks to the Rev. H. O. Coxe for important aid in the Bodleian , and to Henry Bradshaw Esq . , Fellow of King 's College , for valuable instruction respecting manuscripts in the University Library at Cambridge .

 In 1873 Dean Burgon in The Guardian published several articles with some suggestions , corrections , and encouragement for preparing the second edition of Plain Introduction . Burgon gave a photograph of the Codex Basilensis for the sake of the next edition ( the facsimile from the first edition was a poor quality ) . 
 The second edition was published in 1874 . The number of chapters was still the same , but they were expanded ( especially chapter II and IX ) . Many corrections to the third section of the second chapter were made after suggestions of : H. Bradshaw , Hort , Vansittart , Kelly , and Burgon . In preface to the first edition , the editor announced : 
 The first edition of this work , published in 1861 , was received so favourably that the author has felt bound to bestow his utmost care upon a minute and thorough revision of his book , in the hope of bringing up the information it contains to the existing state of knowledge . In this endeavour he has been assisted as well by Canon Lightfoot , to whom he is indebted for that section of the third chapter which treats of Egyptian versions of the New Testament ( pp. 319 @-@ 357 ) , as also by much unsought for and most welcome help , especially on the part of those scholars who are named in p . 164 , note . Without wishing to speak harshly of writers who are not very scrupulous in such matters , he has always thought it became him to borrow from no quarter without making a full and frank avowal of the fact . The author will be much rejoiced if this new edition shall be judged not less worthy than its predecessor to become a text book in Universities and Theological <unk> . 
 S. Gerrans , August , 1861 . 
 = = Third edition = = 
 In August , 1874 , Ezra Abbot sent to Scrivener a letter : the rough draught of which covered forty odd pages , devoted to the correction of apparent errors and a statement of overlooked facts in the first edition of the Plain Introduction . The letter came too late to be used in preparing the body of the second edition of Scrivener 's work . Abbot 's studies largely <unk> the number of suggestions , particularly in those portions of the book devoted to describing the extant manuscripts . They were accumulated in great part to the older and well @-@ known authorities - such as Griesbach , Matthaei , Scholz ( particularly his work <unk> @-@ <unk> Reise , Leipzig 1823 ) , <unk> , Montfaucon , Silvestre , Bandini , <unk> , and <unk> . Part of suggestions were a result of Abbott 's studies of recent edited Catalogues of the ancient Greek Manuscripts held in the British Museum , Bodleian Library , Oxford Catalogues , Kitchin 's Catalogue of the manuscripts in the Library of Christ Church College ( <unk> , 1867 ) . Abbott added numerous references to facsimile editions . 
 In 1885 J. Rendel Harris , together with Abbot , prepared the similar work as the first unpublished work of Abbot , nine years earlier . It was published under the title : Notes on Scriveners ' " Plain introduction to the criticism of the New Testament , " 3rd edition , in which they proposed corrections . Example of corrections : 
 Page XII . On " p . 69 @.@ note " , line 2 , for " 360 " read " 1160 " . 
 Page XIII . On " p . 141 , line 28 " , line 2 , for " Vol . II . , Part I. " read " Part I , Vol . II . " . At <unk> add " after p . 492 . "

 On " p . 162 , line 24 " , line 2 , for " Vol . II . , Pt . I. " read " Pt . I. Vol . II . " 
 The third edition was issued into two volumes , with an increase of chapters in each ( XIV + XII ) . 
 The third edition was prepared under great disadvantage . Scrivener after adding 125 pages to his book had an attack of paralysis , as result his work was not wholly conducted upon the same high level as his previous publications . The framework of the second edition was originally adopted ; and the new additional material was only added to the almost unchanged material . 
 = = Fourth edition = = 
 The fourth and the last edition of Plain Introduction was prepared and edited posthumously by Edward Miller ( 1825 – 1901 ) . The book was edited by George Bell & Sons . It contains 15 plates with the texts of 40 manuscripts in facsimile ( the 1st edition had 12 plates with 36 manuscripts ) . Some facsimiles were replaced . Instead of 2 @,@ 094 manuscripts , as recorded in the third edition under six classes , no less than 3 @,@ 791 were recorded in this edition , an increase of 236 beyond the 3 @,@ 555 of Gregory , without counting the numerous vacant places which had been filled <unk> . 
 Most of the accounts of ancient versions were rewritten by distinguished scholars , who were leaders in their several departments . The early part of Volume I was enriched from the admirable book on “ Greek and Latin Palaeography ” , by Edward <unk> Thompson . Many corrections suggested by eminent scholars were introduced in different places throughout the book . H. J. White rewrote the chapter on Latin versions . G. H. Gwilliam , editor of the Peshitta , helped to improve the passages on the Peshitta and the Curetonian Version . H. Deane made an additions to the treatment of the <unk> Version . A. C. Headlam made a revision of the long chapter on the Egyptian versions ; F. C. Conybeare , rewrote the sections on the Armenian and Georgian versions ; <unk> rewrote the sections on the Arabic and <unk> versions ; J. M. Bebb rewrote the section on the Slavonic version ; James W. Bright rewrote the section on the Anglo @-@ Saxon Version .

 Edward Miller , the editor of the 4th edition , in 1886 estimated the 3rd edition : 
 The labour spent by Dr. Scrivener upon Textual Criticism is well known from his admirable Introduction to the Science , a handbook which leaves hardly anything , if anything , to be desired . 
 Eberhard Nestle , editor of Novum Testamentum Graece , wrote in 1901 : 
 Scrivener have rendered great service in the way of collating manuscripts , ( ... ) as well as Gregory in Germany has also catalogued them . 
 Gregory , another textual critic , in his Textkritik des Neuen Testaments ( 1900 – 1909 ) very often cited work of Scrivener , but after Minuscule 449 he used different way of numbering for the manuscripts ( Scrivener 450 
 = Gregory 581 , Scrivener 451 = 
 Gregory 582 ) . A Plain Introduction ... was also used by Hermann von Soden in his Schriften ....

 The Bella Twins were a professional wrestling tag team which performed on WWE and consisted of twin sisters Brie and Nikki Bella . 
 They are both former WWE Divas Champions , with Nikki 's second reign of 301 days being the longest in the title 's history . In November 2015 , Nikki was ranked # 1 in Pro Wrestling Illustrated 's Female 50 in 2015 . Brie announced that she was taking an extended break from in @-@ ring action in April 2016 .

 Born sixteen minutes apart to parents Jon Garcia and Kathy <unk> , Brianna and Nicole were born in San Diego , California and raised on a farm in Scottsdale , Arizona . They are of Mexican and Italian descent . Keen soccer enthusiasts , they both played for Scottsdale clubs from second grade . In third grade , the girls were separated into different classes by their mother to allow for more independence . The twins graduated from Chaparral High School in 2002 . They both returned to San Diego for college , where Nicole played soccer for Grossmont College , but relocated to Los Angeles a year later , where they worked as waitresses at the Mondrian Hotel while trying to find an agent . 
 They then started modeling , acting , and doing promotional work . They made their first national TV appearance on the Fox reality show Meet My Folks . Following this appearance , the Garcia twins were hired to be the World Cup Twins for Budweiser and were photographed holding the World Cup trophy . They were contestants in the 2006 " International Body Doubles twins search " . They participated in the 2006 WWE Diva Search but did not make the cut .

 Brianna and Nicole were signed to developmental contracts by World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) in June 2007 and were assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling ( FCW ) , WWE 's then @-@ developmental territory , in Tampa , Florida . On September 15 , 2007 , the twins made their in @-@ ring debut . Dubbed The Bella Twins , they defeated Nattie Neidhart and Krissy Vaine with Victoria Crawford as the special guest referee . The duo quickly started a scripted rivalry with Neidhart and Crawford , and had a series of matches against them throughout October 2007 . As a part of their on @-@ screen personas , they switched places behind the referee 's back if one of them was hurt . This was called " Twin Magic " . They also occasionally competed in mixed tag team matches , teaming with male wrestlers including Kofi Kingston and Robert Anthony . They also made some non @-@ wrestling appearances on Heath Miller 's Happy Hour promo segment . 
 Starting in December 2007 , they managed Derrick Linkin , but this storyline was cut short when Linkin was released in January 2008 . They then resumed their feud with Neidhart and Crawford , wrestling them throughout much of 2008 . After Neidhart was called up to the WWE roster in April 2008 , Milena <unk> took her place in the feud . The twins also competed in bikini contests , and wrestled against other competitors including Katie Lea Burchill and Daisy . Their last FCW appearance was on September 2 , when they competed in a Divas battle royal won by Miss Angela .

 On the August 29 , 2008 episode of SmackDown , Brianna debuted as Brie Bella and defeated Victoria . She quickly began a scripted rivalry with Victoria and Victoria 's accomplice , Natalya , and had a series of matches against them . In each match , Brie would roll out of the ring and go underneath it , emerging and appearing revived , and then win the match . On the October 31 episode of SmackDown , when Brie went under the ring Victoria grabbed her legs , but a second pair of legs kicked her off , implying that a second person was under the ring . The following week on SmackDown , Brie picked up a win against Victoria and then ran under the ring to escape Natalya and Victoria , but Victoria and Natalya both reached for Brie under the ring , resulting in both Nicole and Brie being pulled out . The twins then attacked them and celebrated afterward . Nicole was then introduced as Nikki Bella . The twins had their first official match as a team on the November 21 episode of SmackDown , defeating Victoria and Natalya . They continued competing in tag team matches over the following months . 
 Starting in November , the twins developed an on @-@ screen relationship with The Colóns ( Carlito and Primo ) , appearing in numerous backstage segments with them , and accompanying them to the ring . In February 2009 , the storyline expanded to include John Morrison and The Miz , who flirted with the Bellas and took them on a date for Valentine 's Day . The date provoked a rivalry between the teams of The Miz and Morrison and Primo and Carlito , with the four competing for the affection of the twins , who were seemingly unable to choose between them . On March 17 , on ECW , Carlito and Primo , aiming for Morrison and The Miz , accidentally spat apples in the face of Brie . Nikki began to laugh at Brie 's misfortune , and a fight broke out between the two , which led to Nikki leaving with The Miz and Morrison , while Brie stayed with Primo and Carlito . Brie won her first match over Nikki in a six @-@ person intergender tag team match on SmackDown the following week . On ECW on March 31 , Nikki pinned Brie in their first singles match against each other , after a distraction from Morrison and The Miz . 
 On April 15 , 2009 , The Bella Twins were both drafted to the Raw brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft . On April 27 , Brie made her Raw in @-@ ring debut in an eight @-@ Diva tag team match , which her team won . Nikki also made an appearance , reuniting with her twin , as she was under the ring to help Brie during the match . Nikki then made her in @-@ ring debut for the brand the following month in a battle royal , but was eliminated by Beth Phoenix . 
 On June 29 , 2009 , they were both traded to the ECW brand . They debuted on ECW the following night on The Abraham Washington Show , as the special guests . They quickly developed a storyline feud with Katie Lea Burchill , when Nikki defeated her in a match by switching places with Brie behind the referee 's back . The following week on Superstars , Brie defeated Burchill after a similar fashion , and the feud ended in September , when Nikki defeated Burchill on Superstars . 
 On October 12 , the Bellas were traded back to Raw as part of a tri @-@ branded Divas trade , where they predominately appeared in backstage segments with the weekly guest stars and only occasionally competed in matches . On the January 4 , 2010 , episode of Raw , Brie participated in a tournament for the vacant WWE Divas Championship , but lost to Maryse in the first round , when a switch resulted in Nikki being pinned . In June 2010 , they developed a feud with Jillian Hall , when Brie defeated her after switching places with Nikki . The following week , Nikki defeated Hall after switching with Brie . The feud was exacerbated when the Bellas acted as the special guest referees during one of Hall 's matches . During the match , Hall attacked both twins , but lost the match when Nikki made a fast count , allowing her to be pinned by Gail Kim . The next week on Superstars , the twins defeated Hall and Maryse in a tag team match to end the storyline . 
 On August 31 , The Bella Twins announced they would be part of the all @-@ female third season of NXT , mentoring Jamie . Jamie was the first rookie Diva eliminated on the October 5 episode of NXT . In November , the twins began a storyline with Daniel Bryan , when Brie accompanied him to the ring for his match . Following his win , Nikki ran out and the two fought over Bryan 's affection , until Bryan broke it up and had them hug each other . They began to manage Bryan and frequently accompanied him to the ring over the next two months . In January 2011 , both Bellas turned into villainous characters , when they discovered Bryan kissing Gail Kim backstage and assaulted her . They continued to attack Kim , both at the Royal Rumble and on Raw , and on February 7 , they teamed with Melina in a losing effort to Kim , Eve Torres , and Tamina .

 The Bellas began feuding with Eve Torres after they appeared as <unk> during a Divas Championship match between Torres and Natalya on the February 14 episode of Raw . Following the match , they attacked Torres backstage before Gail Kim and Natalya stopped them . The next week , the twins defeated Torres and Kim in a tag team match . The following week , Nikki won a battle royal to become the number one contender for the Divas Championship , and unsuccessfully challenged Torres for the championship on March 7 . 
 On April 11 , Brie defeated Torres to win the Divas Championship , marking the first time either twin had held a championship in WWE . Brie went on to successfully defend the championship against Kelly Kelly at Over the Limit , after switching places with Nikki . On a special " Power to the People " episode of Raw on June 20 , Brie defended her WWE Divas Championship against Kelly , who was selected by voters . Kelly then defeated Brie and won the championship . On July 17 , Brie challenged Kelly for the championship in a rematch at Money in the Bank , but failed to win . 
 The twins spent the majority of the rest of the year in tag team matches , regularly facing Kelly and Torres . The Bellas began to show friction for the second time since joining WWE in March 2012 , after both twins lost to AJ Lee in singles competition . After Brie 's match with Lee , Nikki revealed that Brie was rooting for Team Johnny in the 12 @-@ man tag team match at WrestleMania XXVIII , whilst Nikki was rooting for Team Teddy , thus furthering their dissension . 
 On the April 6 episode of SmackDown , Nikki defeated the Divas Champion Beth Phoenix in a non @-@ title match , after Kelly Kelly distracted Phoenix . On April 23 , Nikki defeated Phoenix in a lumberjill match on Raw to win the Divas Championship for the first time . Brie lost Nikki 's championship to Layla at Extreme Rules after Twin Magic failed , ending her Divas Championship reign after only a week . The following night on Raw , they competed in their last match with the WWE , failing to win back the Divas Championship from Layla in a triple threat match . Later that night , WWE announced on their website that the twins had been fired by Executive Administrator Eve Torres .

On the March 15 episode of SmackDown , the twins attacked The Funkadactyls ( Cameron and Naomi ) , and the following week interfered in matches between Team Rhodes Scholars and Brodus Clay and Tensai , but were attacked by The Funkadactyls . The twins made their in – ring return facing and defeating The Funkadactyls on the March 27 episode of Main Event after interference from Cody Rhodes , and also defeated them on Raw five days later . The Bella Twins were scheduled to participate in an eight – person tag team match with Team Rhodes Scholars against Tons of Funk ( Clay and Tensai ) and The Funkadactyls at WrestleMania 29 , but the match was cancelled due to time restraints , and instead took place the following night on Raw , where The Bella Twins and Team Rhodes <unk> were defeated . The twins continued their feud with The Funkadactyls throughout April , defeating them in standard tag team , and six – Diva tag team matches . In June , Nikki suffered a fractured tibia . 
 Upon the debut of the Total Divas reality television program in July , The Bellas began feud with their co – star on the show , Natalya . Brie and Natalya went on to trade victories in singles competition on Raw and at SummerSlam . The cast of Total Divas then transitioned into a scripted feud with Divas Champion AJ Lee , who mocked the show and cast . At Night of Champions , Brie unsuccessfully challenged Lee for the Divas Championship in a four @-@ way match , which also involved Natalya and Naomi . Following Brie 's real @-@ life engagement to Daniel Bryan , their relationship began to be acknowledged on WWE television . Continuing their feud into October , Brie and AJ Lee faced off at the Battleground and Hell in a Cell pay @-@ per @-@ views for the Divas Championship , but Brie was unsuccessful . Nikki returned to in @-@ ring action on the October 25 episode of SmackDown , losing to Lee . At Survivor Series the following month , the twins were part of the victorious Team Total Divas . The twins failed to win the Divas Championship again at WrestleMania XXX in the Divas Invitational match , which was won by AJ Lee . 
 = = = = Feud with Stephanie McMahon and brief split ( 2014 ) = = = = 
 In April 2014 , Brie became involved in her real @-@ life husband Daniel Bryan 's ongoing storyline with Stephanie McMahon and Kane , where as part of the storyline , McMahon threatened to fire Brie if an injured Bryan did not relinquish the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Payback , which forced Brie to " quit " WWE before slapping McMahon in the face . After Brie quit , McMahon put Nikki in several handicap matches as punishment . After a month absence , Brie returned to WWE television , appearing in the crowd on July 21 ; following a confrontation , McMahon slapped Brie and was subsequently arrested . In order to have Brie drop the " charges " , Brie was rehired and received a match against McMahon at SummerSlam . 
 At the pay – per – view , Nikki turned villainous by attacking Brie , which allowed McMahon to win the match . The next several weeks saw the twins fight in several backstage and in @-@ ring segments , including a cameo appearance from Jerry Springer on Raw on September 8 . As part of the storyline , McMahon declared Nikki the face of the WWE Divas division and granted her a match at Night of Champions for the WWE Divas Championship , which she failed to win . Nikki then obtained permission to begin forcing Brie to compete in handicap matches , similar to her punishment at the hands of McMahon , although Brie was able to win them . This led to a match between the twins at Hell in a Cell , where the loser was forced to become the winner 's personal assistant for 30 days , in which Nikki defeated Brie . Five days later on SmackDown , Nikki won a Halloween costume battle royal to become the number one contender for the Divas Championship . 
 = = = = Divas Champion and Team Bella ( 2014 – 2015 ) = = = = 
 Nikki received her title match against AJ Lee on November 23 at Survivor Series , which she won , with Brie 's help , to become a two – time Divas Champion . The duo had reconciled at this point , with Brie also turning heel in the process . Nikki then went on to retain her championship in three separate occasions — against Lee in a rematch on December 14 , at TLC : Tables , Ladders and Chairs , against Naomi two days later on SmackDown and against Paige at Fastlane on February 22 , 2015 . Paige and AJ then formed an alliance against Bellas which led to a tag team match at WrestleMania 31 , where AJ and Paige were victorious . 
 On April 26 , after Nikki , with the help of Brie , once again retained her title against Naomi at Extreme Rules a feud started , with Naomi aligning with the returning Tamina ( Naomi 's real life husband Jimmy Uso 's real life cousin ) to even the odds against Bellas , who began showing more heroic characteristics , This change in character was criticized as " sudden " , " randomly " and " for no reason " . This led to a tag team match between the two teams on May 17 , at Payback , which Naomi and Tamina won . Two weeks later , at Elimination Chamber , Nikki retained her title against Naomi and Paige in a triple – threat match , with Brie banned from ringside . 
 In June , The Bella Twins became villains once again by employing Twin Magic , which helped Nikki retain the title against Paige on the June 1 episode of Raw and at Money in the Bank . During the feud with Paige , Alicia Fox allied with them to form Team Bella . At the The Beast in the East on July 4 , Nikki retained the title against Paige and Tamina . After weeks of Team Bella outnumbering Paige , Naomi , and Tamina , Stephanie McMahon called for a " revolution " in the WWE Divas division and introduced the debuting Charlotte and Becky Lynch as Paige 's allies . NXT Women 's Champion Sasha Banks debuted as an ally to Naomi and Tamina , which led to a brawl between the three teams . Nikki then lost to Charlotte in a tag team match on the August 3 episode of Raw , and to Sasha on the August 17 episode of Raw in a non – title match . The three teams faced off on August 23 at SummerSlam in a three team elimination match , in which Team Bella first eliminated Team B.A.D. , before Team PCB 's win . 
 On the September 14 episode of Raw , Nikki defended her title against Charlotte , who pinned Brie after the twins had switched places to win the match , however , since the title can 't change hands by disqualification , Nikki retained the championship , and in the process , became the new longest reigning Divas Champion in history , surpassing AJ Lee 's previous record of 295 days .

 Nikki dropped the championship to Charlotte , on September 20 , at Night of Champions , ending her reign at 301 days , and failed to regain the title in a rematch on October 25 at Hell in a Cell . Shortly after , Nikki went on a hiatus from both television and in @-@ ring competition due to a neck injury which would require surgery , but returned for one night on December 21 , to accept the Slammy Award for Diva of the Year .

 = Jackie Robinson = 
 Jack Roosevelt " Jackie " Robinson ( January 31 , 1919 – October 24 , 1972 ) was an American Major League Baseball ( MLB ) second baseman who became the first African American to play in the major leagues in the modern era . Robinson broke the baseball color line when the Brooklyn Dodgers started him at first base on April 15 , 1947 . The Dodgers , by playing Robinson , heralded the end of racial segregation that had relegated black players to the Negro leagues since the 1880s . Robinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962 . 
 Robinson had an exceptional 10 @-@ year baseball career . He was the recipient of the inaugural MLB Rookie of the Year Award in 1947 , was an All @-@ Star for six consecutive seasons from 1949 through 1954 , and won the National League Most Valuable Player Award in 1949 — the first black player so honored . Robinson played in six World Series and contributed to the Dodgers ' 1955 World Series championship . In 1997 , MLB " universally " retired his uniform number , 42 , across all major league teams ; he was the first pro athlete in any sport to be so honored . MLB also adopted a new annual tradition , " Jackie Robinson Day " , for the first time on April 15 , 2004 , on which every player on every team wears No. 42 . 
 Robinson 's character , his use of nonviolence , and his unquestionable talent challenged the traditional basis of segregation which then marked many other aspects of American life . He influenced the culture of and contributed significantly to the Civil Rights Movement . Robinson also was the first black television analyst in MLB , and the first black vice president of a major American corporation , Chock full o 'Nuts . In the 1960s , he helped establish the Freedom National Bank , an African @-@ American @-@ owned financial institution based in Harlem , New York . In recognition of his achievements on and off the field , Robinson was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal and Presidential Medal of Freedom . 
 = = Early life = = 
 = = = Family and personal life = = = 
 Robinson was born on January 31 , 1919 , into a family of sharecroppers in Cairo , Georgia . He was the youngest of five children born to <unk> ( McGriff ) and Jerry Robinson , after siblings Edgar , Frank , Matthew ( nicknamed " Mack " ) , and Willa Mae . His middle name was in honor of former President Theodore Roosevelt , who died 25 days before Robinson was born . After Robinson 's father left the family in 1920 , they moved to Pasadena , California . 
 The extended Robinson family established itself on a residential plot containing two small houses at 121 Pepper Street in Pasadena . Robinson 's mother worked various odd jobs to support the family . Growing up in relative poverty in an otherwise affluent community , Robinson and his minority friends were excluded from many recreational opportunities . As a result , Robinson joined a neighborhood gang , but his friend Carl Anderson persuaded him to abandon it . 
 = = = John Muir High School = = = 
 In 1935 , Robinson graduated from Washington Junior High School and enrolled at John Muir High School ( Muir Tech ) . Recognizing his athletic talents , Robinson 's older brothers Mack ( himself an accomplished athlete and silver medalist at the 1936 Summer Olympics ) and Frank inspired Jackie to pursue his interest in sports . 
 At Muir Tech , Robinson played several sports at the varsity level and lettered in four of them : football , basketball , track , and baseball . He played shortstop and catcher on the baseball team , quarterback on the football team , and guard on the basketball team . With the track and field squad , he won awards in the broad jump . He was also a member of the tennis team . 
 In 1936 , Robinson won the junior boys singles championship in the annual Pacific Coast Negro Tennis Tournament and earned a place on the Pomona annual baseball tournament all @-@ star team , which included future Hall of Famers Ted Williams and Bob Lemon . In late January 1937 , the Pasadena Star @-@ News newspaper reported that Robinson " for two years has been the outstanding athlete at Muir , starring in football , basketball , track , baseball and tennis . " 
 = = = Pasadena Junior College = = = 
 After Muir , Robinson attended Pasadena Junior College ( PJC ) , where he continued his athletic career by participating in basketball , football , baseball , and track . On the football team , he played quarterback and safety . He was a shortstop and leadoff hitter for the baseball team , and he broke school broad @-@ jump records held by his brother Mack . As at Muir High School , most of Jackie 's teammates were white . While playing football at PJC , Robinson suffered a fractured ankle , complications from which would eventually delay his deployment status while in the military . In 1938 , he was elected to the All @-@ Southland Junior College Team for baseball and selected as the region 's Most Valuable Player . 
 That year , Robinson was one of 10 students named to the school 's Order of the Mast and Dagger ( Omicron Mu Delta ) , awarded to students performing " outstanding service to the school and whose scholastic and citizenship record is worthy of recognition . " Also while at PJC , he was elected to the Lancers , a student @-@ run police organization responsible for patrolling various school activities . 
 An incident at PJC illustrated Robinson 's impatience with authority figures he perceived as racist — a character trait that would resurface repeatedly in his life . On January 25 , 1938 , he was arrested after vocally disputing the detention of a black friend by police . Robinson received a two @-@ year suspended sentence , but the incident — along with other rumored run @-@ ins between Robinson and police — gave Robinson a reputation for combativeness in the face of racial antagonism . Toward the end of his PJC tenure , Frank Robinson ( to whom Robinson felt closest among his three brothers ) was killed in a motorcycle accident . The event motivated Jackie to pursue his athletic career at the nearby University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) , where he could remain closer to Frank 's family . 
 = = = UCLA and afterward = = = 
 After graduating from PJC in spring 1939 , Robinson transferred to UCLA , where he became the school 's first athlete to win varsity letters in four sports : baseball , basketball , football , and track . 
 He was one of four black players on the 1939 UCLA Bruins football team ; the others were Woody Strode , Kenny Washington , and Ray Bartlett . Washington , Strode , and Robinson made up three of the team 's four backfield players . At a time when only a few black students played mainstream college football , this made UCLA college football 's most integrated team . 
 In track and field , Robinson won the 1940 NCAA Men 's Track and Field Championships in the long jump , jumping 24 ft 10 1 ⁄ 4 in ( 7 @.@ 58 m ) . Belying his future career , baseball was Robinson 's " worst sport " at UCLA ; he hit <unk> in his only season , although in his first game he went 4 @-@ for @-@ 4 and twice stole home . 
 While a senior at UCLA , Robinson met his future wife , Rachel Isum ( born 1922 ) , a UCLA freshman who was familiar with Robinson 's athletic career at PJC . In the spring semester of 1941 , despite his mother 's and Isum 's reservations , Robinson left college just shy of graduation . He took a job as an assistant athletic director with the government 's National Youth Administration ( NYA ) in Atascadero , California . 
 After the government ceased NYA operations , Robinson traveled to Honolulu in fall 1941 to play football for the semi @-@ professional , racially integrated Honolulu Bears . After a short season , Robinson returned to California in December 1941 to pursue a career as running back for the Los Angeles Bulldogs of the Pacific Coast Football League . By that time , however , the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor had taken place , drawing the United States into World War II and ending Robinson 's nascent football career . 
 = = Military career = = 
 In 1942 , Robinson was drafted and assigned to a segregated Army cavalry unit in Fort Riley , Kansas . Having the requisite qualifications , Robinson and several other black soldiers applied for admission to an Officer Candidate School ( OCS ) then located at Fort Riley . Although the Army 's initial July 1941 guidelines for OCS had been drafted as race neutral , few black applicants were admitted into OCS until after subsequent directives by Army leadership . As a result , the applications of Robinson and his colleagues were delayed for several months . After protests by heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis ( then stationed at Fort Riley ) and the help of Truman Gibson ( then an assistant civilian aide to the Secretary of War ) , the men were accepted into OCS . This common military experience spawned a personal friendship between Robinson and Louis . Upon finishing OCS , Robinson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in January 1943 . Shortly afterward , Robinson and Isum were formally engaged . 
 After receiving his commission , Robinson was reassigned to Fort Hood , Texas , where he joined the 761st " Black Panthers " Tank Battalion . While at Fort Hood , Robinson often used his weekend leave to visit the Rev. Karl Downs , President of Sam Huston College ( now Huston @-@ Tillotson University ) in nearby Austin , Texas ; Downs had been Robinson 's pastor at Scott United Methodist Church while Robinson attended PJC . 
 An event on July 6 , 1944 derailed Robinson 's military career . While awaiting results of hospital tests on the ankle he had injured in junior college , Robinson boarded an Army bus with a fellow officer 's wife ; although the Army had commissioned its own <unk> bus line , the bus driver ordered Robinson to move to the back of the bus . Robinson refused . The driver backed down , but after reaching the end of the line , summoned the military police , who took Robinson into custody . When Robinson later confronted the investigating duty officer about racist questioning by the officer and his assistant , the officer recommended Robinson be court @-@ martialed . After Robinson 's commander in the 761st , Paul L. Bates , refused to authorize the legal action , Robinson was summarily transferred to the <unk> Battalion — where the commander quickly consented to charge Robinson with multiple offenses , including , among other charges , public drunkenness , even though Robinson did not drink . 
 By the time of the court @-@ martial in August 1944 , the charges against Robinson had been reduced to two counts of insubordination during questioning . Robinson was acquitted by an all @-@ white panel of nine officers . The experiences Robinson was subjected to during the court proceedings would be remembered when he later joined MLB and was subjected to racist attacks . Although his former unit , the 761st Tank Battalion , became the first black tank unit to see combat in World War II , Robinson 's court @-@ martial proceedings prohibited him from being deployed overseas ; thus , he never saw combat action . 
 After his acquittal , he was transferred to Camp Breckinridge , Kentucky , where he served as a coach for army athletics until receiving an honorable discharge in November 1944 . While there , Robinson met a former player for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro American League , who encouraged Robinson to write the Monarchs and ask for a tryout . Robinson took the former player 's advice and wrote to Monarchs ' co @-@ owner Thomas Baird . 
 = = Post @-@ military = = 
 After his discharge , Robinson briefly returned to his old football club , the Los Angeles Bulldogs . Robinson then accepted an offer from his old friend and pastor Rev. Karl Downs to be the athletic director at Sam Huston College in Austin , then of the Southwestern Athletic Conference . The job included coaching the school 's basketball team for the 1944 – 45 season . As it was a fledgling program , few students tried out for the basketball team , and Robinson even resorted to inserting himself into the lineup for exhibition games . Although his teams were outmatched by opponents , Robinson was respected as a disciplinarian coach , and drew the admiration of , among others , Langston University basketball player Marques Haynes , a future member of the Harlem Globetrotters . 
 = = Playing career = = 
 = = = Negro leagues = = = 
 In early 1945 , while Robinson was at Sam Huston College , the Kansas City Monarchs sent him a written offer to play professional baseball in the Negro leagues . Robinson accepted a contract for $ 400 per month . Although he played well for the Monarchs , Robinson was frustrated with the experience . He had grown used to a structured playing environment in college , and the Negro leagues ' disorganization and embrace of gambling interests appalled him . The hectic travel schedule also placed a burden on his relationship with Isum , with whom he could now communicate only by letter . In all , Robinson played 47 games at shortstop for the Monarchs , hitting .387 with five home runs , and registering 13 stolen bases . He also appeared in the 1945 Negro League All @-@ Star Game , going hitless in five at @-@ bats . 
 During the season , Robinson pursued potential major @-@ league interests . The Boston Red Sox held a tryout at Fenway Park for Robinson and other black players on April 16 . The tryout , however , was a farce chiefly designed to assuage the <unk> sensibilities of powerful Boston City Councilman Isadore <unk> . Even with the stands limited to management , Robinson was subjected to racial epithets . Robinson left the tryout humiliated , and more than fourteen years later , in July 1959 , the Red Sox became the last major league team to integrate its roster . 
 Other teams , however , had more serious interest in signing a black ballplayer . In the mid @-@ 1940s , Branch Rickey , club president and general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers , began to scout the Negro leagues for a possible addition to the Dodgers ' roster . Rickey selected Robinson from a list of promising black players and interviewed him for possible assignment to Brooklyn 's International League farm club , the Montreal Royals . Rickey was especially interested in making sure his eventual signee could withstand the inevitable racial abuse that would be directed at him . In a famous three @-@ hour exchange on August 28 , 1945 , Rickey asked Robinson if he could face the racial animus without taking the bait and reacting angrily — a concern given Robinson 's prior arguments with law enforcement officials at PJC and in the military . Robinson was aghast : " Are you looking for a Negro who is afraid to fight back ? " Rickey replied that he needed a Negro player " with guts enough not to fight back . " After obtaining a commitment from Robinson to " turn the other cheek " to racial antagonism , Rickey agreed to sign him to a contract for $ 600 a month , equal to $ 7 @,@ 887 today . Rickey did not offer compensation to the Monarchs , instead believing all Negro league players were free agents due to the contracts ' not containing a reserve clause . Among those Rickey discussed prospects with was Wendell Smith , writer for the black weekly Pittsburgh Courier , who according to Cleveland Indians owner and team president Bill Veeck " influenced Rickey to take Jack Robinson , for which he 's never completely gotten credit . " 
 Although he required Robinson to keep the arrangement a secret for the time being , Rickey committed to formally signing Robinson before November 1 , 1945 . On October 23 , it was publicly announced that Robinson would be assigned to the Royals for the 1946 season . On the same day , with representatives of the Royals and Dodgers present , Robinson formally signed his contract with the Royals . In what was later referred to as " The Noble Experiment " , Robinson was the first black baseball player in the International League since the 1880s . He was not necessarily the best player in the Negro leagues , and black talents Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson were upset when Robinson was selected first . Larry Doby , who broke the color line in the American League the same year as Robinson , said , " One of the things that was disappointing and disheartening to a lot of the black players at the time was that Jack was not the best player . The best was Josh Gibson . I think that 's one of the reasons why Josh died so early – he was heartbroken . " 
 Rickey 's offer allowed Robinson to leave behind the Monarchs and their grueling bus rides , and he went home to Pasadena . That September , he signed with Chet Brewer 's Kansas City Royals , a post @-@ season barnstorming team in the California Winter League . Later that off @-@ season , he briefly toured South America with another barnstorming team , while his fiancée Isum pursued nursing opportunities in New York City . On February 10 , 1946 , Robinson and Isum were married by their old friend , the Rev. Karl Downs .

 In 1946 , Robinson arrived at Daytona Beach , Florida , for spring training with the Montreal Royals of the Class AAA International League ( the designation of " AAA " for the highest level of minor league baseball was first used in the 1946 season ) . Clay Hopper , the manager of the Royals , asked Rickey to assign Robinson to any other Dodger affiliate , but Rickey refused . 
 Robinson 's presence was controversial in racially charged Florida . As he was not allowed to stay with his teammates at the team hotel , he lodged instead at the home of a local black politician . Since the Dodgers organization did not own a spring training facility ( the Dodger @-@ controlled spring training compound in Vero Beach known as " Dodgertown " did not open until spring 1948 ) , scheduling was subject to the whim of area localities , several of which turned down any event involving Robinson or Johnny Wright , another black player whom Rickey had signed to the Dodgers ' organization in January . In Sanford , Florida , the police chief threatened to cancel games if Robinson and Wright did not cease training activities there ; as a result , Robinson was sent back to Daytona Beach . In Jacksonville , the stadium was padlocked shut without warning on game day , by order of the city 's Parks and Public Property director . In DeLand , a scheduled day game was called off , ostensibly because of faulty electrical lighting . 
 After much lobbying of local officials by Rickey himself , the Royals were allowed to host a game involving Robinson in Daytona Beach . Robinson made his Royals debut at Daytona Beach 's City Island Ballpark on March 17 , 1946 , in an exhibition game against the team 's parent club , the Dodgers . Robinson thus became the first black player to openly play for a minor league team against a major league team since the de facto baseball color line had been implemented in the 1880s . 
 Later in spring training , after some less @-@ than @-@ stellar performances , Robinson was shifted from shortstop to second base , allowing him to make shorter throws to first base . Robinson 's performance soon rebounded . On April 18 , 1946 , Roosevelt Stadium hosted the Jersey City Giants ' season opener against the Montreal Royals , marking the professional debut of the Royals ' Jackie Robinson and the first time the color barrier had been broken in a game between two minor league clubs . Pitching against Robinson was Warren Sandel who had played against him when they both lived in California . During Robinson 's first at bat , the Jersey City catcher , Dick <unk> , demanded that Sandel throw at Robinson , but Sandel refused . Although Sandel induced Robinson to ground out at his first at bat , in his five trips to the plate , Robinson ended up with four hits , including his first hit , a three @-@ run home run , in the game 's third inning . He also scored four runs , drove in three , and stole two bases in the Royals ' 14 – 1 victory . Robinson proceeded to lead the International League that season with a .349 batting average and .985 fielding percentage , and he was named the league 's Most Valuable Player . Although he often faced hostility while on road trips ( the Royals were forced to cancel a Southern exhibition tour , for example ) , the Montreal fan base enthusiastically supported Robinson . Whether fans supported or opposed it , Robinson 's presence on the field was a boon to attendance ; more than one million people went to games involving Robinson in 1946 , an amazing figure by International League standards . In the fall of 1946 , following the baseball season , Robinson returned home to California and briefly played professional basketball for the short @-@ lived Los Angeles Red Devils .

 The following year , six days before the start of the 1947 season , the Dodgers called Robinson up to the major leagues . With Eddie Stanky entrenched at second base for the Dodgers , Robinson played his initial major league season as a first baseman . On April 15 , 1947 , Robinson made his major league debut at the relatively advanced age of 28 at Ebbets Field before a crowd of 26 @,@ 623 spectators , including more than 14 @,@ 000 black patrons . Although he failed to get a base hit , he walked and scored a run in the Dodgers ' 5 – 3 victory . Robinson became the first player since 1880 to openly break the major league baseball color line . Black fans began flocking to see the Dodgers when they came to town , abandoning their Negro league teams . 
 Robinson 's promotion met a generally positive , although mixed , reception among newspapers and white major league players . However , racial tension existed in the Dodger clubhouse . Some Dodger players insinuated they would sit out rather than play alongside Robinson . The brewing mutiny ended when Dodgers management took a stand for Robinson . Manager Leo Durocher informed the team , " I do not care if the guy is yellow or black , or if he has stripes like a fuckin ' zebra . I 'm the manager of this team , and I say he plays . What 's more , I say he can make us all rich . And if any of you cannot use the money , I will see that you are all traded . " 
 Robinson was also derided by opposing teams . Some , notably the St. Louis Cardinals , threatened to strike if Robinson played . After the threat , National League President Ford Frick and Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler let it be known that any striking players would be suspended . Robinson nonetheless became the target of rough physical play by opponents ( particularly the Cardinals ) . At one time , he received a seven @-@ inch gash in his leg from Enos Slaughter . On April 22 , 1947 , during a game between the Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies , Phillies players and manager Ben Chapman called Robinson a " nigger " from their dugout and yelled that he should " go back to the cotton fields " . Rickey later recalled that Chapman " did more than anybody to unite the Dodgers . When he poured out that string of unconscionable abuse , he solidified and united thirty men . " 
 Robinson did , however , receive significant encouragement from several major league players . Robinson named Lee " Jeep " Handley , who played for the Phillies at the time , as the first opposing player to wish him well . Dodgers teammate Pee Wee Reese once came to Robinson 's defense with the famous line , " You can hate a man for many reasons . Color is not one of them . " In 1948 , Reese put his arm around Robinson in response to fans who shouted racial slurs at Robinson before a game in Cincinnati . A statue by sculptor William Behrends , unveiled at KeySpan Park on November 1 , 2005 , commemorates this event by representing Reese with his arm around Robinson . Jewish baseball star Hank Greenberg , who had to deal with racial epithets during his career , also encouraged Robinson . Following an incident where Greenberg collided with Robinson at first base , he " whispered a few words into Robinson 's ear " , which Robinson later characterized as " words of encouragement . " Greenberg had advised him to overcome his critics by defeating them in games . Robinson also talked frequently with Larry Doby , who endured his own hardships since becoming the first black player in the American League with the Cleveland Indians , as the two spoke to one another via telephone throughout the season . 
 Robinson finished the season having played in 151 games for the Dodgers , with a batting average of .297 , an on @-@ base percentage of .383 , and a .427 slugging percentage . He had 175 hits ( scoring 125 runs ) including 31 doubles , 5 triples , and 12 home runs , driving in 48 runs for the year . Robinson led the league in sacrifice hits , with 28 , and in stolen bases , with 29 . His cumulative performance earned him the inaugural Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award ( separate National and American League Rookie of the Year honors were not awarded until 1949 ) . 
 = = = = MVP , Congressional testimony , and film biography ( 1948 – 1950 ) = = = = 
 Following Stanky 's trade to the Boston Braves in March 1948 , Robinson took over second base , where he logged a <unk> fielding percentage that year ( second in the National League at the position , fractionally behind Stanky ) . Robinson had a batting average of .296 and 22 stolen bases for the season . In a 12 – 7 win against the St. Louis Cardinals on August 29 , 1948 , he hit for the cycle — a home run , a triple , a double , and a single in the same game . The Dodgers briefly moved into first place in the National League in late August 1948 , but they ultimately finished third as the Braves went on to win the league title and lose to the Cleveland Indians in the World Series . 
 Racial pressure on Robinson eased in 1948 as a number of other black players entered the major leagues . Larry Doby ( who broke the color barrier in the American League on July 5 , 1947 , just 11 weeks after Robinson ) and Satchel Paige played for the Cleveland Indians , and the Dodgers had three other black players besides Robinson . In February 1948 , he signed a $ 12 @,@ 500 contract ( equal to $ 123 @,@ 113 today ) with the Dodgers ; while a significant amount , this was less than Robinson made in the off @-@ season from a vaudeville tour , where he answered pre @-@ set baseball questions , and a speaking tour of the South . Between the tours , he underwent surgery on his right ankle . Because of his off @-@ season activities , Robinson reported to training camp 30 pounds ( 14 kg ) overweight . He lost the weight during training camp , but dieting left him weak at the plate . 
 In the spring of 1949 , Robinson turned to Hall of Famer George Sisler , working as an advisor to the Dodgers , for batting help . At Sisler 's suggestion , Robinson spent hours at a batting tee , learning to hit the ball to right field . Sisler taught Robinson to anticipate a fastball , on the theory that it is easier to subsequently adjust to a slower curveball . Robinson also noted that " Sisler showed me how to stop lunging , how to check my swing until the last fraction of a second " . The tutelage helped Robinson raise his batting average from .296 in 1948 to .342 in 1949 . In addition to his improved batting average , Robinson stole 37 bases that season , was second place in the league for both doubles and triples , and registered 124 runs batted in with 122 runs scored . For the performance Robinson earned the Most Valuable Player Award for the National League . Baseball fans also voted Robinson as the starting second baseman for the 1949 All @-@ Star Game — the first All @-@ Star Game to include black players . 
 That year , a song about Robinson by Buddy Johnson , " Did You See Jackie Robinson Hit That Ball ? " , reached number 13 on the charts ; Count Basie recorded a famous version . Ultimately , the Dodgers won the National League pennant , but lost in five games to the New York Yankees in the 1949 World Series . 
 Summer 1949 brought an unwanted distraction for Robinson . In July , he was called to testify before the United States House of Representatives ' Committee on Un @-@ American Activities ( HUAC ) concerning statements made that April by black athlete and actor Paul Robeson . Robinson was reluctant to testify , but he eventually agreed to do so , fearing it might negatively affect his career if he declined . 
 In 1950 , Robinson led the National League in double plays made by a second baseman with 133 . His salary that year was the highest any Dodger had been paid to that point : $ 35 @,@ 000 ( $ 344 @,@ 239 in 2016 dollars ) . He finished the year with 99 runs scored , a .328 batting average , and 12 stolen bases . The year saw the release of a film biography of Robinson 's life , The Jackie Robinson Story , in which Robinson played himself , and actress Ruby Dee played Rachael " Rae " ( Isum ) Robinson . The project had been previously delayed when the film 's producers refused to accede to demands of two Hollywood studios that the movie include scenes of Robinson being tutored in baseball by a white man . The New York Times wrote that Robinson , " doing that rare thing of playing himself in the picture 's leading role , displays a calm assurance and composure that might be envied by many a Hollywood star . " 
 Robinson 's Hollywood exploits , however , did not sit well with Dodgers co @-@ owner Walter O 'Malley , who referred to Robinson as " Rickey 's prima donna " . In late 1950 , Rickey 's contract as the Dodgers ' team President expired . Weary of constant disagreements with O 'Malley , and with no hope of being re @-@ appointed as President of the Dodgers , Rickey cashed out his one @-@ quarter financial interest in the team , leaving O 'Malley in full control of the franchise . Rickey shortly thereafter became general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates . Robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to Rickey , whom he considered a father figure , stating , " Regardless of what happens to me in the future , it all can be placed on what you have done and , believe me , I appreciate it . " 
 = = = = Pennant races and outside interests ( 1951 – 1953 ) = = = = 
 Before the 1951 season , O 'Malley reportedly offered Robinson the job of manager of the Montreal Royals , effective at the end of Robinson 's playing career . O 'Malley was quoted in the Montreal Standard as saying , " Jackie told me that he would be both delighted and honored to tackle this managerial post " — although reports differed as to whether a position was ever formally offered . 
 During the 1951 season , Robinson led the National League in double plays made by a second baseman for the second year in a row , with 137 . He also kept the Dodgers in contention for the 1951 pennant . During the last game of the regular season , in the 13th inning , he had a hit to tie the game , and then won the game with a home run in the 14th . This forced a best @-@ of @-@ three playoff series against the crosstown rival New York Giants . 
 Despite Robinson 's regular @-@ season heroics , the Dodgers lost the pennant on Bobby Thomson 's famous home run , known as the Shot Heard ' Round the World , on October 3 , 1951 . Overcoming his dejection , Robinson dutifully observed Thomson 's feet to ensure he touched all the bases . Dodgers sportscaster Vin Scully later noted that the incident showed " how much of a competitor Robinson was . " He finished the season with 106 runs scored , a batting average of .335 , and 25 stolen bases . 
 Robinson had what was an average year for him in 1952 . He finished the year with 104 runs , a .308 batting average , and 24 stolen bases . He did , however , record a career @-@ high on @-@ base percentage of .436 . The Dodgers improved on their performance from the year before , winning the National League pennant before losing the 1952 World Series to the New York Yankees in seven games . That year , on the television show Youth Wants to Know , Robinson challenged the Yankees ' general manager , George Weiss , on the racial record of his team , which had yet to sign a black player . Sportswriter Dick Young , whom Robinson had described as a " bigot " , said , " If there was one flaw in Jackie , it was the common one . He believed that everything unpleasant that happened to him happened because of his blackness . " The 1952 season was the last year Robinson was an everyday starter at second base . Afterward , Robinson played variously at first , second , and third bases , shortstop , and in the outfield , with Jim Gilliam , another black player , taking over everyday second base duties . Robinson 's interests began to shift toward the prospect of managing a major league team . He had hoped to gain experience by managing in the Puerto Rican Winter League , but according to the New York Post , Commissioner Happy Chandler denied the request . 
 In 1953 , Robinson had 109 runs , a .329 batting average , and 17 steals , leading the Dodgers to another National League pennant ( and another World Series loss to the Yankees , this time in six games ) . Robinson 's continued success spawned a string of death threats . He was not dissuaded , however , from addressing racial issues publicly . That year , he served as editor for Our Sports magazine , a periodical focusing on Negro sports issues ; contributions to the magazine included an article on golf course segregation by Robinson 's old friend Joe Louis . Robinson also openly criticized segregated hotels and restaurants that served the Dodger organization ; a number of these establishments integrated as a result , including the five @-@ star Chase Park Hotel in St. Louis .

 In 1954 , Robinson had 62 runs , a .311 batting average , and 7 steals . His best day at the plate was on June 17 , when he hit two home runs and two doubles . The following autumn , Robinson won his only championship when the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees in the 1955 World Series . Although the team enjoyed ultimate success , 1955 was the worst year of Robinson 's individual career . He hit .256 and stole only 12 bases . The Dodgers tried Robinson in the outfield and as a third baseman , both because of his diminishing abilities and because Gilliam was established at second base . Robinson , then 37 years old , missed 49 games and did not play in Game 7 of the World Series . Robinson missed the game because manager Walter Alston decided to play Gilliam at second and Don Hoak at third base . That season , the Dodgers ' Don Newcombe became the first black major league pitcher to win twenty games in a year . 
 In 1956 , Robinson had 61 runs , a .275 batting average , and 12 steals . By then , he had begun to exhibit the effects of diabetes , and to lose interest in the prospect of playing or managing professional baseball . After the season , Robinson was traded by the Dodgers to the arch @-@ rival New York Giants for Dick Littlefield and $ 35 @,@ 000 cash ( equal to $ 304 @,@ 633 today ) . The trade , however , was never completed ; unbeknownst to the Dodgers , Robinson had already agreed with the president of Chock full o 'Nuts to quit baseball and become an executive with the company . Since Robinson had sold exclusive rights to any retirement story to Look magazine two years previously , his retirement decision was revealed through the magazine , instead of through the Dodgers organization .

 Robinson 's major league debut brought an end to approximately sixty years of segregation in professional baseball , known as the baseball color line . After World War II , several other forces were also leading the country toward increased equality for blacks , including their accelerated migration to the North , where their political clout grew , and President Harry Truman 's desegregation of the military in 1948 . Robinson 's breaking of the baseball color line and his professional success symbolized these broader changes and demonstrated that the fight for equality was more than simply a political matter . Martin Luther King , Jr. said that he was " a legend and a symbol in his own time " , and that he " challenged the dark skies of intolerance and frustration . " According to historian Doris Kearns Goodwin , Robinson 's " efforts were a monumental step in the civil @-@ rights revolution in America ... [ His ] accomplishments allowed black and white Americans to be more respectful and open to one another and more appreciative of everyone 's abilities . " 
 Beginning his major league career at the relatively advanced age of twenty @-@ eight , he played only ten seasons from 1947 to 1956 , all of them for the Brooklyn Dodgers . During his career , the Dodgers played in six World Series , and Robinson himself played in six All @-@ Star Games . In 1999 , he was posthumously named to the Major League Baseball All @-@ Century Team . 
 Robinson 's career is generally considered to mark the beginning of the post – " long ball " era in baseball , in which a reliance on raw power @-@ hitting gave way to balanced offensive strategies that used <unk> to create runs through aggressive baserunning . Robinson exhibited the combination of hitting ability and speed which exemplified the new era . He scored more than 100 runs in six of his ten seasons ( averaging more than 110 runs from 1947 to 1953 ) , had a .311 career batting average , a .409 career on @-@ base percentage , a <unk> slugging percentage , and substantially more walks than strikeouts ( 740 to 291 ) . Robinson was one of only two players during the span of 1947 – 56 to accumulate at least 125 steals while registering a slugging percentage over .425 ( Minnie Miñoso was the other ) . He accumulated 197 stolen bases in total , including 19 steals of home . None of the latter were double steals ( in which a player stealing home is assisted by a player stealing another base at the same time ) . Robinson has been referred to by author David Falkner as " the father of modern base @-@ stealing " . 
 Historical statistical analysis indicates Robinson was an outstanding fielder throughout his ten years in the major leagues and at virtually every position he played . After playing his rookie season at first base , Robinson spent most of his career as a second baseman . He led the league in fielding among second basemen in 1950 and 1951 . Toward the end of his career , he played about 2 @,@ 000 innings at third base and about 1 @,@ 175 innings in the outfield , excelling at both . 
 Assessing himself , Robinson said , " I 'm not concerned with your liking or disliking me ... all I ask is that you respect me as a human being . " Regarding Robinson 's qualities on the field , Leo Durocher said , " Ya want a guy that comes to play . This guy didn 't just come to play . He come to beat ya . He come to stuff the goddamn bat right up your ass . "

 Robinson retired from baseball at age 37 on January 5 , 1957 . Later that year , after he complained of numerous physical ailments , his doctors diagnosed him with diabetes , a disease that also afflicted his brothers . Although Robinson adopted an insulin injection regimen , the state of medicine at the time could not prevent the continued deterioration of Robinson 's physical condition from the disease . 
 In his first year of eligibility for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962 , Robinson encouraged voters to consider only his on @-@ field qualifications , rather than his cultural impact on the game . He was elected on the first ballot , becoming the first black player inducted into the Cooperstown museum . 
 In 1965 , Robinson served as an analyst for ABC 's Major League Baseball Game of the Week telecasts , the first black person to do so . In 1966 , Robinson was hired as general manager for the short @-@ lived Brooklyn Dodgers of the Continental Football League . In 1972 , he served as a part @-@ time commentator on Montreal Expos telecasts . 
 On June 4 , 1972 , the Dodgers retired his uniform number , 42 , alongside those of Roy Campanella ( 39 ) and Sandy Koufax ( 32 ) . From 1957 to 1964 , Robinson was the vice president for personnel at Chock full o 'Nuts ; he was the first black person to serve as vice president of a major American corporation . Robinson always considered his business career as advancing the cause of black people in commerce and industry . Robinson also chaired the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People 's ( NAACP ) million @-@ dollar Freedom Fund Drive in 1957 , and served on the organization 's board until 1967 . In 1964 , he helped found , with Harlem businessman Dunbar McLaurin , Freedom National Bank — a black @-@ owned and operated commercial bank based in Harlem . He also served as the bank 's first Chairman of the Board . In 1970 , Robinson established the Jackie Robinson Construction Company to build housing for low @-@ income families . 
 Robinson was active in politics throughout his post @-@ baseball life . He identified himself as a political independent , although he held conservative opinions on several issues , including the Vietnam War ( he once wrote to Martin Luther King , Jr. to defend the Johnson Administration 's military policy ) . After supporting Richard Nixon in his 1960 presidential race against John F. Kennedy , Robinson later praised Kennedy effusively for his stance on civil rights . Robinson was angered by conservative Republican opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , though a higher percentage of Democrats voted against it in both the House and Senate . He became one of six national directors for Nelson Rockefeller 's unsuccessful campaign to be nominated as the Republican candidate for the 1964 presidential election . After the party nominated Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona instead , Robinson left the party 's convention commenting that he now had " a better understanding of how it must have felt to be a Jew in Hitler 's Germany " . He later became special assistant for community affairs when Rockefeller was re @-@ elected governor of New York in 1966 . Switching his allegiance to the Democrats , he subsequently supported Hubert Humphrey against Nixon in 1968 . 
 <unk> the major leagues ' ongoing lack of minority managers and central office personnel , Robinson turned down an invitation to appear in an old @-@ timers ' game at Yankee Stadium in 1969 . He made his final public appearance on October 15 , 1972 , throwing the ceremonial first pitch before Game 2 of the World Series . He gratefully accepted a plaque honoring the twenty @-@ fifth anniversary of his MLB debut , but also commented , " I 'm going to be tremendously more pleased and more proud when I look at that third base coaching line one day and see a black face managing in baseball . " This wish was fulfilled only after Robinson 's death : following the 1974 season , the Cleveland Indians gave their managerial post to Frank Robinson ( no relation ) , a Hall of Fame @-@ bound player who would go on to manage three other teams . Despite the success of these two Robinsons and other black players , the number of African @-@ American players in Major League Baseball has declined since the 1970s .

 After Robinson 's retirement from baseball , his wife , Rachel Robinson , pursued a career in academic nursing . She became an assistant professor at the Yale School of Nursing and director of nursing at the Connecticut Mental Health Center . She also served on the board of the Freedom National Bank until it closed in 1990 . She and Jackie had three children : Jackie Robinson Jr . ( born November 18 , 1946 , died 1971 , the year before Jackie ) , Sharon Robinson ( born January 13 , 1950 ) , and David Robinson ( born May 14 , 1952 ) . 
 Robinson 's eldest son , Jackie Robinson Jr . , had emotional trouble during his childhood and entered special education at an early age . He enrolled in the Army in search of a disciplined environment , served in the Vietnam War , and was wounded in action on November 19 , 1965 . After his discharge , he struggled with drug problems . Robinson Jr. eventually completed the treatment program at <unk> Village in Seymour , Connecticut , and became a counselor at the institution . On June 17 , 1971 , at the age of 24 , he was killed in an automobile accident . The experience with his son 's drug addiction turned Robinson Sr. into an avid anti @-@ drug crusader toward the end of his life . 
 Robinson did not long outlive his son . Complications of heart disease and diabetes weakened Robinson and made him almost blind by middle age . On October 24 , 1972 , nine days after his appearance at the World Series , Robinson died of a heart attack in his home at 95 Cascade Road in North Stamford , Connecticut . Robinson 's funeral service on October 27 , 1972 , at Upper Manhattan 's Riverside Church adjacent to Grant 's Tomb in Morningside Heights attracted 2 @,@ 500 mourners . Many of his former teammates and other famous baseball players served as pallbearers , and the Rev. Jesse Jackson gave the eulogy . Tens of thousands of people lined the subsequent procession route to Robinson 's interment site at Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn , New York , where he is buried next to his son Jackie and mother @-@ in @-@ law <unk> Isum . Twenty @-@ five years after Robinson 's death , the <unk> Parkway was renamed the Jackie Robinson Parkway in his memory . This parkway bisects the cemetery in close proximity to Robinson 's gravesite . 
 After Robinson 's death , his widow founded the Jackie Robinson Foundation , of which she remains an officer as of 2015 . On April 15 , 2008 , she announced that in 2010 the foundation will be opening a museum devoted to Jackie in Lower Manhattan . Robinson 's daughter , Sharon , became a midwife , educator , director of educational programming for MLB , and the author of two books about her father . His youngest son , David , who has six children , is a coffee grower and social activist in Tanzania .

 According to a poll conducted in 1947 , Robinson was the second most popular man in the country , behind Bing Crosby . In 1999 , he was named by Time on its list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century . Also in 1999 , he ranked number 44 on the Sporting News list of Baseball 's 100 Greatest Players and was elected to the Major League Baseball All @-@ Century Team as the top vote @-@ getter among second basemen . Baseball writer Bill James , in The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract , ranked Robinson as the 32nd greatest player of all time strictly on the basis of his performance on the field , noting that he was one of the top players in the league throughout his career . Robinson was among the 25 charter members of UCLA 's Athletics Hall of Fame in 1984 . In 2002 , Molefi Kete Asante included Robinson on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans . Robinson has also been honored by the United States Postal Service on three separate postage stamps , in 1982 , 1999 , and 2000 . 
 The City of Pasadena has recognized Robinson in several ways . Brookside Park , situated next to the Rose Bowl , features a baseball diamond and stadium named Jackie Robinson Field . The city 's Human Services Department operates the Jackie Robinson Center , a community outreach center that provides health services . In 1997 , a $ 325 @,@ 000 bronze sculpture ( equal to $ 479 @,@ 079 today ) by artists Ralph <unk> , Stu Schecter , and John <unk> depicting oversized nine @-@ foot busts of Robinson and his brother Mack was erected at Garfield Avenue , across from the main entrance of Pasadena City Hall ; a granite footprint lists multiple donors to the commission project , which was organized by the Robinson Memorial Foundation and supported by members of the Robinson family . 
 Major League Baseball has honored Robinson many times since his death . In 1987 , both the National and American League Rookie of the Year Awards were renamed the " Jackie Robinson Award " in honor of the first recipient ( Robinson 's Major League Rookie of the Year Award in 1947 encompassed both leagues ) . On April 15 , 1997 , Robinson 's jersey number , 42 , was retired throughout Major League Baseball , the first time any jersey number had been retired throughout one of the four major American sports leagues . Under the terms of the retirement , a grandfather clause allowed the handful of players who wore number 42 to continue doing so in tribute to Robinson , until such time as they subsequently changed teams or jersey numbers . This affected players such as the Mets ' Butch Huskey and Boston 's Mo Vaughn . The Yankees ' Mariano Rivera , who retired at the end of the 2013 season , was the last player in Major League Baseball to wear jersey number 42 on a regular basis . Since 1997 , only Wayne Gretzky 's number 99 , retired by the NHL in 2000 , has been retired league @-@ wide . There have also been calls for MLB to retire number 21 league @-@ wide in honor of Roberto Clemente , a sentiment opposed by the Robinson family . The Hispanics Across America advocacy group wants Clemente 's number set aside the way the late Robinson 's No. 42 was in 1997 , but Sharon Robinson maintained the position that such an honor should remain in place for Jackie Robinson only . 
 As an exception to the retired @-@ number policy , MLB in 2007 began honoring Robinson by allowing players to wear number 42 on April 15 , Jackie Robinson Day , which is now an annual observance . For the 60th anniversary of Robinson 's major league debut , MLB invited players to wear the number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day in 2007 . The gesture was originally the idea of outfielder Ken Griffey , Jr . , who sought Rachel Robinson 's permission to wear the number . After receiving her permission , Commissioner Bud Selig not only allowed Griffey to wear the number , but also extended an invitation to all major league teams to do the same . Ultimately , more than 200 players wore number 42 , including the entire rosters of the Los Angeles Dodgers , New York Mets , Houston Astros , Philadelphia Phillies , St. Louis Cardinals , Milwaukee Brewers , and Pittsburgh Pirates . The tribute was continued in 2008 , when , during games on April 15 , all members of the Mets , Cardinals , Washington Nationals , and Tampa Bay Rays wore Robinson 's number 42 . On June 25 , 2008 , MLB installed a new plaque for Robinson at the Baseball Hall of Fame commemorating his off @-@ the @-@ field impact on the game as well as his playing statistics . In 2009 , all uniformed personnel ( players , managers , coaches , and umpires ) wore number 42 on April 15 . 
 At the November 2006 groundbreaking for a new ballpark for the New York Mets , Citi Field , it was announced that the main entrance , modeled on the one in Brooklyn 's old Ebbets Field , would be called the Jackie Robinson Rotunda . The rotunda was dedicated at the opening of Citi Field on April 16 , 2009 . It honors Robinson with large quotations spanning the inner curve of the facade and features a large freestanding statue of his number , 42 , which has become an attraction in itself . Mets owner Fred <unk> announced that , in conjunction with Citigroup and the Jackie Robinson Foundation , the Mets will create a Jackie Robinson Museum and Learning Center , located at the headquarters of the Jackie Robinson Foundation at One Hudson Square , along Canal Street in lower Manhattan . Along with the museum , scholarships will be awarded to " young people who live by and embody Jackie 's ideals . " The museum hopes to open by 2015 . 
 Since 2004 , the Aflac National High School Baseball Player of the Year has been presented the " Jackie Robinson Award " . 
 Robinson has also been recognized outside of baseball . In December 1956 , the NAACP recognized him with the Spingarn Medal , which it awards annually for the highest achievement by an African @-@ American . President Ronald Reagan posthumously awarded Robinson the Presidential Medal of Freedom on March 26 , 1984 , and on March 2 , 2005 , President George W. Bush gave Robinson 's widow the Congressional Gold Medal , the highest civilian award bestowed by Congress ; Robinson was only the second baseball player to receive the award , after Roberto Clemente . On August 20 , 2007 , California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife , Maria Shriver , announced that Robinson was inducted into the California Hall of Fame , located at The California Museum for History , Women and the Arts in Sacramento . 
 A number of buildings have been named in Robinson 's honor . The UCLA Bruins baseball team plays in Jackie Robinson Stadium , which , because of the efforts of Jackie 's brother Mack , features a memorial statue of Robinson by sculptor Richard H. Ellis . The stadium also unveiled a new mural of Robinson by Mike Sullivan on April 14 , 2013 . City Island Ballpark in Daytona Beach , Florida was renamed Jackie Robinson Ballpark in 1990 and a statue of Robinson with two children stands in front of the ballpark . His wife Rachel was present for the dedication on September 15 . 1990 . A number of facilities at Pasadena City College ( successor to PJC ) are named in Robinson 's honor , including Robinson Field , a football / soccer / track facility named jointly for Robinson and his brother Mack . The New York Public School system has named a middle school after Robinson , and Dorsey High School plays at a Los Angeles football stadium named after him . In 1976 , his home in Brooklyn , the Jackie Robinson House , was declared a National Historic Landmark . Brooklyn residents want to turn his home into a city landmark . Robinson also has an asteroid named after him , <unk> <unk> . In 1997 , the United States Mint issued a Jackie Robinson commemorative silver dollar , and five dollar gold coin . That same year , New York City renamed the <unk> Parkway in his honor . 
 In 2011 , the U.S. placed a plaque at Robinson 's Montreal home to honor the ending of segregation in baseball . The house , on 8232 avenue de Gaspé near Jarry Park , was Robinson 's residence when he played for the Montreal Royals during 1946 . In a letter read during the ceremony , Rachel Robinson , Jackie 's widow , wrote : " I remember Montreal and that house very well and have always had warm feeling for that great city . Before Jack and I moved to Montreal , we had just been through some very rough treatment in the racially biased South during spring training in Florida . In the end , Montreal was the perfect place for him to get his start . We never had a threatening or unpleasant experience there . The people were so welcoming and saw Jack as a player and as a man . " 
 On November 22 , 2014 , UCLA announced that it would officially retire the number 42 across all university sports , effective immediately . While Robinson wore several different numbers during his UCLA career , the school chose 42 because it had become indelibly identified with him . The only sport this did not affect was men 's basketball , which had previously retired the number for Walt Hazzard ( although Kevin Love was actually the last player in that sport to wear 42 , with Hazzard 's blessing ) . In a move paralleling that of MLB when it retired the number , UCLA allowed three athletes ( in women 's soccer , softball , and football ) who were already wearing 42 to continue to do so for the remainder of their UCLA careers . The school also announced it would prominently display the number at all of its athletic venues . 
 = Haldane Reforms = 
 The Haldane Reforms were a series of far @-@ ranging reforms of the British Army made from 1906 to 1912 , and named after the Secretary of State for War , Richard Burdon Haldane . They were the first major reforms since the " Childers Reforms " of the early 1880s , and were made in the light of lessons newly learned in the Second Boer War . 
 The major element of the reforms was the creation of an expeditionary force , specifically prepared and trained for intervening in a major war . This had existed before , but it had not been well @-@ prepared for overseas service , and the newly organised force would have a permanent peacetime organisation and a full complement of supporting troops . At the same time , the reserve forces were restructured and expanded to ensure that the overseas forces could be efficiently reinforced and supplied with new recruits . To ensure that home defence would not suffer from sending the regular forces overseas , the Militia formed the Special Reserve and the Volunteer Force and the Yeomanry were reorganised into a new Territorial Force ; these latter two reforms were grouped together in the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 . To encourage the development of military skills , an Officer Training Corps was established in public schools and universities . Military strategy was revitalised by a new Imperial General Staff , which would ensure a common doctrine and common strategic aims among the various military forces of the British Empire , including the Dominions as well as British India . Finally , the Regular Army itself would be reformed by the development of a new operational and training doctrine , laid down in Douglas Haig 's new Field Service Pocket Book . 
 The outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 saw the bulk of the changes put to the test ; the Expeditionary Force was quickly sent to the Continent , whilst the Territorial Force and Reserves were mobilised as planned to provide a second line . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the middle of the 19th century , the British Army had seen two major operations in close succession - the Crimean War and the Indian Mutiny - and it had become apparent that the existing organisation of the forces was not sufficient for large @-@ scale modern warfare . The first wave of reforms was from 1858 to 1860 . This period saw the creation of the Staff College , which helped to turn officers in the upper reaches of the Army into professional soldiers ; the transformation of the old East India Company army into the Indian Army to better control the forces in India ; and the creation of the Volunteer Force to help with home defence whilst the Regular Army was overseas . 
 The second wave was from 1868 to 1872 , comprising a collection of administrative changes popularly known as the " Cardwell Reforms " after the then Secretary of State for War , Edward Cardwell . The purchase of commissions by officers was abolished , and recruits were now taken on for a short enlistment in a specified regiment or corps rather than the ( unpopular ) system of twenty @-@ one @-@ year general service enlistments . These measures at a stroke increased the quality of the manpower of the Army , and provided for a trained and efficient reserve of veterans which could be recalled to the colours in an emergency . A further part of the reforms was the reorganisation of the regimental system , linking " territorial " ( line ) regiments in paired regimental depots with a territory based recruiting area for simplified recruitment and training . 
 The third set of reforms was the " Childers Reforms " ( again named after the Secretary of State who carried them out ) of the early 1880s , which carried through the Cardwell regimental reorganisations to their logical end by completing the amalgamation of linked regiments into single two @-@ battalion regiments along with the local units of militia and volunteers . 
 The result of these reforms was to provide a sizable , well @-@ trained force in the British Isles , which could be sent overseas in time of crisis , with a system of reservists and home @-@ service volunteers to support it . However , with the outbreak of the South African War in October 1899 , the system immediately began to show some strain ; by the end of the first year of fighting , the reserves had been entirely exhausted . Various novel measures , including the extensive use of auxiliary forces , were experimented with for the remainder of the war ; the Militia provided garrison units to free up regulars , the Volunteers sent service companies to be attached to regular battalions , and the Imperial Yeomanry was created to supply much @-@ needed mounted infantry . 
 A number of half @-@ hearted attempts were made at reform during the war and in its immediate aftermath , but with little effect . Two important Royal Commissions were established in 1902 - the Esher Committee and the Norfolk Commission - and reported in 1904 . The Esher Report called for wide @-@ ranging reforms in the administration of the Army and the War Office , whilst the Norfolk Commission , which had studied the auxiliary forces , declared them " unfit for service " and recommended various practical reforms alongside the much more sensational suggestion of universal military service . Some of these reforms were instituted under the Conservative Secretary of State for War , Hugh Arnold @-@ Forster , in 1904 @-@ 5 , but the broad thrust of his reform plans were strongly opposed . Attempts to reorganise the home forces into six Army Corps had begun , but only one of these had actually been organised , and even that lacked many of its support units and staff . 
 = = Haldane 's reforms = = 
 In December 1905 , the Balfour government collapsed , and Sir Henry Campbell @-@ Bannerman became Prime Minister , leading a minority Liberal government . Richard Haldane was appointed Secretary of State for War , an almost accidental selection — he himself had been aiming to be Lord Chancellor , whilst Campbell @-@ Bannerman offered him the post of Attorney @-@ General , then the Home Office , and had offered the War Office to two other men before Haldane offered to take it . Despite this inauspicious beginning , he would become , in the words of Douglas Haig , " the greatest Secretary of State for War England has ever had " . Haldane took the post with well hidden preconceived ideas as to the role of the Army having realised that the reform @-@ weary Generals in the War Office , after St John Brodrick , would not want another Secretary of State for War who was intent on changing things yet again . Haldane 's success was that he got the Generals on side having gained their trust and respect , then expunged the War Office of those officers who did not support his reforms and with the support of Lord Esher , Maj Gen Haig and Colonel Ellison , finally designed and implemented a set of reforms that would go some way to preparing the British Army for the opening salvos of the First World War . 
 = = = Creation of an Expeditionary Force = = = 
 After a brief hiatus during the 1906 general election , which the Liberals won by a landslide , obtaining a majority of 126 seats in the House of Commons , Haldane turned his attention to the Tangier Crisis , which had almost brought France and Germany to war in December . Sir Edward Grey , the Foreign Secretary , had privately agreed to commit the Army to the aid of France , if attacked , and Haldane began to consider how best to accomplish this . He quickly concluded that there was a need for a regular expeditionary force , specifically prepared and trained for use as a continental intervention force . The question now became how to provide this force , and after a short period Haldane settled on a strength of six infantry divisions and their supporting units . They would need to be organised in peacetime and prepared to mobilise in the United Kingdom , as they would be committed into action as soon as they reached the Continent . 
 As the Army was now geared to a specific purpose , it could be reorganised to fit this role ; any elements which did not fit could be discarded to help pay for the changes ; this was to include the disbandment of ten infantry battalions and a number of surplus artillery batteries , and the withdrawal of some overseas garrisons . The Army at home was reorganised into six divisions by a Special Army Order dated 1 January 1907 , with one " heavy " four @-@ brigade Cavalry Division and two mounted brigades for reconnaissance , along with some Army troops . In February 1907 , Haldane announced the coming year 's spending estimates ; despite the creation of the new force , the disbanded units and other minor efficiencies had managed to reduce overall spending by two to three million pounds . 
 = = = Creation of the Territorial Force = = = 
 Once the Regular Army had been organised as a continental Expeditionary Force , it would be necessary to provide forces for home defence . Haldane 's proposal anticipated that the existing tripartite division of the Army - the Regular Army , the Volunteers / Yeomanry and the Militia - should be changed into a two @-@ part structure , with an Expeditionary Force and a home @-@ defence Territorial Force based on County Associations . 
 These changes were embodied in the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 , which passed the Commons with little opposition save for a dispute over the future status of Militia regiments . It essentially abolished the existing Volunteers and Yeomanry , and used them to create a new Territorial Force of fourteen infantry divisions , fourteen cavalry brigades , and a large number of support units , all raised , organised and financed by local organisations but liable for service under War Office command . The Militia provided the Special Reserve , which would contain men who had not served in the regular Army but agreed to be liable for service with the regular forces in wartime .
