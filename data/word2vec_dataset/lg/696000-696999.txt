 = History of Mars observation = 
 The recorded history of Mars observation dates back to the era of the ancient Egyptian astronomers in the 2nd millennium BCE . Chinese records about the motions of Mars appeared before the founding of the Zhou Dynasty ( 1045 BCE ) . Detailed observations of the position of Mars were made by Babylonian astronomers who developed arithmetic techniques to predict the future position of the planet . The ancient Greek philosophers and Hellenistic astronomers developed a geocentric model to explain the planet 's motions . Measurements of Mars ' angular diameter can be found in ancient Greek and Indian texts . In the 16th century , Nicolaus Copernicus proposed a heliocentric model for the Solar System in which the planets follow circular orbits about the Sun . This was revised by Johannes Kepler , yielding an elliptic orbit for Mars that more accurately fitted the observational data . 
 The first telescopic observation of Mars was by Galileo Galilei in 1610 . Within a century , astronomers discovered distinct albedo features on the planet , including the dark patch Syrtis Major Planum and polar ice caps . They were able to determine the planet 's rotation period and axial tilt . These observations were primarily made during the time intervals when the planet was located in opposition to the Sun , at which points Mars made its closest approaches to the Earth . 
 Better telescopes developed early in the 19th century allowed permanent Martian albedo features to be mapped in detail . The first crude map of Mars was published in 1840 , followed by more refined maps from 1877 onward . When astronomers mistakenly thought they had detected the spectroscopic signature of water in the Martian atmosphere , the idea of life on Mars became popularized among the public . Percival Lowell believed he could see a network of artificial canals on Mars . These linear features later proved to be an optical illusion , and the atmosphere was found to be too thin to support an Earth @-@ like environment . 
 Yellow clouds on Mars have been observed since the 1870s , which Eugène M. Antoniadi suggested were windblown sand or dust . During the 1920s , the range of Martian surface temperature was measured ; it ranged from − 85 to 7 ° C ( − 121 to 45 ° F ) . The planetary atmosphere was found to be arid with only trace amounts of oxygen and water . In 1947 , Gerard Kuiper showed that the thin Martian atmosphere contained extensive carbon dioxide ; roughly double the quantity found in Earth 's atmosphere . The first standard nomenclature for Mars albedo features was adopted in 1960 by the International Astronomical Union . Since the 1960s , multiple robotic spacecraft have been sent to explore Mars from orbit and the surface . The planet has remained under observation by ground and space @-@ based instruments across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum . The discovery of meteorites on Earth that originated on Mars has allowed laboratory examination of the chemical conditions on the planet .

 The existence of Mars as a wandering object in the night sky was recorded by ancient Egyptian astronomers . By the 2nd millennium BCE they were familiar with the apparent retrograde motion of the planet , in which it appears to move in the opposite direction across the sky from its normal progression . Mars was portrayed on the ceiling of the tomb of Seti I , on the <unk> ceiling , and in the Senenmut star map . The last is the oldest known star map , being dated to 1534 BCE based on the position of the planets . 
 By the period of the Neo @-@ Babylonian Empire , Babylonian astronomers were making systematic observations of the positions and behavior of the planets . For Mars , they knew , for example , that the planet made 37 synodic periods , or 42 circuits of the zodiac , every 79 years . The Babylonians invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets . This technique was primarily derived from timing measurements — such as when Mars rose above the horizon , rather than from the less accurately known position of the planet on the celestial sphere . 
 Chinese records of the appearances and motions of Mars appear before the founding of the Zhou Dynasty ( 1045 BCE ) , and by the Qin Dynasty ( 221 BCE ) astronomers maintained close records of planetary conjunctions , including those of Mars . <unk> of Mars by Venus were noted in 368 , 375 , and 405 CE . The period and motion of the planet 's orbit was known in detail during the Tang Dynasty ( 618 CE ) . 
 The early astronomy of ancient Greece was influenced by knowledge transmitted from the Mesopotamian culture . Thus the Babylonians associated Mars with Nergal , their god of war and pestilence , and the Greeks connected the planet with their god of war , Ares . During this period , the motions of the planets were of little interest to the Greeks ; Hesiod 's Works and Days ( c . 650 BCE ) makes no mention of the planets . 
 = = Orbital models = = 
 The Greeks used the word <unk> to refer to the seven celestial bodies that moved with respect to the background stars and they held a geocentric view that these bodies moved about the Earth . In his work , The Republic ( <unk> – <unk> ) , the Greek philosopher Plato provided the oldest known statement defining the order of the planets in Greek astronomical tradition . His list , in order of the nearest to the most distant from the Earth , was as follows : the Moon , Sun , Venus , Mercury , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , and the fixed stars . In his dialogue Timaeus , Plato proposed that the progression of these objects across the skies depended on their distance , so that the most distant object moved the slowest . 
 Aristotle , a student of Plato , observed an occultation of Mars by the Moon in 365 BCE . From this he concluded that Mars must lie further from the Earth than the Moon . He noted that other such occultations of stars and planets had been observed by the Egyptians and Babylonians . Aristotle used this observational evidence to support the Greek sequencing of the planets . His work De <unk> presented a model of the universe in which the Sun , Moon , and planets circle about the Earth at fixed distances . A more sophisticated version of the geocentric model was developed by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus when he proposed that Mars moved along a circular track called the epicycle that , in turn , orbited about the Earth along a larger circle called the deferent . 
 In Roman Egypt during the 2nd century CE , Claudius Ptolemaeus ( Ptolemy ) attempted to address the problem of the orbital motion of Mars . Observations of Mars had shown that the planet appeared to move 40 % faster on one side of its orbit than the other , in conflict with the Aristotelian model of uniform motion . Ptolemy modified the model of planetary motion by adding a point offset from the center of the planet 's circular orbit about which the planet moves at a uniform rate of rotation . He proposed that the order of the planets , by increasing distance , was : the Moon , Mercury , Venus , Sun , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , and the fixed stars . Ptolemy 's model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi @-@ volume collection Almagest , which became the authoritative treatise on Western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries . 
 In the 5th century CE , the Indian astronomical text Surya Siddhanta estimated the angular size of Mars as 2 arc @-@ minutes ( 1 / 30 of a degree ) and its distance to Earth as 10 @,@ 433 @,@ 000 km ( 1 @,@ 296 @,@ 600 yojana , where one yojana is equivalent to eight km in the Surya Siddhanta ) . From this the diameter of Mars is deduced to be 6 @,@ 070 km ( 754 @.@ 4 yojana ) , which has an error within 11 % of the currently accepted value of 6 @,@ 788 km . However , this estimate was based upon an inaccurate guess of the planet 's angular size . The result may have been influenced by the work of Ptolemy , who listed a value of 1 @.@ 57 arc @-@ minutes . Both estimates are significantly larger than the value later obtained by telescope . 
 In 1543 , Nicolaus Copernicus published a heliocentric model in his work De revolutionibus orbium coelestium . This approach placed the Earth in an orbit around the Sun between the circular orbits of Venus and Mars . His model successfully explained why the planets Mars , Jupiter and Saturn were on the opposite side of the sky from the Sun whenever they were in the middle of their retrograde motions . Copernicus was able to sort the planets into their correct heliocentric order based solely on the period of their orbits about the Sun . His theory gradually gained acceptance among European astronomers , particularly after the publication of the Prutenic Tables by the German astronomer Erasmus Reinhold in 1551 , which were computed using the Copernican model . 
 On October 13 , 1590 , the German astronomer Michael Maestlin observed an occultation of Mars by Venus . One of his students , Johannes Kepler , quickly became an adherent to the Copernican system . After the completion of his education , Kepler became an assistant to the Danish nobleman and astronomer , Tycho Brahe . With access granted to Tycho 's detailed observations of Mars , Kepler was set to work mathematically assembling a replacement to the Prutenic Tables . After repeatedly failing to fit the motion of Mars into a circular orbit as required under Copernicanism , he succeeded in matching Tycho 's observations by assuming the orbit was an ellipse and the Sun was located at one of the foci . His model became the basis for Kepler 's laws of planetary motion , which were published in his multi @-@ volume work Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae ( Epitome of Copernican Astronomy ) between 1615 and 1621 .

 At its closest approach , the angular size of Mars is 25 arcseconds ; this is much too small for the naked eye to resolve . Hence , prior to the invention of the telescope , nothing was known about the planet besides its position on the sky . The Italian scientist Galileo Galilei was the first person known to use a telescope to make astronomical observations . His records indicate that he began observing Mars through a telescope in September 1610 . This instrument was too primitive to display any surface detail on the planet , so he set the goal of seeing if Mars exhibited phases of partial darkness similar to Venus or the Moon . Although uncertain of his success , by December he did note that Mars had shrunk in angular size . Polish astronomer Johannes Hevelius succeeded in observing a phase of Mars in 1645 . 
 In 1644 , the Italian Jesuit <unk> Bartoli reported seeing two darker patches on Mars . During the oppositions of 1651 , 1653 and 1655 , when the planet made its closest approaches to the Earth , the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Riccioli and his student Francesco Maria Grimaldi noted patches of differing reflectivity on Mars . The first person to draw a map of Mars that displayed terrain features was the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens . On November 28 , 1659 he made an illustration of Mars that showed the distinct dark region now known as Syrtis Major Planum , and possibly one of the polar ice caps . The same year , he succeeded in measuring the rotation period of the planet , giving it as approximately 24 hours . He made a rough estimate of the diameter of Mars , guessing that it is about 60 % of the size of the Earth , which compares well with the modern value of 53 % . Perhaps the first definitive mention of Mars 's southern polar ice cap was by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini , in 1666 . That same year , he used observations of the surface markings on Mars to determine a rotation period of 24h 40m . This differs from the currently @-@ accepted value by less than three minutes . In 1672 , Huygens noticed a fuzzy white cap at the north pole . 
 After Cassini became the first director of the Paris Observatory in 1671 , he tackled the problem of the physical scale of the Solar System . The relative size of the planetary orbits was known from Kepler 's third law , so what was needed was the actual size of one of the planet 's orbits . For this purpose , the position of Mars was measured against the background stars from different points on the Earth , thereby measuring the diurnal parallax of the planet . During this year , the planet was moving past the point along its orbit where it was nearest to the Sun ( a perihelic opposition ) , which made this a particularly close approach to the Earth . Cassini and Jean Picard determined the position of Mars from Paris , while the French astronomer Jean Richer made measurements from Cayenne , South America . Although these observations were hampered by the quality of the instruments , the parallax computed by Cassini came within 10 % of the correct value . The English astronomer John Flamsteed made comparable measurement attempts and had similar results . 
 In 1704 , Italian astronomer Jacques Philippe <unk> " made a systematic study of the southern cap and observed that it underwent " variations as the planet rotated . This indicated that the cap was not centered on the pole . He observed that the size of the cap varied over time . The German @-@ born British astronomer Sir William Herschel began making observations of the planet Mars in 1777 , particularly of the planet 's polar caps . In 1781 , he noted that the south cap appeared " extremely large " , which he ascribed to that pole being in darkness for the past twelve months . By 1784 , the southern cap appeared much smaller , thereby suggesting that the caps vary with the planet 's seasons and thus were made of ice . In 1781 , he estimated the rotation period of Mars as 24h <unk> <unk> and measured the axial tilt of the planet 's poles to the orbital plane as 28 @.@ 5 ° . He noted that Mars had a " considerable but moderate atmosphere , so that its inhabitants probably enjoy a situation in many respects similar to ours " . Between 1796 and 1809 , the French astronomer Honoré <unk> noticed obscurations of Mars , suggesting " ochre @-@ colored veils " covered the surface . This may be the earliest report of yellow clouds or storms on Mars .

 At the start of the 19th century , improvements in the size and quality of telescope optics proved a significant advance in observation capability . Most notable among these enhancements was the two @-@ component achromatic lens of the German optician Joseph von Fraunhofer that essentially eliminated coma — an optical effect that can distort the outer edge of the image . By 1812 , Fraunhofer had succeeded in creating an achromatic objective lens 190 mm ( 7 @.@ 5 in ) in diameter . The size of this primary lens is the main factor in determining the light gathering ability and resolution of a refracting telescope . During the opposition of Mars in 1830 , the German astronomers Johann Heinrich Mädler and Wilhelm Beer used a 95 mm ( 3 @.@ 7 in ) Fraunhofer refracting telescope to launch an extensive study of the planet . They chose a feature located 8 ° south of the equator as their point of reference . ( This was later named the Sinus Meridiani , and it would become the zero meridian of Mars . ) During their observations , they established that most of Mars ' surface features were permanent , and more precisely determined the planet 's rotation period . In 1840 , Mädler combined ten years of observations to draw the first map of Mars . Rather than giving names to the various markings , Beer and Mädler simply designated them with letters ; thus Meridian Bay ( Sinus Meridiani ) was feature " a " . 
 Working at the Vatican Observatory during the opposition of Mars in 1858 , Italian astronomer Angelo Secchi noticed a large blue triangular feature , which he named the " Blue Scorpion " . This same seasonal cloud @-@ like formation was seen by English astronomer J. Norman Lockyer in 1862 , and it has been viewed by other observers . During the 1862 opposition , Dutch astronomer Frederik Kaiser produced drawings of Mars . By comparing his illustrations to those of Huygens and the English natural philosopher Robert Hooke , he was able to further refine the rotation period of Mars . His value of 24h 37m <unk> is accurate to within a tenth of a second . 
 Father Secchi produced some of the first color illustrations of Mars in 1863 . He used the names of famous explorers for the distinct features . In 1869 , he observed two dark linear features on the surface that he referred to as canali , which is Italian for ' channels ' or ' grooves ' . In 1867 , English astronomer Richard A. Proctor created a more detailed map of Mars based on the 1864 drawings of English astronomer William R. Dawes . Proctor named the various lighter or darker features after astronomers , past and present , who had contributed to the observations of Mars . During the same decade , comparable maps and nomenclature were produced by the French astronomer Camille Flammarion and the English astronomer Nathan Green . 
 At the University of Leipzig in 1862 – 64 , German astronomer Johann K. F. Zöllner developed a custom photometer to measure the reflectivity of the Moon , planets and bright stars . For Mars , he derived an albedo of 0 @.@ 27 . Between 1877 and 1893 , German astronomers Gustav Müller and Paul Kempf observed Mars using Zöllner 's photometer . They found a small phase coefficient — the variation in reflectivity with angle — indicating that the surface of Mars is smooth and without large irregularities . In 1867 , French astronomer Pierre Janssen and British astronomer William Huggins used spectroscopes to examine the atmosphere of Mars . Both compared the optical spectrum of Mars to that of the Moon . As the spectrum of the latter did not display absorption lines of water , they believed they had detected the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere of Mars . This result was confirmed by German astronomer Herman C. Vogel in 1872 and English astronomer Edward W. Maunder in 1875 , but would later come into question . 
 A particularly favorable perihelic opposition occurred in 1877 . The English astronomer David Gill used this opportunity to measure the diurnal parallax of Mars from Ascension Island , which led to a parallax estimate of 8 @.@ 78 ± 0 @.@ 01 arcseconds . Using this result , he was able to more accurately determine the distance of the Earth from the Sun , based upon the relative size of the orbits of Mars and the Earth . He noted that the edge of the disk of Mars appeared fuzzy because of its atmosphere , which limited the precision he could obtain for the planet 's position . 
 In August 1877 , the American astronomer Asaph Hall discovered the two moons of Mars using a 660 mm ( 26 in ) telescope at the U.S. Naval Observatory . The names of the two satellites , Phobos and Deimos , were chosen by Hall based upon a suggestion by Henry Madan , a science instructor at Eton College in England . 
 = = Martian canals = = 
 During the 1877 opposition , Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli used a 22 cm ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) telescope to help produce the first detailed map of Mars . These maps notably contained features he called canali , which were later shown to be an optical illusion . These canali were supposedly long straight lines on the surface of Mars to which he gave names of famous rivers on Earth . His term canali was popularly mistranslated in English as canals . In 1886 , the English astronomer William F. Denning observed that these linear features were irregular in nature and showed concentrations and interruptions . By 1895 , English astronomer Edward Maunder became convinced that the linear features were merely the summation of many smaller details . 
 In his 1892 work La <unk> Mars et ses conditions d <unk> , Camille Flammarion wrote about how these channels resembled man @-@ made canals , which an intelligent race could use to redistribute water across a dying Martian world . He advocated for the existence of such inhabitants , and suggested they may be more advanced than humans . 
 Influenced by the observations of Schiaparelli , Percival Lowell founded an observatory with 30 @-@ and @-@ 45 cm ( 12 @-@ and @-@ 18 in ) telescopes . The observatory was used for the exploration of Mars during the last good opportunity in 1894 and the following less favorable oppositions . He published books on Mars and life on the planet , which had a great influence on the public . The canali were found by other astronomers , such as Henri Joseph <unk> and Louis <unk> using a 38 cm ( 15 in ) refractor at the Nice Observatory in France , one of the largest telescopes of that time . 
 Beginning in 1901 , American astronomer A. E. Douglass attempted to photograph the canal features of Mars . These efforts appeared to succeed when American astronomer Carl O. <unk> published photographs of the supposed canals in 1905 . Although these results were widely accepted , they became contested by Greek astronomer Eugène M. Antoniadi , English naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace and others as merely imagined features . As bigger telescopes were used , fewer long , straight canali were observed . During an observation in 1909 by Flammarion with a 84 cm ( 33 in ) telescope , irregular patterns were observed , but no canali were seen .

 Surface obscuration caused by yellow clouds had been noted in the 1870s when they were observed by Schiaparelli . Evidence for such clouds was observed during the oppositions of 1892 and 1907 . In 1909 , Antoniadi noted that the presence of yellow clouds was associated with the obscuration of albedo features . He discovered that Mars appeared more yellow during oppositions when the planet was closest to the Sun and was receiving more energy . He suggested windblown sand or dust as the cause of the clouds . 
 In 1894 , American astronomer William W. Campbell found that the spectrum of Mars was identical to the spectrum of the Moon , throwing doubt on the burgeoning theory that the atmosphere of Mars is similar to that of the Earth . Previous detections of water in the atmosphere of Mars were explained by unfavorable conditions , and Campbell determined that the water signature came entirely from the Earth 's atmosphere . Although he agreed that the ice caps did indicate there was water in the atmosphere , he did not believe the caps were sufficiently large to allow the water vapor to be detected . At the time , Campbell 's results were considered controversial and were criticized by members of the astronomical community , but they were confirmed by American astronomer Walter S. Adams in 1925 . 
 Baltic German astronomer Hermann Struve used the observed changes in the orbits of the Martian moons to determine the gravitational influence of the planet 's oblate shape . In 1895 , he used this data to estimate that the equatorial diameter was 1 / 190 larger than the polar diameter . In 1911 , he refined the value to 1 / 192 . This result was confirmed by American meteorologist Edgar W. Woolard in 1944 . 
 Using a vacuum thermocouple attached to the 2 @.@ 54 m ( 100 in ) Hooker Telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory , in 1924 the American astronomers Seth Barnes Nicholson and Edison Pettit were able to measure the thermal energy being radiated by the surface of Mars . They determined that the temperature ranged from − 68 ° C ( − 90 ° F ) at the pole up to 7 ° C ( 45 ° F ) at the midpoint of the disk ( corresponding to the equator ) . Beginning in the same year , radiated energy measurements of Mars were made by American physicist William Coblentz and American astronomer Carl Otto <unk> . The results showed that the night time temperature on Mars dropped to − 85 ° C ( − 121 ° F ) , indicating an " enormous diurnal fluctuation " in temperatures . The temperature of Martian clouds was measured as − 30 ° C ( − 22 ° F ) . In 1926 , by measuring spectral lines that were redshifted by the orbital motions of Mars and Earth , American astronomer Walter Sydney Adams was able to directly measure the amount of oxygen and water vapor in the atmosphere of Mars . He determined that " extreme desert conditions " were prevalent on Mars . In 1934 , Adams and American astronomer Theodore Dunham , Jr. found that the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere of Mars was less than one percent of the amount over a comparable area on Earth . 
 In 1927 , Dutch graduate student <unk> Annius van den Bosch made a determination of the mass of Mars based upon the motions of the Martian moons , with an accuracy of 0 @.@ 2 % . This result was confirmed by the Dutch astronomer Willem de Sitter and published posthumously in 1938 . Using observations of the near Earth asteroid Eros from 1926 to 1945 , German @-@ American astronomer Eugene K. Rabe was able to make an independent estimate the mass of Mars , as well as the other planets in the inner Solar System , from the planet 's gravitational perturbations of the asteroid . His estimated margin of error was 0 @.@ 05 % , but subsequent checks suggested his result was poorly determined compared to other methods . 
 During the 1920s , French astronomer Bernard Lyot used a polarimeter to study the surface properties of the Moon and planets . In 1929 , he noted that the polarized light emitted from the Martian surface is very similar to that radiated from the Moon , although he speculated that his observations could be explained by frost and possibly vegetation . Based on the amount of sunlight scattered by the Martian atmosphere , he set an upper limit of 1 / 15 the thickness of the Earth 's atmosphere . This restricted the surface pressure to no greater than 2 @.@ 4 kPa ( 24 mbar ) . Using infrared spectrometry , in 1947 the Dutch @-@ American astronomer Gerard Kuiper detected carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere . He was able to estimate that the amount of carbon dioxide over a given area of the surface is double that on the Earth . However , because he overestimated the surface pressure on Mars , Kuiper concluded erroneously that the ice caps could not be composed of frozen carbon dioxide . In 1948 , American meteorologist Seymour L. Hess determined that the formation of the thin Martian clouds would only require 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 16 in ) of water precipitation and a vapor pressure of 0 @.@ 1 kPa ( 1 @.@ 0 mbar ) . 
 The first standard nomenclature for Martian albedo features was introduced by the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) when in 1960 they adopted 128 names from the 1929 map of Antoniadi named La Planète Mars . The Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature ( <unk> ) was established by the IAU in 1973 to standardize the naming scheme for Mars and other bodies . 
 = = Remote sensing = = 
 The International Planetary Patrol Program was formed in 1969 as a consortium to continually monitor planetary changes . This worldwide group focused on observing dust storms on Mars . Their images allow Martian seasonal patterns to be studied globally , and they showed that most Martian dust storms occur when the planet is closest to the Sun . 
 Since the 1960s , robotic spacecraft have been sent to explore Mars from orbit and the surface in extensive detail . In addition , remote sensing of Mars from Earth by ground @-@ based and orbiting telescopes has continued across much of the electromagnetic spectrum . These include infrared observations to determine the composition of the surface , ultraviolet and submillimeter observation of the atmospheric composition , and radio measurements of wind velocities . 
 The Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) has been used to perform systematic studies of Mars and has taken the highest resolution images of Mars ever captured from Earth . This telescope can produce useful images of the planet when it is at an angular distance of at least 50 ° from the Sun . The HST can take images of a hemisphere , which yields views of entire weather systems . Earth @-@ based telescopes equipped with charge @-@ coupled devices can produce useful images of Mars , allowing for regular monitoring of the planet 's weather during oppositions . 
 X @-@ ray emission from Mars was first observed by astronomers in 2001 using the Chandra X @-@ ray Observatory , and in 2003 it was shown to have two components . The first component is caused by X @-@ rays from the Sun scattering off the upper Martian atmosphere ; the second comes from interactions between ions that result in an exchange of charges . The emission from the latter source has been observed out to eight times the radius of Mars by the XMM @-@ Newton orbiting observatory . 
 In 1983 , the analysis of the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ( SNC ) group of meteorites showed that they may have originated on Mars . The Allan Hills 84001 meteorite , discovered in Antarctica in 1984 , is believed to have originated on Mars but it has an entirely different composition than the SNC group . In 1996 , it was announced that this meteorite might contain evidence for microscopic fossils of Martian bacteria . However , this finding remains controversial . Chemical analysis of the Martian meteorites found on Earth suggests that the ambient near @-@ surface temperature of Mars has most likely been below the freezing point of water ( 0 C ° ) for much of the last four billion years .

 Tirunelveli was known in Sambandar 's seventh @-@ century Saiva canonical work Tevaram as <unk> . Nellaiappar temple inscriptions indicate that Shiva ( as <unk> ) descended in the form of a hedge and roof to save the paddy crop of a devotee . In Hindu legend , the place was known as <unk> ( " forest of bamboo " ) due to the presence of bamboo in the temple under which the deity is believed to have appeared . The early Pandyas named the city <unk> , the Cholas <unk> <unk> and the Nayaks Tirunelveli Seemai ; it was known as <unk> by the British , and <unk> after independence . The word Tirunelveli is derived from three Tamil words : <unk> , nel and <unk> , meaning " sacred paddy hedge " . 
 = = History = = 
 The history of Tirunelveli was researched by Robert Caldwell ( 1814 – 91 ) , a Christian missionary who visited the area . Tirunelveli was under the rule of Pandya kings as their secondary capital ; Madurai was the empire 's primary capital . The Pandya dynasty in the region dates to several centuries before the Christian era from inscriptions by Ashoka ( 304 – 232 BCE ) and mention in the Mahavamsa , the Brihat @-@ Samhita and the writings of Megasthenes ( 350 – 290 CE ) . The province came under the rule of Cholas under Rajendra Chola I in 1064 CE ; however , it is unclear whether he conquered the region or obtained it voluntarily . Tirunelveli remained under control of the Cholas until the early 13th century , when the second Pandyan empire was established with Madurai as its capital . 
 The Nellaiappar temple was the royal shrine of the later Pandyas during the 13th and 14th centuries , and the city benefited from dams constructed with royal patronage during the period . After the death of Kulasekara Pandian ( 1268 – 1308 ) , the region was occupied by <unk> rulers and <unk> chieftains ( <unk> , or poligars ) during the 16th century . The <unk> occupied the western foothills and the <unk> , and the Kannadigas settled in the black @-@ soil @-@ rich eastern portion . Tirunelveli was the subsidiary capital of the Madurai Nayaks ; under <unk> Nayak ( 1529 – 64 ) , the city was rebuilt about 1560 . Inscriptions from the Nellaiappar temple indicate generous contributions to the temple . Nayak rule ended in 1736 , and the region was captured by Chanda Sahib ( 1740 – 1754 ) , Arcot Nawab and Muhammed Yusuf Khan ( 1725 – 1764 ) during the mid @-@ 18th century . 
 In 1743 Nizam @-@ ul @-@ mulk , lieutenant of the Deccan Plateau , displaced most of the Marathas from the region and Tirunelveli came under the rule of the Nawabs of Arcot . The original power lay in the hands of the polygars , who were originally military chiefs of the Nayaks . The city was the chief commercial town during the Nawab and Nayak era . The city was known as Nellai <unk> , with <unk> meaning " a developed foreign town " . The polygars built forts in the hills , had 30 @,@ 000 troops and waged war among themselves . In 1755 , the British government sent a mission under Major Heron and Mahfuz Khan which restored some order and bestowed the city to Mahfuz Khan . The poligars waged war against Mahfuz Khan seven miles from Tirunelveli , but were defeated . The failure of Mahfuz Khan led the East India Company to send Muhammed Yusuf for help . Khan became ruler , rebelled in 1763 and was hanged in 1764 . In 1758 , British troops under Colonel Fullarton reduced the <unk> stronghold under Veerapandiya Kattabomman . In 1797 , the first Polygar war broke out between the British ( under Major Bannerman ) and the polygars ( headed by Kattabomman ) . Some polygars ( such as the head of <unk> ) aided the British ; Kattabomman was defeated and hanged in his home province of <unk> . Two years later , another rebellion became known as the Second Polygar War . <unk> fell to the British , after stiff resistance . The Carnatic region came under British rule following a treaty with the Nawab of Carnatic . 
 After acquiring Tirunelveli from the Nawab of Arcot in 1801 , the British anglicised its name to " Tinnevelly " and made it the headquarters of <unk> District . The administrative and military headquarters was located in Palayamkottai ( anglicised as " <unk> " ) , from which attacks against the polygars were launched . After independence both cities reverted to their original names , and Tirunelveli remained the capital of Tirunelveli district . A separate Thoothukudi district was split off in 1986 . And now 30 April 2015 by BJP government it 's known to be said as the one of the 100 smart cities of India

From 1550 until the early modern era , migration to the city from other parts of the state was common and the urban regions became hubs of manufacturing and commerce . Tirunelveli was a strategic point , connecting the eastern and western parts of the peninsula , as well as a trading centre . Records of sea and overland trade between 1700 and 1850 indicate close trading connections with Sri Lanka and Kerala .

 = 1998 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1998 Atlantic hurricane season was one of the deadliest Atlantic hurricane seasons that featured the highest number of storm @-@ related fatalities in over 200 years . It officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30 , dates which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic Ocean . The first tropical cyclone , Tropical Storm Alex , developed on July 27 , and the season 's final storm , Hurricane Nicole , became extratropical on December 1 . The strongest storm , Mitch , was tied with Hurricane Dean for the seventh most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded . Mitch is also the second deadliest Atlantic hurricane in recorded history . The system dropped tremendous amounts of rainfall in Central America , causing 19 @,@ 000 confirmed deaths and at least $ 6 @.@ 2 billion ( 1998 USD ) in damage . The season was the first to feature a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale since Hurricane Andrew in the 1992 season . 
 Several storms made landfall or directly affected land . Hurricane Bonnie made landfall in southeastern North Carolina as a Category 2 hurricane in late August , killing five people and causing about $ 1 billion in damage . Hurricane Earl caused $ 79 million in damage and three deaths after making landfall in Florida as a Category 1 hurricane . The two deadliest and destructive hurricanes of the season , Hurricane Georges and Mitch , caused $ 5 @.@ 9 billion in damage and $ 6 @.@ 2 billion in damage , respectively . Hurricane Georges was an intense Category 4 hurricane that moved through many of the Caribbean Islands , causing significant damage before making landfall near Biloxi , Mississippi . Hurricane Mitch was a very powerful and destructive late @-@ season hurricane that affected much of Central America before making landfall in Florida as a tropical storm . The significant amount of rainfall that Mitch produced across Central America caused significant damage and killed at least 11 @,@ 000 people , making the system the second deadliest hurricane in recorded history , behind only the Great Hurricane of 1780 . 
 = = Season outlooks = = 
 In advance of , and during , each hurricane season , several forecasts of hurricane activity are issued by national meteorological services , scientific agencies , and noted hurricane experts . These include forecasters from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) ' s National Hurricane and Climate Prediction Center 's , William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University ( CSU ) , as well as Weather Research Center ( WRC ) . The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms , hurricanes , and major hurricanes within a particular year . As stated by NOAA and CSU , an average Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 – 2010 contains roughly 12 tropical storms , 6 hurricanes , 3 major hurricanes , and an Accumulated Cyclone Energy ( ACE ) Index of 66 – 103 units . NOAA typically categorizes a season as either above @-@ average , average , of below @-@ average based on the cumulative ACE Index ; however , the number of tropical storms , hurricanes , and major hurricanes within a hurricane season is considered occasionally as well . 
 CSU began issuing outlooks in December 1997 and initially predicted 9 named storms , 5 hurricanes , and 2 major hurricanes would occur in the upcoming season . Later , in April 1998 , CSU released a forecast calling for 10 named storms , 6 hurricanes , and 2 major hurricane . The predictions by CSU in June and August 1998 remained the same as the forecast in April . Additionally , forecasters at CSU predicted that the El Niño event that began in 1997 would dissipate either before or shortly after the 1998 season began . The WRC predicted 8 named storms and 5 hurricanes in early 1998 , but did not include a forecast for the number of major hurricanes . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 The Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1 , 1998 , with the first tropical cyclone developing on July 27 . It was an above average season in which 14 tropical cyclones formed . All fourteen depressions attained tropical storm status and ten of these became a hurricane . Three hurricanes further intensified into major hurricanes . The dissipation of an El Niño in April and the development of a La Niña by June was attributed to the above average activity . Three hurricanes and three tropical storms made landfall during the season and caused at least 19 @,@ 618 deaths and nearly $ 17 @.@ 6 billion in damage . Hurricane Danielle also caused damage , although it never made landfall . The last storm of the season , Hurricane Nicole , dissipated on December 1 , which was the day after the official season ending on November 30 . 
 Activity in the season began slowly , with the first tropical cyclone not forming until July 27 . It did not become Tropical Storm Alex until July 29 , which was an abnormally late first named storm for an Atlantic hurricane season . After being dormant for about two weeks , Hurricane Bonnie developed on August 19 . Thereafter , tropical cyclogenesis became more frequent , with an additional three storms by the end of August . September was the most active month , coinciding with the climatological peak of the season . Six tropical cyclones formed in that month , four of which reached hurricane intensity . Four hurricanes were active on September 26 , with Georges over the Straits of Florida , Ivan in the North Atlantic , Jeanne was located near Cape Verde , and Karl was situated over the Central Atlantic . This was the first such occurrence since August 22 in 1893 . However , three hurricanes also co @-@ existed in the Atlantic on September 11 in 1961 , with a possible fourth . Following a busy September , activity began slowing , starting in October , when only two tropical cyclones developed . However , both storms became a hurricane , with the second cyclone , Hurricane Mitch , become the most intense , deadliest , and costliest storm of the 1998 Atlantic hurricane season . 
 Overall , the season 's activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 182 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots ( 39 mph , 63 km / h ) or tropical storm strength .

 = = = Tropical Storm Alex = = = 
 A tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa on July 26 and rapidly developed a surface circulation by the following day . As a result , it is estimated that Tropical Depression One formed at 1200 UTC on July 27 , while centered about 345 miles ( 555 km ) south @-@ southwest of Cape Verde . Initially , minimal change in structure or convection occurred . However , after an increase in deep convection and satellite intensity estimates of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Alex early on July 29 . Under the influence of a deep @-@ layer ridge , the storm tracked west to west @-@ northwestward at 12 to 17 mph ( 19 to 27 km / h ) . A mid- to upper @-@ level trough located north and west of Alex generated vertical wind shear starting on July 30 , allowing for minimal intensification . 
 Later on July 30 , a burst in deep convection resulted in slight strengthening of the storm . At 0000 UTC on July 31 , Alex attained its peak intensity with a maximum sustained wind speed of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) and a minimum atmospheric pressure of 1 @,@ 000 mbar ( 30 inHg ) . Vertical wind shear prevented Alex from strengthening further and instead caused it to weaken later that day . By August 1 , the low @-@ level circulation became exposed to the south of the remaining deep convection . Later that day , Alex curved northwestward and avoided any threat to the Lesser Antilles . At 1800 UTC on August 1 , the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression . Early on the following day , Alex was considered dissipated after a reconnaissance aircraft failed to locate a closed low @-@ level circulation .

 Tropical Depression Two developed from a tropical wave at 1200 UTC on August 19 , while located well east of the Lesser Antilles . After tracking west @-@ northwestward for 24 hours , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie . While at tropical storm intensity , Bonnie passed north of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands on August 21 . Early on the following day , a hurricane hunter aircraft indicated that the storm strengthened into a hurricane . Bonnie curved north @-@ northwestward on August 23 , shortly before it peaked with winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) . The storm weakened slightly before making landfall near Wilmington , North Carolina with winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) early on August 27 . The storm briefly weakened to a tropical storm later on August 27 , though it re @-@ strengthened into a hurricane as it was re @-@ emerging into the Atlantic . Colder waters weakened Bonnie to a tropical storm by late on August 28 . The storm then accelerated east @-@ northeastward offshore New England and Atlantic Canada , before becoming an extratropical cyclone on August 30 . 
 In South Carolina , strong winds were reported , particularly in Charleston , Georgetown , and Horry Counties . Many trees and power lines were downed in the area ; there was also structural damage . The storm caused two deaths and about $ 25 million in losses in South Carolina . Strong winds lashed Eastern North Carolina , downing numerous trees and power lines , which left about 500 @,@ 000 people without electricity . One person was killed in Barco when a tree fell on a house . In North Carolina alone , damage reached at least $ 240 million . Erosion was also severe , with numerous docks , piers , and bulkheads either damaged or destroyed ; many protective dunes constructed after Hurricane Fran in 1996 were ruined . In Virginia , strong winds in the eastern portions of the state caused some structural damage and downed trees and power lines , leaving about 750 @,@ 000 people without electricity . Damage in Virginia reached approximately $ 95 million . Two other fatalities were reported , one in Rehoboth Beach , Delaware and the other at Cape Cod , Massachusetts . Later in its duration , Bonnie brought rough seas , strong winds , and light rainfall to Newfoundland and Nova Scotia , but caused little damage . Overall , there were five deaths and at least $ 720 million in damage , while other sources claimed that losses reached $ 1 billion .

 An area of disturbed weather developed into Tropical Depression Three at 0600 UTC on August 21 , while located about 305 miles ( 490 km ) east @-@ southeast of Brownsville , Texas . The depression moved generally northwestward throughout its duration . Based on data from oil platforms in the northern Gulf of Mexico , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Charley at 1800 UTC on August 21 . The storm intensified further , with reconnaissance aircraft reporting sustained winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) at 0600 UTC on August 22 . Shortly thereafter , Charley weakened and only four hours later , it made landfall near Port Aransas , Texas with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) . Late on August 22 , the system weakened to a tropical depression . Charley persisted as a tropical cyclone for about 24 hours longer , before dissipating near Del Rio , Texas . 
 Heavy rainfall was reported throughout southern Texas . Del Rio recorded 17 inches ( 432 mm ) of precipitation in a 24 ‑ hour period , a record for the city . Charley was also responsible for serious local flooding in Val Verde County , Texas , where collectively about 2 @,@ 000 houses , mobile homes , and apartments were destroyed . In that county alone , damage was estimated at $ 40 million . Throughout Texas , losses reached about $ 50 million and 13 deaths were confirmed , with an additional 6 people listed as missing . Flooding also occurred in northern Mexico , especially in the state of Coahuila . Ciudad Acuña was inundated with up to 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) of water , which damaged about 450 houses in the city ; seven deaths were also reported in the area . 
 = = = Hurricane Danielle = = = 
 A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic from the west coast of Africa on August 21 . Convection quickly organized and by 0600 UTC on August 24 , Tropical Depression Four developed while located about 690 miles ( 1 @,@ 110 km ) west @-@ southwest of Cape Verde . Favorable conditions allowed strengthening , with an upgrade to Tropical Storm Danielle later that day . The storm sharply intensified and became a hurricane on August 25 . Strengthening continued , with Danielle peaking with winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) on August 26 . However , the storm oscillated in intensity for several days , ranging from a minimal Category 1 to a strong Category 2 hurricane , due to differing atmospheric conditions . While passing north of the Lesser Antilles , Danielle dropped heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico , causing street flooding and damaging at least one home . Damage in Puerto Rico totaled to $ 50 @,@ 000 . 
 Additionally , Danielle crossed seas in the wake of Hurricane Bonnie , also contributing to weakening . After tracking west @-@ northwest for several days , an anticyclone curved the storm to the northeast while it was located northeast of the Bahamas on August 31 . By early on September 2 , Danielle weakened to a Category 1 hurricane , as it was passing northwest of Bermuda . Danielle produced tropical storm force winds on the island . Thereafter , the storm continued to slowly weaken and lose tropical characteristics . At 0000 UTC on September 4 , Danielle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located east @-@ southeast of Newfoundland . The remnant extratropical cyclone reached the British Isles on September 6 , before merging with an extratropical low pressure area two days later . Offshore Newfoundland , rogue waves were reported , though the only effects on land were light rainfall . The remnant extratropical storm associated with Danielle lashed the United Kingdom with large waves . Severe beach erosion and coastal flooding occurred , causing evacuations in Cornwall , England . 
 = = = Hurricane Earl = = = 
 Tropical Depression Five developed from a tropical wave in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico at 1200 UTC on August 31 , while located about midway between Mérida , Yucatán and Tampico , Tamaulipas . The depression is estimated to have strengthened into Tropical Storm Earl six hours later , while located about 575 miles ( 925 km ) south @-@ southwest of New Orleans , Louisiana . The storm headed north @-@ northeastward and was difficult to track , due to multiple centers on satellite imagery . Earl slowly curved east @-@ northeastward and continued strengthening , with reconnaissance aircraft data indicating that the storm reached hurricane intensity at 1200 UTC on September 2 . It briefly became a Category 2 hurricane about six hours later and peaked with winds of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) . However , the storm weakened back to a Category 1 hurricane early on September 3 , before landfall near Panama City , Florida with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . Earl rapidly weakened to a tropical storm about six hours later and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Georgia late on September 3 . 
 Prodigious precipitation fell during its transit of northern Florida , with 16 @.@ 36 inches ( 415 mm ) near of Panama City . In Gulf County , 300 homes were damaged by high winds and floodwaters . At Port St. Joe , storm surge inundated 14 businesses . Storm surge in Franklin County damaged 136 homes and 15 businesses and led to a brief closure of the St. George Causeway . In Wakulla County , 216 homes and businesses were damaged by high winds and flooding . Severe flooding in coastal Taylor County caused significant damage in nine communities , with 66 structures impacted . Five homes were destroyed and 39 others were damaged by flooding in Dixie County . On September 3 , the strongest tornado spawned by Earl in Florida touched down in Citrus County , where it destroyed 8 homes and damaged 24 others . There were 3 fatalities and about $ 76 million in damage in Florida . In other states , heavy rainfall and tornadoes resulted in severe localized damage , particularly in Alabama , Georgia , North Carolina , and South Carolina . A third storm @-@ related fatality occurred in Saint Helena , South Carolina caused by a tornado . Overall , Earl caused 3 deaths and about $ 79 million in damage . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Frances = = = 
 A tropical wave developed into Tropical Depression Six on September 8 , while located about 160 miles ( 260 km ) east of Brownsville , Texas . The depression moved south @-@ southwestward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Frances on September 9 . Frances then executed a small cyclonic loop , moving westward , southward , and then northeastward . By September 10 , the storm moved quickly northward . After re @-@ curving northwestward , Frances peaked with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) early on September 11 , but later then weakened slightly . At 0600 UTC , the storm made landfall near Corpus Christi , Texas with winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . Frances slowly weakened inland and continued northwestward . Early on September 12 , it curved northward , while weakening to a tropical depression . The storm degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure at 1800 UTC on September 13 , while located over northeastern Texas . 
 Early in its duration , Frances interacted with Tropical Storm Javier in the eastern Pacific , resulting in torrential rainfall over Mexico , peaking at 44 @.@ 06 inches ( 1 @,@ 119 mm ) in Escuintla , Chiapas . Roughly 800 @,@ 000 people in Chiapas were directly affected by the flooding . About 36 rivers in the region exceed their banks . Damage was estimated at $ 63 million and at least 229 deaths were confirmed . Severe flooding was also reported in the United States , particularly in Louisiana and Texas . Rainfall from the storm in the United States peaked at 22 @.@ 39 inches ( 569 mm ) in <unk> , Louisiana . Flooding was worst in Calcasieu Parish , where over 20 homes in the <unk> area reported water damage . Tides in Cameron Parish were the highest since Hurricane Carla , causing significant coastal flooding . In Texas , flooding was particularly severe in the eastern portions of the state . More than 1 @,@ 400 homes and businesses in the Houston area alone were either damaged or destroyed by the floods . In the United States , there was about $ 500 million in damage , as well as two fatalities in Louisiana . 
 = = = Hurricane Georges = = = 
 Tropical Depression Seven developed from a tropical wave on September 15 , while located south of Cape Verde . It tracked west @-@ northwestward and intensified into Tropical Storm Georges on September 16 . Favorable conditions such as warm sea surface temperature and good upper @-@ level outflow allowed the storm to rapidly deepen . By September 20 , Georges peaked as a 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) Category 4 hurricane . However , it weakened due to increasing vertical wind shear and winds were 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) when the storm made landfall in Antigua , Saint Kitts and Nevis , and Puerto Rico on September 21 . Georges made another landfall in the Dominican Republic with winds of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) on September 22 . It weakened significantly over Hispaniola , and late on September 23 , Georges struck eastern Cuba with winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . The storm tracked inland near the north coast of Cuba , retaining hurricane @-@ force winds . On September 25 , the storm struck Key West with winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) . After heading northwestward for three days , Georges struck Biloxi at the same intensity . Georges quickly weakened to a tropical depression on September 29 , by which time it turned eastward through the Southeastern United States . By October 1 , it dissipated close to the Atlantic Ocean near the Florida @-@ Georgia border . 
 About 2 @,@ 125 homes were either damaged or destroyed in Antigua and Barbuda , with property losses reaching $ 160 million ; there were also 3 deaths . Roughly 60 % of structures on Saint Kitts were damaged , as were 35 % of structures in Nevis . Five deaths and $ 445 million in damage were reported in Saint Kitts and Nevis . Strong winds and heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico left 96 % of the island without electricity , impacted at least 100 @,@ 610 homes , wiped out more than two @-@ thirds of crops , and caused 8 deaths and $ 2 billion in losses . Heavy precipitation in Dominican Republic caused mudslides , which left about 155 @,@ 000 homeless and damaged buildings and road infrastructure . Additionally , it destroyed 55 % of crops , caused at least 380 deaths , and left about $ 1 @.@ 2 billion in losses . The situation was similar in Haiti , where mudslides left 167 @,@ 332 people homeless , at least 80 % of certain crops ruined , 209 persons dead , and about $ 179 million in damage . In Cuba , mudslides and strong winds damaged 60 @,@ 475 homes , of which 3 @,@ 481 were completely destroyed . Additionally 1 @,@ 117 businesses were damaged , of which 12 were destroyed . Extensive crops losses also occurred . Six deaths and $ 305 @.@ 8 million in damage were reported in Cuba . 
 Hurricane @-@ force winds in the Florida Keys damaged 1 @,@ 536 houses and destroyed 173 homes . In the Florida Panhandle , flooding was extensive because of rainfall up to 38 @.@ 46 inches ( 977 mm ) . Many residents were isolated and 132 roads were closed due to flooding . In Alabama , 251 houses , 16 apartment buildings , and 70 businesses experienced significant impacts at Gulf Shore . About 50 houses were destroyed and another 40 were left uninhabitable on Dauphin Island , Alabama . One fatality was reported in Mobile when a woman was driving and slid off the road into a creek . Mississippi bore the brunt of the storm in the United States . Along the coast of Mississippi , more than 1 @,@ 000 homes were flooded . One of the worst impacted areas inland was Stone County , where 54 homes had minor damage , 26 suffered major damage and 5 were destroyed . Winds also left 230 @,@ 000 people without electricity . In the state of Mississippi alone , there was approximately $ 665 million in losses . In Louisiana , the storm caused three indirect deaths , while strong winds and storm surge impacted at least 70 homes , destroyed 85 fishing camps , and left 160 @,@ 000 people without electricity . Overall , Georges caused at least 615 deaths and roughly $ 9 @.@ 72 billion in losses . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Hermine = = = 
 A tropical wave crossed the Africa coast and entered the Atlantic Ocean on September 5 . It tracked westward for several days , until curving northwestward in the Caribbean Sea near the coast of South America . By September 16 , the system entered the Gulf of Mexico and quickly developed into Tropical Depression Eight on September 17 . The depression executed a cyclonic loop , first heading west @-@ southwest , then south , before curving northeast and finally northward . By September 19 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Hermine . The storm continued north @-@ northeastward until it made landfall near Cocodrie , Louisiana with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) at 0500 UTC on September 20 . Hermine rapidly weakened inland and dissipated in Mississippi late on September 20 . 
 The outer bands of Hermine dropped heavy rainfall throughout Florida . Several traffic accidents occurred as a result , with one man dying after losing control of his vehicle on U.S. Route 441 . Effects overall in Louisiana were minimal , mostly minor flooding . At Lake <unk> , a man went to untangle debris in his boat propeller and attempted to swim after the boat , but instead drowned . Hermine spawned two tornadoes in Mississippi , one of which destroyed two mobile homes , damaged seven cars , and caused one injury . Locally heavy rainfall left parts of Mississippi Highway 27 and U.S. Route 11 in Alabama under water , stranding several motorists . The remnants of Hermine produced more than 10 inches ( 250 mm ) of rain in Charleston , South Carolina , leaving more than 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) of standing water in some neighborhoods . Overall , the storm caused 2 deaths and $ 85 @,@ 000 in damage . 
 = = = Hurricane Ivan = = = 
 A tropical wave developed over western Africa near the Prime meridian on September 14 . Two days later , residual cloudiness and sounding data from Dakar , Senegal , indicated that the system entered the Atlantic Ocean . After the system quickly developed deep convection and improved significantly in organization , it was classified as Tropical Depression Nine starting at 0000 UTC on September 19 , while located approximately 200 miles ( 320 km ) southwest of Cape Verde . The depression initially tracked west to west @-@ southwestward with slow intensification , due to vertical wind shear . By September 20 , an elongated trough turned the depression northwestward . Later that day , the depression strengthened enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Ivan . 
 On September 21 , Ivan re @-@ curved northward , while still in the far eastern Atlantic . While heading north @-@ northwestward on September 23 , the storm briefly weakened , but quickly re @-@ strengthened and became a hurricane later that day . Two days later , Ivan began slowly turning northeastward . At 0600 UTC on September 26 , Ivan attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) and a minimum atmospheric pressure of 975 mbar ( 28 @.@ 8 inHg ) . As it was tracking east @-@ northeastward , Ivan briefly posed a threat to the Azores , though tropical storm or hurricane @-@ force winds did not impact the archipelago . Shortly thereafter , colder sea surface temperatures weakened Ivan to a tropical storm by early on September 27 . Six hours later , the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while northeast of the Azores . 
 = = = Hurricane Jeanne = = = 
 Between September 19 and September 20 , a slow @-@ moving tropical wave crossed the west coast of Africa . By the following day , an increase in deep convection allowed it to be classified as Tropical Depression Ten . Forming about 160 miles ( 260 km ) west of Guinea @-@ Bissau , it was the easternmost tropical cyclone development in the Atlantic basin since Tropical Storm Christine in 1973 . Due to light wind shear , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Jeanne by 1800 UTC on September 21 . Further significant intensification occurred and Jeanne became a hurricane about 24 hours later . Late on September 23 , the storm became a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale . At 1800 UTC on September 24 , Jeanne attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph ( 170 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 969 mbar ( 28 @.@ 6 inHg ) . 
 After peaking as a moderate Category 2 hurricane , an increase in vertical wind shear slowly weakened the storm . Around that time , Jeanne began curving northwestward . By late on September 25 , the storm was downgraded back to a Category 1 hurricane . Three days later , a trough forced Jeanne to accelerate toward the north @-@ northeast . It re @-@ strengthened slightly on September 28 , though the storm began weakening again . Late on September 29 , Jeanne was downgraded to a tropical storm . Shortly before weakening further to a tropical depression on October 1 , a wind gust of 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) was reported on Horta in the Azores . The storm then passed through the Azores , but lost tropical characteristics by 1200 UTC on October 1 . The remnant extratropical cyclone struck Portugal on October 4 and became unidentifiable over Spain later that day . 
 = = = Hurricane Karl = = = 
 A non @-@ tropical low pressure system was first noted on the coast of the Carolinas on September 21 . Deep convection became better organized , and on September 23 , the system was designated as Tropical Depression Eleven while located near Bermuda . Initially , the depression moved quickly towards the east , ahead of a frontal boundary moving off the East Coast of the United States . Early on September 24 , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Karl . At the time , the storm began curved east @-@ southeastward and slowed in forward speed . By later that day , westerly and northwesterly wind shear caused the center to become partially exposed from the deep convection . Despite this , Karl strengthened into a hurricane at 1200 UTC on September 25 . 
 In response to a large mid- to upper @-@ level trough , Karl accelerated towards the northeast . Shortly after developing a well @-@ defined eye , the storm reached its peak intensity of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) at 0000 UTC on September 27 . However , wind shear caused Karl to begin weakening . Later on September 27 , satellite imagery indicated that the cyclone was beginning to lose tropical characteristics . Deep convective activity was limited to the north and northwest of the center , and the low @-@ level center became separated from the center of the cloud circulation . Karl weakened to a tropical storm at 0000 UTC on September 28 , while located near the Azores . Later that day , the storm became extratropical over cooler waters , when the center of circulation became separated from the deep convection . The extratropical remnants were last noted south of Ireland on September 29 . 
 = = = Hurricane Lisa = = = 
 A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on September 29 . The system soon became unidentifiable within the Intertropical Convergence Zone , preventing quick development . However , by October 3 , the system became more distinguishable and better @-@ defined , with a low @-@ level circulation forming on October 4 . It was reported that Tropical Depression Twelve formed at 0000 UTC on October 5 , while located about midway between Africa and the Lesser Antilles . Although strong wind shear kept the depression disorganized , it was able to intensify into Tropical Storm Lisa about six hours later . Because of unfavorable conditions , further intensification was deemed unlikely . Lisa initially tracked northwestward , though by October 6 , an upper @-@ level low pressure system caused the storm to turn northeastward . 
 A baroclinic trough within the westerlies transitioned into a deep low , causing Lisa to accelerate starting on October 7 . Despite winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) at a buoy and an improved appearance on satellite imagery , no strengthening was predicted . By October 8 , convection persisted near the center and banding features developed . Lisa further accelerated , with forward speed reaching over 58 mph ( 93 km / h ) on October 9 . Later that day , a deep low to the west and a strong high pressure system to the east caused Lisa to turn northward . At 1200 UTC on October 9 , Lisa unexpectedly strengthened into a hurricane , simultaneously peaking with winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . Later that day , the storm began merging with an extratropical frontal system and eventually became unidentifiable by early on October 10 . 
 = = = Hurricane Mitch = = = 
 Tropical Depression Thirteen was spawned by a tropical wave on October 22 , while located offshore Colombia in the Caribbean Sea . Later that day , the depression became Tropical Storm Mitch , and within two days it intensified into a hurricane . While curving westward , the storm rapidly deepened , reaching its peak as a Category 5 hurricane with winds of 180 mph ( 285 km / h ) and a minimum pressure of 905 mbar ( 26 @.@ 7 inHg ) late on October 26 . Mitch weakened significantly while turning to the south , and on October 29 it moved ashore with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) east of La Ceiba , Honduras . It quickly weakened to a tropical storm , but did deteriorate into a tropical depression until October 31 while over Central America . Mitch degenerated into a low pressure area on November 2 near the border of Mexico and Guatemala , although it was re @-@ designated a tropical storm on November 3 , after emerging into the Bay of Campeche . After turning to the northeast , the storm struck the city of Campeche early on November 4 , and Mitch briefly weakened into a tropical depression over the Yucatán Peninsula . The storm re @-@ intensified after reaching the Gulf of Mexico again , and Mitch made its final landfall near Naples , Florida with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) on November 5 . Shortly thereafter the storm became extratropical near the northern Bahamas , which lasted several more days while crossing the Atlantic Ocean . 
 Heavy rainfall in Jamaica flooded numerous houses and caused three fatalities from mudslides . Strong winds , rough seas , and large amounts of precipitation resulted in minor effects in Cuba and the Cayman Islands . Offshore Honduras , the Fantome sank , drowning all 31 people on board . In Honduras , the large and slow @-@ moving storm dropped 35 @.@ 89 inches ( 912 mm ) of rain , causing the destruction of at least 70 % of the country 's crops and an estimated 70 @-@ 80 % of road infrastructure . About 25 villages were completely dismantled , while about 33 @,@ 000 homes were destroyed and another 50 @,@ 000 were damaged . Damage totaled about $ 3 @.@ 8 billion in Honduras and at least 14 @,@ 600 fatalities were reported . In Nicaragua , rainfall totals may have reached 50 inches ( 1 @,@ 300 mm ) . Over 1 @,@ 700 miles ( 2 @,@ 700 km ) of roads required replacement or repairs , while effects to agriculture were significant . Almost 24 @,@ 000 houses were destroyed and an additional 17 @,@ 600 were damaged . About 3 @,@ 800 deaths and $ 1 billion in damage were reported in Nicaragua . In Costa Rica , the storm impacted 2 @,@ 135 homes , of which 241 were destroyed . Extensive road infrastructure and crop damage was also reported . There were 7 people killed and $ 92 million in damage in Costa Rica . 
 The storm caused flooding as far south as Panama , where three fatalities occurred . Flash flooding and landslides in El Salvador damaged more than 10 @,@ 000 homes , 1 @,@ 200 miles ( 1 @,@ 900 km ) of roadway , and caused heavy losses to crops and livestock . Damage totaled $ 400 million and 240 deaths were confirmed . Effects were similar but slightly more significant in Guatemala , where 6 @,@ 000 houses were destroyed and an additional 20 @,@ 000 were impacted to some degree . Additionally , 840 miles ( 1 @,@ 350 km ) of roads were affected , with nearly 400 miles ( 640 km ) of it being major highways . Crop damage in Guatemala alone was nearly $ 500 million . It was reported that 268 deaths and $ 748 million in losses occurred in Guatemala . The storm caused relatively minor effects in Mexico and Belize , with 9 and 11 fatalities in both countries , respectively . Mitch brought tropical storm winds to South Florida and rainfall up to 11 @.@ 20 inches ( 284 mm ) . In the Florida Keys , several buildings that were damaged by Georges were destroyed by Mitch . Tornadoes in the state spawned by Mitch damaged or destroyed 645 houses . The storm caused two fatalities and $ 40 million in damage in Florida . Overall , Mitch caused $ 6 @.@ 2 billion in losses and at least 18 @,@ 974 people were left dead . 
 = = = Hurricane Nicole = = = 
 An intense frontal low that persisted near the Canary Islands gradually acquired tropical characteristics and a low @-@ level circulation . Tropical Depression Fourteen developed at 0000 UTC on November 24 , while located about 615 miles ( 990 km ) west @-@ southwest of La Palma , Canary Islands . Due to light wind shear , Nicole was able to strengthen swiftly while tracking west @-@ southwestward , reaching winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) later that day . However , on November 25 , wind shear increased , causing the storm to weaken . By 1200 UTC on November 26 , Nicole was downgraded to a tropical depression . The low @-@ level circulation became almost entirely devoid of deep convection . As a result , the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories on Nicole at 1500 UTC on November 26 and did not forecast re @-@ development . However , post @-@ analysis indicates that Nicole remained a tropical cyclone . 
 At 1500 UTC on November 27 , the National Hurricane Center resumed advisories after Nicole unexpectedly " regenerated " . Deep convection began re @-@ developing and about three hours later , Nicole was upgraded back to a tropical storm . Under the influence of a cold front , Nicole curved northeastward starting on November 27 . While crossing sea surface temperatures that were 2 to 3 ° F ( 3 @.@ 6 to 5 @.@ 4 ° C ) above normal , the storm began to significantly intensify . After development of an eye and increasing satellite intensity estimates , Nicole was upgraded to a hurricane early on November 30 . Twenty @-@ four hours later , Nicole attained its peak intensity with a maximum sustained wind speed of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) and a minimum atmospheric pressure of 979 mbar ( 28 @.@ 9 inHg ) . However , Nicole weakened to a tropical storm later on December 1 , while also losing tropical characteristics . By 1800 UTC on December 1 , the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located northwest of the Azores .

 = Mycena atkinsoniana = 
 Mycena atkinsoniana is a species of agaric fungus in the Mycenaceae family . It is one of the so @-@ called " bleeding mycenas " that will ooze yellow to orange juice when injured . Other distinguishing features include the upper stem surface that is decorated with tiny purplish @-@ brown fibers , and the gills , which are pale yellow with maroon edges . The reddish @-@ brown caps are smooth with a grooved margin , and up to 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) wide . Mycena atkinsoniana is known from the United States and Canada , where it grows scattered or in groups on leaf litter in forests during the summer and autumn . It was originally described from collections associated with beech , but it is also frequently found under eastern North American oaks . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was first described in 1935 as Mycena fagicola by American mycologist Alexander H. Smith , based on specimens that he collected the previous year in Cross Village , Michigan . The naming , however , was illegitimate , as it had been previously used by Camille <unk> ( as Mycena fagicola <unk> apud <unk> published in 1885 ) , so Smith changed the specific epithet to atkinsoniana in his 1947 monograph on North American Mycena species . Smith credited George Francis Atkinson with one of the early collections of the fungus in his 1935 species description . Mycena specialist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus agreed with Smith 's decision to change the epithet , concluding that although <unk> 's name was a nomen nudum ( written without an adequate description ) , he conceded that " the possibility cannot be excluded that one day some overlooked 19th century booklet or <unk> will turn up containing a description " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap is 1 – 30 mm ( 0 @.@ 04 – 1 @.@ 18 in ) broad , initially obtuse to convex , later becoming broadly umbonate . Eventually the cap flattens , sometimes with the disc ( the central region of the cap ) slightly depressed . The cap margin initially touches the stem ; as it expands it becomes somewhat wavy . The extreme margin is marked by small lines , grooves or ridges when the cap is moist . The cap is initially covered with white powdery granules , but this later sloughs off to leave a smooth surface . The disc is brownish when young , but soon develops reddish tones ; older specimens are bay to Isabella , with lighter @-@ colored margins . The flesh is buff @-@ colored , and oozes an orange @-@ yellow juice when cut . The gills have an adnate attachment to the stem . They have a close to moderately crowded spacing , with between 23 and 26 gills reaching the stem . The gills are narrow to moderately broad , <unk> when young , somewhat darker in age , with edges that are maroon , and either crenulate ( finely scalloped ) or even . The stem is 2 – 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 6 in ) long , 2 – 3 mm thick , and more or less equal in width throughout . The stem base is rooted among the leaves and debris , and the base is covered with short stiff hairs pressed flat against the surface . Its surface is covered sparsely with minute purplish brown fibrils . The stem is dull reddish brown overall , but the color fades near the top . When mushroom tissue is cut or injured , it oozes a dull reddish @-@ brown juice or , in old specimens , a dull orange juice . M. atkinsoniana mushrooms have no distinctive taste or odor . 
 The spores are narrowly to broadly ellipsoid , amyloid ( staining black to blue @-@ black in Melzer 's reagent ) , and measure 7 – 9 by 4 – 5 μm . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are four @-@ spored and measure 28 – 30 by 6 – 7 μm . Cheilocystidia are plentiful , and arranged so as to form a sterile band on the edge of the gill . Measuring , they are narrowly fusoid ( tapered at each end ) , smooth , and have dark reddish contents . The pleurocystidia ( cystidia on the gill face ) similar in appearance to the cheilocystidia but far less abundant . Gill tissue is yellowish to very faintly vinaceous @-@ brown when stained with iodine . The tissue of the cap consists of several layers . The outer surface comprises a thin cuticle made of narrow hyphae filled with dark @-@ reddish material . Underlying this layer this is a region of <unk> ( swollen like a bladder ) cells , while the remainder of the cap tissue consists of narrower woolly hyphae . Both layers of tissue beneath the cuticle will stain very faintly vinaceous @-@ brown in iodine ; the stem tissue , in contrast , stains dark vinaceous @-@ brown in iodine . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 The " bleeding " will distinguish Mycena atkinsoniana from most other Mycena species commonly encountered . The common and widely distributed M. sanguinolenta is another " bleeder " , but it is smaller than M. <unk> , with a cap diameter ranging from 3 to 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 1 to 0 @.@ 6 in ) . Additionally , it has distantly spaced gills and a stem that is the same color as the cap , and a dark red juice . M. atkinsoniana is also similar in stature to M. <unk> ( a non @-@ bleeding species ) , but several field characteristics distinguish M. <unk> , including a radish @-@ like odor and taste , a purplish to lilac @-@ colored cap , and purple @-@ gray gills with dark purple edges . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 The fungus is saprobic , and so derives nutrients from breaking down dead plant material , such as leaves , bark , needles , and twigs , that has fallen to the ground . Fruit bodies are usually found growing in groups or scattered on leaf litter in beech and beech @-@ hemlock forests during the summer and autumn , although it has been recorded growing on lawns . It is also often found under eastern North American oaks . The distribution includes the US states Connecticut , New York , Ohio , Michigan , and Vermont . It has also been collected in Quebec , Canada .

 For Your Eyes Only is a collection of short stories by the British author Ian Fleming , featuring the fictional British Secret Service agent Commander James Bond . It was first published by Jonathan Cape on 11 April 1960 . It marked a change of format for Fleming , who had previously written James Bond stories only as full @-@ length novels . 
 The collection contains five short stories : " From a View to a Kill " , " For Your Eyes Only " , " Quantum of Solace " , " Risico " and " The Hildebrand Rarity " . Four of the stories were adaptations of plots for a television series that was never filmed , while the fifth Fleming had written previously but not published . Fleming undertook some minor experiments with the format , including a story written as an homage to W. Somerset Maugham , an author he greatly admired . 
 Elements from the stories have been used in a number of the Eon Productions James Bond film series , including the 1981 film , For Your Eyes Only , starring Roger Moore as James Bond . The film used some elements and characters from the short stories " For Your Eyes Only " and " Risico " . " From a View to a Kill " also gave part of its title ( but no characters or plot elements ) to the fourteenth Bond film , A View to a Kill ( 1985 ) . Plot elements from " The Hildebrand Rarity " were used in the sixteenth Bond film , Licence to Kill ( 1989 ) , and the twenty @-@ fourth Bond film Spectre references the title . " Quantum of Solace " was used as the title for the twenty @-@ second Bond film .

 Bond investigates the murder of a motorcycle dispatch @-@ rider and the theft of his top @-@ secret documents by a motorcycle @-@ riding assassin . The rider was en route from SHAPE , the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe , then located in Versailles , to his base , Station F , in Saint @-@ Germain in France . Since Bond is already in Paris , his superior , M , sends him to assist in the investigation in any way he can . Bond disguises himself as a dispatch @-@ rider and follows the same journey to Station F as the previous rider : as expected , the assassin attempts to kill Bond . Bond , however , is ready and kills the assassin . He then uncovers the assassin 's hidden base of operations .

 " For Your Eyes Only " begins with the murder of the Havelocks , a British couple in Jamaica who have refused to sell their estate to Herr von Hammerstein , a former Gestapo officer who is the chief of counterintelligence for the Cuban secret service . They are killed by two Cuban hitmen at the direction of their leader , Major Gonzales ; all three work for von Hammerstein . The Havelocks turn out to be close friends of M , who served as the groom 's best man during their wedding in 1925 . M subsequently gives Bond a voluntary assignment , unconnected to sanctioned Secret Service duties , to travel to Vermont via Canada , find von Hammerstein at his rented estate at Echo Lake and assassinate him as a warning to future criminals who might think to target British citizens . When Bond arrives on the scene , he finds the Havelocks ' daughter , Judy , who intends to carry out her own mission of revenge with a bow and arrow . Judy kills von Hammerstein by shooting him in the back with an arrow from 100 yards ( 91 m ) away at the exact moment that he dives into a lake . A shoot @-@ out then occurs between Bond and Gonzales and the two Cuban gunmen . Bond kills all of them and returns to Canada with Judy , who has been wounded during the gunfight .

 After completing a mission in the Bahamas , Bond is in Nassau and attends a dinner party at Government House . When the other guests have left , Bond remarks that if he ever marries , he imagines it would be nice to marry an air hostess . The Governor then tells Bond the story of a relationship between a former civil servant , Philip Masters and air hostess Rhoda Llewellyn . After meeting aboard a flight to London , the couple married , and went to live in Bermuda , but after a time Rhoda began a long open affair with the eldest son of a rich Bermudian family . As a result , Masters ' work deteriorated , and he suffered a nervous breakdown . After recovering , he was given a break from Bermuda by the governor and sent on an assignment to Washington . Upon his return Masters was determined to end his marriage and he divided their home into two sections , half to each of them and refused to have anything to do with his wife in private — although they continued to appear as a couple in public . He eventually returned to the UK alone , leaving Rhoda with unpaid debts and stranded in Bermuda — a cruel act which he would have been incapable of carrying out just a few months earlier . The governor explains his point to Bond : when the " Quantum of Solace " drops to zero , humanity and consideration of one human for another is gone and the relationship is finished . Despite the success of Masters ' plan to take revenge on his unfaithful wife , he never recovered emotionally . After a time , Rhoda married a rich Canadian . The governor then reveals that the dinner companions whom Bond found dull were in fact Rhoda and her rich Canadian husband .

 Bond is sent by M to investigate a drug @-@ smuggling operation based in Italy that is sending narcotics to England . M instructs Bond to get in touch with a CIA informant , Kristatos , who in turn tells Bond that a man named Enrico Colombo is behind the racket . When Bond sets out to find more information on Colombo , he is captured and brought aboard Colombo 's ship , the Colombina . Colombo informs Bond that Kristatos is actually the one in charge of the drug smuggling operation , and that Kristatos is backed by the Russians . Colombo agrees to help Bond by providing information about things " as long as none of it comes back to Italy " ; Bond agrees to help Colombo eliminate Kristatos . Bond , Colombo , and his men sail the Colombina to Santa Maria when Kristatos 's men are loading another shipment of drugs , they attack Kristatos 's ship and adjacent warehouse and discover Kristatos lurking near the warehouse , preparing to detonate a bomb . Kristatos tries to escape , but is killed by Bond .

 Bond is on an assignment in the Seychelles Islands ; through <unk> Barbey , his influential and well @-@ connected local contact , he meets an uncouth American millionaire named Milton Krest , who challenges the two to aid him in the search for a rare fish , The Hildebrand Rarity . Bond , Barbey , Krest and his English wife , Elizabeth , set off aboard the Wavekrest in search of the fish . During the journey , Bond learns that Milton verbally and physically abuses everyone around him , especially his wife — whom he punishes with the use of a stingray tail he dubs " The Corrector " . Krest finds the Hildebrand Rarity and kills it — along with many other fish — by pouring poison into the water . After finding and killing the Hildebrand Rarity , the Wavekrest sets sail for port . Along the way Krest gets very drunk , insults Bond and Barbey and tells his wife he will beat her again with the stingray tail . Later that night , Bond hears Krest choking ; investigating , Bond finds that Krest has been murdered — apparently by having the rare fish stuffed down his throat . So as not to be entangled in a murder investigation , Bond throws Krest overboard and cleans up the scene of the crime , making it look as though Krest fell overboard after one of the ropes holding his hammock broke : Bond suspects both Barbey and Mrs. Krest , but is unsure which is responsible . However , when Mrs. Krest invites Bond to sail with her to Mombasa — his next destination — aboard the Wavekrest , he accepts her invitation with reservations .

 Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson notes that two of the stories ( " Quantum of Solace " and " The Hildebrand Rarity " ) are experimental for Fleming , whilst the remaining three are straightforward Bond adventures . In the two experimental stories Bond is given something of a more human side , with " Quantum of Solace " evidencing Bond 's reaction to the Governor 's story by showing a compassionate side , as he sees the real life of Philip Masters and Rhoda Llewellyn as being more dramatic than his recent mission ; the forthcoming trip he has to make to the CIA , he now sees as " dull and unexciting " . In " The Hildebrand Rarity " , Bond is also shown with a humanitarian side , with feelings for the plight of Liz at the hands of her husband and for the use of the poison on the fish by Milton Krest . 
 An aspect of Bond 's relationship with M is shown in " For Your Eyes Only " , with Bond taking the decision from M 's shoulders about what should happen to the murderers of M 's friends , the Havelocks ; the scene also shows the reader about the weight of command and M 's indecision as to what path to follow . The daughter of M 's friends , Judy Havelock , is a tough and resourceful character , according to Benson , although after she has revenged her parents ' death and is wounded , softens and allows Bond to take up his usual role of protector . 
 In the " Risico " story , academic Christoph Lindner identifies the character of Enrico Colombo as an example of those characters who have morals closer to those of the traditional villains , but who act on the side of good in support of Bond ; others of this type include Darko Kerim ( From Russia , with Love ) , Tiger Tanaka ( You Only Live Twice ) and Marc @-@ Ange Draco ( On Her Majesty 's Secret Service ) . 
 World War II again makes an appearance in the stories : in For Your Eyes Only , Von Hammerstein is a former Gestapo officer , whilst the RCMP officer , Colonel Johns , served with the British under Montgomery in the Eighth Army . In " The Hildebrand Rarity " Milton Krest is of German descent and " Risico " sees both Enrico Colombo and Aristotle Kristatos as having fought for the British in the war . 
 Justice and revenge are themes that run through two of the stories . In " For Your Eyes Only " the idea of revenge is looked at from a number of angles : Bond 's , M 's and Judy Havelock 's and each has a different interpretation . Bond 's approach to killing is also dissected in " For Your Eyes Only " whilst the morality of killing is a theme in " The Hildebrand Rarity " .

 In the summer of 1958 , CBS television commissioned Fleming to write episodes of a television show based on the James Bond character . This deal came about after the success of the 1954 television adaptation of Casino Royale as an episode of the CBS television series Climax ! . Fleming agreed to the deal , and began to write outlines for the series ; however , CBS later dropped the idea . In January and February 1959 Fleming adapted four of these television plots into short stories at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica and added a fifth story he had written in the summer of 1958 . Fleming biographer Andrew Lycett noted that at the time Fleming was writing both the television scripts , and the short story collection , " Ian 's mood of weariness and self @-@ doubt was beginning to affect his writing " and this can be seen in Bond 's internal monologue of thoughts . 
 " From a View to a Kill " 
 " From a View to a Kill " was initially intended to be the backstory for Hugo Drax , the villain of the novel Moonraker . The story would have taken place during World War II , and featured Drax as the motorcycle assassin who crashes his bike and is taken to an American field hospital . Later , the hospital is bombed , leaving Drax with amnesia and a disfigured face . The story was one that Fleming had drawn up for the television series . The SHAPE head of security , Colonel Schreiber , was designed to be the antithesis of Bond , with greying hair , the air of a bank manager , desk with silver framed photographs of his family and a single white rose ; the description shows Fleming using colour to show Schreiber 's lack of colour and personality . The idea of the underground hideout was inspired by Fleming 's brother Peter 's band of Auxiliary Units who dug tunnel networks in Britain in 1940 as part of a resistance movement in advance of a German invasion . The original name for the story was " The Rough with the Smooth " , which was also the original title of the books , before For Your Eyes Only was chosen for publication . 
 " For Your Eyes Only " 
 The story was originally entitled Man 's Work and was set in Vermont , where Fleming had spent a number of summers at his friend Ivar Bryce 's Black Hollow Farm , which became the model for von Hammerstein 's hideaway , Echo Lake . The name of the villain of the story , Von Hammerstein was taken from General Baron Kurt von Hammerstein @-@ <unk> ( 1878 – 1943 ) , one of Hitler 's opponents . Fleming also considered calling the story " Death Leaves an Echo " and based the story on " Rough Justice " , which was to be episode three of the television series . 
 " Quantum of Solace " 
 " Quantum of Solace " was based on a story told to Fleming by his neighbour and lover Blanche Blackwell about a real @-@ life police inspector , who Fleming turned into the civil servant , Philip Masters . As thanks for the story , Fleming bought Blackwell a Cartier watch . Fleming wrote the story in the style of W Somerset Maugham and this was Fleming 's homage to a writer he greatly admired . The story takes its structure - an agent 's private conversation with a high @-@ ranking diplomat about socially unequal romance - from Maugham 's short story " His Excellency " . " Quantum of Solace " was first published in Modern Woman 's Magazine of November 1959 . 
 " Risico " 
 In 1958 Fleming holidayed with his wife Ann in Venice and at the Lido peninsula ; Fleming was a great admirer of Thomas Mann 's work Death in Venice , which was based on the Lido and the Flemings visited it for that reason , using the location as the backdrop for " Risico " . For the love interest in the story , Lisl , Fleming used the name of an ex @-@ girlfriend from Kitzbühel in Austria , where he had travelled in the 1930s . For the name of Colombo , Fleming borrowed the surname of Gioacchino Colombo , the Ferrari engine designer . 
 " The Hildebrand Rarity " 
 In April 1958 Fleming flew to the Seychelles via Bombay to report for The Sunday Times on a treasure hunt ; although the hunt was not as exciting as he hoped , Fleming used many of the details of the island for " The Hildebrand Rarity " . Fleming combined the backdrop of the Seychelles with his experience he and Blanche Blackwell had undergone when they had visited Pedro Keys , two islands off Jamaica , and watched two scientists do something similar with poison to obtain samples . For the villain of the story , an abusive American millionaire , Fleming used the name Milton Krest : Milton was the code name of a Greek sea captain who ferried British soldiers and agents through German patrols and who received the Distinguished Service Order and an MBE , whilst Krest was the name of tonic and ginger beer Fleming drank in Seychelles . " The Hildebrand Rarity " was first published in Playboy in March 1960 .

 For Your Eyes Only was published on 11 April 1960 in the UK as a hardcover edition by publishers Jonathan Cape ; it was 252 pages long and cost fifteen shillings . The subtitle , Five Secret Occasions in the Life of James Bond , was added for publication ; 21 @,@ 712 copies were printed and quickly sold out . For Your Eyes Only was published in the US in August 1960 by Viking Press and the subtitle was changed to Five Secret Exploits of James Bond ; in later editions , it was dropped altogether . 
 Artist Richard Chopping once again provided the cover art for the book . On 18 March 1959 Fleming had written to Chopping about the cover he had undertaken for Goldfinger , saying that : " The new jacket is quite as big a success as the first one and I do think [ Jonathan ] Cape have made a splendid job of it " . Moving on to For Your Eyes Only , Fleming said " I am busily scratching my head trying to think of a subject for you again . No one in the history of thrillers has had such a totally brilliant artistic collaborator ! " 
 = = = Reviews = = = 
 Francis Iles , writing in The Guardian , noting the short @-@ story format , " thought it better than the novels " and wrote that " the first story is full of the old wild improbabilities , but one of the others has a positively <unk> flavour . " Iles also thought that " it seems that one must either enjoy the novels of Mr. Ian Fleming beyond reason or be unable to read them at all . " Writing in The Guardian 's sister paper , The Observer , Maurice Richardson thought that " our <unk> cad @-@ clubman secret agent is mellowing a bit now " ; Richardson liked the format , saying that " the short form suits him quite well " although the downside is that " if it checks the wilder fantasies it cuts short the love @-@ affairs " . Writing in The Spectator , Cyril Ray ( under the pseudonym Christopher Pym ) wrote that " each episode of the Bond novels meant the adventure was less probable and more preposterous than the last , and now our hero seems to have lost , as well as any claims to plausibility , the know @-@ how , the know @-@ who , know @-@ what and sheer zing that used to carry the unlikely plots along . Perhaps all that mattress pounding is taking it out of poor Bond " . 
 Writing in The Listener , John Raymond was of the opinion that Bond 's " admirers ... will find him in top form " and that the stories , " all but one of which are well up to 007 's high standard " . Raymond believed that " The Commander seems to be mellowing with the years " and because of this was " less of a show @-@ off ... and , for once , his chronicler has almost cut out the sadism " . In terms of the villains in the book , most notably Milton Krest , Raymond saw that Fleming 's " capacity to create villains is undiminished " . 
 The critic for The Times reflected that " the mood of For Your Eyes Only is , in fact , a good deal more sober and , perhaps , weary than before " ; the critic also thought that the short form worked well with Bond , and that " the girls , though a short story allows them only walk @-@ on parts , are as wild and luscious as ever " . Philip Stead , writing in The Times Literary Supplement thought that " Mr. Fleming 's licensed assassin is in pretty good form . " Stead considered that in the stories " occasionally there seem to be echoes of Ashenden and glimpses of Rogue Male , but the Bond ambience is persuasive " . 
 In the US , James Sandoe , writing in the New York Herald Tribune thought that For Your Eyes Only had " urban savagery and mighty smooth tale @-@ spinning " . Writing in The New York Times , Anthony Boucher — described by a Fleming biographer , John Pearson as " throughout an avid anti @-@ Bond and an anti @-@ Fleming man " — described what his main issue with Fleming 's work was : " his basic weakness as a storyteller , which can be summed up in two words : ' no story . ' " In the short story form , however , Boucher finds that Bond 's tales " are proportionate " and that Fleming 's " prose ... is eminently smooth and readable " even if " Bond 's triumphs are too simple and lack ... intricate suspense " .

 For Your Eyes Only ( 1981 ) 
 A number of details from the story are used in the film For Your Eyes Only , released in 1981 and starring Roger Moore as James Bond . The film shows the murder of the Havelocks by a hit man , although it names the hitman as Gonzalez , rather than Gonzales . The film also changes the name of the Havelock 's daughter , Judy , to Melina . For Your Eyes Only also uses much of the plot of " Risico " , including the characters of Colombo and Kristatos . 
 A View to a Kill ( 1985 ) 
 Part of the title of the story From a View to a Kill was used for the 1985 Bond film A View to a Kill , with none of the story used in this or any other film to date .

 Milton Krest , his foundation , the Wavekrest , and " the Corrector " were incorporated into the 1989 film Licence to Kill starring Timothy Dalton as Bond . 
 Quantum of Solace ( 2008 ) 
 Quantum of Solace was chosen as the title of the 22nd Bond film ; none of the story was used for the film 's plot . Daniel Craig , who starred as Bond in the film , said the film also shares the primary thematic element of the story as " it relates to the fact that if you don 't have that Quantum of Solace in a relationship , you should give up . If you are not respecting each other , it 's over , and at the end of the last movie Bond doesn 't have that because his girlfriend has been killed . " 
 Spectre ( 2015 ) 
 In the 2015 film Spectre M and Bond meet in a London safe house , which carries a name plate labelled " Hildebrand Antiques and Rarities " , a reference to The Hildebrand Rarity .

 Becky Bain of Idolator praised the song , saying , " Kelly totally rips it wide open on the chorus with her shrieking @-@ but @-@ not @-@ shrill ' <unk> ! ' Once again , David Guetta + Kelly Rowland = musical gold . If we 're lucky , this will also be a US single , but we know how infrequently mass American [ sic ] takes a liking to Europop tunes . " Robert Copsey of Digital Spy agreed , saying that the song was " nothing less than was expected . " He awarded the song four out of five stars , saying that the song could not top " Commander " but " comes pretty close . " It " [ uses ] beats that bounce faster than a chesty lady on a high @-@ powered <unk> . It all makes for another infectious club @-@ pop number on which Kel is refreshingly direct with her fella . " Not all reviews were positive . Rick <unk> of the Daily Record was much less impressed with the song , saying it could have " been a session singer " instead of the " dance diva " Rowland is intending on becoming . A reviewer from <unk> praised the dance remix of the song . The review said , " French DJ Antoine Clamaran has turned K Row ’ s mid @-@ tempo jam into the perfect summer anthem – with killer beats , an uplifting chorus and suitably cheesy video ( below ) . "

 A review from Idolator said that the futuristic theme to the video might have been better suited to the previous international single , " Commander . " It also said , " The pop diva continues her ascent to grown woman in this sun @-@ soaked video , making good use of palm trees , a convertible , and the Los Angeles skyline , " commenting that she takes " a breezy approach so casual it almost does look like a camera crew just happened to stumble upon a typical day out with the girls . " The reviewer concluded that " it 's hard to imagine better uses for a touch screen than getting as close as possible to the carefree fun on display here . " Steven Gottlieb of Video Static said , " [ ' Forever and a Day ' is ] a casual and sunny pop video gets a bit of a twist , or a flick , via an interface that 's swiped from your iPhone ... It 's possibly not the kind of finger manipulation some Kelly Rowland fans have been dreaming about , but even they should admit it 's a clever conceit . "

 = Battle of Kalbajar = 
 The Battle of Kelbajar took place in March and April 1993 , during the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh War . It resulted in the capture by Armenian military forces of the Kelbajar region of Azerbaijan . 
 Kelbajar lay outside the contested enclave of the former Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Autonomous Oblast , but within Nagorno @-@ Karabakh geographic region of Azerbaijan , that Armenian and Azerbaijani forces had been fighting over for five years . The offensive was the first time Armenian forces from Nagorno @-@ Karabakh had advanced beyond the boundaries of the enclave . Kelbajar rayon , located between Armenia and the western border of former NKAO , was composed of several dozen villages and its provincial capital , also named Kelbajar . According to Russian sources mountain troops from the 128th Regiment ( 7th Russian Army ) stationed in Armenia participated in the seizure of Kelbajar in a blitzkrieg operation . After initial heavy resistance , the Azerbaijani defenses quickly collapsed and the provincial capital fell on April 3 , 1993 . Kelbajar is currently under the control of the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Republic . 
 = = Background = = 
 An autonomous oblast during the Soviet era under the jurisdiction of the Azerbaijan SSR , Nagorno @-@ Karabakh 's population was approximately 75 % ethnic Armenian . As the Soviet Union 's disintegration approached during the late 1980s , the enclave 's government expressed its desire to secede and unite with the neighboring Armenian SSR . By 1991 , Armenia and Azerbaijan were independent countries but the nascent Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Republic remained internationally unrecognized despite its government 's declaration of independence . Small @-@ scale violence had flared up between the two ethnic groups in February 1988 but soon escalated to use of Soviet @-@ built tanks , helicopters , and fighter bombers appropriated by both sides after the collapse of the Soviet Union . 
 On May 9 , 1992 , Armenian forces captured the mountain stronghold of Shusha but remained on the defensive until the next year . Fighting between Armenians and Azeris continued in other parts of the enclave , including Lachin , <unk> , and <unk> . However , nearly all offensives launched by Azerbaijan failed or could not hold on to captured territory . By the spring of 1993 the Azerbaijani military , which had the upper hand in the initial stages of the war , had been largely reduced to unorganized and incoherent fighting groups . By March 1993 the fighting had shifted to west and south of Karabakh . 
 Kelbajar was a raion surrounded by several canyons and an elevated mountain range known as the Murov Mountains . In the attack , Armenian forces from four directions , including Armenia proper , assaulted and captured an area of over 1 @,@ 900 square kilometers . This linked Armenia with Nagorno @-@ Karabakh and opened a second " corridor " for Armenia to send aid through . 
 = = The region of Kelbajar = = 
 = = = Rationale for its taking = = = 
 Kelbajar is located between Armenia and the western boundary of former Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Autonomous Oblast . Situated between a steep mountain range , its wartime population of approximately 45 @,@ 000 – 60 @,@ 000 was primarily made up of ethnic Azeris and Kurds . Throughout the war , the Armenians of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh had been voicing their discontent over seventy years of Azeri rule and said that they were defending themselves from Azerbaijan 's aggression . Their capture of the towns of Khojaly and Shusha stemmed from security concerns in silencing artillery bombardments positioned in those towns , albeit the capture of the former resulted in the Khojaly massacre . They stated that Karabakh had historically been an Armenian region and that their claims for territory did not extend beyond its boundaries . 
 In March 1993 , military incursions by Azeri forces and artillery barrages were reported to have been coming from the region , prompting military leaders to announce an offensive against the rayon . However , a different reason was given by the Armenians ' most successful commander of the conflict , Monte Melkonian . According to Melkonian , the commander of the southern front in Martuni ( <unk> ) , the decision to take the town was a matter of certainty rather than choice . He stated , " This is a historical issue ... of course this is historical Armenia ... And we 'll vindicate that reality [ to the Azeris ] with our guns . Unfortunately ! It would be nice if the Azeris would understand that reality is reality , agree and say OK , it 's yours , and that 's that . " Questioned on the possibility of a large expulsion of civilians if the region was captured , Melkonian responded , " A lot of blood has been spilled on both sides ... The emotions are high and that isn 't conducive to living together in near or medium future . "

 Defeats in late March already had the Azeri military evacuating civilians out of the region to the northern town of Yevlakh and Azerbaijan 's second largest city , Ganja . The Armenians had assembled a force of several hundred men to enter Kelbajar from four different directions : Melkonian 's own detachment of tanks and troops from Karabakh would attack from the southeast , one fifty @-@ man unit from the town of <unk> , Armenia would enter from the west ; the third force would attack from the village of <unk> in the north , and the primary attacking force would come from the village of <unk> . 
 The battered village of <unk> in Kelbajar had already seen extensive fighting in earlier weeks and was reinforced by both Azerbaijani and foreign fighters as the Armenian offensive commenced on March 27 . However , instead of launching a simultaneous attack , only the units in <unk> and <unk> moved out . Melkonian 's armored column did not move out until later on and his units faced tenacious resistance on an embankment of entrenched defenses where his forces were forced to retreat . The troops in <unk> began their assault shortly thereafter but their advance was slowed since they had to trek through the snowy passes of the Murov Mountains . 
 On March 28 , Melkonian 's forces counterattacked <unk> and an eight @-@ hour battle ensued until his forces were able to break through the defenses . The stretched out Azeri forces deployed through the region allowed them to advance twenty @-@ nine kilometers , reaching the Tartar River on March 31 . Within another twenty kilometers of his forces ' positions was the Kelbajar 's namesake capital , a crucial road intersection that led to Lachin and the village of <unk> . By March 29 , Armenian forces encircled the town of Kalbajar . A journalist reported seeing intensive bombardment of Kelbajar , including Grad artillery , originating from Armenia proper . 
 = = = Melkonian 's advance = = = 
 The following two days saw a massive refugee column of cars and trucks " laden with bundles ... bumper to bumper " trudging through the intersection . Melkonian ordered his forces to halt their advance until the remnants of the column dried up in the early afternoon of April 1 . Assessing that most refugees had left , he ordered his units to advance and sent a detachment to guard a vital tunnel leading south towards <unk> . While his troops had assumed that most civilians had left Kelbajar , they encountered a GAZ @-@ 52 transport truck in the tunnel and , thinking it was a military vehicle , fired and destroyed it with rocket @-@ propelled grenades and assault rifles . As they observed the wreck of the vehicle , the troops realized they had taken out a vehicle filled entirely with civilians : twenty @-@ five Kurd and Azeri kolkhoz workers . Four of them , including the driver of the truck and his daughter , were killed . The rest were ordered by Melkonian to be taken to a hospital in Karabakh 's capital of Stepanakert ; however , as many as eleven of them died . 
 After the <unk> incident , his forces pushed forward and reached another vital intersection leading to Ganja , fifteen kilometers away from the capital . Civilians in Kelbajar continued to be evacuated by both air and the through the intersection and Melkonian halted his advance by a further forty hours to allow the traffic column to move through . On April 1 , his forces issued a radio message to the governor of the region , instructing his forces to leave the capital . An ultimatum was placed until 2 pm of the following day . Identified by his radio codename , " Khan " , the governor responded and stated , " We 're never going to leave ... we 'll fight to the end . " 
 = = = Final push = = = 
 As the deadline passed on April 2 , Melkonian 's armor entered the intersection and encountered a line of Azeri tanks and infantry . A firefight ensued but lasted for only several minutes as the defense line was soon battered and destroyed . Many of the Azeri forces were ill @-@ prepared for the attack as Melkonian noted when pointing out to their lack of equipment . Despite having his force reduced down to a total of sixty @-@ eight men , a force too weak to take the capital , he ordered them to continue forward . 
 By April 3 , the Armenian forces had encircled the capital and resistance had weakened . Azeri commander Suret Huseynov and his 709th brigade , which had been tasked to defending the Murov Mountains , had retreated to Ganja after political and military problems began to unravel upon in the battlefield . An account of the war @-@ weariness afflicting the inhabitants of the town was described by Melkonian 's elder brother , Markar : 
 A downcast enemy soldier with a bandaged hand and a burned leg rides up on a donkey and surrenders . An old man in a faded jacket studded with medals from the Great Patriotic War weeps before leaving his home forever . An elderly woman in a black <unk> , waving a torn sheet on a stick , greets Monte and Abo [ his radio operator ] in Azeri Turkish , then suddenly kneels to the ground to kiss Monte 's feet . Surprised and awkward , Monte tries to pull back . Yok ! he shouts , " No ! " He reflexively bends over and brings the woman up by her arm . " What are you doing ? " he asks in Anatolian Turkish , " Don 't ever do that ! " ... [ Melkonian ] found [ in the capital ] a row of neat but bleak storefronts and a few chickens . The townsfolk ... had not bothered to grab the chickens as provisions for the road . The only other sign of life was a BMP idling in the middle of the road through the center of town . 
 Although his contingent did not reach in time for the fighting , the city 's capital was taken . Aside from some farm life , the town had been largely abandoned . The taking of the region marked a continuous swath of territory held by Armenians stretching from Karabakh to Armenia proper , a total of 3 @,@ 000 square kilometers . In the retreat through the Omar Pass of the Murov mountain range , many Azeri refugees froze to death . With the last helicopters leaving on April 1 , they were forced to walk through the heavy snow at freezing temperatures . Nearly 39 @,@ 000 civilians were processed into the camps at Yevlakh and <unk> with as many as 15 @,@ 000 unaccounted for . Four Azerbaijani MI @-@ 8 helicopters ferrying refugees and wounded out of the conflict zone crashed , the last of which was hit by Armenian forces . Human Rights Watch findings concluded that during the Kalbajar offensive Armenian forces committed numerous violations of the rules of war , including forcible exodus of civilian population , indiscriminate fire and hostage @-@ taking . 
 = = Political ramifications = = 
 The offensive provoked international criticism against both the Armenians in Karabakh and the Republic . Vafa <unk> , the chief adviser to then president of Azerbaijan , Abulfaz Elchibey alleged that the region was taken too easily because help arrived from the Russian 128th Regiment ( 7th Russian Army ) stationed in Armenia . This charge was refuted by the operation 's commander , Gurgen <unk> , and others since " Moscow [ i.e. , the Russian government ] was not in total control of Armenian military operations . " Armenia 's western neighbor , Turkey halted humanitarian aid coming through its borders . The United States also condemned the offensive , issuing a " sharp rebuke " and sending an accompanying letter to the Armenian government . 
 On April 30 , 1993 , Turkey and Pakistan co @-@ sponsored United Nations Security Council Resolution 822 which called for Armenians in the region to withdraw immediately from Kelbajar and other areas of Azerbaijan . Turkey 's President Turgut Özal called for military intervention on Azerbaijan 's side and set forth on a tour of Turkic former Soviet republics on April 14 . ( Özal would die of a heart attack just three days later ) . Iran also condemned the offensive since many refugees in Azerbaijan were fleeing south towards its borders . In an attempt to end the hostilities , U.S. , Russia and Turkey reiterated the call for withdrawal of Armenian troops from Kelbajar region of Azerbaijan on May 6 , which would be followed by formal peace talks . 
 = Marion L. Brittain = 
 Marion Luther Brittain , Sr. ( November 11 , 1866 – July 13 , 1953 ) was an American academic administrator and president of the Georgia Institute of Technology from 1922 to 1944 . Brittain was born in Georgia and , aside from a brief stint at the University of Chicago for graduate school , spent most of his life serving the educational community there . After receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from Emory College in 1886 , Brittain worked his way up the ranks from principal of an Atlanta high school to superintendent of education for the entire state of Georgia . 
 In 1922 , Brittain accepted the position of president of the Georgia Institute of Technology , then called the Georgia School of Technology , an office he would hold until his retirement in 1944 . During his 22 @-@ year tenure at Georgia Tech , Brittain was credited with doubling student enrollment , establishing what is now the second largest aerospace engineering faculty in the United States , and playing an influential role in securing Georgia Tech 's position as a leading technical institute and research university . After his retirement , Brittain wrote The Story of Georgia Tech ( 1948 ) , a history of the Institute published shortly before his death in 1953 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Marion L. Brittain was born in Wilkes County , Georgia in 1866 to Dr. J. M. Brittain , a Baptist minister , and Ida Callaway , granddaughter of Baptist minister Enoch Callaway . Brittain 's childhood was spent in a variety of towns and cities throughout the state of Georgia due to his father 's career as a minister . He attended Emory College for his undergraduate studies , graduating in 1886 with the commendation that he was the " best student in his department the college had had in ten years . " Brittain then spent ten years as an administrator of several high schools in the Atlanta , Georgia area . In 1897 , he gained local fame for his erudition after winning a contest held by the Atlanta Constitution in which he was able to identify the missing word from a passage taken from an obscure book on English literature . Brittain left his work as a high school administrator in 1898 to pursue graduate studies at the University of Chicago . 
 On December 5 , 1899 , Brittain and Lettie McDonald , daughter of Baptist minister Dr. Henry McDonald , were married . He returned to academic administration , first as superintendent of the Fulton County School System ( 1900 – 1910 ) and later , at the appointment of Joseph Mackey Brown , the education system for the entire state of Georgia ( 1910 – 1922 ) . In this role , Brittain became well known for fighting corruption and generally improving the education system . Throughout this time , Brittain earned LL.D. degrees from Mercer University ( 1919 ) , and , later , the University of Georgia ( 1927 ) and Emory University ( 1928 ) . He was also president of the Georgia Education Association in 1906 , of the Southern Education Association in 1913 , and of the Council of State School Superintendents of the United States in 1917 . He earned the wrath of Senator Tom Watson during these positions , who attempted to remove Brittain from his position as superintendent of education . 
 = = President of Georgia Tech = = 
 On August 1 , 1922 , Brittain was elected president of the Georgia School of Technology ( Georgia Tech ) . During his tenure , Brittain was able to convince the state of Georgia to increase funding for the Institute . He had noted in the 1923 annual report that " there are more students in Georgia Tech than in any other two colleges in Georgia , and we have the smallest appropriation of them all . " Additionally , a $ 300 @,@ 000 grant ( equivalent to $ 4 @,@ 249 @,@ 601 @.@ 59 in 2015 ) from the Guggenheim Foundation allowed Brittain to establish the David Guggenheim School of Aeronautics at Georgia Tech . In 1930 , Brittain 's decision to use the money for a School of Aeronautics was controversial ; today , the David Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering boasts the second largest faculty in the United States behind MIT . 
 Other accomplishments during Brittain 's administration included a doubling of Georgia Tech 's enrollment , the first ROTC unit in the Southern United States , accreditation for the Institute by the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools , and the creation of a new ceramic engineering department , building , and major that attracted the American Ceramics Society 's national convention to Atlanta . Perhaps most significantly , Brittain is attributed with providing the vision and securing the finances to move Georgia Tech away from its roots as a teaching @-@ oriented trade school and towards a new focus on science and technology research . 
 Brittain was known by reputation as a kind , gentle man and was well liked by students and faculty . He was especially remembered for his dedication to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team , attending nearly every game including those taking place out @-@ of @-@ state . Outside of Georgia Tech , Brittain taught Sunday school classes and maintained active membership in a number of service organizations . Brittain retired from his position as president of Georgia Tech in 1944 , after which he penned a history of the Institute entitled The Story of Georgia Tech , completed in 1948 . He died in 1953 , survived by three children : McDonald , Marion Luther , Jr . , and Ida , three grandsons , and a great @-@ granddaughter . Flags at the university were flown at half @-@ staff for a month in remembrance of Brittain , and classes were cancelled for the rest of the school week . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Long after his death , Brittain continues to be remembered through several prestigious awards named in his honor . The Marion L. Brittain Fellows Program , established in 1990 , awards postdoctoral fellowships to teach in the Communications Program at Georgia Tech 's School of Literature , Communication , and Culture for up to three years . At Emory University , the Marion Luther Brittain Award is presented annually at commencement to a graduate " who has demonstrated exemplary service to both the university and the greater community without expectation of recognition " and is considered the university 's highest student honor . 
 A pair of buildings bears the name of Brittain as well . The Dr. Marion Luther Brittain , Sr. , House , built in the Neoclassical Revival style and located at 1109 West Peachtree Street in Atlanta , was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 23 , 1993 . The building served as Brittain 's home from its construction in 1911 until Brittain and his family moved to the Georgia Tech president 's house in 1922 . It has since been converted into office space and is privately owned . Additionally , the Marion L. Brittain Dining Hall , erected in 1928 , is one of two dining facilities for students living in residence halls on the east side of Georgia Tech 's campus . 
 = Albertosaurus = 
 Albertosaurus ( / <unk> / ; meaning " Alberta lizard " ) is a genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived in western North America during the Late Cretaceous Period , about 70 million years ago . The type species , A. sarcophagus , was apparently restricted in range to the modern @-@ day Canadian province of Alberta , after which the genus is named . Scientists disagree on the content of the genus , with some recognizing Gorgosaurus libratus as a second species . 
 As a tyrannosaurid , Albertosaurus was a bipedal predator with tiny , two @-@ fingered hands and a massive head that had dozens of large , sharp teeth . It may have been at the top of the food chain in its local ecosystem . Although relatively large for a theropod , Albertosaurus was much smaller than its more famous relative Tyrannosaurus , probably weighing less than 2 metric tons . 
 Since the first discovery in 1884 , fossils of more than 30 individuals have been recovered , providing scientists with a more detailed knowledge of Albertosaurus anatomy than is available for most other tyrannosaurids . The discovery of 26 individuals at one site provides evidence of pack behaviour and allows studies of ontogeny and population biology , which are impossible with lesser @-@ known dinosaurs . 
 = = Description = = 
 Albertosaurus was smaller than some other tyrannosaurids , such as Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus . Typical Albertosaurus adults measured up to 9 metres ( 30 feet ) long , while rare individuals of great age could grow to be over 10 metres ( 33 feet ) long . Several independent mass estimates , obtained by different methods , suggest that an adult Albertosaurus weighed between 1 @.@ 3 tonnes ( 1 @.@ 4 short tons ) and 1 @.@ 7 tonnes ( 1 @.@ 9 tons ) . 
 Albertosaurus shared a similar body appearance with all other tyrannosaurids . Typically for a theropod , Albertosaurus was bipedal and balanced the heavy head and torso with a long tail . However , tyrannosaurid forelimbs were extremely small for their body size and retained only two digits . The hind limbs were long and ended in a four @-@ toed foot on which the first digit , called the hallux , was short and did not reach the ground . The third digit was longer than the rest . Albertosaurus may have been able to reach walking speeds of 14 − 21 kilometres per hour ( 8 − 13 miles per hour ) . At least for the younger individuals , a high running speed is plausible . 
 = = = Skull and teeth = = = 
 The massive skull of Albertosaurus , which was perched on a short , S @-@ shaped neck , was approximately 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 feet ) long in the largest adults . Wide openings in the skull ( fenestrae ) reduced the weight of the head while also providing space for muscle attachment and sensory organs . Its long jaws contained , both sides combined , 58 or more banana @-@ shaped teeth ; larger tyrannosaurids possessed fewer teeth , Gorgosaurus at least sixty @-@ two . Unlike most theropods , Albertosaurus and other tyrannosaurids were heterodont , with teeth of different forms depending on their position in the mouth . The premaxillary teeth at the tip of the upper jaw , four per side , were much smaller than the rest , more closely packed , and D @-@ shaped in cross section . Like with Tyrannosaurus , the maxillary ( cheek ) teeth of Albertosaurus were adapted in general form to resist lateral forces exerted by a struggling prey . The bite force of Albertosaurus was less formidable , however , with the maximum force , by the hind teeth , reaching 3 @,@ 413 Newtons . Above the eyes were short bony crests that may have been brightly coloured in life and used in courtship to attract a mate . 
 William Abler observed in 2001 that Albertosaurus tooth serrations resemble a crack in the tooth ending in a round void called an ampulla . Tyrannosaurid teeth were used as holdfasts for pulling meat off a body , so when a tyrannosaur pulled back on a piece of meat , the tension could cause a purely crack @-@ like serration to spread through the tooth . However , the presence of the ampulla distributed these forces over a larger surface area , and lessened the risk of damage to the tooth under strain . The presence of incisions ending in voids has parallels in human engineering . Guitar makers use incisions ending in voids to , as Abler describes , " impart alternating regions of flexibility and rigidity " to the wood they work with . The use of a drill to create an " ampulla " of sorts and prevent the propagation of cracks through material is also used to protect aircraft surfaces . Abler demonstrated that a plexiglass bar with incisions called " <unk> " and drilled holes was more than 25 % stronger than one with only regularly placed incisions . Unlike tyrannosaurs , ancient predators like phytosaurs and Dimetrodon had no adaptations to prevent the crack @-@ like serrations of their teeth from spreading when subjected to the forces of feeding . 
 = = Classification and systematics = = 
 Albertosaurus is a member of the theropod family Tyrannosauridae , in the subfamily Albertosaurinae . Its closest relative is the slightly older Gorgosaurus libratus ( sometimes called Albertosaurus libratus ; see below ) . These two species are the only described albertosaurines ; other undescribed species may exist . Thomas Holtz found Appalachiosaurus to be an albertosaurine in 2004 , but his more recent unpublished work locates it just outside Tyrannosauridae , in agreement with other authors . 
 The other major subfamily of tyrannosaurids is the Tyrannosaurinae , which includes Daspletosaurus , Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus . Compared with these robust tyrannosaurines , albertosaurines had slender builds , with proportionately smaller skulls and longer bones of the lower leg ( tibia ) and feet ( metatarsals and phalanges ) . 
 Below is the cladogram of Tyrannosauridae based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Loewen et al. in 2013 . 
 = = Discovery and naming = = 
 = = = Naming = = = 
 Albertosaurus was named by Henry Fairfield Osborn in a one @-@ page note at the end of his 1905 description of Tyrannosaurus rex . The name honours Alberta , the Canadian province established the same year , in which the first remains were found . The generic name also incorporates the Greek term σαυρος / sauros ( " lizard " ) , the most common suffix in dinosaur names . The type species is Albertosaurus sarcophagus ; the specific name is derived from Ancient Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) meaning " flesh @-@ eating " and having the same etymology as the funeral container with which it shares its name : a combination of the Greek words <unk> / sarx ( " flesh " ) and <unk> / phagein ( " to eat " ) . More than 30 specimens of all ages are known to science . 
 = = = Early discoveries = = = 
 The type specimen is a partial skull , collected in the summer of 1884 from an outcrop of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation alongside the Red Deer River , in Alberta . This specimen , found on June 9 , 1884 , was recovered by an expedition of the Geological Survey of Canada , led by the famous geologist Joseph Burr Tyrrell . Due to a lack of specialised equipment the almost complete skull could only be partially secured . In 1889 , Tyrrell 's colleague Thomas <unk> Weston found an incomplete smaller skull associated with some skeletal material at a location nearby . The two skulls were assigned to the preexisting species Laelaps incrassatus by Edward Drinker Cope in 1892 , although the name Laelaps was preoccupied by a genus of mite and had been changed to Dryptosaurus in 1877 by Othniel Charles Marsh . Cope refused to recognize the new name created by his archrival Marsh . However , Lawrence Lambe used the name Dryptosaurus incrassatus instead of Laelaps incrassatus when he described the remains in detail in 1903 and 1904 , a combination first coined by Oliver Perry Hay in 1902 . Shortly later , Osborn pointed out that D. incrassatus was based on generic tyrannosaurid teeth , so the two Horseshoe Canyon skulls could not be confidently referred to that species . The Horseshoe Canyon skulls also differed markedly from the remains of D. aquilunguis , type species of Dryptosaurus , so Osborn created the new name Albertosaurus sarcophagus for them in 1905 . He did not describe the remains in any great detail , citing Lambe 's complete description the year before . Both specimens ( the holotype CMN 5600 and the paratype CMN 5601 ) are stored in the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa . By the early twenty @-@ first century , some concerns had arisen that , due to the damaged state of the holotype , Albertosaurus might be a nomen dubium , a " dubious name " that could only be used for the type specimen itself because other fossils could not reliably be assigned to it . However , in 2010 , Thomas Carr established that the holotype , the paratype and comparable later finds all shared a single common unique trait or autapomorphy : the possession of an enlarged pneumatic opening in the back rim of the side of the palatine bone , proving that Albertosaurus was a valid taxon . 
 = = = Dry Island bonebed = = = 
 On 11 August 1910 , American paleontologist Barnum Brown discovered the remains of a large group of Albertosaurus at another quarry alongside the Red Deer River . Because of the large number of bones and the limited time available , Brown 's party did not collect every specimen , but made sure to collect remains from all of the individuals that they could identify in the bonebed . Among the bones deposited in the American Museum of Natural History collections in New York City are seven sets of right metatarsals , along with two isolated toe bones that did not match any of the metatarsals in size . This indicated the presence of at least nine individuals in the quarry . The Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology rediscovered the bonebed in 1997 and resumed fieldwork at the site , which is now located inside Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park . Further excavation from 1997 to 2005 turned up the remains of 13 more individuals of various ages , including a diminutive two @-@ year @-@ old and a very old individual estimated at over 10 metres ( 33 feet ) in length . None of these individuals are known from complete skeletons , and most are represented by remains in both museums . Excavations continued until 2008 , when the minimum number of individuals present had been established at 12 , on the basis of preserved elements that occur only once in a skeleton , and at 26 if mirrored elements were counted when differing in size due to ontogeny . A total of 1 @,@ 128 Albertosaurus bones had been secured , the largest concentration of large theropod fossils known from the Cretaceous . 
 = = = Gorgosaurus libratus = = = 
 In 1913 , paleontologist Charles H. Sternberg recovered another tyrannosaurid skeleton from the slightly older Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta . Lawrence Lambe named this dinosaur Gorgosaurus libratus in 1914 . Other specimens were later found in Alberta and the US state of Montana . Finding , largely due to a lack of good Albertosaurus skull material , no significant differences to separate the two taxa , Dale Russell declared the name Gorgosaurus a junior synonym of Albertosaurus , which had been named first , and G. libratus was renamed Albertosaurus libratus in 1970 . A species distinction was maintained because of the age difference . This addition extended the temporal range of the genus Albertosaurus backwards by several million years and its geographic range southwards by hundreds of kilometres . 
 In 2003 , Philip J. Currie , benefiting from much more extensive finds and a general increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods , compared several tyrannosaurid skulls and came to the conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought . The decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary , as the two species are sister taxa , more closely related to each other than to any other species . Recognizing this , Currie nevertheless recommended that Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus be retained as separate genera , as he concluded that they were no more similar than Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus , which are almost always separated . In addition , several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from Alaska and New Mexico , and Currie suggested that the Albertosaurus @-@ Gorgosaurus situation may be clarified once these are described fully . Most authors have followed Currie 's recommendation , but some have not . 
 = = = Other discoveries = = = 
 In 1911 , Barnum Brown , during the second year of American Museum of Natural History operations in Alberta , uncovered a fragmentary partial Albertosaurus skull at the Red Deer River near Tolman Bridge , specimen AMNH <unk> . 
 William Parks described a new species in 1928 , Albertosaurus arctunguis , based on a partial skeleton lacking the skull excavated by Gus Lindblad and Ralph Hornell near the Red Deer River in 1923 , but this species has been considered identical to A. sarcophagus since 1970 . Parks ' specimen ( ROM 807 ) is housed in the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto . 
 Between 1926 and 1972 , no Albertosaurus fossils were found at all ; but , since the seventies , there has been a steady increase in the known material . Apart from the Dry Island bonebed , six more skulls and skeletons have since been discovered in Alberta and are housed in various Canadian museums : specimens RTMP 81 @.@ 010 @.@ 001 , found in 1978 by amateur paleontologist Maurice <unk> ; RTMP 85 @.@ 098 @.@ 001 , found by <unk> on 16 June 1985 ; RTMP 86 @.@ 64 @.@ 001 ( December 1985 ) ; RTMP 86 @.@ 205 @.@ 001 ( 1986 ) ; RTMP 97 @.@ 058 @.@ 0001 ( 1996 ) ; and CMN <unk> . However , due to vandalism and accidents , no undamaged and complete skulls could be secured among these finds . Fossils have also been reported from the American states of Montana , New Mexico , and Wyoming , but these probably do not represent A. sarcophagus and may not even belong to the genus Albertosaurus . 
 = = = Other species = = = 
 Apart from A. sarcophagus , A. arctunguis and A. libratus , several other species of Albertosaurus have been named . All of these are today seen as younger synonyms of other species or as nomina dubia , and are not assigned to Albertosaurus . 
 In 1930 , Anatoly Nikolaevich Riabinin named Albertosaurus <unk> based on a tooth from China , that probably belonged to Tarbosaurus . In 1932 , Friedrich von Huene renamed Dryptosaurus incrassatus , not considered a nomen dubium by him , to Albertosaurus incrassatus . Because he had identified Gorgosaurus with Albertosaurus , in 1970 , Russell also renamed Gorgosaurus sternbergi ( Matthew & Brown 1922 ) into Albertosaurus sternbergi and Gorgosaurus lancensis ( Gilmore 1946 ) into Albertosaurus lancensis . The former species is today seen as a juvenile form of Gorgosaurus libratus , the latter as either identical to Tyrannosaurus or representing a separate genus Nanotyrannus . In 1988 , Gregory S. Paul based Albertosaurus megagracilis on a small tyrannosaurid skeleton , specimen LACM <unk> , from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana . It was renamed <unk> in 1995 , but is now thought to represent a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex . Also in 1988 , Paul renamed Alectrosaurus <unk> ( Gilmore 1933 ) into Albertosaurus <unk> ; this has found no general acceptance . In 1989 , Gorgosaurus novojilovi ( Maleev 1955 ) was renamed by Bryn Mader and Robert Bradley as Albertosaurus novojilovi ; today this is seen as a synonym of Tarbosaurus . 
 On two occasions , species based on valid Albertosaurus material were reassigned to a different genus : in 1922 William Diller Matthew renamed A. sarcophagus into Deinodon sarcophagus and in 1939 German paleontologist Oskar Kuhn renamed A. arctunguis into Deinodon arctunguis .

 = = = Growth pattern = = = 
 Most age categories of Albertosaurus are represented in the fossil record . Using bone histology , the age of an individual animal at the time of death can often be determined , allowing growth rates to be estimated and compared with other species . The youngest known Albertosaurus is a two @-@ year @-@ old discovered in the Dry Island bonebed , which would have weighed about 50 kilograms ( 110 lb ) and measured slightly more than 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 feet ) in length . The 10 metres ( 33 feet ) specimen from the same quarry is the oldest and largest known , at 28 years of age . When specimens of intermediate age and size are plotted on a graph , an S @-@ shaped growth curve results , with the most rapid growth occurring in a four @-@ year period ending around the sixteenth year of life , a pattern also seen in other tyrannosaurids . The growth rate during this phase was 122 kilograms ( 269 pounds ) per year , based on an adult 1 @.@ 3 tonnes ( 1 @.@ 4 short tons ) . Other studies have suggested higher adult weights ; this would affect the magnitude of the growth rate , but not the overall pattern . Tyrannosaurids similar in size to Albertosaurus had similar growth rates , although the much larger Tyrannosaurus rex grew at almost five times this rate ( 601 kilograms [ 1 @,@ 325 pounds ] per year ) at its peak . The end of the rapid growth phase suggests the onset of sexual maturity in Albertosaurus , although growth continued at a slower rate throughout the animals ' lives . Sexual maturation while still actively growing appears to be a shared trait among small and large dinosaurs as well as in large mammals such as humans and elephants . This pattern of relatively early sexual maturation differs strikingly from the pattern in birds , which delay their sexual maturity until after they have finished growing . 
 During growth , through thickening the tooth morphology changed so much that , had the association of young and adult skeletons on the Dry Island bonebed not proven they belonged to the same taxon , the teeth of juveniles would likely have been identified by statistical analysis as those of a different species . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 Most known Albertosaurus individuals were aged 14 years or more at the time of death . Juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons , mainly preservation bias , where the smaller bones of younger animals were less likely to be preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults , and collection bias , where smaller fossils are less likely to be noticed by collectors in the field . Young Albertosaurus are relatively large for juvenile animals , but their remains are still rare in the fossil record compared with adults . It has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of life history , rather than bias , and that fossils of juvenile Albertosaurus are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did . 
 A hypothesis of Albertosaurus life history postulates that hatchlings died in large numbers , but have not been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction . After just two years , juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult Albertosaurus , and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals . This resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains . Mortality rates doubled at age twelve , perhaps the result of the physiological demands of the rapid growth phase , and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen . This elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood , perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation , including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources , and eventually , the ever @-@ increasing effects of senescence . The higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation . Very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes . High infant mortality rates , followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity , with very few animals reaching maximum size , is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals , including elephants , African buffalo , and rhinoceros . The same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids . The comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis , but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role , especially since more than two @-@ thirds of all Albertosaurus specimens are known from one locality . 
 = = = Pack behaviour = = = 
 The Dry Island bonebed discovered by Barnum Brown and his crew contains the remains of 26 Albertosaurus , the most individuals found in one locality of any large Cretaceous theropod , and the second @-@ most of any large theropod dinosaur behind the Allosaurus assemblage at the Cleveland Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry in Utah . The group seems to be composed of one very old adult ; eight adults between 17 and 23 years old ; seven sub @-@ adults undergoing their rapid growth phases at between 12 and 16 years old ; and six juveniles between the ages of 2 and 11 years , who had not yet reached the growth phase . 
 The near @-@ absence of herbivore remains and the similar state of preservation common to the many individuals at the Albertosaurus bonebed quarry led Currie to conclude that the locality was not a predator trap like the La Brea Tar Pits in California , and that all of the preserved animals died at the same time . Currie claims this as evidence of pack behaviour . Other scientists are skeptical , observing that the animals may have been driven together by drought , flood or for other reasons . 
 There is plentiful evidence for gregarious behaviour among herbivorous dinosaurs , including ceratopsians and hadrosaurs . However , only rarely are so many dinosaurian predators found at the same site . Small theropods like Deinonychus and Coelophysis have been found in aggregations , as have larger predators like Allosaurus and <unk> . There is some evidence of gregarious behaviour in other tyrannosaurids as well . Fragmentary remains of smaller individuals were found alongside " Sue " , the Tyrannosaurus mounted in the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago , and a bonebed in the Two Medicine Formation of Montana contains at least three specimens of Daspletosaurus , preserved alongside several hadrosaurs . These findings may corroborate the evidence for social behaviour in Albertosaurus , although some or all of the above localities may represent temporary or unnatural aggregations . Others have speculated that instead of social groups , at least some of these finds represent Komodo dragon @-@ like mobbing of carcasses , where aggressive competition leads to some of the predators being killed and cannibalized . 
 Currie also offers speculation on the pack @-@ hunting habits of Albertosaurus . The leg proportions of the smaller individuals were comparable to those of ornithomimids , which were probably among the fastest dinosaurs . Younger Albertosaurus were probably equally fleet @-@ footed , or at least faster than their prey . Currie hypothesized that the younger members of the pack may have been responsible for driving their prey towards the adults , who were larger and more powerful , but also slower . Juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults , filling predator niches between the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods , the largest of which were two orders of magnitude smaller than adult Albertosaurus in mass . A similar situation is observed in modern Komodo dragons , with hatchlings beginning life as small insectivores before growing to become the dominant predators on their islands . However , as the preservation of behaviour in the fossil record is exceedingly rare , these ideas cannot readily be tested . In 2010 , Currie , though still favouring the hunting pack hypothesis , admitted that the concentration could have been brought about by other causes , such as a slowly rising water level during an extended flood .

 In 2009 , researchers hypothesized that smooth @-@ edged holes found in the fossil jaws of tyrannosaurid dinosaurs such as Albertosaurus were caused by a parasite similar to Trichomonas gallinae , which infects birds . They suggested that tyrannosaurids transmitted the infection by biting each other , and that the infection impaired their ability to eat food . 
 In 2001 , Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior . They found that only one of the 319 Albertosaurus foot bones checked for stress fractures actually had them and none of the four hand bones did . The scientists found that stress fractures were " significantly " less common in Albertosaurus than in the carnosaur Allosaurus . ROM 807 , the holotype of A. arctunguis ( now referred to A. sarcophagus ) , had a 2 @.@ 5 by 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 98 by 1 @.@ 38 in ) deep hole in the iliac blade , although the describer of the species did not recognize this as pathological . The specimen also contains some exostosis on the fourth left metatarsal . In 1970 , two of the five Albertosaurus sarcophagus specimens with humeri were reported by Dale Russel as having pathological damage to them . 
 In 2010 , the health of the Dry Island Albertosaurus assembly was reported upon . Most specimens showed no sign of disease . On three phalanges of the foot strange bony spurs , consisting of abnormal <unk> of the tendons , so @-@ called <unk> , were present , their cause unknown . Two ribs and a belly @-@ rib showed signs of breaking and healing . One adult specimen had a left lower jaw showing a puncture wound and both healed and unhealed bite marks . The low number of abnormalities compares favourably with the health condition of a Majungasaurus population of which it in 2007 was established that 19 % of individuals showed bone pathologies . 
 = = Paleoecology = = 
 All identifiable fossils of Albertosaurus sarcophagus are known from the upper Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Alberta . These younger units of this geologic formation date to the early Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period , 70 to 68 Ma ( million years ago ) . Immediately below this formation is the Bearpaw Shale , a marine formation representing a section of the Western Interior Seaway . The seaway was receding as the climate cooled and sea levels subsided towards the end of the Cretaceous , exposing land that had previously been underwater . It was not a smooth process , however , and the seaway would periodically rise to cover parts of the region throughout Horseshoe Canyon before finally receding altogether in the years after . Due to the changing sea levels , many different environments are represented in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation , including offshore and near @-@ shore marine habitats and coastal habitats like lagoons , estuaries and tidal flats . Numerous coal seams represent ancient peat swamps . Like most of the other vertebrate fossils from the formation , Albertosaurus remains are found in deposits laid down in the deltas and floodplains of large rivers during the later half of Horseshoe Canyon times . 
 The fauna of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation is well @-@ known , as vertebrate fossils , including those of dinosaurs , are quite common . Sharks , rays , sturgeons , bowfins , gars and the gar @-@ like <unk> made up the fish fauna . Mammals included multituberculates and the marsupial <unk> . The saltwater plesiosaur <unk> has been found in marine sediments in the Horseshoe Canyon , while freshwater environments were populated by turtles , Champsosaurus , and crocodilians like Leidyosuchus and <unk> . Dinosaurs dominate the fauna , especially hadrosaurs , which make up half of all dinosaurs known , including the genera Edmontosaurus , Saurolophus and Hypacrosaurus . Ceratopsians and ornithomimids were also very common , together making up another third of the known fauna . Along with much rarer ankylosaurians and pachycephalosaurs , all of these animals would have been prey for a diverse array of carnivorous theropods , including troodontids , dromaeosaurids , and caenagnathids . <unk> with the Albertosaurus remains of the Dry Island bonebed , the bones of the small theropod <unk> were found . Adult Albertosaurus were the apex predators in this environment , with intermediate niches possibly filled by juvenile <unk> . 
 = Donald Cousens Parkway = 
 Donald Cousens Parkway or York Regional Road 48 , also referred to historically as the Markham Bypass or Markham Bypass Extension , is a regionally maintained arterial bypass of Markham in the Canadian province of Ontario . Named for former Markham mayor Don Cousens in April 2007 , the route initially travelled northward from Copper Creek Drive in Box Grove , south of Highway 407 , to Major Mackenzie Drive ( York Regional Road 25 ) . A southern extension to Steeles Avenue was later completed and the name Donald Cousens Parkway applied along the extension to Ninth Line . In addition to its role of funneling through @-@ traffic around downtown Markham , the route serves as a boundary to residential development as land to the north and east are part of the protected Rouge Park and southwest limits of the planned Pickering Airport . 
 Construction of the route began in 2002 north of 16th Avenue . In 2004 , an interchange with Highway 407 was constructed along with a connection north to Highway 7 . Both segments and the interchange were opened by December of that year . The following year , construction began to connect these two segments as well as on the Box Grove Bypass along Ninth Line ; the former opened in October 2006 and the latter in the spring of 2007 . Construction of the most recently opened segment , connecting the Box Grove Bypass to the interchange with Highway 407 , began in 2009 . It opened after several delays in 2012 and included a realignment of 14th Avenue . 
 Donald Cousens Parkway and a planned connection with Morningside Avenue form the East Metro Transportation Corridor , originally envisioned by the province in the 1970s as a six lane municipal expressway . During the mid @-@ 1990s , the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario ( MTO ) conducted studies and identified the need for the corridor by 2011 . Although York had intended for a continuous alignment , the City of Toronto has opposed the direct connection between Morningside and Donald Cousens Parkway . As a result , it is now proposed to connect Morningside Avenue and Donald Cousens Parkway via a widened Steeles Avenue . However , no timeline has been announced as of 2015 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Donald Cousens Parkway is intended to relieve north @-@ south traffic congestion on York Regional Road 68 ( Main Street , former Highway 48 ) and York Regional Road 69 ( Ninth Line ) , with signage suggesting drivers use the parkway as a through route past Markham . As trucks are prohibited along Main Street , signage guides them onto the parkway . 
 The road begins north of Steeles Avenue East , which serves as the boundary between Markham and Toronto . A two @-@ laned Ninth Line curves northeast after crossing and being crossed by two separate railway tracks ( the Canadian Pacific ( CP ) Havelock Subdivision and the Canadian National Halton subdivision ) and becomes Donald Cousens Parkway , expanding to four lanes and travelling along the eastern fringe of the community of Box Grove , alongside which it was built in the mid @-@ 2000s . On the west side is a new residential subdivision , while on the east side beyond the CP Havelock subdivision , which the road parallels , is the completely undeveloped Bob Hunter Memorial Park . After passing Box Grove Bypass , where for some time the route ended , the road also becomes known as Box Grove Collector Road ( <unk> ) . The route intersects 14th Avenue ( York Regional Road 71 ) and continues as before , eventually curving north and meeting Copper Creek Drive while departing from the railway tracks and park . It passes a <unk> before an interchange with Highway 407 , where it crosses over the toll route . 
 No longer known by the <unk> name , the route meanders north , slowly edging east towards <unk> Road and now surrounded by undeveloped greenspace . It encounters Highway 7 , north of which it becomes a divided roadway travelling on the eastern edge of Cornell as well as parallel to and alongside <unk> Road . Approaching and intersecting 16th Avenue , the road makes a broad sweeping curve northwest , continuing to serve as the boundary of urban development in Markham . It narrows to a two lane road , with adjacent land along the northern side prepared for future northbound lanes , before encountering Ninth Line again . Quickly curving north then east , sandwiched between the neighbourhood of <unk> and Little Rouge Creek , the route makes a final curve north to end at Major Mackenzie Drive on the northern edge of urban development in eastern Markham . 
 A future extension , scheduled to begin construction in April 2018 , will carry Donald Cousens Parkway north , crossing over the Stouffville GO Train line on a new bridge and merging into the current southern terminus of Highway 48 . As a result of this , Highway 48 and Donald Cousens Parkway ( York Regional Road 48 ) will become the through route while Main Street will meet them at an intersection demarcating the two . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Planning = = = 
 The history of Donald Cousens Parkway dates back to the 1970s , when Metropolitan Toronto and the Department of Highways ( now the MTO ) planned out the East Metro Transportation Corridor . This corridor was originally envisioned as a six lane expressway connecting Highway 401 with the planned but unbuilt Highway 407 to service the future towns of Cornell and Seaton using the greenspace between the two . However , the drive for expressway construction faded through the 1970s and 1980s as a result of opposition and the resulting cancellation of the Toronto expressway network . Studies nonetheless continued to be performed confirming the need for the route . The formation of Rouge Park in 1990 resulted in a commitment for " no new roads " through the park south of Steeles Avenue , ending the potential for any expressway proposals to be approved . 
 During 1994 and 1995 , the MTO conducted two studies termed the Morningside Transportation Corridor Review . While the study once again confirmed the need for the route , it also suggested that while an expressway was the ideal solution , an arterial road would be the practical solution . It also suggested that the road be a municipal route , rather than a provincial one . In 1997 , the Environmental Assessment for the Markham Bypass extension was completed , approving construction of an interchange at the future Highway 407 ( then open only as far as Highway 404 ) and a divided roadway north from there to Major Mackenzie Drive . 
 = = = Construction = = = 
 Construction on the two lane section between 16th Avenue and Major Mackenzie Drive , connecting with the north end of the Old Markham Bypass , began in 2002 , and was completed by the end of 2004 . Phase 2 , which included construction of a partial interchange with Highway 407 , began in 2004 and was completed by the end of the year ; it and the four lane section north of it to Highway 7 opened on December 17 , 2004 . In 2005 , construction began on the third phase of the bypass , connecting the southern segment at Highway 7 with the northern segment north of 16th Avenue . This four lane section opened on October 24 , 2006 . The two lane road between this new section and 16th Avenue was subsequently closed and removed . Phase 1 cost an estimated $ 19 @.@ 3 million ; phase 2 an estimated $ 5 @.@ 5 million ; phase 3 an estimated $ 10 @.@ 8 million . 
 On October 19 , 2006 , York Regional Council voted to rename the Markham Bypass to honour the work of mayor Don Cousens . Following this decision , a report was prepared outlining the costs ; it was presented to council on February 22 , 2007 , and a bylaw enacted . The name change became effective April 1 , 2007 . 
 South of Highway 407 , planning for the controversial link to Morningside Avenue has been underway since 2002 . Although York had intended for Donald Cousens Parkway to tie directly into Morningside , thus completing and arterial link the Highway 401 , Toronto has firmly opposed this direct link since 2005 due to the requirement for a new crossing of the Rouge River . After a lengthy and contentious debate between the two , the province brought in former York Region CAO Alan Wells as a mediator in 2007 . In September 2010 , York announced that it had reached a compromise to construct a discontinuous route , with Donald Cousens Parkway ending at the current Steeles Avenue / Ninth Line intersection , widening the two @-@ laned Steeles to six west of that point , and extending Morningside north to Steeles immediately east of <unk> Drive . The Regional Municipality of York applied for and obtained environmental assessment approval for this undertaking in July 2011 and January 2013 , respectively . In July 2014 it was announced that Toronto and York would begin sharing jurisdiction over 1 @.@ 5 km ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) of Steeles west from Ninth Line in order to move forward on the planned widening project . 
 In the interim period since the debate erupted in 2005 , York Region and the Town of Markham began collaboration on linking Donald Cousens Parkway between Steeles and Highway 407 . Markham oversaw construction of the Box Grove Bypass ( or Ninth Line Bypass ) and Town Arterial Road , ( or Box Grove Collector Road ) , with construction carried out by it and the developers of the adjacent Box Grove community . The Box Grove Bypass was constructed by the town beginning in 2005 and opened in the spring of 2007 , partially utilizing the Donald Cousens Parkway alignment along the north side of the CP Havelock railway subdivision . Construction of the Box Grove Collector Road , between the Box Grove Bypass and Highway 407 , began in 2009 and included a realignment of 14th Avenue . The developers of the surrounding communities – Box Grove Hill Developments Inc. to the north of 14th Avenue and Box Grove Developers Group to the south – were contracted to build this section , which was scheduled for completion by December 2010 . Although a short portion between Copper Creek Drive and Highway 407 — including the unfinished ramps at the interchange — was opened by 2011 , the remainder of the project was delayed by issues involving a new railway crossing along 14th Avenue . It opened in 2012 at an estimated cost of $ 15 @.@ 5 million . 
 = = Future = = 
 The original intention of the Markham Bypass was to link Highway 48 with Highway 401 via the Morningside Avenue extension through Toronto . York Region planned for a continuous connection between the bypass and Morningside , meeting Steeles Avenue west of its intersection with Ninth Line . However , Toronto resisted , citing the environmental effects that would come from two new crossings over the Rouge River . As such , a discontinuous alignment was planned as a compromise beginning in 2010 . However , no timeline or construction has been announced regarding the widening of Steeles to six lanes or the extension of Morningside north of Oasis Boulevard . 
 Donald Cousens Parkway will be extended north from Major Mackenzie Drive to tie in with Highway 48 , becoming the through @-@ route in the process and completing the Markham Bypass . Poor soil conditions at a planned overpass of the Stouffville GO Train line have required several years of ongoing soil consolidation , beginning in July 2012 and scheduled for completion in the fall of 2017 . Construction is set to begin in April 2018 .

 = Today ( The Smashing Pumpkins song ) = 
 " Today " is a song by American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins , written by lead vocalist and guitarist Billy Corgan . The song , though seemingly upbeat , contains dark lyrics . Corgan wrote the song about a day in which he was having suicidal thoughts , exemplified by the reference to self @-@ mutilation in the chorus . The contrast between the grim subject matter of the song and the soft instrumental part during the verses , coupled with use of irony in the lyrics , left many listeners unaware of the song 's tale of depression and desperation . The song alternates between quiet , dreamy verses and loud choruses with layered , distorted guitar similar to the noisy guitar rock of My Bloody Valentine . 
 " Today " was released in September 1993 as the second single from the band 's second album and major label debut , Siamese Dream . Although Corgan opted for " Cherub Rock " , the lead single from the album , to be the opening track , " Today " and its follow @-@ up " Disarm " are credited in AllMusic for popularizing the band and " sen [ ding ] [ Siamese Dream ] into the stratosphere " . " Today " has been generally well received by critics ; a Blender article described it as having " achieved a remarkable status as one of the defining songs of its generation , perfectly mirroring the fractured alienation of American youth in the 1990s . " 
 = = Background and recording = = 
 After the release and minor success of the band 's debut album , Gish , The Smashing Pumpkins were being hyped as " the next Nirvana " . However , the band was experiencing several difficulties at the time . Drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was undergoing an increasingly severe addiction to heroin ; James Iha and D 'arcy Wretzky had recently broken up their romantic relationship ; and Billy Corgan had become overweight , depressed to the point of contemplating suicide , and plagued by writer 's block . Corgan recalled that " after the first album , I became completely suicidal . It was an eight @-@ month depression , give or take a month , and I was pretty suicidal for about two or three months . " Under the pressure and other complications , the Pumpkins entered the Triclops Sound Studios in Atlanta to record the follow @-@ up to Gish . 
 " Today " was the first song Corgan wrote for Siamese Dream . Corgan said , " The day after I wrote ' Today , ' my manager heard it and said , ' It 's a hit , ' and I guess in a way , it was . " Corgan played the self @-@ recorded demo to producer Butch Vig and to the rest of his band , all of whom responded positively . " Today " already had a chord progression and a melody , but Corgan felt there needed to be an opening riff to the song . One day , " out of the blue , I heard the opening lick note for note in my head " , Corgan said . " When I added the opening riff , it completely changed the character of the song . Suddenly , I had a song that was starting out quiet and then got very loud . " Soon afterwards , Virgin Records executives were sent to check up on the band after hearing about their problems , but were pleased with the demo . The reaction from the executives only served to put more stress on Corgan ; as a result , he recorded most of the guitar and bass guitar parts himself , including on the finished version of " Today " . 
 Siamese Dream was completed after running four months after the deadline and considerably exceeding its budget . Virgin Records executives saw " Today " as the ideal lead single , but Corgan wanted " Cherub Rock " , one of the last songs written for the album , as the lead single . Ultimately , " Cherub Rock " was released first , but it was only a modest success . " Today " brought the band popularity through wide radio airplay and a successful music video . 
 = = Composition and lyrics = = 
 " Today " is written in the key of E @-@ flat major ( E ♭ ) and played in standard tuning . While Corgan briefly considered simply tuning the guitar down a half @-@ step and playing the song as if it were in the key of E , he said , " There was something about the E ♭ voicing that I liked . So it 's absolutely , intentionally in E ♭ , not E. " " Today " is one of the Siamese Dream songs on which Corgan took over Iha and D 'arcy 's duties on guitar and bass to ensure quality ; Wretzky later stated that Corgan " can do something in three takes where it would maybe take me 20 . " 
 The song , spanning three minutes and 21 seconds , begins with a one @-@ measure opening guitar riff that alludes to the E ♭ major @-@ pentatonic scale . Corgan uses this riff ( along with variations on it ) to emphasize certain parts and to indicate shifts in the song . After the riff is played four times , the rest of the band enters backed with feedback @-@ driven guitars . Ned Raggett of Allmusic commented on the song 's ability to " alternate between calmer , almost Cure @-@ like sections and the louder crunches , [ and Corgan 's ] soon @-@ to @-@ be @-@ trademark guitar style taking My Bloody Valentine 's own hypnotic riffing to more accessible results . " The chorus , consisting of multiple guitar tracks playing barre chords , is an example of the band 's tendency to overdub several rhythm guitar tracks . While the song does not include a standard guitar solo , a short melodic guitar part appears during the bridge . Corgan explained : " The little guitar break over the C chord is actually a forwards sample that we laid in backwards . Then there 's a weird vocal effect that moves across the speakers , a ' yan @-@ yan @-@ yan @-@ yan ' thing , which was generated by using a Roland Space Echo to regenerate on the last word of the vocal line , ' I wanna turn you on . ' " 
 The dark , ironic lyrics of " Today " , describing a day when Corgan was feeling depressed and suicidal , contrast with the instrumentation . Michael Snyder of the San Francisco Chronicle said that the song is " downright pretty as rock ballads go " but that " Corgan manages to convey the exhilaration and tragic release he seeks . " Corgan told Rolling Stone that " I was really suicidal ... I just thought it was funny to write a song that said today is the greatest day of your life because it can 't get any worse . " Corgan later compared writing the lyrics of " Today " and " Disarm " to " ripping [ his ] guts out . " 
 = = Music video = = 
 The music video , directed by Stéphane Sednaoui , brought even more mainstream success to the band through repeated airplay on MTV . The video debuted in September 1993 . It was shot with low quality photographic equipment , which , like several other early Pumpkins videos , was an intentional stylistic decision . Corgan said that the plot of the video was inspired by a memory he had of an ice cream truck driver who , upon quitting his job , gave out his remaining stock of ice cream to the neighborhood children . This image was then melded with Sednaoui 's own sensibilities inspired by the film Zabriskie Point . The video is available on The Smashing Pumpkins – Greatest Hits Video Collection ( 1991 – 2000 ) DVD , released in 2001 . 
 The video begins with Corgan reading a comic book dressed in an ice cream man uniform . A clip of the intro to the song is played and stopped repeatedly before the song begins . Groups of two or more people are kissing each other around Corgan as he drives in an ice cream van through a desert . Corgan picks up a dress @-@ wearing Iha and the two drive for a while before stopping at a gas station , where Chamberlin and Wretzky appear as gas attendants . After Iha changes into a yellow and white cowboy outfit , the band paints the van in a multitude of colors . More people are shown kissing in the hills as the band drives away from the gas station in the van . However , Corgan is ultimately kicked out of the van , and the video ends with Corgan walking off the road wearing a cowboy hat as the van drives away .

 = Tropical Storm Bonnie ( 2016 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Bonnie was a weak but persistent tropical cyclone that brought heavy rains to the Southeastern United States in May 2016 . The second storm of the season , Bonnie formed from an area of low pressure northeast of the Bahamas on May 27 , a few days before the official hurricane season began on June 1 . Moving steadily west @-@ northwestwards , Bonnie intensified into a tropical storm on May 28 and attained peak winds six hours later . However , due to hostile environmental conditions , Bonnie weakened to a depression hours before making landfall just east of Charleston , South Carolina , on May 29 . Steering currents collapsed afterwards , causing the storm to meander over South Carolina for two days . The storm weakened further into a post @-@ tropical cyclone on May 31 , before emerging off the coast while moving generally east @-@ northeastwards . On June 2 , Bonnie regenerated into a tropical depression just offshore North Carolina as conditions became slightly more favorable . The next day , despite increasing wind shear and cooling sea surface temperatures , Bonnie reintensified into a tropical storm and reached its peak intensity . The storm hung on to tropical storm strength for another day , before weakening into a depression late on June 4 and became post @-@ tropical early the next day . 
 Lingering over South Carolina for a few days , Bonnie brought heavy rains and widespread floods to the Southeastern United States . Rainfall totals hit 6 inches ( 150 mm ) in much of South Carolina , and exceeded 10 in ( 250 mm ) in some areas . Flooding resulted in the closure of the southbound lanes of Interstate 95 in Jasper County , and also inundated the Jasper County Sheriff ’ s Office and Detention Center . In Ridgeland , several buildings were damaged and the local wastewater treatment plant overflowed , spilling discharge into the nearby Captain Bill Creek . Damage in this county alone exceeded $ 640 @,@ 000 ( 2016 USD ) . Record @-@ breaking rainfall was observed across much of the Outer Banks ; on Hatteras Island , Cape Point Campground was closed for a week due to flooding . Two people drowned in rip currents along the coastline of the Southeast United States .

 On May 24 , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) began monitoring an area of disturbed weather resulting from the interaction of a weakening cold front and an upper @-@ level trough . A surface area of low pressure formed late the next day , and the low eventually gained sufficient organization for the NHC to declare it a tropical depression at 5 : 00 p.m. EDT ( 21 : 00 UTC ) on May 27 . At the time , the depression was located about 435 miles ( 695 km ) southeast of Charleston , South Carolina , and moving west @-@ northwestwards in response to a low over the northwestern Bahamas and a ridge near the coast of North Carolina . Strong vertical wind shear and dry air in the region hindered strengthening , however , the depression was located over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream . In the afternoon of May 28 , a burst of deep convection developed near the northwestern part of the exposed low @-@ level circulation center ( LLCC ) , and the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Bonnie . 
 Despite strong southerly shear exposing the LLCC , Bonnie intensified slightly to reach its initial peak intensity with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) as it turned towards the north . However , the continued effects of high wind shear and dry air caused the cyclone 's appearance to significantly degrade early on May 29 , as deep convection dissipated due to more than 46 mph ( 74 km / h ) of southerly shear . Bonnie weakened back to tropical depression strength less than an hour prior to its landfall just east of Charleston , South Carolina . Caught in weak steering currents , the depression meandered over South Carolina for over a day before degenerating to a remnant low over the northeastern portion of the state at 11 : 00 a.m. EDT ( 15 : 00 UTC ) on May 30 . 
 The remnant circulation continued to move slowly and erratically as it emerged off the coast on May 31 , before accelerating east @-@ northeastwards and reintensifying slightly . Amidst light wind shear and high sea surface temperatures ( SSTs ) , organization improved as convection persisted near the center , and Bonnie regenerated into a tropical depression on June 2 . The next day , despite worsening conditions , a burst of convection around the center led to Bonnie once again being declared a tropical storm , simultaneously attaining a new minimum pressure of 1006 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 71 inHg ) . Increasing northwesterly shear and cooling SSTs soon became evident as the LLCC became exposed to the west , however Bonnie continued to maintain tropical storm strength . On the afternoon of June 4 , Bonnie began to succumb to the unfavorable conditions , and the storm weakened into a tropical depression . Early the next day , Bonnie degenerated once more into a post @-@ tropical cyclone . The storm continued moving east @-@ southeastward over the Atlantic Ocean , and eventually dissipated early the next day . 
 = = Preparations , impact and records = = 
 Upon formation , a tropical storm warning was issued , covering the Savannah River to the Little River Inlet in South Carolina . These were discontinued when Bonnie weakened to a depression at 8 : 00 a.m. EDT ( 12 : 00 UTC ) on May 29 . Total rainfall accumulations in South Carolina from Bonnie peaked at 10 @.@ 43 inches ( 265 mm ) in Ridgeland . The heavy rains affected several coastal businesses expecting high numbers of tourists over the Memorial Day weekend . The heavy rains led to significant flooding , prompting the South Carolina Highway Patrol to close at least seven roads in Jasper County , including the southbound lanes of Interstate 95 . Other road closures occurred in Dorchester and Hampton counties , after flooding rendered them impassible . Across Jasper County , four buildings sustained major damage and ten others experienced minor damage , primarily within the town of Ridgeland . Water inundated both the Jasper County Sheriff ’ s Office and Detention Center , prompting the relocation of one @-@ third of its inmates . Ridgeland 's wastewater treatment plant overflowed , spilling 75 @,@ 000 to 100 @,@ 000 gallons ( 280 @,@ 000 to 380 @,@ 000 liters ) of discharge into the nearby Captain Bill Creek . Bonnie is estimated to have caused over $ 640 @,@ 000 ( 2016 USD ) in structural damage in Jasper County alone . At Charleston International Airport , a sustained wind of 31 mph ( 50 km / h ) and a gust to 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) were observed ; these were the highest recorded windspeeds related to the cyclone on land . 
 In Georgia , precipitation reached 7 @.@ 74 in ( 197 mm ) at Oliver . In Bulloch County , several roads were inundated or closed due to high water . Some ponds exceeded their banks . Heavy rainfall , record @-@ breaking in some areas , was observed in much of the Outer Banks of North Carolina . Precipitation peaked at 8 @.@ 21 in ( 209 mm ) at the Billy Mitchell Airport in Hatteras . At that location , 7 @.@ 09 in ( 180 mm ) of rain fell on May 30 , breaking the old record set in 1940 . Furthermore , a new monthly rainfall record for the month of May was observed — 12 @.@ 67 in ( 322 mm ) of rain fell during that month . At least 7 in ( 180 mm ) of rain fell on Hatteras Island , resulting in the closure of Cape Point Campground and its online reservation system for a week . Several beach ramps were inundated with at least 6 in ( 150 mm ) of standing water and some were rendered impassible , however none were closed . Tropical Storm Colin would later combine with Bonnie to produce at least 10 in ( 250 mm ) of standing water in farmlands in Hyde and Beaufort counties , damaging young and newly planted crops . 
 Swells generated by Bonnie created an elevated risk of rip currents along the coastline of the Southeastern United States . Several water rescues were carried out . A 21 @-@ year @-@ old man went missing at Carolina Beach on May 28 ; his body was recovered in New Hanover County , North Carolina , three days later . Further south , the body of a 20 @-@ year @-@ old man was recovered in Brevard County , Florida , after he drowned . 
 When Bonnie formed on May 27 , it became the first occurrence of two pre @-@ season Atlantic storms since 2012 , and only the second occurrence since 1951 . The first storm , Alex , had formed in January . 
 = Ivalice = 
 Ivalice ( <unk> , <unk> ) is a fictional universe setting primarily appearing in the Final Fantasy video game series . The world was conceived by Yasumi Matsuno when he joined Square ( now Square Enix ) in 1995 , and has since been expanded upon by several games , with more yet due with the Ivalice Alliance series . Ivalice is described as a complex world with a very long history , and the stories of Final Fantasy Tactics , Vagrant Story and Final Fantasy XII are said to unfold quite close on the Ivalice map . 
 Though described often as a world , this was only physically true of Ivalice in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance , in which Ivalice was created parallel to the real world . The ' true ' Ivalice , as witnessed in the remaining games , describes two distinct locations ; a geographical region , and a smaller kingdom , both of which belong to a larger , unnamed world . Generally , however , the term Ivalice is also used to refer to the conceptual setting , rather as one might say the Medieval world of Europe and the Mediterranean . 
 = = Concept and creation = = 
 Ivalice was created by Yasumi Matsuno as a fictional world with its own identity ; a medieval @-@ like world where magic and machine exist together . The usual elements of Final Fantasy , such as Chocobos , crystals and magic spells , blend into the setting . This setting first appeared in Final Fantasy Tactics , a game produced mostly by the team that made Ogre Battle and Tactics Ogre , and was Matsuno 's first project with Square following his departure from Quest in 1995 . Matsuno 's next game , Vagrant Story , featured several allusions to Final Fantasy Tactics , and Matsuno stated in 2004 that Vagrant Story , Final Fantasy Tactics , and Final Fantasy XII unfold quite close on the map of Ivalice , " a complex world with a very long history and the stories " . 
 Following Matsuno 's departure from Square Enix during development on Final Fantasy XII , Square Enix has continued to feature Ivalice in other games . 
 In 2011 , Matsuno stated that he never originally intended for Vagrant Story to take place in Ivalice . As a result , any references he had made of Final Fantasy Tactics in Vagrant Story , as well as Vagrant Story references in Final Fantasy XII , only serve as " fan service " . 
 = = Appearances = = 
 = = = Video games = = = 
 Final Fantasy Tactics ( 1997 ) , a tactical role @-@ playing game developed and published by Square for the Sony PlayStation video game console , marked the first appearance of Ivalice . The game combined thematic elements of the Final Fantasy video game series with a game engine and battle system unlike those previously seen in the franchise . Final Fantasy Tactics is set in a fictional medieval @-@ inspired kingdom called Ivalice and created by Yasumi Matsuno . The game 's story follows Ramza Beoulve , a highborn cadet who finds himself thrust into the middle of an intricate military conflict known as The Lion War , where two opposing noble factions are coveting the throne of the kingdom . As the story progresses , Ramza and his allies discover a sinister plot behind the war . 
 In an interview with Akito Inoue , an assistant professor at the International University of Japan , Inoue mentions that Final Fantasy Tactics was made because of how casual gamers are usually put off by games with branching storylines found in Matsuno 's other titles such as Tactics Ogre . 
 Vagrant Story ( 1999 ) is an action role @-@ playing game featuring no shops and no player interaction with other characters ; instead , the game focuses on weapon creation and modification , as well as elements of puzzle @-@ solving and strategy . The game takes place in the fictional kingdom of Valendia and the ruined city of Leá Monde . The story centers on Ashley Riot , an elite agent known as a Riskbreaker , who must travel to Leá Monde to investigate the link between a cult leader and a senior <unk> Parliament member , Duke Bardorba . In the prologue , Ashley is blamed for murdering the duke , and the game discloses the events that happen one week before the murder . 
 Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is a tactical role @-@ playing game developed and published by Square for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance . The game shares several traits with Final Fantasy Tactics , although it is not a direct sequel . The game 's story centers on four children ; Marche , Mewt , Ritz , and Doned , who live in a small town named St. Ivalice . The children are transported to a realm of the same name as their town , " Ivalice " , after discovering an ancient magical book . The story then focuses on the exploits of Marche as he attempts to return to the real world while facing opposition from those around him . 
 Development on the game began when Square announced its publishing agreement with Nintendo , and it was later confirmed by the producer Matsuno . The development team of Tactics Advance , Square 's Product Development Division 4 , was constructed from employees of Quest Corporation , and work began in February 2002 . This comes after Quest announced the handover of its software development team to Square , of which the former is famed for its Tactics Ogre series . 
 Final Fantasy XII ( 2006 ) is a role @-@ playing video game developed and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 2 platform . It is the twelfth title in the mainline Final Fantasy series . The game introduced several innovations to the offline titles in the mainline series : an open world , a seamless battle system , a controllable camera , a customizable " gambit " system which lets the player automatically control the actions of characters ; and a " license " system which determines which abilities and equipment are used by characters . 
 The game takes place in the fictional land of Ivalice , where the empires of Archadia and Rozarria are waging an endless war . Dalmasca , a small kingdom , is caught between the warring nations . When Dalmasca is annexed by Archadia , its princess , Ashe , creates a resistance movement . During the struggle , she meets Vaan , a young adventurer who dreams of becoming a sky pirate in command of an airship . They are quickly joined by a band of allies ; together , they rally against the tyranny of the Archadian Empire . 
 On December 13 , 2006 , a Square Enix representative informed Tokyo reporters that the already announced Final Fantasy XII : Revenant Wings would be joined by other games in a new subseries known as the Ivalice Alliance . Final Fantasy Tactics : The War of the Lions is a PlayStation Portable and iOS port of the original Final Fantasy Tactics game . Final Fantasy Tactics A2 : Grimoire of the Rift is a Nintendo DS sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance , albeit set in the actual Ivalice world and not an artificial illusory world , unlike its predecessor . Another title in the collection , Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System , was revealed on May 8 , 2007 . 
 Executive producer Akitoshi Kawazu explained that the aim of the Ivalice Alliance is to " spread the word about the world of Ivalice " , and to bring more players into the franchise , with new titles not restricted to the standard role @-@ playing game genre but also tactical games and games similar to Vagrant Story . Revenant Wings director Motomu Toriyama noted that with the large and original team that worked on Final Fantasy XII , Ivalice became more Square Enix 's world than that of the former Quest team , and that the Ivalice Alliance world is thus slightly more influenced by Final Fantasy XII than the earlier Ivalice titles . 
 Crystal Defenders is a series of turn @-@ based strategy video games developed by MSF / Winds and published by Square Enix . It comprises several iterations released for mobile phones and through online video game delivery services . The games are set in the fictional world of Ivalice and features job classes , monsters and summoned creatures from the tactical role @-@ playing game Final Fantasy Tactics A2 : Grimoire of the Rift . 
 Fortress is the code name of a cancelled action role @-@ playing video game that was in development by Grin . Director Ulf Andersson devised the concept for Fortress and pre @-@ production began in the second half of 2008 . During development , Square Enix approached the developer and proposed making the game a spin @-@ off of Final Fantasy XII . Grin reconceived the game in the recurring Final Fantasy world of Ivalice , and included elements of Final Fantasy XII such as stylistic motifs and character designs ; additional elements included chocobos and other recurring creatures from the Final Fantasy series . It was to be released on the Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 3 , and Xbox 360 platforms . 
 During development , Square Enix did not pay Grin over several months , and disapproved of the game 's Nordic art style . Grin worked to bring the game 's art style closer to the Final Fantasy series , but after six months of development was told that no funding would ever come from Square Enix , and the developer filed for bankruptcy several days later . Word of the project leaked out through art portfolios of those who worked on the project and even a tech demo surfaced . In 2011 , Fortress was thought to have been in development by an undisclosed studio , but this was also suspended and the game will not be released in any form . 
 Final Fantasy Tactics S is a tactical role @-@ playing game with social features and multiplayer battles . It was released in Japan on the Mobage social gaming network in May 2013 . 
 = = = Other media = = = 
 In Japan , Final Fantasy Tactics Advance 's story was expanded and broadcast in Japanese radio stations . The radio drama entitled Final Fantasy Tactics Advance Radio Edition was broadcast in four radio stations within Japan from early January 2003 to late March 2003 . 
 Final Fantasy XII was adapted into a manga by Gin Amou . Square Enix published the series in a total of five tankōbon volumes from December 22 , 2006 to August 22 , 2009 . 
 = = Setting = = 
 = = = Geography = = = 
 = = = = Kingdom of Ivalice = = = = 
 The events of Final Fantasy Tactics are set in the kingdom of Ivalice , which borders Ordalia in the east and the insular nation of <unk> in the north @-@ west , from which it is separated by the Larner Channel . The kingdom forms a peninsula and is composed of seven provinces which were individual kingdoms before their unification : <unk> , Lionel , Lesalia , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Mullonde . 
 The insular province of Mullonde is home to the Glabados Church and is ruled separately from the royal government . In the game 's backstory , Mullonde 's territory was once connected to the mainland , but was mostly submerged by a disaster involving the Zodiac Stones and which occurred soon after Saint Ajora 's execution , with its city made into a Necrohol , a city of the dead . The city of <unk> , Ajora 's birthplace , is governed by the Church although it is enclosed in the province of Lesalia . 
 Prior to the events of Final Fantasy Tactics , the Fara church dominated the kingdom of Ivalice . The remake of Final Fantasy Tactics , Final Fantasy Tactics : The War of the Lions , refers to the Fara Church as <unk> . The life of Ajora saw Fara replaced with the new Glabados church which , by the time of the game , is the major religion of the kingdom . Glabados is monotheistic and intensely political , underscoring much of Ivalice history . Followers of Glabados use the word " <unk> " to affirm their prayers . During the events of the game , the church is revealed to have put a large spin on history , particularly the events surrounding the life of Ajora , a messianic figure . 
 = = = = Leá Monde = = = = 
 Vagrant Story is set in the ruins of the city of Leá Monde . The kingdom of Valendia is also heavily mentioned , and a few of its locations are featured in the prologue and the ending sequence . In contrast to the other Ivalice games , magic is rare , being suppressed by religious doctrine . Other races are never mentioned , so one can assume that all other races aside from Humes have become extinct by this time . 
 Vagrant Story centers around the " Dark " , a formless , invisible entity . In places where the Dark runs strongest , those who died will have their corpses controlled by the dark , becoming the undead . The Dark exists within a person as negative energy that unleashes the individual 's latent power . Throughout the story , many individuals crave the powers of the Dark , which centers around the abandoned city of Leá Monde . Another mythological aspect of Vagrant Story is the Kiltia , an ancient cult which built itself upon the Dark and ancient sorcery , and of which the Müllenkamp sect is stemmed from . It can be seen that most rituals and summoning performed in the game involved ancient Kildean magic . 
 In Vagrant Story , the Iocus priesthood of the kingdom of Valendia is shown to use the Kildean rood as a symbol , although they follow the teachings of a saint named Iocus instead of the original Kildean teachings of the Kiltia religion of Leá Monde . Müllenkamp , founder of the city of Leá Monde featured in the story , used to be a priestess of Kiltia , and bore the rood on her back . The followers of St. Iocus are outwardly intolerant of magic , seeing it as an abomination , and yet its higher members continue to use it behind the scenes . This hypocrisy is revealed over the course of the story , though it goes unresolved . 
 = = = = St. Ivalice = = = = 
 In Final Fantasy Tactics Advance , the protagonist lives in a land called St. Ivalice . Following the characters ' discovery of the book called the Gran Grimoire , St. Ivalice was transformed into a " mirror " of the " real " kingdom of Ivalice . The races seen in the world of Tactics Advance — Bangaa , Moogle , Viera and Nu Mou — reappear in the game Final Fantasy XII , the setting of which has come to represent the " real " Ivalice . This is apparently explained as Mewt replied that Final Fantasy was his favorite game ; with the Races and elements such as Ivalice , one would assume St. Ivalice was based on Final Fantasy XII . The sequel to the game , Final Fantasy Tactics A2 : Grimoire of the Rift , also takes place in both St. Ivalice and the Ivalice of Final Fantasy XII . 
 = = = = Galtean Peninsula = = = = 
 In Final Fantasy XII , Ivalice covers three continents , Ordalia , Valendia and Kerwon . The demography consists of the known races : Humes , Bangaa , Viera , Seeq and Moogles , and other minority races . Civilization is advanced in this world where the use of a magical stone called magicite is extensive in everyday life , airships are a prominent transportation and multi @-@ story buildings cover the cityscape . Ivalice in Final Fantasy XII is designed based on a mixture of cultures . According to the game developers , these designs are inspired from a mixture of medieval Mediterranean countries , Turkish architecture , art @-@ deco from Indian architecture , the cityscape of New York and the Arabic culture found hidden in European countries . As such , many patterns are featured as geometrical and Arabesque in shape . The cityscape is also conceived by Matsuno as being dirty and weather @-@ worn , mirroring the conditions of a medieval landscape . The natural landscape also mirrors Earth 's geographical features , including large expanse of deserts and snowy mountains . 
 In Final Fantasy XII , the continents in Ivalice are presently home to three nations : Rozarria , Archadia and Dalmasca . There was once the Kingdom of Nabradia and the Republic of Landis in Valendia , now either destroyed or assimilated into the Archadian Empire . Strategically located between the rival neighboring empires of Archadia and Rozarria , Dalmasca 's position as a neutral buffer region between the two countries is eliminated when it is invaded by Archadia at the onset of the game . With the fall of Landis and Nabradia and its reduction to an occupied territory under Archadian rule , Dalmasca is set to play a central role in the still @-@ heated dispute between its neighbors , which is escalating once more . 
 The events of Final Fantasy XII are focused on the area around the Galtean Peninsula , itself located in the larger Ivalice region . This area of Ivalice is diverse in both geography and climate , ranging from the hilly , clement grasslands of southern Valendia to the deserts of Dalmasca . In Kerwon , south of Dalmasca , the lands are arid at lower altitudes , though the higher elevations are the only places in the region known to receive snow . The north of Kerwon is heavily forested , home to the dense Golmore Jungle , within which lies the magical <unk> . 
 These various micro @-@ climates are influenced by the magical phenomenon known as Mist , an unstable substance with the ability to cause great variation over small areas . Due to the influence of Mist , several areas of Ivalice are ' <unk> ' , areas in which Mist @-@ laden winds and magicite @-@ rich soil interfere with airship mechanisms . As such , <unk> tend to be harsh , lawless frontiers , uncontrolled by any nation . Physically , the peninsula area resembles Europe in the east , with the landmasses of Valendia , Ordalia and Kerwon surrounding a central body of water ( the <unk> Sea ) on three sides . To the west , Valendia and Kerwon curve away from Ordalia , creating the Galtean Peninsula . 
 Mist is responsible for the existence of ' magicite ' , stones that contain magical powers due to the presence of Mist in their crystalline structure . Magicite is divided into three types ; <unk> that are used in spell casting , <unk> that are installed into a component known as ' <unk> rings ' that give flight to the vehicles , whether small @-@ sized bikes or large airships , and <unk> that function much like recording devices . The quality of magicite depends on the quantity of Mist and not on the size or shape of the stone . The <unk> of magic and magicite , as well as its cost @-@ efficiency , led to it replacing electricity and its various sources as the dominant usable energy in Ivalice . 
 Nethicite , another type of magicite , works by absorbing Mist , thus nullifying the effects of magic and storing vast amounts of power . Nethicite can be described as either deifacted or manufacted ( literally , god @-@ made or man @-@ made ) . During the course of the game , it is discovered that deifacted nethicite is nethicite created by the Occuria , and that the ultimate source of known pieces of deifacted nethicite is the Sun @-@ Cryst they created . <unk> nethicite contains a large amount of magic and is known to influence the history of Ivalice . 
 In Final Fantasy XII , the Light of Kiltia , a polytheistic religion , is the dominant church in Ivalice , having influence in the political affairs of the region around the Galtean Peninsula . Despite this , the church maintains an apolitical stance , with its most high @-@ ranking officials banned from participating in political affairs altogether . At its head is the Gran Kiltias , being the Helgas Anastasis at the time of Final Fantasy XII , until his death during the events of the story . Like Glabados followers in Final Fantasy Tactics , Kiltias swear on the name of <unk> , the Father of All , in the manner of the Christian amen . The Final Fantasy XII Ultimania Ω guide considers the Glabados Church a possible branch of Kiltia . 
 = = = = Purvama Lemurés = = = = 
 Some of the locations in the Ivalice of Final Fantasy XII returned in its sequel , Final Fantasy XII : Revenant Wings , along with a new area called Lemurés . A legendary Purvama ( Floating Continent ) raised into the skies by the god Feolthanos long ago , this land is ruled by three " Sacred Crystals " called Auraliths , which erected a barrier to shield the Purvama from the rest of the world . In Revenant Wings , the " Legend of the Floating Land " has become an ambition for Sky Pirates who seek the island for Auracite , pieces of Auralith able to allow one to summon entities called Yarhi . The ruins of Lemurés are where the Aegyl reside . During the course of the game , the main characters learn that the sealing of Lemurés was the work of the Occuria , whom Feolthanos defied prior to using the Auralith to become a god @-@ like being . 
 In the backstory of Final Fantasy XII : Revenant Wings , Feolthanos established a personality cult over Lemurés , labeling himself to his people as a god . Though Lemurés still had a sense of peace and paradise , in spite of Yarhi attacks , it was a false paradise due to the <unk> draining the Aegyl of their anima as part of Feolthanos ' plan to destroy Ivalice as revenge against the Occurians . 
 = = = = Jylland = = = = 
 Taking place only a few years after Final Fantasy XII : Revenant Wings , Final Fantasy Tactics A2 : Grimoire of the Rift introduces a new region of Ivalice called Jylland . The region of Jylland is made up of the western half of the Ordalia Continent and the eastern half of the Loar Continent , with Jagd <unk> to the north of the two continents . There are five regions spread out across these two continents , which consist of smaller territories inside of them , twenty being the number of territories throughout Jylland , which contain a varying number of areas ( battlefields ) in each of them ( eighty @-@ six areas in all of Jylland ) . The towns in Jylland include <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Goug . Goug in particular , is a town of Moogles . Another race similar to the Aegyl also was introduced along with this game . Called Gria , these winged females are small , but pack a mean punch , specializing in three new classes and one old one . <unk> , Ravager , and Raptor , along with the before @-@ human exclusive class Hunter were given to the Gria , and only the geomancer class uses magic . 
 = = = Timeline = = = 
 The timeline of Ivalice as presented in the games was left quite vague , and formerly other official sources had said little on the matter . A few sources have made their own conclusion on the timeline of Ivalice . The official timeline , however , was eventually given in the Final Fantasy XII Ultimania Omega , and placed the events of Final Fantasy XII before those of Final Fantasy Tactics . 
 There is no direct mention of Ivalice in Vagrant Story . However , several references are made ; the Kingdom of Valendia , the setting for Vagrant Story , shares its name with a continent of Ivalice appearing in Final Fantasy XII . The Kiltia religion , featured in Final Fantasy XII , was the religion of the ghost town Leá Monde , in which the story takes place . Additionally , a quotation from Arazlam J. Durai , a famous historian of Ivalice who lived 400 years after the War of the Lions ( and narrator of the Zodiac Brave Story told in Final Fantasy Tactics ) , is used at the beginning of the game , and the descriptions of several items make direct reference to the same story . This would seem to place Vagrant Story latest in the timeline , given its direct references to the events of Final Fantasy Tactics . Matsuno has said that he never intended Vagrant Story to be in the same world as Tactics and Final Fantasy XII , though he noted that Square Enix advertising might not agree . 
 Some confusion still persists , particularly due to the facts surrounding Saint Ajora , who was executed 1200 years prior to the events of Final Fantasy Tactics , yet in the Clan Primer of Final Fantasy XII is said to have separated from the Light of Kiltia religion shortly after its foundation , already two thousand years old . While no gender is specified in the North American release of Final Fantasy XII , in both the Japanese Clan Primer and the Ultimania timeline , Ajora is referred to as Seijo Ajora ( <unk> , lit . Holy Woman Ajora ) , while Ajora of Final Fantasy Tactics is male . 
 Final Fantasy Tactics A2 : Grimoire of the Rift has been confirmed by the developers to take place after Final Fantasy XII , and both Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and A2 to take place " near " in time to Final Fantasy XII . 
 = = = Races = = = 
 The populations seen in Final Fantasy Tactics and Vagrant Story are essentially human . The other intelligent races who appear are hostile or monster @-@ like , such as Goblins or Ogres . Friendly intelligent races appear in later games set in Ivalice , where the human race is called Humes . Monsters and the like are thought not to exist by the general populace in Vagrant Story , with the monsters in the isolated Leá Monde all stemming from the Dark . The races are sorted by appearance and then according to the alphabetical order . 
 Ivalice as featured in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance is populated by four main intelligent races in addition to Humes ; all of them also reappearing in Final Fantasy XII . 
 The Bangaa ( <unk> , Banga ) are a reptilian race living almost twice as long as Humes . Being a very socially and cognitively advanced race , they hate being called " lizards " as this is regarded as an offensive slur . Bangaa in Final Fantasy XII are often considered to be the most integrated of all races into Hume society , and are the race most friendly with the latter , as exemplified with Migelo . Bangaa possess great agility and strength , and acute senses of hearing and smell , making them excellent hunters and fighters . However , their eyesight is so poor that some wear blindfolds as part of their clothing . Their magical abilities are generally poor due to problems their unique mouth gives them when chanting magic spells . To make up for this , some Bangaa have developed exclusive high level spells for the race to use . They are also said to be distantly related to lizard men . 
 The Moogles ( <unk> , <unk> ) are a resourceful race known to be skillful in mechanics and engineering ; they were the pioneers of airship construction . They have longer , rabbit @-@ like ears and tend to have more beige or gray fur . In Final Fantasy Tactics Advance , the player is guided through the world of Ivalice by the moogles Montblanc and Nono . In Final Fantasy XII , these two characters return albeit with different roles . Although Moogles were featured in Final Fantasy Tactics only as summoned creatures , their race is mentioned in the backstory as having once lived in the <unk> Woods . 
 The Nu Mou ( <unk> ・ <unk> , N Mou ) are a dog @-@ like race . They are short and hunched ; half the size of an adult Hume , are adept in magic and can speak with monsters . The Nu Mou 's lifespan is three times longer than that of a Hume . Two Nu Mou , <unk> Swain and <unk> <unk> , appear as optional playable characters in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance . All of the races have an infinite number of possible playable characters , but these two are the only Nu Mou with special sprites . In Final Fantasy XII , most of the Nu Mou appear as acolytes of the Kiltia religion , found mainly in Mt . Bur @-@ Omisace . 
 The Viera ( <unk> , Viera ) are a rabbit @-@ like race that can live three times as long as a Hume , and divided into two subraces : The light @-@ skinned Veena and dark @-@ skinned Rava . The Viera have rabbit or deer @-@ like features , most notably their long ears . Their feet are shaped in such a way that in order to stand they must wear high heels . Their slender forms heighten their senses and speed , and although their defense is low , Viera agility and finesse are unmatched by the other races . In Final Fantasy Tactics Advance , <unk> have blue @-@ white , pale green , or purple @-@ white hair , with only a few having hair that is pure white , which is considered to be a blessing . Viera can listen to the surrounding nature and sense Mist , and can sometimes go berserk from feeling an overwhelmingly vast quantity of active Mist . In Final Fantasy XII , they live in hidden villages deep within the vast forests of Ivalice . The Viera believe themselves to be intimately tied to the " Wood " , a part of the forests themselves , and are rarely involved in matters outside the wood . A Viera that moves out of the forest , like Fran , is considered an outcast and dead to her people . Mixed breeds of Veena and Rava Viera have accustomed themselves to coexist within Hume society , dyeing their white hair . Regarding the lack of males seen , it is found that males and females live separately , only meeting when there is a need for it . 
 Final Fantasy XII introduces several other races to Ivalice , with varying importance in the plot of the game . 
 The Baknamy ( <unk> , <unk> ) are a green @-@ skinned humanoid race . Their bodies are relatively small in stature ; even as an adult , their height is only the size of a child Hume . After the kingdom of Nabradia ceased to exist , they designated the Necrohol of Nabudis as their stronghold . The Baknamy are sensitive to the air that they breathe , and living where the air is polluted due to the city 's destruction forces them to wear gas masks . The poorer and less fortunate Baknamy commit crimes to earn a living , targeting adventurers and travelers , causing Humes to view them as a despicable race . 
 The Garif ( <unk> , <unk> ) of Final Fantasy XII are depicted as large , thick @-@ furred <unk> of nature and the arts of war , but disliking unnecessary violence . They have high smelling and hearing senses , which make them able hunters . The Garif prefer to adorn themselves with natural ornaments of animal bones and stones over crafted objects , with the exception of a traditional mask which is worn from birth to death . Their villages are sparsely located in the <unk> Region , and each is governed by a council led by a High Elder . Relations with other races are peaceful but rare . Garif merchants are known to trade with the nomads of Giza Plains and the <unk> , exchanging items such as <unk> spices . In ancient times , the Occuria granted the Garif nethicite , however the Garif 's dislike for violence hindered them from using its power . 
 The Helgas ( <unk> , <unk> ) are a long @-@ living , highly intelligent race . Helgas are white @-@ haired , tall , thin , and have long limbs . They can communicate telepathically while asleep , and also probe into the dreams of others . Gran Kiltias Anastasis is the only Helgas who appears within Final Fantasy XII . 
 The Rev ( <unk> , <unk> ) are a minor , feline race that appears in Skycity Bhujerba . They are deeply cultured and a bit aristocratic , and act as advisors and representatives for Marquis Halim Ondore the IV . 
 The Seeq ( <unk> , <unk> ) are a powerful and agile porcine race possessing low intellect and described as barely able to speak human languages . Though somewhat cowardly , they are often hired as mercenaries , guards , or hunters , with a significant amount going into thievery . The Seeq are also attracted by shiny objects , often adorning themselves with such . Seeq often adorn themselves with markings of sorts , the most common being something that resembles a smiley face on their chest . Males and Females are almost impossible to distinguish , the only real sign being that females often wear some clothing on their upper bodies . 
 The Urutan @-@ Yensa ( <unk> ＝ <unk> , Urutan @-@ <unk> ) are the " Lords and Masters of the Great Sea " , a name bestowed befitting their presence in the Yensa <unk> and mastery in taming the Yensa fish for travel . Evolved from crustaceans , their bodies are thin and entirely covered by layers of clothing , which the game 's Bestiary states is either to hide their ugly bodies or to keep themselves protected from the sun . The Urutan @-@ Yensa divided into separate tribes ruled by a queen able to speak the Hume language , and are strictly territorial , attacking anyone who enters their lands . Urutan @-@ Yensa are particularly proud and attached to honor so much that requesting the aid of others outside their race results in a death penalty . They sometimes exile tribe members that show unusual aggressive and violent nature , known as the Urutan @-@ Exile . 
 Final Fantasy XII : Revenant Wings introduces two other races : 
 The Aegyl ( <unk> , <unk> ) is a winged , humanlike race appearing in Final Fantasy XII : Revenant Wings . These wings count as both a blessing ( able to fly in the air ) and a curse ( resulting in a short lifespan of 40 years ) . The Aegyl dwell in the ruins of the Lemurés . They are a people without emotion and thus have no true conflict amongst themselves , but there are a few who tend to go against the will of their people ; such as Llyud . But overtime , as Auraliths were being destroyed , the Aegyl regained their emotions , with some feeling mostly rage on the sky pirates who terrorized them and Ivalice for its sins against them . Their race departed from Ivalice when Lemurés crumbled . 
 The Feol Viera ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> Viera ) is a sub @-@ race of the Viera , characterized by light blond hair and shorter ears than standard Viera . They are the descendants of the Aegyl chief Feolthanos who fell in love with a full @-@ blood Viera . The Feol were from birth treated as exiles by their full blood kin , cast out of the Wood to take refuge at Roda Volcano , where none dare enter . Since they have no wings , Feolthanos left the airship Galbana and the Auracite in the hopes that one day they come to him . His inheritance was received by Mydia / Judge of Wings , who decimated all that remained of his progeny to ensure that her people would never learn the truth behind their patriarch . 
 Lastly , Final Fantasy Tactics A2 : Grimoire of the Rift features two other races : 
 The Gria ( <unk> , <unk> ) are a winged , humanoid race in Final Fantasy Tactics A2 : Grimoire of the Rift . The Gria are born with dragon @-@ like wings and horns , and excel at physical combat . All Gria featured in the game are female , but it is never stated whether all members are female or if males exist . 
 The <unk> are a subspecies of the above @-@ mentioned Rev race . Their features are not as feline but they do share the pointed ears . Cid and <unk> are members of this race . 
 = = = Mythos = = = 
 Within Final Fantasy Tactics , legends revolve around the Zodiac Brave Story , which deals with twelve knights who used the power of Zodiac Stones — magical stones engraved with symbols of the twelve Zodiac constellations — to fight against a demon summoned by an ambitious king to control Ivalice . This myth was twisted by the Glabados Church , as explained in the game 's backstory , by including St. Ajora as the leader of the Zodiac Braves . 
 The " Lucavi " are demons linked to the twelve Zodiac Stones who seek to gain control of Ivalice by resurrecting their defeated leader , the High Seraph , Ultima . Any person who holds a Zodiac Stone may make a contract with the <unk> demon associated with it , and in doing so , become one with that demon . During the events of the game , the Lucavi manipulate the Glabados Church into controlling the War of the Lions to ensure enough bloodshed for Ultima 's resurrection . A thirteenth Lucavi , associated with the sun constellation Ophiuchus , can also be found in a side @-@ quest . Some of the Lucavi reappear as Totema in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance , while a sub @-@ boss , <unk> , becomes a " <unk> " before his final encounter with the party , with an appearance similar to that of a vampire @-@ type enemy . They also reappear in Final Fantasy XII as summoned Espers — with backstories that describe how they became known as Lucavi . It is also revealed that they were creations of the Occuria from Final Fantasy XII . In the new translation of the PSP version of Final Fantasy Tactics , the Zodiac Stones are also referred to as Auracite — the same stone used to summon the Yarhi and <unk> ( the Lucavi ) in Final Fantasy XII : Revenant Wings . 
 Final Fantasy XII also introduces the " Occuria " , immortal beings who have no visible faces , only a pair of glowing yellow eyes seen under their floating shell @-@ like armor , surrounded by an aquamarine aura . The Occuria can become selectively invisible , and are also capable of possession , shape @-@ shifting and image projection . Referred to by some as gods , but unknown to the main religions in Ivalice , the Occuria race played a central role in the history of Ivalice , controlling all major events , such as the rise of the Dynast @-@ King Raithwall . Though peace fostered in Ivalice in the four @-@ hundred year rule after Raithwall , the Occurian Venat , apparently disgusted with its kind 's manipulations , rebelled and gave the secret of Nethicite to the Archadia 's Dr. Cid and Vayne to overthrow the Occuria and make mankind the masters of their own fate . The events of the game eventually provoke the end the " Age of Stones " ( the Occuria 's control over Ivalice ) . In Final Fantasy XII : Revenant Wings , the Occuria were revealed to have played a part in the sealing of the Purvama Lemurés long ago , which by the present time became a land of legend that many Sky Pirates sought for its Auracite . 
 Revenant Wings also introduced beings known as the " Yarhi " . Also known as " Espers " to those on Ivalice , they are powerful entities created from anima , spiritual energy . Through certain elements , such as Auracite or Mist , the Yarhi can assume physical form until they are defeated in battle . They are summoned by the wielders of Auracite and obey their every command . Fourteen such Yarhi appeared in Final Fantasy XII ; the first thirteen being the Lucavi from Final Fantasy Tactics which are referred as the " <unk> of darkness " , magical beings created by Occuria with great strength and intelligence . Led by Ultima , they eventually rebelled for various reasons and engaged themselves in a war dubbed the Thousand Year War against the gods ; but they were eventually defeated . Consequently , the gods bound their existence with the Glyph of the Beast , trapping them within the Mist . Any who controls the Glyph in turn controls the Scion , allowing them to operate as summoned creatures . The Fourteenth is the legendary swordsman Gilgamesh , who collects the swords of those he defeats in battle . While most fight , few like Cu Sith and the <unk> <unk> offer aid in other ways . Also , the viera job " Summoner " can call and use the powers of mythological gods like Kirin , Shiva , and many others .

 Editorials from the gaming website <unk> outlined several similarities between the Catholic Church and the Church of Glabados portrayed in Final Fantasy Tactics . One editorial noted that it was a controversial move by the developers , as if the church institution " in fact worships a demon , and is evil from its god on down " . However , another editorial mentions that such controversies failed to recognize the church in question is the medieval Roman Catholic Church , and that historically such institution is known for its flaws in the past . 
 The Ivalice of Final Fantasy XII is considered a Japanese take on the Star Wars galaxy by a GameSpot reviewer ( in turn , Star Wars was considered an American take on Japanese jidaigeki samurai films , specifically Akira Kurosawa 's The Hidden Fortress ) . Even with the established fantasy setting , the airships and air battles gives the world a science @-@ fiction feel . Adding to the " galaxy far , far away " mood is the mingling of different races within large cities and the political unrest between the rebellion and the Empire . Because the characters primarily traverse on foot , the world of Final Fantasy XII feels vast , and reviewers enjoyed sightseeing because of the impressive visuals . 
 Eurogamer praised the " beautiful architecture and interaction of the various races " in Final Fantasy XII and noted that there was a " melancholy feeling " to " wandering the barren wastes " of Ivalice . In their review of Final Fantasy Tactics , IGN called the battle areas " extremely well designed and detailed to perfection " , singling out the churches as especially beautiful . GameSpot was similarly impressed with the wide varieties of " beautiful " terrains to be seen in Ivalice , from swamps to castles to " anything else you can think of " . <unk> praised the feel of Lea Monde in Vagrant Story , calling it " excellently lit " in a style that brought out the " dark and moody " feeling of the game . They went on to say that the game 's " great visual presentation will go down in the books as one of the best looking [ PlayStation ] games " . 
 = Westcott railway station = 
 Westcott railway station was a small station built to serve the village of Westcott , Buckinghamshire and nearby buildings attached to Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild 's estate at Waddesdon Manor . It was built by the Duke of Buckingham in 1871 as part of a short horse @-@ drawn tramway to allow for the transport of goods from and around his extensive estates in Buckinghamshire and to connect the Duke 's estates to the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway at Quainton Road . A lobbying campaign by residents of the town of Brill led to the tramway being converted for passenger use and extended to Brill railway station in 1872 , becoming known as the Brill Tramway . 
 Cheaply built and ungraded , and using poor quality locomotives , services on the line were very slow , initially limited to 5 miles per hour ( 8 km / h ) . In the 1890s it was planned to extend the tramway to Oxford , but the scheme was abandoned . Instead , the operation of the line was taken over by the Metropolitan Railway in 1899 . 
 Following the 1933 transfer of the Metropolitan Railway to public ownership to become the Metropolitan line of London Transport , Westcott station became a part of the London Underground , despite being over 40 miles ( 60 km ) from central London . The management of London Transport believed it very unlikely that the line could ever be made viable , and Westcott station was closed , along with the rest of the line , from 30 November 1935 . The station building and its associated house are the only significant buildings from the Brill Tramway to survive other than the former junction station at Quainton Road . 
 = = Brill Tramway = = 
 On 23 September 1868 the small Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway ( A & BR ) opened , linking the Great Western Railway 's station at Aylesbury to the London and North Western Railway 's Oxford to Bletchley line at Verney Junction . On 1 September 1894 London 's Metropolitan Railway ( MR ) reached Aylesbury , and shortly afterwards connected to the A & BR line , with local MR services running to Verney Junction from 1 April 1894 . Through trains from the MR 's London terminus at Baker Street commenced on 1 January 1897 . 
 Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple @-@ Nugent @-@ Brydges @-@ Chandos @-@ Grenville , 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos , had long had an interest in railways , and had served as Chairman of the London and North Western Railway from 1852 to 1861 . In the early 1870s he decided to build a light railway to carry freight from his estates in Buckinghamshire to the A & BR 's line at Quainton Road . The first stage of the line , known as the Wotton Tramway , was a 4 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) line from Quainton Road via Wotton to a coal siding at Kingswood , and opened on 1 April 1871 . Intended for use by horse trams , the line was built with longitudinal sleepers to avoid horses tripping on the sleepers . 
 Lobbying from the nearby town of Brill for the introduction of passenger services on the line led to an extension from Wotton to Brill railway station , at the foot of Brill Hill 3 ⁄ 4 of a mile ( 1 @.@ 2 km ) from the hilltop town of Brill itself , in the summer of 1872 and the introduction of two mixed trains each day in each direction , at which time the line was renamed the Brill Tramway . The Duke bought two Aveling and Porter traction engines modified to work as locomotives for the line , each with a top speed of 8 miles per hour ( 13 km / h ) , although a speed limit of 5 miles per hour ( 8 km / h ) was enforced . 
 The Duke died in 1889 , and in 1894 the trustees of his estate set up the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company ( O & ATC ) with the intention of extending the line from Brill to Oxford . The MR leased the Brill Tramway from 1 December 1899 , although the line continued to be owned by the O & ATC . 
 = = Services and facilities = = 
 Westcott station was the second station from Quainton Road , about 1 1 ⁄ 2 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) east of Quainton Road . The station consisted of a single platform with a small wooden station building , and was immediately south of the village of Westcott , which at the time of the railway 's opening had a population of about 150 . Initially named " Westcott Siding " , the station was renamed " Westcott " shortly after opening . The station was initially built with a single low wooden platform , primarily intended for loading and unloading freight . After the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway , the MR introduced a single Brown Marshall passenger carriage on the line ; at this time , a short section of platform was raised to conventional height to allow access to the higher doors on the new carriage . 
 Limited by poor quality locomotives and the bumpy , cheaply laid track which followed the contours of the hills , trains ran very slowly in the area ; in 1882 trains took 20 minutes to travel the short distance from Quainton Road to Westcott , and 50 minutes from Westcott to Brill . 
 From 1872 to 1894 Westcott station was served by two passenger trains per day in each direction , and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day . Following the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway , the station was served by four trains per day in each direction until closure in 1935 . Improvements to the line carried out at the time of the transfer to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad reduced journey times from Westcott to Quainton Road and Brill to 13 minutes and 28 minutes respectively . 
 Passenger trains generally served the station only on weekdays , although between 1903 and 1922 trains also ran on Sundays . While the village of Westcott was small , the proximity of Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild 's estate at Waddesdon Manor made Westcott one of the busier stations on the branch in terms of passenger and goods traffic . 
 Despite the low frequency of service and relatively low numbers of people using the station , Westcott station was staffed ; the single employee 's responsibilities included maintaining the oil lamps on the platform and working a nearby level crossing gate . As with all employees on the line , staff at the station were contractually obliged to " devote themselves exclusively to the service , attend regularly during the appointed hours and to refrain from using improper language , cursing or swearing " . The single member of staff was provided with a house immediately adjacent to the station ; built by the Duke of Buckingham , the house bears the inscription " B & C " ( Buckingham & Chandos ) . 
 A small gasworks a short distance to the south of Westcott station opened in 1889 to provide power to Waddesdon Manor and to other buildings on the Rothschild 's estate . A short spur line was built from Westcott station to the gasworks , running immediately parallel to the road south from Westcott village . In 1926 the gasworks closed and was replaced by an electrical generator elsewhere on the Waddesdon Manor grounds , and the track of the spur was removed .

 On 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan Railway , along with London 's other underground railways aside from the small Waterloo & City Railway , was taken into public ownership as part of the newly formed London Passenger Transport Board ( LPTB ) . As a consequence , despite it being 43 miles ( 69 km ) from the City of London , Westcott station became part of the London Underground network . The Brill Tramway was by this time losing significant sums of money . Goods traffic had dwindled , and unlike other areas served by the former Metropolitan Railway , passenger numbers were low ; in 1932 Westcott station saw only 1 @,@ 560 passengers and had made only £ 27 ( about £ 1 @,@ 700 in 2016 ) in passenger receipts . 
 Frank Pick , Managing Director of the Underground Group from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB , saw the lines beyond Aylesbury to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes , concluding that over £ 2000 ( about £ 130 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) would be saved simply by closing the Brill Tramway . As a consequence , the LPTB decided to abandon all passenger services beyond Aylesbury . The Brill Tramway was closed on 1 December 1935 , with the last trains running on 30 November . 
 = = After closure = = 
 Upon the withdrawal of London Transport services the lease expired and the railway and stations reverted to the control of the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company . With no funds and no rolling stock of its own the O & ATC was unable to operate the line , and on 2 April 1936 the entire infrastructure of the line was sold at auction . The cheapest of the 53 lots sold were the Westcott station sign and the oil lamps from the Westcott level crossing , both of which sold for one shilling . The railway house at Westcott was also sold , fetching £ 305 ( about £ 18 @,@ 700 in 2016 ) . 
 Metropolitan line trains ceased to run north of Aylesbury from 6 July 1936 . London and North Eastern Railway services ( British Rail from 1948 ) continued to run from London 's Marylebone station over the line to Verney Junction via Quainton Road until March 1963 . No trace of the line at Westcott remains , but the station building remains in place in the back garden of the former station house , now a private residence , and carries an exact replica of its original " Westcott " station sign . Aside from the junction station at Quainton Road , now preserved as the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre , the two buildings at Westcott are the only significant buildings associated with the Brill Tramway to have survived . 
 = Hurricane Kate ( 1985 ) = 
 Hurricane Kate was the final in a series of tropical cyclones to impact the United States during 1985 and the latest in any calendar year to strike the country at hurricane intensity on record . The eleventh named storm , seventh hurricane , and third major hurricane of the annual hurricane season , Kate originated from the interaction of an upper @-@ level trough and tropical wave northeast of Puerto Rico on November 15 . Though the system tracked erratically during the first hours of its existence , the intensification of a region of high pressure to the cyclone 's north caused Kate to turn westward . A favorable atmospheric pattern allowed the newly developed system to intensify to hurricane intensity on November 16 , and further to Category 2 intensity three days later . Kate made its first landfall on the northern coast of Cuba at this intensity prior to emerging as a slightly weaker storm during the evening hours of November 19 . Once clear of land , it began to strengthen quickly , becoming a Category 3 and reaching its peak intensity of 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) the following day . On November 21 , a cold front moving across the Mississippi Valley resulted in a north and eventual northeast turn of the cyclone , and Kate came ashore near Mexico Beach , Florida , as a minimal Category 2 hurricane with winds of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . Gradual weakening ensued as the cyclone moved along the Southeast United States coastline , and Kate transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on November 23 , a day after exiting the coastline of North Carolina . 
 The threat of Hurricane Kate in Cuba prompted the evacuation of 360 @,@ 000 people . Heavy rainfall in Cuba caused numerous mudslides and flooding , killing 10 people and leading to severe agriculture damage . Wind gusts over hurricane intensity resulted in widespread power outages , significant building damage , and major crop damage . Damage totaled roughly $ 400 million , making it the most damaging hurricane to strike the island in many decades . In preparation of the system , many hurricane watches and warnings were put into effect . Hundreds of thousands of residents were evacuated , and the governor of Florida declared a state of emergency for six counties in Florida ; this was later relinquished following the relatively minor impacts of Kate . In addition , many shelters were opened . When Kate struck the Florida Panhandle , it became the first hurricane to make landfall in that location since Hurricane Eloise in 1975 . Storm surge and flooding rains destroyed much of the oyster industry , causing many people to lose their jobs in the weeks after the storm . Gusts over 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) contributed to downed trees and building damage , while a combination of the wind and rain led to downed power poles . Across the remainder of the Southeast United States , several inches of rainfall led to flash flooding , damage to roadways , and major tree damage . Overall , Kate resulted in 15 fatalities and $ 700 million in damage . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Before the formation of Hurricane Kate , a ridge was located across the southeastern United States for much of the autumn of 1985 ; concurrently , a major trough persisted across the western portion of the country . As a result , weather conditions across the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic Ocean in November were more typical of the pattern in late September , including sea surface temperatures of 81 ° F ( 27 ° C ) . On November 13 , a weak tropical wave began interacting with a trough to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles . It gradually organized due to the favorable conditions , and on November 15 , a Hurricane Hunters flight into the area indicated the development of a tropical cyclone . As gale force winds were already present , the system was immediately declared Tropical Storm Kate , about 240 miles ( 385 km ) northeast of San Juan , Puerto Rico . 
 With a ridge to its north , Kate tracked westward after developing , and an upper @-@ level low developed to the southwest of the storm . The combination of the two provided favorable outflow , allowing Kate to quickly intensify . On November 16 , the storm attained hurricane status while moving through the southeastern Bahamas . After continued strengthening , Kate made landfall at 0600 UTC on November 19 over north @-@ central Cuba with a well @-@ defined eye . When it moved ashore , Kate had a pressure of 967 mbar ( 28 @.@ 6 inHg ) and winds of about 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) . The hurricane maintained its well @-@ defined eye while moving across northern Cuba , and about 12 hours after making landfall , it emerged into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico just east of Havana . Over the next 24 hours , Kate re @-@ intensified off the southwest coast of Florida as it passed about 85 mi ( 135 km ) southwest of Key West . On November 20 , the Hurricane Hunters observed winds as strong as 125 mph ( 200 km / h ) , and a buoy recorded a gust of 136 mph ( 219 km / h ) ; this was the highest recorded wind gust from a buoy in the Gulf of Mexico until Hurricane Lili in 2002 . Based on these observations , it was estimated that Kate attained peak winds of about 120 mph ( 190 km / h ) around 1200 UTC on November 20 . 
 Hurricane Kate maintained peak intensity for about 18 hours . On November 21 , a cold front moving through the Mississippi Valley deflected the hurricane to the north and northeast . The combination of cooler waters and wind shear from the front weakened Kate to an intensity of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) by the time the hurricane struck Crooked Island near Mexico Beach , Florida late on November 21 . After landfall , Kate continued to the northeast , crossing into Georgia and weakened into a tropical storm . Kate emerged from North Carolina into the Atlantic Ocean late on November 22 . Encountering even colder waters and continued shear , the storm weakened further while turning to the east @-@ southeast . On November 23 , Kate transitioned into an extratropical cyclone to the west of Bermuda , terminating at 1800 UTC that day . 
 Until 2011 , Kate 's was considered the second @-@ latest hurricane landfall in the United States , behind only a cyclone in 1925 that struck on December 1 ; however , a systematic reanalysis indicated the 1925 system was only a tropical storm . In turn , Kate took the record . With Kate 's landfall , the 1985 season had six hurricanes that struck the United States , only one short of the record seven in 1886 .

 By November 18 , a hurricane warning was in effect for the southeast and central Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands . Flood warnings were issued for northern Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic . In preparation for the hurricane 's arrival , officials forced 360 @,@ 000 people to evacuate in north @-@ central Cuba . 
 While Kate was moving through the Bahamas , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) issued a hurricane warning from Jupiter to Fort Myers , Florida , including the Florida Keys . Then @-@ Governor of Florida Bob Graham declared a state of emergency for six counties in South Florida . However , it was reversed following the relatively minor effects in South Florida . Officials recommended evacuation of the Florida Keys , leading to heavy traffic on the Overseas Highway and prompting the Red Cross to open 12 shelters . Three shelters were opened in Key West , but only 500 sought individuals utilized them during the storm . Most residents chose to endure the storm in their homes . In Fort Lauderdale , schools were closed and residents of mobile homes were required to leave . 
 Shortly after the storm reached its peak intensity on November 20 , the NHC issued a hurricane watch from Grand Isle , Louisiana , to Cedar Key , Florida . Later that day , a portion of the watch area was upgraded to a warning from Bay St. Louis , Mississippi to St. Marks , Florida . About 20 @,@ 000 employees on oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico were evacuated , many by helicopter . The USS Lexington left port from Naval Air Station Pensacola to ride out the storm in open waters , and aircraft in the region were flown inland . About 100 @,@ 000 people along the Florida Panhandle were told to leave their houses after Governor Bob Graham issued evacuation orders in 13 counties . About 2 @,@ 000 people stayed in 34 shelters in Panama City . Roads in the region suffered traffic jams from the large volume of evacuees . Portions of the Florida Gulf Coast were threatened by Hurricane Elena earlier in the season , and some evacuees of that storm intended not to leave during Kate due to the poor shelter conditions they had experienced . Governor Graham activated 300 members of the Florida National Guard to prevent looting and to assist in evacuations . One person died from a stress @-@ induced heart attack in Chipley after evacuating . Outside of Florida , about 2 @,@ 200 people fled Grand Isle , Louisiana . 
 After Kate moved ashore , the NHC issued gale warnings along the East Coast of the United States from St. Augustine , Florida to Chincoteague , Virginia .

 Early in its duration , Hurricane Kate sank one boat near Puerto Rico and disabled three others . The crew of five on the sunken boat were rescued after 17 hours . Several homes in northern Puerto Rico were damaged , forcing hundreds to evacuate . Flooding was also reported in Dominican Republic , including around the capital Santo Domingo . 
 Heavy rainfall and winds up to 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) were reported in the Turks and Caicos Islands . In Jamaica , heavy precipitation caused mudslides , which in turn blocked 23 major and minor roads and destroyed many bridges , culverts , and drains . Flooding in general caused severe damage to agriculture , especially in Clarendon , Manchester , Saint Ann , Saint Elizabeth , and Trelawny Parishes . Seven fatalities were reported , while the cost to repair damage was approximately $ 3 million ( 1985 USD ) . 
 As Kate moved across northern Cuba , it produced strong winds that peaked at 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) in Sagua La Grande . Wind gusts peaked at 104 mph ( 167 km / h ) in Varadero , and winds in the capital of Havana reached 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . In Havana , high winds caused power outages and destroyed buildings . Waves of 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) affected the city 's waterfront . Outside of Havana , the hurricane damaged sugar mills and much of the sugar cane crop ; throughout the island , the winds destroyed 3 @,@ 653 <unk> ( 9461 km2 ) of sugar cane and 34 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 37 @,@ 000 tons ) of sugar .

Rainfall totals in southwest Florida were generally around 1 in ( 25 mm ) , although Key West reported 2 @.@ 08 in ( 53 mm ) of precipitation . High winds downed trees and power lines , leaving areas between Key West and Big Pine Key without power . Electrical outages contributed to a mobile home being destroyed by fire , and one person died through electrocution . Above @-@ normal tides caused minor flooding and erosion along the Florida Keys . Two people died after their boat capsized in the lower Keys . 
 Kate was the first hurricane to make landfall in the Florida Panhandle since Hurricane Eloise in 1975 . In the region , the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall along its path , peaking at 8 @.@ 32 in ( 211 mm ) in Panama City . While Kate moved ashore , it produced an 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) storm surge at Cape San Blas , causing beach and dune erosion in Gulf County . Storm surge flooding left 150 houses uninhabitable in Wakulla County . The hurricane damaged a bridge to St. George Island that had been rebuilt after Hurricane Elena , and large portions of U.S. Routes 90 and 98 were washed out or damaged . Just two months after Elena ravaged the Apalachicola Bay shellfish harvesting industry , Hurricane Kate destroyed remaining oyster beds , leaving many oystermen in the area without jobs . 
 Strong winds buffeted the Florida Panhandle , accompanied by one tornado and several funnel clouds . In Panama City , wind gusts reached 78 mph ( 126 km / h ) , damaging two houses , a motel , and a fishing pier . The winds were strong enough to remove the roof of a two @-@ story federal building . Sustained winds blew 74 mph ( 119 km / h ) at Cape San Blas , with gusts up to 108 mph ( 174 km / h ) . Across the area , Kate severely damaged 242 buildings , mostly in Franklin County , where the storm ranked as the most devastating of the late 1900s . The storm compromised about 5 @.@ 4 mi ( 8 @.@ 7 km ) of roads in the county , and throughout the region many roads were washed out . The intense winds brought down numerous trees , some of them onto adjacent structures . One fallen tree struck a car , killing one person and injuring another . The winds also downed power poles and lines . About 90 percent of Florida 's capital city Tallahassee , or about 80 @,@ 000 people , lost power , and along the coast from Panama City to Apalachicola , the storm left about 30 @,@ 000 homes and businesses without electricity . Overall , the hurricane destroyed 325 homes along the panhandle , and about 500 buildings were severely damaged .

 Light rainfall of around 1 in ( 25 mm ) from the hurricane extended into southeastern Alabama . Rainfall was much heavier in Georgia , peaking at 7 @.@ 73 in ( 196 mm ) in Bainbridge . Portions of southwestern Georgia experienced heavy damage from flash flooding and winds , and several secondary roads were washed out . Gusts of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) downed thousands of trees , and one fallen tree killed a man west of Thomasville . The cotton , soybean , and pecan crops suffered heavy losses , estimated at around $ 50 million . Property and utility damage was also assessed at $ 50 million , and damage from flash flooding was estimated at $ 1 million . There were scattered power outages in southern Georgia , affecting fewer than 3 @,@ 000 customers by Georgia Power Company 's estimation . While Kate was moving across southeastern Georgia , it produced a 62 mph ( 100 km / h ) wind gust in Savannah . The city also reported 1 @.@ 73 in ( 44 mm ) of rainfall . 
 Further northeast , Charleston , South Carolina reported a wind gust of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . The highest rainfall total in the state was 6 @.@ 56 in ( 167 mm ) in Hampton . The rains caused flash flooding that washed out secondary roads and a bridge . The storm knocked tree limbs onto power lines , which left about 48 @,@ 000 people without power . In Beaufort , trees fell onto four cars and a mobile home , and high waves sunk a boat . In Wilmington , North Carolina , the storm dropped 1 @.@ 99 in ( 51 mm ) of precipitation . Rains across the state caused generally minor flooding , although several cars were swept off roadways . Rising floodwaters prompted the evacuation of a nursing home in <unk> . Rainfall extended northward into Virginia . Damage throughout the United States was estimated at $ 300 million . 
 As an extratropical cyclone , Kate moved north of Bermuda and produced wind gusts of 26 mph ( 42 km / h ) on the island .

 In the month after Hurricane Kate struck the island , the government of Cuba issued a request to the United Nations ( UN ) World Food Council for international assistance . In response , various UN member nations collectively provided $ 60 @,@ 000 for pesticides ; $ 250 @,@ 000 for herbicides , fungicides , and potato seeds ; and $ 1 @.@ 381 million in cooking oils and beans to fulfill the dietary needs of over 475 @,@ 000 people for 60 days . The Soviet Union also donated about $ 15 million worth of rice and wheat flour . 
 Hurricane Kate delayed a runoff mayoral election in Key West by two weeks . Shortly after the storm , the police departments of both Leon and Jackson Counties ordered a nightly curfew . Two disaster relief centers were opened in Franklin County , one in Apalachicola and the other in Eastpoint . On December 3 , 1985 , then @-@ President of the United States Ronald Reagan declared seven Florida counties as disaster areas , making them eligible to receive federal aid . 
 Due to the widespread power outages along the Florida Panhandle , electrical companies enlisted extra workers to repair downed lines . Officials had put a curfew in place for Tallahassee due to power outages created by the hurricane , and the curfew was lifted on November 24 after power was gradually restored and roads were cleared of debris . Police officers in the city arrested 20 people for violating curfew or creating unrest . 
 Some sections of coastline already suffering from severe erosion lost additional swaths of beach to a 10 @-@ foot ( 3 m ) storm surge and strong waves . Many fishermen before and after the storm encountered diminished fish catches after the hurricane . 
 = Kauri gum = 
 Kauri gum is a fossilized resin detracted from kauri trees ( Agathis australis ) , which is made into crafts such as jewellery . Kauri forests once covered much of the North Island of New Zealand , before Māori and European settlers caused deforestation , causing several areas to revert to sand dunes , scrubs , and swamps . Even afterward , ancient kauri fields continued to provide a source for the gum and the remaining forests . 
 Kauri gum formed when resin from a kauri trees leaked out through fractures or cracks in the bark , hardening with the exposure to air . Lumps commonly fell to the ground and became covered with soil and forest litter , eventually <unk> . Other lumps formed as branches forked or trees were damaged , which released the resin . 
 = = Uses = = 
 The Māori had many uses for the gum , which they called <unk> . Fresh gum was used as a type of chewing gum ( older gum was softened by soaking and mixing with juice of the <unk> thistle ) . Highly flammable , the gum was also used as a fire @-@ starter , or bound in flax to act as a torch . Burnt and mixed with animal fat , it made a dark pigment for moko tattooing . Kauri gum was also crafted into jewellery , keepsakes , and small decorative items . Like amber , kauri gum sometimes includes insects and plant material . 
 Kauri gum was used commercially in varnish , and can be considered a type of copal ( the name given to resin used in such a way ) . Kauri gum was found to be particularly good for this , and from the mid @-@ 1840s was exported to London and America . Tentative exports had begun a few years earlier , however , for use in marine glue and as fire @-@ <unk> ; gum had even made up part of an export cargo to Australia in 1814 . 
 Since the kauri gum was found to mix more easily with linseed oil , at lower temperatures , than other resins , by the 1890s , 70 percent of all oil varnishes made in England used kauri gum . It was used to a limited extent in paints during the late 19th century , and from 1910 was used extensively in the manufacture of linoleum . From the 1930s , the market for gum dropped as synthetic alternatives were found , but there remained niche uses for the gum in jewellery and specialist high @-@ grade varnish for violins . 
 Kauri gum was Auckland 's main export in the second half of the 19th century , sustaining much of the early growth of the city . Between 1850 and 1950 , 450 @,@ 000 tons of gum were exported . The peak in the gum market was 1899 , with 11 @,@ 116 tons exported that year , with a value of £ 600 @,@ 000 ( $ 989 @,@ 700 ) . The average annual export was over 5 @,@ 000 tons , with the average price gained £ 63 ( $ 103 @.@ 91 ) per ton . 
 = = Appearance = = 
 The gum varied in color depending on the condition of the original tree . It also depended on where the gum had formed and how long it had been buried . Colors ranged from chalky @-@ white , through red @-@ brown to black ; the most prized was a pale gold , as it was hard and translucent . The size of each lump also varied greatly . Swamps tended to yield the small nuggets known as " chips " , whereas the hillsides tended to produce larger lumps . The majority were the size of acorns , although some were found which weighed a few pounds ; the largest ( and rarest ) were reported to weigh half a hundredweight . Kauri gum shares a few characteristics with amber , another fossilised resin found in the Northern Hemisphere , but where amber can be dated as millions of year old , carbon @-@ dating suggests the age of most kauri gum is a few thousand years . 
 = = <unk> = = 
 Most of the gumfields were in Northland , Coromandel and Auckland , the site of the original kauri forests . Initially , the gum was readily accessible , commonly found lying on the ground . Captain Cook reported the presence of resinous lumps on the beach at Mercury Bay , Coromandel , in 1769 , although he suspected it came from the mangroves , and missionary Samuel Marsden spoke of their presence in Northland in 1819 . 
 By 1850 , most of the surface @-@ lying gum had been picked up , and people began digging for it . The hillsides yielded shallow @-@ buried gum ( about 1 m ) , but in the swamps and beaches , it was buried much further down ( 4 m or below ) . 
 = = Gum @-@ diggers = = 
 Gum @-@ diggers were men and women who dug for kauri gum , a fossilised resin , in the old kauri fields of New Zealand at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries . The gum was used mainly for varnish . The term may be a source for the nickname " Digger " given to New Zealand soldiers in World War I. In 1898 , a gum @-@ digger described " the life of a gum @-@ digger " as " wretched , and one of the last [ occupations ] a man would take to . " 
 Gum @-@ diggers worked in the old kauri fields , most of which were then covered by swamp or scrub , digging for the gum . Much of the population was transient , moving from field to field , and they lived in rough huts or tents ( which were called " <unk> " , after the Maori for ' house ' ) . It was extremely hard work and not very well paid , but it attracted many Maori and European settlers , including women and children . There were many Dalmatians , who had first come to work the South Island goldfields in the 1860s . They were transient workers , rather than settlers , and much of their income was sent out of the country , resulting in much resentment from the local workforce . In 1898 , the " Kauri Gum Industry Act " was passed , which reserved gum @-@ grounds for British subjects , and requiring all other diggers to be licensed . By 1910 , only British subjects could hold gum @-@ digging licences . 
 Gum @-@ digging was the major source of income for settlers in Northland , and farmers often worked the gumfields in the winter months to subsidise the poor income from their unbroken land . By the 1890s , 20 @,@ 000 people were engaged in gum @-@ digging , of which 7000 worked full @-@ time . Gum @-@ digging was not restricted to settlers or workers in the rural areas ; Auckland families would cross the Waitemata Harbour by ferry at weekends to dig in the fields around Birkenhead , causing damage to public roads and private farms , and leading to local council management of the problem . 
 = = = <unk> methods = = = 
 Most gum was dug from the ground using gum @-@ spears ( pointed rods to probe for gum ) and " <unk> " , defined as blade @-@ edged spades for cutting through old wood and roots as well as soil . Once the gum was retrieved it would need to be scraped and cleaned . 
 Digging in swamps was more complicated ; a longer spear ( up to 8m ) was often used , often fitted with a hooked end to scoop out the lumps . Scrub was often cleared first with fire ; some got out of control and swamp fires could burn for weeks . Holes were often dug by teams in both hills and swamps — often up to 12m deep — and some wetlands were drained to aid in the excavation of gum . As field gum became scarce , " bush gum " was obtained by purposely cutting the bark of kauri trees and returning months later to retrieve the hardened resin . Due to the damage caused to the trees by the cutting the practice was banned in state forests in 1905 . Gum chips , small lumps useful for the manufacture of linoleum , were difficult to find , and by 1910 , the process of washing and sieving to retrieve the chips became common . The process was later mechanised . 
 = = Gum merchants = = 
 <unk> generally sold their gum to local <unk> , who transported it to Auckland ( generally by sea ) for sale to merchants and exporters . There were six major export firms in Auckland who dealt in gum , employing several hundred workers who graded and <unk> the gum for export , packing them in cases made from kauri timber . 
 As early as the 1830s and 1840s , merchants , including Gilbert Mair and Logan Campbell , were buying gum from local Māori for £ 5 ( $ 8 @.@ 25 ) a ton , or trading it for goods . The majority of the gum was exported to America and London ( from whence it was distributed throughout Europe ) , although smaller amounts were sent to Australia , Hong Kong , Japan and Russia . 
 = Council of Lithuania = 
 The Council of Lithuania ( Lithuanian : Lietuvos <unk> , German : <unk> Staatsrat , Polish : Rada <unk> ) , after July 11 , 1918 The State Council of Lithuania ( Lithuanian : Lietuvos Valstybės <unk> ) , was convened at the Vilnius Conference that took place between 18 and 23 September 1917 . The twenty men initially composing the council were of different ages , social status , professions , and political affiliations . The council was granted the executive authority of the Lithuanian people and was entrusted to establish an independent Lithuanian state . On 16 February 1918 , the members of the council signed the Act of Independence of Lithuania and declared Lithuania an independent state based on democratic principles . 16 February is celebrated as Lithuania 's State Restoration Day . The council managed to establish the proclamation of independence despite the presence of German troops in the country until the autumn of 1918 . By the spring of 1919 , the council had almost doubled in size . The council continued its efforts until the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania ( Lithuanian : <unk> Seimas ) first met on 15 May 1920 . 
 = = Historical background and Vilnius Conference = = 
 After the last Partition of the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795 , Lithuania had become part of the Russian Empire . During the 19th century , both the Poles and the Lithuanians attempted to restore their independence . They rebelled during the November Uprising in 1830 and the January Uprising in 1863 , but the first realistic opportunity came about during World War I. In 1915 , Germany occupied Lithuania as its troops marched towards Russia . After the Russian Revolution in 1917 , opportunities for independence opened up . Germany , avoiding direct annexation , tried to find a middle path that would involve some kind of union with Germany . In the light of upcoming peace negotiations with Russia , the Germans agreed to allow the Vilnius Conference , hoping that it would proclaim that the Lithuanian nation wanted to be detached from Russia and wished for a closer relationship with Germany . However , the conference , held between 18 and 23 September 1917 , adopted a resolution that an independent Lithuania should be established and that a closer relationship with Germany would depend on whether it recognized the new state . On 21 September , the attendees at the conference elected a 20 @-@ member Council of Lithuania to establish this resolution . The German authorities did not allow that resolution to be published , but they did permit the council to proceed . The authorities censored the council 's newspaper , Lietuvos <unk> ( Echo of Lithuania ) , preventing the council from reaching a wider public audience . The Conference also resolved that a constituent assembly be elected " in conformity with democratic principles by all the inhabitants of Lithuania " . 
 = = Membership = = 
 The twenty men initially composing the council were of different ages ( the youngest was 25 ; the oldest 66 ) , social status , professions , and political affiliations . There were eight lawyers , four priests , three <unk> , two financiers , a doctor , a publisher , and an engineer . Eight of the members were Christian democrats and seven were not affiliated . All except one had gained degrees in tertiary education . The council 's last surviving member , Aleksandras Stulginskis , died in September 1969 . 
 During the first meeting on September 24 , Antanas Smetona was elected as the chairman of the council . The chairman , two vice @-@ chairmen , and two secretaries made up the presidium . The vice @-@ chairs and secretaries would change from time to time , but Smetona retained the chairmanship until 1919 when he was elected the first President of Lithuania . Smetona was succeeded by Stasys <unk> as the chairman . He was not among the original twenty members . The first change in membership took place on 13 July 1918 , when six new members ( <unk> <unk> , Augustinas Voldemaras , Juozas <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Jurgis <unk> and Stasys <unk> ) were admitted and four ( Kairys , Vileišis , Biržiška , <unk> ) resigned . By the spring of 1919 , the council had almost doubled in size . 
 = = Declaration of Independence = = 
 Soon after the council was elected , major developments took place in Russia . The October Revolution brought the Bolsheviks to power . They signed a truce with Germany on December 2 , 1917 and started peace negotiations . Germany needed some documentation of its relationship with Lithuania . In the so @-@ called Berlin Protocol Germany offered to recognize Lithuanian independence if the latter agreed to form a firm and permanent federation with Germany , based on conventions concerning military affairs , transportation , customs , and currency . The council agreed , on condition that Lithuania would decide its own internal affairs and foreign policy . The Germans rejected this proposal . On December 11 , the council adopted a resolution agreeing to a " firm and permanent alliance " with Germany on the basis of the four conventions . Only fifteen members voted for this resolution , but all twenty signed it . 
 The Germans broke their promise and did not recognize the state and did not invite its delegation to the negotiations of Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk . Lithuanians , including those living abroad , disapproved of the December 11 declaration . The declaration , seen as pro @-@ German , was an obstacle in establishing diplomatic relations with England , France and the United States , the enemies of Germany . On January 8 , the same day that Woodrow Wilson announced his Fourteen Points , the council proposed amendments to the declaration of December 11 calling for a constituent assembly . The amendments were rejected by the Germans and it was made clear that the council would serve only advisory functions . The council was torn apart and a few members threatened to leave . On February 16 , the council , temporarily chaired by Jonas Basanavičius , decided to re @-@ declare independence , this time mentioning nothing specific about a relationship with Germany . That was left for a constituent assembly to decide . February 16 is celebrated as Lithuania 's State Restoration Day . 
 = = Establishing independence = = 
 The Germans were not satisfied with the new declaration and demanded that the council go back to the December 11 decision . On March 3 , Germany and Bolshevik Russia signed the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk . It declared that the Baltic nations were in the German interest zone and that Russia renounced any claims to them . On March 23 , Germany recognized independent Lithuania on the basis of the December 11 declaration . However , nothing in essence changed either in Lithuania or in Council 's status : any efforts to establish administration were hindered . The form of government , however , was left undecided . Germany , ruled by a <unk> , preferred a monarchy . It proposed a personal union with the Prussian Hohenzollern dynasty . As an alternative , on June 4 the council voted to invite Duke Wilhelm of <unk> , Count of Württemberg , to become the monarch of Lithuania . He agreed and was elected King of Lithuania ( Mindaugas II ) on July 13 , 1918 . The decision was very controversial and four members of the council left in protest . 
 Germany did not recognize the new king and its relationship with the council remained tense . The council was not allowed to determine the borders of Lithuania , establish an embassy in Berlin , or begin forming a stable administrative system . It received small funds to cover its expenses only in September 1918 . The situation changed when the German Revolution started and Germany lost the war in fall of 1918 – it was no longer in a position to dictate terms . On November 2 , the council adopted the first provisional constitution . The decision to invite King Mindaugas II was annulled and this helped to reconcile the political factions . The functions of government were entrusted to a three @-@ member presidium , and Augustinas Voldemaras was invited to form the first Cabinet of Ministers . The first government was formed on November 11 , 1918 , the day that Germany signed the armistice in Compiègne . The council began to organize an army , police , local government , and other institutions . It also expanded to include ethnic minorities ( Jews and Belarusians ) . There were no women in the council , despite a petition that gathered 20 @,@ 000 signatures . 
 The Freedom Wars started and political processes were derailed during the turmoil . Lithuanian elections to the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania were not held until April 1920 . The council was not replaced by a parliament ( Seimas ) until August 1 , 1922 , when the Constitution of Lithuania was adopted . 
 = M @-@ 3 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 3 is a north – south state trunkline highway in the Detroit metropolitan area of the US state of Michigan . For most of its length , the trunkline is known as Gratiot Avenue / <unk> / . The trunkline starts in Downtown Detroit and runs through the city in a northeasterly direction along one of Detroit 's five major avenues . The highway passes several historic landmarks and through a historic district . It also connects residential neighborhoods on the city 's east side with suburbs in Macomb County and downtown . 
 Gratiot Avenue in Detroit was one of the original avenues laid out by Judge Augustus Woodward after the Detroit fire in 1805 . It was later used as a supply road for Fort Gratiot in Port Huron under authorization from the US Congress in the 1820s . The roadway was included in the State Trunkline Highway System in 1913 and signposted with a number in 1919 . Later , it was used as a segment of US Highway 25 ( US 25 ) before that highway was functionally replaced by Interstate 94 ( I @-@ 94 ) in the 1960s . The M @-@ 3 designation was applied to the current highway in 1973 , and a southern section was reassigned to M @-@ 85 in 2001 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The southern end of M @-@ 3 is at an intersection between Jefferson Avenue and Randolph Street near the near entrance to the Detroit – Windsor Tunnel , the Mariners ' Church , and the Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit . This intersection also serves as the termini for M @-@ 10 and Business Spur I @-@ 375 ( BS I @-@ 375 ) . M @-@ 3 follows Randolph Street northward under the Detroit People Mover past Cadillac Square . North of Monroe Avenue , the street runs through the Randolph Street Commercial Buildings Historic District before M @-@ 3 crosses under the People Mover again and turns northeasterly along Gratiot Avenue , one of Detroit 's five major thoroughfares . This street is a boulevard setup with four lanes divided with a median or center turn lane . 
 Gratiot Avenue runs northeasterly through downtown , past Ford Field . Near the stadium , the street passes over I @-@ 375 ( Chrysler Freeway ) without any direct connections . On the east side of the freeway , M @-@ 3 runs past the Historic Trinity Lutheran and St. John 's @-@ St. Luke 's Evangelical churches before intersecting the end of the Fisher Freeway , which at this location is an unnumbered connector to I @-@ 75 and I @-@ 375 . Gratiot continues past the freeway on the city 's east side , bordering residential neighborhoods along the way . Through this area , it had a continuous center turn lane , losing the grassy median it had in places downtown . The highway intersects Grand Boulevard near <unk> Park , and at Van Dyke Avenue , it intersects the southern end of M @-@ 53 . Gratiot Avenue crosses I @-@ 94 at the latter 's exit 219 near the Coleman A. Young International Airport and an adjacent industrial area . 
 Past the airport , Gratiot Avenue once again runs through residential neighborhoods while being immediately bordered by commercial properties . The southern end of M @-@ 97 is at the intersection between Gratiot and Gunston avenues just northeast of the Outer Drive junction by the airport . The trunkline passes the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Church near a branch location of the Detroit Public Library at McNichols Street . Just before crossing M @-@ 102 ( 8 Mile Road ) , Gratiot Avenue widens back to a boulevard . This intersection marks the transition from Detroit and Wayne County to Eastpointe in Macomb County . 
 In Macomb County , M @-@ 3 follows a boulevard setup complete with Michigan lefts at the major intersections in the suburbs of Detroit . There are a series of commercial properties between 10 Mile Road and I @-@ 696 ( Reuther Freeway ) that includes the Eastgate Shopping Center in Roseville . Near 13 Mile Road , there is a partial interchange with I @-@ 94 that allows eastbound traffic , which is physically traveling northbound to access northbound M @-@ 3 and southbound M @-@ 3 traffic to access westbound I @-@ 94 . The missing connections are possible through the adjacent interchange for Little Mack Avenue on I @-@ 94 which also connects to 13 Mile Road and Gratiot Avenue . North of 14 Mile Road , M @-@ 3 crosses into Clinton Charter Township next to the Hebrew Memorial Park , a cemetery . 
 North of the intersection with Metropolitan Parkway , Gratiot Avenue splits into a one @-@ way pairing of Northbound and Southbound Gratiot avenues as it crosses into Mount Clemens near the Clinton River . The two separate streets are one , two , or even three blocks apart through the city 's downtown area . North of the Patterson Street intersections , the two streets cross back into Clinton Township and merge back together in four @-@ lane street with a center turn lane . North of M @-@ 59 ( Hall Road ) . M @-@ 3 clips the southeastern corner of Macomb Township near Selfridge Air National Guard Base . The highway continues into Chesterfield Township . M @-@ 3 parts from Gratiot Avenue at the intersection with 23 Mile Road , turning eastward along that roadway to an intersection with I @-@ 94 . At exit 243 , M @-@ 3 terminates at this interchange and 23 Mile Road continues easterly as M @-@ 29 . 
 M @-@ 3 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) like other state highways in Michigan . As a part of these maintenance responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction . These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic , which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway . MDOT 's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M @-@ 3 were the 73 @,@ 957 vehicles daily south of 14 Mile Road in Roseville ; the lowest counts were the 4 @,@ 609 vehicles per day north of Cadillac Square in downtown Detroit . All of M @-@ 3 has been listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 The first trunkline to be designated M @-@ 3 was Schaefer Highway in 1937 , running north – south from US 25 ( Dix Avenue ) in Melvindale to US 16 ( Grand River Avenue ) in western Detroit . Two years later , the highway became M @-@ 39 . Since M @-@ 39 was moved to Southfield Road in the end of the 1950s , Schaefer Highway has been a locally maintained road .

 The chief transportation routes in 1701 were the Indian trails that crossed the future state of Michigan ; the one connecting what are now Detroit and Port Huron was one of these thirteen trails at the time . Detroit created 120 @-@ foot ( 37 m ) rights @-@ of @-@ way for the principle streets of the city , the modern Gratiot Avenue included , in 1805 . This street plan was devised by Augustus Woodward and others following a devastating fire in Detroit . Gratiot Avenue , then also called Detroit – Port Huron Road , was authorized by the US Congress on March 2 , 1827 , as a supply road from Detroit to Port Huron for Fort Gratiot . Construction started in Detroit in 1829 , and the roadway was completed in the same year to Mount Clemens . The rest was finished in 1833 . The road was named for the fort near Port Huron , which was in turn named for Colonel Charles Gratiot , the supervising engineer in charge of construction of the structure in the aftermath of the War of 1812 . 
 On May 13 , 1913 , the Michigan Legislature passed the State Reward Trunk Line Highway Act , which included Gratiot Avenue as part of Division 1 of the initial highway system . When the Michigan State Highway Department signposted the first state highways in 1919 , the trunkline bore the M @-@ 19 designation for its entire length from Detroit to Port Huron . In 1926 , Gratiot Avenue was redesignated as part of US 25 , while the M @-@ 19 designation was relocated westward , connecting Yale with US 25 ( Gratiot Avenue ) just north of 31 Mile Road . In 1963 , the portion of US 25 north of 23 Mile Road was turned over to local control as US 25 was routed over the newly constructed I @-@ 94 freeway , with the exception of the stretch between New Haven and <unk> , which was again designated M @-@ 19 as an extension of that route . Between Hall and 23 Mile roads , Gratiot Avenue was added to an extended M @-@ 59 . 
 M @-@ 3 returned to existence in 1973 , when US 25 , now concurrent with I @-@ 94 and I @-@ 75 for most of its length through Michigan and Ohio , was truncated at Cincinnati . The former US 25 section of Gratiot Avenue was redesignated M @-@ 3 , along with a southwestern extension down Fort Street to Clark Avenue ( I @-@ 75 exit 47A ) . This also provided an international connection via the Ambassador Bridge to Ontario 's Highway 3 . The signs were changed over in February 1974 to complete the change . 
 At the end of 2000 , MDOT proposed several highway transfers in Detroit . Some of these involved transferring city streets in the Campus Martius Park area under the department 's jurisdiction to city control ; another part of the proposal involved MDOT assuming control over a section of Fort Street from the then northern terminus of M @-@ 85 to the then southern terminus of M @-@ 3 at Clark Street . When these transfers were completed the following year , M @-@ 3 was severed into two discontinuous segments by the Campus Marius changes , and the southern segment between Clark and Griswold streets was added to an extended M @-@ 85 .

 The history of Aarhus began as a fortified Viking settlement founded in the 8th century and with the first written records stemming from the bishopric seated here from at least 948 . The city was founded on the northern shores of a fjord at a natural harbour and the primary driver of growth was for centuries seaborne trade in agricultural products . Market town privileges were granted in 1441 , but growth stagnated in the 17th century as the city suffered blockades and bombardments during the Swedish Wars . In the 19th century it was occupied twice by German troops during the Schleswig Wars but avoided destruction . As the industrial revolution took hold , the city grew to become the second @-@ largest in the country by the 20th century . 
 Today Aarhus is at the cultural and economic core of the region and the largest centre for trade , services and industry in Jutland . The city ranks as the 92nd largest city in the European Union , and as number 234 among world cities . It is also a top 100 conference city in the world . Aarhus is the principal industrial port of the country in terms of container handling and an important trade hub in Kattegat . Major Danish companies have based their headquarters here and people commute for work and leisure from a wide area in Region Midtjylland . It is a centre for research and education in the Nordic countries and home to Aarhus University , Scandinavia 's largest university , including Aarhus University Hospital and INCUBA Science Park . Being the Danish city with the youngest demographics , with 48 @,@ 482 inhabitants aged under 18 , Aarhus is also one of the fastest growing Danish cities , with an average growth of 4 @,@ 000 people per annum since 2010 . 
 Aarhus is notable for its musical history . In the 1950s many jazz clubs sprang up around the city , fuelled by the young population . By the 1960s , the music scene diversified into rock and other genres . In the 1970s and 1980s , Aarhus became the centre for Denmark 's rock music fostering many iconic bands such as TV @-@ 2 and Gnags . Aarhus is home to the annual eight @-@ day Aarhus International Jazz Festival , the <unk> Festival and the NorthSide Festival . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 In Valdemar 's Census Book ( 1231 ) the city was called Arus , and in Icelandic it was known as Aros , later written as Aars . It is a compound of the two words <unk> , genitive of ā ( " river " , Modern Danish å ) , and <unk> ( " mouth " , in Modern Icelandic this word is still used for " river delta " ) . The name originates from the city 's location around the mouth of Aarhus Å ( Aarhus River ) . The spelling " Aarhus " is first found in 1406 and gradually became the norm in the 17th century . 
 Aarhus / Århus spelling 
 With the Danish spelling reform of 1948 , " Aa " was changed to " Å " . Some Danish cities resisted the new spelling of their names , notably Aalborg and <unk> . Århus city council explicitly embraced the new spelling , as it was thought to enhance an image of progressiveness . In 2010 , the city council voted to change the name from " Århus " to " Aarhus " in order to strengthen the international profile of the city . The renaming came into effect on 1 January 2011 . 
 Certain geographically affiliated names have been updated to reflect the name of the city , such as the Aarhus River , changed from " Århus Å " to " Aarhus Å " . It is still grammatically correct to write geographical names with the letter Å and local councils are allowed to use the Aa spelling as an alternative . Whichever spelling local authorities choose most newspapers and public institutions will accept it . Some official authorities such as the Danish Language Committee , publisher of the Danish <unk> Dictionary , still retain " Århus " as the main name , providing " Aarhus " as a new , second option , in brackets .

 = = = Early history = = = 
 Founded in the early Viking Age , Aarhus is one of the oldest cities in Denmark , along with Ribe and Hedeby . 
 <unk> evidence under the Aros settlement 's defences indicate the site was a town as early as the last quarter of the 8th century , considerably earlier than had been generally supposed . Discoveries after a 2003 archaeological dig unearthed half - buried longhouses , <unk> , glass pearls and a road dated to the late 700s . Archaeologists have conducted several excavations in the inner city since the 1960s revealing wells , streets , homes and workshops . In the buildings and adjoining archaeological layers , everyday utensils like combs , jewellery and basic multi @-@ purpose tools from approximately the year 900 have been found . 
 The centre of Aarhus was once a pagan burial site until Aarhus ' first church , Holy Trinity Church , a timber structure , was built upon it during the reign of Frode , King of Jutland , around 900 . In the 900s an earth rampart for the defence of the early city was constructed , encircling the settlement , much like the defence structures found at Viking ring fortresses elsewhere . The rampart was later reinforced by Harald Bluetooth , and together with the town 's geographical placement , this suggests that Aros was an important trade and military centre . There are strong indications of a former royal residence from the Viking Age in Viby , a few kilometres south of the Aarhus city centre . 
 The bishopric of Aarhus dates back to at least 948 when Adam of Bremen reported the bishop <unk> attended the synod of Ingelheim in Germany . The bishopric and the town 's geographical location propelled prosperous growth and development of the early medieval town . The finding of six runestones in and around Aarhus indicates the city had some significance around the year 1000 , as only wealthy nobles traditionally used them . The era was turbulent and violent with several naval attacks on the city , such as Harald Hardrada 's assault around 1050 , when the Holy Trinity Church was burned to the ground . 
 = = = Middle Ages = = = 
 The growing influence of the Church during the Middle Ages gradually turned Aarhus , with its bishopric , into a prosperous religious centre . Many public and religious buildings were built in and around the city ; notably Aarhus Cathedral was initiated in the late 12th century by the influential bishop Peder <unk> . In 1441 Christopher III issued the oldest known charter granting market town status although similar privileges may have existed as far back as the 12th century . The charter is the first official recognition of the town as a regional power and is by some considered Aarhus ' birth certificate . 
 The official and religious status spurred growth so in 1477 the defensive earthen ramparts , ringing the town since the Viking age , were abandoned to accommodate expansion . Parts of the ramparts are still in existence today and can be experienced as steep slopes at the riverside and they have also survived in some place names in the inner city , including the streets of <unk> ( The Rampart ) and Graven ( The Ditch ) . Aarhus grew to become one of the largest cities in the country by the early 16th century . In 1657 octroi was imposed in larger Danish cities which changed the layout and face of Aarhus over the following decades . Wooden city walls were erected to prevent smuggling , with gates and toll booths on the major thoroughfares , <unk> and <unk> . The city gates funnelled most traffic through a few streets where merchant quarters were built . 
 In the 17th century , Aarhus entered a period of recession as it suffered blockades and bombardments during the Swedish wars and trade was dampened by the preferential treatment of the capital by the state . It was not until the middle of the 18th century growth returned in large part due to trade with the large agricultural catchment areas around the city ; particularly grain proved to be a remunerative export . The first factories were established at this time as the industrial revolution reached the country and in 1810 the harbour was expanded to accommodate growing trade . 
 = = = Industrialisation = = = 
 Following the Napoleonic wars , Denmark lost Norway and was excluded from international trade for some years which caused a recession for Aarhus ' trade based economy that lasted until the 1830s . The economy turned around as the industrial revolution reached the city and factories with steam @-@ driven machinery became more productive . 
 In 1838 , the electoral laws were reformed leading to elections for the 15 seats on the city council . The rules were initially very strict allowing only the wealthiest citizens to run . In the 1844 elections only 174 citizens qualified out of a total population of more than 7 @,@ 000 . The first city council , mainly composed of wealthy merchants and industrialists , quickly looked to improve the harbour , situated along the Aarhus River . Larger ships and growing freight volumes made a river harbour increasingly impractical . In 1840 , the harbour was moved to the coast , north of the river where it became the largest industrial harbour outside Copenhagen over the following 15 years . From the outset , the new harbour was controlled by the city council , as it is to this day . 
 During the First Schleswig War Aarhus was occupied by German troops from 21 June to 24 July 1849 . The city was spared any fighting , but in <unk> north of the city a cavalry skirmish known as <unk> took place which stopped the German advance through Jutland . The war and occupation left a notable impact on the city as many streets , particularly in Frederiksbjerg , are named after Danish officers of the time . Fifteen years later , in 1864 , the city was occupied again , this time for seven months , during the Second Schleswig War . 
 In spite of wars and occupation the city continued to develop . In 1851 octroi was abolished and the city walls were removed to provide easier access for trade . Regular steamship links with Copenhagen had begun in 1830 and in 1862 Jutland 's first railway was established between Aarhus and Randers .
