 The music video was shot the weekend of January 22 – 24 , 2011 in New York City , and was described by Gaga 's team as a " profound , so inspiring and so incredibly beautiful " video . The video was directed by Nick Knight . Choreographer Laurieann Gibson told MTV News that the video would be " shocking " and one can expect the execution of the highest level of vocal music art and dance . <unk> reported that Gaga spent the first week of February editing the video at the Greenwich Hotel , New York , working during the night as she had to spend the morning rehearsing for her upcoming Grammy Awards performance . Media reports suggested that the singer might play the character of Jo Calderone , the male model she had portrayed in the September issue of Japanese Vogue Hommes . Fernando Garibay explained that the video " is of cultural relevance , and hopefully helps people that are an outcast , bullied . Hopefully makes people aware that it 's OK to be yourself . " According to Gaga , she was inspired by the paintings of Salvador Dalí and Francis Bacon , and their surrealistic images . Gibson explained the inspiration behind the video to MTV News : 
 " When she played it for me , it took me a while to find out the visual interpretation that I could give back to her . And so I woke up one night and I got it , and I said , ' I got it : We have to birth a new race . ' From the gate , Gaga was like , ' I want Nick Knight for this video . I want a visual . ' She was always birthing something visual in her head , and Nick Knight is just , well , he 's prolific but he 's so genius . It was about pushing the bar of what a music video should be and can be . [ ... ] It 's a different time ; it 's a different era ; there are no limits . It is a viral message . I think that there 's something in there for everyone , and that 's what 's so amazing about the video and so specific about the message . " 
 Gibson recalled having to work with Gaga on her dancing in the video , and to make her a better dancer she wanted Gaga to be confident . Gaga chose New York to shoot the video because the city is her birthplace . Before shooting started , Gibson and Gaga decided there was only one place to work on the avant @-@ garde , modern dance routine for the video , Alvin Alley , where Gibson had studied dance . " We rehearsed there because the choreography is really modern @-@ based . It 's , like , more technical than anything she 's ever done , " she recalled . Shooting also took place in Brooklyn for two days . Since Gaga did not want set pictures to be taken before the video was ready , her team had to hide the location and were successful , except at the last day when paparazzi started sneaking around . 
 The video featured full @-@ bodied tattooed model Rick Genest ( Rico ) , better known by his stage name Zombie Boy . Gaga painted her face in a similar way to Genest , in one of the main series of sequences . She said that the sequences displayed the fact that she would not allow society or critics to dictate her sense of beauty . " I tell you what I think is beauty , and hence the scene was of me and Rico defining ourselves in artistic way and not relying on society to dictate it , " she added . The costumes for the video were designed by Formichetti , who blogged about the various designer pieces shown in it . In the opening sequence of the video , Gaga wore a head accessory by Alexis <unk> , a diamond <unk> by Erickson Beamon with earrings by Pamela Love , and a stained @-@ glass dress by Petra Storrs . Finger rings were provided by Erickson Beamon and chiffon clothes by Thierry Mugler . For the skeletons sequences , both she and Rico wore tuxedos by Mugler while the slime during the orgy scenes were courtesy of Bart Hess . For her Michael Jackson impression in the alley at the video 's end , Gaga wore shirt and pants by Haus of Gaga , shoes by Natacha <unk> , a <unk> belt and <unk> gloves .

 Released on Monday , February 28 , 2011 , the video begins with a brief shot of a unicorn 's silhouette in a steam @-@ filled alley , inside a pink triangle frame . The triangle transitions to a shot of Gaga , with two opposite facing heads , inspired by Janus , the Roman god of transition and beginnings , sitting in an ornate glass throne amidst a star @-@ filled space . As Bernard Herrmann 's prelude to the movie Vertigo plays , Gaga tells the story of the creation of an extraterrestrial race that " bears no prejudice , no judgment , but boundless freedom . " Gaga sits in the throne , giving birth to a " new race within the race of humanity . " She explains that this was followed by the birth of evil , due to which Gaga splits into two opposing forces of good and evil . Her new half gives birth to a machine gun and fires it . The prologue concludes with Gaga questioning , " How can I protect something so perfect , without evil ? " 
 Gaga , with shoulder and facial protrusions ( prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants ) walks in a seemingly endless black space , where people are on their hands and knees in an organized pattern . She raises her hand and crouches down to join them . When the first verse begins , everyone dances to choreography . The scenes alternate between the dance , and Gaga singing on her throne in space . In the second verse , Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos , with her face painted to mirror his . Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part . When the chorus plays for the second time , Gaga sings in a room of mirrors , with her head displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted mannequin heads . In the succeeding shots , she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more members of the new race . After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers , they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug . 
 In the video 's conclusion , Gaga 's silhouette struts in an alley in a tribute to Jackson 's " The Way You Make Me Feel " video . Her face is misconstrued , with sharp horns protruding from her face , glowing eyes , uneven hair , and a distinct Madonna @-@ esque gap between her front teeth . Gaga has commented that she was teased as kids would call her " rabbit teeth " . She sheds a single tear as the pink triangle frame appears again , and inside it , a silhouette of Gaga sitting atop the unicorn . A city and a rainbow appear in the background , and Gaga is seen in her zombie makeup , chewing bubble gum and blowing it , as the pink triangle zooms away .

 The music video for " Born This Way " was met with generally positive reception among music critics . James Montgomery of MTV praised the overall creationism concept of the music video , adding that it " sort of makes sense , it sort of doesn 't , but that 100 percent doesn 't really matter much . This is Gaga at her most fabulous , her most out @-@ there , her most , well , Gaga . " In conclusion of his review , he wrote that the fantasy aspects of the video is overshadowed by the overall spectacle , which he believed was analogous to Gaga , " after thoroughly dominating this world with ' Born This Way , ' [ she ] seems content to create brand @-@ new worlds to tower over . " Myrddin Gwynedd of The New Zealand Herald felt that Gaga 's penchant for eccentric and provocative imagery , was extreme in the video . Raphael <unk> from Entertainment Tonight praised the performance of Gaga and her dancers in the video , also complimenting the fashion . Monica Herrera from Billboard noticed that the video bore similarities to the music video of Madonna 's " Vogue " and " Borderline " ( 1984 ) , while believing it to be " more of a high @-@ fashion short film than a conventional music video " . Jim Farber from New York Daily News wanted Gaga to add more humor in her videos , adding that although the video had " joyous " shock value , it definitely lacked creativity . 
 Oscar Moralde from Slant Magazine noted that in the video , " Gaga fully embraces the monstrous as a part of her . " Moralde further explained that previously the singer had acknowledged her role as " Mother Monster " , but never to the visceral , fully embodied extent that she does in the video . " The things that are monstrous , the things that are different — for Gaga , those are the things that are beautiful , " he concluded . Gina Serpe from E ! Online criticized it for being a " Madonna rip @-@ off " , while Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone noted similarities to some of Madonna 's work and the imagery from in the 1927 German expressionist film , Metropolis . Ann Powers from Los Angeles Times noted that the video paid tribute to the Goddess movement and feminism . According to her , with the video Gaga made goddess culture accessible to the mass , by portraying images borrowed from fine art , cinema and cool subcultures . Examples given by her included the portrayal of Rico as her partner , instead of a conventional @-@ looking male or female consort . Powers further added that " Gaga has found a way to place female empowerment at the center of her vision without sacrificing the gains she makes by being a daddy 's girl or a ' boy toy ' . " Megan Powers from Time criticized the video and Gaga 's usage of shock @-@ imagery , which she still found " strange " . The video has been noted for its cultural references and artistic similarities , not only to other recording artists such as Jackson and Madonna , but to Greek and Roman mythology , surrealism and the work of Swiss painter H. R. Giger and late fashion designer Alexander McQueen .

 On the February 9 , 2011 , episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show , singers Justin Bieber and James Blunt performed their own rendition of the song along with DeGeneres , improvising the music , while singing the chorus . During the show , Gaga confirmed via telephone , that she would perform " Born This Way " on February 13 , 2011 , at the 53rd Grammy Awards . Gaga arrived at the ceremony in a giant incubating vessel that was carried onto the red carpet by numerous fashion models . She later emerged from another bigger egg on stage , dressed in a high ponytail , gold bra top and long skirt , with black and gold makeup and pointed shoulders and horns protruding from her face . The " Born This Way " performance was introduced by Ricky Martin . In the first few seconds after performing the intro of the song , Gaga emerged from the egg , and after the first chorus , she whipped her hair in a manner similar to singer Willow Smith . Before the " No matter gay , straight or bi " line of the song , an organ emerged from the stage floor . Gaga played the music on the organ , which was surrounded by mannequin heads submerged in gel , before belting out the rest of the bridge as her dancers surrounded her . Before leaving the stage , Gaga put on her trench and hat as the song faded out and Gaga and her dancers ended the performance with their hands put up in paws . 
 According to Gaga the Grammy performance was inspired by many things , including Gregorian music , Alvin Ailey dance moves and Martha Graham 's dance energy . On The Tonight Show with Jay Leno she explained that Smith inspired her to " whip my hair back and forth on stage , " referring to Smith 's similar named song . Gaga continued that the incubating vessel was meant to signify an artistic statement of birthing a new race with no prejudice . The idea occurred to her when she was in Amsterdam on her tour bus , and was thinking about birth and embryos . She had thought to herself , " Gosh , the thing I hate most about doing award shows is , it can be distracting ... I want to exist only for my fans and for the stage . I don 't want to exist in this machine or this circus that is the industry . I wish I could be encapsulated for three days and just think only about my performance , think only about the album , think only about the future of my fans . So that 's what I did . " Jocelyn Vena from MTV felt that the performance was " surprisingly " sparse compared to Gaga 's previous " over @-@ the @-@ top " endeavors . Soraya Roberts from New York Daily News was disappointed with the " highly expected " performance , feeling that it had copied Madonna and her Blond Ambition World Tour choreography . Jason <unk> from Billboard described the performance as " spirited " , and felt that Gaga 's appearance inside the egg was one of the memorable moments of the Grammy Awards . Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly praised the performance saying that although there were definite influences of Madonna in it , the performance was one of the highlights of the show . Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone concurred that " It should come as no surprise that Lady Gaga 's performance of her new single ' Born This Way ' was the evening 's most visually stunning and bizarre spectacle . "

 At the February 19 , 2011 , date of The Monster Ball Tour , Gaga performed " Born This Way " as a second encore , using the same general attire and choreography as the Grammy performance , however the incubation vessel was not present and slight alterations were made in the outfits of her dancers . The track was then added to the set @-@ list of the concert tour . Tris McCall from The Star @-@ Ledger was most impressed with the performance , calling it one of the highlights of the concert . He added that " reinterpretation of the single , which was far more Laura Nyro than Madonna , was such an improvement over the mechanized , tricked @-@ out hit version that it was hard not to wish she could get back to the studio and re @-@ cut it before the album comes out . " Gaga performed an acoustic version on The Oprah Winfrey Show , in May 2011 , along with another song from Born This Way , " You and I " . Sitting atop a high stool , Gaga — in a red leather blazer , a floppy mask @-@ like hat and see @-@ through leopard bodysuit — played a piano made out of a wire high @-@ heel structure . 
 At The Graham Norton Show in May 2011 , Gaga performed " Born This Way " as the closing song of the show , while on Radio 1 's Big Weekend in Carlisle , Cumbria it was the opening song of the set list . Another performance took place at the season finale of Saturday Night Live , where the singer wore a metallic dress and a side ponytail . Midway through her performance , she displayed a pregnant belly as she emerged from within her dancers . A few days later , Gaga performed the song on Good Morning America as a part of their " Summer Concert Series " . She wore gold horns and a gold sequined jacket , and near the end of the performance she joined her dancers in a tank filled with 1 @,@ 800 pounds ( 820 kg ) of dyed gel . During a promotional visit in Europe in June 2011 , piano versions of the song was performed on the final show of the sixth season of Germany 's Next Topmodel , and at the <unk> 2011 in Rome . 
 A medley of " Judas " and " Born This Way " was the closing performance on the Paul O 'Grady Live show in London . Gaga closed the 2011 MuchMusic Video Awards with " Born This Way " , appearing on stage inside a hanging cocoon . While touring Japan , " Born This Way " was performed along with " The Edge of Glory " on the 2011 MTV Video Music Aid Japan . After finishing performing " The Edge of Glory " , she sneaked around the stage , and climbed some stairs to reach her piano — which was decked up to look like a giant spider — before launching into an acoustic version of " Born This Way " . The song was included on her 2012 Born This Way Ball Tour during which she came out screaming from a giant alien womb . Gaga was dressed in Medieval inspired cloths <unk> to her performance of the song at the Grammys . Gaga performed an acoustic version of " Born This Way " during her residency show in March 2014 , and her ArtRave : The Artpop Ball tour . In July 2016 , Gaga visited an orphanage in Cabo San Lucas , Mexico , where she sang an acoustic version of the song described as " emotional " by Megan McCluskey from Time .

 On March 3 , 2011 , during her concert in Toronto ( Canada ) , Gaga performed an acoustic version of the song with ten @-@ year @-@ old Maria Aragon . Gaga had been impressed by Aragon 's singing abilities when the ten @-@ year @-@ old uploaded her own version of " Born This Way " to YouTube . Aragon was subsequently invited on stage to sing with Gaga . She appeared wearing a fedora hat and carrying a stuffed monkey . Gaga sat at the piano , pulled Aragon onto her lap , before proceeding to sing a soul @-@ inspired rendition of " Born This Way " , trading off verses . " Maria represents what this song is all about , " Gaga told the Canadian crowd after the performance . " It 's all about the next generation and the future . " Later , Aragon was invited at Radio Hot 103 , where she sang the chorus of " Born This Way " through the phone . She also performed the song on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on February 23 , 2011 . Fellow American singer Katy Perry performed a stripped down version of " Born This Way " , on the March 7 , 2011 , date of her California Dreams Tour , in Paris .

In Concert ! tour , the song also was included on the concert @-@ film Glee : The 3D Concert Movie and the original soundtrack . 
 American singer @-@ songwriter and parodist " Weird Al " Yankovic had sought permission from Gaga to parody " Born This Way " , providing a brief description of the concept for his song . Her management responded that she must hear the song before providing approval . Yankovic obliged with the lyrics of " Perform This Way " , which was released on April 25 , 2011 , as the first single from his thirteenth studio album , Alpocalypse , on iTunes Store . After what Yankovic described as " considerable expense " in writing , recording , and mastering the song in the studio , he contacted Gaga 's management again with a completed recording of the song . He was subsequently refused permission , without Gaga listening to the track and Yankovic getting the impression that the refusal came from the singer herself . Left with a completed song and abandoned plans for an outlandish music video to promote the song and album , Yankovic released it on YouTube . It was then that Gaga actually heard the song , and personally contacted Yankovic , giving him green light to include the song on Alpocalypse , telling him that her manager had been the one to refuse permission , which was done without her knowledge or input . 
 BBC Radio 1 's Alex Full a.k.a. the Cornish Fairy and singer Kirsten Joy Gill recorded a cover of the song called " Cornish This Way " in August 2011 as a modern Cornish anthem .

 = Will Munro = 
 William Grant " Will " Munro ( February 11 , 1975 – May 21 , 2010 ) was a Toronto artist , club promoter , and restaurateur known for his work as a community builder among disparate Toronto groups . As a visual artist , he was known for fashioning artistic works out of underwear ; as a club promoter , he was best known for his long @-@ running Toronto queer club night , Vazaleen . 
 Born in Australia , Munro grew up mostly in Mississauga , Ontario , Canada , and moved to nearby Toronto to study at the Ontario College of Art , graduating in 2000 . Influenced by such artists as General Idea and the queercore movement , he received critical attention for his work with men 's underwear , a medium he used eventually to create collages of colourful performers he admired such as Klaus Nomi and Leigh Bowery . He created silkscreen posters to advertise Vazaleen — his monthly nightclub party that was unusual for being a queer event where punk and other rock music was prominently played , and for being one of the first to exist beyond the confines of the gay ghetto . The party was known for attracting a diverse crowd , and at its peak brought in such performers as Nina Hagen ; international " best @-@ of " nightclub lists took notice . 
 Munro died of brain cancer in May 2010 . Posthumous exhibits of his art work included a 2010 show at the Art Gallery of Ontario , and in 2011 he was the first male artist to be featured in the feminist Montreal art gallery La Centrale . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Will Munro was born in Sydney , Australia in 1975 . Later that year his family moved to Canada , just outside Montreal , and then lived in Mississauga , Ontario from 1980 onwards . 
 Despite his involvement in nightclub events , Munro did not consume alcohol or recreational drugs . He was a vegan from a young age . For many years , he volunteered as a peer counsellor at the Toronto Lesbian Gay Bi Trans Youth Line , where an annual award was established in his honour after his death . 
 Munro was diagnosed with brain cancer and underwent surgery to remove a tumour in 2008 . A second surgery was performed in October 2009 . He entered into palliative care in April 2010 , and died on May 21 , 2010 . 
 = = Art career = = 
 Munro moved from Mississauga to Toronto after high school , to attend the Ontario College of Art ( OCA ) . From early on in his career , his signature medium was pastiche work with men 's underwear . The origins of this work date back to his Intro to Sculpture class at OCA , where his professor asked the students to " bring a special object to class that isn 't really functional , but is special to you . " Munro had long had an affinity for special underwear , ever since his mother had refused to buy him <unk> superhero underwear when he was a child ; regarding white briefs , he said , " They were clinical and sterile . They weren 't very sexy . It just felt very repressed . I wanted <unk> so bad . " For the sculpture class , Munro decided to bring in a pair of underwear that he had stolen from a high school friend on whom he had a crush . He put the grey underwear on display in a Plexiglass cage , complete with air holes . In his subsequent work he decided to use white briefs as a medium " because they were so accessible . " The summer after his sculpture class , to keep himself busy on a road trip , he made a quilt out of white underwear . In 1997 , his first show involving underwear was held in a gallery supported by his college . The show received publicity after conservative columnist Michael Coren , in the Toronto Sun and on the radio , criticized Munro and his show , in particular for having said that it involved " boys ' underwear " ( although Munro had simply meant guys ' underwear ) . Coren asked the public to bring dirty diapers to the exhibit , but no one did . Munro went on to have many showings of his underwear art , mostly " rescued " from second @-@ hand Goodwill clothing outlets , including at Who 's Emma , <unk> , and Paul Petro Contemporary Art . Actor Selma Blair bought one of Munro 's underwear works when she was in town for the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival . 
 Munro 's influences included the work of General Idea , and the queercore movement . Speaking about the confluence of his music events and his art , Munro said in 2004 , " This is where the music scene and gay underground come together . We 're at a time when all kinds of shifts are happening . The structure of artists ' galleries are changing . Magazines are changing . There 's more different kinds of artist activity that 's happening . All this is having an impact on my visual work . And my visual work is more and more going into performance . " Galleries exhibiting his work have included Art in General , in New York City , Confederation Centre Art Gallery in Charlottetown , and Toronto galleries Zsa Zsa , Mercer Union , YYZ Artists ' Outlet , Paul Petro Contemporary Art , and the Art Gallery of York University . Munro was named on the longlist of finalists for the <unk> Art Award in 2010 . 
 A posthumous exhibit of his work , " Total Eclipse " , was presented at the Art Gallery of Ontario in 2010 . Works included collages , made from underwear , that depict Klaus Nomi and Leigh Bowery , both of whom Munro admired . Reviewing the show in Canadian Art , critic <unk> <unk> wrote that Munro 's work is " insistent on the necessity of self @-@ made culture and buttressed by an encyclopedic knowledge of queer underground cultural history . " 
 Other posthumous exhibitions of his work include a 2011 show at the feminist La Centrale gallery in Montreal — a first for a male artist in that space — and in 2012 a major retrospective at the Art Gallery of York University .

 Munro started the monthly party Vaseline ( later renamed Vazaleen ) in Toronto at a time when most gay clubs featured house music or other types of dance music . His hope was to draw a more diverse crowd : he said at the time , " I 'd like to do something that 'll encompass all the freaks out there , myself included . " In addition to its stereotype @-@ countering incorporation of punk and other rock music , his club night was also noted to be unusual for being located outside of the Church and Wellesley gay neighbourhood . It was atypical as well for having about 50 percent women attending the event . Munro said , " I was determined to get women to attend and I did it in a really simple way . I put lots of images of women and dyke icons on the posters and flyers — groups like The Runaways or singers like Nina Hagen and Carole Pope . I wanted women to know instantly that this was their space as much as anybody else 's . " It began in the downstairs space at El Mocambo in late 1999 , moved to the upstairs space in January 2000 , and in late 2001 , when El Mocambo was threatening to close , to Lee 's Palace , where it continued as a monthly event until 2006 ; it continues to this day as an annual event as part the city 's Pride Week festivities , to raise money for the Will Munro Fund for Queer and Trans People Living with Cancer . 
 In a lengthy article about Vazaleen in Toronto Life , critic R. M. Vaughan wrote , " In its lewd , spontaneous , hysterical and glamorous way , Vazaleen defined a new Toronto aesthetic , a playful and endlessly inventive mode of presentation that encompassed everything from lesbian <unk> rock to tranny camp to vintage punk revival to good old @-@ fashioned loud @-@ mouthed drag . " In an editorial in C magazine , Amish Morrell wrote , " At [ Vazaleen ] it was not only okay to be gay , but it was okay to be other than gay . One could be just about anything . The effect was that it completely destabilized all preconceptions of gender and sexual identity , in a <unk> environment where everyone became a performer . " Benjamin Boles of Now wrote , " These days it ’ s normal in Toronto for hip gay scenes to flourish outside of the queer ghetto and to attract a wide spectrum of genders and orientations , but that didn ’ t really happen until Vazaleen took off and became a veritable community for everyone who didn ’ t fit into the mainstream homo world . For too long , it was too rare to see dykes , fags , trans people , and breeders hanging out together , and Munro changed that . " Vazaleen became a launching pad for such musical acts as Peaches and Lesbians on Ecstasy . Other bands performing at Vazaleen early in their careers were The Hidden Cameras , Crystal Castles , and The Gossip . At the height of the event 's popularity , Munro appeared on the cover of Now magazine ( made up to look similar to David Bowie 's Aladdin Sane album cover ) , musical guests included Carole Pope , Tracy + the Plastics , Vaginal Davis , Glen Meadmore and Nina Hagen , and Vazaleen appeared on " best @-@ of " nightclub lists internationally . 
 Munro produced other Toronto club nights such as Peroxide , which featured electro music , No T. O. , which showcased No Wave , Seventh Heaven Dream Disco , and the amateur stripper party Moustache . In 2006 , Munro and his friend Lynn MacNeil bought The Beaver Café , in the West Queen West neighbourhood . Arts columnist Murray Whyte of the Toronto Star wrote , " Will ’ s virtual status as hub took bricks @-@ and @-@ mortar form : The Beaver quickly became that cozy , everyone @-@ in @-@ the @-@ pool house party , a sort of community hall / mini dance club , and an alt @-@ culture oasis " . " Love Saves the Day " became Munro 's dance music night at The Beaver , which he continued to organize even as his illness began to prevent him from leaving home . His final night of DJing in person was at a special Halloween Vazaleen party at Lee 's Palace in 2009 . 
 Bruce <unk> wrote of Munro 's impact on Toronto , just prior to his death : " As we all know , Toronto can be a cruel and unforgiving city . What makes Will Munro so extraordinary as an artist and as a person is that he has not only remained true to such a harsh mistress , but that he has also contributed so substantially to the fabric and heft of this often <unk> metropolis . His dedication to community work ( including volunteering for a decade at an LGBT youth crisis hotline ) and to creating social and sexual stimulation for the queer community outside the decaying gay ghetto ( namely , his wonderfully raunchy club night , Vazaleen , and his participation as a founding partner in revitalizing the Beaver Café ) is unmatched . " 
 In 2013 , Toronto @-@ based writer Sarah Liss published Army of Lovers : A Community History of Will Munro , a book which collected reminiscences about Munro from his family , friends and colleagues . The book 's launch party , dubbed Vaza @-@ Launch , featured performances by both Peaches and Light Fires . The book is divided into three parts ( Mississauga <unk> , Rock Show , and Heaven ) , which all work to highlight what an extraordinary talent Munro had for community cultivation . It begins with Munro 's childhood spent in Mississauga , which both of his parents state that Munro and his brother , Dave , " hated Mississauga . " ( pg . 16 ) Dave Munro recalls that Will experienced a sudden shift in personality in or slightly before grade seven , where he became a different person : " Will was like , ' Fuck doing after @-@ school @-@ programs , ' and started down his own path " ( pg . 23 ) . 
 = Kathiawari = 
 The Kathiawari is a breed of horse from India , originating in the Kathiawar peninsula . Closely related to the Marwari horse , and resembling both that breed and the Arabian horse from which they descend , the Kathiawari was originally bred as a desert war horse for use over long distances , in rough terrain , on minimal rations . They are found in all colors except for black , and are commonly dun with primitive markings . Breeding diminished after India 's independence , and today there are very few Kathiawaris left in existence . Originally used as war horses and cavalry mounts , they are currently used as mounted police horses and for the sport of tent pegging . The breed registry and annual shows are organized by the Kathiawari Horse Breeders ' Association . 
 = = Breed characteristics = = 
 The best quality Kathiawaris are under 15 hands ( 60 inches , 152 cm ) ; horses over this height often appear coarse and deviate from the desired breed type . The breed is found in all colors , except for black . Chestnut is the color seen most often , followed by bay , gray and finally dun . Many dun horses exhibit primitive markings , which shows a possible connection to the Tarpan . Pinto patterns do exist , but are extremely rare . The breed has a concave facial profile , with a broad forehead and short muzzle . The neck and body are proportional and relatively short , while both the head and tail are carried high . Although well @-@ proportioned , many Western breeders consider them to be lacking in bone in the legs . However , soundness is an inherent characteristic of the breed . One of the breed 's most distinctive features is its ears , which curve inward to touch and sometimes overlap at the tips . The Kathiawari has the most extremely curved ears of any breed of horse . At some points in the breed 's history , breeders focused on the preservation of these curving ears , to the detriment of some other , more important , physical characteristics . Like many desert breeds , the Kathiawari can subsist on minimal rations and water and is more resistant to the heat than breeds developed in colder climates . As well as the usual gaits , the Kathiawari also performs a swift , lateral pace , called the <unk> . They are known as high @-@ spirited , intelligent and affectionate horses . 
 They are quite similar to the Marwari horse , another breed from India , having much of the same history and physical features . The main difference between the Kathiawari and the Marwari is their original geographic origin – Kathiawaris are from the Kathiawar peninsula while Marwaris are mainly from the Marwar region . Kathiawaris tend to have slight facial differences from the Marwari , and are slightly taller in general . The Kathiawari also resembles the Arabian horse , which contributed significantly during the development of the breed . 
 = = History = = 
 Although the earliest origins of the breed remain unknown , horses inhabited the western coast of India well before the Mughal Emperors of 1536 to 1857 . Beginning during the Mughal reign , and continuing during the British Raj , Arabian horses were imported to India and crossed with the native stock , creating the ancestors of the modern Kathiawari breed . The Kathiawari may have also been influenced by the Mongolian horse . Traditionally , noble households specialized in their own strain of horses , naming their lines of horses after a foundation mare ; 28 of these lines still exist . These noble houses selectively bred horses that could withstand extreme temperatures and minimal rations , carry a man with weapons and armor for long periods in rough terrain , and still be swift and nimble . They bred for wiry , sleek horses that were ideal for war , and Kathiawaris were noted for their loyalty and bravery in battle , often defending their riders even when wounded themselves . This breeding was maintained until India 's independence . 
 Although still mainly bred in the Kathiawar peninsula , it is also found in the Maharashtra and Rajasthan states . The Kathiawari Horse Breeders ' Association maintains the breed registry . The Gujarat government maintains stud farms in eleven different locations ; one in Junagadh holds both mares and stallions and is tasked with preserving the breed , while the other ten hold Kathiawari stallions that are used for improving the local stock of other or mixed breeds . As of 2007 , only about 50 Kathiawaris were held by private breeders . Today , the <unk> region is renowned for its Kathiawari horses , often producing the most beautiful horses of the breed . In early 2010 , the UK @-@ based Friends of Marwari / Kathiawari Horse asked for donations of used bits . These would be given to owners of horses , including Kathiawaris , in India in place of home @-@ made bits , which often have sharp edges that can injure the horse . 
 = = Uses = = 
 In the early 1800s , the Kathiawari was used by the Maratha and British cavalries , and was considered superior to other breeds in this capacity . The use by the cavalry was maintained until the end of World War I , but they are used little by the Indian army in modern times , despite being a native breed . Many Indian mounted police units make use of the Kathiawari . The Kathiawari is also used extensively for the sport of tent pegging . Annual breed shows are hosted by the breed registry .

 Vicki Leekx is a mixtape by British recording artist M.I.A. which was released on 31 December 2010 . Following the release of her album Maya earlier in 2010 , the artist announced via Twitter that she would be releasing a mixtape on the last day of the year , and subsequently made it available free to download . It incorporates reworked versions of tracks from Maya and new material and was reported as having been inspired by the 2010 Wikileaks controversy , although much of its content is not politically inspired . 
 = = Background = = 
 M.I.A. released her third album Maya in July 2010 to mixed reviews . In early December , she announced on Twitter that she would be following it up with a mixtape to be released on 31 December , stating " <unk> <unk> [ sic ] mixtape coming new years eve ! <unk> bad minds to rest 2010 ! " The mixtape was uploaded online from Bangkok , Thailand after she sent it via YouSendIt to a friend , stating " <unk> up / loaded in <unk> ! thank u , for being a dope ass people / <unk> cant seem to leave please kick me out ! or i wont go ! " Exclaim ! writer Josiah Hughes contended that the latter portion of the message referred to events which had occurred during the year including the album 's mixed reviews and her clashes with journalists and former collaborator Diplo . 
 Shortly before Christmas , the website <unk> began displaying a countdown to the mixtape 's release in the form of animated water rising up a dateline , and on 30 December M.I.A. uploaded a TwitPic showing the track listing and credits . Zach Baron , writing for The Village Voice , contended that the singer deliberately chose to release the mixtape at the point in the year when internet traffic is traditionally at its lowest , so as " not to feed the online content machines that chewed her up this year " . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 The material included reworked tracks and out @-@ takes from Maya , with previously unreleased material . Some of the tracks , including " Let Me Hump You " and " Gen @-@ N @-@ E @-@ Y " , had been made available by M.I.A. earlier in the year at a series of bespoke website addresses . The tracks " Meds and Feds " and " Steppin ' Up " from Maya appear in radically altered forms , including the removal of the heavy guitar played by Derek E. Miller of the group Sleigh Bells on the original version of the former . 
 A number of reviewers made a connection between the mixtape 's title and the 2010 Wikileaks controversy . Although the mix opens with a quote about the leaking of information and subsequent legal and political attacks from Julian Assange , founder of Wikileaks , delivered by a female voice , much of the content is not related to the controversy or politically themed . Musically , the mixtape is less abrasive in style than the industrial @-@ influenced Maya , but the lyrics contain a number of attacks on " imitators , haters , and [ ... ] psychos " and " bitches who are fame hoes " . The female voice heard at the start , identified by reviewers as the " title character " , returns sporadically during the mix speaking internet slogans . At different points the music incorporates heavy percussion , Auto @-@ Tuned vocals , and " bhangra @-@ style " sounds similar to those heard on her second studio album Kala . Most of the mix is at a high tempo , although it slows towards the end , where the longest sections are found .

 Vicki Leekx has been downloadable for free since 31 December 2010 from a bespoke website . In its review of the mixtape , Sputnikmusic commented that " Maya Arulpragasam might have had a rough year , but with Vicki Leekx , she 's ended it with a bang " . Tom Breihan , a writer from Pitchfork Media , commented that in " its brief onslaught of <unk> fun , Vicki Leekx only occasionally reaches the dizzy pop heights of Arular and Kala . But it does give us an M.I.A. who , once again , seems to be having a blast doing what she 's doing . And it 's great to learn this M.I.A. still exists " . As of 6 January 2011 , the track " Bad Girls " has been listed as " Best New Music " by the same website . 
 Matthew Cole , reviewing the mixtape in Slant Magazine , described Maya as " an act of musical self @-@ immolation from a self @-@ styled outsider uncomfortable with her own marketability " but that Vicki Leekx was an " ensuing ground @-@ zero dance party " to follow up such a " levelling of her image " . Mike Schiller , writing for webzine PopMatters , was positive in his review but stated that the mix sounded like " an artist throwing ideas at a wall and seeing what sticks " . In consumer guide for MSN Music , critic Robert Christgau gave Vicki Leekx a B + rating , indicating " remarkable one way or another , yet also flirts with the humdrum or the half @-@ assed " .

 = Lexus LS = 
 The Lexus LS ( Japanese : <unk> ・ LS , <unk> LS ) is a full @-@ size luxury car serving as the flagship model of Lexus , the luxury division of Toyota . Now in its fourth generation , all LS models have featured V8 engines and rear @-@ wheel drive , with Lexus also offering all @-@ wheel drive , hybrid , and long @-@ wheelbase variants . 
 As the first model developed by Lexus , the LS 400 debuted in January 1989 with the second generation debuting in November 1994 . The LS 430 debuted in January 2000 and the LS 460 / LS 460 L series in 2006 . A domestic @-@ market version of the LS 400 and LS 430 , badged as Toyota Celsior ( Japanese : <unk> ・ <unk> , Toyota <unk> ) , was sold in Japan until the Lexus marque was introduced there in 2006 . In 2006 ( for the 2007 model year ) the fourth @-@ generation LS 460 debuted the first production eight @-@ speed automatic transmission and an automatic parking system . In 2007 , V8 hybrid powertrains were introduced on the LS 600h / LS 600h L sedans . 
 Development of the LS began in 1983 as the F1 project , the code name for a secret flagship sedan . The resulting sedan followed an extended five @-@ year design process at a cost of over US $ 1 billion , and premiered with a new V8 engine and numerous luxury features . The Lexus LS was intended from its inception for export markets , and the Lexus division was formed to market and service the vehicle internationally . The original LS 400 debuted to strong sales , and was largely responsible for the successful launch of the Lexus marque . 
 Since the start of production , each generation of the Lexus LS has been manufactured in the Japanese city of Tahara , Aichi . The LS name stands for " Luxury Sedan " . Some Lexus importers use the <unk> name , " Luxury Saloon " .

 In August 1983 , Toyota chairman Eiji Toyoda initiated the F1 project ( " Flagship " and " No. 1 " vehicle ; alternatively called the " Circle @-@ F " project ) , a clandestine effort aimed at producing a world @-@ class luxury sedan for international markets . The F1 development effort did not have a specific budget or time constraints , and the resulting vehicle did not utilize existing Toyota platforms or parts . Instead , chief engineer Ichiro Suzuki sought to develop an all @-@ new design , aiming to surpass rival American and European flagship sedans in specific target areas , including aerodynamics , cabin quietness , overall top speed , and fuel efficiency . During development , 60 designers , 1 @,@ 400 engineers split up into 24 teams , 2 @,@ 300 technicians and over 200 support workers built approximately 450 flagship prototypes and 900 engine prototypes and logged 2 @.@ 7 million kilometres of testing on locations ranging from winter Europe roadways ; deserts in Arizona , Australia , and Saudi Arabia ; to U.S. highways and wilderness areas . 
 In May 1985 , designers started work on the F1 project . In late 1985 , designers presented the first exterior study models to F1 management , featuring a sports car @-@ like design with a low @-@ slung hood and narrow front profile . By 1986 , the sedan used a three box design with an upright stance , more prominent grille , and a two @-@ tone body . Extensive modeling and wind tunnel tests resulted in a low drag coefficient for a conventional production vehicle of the time ( Cd 0 @.@ 29 ) . For the passenger cabin , materials selection tests evaluated 24 different kinds of wood and multiple types of leather for two years before settling on specific trim combinations . By 1986 , the Lexus marque was created to support the launch of the flagship sedan , and the vehicle became known as the Lexus LS . Following eight design reviews , subsequent revisions , concept approval in September 1986 , and over US $ 1 billion in development expenses , the final design for the production Lexus LS 400 ( chassis code <unk> ) was frozen in May 1987 with design patents filed on 13 May 1987 . 
 In January 1989 , the LS 400 made its debut as a 1990 model at the North American International Auto Show , in Detroit , Michigan . U.S. sales began in September 1989 , followed by limited exports to Australia , Canada , and the United Kingdom . The LS 400 's new 4 @.@ 0 liter <unk> @-@ FE 32 @-@ valve V8 engine , capable of 190 kilowatts ( 250 hp ) and 353 newton metres ( 260 ft · lbf ) of torque , was linked to a new four @-@ speed automatic transmission with ECT @-@ i electronically controlled shifts , super @-@ flow torque converter and rear differential . The chassis used an independent , double @-@ wishbone suspension setup , and a passive air suspension system was optional . The LS 400 's 0 – 100 kilometres per hour ( 62 mph ) time was 8 @.@ 5 seconds , and its top speed was 250 kilometres per hour ( 160 mph ) . Compared to the rival target BMW <unk> ( <unk> ) and Mercedes @-@ Benz 420 SE ( <unk> ) , the LS 400 had a quieter cabin , with 58 dB at 100 kilometres per hour ( 62 mph ) ; a higher top speed ; a lower drag coefficient and curb weight ; and it avoided the U.S. Gas Guzzler Tax . At its introduction in 1989 , it won the Car of the Year Japan award . 
 The LS 400 was among the first luxury sedans to feature an automatic tilt @-@ and @-@ telescoping steering wheel with SRS airbag , power adjustable shoulder seat belts , and an <unk> rear @-@ view mirror . The five @-@ passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim , power @-@ adjustable seats , and soft @-@ touch controls . A back @-@ lit electroluminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic visual effect , with indicator lights projected onto the instrument panel . The memory system stored the driver 's seat , side mirror , steering wheel , and seat belt positions . Available luxury options included a <unk> premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands @-@ free capabilities . The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence , including fluid @-@ damped cabin fixtures , vibration @-@ insulating rubber mounts , airflow fairings , and sandwich steel body panels . 
 In Japan , the launch of Lexus was complicated by Toyota 's existing four domestic dealership networks at the time of its introduction . The Toyota Crown and Toyota Century were exclusive to Toyota Store locations . During the LS 400 's development , local dealers ' requests for a Japanese domestic market version had grown , and a right @-@ hand @-@ drive Toyota Celsior @-@ badged version was introduced shortly after the LS 400 's U.S. debut , and introduced 9 October 1989 and only available at Toyopet Store locations . The Celsior , named after the Latin word for " supreme " , was largely identical to the LS . Models came in either basic " A " , upgraded suspension " B " , or fully equipped " C " trim specifications . The Crown and the Crown <unk> , which appeared later in 1991 , were only available at Toyota Store locations which carried Japan @-@ only Toyota luxury models , like the Century . The Celsior introduced two world firsts : high @-@ performance twin @-@ tube shock absorbers and an air suspension combined with an upgraded version of Toyota 's semi @-@ active dampers Toyota Electronic <unk> Suspension , called <unk> <unk> . This was ahead of its time , Mercedes @-@ Benz first introduced a similar electronically controlled air suspension on the 1999 Mercedes @-@ Benz S @-@ Class ( <unk> ) ( <unk> ) . 
 Adding incentive for early U.S. sales was a base price of US $ 35 @,@ 000 , which undercut competitors by thousands of dollars and brought accusations of selling below cost from rival BMW . 
 In December 1989 , shortly after the LS 400 's launch , Lexus ordered a voluntary recall of the 8 @,@ 000 vehicles sold so far , based upon two customer complaints over defective wiring and an overheated brake light . All vehicles were serviced within 20 days , and the incident helped establish Lexus ' customer service reputation . By 1990 , U.S. sales of the LS 400 had surpassed those of competing Mercedes @-@ Benz , BMW , and Jaguar models . Production of the first @-@ generation LS 400 totaled over 165 @,@ 000 units . Years after its introduction , the LS 400 remained a reliable choice for a used car , making Consumer Reports ' 2007 list of recommended vehicles that regularly last 320 @,@ 000 km ( 200 @,@ 000 mi ) or more with proper maintenance .

 Debuting in September 1992 as a 1993 model , the refreshed LS 400 ( designed in 1991 ) was introduced with more than 50 changes , largely in response to customer and dealer requests . The vehicle received larger disc brakes , wheels , and tires , and adjustments were made to the suspension and power steering systems to improve handling . Stylistic changes included additional body side moldings and a revised grille , along with a greater selection of colors . For the interior , a standard passenger front airbag ( first Toyota @-@ built series production car available with passenger front airbag ) , an external temperature gauge , digital odometer , seat belt <unk> , and chlorofluorocarbon @-@ free refrigerant were added . In 1992 , the Celsior introduced the world first GPS navigation system with voice instructions , supplied by Aisin . By 1994 , the LS 400 's U.S. base price exceeded US $ 50 @,@ 000 , a figure that had steadily risen since the vehicle 's introduction . Customer demand for the vehicle and shifts in foreign exchange rates contributed to the increase in price . The growing popularity of the LS internationally was an asset to Toyota , as Japan had entered into an economic recession in 1991 , that later became what was called the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble or " bubble economy " . Production of the first @-@ generation LS ended in September 1994 to make way for production of the second @-@ generation model in October .

 The second @-@ generation Lexus LS 400 ( <unk> ) debuted in November 1994 ( for the 1995 model year ) with a longer wheelbase and similar specifications as the original model . The public unveiling of the vehicle occurred in a gala ceremony held at the San Francisco Opera House in California . The sedan was equipped with an updated 4 @.@ 0 @-@ liter <unk> @-@ FE V8 engine , producing 194 kilowatts ( 260 hp ) and 366 newton metres ( 270 ft · lbf ) of torque . Internally , over 90 % of the redesigned LS 400 's composition was new or redesigned , with increased sound insulation , a strengthened body structure , suspension updates ( first LS / Celsior with Skyhook adaptive computerized air suspension ) , and improved brakes . The redesigned model was 95 kg ( 209 lb ) lighter than its predecessor and achieved slightly better fuel economy . The 0 – 100 kilometres per hour ( 62 mph ) time improved to 7 @.@ 5 seconds . 
 Development of the second @-@ generation LS 400 began after worldwide launch of the first generation . Given the first @-@ generation model 's successful reception and high level of customer satisfaction with its design , replicating the original LS 400 's attributes with its successor was one of chief engineer Kazuo Okamoto 's primary goals ( he stated that " a tradition cannot be founded if you reject the first generation " ) . Externally , the most significant change was an increase in wheelbase length of 36 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) , resulting in more interior space and an additional 66 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) of rear seat legroom . However , as the overall length remained the same , trunk capacity was slightly reduced . The more aerodynamic body ( Cd 0 @.@ 28 ) retained the general profile and contours of the original LS 400 and was the work of the <unk> Design Research center in the U.S. Designers had evaluated 20 competing concepts , including several with a radically changed body , before selecting a winning entry in 1991 that included forms and contours similar to the original LS 400 . Upon final approval in 1992 , an evolutionary redesign was the ultimate result , with new design features consisting of sharper angles , curved body lines , and a beveled grille . More prominent side lines provided a reference point for parking maneuvers , and forward visibility was improved . Production development lasted from 1991 until conclusion in the second quarter of 1994 . 
 The redesigned LS 400 interior received upgraded features , varying from dual @-@ zone climate controls to rear <unk> . A newly patented seat cushion design , similar to the car 's suspension , utilized lightweight internal coil springs and stabilizer bars to improve comfort . One of the first in @-@ dash CD changers was offered as an option . Safety enhancements included enlarged crumple zones , three @-@ point seat belts at all positions , and a new collapsible steering column . In Japan , the Toyota Celsior equivalents were offered in the same " A " , " B " , and top @-@ spec " C " configurations as before , along with an additional selection of exterior colors . Several optional features , such as a compact disc @-@ based Global Positioning System ( GPS ) navigation system and reclining rear seats , were available only in Japan . 
 At its U.S. debut , the redesigned LS 400 retained a pricing advantage over European competitors in its largest market , launching with a base price of US $ 51 @,@ 000 . However , cost differences had narrowed following more aggressive pricing and added feature content from rival manufacturers . To promote their new flagship , Lexus launched a US $ 50 million advertising campaign , the most expensive marketing effort since the launch of the division . In mid @-@ 1995 , sales slowed as the U.S. government threatened tariffs on Japanese luxury cars over the widening U.S.-Japan trade deficit , potentially raising the price of a fully optioned LS 400 to over US $ 100 @,@ 000 . Subsequent negotiations averted the sanctions by the second quarter of that year , and sales recovered in the following months . Ultimately , second @-@ generation LS 400 sales were not as voluminous as the original model ; production totaled approximately 114 @,@ 000 units . 
 Production of the <unk> ran from October 1994 to July 1997 . For 1997 , a limited " Coach Edition " LS 400 was produced in partnership with American leather manufacturer Coach Inc . The edition featured Coach leather seats ; embroidered emblems on the exterior , <unk> , and armrest ; special colors and added trim ; and a Coach cabin bag . Production was limited to a yearly run of 2 @,@ 500 units . 
 = = = 1997 – 2000 = = = 
 Designed in 1996 , in September 1997 a revised LS 400 was introduced for the 1998 model year . Changes were a five @-@ speed automatic transmission , increased engine output ( to 216 kilowatts ( 290 hp ) , with variable valve timing ( VVT @-@ i ) , and an added 41 newton metres ( 30 ft · lbf ) of torque . Acceleration times and fuel economy were improved as a result . The suspension and steering also received minor tweaks to improve feel and handling . Stylistically , the vehicle sported a new front fascia , side mirrors , and updated wheels ; a rear windshield diversity antenna replaced the conventional power mast . The cabin received upgrades , including a trip computer , <unk> , retractable rear headrests , reading lamps , and ultraviolet @-@ tinted glass , while the climate control gained a micron filtration feature with a smog sensor . 
 In August 1997 , the first production laser adaptive cruise control on a Toyota vehicle was introduced on the Celsior version ( Japan only ) It controlled speed only through throttle control and downshifting , but did not apply the brakes . Because of laser technology limitations , it deactivated in bad weather . 
 A CD @-@ ROM @-@ based GPS automotive navigation system became an option in the U.S. Added safety features included front side airbags , vehicle stability control and in 2000 , brake assist . Introduced low beam HID headlamps . The headlights were also equipped with a programmable delay feature for proximity illumination . In February 2000 , the limited " Platinum Series " LS 400 was introduced at the Chicago Auto Show in partnership with American Express . The edition featured most luxury options standard , along with separate exterior colors , wheels , badging , and two years ' no @-@ fee use of an American Express Platinum Card .

 The third @-@ generation Lexus LS 430 ( <unk> ) debuted at the North American International Auto Show in January 2000 as a 2001 model , introducing a new body design and a host of new interior and technological features . 
 It was the first US market Lexus with adaptive cruise control ( called Dynamic Laser Cruise Control ) . It employed a lidar sensor and ( unlike the laser ACC introduced in 1997 on the Celsior ) was able to activate brakes for deceleration . However , because of laser technology limitations , it deactivated in bad weather . 
 The sedan was equipped with a new 4 @.@ 3 liter 3UZ @-@ FE engine generating 216 kilowatts ( 290 hp ) and 434 newton metres ( 320 ft · lbf ) of torque . The LS 430 was one of the first gasoline V8 vehicles to be certified as an Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle ( ULEV ) . The standard suspension had been completely redesigned , with a double @-@ wishbone setup at all four wheels ; a Euro @-@ tuned suspension was offered for the first time . A new torque @-@ activated electronic control unit made throttle adjustments based on vehicle speed , engine revolutions per minute , and pedal position . The LS 430 sported a 0 – 100 kilometres per hour ( 62 mph ) acceleration time of 6 @.@ 7 seconds . Sales began in October 2000 in the U.S. 
 Heading into the planning of the LS 430 , division executives concluded that the previous LS redesign had been too restrained in its approach . The LS 430 development team , led by chief engineer Yasushi Tanaka , accordingly opted for a more thorough exterior , interior , and technological redevelopment . The development of the LS 430 took four years . Selected from 16 different concept designs , the resulting vehicle of December 1997 — when the final design ( by Akihiro <unk> ) was approved — saw the sedan 's dimensions increase in terms of wheelbase and height . The exterior featured a larger grille with rounded edges , quarter windows on the rear doors , and rounded trapezoidal headlamps . The body was also more aerodynamic than previous LS sedans ( Cd 0 @.@ 26 ; 0 @.@ 25 with air suspension ) , and was the product of wind tunnel testing at facilities used for Shinkansen bullet train development . A 76 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) wheelbase stretch resulted in more interior volume and allowed the engine to be positioned further aft for better balance . Trunk space was increased by one @-@ third due to repositioning of the fuel tank . 
 Compared to previous generations , the LS 430 featured a greater number of model configurations and options . While sharing the same body style , variants were differentiated by chassis configuration and onboard equipment . Models with the Euro @-@ tuned sport suspension , sold as the " Touring " package in the U.S. , featured larger , high @-@ speed brakes . These brakes were also standard on European market models . Fully optioned models with height adjustable air suspension , tuned for a combination of soft ride and responsive handling , were sold in the U.S. as the " Ultra Luxury " edition . 
 The LS 430 interior featured walnut wood trim on the dashboard and upper doors , along with semi @-@ aniline leather and oscillating air conditioning vents . 
 The GPS navigation system was totally redesigned . A liquid crystal display with touchscreen on the upper center console served as interface . First LS with voice controlled navigation . First system featuring DVD ( instead of CD @-@ ROM ) maps on a luxury sedan . 
 Introduced a Mark Levinson premium sound system . In its highest trim specification , the LS 430 included Lexus Link telematics , power door and trunk closers , heated and cooled front seats , and power reclining massage rear seats equipped with audio controls , power sunshade , a cooler , and air purifier . Several rear seat features adopted for the LS 430 had been previously available in Japanese market luxury vehicles . Safety features added to the LS 430 included front and rear side curtain airbags , park sensors , rain @-@ sensing windshield wipers , and electronic brakeforce distribution . The vehicle also gained water repellent windshield and side glass . 
 The LS 430 first went on sale in the U.S. with an initial base price of US $ 55 @,@ 000 , ranging up to US $ 70 @,@ 000 when fully equipped . At the high end , the LS 430 's pricing encroached on European rivals as Lexus became increasingly able to command higher price premiums for its vehicles . Sales for the LS 430 surpassed the previous generation , and production exceeded 140 @,@ 000 units . The LS 430 was produced until July 2006 , marking the last occasion the Lexus flagship was produced in a single body style . In Japan , the equivalent Toyota Celsior was also sold from August 2000 until March 2006 , when the long @-@ awaited introduction of Lexus Japan saw the arrival of new generation Lexus models . <unk> design patents were filed by Toyota in domestic Japan , on 8 March 1999 at the Japan Patent Office under patent number <unk> . 
 In every year of production , the LS 430 was the most reliable luxury sedan in the J.D. Power and Associates Initial Quality Survey ( with the early and late models of this series the best performing ) , and the highest recorded scorer in the history of J.D. Power 's Vehicle Dependability Survey . Thatcham ratings data via the UK Motor Insurance Repair Research Centre listed the theft @-@ prevention capabilities of the LS 430 as a maximum 5 stars , with the LS 430 being the first automobile to achieve the maximum theft @-@ deterrence rating in 2001 .

 Designed throughout 2002 , the LS 430 update debuted in September 2003 as a 2004 model . 
 The first radar ( instead of previous lidar ) sensor on a Lexus sedan allowed the new Dynamic RADAR Cruise Control to work in any weather conditions . The millimeter @-@ wave radar technology also enabled the first Pre @-@ Collision System ( PCS ) on a Lexus sedan ( with partial autonomous braking only on the Japanese market Toyota Celsior version ) . A " low @-@ speed tracking mode " was added in 2004 . The low @-@ speed speed tracking mode was a second mode that would warn the driver if the car ahead stopped and provide braking ; it could stop the car but then deactivated .

 = = = 2006 – 2009 = = = 
 Development on fourth generation LS began in 2001 , with the design process being done under Yo <unk> from 2002 to 2004 when the final production design was frozen . In October 2005 , Lexus premiered a gasoline @-@ electric hybrid concept car , the LF @-@ Sh ( Lexus Future @-@ Sedan hybrid ) , at the Tokyo Motor Show , publicly previewing the next Lexus flagship with a concept version for the first time . Introduced at the January 2006 North American International Auto Show for the 2007 model year , the fourth @-@ generation Lexus LS became the first Lexus model to be produced in both standard and long @-@ wheelbase versions . Using an all @-@ new platform , the LS 460 ( <unk> ) uses the standard 2 @,@ 969 mm ( 116 @.@ 9 in ) wheelbase , while the LS 460 L ( <unk> ) features a stretched 3 @,@ 091 mm ( 121 @.@ 7 in ) wheelbase . The fourth @-@ generation models ' technical specifications were shown in greater detail at the Geneva Motor Show in February 2006 . A hybrid version , LS 600h L ( <unk> ) , was previewed at the New York International Auto Show in April 2006 . At its introduction in 2006 , it won the Car of the Year Japan award for the second time . 
 The LS 460 and LS 460 L are both equipped with a new 4 @.@ 6 liter <unk> @-@ <unk> V8 producing 283 kilowatts ( 380 hp ) and 498 newton metres ( 367 ft · lbf ) of torque , coupled to the first production eight @-@ speed automatic transmission . Acceleration from 0 – 100 kilometres per hour ( 62 mph ) is listed at 5 @.@ 7 seconds . 
 The development of the LS 460 and its variants , led by chief engineer <unk> Yoshida , began as Lexus was shifting its design strategy towards a more diversified product lineup , with new @-@ vehicle launches largely focused on global markets . Plans called for the next @-@ generation LS to differentiate itself further beyond previous models in terms of design and technology . A " Super LS " model , priced above the US $ 100 @,@ 000 ultra @-@ luxury category , was also considered . Externally , the Lexus LS received the styling cues of Lexus ' new design direction , called L @-@ finesse . First shown on the LF @-@ Sh concept , the vehicle gained body forms running the length of the car , wheel arches , arrow @-@ shaped chrome trim , a lower @-@ set grille , and crystalline adaptive headlamps . 
 The LS 460 interior gained a push @-@ button start , thin @-@ film transistor instrument display , and numerous luxury options , ranging from a hard disk drive @-@ based GPS navigation system and song library to a heated steering wheel and XM <unk> . Standard equipment included power 16 @-@ way driver and 12 @-@ way front passenger seats with lumbar adjustment and seat heaters , leather upholstery , premium sound system , power moonroof , and trunk pass @-@ through . The climate control offered the first infrared body temperature sensors in an automobile ; it also featured ceiling air diffusers . An " Executive " seating package on the LS 460 L included a rear @-@ seat DVD entertainment system , swivel tray table , and a <unk> massaging <unk> seat . 
 It was the first LS with continuous controlled Adaptive Variable Suspension <unk> . The addition of an automated parallel parking assist feature , the first of its kind in the U.S. , allowed the LS 460 to steer itself into preselected parking spaces . Other drive @-@ assist features included a brake @-@ hold system , radar cruise control , electric variable gear ratio power steering , and electronically controlled braking . The new stability control system was improved to anticipate skids and alter steering assist and gear ratios . The suite of new safety features extended from an eye @-@ tracking Driver Monitoring System to a lane departure warning system . The pre @-@ collision system added the first production image processing chip in a car capable of identifying vehicles and pedestrians in real time , along with millimeter @-@ wavelength radar , stereo cameras , and infrared night vision projectors . A rear pre @-@ collision system with whiplash @-@ preventing active seat headrests and dual @-@ chamber front airbags was also introduced . 
 The LS 460 and LS 460 L arrived at dealerships in Japan , the U.S. , and Europe in late 2006 , and the vehicle reached Australia , East Asia , and the Middle East in 2007 . The U.S. base prices for the 2007 LS 460 and LS 460 L were US $ 61 @,@ 000 and US $ 71 @,@ 000 , respectively . In 2006 and 2007 , the average price paid for U.S. market LS 460 L sedans exceeded US $ 80 @,@ 000 , due largely to added options packages , placing the Lexus LS in the same average price range as its long @-@ wheelbase Audi , BMW , and Jaguar rivals for the first time . 
 After debuting a hybrid powertrain with the 2005 LF @-@ Sh concept , Lexus began sales of the LS 600h L ( <unk> ) , the first production V8 @-@ powered full @-@ hybrid vehicle , in May 2007 for the 2008 model year . The long @-@ wheelbase LS 600h L is equipped with Lexus Hybrid Drive , featuring a 5 @.@ 0 liter <unk> @-@ <unk> V8 engine mated to a high @-@ output electric motor with nickel @-@ metal hydride battery packs . This system uses a continuously variable transmission and generates an output of 327 kilowatts ( 439 hp ) . Fuel economy is slightly higher overall than the lower @-@ powered non @-@ hybrid LS , and the hybrids achieve a U.S. Super Ultra Low Emission Vehicle ( SULEV ) rating . Features specific to the LS hybrids include the first production low beam LED headlights , a leather @-@ trimmed dash , and blue @-@ tinted hybrid badging . In April 2007 , Lexus announced that the base price for the LS 600h L would be over US $ 104 @,@ 000 , surpassing the V12 @-@ equipped Toyota Century as the most expensive Japanese luxury car ever produced . A standard @-@ wheelbase version destined for Asia and Europe , the LS 600h ( <unk> ) , was launched in Japan in May 2007 . The first 100 LS 600h L sedans sold in the U.S. were offered as " Launch Edition " models via the Neiman Marcus catalog for <unk> members . 
 In 2008 , all @-@ wheel drive versions of the non @-@ hybrid LS 460 ( <unk> ) and LS 460 L ( <unk> ) models premiered at the Moscow International Motor Show . Debuting at the 2008 Pebble Beach Concours d 'Elegance , the LS 600h L " Pebble Beach Edition " , limited to 50 units , was produced in partnership with the Pebble Beach Company . A specialized Lexus LS 460 was installed as a driving simulator at Toyota 's <unk> Technical Center , in Shizuoka , Japan , for automotive safety testing , and in 2009 at Tokyo 's Intelligent Transport Systems ( ITS @-@ Safety ) exhibition , the LS 460 ITS @-@ Safety concept was unveiled showing road @-@ to @-@ vehicle and vehicle @-@ to @-@ vehicle information @-@ exchange technologies . 
 = = = 2009 – 2012 = = = 
 Debuting in late 2009 for the 2010 model year , the revised LS 460 and LS 460 L included restyled front and rear fascias , side mirror turn signals , and new wheel designs . New technology included automatic high beam lights and a self @-@ repairing clear coat for the exterior paint . The standard cabin received additional chrome trim , an optional DVD entertainment system behind the center armrest , and in certain markets , an all @-@ digital instrument panel with night vision capability . The LS 460 Sport — a performance variant equipped with a sport @-@ tuned air suspension , Brembo brakes , forged wheels , paddle shifters , body kit , and a unique interior — was added . The Sport model received the Sport Direct Shift transmission , also found in the Lexus IS F , with downshift rev @-@ matching capability and manual mode . A new interior customization program , " L @-@ Select " , also became available for LS customers in Japan . 
 = = = 2012 – present = = = 
 Lexus released an official photograph of its restyled <unk> series in July 2012 . The substantial update incorporates the new Lexus corporate fascia , comprising the " spindle " grill and consequently sees the fitment of a redesigned hood , reshaped front fenders and headlamps , plus a new bumper . These styling revisions see the retention of the side profile and doors , including rear fenders . Thus , the newly designed tail @-@ lamps , trunk lid , and rear bumper are only partially modified . For the first time , an F @-@ Sport variant will be offered . ' <unk> ' technology is used in the air conditioning system where 20 – 50 nm ions are bonded to water molecules . 
 = = Manufacturing = = 
 The Lexus LS has been consistently produced on dedicated Lexus assembly lines at Toyota 's flagship Tahara factory , located in the city of Tahara , in Aichi Prefecture , Chūbu region , southwest of Nagoya , since 1989 . Tahara remains the sole production site , having inaugurated its new line number four specifically for assembly of the original LS 400 . 
 For the Lexus LS , the Tahara plant developed new molds and enhanced assembly techniques and instituted measures aimed at increasing the precision of the sedan 's fit and finish . The 1989 LS 400 became the first production automobile to receive extensive laser welding , allowing for seamless steel welds . A large sheet metal press was developed to reduce or eliminate panel gaps by stamping large sections whole instead of singly . Separately installed parts , such as exterior lights , were also spring @-@ loaded for a tighter fit . On the LS 400 , engineers reduced door panel gaps in half versus Toyota @-@ brand vehicles , from 7 mm ( 0 @.@ 28 in ) to 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 16 in ) , with measurements made within 0 @.@ 01 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 00039 in ) ; on the LS 430 , measurement margins were increased tenfold , to 0 @.@ 001 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 × 10 − 5 in ) . When production switched to the LS 460 , the number of laser welds was doubled . 
 Despite Tahara 's large @-@ scale automation , Lexus LS production also involves specialized personnel who are tasked with key production points , such as testing each vehicle 's V8 engine via dynamometer and stethoscope for calibration before installation . With the LS 460 , a hand @-@ sanded paint process was introduced . The production standards used on the Lexus LS were eventually adopted by the manufacturer for other vehicles ; in 2007 , the assembly of Toyota Corolla economy cars used the same panel gap measurements as the LS 400 did eighteen years earlier . 
 = = Industrial significance = = 
 The Lexus LS marked the first successful entrant of a Japanese manufacturer into the prestige luxury arena , a market that had long been dominated by established European and American brands . By 1991 , with the LS 400 its top @-@ selling model , Lexus had overtaken Mercedes @-@ Benz and BMW in overall U.S. sales , and in 2000 , the marque passed Cadillac as the luxury sales leader in the largest automotive market . Rival manufacturers responded with lower prices and added features . In particular , Mercedes @-@ Benz reorganized its operations , shifting to a targeted @-@ cost process similar to Lexus production methods , and dropped competing U.S. base prices by nearly 10 percent . To rival the LS 400 , extra features were rushed for the launch of the 1991 Mercedes @-@ Benz S @-@ Class ( <unk> ) , causing budget overruns and costing the job of Daimler @-@ Benz 's chief engineer , Wolfgang Peter . Approximately 5 percent of 1989 LS 400 sales went to buyers employed by rival manufacturers , including GM , Ford , and Chrysler . When the LS 400 was disassembled for engineering analysis , Cadillac engineers concluded that the vehicle could not be built using existing GM methods . Industry publications noted the LS 400 's precise panel gaps , and the subject became a common evaluation standard in road tests . The LS 430 's interior noise level was later used by rival makes as a measure of cabin quiet . 
 According to industry observers , the introduction of the Lexus LS reshaped Toyota 's image from that of an " <unk> " manufacturer to the builder of an automotive standard bearer . This stood in contrast to the predictions of early detractors , including rival manufacturers who dismissed Toyota as incapable of producing a competitive luxury vehicle . Japanese contemporaries from the luxury divisions of Honda ( Acura ) and Nissan ( Infiniti ) had differing degrees of success . Honda had entered into a joint venture with Britain 's Austin Rover Group in November 1981 , launching Project XX with an Austin Rover – Honda XX letter of intent to replace the Rover SD1 with the Rover 800 and to provide a midsize , V6 @-@ powered luxury sedan for Honda , called the Honda Legend . Marketed as the Acura Legend in the U.S. , the sedan initially sold well , but subsequent models ( renamed Acura RL ) performed below sales expectations . Launched by Nissan in December 1989 , the V8 @-@ powered Infiniti Q45 closely rivaled the LS 400 in specifications and price , but was unsuccessful in sales ( attributed to unconventional styling and marketing ) , leading to its discontinuation in 2006 . The success of the Lexus LS became a test case for mainstream manufacturers targeting upscale segments . By investing in a separate marque , Toyota was able to avoid the stigma attached to a mass @-@ market brand 's charging premium prices . The effect of the LS 400 on the automotive industry led Automobile Magazine to add the sedan to its " 24 Most Important Vehicles of the 20th Century " list in 1996 .

 In its largest market , the U.S. , the Lexus LS was the top @-@ selling flagship luxury sedan for 15 of the first 17 years following its debut . In Japan , the next @-@ largest market for the Lexus LS , the introduction of the 2007 LS 460 attracted 12 @,@ 000 pre @-@ orders , and the Lexus LS has gone on to sell successfully in its class . Following the introduction of the LS 460 and Lexus ' expanded global launch in 2007 , sales of the Lexus flagship have increasingly come from outside the brand 's traditional U.S. strongholds . By 2007 , the Lexus LS ranked second globally in flagship sales , next to the Mercedes @-@ Benz S @-@ Class ' 85 @,@ 500 units , with 71 @,@ 760 Lexus LS sedans sold worldwide , and over half the total coming from outside the U.S. market . In 2008 , U.S. sales fell 42 % amidst the late @-@ 2000s recession , mirroring the overall decline of the luxury car market . 
 The Lexus LS has not sold as well in Europe , where Lexus suffers from smaller brand recognition , image , and a less @-@ developed dealership network . In European markets such as the Czech Republic , the Lexus LS has ranked behind Mercedes @-@ Benz , Audi , and BMW in flagship luxury car sales . Automotive analysts have suggested a possible rationale for the sales disparity , in that European buyers place less emphasis on vehicle reliability and have more brand loyalty to established domestic marques . In contrast , the Lexus LS has ranked second in sales to the Mercedes @-@ Benz S @-@ Class ( and ahead of rivals from BMW , Audi , and Jaguar ) in markets outside Europe , such as South Africa .

 = Blair Waldorf = 
 Blair Cornelia Waldorf is the main character of Gossip Girl , introduced in the original series of novels and also appearing in the television and manga adaptations . Described as " a girl of extremes " by creator Cecily von Ziegesar , she is a comical overachiever who possesses both snobbish and sensitive sides . Due to her position as queen bee of Manhattan 's social scene , Blair 's actions and relations are under constant scrutiny from the mysterious Gossip Girl , a popular blogger . 
 Leighton Meester , who portrayed the character in the television drama , has described Blair as being insecure about her social status . At times , this anxiety creates flaws and complexities which contribute to character development . In Meester 's view , the true Blair is ultimately a " good girl " at heart . 
 Blair has been compared to vintage film and literary figures , including Becky Sharp and Lizzie Eustace . Meester 's portrayal has also drawn comparisons to roles played by Joan Collins and Audrey Hepburn . She is the most critically acclaimed character of the franchise , while the television character has drawn real @-@ life attention surrounding fashion and her love life .

 Gossip Girl is a series of novels about socially prominent young adults in New York City . The story primarily follows Blair Waldorf and her best friend Serena van der Woodsen during their years in high school and college . Due to her fame on the Upper East Side , Blair is featured on the website of " Gossip Girl , " an anonymous gossip blogger whose posts appear occasionally throughout the story . 
 = = = Novel series = = = 
 In the first book , Blair is introduced as a privileged , comically vain overachiever . She is described as an alluring brunette , and occasionally models her appearance and demeanor after famous actresses , including Marilyn Monroe and , most often , Audrey Hepburn . In early novels , the character is also written as bulimic . 
 Blair is largely motivated by matters surrounding family , romance , and ambition . However , her tendency to overachieve can lead to feelings of paranoia , with dramatic or comical results . In a review for The New Yorker , Janet Malcolm remarked that Blair 's issues made her " both a broader caricature and a more real person " than the other Gossip Girl characters . In a 2009 interview , Gossip Girl creator Cecily von Ziegesar claimed to identify with Blair the most , stating , " She is so unpredictable and dramatic . Such a bitch , but we understand why she is a bitch and we like her anyway " .

 Throughout most of the series ' run , Blair grapples with a number of changes within her family . Two years prior to the opening novel , Blair 's parents divorced after her father ran off with another man . When her mother remarries , and her father leaves the country , Blair has difficulty accepting her stepfather . In addition , her stress over these matters occasionally affects her other relationships . However , Blair ultimately remains close to her father Harold , who she often turns to for comfort . By contrast , she maintains a somewhat tenser relationship with her mother Eleanor . It is also revealed that Blair has struggled with bulimia . 
 In the opening novel , Blair learns of an affair between her friend Serena and her boyfriend Nate . This marks the beginning of the story 's primary love triangle , which recurs throughout the series . Blair 's romantic life has various effects on her character development . After Nate repeatedly hurts her , she eventually refuses to take him back until she believes in his ability to commit to her . In pursuing Nate , however , Blair herself cheats on her new boyfriend Pete , which results in her losing both of them . She eventually begins to acknowledge her mistakes , with her father 's help . She later grows closer to Chuck Bass ( which initially occurred in the series ' television adaptation ) , who she 'd previously known for years , which leads them to briefly date one another . 
 Blair is noted for an over @-@ achieving nature , which often appears in humorous scenes . In a review for New York magazine , Emily Nussbaum lauded one of Blair 's fantasies , which involves " joining the Peace Corps , getting a killer tan , winning the Nobel Peace Prize , and having dinner with the president , ' who would then write her a recommendation to Yale , and then Yale would fall all over themselves to accept her . ' " The New Yorker 's Janet Malcolm remarked that unlike some of her forerunners in film and literature , " Blair already has all the money and position anyone could want . She is pure naked striving , restlessly seeking an object , any object , and never knowing when enough is enough . " 
 Blair encounters a setback during her interview at Yale by revealing the recent stress in her life , and then kissing her interviewer on the cheek upon dismissal . Her father then makes a donation to the school , though Blair is still wait @-@ listed . In the twelfth book , I Will Always Love You , it is revealed that she has been admitted to the university . 
 In addition to her feelings for Nate , Blair is sometimes said to feel competitive with Serena in other areas , including matters of beauty and popularity . This also leads to an occasional envy on Blair 's part . It is unclear how much of Blair 's perception of Serena is in line with reality ; the narrative describes both characters as " hands down the two hottest girls on the Upper East Side , and maybe all of Manhattan , or even the whole world . "

 In 2007 , Gossip Girl was adapted for television . According to Cecily von Ziegesar , the television character is largely faithful to the original . Among the aspects to be maintained are her admiration for Audrey Hepburn and her interest in Yale University . However , the series is also noted for its deviations from the source material , including the exclusion of Blair 's brother Tyler . The show also explores romances between Blair and multiple male leads , resulting in occasional love triangles . In the fifth season , Blair is revealed to be pregnant . 
 Among fans and the media , Blair 's bond with Chuck Bass was commonly known by the portmanteau " Chair " , while her relationship with Dan Humphrey was referred to as " Dair " . The nicknames and viewer interest in these relationships were recognized by the show 's producers .

 To prepare for the part of Blair , actress Leighton Meester , a natural blonde , dyed her hair brown before auditioning , and also studied the first novel . She has described the character as multi @-@ faceted , labeling her " a little bit of everything which is pretty amazing . " Like von Ziegesar , Meester has also claimed to relate to Blair on certain levels . Prior to the show 's debut in 2007 , the actress stated that , " The only way to play Blair , or any character , and make her human , is to find what she is inside me . And I know I have my insecurities , too . " She went on to say that , " The way Blair and I are not alike when it comes to insecurities is : She pays so much attention to hers ! " Meester 's casting was described by Yahoo ! as a star @-@ making role which moved her " into the pop culture vanguard , " while Cecily von Ziegesar has called her a perfect choice . 
 In December 2010 , Meester revealed plans to leave the show in 2012 . E ! Online and other outlets speculated that her departure would possibly mark the end of the series .

 Amidst the fourth season , the romance between Dan and Blair became a polarizing topic among viewers which also drew significant media interest . Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post applauded the development , feeling that Blair had " more chemistry " with Dan than with Chuck . New York magazine 's Chris Rovzar called Blair and Dan 's story line " believable " , citing their common ground in education and taste . Rovzar further stated , " Since they live in a world where both only seem to have half a dozen real friends ( if that ) , is it so crazy they 'd end up together ? " Their first kiss was included in TV Guide 's Top TV Moments of 2011 . Dawn Fallik of The Wall Street Journal was less positive , asserting that " both characters have been so <unk> that there ’ s no fun left in the show . " A writer for E ! Online 's Team <unk> labeled the Dan / Blair relationship " <unk> nonsense " . 
 With regard to Chuck and Blair , Meester stated , " I can really relate to it — not necessarily because it 's this dramatic , tumultuous relationship , but because the way they love each other is very real , and not for the sake of being dramatic . It 's actual love . There 's nobody for each other but them . " Meester also expressed fondness for Dan and Blair , however , stating , " I think they 're good for each other in a lot of ways , in a way that Chuck and Blair aren 't . " 
 Producers initially noticed chemistry between Blair and Dan in the Season 1 episode " Bad News Blair " . According to producer Joshua Safran , the creators planned to revisit their relationship once the timing was right . Safran also stated that the outcome wasn 't necessarily decided ahead of time . " One thing we are very conscious of — and I know some fans get upset about this — is we really try to treat the characters as living , breathing , well @-@ rounded individuals . And we 're often surprised by where their journeys take them ; they open new doors for us all the time , " he said .

 Following the twentieth episode of Season 4 , Safran spoke on behalf of the series regarding the scene in which Chuck became violent with Blair . 
 In response to these comments , Carina MacKenzie of Zap2it stated , " We 're left wondering if Safran missed the part where she went home bleeding because Chuck was using physical intimidation to release his own emotions . " While reviewing the episode , Tierney Bricker of Zap2it felt that there were " really no excuses for Chuck Bass anymore . " MacKenzie concluded that Chuck 's behavior throughout Season 4 fit the signs of an abusive relationship , citing examples from <unk> , a non @-@ profit health resource . She noted Chuck 's public humiliation of Blair , his attempt to pawn her during a business deal , and his use of physical intimidation . MacKenzie also called the show 's explanation " disturbing , particularly given the young , female target demographic of Gossip Girl and The CW . " 
 In a review for the Los Angeles Times , Judy Berman addressed Safran 's description of Blair during the scene . " Considering how terrified Blair looked at the end of their encounter , and how quickly she got out of there , the show is sending a mixed message at best . " She went on to state , " We have no right to expect Gossip Girl to be a paragon of morality , or even realism , but the idea that true love requires taking a shard of glass to the face is disturbing even in this alternate , soap @-@ opera dimension .

 While covering the book series , Janet Malcolm of The New Yorker labeled the character " an antiheroine of the first rank , " and asserted that " the series belongs to awful Blair , who inspires von Ziegesar 's highest flights of comic fancy . " She also compared Blair to vintage film and literary figures such as Becky Sharp of Vanity Fair , and Lizzie Eustace of The Eustace Diamonds . In addition , the character has drawn comparisons to notable contemporaries , including Lila Fowler of the Sweet Valley High series . 
 In the 2007 book Children 's Literature and Culture , writer Harry Edwin <unk> chastised the depiction of Blair 's bulimia . " If handled properly , the inclusion of her illness could have provided a powerful lesson for young adult readers who worry about their weight and food consumption . Unfortunately , Cecily von Ziegesar , the author of the series , presents a seriously flawed treatment of the problem . In a failed attempt at humor , the writer regards Blair 's sickness as just another source of gossip , " he said . Emily Nussbaum of New York magazine had similar comments , calling the bulimia " more of an icky weakness than a full @-@ fledged pathology .

 Julie of Manga Maniac Cafe gave the initial Gossip Girl manga a negative review , citing displeasure with the characters and plot .

She went on to state that " Blair is one character that is fun to hate on . So imagine my surprise when I actually started to like her by the end of the book " .

 = Vic Fontaine = 
 Vic Fontaine is a fictional character who appeared in the sixth season onwards of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . Portrayed by James Darren , he is a holographic representation of a 1960s @-@ era Las Vegas Rat Pack @-@ style singer and entertainer , as part of a program run in the holosuites at Quark 's bar . The character was developed from an idea by executive producer Ira Steven Behr , who had sought to introduce a character of that type during the fourth season to be played by Frank Sinatra , Jr . ; however , after Sinatra turned down the role , it was considered during the following season to be played by Steve Lawrence , but once again it was not used . Darren landed the role after Behr met him at a memorabilia show in North Hollywood and had him invited to audition . 
 The character made his first appearance in the episode " His Way " , and returned later in the sixth season in " Tears of the Prophets " and throughout the seventh season . Fontaine represented a source of romantic advice for the crew , helping to get Odo ( René Auberjonois ) and Kira Nerys ( Nana Visitor ) together as well as aiding Quark ( Armin Shimerman ) and Julian Bashir ( Alexander Siddig ) to move on from their love of Jadzia Dax ( Terry Farrell ) . He also helps Nog ( Aron Eisenberg ) to recover from the loss of his leg in " It 's Only a Paper Moon " . Returning the favor in " Badda @-@ Bing Badda @-@ Bang " , the crew help Fontaine get his bar back after it is taken over by the American Mafia . The crew return to the bar one final time in the series finale , " What You Leave Behind " , for the celebration party following the victory over the Dominion . 
 The character received a mixed reception from both critics and the public . While episodes such as " His Way " and " It 's Only a Paper Moon " were praised , " Badda @-@ Bing Badda @-@ Bang " was said by Charlie Jane Anders to be one of the worst holodeck @-@ related episodes of the franchise . But the character itself was praised by critics , who specifically said that the premise should not have worked but did , due to both the writing and Darren 's performances . 
 = = Concept and development = = 
 Executive producer Ira Steven Behr had long sought to introduce a Rat Pack @-@ style character to Star Trek : Deep Space Nine since the fourth season , as he was a lifelong fan of 1960s @-@ era Las Vegas and the music of that period . The initial idea was that the character would be someone who could give out romantic advice , and that it would not appear in every episode but only as and when it was needed . In preparation , Behr and Robert Hewitt Wolfe wrote a scene in order to flesh out the character , while Behr immediately had a performer in mind to play the new character : Frank Sinatra , Jr . , a known fan of Star Trek . Casting director Ron Surma got in touch with Sinatra , who thought that it would be a funny idea . However , in discussions with Behr , it became apparently that Sinatra wanted to play an alien and not the singer character they had in mind . Because of this setback , the idea was shelved for the time being . 
 During the production of the fifth season episode " A Simple Investigation " , it was decided to insert the scene that Behr and Wolfe had previously created . Behr mused at the time that while Sinatra might not want to portray the character , perhaps someone similar to Steve Lawrence would . Behr named the character Vic Fontaine , a combination of two names he had been planning to use for some time . It was not until some time later that Behr realized a similarity in naming between the new character and one from the 1972 film The Godfather . But Lawrence was unavailable and the scene proved too long to be included in the episode , so once again the idea was put on hold . Behr was unsure how to write the character into the show until it became apparent that it could be included as part of the Odo / Kira Nerys relationship after Kira found out about Odo 's feelings for her in the episode " Children of Time " . Rather than film an individual scene , he decided that an entire 1960s @-@ era Las Vegas themed episode should be created , resulting in the production of " His Way " . 
 = = = " His Way " = = = 
 Several people were interviewed for the part , including Tom Jones , Robert Goulet , and Jerry Vale . Meanwhile , Behr and a friend attended a memorabilia show at the Beverly Garland Hotel in North Hollywood , where James Darren was signing autographs . Darren had not wanted to attend the event , but was convinced otherwise . Behr thought he was so charming that he wanted to talk to him about the role on the spot , but his friend talked him out of it as he felt that Darren would think he was insane . Surma got in touch with Darren at Behr 's prompting . Darren initially rejected the role , having heard that the part was a singer . But Darren 's agent went back to him three times and convinced him to read the script , which is when he fell in love with the character . He later called it a " dream come true " . 
 Darren came in for casting and began talking about knowing where to source the appropriate tuxedos , and that he could wear a pair of Dean Martin 's shoes that he owned . During the course of the meeting , Behr suddenly realized that Darren was performing the Fontaine piece , having moved into it seamlessly . Darren had deliberately avoiding simply reading the script , as he disliked doing cold reads ; instead , he had intentionally improvising things that he felt that the character would say . After Darren left , Behr excitedly told the other writers how good he was , but that perhaps they should still see other actors . Producer Hans Beimler replied , " Are you out of your mind ? What are you talking about ? Vic Fontaine was just in the room . There 's no question , there 's no question ! He 's the guy ! " 
 Darren was subsequently hired for the role . He felt that Fontaine was a combination of Martin and Frank Sinatra , and found that a mention by the character to travelling with that duo to Vegas in the " His Way " script caused him to think about the past , as he had travelled with Sinatra , Jr. and Nancy Sinatra in Sinatra 's private plane to Las Vegas to see Sinatra and Martin play at the Sands Hotel and Casino on several occasions . At the time , Darren was unsure whether it was to be a recurring role or not , but had enjoyed the experience . Darren was brought back as Fontaine for the final episode of the season , " Tears of the Prophets " , and several times throughout season seven . 
 = = Appearances = = 
 Vic Fontaine is first introduced in the episode " His Way " as a self @-@ aware and romantically insightful hologram which forms part of a new Rat Pack @-@ style Las Vegas bar program owned by Doctor Julian Bashir ( Alexander Siddig ) . Several of the main crew are present for his performance of " You 're Nobody till Somebody Loves You " . Afterwards , Odo ( René Auberjonois ) seeks some advice in private from Fontaine about his feelings for Kira Nerys ( Nana Visitor ) . The hologram helps Odo practice with another hologram that looks like Kira but does not act correctly , but Odo finds that when the real version returns to the station that they can barely interact . Fontaine transfers himself into Kira 's meditation holo @-@ program and invites her to dinner ; curious , she accepts . Fontaine invites Odo back to his program , saying that the holo @-@ Kira now acts exactly like her . The two get together in the holodeck and the date goes well until Odo reveals that he thinks that the real Kira is actually a hologram . The ruse revealed , both look accusingly at Fontaine and leave . But once outside on the promenade , the duo begin to argue , resulting in Odo kissing Kira . 
 During the second appearance of the character in " Tears of the Prophets " , Bashir and Quark ( Armin Shimerman ) run Fontaine 's program in an attempt to cheer themselves up after realising that they will never have a chance with Jadzia Dax ( Terry Farrell ) because of her relationship with Worf ( Michael Dorn ) . The hologram advises them to move on with their lives . In the first episode of the seventh season , " Image in the Sand " , Worf is mourning the death of Jadzia . He goes to Fontaine and asks him to sing the Frank Sinatra song " All the Way " . Fontaine sings the song reluctantly , and partway through , Worf begins to destroy the bar in his grief @-@ stricken rage . At the start of " The Siege of AR @-@ 558 " , Fontaine auditions Rom ( Max Grodénchik ) as a new lounge singer . He does not get the job . Later , while the Federation troops are under siege by the Jem 'Hadar , Bashir plays Fontaine 's recording of " I 'll Be Seeing You " over a sound system to raise morale . As a result of him losing his leg during the siege , in " It 's Only a Paper Moon " , Nog ( Aron Eisenberg ) keeps playing that song in private upon his return to Deep Space Nine . He goes to the holosuite to play the Fontaine program , and begins to rely on it , effectively moving into the holosuite permanently . 
 Ezri Dax ( Nicole de Boer ) , the station 's counselor , has concerns with Nog living in a fictional world and speaks to Fontaine , who explains that he has a plan to rectify the situation . Fontaine convinces Nog that the bar is in trouble and he needs some help with the accounts ; the Ferengi uses his business knowledge to help the hologram . Fontaine befriends Nog and after a while tries to convince him to return to the outside world following prompting by Ezri . Nog refuses to leave , resulting in Fontaine shutting down his program and refusing to let it restart . Fontaine appears to Nog in an otherwise empty holosuite , and Nog confesses that his injury has made him fear death and the ongoing war with the Dominion . Fontaine counsels Nog , who feels strong enough to leave the holosuite and return to duty . Shortly after he resumes his role back on the station , Nog returns to Fontaine to inform him that he has convinced Quark to leave the program running continuously to allow Vic to have a life of his own . 
 A possible Mirror Universe version of Vic Fontaine appears in " The Emperor 's New Cloak " . This version of Fontaine appears to be human ( no explanation for this is given ) , and is shot dead during a phaser battle . Fontaine is forced out of his club in " Badda @-@ Bing Badda @-@ Bang " by the American Mafia , who turn it into a casino . The rest of the crew want Fontaine 's bar back the way it was , and are faced with either resetting the program and losing the hologram 's memory of the crew or playing along with the story and returning the bar to Vic . So Captain Benjamin Sisko ( Avery Brooks ) leads a team to steal the casino 's takings . Upon their success , the program restores the bar to the way it was , and Fontaine celebrates by singing " The Best Is Yet to Come " to the crew . During the finale of Deep Space Nine , " What You Leave Behind " , Quark passes the time during the attack on Cardassia Prime by playing Go Fish with Fontaine . Later , after the victory and the defeat of the Dominion , the crew return to Vic 's bar for a celebratory party .

 The character of Vic Fontaine was received with mixed reviews by both critics and the public . While Keith DeCandido disliked the idea of the Fontaine program in his review of " His Way " for Tor.com , saying that " It 's silly , it 's frivolous , it raises all kinds of ethical conundrums that the show never shows the remotest interest in investigating " , he said that he enjoyed Darren 's performance , which caused him to smile every time Darren spoke . Zack Handlen praised the 1960s scenes in " His Way " for The A.V. Club , saying that it " isn 't as entirely ridiculous as it sounds , and the fact that it works even remotely is a testament to the actors and the script " . 
 Charlie Jane Anders described Fontaine as a " less cool Guinan " in her criticism of " Badda @-@ Bing Badda @-@ Bang " . The episode was included in her list of the worst holodeck @-@ related episodes of the Star Trek franchise , but added that she was a fan of " It 's Only a Paper Moon " . That episode was ranked as the third best of the series by Gem Wheeler for Den of Geek , who called Fontaine the " ideal holographic host " on the show . The character was named the sixth best thing about Deep Space Nine in a list of highlights by <unk> in 2015 . 
 = Dude Ranch ( album ) = 
 Dude Ranch is the second studio album by American pop punk band Blink @-@ 182 . Recorded at Big Fish Studios in Encinitas , California with producer Mark Trombino , the album was released in the United States on June 17 , 1997 , jointly through independent label Cargo Music and major label MCA Records . MCA signed the band in 1996 following moderate sales of their debut Cheshire Cat ( 1995 ) and growing popularity of the trio in Australia . Dude Ranch was the band 's final recording released on Cargo and their last with original drummer Scott Raynor before he was dismissed from the band in 1998 . 
 The band recorded the album during the winter of 1996 – 1997 . With lyrical material written on the band 's nonstop tours over the previous years , as well as completed songs , the band recorded with Trombino in sessions that lasted for five weeks . During the production for Dude Ranch , the members of Blink @-@ 182 were plagued with difficulties only made worse by the rushed schedule : bassist Mark Hoppus and guitarist Tom DeLonge , co @-@ vocalists for the band , were having vocal problems and Raynor had to record his drum tracks with both heels broken , on crutches . 
 Promoted by lead single " Dammit " , the record was released in the summer of 1997 and was a success . " Dammit " became a rock radio hit single and helped the band gain mainstream credibility as they toured worldwide on the Vans Warped Tour . The band toured exhaustively behind the album , creating tensions which led to the firing of Raynor in mid @-@ 1998 . Three more singles were released , with " Josie " gathering MTV play and charting highly in Australia . Dude Ranch eventually grew in sales and was certified platinum in the US by the end of the decade .

 After moderate sales of their debut album Cheshire Cat ( 1995 ) , released on independent record label Cargo Music , Blink @-@ 182 enjoyed a small amount of success . Throughout 1994 and 1995 , the trio vigorously toured nonstop and grew in popularity , mostly in Australia , where audiences embraced the band 's irreverent sense of humor and stage shows . When the trio grew frustrated when fans lamented the inability to purchase Cheshire Cat at their respective local record stores , they began to turn toward other record labels to achieve wider distribution than Cargo . By the end of 1995 , problems had become apparent between the trio and the label , who regarded the band as a joke not to be taken seriously . 
 The San Diego trio did however accumulate a genuine buzz among major labels , and a bidding war for the band began in March 1996 . Several labels courted the band , sending A & R reps to shows and inviting the band to stop by the office for lunch meetings . Through the several labels interested , Blink @-@ 182 seriously considered Interscope , Epitaph , and MCA Records ( the latter of which had just purchased Interscope and was in the process of buying Cargo ) . The band spent much time during the spring and summer of 1996 contemplating options . The three had no qualms signing to a major label , and were wary of purists attempting to define " punk " . The band felt a great affinity for Epitaph , as many of their favorite acts ( Pennywise , The Vandals , NOFX ) were signed there . The band felt they were nothing but honest regarding their ambitions : " I try and tell kids , ' The Clash , Sex Pistols and the Ramones did it , so how come we can 't ? " guitarist Tom DeLonge reasoned . " If people are bummed , we don 't care . It 's normally critics . Older critics . " 
 MCA at the time was riding out a dead spell , and was derisively referred to in the music industry as MCA — Musicians ' Cemetery of America . Despite this , MCA 's persistence and sincerity won the band over , as well as their promise of complete artistic freedom . The trio signed a joint venture deal with MCA to distribute their sophomore album with Cargo . Drummer Scott Raynor was happy for the band 's signing , but was uneasy with signing to a major label — he much preferred Epitaph , and when the band passed over the label , he began to feel only half @-@ invested in the band . Raynor was not , however , difficult about the band 's mainstream growth : " I didn 't measure success in terms of oppositional credibility . I loved being on the radio and MTV . We were certified products of pop culture , born and bred in suburbia . " Thanks to the band 's established fan base and merchandising , MCA did not intervene much in the band 's activities . Although the label had granted the band artistic freedom in their contract , MCA did step in and warn the band when they planned to feature a spoof of the " Macarena " on Dude Ranch , humorously titled " Hey Wipe Your Anus " . 
 The trio released two 7 @-@ inch EP recordings with Cargo during the interim . By the summer of 1996 , " Wasting Time " had been released as a single to keep matters moving along <unk> . The track was the final single from the Cheshire Cat sessions , and the band would soon return to their native home state to record a follow @-@ up . Before recording of the album began , the band booked time at DML Studios in Escondido , California , where they perfected the songs for Dude Ranch . Most of the lyrics for the album had been written over 1995 and 1996 , while touring . " I remember writing most of those songs in my living room , sitting on a curb , whatever , " recalled DeLonge in 2001 . " Back then , each song was pretty much written with a specific girl or event in mind . "

 Blink @-@ 182 entered Big Fish Studios in Rancho Santa Fe , California in December 1996 to record Dude Ranch . Big Fish was a converted guesthouse which had just survived a wildfire months before . However , the gloomy atmosphere did not faze Blink @-@ 182 at all , and what was a tragedy to local individuals became fodder for jokes for the group ; bassist Mark Hoppus had just bought a new video camera and he filmed stunts with guitarist Tom DeLonge on the burnt landscape in spare time such as having Mark run around naked as Tom explained to the camera what happened in the fire and that it 's " Mating Season " . Thanks to improved economics , the band had more time in the studio to record the album they wanted to make . The trio were listening to music such as Jawbreaker , Bad Religion and Lagwagon , setting the backdrop for the recordings under guidance of Mark Trombino , who provided additional piano and keyboards on Dude Ranch . The trio picked Trombino based on his work he had done on Jimmy Eat World 's Static <unk> ( 1996 ) . The group spent much time trying to get Trombino to laugh at their antics , to no avail . Hoppus ' sister , Anne Hoppus , described Trombino as very quiet and " very much his own person . " In addition to the record , Trombino produced " I Won 't Be Home for Christmas " , a holiday song recorded during the Dude Ranch sessions . 
 Despite the creative boom while writing lyrics for the album , all three members of Blink @-@ 182 faced setbacks while recording Dude Ranch . DeLonge was having vocal problems and spent much time recording and re @-@ recording vocal tracks , and Hoppus realized he too was having difficulty singing after losing his voice during a one @-@ off Christmas concert . Forced to cancel the final week of recording in December 1996 , Hoppus realized the magnitude of the situation and quit smoking in order to take care of his voice , which was stressed due to lack of vocal warm @-@ ups , full days of vocal tracks , and the strain of singing for " Dammit " , which was accidentally written just outside Hoppus ' vocal range . Meanwhile , Raynor had broken both heels and was in a wheelchair . Raynor was well enough to record the drum tracks for the album while on crutches . Aside from the recording , the band spent time playing Crash Bandicoot and " reading the articles from the shelves and shelves of Playboys that the studio had thoughtfully provided . " The group ate lunch nearly each day at Sombrero , a local Mexican restaurant <unk> in " Josie " , and Chinese for dinner from Encinitas ' Pick Up <unk> . 
 It would be January 1997 until the band would be able to wrap up sessions for Dude Ranch , eventually amounting to five weeks of recording . For the final touches , Unwritten Law frontman Scott Russo donated a few vocal tracks to " Josie " , and Trombino let Blink @-@ 182 record a couple of jokes between songs using his sound @-@ effects machine . The group contacted Fletcher <unk> of Pennywise to find someone to remix a few tracks from the album , and he suggested Donnell Cameron of Track Recording Studios . The band went in to Track and re @-@ recorded Raynor 's drum tracks for several songs . Hoppus recalled " I remember when we finished Dude Ranch I was so proud . That was the first time we could take the time and whatever to make a good record . " Representatives from MCA dropped by on occasion and were excited by the material they heard . " When we were in there mixing , the A & R person would come by , " remembered Cameron . " I don 't think the band really knew what they had but certainly the label knew they had so many good songs on the record . " DeLonge remembered it differently : " [ Label executives ] fucking hated pop @-@ punk . They wanted nothing to do with it . They were into Pavement or whatever . " After production completed , the album was mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood .

 According to music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine , Dude Ranch is an album of " juvenile , adrenaline @-@ fueled punk @-@ pop . " Billboard magazine 's Doug Reece described it as " a collection of machine @-@ gun @-@ quick , energetic punk songs — sometimes with a puerile slant — about such topics as girlfriends , broken hearts , and fights with one 's parents . " At Alternative Press , it was characterized as a " killer skate @-@ punk record " . Greg Simpsons at Punknews.org agreed with the skate punk label , stating that the album " set blueprint for their style of poppy , goofy skate punk that they would later bring to the masses . DeLonge considered the album a step up in terms of songwriting , with " Dammit " proving the breakthrough . 
 " Pathetic " is a tale of " abject self @-@ pity in the face of collapsed relationship . " The distinctive riff of " Dammit " was created when Hoppus was forced to skip over the missing two strings on an acoustic guitar . The song 's themes include maturity and the refrain , " Well I guess this is growing up . " " Dick Lips " was named after an insult bandied around at Big Fish during recording . It was written about DeLonge 's experience when he was kicked out of Poway High School for showing up to a basketball game while intoxicated . " <unk> " was a word Hoppus created while belching , prompting him to name the song with it . " Untitled " is inspired by the emerging ska punk scene , and " Emo " by its namesake , which is partly a tribute to DeLonge 's favorite band , Jimmy Eat World . 
 " Apple Shampoo " was inspired by Elyse Rogers of Dance Hall Crashers , whom Hoppus dated ; the title is culled from a particular brand of shampoo she often used . " Josie " makes further reference to Dance Hall Crashers and the band Unwritten Law ( " My girlfriend likes UL and DHC " ) . " A New Hope " takes the standard rock subject matter of a hopeless crush and rewrites it with details of the Star Wars series . The original Star Wars trilogy were popular during Hoppus ' childhood into the late 1970s and early 1980s , and a theatrical re @-@ release in the late 1990s reinvigorated interest in the series . " Degenerate " is a re @-@ recording of a track that first appeared on the band 's demo cassette Demo # 2 . " Lemmings " is another re @-@ recorded track , which had previously only been available on a 7 @-@ inch . The band felt the song was strong enough that it should not be limited to those owning record players . 
 The cover art , a collage by Lou Beach , features a bull with the band 's name branded on its rear end , while the packaging is decorated by images of the band as cowboys on a " dude ranch " . The gatefold packaging features a painting stating " Greetings from the Blink @-@ 182 Dude Ranch , " which was intended to be a pastiche of both " cheesy postcards " and a parody of Bruce Springsteen 's Greetings from Asbury Park , <unk> .. Art direction for the album was headed by Tim Stedman , with Stedman and graphic designer Ashley <unk> designing the package . The disc art , a revolver chamber , was designed by artist Victor Gastelum , while the band photography was done by Steven Shea . DeLonge recalled in 2012 that the only " bad " aspect of Dude Ranch in retrospect were the jokes found within the inside artwork : " I remember sitting at the Sombrero taco shop going , ' Fuck , we ’ ve got to finish off our album cover , let ’ s just write some jokes to these cowboy pictures . ' Why did we do that ? We should have had better jokes for those pictures . "

 Dude Ranch was released on June 17 , 1997 , through Cargo Music . The record , at first , largely passed without notice from audiences outside their established fan base . With fan support and the trio touring nonstop , the album 's sales began to improve . The momentum from touring helped Dude Ranch sell 3 @,@ 000 – 4 @,@ 000 units a week , and the record sold 40 @,@ 000 copies by August . Dude Ranch was promoted by the label through board @-@ sport magazines and tie @-@ ins between surf shops and record retailers . At retail , MCA and Cargo organized midnight sales promotions on the West Coast . The popularity of the trio in Australia has been cited as the sign that alerted major record companies of Dude Ranch 's commercial potential ; at the time , Dude Ranch had spent five months on the charts and the band became famous for their staged show while on the 1997 Warped Tour . Thanks to increased recognition , the band dropped Cargo and fully signed with MCA in 1998 to handle increased distribution . Hardcore punk purists asserted the band were betraying their indie roots by even considering major label proposals and began to address the band as " sell @-@ outs " . 
 Sales improved considerably when the record 's lead single , " Dammit " , began making rounds at rock radio . MCA 's marketing strategy involved waiting until after the band 's Warped Tour performances wrapped in order to have a retail story to back up radio promotion efforts . The label first serviced " Dammit " in August 1997 and several SoCal stations were quick to pick up the single , finding it to be a good match alongside Green Day and The Offspring radio hits . The song was added to the playlist of Los Angeles @-@ based radio station KROQ , after which the song began to be played across the country . Mainstream rock received " Dammit " in November , and MTV picked up the " Dammit " video , bumping it into stress rotation in December . This led to feature stories in magazines such as Billboard and Rolling Stone . Radio @-@ wise , " Dammit " achieved great commercial success , peaking at number 11 on the US charts in 1998 . The year @-@ end Billboard Airplay Monitor Report ( BDS ) stats indicated that " Dammit " earned top spins at many key radio stations . In addition , its success knocked Dude Ranch onto the album Billboard 200 album chart for the first time , where it peaked at number 67 in February 1998 . 
 Dude Ranch , which became the trio 's first gold record in January 1998 , yielded three more singles , which did not attract the same commercial success as " Dammit " . " Apple Shampoo " was the second single release from Dude Ranch , released in October 1997 . " Although it didn 't have the impact of " Dammit " , it hardly mattered as the former was still receiving heavy play on radio and TV stations across the nation " , wrote journalist Joe Shooman . " Dick Lips " was released in February 1998 but failed to register on charts . " Josie " became the record 's fourth and final single in November 1998 . Its music video also received MTV airplay and the single charted at number 31 in Australia . For the single release of both " Dammit " and " Josie " , the songs were remixed and remastered by Tom Lord @-@ Alge . The unreleased Dude Ranch cut " I Won 't Be Home for Christmas " was released as an international single in 2001 , only successful in Canada , but charting for six non @-@ consecutive weeks at number one . Dude Ranch was certified platinum for the first time in 1999 .

 Dude Ranch was released when the band was only achieving moderate success , therefore very few critical reviews of the record were published in 1997 . A CMJ write @-@ up commented , " Dude Ranch has the hooks and sonic wallop to rocket Blink @-@ 182 into stadiums throughout the nation . " British rock magazine Kerrang ! published an early review , albeit negative : the reviewer laments the disc 's " little depth , passion , soul and even vaguely memorable hooks . " Later reviews were subsequently more positive . Rolling Stone regarded Dude Ranch as the moment the trio focused and refined their pop punk sound , summarizing the record 's themes : " bassist Mark Hoppus plays the straight man , singing sturdily and deadpan , while the <unk> @-@ voiced Guitarist Tom DeLonge bleats urgently about romance gone wrong . " In 2007 , Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic attributed the album 's unique sound to the band 's young age at the time , commenting " Ten years ago , blink @-@ 182 were just breaking through as a young band whose sound was a bit rough around the edges , not too polished or refined yet . [ … ] On Dude Ranch , blink @-@ 182 were kids being kids , and that ’ s precisely what they should have been doing . " The website AbsolutePunk placed the album on their " Absolute Classics " list in February 2009 , calling it a " classic mix " that was successful due to timing . In 2011 , Total Guitar referred to the record as " a genuine modern punk classic . " Alternative Press called Dude Ranch a " quantum leap in sonic quality and songwriting . " 
 Trevor Kelley of Alternative Press credited the album for " reigniting " the pop punk movement while calling it a " huge source of inspiration for a new generation of bands , " such as Midtown and New Found Glory . Panic ! at the Disco guitarist Ryan Ross has cited the album as his first influence : " I wanted to learn how to play like Tom DeLonge . "

 Beginning in the summer of 1997 , Blink @-@ 182 would enter an extended period of touring . The group had played a handful of dates on the Vans Warped Tour 1996 , a lifestyle tour promoting skateboarding and punk rock music . However , upon Dude Ranch 's release and popularity , Blink @-@ 182 would play every date of the 1997 tour worldwide with influences Pennywise , NOFX , and Social Distortion . " The Warped Tour is really more of a traveling @-@ band barbecue , " commented DeLonge . " You hang out with the other bands all day , you play your set , and then hang out again . " In late 1997 and early 1998 , the band would be on the road for nine months straight , only coming home to San Diego for days at a time before striking out on the next tour . " When we did our longest tour stretch , it was right when I started dating my fiancee , " recalled DeLonge . " We were all new and in love , and I had to leave . It was just , ' Hey , I 'll see you in nine months . ' It was really hard . " In addition to the hefty touring schedule , the trio grew tired of other commitments , including interviews and TV appearances due to the success of " Dammit " . 
 Desperate for a break , the overworked band began to argue and tensions formed . Raynor , who was at the center of this drama , had been commenting of his desire to attend college for years , and had been taking homework out with him on tour to try and complete his high school diploma . The tension came to a head in February 1998 as the band embarked on SnoCore 98 , described as " a winter version of the Warped Tour . " Sharing the stage with Primus , the band was enjoying more success than ever before , but the drama between the musicians had grown substantially . The band reached a low point when the band engaged in a fight on a Nebraska date after SnoCore 's conclusion . Shortly after the conclusion of SnoCore was a short minitour along the western coast , most notably Southern California , the band 's favorite place to play . The tour ended with the band headlining a sold @-@ out show at the Palladium in Hollywood , California , where the band had dreamed of performing at for years . 
 Raynor suffered a " tragic loss " during the West Coast minitour and flew home , forcing the band to find a fill @-@ in drummer : Travis Barker of the ska punk support band The Aquabats . Barker learned the drum tracks for the band 's set in only 45 minutes prior to his first show . Raynor returned for the band 's Hollywood Palladium performance , and the band became increasingly uneasy and arguments grew worse . To offset personal issues , Raynor began to drink heavily and it began to affect the band 's performances . Following a largely successful Australian tour in the spring , Hoppus and DeLonge presented an ultimatum : quit drinking or go to an in @-@ patient rehab . Raynor agreed to both and informed the band of his decision after taking the weekend to mull options . According to Raynor , he was fired through a phone call despite his agreement to rehab . Despite this , he felt no malice toward his former bandmates and conceded they were " right " to fire him . 
 The band would minimize the impact of the situation in future interviews and remained vague regarding his departure . The " Josie " CD single , released in the US in November 1998 , was the first Blink @-@ 182 release to feature Barker in any capacity ( he is pictured on the back cover alongside Hoppus and DeLonge ) . Barker would join Blink @-@ 182 full @-@ time in the summer of 1998 and toured with the band for the remainder of the year , playing sold @-@ out shows across America on the humorously named <unk> <unk> Tour .

 = Tales of Xillia = 
 Tales of Xillia ( Japanese : テイルズ オブ <unk> , Hepburn : Teiruzu Obu <unk> ) is a Japanese role @-@ playing game for the PlayStation 3 . It is the thirteenth core product of the Tales series and is developed by Namco Tales Studio with Namco Bandai Games as the publisher . The game was released in Japan on September 7 , 2011 and was localized in North America and PAL region in August 2013 . The game takes place in a fictional world called Rieze Maxia where humans and ethereal spirits live in harmony . It follows Jude Mathis and Milla Maxwell who elude government officials after sabotaging a weapon of mass destruction known as the Lance of Kresnik . The plot 's central theme is <unk> <unk> no RPG ( <unk> ? , lit . " RPG of Unwavering Convictions " ) . 
 Tales of Xillia 's reception in Japan was highly positive . At the time of its release , it was the most preordered Tales game in the series and sold half a million copies in a week ; the game also won awards from Sony and Famitsu . The English localization received positive reception for its battle system , neutral to positive reviews for its plot and characters , and criticism for the map designs . The sequel , Tales of Xillia 2 , was released in November 2012 in Japan and in August 2014 in North America and PAL region . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Tales of Xillia consists primarily of two major areas : the field map and the battle screen . The field map is a realistically scaled 3D environment where the player character traverses and interacts with non @-@ player characters , items , or mob avatars . On the field map , character interactions between the party can also be viewed in the form of a sketch story ; these sketch stories are referred to as skits and consist of animated portraits and voice acting . When coming into contact with a mob avatar , the environment switches to the battle screen , a 3D representation of an area in which the player commands the characters in battles against the CPU @-@ controlled mobs . 
 During battle sequences , the game uses the Dual Raid Linear Motion Battle System , a variation of the Linear Motion Battle used in the Tales series . Four characters from the party are chosen to battle and characters not controlled by a player are controlled by artificial intelligence with instructions set by the players beforehand . The enemy mob 's number , appearances , behavior , vary and are dependent on the mob 's avatar . Both side 's objective is to deplete the other side 's health points ( HP ) using attacks and skills . When a party member 's health falls to zero , the party member faints until revived with items , by a healer , or resting at an inn on the field map ; Mobs with zero HP disappear from the arena . Killing all the mobs will yield experience points , items , and allows the player to return to the field map . If all four participating party members are defeated , a game over will occur . Skill and attribute development is based on a system of orbs placed on the nodes of a hexagonal web called the Lilium Orb . When characters level up , they receive GP which can then be allocated to the orbs on the web in a uni @-@ linear path . Each orb activated contains either a new skill or an attribute upgrade . 
 Battles take place in real @-@ time . Player actions include moving , dashing , standard attacks , and artes ; artes are special attacks which consume " Technical Points " ( TP ) , the in @-@ game synonym for magic points . Dashing , standard attacks , and artes usage are also restricted by the " Assault Counter " ( AC ) , a synonym for action points . Party members are able to link to each other to perform unified attacks called linked artes . While linked , the supporting partner provides unique abilities to the character , while also increasing the Linked Artes Gauge . When the Linked Artes Gauge is full , the player character can enter Over Limit which gives them immunity to stagger , unlimited AC , and allows them to use linked artes in succession . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Two millennia ago , humans developed spyrix , a power source which absorbs spirits to supply power . In response , the spirit Maxwell gathered humans , who share a symbiotic relationship with spirits , onto an isolated land protected by a barrier ; the isolated land became known as Rieze Maxia and the outer lands as Elympios . As spirits are needed to sustain nature , Maxwell waits for the day all humans on Elympios die off before dispelling the barrier . Twenty years prior to the present , an <unk> cruise ship becomes trapped in Rieze Maxia , eventually forming a terrorist group known as Exodus . Exodus works with the Elympios military to find a way to destroy the barrier . In the present era , Rieze Maxia is ruled by two countries called Rashugal and <unk> <unk> . While the two countries appear to live in harmony , they both initiate black operations in attempts to conquer the other in hopes of uniting Rieze Maxia as a single country . 
 In the present , medical student Jude Mathis investigates a military research facility in order to search for his missing professor . There he witnesses a spyrix @-@ powered weapon called the Lance of Kresnik absorb his professor . The military prep Jude as the next victim , but he is saved by Milla Maxwell , Maxwell 's successor . In response , the military activates the lance which absorbs Milla 's spirit companions forcing her and Jude to retreat . Jude and Milla decide to confront Rashugal 's king who had endorsed the Lance 's creation . During their travel , they are joined by Alvin , <unk> <unk> , Rowen J. Illbert and Leia Rolando . After Rashugal 's king is defeated , Exodus obtains and uses the Lance to temporarily disable the barrier protecting Rieze Maxia , allowing Elympios ' army to invade . Assisted by <unk> <unk> 's king , Gaius , the party defeats Exodus at the cost of Milla 's life . 
 After mourning her death , Jude leads the party to meet Maxwell and attempts to persuade him to dispel the barrier and save Elympios . Reunited with Milla , who has been reborn as a spirit , they convince Maxwell of their cause . However , Gaius and the spirit named Muzét seal Maxwell within the Lance of Kresnik , intent on sustaining the barrier until all <unk> are destroyed ; Maxwell sends the party to Elympios before he is completely subdued . There , the party learns about Elympios ' dependence on spyrix and an ongoing research on <unk> , a power source harmless to spirits . With renewed conviction , the party confronts and defeats Gaius and Muzét . Maxwell dispels the barrier and disperses its energy to temporarily power <unk> until the completion of <unk> . The party returns to their daily lives with Jude joining a <unk> research team , Milla resuming her role as Maxwell , and Gaius uniting Rieze Maxia under his rule .

 Tales of Xillia was one of the top selling games on the North American PlayStation Network in August 2013 . All English reviewers agreed the battle system was fast and engaging ; however , Electronic Gaming Monthly , Game Informer , GameSpot , and PlayStation Official Magazine panned the map designs calling them repetitive , lifeless and bland . The plot received neutral to positive reception . Game Revolution wrote " There 's a pleasing inertia to the way plotlines form , unfold , and reach a conclusion that propels our heroes ever @-@ forward , never stopping long enough to feel meandering but never feeling rushed or forced either .

Electronic Gaming Monthly described the characters as rather normal and competent compared to the previous Tales games , adding that they could imagine the cast having lives and dreams outside of the party 's journey . Edge described the character interactions as engaging , well written , and praised how the characters avoided the cliché found in manga and anime . Oppositely , PlayStation Official Magazine felt the characters " fall into the familiar anime <unk> " and that " flat voice acting and a melodramatic script " made it difficult to feel invested in the cast ; Polygon agreed about the character archetypes and called it a lazy strategy used to make the characters understandable . 
 = 1998 Pacific hurricane season = 
 The 1998 Pacific hurricane season was a below average Pacific hurricane season , It had six major hurricanes that was well above average . The season officially started on May 15 in the eastern Pacific and on June 1 in the central Pacific , and ended on November 30 ; these dates conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in that region . The first tropical cyclone developed on June 11 , about ten days later than the normal start of the season . The final storm of the year , Hurricane Madeline , dissipated on October 20 . Storm activity in the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's warning zone was low , with just one tropical depression observed in the region . Two tropical cyclones from the eastern Pacific ( Darby and Estelle ) also entered the central Pacific ; the former did so as a hurricane . 
 The season produced 13 named storms , slightly below the average of 15 named storms per season . However , the season total of nine hurricanes was one above the average , and the total of six major hurricanes surpassed the average of three . Activity during the season was hindered by the northward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) . The ITCZ , which is normally situated south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec , shifted northward into Central and Southern Mexico , making the cyclone closer to cooler sea surface temperatures , hence limiting the number of storms that formed during the season . Although a semi @-@ permanent anticyclone persisted through the summer of 1998 , causing most of the storms to remain at sea , some storm did threaten the Baja California Peninsula due to a weakness in the anticyclone . Except for Hurricane Kay , all of the storms of the season originated from tropical waves . 
 The most notable tropical cyclone of the year was Hurricane Isis , which killed fourteen people when it made landfall on southern Baja California Sur and coastal Sinaloa in Mexico . Isis caused considerable damage in the nation while destroying more than 700 homes and damaging dozens of cars . It later produced sporadic rainfall in the southwestern United States , leading to some traffic accidents . In addition to Isis , Tropical Storm Javier moved ashore the coast of Jalisco in Mexico ; the nation experienced indirect effects from four other storms , all of which remained offshore . One tropical cyclone , Hurricane Lester , affected Central America , causing two deaths in Guatemala . Three tropical cyclones brought light to moderate rainfall to the southwestern United States , and one hurricane produced rough surf along the coast of California . Hurricane Madeline contributed to a deadly and costly flood in southern Texas .

 = = = Tropical Storm Agatha = = = 
 A poorly defined tropical wave crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on June 8 . As it tracked westward under the influence of a ridge to its north , a broad circulation developed . Gradually , the dominant center of circulation became better defined , with increasingly organized convection and developing banding features . By early on June 11 , the center became sufficiently associated with the convection for the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) to classify the system as Tropical Depression One @-@ E. This occurred while the area of unsettled weather was about 460 miles ( 765 km ) south @-@ southwest of Acapulco , Mexico . 
 The center of the depression was not initially well defined , with restricted outflow in the eastern half of the circulation . As such , the depression failed to attain any significant organization in the days subsequent to its formation . Later , an approaching tropical wave merged with the depression , resulting in a trend of intensification and increased organization . By June 13 , the NHC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status , and gave it the name " Agatha " . Agatha was about 650 miles ( 1050 km ) south @-@ southeast of Cabo San Lucas when it became a tropical storm . As Agatha became a tropical storm , forecasters predicted that it would not strengthen further , due to its forecast track passing over cooler waters . However , Agatha quickly strengthened , developing a curved band of convection wrapping around its center , and early on June 11 it attained a peak intensity of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) while about 615 miles ( 985 km ) southwest of the southern tip of Baja California . Agatha maintained peak winds for about 12 hours before moving over colder waters and gradually weakening . On June 15 , it degenerated back into a tropical depression , and a day later , it dissipated over the open waters of the Pacific Ocean . The storm never affected land . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Two @-@ E = = = 
 A few days later , another westward @-@ moving tropical disturbance paralleled the southern coast of Central America and Mexico . Convection in the area organized steadily , and late on June 19 , the system developed into Tropical Depression Two @-@ E about 260 miles ( 420 km ) south @-@ southwest of Manzanillo , Mexico . On becoming a tropical depression , the system maintained a large , elongated , low @-@ level circulation with some banding features and restricted outflow due to wind shear . The National Hurricane Center first predicted that the depression would intensify , reaching winds of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) , though two computer models projected it to quickly dissipate . Under the influence of a ridge over Mexico , the depression moved to the west @-@ northwest , and , under the influence of increasing wind shear , the depression failed to organize significantly . By June 20 , the circulation center was partially exposed , and was located to the northeast of the primary convection – traits that signal a weak storm . Two @-@ E approached tropical storm status , though deep convection waned after the system moved over cooler waters . On June 21 , the National Hurricane Center issued the last advisory on the depression , stating that the depression maintained a very well @-@ defined , low @-@ level circulation , but had no convection associated with the system . Locally heavy rains fell across southwest Mexico in association with this system , peaking at 5 @.@ 55 inches ( 141 mm ) at Las Gaviotas / Compostela . 
 = = = Hurricane Blas = = = 
 On June 8 , a tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa . The wave remained weak and nondescript as it crossed the Atlantic Ocean and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on June 19 . An area of convection developed and organized along the wave 's axis , and the National Hurricane Center began to employ Dvorak classifications on June 20 . Convective banding features increased as the broad circulation became better defined , and on June 22 , the disturbance developed into Tropical Depression Three @-@ E about 575 miles ( 925 km ) south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec . Well @-@ defined steering currents resulted in a general west @-@ northwestward movement . Deep convection concentrated near the center , and about 12 hours after becoming a tropical depression , the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Blas about 400 miles ( 640 km ) south of Puerto Angel , Oaxaca . 
 Tropical Storm Blas continued to organize as it moved parallel to the Mexican coast . Banding features increased , and on June 23 the storm attained hurricane status about 345 miles ( 555 km ) southwest of Acapulco . The next day , an eye developed and became apparent on satellite imagery , while upper @-@ level outflow became better defined . Blas quickly strengthened and reached its peak intensity on June 25 , with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) , while about 575 miles ( 925 km ) south @-@ southeast of the southern tip of Baja California . Temperatures warmed in the convection around the eye , though the eye remained visible for several days as Blas turned west under the influence of a ridge to its north . On June 28 , it degenerated into a tropical storm after entering an area of cooler water . Blas weakened to a tropical depression on June 30 , and a day later was considered to have dissipated due to a lack of convection near the center . A remnant low @-@ level cloud swirl persisted for several days , passing well to the south of Hawaii on July 5 before dissipating . The Associated Press attributed 4 deaths from a mudslide in Michoacán to Blas . However , as the primary convection remained offshore , the National Hurricane Center did not consider the deaths related to the hurricane . The threat of Blas prompted officials in Acapulco to close the port to all navigation . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Celia = = = 
 On July 1 , another tropical wave emerged off the coast of Africa . It moved westward due to strong wind shear without further organization , and crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 11 . An area of organizing convection developed along the wave axis , and Dvorak classifications began on July 13 , while the tropical wave was south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec . The cloud pattern soon became disorganized , and the area of disturbed weather continued west @-@ northwestward . On July 16 , convection increased and organized into banding features ; early on July 17 , the system developed into Tropical Depression Four @-@ E about 150 miles ( 240 km ) south of Manzanillo , Mexico . Soon after becoming a tropical depression , the storm rapidly organized and intensified into Tropical Storm Celia six hours after becoming a tropical depression . The tropical storm initially moved northwestward , and briefly threatened southern Baja California . As a result , the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning on July 18 for La Paz southward . Shortly thereafter , a mid- to upper @-@ level anticyclone turned Celia to the west @-@ northwest and forced it to pass about 150 miles ( 240 km ) south @-@ southwest of Cabo San Lucas . On July 19 , Celia attained maximum sustained winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) before moving over cooler waters and diminishing in convection . The storm degenerated into a tropical depression on July 20 , and Celia dissipated early on July 21 , well away from the Mexican coastline . 
 The precursor tropical disturbance produced locally heavy rainfall along the south coast of Mexico . Authorities in Mexico closed the port at Acapulco to small fishing and recreational boats , and advised larger craft to use caution . Damage from the storm , if any , is unknown .

 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on July 4 . It tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean with little increase in convection , and crossed Central America into the Pacific Ocean on July 16 . Three days later , convection began to increase along the wave axis while the wave was well to the south of Acapulco , Mexico . On July 21 , Dvorak classifications began as the cloud pattern displayed curvature on satellite images . Convective banding features gradually developed , and it is estimated that the system organized into Tropical Depression Five @-@ E early on July 23 about 720 miles ( 1160 km ) south of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula . Under the influence of a mid- to upper @-@ level ridge to its north , the depression tracked west @-@ northwestward . Convection became more concentrated as outflow organized further , and 18 hours after the depression first developed , it intensified into Tropical Storm Darby . 
 Located in an area conducive to further development , Darby attained hurricane status on July 24 , subsequent to the development of a 17 mile ( 27 km ) -wide eye . The eye became more distinct while surrounded by an area of deep convection , and on July 25 the hurricane reached peak winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) about 850 miles ( 1370 km ) southwest of Cabo San Lucas . The eye soon disappeared on satellite imagery , believed to be from an eyewall replacement cycle , and Darby 's winds weakened to about 105 mph ( 170 km / h ) . A 25 mile ( 40 km ) eye next developed , and on July 26 , the hurricane re @-@ intensified to reach peak winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) . For a 30 @-@ hour period , Darby attained the characteristics of an annular hurricane , retaining a well @-@ defined structure with few banding features for an extended period . The hurricane began to weaken while entering an area of cooler water and increased wind shear , and after crossing into the jurisdiction of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center , Darby weakened to a tropical storm on July 29 . The storm degenerated into a tropical depression on July 31 , and early on August 1 , Darby dissipated a moderate distance north of the Hawaiian Islands . It never affected land . 
 = = = Hurricane Estelle = = = 
 On July 18 , a tropical wave exited the western coast of Africa , and moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean with sporadic convection but no development . The wave moved across the Caribbean Sea and the southern Gulf of Mexico before crossing Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 28 . Early on July 29 , Dvorak classifications began on the system , and subsequent to the formation of banding features and a surface circulation , the system developed into Tropical Depression Six @-@ E about 170 miles ( 275 km ) southeast of Manzanillo , Mexico . The depression continued to organize , with increasing convection and distinct upper @-@ level outflow , and early on July 30 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Estelle . 
 Tropical Storm Estelle gradually intensified as it tracked west @-@ northwestward , a motion caused by a large anticyclone to its north . On July 31 , the storm attained hurricane status about 550 miles ( 885 km ) south @-@ southeast of the southern tip of Baja California . Its intensification continued as a well @-@ defined eye about 30 miles ( 48 km ) in diameter became visible on satellite imagery , and on August 2 Estelle reached its peak intensity of 135 mph ( 215 km / h ) . The hurricane soon began to weaken as deep convection diminished and the eye disappeared on satellite imagery . Two days after peaking in intensity , Estelle weakened to tropical storm status . Late on August 4 , the convection associated with the storm dissipated , and the next day the storm weakened to tropical depression status . Convection briefly re @-@ developed on August 6 , though increased wind shear and cooler water weakened the depression further . Two days later , Estelle dissipated about 400 miles ( 645 km ) east @-@ northeast of the Hawaiian Islands . High surf from Estelle impacted southern California , resulting in a number of lifeguard rescues . The storm disrupted the trade winds around Hawaii , resulting in light winds and rain showers on Kauai and Oahu . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Frank = = = 
 On July 19 , a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa . A mid @-@ level circulation developed to the south of Cape Verde on July 22 , though the wave became less distinct as it continued westward . The wave axis crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 31 . Convection steadily increased , though it was not until August 4 that the convection began to organize . Dvorak classifications began on August 4 , and subsequent to the formation of a low @-@ level circulation the system developed into Tropical Depression Seven @-@ E on August 6 about 550 miles ( 885 km ) south of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula . The depression tracked generally northward , under the influence of a ridge over Mexico and a mid @-@ level trough to its west . The center of the depression was initially elongated , with northerly wind shear impacting the structure of the cyclone . This at first prevented further strengthening , though convection increased and organized into banding features as it moved through an area of warm water . On August 8 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Frank , and it soon turned to the north @-@ northwest , brushing the western coastline of Baja California . On August 9 , Frank reached peak winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) about 105 miles ( 170 km ) west @-@ northwest of Ciudad Constitución . It turned to the northwest , with a portion of the circulation of the land , and steadily weakened after moving over cooler water . On August 10 , Frank dissipated a short distance off Baja California . 
 On August 8 , the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for portions of the southwestern Baja California Peninsula . Officials ordered the evacuation of some residents near Cabo San Lucas , whose port was closed , due to the threat of mudslides . Gusty winds and moderate rainfall were reported in a localized area of Baja California Sur , with rainfall peaking at 9 @.@ 61 inches ( 244 mm ) at Santa Anita , near Los Cabos . Moisture from Frank extended into the southwestern United States , producing more than 2 inches ( 50 mm ) of rain in southern California and Arizona . One news agency attributed three deaths to the storm , though elsewhere there were no reports of damage . 
 = = = Hurricane Georgette = = = 
 A tropical wave was first observed in the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 4 in association with the Intertropical Convergence Zone . It tracked westward , and by August 9 a low @-@ level circulation formed well to the south of Mexico . Banding features increased as the system detached from the Intertropical Convergence Zone , and on August 11 , the system developed into Tropical Depression Eight @-@ E about 730 miles ( 1170 km ) southwest of Acapulco . On becoming a tropical cyclone , the depression maintained an area of concentrated deep convection near the center . The National Hurricane Center initially predicted that the depression would slowly intensify and reach winds of 70 mph ( 115 km / h ) within 72 hours . For much of the rest of the storm 's duration , the National Hurricane Center underestimated the intensity of the cyclone . 
 The depression tracked steadily northwestward , caused by its location along the western periphery of a subtropical ridge . It would retain that direction for most of its remaining duration . Late on August 11 , it intensified into Tropical Storm Georgette , and two days later it attained hurricane status after developing a 40 mile ( 65 km ) eye about 615 miles ( 990 km ) south @-@ southwest of Cabo San Lucas . The eye became increasingly distinct while banding features became very well organized . Georgette attained peak winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) while centered 690 miles ( 1110 km ) west @-@ southwest of the southern tip of Baja California . The hurricane soon moved over cooler water , and began to weaken as convection warmed and decreased . On August 16 , it degenerated into a tropical storm , and Georgette dissipated on August 17 without ever affecting land . 
 = = = Tropical Depression One @-@ C = = = 
 An area of convection developed in association with a northward bulge of the near @-@ equatorial convergence zone . It tracked west @-@ northwestward under the influence of a ridge to its north , and organized into Tropical Depression One @-@ C on August 19 , about 1000 miles ( 1600 km ) southeast of the Hawaiian Islands . The depression failed to organize significantly as it turned westward . High wind shear from an upper @-@ level trough continually weakened the system , and on August 19 , the Central Pacific Hurricane Center issued the final advisory on the tropical depression about 365 miles ( 585 km ) south of Hilo on the island of Hawaii . It never affected land . 
 = = = Hurricane Howard = = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 7 . As it moved across the Atlantic Ocean , it failed to organize . On reaching the eastern Pacific Ocean on August 17 , however , an area of convection developed along the wave axis . Dvorak classifications began the next day , and a broad center of circulation gradually formed . Convection was intermittent at first , though it gradually organized and persisted near the center , and on August 20 , the disturbance developed into Tropical Depression Nine @-@ E about 345 miles ( 555 km ) south of Puerto Angel , Mexico . It tracked generally west @-@ northwestward , developing more pronounced banding features , and on August 21 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Howard . The center of Howard became embedded within the deep convection , and the storm quickly strengthened to attain hurricane status late on the 21st . An eye developed as outflow organized further , and Howard began to rapidly intensify to reach peak winds of 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) about 600 miles ( 965 km ) south @-@ southeast of the southern tip of Baja California . At the time of its peak intensity , the eye was small and located within a very cold central dense overcast . 
 Shortly after peaking in intensity , the eye of Hurricane Howard gradually became larger , resulting in a slight weakening trend . After weakening to winds of 125 mph ( 200 km / h ) , the eye reached a diameter of about 30 miles ( 50 km ) , and the structure of the hurricane transitioned into that of an annular hurricane , similar to that of Darby earlier in the season . Howard strengthened again into a Category 4 hurricane on August 25 before weakening slightly the following day . The hurricane retained annular characteristics for about 48 hours before moving over cooler water . On August 28 , it weakened to a tropical storm , and early on August 30 , Howard was considered to have dissipated . A small , low @-@ level swirl of clouds devoid of convection persisted for a few days before dissipating . Howard never affected land . 
 = = = Hurricane Isis = = = 
 Isis developed on September 1 out of the interaction between a tropical wave and a large , low @-@ level circulation to the southwest of Mexico . It moved northward , striking the extreme southeastern portion of the Baja California Peninsula before attaining hurricane status in the Gulf of California . Isis made landfall at Topolobampo in the state of Sinaloa on September 3 and quickly lost its low @-@ level circulation . The remnants persisted for several days before dissipating in the US state of Idaho . 
 In Mexico , Isis destroyed more than 700 houses and killed 14 people , primarily due to heavy rainfall of more than 20 inches ( 500 mm ) in southern Baja California Sur . The rainfall caused widespread damage to roads and railways , stranding thousands of people . Moisture from the remnants of Isis extended into the southwestern United States , resulting in light rainfall , dozens of traffic accidents , and power outages for thousands of residents in San Diego County . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Javier = = = 
 Javier is believed to have originated from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on August 22 . A convective disturbance along the northern portion of the wave developed into Atlantic Hurricane Danielle on August 24 , while the southern portion of the wave axis continued westward . The wave remained inactive and difficult to track as it crossed the Atlantic . On September 3 , an area of convection began to develop near Acapulco , at the same time and location where the wave would have been based on extrapolation . The disturbance became better defined on September 5 as it tracked west @-@ northwestward , and on September 6 the convection became sufficiently organized and persistent for the National Hurricane Center to classify it as Tropical Depression Eleven @-@ E , while it was located about 200 miles ( 330 km ) southwest of Manzanillo , Mexico . 
 Easterly wind shear initially dislocated the circulation center to the eastern edge of the convection . The subtropical ridge to its north resulted in a general west @-@ northwest motion , and the depression slowly intensified into Tropical Storm Javier late on September 7 . Banding features in the system did not organize significantly , and on September 8 , Javier attained a peak intensity of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) , which coincided with a sharp increase in convection over the center . Steering currents soon weakened , and the storm turned to the east while convection quickly decreased . By September 9 , the center was exposed from the diminishing deep convection , and that night it degenerated into a tropical depression . On September 11 , the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory on Javier , though later analysis indicates that it remained a tropical cyclone as it turned southeastward . At times , it became difficult to distinguish Javier from the broader area of disturbed weather that persisted over the tropical eastern Pacific , though a brief increase in convection and a ship report of winds exceeding 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) indicate that Javier strengthened again into a tropical storm late on September 12 . It turned to the northeast , and reached winds of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) before weakening due to waning convection . Javier made landfall about 35 miles ( 55 km ) east @-@ southeast of Cabo Corrientes early on September 14 , and dissipated within 12 hours of moving ashore . The National Hurricane Center advised small craft along coastal areas of Mexico to monitor the progress of the storm . 
 Javier produced moderate rainfall along coastal regions of Mexico , including a 24 @-@ hour peak of 7 @.@ 36 inches ( 187 mm ) in Colima , 6 @.@ 69 inches ( 170 mm ) in Michoacán , and 3 @.@ 34 inches ( 85 mm ) in Jalisco . Puerto Vallarta reported the highest total rainfall , at 17 @.@ 33 inches ( 440 mm ) . Damage , if any , is unknown . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Twelve @-@ E = = = 
 A tropical disturbance developed persistent convection in association with a low @-@ level circulation , and organized into Tropical Depression Twelve @-@ E late on October 1 about 350 miles ( 565 km ) west @-@ northwest of Manzanillo , Mexico . Within an environment of weak steering currents , the depression was initially forecast to track slowly west @-@ northwestward and reach winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) , but instead it drifted eastward before turning slowly to the west . The depression failed to organize and gradually worsened in appearance . Early on October 2 , two ships reported southwest winds much further to the north , with the National Hurricane Center indicating that either the center was exceedingly small , that no center existed at the time , or that the center was located far to the north of the thunderstorm activity . Operationally , the center was relocated further to the north , then relocated about 115 miles ( 185 km ) to the south six hours later based on visible satellite images , then again relocated to the north , coinciding with officials issuing the last advisory on the system . By early October 3 , the depression possessed only intermittent convection , and later that day it dissipated to the southwest of the Baja California peninsula . Heavy rains from its eastern periphery fell across southwest Mexico , with a maximum total of 6 @.@ 34 inches ( 161 mm ) at Las Gaviotas / Compostela . 
 = = = Hurricane Kay = = = 
 A small , low @-@ level circulation separated itself from the Intertropical Convergence Zone on October 10 , several hundred miles southwest of Baja California . The circulation was well defined , though its convection was initially minimal and disorganized . On October 12 , the convection increased greatly , and the system was sufficiently organized to be classified Tropical Depression Thirteen @-@ E early on October 13 , about 715 miles ( 1150 km ) southwest of Cabo San Lucas . Dvorak classifications also indicated winds of about 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . Operationally , the depression was forecast to intensify to reach peak winds of 45 mph ( 70 km / h ) while tracking steadily west @-@ northwestward . 
 The storm center was at first ill @-@ defined , and post @-@ season analysis estimates that it intensified into Tropical Storm Kay about 6 hours after developing . After becoming a tropical storm , Kay rapidly organized as it tracked generally westward . A pinhole eye developed in the center of the convection , and Kay attained hurricane status late on October 13 , about 18 hours after developing . After remaining a hurricane for about 12 hours , the eye disappeared and the convection weakened , and early on October 14 Kay degenerated into a tropical storm . Within an environment of weak steering currents , the storm turned to the southwest , then to the south , after weakening to a tropical depression on October 15 . Convection sporadically redeveloped , but failed to persist . Kay turned to the southeast and later to the east , and the system dissipated on October 17 , about 330 miles ( 530 km ) south @-@ southwest of its origin . Kay never affected land . 
 = = = Hurricane Lester = = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 29 , and on October 5 , an area of convection along the wave developed into Atlantic Hurricane Lisa . The wave axis continued westward , and after crossing Central America convection increased as it tracked northwestward , and the system organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen @-@ E on October 15 , about 200 miles ( 320 km ) south of Guatemala . It moved northwestward and late on the 15th it intensified into Tropical Storm Lester , about 115 miles ( 185 km / h ) south of the border of Mexico and Guatemala , before attaining hurricane status on October 16 . Lester continued westward and strengthened to reach a peak intensity of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) on October 22 . Late on October 23 , it degenerated into a tropical storm , and several days later , Lester dissipated on October 26 . 
 Early in its lifetime , Lester produced heavy rainfall across southwestern Guatemala . The rainfall destroyed some houses and killed livestock , and a mudslide from the heavy precipitation killed two children . In Honduras , rainfall from the hurricane destroyed a bridge in Tegucigalpa , affecting about 1 @,@ 000 people . Moisture brought around the northeast periphery of the Sierra Madre Occidental led to a narrow band of heavy rainfall along the upslope side of the mountain range , with a local precipitation maximum exceeding 14 inches ( 360 mm ) . Though no surface reports are available , it is estimated that tropical @-@ storm @-@ force winds occurred along coastal areas of southern Mexico . 
 = = = Hurricane Madeline = = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 25 , and remained disorganized while crossing the Atlantic Ocean before crossing Central America into the Pacific Ocean . It continued westward , and on October 15 began to steadily organize until developing into Tropical Depression Fifteen @-@ E on October 16 , about 230 miles ( 370 km ) west @-@ southwest of Manzanillo , Mexico . At the western end of a mid @-@ level ridge , the depression tracked north @-@ northwestward . 12 hours after first developing , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Madeline . Banding features gradually improved in organization , and late on October 17 , Madeline attained hurricane status . On October 18 , Madeline attained peak winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) about 95 miles ( 150 km ) southwest of San Blas , Nayarit . Late on October 19 , the hurricane degenerated into a tropical storm , and early on October 20 , Madeline dissipated in the southern portion of the Gulf of California . 
 Some of the rainbands from Madeline moved over portions of southwest Mexico , with close to 9 inches ( 560 mm ) falling at Cabo Corrientes . No damage or casualties were reported as a result of the storm in Mexico . Moisture from Madeline contributed to heavy rainfall across southeastern Texas , reaching over 22 inches ( 560 mm ) in some locations . Thirty @-@ one people died due to the flooding , and damage totaled $ 750 million ( 1998 USD ) .

 = Judgment Day ( 2008 ) = 
 Judgment Day ( 2008 ) was a professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) and sponsored by Lionsgate 's Rambo , which took place on May 18 , 2008 , at the Qwest Center Omaha in Omaha , Nebraska . It was the tenth annual Judgment Day event and starred wrestlers from the Raw , SmackDown , and ECW brands . 
 The show 's seven matches showcased prominent WWE wrestlers , who acted out the franchise 's stories in and out of the ring . The main event featured Raw wrestlers in a Steel Cage match , a match in a ring surrounded by four walls of mesh metal . In this match , WWE Champion Triple H defeated Randy Orton to retain his title . In SmackDown 's main match , The Undertaker defeated Edge by countout , but did not win the vacant World Heavyweight Championship because in WWE , a championship cannot change hands via countout or disqualification . While in ECW 's prime match , WWE Tag Team Champions John Morrison and The Miz defeated ECW Champion Kane and CM Punk to retain the titles . From the six scheduled bouts on the undercard , two received less promotion than the others ; these bouts included in two respective singles matches , Shawn Michaels defeating Chris Jericho and John Cena defeating John " Bradshaw " Layfield ( JBL ) . 
 Judgment Day received 252 @,@ 000 pay @-@ per @-@ view buys , and was instrumental in helping WWE increase its pay @-@ per @-@ view revenue by $ 21 @.@ 9 million compared to the previous year . The professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer website rated the entire event 6 out of 10 , higher than the 2007 event , which was marked " as an average show " . 
 = = Background = = 
 Judgment Day provided the culmination of various scripted plots and storylines . A month before the event , several professional wrestling matches and scripted plots were played out on WWE programming ( Raw , Friday Night SmackDown ! , and ECW on Sci Fi ) to create feuds between various wrestlers , casting them as villains and heroes . Raw , SmackDown , and ECW were also the names of WWE 's televised brands – a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a specific program , thus each brand promoted distinct matches . 
 The main event scripted into Judgment Day on the Raw brand featured WWE Champion Triple H defending the title against Randy Orton in a match where the ring was surrounded by walls of steel , dubbed as a Steel cage match . The buildup to the match began after Backlash , WWE 's previous pay @-@ per @-@ view event , where Triple H last eliminated Orton in a Fatal Four @-@ Way Elimination match , also involving John Cena and John " Bradshaw " Layfield ( JBL ) , to win the WWE Championship . The following night on an episode of Raw , one of WWE 's primary television programs , authority figure William Regal , a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer , stopped a title match between Orton and Triple H , and booked the two in a Steel cage match at Judgment Day for the WWE Championship . 
 One of the featured preliminary matches on the SmackDown brand was between The Undertaker versus Edge for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship . At Backlash , the Undertaker defeated Edge to retain the title by forcing him to submit to the <unk> , a chokehold move that causes opponents to spit blood ( scripted ) from their mouths . On the May 2 episode of SmackDown , authority figure Vickie Guerrero stripped the title from the Undertaker , after claiming the <unk> was an illegal submission hold and she did it to protect the other wrestlers . The following week , Guerrero booked Undertaker in a match for the vacant title at Judgment Day against Edge , who last eliminated Batista in a battle royal , an elimination style match where the last person in the ring is the winner , to become the number one contender . 
 Another featured preliminary match involved Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho in a singles match . At Backlash , Michaels defeated Batista ( with Jericho as the special guest referee ) in an Interpromotional match . During the match , Michaels countered a Batista Bomb attempt , a powerbomb move in which the wrestler drops into a sitting position as they slam their opponent down to the mat , and appeared to have legitimately injured his left knee . On the April 28 episode of Raw , Jericho claimed that Michaels faked his knee injury to allow him to defeat Batista at Backlash , a claim that Michaels denied . The following week , it was announced that Jericho would face Michaels in a singles match at Judgment Day . On the May 12 episode of Raw , Jericho offered his apologies to Michaels for accusing him of feigning an injury , as well as giving Michaels the opportunity to back out of their match . Michaels revealed that he did indeed fake his knee injury . Four days later , on the May 16 episode of SmackDown , Batista commented that he would hurt Michaels , scripted into the storyline , for faking his injury . 
 One more rivalry from the Raw brand was between John Cena and JBL . In the Fatal Four @-@ Way Elimination match at Backlash , Cena eliminated JBL by making him submit to the STFU , a move in which the wrestler wraps his arm around the neck of the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of the opponent . On the April 28 episode of Raw , JBL challenged Cena to a singles match at Judgment Day , which was made official on WWE 's website . 
 The Divas rivalry from the Raw brand was between Mickie James , Beth Phoenix , and Melina over James ' WWE Women 's Championship . It was on the April 14 edition of Raw that James defeated Phoenix to win her fourth Women 's Championship . Phoenix received her title rematch on the May 5 edition of Raw , but she was defeated after Melina accidentally struck Phoenix with her boot . The following week on Raw , Phoenix and Melina were defeated by James and Maria after Phoenix abandoned Melina due to being accidentally knocked off the ring apron by her partner . Melina would turn face after the match due to being attacked by Phoenix in a backstage segment .

 Before Judgment Day aired live on pay @-@ per @-@ view , Hardcore Holly and Cody Rhodes defeated Santino Marella and Carlito in a dark match to retain the World Tag Team Championship . 
 = = = Preliminary matches = = = 
 The first televised match was between John Cena and John " Bradshaw " Layfield ( JBL ) . JBL dominated most of the match , as he began to work on Cena 's surgically @-@ repaired right pectoral muscle . Mid @-@ way in the match , it saw Cena try to lift JBL from the mat into the air for a powerbomb , a move in which an opponent is lifted up and then slammed back @-@ first down to the mat , but Cena collapsed and could not execute the move . JBL controlled most of the match , as Cena tried to avoid JBL 's assaults . JBL also applied numerous submission maneuvers on Cena . JBL performed the Clothesline from Hell on Cena . JBL went for another Clothesline from Hell , Cena avoided the move and lifted JBL onto his shoulders and slammed him down to the mat , a finishing move Cena calls the FU , to get the pinfall victory over JBL . 
 The next match was for the WWE Tag Team Championship , in which the champions , John Morrison and The Miz , defended the title against Kane and CM Punk . The match began with Kane and Punk in control for the majority of the match . Back and forth action took place between both teams . Punk was tagged in the match , which led to him performing a high knee on Morrison , as well as performing a bulldog . Outside the ring , Kane chokeslammed the Miz , causing Punk to get distracted . Morrison took the advantage as he was able to perform the Moonlight Drive and pin Punk to retain the tag title . 
 The match that followed was between Shawn Michaels and Chris Jericho . The start of the match saw Michaels and Jericho exchange several near @-@ falls attempts before Michaels applied a modified figure four leglock , which Jericho broke free . Jericho applied the Walls of Jericho , a submission hold that typically starts with the opponent laying supine on the mat , with the wrestler standing and facing them , though Michaels grabbed the bottom rope , causing Jericho to break the hold . Jericho attempted to perform the submission move once more , but Michaels caught Jericho and countered it into a straddle pin to take the win . After the match , both men shook hands . 
 The fourth match was a standard match involving three wrestlers , dubbed as a triple threat match , for the WWE Women 's Championship , in which Mickie James defended the title against Beth Phoenix and Melina . The match began with James attempting a roll @-@ up on Melina for a near @-@ fall , though Phoenix performed a clothesline on James . Mid @-@ way in the match , James performed a splash , from the top rope , on Phoenix for a near @-@ fall . A spot in the match saw Phoenix try to perform a backbreaker , in which she placed both James and Melina on top of her shoulders , though Phoenix did not execute the move , as Melina managed to break free from the hold and throw Phoenix out of the ring . The match concluded when James performed the Mickie – DT on Melina , thus winning the match and retaining her title .

 The next match was for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship between The Undertaker and Edge . The match went in and out of the ring early on , with both competitors throwing each other out of the ring . The Undertaker instinctively tried to apply the triangle choke hold on Edge , but the referee made him break the hold . Edge then tried to do one of the Undertaker 's moves , Old school , but the Undertaker counter the move . Mid @-@ way in the match , Edge 's associates , Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder , distracted the Undertaker after performing an Old school on Edge . This distraction led Edge to remove the top turnbuckle padding . Back and forth action was seen between the two individuals . As the top turnbuckle was exposed , the Undertaker threw Edge face first onto the top turnbuckle . As the Undertaker ran off the ropes , Edge caught him with a shoulder block takedown for a close two count . Afterwards , the Undertaker clotheslined Edge to the outside of the ring , then he rolled to the floor to follow . Undertaker took Edge over the guardrail to the front row with a clothesline while the referee began the 10 count . Both men struggled back to the floor before the Undertaker grabbed Edge into the guardrail at the eight count . He then rolled into the ring and beat the 10 count to win the match by countout and the belt . 
 The sixth match was between Montel Vontavious Porter ( MVP ) and Jeff Hardy . MVP quickly beat down Hardy and dominated early in the match . Hardy tried to come back with a mule kick from the corner , but MVP moved out of the way , leading Hardy to crash the mat face first . MVP controlled most of the match , until Hardy finally had some offense with a double foot kick in the corner . With the upper hand , Hardy performed a Swanton bomb on MVP , but MVP moved out of the way . MVP tried to perform a running big boot , but Hardy countered into a drop toe hold . The match ended with Hardy winning the match , after performing the Whisper in the Wind , a move performed by executing a backflip from the top turnbuckle , then spinning 180 ° , landing on a fallen opponent back @-@ first . 
 The main event was the Steel cage match for the WWE Championship , in which Triple H defended the title against Randy Orton . During the beginning of the match , Triple H gained the advantage over Orton , as he lifted his knee and hit Orton in the mouth , thus Orton coming up bleeding from the mouth . Orton came back with a kick to the gut before starting his prolonged attack and bolting for the cage door to be open , but Triple H prevented him from escaping . Triple H took control as he took out Orton 's knee with a chop block , a shoulder block that targets the back of an opponent 's knee , and applied on a figure four leglock . After Orton broke the hold , he crawled across to the cage door to escape , but Triple H grabbed him back inside . But , on the way back in , Orton managed to grab a steel chair that was on the ring floor . Orton tried to hit Triple H with the chair , but Triple H managed to avoid being hit . Triple H grabbed the chair to hit Orton with it , but Orton hit him in the groaning area . Orton followed this with a chair shot to Triple H 's back and performed a DDT , a move in which the wrestler falls down or backwards to drive a held opponent 's head into the mat . Throughout the match , Orton tried escaping from the cage , but was not in successful in doing so , as Triple H dragged him back in each time . The match came to an end when Orton tried to hit a running punt on Triple H 's head , however , Triple H grabbed the chair and hit Orton face first . Triple H followed up by tucking Orton 's head between his knees and jumping up to slam his head to the mat , a move that Triple H calls the Pedigree . Triple H covered Orton for the pinfall victory , and thus retaining his title .

 The next night on Raw , William Regal announced that the episode 's main event would be a tag team match pitting Triple H and John Cena against Randy Orton and JBL , in which if Orton and JBL were to win , Regal stated that they could choose any kind of extreme singles rematches against Triple H and John Cena at WWE 's next pay @-@ per @-@ view event , " One Night Stand " , and creating the same stipulation that if Triple H and Cena were to win , they would face each other for the WWE Championship in an extreme match of William Regal 's choosing . Orton and JBL won the match . Orton chose a match in which the wrestler who was unable to respond to a ten count by the referee would lose , against Triple H. JBL picked a First Blood match , in which to win a wrestler has to make his opponent bleed , against Cena . At One Night Stand , both men lost in their rematches . During the event , Orton legitimately broke his collarbone in his match with Triple H. The storyline between Shawn Michaels and Batista continued , as Batista defeated Chris Jericho to earn the right to face Michaels in a Stretcher match , a match where the objective is to place the opponent on a stretcher at ringside and move it across a line located on the entrance ramp , at One Night Stand . At the event , Batista defeated Michaels in the match , thus ending their rivalry . 
 At One Night Stand , The Big Show defeated CM Punk , Chavo Guerrero , Tommy Dreamer and John Morrison in a five @-@ man Singapore Cane match to earn an ECW Championship match against Kane at Night of Champions . During the supplemental draft , a mock sports draft lottery in which wrestlers switched program drafted to the ECW brand . It was announced on WWE 's official website that Henry would be added to the title match , making it a Triple Threat match . At Night of Champions , Henry defeated Kane and Big Show to win the ECW Championship . Henry , however , was booked to lose the title to Matt Hardy at Unforgiven in September . 
 The Undertaker and Edge continued their feud over the next several weeks . Though , a predicament insured on the May 23 episode of SmackDown , when Vickie Guerrero announced that The Undertaker would face Edge once more for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship in a Tables , Ladders , and Chairs match ( TLC ) at One Night Stand with the stipulation that if The Undertaker were to lose , he would be forced to leave the WWE . At the June event , Edge defeated The Undertaker with the help of his accomplices , Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder , in the TLC match to win the vacant World title and The Undertaker was forced to leave the company , written into the storyline . On the July 25 episode of SmackDown , Guerrero reinstated The Undertaker , after learning of Edge 's infidelity with their wedding planner , Guerrero and Edge were in a scripted relationship , and in retaliation she scheduled The Undertaker and Edge in a Hell in a Cell match , a ring surrounded by a steel structure of metal , at SummerSlam . At SummerSlam , The Undertaker defeated Edge .

 = Good Shepherd ( song ) = 
 " Good Shepherd " is a traditional song , best known as recorded by Jefferson Airplane on their 1969 album Volunteers . It was arranged and sung by the group 's guitarist Jorma Kaukonen , who described their interpretation of it as psychedelic folk @-@ rock . 
 Called by nearly a dozen different names and with varying words , melodies and purpose but common themes , the song 's history reflects many of the evolutionary changes and cross @-@ currents of American music . It begins early in the 19th century with a backwoods preacher who wrote hymns , persists through that century , manifests itself in a 1930s gospel blues recording done in a prison by a blind axe murderer , and sees use in the 1950s as a folk song , before attaining its realization by Jefferson Airplane . Several of these different variants of the song are still performed in the 21st century . 
 = = Hymn = = 
 " Good Shepherd " originated in a very early 19th century hymn written by the Methodist minister Reverend John Adam Granade ( 1770 – 1807 ) , " Let Thy Kingdom , Blessed Savior " . Granade was a significant figure of the Great Revival in the American West during the 19th century 's first decade , as the most important author of camp meeting hymns during that time . He was referred to by the Nashville Banner as the " wild man of Goose Creek " , and was also variously known as " the poet of the backwoods " and " the Wild Man of Holston " . Granade worked in part in the world of shape @-@ note singing in the Shenandoah Valley , where a variety of musical sources both sacred and profane were at play . 
 This new hymn had an immediate effect . A Thomas Griffin recalls hearing it in a Methodist meeting in Oglethorpe , Georgia in 1808 . He wrote that the singing of the hymn " made the flesh tremble on me , and caused an awful sense of the hereafter to press on my mind " ; he converted to Christianity a few days later . Granade 's work can be seen in the 1817 hymnal A Selection of Hymns and Spiritual Songs in Two Parts as " Come good shepherd , feed thy Sheep " , while the first line of the hymn also makes an appearance in one <unk> Sherman 's 1832 memoir . 
 It then appeared in Joshua Leavitt 's popular and influential 1833 tunebook The Christian Lyre as " Let thy kingdom " , associated to the tune " Good Shepherd " with an 8 @.@ 7 @.@ metrical pattern . It contained lines such as : 
 Let thy kingdom , blessed Savior , 
 Come , and bid our jarring cease ; 
 Come , oh come ! and reign for ever , 
 God of love and Prince of peace ; 
 ... 
 Some for Paul , some for Apollos , 
 Some for Cephas — none agree ; 
 ... 
 Not upheld by force or numbers , 
 Come , good Shepherd , feed thy sheep . 
 It appears in this form in several hymnals of the 1830s and 1840s , including one created by the Mormons . The most likely tune for it , however , would have been different from the eventual gospel blues one . Titled " The Good Shepherd " and with only two verses printed instead of the previous six or seven , it appeared again in an 1853 New England Christian Convention hymnal . 
 The hymn is on occasion still sung today . 
 = = Gospel blues = = 
 By the 1880s , " Let Thy Kingdom , Blessed Savior " could be found in Marshall W. Taylor 's hymnal of African American religious songs , A Collection of Revival Hymns and Plantation Melodies . It subsequently was transformed by the more general forces shaping American musical forms . The influence of Methodist hymns on Negro spirituals is a complex topic that scholars often disagree on , while there was a more definite and direct influence of African @-@ American spirituals upon the blues . 
 In any case , the aging blind blues player Jimmie Strothers recorded the song , as " The Blood @-@ Strained Banders " , sometimes called " Keep Away from the Bloodstained Banders " , for Alan Lomax and Harold <unk> on behalf of the Library of Congress in June 1936 . ( The name was probably a corruption of " Blood Stained Bandits " . ) Strothers accompanied himself on four @-@ string banjo , an instrument upon which his skill was well regarded . Coming from the Appalachian part of Virginia , Strothers had lost his sight in a mine explosion and had made a living playing on street corners and in medicine shows . Blind , itinerant street singers like Strothers were part of the tradition that kept African @-@ American religious music alive . The recording was made at the Virginia State Prison Farm near Goochland , Virginia , where Strothers was serving time for having murdered his wife with an axe . Lomax thought prisons were a good place to find old songs , and was also interested in illustrating the interaction of white and black music . This haunting recording was part of what Allmusic describes as a " group of songs that explore the boundaries between the sacred and the profane . " 
 If you want to get to heaven 
 ... Over on , the other shore 
 Stay out of the way of the blood @-@ stained bandit — 
 Oh good shepherd , 
 Feed my sheep . 
 One for Paul , one for Silas ... 
 One for to make , my heart rejoice . 
 Can 't you hear , my lambs <unk> ' ? 
 Oh good shepherd , 
 Feed my sheep . 
 " Blood @-@ stained Banders " has been called a " dark homily [ that ] bubbles up archaic invectives for the devil that <unk> behind every stranger 's face . " Strothers ' recording of " Blood @-@ stained Banders " was described in the 1941 book Our Singing Country by Alan Lomax and his father John A. Lomax , with the transcription being done by Ruth Crawford Seeger . The recording was released in 1942 by the Library of Congress as Archive of Folk Song , Recording Laboratory AFS L3 Folk Music of the United States : Afro American Spirituals , Work Songs and Ballads , a collection of field recordings including those by State Penitentiary and State Farm prisoners . It first appeared on 78 rpm records , then was released again on LP album in the mid @-@ 1960s . In 1998 , it was issued by Rounder Records on Compact Disc as Afro @-@ American Spirituals , Work Songs & Ballads , which is also available from the Library of Congress . It also appears on the CD The Ballad Hunter , Parts VII and VIII from the Library of Congress , originally issued as Archive of Folk Song , Recording Laboratory AFS <unk> in 1941 . 
 Transcribed in 2 / 2 time , the Strothers recording 's rhythm and melody are somewhat similar but still measurably different from what would come later . Not a Negro spiritual per se , it was not listed in the top 500 spirituals in a listing of some 6 @,@ 000 constructed by scholar John Lovell , Jr. in 1972 . 
 = = Folk = = 
 In 1953 , Ruth Crawford Seeger collected and transcribed the song as " Don 't You Hear The Lambs A @-@ Crying " in her acclaimed volume American Folk Songs for Christmas . Dartmouth College music professor Larry <unk> comments that in doing so , Ruth Crawford Seeger took the hard @-@ edged gospel blues and " <unk> [ d ] it as a beautiful , shape @-@ note influenced hymn . " 
 The " Blood Stained Banders " form was then recorded by The <unk> in 1958 on their Folkways Records LP We 've Got Some Singing to Do . This was an effort organized by Joe Hickerson , who would become director of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress . We 've Got Some Singing to Do and its accompanying songbook were distributed to a number of summer camps , and were responsible for the popularization of several freedom @-@ longing African @-@ American songs such as " Kum Ba Yah " . The song was circulating in folk circles in other forms as well , and Pete Seeger published a variant with a more explicitly political message , called " If You Want To Go To Freedom " , in the mimeographed @-@ but @-@ influential Broadside Magazine in 1963 . 
 Meanwhile , a recording of the Ruth Crawford Seeger " Don 't You Hear The Lambs A @-@ Crying " was done for the 1989 album American Folk Songs for Christmas by Peggy Seeger , Mike Seeger , and Penny Seeger . Dartmouth 's <unk> then arranged the song under that title for strings in 1999 , which was premiered at that year 's Spoleto Music Festival . 
 The original strain of " Blood @-@ Stained Banders " is still played ; Bobby Horton recorded it in 2003 with an extended guitar part , as part of the soundtrack for the Ken Burns documentary Horatio 's Drive . Hickerson also still performs the tune in the first decade of the 21st century . 
 = = Kaukonen and Jefferson Airplane = = 
 " Blood @-@ Stained Banders " was thus the proximate source for what was taught to guitarist Jorma Kaukonen by folk singer Roger Perkins and friend Tom Hobson in the early 1960s . Kaukonen had grown up in Washington , D.C. and around the world as the son of a diplomat , then had migrated to the San Francisco Bay Area where he became a lover of various folk revival styles , especially acoustic blues and <unk> blues . The song became part of Kaukonen 's repertoire as he played around San Francisco clubs , well before he joined Jefferson Airplane . Kaukonen continued to evolve musically ; the enticement of exploring the technology around the electric guitar led him to join the Airplane . An evolving rendition of Kaukonen 's imagining of the song is captured on a circulating recording of his May 21 , 1968 , performance at the Carousel Ballroom in San Francisco during a jam session of area musicians led by Jerry Garcia . 
 Now titled simply " Good Shepherd " , a recording of the song became Kaukonen 's major showcase number on the Airplane 's November 1969 Volunteers album , where it avoided the political topicality of the most visible tracks on the rest of the album . " Good Shepherd " encompassed elements of both gospel and blues in its playing and showed that folk roots were still quite present in the Airplane 's mixture of sounds and influences that led to psychedelic rock . Indeed , folk music underlay many aspects of the San Francisco psychedelic sound , with the Airplane as a prime example . The recording of " Good Shepherd " , which took place from late March to late June 1969 , featured a rare Kaukonen lead vocal backed by mellow harmonies from the group . Its arrangement incorporated Kaukonen 's sharp , stinging electric guitar lines set against an acoustic guitar opening , with singer Grace Slick wordlessly doubling Kaukonen 's guitar line during the instrumental break . The track was considered a beautiful standout on the album . Kaukonen himself later referred to it as " a great spiritual that I really liked . It 's a psychedelic folk @-@ rock song . " 
 The arrangement was copyrighted by Kaukonen under BMI and published by the Airplane 's <unk> Corporation . Volunteers soon became a gold record and gave the song its greatest visibility since its early days as a hymn . The Airplane " Good Shepherd " has been described as " an ageless representation of genius " . It was included on the band 's 1970 greatest hits album The Worst of Jefferson Airplane . 
 The song 's first live performance by Jefferson Airplane was on May 7 , 1969 , in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco , but with Grace Slick singing lead and Kantner doing the backing vocal . Kaukonen would begin singing the lead two days later in Kansas City , and subsequently kept that role . The 2004 CD reissue of Volunteers included a live rendition of " Good Shepherd " as one of five live bonus tracks recorded November 28 and 29 , 1969 , at the Fillmore East in New York . This performance arrangement had no acoustic guitar part , but instead featured Kantner on electric guitar setting out a repeating but flexible pattern for the song , which Kaukonen then played against with his fills and solos . The song was last played during the original Airplane era in 1972 . 
 " Good Shepherd " was part of the set list of the Airplane 's 1989 reunion tour . It was included on the 1987 / 1990 Airplane compilation 2400 Fulton Street . 
 As Kaukonen and Airplane bassist Jack Casady focused on the offshoot group Hot Tuna beginning in the early 1970s , " Good Shepherd " became a regular entry in their performance repertoire . One such performance was included on their 2000 DVD Acoustic Blues Live at Sweetwater . Hot Tuna performances of the song would occasionally draw old Airplane members to join in . By 2004 , it was often used as a vehicle for a solo bass excursion by Casady . 
 Besides Hot Tuna , renditions of " Good Shepherd " also appeared on Kaukonen 's 1985 live album Magic ( and the 1995 expanded release Magic Two ) , which contained selections from his solo acoustic performances ; as one of Kaukonen 's efforts on the 1999 Phil Lesh and Friends live album Love Will See You Through ; and on the 2001 Jorma Kaukonen Trio Live album . 
 In the 21st century , the song continued to draw commentary from listeners . By now Kaukonen was offering the view that the " blood @-@ strained banders " of the lyric was an allusion to the Ku Klux Klan . He continued to find meaning in performing " Good Shepherd " and other songs like it that celebrated religion in one context or another without preaching , saying such material gave him a doorway into scripture : " I guess you could say I loved the Bible without even knowing it . The spiritual message is always uplifting – it 's a good thing . " 
 = 1864 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1864 Atlantic hurricane season was the third consecutive Atlantic hurricane season with no hurricane landfall in the United States – the longest period on record . However , in the absence of modern satellite and other remote @-@ sensing technologies , only storms that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea were recorded , so the actual total could be higher . An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated . Of the five known 1864 cyclones , four were first documented in 1995 by Jose Fernandez @-@ Partagas and Henry Diaz . The first system was initially observed offshore the Southeastern United States on July 16 . It peaked as a Category 1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . Moving rapidly northeastward , the storm was last noted well east of Newfoundland on July 18 . 
 The next system was observed in the south @-@ central Gulf of Mexico on July 25 . Because the cyclone was not tracked further , only a single @-@ point storm path exists . After tropical cyclogenesis was dormant for over a month , another hurricane was spotted on August 26 to the east of Lesser Antilles . Early on the following day , the hurricane crossed the islands between Dominica and Martinique . After traversing the Caribbean Sea , the storm made landfall in Belize late on August 31 , before dissipating the next day . Offshore Belize , several ships encountered the storm . Along the coast , storm surge flooded some areas . The fourth tropical storm was observed off the East Coast of the United States between September 5 and September 9 . A number of ships sailing in the vicinity of the storm encountered heavy gales . The fifth and final known tropical cyclone was also tracked offshore the East Coast of the United States . Similarly , many vessels experienced rough seas and severe thunderstorms . 
 The season 's activity was reflected with an accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 61 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . It is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) , which is tropical storm strength .

 This storm was first observed by the brig Hattie Eaton on July 16 , while located a few hundred miles offshore the Carolinas . The Hattie Eaton reported sustained winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) – equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . Early on July 18 , the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm . Several hours later , the storm was last noted by ship Energy , while located about 435 mi ( 700 km ) east of Cape Race , Newfoundland .

 A hurricane was first observed well east of the Lesser Antilles on August 26 . The storm moved westward and brought severe weather to Martinique , including hurricane force winds . Throughout its trek across the Caribbean Sea , the system maintained winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . Late on August 31 , the hurricane made landfall in Belize District of Belize . Off the coast , several ships were damaged or sunk . The brig Antonio , the Hannah , and the bark Berkshire were among the ships that capsized . On land , tides up to 5 ft ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) above normal caused coastal flooding in Belize . This storm has been <unk> traced in sediment near Gales Point . The system steadily weakened over land .

 Based on reports from several ships , a tropical storm is known to have existed off the East Coast of the United States between September 5 and September 8 .

 The final tropical cyclone of the season was observed by the Santa Martha early on October 22 , while located about 355 mi ( 570 km ) east @-@ northeast of the Abaco Islands .

Around that time , the hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . The storm moved rapidly east @-@ northeastward and was last noted about 180 mi ( 290 km ) south @-@ southwest of Sable Island late on October 24 . 
 = Gerty Cori = 
 Gerty Theresa Cori ( née Radnitz ; August 15 , 1896 – October 26 , 1957 ) was a Czech @-@ American biochemist who became the third woman — and first American woman — to win a Nobel Prize in science , and the first woman to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine . 
 Cori was born in Prague ( then in the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire , now the Czech Republic ) . Gerty was not a nickname , but rather she was named after an Austrian warship . Growing up at a time when women were marginalized in science and allowed few educational opportunities , she gained admittance to medical school , where she met her future husband Carl Ferdinand Cori ; upon their graduation in 1920 , they married . Because of deteriorating conditions in Europe , the couple emigrated to the United States in 1922 . Gerty Cori continued her early interest in medical research , collaborating in the laboratory with Carl . She published research findings coauthored with her husband , as well as publishing singly . Unlike her husband , she had difficulty securing research positions , and the ones she obtained provided meager pay . Her husband insisted on continuing their collaboration , though he was discouraged from doing so by the institutions that employed him . 
 With her husband Carl and Argentine physiologist Bernardo Houssay , Gerty Cori received the Nobel Prize in 1947 for the discovery of the mechanism by which glycogen — a derivative of glucose — is broken down in muscle tissue into lactic acid and then resynthesized in the body and stored as a source of energy ( known as the Cori cycle ) . They also identified the important catalyzing compound , the Cori ester . In 2004 , both Gerty and Carl Cori were designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark in recognition of their work in clarifying carbohydrate metabolism . 
 In 1957 , Gerty Cori died after a ten @-@ year struggle with <unk> . She remained active in the research laboratory until the end . She received recognition for her achievements through multiple awards and honors . The Cori crater on the Moon and the Cori crater on Venus are named after her . 
 = = Life and work = = 
 Gerty Theresa Radnitz was born into a Jewish family in Prague in 1896 . Her father , Otto Radnitz , was a chemist who became manager of sugar refineries after inventing a successful method for refining sugar . Her mother , Martha , a friend of Franz Kafka , was a culturally sophisticated woman . Gerty was tutored at home before enrolling in a Lyceum for girls , and at the age of 16 she decided she wanted to be a medical doctor . Pursuing the study of science , Gerty learned that she lacked the prerequisites in Latin , physics , chemistry , and mathematics . Over the course of a year , she managed to study the equivalent of eight years of Latin , five years of science , and five years of math . 
 Her uncle , a professor of pediatrics , encouraged her to attend medical school , so she studied for and passed the University entrance examination . She was admitted to the medical school of the Karl @-@ Ferdinands @-@ Universität in Prague in 1914 , which was unusual for a woman to achieve at that time . While studying she met Carl Cori who was immediately attracted to her charm , vitality , sense of humor and her love of the outdoors and mountain climbing . Gerty and Carl had both entered medical school at eighteen and both graduated in 1920 . They married that same year . Gerty converted to Catholicism , enabling her and Carl to marry in the Roman Catholic Church . They moved to Vienna , Austria , where Gerty spent the next two years at the <unk> Children 's Hospital , and her husband worked in a laboratory . While at the hospital , Gerty Cori worked on the pediatrics unit and conducted experiments in temperature regulation , comparing temperatures before and after thyroid treatment , and published papers on blood disorders . 
 Carl served in the Austrian army during World War I after being drafted . Life was difficult following World War I , and Gerty suffered from <unk> caused by severe malnutrition due to food shortages . These problems , in conjunction with the increasing anti @-@ Semitism , contributed to the Coris ' decision to leave Europe . 
 In 1922 , the Coris both immigrated to the United States ( Gerty six months after Carl because of difficulty in obtaining a position there ) to pursue medical research at the " State Institute for the Study of Malignant Diseases " ( now the Roswell Park Cancer Institute ) in Buffalo , New York . In 1928 , they became naturalized citizens of the United States . The director for the Institute threatened to dismiss Gerty if she did not cease collaborative research with her husband . She continued to work with Carl and was also kept on at the Institute . 
 Although the Coris were discouraged from working together at Roswell , they continued to do so , specializing in investigating carbohydrate metabolism . They were particularly interested in how glucose is metabolized in the human body and the hormones that regulate this process . They published fifty papers while at Roswell , with first author status going to the one who had done most of the research for a given paper . Gerty Cori published eleven articles as the sole author . In 1929 , they proposed the theoretical cycle that later won them the Nobel Prize , the Cori cycle . The cycle describes how the human body uses chemical reactions to break some carbohydrates such as glycogen in muscle tissue into lactic acid , while synthesizing others . 
 The Coris left Roswell in 1931 after publishing their work on carbohydrate metabolism . A number of universities offered Carl a position but refused to hire Gerty . Gerty was informed during one university interview that it was considered " <unk> " for a married couple to work together . Carl refused a position at the University of Buffalo because the school would not allow him to work with his wife . 
 In 1931 , they moved to St. Louis , Missouri , as Washington University offered both Carl and Gerty positions although Gerty 's rank and salary were much less than her husbands . Despite her research background , Gerty was only offered a position as a research associate at a salary one tenth of that received by her husband ; she was warned that she might harm her husband 's career . Washington University 's Chancellor , Arthur Holley Compton made a special allowance for Gerty to hold a position there , going against the university 's nepotism rules . Gerty had to wait thirteen years before she attained the same rank as her husband . In 1943 , she was made an associate professor of Research Biological Chemistry and Pharmacology . Months before she won the Nobel Prize , she was promoted to full professor , a post she held until her death in 1957 . 
 They continued their collaboration at Washington University . While working with minced frog muscle , they discovered an intermediate compound that enabled the breakdown of glycogen , called glucose 1 @-@ phosphate , now known as the Cori ester . They established the compound 's structure , identified the enzyme phosphorylase that catalyzed its chemical formation , and showed that the Cori ester is the beginning step in the conversion of the carbohydrate glycogen into glucose ( large amounts of which are found in the liver ) . It can also be the last step in the conversion of blood glucose to glycogen , as it is a reversible step . Gerty Cori also studied glycogen storage disease , identifying at least four forms , each related to a particular enzymatic defect . She was the first to show that a defect in an enzyme can be the cause of a human genetic disease . 
 Gerty and Carl Cori collaborated on most of their work , including that which won them the 1947 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine " for their discovery of the course of the catalytic conversion of glycogen " . They received one half the prize , the other half going to the Argentinian physiologist , Bernardo Houssay " for his discovery of the part played by the hormone of the anterior pituitary lobe in the metabolism of sugar " . Their work continued to clarify the mechanisms of carbohydrate metabolism , advancing understanding of the reversible conversion of sugars and starch , findings which proved crucial in the development of treatments for diabetics .

 The twenty @-@ five square foot Cori laboratory at Washington University was deemed a National Historic Landmark by the American Chemical Society . Not only did the Cori 's conduct groundbreaking research there , but they mentored many scientists . Six of these went on to win Nobel Prizes , which is unmatched in scientific history . 
 The crater Cori on the Moon is named after her . So is the Cori crater on Venus . She also shares a star with Carl on the St. Louis Walk of Fame . 
 Gerty and Carl Cori were late members of the American Society of Biological Chemists , the National Academy of Sciences , the American Chemical Society and the American Philosophical Society . They were presented jointly with the Midwest Award ( American Chemical Society ) in 1946 and the Squibb Award in <unk> in 1947 . In addition , Gerty Cori received the <unk> Medal ( 1948 ) , the St. Louis Award ( 1948 ) , the Sugar Research Prize ( 1950 ) , the Borden Award ( 1951 ) and honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Boston University ( 1948 ) , Smith College ( 1949 ) , Yale ( 1951 ) , Columbia ( 1954 ) , and Rochester ( 1955 ) . Carl Cori , a Member of the Royal Society ( London ) and the American Association for the Advancement of Science , also received the Willard Gibbs Medal ( 1948 ) , the Sugar Research Foundation Award ( 1947 , 1950 ) and honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Western Reserve University ( 1946 ) , Yale ( 1946 ) , Boston ( 1948 ) , and Cambridge ( 1949 ) . He was President of Fourth International Congress of Biochemistry ( Vienna , 1958 ) . 
 Cori was honored by the release of a US Postal Service stamp in April , 2008 . The 41 @-@ cent stamp was reported by the Associated Press to have a printing error in the chemical formula for glucose @-@ 1 @-@ phosphate ( Cori ester ) . The stamp is being distributed despite the error . Her description reads : " Biochemist Gerty Cori ( 1896 – 1957 ) , in collaboration with her husband , Carl , made important discoveries — including a new derivative of glucose — that elucidated the steps of carbohydrate metabolism and contributed to the understanding and treatment of diabetes and other metabolic diseases . In 1947 , the couple was award a half share of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine . " The other scientists on the " American Scientists " sheet include Linus Pauling , chemist , Edwin Hubble , astronomer , and John Bardeen , physicist . 
 In 1948 , Cori was awarded the <unk> @-@ Olin Medal , an award that recognizes distinguished work in chemistry by American women chemists . She was appointed by President Harry S. Truman as board member of the National Science Foundation , a position she held until her death . She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences , the fourth woman so honored . 
 In 1949 she was awarded the Iota Sigma Pi National Honorary Member for her significant contribution . 
 In 2004 the research of <unk> and Carl Cori on carbohydrate metabolism was recognized by the American Chemical Society as a National Historic Chemical Landmark at the Washington University School of Medicine . 
 The US Department of Energy named the <unk> @-@ 8 supercomputer installed in 2015 / 2016 after Cori .

 Just before winning the Nobel prize and while they were on a mountain climbing trip , the Coris learned that Gerty Cori was ill with <unk> , a fatal disease of the bone marrow . During her years at the Institute for the Study of Malignant Disease , Gerty had studied the effects of X @-@ rays on the human body , which was thought to contribute to her illness . She struggled for ten years with the illness while continuing her scientific work ; only in the final months did she let up . In 1957 , she died in her home . Gerty was cremated and her ashes scattered . Later , her son erected a cenotaph for Gerty and Carl Cori in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis , Missouri . 
 She was survived by her husband and their only child , Tom Cori who married the daughter of conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly . 
 Carl remarried in 1960 to Anne Fitzgerald @-@ Jones . The two later moved to Boston , where Carl taught at Harvard Medical School . He continued to work there until his death at the age of eighty @-@ eight . 
 = Subarachnoid hemorrhage = 
 A subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) , or subarachnoid haemorrhage in British English , is bleeding into the subarachnoid space — the area between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain . This may occur spontaneously , usually from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm , or may result from head injury . 
 Signs and symptoms of SAH include a severe headache with a rapid onset ( " thunderclap headache " ) , vomiting , confusion or a lowered level of consciousness , and sometimes seizures . In general , the diagnosis is confirmed with a CT scan of the head , or occasionally by lumbar puncture . Treatment is by prompt neurosurgery or radiologically guided interventions with medications and other treatments to help prevent recurrence of the bleeding and complications . Surgery for aneurysms was introduced in the 1930s , but since the 1990s many aneurysms are treated by a less invasive procedure called " coiling " , which is carried out by instrumentation through large blood vessels . 
 SAH is a form of stroke and comprises 1 – 7 percent of all strokes . It is a medical emergency and can lead to death or severe disability — even when recognized and treated at an early stage . Up to half of all cases of SAH are fatal and 10 – 15 percent of casualties die before reaching a hospital , and those who survive often have neurological or cognitive impairment . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 The classic symptom of subarachnoid hemorrhage is thunderclap headache ( a headache described as " like being kicked in the head " , or the " worst ever " , developing over seconds to minutes ) . This headache often pulsates towards the occiput ( the back of the head ) . About one @-@ third of people have no symptoms apart from the characteristic headache , and about one in ten people who seek medical care with this symptom are later diagnosed with a subarachnoid hemorrhage . Vomiting may be present , and 1 in 14 have seizures . Confusion , decreased level of consciousness or coma may be present , as may neck stiffness and other signs of meningism . Neck stiffness usually presents six hours after initial onset of SAH . Isolated dilation of a pupil and loss of the pupillary light reflex may reflect brain herniation as a result of rising intracranial pressure ( pressure inside the skull ) . <unk> hemorrhage ( bleeding into the eyeball ) may occur in response to the raised pressure : <unk> hemorrhage ( bleeding under the <unk> membrane , which envelops the vitreous body of the eye ) and vitreous hemorrhage may be visible on <unk> . This is known as <unk> syndrome ( occurring in 3 – 13 percent of cases ) and is more common in more severe SAH . 
 <unk> nerve abnormalities ( affected eye looking downward and outward and inability to lift the eyelid on the same side ) or palsy ( loss of movement ) may indicate bleeding from the posterior communicating artery . Seizures are more common if the hemorrhage is from an aneurysm ; it is otherwise difficult to predict the site and origin of the hemorrhage from the symptoms . SAH in a person known to have seizures is often diagnostic of an arteriovenous malformation . 
 The combination of intracerebral hemorrhage and raised intracranial pressure ( if present ) leads to a " sympathetic surge " , i.e. over @-@ activation of the sympathetic system . This is thought to occur through two mechanisms , a direct effect on the medulla that leads to activation of the descending sympathetic nervous system and a local release of inflammatory mediators that circulate to the peripheral circulation where they activate the sympathetic system . As a consequence of the sympathetic surge there is a sudden increase in blood pressure ; mediated by increased contractility of the ventricle and increased vasoconstriction leading to increased systemic vascular resistance . The consequences of this sympathetic surge can be sudden , severe , and are frequently life @-@ threatening . The high plasma concentrations of adrenaline also may cause cardiac arrhythmias ( irregularities in the heart rate and rhythm ) , <unk> changes ( in 27 percent of cases ) and cardiac arrest ( in 3 percent of cases ) may occur rapidly after the onset of hemorrhage . A further consequence of this process is neurogenic pulmonary edema where a process of increased pressure within the pulmonary circulation causes leaking of fluid from the pulmonary capillaries into the air spaces , the alveoli , of the lung . 
 Subarachnoid hemorrhage may also occur in people who have had a head injury . Symptoms may include headache , decreased level of consciousness and <unk> ( weakness of one side of the body ) . SAH is a frequent occurrence in traumatic brain injury , and carries a poor prognosis if it is associated with deterioration in the level of consciousness . 
 = = Causes = = 
 Most cases of SAH are due to trauma . In 85 percent of cases of spontaneous SAH , the cause is rupture of a cerebral aneurysm — a weakness in the wall of one of the arteries in the brain that becomes enlarged . They tend to be located in the circle of Willis and its branches . While most cases of SAH are due to bleeding from small aneurysms , larger aneurysms ( which are less common ) are more likely to rupture . 
 In 15 – 20 percent of cases of spontaneous SAH , no aneurysm is detected on the first angiogram . About half of these are attributed to non @-@ aneurysmal <unk> hemorrhage , in which the blood is limited to the subarachnoid spaces around the midbrain ( i.e. mesencephalon ) . In these , the origin of the blood is uncertain . The remainder are due to other disorders affecting the blood vessels ( such as arteriovenous malformations ) , disorders of the blood vessels in the spinal cord , and bleeding into various tumors . Cocaine abuse and sickle cell anemia ( usually in children ) and , rarely , anticoagulant therapy , problems with blood clotting and pituitary apoplexy can also result in SAH . Dissection of the vertebral artery , usually caused by trauma , can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage if the dissection involves the part of the vessel inside the skull . 
 Subarachnoid blood can be detected on CT scanning in as many as 60 percent of people with traumatic brain injury . Traumatic SAH ( <unk> ) usually occurs near the site of a skull fracture or intracerebral contusion . It usually happens in the setting of other forms of traumatic brain injury and has been linked with a poorer prognosis . It is unclear , however , if this is a direct result of the SAH or whether the presence of subarachnoid blood is simply an indicator of severity of the head injury and the prognosis is determined by other associated mechanisms . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 As only 10 percent of people admitted to the emergency department with a thunderclap headache are having an SAH , other possible causes are usually considered simultaneously , such as meningitis , migraine , and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis . <unk> hemorrhage , in which bleeding occurs within the brain itself , is twice as common as SAH and is often misdiagnosed as the latter . It is not unusual for SAH to be initially misdiagnosed as a migraine or tension headache , which can lead to a delay in obtaining a CT scan . In a 2004 study , this occurred in 12 percent of all cases and was more likely in people who had smaller hemorrhages and no impairment in their mental status . The delay in diagnosis led to a worse outcome . In some people , the headache resolves by itself , and no other symptoms are present . This type of headache is referred to as " sentinel headache " , because it is presumed to result from a small leak ( a " warning leak " ) from an aneurysm . A sentinel headache still warrants investigations with CT scan and lumbar puncture , as further bleeding may occur in the subsequent three weeks . 
 The initial steps for evaluating a person with a suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage are obtaining a medical history and performing a physical examination ; these are aimed at determining whether the symptoms are due to SAH or to another cause . The diagnosis cannot , however , be made on clinical grounds alone ; therefore , in general medical imaging is required to confirm or exclude bleeding . 
 = = = Imaging = = = 
 The modality of choice is computed tomography ( CT scan ) without contrast , of the brain . This has a high sensitivity and will correctly identify over 95 percent of cases — especially on the first day after the onset of bleeding . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) may be more sensitive than CT after several days . Within six hours of the onset of symptoms CT picks up 98 @.@ 7 % of cases . 
 = = = Lumbar puncture = = = 
 Lumbar puncture , in which cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) is removed with a needle from the lumbar sac , will show evidence of hemorrhage in 3 percent of people in whom CT was found normal ; lumbar puncture is therefore regarded as mandatory in people with suspected SAH if imaging is negative . At least three tubes of CSF are collected . If an elevated number of red blood cells is present equally in all bottles , this indicates a subarachnoid hemorrhage . If the number of cells decreases per bottle , it is more likely that it is due to damage to a small blood vessel during the procedure ( known as a " traumatic tap " ) . While there is no official cutoff for red blood cells in the CSF no documented cases have occurred at less than " a few hundred cells " per high @-@ powered field . 
 The CSF sample is also examined for xanthochromia — the yellow appearance of <unk> fluid . This can be determined by spectrophotometry ( measuring the absorption of particular wavelengths of light ) or visual examination . It is unclear which method is superior . <unk> remains a reliable ways to detect SAH several days after the onset of headache . An interval of at least 12 hours between the onset of the headache and lumbar puncture is required , as it takes several hours for the hemoglobin from the red blood cells to be metabolized into bilirubin . 
 = = = Angiography = = = 
 After a subarachnoid hemorrhage is confirmed , its origin needs to be determined . If the bleeding is likely to have originated from an aneurysm ( as determined by the CT scan appearance ) , the choice is between cerebral angiography ( injecting radiocontrast through a catheter to the brain arteries ) and CT angiography ( visualizing blood vessels with radiocontrast on a CT scan ) to identify aneurysms . Catheter angiography also offers the possibility of coiling an aneurysm ( see below ) . 
 = = = ECG = = = 
 <unk> changes are relatively common in subarachnoid hemorrhage , occurring in 40 – 70 percent of cases . They may include QT prolongation , Q waves , cardiac dysrhythmias and ST elevation that mimics a heart attack . 
 = = = Classification = = = 
 There are several grading scales available for SAH . The Glasgow Coma Scale is ubiquitously used for assessing consciousness . Three specialized scores are used to evaluate SAH ; in each , a higher number is associated with a worse outcome . These scales have been derived by retrospectively matching characteristics of patients with their outcomes . 
 The first scale of severity was described by Hunt and Hess in 1968 : 
 The Fisher Grade classifies the appearance of subarachnoid hemorrhage on CT scan . 
 This scale has been modified by Claassen and coworkers , reflecting the additive risk from SAH size and accompanying intraventricular hemorrhage ( 0 - none ; 1 - minimal SAH w / o IVH ; 2 - minimal SAH with IVH ; 3 - thick SAH w / o IVH ; 4 - thick SAH with IVH ) ; . 
 The World Federation of <unk> ( <unk> ) classification uses Glasgow coma score ( GCS ) and focal neurological deficit to gauge severity of symptoms . 
 A comprehensive classification scheme has been suggested by Ogilvy and Carter to predict outcome and gauge therapy . The system consists of five grades and it assigns one point for the presence or absence of each of five factors : age greater than 50 ; Hunt and Hess grade 4 or 5 ; Fisher scale 3 or 4 ; aneurysm size greater than 10 mm ; and posterior circulation aneurysm 25 mm or more . 
 = = Screening and prevention = = 
 Screening for aneurysms is not performed on a population level ; because they are relatively rare , it would not be cost @-@ effective . If someone has two or more first @-@ degree relatives who have had an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage , screening may be worthwhile . 
 <unk> dominant polycystic kidney disease ( <unk> ) , a hereditary kidney condition , is known to be associated with cerebral aneurysms in 8 percent of cases , but most such aneurysms are small and therefore unlikely to rupture . As a result , screening is only recommended in families with <unk> where one family member has had a ruptured aneurysm . 
 An aneurysm may be detected incidentally on brain imaging ; this presents a conundrum , as all treatments for cerebral aneurysms are associated with potential complications . The International Study of <unk> Intracranial <unk> ( <unk> ) provided prognostic data both in people having previously had a subarachnoid hemorrhage and people who had aneurysms detected by other means . Those having previously had a SAH were more likely to bleed from other aneurysms . In contrast , those having never bled and had small aneurysms ( smaller than 10 mm ) were very unlikely to have a SAH and were likely to sustain harm from attempts to repair these aneurysms . On the basis of the <unk> and other studies , it is now recommended that people are considered for preventive treatment only if they have a reasonable life expectancy and have aneurysms that are highly likely to rupture . At the same time , there is only limited evidence that endovascular treatment of <unk> aneurysms is actually beneficial . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 Management involves general measures to stabilize the patient while also using specific investigations and treatments . These include the prevention of rebleeding by obliterating the bleeding source , prevention of a phenomenon known as vasospasm , and prevention and treatment of complications . 
 Stabilizing the patient is the first priority . Those with a depressed level of consciousness may need to be intubated and mechanically ventilated . Blood pressure , pulse , respiratory rate , and Glasgow Coma Scale are monitored frequently . Once the diagnosis is confirmed , admission to an intensive care unit may be preferable , especially since 15 percent may have further bleeding soon after admission . Nutrition is an early priority , with oral or nasogastric tube feeding being preferable over parenteral routes . In general , analgesia ( pain control ) is restricted to less @-@ sedating agents such as codeine , as sedation may impact on the mental status and thus interfere with the ability to monitor the level of consciousness . Deep vein thrombosis is prevented with compression stockings , intermittent pneumatic compression of the calves , or both . A bladder catheter is usually inserted to monitor fluid balance . Benzodiazepines may be administered to help relieve distress . Antiemetic drugs should be given to awake persons . 
 Patients with poor clinical grade on admission , acute neurologic deterioration or progressive enlargement of ventricles on CT Scan are , in general , indications for the placement of an external ventricular drain by a neurosurgeon . The external ventricular drain may be inserted at the bedside or in the operating room . In either case , strict aseptic technique must be maintained during insertion . In patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage the <unk> is used to remove cerebrospinal fluid , blood , and blood byproducts that increase intracranial pressure and may increase the risk for cerebral vasospasm . 
 = = = Prevention of rebleeding = = = 
 People whose CT scan shows a large hematoma , depressed level of consciousness or focal neurologic symptoms may benefit from urgent surgical removal of the blood or occlusion of the bleeding site . The remainder are stabilized more extensively and undergo a <unk> angiogram or CT angiogram later . It is hard to predict who will have a <unk> , yet it may happen at any time and carries a dismal prognosis . After the first 24 hours have passed , rebleeding risk remains around 40 percent over the subsequent four weeks , suggesting that interventions should be aimed at reducing this risk as soon as possible . Some predictors of early rebleeding are high systolic blood pressure , the presence of a hematoma in the brain or ventricles , poor Hunt @-@ Hess grade ( III @-@ IV ) , aneurysms in the posterior circulation , and an aneurysm > 10 mm in size . 
 If a cerebral aneurysm is identified on angiography , two measures are available to reduce the risk of further bleeding from the same aneurysm : clipping and coiling . Clipping requires a craniotomy ( opening of the skull ) to locate the aneurysm , followed by the placement of clips around the neck of the aneurysm . <unk> is performed through the large blood vessels ( <unk> ) : a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin and advanced through the aorta to the arteries ( both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries ) that supply the brain . When the aneurysm has been located , platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm , obliterating it . The decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon , <unk> and often other health professionals . 
 In general , the decision between clipping and coiling is made on the basis of the location of the aneurysm , its size and the condition of the patient . <unk> of the middle cerebral artery and its related vessels are hard to reach with angiography and tend to be amenable to clipping . Those of the basilar artery and posterior cerebral artery are hard to reach surgically and are more accessible for endovascular management . These approaches are based on general experience , and the only randomized controlled trial directly comparing the different modalities was performed in relatively well patients with small ( less than 10 mm ) aneurysms of the anterior cerebral artery and anterior communicating artery ( together the " anterior circulation " ) , who constitute about 20 percent of all patients with aneurysmal SAH . This trial , the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial ( <unk> ) , showed that in this group the likelihood of death or being dependent on others for activities of daily living was reduced ( 7 @.@ 4 percent absolute risk reduction , 23 @.@ 5 percent relative risk reduction ) if endovascular coiling was used as opposed to surgery . The main drawback of coiling is the possibility that the aneurysm will recur ; this risk is extremely small in the surgical approach . In <unk> , 8 @.@ 3 percent needed further treatment in the longer term . Hence , people who have undergone coiling are typically followed up for many years afterwards with angiography or other measures to ensure recurrence of aneurysms is identified early . Other trials have also found a higher rate of recurrence necessitating further treatments . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 <unk> , in which the blood vessels constrict and thus restrict blood flow , is a serious complication of SAH . It can cause ischemic brain injury ( referred to as " delayed ischemia " ) and permanent brain damage due to lack of oxygen in parts of the brain . It can be fatal if severe . Delayed ischemia is characterized by new neurological symptoms , and can be confirmed by transcranial doppler or cerebral angiography . About one third of all people admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage will have delayed ischemia , and half of those have permanent damage as a result . It is possible to screen for the development of vasospasm with transcranial doppler every 24 – 48 hours . A blood flow velocity of more than 120 centimeters per second is suggestive of vasospasm . 
 The use of calcium channel blockers , thought to be able to prevent the spasm of blood vessels by preventing calcium from entering smooth muscle cells , has been proposed for the prevention of vasospasm . The oral calcium channel blocker nimodipine improves outcome if administered between the fourth and twenty @-@ first day after the hemorrhage , even if it does not significantly reduce the amount of vasospasm detected on angiography . In traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage , nimodipine does not affect long @-@ term outcome , and is not recommended . Other calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate have been studied , but are not presently recommended ; neither is there any evidence that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously . 
 Some older studies have suggested that statin therapy might reduce vasospasm , but a subsequent meta @-@ analysis including three further trials did not demonstrate evidence for benefit of statin use on either vasospasm or clinical outcomes . 
 A protocol referred to as " triple H " is often used as a measure to treat vasospasm when it causes symptoms ; this is the use of intravenous fluids to achieve a state of hypertension ( high blood pressure ) , <unk> ( excess fluid in the circulation ) and <unk> ( mild dilution of the blood ) . Evidence for this approach is inconclusive ; no randomized controlled trials have been undertaken to demonstrate its benefits . 
 If the symptoms of delayed ischemia do not improve with medical treatment , angiography may be attempted to identify the sites of <unk> and administer vasodilator medication ( drugs that relax the blood vessel wall ) directly into the artery . <unk> ( opening the constricted area with a balloon ) may also be performed . 
 = = = Other complications = = = 
 <unk> ( obstruction of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid ) may complicate SAH in both the short and long term . It is detected on CT scanning , on which there is enlargement of the lateral ventricles . If the level of consciousness is decreased , drainage of the excess fluid is performed by therapeutic lumbar puncture , <unk> drain ( a temporary device inserted into one of the ventricles ) or occasionally a permanent shunt . Relief of hydrocephalus can lead to an enormous improvement in a person 's condition . Fluctuations in blood pressure and electrolyte disturbances , as well as pneumonia and cardiac <unk> occur in about half the hospitalized persons with SAH and may worsen prognosis . Seizures occur during the hospital stay in about a third of cases . Many believe that patients might benefit from prevention with antiepileptic drugs . Although this is widely practiced , it is controversial and not based on good evidence . In some studies , use of these drugs was associated with a worse prognosis ; although it is unclear whether this might be because the drugs themselves actually cause harm , or because they are used more often in persons with a poorer prognosis . There is a possibility of a gastric hemorrhage due to stress ulcers . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 = = = Short @-@ term outcomes = = = 
 SAH is often associated with a poor outcome . The death rate ( mortality ) for SAH is between 40 and 50 percent , but trends for survival are improving . Of those that survive hospitalization , more than a quarter have significant restrictions in their lifestyle , and less than a fifth have no residual symptoms whatsoever . Delay in diagnosis of minor SAH ( mistaking the sudden headache for migraine ) contributes to poor outcome . Factors found on admission that are associated with poorer outcome include poorer neurological grade ; systolic hypertension ; a previous diagnosis of heart attack or SAH ; liver disease ; more blood and larger aneurysm on the initial CT scan ; location of an aneurysm in the posterior circulation ; and higher age . Factors that carry a worse prognosis during the hospital stay include occurrence of delayed ischemia resulting from vasospasm , development of intracerebral hematoma or intraventricular hemorrhage ( bleeding into the ventricles of the brain ) and presence of fever on the eighth day of admission . 
 So @-@ called " angiogram @-@ negative subarachnoid hemorrhage " , SAH that does not show an aneurysm with four @-@ vessel angiography , carries a better prognosis than SAH with aneurysm ; however , it is still associated with a risk of ischemia , rebleeding and hydrocephalus . <unk> SAH ( bleeding around the mesencephalon in the brain ) , however , has a very low rate of rebleeding or delayed ischemia , and the prognosis of this subtype is excellent . 
 The prognosis of head trauma is thought to be influenced in part by the location and amount of subarachnoid bleeding . It is difficult to isolate the effects of SAH from those of other aspects of traumatic brain injury ; it is unknown whether the presence of subarachnoid blood actually worsens the prognosis or whether it is merely a sign that a significant trauma has occurred . People with moderate and severe traumatic brain injury who have SAH when admitted to a hospital have as much as twice the risk of dying as those who do not . They also have a higher risk of severe disability and persistent vegetative state , and traumatic SAH has been correlated with other markers of poor outcome such as post traumatic epilepsy , hydrocephalus , and longer stays in the intensive care unit . However , more than 90 percent of people with traumatic subarachnoid bleeding and a Glasgow Coma Score over 12 have a good outcome . 
 There is also modest evidence that genetic factors influence the prognosis in SAH . For example , having two copies of <unk> ( a variant of the gene encoding apolipoprotein E that also plays a role in Alzheimer 's disease ) seems to increase risk for delayed ischemia and a worse outcome . The occurrence of hyperglycemia ( high blood sugars ) after an episode of SAH confers a higher risk of poor outcome . 
 = = = Long @-@ term outcomes = = = 
 <unk> symptoms , such as fatigue , mood disturbances , and other related symptoms are common sequelae . Even in those who have made good neurological recovery , anxiety , depression , posttraumatic stress disorder , and cognitive impairment are common ; 46 percent of people who have had a subarachnoid hemorrhage have cognitive impairment that affects their quality of life . Over 60 percent report frequent headaches . <unk> subarachnoid hemorrhage may lead to damage of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland , two areas of the brain that play a central role in hormonal regulation and production . More than a quarter of people with a previous SAH may develop hypopituitarism ( deficiencies in one or more of the hypothalamic @-@ pituitary hormones such as growth hormone , luteinizing hormone or follicle @-@ stimulating hormone ) . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 According to a review of 51 studies from 21 countries , the average incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage is 9 @.@ 1 per 100 @,@ 000 annually . Studies from Japan and Finland show higher rates in those countries ( 22 @.@ 7 and 19 @.@ 7 , respectively ) , for reasons that are not entirely understood . South and Central America , in contrast , have a rate of 4 @.@ 2 per 100 @,@ 000 on average . 
 Although the group of people at risk for SAH is younger than the population usually affected by stroke , the risk still increases with age . Young people are much less likely than middle @-@ age people ( risk ratio 0 @.@ 1 , or 10 percent ) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage . The risk continues to rise with age and is 60 percent higher in the very elderly ( over 85 ) than in those between 45 and 55 . Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men the same age , probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause , such as a decrease in estrogen levels . 
 Genetics may play a role in a person 's disposition to SAH ; risk is increased three- to fivefold in first @-@ degree relatives of people having had a subarachnoid hemorrhage . However , lifestyle factors are more important in determining overall risk . These risk factors are smoking , hypertension ( high blood pressure ) and excessive alcohol consumption . Having smoked in the past confers a doubled risk of SAH compared to those who have never smoked . Some protection of uncertain significance is conferred by Caucasian ethnicity , hormone replacement therapy and diabetes mellitus . There is likely an inverse relationship between total serum cholesterol and the risk of non @-@ traumatic SAH , though confirmation of this association is hindered by a lack of studies . Approximately 4 percent of aneurysmal bleeds occur after sexual intercourse and 10 percent of people with SAH are bending over or lifting heavy objects at the onset of their symptoms . 
 Overall , about 1 percent of all people have one or more cerebral aneurysms . Most of these , however , are small and unlikely to rupture . 
 = = History = = 
 While the clinical picture of subarachnoid hemorrhage may have been recognized by Hippocrates , the existence of cerebral aneurysms and the fact that they could rupture was not established until the 18th century . The associated symptoms were described in more detail in 1886 by Edinburgh physician Dr Byrom Bramwell . In 1924 , London neurologist Sir Dr Charles P. Symonds ( 1890 – 1978 ) gave a complete account of all major symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage , and he coined the term " spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage " . Symonds also described the use of lumbar puncture and xanthochromia in diagnosis . 
 The first surgical intervention was performed by Mr Norman Dott , who was a pupil of Dr Harvey Cushing then working in Edinburgh . He introduced the wrapping of aneurysms in the 1930s , and was an early pioneer in the use of angiograms . American neurosurgeon Dr Walter Dandy , working in Baltimore , was the first to introduce clips in 1938 . <unk> was applied to aneurysm treatment in 1972 in order to further improve outcomes . The 1980s saw the introduction of triple H therapy as a treatment for delayed ischemia due to vasospasm , and trials with nimodipine in an attempt to prevent this complication . In 1983 , the Russian neurosurgeon <unk> and colleagues reported the first use of <unk> balloon angioplasty for vasospasm after aneurysmal SAH . The Italian neurosurgeon Dr Guido Guglielmi introduced his endovascular coil treatment in 1991 .

 Richard Karl Freiherr von Weizsäcker ( listen ; 15 April 1920 – 31 January 2015 ) was a German politician ( CDU ) , who served as President of the Federal Republic of Germany ( West Germany until 1990 ) from 1984 to 1994 . Born into the aristocratic Weizsäcker family , he took his first public offices in the Evangelical Church in Germany . 
 A member of the CDU since 1954 , he was elected as member of parliament in 1969 . He continued to hold a mandate as member of the Bundestag until he became Governing Mayor of West Berlin , following the 1981 state elections . In 1984 , von Weizsäcker was elected as President of the Federal Republic of Germany . During his presidency , German reunification was accomplished through the incorporation of the territory of the former German Democratic Republic into the Federal Republic of Germany on 3 October 1990 . 
 He is considered the most popular of Germany 's presidents , held in high regard particularly for his impartiality . His demeanor often saw him at odds with his party colleagues , particularly longtime Chancellor Helmut Kohl . He was famous for his speeches , especially one he delivered at the 40th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe on 8 May 1985 . Upon his death , his life and political work were widely praised , with The New York Times calling him " a guardian of his nation 's moral conscience " .

 Richard von Weizsäcker was born on 15 April 1920 in the New Castle in Stuttgart , the son of diplomat Ernst von Weizsäcker , a member of the noted Weizsäcker family , and his wife Marianne ( née von <unk> ) . Ernst von Weizsäcker was a career diplomat and a high @-@ ranking official in the Foreign Ministry in the 1930s . The youngest of four children , Weizsäcker had two brothers , the physicist and philosopher Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker and Heinrich von Weizsäcker , and also a sister , Elisabeth . In 1967 , Elisabeth married Dr Konrad <unk> , the former Secretary General of the World Council of Churches . His grandfather Karl von Weizsäcker was Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Württemberg , and was ennobled in 1897 and raised to the hereditary title of Baron ( Freiherr ) in 1916 . 
 Because his father was a career diplomat , Weizsäcker spent much of his childhood in Switzerland and Scandinavia . The family lived in Basel 1920 – 24 , in Copenhagen 1924 – 26 , and in Bern 1933 – 36 , where Richard attended the Swiss Gymnasium <unk> . The family lived in Berlin , in an apartment in the <unk> in Wilmersdorf , between 1929 and 1933 and again from 1936 until the end of the Second World War . Weizsäcker was able to miss the third class of his elementary school , and entered a secondary school at the young age of nine , the Bismarck @-@ Gymnasium ( now the Goethe @-@ Gymnasium ) in Wilmersdorf . When he was 17 years old , Weizsäcker travelled to England to study philosophy and history at Balliol College , Oxford . In London , he witnessed the coronation of King George VI . He spent the winter semester of 1937 / 38 at the University of Grenoble in France to improve his French . He was mustered for the army there in 1938 and moved back to Germany the same year to start his Reichsarbeitsdienst . 
 = = = Second World War = = = 
 After the outbreak of the Second World War , Weizsäcker joined the German army , ultimately rising to the rank of Captain in the Reserves . He joined his brother Heinrich 's regiment , the Infantry Regiment 9 Potsdam . He crossed over the border to Poland with his regiment on the very first day of the war . His brother Heinrich was killed about a hundred meters away from him on the second day . Weizsäcker watched over his brother 's body through the night , until he was able to bury him the next morning . His regiment , consisting in a large part of noble and conservative Prussians , played a significant part in the 20 July plot , with no fewer than nineteen of its officers involved in the conspiracy against Hitler . Weizsäcker himself helped his friend Axel von dem Bussche in an attempt to kill Hitler at a uniform inspection in December 1943 , providing Bussche with travel papers to Berlin . The attempt had to be called off when the uniforms were destroyed by an air raid . Upon meeting Bussche in June 1944 , Weizsäcker was also informed of the imminent plans for 20 July , and assured him of his support , but the plan ultimately failed . Weizsäcker later described the last nine months of the war as " agony " . He was wounded in East Prussia in 1945 and was transported home to Stuttgart , to see out the end of the war on a family farm at Lake Constance . 
 = = = Education , marriage and early work life = = = 
 At the end of the war Weizsäcker continued his study of history in Göttingen and went on to study law , but he also attended lectures in physics and theology . In 1947 , when his father Ernst von Weizsäcker was a defendant in the Ministries Trial for his role in the deportation of Jews from occupied France , Richard von Weizsäcker served as his assistant defence counsel . He took his first legal <unk> in 1950 , his second in 1953 , and finally earned his doctorate ( doctor juris ) in 1955 . In 1953 he married Marianne von Kretschmann . They had met when she was an 18 @-@ year @-@ old schoolgirl and he was <unk> in 2010 , Weizsäcker described the marriage as " the best and smartest decision of my life " . They had four children : Robert Klaus von Weizsäcker , a professor of economics at the Munich University of Technology , Andreas von Weizsäcker , an art professor at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich , Beatrice von Weizsäcker , a lawyer and journalist , and Fritz Eckart von Weizsäcker , chief physician at the <unk> @-@ <unk> in Berlin . In the late 1970s , his son Andreas was a student at the <unk> . When reports about sexual abuse there surfaced in 2010 , it was speculated in the media that Andreas might have been one of the victims , but this was denied by the family . Andreas died of cancer in June 2008 , aged 51 . 
 Weizsäcker worked for Mannesmann between 1950 and 1958 , as a scientific assistant until 1953 , as a legal counsel from 1953 , and as head of the department for economic policy from 1957 . From 1958 to 1962 , he was head of the <unk> Bank , a bank owned by relatives of his wife . From 1962 to 1966 , he served on the board of directors of Boehringer Ingelheim , a pharmaceutical company . 
 = = German Evangelical Church Assembly = = 
 Between 1964 and 1970 , Weizsäcker served as President of the German Evangelical Church Assembly . He was also a member of the Synod and the Council of the Evangelical Church in Germany from 1967 – 1984 . During his early tenure as President , he wrote a newspaper article supporting a memorandum written by German evangelical intellectuals including Werner Heisenberg and his brother Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker who had spoken out in favour of accepting the Oder – Neisse line as the western border of Poland as an indispensable precondition for lasting peace in Europe . While this was met by negative reactions from politicians , especially in Weizsäcker 's own party , he nevertheless led the Evangelical Church on a way to promoting reconciliation with Poland , leading to a memorandum by the Church in both West and East Germany . The paper was widely discussed and met with a significantly more positive response . 
 = = Political career = = 
 Weizsäcker joined the CDU in 1954 . Some years later , Chancellor Helmut Kohl offered him a safe seat for the 1965 elections , even going so far as to have Konrad Adenauer write two letters urging him to run , but Weizsäcker declined , due to his work in the German Evangelical Church Assembly , wanting to avoid a conflict of interest . However , he became a member of the Bundestag ( Federal Diet ) at the 1969 federal elections , serving until 1981 . 
 In 1974 Weizsäcker was the Presidential candidate of his party for the first time , but he lost to Walter Scheel of the FDP , who was supported by the ruling center @-@ left coalition . Ahead of the 1976 elections , CDU chairman Helmut Kohl included him in his shadow cabinet for the party ’ s campaign to unseat incumbent Helmut Schmidt as chancellor . Between 1979 and 1981 , Weizsäcker served as Vice President of the Bundestag . 
 = = = Governing Mayor of West Berlin , 1981 – 1984 = = = 
 Weizsäcker served as the Governing Mayor ( <unk> Bürgermeister ) of West Berlin from 1981 to 1984 . During his years in office , he tried to keep alive the idea of a cultural nation called Germany , divided into two states . In his speeches and writings , he repeatedly urged his compatriots in the Federal Republic to look upon themselves as a nation firmly anchored in the Western alliance , but with special obligations and interests in the East . Weizsäcker irritated the United States , France and Britain , the half @-@ city 's occupying powers , by breaking with protocol and visiting Erich Honecker , the East German Communist Party chief , in East Berlin . 
 From 1981 to 1983 , Weizsäcker headed a minority government in West Berlin , after the CDU had only won 48 per cent of seats in the state assembly . His government was tolerated by the Free Democratic Party , who were in a coalition with the Social Democrats at the federal level at the time . After Helmut Kohl had won the federal election in 1983 and had formed a government with the Free Democrats , Weizsäcker did the same in West Berlin .

 Richard von Weizsäcker took office as President on 1 July 1984 . In his inaugural address , he appealed to his nation 's special consciousness , saying : " Our situation , which differs from that of most other nations , is no reason to deny ourselves a national consciousness . To do so would be unhealthy for ourselves and eerie to our neighbors . " He dedicated his first years in office mainly to foreign policy , travelling widely with Foreign Minister Hans @-@ Dietrich Genscher and choosing former Foreign Office employees as his personal advisors . 
 Speech on the 40th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe on 8 May 1945 
 Weizsäcker , who was known as a great speaker , delivered his most famous speech in 1985 , marking the 40th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe on 8 May 1945 . This came at a difficult time in West German politics . The country was caught up in a debate about whether Holocaust denial should be criminalized . At the same time , chancellor Helmut Kohl had accepted an invitation to visit a congress of the Silesian association of expellees which was to take place under the slogan " Silesia is ours ! " ( " Schlesien ist unser ! " ) . This seemed to contradict the official position of the federal diet and government , so that Kohl needed to lobby for the intended slogan to be changed . 
 It was originally planned that United States President Ronald Reagan should take part in the Second World War memorial event in the Bundestag , shifting the emphasis from remembering the past to highlighting West Germany in its partnership with the Western Bloc . On Weizsäcker 's strong urging , the occasion was marked without Reagan , who visited West Germany several days earlier instead , surrounding the G7 @-@ summit in Bonn . Reagan 's visit nevertheless sparked controversy , especially in the United States . In an attempt to reproduce the gesture made by Kohl and French President François Mitterrand a year earlier at Verdun , the chancellor and Reagan were set to visit the military cemetery in Bitburg . This raised objections , since the cemetery was the last resting place for several members of the Waffen @-@ SS . 
 It was in this climate that Weizsäcker addressed parliament on 8 May 1985 . Here , he articulated the historic responsibility of Germany and Germans for the crimes of Nazism . In contrast to the way the end of the war was still perceived by a majority of people in Germany at the time , he defined 8 May as a " day of liberation " . Weizsäcker pointed out the inseparable link between the Nazi takeover of Germany and the tragedies caused by the Second World War . In a passage of striking boldness , he took issue with one of the most cherished defenses of older Germans . " When the unspeakable truth of the Holocaust became known at the end of the war , " he said , " all too many of us claimed they had not known anything about it or even suspected anything . " 
 Most notably , Weizsäcker spoke of the danger of forgetting and distorting the past . " There is no such thing as the guilt or innocence of an entire nation . Guilt is , like innocence , not collective but personal . There is discovered or concealed individual guilt . There is guilt which people acknowledge or deny . [ ... ] All of us , whether guilty or not , whether young or old , must accept the past . We are all affected by the consequences and liable for it . [ ... ] We Germans must look truth straight in the eye – without embellishment and without distortion . [ ... ] There can be no reconciliation without remembrance . " 
 Weizsäcker declared that younger generations of Germans " cannot profess a guilt of their own for crimes they did not commit . " With his speech , Weizsäcker was also one of the first representatives of Germany to remember the homosexual victims of Nazism as a " victim group . " This was also the case with his recognition of the Sinti and Roma as another victim group , a fact that was highlighted by the long @-@ time head of the Central Council of German Sinti and Roma , Romani Rose . 
 Weizsäcker 's speech was praised both nationally and internationally . The New York Times called it a " sober message of hope to the uneasy generations of young West Germans " . The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany , Werner <unk> , thanked Weizsäcker for his strong words , as did Karl Ibach , a former member of the German Resistance , who called his speech a " moment of glory ( <unk> ) of our republic " . Weizsäcker was however criticized for some of his remarks by members of his own party . Lorenz <unk> , a politician of the sister party CSU , who had not taken part in the ceremony , objected to the term " day of liberation " , referring to it instead as a " day of deepest humiliation " . The Greens were also absent during the speech , choosing instead to visit Auschwitz . A year later , the Green politician Petra Kelly called the speech " correct , but not more than self @-@ evident " , pointing to speeches president Gustav Heinemann had made during his presidency . The harshest criticism came from the Federation of <unk> , whose president Herbert <unk> , while thanking the president for highlighting the expellees ' fate , criticized his remark that " conflicting legal claims must be subordinated under the imperative of reconciliation " . 
 The speech was later released on vinyl and sold around 60 @,@ 000 copies . Two million printed copies of its text were distributed globally , translated into thirteen languages , with 40 @,@ 000 being sold in Japan alone . This does not include copies of the speech printed in newspapers , such as the New York Times , which reproduced it in full . 
 Role in the Historians ’ Dispute 
 Speaking to a congress of West German historians in Bamberg on 12 October 1988 , Weizsäcker rejected the attempts by some historians to compare the systematic murder of Jews in Nazi Germany to mass killings elsewhere – like those in Cambodia under Pol Pot or in Stalin 's purges – or to seek external explanations for it . Thereby he declared an end to the <unk> ( ' historians ' dispute ' ) that had sharply divided German scholars and journalists for two years , stating " Auschwitz remains unique . It was perpetrated by Germans in the name of Germany . This truth is immutable and will not be forgotten . " 
 In his remarks to the historians , Weizsäcker said their dispute had prompted accusations that they sought to raise a " multitude of comparisons and parallels " that would cause " the dark chapter of our own history to disappear , to be reduced to a mere episode . " Andreas Hillgruber , a historian at Cologne University and one of the instigators of the debate with a book he published in 1986 in which he linked the collapse of the eastern front and the Holocaust , declared himself in full agreement with Weizsäcker , insisting that he had never tried to " <unk> " the past .

 Unification of Germany 
 Because of the high esteem in which he was held by Germany 's political establishment and in the population , Weizsäcker is so far the only candidate to have stood for elections for the office of President unopposed ; he was elected in that way to a second term of office on 23 May 1989 . 
 Weizsäcker took office for his second presidential term on 1 July 1989 , and in the course of it he oversaw the end of the Cold War and the Reunification of Germany . Thereupon , Weizsäcker became the first all @-@ German Head of State since Karl Dönitz in May 1945 . At midnight on 3 October 1990 , during the official festivities held before the Reichstag building in Berlin to mark the moment of the reunification of Germany , President Weizsäcker delivered the only speech of the night , immediately after the raising of the flag , and before the playing of the National Anthem . His brief remarks , however , were almost inaudible , due to the sound of the bells marking midnight , and of the fireworks that were released to celebrate the moment of reunification . In those remarks he praised the accomplishment of German unity in freedom and in peace . He gave a longer speech at the act of state at the Berliner <unk> later that day . 
 President of a unified Germany 
 In 1990 , Weizsäcker became the first head of state of the German Federal Republic to visit Poland . During his four @-@ day visit , he reassured Poles that the newly unified German state would treat their western and northern borders , which included prewar German lands , as inviolable . 
 In 1992 , Weizsäcker gave the eulogy at the state funeral of former Chancellor Willy Brandt at the Reichstag , the first state funeral for a former chancellor to take place in Berlin since the death of Gustav Stresemann in 1929 . The funeral was attended by an array of leading European political figures , including French President François Mitterrand , Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev . 
 Weizsäcker stretched the traditionally ceremonial position of Germany ’ s president to reach across political , national , and age boundaries to address a wide range of controversial issues . He is credited with being largely responsible for taking the lead on an asylum policy overhaul after the arson attack by neo @-@ Nazis in <unk> , in which three Turkish citizens died in 1993 . He also earned recognition at home and abroad for attending memorial services for the victims of neo @-@ Nazi attacks in <unk> and Solingen . The services were snubbed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl , who dismayed many Germans by saying it was not necessary for the government to send a representative . 
 In March 1994 , Weizsäcker attended the Frankfurt premiere of the film Schindler 's List along with the Israeli ambassador , Avi <unk> , and the head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany , Ignatz <unk> . 
 During the debate over the change of the seat of the German government from Bonn to Berlin , the president spoke out in favor of Berlin . In a memorandum released in February 1991 , he declared that he would not act as a mere " decoration of a so @-@ called capital " , urging the diet to move more constitutional organs to Berlin . To compensate for a delay in the transfer to Berlin of the government and the federal parliament , Weizsäcker declared in April 1993 that he would be performing an increased share of his duties in Berlin . He decided not to wait for the renovation and conversion as the presidential seat of the <unk> ( Crown Prince 's Palace ) at Berlin 's Unter den Linden boulevard , and to use instead his existing official residence in West Berlin , the Bellevue Palace beyond Tiergarten park . 
 Critique of party politics 
 In an interview book released in 1992 , midway through his second term , Weizsäcker voiced a harsh critique of the leading political parties in Germany , claiming that they took a larger role in public life than was awarded to them by the constitution . He criticized the high number of career politicians ( <unk> ) , who " in general are neither expert nor dilettante , but generalists with particular knowledge only in political battle " . The immediate reactions toward this interview were mixed . Prominent party politicians such as Rainer Barzel and Johannes Rau criticized the remarks , as did Minister of Labour Norbert <unk> , who asked the president to show more respect towards the work done by party members . Former chancellor Helmut Schmidt , on the other hand , conceded that Weizsäcker was " essentially right " . While comments from politicians were mainly negative , a public poll conducted by the <unk> @-@ Institut in June 1992 showed that 87 @.@ 4 per cent of the population agreed with the president . Political commentators generally interpreted the remarks as a hidden attack on the incumbent chancellor Helmut Kohl , since Weizsäcker 's relationship with his former patron had cooled over the years . In a column for the German newspaper Der Spiegel , chief @-@ editor Rudolf <unk> criticized the president for his attack , writing : " You cannot have it both ways : on the one hand giving a right and seminal political incentive , but on the other hand insulting the governing class and its chief " . 
 Travels 
 On his trip to Israel in October 1985 , Weizsäcker was greeted on arrival by his Israeli counterpart , President Chaim Herzog . The president was given a full honor @-@ guard welcome at Ben @-@ Gurion Airport ; among Cabinet ministers who lined up to shake his hand were right @-@ wingers of the <unk> party , the main faction of Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir 's Likud party , who had previously refused to greet German leaders . Weizsäcker 's visit was the first by a head of state , but not the first by a West German leader , as Chancellor Willy Brandt had paid a visit to Israel in June 1973 . During a four @-@ day state visit to the United Kingdom in July 1986 , Weizsäcker addressed a joint session of the Houses of Parliament , the first German to be accorded that honor . 
 In 1987 , he travelled to Moscow to meet Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in what was perceived as a difficult time in West German @-@ Soviet relations , after chancellor Kohl had angered Moscow by comparing Gorbachev to Joseph Goebbels . During a speech at the Kremlin , Weizsäcker said : " The Germans , who today live separated into East and West , have never stopped and will never stop to feel like one nation . " His speech was , however , censored in the official Communist Party newspaper Pravda . However , when German foreign minister Hans @-@ Dietrich Genscher protested against this to his Soviet counterpart Eduard Shevardnadze , the speech was then printed unabridged in the lesser paper Izvestia . Weizsäcker also appealed to the Soviet authorities to agree to a pardon for the last inmate in the Spandau Prison , former Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess . This proved unsuccessful , and Hess committed suicide six weeks later . The visit was nevertheless considered a success , as Gorbachev was quoted afterwards saying that " a new page of history was opened " , after the two had discussed matters of disarmament . Also in 1987 , Erich Honecker became the first East German leader to visit the Federal Republic . While state guests in Germany are usually welcomed by the President , Honecker was still not greeted officially by Weizsäcker , but by chancellor Kohl , since the Federal Republic did not consider the GDR a foreign state . Weizsäcker did however receive Honecker later at his seat of office , the Hammerschmidt Villa . 
 = = Post @-@ presidency = = 
 As an elder statesman , Weizsäcker long remained involved in politics and charitable affairs in Germany after his retirement as president . He chaired a commission established by the Social Democratic @-@ Green government of the day for reforming the Bundeswehr . Along with Henry Kissinger , in 1994 he supported Richard Holbrooke in creating the American Academy in Berlin . He was also a member of the Board of Trustees of the Robert Bosch Stiftung . 
 Weizsäcker served as a member of the Advisory Council of Transparency International . In a letter addressed to Nigeria 's military ruler Sani Abacha in 1996 , he called for the immediate release of General Olusegun <unk> , the former head of state of Nigeria , who had become the first military ruler in Africa to keep his promise to hand over power to an elected civilian government but was later sentenced to 15 years imprisonment . 
 Weizsäcker also served on many international committees . He was chairman of the Independent Working Group on the future of the United Nations and was one of three " Wise Men " appointed by European Commission President Romano Prodi to consider the future of the European Union . From 2003 until his death , he was a member of the Advisory Commission on the return of cultural property seized as a result of Nazi persecution , especially Jewish property , led by the former head of the Federal Constitutional Court , Jutta <unk> . In November 2014 , Weizsäcker retired as chairman of the <unk> Round Table , a discussion forum on foreign policy issues . 
 = = = Death and funeral = = = 
 Weizsäcker died in Berlin on 31 January 2015 . He was survived by his wife , Marianne , and three of their four children . Upon his death , there was general praise for his life and political career . In its obituary , the New York Times called Weizsäcker " a guardian of his nation ’ s moral conscience " , while The Guardian commented that Germany was " uniquely fortunate " in having had him as a leader . 
 He was honored with a state funeral on 11 February 2015 at Berlin Cathedral . Eulogies were given by incumbent president Joachim Gauck , foreign minister Frank @-@ Walter Steinmeier ( SPD ) , finance minister Wolfgang <unk> ( CDU ) and former vice president of the Bundestag Antje Vollmer ( Green Party ) . Steinmeier praised Weizsäcker 's role in foreign relations , where he had worked towards reconciliation with France and Poland and supported a dialogue with the communist regimes in the East , often against his own party . The funeral was attended by many serving high @-@ ranking politicians in Germany , including chancellor Angela Merkel . Also in attendance were former presidents Roman Herzog , Horst Köhler , and Christian Wulff , as well as former chancellors Helmut Schmidt and Gerhard Schröder . Princess Beatrix , former Queen of the Netherlands , was also present , as was former Polish president Lech Wałęsa . After the ceremony , soldiers stood to attention as Weizsäcker 's coffin was brought to its resting place at Waldfriedhof Dahlem . In the subsequent days , many Berliners visited Weizsäcker 's grave to pay tribute and lay down flowers . 
 = = Relationship with his party and Helmut Kohl = = 
 Weizsäcker , who had joined the CDU in 1954 , was known for often publicly voicing political views different from his own party line , both in and out of the presidential office . While he was himself sceptical of Willy Brandt 's Ostpolitik , he urged his party not to block it entirely in the lower house , the Bundestag , since rejection would be met with dismay abroad . When the CDU gained a sweeping victory in the state elections in Baden @-@ Württemberg in April 1972 , his party decided to take the opportunity to dispose of chancellor Brandt with a vote of no confidence , replacing him with Rainer Barzel , and Weizsäcker was one of only three elect CDU politicians to speak out against the proposal . He maintained an easy @-@ going and open demeanor towards members of all other parties . In 1987 , at a time when the CDU actively tried to label the Green Party as unconstitutional , the President had regular contact with high @-@ ranking Green politicians such as Antje Vollmer , who was also active in the Evangelical Church in Germany , and Joschka Fischer , who said that with his understanding of state " he [ Weizsäcker ] is closer to the Green Party than to Kohl , not NATO , but Auschwitz as reason of state ( <unk> ) . " 
 Helmut Kohl , who served as Chancellor of Germany from 1982 to 1998 , was an early patron of Weizsäcker 's , effectively helping him into parliament . However , their relationship took a first strain in 1971 , when Weizsäcker supported Rainer Barzel over Kohl for the CDU @-@ chairmanship . Subsequently , Kohl unsuccessfully tried to deny Weizsäcker the chance to become president in 1983 . After he had taken office , Weizsäcker criticized Kohl 's government on numerous occasions , taking liberties not previously heard of from someone in a ceremonial role such as his . For instance , he urged the chancellor to recognize the Oder – Neisse line and spoke out for a more patient approach to the journey towards German reunification . Other examples include the aforementioned speech in 1985 and his critique of party politics in 1992 . Following a critical interview Weizsäcker gave to Der Spiegel magazine in September 1997 , Kohl reacted during a meeting of his parliamentary group by saying that Weizsäcker ( whom he called " that gentleman " ) was no longer " one of us " . This was followed by CDU spokesman Rolf Kiefer stating that the CDU had removed Weizsäcker from its membership database , since the former president had not paid his membership fees in a long time . Weizsäcker then took the matter to the party 's arbitrating body and won . The tribunal ruled that he was allowed to let his membership rest indefinitely . After his death , Spiegel editor Gerhard <unk> called Weizsäcker the " intellectual alternative medicine to Kohl " . 
 After his presidency came to an end , Weizsäcker remained vocal in daily politics , e.g. speaking for a more liberal immigration policy , calling the way his party handled it " simply ridiculous " . He also spoke out in favour of dual citizenship and a change of German citizenship law from jus sanguinis to jus soli , a view not generally shared by his party colleagues . Towards the former East @-@ German leading party , the PDS ( today called Die Linke ) , Weizsäcker urged his party colleagues to enter into a serious political discussion . He went as far as speaking in favor of a coalition government between Social Democrats and the PDS in Berlin after the 2001 state election . 
 = = Publications = = 
 Weizsäcker 's publications include Die deutsche Geschichte <unk> <unk> ( German History Continues ) , first published in 1983 ; Von Deutschland aus ( From Germany Abroad ) , a collection of speeches first published in 1985 ; Von Deutschland nach Europa ( From Germany to Europe , 1991 ) and his memoirs Vier Zeiten ( Four Times ) , published in German in 1997 and in English as From Weimar to the Wall : My Life in German Politics in 1999 . In a review in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung , Friedrich Karl Fromme wrote that the memoirs tell nothing new about the times he lived in , but " something about the person " . In 2009 , he published a book on his recollections of German reunification , titled Der Weg zur Einheit ( The Path to Unity ) . German newspaper Die Welt dismissed the book as " boring " , accusing the account of being too balanced .

 = Battle of Long Island = 
 The Battle of Long Island , also known as the Battle of Brooklyn and the Battle of Brooklyn Heights , fought on August 27 , 1776 , was the first major battle of the American Revolutionary War to take place after the United States declared its independence on July 4 , 1776 . It was a victory for the British Army and the beginning of a successful campaign that gave them control of the strategically important city of New York . In terms of troop deployment and fighting , it was the largest battle of the entire war . 
 After defeating the British in the Siege of Boston on March 17 , 1776 , General George Washington , commander @-@ in @-@ chief , brought the Continental Army to defend the port city of New York , then limited to the southern end of Manhattan Island . Washington understood that the city 's harbor would provide an excellent base for the British Navy during the campaign . There he established defenses and waited for the British to attack . In July , the British , under the command of General William Howe , landed a few miles across the harbor from Manhattan on the sparsely @-@ populated Staten Island , where , during the next month and a half , they were slowly reinforced by ships in Lower New York Bay , bringing their total force to 32 @,@ 000 troops . With the British fleet in control of the entrance to the harbor at the Narrows , Washington knew the difficulty in holding the city . Believing Manhattan would be the first target , he moved there the bulk of his forces . 
 On August 22 the British landed on the shores of Gravesend Bay in southwest Kings County , across the Narrows from Staten Island and more than a dozen miles south from the established East River crossings to Manhattan . After five days of waiting , the British attacked American defenses on the Guan Heights . Unknown to the Americans , however , Howe had brought his main army around their rear , and attacked their flank soon after . The Americans panicked , resulting in twenty percent losses through casualties and captures , although a stand by 400 Maryland troops prevented a larger portion of the army from being lost . The remainder of the army retreated to the main defenses on Brooklyn Heights . The British dug in for a siege but , on the night of August 29 – 30 , Washington evacuated the entire army to Manhattan without the loss of supplies or a single life . Washington and the Continental Army were driven out of New York entirely after several more defeats , and forced to retreat through New Jersey and into Pennsylvania .

 = = = Boston to New York = = = 
 In the first stage of the war the British Army was trapped in the then @-@ peninsular city of Boston and , on March 17 , they abandoned it , setting sail to Halifax , Nova Scotia , to await reinforcements . Washington then began to transfer regiments to New York City where he believed that the British would next attack because of its strategic importance . Washington left Boston on April 4 , arrived at New York on April 13 , and established headquarters at the former home of Archibald Kennedy on Broadway facing Bowling Green . Previously , in February , Washington had sent his second in command , Charles Lee , ahead to New York to establish the city 's defenses . Lee remained in New York City until March , when the Continental Congress sent him to South Carolina ; the defenses ' construction was left to General William Alexander ( Lord Stirling ) . Troops were in limited supply , so Washington found the defenses incomplete , but Lee had concluded that with the British validly commanding the sea it would be impossible to hold the city . Lee reasoned that the defenses should be located with the ability to inflict upon the British heavy casualties if any move was made to take and hold ground . Barricades and redoubts were established in and around the city , and across the East River , in Brooklyn Heights facing the city , the bastion of Fort Stirling . Lee also saw that the immediate area was cleared of Loyalists . 
 = = = Strategy = = = 
 Washington began moving troops to Brooklyn in early May so that , within a short time , there were a few thousand of them in Brooklyn . On the eastern side of the East River , three more forts were under construction to support Fort Stirling , which stood to the west of the hamlet of Brooklyn Heights : Fort Putnam ( named for Rufus Putnam , not to be confused with the later Fort Putnam at West Point ) , Fort Greene ( named for Nathanael Greene ) and Fort Box ( named for Major Daniel Box ) . They lay from north to south , with Fort Putnam furthest to the north , Greene slightly to the southwest and Box slightly further southwest . Each of these defensive structures were surrounded by a large ditch , all connected by a line of entrenchments and a total of 36 cannons ( mostly 18 @-@ pounders ) .
