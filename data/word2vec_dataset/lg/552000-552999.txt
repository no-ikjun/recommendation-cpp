 Some evidence of early evolutionary history is the structure of the antennal heart , a separate circulatory organ consisting of two ampullae , or vesicles , that are attached to the frontal cuticle to the bases of the antennae . These features have not been found in other insects . An independent organ exists for each antenna , consisting of an ampulla , attached to the frontal cuticle medial to the antenna base and forming a thin @-@ walled sac with a <unk> ostium on its ventral side . They pump blood by elastic connective tissue , rather than muscle . 
 Molecular studies suggest that this order is the sister to Plecoptera or to Ephemeroptera .

 = = = Distinguishing characteristics = = = 
 The characteristics which distinguish the order Dermaptera from other insect orders are : 
 General body shape : <unk> ; dorso @-@ ventrally flattened . 
 Head : <unk> . Antennae are segmented . Biting @-@ type mouthparts . Ocelli absent . Compound eyes in most species , reduced or absent in some taxa . 
 <unk> : Two pairs of wings normally present . The forewings are modified into short smooth , <unk> tegmina . <unk> are membranous and semicircular with veins radiating outwards . 
 Abdomen : Cerci are unsegmented and resemble forceps . The ovipositor in females is reduced or absent . 
 The overwhelming majority of earwig species are in Forficulina , grouped into nine families of 180 genera , including Forficula <unk> , the common European Earwig . Species within Forficulina are free @-@ living , have functional wings and are not parasites . The cerci are unsegmented and modified into large , forceps @-@ like structures . 
 The first epizoic species of earwig was discovered by a London taxidermist on the body of a Malaysian hairless bulldog bat in 1909 , then described by Karl Jordan . By the 1950s , the two suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina had been added to Dermaptera . 
 Arixeniina represents two genera , <unk> and <unk> , with a total of five species in them . As with Hemimerina , they are blind and wingless , with filiform segmented cerci . Hemimerina are viviparous ectoparasites , preferring the fur of African rodents in either <unk> or <unk> genera . Hemimerina also has two genera , <unk> and <unk> , with a total of 11 species .

 Dermaptera ( = <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> ) is relatively small compared to the other orders of Insecta , with only about 2 @,@ 000 species , 3 suborders and 15 families , including the extinct suborders Archidermaptera and Eodermaptera with their extinct families <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . The phylogeny of the Dermaptera is still debated . The extant Dermaptera appear to be monophyletic and there is support for the monophyly of the families Forficulidae , <unk> , Labiduridae and Anisolabididae , however evidence has supported the conclusion that the former suborder Forficulina was paraphyletic through the exclusion of Hemimerina and Arixeniina which should instead be nested within the Forficulina . Thus , these former suborders were eliminated in the most recent higher classification . The following is from Engel & Haas ( 2007 ) :

 Earwigs are fairly abundant and are found in many areas around the world . There is no evidence that they transmit diseases to humans or other animals . Their pincers are commonly believed to be dangerous , but in reality , even the curved pincers of males cause little or no harm to humans . It is a common myth that earwigs crawl into the human ear and lay eggs in the brain . 
 There is a debate whether earwigs are harmful or beneficial to crops , as they eat both the insects eating the foliage ( such as aphids ) and the foliage itself , though it would take a large population to do considerable damage . The common earwig eats a wide variety of plants , and also a wide variety of foliage including the leaves and petals . They have been known to cause economic losses in fruit and vegetable crops . Some examples are the flowers , hops , red raspberries , and corn crops in Germany , and in the south of France , earwigs have been observed feeding on peaches and apricots . The earwigs attacked mature plants and made cup @-@ shaped bite marks 3 – 11 mm ( 0 @.@ 12 – 0 @.@ 43 in ) in diameter .

 California Chrome ( foaled February 18 , 2011 ) is an American Thoroughbred racehorse . Winner of the 2014 Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes , he was named the 2014 American Horse of the Year . After a difficult 2015 season , he returned to form in 2016 and won the Dubai World Cup . He is currently the all time leading North American horse in earnings won . 
 Bred in California , the chestnut @-@ colored horse was named for his flashy white markings , called " chrome " by horse aficionados . He was bred and originally owned by Perry Martin from Yuba City , California , and Steve Coburn of Topaz Lake , Nevada , who named their partnership DAP Racing , standing for " Dumb Ass Partners " — a tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek response to a passerby who questioned their wisdom in purchasing California Chrome 's dam , Love the Chase . In 2015 , Coburn sold his minority share to Taylor Made Farm , and a new ownership group , California Chrome , LLC , was formed . The horse is trained by the father – son team of Art and Alan Sherman . Dedicated fans — called " Chromies " — actively supported California Chrome , who has been called " the people 's horse " . 
 As a two @-@ year @-@ old , the horse ran inconsistently until being paired with the jockey Victor Espinoza . The rapport that developed between Espinoza and California Chrome led to a six @-@ win streak in 2013 – 2014 . After winning the San Felipe Stakes and Santa Anita Derby , California Chrome was the morning line favorite for the Kentucky Derby . Critics downplayed his chances of winning , but were proven wrong when California Chrome won by 1 3 ⁄ 4 lengths even though Espinoza eased him for the final 70 yards ( 64 m ) . In the Preakness , he fended off two strong challengers in the homestretch and won by 1 1 ⁄ 2 lengths . He then shipped to Belmont Park with hopes of winning the Triple Crown in the 2014 Belmont Stakes . In that race , California Chrome was stepped on by the horse next to him at the start , tearing some tissue from his right front heel . With no one aware of his injury until the race was over , he finished fourth in a dead heat with Wicked Strong . After healing and pasture rest , he returned to racing in September then ran in the 2014 Breeders ' Cup Classic , finishing a respectable third , only a neck behind the winner , Bayern . California Chrome returned to his winning form in his first start on a turf course in the Hollywood Derby in late November , becoming the only horse in the United States with Grade I wins in 2014 on both dirt and turf tracks . He won many accolades and awards for the season : The California State Legislature unanimously passed a resolution recognizing his outstanding performance , and the city of Fresno proclaimed October 11 , 2014 , as " California Chrome Day " . He won the 2014 Secretariat Vox Populi Award , his Kentucky Derby win was awarded the NTRA " Moment of the Year " , and he won Eclipse Awards for American Champion Three @-@ Year @-@ Old Male Horse and American Horse of the Year . 
 California Chrome 's 2015 season was tumultuous . He began the year with second @-@ place finishes in the San Antonio Stakes and Dubai World Cup . He then shipped from Dubai to the United Kingdom to train for the Prince of Wales 's Stakes at Royal Ascot , but was scratched a few days prior to the race due to a hoof bruise . Upon returning to the US in July 2015 , he was diagnosed with bruising on his cannon bones , which ended his 2015 season . Shortly thereafter , Coburn sold his ownership interest , and in the same week , Art Sherman announced that the horse would return to racing in 2016 . After a rest of several months at Taylor Made , he returned to training with Sherman at Los Alamitos Race Course and began his 2016 season by winning the Grade II San Pasqual Stakes at Santa Anita Park . He then was shipped to Dubai , where he won a second prep race and the 2016 Dubai World Cup . On July 23 , he won the San Diego Handicap in preparation for the Pacific Classic in August .

 California Chrome was foaled on February 18 , 2011 , near Coalinga , California , at Harris Farms , the horse breeding division of the Harris Ranch . He is a chestnut with four white stockings and a blaze . At four years old , he stood 16 hands ( 64 inches , 163 cm ) tall . 
 As a foal , he was nicknamed " Junior " because of his resemblance to his sire , Lucky Pulpit . Lucky Pulpit had won three races , placed in several graded stakes races , and hit the board in 13 of his 22 starts . However , a viral respiratory infection damaged his breathing and limited him to racing over short distances . California Chrome 's dam is Love the Chase , and he was her first foal . She was purchased for $ 30 @,@ 000 as a two @-@ year @-@ old by an agent for a horse ownership group called the Blinkers On Racing Stable . As a two- and three @-@ year @-@ old filly , she was often so anxious in the saddling paddock , that she was , in effect , losing races before she ever got to the starting gate . She ran six times and won on her fourth try in a February 2009 maiden claiming race at Golden Gate Fields . After her win , Steve Coburn and Perry Martin became her owners , ran her two more times , then retired her later that year . They hoped she would become a good broodmare , as she had a promising pedigree . When she retired , it was discovered that she had raced with a breathing problem — an entrapped epiglottis that restricted her air intake , but which could be corrected with surgery . As of 2015 , she had given birth to four foals , the two fillies and a colt , all full siblings to California Chrome . After California Chrome became a Kentucky Derby contender , Martin and Coburn turned down an offer of $ 2 @.@ 1 million for Love the Chase . 
 = = = Ownership = = = 
 California Chrome was bred by Perry Martin of Yuba City , California , and Steve Coburn of Topaz Lake , Nevada . Their wives , Denise Martin and Carolyn Coburn , were closely involved with the partnership , though not listed as owners on official records kept by <unk> . Perry Martin held a 70 % share in the horse and was the managing owner . Coburn owned a 30 % interest in the horse and sold his share to Taylor Made Farm in July 2015 . 
 Originally , the two couples each owned a five percent share in Love the Chase through membership in the Blinkers On Racing Stable . When Blinkers On Racing Stable dissolved the Love the Chase syndicate , both shareholders wanted to buy the filly , so they formed a partnership and paid $ 8 @,@ 000 for her . A casual observer , knowing Love the Chase 's modest race record , remarked that only a " dumb ass " would buy her , so Coburn and Martin named their racing operation DAP Racing , for " Dumb Ass Partners " . They created a caricature of a buck @-@ toothed donkey to adorn the back of their racing silks , and put the initials " DAP " on California Chrome 's blinker hood and the left front of the jockey 's silks . 
 The Martins and the Coburns had in common a fondness for California Chrome , but otherwise very different personalities and backgrounds . The Martins seldom talked to the press . Melissa <unk> of The New York Times described them as the " quiet thinkers , " noting that Perry Martin planned the mating of Lucky Pulpit to Love the Chase , mapped out a " Road to the Derby " racing plan for California Chrome , and promoted use of a nasal strip for the horse 's races . Originally from Chicago , they moved to California in 1987 , where Perry Martin was employed as a metallurgist by the Air Force and Denise briefly job shadowed a racehorse trainer in the Sacramento area . Today they own and operate Martin Testing Laboratories ( <unk> ) , which tests high @-@ reliability items such as automobile airbags and medical equipment . 
 By contrast , <unk> characterized the more outgoing Coburns as the " public relations arm " of the partnership . Steve Coburn , characterized by the media as " loquacious " , described himself and his wife Carolyn as " just everyday people " . He is a press operator for a company that makes magnetic strips , and Carolyn Coburn retired from a career working in payroll in the health care industry . Carolyn introduced Steve to horse racing , and when he was looking for a tax write @-@ off she encouraged him to buy into a racing syndicate instead of purchasing a small airplane . 
 Taylor Made Farm , who purchased Coburn 's share in California Chrome is headed by Duncan Taylor , the president and CEO of the family @-@ owned farm . Ben Taylor is the vice president of the company 's Taylor Made Stallions division . The brothers of the Taylor family have been the sole the owners of the corporation since 1986 . They were raised in the horse business , learning from their father and grandfather . They formed Taylor Made Sales Agency in 1976 , when Duncan was 19 , offering boarding for mares shipped into Kentucky . They expanded to sales consignments and then built their own facility on 120 acres owned by their father in Nicholasville , Kentucky . The farm now is 1 @,@ 600 acres today . By early 2016 , his ownership was officially listed as " California Chrome , LLC " . Perry and Denise Martin were described as the " majority owners " by the Daily Racing Form , and Frank Taylor of Taylor Made said that both the Martins and Taylor Made had each sold " a few " shares in the stallion to " select breeders who would support the horse " 
 = = = Early years = = = 
 Harris Farms , where California Chrome was bred , foaled , and lived until the age of two , had previously nurtured champions such as two @-@ time Breeders ' Cup Classic winner Tiznow . In 2010 Love the Chase was bred to the Harris Farms stallion Lucky Pulpit . CNN reported that the stud fee for the breeding was $ 2 @,@ 000 . Steve Coburn said he had a dream three weeks before California Chrome 's birth that the foal would be a colt with four white feet and a blaze . California Chrome was relatively large for a newborn horse , weighing 137 pounds ( 62 kg ) , and active , " running circles around Momma " within two hours of birth . Love the Chase suffered a uterine laceration while foaling , and was placed on an IV due to internal bleeding . The mare and foal were stall @-@ bound together for over a month . She was kept on a catheter that administered anti @-@ bleeding medication , and the farm staff checked her two to three times a day . Because people gave the colt extra attention and affection when they cared for his dam , he imprinted on humans as well as his mother . As a result , California Chrome became very people @-@ focused , a trait that has served him well in race training . 
 The Martins and Coburns chose California Chrome 's official name in 2013 at Brewsters Bar & Grill in Galt , California , a town halfway between their two homes . Each of the four wrote a potential name on pieces of paper and asked a waitress to draw them out of Coburn 's cowboy hat . They submitted the names to The Jockey Club ranked in the order drawn . California Chrome , Coburn 's choice , was first drawn , and the registry accepted the name . The word " chrome " comes from slang for a horse with flashy white markings . The colt was started under saddle by Harris Farms ' trainer Per <unk> , who described him as a " smart horse " who was " really nice to work with " . 
 = = = Sherman Training Stables = = = 
 Perry Martin considered California Chrome a Derby contender even before the colt raced . When the colt was ready to enter race training at age two , Martin asked Steve Sherman , who had trained horses for Martin at Golden Gate Fields , to recommend a trainer based in the highly competitive southern California area . Steve suggested his father , Art , who had an " old school " reputation for patience with young Thoroughbreds and a small racing stable of about 15 horses , which allowed each animal to be given individualized attention . Art Sherman liked the enthusiasm of Martin and Coburn , but when Martin emailed a " Road to the Kentucky Derby " plan outlining which races California Chrome should run , Sherman was dubious . Later , Sherman 's son Alan stated , " [ Martin ] mapped out a trail for this horse ; it 's actually worked to a ' T ' , so it 's kinda amazing . " Art Sherman downplays his role in training California Chrome , saying " This horse is my California rock star . I 'm just his manager . " 
 Sherman 's first exposure to a Kentucky Derby horse was in 1955 , when at the age of 18 he worked for Rex Ellsworth and was the exercise rider of that year 's Kentucky Derby winner Swaps . He was a professional jockey from 1957 until 1979 , when he turned to training racehorses . California Chrome was the first Kentucky Derby prospect that Sherman had trained . Art Sherman 's assistant is his son , Alan , who is also a licensed trainer . Rather than run a separate stable like his brother Steve , Alan has worked with his father since 1991 . He does most of the hands @-@ on day @-@ to @-@ day work with California Chrome and stayed with him throughout most of his travels when Art returned to California to oversee the rest of the stable . 
 Unlike many high @-@ end California Thoroughbred trainers , who usually are headquartered at Santa Anita Park , the Shermans kept horses at Hollywood Park , but when it closed in December 2013 , Los Alamitos Race Course picked up some of the Thoroughbred races and racing trainers who had stabled horses there , including Sherman Training Stables . The success of California Chrome , who was conditioned there over the track that had been recently expanded to accommodate longer races , created good publicity for Los Alamitos . 
 = = = Behavior = = = 
 Observers commented that California Chrome appears to be a very intelligent horse , as he expresses curiosity about everything around him . He has certain idiosyncrasies , including a fondness for one specific brand of horse cookies . He has a tendency to perform a flehmen response for no obvious reason , particularly when he is being bathed , prompting the press to claim that he is " smiling " . He will deliberately stop and put his ears forward to " pose " for cameras when he hears them clicking . As Alan Sherman explained , " He 's a ham , he loves the cameras " ; and exercise rider Willie Delgado gave him an additional nickname , " Vogue " . Besides his frequent flehmen response , he was also noted for having publicly " <unk> " behavior in conjunction with winning races , notably in the paddock before the Kentucky Derby and Preakness , and the day after the Hollywood Derby . As Sherman stated , " He 's ... a stallion , and he 'll let you know it every once in a while . " Another unusual behavior is that he would not walk forward out of horse vans designed for a forward exit ; he would only back out . 
 On the track , California Chrome has the ability to use tactical speed at nearly any point in a race . Early in California Chrome 's career he tended to be slow out of the starting gate ; if he had to wait too long for the start he sometimes expressed anxiety by rocking from side to side , preventing him from being oriented straight forward when the gate opened . He overcame this problem by the end of the 2014 season , and learned to break quickly . He generally did not run well on the inside or in close quarters ; two of his worst finishes were in races where he had the number one post position , and his fourth @-@ place performance in the Belmont Stakes was attributed to both his injury at the start and the number two draw . However , he won a 2016 prep race at Meydan Racecourse from the number one post . When outside and in the clear , he usually wins .

 California Chrome 's first start was in a maiden race at Hollywood Park in April 2013 , where he placed second by a length . Three weeks later , he won a maiden race by 2 3 ⁄ 4 lengths . In both races , he was ridden by Alberto Delgado . About a month later , California Chrome was entered in the Willard L. Proctor Memorial Stakes . He was one of four horses assigned to carry 120 pounds ( 54 kg ) , the highest impost given by the handicapper . Alberto Delgado was out with a broken ankle , so Corey <unk> was his rider . The colt was second for the first three furlongs but finished fifth in a field of nine . His next two races were at Del Mar racetrack . Delgado returned as his jockey , and California Chrome scored his second career win in the Graduation Stakes , a race limited to California @-@ bred horses , prevailing by 2 3 ⁄ 4 lengths . He carried the same weight over the same distance as his previous race , but this time he wore blinkers and ran on Lasix for the first time in his career . Next was his first graded stakes race , the seven @-@ furlong , Grade I Del Mar Futurity . He ran strongly , but finished sixth after he got caught in traffic in a field of 11 horses and was accidentally hit in the face by another jockey 's whip . Two months later , California Chrome ran in the Golden State Juvenile Stakes held November 1 at Santa Anita Park , and at 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) , was the longest race he had run . He was assigned the number 1 post position and had to wait for all the other horses to load . He became anxious , reared in the gate , was last out , struggled throughout the race , and again finished sixth . 
 Sherman 's public assessment of California Chrome 's poor performances was that he was still growing and learning how to be a racehorse . But several things began to change . In the fall of 2013 , Alberto 's younger brother , Willie Delgado , an experienced rider and trainer whose career in Maryland was in the doldrums , moved to California and within a couple of months became the horse 's morning exercise rider . At roughly the same time , Alberto was taken off the horse as jockey . In December , California Chrome began wearing a new type of horseshoe . He had developed low heels , and his farrier , Judd Fisher , found that a particular style of glued @-@ on horseshoe with a durable , <unk> pad that raised a horse 's heels was suitable for fixing the problem . Instead of gluing it on , Fisher custom @-@ drilled holes into the shoe so it could be nailed to the horse 's feet in the manner of a traditional metal shoe . According to Fisher , nailing on the shoes raised the soles of the horse 's feet a little bit farther off the ground . It may have been a contributing factor to California Chrome 's subsequent series of wins . Aside from that issue , Sherman described the horse 's hooves as generally healthy . 
 Hollywood Park hosted California Chrome 's final race of 2013 , the King Glorious Stakes on December 22 . He had a lighter impost of 119 pounds ( 54 kg ) , a shorter distance of seven furlongs , and a new jockey , Victor Espinoza . California Chrome won the race by 6 1 ⁄ 4 lengths , becoming the final stakes winner at Hollywood Park Racetrack , which held its last races that day . Sherman was pleased with Espinoza 's riding , and Espinoza was impressed in turn with California Chrome . Alan Sherman later said that it was after this race that he began to think that California Chrome could be a Kentucky Derby contender . 
 = = = 2014 : Three @-@ year @-@ old season = = = 
 California Chrome began 2014 with the California Cup Derby on January 25 . Espinoza returned as his jockey . California Chrome was slow coming out of the gate but quickly moved up to third , took the lead coming into the homestretch , and won by 5 1 ⁄ 2 lengths . Sherman noted that it was the second consecutive race where the horse pulled clear and won by a decisive margin , stating , " It 's like the light bulb has gone on . " 
 California Chrome 's first graded stakes win was the March 8 Grade II San Felipe Stakes . Espinoza tried a different riding tactic and let the horse go to the lead right out of the gate . California Chrome led most of the way , and after Espinoza gave him one tap on the shoulder with the whip , the horse pulled away from the field at the top of the homestretch and won by 7 1 ⁄ 2 lengths . Alan Sherman said , " My jaw dropped " , while Art Sherman joked , " I 'm glad I 'm training at Los Alamitos , because he looked like a 350 [ yard ] horse coming out of the gate " ; a reference to Quarter Horse racing sprint distances . Espinoza remarked , " I wanted to let him enjoy his race , " later adding , " I wanted to see if he [ could ] go wire to wire ... that was the day I found out how much he loves to run . " The San Felipe was California Chrome 's first win in a race open to all three @-@ year @-@ olds , not just California @-@ breds , and earned him 50 points in the Road to the Kentucky Derby system . 
 California Chrome 's first Grade I win was the Santa Anita Derby on April 8 . California Chrome was at the front of the field by the quarter pole and went on to win the $ 1 million race by 5 1 ⁄ 4 lengths . Prior to the race , his owners had turned down a $ 6 million offer for a 51 % controlling interest in the colt that would have mandated putting the horse with a different trainer . Coburn later explained , " This isn 't about the money , this is about the dream . " 
 California Chrome 's time of 1 : 47 @.@ 52 earned him a Beyer Speed Figure of 107 , the fastest for any horse in the Road to the Kentucky Derby 's final prep races of 2014 . It was also the second fastest time in the history of the Santa Anita Derby ; the only horses to run faster were Lucky <unk> , Sham , and Indian Charlie , who hold a three @-@ way tie for the record at 1 : 47 : 00 . The decisive win made him an early favorite to win the 2014 Kentucky Derby and raised speculation that he had the talent to win the Triple Crown . California Chrome 's four consecutive wins had a combined victory margin of 24 1 ⁄ 4 lengths . After the Santa Anita Derby , Sherman began to describe the colt as " my Swaps " . Of his growing popularity , Denise Martin commented , " He 's not just our horse anymore ; he 's ... the people 's horse . " 
 = = = = Kentucky Derby = = = = 
 Prior to 2014 , only three California @-@ bred horses had won the Kentucky Derby : <unk> in 1922 , Swaps in 1955 , and Decidedly in 1962 . Besides Swaps , other horses to win both the Santa Anita Derby and the Kentucky Derby were I 'll Have Another ( 2012 ) , Sunday Silence ( 1989 ) , Winning Colors ( 1988 ) , Affirmed ( 1978 ) , Majestic Prince ( 1969 ) , Lucky <unk> ( 1965 ) , Determine ( 1954 ) , and Hill Gail ( 1952 ) . ( 1952 ) Steve Coburn predicted a win : " I 'm not being cocky , just positive " , he said . 
 Prior to the May 3 race , rival trainer Bob Baffert compared California Chrome favorably to War Emblem . Trainer D. Wayne Lukas , who had no entries in the 2014 Derby , told a reporter that he intended to bet on the horse and commented , " He 's looked like the real deal ... I like everything about him . " On the other hand , Dallas Stewart , trainer of rival Commanding Curve , dismissed California Chrome 's chances due to his pedigree and the supposed lack of competition in his prior races . Others doubted his ability because the colt had never raced outside California . In contrast to the critics , reports surfaced that the owners had turned down a new offer of $ 10 million . 
 The colt arrived at Churchill Downs in Louisville , Kentucky , on April 28 , 2014 , and was one of the last Derby contenders to arrive . He was flown in from California , his first time on a plane , and traveled quietly . Once the plane landed , however , his travel idiosyncrasy was discovered by the waiting press when he refused to be unloaded until he was turned around and backed down the ramp ; Alan Sherman explained later that this was also his typical manner of egress from ground @-@ based transportation . Upon arrival at Churchill Downs , the horses entered in the Kentucky Derby each were given a special saddle cloth to wear while exercising on the track , identifying them as Derby contenders and including their name . The one given to California Chrome contained a typographical error , with California misspelled as " <unk> " . He wore it the first day and then the track management obtained one with the correct spelling . Critics commented that bringing the horse in late and not giving him a full workout on the track was a mistake , but Sherman 's strategy was backed by Lukas . In the days leading up to the race , California Chrome galloped on the track , was walked in the saddling paddock , and schooled at the starting gate . Willie Delgado later remarked that the horse did not particularly like that particular track , saying " he never actually felt comfortable on it . " 
 California Chrome 's connections drew post position five for the Derby . He was the morning line favorite at odds of 5 – 2 . The press suggested that the number five spot , relatively close to the inside rail , could be a problem owing to the " speed horses " that would go to the front early in the race , surrounding him on both sides , especially if the colt was slow out of the gate . Espinoza countered by pointing out that he won the 2002 Kentucky Derby on War Emblem from the same post position . 
 In the race , California Chrome had a clean start and could have taken the lead , but Espinoza kept him behind two speed horses and only moved him to the front at the final turn when other horses began to tire . In the homestretch , he opened up a lead of five lengths before Espinoza eased him the last 70 yards of the race , narrowing his winning margin to 1 3 ⁄ 4 lengths . Sherman later explained that Espinoza slowing the colt down at the finish was " saving something for the next one " , a reference to the Preakness Stakes to come two weeks later . The winning time of 2 : 03 @.@ 66 was relatively slow for a Kentucky Derby , but Sherman described Espinoza 's ride as " picture perfect " . This win was Espinoza 's second Derby victory , and 77 @-@ year @-@ old Sherman became the oldest trainer to ever win the race . 
 In a post @-@ race press interview , Sherman said he had visited Swaps ' grave at the Kentucky Derby Museum prior to the Derby and prayed for success . Trainer Dale Romans , who had asserted that California Chrome had no chance to win , said , " I was very , very wrong ... We might have just seen a super horse and a super trainer . You don 't fake your way to the winner 's circle at the Kentucky Derby . " 
 = = = = Preakness Stakes = = = = 
 California Chrome shipped on May 12 to Baltimore to run in the 2014 Preakness Stakes on May 17 . On the plane were the other two Derby competitors to enter the Preakness : Ride On Curlin and General a Rod . Once on the ground , their van had a police escort from the airport to Pimlico Race Course . When California Chrome arrived at Pimlico , the management at that track welcomed him with two <unk> for his workouts , one with the " <unk> " misspelling and the other with the correct spelling ; Just as at Churchill Downs , the colt exercised on the Pimlico track but had no timed workouts . Delgado compared the long and narrow Pimlico oval favorably to their home track at Los Alamitos . Sherman did not like having the horse race again with only a two @-@ week break , but was confident because California Chrome had gained back weight he had lost running the Derby , plus another 35 pounds ( 16 kg ) . 
 News stories continued to question the colt 's ability , noting the relatively slow pace of the Derby and the low Beyer Speed Figure of 97 earned in his win . One trainer said , " California Chrome has to prove again he 's the best 3 @-@ year @-@ old . " The horse was assigned the number three post position in a field of ten horses , and was the morning line odds @-@ on favorite at 3 – 5 . Followers noted that Secretariat had also run the 1973 Preakness Stakes from the number three post . The Thursday before the race , California Chrome was observed coughing after his morning gallop , prompting speculation about his health . He had a small blister in his throat , which he also had prior to the Kentucky Derby , both times treated with a glycerine throat wash . The intense press attention paid to the relatively minor issue was dismissively dubbed " throat @-@ gate " by sportswriter Bill <unk> of the Los Angeles Times . 
 On race day , California Chrome made a clean start from the gate , was close to the front through the backstretch , made his bid for the lead at the far turn , and was first by the top of the stretch . The second @-@ place finisher was Ride on Curlin , who made a strong move late in the race to finish 1 1 ⁄ 2 lengths behind California Chrome . Both held off a challenge from Social Inclusion , who tired and finished third . General a Rod was fourth . The winning time was 1 : 54 : 84 , earning a Beyer Speed Figure of 105 . Social Inclusion 's owner , Ron Sanchez , said , " He 's the real deal ... My horse came to challenge him , but he found another engine . He was gone . " Espinoza 's ride was described as " flawless " , and the press noted the special affinity between the horse and jockey . 
 California Chrome became the only California @-@ bred horse ever to win both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness . The press considered the Preakness to be the horse 's strongest victory to date . Baffert , who had won the first two legs of the Triple Crown with Silver Charm ( 1997 ) , Real Quiet ( 1998 ) , and War Emblem ( 2002 ) , sent three different horses against California Chrome , and after Bayern had finished second to last in the Preakness , said , " I 'm done chasing him , " adding , " he 's super the real deal . " In post @-@ race interviews , Coburn stated that California Chrome had become " America 's Horse " .

 The day after the Preakness , a new round of minor press excitement , dubbed " <unk> " , erupted when Sherman commented that Martin might not let California Chrome run in the Belmont Stakes if the New York Racing Association ( <unk> ) did not allow the horse to wear a nasal strip as he had in his previous six races . Nasal strips are not considered performance @-@ enhancing , but may reduce airway resistance , lower the risk of exercise @-@ induced pulmonary hemorrhage ( <unk> ) , and aid post @-@ race recovery . Sherman submitted a formal request for permission to use them , and the following day , the <unk> approved the use of nasal strips for all horses on New York tracks , thus resolving the matter . 
 California Chrome shipped to New York on May 20 in a semi @-@ trailer horse van together with Ride On Curlin . They had a police escort through New York City from the Throgs Neck Bridge to Belmont Park . The press reported that Art Sherman believed the misspelled saddle cloths at the Derby and Preakness were a good luck charm , and that he specifically asked Belmont Park for another misspelled cloth along with a properly spelled version . The first week California Chrome spent at the Belmont track was generally uneventful , other than galloping past an opossum that wandered onto the track the morning of May 23 . The horse paid little attention to it , but the press pounced on the story ; the animal was labeled " Dumb @-@ Ass Possum " , and someone created a Twitter account for the creature . Delgado commented , " I can tell you he loves this track , and I don 't see him ( having ) any problem getting a mile and a half . " On May 31 , Espinoza arrived to give the colt a short workout known as a " breeze " . Horse and jockey were greeted by a large contingent of fans and press at about 6 : 30 a.m. , and ran a " sharp " half @-@ mile ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) officially clocked at 47 @.@ 69 seconds . A <unk> for the Daily Racing Form stated , " He 's going to be tough to beat . I think we 're going to have a Triple Crown winner . " 
 Eleven horses entered the Belmont Stakes on June 7 , and California Chrome drew post position 2 , the same post position as Secretariat in the 1973 Belmont . Ride On Curlin and General a Rod also entered ; they were the only other horses besides California Chrome to contest all three legs of the Triple Crown . Four entries had run in Kentucky Derby but skipped the Preakness , and there were four " New Shooters " who had not run in either of the previous Triple Crown races , including Tonalist and Matterhorn , who each wound up playing a major role in the race . Anticipating the possibility of a Triple Crown champion , several people connected to the last three Triple Crown winners came to the Belmont , including 92 @-@ year @-@ old Penny Chenery , owner of Secretariat ; Patrice Wolfson , who co @-@ owned Affirmed ; and some of Seattle Slew 's connections — trainer Billy Turner and co @-@ owner Jim Hill . The jockeys of the three past Triple Crown winners , Steve <unk> , Jean <unk> , and Ron Turcotte , also attended . <unk> , jockey of Affirmed , stated , " This horse has got a great chance of pulling it off , " but added , " you never know , that 's why they have to run the race . " 
 On race day California Chrome did not break boldly . Espinoza later explained something felt " off " and he held the horse back a bit instead of going to the lead . When asked to move to the front , the horse did not unleash his usual burst of speed . Immediately following the race , Espinoza said " He was just a little bit empty today " . Tonalist won the race , and California Chrome finished fourth in a dead heat with Wicked Strong . Initial post @-@ race analysts criticized Espinoza for not taking the horse to the front early on , but noticed that California Chrome had had some blood on his right front heel . After the race , review of photos taken at the start showed that the horse next to him , Matterhorn , moved too far to the left and stepped on California Chrome 's heel as both horses broke from the gate . As a result , California Chrome had run the race with a " chunk " of tissue taken out of his right front heel and a small cut on his tendon . The tendon injury was superficial , but the heel injury may have been a factor in his loss . Sherman explained that he knew that something was not right when he saw the horse throw his head up in the homestretch , and speculated later that the sand and dirt of the racetrack caused pain in the open wound . The following day , Sherman assured the press that both injuries would heal . 
 Coburn generated controversy after the race , when he said the current Triple Crown system allowed " the coward 's way out " because fresh horses who had not run in the Kentucky Derby or Preakness Stakes could challenge horses who contested all three legs . Sherman downplayed the outburst , saying , " [ Coburn ] was at the heat of the moment ... Sometimes the emotions get in front of you . " Two days later , Coburn apologized , saying he wanted to congratulate the owners of Tonalist and adding , " I wanted so much for [ California Chrome ] to win the Triple Crown for the people of America . " Steve Haskin of Blood @-@ Horse magazine summarized the race stating , " when I think back ... the one image that will last forever will be of an exhausted colt walking back through the tunnel with a bloodstained foot , his head down and breathing hard , and every vein protruding from his sweat @-@ soaked body . He had given every ounce of himself , and with it all , still was beaten only 1 3 ⁄ 4 lengths . " 
 California Chrome returned to Los Alamitos , where Sherman 's crew treated the wound for about 10 days . After that , they sent California Chrome to Harris Farms where he was turned out on pasture . By early July , his foot was fully healed , he had gained weight , and Sherman was pleased enough with his recovery that he brought the colt back to Los Alamitos to resume training on July 17 , two weeks earlier than anticipated .

 California Chrome was the top @-@ ranked three @-@ year @-@ old in the nation by the NTRA in its post @-@ race poll of June 9 , 2014 , in spite of his Belmont loss , and was fifth @-@ ranked among American horses of all ages . In the June 12 World 's Best Racehorse Rankings , published by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities , he was ranked fifth in the world , one point behind the only American @-@ based horse rated higher , Santa Anita Handicap winner Game On Dude , who was tied for third . 
 California Chrome raced next in the September 20 Pennsylvania Derby at Parx Racing . He was the favorite , but drew the inside number 1 post position . Kentucky Derby rivals Candy Boy and <unk> also entered . Bayern , who had a poor performance in the Preakness Stakes but later won the Haskell Invitational , was the second favorite . Parx provided significant financial incentives to any horse entering who previously won a triple crown race or other selected Grade I races , so California Chrome 's connections earned $ 200 @,@ 000 simply for having him start . Trapped on the rail , first by a speed horse in the initial stages of the race , and again on the far turn by a challenger who faded in the stretch , California Chrome was unable to gain momentum and finished sixth . Bayern had a clean trip , leading wire to wire , and won by 5 3 ⁄ 4 lengths . Espinoza explained , " I never really had a chance to let him run the way he had been running . " 
 The next race was the Breeders ' Cup Classic on November 1 . Because many leading older horses retired in 2014 , most of the main contenders for the 2014 Classic were the three year olds : in addition to California Chrome , former foes Bayern , Candy Boy and Tonalist entered . His chief rival was considered to be the then @-@ undefeated American Champion Two @-@ Year @-@ Old Colt , Shared Belief , a gelding who missed the Triple Crown series due to hoof problems ; the two had never faced each other . California Chrome was 4 @-@ 1 on the morning line , second favorite to Shared Belief . In the race , Bayern bumped into Shared Belief at the start , then took the lead for the duration of the race . California Chrome was clear of traffic , maintained third place for most of the race , was closing at the end , and finished a very close third , only a neck behind winner Bayern , who won by a nose over second @-@ place finisher Toast of New York . Shared Belief was fourth . Post race analysis noted that California Chrome stayed on the outside throughout the race , and actually ran 44 feet farther than the winner . Sherman spoke in positive terms of the horse 's finish , stating " My horse ran his eyeballs out . He was right there , right down to the money . I thought it was a great effort . He came back strong . " Espinoza was less enthusiastic : " On the backstretch I thought I had a chance to win ... The last sixteenth [ California Chrome ] was digging as hard as he could , but getting just a little tired . I wish he had one more race . It was a little too much for him today . " Coburn visited the colt the following day and stated , " He was full of himself . I think he thought he won . And if the race had been just a little bit longer , I believe he would have . " 
 Later in the month California Chrome shipped to Del Mar , and following workouts on the turf course Sherman entered him in the Hollywood Derby on November 29 . It was his first start on a grass race track . Sherman believed that California Chrome would do well running on grass , and it also would open up a variety of potential races to enter in 2015 . He was the morning line favorite , with his toughest competitor viewed as Lexie Lou , a filly who defeated colts to win Canada 's equivalent of the Kentucky Derby , the Queen 's Plate . California Chrome won handily by two lengths and the Canadian filly was second . With the win , California Chrome earned four Grade I wins for the year , and was the only horse in the United States to have Grade I wins in 2014 on both dirt and turf tracks . Espinoza summed up the race by saying , " he 's back . " 
 = = = 2015 : Four @-@ year @-@ old season = = = 
 California Chrome had a tumultuous four @-@ year @-@ old season . Martin originally intended for California Chrome to be retired to stud at the end of the year . The horse began 2015 at Santa Anita in the San Antonio Stakes on February 7 , a return matchup with Shared Belief , whose traffic problems in the Classic prevented a true match against California Chrome . Art Sherman and Shared Belief 's trainer , Jerry <unk> , were longtime friends and rivals from the Northern California racing circuit and each anticipated the rivalry between their two horses . Said Sherman , " I just want both of us to be at the head of the stretch with no excuses and then it 's who gets to the wire first . " Shared Belief went off as the favorite and although California Chrome took the lead by the 3 ⁄ 4 pole , Shared Belief edged him in the final sixteenth and won , with California Chrome second by a length and a half . California Chrome next shipped to Meydan Racecourse for the Dubai World Cup on March 28 , where he needed to run at night , under artificial lighting , and without Lasix . He went off as the favorite , but finished second to the Irish @-@ bred longshot Prince Bishop , owned by Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum of Godolphin Racing . Sherman noted that his horse ran wide on the turns , but said , " He tried every inch of the way . There 's nothing wrong with finishing second in this type of a race . " 
 After the Dubai World Cup , California Chrome was shipped to Rae Guest 's Newmarket stables in England to prepare for Royal Ascot week in June . The decision to go to England was made by Perry Martin , against the wishes of both Coburn and Sherman . Martin explained , " I was trying to think in terms of what 's best for the horse . It was my decision to send him to Newmarket . It 's a beautiful place , with trees and pastures for gallops ... It 's good for his mind . I know Art didn 't take the decision well . But he 'll be okay . " The horse 's exercise rider in England , Robbie Mills , who was acquainted with the Shermans and advised them to stable the horse with Guest , stated that California Chrome was making a good transition from the flat dirt tracks of the United States to the undulating turf gallops of England . The horse was pointed to the Prince of Wales 's Stakes at Royal Ascot , with European jockey William Buick , who rode Prince Bishop in Dubai , tapped to ride . The day before the race , the horse was scratched because of a bruised hoof that was draining pus . Guest stated , " he 's been X @-@ rayed and there 's no damage . " Martin wanted to run him in Chicago 's Arlington Million in August , and the requirements of quarantine upon his return to the United States combined with the setback to his training foreclosed any other UK start . Upon California Chrome 's return to the US in early July , a veterinary radiograph revealed he had bruising on his cannon bones that would require at least three months to heal , effectively ending his four @-@ year @-@ old season . The veterinarians at Rood and Riddle Veterinary Hospital in Kentucky explained , " California Chrome 's x @-@ rays showed all of his joints to be remarkably clean . He has the early signs of bruising to the bottom of the cannon bones ... The return rate for horses with this problem is very high ... we found that recovery rate was 95 % after giving time in the paddock to heal . " 
 On July 15 , the racing press reported that Steve Coburn sold his 30 % interest in the horse to Taylor Made Farm of Nicholasville , Kentucky , but that the abrupt end to the 2015 season opened the door to racing the horse for an additional year . Duncan Taylor of Taylor Made Farms said , " You won 't find many horses of his quality that made 18 starts in 23 months . He 's just now getting his first break from training . " On July 19 , Art Sherman announced that after California Chrome had paddock rest at Taylor Made Farm , the horse would ship back to Sherman 's and prepare to race in 2016 . On October 13 , California Chrome returned to Sherman 's barn . He finished the year being named Champion California @-@ bred Older Male . 
 = = = 2016 : Five @-@ year @-@ old season = = = 
 Martin 's plans for the horse in 2016 included a return to the Dubai World Cup , and ultimately another try at the Breeders ' Cup Classic . Sherman 's barn had a new exercise rider for the horse , <unk> Gladney , a former bull rider and ex @-@ jockey who grew up in Watts , who also runs a pony ride concession at Santa Anita . Beginning at the San Pasqual Stakes , the purple and green DAP silks were replaced with a new silver @-@ gray design representing the California Chrome , LLC partnership that now owned the horse . Martin stated that his goal for the horse was to become the leading money @-@ winning horse of all time . 
 California Chrome 's 2016 season began with the San Pasqual Stakes on January 9 . He faced a seven @-@ horse field that included a former rival from the Derby trail , <unk> , and older foes Imperative and Hard Aces . Stalking the front runner until the final turn , he took the lead in the homestretch and won by 1 1 ⁄ 2 lengths . Sherman said of his modest margin of victory , " He could 've opened up turning for home , but Victor put the full nelson on him . It was just what we needed . " Espinoza , back on California Chrome after winning the Triple Crown with American Pharoah , said , " He 's one of the best horses I 've ever been on . I am so proud of him . American Pharoah and California Chrome are too hard to compare , so I won 't . " The win boosted his lifetime earnings to $ 6 @,@ 442 @,@ 650 , breaking the previous record held by Tiznow as the highest @-@ earning California @-@ bred racehorse in history . He shipped to Dubai shortly after the San Pasqual to acclimate to the area , the same training tactics used by the trainers of Curlin . He was entered into a 2 @,@ 000 metres ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) handicap race on February 25 , where he drew the number one post position and was assigned a career @-@ high weight of 60 kilograms ( 130 lb ) , an impost 7 @.@ 5 kilograms ( 17 lb ) more than any other horse in the eight @-@ horse field . Alan Sherman , who accompanied the horse to Dubai and conditioned him there , was unconcerned , noting that Gladney weighed 150 pounds ( 68 kg ) . He handily won by two lengths . 
 Entering the 2016 Dubai World Cup , California Chrome had the number 11 post position in an international field of 12 . He faced both old American rivals in <unk> and Candy Boy , as well as three younger horses who had challenged American Pharoah the previous year , Keen Ice , Frosted and Mubtaahij . The horse stayed wide and had a clear trip the entire race , took the lead 300 metres ( 980 ft ) out and won by 3 3 ⁄ 4 lengths . The race took a dramatic turn when Espinoza ’ s saddle began to slip backwards in the homestretch , and after the race he said , “ I just kept looking forward and thinking ' where 's the wire ? It was not coming fast enough . " The purse money for the victory made him the all @-@ time leading North American horse in earnings won . Martin commented that the horse had to pass three horses from Japan to become the all @-@ time world ’ s money leader , but declared , " I believe we 'll do that before the end of the year . " 
 Upon his return to the United States , California Chrome was turned out for a month at Taylor Made Farm , then resumed training with Sherman . On July 23 , the horse was entered in the San Diego Handicap where he faced Dortmund , who had finished third in the 2015 Kentucky Derby to American Pharoah . California Chrome tracked behind Dortmund until the far turn , then moved to the front . Dortmund fought back and the two dueled down the stretch , with California Chrome prevailing by half a length . Noting that his horse had carried five pounds more than Dortmund , Espinoza said , " I have a lot of respect for Dortmund and he made me run hard ... When we came down the stretch , I was concerned . This horse was carrying a lot of weight . That was the challenge , but he was a runner all the way today . " 
 = = Awards and honors = = 
 California Chrome won many honors in 2014 . A concurrent resolution was introduced in the California State Assembly recognizing the " outstanding performance of California Chrome " and all of his connections including not only his owners and trainers , but also Willie Delgado and groom Raul Rodriguez . The resolution passed both chambers of the legislature unanimously on August 14 . It was the first time that the California Legislature had honored a racehorse . The city of Fresno proclaimed October 11 , 2014 , as " California Chrome Day " . In March 2015 , the Los Angeles Sports Council ranked California Chrome 's Kentucky Derby and Preakness wins third at the LA Sports Awards ' Sports Moment of 2014 , behind only the Los Angeles Kings Stanley Cup win and Clayton Kershaw 's Cy Young and National League MVP Awards . 
 California Chrome won the Secretariat Vox Populi Award given each year to recognize " the horse whose popularity and racing excellence best resounded with the American public and gained recognition for Thoroughbred racing . " His Kentucky Derby win was named the NTRA " Moment of the Year " . At the Eclipse Awards , he was named American Horse of the Year and American Champion Three @-@ Year @-@ Old Male Horse . He was the second California @-@ bred to win Horse of the Year , the first since Tiznow , the first three @-@ year @-@ old to be Horse of the Year since Rachel Alexandra , and the first Kentucky Derby winner since Charismatic . The California Thoroughbred Breeders ' Association gave California Chrome and his connections multiple honors , naming him the 2014 California @-@ bred Horse of the Year , Champion Cal @-@ bred Three @-@ Year @-@ Old and Turf Champion . Lucky Pulpit was named Champion Sire , Love the Chase was Champion Broodmare , Martin and Coburn were named Champion Breeders , and Sherman was named Trainer of the year . 
 2016 saw the inauguration of the California Chrome Stakes , a 1 1 ⁄ 16 mile race with an introductory purse of $ 150 @,@ 000 for three @-@ year @-@ olds at Los Alamitos . The track created the race in recognition of the horse being stabled there as a home base since the beginning of 2014 .

 An enthusiastic fan base supporting California Chrome became visible at the Santa Anita Derby , when someone invited the horse 's supporters to join the owners in the winner 's circle and over 100 people crammed into the area , including one woman dressed entirely in metallic foil . Coburn told CNN of a supporter who had a jackass tattooed on his shoulder . An unofficial Twitter account for the horse , @ <unk> , was started by a 37 @-@ year @-@ old fan from Florida , Shawn <unk> , had over 12 @,@ 000 followers by Belmont week . The New York Times noted the enthusiasm of the fans , who used the hashtag # Chromies on Twitter . <unk> believes the word " Chromies " first appeared on @ <unk> eight nights before the Kentucky Derby . The humble origins of the horse and the people around him played a role in his popularity , as did the horse 's people @-@ focused attitude . Supporters appeared to be further motivated by the continuing doubts raised by industry experts about California Chrome 's ability . 
 The horse had nationwide appeal , but California Chrome 's core fan base was centered in the Central Valley of California ; the Sacramento television market ranked sixth in the nation for television viewership on Preakness day , and third in the nation on Belmont day . Prior to the Belmont , singer – songwriter team Templeton Thompson and Sam Gay wrote and recorded a song titled " Bring it on Home , Chrome " and a rap video featuring an elementary school children was released on YouTube . Even after his Belmont loss , Harris Farms fielded many calls daily from fans wanting to visit the horse while he had a break from racing in June and July 2014 . In contrast to his admirers , California Chrome 's image was somewhat diminished by the criticism that followed Coburn 's post @-@ Belmont comments . Additional negative press occurred when Martin turned down an offer to bring California Chrome to parade in the paddock at Del Mar on the day of the Pacific Classic . NPR 's Frank Deford had little patience with the horse 's story exemplifying the American dream ; <unk> felt that the horse 's victories would have little impact on the popularity of horse racing , which he viewed as " a sport that is struggling against time and culture " due to the prevalence of other types of gambling and the reduced impact of horses in the daily lives of most people . 
 Overall , the press the horse received was viewed as giving a needed boost to the sport . Jockey and sports analyst Gary Stevens noted prior to the Belmont , " I haven 't heard Thoroughbred horse racing mentioned on CNN for a long time , and it was right at the top of the hour ... He 's brought us mainstream again for the first time in a lot of years . " Post @-@ Belmont press analysis contended that California Chrome was the most popular Thoroughbred in America since Zenyatta . In December , when the horse was selected as the winner of the Secretariat Vox Populi Award , Coburn said , " We have always said Chrome is the ' People 's Horse ' and we are thrilled that the public feels the same way we do about him . " In announcing the Moment of the Year , Keith <unk> of NTRA stated , " the fans reminded us that nothing trumps an awesome performance by a legendary horse . " 
 = = = Marketing = = = 
 Prior to the 2014 Belmont Stakes , California Chrome 's owners filed a patent application to trademark his name for use on athletic apparel , and hired two talent agencies to help with marketing and sponsorships . Following the " <unk> " story , fans began to appear wearing human nasal strips or purple band @-@ aids across their noses . Working with the intellectual property attorney who had brokered deals for Smarty Jones , California Chrome 's owners gained an endorsement deal with GlaxoSmithKline , manufacturer of the human Breathe Right nasal strips . On Belmont day , GlaxoSmithKline gave away 50 @,@ 000 of the strips at Belmont Park . Santa Anita , which simulcast the race , ran its own promotion , giving fans at that track purple nasal strips with the word " Chrome " on the front . On June 2 , the Skechers shoe company announced a sponsorship deal where the company 's logo appeared on assorted items worn by the horse and his handlers , the company used California Chrome 's image in its marketing , and ran a half page ad featuring the horse in the Wall Street Journal at the end of June 2014 .

 * Odds not available 
 = = Pedigree = = 
 California Chrome has been described as a throwback to horses with toughness and soundness . His sire , Lucky Pulpit , and his dam , Love the Chase , each had relatively undistinguished racing careers , but their ancestors were successful on the track , and some were well known for stamina over distance . Lucky Pulpit was sired by Pulpit , who is credited with 63 stakes winners and particularly known for his son <unk> . 1992 Belmont Stakes and Breeders ' Cup Classic winner A. P. Indy is the sire of Pulpit , and in 2015 , California Chrome became the all @-@ time leading earner from the A. P. Indy sire line . The sire line of these stallions traces to Bold Ruler , considered one of the greatest North American sires of the 20th century , and ultimately to the Darley Arabian through Eclipse . A. P. Indy was by 1977 Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew , and is a grandson of Secretariat on his dam 's side , bringing a second cross to Bold Ruler into the pedigree . Pulpit is a grandson of Mr. Prospector on his dam 's side , a line believed to cross well with Seattle Slew 's breeding . Pulpit 's maternal granddam , <unk> , carries lines to Bold Ruler and to 1964 Kentucky Derby winner Northern Dancer . Lucky Pulpit 's dam , Lucky Soph , is a half @-@ sister to the dam of Unbridled 's Song and also a granddaughter of Caro , who sired 1988 Kentucky Derby winner Winning Colors . Princequillo , who was noted for his stamina , appears several times in Lucky Pulpit 's pedigree . 
 Love the Chase comes from old and respected stock , and California Chrome was the fifth Kentucky Derby winner produced from this mare line . Her sire , Not for Love , was by Mr. Prospector and out of a daughter of Northern Dancer . Northern Dancer appears again on the distaff side of Love the Chase 's pedigree . Her granddam , Chase the Dream , was sired by the 1968 Epsom Derby winner Sir Ivor . <unk> Noble , winner of the 1968 Prix de l 'Arc de Triomphe , is one of Chase the Dream 's grandsires . She traces to Princequillo and to the UK @-@ bred Ribot , viewed by some as the greatest racehorse of his generation . Love the Chase has two crosses to the mare Numbered Account , who produced several Grade I stakes winners and was the American Champion Two @-@ Year @-@ Old Filly in 1971 . Numbered Account was a daughter of Buckpasser , who earned five Eclipse Awards between 1965 and 1967 , and was inducted to the Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 1970 . The Buckpasser line has been considered another good bloodline to crossbreed with descendants of Seattle Slew . Numbered Account was also a granddaughter of Swaps , and traces to La <unk> and War Admiral on both sides of her pedigree . Love the Chase 's tail @-@ female line is one of the oldest in North America . Through a mare named Selima , foaled in 1745 , who was by the Godolphin Arabian and imported to the Province of Maryland between 1750 and 1752 . The line probably traces to Thoroughbred family 21 , which began with the <unk> Barb Mare , who was imported from Barbary to England in utero about 1700 . 
 California Chrome has relatively little inbreeding ; he is 4 × 3 to Mr Prospector , meaning that this ancestor appears once in the third and once in the fourth generations of his pedigree . He is also 4 × 4 to Numbered Account and 4 × 5 to Northern Dancer .

 Dragon Quest III : The Seeds of Salvation , known in Japan as Dragon Quest III : Soshite Densetsu e ... ( <unk> <unk> … , Doragon Kuesuto Surī - Soshite Densetsu e ... , Dragon Quest III : And thus into Legend ... ) and previously released as Dragon Warrior III in North America , is a role @-@ playing video game developed by Chunsoft and published by Enix ( now Square Enix ) . It is the third installment in the Dragon Quest series ( known as Dragon Warrior in North America at the time of its original release ) and the first released for the Family Computer ( Famicom ) in Japan and later for the Nintendo Entertainment System ( NES ) in North America . The game saw an enhanced remake for the Super Famicom ( the Japanese version of the Super NES ) in 1996 and the Game Boy Color in 2001 , and a port to mobile phones and the Wii in 2009 and 2011 . A version of the game for Android and iOS was released in Japan on September 25 , 2014 , and worldwide on December 4 , 2014 as Dragon Quest III : The Seeds of Salvation . It was the first time the game was given an official English subtitle . 
 The first three Dragon Quest games are part of the same story , and Dragon Warrior III is the first game chronologically , as well as the third game that features the hero Erdrick ( Loto in the Japanese releases and recent localizations ) . The story follows " the Hero " who is tasked with saving the world from the <unk> Baramos . Gathering a group of companions into a party , the Hero must travel the world , stopping at various towns and locations , and find his way to the Demon Lord Baramos 's lair . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Dragon Quest III is noted for greatly expanding upon the gameplay of the original Dragon Quest and Dragon Quest II . The game uses basic role @-@ playing video game conventions such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items . Battle is turn @-@ based like the other games in the series , though the remakes incorporate various interface changes from later titles . These include simpler door opening , a bag to store items instead of keeping them at a bank , quick item sorting with " Tidy Item " and " Tidy Bag " command , and a " Full HP " command to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells . And while earlier Dragon Quest games were non @-@ linear in structure , Dragon Quest III featured an even more open @-@ world experience . It also allowed the player to freely swap characters in and out of their party , and introduced the day / night cycle in which certain items , characters , and quests are only accessible at specific times of day . 
 = = = Classes = = = 
 Dragon Quest III features a class system , in which each character has a certain class . At the start of the game , the player begins as a single male or female hero , but is able to recruit members at the local tavern . While the Hero always keeps the Hero class , the other characters can choose to be any of the following of either gender : Soldier ( Warrior in the GBC version ) , Fighter , Pilgrim ( Cleric ) , Wizard ( Mage ) , Merchant ( Dealer ) , Goof @-@ Off ( Jester ) , Sage , and Thief which was available only in the later versions . The choice of class greatly affects the character 's stats and spells he or she can learn . Furthermore , upon reaching experience Level 20 , a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of <unk> , found halfway through the game . A character who changes classes has their stats halved and restarts at experience Level 1 , retaining their spells and , in the remakes , their personality . This allows a player to create a character that knows Wizard spells , but has the defense of a Soldier . Unlike most Dragon Quest parties , aside from the Hero , the party is not made up of characters involved in the story . Although only four characters can be in the party at a time , extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern , allowing room for new recruits . Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles in order to win more gold . 
 In the remakes , after selecting a character , the player can change the character 's starting abilities with five magical seeds , given at the tavern . Also , each character has a personality trait which affects the growth rate of their abilities . The Hero 's personality is determined by the player 's choices and actions during a dream sequence at the start of the game , while other characters ' personalities are determined by their status at the end of the character generation process . Most personalities are available to both male and female characters , while a few are exclusive to male or female characters . A character 's personality can be temporarily changed by equipping certain accessories , or permanently changed by using certain consumable books .

 The game starts in the castle town of Aliahan . Like the rest of the Dragon Quest worlds , this castle is set in a medieval time period , complete with knights and magicians . The party explores several caves , ruins , and castles during the adventure . The geography of Dragon Quest III largely corresponds to the actual geography of Earth , and many towns correspond to their real @-@ world cultures , including " <unk> " for Rome , " <unk> " for Portugal , " <unk> " near present @-@ day Iraq ( derived from " as @-@ <unk> <unk> " ) , " <unk> " for Japan and even a " New Town " in eastern North America that experiences a revolution against an overbearing ruler . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 Dragon Quest III is set many years before the original Dragon Warrior in a world separate from the first two games . A wicked fiend named Baramos threatens to destroy the world . The story revolves around the Hero , son or daughter ( the player can choose to be either male or female , with few gameplay changes ) of the legendary warrior Ortega . On his or her sixteenth birthday , the Hero ( from here on referred to as " he " for the sake of convenience ) is summoned to the castle and is given by the King of Aliahan the challenge to rid the world of the evil <unk> Baramos , which Ortega attempted in the past but seemingly perished in a volcano . The Hero then is able to recruit up to three traveling companions to help fight Baramos . 
 The Hero leaves his home country of Aliahan to travel the world and complete his father 's quest to defeat Baramos . A major portion of the adventure is the quest to acquire the last two of the three keys needed to open doors throughout the game . After saving two people of the town of <unk> from the rogue <unk> and stealing back the King of <unk> 's crown , the Hero receives Black Pepper , which he then trades for a sailing ship at <unk> . With the ship , the Hero acquires the Final Key and the six mystical orbs which are used to revive the legendary bird <unk> . <unk> allows the Hero and his party to travel to Baramos ' castle , which is surrounded by mountains . 
 After defeating Baramos in a ferocious battle and returning to Aliahan , the Hero 's celebration is cut off as Zoma , Baramos 's master and the game 's true villain , reveals his existence . He attacks and opens a pit to the Dark World , which the Hero jumps into . The Dark World is in fact Alefgard ( of the previous installments of the series ) , where the Hero must acquire several of the artifacts that were collected in the original Dragon Quest , including the Sun Stone and the Rain Staff . Rubiss , a legendary sage , has been turned to stone and is rescued by the Hero , and the Hero receives the Sacred Amulet in return . These items , as in the original game , create the Rainbow Bridge which leads the Hero to Zoma 's castle for the final confrontation . Along the way , the Hero briefly reunites with Ortega as he is slain by Zoma 's monsters , then continues on to defeat the revived Baramos , now turned into the powerful Baramos <unk> and later into the skeletal Baramos <unk> . With the Ball of Light given by the Dragon Queen , the Hero defeats Zoma and frees Alefgard , but Zoma boasts that evil will eventually return to the land and the Hero will not live long enough to stop it . For his or her bravery , the Hero receives the title of Loto ( Erdrick ) . The Hero later vanishes from Alefgard , leaving his sword and armor to be passed down throughout the ages so that his descendants can continue to protect the world from evil .

 As with the other main games in the Dragon Quest series , Dragon Quest III 's scenario was designed by Yuji Horii , whereas the artwork was done by Akira Toriyama , of Dragon Ball fame . Koichi Sugiyama composed all the music for Dragon Quest III . Chunsoft president Koichi Nakamura , co @-@ creator of Dragon Quest , stated he contributed about " 10 % " of the games programming . The game was released a year after the original , a longer period of development than its predecessor , and reflected the ever lengthening game development process of the series . Yuji Horii , in a 1989 interview , said that developers had perfected the series ' game structure in Dragon Quest III , and this was reflected by the transition from one character 's quest to a party of heroes . The password system used on the first two Dragon Quest titles was dropped in favor of a save slot due in part to Horii 's dislike of the long codes that players needed to memorize or record . Horii had a policy of removing any features from his games that had been used elsewhere , which turned out to be unworkable during Dragon Quest IIIs development when the games world map concept was used first by another game maker in Mirai Shinwa <unk> , but Horii 's team was too far into development to change anything . Horii also preferred a silent protagonist to make the player feel like they have become the main character , but at one point in the story , Horii was forced to make the hero shout , " Leave him to us ! Run ! Quick ! " 
 = = = Remakes = = = 
 The Super Famicom version , released in late 1996 , during the last days of the Super NES in North America , was never brought to North America , due to Enix America Corporation 's closure in 1995 . By the time Enix of America returned , the SNES had been discontinued in North America . In 2009 , it was unofficially translated into English . However , the next remake , for the Game Boy Color , was released in both Japan and the US . 
 The Game Boy Color version is based on the Super Famicom version . For the North American release of the Dragon Quest III Game Boy Color remake , Enix decided to give the packaging an anime feel , due to fan demand on Enix 's message boards . Both remake versions of Dragon Quest III offer many new features and changes . The game received a new translation , incorporating many adult elements that were cut from its original American release , and becoming the first Game Boy Color RPG with a " Teen " rating . It was also the largest Game Boy Color game released in North America , with 32 Mb ROM and <unk> of save @-@ state SRAM on one cartridge . A new class , the Thief , was added to the roster in each of the remakes . Many of the names of the classes were changed in the English localization of the Game Boy Color version , such as Soldier to Warrior . Also , in the new versions was the ability to change into the Jester class at <unk> , which was not allowed in the original . New mini @-@ games were added to the remakes , including Pachisi ( called <unk> in Japan / Treasures and <unk> as of the Dragon Quest V Remake ) , which is a giant board game style adventure from which the player can win items . This game is based on Horii 's series Itadaki Street . The Mini Medal system , which lets players collect hidden medals to gain new items , seen in later Dragon Quest games ( it originated in Dragon Quest IV ) , was added . Another medal system , Monster Medals , lets players collect medals from fallen enemies , was added in Game Boy Color remake , and two players could trade Monster Medals via a Game Link Cable . Two bonus dungeons become available after the main quest is over . The remakes feature updated graphics . An overhauled introduction for the game was made , similar to the one in the original Dragon Quest III , which included Ortega 's battle with the Dragon Queen . Monster and attack animation in battles were added , a feature first introduced in Dragon Quest VI . A personality system was added to the remakes of Dragon Quest III . A pre @-@ game sequence in which the player answers moral dilemmas similar to that in Ultima IV determines the Hero 's personality . The personality of the other members of the party is determined by the stat @-@ raising seeds that the player gives them during the character generation process . Personalities determine which stats increase when a character levels up . The personalities may be changed by use of special items and books . 
 It was announced in May 2011 that Square Enix will be releasing Dragon Quest III in Japan , as both the Famicom and Super Famicom ports as part of the September released of Dragon Quest 25th Anniversary Commemoration Famicom & Super Famicom Dragon Quest I & II & III for the Wii . A quick save feature was added to this version of the game , allowing for pauses at any time , but the save file is deleted upon resuming .

 A survey conducted by the magazine Famitsu in early 2006 among its readers placed Dragon Quest III as the third most favorite game of all time , being preceded by only Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy VII , It is often mistakenly thought that in 1988 the game 's success caused the Japanese government to outlaw further releases of Dragon Quest games on school days . In truth , Enix themselves decided to hold off the release of future Dragon Quest games until weekends . The North American release of Dragon Quest III did not meet nearly as much success . Considered an improvement over the first two games , Dragon Quest III " kept the same ugly graphical style and clumsy interface " , explained Kurt Kalata of Gamasutra . The North American release 's poor sales are partly due to the fact that the game was released after the release of 16 @-@ bit gaming systems , making it seem archaic to gamers . Critics found the new day / night system and the addition of an in @-@ game bank praiseworthy . Its reputation has risen in America since its release , primarily due to its gameplay innovations , leading Nintendo Power to list it as number 176 on their Top 200 Games list . IGN later listed it as the 96th best Nintendo Entertainment System game . GamesRadar ranked it the 17th best NES game ever made . The staff chose it over the other Dragon Warrior titles due to its job system which they felt had depth and was influential to video games . 
 The Game Boy Color remake received very good reviews from critics . GameSpot gave the Game Boy Color version a " good " 7 @.@ 6 / 10 , saying that " <unk> is a worthy port of its old NES ancestor , but its firm grounding in the RPG old @-@ school means that only the hard @-@ core need apply . " Nintendo Power gave the remake a 4 / 5 , while IGN gave the game a perfect 10 / 10 .

 The 70th Boat Race took place on 13 March 1913 . Held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the previous year 's race . The two crews contained a total of five medallists from the 1912 Summer Olympics . Umpired by former Cambridge rower Frederick I. Pitman , Oxford won this year 's race by three @-@ quarters of a length in a time of 20 minutes 53 seconds . The victory took the overall record in the event to 39 – 30 in their favour .

 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities ; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and , as of 2014 , broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1912 race by six lengths , and led overall with 38 victories to Cambridge 's 30 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . 
 Oxford 's coaches were H. R. Barker ( who rowed for the Dark Blues in the 1908 and 1909 races ) , G. C. Bourne who had rowed for the university in the 1882 and 1883 races , Harcourt Gilbey Gold ( Dark Blue president for the 1900 race and four @-@ time Blue ) , and Alister Kirby ( who rowed for Cambridge four times between 1906 and 1909 ) . Cambridge were coached by John Houghton Gibbon who rowed for the Light Blues in the 1899 and 1900 races . For the tenth year the umpire was old Etonian Frederick I. Pitman who rowed for Cambridge in the 1884 , 1885 and 1886 races . 
 To avoid Holy Week , the race was scheduled earlier than normal , on 13 March 1913 . Two old Etonians , G. E. Tower and C. E. V. Buxton joined the Cambridge crew , along with W. M. Askwith . The Light Blues ' practice was disrupted , first losing Askwith suffering from a boil , and then , late in the build @-@ up the race , losing both E. L. Showell Rogers and L. A. Pattinson to injury and " indigestion " respectively nine days before the race . Askwith was fit enough to return and according to author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater , " the crew were well together when they came to the post " . Of the Oxford crew , Drinkwater noted that " the crew went easily and comfortably from the first day " yet " lacked essential balance " .

 The Oxford crew weighed an average of 12 st 6 @.@ 375 lb ( 78 @.@ 9 kg ) , 1 @.@ 875 pounds ( 0 @.@ 9 kg ) per rower more than their opponents .

The Oxford crew saw five participants return , including Leslie Wormald and cox Henry Wells who were both taking part in their third race . Edgar Burgess , Swann , Wormald and Ewart Horsfall had all won gold medals in the men 's eight at the 1912 Summer Olympics , rowing for Leander Club . They defeated New College in the final for whom Dark Blue Arthur Wiggins rowed .

 Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford . Umpire Pitman started the race at 4 : 38 p.m. in conditions described by former author and former Oxford rower George Drinkwater as " almost perfect " but with a " modest " tide . Despite Oxford out @-@ rating their opponents from the start , Cambridge took an early lead and were half a length ahead after the first minute . Although the bend in the river was against them , the Light Blues continued to slowly gain and were just clear by the Mile Post . A spurt from Oxford closed the gap and by Harrods Furniture Depository the lead was down to half a length . Taking advantage of the bend in the river , the Light Blues pulled away again and were nearly clear by the time the crews passed below Hammersmith Bridge . They extended the lead to be a quarter @-@ length clear by The Doves pub , and then a half @-@ length clear by Craven Steps . 
 Rowing into increasing wind , Cambridge began to tire and Oxford closed the gap . The Cambridge stroke G. E. Tower spurted again just before Barnes Bridge and led by a length and a quarter at the bridge . The crews began to steer closer to one another , eventually causing each cox to give way to avoid the foul . By the time the boats passed Mortlake Brewery they were level , and despite a final push from Cambridge , Oxford drove on , passing the finishing post rating 37 strokes per minute . They won by three @-@ quarters of a length in a time of 20 minutes 53 seconds . It was the narrowest winning margin since the 1896 race , and Oxford 's fifth consecutive victory , taking the overall record in the event to 39 – 30 in their favour . 
 = Dragon Ball = 
 Dragon Ball ( Japanese : ドラゴンボール , Hepburn : Doragon Bōru ) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama . It was originally serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1984 to 1995 , with the 519 individual chapters published into 42 tankōbon volumes by Shueisha . Dragon Ball was initially inspired by the classical Chinese novel Journey to the West . The series follows the adventures of the protagonist , Goku , from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts and explores the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls , which summon a wish @-@ granting dragon when gathered . Along his journey , Goku makes several friends and battles a wide variety of villains , many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls . 
 The 42 tankōbon have been adapted into two anime series produced by Toei Animation : Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z , which together were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996 . Additionally , the studio has developed nineteen animated feature films and three television specials , as well as a third anime series titled Dragon Ball GT . From 2009 to 2015 , a revised , faster @-@ paced version of Dragon Ball Z aired in Japan under the title Dragon Ball Kai , in which most of the original version 's footage not featured in the manga is removed . A fifth anime series titled Dragon Ball Super began airing in Japan on July 5 , 2015 . Several companies have developed various types of merchandising based on the series leading to a large media franchise that includes films , both animated and live @-@ action , collectible trading card games , numerous action figures , along with several collections of soundtracks and a large number of video games . 
 The manga series was licensed for an English @-@ language release in North America by Viz Media , in the United Kingdom by Gollancz Manga , and Australia and New Zealand by Madman Entertainment . The entire anime series was licensed by Funimation for an English @-@ language release in the United States , although the series has not always been dubbed by the same studio . There have been many films of the franchise including the first live @-@ action film adaptation being produced in 1989 in Taiwan . In 2002 , 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to produce an American @-@ made live @-@ action film titled Dragonball Evolution that was received negatively by critics and fans ; the movie was released on April 10 , 2009 in the United States . 
 Since its release , Dragon Ball has become one of the most successful manga and anime series of all time . The manga 's 42 volumes have sold over 156 million copies in Japan and more than 230 million copies worldwide , making it the third best @-@ selling manga series in history . Reviewers have praised the art , characterization , and humor of the story . It is widely regarded as one of the greatest manga series ever made , with many manga artists such as Eiichiro Oda ( One Piece ) , Masashi Kishimoto ( Naruto ) , Tite Kubo ( Bleach ) , Hiro <unk> ( Rave Master , Fairy Tail ) and Kentaro Yabuki ( Black Cat ) citing Dragon Ball as a source of inspiration for their own now popular works . The anime , particularly Dragon Ball Z , is also highly popular in various countries and was arguably one of the most influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 The series begins with a monkey @-@ tailed boy named Goku befriending a teenage girl named Bulma , whom he accompanies to find the seven Dragon Balls ( ドラゴンボール , Doragon Bōru ) , which summon the dragon Shenlong to grant the user one wish . The journey leads them to the desert bandit Yamcha , who later becomes an ally ; Chi @-@ Chi , whom Goku unknowingly agrees to marry ; and <unk> , an impish man who seeks the Dragon Balls to fulfill his desire to rule the world . Goku then undergoes rigorous training regimes under the martial arts master Kame @-@ Sen 'nin in order to fight in the Tenkaichi Budōkai ( <unk> , " Strongest Under the Heavens Martial Arts Tournament " ) . A monk named Kuririn becomes his training partner and rival , but they soon become best friends . After the tournament , Goku searches for the Dragon Ball his grandfather left him and almost single @-@ handedly defeats the Red Ribbon Army and their hired assassin Taopaipai . Thereafter Goku reunites with his friends to defeat the fortuneteller Baba <unk> 's fighters and have her locate the last Dragon Ball to revive a friend killed by Taopaipai . 
 At the Tenkaichi Budōkai three years later Goku and his allies oppose Kame @-@ Sen 'nin 's rival and Taopaipai 's brother , Tsuru @-@ Sen 'nin , and his students <unk> and Chaozu . Kuririn is killed after the tournament and Goku tracks down and is defeated by his killer , Piccolo Daimao . The samurai <unk> takes Goku to the hermit Karin , where he receives healing and a power boost . Meanwhile , Piccolo fights Kame @-@ Sen 'nin and Chaozu , leading to both their deaths , and uses the Dragon Balls to regain his youth before destroying Shenlong . Goku then kills Piccolo Daimao , who , just before dying , spawns his son / reincarnation Piccolo . Karin then directs Goku to Kami @-@ sama , the original creator of the Dragon Balls , to restore Shenlong and revive his slain friends . Goku trains under Kami for the next three years , once again reuniting with his friends at the Tenkaichi Budōkai , where he narrowly wins against Piccolo before leaving with Chi @-@ Chi to keep his promise to marry her . 
 Five years later , Goku is a young adult and father to his son Gohan , when <unk> arrives on Earth , identifies Goku as his younger brother ' <unk> ' and reveals to him that they are members of a nearly extinct extraterrestrial race called the Saiyans ( <unk> , <unk> @-@ jin ) , who sent Goku to conquer Earth for them , until he suffered a severe head injury and lost all memory of his mission . Goku refuses to continue the mission , sides with Piccolo , and sacrifices his life to defeat <unk> . In the afterlife Goku trains under the North <unk> until he is revived by the Dragon Balls to save the Earth from the invading <unk> and Vegeta . In the battle Yamcha , Chaozu , <unk> , and Piccolo are killed , and the Dragon Balls cease to exist . Kuririn and the galactic tyrant Freeza learn of another set of Dragon Balls on planet <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> @-@ sei ) , whereupon Bulma , Gohan , and Kuririn search for them to revive their friends and subsequently the Earth 's Dragon Balls , leading to several battles with Freeza 's minions and Vegeta , the latter standing alongside the heroes to fight the <unk> Force , a team of mercenaries . The long battle with Freeza himself comes to a close when Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan ( <unk> , Sūpā <unk> @-@ jin ) of legends and defeats him . 
 A group of Androids ( <unk> , <unk> , " Artificial Humans " ) created by a member of the former Red Ribbon Army , Doctor Gero , appear three years later , seeking revenge against Goku . During this time , an evil life form called Cell also emerges and , after absorbing two of the Androids to achieve his " perfect form , " holds his own fighting tournament to challenge the protagonists . After Goku sacrifices his own life to no avail , Gohan avenges his father by defeating Cell . Seven years later , Goku , briefly revived for one day , and his allies are drawn into a fight against Majin Boo .

 Akira Toriyama loosely modeled Dragon Ball on the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West ; but also redeveloped it from his 1983 one @-@ shot manga Dragon Boy . He has said that the fighting was influenced from movies by famous martial arts actor Jackie Chan , as he wanted to create a story with the basic theme of Journey to the West , but with " a little kung fu . " Since it was serialized in a shōnen magazine , he added the idea of the Dragon Balls to give it a game @-@ like activity of gathering something , without thinking of what the characters would wish for . With Goku being Sun Wukong , Bulma as Xuanzang , Oolong as Zhu <unk> and Yamcha being Sha Wujing , he originally thought it would last about a year or end once the Dragon Balls were collected . Toriyama stated that although the stories are purposefully easy to understand , he specifically aimed Dragon Ball at readers older than those of his previous serial Dr. Slump . He also wanted to break from the Western influences common in Dr. Slump , deliberately going for Chinese scenery , referencing Chinese buildings and photographs of China his wife had bought . The island where the Tenkaichi Budōkai is held is modeled after Bali , which he , his wife and assistant visited in mid @-@ 1985 , and for the area around <unk> 's spaceship he consulted photos of Africa . 
 It was when the Tenkaichi Budōkai martial arts tournament began that Dragon Ball truly became popular , having recalled the races and tournaments in Dr. Slump . Anticipating that readers would expect Goku to win the tournaments , Toriyama had him lose the first two while planning an eventual victory . He said that Muscle Tower in the Red Ribbon Army storyline was inspired by the video game Spartan X , in which enemies tended to appear very fast . He then created Piccolo Daimao as a truly evil villain , and as a result called that arc the most interesting to draw . Once Goku and company had become the strongest on Earth , they turned to extraterrestrial opponents including the Saiyans . Freeza , who forcibly took over planets to resell them , was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators , whom Toriyama called the " worst kind of people . " Finding the escalating enemies difficult , he created the <unk> Force to add more balance to the series . He added time travel next , but said he had a hard time with it , only thinking of what to do that week and having to discuss it with his second editor Yu Kondo . After Cell 's death , Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series ' protagonist , but felt the character was not suited for the role and changed his mind . 
 Going against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size , he designed many of Dragon Ball 's most powerful characters with small statures , including the protagonist , Goku . When creating a character , his process is to first come up with their face and body type , and then the clothes while thinking of the world they inhabit and if the fighters can move around in them . Toriyama said that he did not plan the details of the story , resulting in strange occurrences and discrepancies later in the series , including changing the colors of the characters mid @-@ story and few characters having screen tone because he found it difficult to use . 
 Toriyama later explained the he had Goku grow up as a means to make drawing fight scenes easier , even though his first editor Kazuhiko Torishima was initially against it because it was rare to have the main character of a manga series change drastically . When including fights in the manga , Toriyama had the characters go to uninhabited locations to avoid difficulties in drawing residents and destroyed buildings . While he personally dislikes the idea of naming fighting techniques , Torishima at the time felt it would be better , so Toriyama proceeded to create names for all of the techniques , except for the series ' signature Kamehameha ( <unk> , lit . " <unk> Wave " ) which his wife came up with when he was indecisive about what it should be called . In order to advance the story quickly by having characters travel without inconvenience , he created the flying cloud <unk> @-@ un ( <unk> , lit . " Somersault Cloud " ) , then gave most fighters the flying technique <unk> @-@ jutsu ( <unk> , lit . " Air Dance Technique " ) , and finally granted Goku the teleportation ability Shunkan <unk> ( <unk> , lit . " Instant Teleport " ) . Once he came up with the idea of the Super Saiyan , he felt the only way to show Goku 's massive power up was to have him transform . Initially he was concerned that the facial expression looked like that of a villain , but felt since the transformation was brought about by anger it was acceptable . While talking to his long @-@ time friend and fellow manga artist Masakazu Katsura about how there was nothing stronger than a Super Saiyan , Katsura suggested having two characters " fuse " together , leading to the creation of the Fusion ( <unk> , <unk> ) technique . Since the completion of Dragon Ball , Toriyama has continued to add to its story , mostly background information on its universe , through guidebooks published by Shueisha . 
 During the second half of the series , Toriyama has said that he had become more interested in coming up with the story than actually drawing it , and that the battles became more intense with him simplifying the lines . He also said he would get letters from readers complaining that the art had become " too square " , so he intentionally made it more so . In 2013 , he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed , so he did not draw very elaborate , going so far as to suggest one could say that he was not interested in the art . He also once said that his goal for the series was to tell an " unconventional and contradictory " story . In 2013 , commenting on Dragon Ball 's global success , Toriyama said , " Frankly , I don 't quite understand why it happened . While the manga was being serialized , the only thing I wanted as I kept drawing was to make Japanese boys happy . " , " The role of my manga is to be a work of entertainment through and through . I dare say I don 't care even if [ my works ] have left nothing behind , as long as they have entertained their readers . "

 Written and illustrated by Akira Toriyama , Dragon Ball was serialized in the manga anthology Weekly Shōnen Jump from November 20 , 1984 to May 23 , 1995 , when Toriyama grew exhausted and felt he needed a break from drawing . The 519 individual chapters were published into 42 tankōbon volumes by Shueisha from September 10 , 1985 through August 4 , 1995 . In 2002 , the chapters were re @-@ released in a collection of 34 kanzenban volumes , which included a slightly rewritten ending , new covers , and color artwork from its Weekly Shōnen Jump run .

 The Dragon Ball manga is licensed for release in English in North America by Viz Media . Viz originally released volumes 17 through 42 ( chapters 195 through 519 ) under the title " Dragon Ball Z " to mimic the name of the anime series adapted from those volumes , feeling it would reduce the potential for confusion by its readers . They initially released both series chapter by chapter in a monthly comic book format starting in 1998 , and later began collecting them in graphic novels in 2000 . In 2000 , while releasing Dragon Ball in the monthly format , Viz began to censor the series in response to complaints by parents . They argued that when there are parental complaints , major chain stores stop selling the series , so to keep wide distribution , they made some " concessions " . They assured that all changes were done with approval by Toriyama and Shueisha , with Toriyama making suggestions himself : such as to obscure Goku 's genitals with objects , rather than " neuter him " . A fan petition that garnered over 10 @,@ 000 signatures was created , and a year later , Viz announced they would stop censoring the series and instead increased its " rating " to 13 and up , and reprinted the first 3 graphic novels . 
 " Dragon Ball Z " , from Trunk 's appearance to chapter 226 , was published in Viz 's monthly magazine Shonen Jump from its debut issue in January 2003 to April 2005 . Later , the first ten collected volumes of both series were re @-@ released from March to May 2003 under their " Shonen Jump " imprint , with Dragon Ball being completed on August 3 , 2004 and Dragon Ball Z finishing on June 6 , 2006 . However , when releasing the last few volumes of Dragon Ball Z , the company began to censor the series again ; translating the sound effects of gunshots to " zap " and changing the few sexual references . In June 2008 , Viz began re @-@ releasing the two series in a <unk> format called " Viz Big Edition , " which collects three individual volumes into a single large volume . These editions are on higher quality paper and include some of the original Weekly Shōnen Jump color pages , however , they include new censorship not in the 2003 releases . On November 3 , 2008 , the first volumes of both series were released in hardcover " Collector 's Editions . " Viz began releasing new 3 @-@ in @-@ 1 volumes of Dragon Ball , similar to their " Viz Big Edition " , with volume one released on June 4 , 2013 .

They serialized chapter 195 to 245 of the fully colored version of the manga in their digital anthology Weekly Shonen Jump from February 2013 to February 2014 . They began publishing Dragon Ball Full Color Edition into large printed volumes on February 4 , 2014 . 
 The manga has also been licensed in other English @-@ speaking countries , distributed in the same Viz format of separating it into Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. The United Kingdom 's release of the manga has been through different distributors . From August 2005 to November 2007 , Gollancz Manga an imprint of the Orion Publishing Group released the 16 volumes of Dragon Ball and the first 4 of Dragon Ball Z. Viz would release the books after Gollancz and expand to digital sales on the Nook in August 2013 .

 Dragon Ball is one of the most popular manga series of all time , and it continues to enjoy high readership today . By 2000 , more than 126 million copies of its tankōbon volumes had been sold in Japan alone . By 2012 , this number had grown to pass 156 million in Japan and 230 million worldwide , making it the second best @-@ selling Weekly Shōnen Jump manga of all time . Dragon Ball is credited as one of the main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the mid @-@ 1980s and mid @-@ 1990s . For the 10th anniversary of the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006 , Japanese fans voted Dragon Ball the third greatest manga of all time . 
 In a survey conducted by Oricon in 2007 among 1 @,@ 000 people , Son Goku , the main character of the franchise , ranked first place as the " Strongest Manga Character of All Time . " Goku 's journey and his ever growing strength resulted in the character winning " the admiration of young boys everywhere " . Manga artists , such as One Piece creator Eiichiro Oda and Naruto creator Masashi Kishimoto , have stated that Goku inspired their series ' main protagonists as well as series structure . 
 Manga critic Jason Thompson stated in 2011 that " Dragon Ball is by far the most influential shonen manga of the last 30 years , and today , almost every Shonen Jump artist lists it as one of their favorites and lifts from it in various ways . " He says the series " turns from a gag / adventure manga to an nearly @-@ pure fighting manga " , and its basic formula of " lots of martial arts , lots of training sequences , a few jokes " became the model for other shōnen series , such as Naruto . Thompson also called Toriyama 's art influential and cited it as a reason for the series ' popularity . James S. <unk> , author of The Rough Guide to Manga , claims that the first several chapters of Dragon Ball " play out much like Saiyuki with Dr. Slump @-@ like humour built in " and that Dr. Slump , Toriyama 's previous manga , has a clear early influence on the series . He feels the series " established its unique identity " after the first occasion when Goku 's group disbands and he trains under Kame @-@ sen 'nin , when the story develops " a far more action @-@ packed , sinister tone " with " wilder " battles with aerial and spiritual elements and an increased death count , while humor still makes an occasional appearance . <unk> claims that an art shift occurs when the characters " lose the rounded , innocent look that he established in Dr. Slump and gain sharper angles that leap off the page with their energy and intensity . " 
 Animerica felt the series had " worldwide appeal " , using dramatic pacing and over @-@ the @-@ top martial arts action to " maintain tension levels and keep a <unk> crossface hold on the audience 's attention spans " . In Little Boy : The Art of Japan 's Exploding Subculture , Takashi Murakami commented that Dragon Ball 's " never @-@ ending cyclical narrative moves forward plausibly , seamlessly , and with great finesse . " Ridwan Khan from <unk> commented that the manga had a " chubby " art style , but as the series continued the characters got more refined , leaner , and more muscular . Khan prefers the manga over the slow pacing of the anime counterparts . Allen Divers of Anime News Network praised the story and humor of the manga as being very good at conveying all of the characters ' personalities . Divers also called Viz 's translation one of the best of all the English editions of the series due to its faithfulness to the original Japanese . D. Aviva Rothschild of <unk> remarked the first manga volume as " a superior humor title " . They praised Goku 's innocence and Bulma 's insistence as one of the funniest parts of the series . 
 The content of the manga has been controversial in United States . In November 1999 , Toys " R " Us removed Viz 's Dragon Ball from their stores nationwide when a Dallas parent complained the series had " borderline soft porn " after he bought them for his four @-@ year @-@ old son . Commenting on the issue , Susan J. Napier explained it as a difference in culture . After the ban , Viz reluctantly began to censor the series to keep wide distribution . However , in 2001 , after releasing three volumes censored , Viz announced Dragon Ball would be uncensored and reprinted due to fan reactions . In October 2009 , Wicomico County Public Schools in Maryland banned the Dragon Ball manga from their school district because it " depicts nudity , sexual contact between children and sexual innuendo among adults and children . "

 The anime adaptations have also been very well @-@ received and are better known in the Western world than the manga , with Anime News Network saying " Few anime series have mainstreamed it the way Dragon Ball Z has . To a certain generation of television consumers its characters are as well known as any in the animated realm , and for many it was the first step into the wilderness of anime fandom . " In 2000 , satellite TV channel Animax together with Brutus , a men 's lifestyle magazine , and Tsutaya , Japan 's largest video rental chain , conducted a poll among 200 @,@ 000 fans on the top anime series , with Dragon Ball coming in fourth . TV Asahi conducted two polls in 2005 on the Top 100 Anime , Dragon Ball came in second in the nationwide survey conducted with multiple age @-@ groups and in third in the online poll . On several occasions the Dragon Ball anime has topped Japan 's DVD sales . 
 Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network summed up Dragon Ball as " an action @-@ packed tale told with rare humor and something even rarer — a genuine sense of adventure . " Both Kimlinger and colleague Theron Martin noted Funimation 's reputation for drastic alterations of the script , but praised the dub . However , some critics and most fans of the Japanese version have been more critical with Funimation 's English dub and script of Dragon Ball Z over the years . Jeffrey Harris IGN criticized the voices including how Freeza 's appearance combined with the feminine English voice left fans confused about Freeza 's gender . Carlos Ross of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews considered the series ' characters to be different from stereotypical stock characters and noted that they undergo much more development . Despite praising Dragon Ball Z for its cast of characters , they criticized it for having long and repetitive fights . 
 Dragon Ball Z is well @-@ known , and often criticized , for its long , repetitive , dragged @-@ out fights that span several episodes , with Martin commenting " <unk> practically turned drawing out fights into an art form . " However , Jason Thompson of io9 explained that this comes from the fact that the anime was being created alongside the manga . Dragon Ball Z was listed as the 78th best animated show in IGN 's Top 100 Animated Series , and was also listed as the 50th greatest cartoon in Wizard magazine 's Top 100 Greatest Cartoons list . 
 Harris commented that Dragon Ball GT " is downright repellent " , mentioning that the material and characters had lost their novelty and fun . He also criticized the GT character designs of Trunks and Vegeta as being goofy . Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network also gave negative comments about GT , mentioning that the fights from the series were " a very simple childish exercise " and that many other anime were superior . The plot of Dragon Ball GT has also been criticized for giving a formula that was already used in its predecessors . 
 The first episode of Dragon Ball Z Kai earned a viewer ratings percentage of 11 @.@ 3 , ahead of One Piece and behind Crayon Shin @-@ chan . Although following episodes had lower ratings , Kai was among the top 10 anime in viewer ratings every week in Japan for most of its run .

The umpire for the race for the fifth year in a row was Frank Willan who won the event four consecutive times , rowing for Oxford in the 1866 , 1867 , 1868 and 1869 races .

 Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station , handing the Middlesex side of the river to Oxford . With a good spring tide and a light breeze from the east , umpire Willan started the race at 4 : 35 p.m. , with the Light Blues outrating their opponents at 40 strokes per minute , and taking an early lead . Oxford drew level and moved ahead , holding a length 's lead by the Mile Post . With the advantage of the river 's course to Cambridge , by Hammersmith Bridge the lead had been cut to half a length and at The Doves pub ( almost 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) along the course ) , the crews were once again level .

 Ventidius Cumanus ( fl . 1st century AD ) was the Roman procurator of Iudaea Province from AD 48 to c . AD 52 .

Cumanus ' time in office was marked by disputes between his troops and the Jewish population .

However , Tacitus states that Felix was already governing Samaria before 52 , while Cumanus had authority over Galilee to the north ( see map ) . Tacitus does not mention who controlled other areas of the province . 
 This conflict has led historians to take a number of positions on political arrangements in the province . Some have argued that Josephus ' greater knowledge of Jewish affairs justifies favouring his account . M. Aberbach believes that there was a division of power , but that Tacitus reversed the governors ' areas of authority and that Cumanus actually governed the south and Felix the north ; this fits better with Josephus , who describes Cumanus as active in Jerusalem and nearby . Another suggestion is that part of the province was transferred to Felix after disturbances under Cumanus ' rule . 
 = = = Roman @-@ Jewish conflict = = = 
 Under Alexander , the province of Iudaea had enjoyed a period of relative peace , but that proved to be transient , as Cumanus ' governorship was marked by a series of serious public disturbances . Trouble started while Jewish pilgrims were gathered in Jerusalem for the Passover feast . Cumanus , following the precedent set by earlier governors , assembled a detachment of Roman soldiers on the roof of the Temple portico to maintain order among the crowds , but one caused chaos by exposing himself to the Jews in the courtyard while calling out insults . Some of the Jews brought their complaints to Cumanus , but others began to retaliate by hurling stones at the soldiers . Some openly accused Cumanus of being responsible for the provocation – a sign that relations between governor and provincials may already have been poor . Finding himself unable to calm the angry crowd , Cumanus called for fully armed reinforcements , who assembled either in the Temple courtyard or on the roof of the Antonia Fortress , overlooking the Temple . In the ensuing stampede , according to Josephus ' estimates , between twenty and thirty thousand people were crushed to death . These numbers may be exaggerated , but the loss of life was substantial ; the feast , says Josephus , " became the cause of mourning to the whole nation " . 
 Further unrest was triggered when an Imperial slave named Stephanus was robbed while travelling near Beth @-@ <unk> . Troops sent by Cumanus to arrest the leading men of the nearby villages began plundering the area . One of them , finding a copy of the Torah , destroyed it in view of the villagers while shouting <unk> . Angered by this insult to God and to the Jewish religion , a crowd of Jews confronted Cumanus at Caesarea Maritima , demanding that the guilty party should be punished . This time the governor acted decisively and ordered that the soldier responsible should be beheaded in front of his accusers , temporarily restoring the calm . 
 = = = Jewish @-@ Samaritan conflict = = = 
 The events that would cost Cumanus his office began with the murder of one or more Galilean pilgrims who had been travelling through Samaria on their way to Jerusalem . A Galilean embassy asked Cumanus to investigate but received little attention ; Josephus alleges that he had been bribed by the Samaritans to turn a blind eye . The result was that a crowd of Jews decided to take the law into their own hands . Under the leadership of two Zealots , Eleazar and Alexander , they invaded Samaria and began a massacre . Cumanus led most of his troops against the militants , killing many and taking others prisoner , and the Jewish leaders from Jerusalem were subsequently able to calm most of the others , but a state of guerrilla warfare persisted . 
 Meanwhile , two separate embassies had been dispatched to Tyre to appeal to Ummidius Caius Quadratus , who as legate of Syria had some authority over the lower @-@ ranking procurator of Iudaea . One , from the Samaritans , protested the Jewish attacks on Samaritan villages . The Jewish counter @-@ embassy held the Samaritans responsible for the violence and accused Cumanus of siding with them . Agreeing to investigate , Quadratus proceeded in 52 to Iudaea , where he had all of Cumanus ' Jewish prisoners crucified and ordered the beheading of several other Jews and Samaritans who had been involved in the fighting . 
 Perhaps after hearing a case against Cumanus in Iudaea , Quadratus sent him , along with several Jewish and Samaritan leaders including the High Priest Ananias , to plead their cases in Rome before the Emperor Claudius . At the hearing , several of Claudius ' influential freedmen officials took the side of Cumanus . However , the Jews were supported by Agrippa II , a friend of Claudius whose father , Agrippa I , had been the last king of Iudaea before the province was placed under Roman procurators . Whether influenced by court politics or not , Claudius decided in favour of the Jewish side . The Samaritan leaders were executed and Cumanus was sent into exile . Felix succeeded him as procurator of Iudaea . Cumanus ' life and career after his banishment are unknown .

 = Ince Blundell Hall = 
 For the building with a similar name in Cheshire see Ince Hall 
 Ince Blundell Hall is a former country house near the village of Ince Blundell , in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton , Merseyside , England . It was built between 1720 and 1750 for Robert Blundell , the lord of the manor , and was designed by Henry Sephton , a local mason @-@ architect . Robert 's son , Henry , was a collector of paintings and antiquities , and he built impressive structures in the grounds of the hall in which to house them . In the 19th century the estate passed to the Weld family . Thomas Weld Blundell modernised and expanded the house , and built an adjoining chapel . In the 1960s the house and estate were sold again , and have since been run as a nursing home by the <unk> of St. Augustine of the Mercy of Jesus . 
 The hall is Georgian in style , and consists of a main block with a service block linked at a right @-@ angle to its rear . The hall is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II * listed building . Some of the buildings associated with the hall are also designated at this grade ; these are the Pantheon and the Garden Temple , both of which were built by Henry Blundell for his collection of statues , the chapel , and a building known as the Old Hall . In the garden and grounds of the hall are nine structures listed at Grade II ; these include the stables , a monument , a sundial , gateways and a lodge , and the base of a medieval wayside cross . 
 = = History = = 
 The manor of Ince Blundell was held by the Blundell family from the 12th century . The first documentation of the name of Blundell at the site is that of Richard Blundell in 1212 . Following the Reformation the <unk> retained their Catholic faith and suffered from the consequent disadvantages and dangers . Nevertheless , by legal transactions and advantageous marriages the Blundell family acquired more possessions ; by the end of the 18th century they held 15 manors together with other property , some of it as far away as Liverpool and Preston . 
 The present house was built by Robert Blundell ( 1700 – 73 ) who inherited the estate in 1711 . Building began in about 1720 , and it was finished by 1750 . The house was designed by Henry Sephton , who was the " leading mason @-@ architect in the area " at that time . In 1761 Robert Blundell moved from the house to Liverpool , and the estate passed to his eldest son , Henry ( 1724 – 1810 ) . Henry then started to extend the house by adding what he described as " a large body of offices " at right @-@ angles to the main block , and he did this " without the help of a <unk> ( sic ) or any architect " . In the grounds he designed and built a stable block and greenhouses , created a kitchen garden , and landscaped the park , which included a lake and a ha @-@ ha . He built a wall around the perimeter of the estate , and designed one , and possibly two , of the gateways . 
 Henry Blundell was a collector , first of paintings and later of statues and antiquities , the collection amounting to over 500 items . In order to house them at Ince Blundell , he constructed a series of buildings in the grounds of the hall . Initially he kept his collection in a series of greenhouses , but in about 1790 – 92 he built the Garden Temple , a building in Classical style . This was followed in about 1802 – 05 by a more impressive building , the Pantheon , its design based on the Pantheon in Rome . When Henry died in 1810 , the hall passed to his son , Charles . He died childless in 1837 , and the estate passed to Thomas Weld , a cousin . He took the name of Thomas Weld Blundell , and restored , refurnished and redecorated the hall . In the mid @-@ 19th century a large bay window was added to the west side of the Drawing Room , and a new Dining Room was built at the east end . Ceilings were raised , and interior decoration was carried out by the firm of Crace . Weld Blundell added a new vestibule to connect the Gallery , the Dining Room , and the Pantheon . The portico of the Pantheon became the new main entrance to the hall , and the Pantheon itself the reception hall . What had been the original chapel became the organ loft of a new large two @-@ storey chapel designed by J. J. <unk> . 
 During the Second World War the hall , its buildings and park were used by the War Office and the Admiralty , and additional buildings were erected . Five parachute bombs fell near the hall , one of them blowing out all the windows in the garden front . By 1960 the estate was " seriously dilapidated " , and it was decided to sell the hall and the surrounding land . The farms went to the sitting tenants , and the chapel , which had been used as a parish church since 1947 , was given to the Archdiocese of Liverpool . The hall was bought by the <unk> of St. Augustine of the Mercy of Jesus , who adapted it for use as a nursing home . It was officially opened as such on 27 May 1961 by the Rt Revd John Heenan , who was at that time the Archbishop of Liverpool . Much work had to be done to make the building fit for its new purpose , including making it weather @-@ proof , installing central heating , a lift , and a washbasin in each bedroom . A new entrance was created at the back of the hall , with access for wheelchairs . The former Gallery was converted into a chapel for the use of staff and residents . Henry Blundell 's wing is used partly to provide services for the hall , and partly by the sisters as a convent . The sisters and staff of the hall continue to provide nursing and other care for the elderly . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 = = = Exterior = = = 
 Ince Blundell Hall is in Georgian style . It is constructed in brick with sandstone dressings , and has an L @-@ shaped plan . The main block faces southeast ; it is in two storeys with an attic , and has a front of nine bays . Richard Pollard and Nikolaus Pevsner describe the front as being in late English Baroque style , and consider that it was " evidently inspired " by the front of Buckingham Palace , London . Between the upper storey and the attic is an entablature with a cornice and a panelled parapet . The central three bays project forward , the lower storeys are flanked by pairs of giant pilasters , and at the sides of the central doorway are giant columns . There are more pilasters at the ends of the building , and in the central three bays of the attic . All the pilasters and columns are Corinthian in style . The windows are sashes and are surrounded by architraves . The ground floor windows in the central bays have segmental heads with keystones , and those in the outer bays have friezes and pediments carried on consoles . Below the upper floor windows are panelled aprons and consoles . The central doorway has a segmental head and a keystone carved with the Blundell arms . At the corners of the front are quoins . 
 To the right of the main block is a 19th @-@ century single @-@ storey wing with five bays , the central three of which are canted . Behind is a single @-@ storey block , linking the main block to the service block , which is at right angles to the rear . The service block is Henry Blundell 's " offices " , and is in Palladian style . It faces southwest , is in two storeys , and has a seven @-@ bay front , plus a three @-@ storey three @-@ bay pavilion to the right . The central three bays of the service block project forward under a pediment . Above the central porch is a Diocletian window . There is a clock in the gable , and over the pediment is a cupola carried on Tuscan columns . The windows are sashes with wedge lintels . The central bay of the pavilion is round @-@ headed and recessed , and its windows are a mixture of Diocletian , tripartite , and oculi . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 When the house was first built , the main entrance was through the centre of the southeast face , which led into an entrance hall . Following the alterations carried out by Weld Blundell in the 19th century , the portico of the Pantheon became the new main entrance . When the house was converted into a nursing home , a new entrance was created at the rear . At the time the Weld Blundell family moved from the house , the entrance hall was used as a Library , the Drawing Room was to the left , and a Billiard Room to the right . To the right of this was the Dining Room , and behind it was the Gallery . The Billiard Room has become the Music Room , the former Library is a lounge for the residents , and the former Gallery is the chapel for the staff and residents . 
 The interior of the house has retained much of the decoration carried out by Crace . The ceiling contains Rococo plasterwork dating from about 1750 depicting symbols relating to music and hunting , together with representations of learning and cultivation . On the walls are paintings by Crace . Pollard and Pevsner refer to these as being " delicately pretty <unk> decoration " . The former Entrance Hall is " small , simple and sober " , and the Staircase Hall behind it is " not a grand space at all " . The Dining Room , also decorated by Crace , contains oak panelling on the walls , and painted panels in the ceiling . The oak fireplace replaces the original marble fireplace that was removed when the Weld Blundell family left the house . There is also a scheme of Crace decoration in the former Gallery .

 = = = Pantheon = = = 
 The Pantheon is at the angle between the main block and the service block . It is built in stone with a lead dome and has a circular plan . On the southeast side is an Ionic portico with four columns , a frieze , and a cornice . On the exterior are niches and panels with reliefs . Inside is an Ionic <unk> , a frieze decorated with triglyphs and roundels , and niches for statues , four of which are in the shape of Venetian windows . The interior of the dome is coffered , and it has a central glazed oculus , which is the only source of lighting for the building . 
 = = = Garden Temple = = = 
 The Garden Temple , which is in the form of a temple , stands in the grounds to the south of the hall . It was probably designed by William Everard , and it was restored in about 2000 . The building is mainly in stuccoed brick with stone dressings , and has a hipped roof . On the front is a Tuscan portico with four columns , reliefs , and busts , and in the pediment is a mask . The frieze contains a Latin inscription , which translates as " In this place it is summer and winter all year round " , referring to the fact that the building was heated by air from external fireplaces . Behind the portico is a three @-@ bay <unk> , and a central entrance flanked by niches and with a relief above . Inside there are recesses for statues , two in the shape of Venetian windows . Some Roman masks and relief panels have been set into the walls . 
 = = = Old Hall = = = 
 Despite its name , this was not the previous hall , as the present hall was built on the site of the older hall . Its original purpose is unknown , and in the 19th century it was used for drying hops . The building stands in the grounds to the southwest of the hall . It is in brick with stone dressings , and has a roof partly of stone @-@ slate and partly of slate . The building has three storeys and a front of five irregular bays . The windows are mullioned , and the entrances have quoins and large lintels with slight Tudor arches . 
 = = = Church of the Holy Family = = = 
 The church is at right angles to the north end of the service block . It was originally the family chapel , and has since been used as a Roman Catholic parish church . It was built in 1858 – 60 and designed by J. J. <unk> . The church is in brick with stone dressings and has a slate roof . The exterior is relatively plain , but the interior is elaborately decorated , some of which may have been executed by Crace ; there are also paintings by Gebhard <unk> . 
 = = = Stables = = = 
 The stables are in the grounds to the southwest of the hall . They were built in about 1800 – 14 , and are in brick with stone dressings and a hipped slate roof . The stables are in two storeys and have a nine @-@ bay front , the central three bays projecting forward under a pedimented gable . In the centre is a recessed round @-@ headed entrance with angle pilasters , an archivolt , and a keystone . Above this is a Diocletian window . Elsewhere the windows in the ground floor are sashes with wedge lintels , and those in the upper storey are oculi . There are more round @-@ headed recesses in the end bays , and a 20th @-@ century garage to the north . 
 = = = Garden structures = = = 
 In the garden to the south of the main block is a monument in the form of a marble Tuscan column on a stone plinth . It carries an eagle , and dates from the early 19th century . To the southwest of the hall is a sundial dated 1741 . This consists of a stone baluster , and its metal plate is missing . Further to the southwest is an octagonal structure built into the wall of the kitchen garden . It is in stuccoed brick with a slate roof , and has a round @-@ headed entrance and a keystone decorated with an acanthus . This flanked by recesses , and there are more recesses inside . Also within the grounds of the hall is the base of a medieval wayside cross , which is a scheduled monument . 
 = = = Gates and lodge = = = 
 The most impressive entrance to the grounds is the Lion Gate on the <unk> road to the south of the hall . It was designed by Henry Blundell in the 1770s , its Baroque style design copied from a gateway in the background of one of his paintings , the Marriage of Bacchus and Ariadne by Sebastiano Ricci . The gate is constructed in sandstone and consists of a central round @-@ arched entrance and two flat @-@ headed pedestrian entrances . The central entrance is in Doric style with columns , and an entablature with a triglyph frieze including <unk> and rosettes . On the top is a broken pediment containing a cartouche and an urn decorated with ram 's heads and festoons . The pedestrian entrances have rusticated surrounds . Above one is a statue of a lion , and above the other is a lioness . The entrances contain cast iron gates . The East Gate dates from the 1770s , and was probably also designed by Henry Blundell . It has a round @-@ headed central entrance and flat @-@ headed pedestrian entrances , and is simpler than the Lion Gate . The central entrance is flanked by Ionic pilasters , there is a fluted frieze with a decorated central panel , and a pediment . Above the pedestrian entrances are tented caps decorated with festoons and rosettes . 
 The West Lodge , also on the <unk> road , is to the north of the Lion Gate . Dating from the middle of the 19th century it is in French Renaissance style , built in brick with stone dressings and a slate roof . The lodge has three bays , the central lodge with two storeys , and the outer lodges with one storey and attics . The central bay is flanked by pilasters , and has a round @-@ headed entrance with archivolts , a keystone , and decorated spandrels . The windows are round @-@ headed sashes ; there is a pair above the entrance , and one in each of the outer bays . In the attics are dormers with ball finials . The outer bays have hipped roofs , the central bay has a pyramidal roof , and all have spike finials . The simplest entrance is the Northeast Gate , dating from the 1770s , consisting of a pair of gate piers with later gates . The rusticated piers are in stone and have moulded caps and flattened ball finials .

 Ince Blundell Hall is described by Pollard and Pevsner as a " splendid Georgian house " , although they consider Blundell 's service block is " a rather plodding Palladian affair " . The hall was designated a Grade II * listed building on 11 October 1968 . Grade II * is the middle of the three grades of listing and is applied to " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " . Also listed at this grade are the Pantheon , the Garden Temple , the Old Hall , and the Church of the Holy Family , along with the park and garden surrounding the hall . Other structures are listed at Grade II , the lowest grade , which is applied to " buildings of national importance and special interest " . These are the stables , the column carrying an eagle , the sundial , the octagonal structure , the Lion Gate , the East Gate , the West Lodge , the Northeast Gate , and the base of the wayside cross . 
 = National Front ( France ) = 
 The National Front ( French : Front national , French pronunciation : ​ [ <unk> ̃ <unk> ] , FN ) is a socially conservative , nationalist political party in France . Its major policies include economic protectionism , a zero tolerance approach to law and order issues , and opposition to immigration . A eurosceptic party , the FN has opposed the European Union since its creation in 1993 . Most political commentators place the FN on the right to far right but party representatives reject this and suggest other ways of looking at the left – right axis . The party was founded in 1972 to unify a variety of French nationalist movements of the time . Jean @-@ Marie Le Pen was the party 's first leader and the undisputed centre of the party from its start until his resignation in 2011 . Marine Le Pen , his daughter , was elected as the current leader . While the party struggled as a marginal force for its first ten years , since 1984 it has been the major force of French nationalism . 
 The 2002 presidential election was the first in France to include a National Front candidate in the run @-@ off , after Jean @-@ Marie Le Pen beat the Socialist candidate in the first round . In the run @-@ off , he finished a distant second to Jacques Chirac . Due to the French electoral system , the party 's representation in public office has been limited , despite its significant share of the vote . 
 While her father was nicknamed the " Devil of the Republic " by mainstream media , Marine Le Pen pursued a policy of " de @-@ demonization " of the party by softening its image . She endeavoured to extract it from its far @-@ right cultural roots , and to normalize it by giving it a culture of government , expelling controversial members like her father , who was suspended , and then expelled by his own party in 2015 after he referred , once again , to the Nazi gas chambers as " a point of detail of the history of the Second World War " ; he later set up the Blue , White and Red Rally . Since her election as the leader of the party in 2011 , the popularity of the FN continued to grow apace : the party won several municipalities at the 2014 municipal elections ; it became the first French party at the 2014 European elections with 25 % of the votes ; and again in the last departmental elections in France . They , once again , came out in 1st place in the last regional elections with a historic result of nearly 28 % of the votes . Marine Le Pen would lead the first round of the 2017 presidential elections , according to various polls . As of 2015 , the FN has established itself as one of the largest political forces in France . 
 = = Background = = 
 The FN springs from a right @-@ wing tradition in France that dates back to the French Revolution of 1789 , and the party rejects both the revolution and its legacy . One of the primary progenitors of the party was the Action Française , founded at the end of the 19th century , and its descendants in the Restauration Nationale , a pro @-@ monarchy group that supports the claim of the Count of Paris to the French throne . More recently , the party drew from the <unk> of the 1950s , which started out as an anti @-@ tax movement without relations to the right @-@ wing , but included among its parliamentary deputies " proto @-@ nationalists " such as Jean @-@ Marie Le Pen . 
 Another conflict that is part of the party 's background was the Algerian War ( many <unk> , including Le Pen , were directly involved in the war ) , and the right @-@ wing dismay over the decision by French President Charles de Gaulle to abandon his promise of holding on to French Algeria . In the 1965 presidential election , Le Pen unsuccessfully attempted to consolidate the right @-@ wing vote around the right @-@ wing presidential candidate Jean @-@ Louis <unk> @-@ <unk> . During the late 1960s and early 1970s , the French far @-@ right consisted mainly of small extreme movements such as Occident , Groupe Union Défense ( GUD ) , and the Ordre Nouveau ( ON ) . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early years ( 1972 – 1981 ) = = = 
 While the ON had competed in some local elections since 1970 , at its second congress in June 1972 it decided to establish a new political party to contest the 1973 legislative elections . The party was launched on 5 October 1972 under the name National Front for French Unity ( Front national pour l <unk> française ) , or Front National . In order to create a broad movement , the ON sought to model the new party ( as it earlier had sought to model itself ) on the more established Italian Social Movement ( MSI ) , which at the time appeared to establish a broad coalition for the Italian right . The FN adopted a French version of the MSI tricolour flame as its logo . It wanted to unite the various French far @-@ right currents , and brought together Le Pen 's nationalist group , Roger <unk> 's Party of French Unity , Georges <unk> 's Justice and Liberty movement , former <unk> , Algerian War veterans , and some monarchists , among others . Le Pen was chosen to be the first president of the party , as he was untainted with the militant public image of the ON and was a relatively moderate figure on the far @-@ right . 
 The National Front fared poorly in the 1973 legislative elections , receiving 0 @.@ 5 % of the national vote ( although Le Pen won 5 % in his Paris constituency ) . In 1973 the party created a youth movement , the Front national de la jeunesse ( National Front of the Youth , <unk> ) . The rhetoric used in the campaign stressed old far @-@ right themes and was largely uninspiring to the electorate at the time . Otherwise , its official program at this point was relatively moderate , differing little from the mainstream right . Le Pen sought the " total fusion " of the currents in the party , and warned against crude activism . The more radical elements of the ON were not persuaded , and reverted to hard activism . They were banned from the party later that year . Le Pen soon became the undisputed leader of the party , although this cost it many leading members and much of its militant base . 
 In the 1974 presidential election , Le Pen failed to find a mobilising theme for his campaign . Many of its major issues , such as anti @-@ communism , were shared by most of the mainstream right . Other FN issues included calls for increased French birth rates , immigration reduction ( although this was downplayed ) , establishment of a professional army , abrogation of the Évian Accords , and generally the creation of a " French and European renaissance . " Despite being the only nationalist candidate , he failed to gain the support of a united far @-@ right , as the various groups either rallied behind other candidates or called for voter abstention . The campaign further lost ground when the Revolutionary Communist League published a denunciation of Le Pen 's alleged involvement in torture during his time in Algeria . In his first presidential election , Le Pen gained only 0 @.@ 8 % of the national vote . 
 = = = = FN – PFN rivalry = = = = 
 Following the 1974 election , the FN was obscured by the appearance of the Party of New Forces ( PFN ) , founded by FN dissidents ( largely from the ON ) . Their competition weakened both parties throughout the 1970s . During the same time , the FN gained several new groups of supporters , including François Duprat and his " revolutionary nationalists " , Jean @-@ Pierre Stirbois and his " <unk> " , the Nouvelle Droite , and Bernard Anthony . Following the death of Duprat in a bomb attack , the revolutionary nationalists left the party , while Stirbois became Le Pen 's deputy as his <unk> effectively ousted the neo @-@ fascist tendency in the party leadership . The far @-@ right was marginalised altogether in the 1978 legislative elections , although the PFN was better off . For the first election for the European Parliament in 1979 , the PFN had become part of an attempt to build a " Euro @-@ Right " alliance of European far @-@ right parties , and was in the end the only one of the two that contested the election . It fielded Jean @-@ Louis <unk> @-@ <unk> as its primary candidate , while Le Pen called for voter abstention . 
 For the 1981 presidential election , both Le Pen and Pascal <unk> of the PFN declared their intentions to run . However , an increased requirement on support by elected officials had been introduced for the election , which left both Le Pen and <unk> unable to stand for the election . ( In France , parties have to secure support from a specific number of elected officials , from a specific number of departments , in order to be eligible to run for election . In 1976 , the number of required elected officials was increased fivefold , and the number of departments threefold . ) The election was won by François Mitterrand of the Socialist Party ( PS ) , which gave the political left national power for the first time in the Fifth Republic ; he then dissolved the National Assembly to call a snap legislative election . The PS attained its best ever result with an absolute majority in the 1981 legislative election . This " socialist takeover " led to a radicalisation in centre @-@ right , anti @-@ communist , and anti @-@ socialist voters . With only three weeks to prepare its campaign , the FN fielded only a limited number of candidates and won only 0 @.@ 2 % of the national vote . The PFN was even worse off , and the election marked the effective end of competition from the party . 
 = = = Electoral breakthrough ( 1982 – 1988 ) = = = 
 While the French party system had been dominated by polarisation and competition between the clear @-@ cut ideological alternatives of two political blocs in the 1970s , the two blocs had largely moved towards the centre by the mid @-@ 1980s . This led many voters to perceive the blocs as more or less indistinguishable , in turn inciting them to seek out to new political alternatives . By October 1982 , Le Pen supported the prospect of deals with the mainstream right , provided that the FN did not have to soften its position on key issues . In the 1983 municipal elections , the centre @-@ right Rally for the Republic ( RPR ) and centrist Union for French Democracy ( UDF ) formed alliances with the FN in a number of towns . The most notable result came in the 20th arrondissement of Paris , where Le Pen was elected to the local council with 11 % of the vote . Later by @-@ elections kept media attention on the party , and it was for the first time allowed to pose as a viable component of the broader right . In a by @-@ election in Dreux in October , the FN won 17 % of the vote . With the choice of defeat to the political left or dealing with the FN , the local RPR and UDF , to a minor national sensation , agreed to form an alliance with the FN , and together won the second round with 55 % of the vote . The events in Dreux were a monumental factor for the rise of the FN . 
 Le Pen protested the media boycott against his party by sending letters to President Mitterrand in mid @-@ 1982 . After some letter exchanges , Mitterrand instructed the heads of the main television channels to give equitable coverage to the FN . In January 1984 , the party made its first appearance in a monthly poll of political popularity , in which 9 % of respondents held a " positive opinion " of the FN and some support for Le Pen . The next month , Le Pen was for the first time invited to a prime @-@ time television interview program , which he himself later deemed " the hour that changed everything " . The 1984 European elections in June came as a shock , as the FN won 11 % of the vote and ten seats . Notably , the election used proportional representation and had a low level of importance , which played to the party 's advantage . The FN made inroads in constituencies of both the right and left , and finished second in a number of towns . While many Socialists had arguably exploited the party in order to divide the right , Mitterrand later conceded that he had underestimated Le Pen . By July , 17 % of opinion poll respondents held a positive opinion of the FN . 
 By the early 1980s , the FN featured a mosaic of ideological tendencies and attracted figures who were previously resistant to the party . The party managed to draw supporters from the mainstream right , including some high @-@ profile defectors from the RPR , UDF , and National Centre of Independents and Peasants ( <unk> ) . In the 1984 European elections , eleven of the 81 FN candidates came from these parties , and the party 's list also included an Arab and a Jew ( although in unwinnable positions ) . Former collaborators were also accepted in the party , as Le Pen urged the need for " reconciliation " , arguing that forty years after the war the only important question was whether or not " they wish to serve their country " . The FN won 8 @.@ 7 % overall support in the 1985 cantonal elections , and over 30 % in some areas . 
 For the 1986 legislative elections the FN took advantage of a new proportional representation system that had been imposed by Mitterrand in order to moderate a foreseeable defeat for his PS . In the election , the FN won 9 @.@ 8 % of the vote and 35 seats in the National Assembly . Many of its seats could be filled by a new wave of respectable political operatives , notables , who had joined the party after its 1984 success . The RPR won a majority with smaller centre @-@ right parties , and thus avoided the need to deal with the FN . Although it was unable to exercise any real political influence , the party could project an image of political legitimacy . The party 's time in the National Assembly effectively came to an end when Jacques Chirac reinstated the two @-@ round system of majority voting for the next election . In the regional elections held on the same day , it won 137 seats , and gained representation in 21 of the 22 French regional councils . The RPR depended on FN support to win presidencies in some regional councils , and the FN won vice @-@ presidential posts in four regions .

 Le Pen 's campaign for the upcoming presidential election unofficially began in the months following the 1986 election . To promote his statesmanship credentials , he made trips to South East Asia , the United States , and Africa . The management of the formal campaign , launched in April 1987 , was entrusted to Bruno Mégret , one of the new notables . With his entourage , Le Pen traversed France for the entire period and , helped by Mégret , employed an American @-@ style campaign . Le Pen 's presidential campaign was highly successful ; no candidates came close to rival his ability to excite audiences at rallies and boost ratings at television appearances . Using a populist tone , Le Pen presented himself as the representative of the people against the " gang of four " ( RPR , UDF , PS , Communist Party ) , while the central theme of his campaign was " national preference " . In the 1988 presidential election , Le Pen won an unprecedented 14 @.@ 4 % of the vote , and double the votes from 1984 . 
 The FN was hurt in the snap 1988 legislative elections by the return two @-@ ballot majority voting , by the limited campaign period , and by the departure of many notables . In the election the party retained its 9 @.@ 8 % support from the previous legislative election , but was reduced to a single seat in the National Assembly . Following some anti @-@ Semitic comments made by Le Pen and the FN newspaper National Hebdo in the late 1980s , some valuable FN politicians left the party . Other quarrels soon also left the party without its remaining member of the National Assembly . In November 1988 , general secretary Jean @-@ Pierre Stirbois , who , together with his wife Marie @-@ France , had been instrumental in the FN 's early electoral successes , died in a car accident , leaving Bruno Mégret as the unrivalled de facto FN deputy leader . The FN only got 5 % in the 1988 cantonal elections , while the RPR announced it would reject any alliance with the FN , now including at local level . In the 1989 European elections , the FN held on to its ten seats as it won 11 @.@ 7 % of the vote . 
 In the wake of FN electoral success , the immigration debate , growing concerns over Islamic fundamentalism , and the fatwa against Salman Rushdie by Ayatollah Khomeini , the 1989 affaire du foulard was the first major test of the relations between the values of the French Republic and Islam . Following the event , surveys found that French public opinion was largely negative towards Islam . In a 1989 legislative by @-@ election in Dreux , FN candidate Marie @-@ France Stirbois , campaigning on an anti @-@ Islamism platform , returned a symbolic FN presence to the National Assembly . By the early 1990s , some mainstream politicians began employing anti @-@ immigration rhetoric . In the first round of the 1993 legislative elections the FN soared to 12 @.@ 7 % of the overall vote , but did not win a single seat due to the nature of the electoral system ( if the election had used proportional representation , it would have won 64 seats ) . In the 1995 presidential election , Le Pen rose slightly to 15 % of the vote . 
 = = = = 1995 municipal elections = = = = 
 The FN won an absolute majority ( and thus the mayorship ) in three cities in the 1995 municipal elections : Toulon , <unk> , and Orange . ( It had won a mayorship only once before , in the small town of Saint @-@ Gilles @-@ du @-@ Gard in 1989 . ) Le Pen then declared that his party would implement its " national preference " policy , with the risk of provoking the central government and being at odds with the laws of the Republic . The FN pursued interventionist policies with regards to the new cultural complexion of their towns by directly influencing artistic events , cinema schedules , and library holdings , as well as cutting or halting subsidies for multicultural associations . The party won <unk> , its fourth town , in a 1997 by @-@ election , where similar policies were pursued . <unk> ' new mayor Catherine Mégret ( fr ) ( who ran in place of her husband Bruno ) went further in one significant measure , introducing a special 5 @,@ 000 franc allowance for babies born to at least one parent of French ( or EU ) nationality . The measure was ruled illegal by a court , also giving her a suspended prison sentence , a fine , and a two @-@ year ban from public office . 
 = = = Turmoil , split of MNR ( 1997 – 2002 ) = = = 
 In the 1997 legislative elections the FN polled its best @-@ ever result with 15 @.@ 3 % support in metropolitan France , confirming its position as the third most important political force in France . It also showed that the party had become established enough to compete without its leader , who decided not to run to focus on the 2002 presidential election . Although it won only one seat in the National Assembly ( Toulon ) , thanks to a good communication director , it advanced to the second round in 132 constituencies . The FN was arguably more influential now than it had been in 1986 with its 35 seats . While Bruno Mégret and Bruno Gollnisch , in an unusual display of dissent , favoured tactical cooperation with a weakened centre @-@ right following the left 's victory , Le Pen rejected any such compromise . In the tenth FN national congress in 1997 , Mégret stepped up his position in the party as its rising star and a potential leader following Le Pen . Le Pen however refused to designate Mégret as his successor @-@ elect , and instead made his wife Jany the leader of the FN list for the upcoming European election . 
 Mégret and his faction left the FN in January 1999 and founded the National Republican Movement ( MNR ) , effectively splitting the FN in half at most levels . Many of those who joined the new MNR had joined the FN in the mid @-@ 1980s , in part from the Nouvelle Droite , with a vision of building bridges to the parliamentary right . Many had also been particularly influential in <unk> the FN 's policies on immigration , identity and " national preference " , and , following the split , Le Pen denounced them as " extremist " and " racist " . Support for the parties was almost equal in the 1999 European election , as the FN polled its lowest national score since 1984 with just 5 @.@ 7 % , and the MNR won 3 @.@ 3 % . The effects of the split , and competition from more moderate nationalists , had left their combined support lower than the FN result in 1984 . 
 = = = 2002 presidential election = = = 
 For the 2002 presidential election , opinion polls had predicted a run @-@ off between incumbent President Chirac and PS candidate Lionel Jospin . The shock was thus great when Le Pen unexpectedly beat Jospin ( by 0 @.@ 7 % ) in the first round . This resulted in the first presidential run @-@ off since 1969 without a leftist candidate , and the first ever with a candidate of the far @-@ right . To Le Pen 's advantage , the election campaign had increasingly focused on law and order issues , helped by media attention on a number of violent incidents . Jospin had also been weakened due to the competition between an exceptional number of leftist parties . Nevertheless , Chirac did not even have to campaign in the second round , as widespread anti @-@ Le Pen protests from the media and public opinion culminated on May Day , with an estimated 1 @.@ 5 million demonstrators across France . Chirac also refused to debate with Le Pen , and the traditional televised debate was cancelled . In the end , Chirac won the presidential run @-@ off with an unprecedented 82 @.@ 2 % of the vote and with 71 % of his votes — according to polls — cast simply " to block Le Pen " . Following the presidential election , the main centre @-@ right parties merged to form the broad @-@ based Union for a Popular Movement ( UMP ) . The FN failed to hold on to Le Pen 's support for the 2002 legislative elections , in which it got 11 @.@ 3 % of the vote . It nevertheless outpolled Mégret 's MNR , which won a mere 1 @.@ 1 % support , even though it had fielded the same number of candidates . 
 = = = Late 2000s decline = = = 
 A new electoral system of two @-@ round voting had been introduced for the 2004 regional elections , in part in an attempt to reduce the FN 's influence in regional councils . The FN won 15 @.@ 1 % of the vote in metropolitan France , almost the same as in 1998 , but its number of councillors was almost halved due to the new electoral system . For the 2004 European elections too , a new system less favourable to the FN had been introduced . The party regained some of its strength from 1999 , earning 9 @.@ 8 % of the vote and seven seats . 
 For the 2007 presidential election , Le Pen and Mégret agreed to join forces . Le Pen came fourth in the election with 11 % of the vote , and the party won no seats in the legislative election of the same year . The party 's 4 @.@ 3 % support was the lowest score since the 1981 election and only one candidate , Marine Le Pen in Pas de Calais , reached the runoff ( where she was defeated by the Socialist incumbent ) . These electoral defeats partly accounted for the party 's financial problems . Le Pen announced the sale of the FN headquarters in Saint @-@ Cloud , Le <unk> , and of his personal armoured car . Twenty permanent employees of the FN were also dismissed in 2008 . In the 2010 regional elections the FN appeared to have re @-@ emerged on the political scene after surprisingly winning almost 12 % of the overall vote and 118 seats . 
 = = = Marine Le Pen ( 2011 – present ) = = = 
 Jean @-@ Marie Le Pen announced in September 2008 that he would retire as FN president in 2010 . Le Pen 's daughter Marine Le Pen and FN executive vice @-@ president Bruno Gollnisch campaigned for the presidency to succeed Le Pen , with Marine 's candidacy backed by her father . On 15 January 2011 , it was announced that Marine Le Pen had received the two @-@ thirds vote needed to become the new leader of the FN . She sought to transform the FN into a mainstream party by softening its xenophobic image . Opinion polls showed the party 's popularity increase under Marine Le Pen , and in the 2011 cantonal elections the party won 15 % of the overall vote ( up from 4 @.@ 5 % in 2008 ) . However , due to the French electoral system , the party only won 2 of the 2 @,@ 026 seats up for election . 
 For the 2012 presidential election , opinion polls showed Marine Le Pen as a serious challenger , with a few polls even suggesting that she could win the first round of the election . In the event , Le Pen came third in the first round , scoring 17 @.@ 9 % – the best showing ever for the FN . 
 In the 2012 legislative election , the National Front won two seats ; Gilbert Collard and Marion Maréchal @-@ Le Pen . 
 In two polls about presidential favourites in April and May 2013 , Marine le Pen polled ahead of president François Hollande but behind Nicolas Sarkozy .

Following the municipal elections , the National Front has , in cities of over 1 @,@ 000 inhabitants , 1 @,@ 546 and 459 councilors at two different levels of local government . The international media described the results as " historic " , and " impressive " , although the International Business Times suggested that " hopes for real political power remain a fantasy " for the National Front . 
 The National Front received 4 @,@ 712 @,@ 461 votes in the 2014 European Parliament election , finishing first with 24 @.@ 86 % of the vote and 24 of France 's 74 seats . " It was the first time the anti @-@ immigrant , anti @-@ EU party had won a nationwide election in its four @-@ decade history . " The party 's success came as a shock in France and the EU . The next year , the National Front went on to win another victory in the first round of the 2015 regional elections on December 6 , placing first in 6 of the 13 newly redrawn regions and emerging ahead of both major establishment parties overall . In Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais @-@ Picardie , Marine Le Pen won 40 @.@ 6 % of the vote . 
 = = Political profile = = 
 The party 's ideology has been broadly described by scholars such as Shields as authoritarian , nationalist , and populist The FN has changed considerably since its foundation , as it has pursued the principles of modernisation and pragmatism , adapting to the changing political climate . At the same time , its message has increasingly influenced mainstream political parties , although the FN too has moved somewhat closer towards the centre @-@ right . While some have denounced its policies as " fascist " , some features that are integral to historical ( and generic ) fascism are absent in the party and others are prominent . 
 = = = Law and order = = = 
 In 2002 , Jean @-@ Marie Le Pen campaigned on a law @-@ and @-@ order platform of zero tolerance , harsher sentencing , increased prison capacity , and a referendum on re @-@ introducing the death penalty . In its 2001 program , the party linked the breakdown of law and order to immigration , deeming immigration a " mortal threat to civil peace in France . " 
 = = = Immigration = = = 
 In the early years of the FN , immigration policy was only a minor issue for the party , although it did call for immigration to be reduced . Themes of exclusion of non @-@ European immigrants was largely brought into the party in 1978 , with the arrival of Jean @-@ Pierre Stirbois and his " <unk> " group . The topic subsequently became increasingly important in the early 1980s . 
 In more recent popular and even academic press , the party 's program has often been reduced to the single issue of immigration . The party opposes immigration , particularly Muslim immigration from North Africa , West Africa and the Middle East . Over the years , and especially since the 1999 split , the FN has cultivated a more moderate image on issues of immigration and Islam , at least compared to some of the proposals of Mégret 's MNR or Philippe de Villiers 's Movement for France . It no longer expressly supports the systematic repatriation of legal immigrants , although it supports Islamophobic activities as well as the deportation of illegal , criminal , or unemployed immigrants . 
 Since becoming leader of the party in 2011 , Marine Le Pen has focused mostly on the perceived threat against the secular value system of the French Republic . She has criticised Muslims , for what she perceives as their alleged intents to impose their own values on the country . Following the Arab Spring rebellions in several countries , she has been active in campaigning on halting the migration to Europe of Tunisian and Libyan immigrants . 
 = = = Economy = = = 
 At the end of the 1970s , Le Pen refurbished his party 's appeal , by breaking away from the <unk> heritage of <unk> . He instead made an unambiguous commitment to popular capitalism , and started espousing an extremely market liberal and <unk> program . Issues included lower taxes , reducing state intervention , and dissolving the bureaucracy . Some scholars have even considered that the FN 's 1978 program may be regarded as " <unk> before Reagan " . 
 The party 's economic policy shifted from the 1980s to the 1990s from neoliberalism to protectionism . This should be seen within the framework of a changed international environment , from a battle between the Free World and communism , to one between nationalism and globalization . During the 1980s , Jean @-@ Marie Le Pen complained about the rising number of " social parasites " , and called for deregulation , tax cuts , and the phasing @-@ out of the welfare state . As the party gained growing support from the economically vulnerable , it converted towards politics of social welfare and economic protectionism . This was part of its shift away from its former claim of being the " social , popular and national right " to its claim of being " neither right nor left – French ! " Increasingly , the party 's program became an amalgam of free market and <unk> policies , which some political commentators have claimed are left @-@ wing economic policies . 
 Under her leadership , Marine Le Pen has been more clear in her support for protectionism , while she has criticised globalism and capitalism for certain industries . She has been characterised as a proponent of letting the government take care of health , education , transportation , banking and energy . 
 = = = Foreign policy = = = 
 From the 1980s to the 1990s , the party 's policy shifted from favouring the European Union to turning against it . In 2002 , Jean @-@ Marie Le Pen campaigned on pulling France out of the EU and re @-@ introducing the franc as national currency . In the early 2000s the party denounced the Schengen , Maastricht , and Amsterdam treaties as foundations for " a supranational entity spelling the end of France . " In 2004 , the party criticised the EU as " the last stage on the road to world government " , likening it to a " puppet of the New World Order . " It also proposed breaking all institutional ties back to the Treaty of Rome , while it returned to supporting a common European currency to rival the United States dollar . Further , it rejected the possible accession of Turkey to the EU . The FN was also one of several parties that backed France 's 2005 rejection of the Treaty for a European Constitution . In other issues , Le Pen opposed the invasions of Iraq , led by the United States , both in the 1991 Gulf War and the 2003 Iraq War . He visited Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in 1990 , and subsequently considered him a friend . 
 Marine Le Pen has advocated that France should leave the euro ( along with Spain , Greece and Portugal ) . She also wants to reintroduce customs borders and has campaigned against allowing dual citizenship . During both the 2010 – 2011 Ivorian crisis and the 2011 Libyan civil war , she opposed the French military involvements . She has recast the party 's image towards Israel , after affirming Israel 's right to secure itself from terrorism , and criticising the leadership of Iran . 
 = = = = Russia and Ukraine = = = = 
 Marine Le Pen described Russian President Vladimir Putin as a " defender of the Christian heritage of European civilisation . " The National Front considers that Ukraine has been subjugated by the United States , through the Ukrainian crisis . The National Front denounces anti @-@ Russian feelings in Eastern Europe and the submission of Western Europe to NATO 's interests in the region . Marine Le Pen is very critical against the threats of sanctions directed by the international community against Russia : " European countries should seek a solution through diplomacy rather than making threats that could lead to an escalation . " She argues that the United States are leading a new Cold War against Russia . She sees no other solution for peace in Ukraine than to organize a kind of federation that would allow each region to have a large degree of autonomy . She thinks Ukraine should be sovereign and free as any other nations . 
 Luke Harding wrote in The Guardian that the National Front 's MEPs were a " pro @-@ Russian bloc . " In 2014 , the Nouvel Observateur said that the Russian government considered the National Front " capable of seizing power in France and changing the course of European history in Moscow 's favour . " According to the French media , party leaders had frequent contact with Russian ambassador Alexander Orlov and Marine Le Pen made multiple trips to Moscow . In May 2015 , one of her advisers , Emmanuel Leroy , attended an event in Donetsk marking the " independence " of the self @-@ proclaimed Donetsk People 's Republic . 
 = = = = = Russian bank loan = = = = = 
 In November 2014 , Marine Le Pen confirmed that the party had received a € 9 million loan from the First Czech Russian Bank ( <unk> ) in Moscow to the National Front . Senior FN officials from the party 's political bureau informed <unk> that this was the first installment of a € 40 million loan , although Marine Le Pen has disputed this . The Independent said the loans " take Moscow 's attempt to influence the internal politics of the EU to a new level . " Reinhard <unk> stated , " It 's remarkable that a political party from the motherland of freedom can be funded by Putin 's sphere - the largest European enemy of freedom . " Marine Le Pen argued that it was not a donation from the Russian government but a loan from a private Russian bank because no other bank would give her a loan . This loan is meant to prepare future electoral campaigns and to be repaid progressively . Marine Le Pen has publicly disclosed all the rejection letters that French banks have sent to her concerning her loan requests . Since November 2014 , she insists that if a French bank agrees to give her a loan , she would break her contract with the <unk> , but she has not received any other counter @-@ propositions . Le Pen accused the banks of collusion with the current government In April 2015 , a Russian hacker group published texts and emails between Timur Prokopenko , a member of Putin 's administration , and Konstantin Rykov , a former Duma deputy with ties to France , discussing Russian financial support to the National Front in exchange for its support of Russia 's annexation of Crimea .

 In 2005 , Jean @-@ Marie Le Pen wrote in the far @-@ right weekly magazine <unk> that the German occupation of France " was not particularly inhumane , even if there were a few blunders , inevitable in a country of [ 220 @,@ 000 square miles ] " and in 1987 referred to the Nazi gas chambers as " a point of detail of the history of the Second World War . " He has repeated the latter claim several times . Also in 2004 , Bruno Gollnisch said " I do not question the existence of concentration camps but historians could discuss the number of deaths . As to the existence of gas chambers , it is up to historians to speak their minds " ( de se <unk> ) . Jean @-@ Marie Le Pen received fines for this sentence , Bruno Gollnisch was found not guilty by the courts of cassation . The current leader of the party , Marine Le Pen distanced herself for a time from the party machine in protest against her father 's comment . During the 2012 presidential elections , Marine Le Pen sought the support of Jewish people in France , as her father did in 1988 when he went to see the World Jewish Congress . 
 = = International relations = = 
 The FN has been part of several groups in the European Parliament . The first group it helped co @-@ establish was the European Right after the 1984 election , which also consisted of the Italian Social Movement ( MSI ) , its early inspiration , and the Greek National Political Union . Following the 1989 election , it teamed up with the German Republicans and the Belgian Vlaams Blok in a new European Right group , while the MSI left due to the Germans ' arrival . As the MSI evolved into the National Alliance , it chose to distance itself from the FN . From 1999 to 2001 , the FN was a member of the Technical Group of Independents . In 2007 , it was part of the short @-@ lived Identity , Tradition , Sovereignty group . Between the mentioned groups , the party sat among the non @-@ affiliated Non @-@ <unk> . Currently , it leads the Europe of Nations and Freedom group , which also includes the Freedom Party of Austria , Polish Congress of the New Right , Italian Northern League , Vlaams Belang , the German <unk> , the Dutch Freedom Party , a former member of the UK Independence Party and a former member of Romania 's Conservative Party . They 're also part of the Movement for a Europe of Nations and Freedom since 2014 . 
 During Jean @-@ Marie Le Pen 's presidency , the party has also been active in establishing extra @-@ parliamentary confederations . During the FN 's 1997 national congress , the FN established the loose <unk> group , which consisted of a variety of European right @-@ wing parties . Having failed to cooperate in the European Parliament , Le Pen sought in the mid @-@ 1990s to initiate contacts with other far @-@ right parties , including from non @-@ EU countries . The FN drew most support in Central and Eastern Europe , and Le Pen visited the Turkish Welfare Party . The significant Freedom Party of Austria ( FPÖ ) refused to join the efforts , as Jörg Haider sought to distance himself from Le Pen , and later attempted to build a separate group . In 2009 , the FN joined the Alliance of European National Movements , it left the alliance since . Along with some other European parties , the FN in 2010 visited Japan 's <unk> movement and the Yasukuni Shrine . 
 At a conference in 2011 , the two new leaders of the FN and the FPÖ , Marine Le Pen and Heinz @-@ Christian Strache , announced deeper cooperation between their parties . Pursuing her de @-@ demonization policy , Marine Le Pen as new president of the National Front joined the European Alliance for Freedom in October 2011 . A pan @-@ European sovereigntist platform founded late 2010 and recognized by the European Parliament . The EAF has individual members linked to the Austrian Freedom Party of Heinz @-@ Christian Strache , the British UK Independence Party of Nigel Farage , and other movements such as the Sweden Democrats , Vlaams Belang ( Belgian Flanders ) and from Malta , Germany ( Bürger in Wut ) , Slovakia ( Slovak National Party ) , etc . 
 During her visit to the United States , Marine Le Pen met two US Republican members of the U.S House of Representatives associated with the Tea Party movement , Joe Walsh , who is known for his strong Islamophobic stance , and three @-@ time presidential candidate Ron Paul , whom Le Pen complimented for his stance on the gold standard . 
 Apart from the party 's cooperations in the Europe of Nations and Freedom parliamentary group and its European party <unk> , the FN also cooperates with Giorgia Meloni 's Fratelli d 'Italia and Czech Republic 's SPD .

 The National Front was a marginal party from 1973 , the first election it participated in , until its breakthrough in the 1984 European elections , where it won 11 % of the vote and ten MEPs . Following this election , the party 's support mostly ranged from around 10 to 15 % , although it saw a drop to around 5 % in some late 2000s elections . Since 2010 , the party 's support seems to have increased towards its former heights . The party managed to advance to the final round of the presidential elections in 2002 , although it failed to attract much more support after the initial first round vote .

 Not My Life is a 2011 American independent documentary film about human trafficking and contemporary slavery . The film was written , produced , and directed by Robert Bilheimer , who had been asked to make the film by Antonio Maria Costa , executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime . Bilheimer planned Not My Life as the second installment in a trilogy , the first being A Closer Walk and the third being the unproduced Take Me Home . The title Not My Life came from a June 2009 interview with Molly Melching , founder of Tostan , who said that many people deny the reality of contemporary slavery because it is an uncomfortable truth , saying , " No , this is not my life . " 
 Filming of Not My Life took four years to complete , and documented human trafficking in 13 countries : Albania , Brazil , Cambodia , Egypt , Ghana , Guatemala , India , Italy , Nepal , Romania , Senegal , Uganda , and the United States . The first and last scenes of the film take place in Ghana , and show children who are forced to fish in Lake Volta for 14 hours a day . The film also depicts sex trafficking victims , some of whom are only five or six years old . 
 Fifty people are interviewed in the film , including investigative journalist Paul Radu of Bucharest , Katherine Chon of the Polaris Project , and Iana Matei of Reaching Out Romania . Don Brewster of Agape International Missions says that all of the girls they have rescued from child sex tourism in Cambodia identify Americans as the clients who were the most abusive to them . The film was dedicated to Richard Young , its cinematographer and co @-@ director , after he died in December 2010 . It had its premiere the following month at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City . The narration was completely rerecorded in 2011 , replacing Ashley Judd 's voice with that of Glenn Close . The version of the film that was aired by CNN International as part of the CNN Freedom Project was shorter than the version shown at the premiere . In 2014 , a re @-@ edited version of the film was released .

 Not My Life is a documentary film about human trafficking and contemporary slavery . It addresses many forms of slavery , including the military use of children in Uganda , involuntary servitude in the United States , unfree labor in Ghana , forced begging and garbage picking in India , sex trafficking in Europe and Southeast Asia , and other kinds of child abuse . The focus of the film is on trafficking victims , especially women and children , the latter of whom are often betrayed by adults that they trust . The film also focuses on the people and organizations engaged in working against human trafficking , including members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , Free the Slaves , Girls Educational and Mentoring Services ( GEMS ) , International Justice Mission ( IJM ) , the Somaly Mam Foundation , Terre des hommes , Tostan , UNICEF , United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) , and the United States Department of State ( US DoS ) . Not My Life has been called " a cautionary tale " . It depicts the commodification of millions of people and identifies the practices of traffickers as undermining international economics , security , sustainability and health . 
 Not My Life calls attention to the fact that , in the United States , the sentencing for human trafficking is less severe than for drug trafficking . The film indicates a relationship between contemporary slavery and globalization . It asserts that most human trafficking victims are children , although the filmmakers have recognized the fact that millions of adults are also trafficked . The film depicts human trafficking as a matter of good and evil , provides interviews with survivors of human trafficking , and presents analysis from anti @-@ trafficking advocates . Throughout the film , Robert Bilheimer encourages viewers to personally combat human trafficking . Bilheimer was sparing in his use of statistics in the film , feeling that overloading viewers with figures might numb them to the issues . 
 According to Nancy Keefe Rhodes of Stone Canoe , a U.S. literary journal , the film 's audiences are likely to have the preconception that human trafficking is not slavery in the same sense that the Atlantic slave trade was , and many people believe that slavery was abolished a long time ago with such instruments as the U.S. Emancipation Proclamation and Thirteenth Amendment . Rhodes writes that society now uses the word " slavery " in modern contexts only as a metaphor , so that references to actual contemporary slavery can be dismissed as hyperbole , and she describes the film 's goal as to " reclaim the original term [ slavery ] and convince us that what is happening now is what happened then : highly organized and pervasive , intentional , highly profitable and ... fully as coercive and wantonly cruel . " Rhodes says that the word " slavery " has started to be used in its original sense again in recent years , but that audiences ' views on contemporary slavery are nonetheless influenced by the slave @-@ like imagery in such films as Hustle & Flow ( 2005 ) and Black Snake Moan ( 2007 ) . The Academy Award @-@ winning Hustle & Flow portrays a pimp as the hero , while Black Snake Moan features Christina Ricci as a young nymphomaniac ; the marketing for Black Snake Moan centered on evocative , sexualized slave imagery , including a scantily @-@ clad Ricci in chains . According to Rhodes , Bilheimer " rescue [ s ] modern slaves from representation as exotic creatures , to restore their humanity " and allow audiences to relate to them . For this purpose , Bilheimer tells stories of individuals in the context of their communities and families . While Bilheimer had previously done extensive social justice work with religious organizations , he did not proselytize in the film , despite the many opportunities the film afforded him to do so .

 Fifty people are interviewed in Not My Life , including Katherine Chon of the Polaris Project , investigative journalist Paul Radu of Bucharest , Vincent <unk> of Terre des hommes , Iana Matei of Reaching Out Romania , UNICEF Director of Programmes Nicholas <unk> , Susan Bissell of UNICEF 's Child Protection Section , Antonio Maria Costa of UNODC , Somaly Mam of the Somaly Mam Foundation , Molly Melching of Tostan in Senegal , and Suzanne Mubarak , who was First Lady of Egypt at the time . The sex trafficking victims shown in the film include children as young as five and six years old . 
 Not My Life begins with a black screen on which the words " Human trafficking is slavery " appear in white . A sequence filmed in Ghana follows , showing children who are forced to fish in Lake Volta for 14 hours a day . Many of the children die as a result of the working conditions . A 10 @-@ year @-@ old boy swims through the murky water towards the camera , looking into it , and holds his breath underwater while trying to <unk> a fishing net . Next , Senegalese <unk> , Muslim boys who attend Quranic schools , appear . There are approximately 50 @,@ 000 <unk> in Senegal who are forced to beg on the streets to make money for their teachers ; children who do not meet their quotas are beaten . Many of these children suffer from skin and stomach diseases because of their diet of spoiled food — one demonstrates his diseased hands to the camera , only for an adult to pull him away by the ear . The film then moves to India and depicts children , mostly wearing flip @-@ flops , illegally sorting through hazardous waste in Ghazipur and New Delhi landfills . Romani families are shown in Central and Eastern Europe , and the narration indicates that Romani boys are often trafficked for the purpose of forced child begging , and that Romani girls are regularly trafficked as child prostitutes . The narrator says that the profits of human trafficking " are built on the backs and in the beds of our planet 's youth . " 
 In <unk> Prison in Romania , there are interviews with traffickers serving prison sentences that the film suggested were too short in light of the severity of the crime of human trafficking . The typical sentence for this crime is six or seven years , while the sentence for trafficking in drugs is normally twenty years . Two Romanian traffickers , Traian and Ovidiu , attest to having starved , punched , and kicked the girls they trafficked . Ovidiu recounts a story , in an interview filmed in February 2007 , about kidnapping a prostitute and selling her for sex when he was 14 . He expresses no remorse for these actions . The sentences served by Traian and Ovidiu were short enough that , by the time the film was released , they were no longer in prison . Ana , a girl they trafficked , is also interviewed in the film , saying that she lost a tooth in one of her beatings . She describes being pregnant at the time , but not telling this to her captors because of fears for the unborn child 's safety . 
 Radu is interviewed in this portion of the film , as is <unk> , who speaks about his experiences in Albania , where he heard about the sex trafficking of girls and how some of the girls would be shot or burned to death as a warning to the other girls . He describes how Albanian girls are often rounded up to be sexually trafficked in Italy . He further explains that , normally , before they leave Albania , the traffickers kill one of the girls in front of the others — usually by burning or shooting — to demonstrate what will happen to others who try to escape . Matei adds that , for the sake of amusement , some of the girls would be buried alive with only their heads remaining above ground . Eugenia Bonetti , a nun , speaks about her work helping girls escape from slavery in Italy . 
 Another interview is with a Wichita , Kansas woman named Angie who was prostituted with another girl , Melissa , in the American Midwest when they were teenagers . Angie recounts how they were expected to have sex with truck drivers and steal their money . She describes an incident when , after Melissa found pictures of a man 's grandchildren in his wallet , they realized he was old enough to be their own grandfather . " I wanted to die , " she says , close to tears . Outside the film , Bilheimer said that Angie 's trafficker expected her to engage in forty sex acts a night , and threatened to kill her if she refused . " It 's not just truck drivers , " FBI agent Mike Beaver says . " We 're seeing them purchased and abused by both white collar and blue collar individuals . " This statement segues into a Washington , D.C. , scene wherein two girls in their early teens are shown by a curb on K Street , changing into prostitutes ' attire . 
 Angie was rescued during Operation Stormy Nights , an anti @-@ human @-@ trafficking operation carried out by the FBI , in 2004 . Bilheimer said that , while there is no way of being certain how many girls like Angie are being sexually trafficked in the U.S. , " diligent people out there have arrived at a bare minimum figure of ... one hundred thousand girls , eight to fifteen [ performing ] ten sex acts a day " adding up to " a billion unpunished crimes of sexual violence on an annual basis . " 
 Another American victim of sexual trafficking , Sheila White , describes an incident in 2003 when she was beaten up next to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . She says that nobody even asked her if she needed help . White eventually escaped from being trafficked and went on to work with GEMS to raise awareness on the issue in New York . In 2012 , after the film was released , Barack Obama , President of the United States , recognized White 's work and told her story during a speech to the Clinton Global Initiative . 
 The next scenes in the film depict child labour in Nepal , and indicate that child workers in the textile industry are commonly targeted by sex traffickers . A brothel raid in India , led by Balkrishna Acharya of the Rescue Foundation in Mumbai , is then shown . Ten young girls are rescued from a four @-@ by @-@ three @-@ foot closet and a crawl space . The madam reacts furiously , perceiving the raid as taking away her livelihood . Then , the trafficking of children into the sex industry is depicted in Cambodia . Some scenes take place in Svay Pak , Phnom Penh , one of the cheapest sex tourism destinations in the Mekong Delta . Women of the Somaly Mam Foundation are depicted working with girls who have been sexually trafficked . A large number of these girls are pictured one by one , each child fading into the next against the backdrop of a doorway . An interview with one of the Somaly Mam Foundation workers , <unk> <unk> , reveals that her daughter , Sokny , was kidnapped in 2008 at age 23 . " Most likely Sokny too was sold , " <unk> says , claiming that " the police treated it like she wasn 't important " — perhaps , she suggests , because Sokny was an adopted child . Don Brewster of Agape International Missions is interviewed , and says that all of the girls they have rescued from child sex tourism in Cambodia identify Americans as the clients who were the most abusive to them . Bilheimer agreed with this assertion in an interview outside the film . 
 In Guatemala City , Guatemalan trafficker Efrain Ortiz is shown being arrested , and the film indicates that he was later given a prison sentence of 95 years . Ortiz had two sons he had been using for waste collection and five daughters he had been committing incest with . Bilheimer accompanies IJM representatives Pablo <unk> , Amy Roth , and Gary Haugen as they and the local police arrest Ortiz ; he is charged with exploitation of children and violence against women . Ortiz looks surprised as he is handcuffed . Haugen , President of IJM , went on to be named a Trafficking in Persons ( TIP ) Hero in the 2012 US DoS TIP Report . 
 Grace <unk> , a Ugandan woman who was once abducted by Joseph Kony to be used as a child soldier in the Lord 's Resistance Army ( LRA ) , is interviewed , saying that " this kind of evil must be stopped . " She was forced to kill another girl as part of her initiation into the LRA , a very common practice among armies that employ child soldiers . The film states that she was ultimately rehabilitated and became a mother . 
 Bishop Desmond Tutu , who Bilheimer had previously interviewed for The Cry of Reason , appears towards the end of the film , saying , " Each of us has the capacity to be a saint . " Bilheimer included Tutu in Not My Life because he felt that audiences might be in need of pastoral counseling after watching the film . The final scene of Not My Life returns to the boy holding his breath underwater in Ghana . His name is revealed to be <unk> , and it is stated that he and six other trafficking victims shown in the film have been rescued . Some of the last words in the film are spoken by Brazilian human rights advocate Leo <unk> : " I can 't see a good life while there are people living like animals . Not because I 'm a good person , not because it 's my duty , but because they are human — like me . "

 The project that became Not My Life was initiated by the executive director of the UNODC , Antonio Maria Costa , who wanted to commission a film that would " bring the issue of modern slavery to the attention of public opinion , globally — especially the well @-@ meaning , law @-@ abiding and God @-@ fearing people who do not believe something so horrible is happening in their own neighborhood . " With this goal in mind , Costa approached Worldwide Documentaries , an East Bloomfield , New York @-@ based organization that had produced two films with which he was familiar : The Cry of Reason , which documents internal resistance to South African apartheid by way of Beyers <unk> 's story ; and A Closer Walk , which is about the epidemiology of HIV / AIDS . Costa e @-@ mailed Bilheimer , Director of Worldwide Documentaries , asking him to create the film he envisioned . Costa said that he choose Bilheimer because the director had developed a " solid reputation [ for ] addressing difficult topics ... combining artistic talent , a philosophical view about development and a humanitarian sentiment about what to do about the issues . " 
 Bilheimer accepted Costa 's proposition , and subsequently wrote , produced , and directed Not My Life as an independent film . Bilheimer , who had received an Academy Award nomination for The Cry of Reason , said that " the unrelenting , unpunished , and craven exploitation of millions of human beings for labor , sex , and hundreds of sub @-@ categories thereof is simply the most appalling and damaging expression of so @-@ called human civilization we have ever seen . " Bilheimer 's wife , Heidi Ostertag , is Worldwide Documentaries ' Senior Producer , and she co @-@ produced Not My Life with him . She said that she found making a film about human trafficking difficult because " people do not want to talk about this issue . " Bilheimer found that the connections he had made during the production of A Closer Walk were also useful when producing Not My Life because the poor and the outcast are at the greatest risk of both HIV / AIDS and human trafficking ; there is , for this reason , much overlap between the groups victimized by these two afflictions . Bilheimer attempted to fashion the film in such a way that every part of it would illustrate a statement made by Abraham Lincoln : " If slavery is not wrong , nothing is wrong . " 
 When making this film , Bilheimer held that a contemporary abolitionist movement did not yet exist . He described his purpose in creating the film as to raise awareness and initiate such a movement . He also wished to communicate to his audiences that not all human trafficking is sexual . Traffickers " commit unspeakable , wanton acts of violence against their fellow human beings , " he said , " and are rarely punished for their crimes . " Production of Not My Life was supported by the United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking ( UN.GIFT ) , UNICEF , and UNODC , providing Worldwide Documentaries with $ 1 million in funding secured by Costa .

 Bilheimer said that the level of cruelty he saw in shooting Not My Life was greater than anything he had seen when documenting apartheid in South Africa for The Cry of Reason . Bilheimer attested to becoming more aware of the global extent of human trafficking as he went about making Not My Life . The film 's title came from a June 2009 interview with Molly Melching , founder of Tostan , an organization dedicated to human rights education operating in ten African countries . As Bilheimer and Melching spoke in <unk> , Senegal , discussing how people often deny the reality of contemporary slavery because it is an uncomfortable truth , Melching said , " People can say , ' No , this is not my life . ' But my life can change . Let 's change together . " 
 Filming of Not My Life took place over four years in Africa , Asia , Europe , and North and South America documenting human trafficking in thirteen countries : Albania , Brazil , Cambodia , Egypt , Ghana , Guatemala , India , Italy , Nepal , Romania , Senegal , Uganda , and the United States . Shooting in Ghana took place over four 18 @-@ hour days , during which the film crew had to travel over washboard roads in Land Rovers and did not sleep . Filming in Svay Pak took place in March 2010 , and shooting in Abusir , Egypt took place the following month . 
 In Guatemala , Bilheimer facilitated the arrest of trafficker Ortiz by renting a car for the police to use , in order to film the arrest as part of Not My Life . Bilheimer said that , during the making of the film , he and his crew were surprised to discover that traffickers employ similar methods of intimidation across the globe , " almost as if there were ... unwritten bylaws and tactics ... The lies are the same . "

 Susan Tedeschi , Derek Trucks , and Dave Brubeck performed the theme song for Not My Life , Bob Dylan 's " Lord Protect My Child " , which was produced by Chris Brubeck . After the initial screenings in early 2011 , the film went through a series of revisions , taking into account information gathered from more than thirty screenings for focus groups . Later that year , the narration was completely rerecorded ; Bilheimer replaced Ashley Judd 's voice with that of Glenn Close , who had previously worked with him on A Closer Walk . The version of the film that was aired by CNN International was shorter than the version shown at the premiere . An even shorter version , only 30 minutes long , was created with school audiences in mind . 
 Content relating to the Egyptian mixed @-@ sex schools instituted by Suzanne Mubarak was gathered , but Bilheimer eventually removed much of this content from the film because the Arab Spring made the information in this portion of the film outdated , despite the continued existence of most of these schools . Much of the interview with Molly Melching was removed as well . During the editing of Not My Life , Bilheimer cut the interview with Tutu , but later re @-@ added a single quotation . In this interview , Bilheimer told Tutu about meeting normally reasonable , compassionate women who , when speaking about human traffickers , say things like " Hang him up by his balls and then cut ' em off ! " Tutu , head of the truth and reconciliation commission , surprised Bilheimer with his response , saying that " these people have committed monstrous acts , " but that , according to Christianity , traffickers can still be redeemed and become saints . 
 As had occurred with Bilheimer 's previous film , A Closer Walk , Not My Life had several preview screenings before its official release . The United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) hosted a preview screening at the Willard InterContinental Washington in September 2009 as part of a day @-@ long symposium on human trafficking . A preview screening in Egypt , including the material shot in that country that was later removed , took place in December 2010 at the International Forum against Human Trafficking in Luxor . 
 Later that month , on December 15 , the film 's cinematographer and co @-@ director Richard Young died . Not My Life was subsequently dedicated to him . Bilheimer said that Young had believed in the film far more than he himself had . 
 = = Release = = 
 The film had its official premiere in Alice Tully Hall at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City on January 19 , 2011 . <unk> <unk> , United States Ambassador @-@ at @-@ Large for Global Women 's Issues , gave a speech , saying , " Each and every one of us is called to act . I hope that tonight each of us will make their own commitment . " Additional screenings were held in Los Angeles and Chicago later that month . That October , Not My Life had its international premiere in London . CNN International aired the film in two parts a few days later as part of the CNN Freedom Project . The Swedish premiere was attended by Crown Princess Victoria . Bilheimer recognized that people combatting human trafficking are in need of resources , so he considered various options with respect to the intellectual property of Not My Life , ultimately deciding to release the film at charge in addition to selling licenses for unlimited private screenings . On November 1 , an 83 @-@ minute version of the film was released on DVD by Worldwide Documentaries , which also began digitally distributing the film and selling the unlimited licenses . LexisNexis , the governments of Arizona and Minnesota , and the U.S. Fund for UNICEF all purchased licenses . The latter organization planned to use the film as part of an anti @-@ human @-@ trafficking campaign . 
 Not My Life was screened at the 2012 UNIS @-@ UN Conference in New York City , the theme of which was human exploitation . Segments from the film were included in " Can You Walk Away ? " , a 2012 exhibition on contemporary slavery at President Lincoln 's Cottage at the Soldiers ' Home in Washington , DC . A hotel chain presented the film to its staff in London in preparation for the 2012 Summer Olympics to raise awareness about the types of human trafficking that might take place in conjunction with the events . Bilheimer initiated an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign in 2012 to allow local organizations opposing human trafficking to screen the film . That same year , he expressed a willingness to release fifteen @-@ minute excerpts from the film to help its message reach more people . 
 In a 2012 interview , Bilheimer said that he considered A Closer Walk and Not My Life to be the first two installments in a trilogy ; he intended to make an environmental film called Take Me Home as the third installment . As of 2013 , however , the Worldwide Documentaries website stated that Bilheimer was considering different subjects for his next film , including poverty in the United States , the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake , and posttraumatic stress disorder among U.S. Army veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . Bilheimer said in 2013 that Not My Life " is not a perfect film by any means , but it is having an impact . " He said that he would like to be moving on to a new film project , but that he would continue promoting Not My Life because he thought it could help combat human trafficking . 
 Throughout 2013 , the World Affairs Councils of America hosted Not My Life screenings in a variety of cities across the United States , funded by the Carlson Family Foundation . That same year , the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency gave Worldwide Documentaries a grant to do anti @-@ human trafficking work over a three @-@ year period . Not My Life was screened at the Mexican film festival Oaxaca FilmFest in November 2012 ; <unk> in Warsaw , Poland , in May 2013 ; and the Pasadena International Film & New Media Festival in February 2014 . 
 In May 2014 , the Somaly Mam Foundation released a statement that Somaly had resigned from her leadership of the organization as a result of investigations regarding allegations about her personal history . The following month , Bilheimer released a statement in response , saying that he had re @-@ edited the film in order to remove the scenes depicting Somaly and that the new version would be available shortly . Bilheimer wrote that " the storytelling in the Cambodia segment of Not My Life remains intact and is still very moving , with an even sharper focus , now , on the girls themselves . " In this statement , Bilheimer requested that people screening previous versions of the film tell their audiences that the presence of Somaly in the film is understandably a distraction , that the film is not primarily about Somaly but rather about the millions of children in slavery in the world , and that this focus is what is most important about the film . 
 For the 2014 re @-@ release of the film , Bilheimer added new content relating to India , including an interview with Kailash Satyarthi , founder of the non @-@ governmental organization Bachpan Bachao Andolan which opposes child labor . This content emphasizes that there are more human trafficking victims in India than in any other country in the world . The new version of the film , which was co @-@ produced with the Delhi @-@ based <unk> Studios , was 56 minutes long and premiered at the India International Centre in New Delhi on June 26 . Satyarthi was one of the panelists in a panel discussion accompanying the screening , as was Indian filmmaker Mike Pandey , who had managed <unk> Studios ' side of the co @-@ production . The film was scheduled to air on Doordarshan ( DD ) in Hindi three days later . In July , Bilheimer called his continued work on the film " a labor of love " and said that " far too much silence still surrounds the issue " of human trafficking . 
 = = Reception = = 
 At the USAID preview screening , actress Lucy Liu , who has worked with MTV EXIT and produced the documentary film <unk> , said that people who watch Not My Life " will be shocked to find [ human trafficking ] is happening in America " ; she said that there were 80 @,@ 000 women being sexually assaulted daily and she called human trafficking the " cannibalization of the planet 's youth . " According to UN.GIFT , before Not My Life , there was " no single communication tool that effectively depict [ ed ] the problem as a whole for a mass audience . " Susan Bissell , UNICEF 's Child Protection Section chief , agreed with this assertion , and said that the film " takes a close look at the underlying causality that so many other filmmakers have missed [ and ] it will change the way we see our lives , in some very fundamental ways . " She also said that Not My Life is an important documentary because it brings attention to underreported forms of abuse . A reviewer from Medical News Today praised the film for " raising awareness and speaking about taboo subjects , " arguing that these activities " are critical to empower families , communities , and governments to speak out honestly and take action against abuses . " 
 Lucy Popescu of <unk> called the film " a powerful indictment of the global trade in human beings and the abuse of vulnerable people , " but criticized the film for focusing on human trafficking victims , arguing that the perpetrators should have been dealt with more prominently . She commended Bilheimer on the few interviews with traffickers that he did include , but she condemned as inadequate the " only passing reference to the thousands of men who engage in sexual tourism , like those who travel to Cambodia to ' buy ' traumatized children who they can then abuse for weeks at a time . " Popescu also called the film " simplistic " , arguing that it should have more clearly expressed that sex trafficking victims are not able to provide legitimate consent for sexual activity because they are afraid that their lives might be in danger if they do not comply . John Rash of the Star Tribune called the film " a cacophony of concerned voices speaking about a modern @-@ day scourge . " Rash praised the film for its global scope , but suggested that this geographical breadth allows American audiences to ignore the fact that the trafficking of children is prevalent in the United States and not just in other countries . 
 Not My Life was named Best World Documentary at the Harlem International Film Festival in September 2012 . Nancy Keefe Rhodes of Stone Canoe called it a " highly @-@ distilled ... remarkable film , " describing Bilheimer as " committed to strong story @-@ telling and film @-@ as @-@ craft . " She commends Bilheimer on alternating between American sequences and scenes in other countries , allowing " the experiences of young women with whom an American audience may more readily identify [ to ] become one among many woven into the fabric of global trafficking . " <unk> Sharan , Director General of DD , said that his organization was pleased to air the film and hoped that doing so would bring about greater awareness across India about human trafficking in the country . He called the film " both an eye @-@ opener and a profoundly moving call to action " .

 James William " Ike " Altgens ( / <unk> / ; April 28 , 1919 – December 12 , 1995 ) was an American photojournalist and field reporter for the Associated Press ( AP ) based in Dallas , Texas . Altgens began his career with the AP as a teenager and , following a stint with the United States Coast Guard , worked his way into a senior position with the AP Dallas bureau . 
 While on assignment for the AP on November 22 , 1963 , Altgens made two historic photographs during the assassination of President John F. Kennedy , including the image of Jacqueline Kennedy and Secret Service agent Clint Hill on the presidential limousine that would be reproduced on the front pages of newspapers around the world . Seconds earlier , Altgens made a photograph that became controversial , leading people in the United States and elsewhere to question whether accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald was visible in the doorway of the Texas School Book Depository as the gunshots were fired . 
 Altgens worked briefly as a film actor and model during his 40 @-@ year career with the AP , then did advertising work until he retired altogether . Both Altgens and his wife were in their seventies when they died in 1995 , at about the same time , in their Dallas home . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Dallas native Ike Altgens was orphaned as a child and raised by a widowed aunt . In 1938 , shortly after graduating from North Dallas High School , he was hired by the Associated Press . Altgens began his career at age 19 by doing odd jobs and writing the occasional sports story ; by 1940 , he had demonstrated an aptitude for photography and was assigned to work in the wirephoto office . 
 His career was interrupted when he served in the United States Coast Guard during World War II , though he was able to moonlight as a radio broadcaster . Following his return to Dallas , he married Clara B. Halliburton in July 1944 , and went back to work with the AP the following year . He also attended night classes at Southern Methodist University , earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in speech with a minor in journalism . 
 By 1959 , Altgens had found additional work as an actor and model in motion pictures , television and print advertising . Credited as James Altgens , he portrayed Secretary Lloyd Patterson in the low @-@ budget science fiction thriller Beyond the Time Barrier ( 1960 ) ; his role included the film 's final line of dialogue : " Gentlemen , we have got a lot to think about . " Altgens ' brief acting career also included a role as a witness in Free , White and 21 ( 1963 ) , and as a witness ( though not portraying himself ) in The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald ( 1964 ) . 
 Altgens photographed President Kennedy for the AP in 1961 at Perrin Air Force Base . Kennedy and former President Dwight D. Eisenhower were traveling to Bonham , Texas , in November to attend the funeral of Sam Rayburn , three @-@ time Speaker of the United States House of Representatives . Earlier that day , Altgens was the only photojournalist to climb up to the 29th floor of the Mercantile National Bank Building to report on the rescue of a young girl from a burning elevator .

 On November 22 , 1963 , Altgens was assigned to work in the Associated Press offices in Dallas as the photo editor . He asked instead to go to the railroad overcrossing where Elm , Main and Commerce Streets converge to photograph the motorcade that would take President Kennedy from Love Field to the Dallas Trade Mart , where Kennedy was to deliver an address . Since that was not originally his assignment , Altgens took his personal camera , a 35mm <unk> @-@ F single lens reflex camera with a 105mm telephoto lens , rather than the motor @-@ driven camera usually used for news events . " This meant that what I took , I had to make sure it was good — I didn 't have time for second chances . " 
 Altgens tried to find a good camera angle on the overcrossing , but was turned away by uniformed officers who said it was private property ; he moved to a location within Dealey Plaza instead . He made photographs of the motorcade on Main Street as it approached Houston Street , then got a close @-@ up as the presidential limousine turned right onto Houston . Afterwards , he ran across the grass toward the south curb along Elm Street , and stopped across from the Plaza 's north colonnade . As he snapped his first photograph from that spot , simultaneous to Zapruder film frame 255 , he heard a " burst of noise " , but did not recall having any reaction at that point since he thought the sound came from a firecracker . 
 = = = Witness to history = = = 
 Moments later , as Altgens prepared for a second photograph along Elm Street , he heard a blast that he recognized as gunfire and saw the President had been struck in the head . Altgens would later write that his camera was focused and ready , " but when JFK 's head exploded , sending substance in my direction , I virtually became paralyzed " and failed to press the trigger . " To have a President shot to death right in front of you and keep your cool and do what you 're supposed to do — I 'm not real sure that the most seasoned photographers would be able to do it . ... [ But ] there is no excuse for this . I should have made the picture that I was set up to make . And I didn 't do it . " 
 Altgens ' next photograph showed the First Lady with her hand on the vehicle 's trunk lid and Secret Service agent Clint Hill standing on the bumper behind her as the driver had begun to accelerate . Mrs. Kennedy testified the following June that " there were pictures later on of me climbing out the back . But I don 't remember that at all . " It was this photograph , reproduced on the front pages of newspapers around the world , that would lead Hill to write in his 2013 book that he " would forever be known as the Secret Service agent who jumped on the back of the car . " 
 After the gunshots ended , Altgens saw what he would later describe as " Secret Service men , uniformed policemen with drawn guns racing up this little incline " between Elm Street and the railroad tracks , and he crossed the street into the " utter confusion " to see if he could get a picture of someone in custody . When they came back without a suspect , Altgens hurried back to the AP offices in the Dallas Morning News building on Houston Street to file his report and have the film developed . His first phone call , from the AP wirephoto office to the news office , led to one of the first bulletins sent to the world : 
 <unk> , <unk> . 22 ( AP ) – PRESIDENT KENNEDY WAS SHOT TODAY <unk> AS HIS <unk> LEFT <unk> <unk> . <unk> KENNEDY <unk> UP AND <unk> MR. KENNEDY . <unk> <unk> , " OH , NO ! " THE <unk> <unk> ON . 
 Once his pictures had been distributed via the wirephoto network , Altgens was sent to Parkland Memorial Hospital along with a second photographer . Both stayed at Parkland until Kennedy 's body was taken by hearse to Air Force One at Love Field . 
 Altgens returned to Dealey Plaza to make photographs for <unk> the assassination site , then was sent to Dallas City Hall to retrieve some photos made by another AP photographer of Oswald in custody . This was " the first and only time " he would see the suspect , and Altgens thought Oswald looked like " they had put him through the interrogation wringer . " 
 = = = The man resembling Lee Harvey Oswald = = = 
 Ten days after Kennedy was assassinated , the Associated Press in Dallas reported that Altgens ' first photograph along Elm Street had captured the attention of people " here and abroad " who noticed that one of the men standing in the main doorway to the book depository looked like Lee Harvey Oswald . If true , " it would seem to prove that he was not the Kennedy assassin " because he would not have had time to get there from the sixth floor . The AP report quoted depository superintendent Roy Truly , who identified another employee , Billy Lovelady , as the man in the image . The report also noted that the FBI had already investigated the photograph and had also identified Lovelady . 
 On May 24 , 1964 , six months after the shooting , the New York Herald Tribune reported that Altgens — the man responsible for " probably the most controversial photograph of the decade " and one of a handful of people standing near the motorcade when Kennedy was shot — had not been questioned either by the FBI or by the Warren Commission . The next day , a column appearing in Chicago 's American made the same observation . FBI investigators interviewed Altgens eight days later , on June 2 , 1964 . By the time his testimony for the Warren Commission was taken on July 22 , Altgens was aware of the individual who resembled Oswald ; Lovelady had been interviewed for the Herald Tribune article , and Altgens testified that he too had been contacted but , because he had had no assignments involving any depository employees either before or since the assassination , " naturally I had no information " to share . 
 Several depository employees were interviewed for the Commission in an effort to determine the identity of the man in the depository doorway ; hearings included testimony from five people who said Lovelady was either sitting or standing on the entrance steps , and from three others ( including Lovelady ) who identified him in Altgens ' photograph . His supervisor signed an affidavit stating that Lovelady was sitting on the steps as the motorcade passed by . Ultimately , the Commission decided that Oswald was not in the doorway . 
 In 1978 , the House Select Committee on Assassinations studied several still and motion images , including an enhanced version of the Altgens photograph , in the scope of its investigation . The Committee also concluded that Lovelady was the man pictured in the depository doorway . 
 Fifty years after the photo was first published , the official conclusions were still being argued by academics and conspiracy theorists . Texas journalist Jim Marrs , who had previously noted that most researchers were " ready to concede that the man may have been Lovelady " , wrote in 2013 that there was a " growing resistance to this admission . " 
 = = = Recollections of a witness = = = 
 Two AP dispatches featuring Altgens were issued on November 22 , 1963 . He initially reported hearing two shots , but thought someone had been " shooting fireworks " . Altgens himself wrote , " At first I thought the shots came from the opposite side of the street . ... I did not know until later where the shots came from . I was on the opposite side of the President 's car from the gunman . He might have hit me . " Altgens said he was told by the AP 's Los Angeles photo editor that , had the shot gone " just a bit to the left ... you would have been the victim . " 
 In 1964 , testifying for the Warren Commission , Altgens was asked about the gunfire and whether he knew its source . He answered that he had not been keeping track of the number of gunshots fired in Dealey Plaza . " I mean , who counts fireworks explosions ? ... I could vouch for number one , and I can vouch for the last shot , but I cannot tell you how many shots were in between . " Kennedy 's wounds suggested to Altgens that the final shot " came from the opposite side , meaning in the direction of this depository building , but at no time did I know for certain where the shot came from . " 
 When CBS television interviewed him in 1967 , Altgens said it was obvious to him that the head shot came from behind Kennedy 's limousine " because it caused him to bolt forward , dislodging him from this depression in the seat cushion " . He added that the commotion across the street after the shooting " seemed rather strange ... because knowing that the shot came from behind , this fellow had to really move in order to get over into the knoll area . "

 District Attorney Jim Garrison subpoenaed Altgens to appear in New Orleans , Louisiana , for the 1969 trial of businessman Clay Shaw on charges of conspiring to kill Kennedy . A check for US $ 300 was sent to cover the airfare , but Altgens did not want to go ; he thought Garrison 's actions were " self @-@ aggrandizement . " 
 Altgens and former Texas Governor John Connally met by chance in Houston a short time later . Connally told Altgens that he too had been called to testify and sent money for airfare , but he decided to cash the check and spend the money . Connally suggested that Altgens do the same . Altgens later learned that neither he nor Connally would be called after all .

 Starting in 1984 , Altgens shared personal details and reminiscences in letters and telephone conversations for the book Pictures of the Pain : Photography and the Assassination of President Kennedy ( 1994 ) . Altgens had retired from the AP in 1979 after more than 40 years , rather than accept a transfer to a different bureau . He spent his later years working on display advertising for the Ford Motor Company and answering repeated requests for interviews made by assassination researchers . Though these researchers failed to convince him that the Warren Commission 's conclusion — that Oswald , acting alone , killed Kennedy — was wrong , he conceded that " there will always be some controversy about details surrounding the site and shooting of the president . "

 In November 1993 , Altgens took part in " Reporters Remember 11 @-@ 22 @-@ 63 " at Southern Methodist University in Dallas . Broadcast on C @-@ SPAN as Journalists Remember the JFK Assassination , the panel discussion featured members of the press who spoke of their experiences on the day 30 years earlier that JFK was killed . As he introduced Altgens , moderator Hugh Aynesworth recalled the picture that " became very controversial " because of the man " that looked like Oswald " . 
 Among his reminiscences , Altgens recalled having seen " no blood on the right @-@ hand side of [ Kennedy 's ] face ; there was no blood on the front of his face . But there was a tremendous amount of blood on the left @-@ hand side and at the back of the head . " That suggested to him , he continued , that if there was gunfire from any direction other than the rear , " there would be evidence in that particular area " . He also remembered , when seeing Jackie Kennedy on the trunk of the limousine , thinking that she " was scared out of her mind and she was looking for a way to escape . " 
 = = = No More Silence = = = 
 Altgens was one of 49 eyewitnesses interviewed for the 1998 book No More Silence : An Oral History of the Assassination of President Kennedy . He recalled having been contacted by Billy Lovelady , who wanted a copy of Altgens ' first photograph along Elm Street . Altgens was met by Lovelady 's wife , who told him her husband would never agree to be interviewed . The couple had moved several times , she explained , but still suffered break @-@ ins by people who wanted the shirt Lovelady wore when Kennedy was shot . 
 Altgens also recalled having told FBI agents that , had he been left alone on the overpass , he might have had better pictures for investigators . " By being up there , I would have been able to show the sniper . "

 On December 12 , 1995 , Ike and Clara Altgens were found dead in separate rooms in their home in Dallas . A Houston Chronicle article quoted a nephew , Dallas attorney Ron Grant , as saying his Aunt Clara " had been very ill for some time with heart trouble and many other problems . Both of them had had the flu for some time . " In addition , the Dallas Morning News said police were looking into the possibility that carbon monoxide poisoning from a faulty furnace played a role in their deaths . Altgens was survived by three nephews ; his wife by two sisters . 
 = Wind power = 
 Wind power is the use of air flow through wind turbines to mechanically power generators for electricity . Wind power , as an alternative to burning fossil fuels , is plentiful , renewable , widely distributed , clean , produces no greenhouse gas emissions during operation , uses no water , and uses little land . The net effects on the environment are far less problematic than those of <unk> power sources . 
 Wind farms consist of many individual wind turbines which are connected to the electric power transmission network . Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electricity , competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or gas plants . Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land , and offshore farms have less visual impact , but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher . Small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide electricity to isolated off @-@ grid locations . 
 Wind power gives variable power which is very consistent from year to year but which has significant variation over shorter time scales . It is therefore used in conjunction with other electric power sources to give a reliable supply . As the proportion of wind power in a region increases , a need to upgrade the grid , and a lowered ability to supplant conventional production can occur . Power management techniques such as having excess capacity , geographically distributed turbines , dispatchable backing sources , sufficient hydroelectric power , exporting and importing power to neighboring areas , using vehicle @-@ to @-@ grid strategies or reducing demand when wind production is low , can in many cases overcome these problems . In addition , weather forecasting permits the electricity network to be readied for the predictable variations in production that occur . 
 As of 2015 , Denmark generates 40 % of its electricity from wind , and at least 83 other countries around the world are using wind power to supply their electricity grids . In 2014 global wind power capacity expanded 16 % to 369 @,@ 553 MW . Yearly wind energy production is also growing rapidly and has reached around 4 % of worldwide electricity usage , 11 @.@ 4 % in the EU . 
 = = History = = 
 Wind power has been used as long as humans have put sails into the wind . For more than two millennia wind @-@ powered machines have ground grain and pumped water . Wind power was widely available and not confined to the banks of fast @-@ flowing streams , or later , requiring sources of fuel . Wind @-@ powered pumps drained the polders of the Netherlands , and in arid regions such as the American mid @-@ west or the Australian outback , wind pumps provided water for live stock and steam engines . 
 The first windmill used for the production of electricity was built in Scotland in July 1887 by Prof James Blyth of Anderson 's College , Glasgow ( the precursor of Strathclyde University ) . Blyth 's 10 m high , cloth @-@ sailed wind turbine was installed in the garden of his holiday cottage at <unk> in Kincardineshire and was used to charge accumulators developed by the Frenchman Camille Alphonse Faure , to power the lighting in the cottage , thus making it the first house in the world to have its electricity supplied by wind power . Blyth offered the surplus electricity to the people of <unk> for lighting the main street , however , they turned down the offer as they thought electricity was " the work of the devil . " Although he later built a wind turbine to supply emergency power to the local Lunatic Asylum , Infirmary and Dispensary of Montrose the invention never really caught on as the technology was not considered to be economically viable . 
 Across the Atlantic , in Cleveland , Ohio a larger and heavily engineered machine was designed and constructed in the winter of 1887 – 1888 by Charles F. Brush , this was built by his engineering company at his home and operated from 1886 until 1900 . The Brush wind turbine had a rotor 17 m ( 56 foot ) in diameter and was mounted on an 18 m ( 60 foot ) tower . Although large by today 's standards , the machine was only rated at 12 kW . The connected dynamo was used either to charge a bank of batteries or to operate up to 100 incandescent light bulbs , three arc lamps , and various motors in Brush 's laboratory . 
 With the development of electric power , wind power found new applications in lighting buildings remote from centrally @-@ generated power . Throughout the 20th century parallel paths developed small wind stations suitable for farms or residences , and larger utility @-@ scale wind generators that could be connected to electricity grids for remote use of power . Today wind powered generators operate in every size range between tiny stations for battery charging at isolated residences , up to near @-@ gigawatt sized offshore wind farms that provide electricity to national electrical networks . 
 = = Wind farms = = 
 A wind farm is a group of wind turbines in the same location used for production of electricity . A large wind farm may consist of several hundred individual wind turbines distributed over an extended area , but the land between the turbines may be used for agricultural or other purposes . For example , Gansu Wind Farm , the largest wind farm in the world , has several thousand turbines . A wind farm may also be located offshore . 
 Almost all large wind turbines have the same design — a horizontal axis wind turbine having an upwind rotor with three blades , attached to a nacelle on top of a tall tubular tower . 
 In a wind farm , individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage ( often 34 @.@ 5 kV ) , power collection system and communications network . In general , a distance of 7D ( 7 × Rotor Diameter of the Wind Turbine ) is set between each turbine in a fully developed wind farm . At a substation , this medium @-@ voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage electric power transmission system . 
 = = = Generator characteristics and stability = = = 
 Induction generators , which were often used for wind power projects in the 1980s and 1990s , require reactive power for excitation so substations used in wind @-@ power collection systems include substantial capacitor banks for power factor correction . Different types of wind turbine generators behave differently during transmission grid disturbances , so extensive modelling of the dynamic electromechanical characteristics of a new wind farm is required by transmission system operators to ensure predictable stable behaviour during system faults . In particular , induction generators cannot support the system voltage during faults , unlike steam or hydro turbine @-@ driven synchronous generators . 
 Today these generators aren 't used any more in modern turbines . Instead today most turbines use variable speed generators combined with <unk> or full @-@ scale power converter between the turbine generator and the collector system , which generally have more desirable properties for grid interconnection and have Low voltage ride through @-@ capabilities . Modern concepts use either doubly fed machines with partial @-@ scale converters or squirrel @-@ cage induction generators or synchronous generators ( both permanently and electrically excited ) with full scale converters . 
 Transmission systems operators will supply a wind farm developer with a grid code to specify the requirements for interconnection to the transmission grid . This will include power factor , constancy of frequency and dynamic behaviour of the wind farm turbines during a system fault . 
 = = = Offshore wind power = = = 
 Offshore wind power refers to the construction of wind farms in large bodies of water to generate electricity . These installations can utilize the more frequent and powerful winds that are available in these locations and have less aesthetic impact on the landscape than land based projects . However , the construction and the maintenance costs are considerably higher . 
 Siemens and Vestas are the leading turbine suppliers for offshore wind power . <unk> Energy , Vattenfall and <unk> are the leading offshore operators . As of October 2010 , 3 @.@ 16 GW of offshore wind power capacity was operational , mainly in Northern Europe . According to <unk> Consult , more than 16 GW of additional capacity will be installed before the end of 2014 and the UK and Germany will become the two leading markets . Offshore wind power capacity is expected to reach a total of 75 GW worldwide by 2020 , with significant contributions from China and the US . 
 In 2012 , 1 @,@ 662 turbines at 55 offshore wind farms in 10 European countries produced 18 TWh , enough to power almost five million households . As of August 2013 the London Array in the United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 630 MW . This is followed by <unk> y <unk> ( 576 MW ) , also in the UK . 
 = = = Collection and transmission network = = = 
 In a wind farm , individual turbines are interconnected with a medium voltage ( usually 34 @.@ 5 kV ) power collection system and communications network . At a substation , this medium @-@ voltage electric current is increased in voltage with a transformer for connection to the high voltage electric power transmission system . 
 A transmission line is required to bring the generated power to ( often remote ) markets . For an off @-@ shore station this may require a submarine cable . Construction of a new high @-@ voltage line may be too costly for the wind resource alone , but wind sites may take advantage of lines installed for conventionally fueled generation . 
 One of the biggest current challenges to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms , usually in remote lowly populated states in the middle of the country due to availability of wind , to high load locations , usually on the coasts where population density is higher . The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy . As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase , as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased , making it harder to transport large loads over large distances . However , resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines . Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electricity rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates . A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on , but after an attempt to use this authority , the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so . Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity , largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards . These are important issues that need to be solved , as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity , wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together , in a process known as curtailment . While this leads to potential renewable generation left untapped , it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service . 
 = = Wind power capacity and production = = 
 Worldwide there are now over two hundred thousand wind turbines operating , with a total nameplate capacity of 432 @,@ 000 MW as of end 2015 . The European Union alone passed some 100 @,@ 000 MW nameplate capacity in September 2012 , while the United States surpassed 75 @,@ 000 MW in 2015 and China 's grid connected capacity passed 145 @,@ 000 MW in 2015 . 
 World wind generation capacity more than quadrupled between 2000 and 2006 , doubling about every three years . The United States pioneered wind farms and led the world in installed capacity in the 1980s and into the 1990s . In 1997 installed capacity in Germany surpassed the U.S. and led until once again overtaken by the U.S. in 2008 . China has been rapidly expanding its wind installations in the late 2000s and passed the U.S. in 2010 to become the world leader . As of 2011 , 83 countries around the world were using wind power on a commercial basis . 
 Wind power capacity has expanded rapidly to 336 GW in June 2014 , and wind energy production was around 4 % of total worldwide electricity usage , and growing rapidly . The actual amount of electricity that wind is able to generate is calculated by multiplying the nameplate capacity by the capacity factor , which varies according to equipment and location . Estimates of the capacity factors for wind installations are in the range of 35 % to 44 % . 
 Europe accounted for 48 % of the world total wind power generation capacity in 2009 . In 2010 , Spain became Europe 's leading producer of wind energy , achieving 42 @,@ 976 GWh . Germany held the top spot in Europe in terms of installed capacity , with a total of 27 @,@ 215 MW as of 31 December 2010 . In 2015 wind power constituted 15 @.@ 6 % of all installed power generation capacity in the EU and it generates around 11 @.@ 4 % of its power . 
 = = = Growth trends = = = 
 After setting new records in 2014 , the wind power industry surprised many observers with another record breaking year in 2015 , chalking up 22 % annual market growth and passing the 60 GW mark for the first time in a single year ; and this after having broken the 50 GW mark for the first time in 2014 . In 2015 , close to half of all new wind power was added outside of the traditional markets in Europe and North America . This was largely from new construction in China and India . Global Wind Energy Council ( <unk> ) figures show that 2015 recorded an increase of installed capacity of more than 63 GW , taking the total installed wind energy capacity to 432 @.@ 9 GW , up from 74 GW in 2006 . In terms of economic value , the wind energy sector has become one of the important players in the energy markets , with the total investments reaching US $ <unk> ( € <unk> ) , an increase of 4 % over 2014 . 
 Although the wind power industry was affected by the global financial crisis in 2009 and 2010 , <unk> predicts that the installed capacity of wind power will be 792 @.@ 1 GW by the end of 2020 and 4 @,@ 042 GW by end of 2050 . The increased commissioning of wind power is being accompanied by record low prices for forthcoming renewable electricity . In some cases , wind onshore is already the cheapest electricity generation option and costs are continuing to decline . The contracted prices for wind onshore for the next few years are now as low as 30 USD / MWh . 
 In the EU in 2015 , 44 % of all new generating capacity was wind power ; while in the same period net fossil fuel power capacity decreased . 
 = = = Capacity factor = = = 
 Since wind speed is not constant , a wind farm 's annual energy production is never as much as the sum of the generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year . The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor . Typical capacity factors are 15 – 50 % ; values at the upper end of the range are achieved in favourable sites and are due to wind turbine design improvements . 
 Online data is available for some locations , and the capacity factor can be calculated from the yearly output . For example , the German nationwide average wind power capacity factor over all of 2012 was just under 17 @.@ 5 % ( <unk> GW · h / yr / ( 29 @.@ 9 GW × 24 × 366 ) = 0 @.@ 1746 ) , and the capacity factor for Scottish wind farms averaged 24 % between 2008 and 2010 . 
 Unlike fueled generating plants , the capacity factor is affected by several parameters , including the variability of the wind at the site and the size of the generator relative to the turbine 's swept area . A small generator would be cheaper and achieve a higher capacity factor but would produce less electricity ( and thus less profit ) in high winds . Conversely , a large generator would cost more but generate little extra power and , depending on the type , may stall out at low wind speed . Thus an optimum capacity factor of around 40 – 50 % would be aimed for . 
 A 2008 study released by the U.S. Department of Energy noted that the capacity factor of new wind installations was increasing as the technology improves , and projected further improvements for future capacity factors . In 2010 , the department estimated the capacity factor of new wind turbines in 2010 to be 45 % . The annual average capacity factor for wind generation in the US has varied between 29 @.@ 8 % and 34 @.@ 0 % during the period 2010 – 2015 . 
 = = = Penetration = = = 
 Wind energy penetration is the fraction of energy produced by wind compared with the total generation . There is no generally accepted maximum level of wind penetration . The limit for a particular grid will depend on the existing generating plants , pricing mechanisms , capacity for energy storage , demand management and other factors . An interconnected electricity grid will already include reserve generating and transmission capacity to allow for equipment failures . This reserve capacity can also serve to compensate for the varying power generation produced by wind stations . Studies have indicated that 20 % of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty . These studies have been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms , some degree of dispatchable energy or hydropower with storage capacity , demand management , and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electricity when needed . Beyond the 20 % level , there are few technical limits , but the economic implications become more significant . Electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large scale penetration of wind generation on system stability and economics . 
 A wind energy penetration figure can be specified for different durations of time , but is often quoted annually . To obtain 100 % from wind annually requires substantial long term storage or substantial interconnection to other systems which may already have substantial storage . On a monthly , weekly , daily , or hourly basis — or less — wind might supply as much as or more than 100 % of current use , with the rest stored or exported . Seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand . Such industry might include production of silicon , aluminum , steel , or of natural gas , and hydrogen , and using future long term storage to facilitate 100 % energy from variable renewable energy . Homes can also be programmed to accept extra electricity on demand , for example by remotely turning up water heater thermostats . 
 In Australia , the state of South Australia generates around half of the nation 's wind power capacity . By the end of 2011 wind power in South Australia , championed by Premier ( and Climate Change Minister ) Mike Rann , reached 26 % of the State 's electricity generation , edging out coal for the first time . At this stage South Australia , with only 7 @.@ 2 % of Australia 's population , had 54 % of Australia 's installed capacity . 
 = = = Variability = = = 
 Electricity generated from wind power can be highly variable at several different timescales : hourly , daily , or seasonally . Annual variation also exists , but is not as significant . Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability , this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system . <unk> and the non @-@ dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation , incremental operating reserve , and ( at high penetration levels ) could require an increase in the already existing energy demand management , load shedding , storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables . 
 Fluctuations in load and allowance for failure of large fossil @-@ fuel generating units require reserve capacity that can also compensate for variability of wind generation . 
 Wind power is variable , and during low wind periods it must be replaced by other power sources . Transmission networks presently cope with outages of other generation plants and daily changes in electrical demand , but the variability of intermittent power sources such as wind power , are unlike those of conventional power generation plants which , when scheduled to be operating , may be able to deliver their nameplate capacity around 95 % of the time . 
 Presently , grid systems with large wind penetration require a small increase in the frequency of usage of natural gas spinning reserve power plants to prevent a loss of electricity in the event that conditions are not favorable for power production from the wind . At lower wind power grid penetration , this is less of an issue . 
 GE has installed a prototype wind turbine with onboard battery similar to that of an electric car , equivalent of 1 minute of production . Despite the small capacity , it is enough to guarantee that power output complies with forecast for 15 minutes , as the battery is used to eliminate the difference rather than provide full output . The increased predictability can be used to take wind power penetration from 20 to 30 or 40 per cent . The battery cost can be retrieved by selling burst power on demand and reducing backup needs from gas plants . 
 A report on Denmark 's wind power noted that their wind power network provided less than 1 % of average demand on 54 days during the year 2002 . Wind power advocates argue that these periods of low wind can be dealt with by simply restarting existing power stations that have been held in readiness , or interlinking with HVDC . Electrical grids with slow @-@ responding thermal power plants and without ties to networks with hydroelectric generation may have to limit the use of wind power . According to a 2007 Stanford University study published in the Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology , interconnecting ten or more wind farms can allow an average of 33 % of the total energy produced ( i.e. about 8 % of total nameplate capacity ) to be used as reliable , baseload electric power which can be relied on to handle peak loads , as long as minimum criteria are met for wind speed and turbine height . 
 Conversely , on particularly windy days , even with penetration levels of 16 % , wind power generation can surpass all other electricity sources in a country . In Spain , in the early hours of 16 April 2012 wind power production reached the highest percentage of electricity production till then , at 60 @.@ 46 % of the total demand . In Denmark , which had power market penetration of 30 % in 2013 , over 90 hours , wind power generated 100 % of the country 's power , peaking at 122 % of the country 's demand at 2 am on 28 October . 
 A 2006 International Energy Agency forum presented costs for managing <unk> as a function of wind @-@ energy 's share of total capacity for several countries , as shown in the table on the right . Three reports on the wind variability in the UK issued in 2009 , generally agree that variability of wind needs to be taken into account , but it does not make the grid unmanageable . The additional costs , which are modest , can be quantified . 
 The combination of diversifying variable renewables by type and location , forecasting their variation , and integrating them with dispatchable renewables , flexible fueled generators , and demand response can create a power system that has the potential to meet power supply needs reliably . Integrating ever @-@ higher levels of renewables is being successfully demonstrated in the real world : 
 In 2009 , eight American and three European authorities , writing in the leading electrical engineers ' professional journal , didn 't find " a credible and firm technical limit to the amount of wind energy that can be accommodated by electricity grids " . In fact , not one of more than 200 international studies , nor official studies for the eastern and western U.S. regions , nor the International Energy Agency , has found major costs or technical barriers to reliably integrating up to 30 % variable renewable supplies into the grid , and in some studies much more . – Reinventing Fire 
 Solar power tends to be complementary to wind . On daily to weekly timescales , high pressure areas tend to bring clear skies and low surface winds , whereas low pressure areas tend to be windier and cloudier . On seasonal timescales , solar energy peaks in summer , whereas in many areas wind energy is lower in summer and higher in winter . Thus the <unk> of wind and solar power tend to cancel each other somewhat . In 2007 the Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot @-@ tested a combined power plant linking solar , wind , biogas and <unk> to provide load @-@ following power around the clock and throughout the year , entirely from renewable sources . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 Wind power forecasting methods are used , but predictability of any particular wind farm is low for short @-@ term operation . For any particular generator there is an 80 % chance that wind output will change less than 10 % in an hour and a 40 % chance that it will change 10 % or more in 5 hours . 
 However , studies by Graham Sinden ( 2009 ) suggest that , in practice , the variations in thousands of wind turbines , spread out over several different sites and wind regimes , are smoothed . As the distance between sites increases , the correlation between wind speeds measured at those sites , decreases . 
 Thus , while the output from a single turbine can vary greatly and rapidly as local wind speeds vary , as more turbines are connected over larger and larger areas the average power output becomes less variable and more predictable . 
 Wind power hardly ever suffers major technical failures , since failures of individual wind turbines have hardly any effect on overall power , so that the distributed wind power is reliable and predictable , whereas conventional generators , while far less variable , can suffer major unpredictable outages .

 Main article : Grid energy storage . See also : List of energy storage projects . 
 Typically , conventional hydroelectricity complements wind power very well . When the wind is blowing strongly , nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water . When the wind drops they can , provided they have the generation capacity , rapidly increase production to compensate . This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water . 
 Alternatively , where a suitable head of water is not available , pumped @-@ storage hydroelectricity or other forms of grid energy storage such as compressed air energy storage and thermal energy storage can store energy developed by high @-@ wind periods and release it when needed . The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level – low penetration requires daily storage , and high penetration requires both short and long term storage – as long as a month or more . Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods . The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage ; the cost of storage may add 25 % to the cost of any wind energy stored but it is not envisaged that this would apply to a large proportion of wind energy generated . For example , in the UK , the 1 @.@ 7 GW Dinorwig pumped @-@ storage plant evens out electrical demand peaks , and allows base @-@ load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently . Although pumped @-@ storage power systems are only about 75 % efficient , and have high installation costs , their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base @-@ load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs . 
 In particular geographic regions , peak wind speeds may not coincide with peak demand for electrical power . In the U.S. states of California and Texas , for example , hot days in summer may have low wind speed and high electrical demand due to the use of air conditioning . Some utilities subsidize the purchase of geothermal heat pumps by their customers , to reduce electricity demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70 % more efficient ; widespread adoption of this technology would better match electricity demand to wind availability in areas with hot summers and low summer winds . A possible future option may be to interconnect widely dispersed geographic areas with an HVDC " super grid " . In the U.S. it is estimated that to upgrade the transmission system to take in planned or potential renewables would cost at least $ 60 billion , while the society value of added <unk> would be more than that cost . 
 Germany has an installed capacity of wind and solar that can exceed daily demand , and has been exporting peak power to neighboring countries , with exports which amounted to some 14 @.@ 7 billion kilowatt hours in 2012 . A more practical solution is the installation of thirty days storage capacity able to supply 80 % of demand , which will become necessary when most of Europe 's energy is obtained from wind power and solar power . Just as the EU requires member countries to maintain 90 days strategic reserves of oil it can be expected that countries will provide electricity storage , instead of expecting to use their neighbors for net metering . 
 = = = Capacity credit , fuel savings and energy payback = = = 
 The capacity credit of wind is estimated by determining the capacity of conventional plants displaced by wind power , whilst maintaining the same degree of system security . According to the American Wind Energy Association , production of wind power in the United States in 2015 avoided consumption of 73 billion gallons of water and reduced CO2 emissions by 132 million metric tons , while providing $ 7 @.@ 3 billion in public health savings . 
 The energy needed to build a wind farm divided into the total output over its life , Energy Return on Energy Invested , of wind power varies but averages about 20 – 25 . Thus , the energy payback time is typically around one year . 
 = = Economics = = 
 Wind turbines reached grid parity ( the point at which the cost of wind power matches traditional sources ) in some areas of Europe in the mid @-@ 2000s , and in the US around the same time . Falling prices continue to drive the levelized cost down and it has been suggested that it has reached general grid parity in Europe in 2010 , and will reach the same point in the US around 2016 due to an expected reduction in capital costs of about 12 % . 
 = = = Electricity cost and trends = = = 
 Wind power is capital intensive , but has no fuel costs . The price of wind power is therefore much more stable than the volatile prices of fossil fuel sources . The marginal cost of wind energy once a station is constructed is usually less than 1 @-@ cent per kW · h . 
 However , the estimated average cost per unit of electricity must incorporate the cost of construction of the turbine and transmission facilities , borrowed funds , return to investors ( including cost of risk ) , estimated annual production , and other components , averaged over the projected useful life of the equipment , which may be in excess of twenty years . Energy cost estimates are highly dependent on these assumptions so published cost figures can differ substantially . In 2004 , wind energy cost a fifth of what it did in the 1980s , and some expected that downward trend to continue as larger multi @-@ megawatt turbines were mass @-@ produced . In 2012 capital costs for wind turbines were substantially lower than 2008 – 2010 but still above 2002 levels . A 2011 report from the American Wind Energy Association stated , " Wind 's costs have dropped over the past two years , in the range of 5 to 6 cents per kilowatt @-@ hour recently .... about 2 cents cheaper than coal @-@ fired electricity , and more projects were financed through debt arrangements than tax equity structures last year .... winning more mainstream acceptance from Wall Street 's banks .... Equipment makers can also deliver products in the same year that they are ordered instead of waiting up to three years as was the case in previous cycles .... 5 @,@ 600 MW of new installed capacity is under construction in the United States , more than double the number at this point in 2010 . Thirty @-@ five percent of all new power generation built in the United States since 2005 has come from wind , more than new gas and coal plants combined , as power providers are increasingly enticed to wind as a convenient hedge against unpredictable commodity price moves . " 
 A British Wind Energy Association report gives an average generation cost of onshore wind power of around 3 @.@ 2 pence ( between US 5 and 6 cents ) per kW · h ( 2005 ) . Cost per unit of energy produced was estimated in 2006 to be 5 to 6 percent above the cost of new generating capacity in the US for coal and natural gas : wind cost was estimated at $ 55 @.@ 80 per MW · h , coal at $ 53 @.@ 10 / MW · h and natural gas at $ 52 @.@ 50 . Similar comparative results with natural gas were obtained in a governmental study in the UK in 2011 . In 2011 power from wind turbines could be already cheaper than fossil or nuclear plants ; it is also expected that wind power will be the cheapest form of energy generation in the future . The presence of wind energy , even when subsidised , can reduce costs for consumers ( € 5 billion / yr in Germany ) by reducing the marginal price , by minimising the use of expensive peaking power plants . 
 An 2012 EU study shows base cost of onshore wind power similar to coal , when subsidies and externalities are disregarded . Wind power has some of the lowest external costs . 
 In February 2013 Bloomberg New Energy Finance ( BNEF ) reported that the cost of generating electricity from new wind farms is cheaper than new coal or new baseload gas plants . When including the current Australian federal government carbon pricing scheme their modeling gives costs ( in Australian dollars ) of $ 80 / MWh for new wind farms , $ 143 / MWh for new coal plants and $ 116 / MWh for new baseload gas plants . The modeling also shows that " even without a carbon price ( the most efficient way to reduce economy @-@ wide emissions ) wind energy is 14 % cheaper than new coal and 18 % cheaper than new gas . " Part of the higher costs for new coal plants is due to high financial lending costs because of " the <unk> damage of emissions @-@ intensive investments " . The expense of gas fired plants is partly due to " export market " effects on local prices . Costs of production from coal fired plants built in " the 1970s and 1980s " are cheaper than renewable energy sources because of depreciation . In 2015 BNEF calculated LCOE prices per MWh energy in new powerplants ( excluding carbon costs ) : $ 85 for onshore wind ( $ 175 for offshore ) , $ 66 – 75 for coal in the Americas ( $ 82 – 105 in Europe ) , gas $ 80 – 100 . A 2014 study showed <unk> LCOE costs between $ 37 – 81 , depending on region . A 2014 US DOE report showed that in some cases power purchase agreement prices for wind power had dropped to record lows of $ 23 @.@ 5 / MWh . 
 The cost has reduced as wind turbine technology has improved . There are now longer and lighter wind turbine blades , improvements in turbine performance and increased power generation efficiency . Also , wind project capital and maintenance costs have continued to decline . For example , the wind industry in the USA in early 2014 were able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades , capturing the faster winds at higher elevations . This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana , Michigan , and Ohio , the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 feet above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal . Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt @-@ hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio , saying it is their cheapest option . 
 A number of initiatives are working to reduce costs of electricity from offshore wind . One example is the Carbon Trust Offshore Wind Accelerator , a joint industry project , involving nine offshore wind developers , which aims to reduce the cost of offshore wind by 10 % by 2015 . It has been suggested that innovation at scale could deliver 25 % cost reduction in offshore wind by 2020 . Henrik <unk> , former Chief Technical Officer at Siemens Wind Power , has stated that by 2025 energy from offshore wind will be one of the cheapest , scalable solutions in the UK , compared to other renewables and fossil fuel energy sources , if the true cost to society is factored into the cost of energy equation . He calculates the cost at that time to be 43 EUR / MWh for onshore , and 72 EUR / MWh for offshore wind . 
 = = = Incentives and community benefits = = = 
 The U.S. wind industry generates tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity . Wind projects provide local taxes , or payments in lieu of taxes and strengthen the economy of rural communities by providing income to farmers with wind turbines on their land . Wind energy in many jurisdictions receives financial or other support to encourage its development . Wind energy benefits from subsidies in many jurisdictions , either to increase its attractiveness , or to compensate for subsidies received by other forms of production which have significant negative externalities . 
 In the US , wind power receives a production tax credit ( PTC ) of 1 @.@ 5 ¢ / kWh in 1993 dollars for each kW · h produced , for the first ten years ; at 2 @.@ 2 cents per kW · h in 2012 , the credit was renewed on 2 January 2012 , to include construction begun in 2013 . A 30 % tax credit can be applied instead of receiving the PTC . Another tax benefit is accelerated depreciation . Many American states also provide incentives , such as exemption from property tax , mandated purchases , and additional markets for " green credits " . The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 contains extensions of credits for wind , including <unk> . Countries such as Canada and Germany also provide incentives for wind turbine construction , such as tax credits or minimum purchase prices for wind generation , with assured grid access ( sometimes referred to as feed @-@ in tariffs ) . These feed @-@ in tariffs are typically set well above average electricity prices . In December 2013 U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander and other Republican senators argued that the " wind energy production tax credit should be allowed to expire at the end of 2013 " and it expired 1 January 2014 for new installations . 
 Secondary market forces also provide incentives for businesses to use wind @-@ generated power , even if there is a premium price for the electricity . For example , socially responsible manufacturers pay utility companies a premium that goes to subsidize and build new wind power infrastructure . Companies use wind @-@ generated power , and in return they can claim that they are undertaking strong " green " efforts . In the US the organization Green @-@ e monitors business compliance with these renewable energy credits . 
 = = Small @-@ scale wind power = = 
 Small @-@ scale wind power is the name given to wind generation systems with the capacity to produce up to 50 kW of electrical power . Isolated communities , that may otherwise rely on diesel generators , may use wind turbines as an alternative . Individuals may purchase these systems to reduce or eliminate their dependence on grid electricity for economic reasons , or to reduce their carbon footprint . Wind turbines have been used for household electricity generation in conjunction with battery storage over many decades in remote areas . 
 Recent examples of small @-@ scale wind power projects in an urban setting can be found in New York City , where , since 2009 , a number of building projects have capped their roofs with <unk> @-@ type helical wind turbines . Although the energy they generate is small compared to the buildings ' overall consumption , they help to reinforce the building 's ' green ' credentials in ways that " showing people your high @-@ tech boiler " can not , with some of the projects also receiving the direct support of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority . 
 Grid @-@ connected domestic wind turbines may use grid energy storage , thus replacing purchased electricity with locally produced power when available . The surplus power produced by domestic <unk> can , in some jurisdictions , be fed into the network and sold to the utility company , producing a retail credit for the <unk> ' owners to offset their energy costs . 
 Off @-@ grid system users can either adapt to intermittent power or use batteries , photovoltaic or diesel systems to supplement the wind turbine . Equipment such as parking meters , traffic warning signs , street lighting , or wireless Internet gateways may be powered by a small wind turbine , possibly combined with a photovoltaic system , that charges a small battery replacing the need for a connection to the power grid . 
 A Carbon Trust study into the potential of small @-@ scale wind energy in the UK , published in 2010 , found that small wind turbines could provide up to 1 @.@ 5 terawatt hours ( TW · h ) per year of electricity ( 0 @.@ 4 % of total UK electricity consumption ) , saving 0 @.@ 6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide ( Mt CO2 ) emission savings . This is based on the assumption that 10 % of households would install turbines at costs competitive with grid electricity , around 12 pence ( US 19 cents ) a kW · h . A report prepared for the UK 's government @-@ sponsored Energy Saving Trust in 2006 , found that home power generators of various kinds could provide 30 to 40 % of the country 's electricity needs by 2050 . 
 Distributed generation from renewable resources is increasing as a consequence of the increased awareness of climate change . The electronic interfaces required to connect renewable generation units with the utility system can include additional functions , such as the active filtering to enhance the power quality . 
 = = Environmental effects = = 
 The environmental impact of wind power when compared to the environmental impacts of fossil fuels , is relatively minor . According to the IPCC , in assessments of the life @-@ cycle global warming potential of energy sources , wind turbines have a median value of between 12 and 11 ( <unk> / kWh ) depending on whether off- or onshore turbines are being assessed . Compared with other low carbon power sources , wind turbines have some of the lowest global warming potential per unit of electrical energy generated . 
 While a wind farm may cover a large area of land , many land uses such as agriculture are compatible with it , as only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure are made unavailable for use . 
 There are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures . The scale of the ecological impact may or may not be significant , depending on specific circumstances . Prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities , and protection of peat bogs , affect the siting and operation of wind turbines . 
 Wind turbines generate some noise . At a residential distance of 300 metres ( 980 ft ) this may be around 45 dB , which is slightly louder than a refrigerator . At 1 @.@ 5 km ( 1 mi ) distance they become inaudible . There are anecdotal reports of negative health effects from noise on people who live very close to wind turbines . Peer @-@ reviewed research has generally not supported these claims . 
 Aesthetic aspects of wind turbines and resulting changes of the visual landscape are significant . Conflicts arise especially in scenic and heritage protected landscapes . 
 = = Politics = = 
 = = = Central government = = = 
 Nuclear power and fossil fuels are subsidized by many governments , and wind power and other forms of renewable energy are also often subsidized . For example , a 2009 study by the Environmental Law Institute assessed the size and structure of U.S. energy subsidies over the 2002 – 2008 period . The study estimated that subsidies to fossil @-@ fuel based sources amounted to approximately $ 72 billion over this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totalled $ 29 billion . In the United States , the federal government has paid US $ 74 billion for energy subsidies to support R & D for nuclear power ( $ 50 billion ) and fossil fuels ( $ 24 billion ) from 1973 to 2003 . During this same time frame , renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency received a total of US $ 26 billion . It has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help to level the playing field and support growing energy sectors , namely solar power , wind power , and biofuels . History shows that no energy sector was developed without subsidies . 
 According to the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) ( 2011 ) , energy subsidies artificially lower the price of energy paid by consumers , raise the price received by producers or lower the cost of production . " Fossil fuels subsidies costs generally outweigh the benefits . Subsidies to renewables and low @-@ carbon energy technologies can bring long @-@ term economic and environmental benefits " . In November 2011 , an IEA report entitled Deploying Renewables 2011 said " subsidies in green energy technologies that were not yet competitive are justified in order to give an incentive to investing into technologies with clear environmental and energy security benefits " . The IEA 's report disagreed with claims that renewable energy technologies are only viable through costly subsidies and not able to produce energy reliably to meet demand . 
 In the U.S. , the wind power industry has recently increased its lobbying efforts considerably , spending about $ 5 million in 2009 after years of relative obscurity in Washington . By comparison , the U.S. nuclear industry alone spent over $ 650 million on its lobbying efforts and campaign contributions during a single ten @-@ year period ending in 2008 . 
 Following the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents , Germany 's federal government is working on a new plan for increasing energy efficiency and renewable energy commercialization , with a particular focus on offshore wind farms . Under the plan , large wind turbines will be erected far away from the coastlines , where the wind blows more consistently than it does on land , and where the enormous turbines won 't bother the inhabitants . The plan aims to decrease Germany 's dependence on energy derived from coal and nuclear power plants . 
 = = = Public opinion = = = 
 Surveys of public attitudes across Europe and in many other countries show strong public support for wind power . About 80 % of EU citizens support wind power . In Germany , where wind power has gained very high social acceptance , hundreds of thousands of people have invested in citizens ' wind farms across the country and thousands of small and medium @-@ sized enterprises are running successful businesses in a new sector that in 2008 employed 90 @,@ 000 people and generated 8 % of Germany 's electricity . 
 Although wind power is a popular form of energy generation , the construction of wind farms is not universally welcomed , often for aesthetic reasons . 
 In Spain , with some exceptions , there has been little opposition to the installation of inland wind parks . However , the projects to build offshore parks have been more controversial . In particular , the proposal of building the biggest offshore wind power production facility in the world in southwestern Spain in the coast of Cádiz , on the spot of the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar has been met with strong opposition who fear for tourism and fisheries in the area , and because the area is a war grave . 
 In a survey conducted by Angus Reid Strategies in October 2007 , 89 per cent of respondents said that using renewable energy sources like wind or solar power was positive for Canada , because these sources were better for the environment . Only 4 per cent considered using renewable sources as negative since they can be unreliable and expensive . According to a Saint Consulting survey in April 2007 , wind power was the alternative energy source most likely to gain public support for future development in Canada , with only 16 % opposed to this type of energy . By contrast , 3 out of 4 Canadians opposed nuclear power developments . 
 A 2003 survey of residents living around Scotland 's 10 existing wind farms found high levels of community acceptance and strong support for wind power , with much support from those who lived closest to the wind farms . The results of this survey support those of an earlier Scottish Executive survey ' Public attitudes to the Environment in Scotland 2002 ' , which found that the Scottish public would prefer the majority of their electricity to come from renewables , and which rated wind power as the cleanest source of renewable energy . A survey conducted in 2005 showed that 74 % of people in Scotland agree that wind farms are necessary to meet current and future energy needs . When people were asked the same question in a Scottish renewables study conducted in 2010 , 78 % agreed . The increase is significant as there were twice as many wind farms in 2010 as there were in 2005 . The 2010 survey also showed that 52 % disagreed with the statement that wind farms are " ugly and a blot on the landscape " . 59 % agreed that wind farms were necessary and that how they looked was unimportant . Regarding tourism , query responders consider power pylons , cell phone towers , quarries and plantations more negatively than wind farms . Scotland is planning to obtain 100 % of electricity from renewable sources by 2020 . 
 In other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects . The hundreds of thousands of people who have become involved in Germany 's small and medium @-@ sized wind farms demonstrate such support there . 
 This 2010 Harris Poll reflects the strong support for wind power in Germany , other European countries , and the U.S. 
 = = = Community = = = 
 Many wind power companies work with local communities to reduce environmental and other concerns associated with particular wind farms . In other cases there is direct community ownership of wind farm projects . Appropriate government consultation , planning and approval procedures also help to minimize environmental risks . Some may still object to wind farms but , according to The Australia Institute , their concerns should be weighed against the need to address the threats posed by climate change and the opinions of the broader community . 
 In America , wind projects are reported to boost local tax bases , helping to pay for schools , roads and hospitals . Wind projects also revitalize the economy of rural communities by providing steady income to farmers and other landowners . 
 In the UK , both the National Trust and the Campaign to Protect Rural England have expressed concerns about the effects on the rural landscape caused by inappropriately sited wind turbines and wind farms . 
 Some wind farms have become tourist attractions . The <unk> Wind Farm Visitor Centre has an exhibition room , a learning hub , a café with a viewing deck and also a shop . It is run by the Glasgow Science Centre . 
 In Denmark , a loss @-@ of @-@ value scheme gives people the right to claim compensation for loss of value of their property if it is caused by proximity to a wind turbine . The loss must be at least 1 % of the property 's value . 
 Despite this general support for the concept of wind power in the public at large , local opposition often exists and has delayed or aborted a number of projects . For example , there are concerns that some installations can negatively affect TV and radio reception and Doppler weather radar , as well as produce excessive sound and vibration levels leading to a decrease in property values . Potential broadcast @-@ reception solutions include predictive interference modeling as a component of site selection . A study of 50 @,@ 000 home sales near wind turbines found no statistical evidence that prices were affected . 
 While aesthetic issues are subjective and some find wind farms pleasant and optimistic , or symbols of energy independence and local prosperity , protest groups are often formed to attempt to block new wind power sites for various reasons . 
 This type of opposition is often described as <unk> , but research carried out in 2009 found that there is little evidence to support the belief that residents only object to renewable power facilities such as wind turbines as a result of a " Not in my Back Yard " attitude . 
 = = Turbine design = = 
 Main articles : Wind turbine and Wind turbine design . See also : Wind turbine aerodynamics . 
 Wind turbines are devices that convert the wind 's kinetic energy into electrical power . The result of over a millennium of windmill development and modern engineering , today 's wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of horizontal axis and vertical axis types . The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power . Slightly larger turbines can be used for making small contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid . Arrays of large turbines , known as wind farms , have become an increasingly important source of renewable energy and are used in many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels . 
 Wind turbine design is the process of defining the form and specifications of a wind turbine to extract energy from the wind . A wind turbine installation consists of the necessary systems needed to capture the wind 's energy , point the turbine into the wind , convert mechanical rotation into electrical power , and other systems to start , stop , and control the turbine . 
 In 1919 the German physicist Albert Betz showed that for a hypothetical ideal wind @-@ energy extraction machine , the fundamental laws of conservation of mass and energy allowed no more than 16 / 27 ( 59 @.@ 3 % ) of the kinetic energy of the wind to be captured . This Betz limit can be approached in modern turbine designs , which may reach 70 to 80 % of the theoretical Betz limit . 
 The aerodynamics of a wind turbine are not straightforward . The air flow at the blades is not the same as the airflow far away from the turbine . The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine . In addition the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields . The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind , and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade . 
 In addition to the aerodynamic design of the blades , the design of a complete wind power system must also address the design of the installation 's rotor hub , nacelle , tower structure , generator , controls , and foundation . Further design factors must also be considered when integrating wind turbines into electrical power grids . 
 = = Wind energy = = 
 Wind energy is the kinetic energy of air in motion , also called wind . Total wind energy flowing through an imaginary surface with area A during the time t is : 
 <formula> 
 where ρ is the density of air ; v is the wind speed ; <unk> is the volume of air passing through A ( which is considered perpendicular to the direction of the wind ) ; <unk> is therefore the mass m passing through " A " . Note that ½ <unk> is the kinetic energy of the moving air per unit volume . 
 Power is energy per unit time , so the wind power incident on A ( e.g. equal to the rotor area of a wind turbine ) is : 
 <formula> 
 Wind power in an open air stream is thus proportional to the third power of the wind speed ; the available power increases eightfold when the wind speed doubles . Wind turbines for grid electricity therefore need to be especially efficient at greater wind speeds . 
 Wind is the movement of air across the surface of the Earth , affected by areas of high pressure and of low pressure . The global wind kinetic energy averaged approximately 1 @.@ 50 MJ / m2 over the period from 1979 to 2010 , 1 @.@ 31 MJ / m2 in the Northern Hemisphere with 1 @.@ 70 MJ / m2 in the Southern Hemisphere . The atmosphere acts as a thermal engine , absorbing heat at higher temperatures , releasing heat at lower temperatures . The process is responsible for production of wind kinetic energy at a rate of 2 @.@ 46 W / m2 sustaining thus the circulation of the atmosphere against frictional dissipation . A global 1 km2 map of wind resources is housed at http : / / <unk> / ? map = 103 , based on calculations by the Technical University of Denmark . 
 The total amount of economically extractable power available from the wind is considerably more than present human power use from all sources . Axel Kleidon of the Max Planck Institute in Germany , carried out a " top down " calculation on how much wind energy there is , starting with the incoming solar radiation that drives the winds by creating temperature differences in the atmosphere . He concluded that somewhere between 18 TW and 68 TW could be extracted . 
 Cristina Archer and Mark Z. Jacobson presented a " bottom @-@ up " estimate , which unlike Kleidon 's are based on actual measurements of wind speeds , and found that there is 1700 TW of wind power at an altitude of 100 metres over land and sea . Of this , " between 72 and 170 TW could be extracted in a practical and cost @-@ competitive manner " . They later estimated 80 TW . However research at Harvard University estimates 1 Watt / m2 on average and 2 – 10 MW / km2 capacity for large scale wind farms , suggesting that these estimates of total global wind resources are too high by a factor of about 4 . 
 The strength of wind varies , and an average value for a given location does not alone indicate the amount of energy a wind turbine could produce there . 
 To assess prospective wind power sites a probability distribution function is often fit to the observed wind speed data . Different locations will have different wind speed distributions . The Weibull model closely mirrors the actual distribution of hourly / ten @-@ minute wind speeds at many locations . The Weibull factor is often close to 2 and therefore a Rayleigh distribution can be used as a less accurate , but simpler model .

 = History of the National Hockey League = 
 The history of the National Hockey League begins with the end of its predecessor league , the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) , in 1917 . After unsuccessfully attempting to resolve disputes with Eddie Livingstone , owner of the Toronto Blueshirts , executives of the three other NHA franchises suspended the NHA , and formed the National Hockey League ( NHL ) , replacing the Livingstone team with a temporary team in Toronto , the Arenas . The NHL 's first quarter @-@ century saw the league compete against two rival major leagues — the Pacific Coast Hockey Association and Western Canada Hockey League — for players and the Stanley Cup . The NHL first expanded into the United States in 1924 with the founding of the Boston Bruins , and by 1926 consisted of ten teams in Ontario , Quebec , the Great Lakes region , and the Northeastern United States . At the same time , the NHL emerged as the only major league and the sole competitor for the Stanley Cup ; in 1947 , the NHL completed a deal with the Stanley Cup trustees to gain full control of the Cup . The NHL 's footprint spread across Canada as Foster Hewitt 's radio broadcasts were heard coast @-@ to @-@ coast starting in 1933 . 
 The Great Depression and World War II reduced the league to six teams , later known as the " Original Six " , by 1942 . Maurice Richard became the first player to score 50 goals in a season in 1944 – 45 , and ten years later , Richard was suspended for assaulting a linesman , leading to the Richard Riot . Gordie Howe made his debut in 1946 , and retired 35 seasons later as the NHL 's all @-@ time leader in goals and points . " China Clipper " Larry Kwong becomes the first non @-@ white player in the league , breaking the NHL colour barrier in 1948 , when he played for the New York Rangers . Willie O 'Ree broke the NHL 's black colour barrier when he suited up for the Bruins in 1958 . In 1959 , Jacques Plante became the first goaltender to regularly use a mask for protection . 
 The Original Six era ended in 1967 when the NHL doubled in size by adding six new expansion teams . The six existing teams were formed into the newly created East Division , while the expansion teams were formed into the West Division . The NHL continued to expand , adding another six teams , to total 18 by 1974 . This continued expansion was partially brought about by the NHL 's attempts to compete with the World Hockey Association , which operated from 1972 until 1979 and sought to compete with the NHL for markets and players . Bobby Hull was the most famous player to defect to the rival league , signing a $ 2 @.@ 75 million contract with the Winnipeg Jets . The NHL became involved in international play in the mid @-@ 1970s , starting with the Summit Series in 1972 which pitted the top Canadian players of the NHL against the top players in the Soviet Union , which was won by Canada with four wins , three losses , and a tie . Eventually , Soviet @-@ Bloc players streamed into the NHL with the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 . 
 When the WHA ceased operations in 1979 , the NHL absorbed four of the league 's teams , which brought the NHL to 21 teams , a figure that remained constant until the San Jose Sharks were added as an expansion franchise in 1991 . Since then , the league has grown from 22 teams in 1992 to 30 today as the NHL spread its footprint across the United States . The league has withstood major labour conflicts in 1994 – 95 and 2004 – 05 , the latter of which saw the entire 2004 – 05 NHL season canceled , the first time in North American history that a league has canceled an entire season in a labour dispute . Wayne Gretzky passed Gordie Howe as the NHL 's all @-@ time leading scorer in 1994 when he scored his 802nd career goal . Mario Lemieux overcame non @-@ Hodgkin lymphoma to finish his NHL career with over 1 @,@ 700 points and two Stanley Cup championships . Increased use of defence @-@ focused systems helped cause scoring to fall in the late 1990s , leading some to argue that the NHL 's talent pool had been diluted by 1990s expansion . In 1998 , the NHL began awarding teams a single point for losing in overtime , hoping to reduce the number of tie games ; after the 2004 – 05 lockout , it eliminated the tie altogether , introducing the shootout to ensure that each game has a winner . 
 = = Background and founding = = 
 The first attempts to regulate competitive ice hockey matches came in the late 1880s . Before then , teams competed in tournaments and infrequent challenge contests that prevailed in the Canadian sports world at the time . In 1887 , four clubs from Montreal formed the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada ( AHAC ) and developed a structured schedule . In 1892 , Lord Stanley donated the Stanley Cup to be symbolic of the Canadian championship and appointed Philip <unk> Ross and Sheriff John Sweetland as its trustees . It was awarded to the AHAC champion Montreal Hockey Club and thereafter awarded to the league champions , or to any pre @-@ approved team that won it in a challenge . In 1904 , the International Hockey League ( IHL ) , based around Lake Michigan , was created as the first fully professional league , which lasted for two seasons . In recruiting players , the IHL caused an " Athletic War " that drained amateur clubs of top players , most noticeably in the Ontario Hockey Association ( OHA ) . In the 1905 – 06 season , the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association ( ECAHA ) was formed , which mixed paid and amateur players in its rosters , which led to the demise of the IHL . Bidding wars for players led many ECAHA teams to lose money , and it eventually folded on November 25 , 1909 . As a result of the dissolution of the ECAHA , two leagues were formed — the Canadian Hockey Association ( CHA ) and the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) . Since the NHA 's owners were notable , wealthy businessmen , the CHA did not complete a season , as the NHA easily recruited the top players , and interest in the CHA teams faded . By 1914 , the rival Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) league was launched and the NHA champion would play off each season against the PCHA champion for the Stanley Cup , ending the challenge era .
