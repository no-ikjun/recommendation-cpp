 High says that Odin sent the gods to gather the children and bring them to him . Upon their arrival , Odin threw Jörmungandr into " that deep sea that lies round all lands , " Odin threw Hel into Niflheim , and bestowed upon her authority over nine worlds , in that she must " administer board and lodging to those sent to her , and that is those who die of sickness or old age . " High details that in this realm Hel has " great Mansions " with extremely high walls and immense gates , a hall called <unk> , a dish called " Hunger , " a knife called " Famine , " the servant <unk> ( Old Norse " lazy walker " ) , the serving @-@ maid <unk> ( also " lazy walker " ) , the entrance threshold " Stumbling @-@ block , " the bed " Sick @-@ bed , " and the curtains " Gleaming @-@ bale . " High describes Hel as " half black and half flesh @-@ coloured , " adding that this makes her easily recognizable , and furthermore that Hel is " rather downcast and fierce @-@ looking . " 
 In chapter 49 , High describes the events surrounding the death of the god Baldr . The goddess Frigg asks who among the Æsir will earn " all her love and favour " by riding to Hel , the location , to try to find Baldr , and offer Hel herself a ransom . The god Hermóðr volunteers and sets off upon the eight @-@ legged horse Sleipnir to Hel . Hermóðr arrives in Hel 's hall , finds his brother Baldr there , and stays the night . The next morning , Hermóðr begs Hel to allow Baldr to ride home with him , and tells her about the great weeping the Æsir have done upon Baldr 's death . Hel says the love people have for Baldr that Hermóðr has claimed must be tested , stating : 
 " If all things in the world , alive or dead , weep for him , then he will be allowed to return to the Æsir . If anyone speaks against him or refuses to cry , then he will remain with Hel . " 
 Later in the chapter , after the female jötunn <unk> refuses to weep for the dead Baldr , she responds in verse , ending with " let Hel hold what she has . " In chapter 51 , High describes the events of Ragnarök , and details that when Loki arrives at the field Vígríðr " all of Hel 's people " will arrive with him . 
 In chapter 5 of the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál , Hel is mentioned in a kenning for Baldr ( " Hel 's companion " ) . In chapter 16 , " Hel 's [ ... ] relative or father " is given as a kenning for Loki . In chapter 50 , Hel is referenced ( " to join the company of the quite monstrous wolf 's sister " ) in the skaldic poem <unk> . 
 = = = Heimskringla = = = 
 In the Heimskringla book Ynglinga saga , written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson , Hel is referred to , though never by name . In chapter 17 , the king Dyggvi dies of sickness . A poem from the 9th century Ynglingatal that forms the basis of Ynglinga saga is then quoted that describes Hel 's taking of Dyggvi : 
 I doubt not 
 but Dyggvi 's corpse 
 Hel does hold 
 to whore with him ; 
 for Ulf 's sib 
 a scion of kings 
 by right should 
 caress in death : 
 to love lured 
 Loki 's sister 
 <unk> 's heir 
 o 'er all Sweden . 
 In chapter 45 , a section from Ynglingatal is given which refers to Hel as " <unk> ' <unk> " ( meaning " guardian of the graves " ) and as taking King Halfdan <unk> from life . In chapter 46 , King Eystein <unk> dies by being knocked overboard by a sail yard . A section from Ynglingatal follows , describing that Eystein " fared to " Hel ( referred to as " <unk> 's @-@ brother 's @-@ daughter " ) . In chapter 47 , the deceased Eystein 's son King Halfdan dies of an illness , and the excerpt provided in the chapter describes his fate thereafter , a portion of which references Hel : 
 Loki 's child

 to her thing 
 the third liege @-@ lord , 
 when Halfdan 
 of <unk> farm 
 left the life 
 allotted to him . 
 In a stanza from Ynglingatal recorded in chapter 72 of the Heimskringla book Saga of Harald Sigurdsson , " given to Hel " is again used as a phrase to referring to death .

 The Icelanders ' saga Egils saga contains the poem <unk> . The saga attributes the poem to 10th century skald Egill Skallagrímsson , and writes that it was composed by Egill after the death of his son Gunnar . The final stanza of the poem contains a mention of Hel , though not by name : 
 Now my course is tough :

 = = = Gesta Danorum = = = 
 In the account of Baldr 's death in Saxo Grammaticus ' early 13th century work Gesta Danorum , the dying Baldr has a dream visitation from Proserpina ( here translated as " the goddess of death " ) : 
 The following night the goddess of death appeared to him in a dream standing at his side , and declared that in three days time she would clasp him in her arms . It was no idle vision , for after three days the acute pain of his injury brought his end . 
 Scholars have assumed that Saxo used Proserpina as a goddess equivalent to the Norse Hel .

 It has been suggested that several Migration Period imitation medallions and bracteates feature depictions of Hel . In particular the bracteates IK 14 and IK 124 depict a rider traveling down a slope and coming upon a female being holding a scepter or a staff . The downward slope may indicate that the rider is traveling towards the realm of the dead and the woman with the scepter may be a female ruler of that realm , corresponding to Hel . 
 Some B @-@ class bracteates showing three godly figures have been interpreted as depicting Baldr 's death , the best known of these is the <unk> bracteate . Two of the figures are understood to be Baldr and Odin while both Loki and Hel have been proposed as candidates for the third figure . If it is Hel she is presumably greeting the dying Baldr as he comes to her realm .

 The Old English Gospel of Nicodemus , preserved in two manuscripts from the 11th century , contains a female figure referred to as Seo hell who engages in flyting with Satan and tells him to leave her dwelling ( Old English ut of <unk> <unk> ) . Regarding Seo Hell in the Old English Gospel of Nicodemus , Michael Bell states that " her vivid personification in a dramatically excellent scene suggests that her gender is more than grammatical , and invites comparison with the Old Norse underworld goddess Hel and the Frau Holle of German folklore , to say nothing of underworld goddesses in other cultures " yet adds that " the possibility that these genders are merely grammatical is strengthened by the fact that an Old Norse version of Nicodemus , possibly translated under English influence , personifies Hell in the neuter ( Old Norse <unk> <unk> ) . " 
 = = = Bartholomeus saga postola = = = 
 The Old Norse Bartholomeus saga postola , an account of the life of Saint Bartholomew dating from the 13th century , mentions a " Queen Hel . " In the story , a devil is hiding within a pagan idol , and bound by Bartholomew 's spiritual powers to acknowledge himself and confess , the devil refers to Jesus as the one which " made war on Hel our queen " ( Old Norse <unk> a Hel <unk> vara ) . " Queen Hel " is not mentioned elsewhere in the saga . 
 Michael Bell says that while Hel " might at first appear to be identical with the well @-@ known pagan goddess of the Norse underworld " as described in chapter 34 of Gylfaginning , " in the combined light of the Old English and Old Norse versions of Nicodemus she casts quite a different a shadow , " and that in Bartholomeus saga postola " she is clearly the queen of the Christian , not pagan , underworld . " 
 = = = Origins and development = = = 
 Jacob Grimm theorized that Hel ( whom he refers to here as Halja , the theorized Proto @-@ Germanic form of the term ) is essentially an " image of a greedy , <unk> , female deity " and that " the higher we are allowed to penetrate into our antiquities , the less hellish and more godlike may Halja appear . Of this we have a particularly strong guarantee in her affinity to the Indian Bhavani , who travels about and bathes like Nerthus and Holda , but is likewise called Kali or Mahakali , the great black goddess . In the underworld she is supposed to sit in judgment on souls . This office , the similar name and the black hue [ ... ] make her exceedingly like Halja . And Halja is one of the oldest and commonest conceptions of our heathenism . " 
 Grimm theorizes that the <unk> , a three legged @-@ horse that roams the countryside " as a harbinger of plague and pestilence " in Danish folklore , was originally the steed of the goddess Hel , and that on this steed Hel roamed the land " picking up the dead that were her due . " In addition , Grimm says that a wagon was once ascribed to Hel , with which Hel made journeys . Grimm says that Hel is an example of a " half @-@ goddess ; " " one who cannot be shown to be either wife or daughter of a god , and who stands in a dependent relation to higher divinities " and that " half @-@ goddesses " stand higher than " half @-@ gods " in Germanic mythology . 
 Hilda Ellis Davidson ( 1948 ) states that Hel " as a goddess " in surviving sources seems to belong to a genre of literary personification , that the word hel is generally " used simply to signify death or the grave , " and that the word often appears as the equivalent to the English ' death , ' which Davidson states " naturally lends itself to personification by poets . " Davidson explains that " whether this personification has originally been based on a belief in a goddess of death called Hel is another question , " but that she does not believe that the surviving sources give any reason to believe so . Davidson adds that , on the other hand , various other examples of " certain supernatural women " connected with death are to be found in sources for Norse mythology , that they " seem to have been closely connected with the world of death , and were pictured as welcoming dead warriors , " and that the depiction of Hel " as a goddess " in Gylfaginning " might well owe something to these . " 
 In a later work ( 1998 ) , Davidson states that the description of Hel found in chapter 33 of Gylfaginning " hardly suggests a goddess . " Davidson adds that " yet this is not the impression given in the account of <unk> 's ride to Hel later in Gylfaginning ( 49 ) " and points out that here Hel " [ speaks ] with authority as ruler of the underworld " and that from her realm " gifts are sent back to Frigg and Fulla by Balder 's wife Nanna as from a friendly kingdom . " Davidson posits that Snorri may have " earlier turned the goddess of death into an allegorical figure , just as he made Hel , the underworld of shades , a place ' where wicked men go , ' like the Christian Hell ( Gylfaginning 3 ) . " Davidson continues that : 
 " On the other hand , a goddess of death who represents the horrors of slaughter and decay is something well known elsewhere ; the figure of Kali in India is an outstanding example . Like Snorri 's Hel , she is terrifying to in appearance , black or dark in colour , usually naked , adorned with severed heads or arms or the corpses of children , her lips smeared with blood . She haunts the battlefield or cremation ground and squats on corpses . Yet for all this she is ' the recipient of ardent devotion from countless devotees who approach her as their mother ' [ ... ] . 
 Davidson further compares to early attestations of the Irish goddesses Badb ( Davidson points to the description of Badb from The Destruction of Da <unk> 's Hostel where Badb is wearing a dusky mantle , has a large mouth , is dark in color , and has gray hair falling over her shoulders , or , alternatively , " as a red figure on the edge of the ford , washing the chariot of a king doomed to die " ) and The Morrígan . Davidson concludes that , in these examples , " here we have the fierce destructive side of death , with a strong emphasis on its physical horrors , so perhaps we should not assume that the gruesome figure of Hel is wholly Snorri 's literary invention . " 
 John Lindow states that most details about Hel , as a figure , are not found outside of Snorri 's writing in Gylfaginning , and says that when older skaldic poetry " says that people are ' in ' rather than ' with ' Hel , we are clearly dealing with a place rather than a person , and this is assumed to be the older conception , " that the noun and place Hel likely originally simply meant " grave , " and that " the personification came later . " Rudolf Simek theorizes that the figure of Hel is " probably a very late personification of the underworld Hel , " and says that " the first scriptures using the goddess Hel are found at the end of the 10th and in the 11th centuries . " Simek states that the allegorical description of Hel 's house in Gylfaginning " clearly stands in the Christian tradition , " and that " on the whole nothing speaks in favour of there being a belief in Hel in pre @-@ Christian times . " However , Simek also cites Hel as possibly appearing as one of three figures appearing together on Migration Period B @-@ bracteates .

 = Wilfrid Kent Hughes = 
 Sir Wilfrid Selwyn Kent Hughes KBE , MVO , MC ( 12 June 1895 – 31 July 1970 ) was an Australian soldier , Olympian and Olympic Games organiser , author and federal and state government minister . 
 Kent Hughes was born in Melbourne to an upper middle @-@ class family . He was set to attend the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship when he enlisted in the army on the outbreak of World War I. After his discharge from the army , Kent Hughes attended Oxford and represented Australia in athletics as a hurdler at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp . Upon the completion of his degree at Oxford , Kent Hughes returned to Australia , seeking a career in politics . Elected to the Victorian state parliament in 1927 , Kent Hughes sat with the conservative Nationalist Party of Australia , rising to the position of Deputy Premier of Victoria . Kent Hughes proved to be a controversial figure in politics , and was never afraid to publicly espouse his personal beliefs , such as an admiration for fascism , of which he had a poor understanding . 
 Kent Hughes re @-@ enlisted in the army at the outbreak of World War II and , while stationed in Singapore , was captured by the Japanese . He spent four years as a prisoner of war before his liberation by the Red Army in 1945 . Kent Hughes returned to Victorian state politics until switching to federal politics in 1949 . 
 He was appointed a Minister in the federal government led by Robert Menzies but complained his responsibilities were trifling . More interesting to him was the chairmanship of the 1956 Summer Olympics Organising Committee , where he showed he was willing to break longstanding Olympic conventions in order to modernise the Games . His role in the organisation of the Melbourne Olympics has led sporting historians to refer to Kent Hughes as " one of the most important figures in Olympic History " . Following the Olympics Kent Hughes was dropped from his ministerial posts and spent the remainder of his time in parliament on the backbenches , gaining a reputation as the most ardent anticommunist in parliament . He died aged 75 in 1970 , still a member of federal parliament .

 The second child of seven of English orthopaedic surgeon and publisher Wilfred Kent Hughes and his wife Clementina ( née Rankin ) , Kent Hughes was born in East Melbourne and educated at Trinity Grammar and Melbourne Grammar . He was accepted at Christ Church , Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar in 1914 ( although he did not commence study at Oxford until 1919 due to his war service ) . The family name was Hughes , and young Wilfrid was usually called Bill or Billy . Later , to avoid confusion with fellow politician Billy Hughes , he adopted one of his middle names , Kent , as part of his surname . It is not known why he spelled his given name " Wilfrid " while his father spelled it " Wilfred . " 
 A number of Kent Hughes 's relatives also gained national recognition in their chosen fields . Uncle Canon Ernest Hughes was an influential member of the Church of England in Australia and leading Australian rules footballer with St Kilda and Essendon and uncle Frederic Hughes was a Brigadier @-@ General , mayor of St Kilda and Aide @-@ de @-@ camp to the Governor @-@ General , the Earl of Dudley . Aunt Eva Hughes OBE founded the Australian Women 's National League , the then largest body of organised women in the country , while his sisters Dr Ellen Kent Hughes MBE was a leading paediatrician and community activist and Gwendoline Kent Lloyd , who Wilfrid referred to as " the family Communist " , was a renowned proponent of Indigenous rights .

 Kent Hughes enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force as a private on 8 August 1914 . He served in the 3rd Light Horse Brigade at Gallipoli , where he was wounded , then Sinai , Palestine and Syria . Kent Hughes , who reached the rank of major , was mentioned in despatches four times , received the Military Cross in 1917 for his " marked ability and energy in the performance of his duties " , and appointed Deputy Adjutant and Quartermaster General of the Australian Mounted Division . Upon his return to Australia in 1918 he published a volume of memoirs , Modern Crusaders , about his exploits in the Light Horse Brigade .

 At war 's end , Kent Hughes entered Christ Church , Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar , gaining a Bachelor of Arts with Honours in Modern History . He also captained the Oxford ski team and showed a proficiency for athletics , such that Kent Hughes was chosen to represent Australia in the 110 and 400 metre hurdles at the 1920 Summer Olympics . He finished fourth in his heat of the 110 metre hurdles and failed to progress but won his 400 @-@ metre heat before finishing fifth in the semi final . Kent Hughes did not return to England empty handed , as he later admitted to souveniring an official Olympic flag from the Olympic stadium . 
 In 1921 , Kent Hughes was part of the Oxford Ski Team visit to Europe , during which he became the first Australian to ski competitively overseas . 
 Following his graduation from Oxford , Kent Hughes married Edith Kerr , a wealthy American heiress to a thread manufacturing empire , on 3 February 1923 in Montclair , New Jersey and returned to Melbourne to work as a director in his father 's publishing company Ramsay Publishing Pty Ltd while sizing up a career in politics . 
 = = Political life = = 
 In 1926 Kent Hughes unsuccessfully sought Nationalist Party of Australia preselection for the newly created seat of Kew in the Victorian Legislative Assembly before winning the seat as an Independent candidate at the 1927 election , after which he joined the Nationalists . Kent Hughes soon found himself opposed to the conservative establishment and what he considered the mediocrity of Victorian politics . He openly referred to a number of his fellow Nationalists as " <unk> " and opposition Australian Labor Party members as " uncouth , semi @-@ educated ill @-@ mannered narrow @-@ minded <unk> " . Kent Hughes , along with his close friend and ally Robert Menzies , founded the Young Nationalists Organisation in 1929 , which became an influential force in conservative politics in Victoria . 
 When the Nationalists came into power in December 1928 , Kent Hughes was appointed Cabinet Secretary and Government Whip but resigned his positions in July 1929 , ostensibly in protest over a government subsidy to a freezing works company but more likely in reaction to the ongoing <unk> of his fellow parliamentarians . 
 Following the formation of the United Australia Party ( UAP ) in place of the Nationalists in 1931 , Kent Hughes served in several portfolios , including Railways , Labour , Transport and Sustenance . It was as Minister for Sustenance , a portfolio designed to deal with the poverty of the Great Depression , that he became known as the " Minister for Starvation " . Kent Hughes drafted legislation that became the Unemployment Relief ( Administration ) Bill , which when enacted in January 1933 , forced the unemployed to work for the dole and denied any form of financial assistance to women . Kent Hughes 's bill has been described as the harshest piece of legislation in Australia directed towards the unemployed during the Depression . 
 In January 1933 Kent Hughes became embroiled in cricket 's Bodyline affair . A friend of English captain Douglas Jardine from their Oxford days , Kent Hughes publicly defended Jardine 's tactics of sustained short pitched bowling against the Australian batsmen , arguing that Australia used similar tactics against England during the 1921 Ashes tour . He also criticised the protests of Australian cricket 's governing body , the Australian Cricket Board of Control towards Jardine , stating they were " boorish , bitter ( and ) insulting " . 
 While he was attacking the Cricket Board of Control , Kent Hughes was simultaneously organising the Australian tour of the Duke of Gloucester , and for his efforts was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order in 1934 . In 1938 he was manager of the Australian team at the Empire Games held in Sydney . 
 = = = " Why I Have Become a Fascist " = = = 
 During the late 1920s and 1930s Kent Hughes developed a strong sympathy for fascism , encouraged in part by his uncle Ernest , who visited Italy in 1926 and published an enthusiastic report on Mussolini 's Italy in a local newspaper on his return . Kent Hughes was also impressed by Sir Oswald Mosley 's proposal for a British parliament consisting of business and national interests and headed by a powerful executive government . In 1933 he published a series of articles in the Melbourne Herald , titled " Why I Have Become a Fascist . " In one article he wrote that fascism " endeavours to avoid the egotistical attitude of laissez faire and the inertia of socialism . " Kent Hughes saw it as " a half @-@ way house between the two systems . " In fascist countries , he said , " industrial peace and security have been found to be worth the price of sacrificing some of the individual liberty previously enjoyed . " In what he called " British communities , " however , he expected that fascism would " be garbed not in the dictatorial black shirt , but in the more sedate style of the British Parliamentary representative . " 
 Kent Hughes was unique among prominent Australians in publicly identifying as a fascist , although he never joined a fascist organisation or acted overtly in a way that could be described as fascist and there is no evidence to suggest he was an anti @-@ semite . His biographer Frederick Howard maintains that Kent Hughes did not know much about fascism and used the word mainly for its shock value . " Kent Hughes does not seem to have paid enough attention to the difference between theory and practice in Mussolini 's Italy , " he observes . 
 Kent Hughes 's public support of fascism failed to damage his political career , as he was elected Victorian Deputy Leader of the UAP in 1935 , serving until his enlistment in the army in 1939 .

 In 1939 , without resigning from Parliament , Kent Hughes rejoined the Army , becoming a colonel in the 8th Division . He served in the Malaya campaign of 1942 , where he was again mentioned in despatches . Kent Hughes was taken prisoner by the Japanese in Singapore and was kept in the Changi Prisoner Of War camp , where he was beaten and half @-@ starved . In 1943 he was shipped as a slave labourer to Taiwan . In October 1944 he was shipped to Japan and on to Korea , and then sent by rail to Mukden in Manchuria , where prisoners of war were put to work in arms factories . In August 1945 Kent Hughes was liberated by the invading Red Army and returned to Australia with an amoebic complaint that would continue to bother him . While imprisoned , Kent Hughes secretly wrote what became Slaves of the Samurai , a colourful account of his wartime experiences , published in 1946 . He also took up the case of Australian General Gordon Bennett , who was accused of cowardice and desertion after leaving Singapore without authorisation shortly before the city surrendered to the Japanese . Kent Hughes appeared before the Royal Commission into Bennett 's case , and argued that Bennett was correct to avoid being taken prisoner and return to Australia to continue the fight . 
 Appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1947 for his wartime service , Kent Hughes was very popular with the ex @-@ service community , appearing in the ANZAC Day march in April each year on horseback , in his World War I uniform , and campaigning for improved benefits for ex @-@ servicemen , particularly ex @-@ prisoners of war .

 Kent Hughes returned to politics and followed most of the UAP into the newly created Liberal Party . He served as Deputy Premier , Minister for Transport and Minister for Public Instruction from 1947 to 1949 , as well as Chief Secretary and Minister for Electrical <unk> in 1948 . 
 In 1949 , Kent Hughes decided to transfer to federal politics . The bulk of his state electorate was within the comfortably safe Liberal federal seat of Kooyong , but that was held by his old colleague Menzies , now the federal leader of the Liberal Party . Instead , Kent Hughes opted to stand in Chisholm , a newly created seat in south @-@ east Melbourne that was just as safe as Kooyong . Duly elected , he was appointed Minister for the Interior and Minister for Works and Housing ( Minister for Works from June 1952 ) under Menzies . Kent Hughes complained that he was left in charge of only trifling issues . 
 = = = 1956 Olympics = = = 
 Following the successful bid by Melbourne to host the 1956 Summer Olympics , problems had beset the organising of the Games to the extent that International Olympic Committee President Avery Brundage threatened to award the Games to another city . In response , the Melbourne Organising Committee approached Kent Hughes in 1951 to be its chairman , believing his public stature , Olympian background and experience in administration would be great assets . 
 Kent Hughes took to the Chairman role with gusto , although his relationship with Brundage was never cordial . During a visit to Melbourne in 1955 to inspect the preparations , Brundage was less than impressed with the progress achieved under Kent Hughes 's chairmanship and condemned Kent Hughes 's apparent lack of concern at the looming deadline for the Games . Not one to take criticism lightly , Kent Hughes was quoted as saying that he had enough to worry about without having " Chicago blow @-@ ins come out here and blow their tops over nothing in particular and annoy everyone in general . " 
 Kent Hughes broke Olympic tradition in two significant ways . He decided to charge for television and newsreel footage of the Games where previously footage was provided free of charge . Secondly , following a suggestion from John Ian Wing , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old apprentice carpenter from Melbourne , Kent Hughes instigated the now familiar closing ceremony tradition of the athletes of different nations parading together , instead of with their national teams , as a symbol of world unity . Kent Hughes 's plan to charge for television and newsreel footage of the Games was strongly opposed in many circles , including the media , who believed that the Games were news and as such should be free , while Australian government authorities thought that providing free television coverage of the Games would lead to greater tourism opportunities . Brundage made no public comment on television rights for the Games but grasped the financial possibilities of charging for rights , devising a television rights fees policy following the Games , whereby television stations were forced to negotiate for televised rights for all future Games . This policy is believed to have netted the IOC over $ 12 billion since its inception at the 1960 Summer Olympics . 
 In recognition of his work successfully organising the Games Kent Hughes was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1957 . An award presented by the Victorian Olympic Council to the athlete it considers to have given the most outstanding performance at a Games is named in his honour and Kent Hughes 's significance to the modern Olympic movement is such that it has been suggested that an oil portrait of Kent Hughes be commissioned and placed in the Olympic Museum in Lausanne . 
 = = = Political decline = = = 
 Menzies dropped Kent Hughes from cabinet in 1956 , ostensibly because Menzies opposed some of his housing plans for Canberra . However , it was more likely due to Kent Hughes 's continued public comments on foreign affairs and defence matters , in which he took an independent line favouring a policy even more anti @-@ Communist than that of Menzies , higher defence spending and the reintroduction of conscription . Widely renowned as the parliamentary figure most knowledgeable in Asian affairs , Kent Hughes was a leading member of the " Taiwan lobby " in the Liberal Party , which sought to maintain the recognition of Taiwan as the official representative of China , and met several times with Chiang Kai @-@ shek . Following the unexpected death of Prime Minister Harold Holt in 1967 , Kent Hughes was one of a number of Liberal politicians who expressed support for Country Party leader ( and acting Prime Minister ) John McEwen remaining Prime Minister ahead of any of his fellow Liberal Party parliamentarians . As it turned out , Liberal Party member John Gorton was selected as the new Liberal Parliamentary leader and Prime Minister . 
 He remained very popular in his electorate , and served in Parliament until his death in 1970 . Survived by his wife and three daughters , Kent Hughes was accorded a State Funeral . The Times obituary highlighted his war service and Olympian status , referring to him as " one of the more colourful Australian parliamentarians " while sidestepping his earlier flirtation with fascism .

 Castle Lake is a glacial lake ( cirque lake or tarn ) located in the Trinity Mountains , in Siskiyou County of northern California . It is west of Mount Shasta City and Mount Shasta peak . 
 The outlet of the lake drains into Castle Lake Creek , and then into Lake Siskiyou reservoir , part of the headwaters of the Sacramento River . Nearly all of the lake 's 47 acres ( 19 ha ) are within the Shasta @-@ Trinity National Forest . Trails lead from Castle Lake into the adjacent Castle Crags Wilderness area , and on to Castle Crags State Park , including trails to Little Castle Lake and Heart Lake .

 The lake is usually reached by driving along an approximately 7 mi ( 11 km ) road from Lake Siskiyou . About 3 mi ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) from the lake , along this road , are Ney Springs and Faery Falls . Ney Springs is the site of the historic Ney Springs Resort , a late 19th @-@ century resort based on the mineral springs there ; this resort was one of a number of such popular resorts in Siskiyou County , including Upper Soda Springs , and Shasta Springs . A short hiking trail leads to nearby Faery Falls , where Ney Springs Creek falls nearly 60 ft ( 18 m ) down a granite cliff face , forming a clear pool at the bottom . 
 About one @-@ quarter mile ( 400 m ) north of Castle Lake is a campground . At the lake itself , fishing and picnicking , as well as viewing the local plant life , wildlife and scenery , are common activities . The lake waters can be cool , so swimming is generally limited to summer months . Kayaking , <unk> and rafting are available on the lake . In the winter , in addition to cross @-@ country skiing and snow @-@ shoeing along the trails in the area , the lake will ice over and ice fishing is a common activity . 
 From the parking area at the lake , a half @-@ mile ( 1 km ) trail winds along the northern and western shore of the lake , ending at the granite face of the headwall , which forms the southern shore . Along the way , hikers will pass the Castle Lake Limnological Research Station . 
 Following the eastern shore , the Little Castle Lake trail leaves the parking area , and then climbs the adjoining ridge ; about 1 mi ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) along this trail is Little Castle Lake , a small glacial tarn reached by passing through meadows of wild flowers in the early summer . Little Castle Lake is within the Castle Crags Wilderness Area . Heart Lake , another small tarn , located above the headwall of Castle Lake , may also be reached via an informal cut @-@ off from the Little Castle Lake trail . 
 At this point , the well @-@ known Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail is one @-@ half mile ( 1 km ) away , just over the Trinity Divide . The Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail stretches from Mexico to Canada , following the highest portion of the Sierra Nevada , Klamath Mountains , and Cascade Range and paralleling the Pacific Ocean by 100 to 150 miles ( 161 to 241 km ) . 
 The Little Castle Lake trail continues on to Mt . Bradley , a locally prominent mountain with views of Mount Shasta , overlooking Dunsmuir , California and the canyon of the Upper Sacramento River . Along the way , the trail joins with a network of connections leading into Castle Crags State Park .

 The lake 's origins date to the Pleistocene Era ( more than 10 @,@ 000 years ago ) when a glacier carved a basin in the location of the current lake . During that era , much of North America was glaciated . Castle Lake is a typical glacier cirque lake ( or tarn ) , reaching depths of up to 110 ft ( 34 m ) near the southern , granitic part of the lakeshore ( the cirque face ) . There is a terminal moraine of boulders and gravel forming a natural dam opposite the cirque face along the northeastern shore of the lake , where there is an outlet , and the lake is 10 to 15 feet deep ( 3 to 5 m ) . 
 The cirque where Castle Lake is found is a classic Northern Hemisphere cirque . The cirque headwall ( the highest part of the mountain where the glacier began to form ) was in the south or southwest , and the part of the mountain that sloped downward to the northeast was away from the prevailing winds . The resulting shaded area was sheltered from direct sun , and from the evaporating effects of wind . These conditions encouraged snow which had fallen in the winter to remain throughout the summer and fall , creating a year @-@ round snow pack which grew deeper each year . 
 During initial glacial formation , snow changed into glacial ice as this year @-@ round snow pack increased and deepened . The process of <unk> followed ( where a hollow in a slope was enlarged by freeze @-@ thaw weathering and glacial erosion ) . As the hollow enlarged and filled with snow and ice , rock debris ( or till ) contained within the glacial ice also began to abrade the bedrock surface – as the glacial ice moved down the slope , it had a " sandpaper effect " on the bedrock which it scraped . 
 Eventually the hollow took the shape of a large bowl in the side of the mountain , with the headwall being weathered by constant freezing and thawing , and eroded by plucking . The basin became deeper ( especially at the base of the headwall ) as it continued to be eroded by abrasion . 
 When the current warming period began , the glacier retreated and finally melted completely . It left behind a bowl shape , deepest at the base of the headwall where the glacial ice had been the deepest and most abrasive . The bowl shape extended to its northeast edge , where there was a terminal moraine of smaller rocks and debris which had been deposited by the glacier . When the bowl @-@ shaped crater filled with water , this terminal moraine acted as a natural dam , helping to contain the water in the newly formed cirque lake . 
 = = History = = 
 Castle Lake was within the range of the Okwanuchu tribe , one of a number of small <unk> @-@ speaking tribes of Native Americans who were closely related to the adjacent larger Shasta tribe . The Okwanuchu occupied territory near Mount Shasta , including the nearby present @-@ day cities of Mount Shasta and Dunsmuir , California , and the upper Sacramento River canyon ( among other areas ) . The Okwanuchu were speakers of the older Hokan @-@ speaking family of languages , with archaeological sites associated with their range dating back more than 5000 years . However , members of a tribe of the Penutian @-@ speaking family of languages , the Wintu , who arrived in central Northern California about 1200 years ago , were out @-@ competing their Hokan @-@ language family neighbors , and were expanding Wintu territory . It is unclear at the time of first contact with non @-@ Native Americans in the 1820s which tribe was living nearest to Castle Lake . Little or no information is available about Native American use or beliefs regarding Castle Lake ; for example , Castle Lake is not mentioned in a published collection of Wintu tales and legends . 
 The first non @-@ Native Americans to pass through the area of Castle Lake were hunters and trappers of the Hudson 's Bay Company , who began to come down the Siskiyou Trail from present @-@ day Washington into Mexican @-@ controlled California , in the late 1820s and early 1830s , in search of beaver and other pelt @-@ bearing animals . At about this same time , Ewing Young led the first group of Americans up the Siskiyou Trail , passing near Castle Lake . In 1841 , an overland party of the United States Exploring Expedition , the first cartographers and scientists came through the area . Following the annexation of California by the United States in 1848 as a result of the Mexican @-@ American War , Castle Lake came under the control of the U.S. Federal Government as public land . 
 In 1855 , an area near Castle Lake , now known as Battle Rock , was the site of a battle between Native Americans and California Gold Rush @-@ era settlers . The poet Joaquin Miller wrote a first @-@ hand account of this battle , The Battle of Castle Crags , in which Miller took part in the fight , and received an arrow wound through the cheek and jaw . This battle was reportedly the last battle between Native Americans and settlers in which the Native Americans fought exclusively with bow and arrow . 
 With the development , first , of the U.S. " Forest Reserve " system in the late 19th century , and then the organization of the U.S. National Forests in the early 20th century , Castle Lake came under the stewardship of the U.S. Forest Service . The association between U.C. Davis and Castle Lake began in 1957 , with the first extensive study done of the lake , followed by the construction of the " Castle Lake Limnological Research Station " . itself . 
 = = Animal life = = 
 Humans introduced fish into the lake in the 1930s for sport fishing , including rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) , brook trout ( Salvelinus <unk> ) , and golden shiner ( <unk> <unk> ) . Trout were last released into Castle Lake in 2008 by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife but recreational fish stocking has since ceased due to concern for other species ( i.e. , threatened or endangered ) . The brook char was also originally stocked but now has become self @-@ sustaining , and reproduces naturally in springs found on the eastern side of the lake . Golden shiner is a bait fish minnow that was likely placed in the lake by anglers who left their remaining bait behind in the lake . The fish feed on zooplankton and insects ; the fish are then eaten by predators around the lake , especially osprey ( Pandion haliaetus ) . Other birds in the area include bald eagle ( <unk> <unk> ) , golden eagle ( Aquila chrysaetos ) , peregrine falcon ( Falco peregrinus ) , wood duck ( Aix sponsa ) , belted kingfisher ( Megaceryle alcyon ) , Steller 's jay ( <unk> <unk> ) , and sooty grouse ( <unk> fuliginosus ) . 
 Reptiles and amphibians around the lake , including the rough @-@ skinned newt ( Taricha granulosa ) , the Cascades frog ( Rana <unk> ) and the garter snake ( Thamnophis sirtalis ) , feed as well on insects and young fish ( among other prey ) . Many mammals can be found around the lake and in the adjacent wilderness area , national forest , and parklands . These include black bear ( Ursus americanus ) , blacktail deer ( Odocoileus hemionus ) , river otter ( Lutra canadensis ) , black @-@ tailed jackrabbit ( Lepus californicus ) , and mountain lion ( also known as " cougars " or " puma " ) ( Puma concolor ) . Castle lake cougars have on occasion been known to crouch in the bushes and watch humans , their eyes shining in the moonlight . No attacks have been noted .

 Although the lake ( at elevation 5 @,@ 574 ft ( 1 @,@ 699 m ) ) and surrounding areas are well below local tree line ( for example , on nearby Mount Shasta , the tree line is at about 7 @,@ 900 ft ( 2 @,@ 400 m ) ) , because of the high concentration of granite and the often exposed steep , rocky slopes , the vegetation at the lake and in the area can vary widely , from dense mixed forest near and below the lake to the appearance of near @-@ alpine conditions above the lake . 
 At and in the area below the lake , mixed forests of ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa ) , red fir ( Abies <unk> ) , white fir ( Abies <unk> ) , lodgepole pine ( Pinus <unk> ) , incense cedar ( <unk> <unk> ) and alder can be found . <unk> play a particularly important role , as alders establish symbioses with the nitrogen @-@ fixing Actinobacteria ( <unk> alni ) . This bacteria converts atmospheric nitrogen into soil @-@ soluble nitrates which can be utilised by the alder , and favorably enhances the soil fertility generally . <unk> benefit other plants growing near them by taking nitrogen out of the air and depositing it in the soil in usable form ; fallen alder leaves make very rich compost . Picea <unk> exists in a few small locations on the igneous slopes behind the lake . Other deciduous trees at lower elevations in the area may include such species as bigleaf maple , vine maple , black oak and Pacific dogwood . 
 At higher elevations above the lake ( especially in rocky or exposed locations ) , the pine and fir tree forests are thinner , and the trees grow in a more stunted fashion ; instead , shrubs and bushes , such as green manzanita ( Arctostaphylos patula ) , dwarf mountain manzanita ( Arctostaphylos <unk> ) , and tan oak ( Lithocarpus densiflorus ) find areas and niches to grow . 
 The best @-@ known plant life in the area , however , are the lakeside and nearby meadow displays of alpine and sub @-@ alpine flowers in the early summer . These can include wood rose ( Rosa <unk> ) , Shasta lupine ( Lupinus <unk> ) , red / crimson / scarlet <unk> ( Aquilegia truncata ) , tiger lily ( Lilium <unk> ) , fawn lily ( Erythronium sp . ) , pine @-@ drops ( <unk> <unk> ) , douglas <unk> ( Spiraea douglasii ) , scarlet paintbrush ( Castilleja <unk> ) , alpine paintbrush ( Castilleja arachnoidea ) , dwarf paintbrush ( Castilleja miniata ) , alpine saxifrage ( Saxifraga <unk> ) , Shasta <unk> ( <unk> laetus ) , alpine buckwheat ( Eriogonum <unk> ) , and Tofield 's swamp lily ( <unk> occidentalis ) . Also , in cool , wet spots near the lake , carnivorous Pitcher Plants ( Darlingtonia californica ) appear .

 " You Know My Name " , performed by Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell , is the theme song to the 2006 James Bond film , Casino Royale . Cornell wrote it jointly with David Arnold , the soundtrack 's composer . The film producers went after Cornell because they wanted a strong male singer . Cornell and Arnold tried to make the song a replacement theme for the character instead of the " James Bond theme " reflecting the agent 's inexperience in Casino Royale , as well as an introduction to Daniel Craig 's grittier and more emotional portrayal of Bond . The single sold 148 @,@ 000 copies in 2006 in the UK . 
 The track was leaked onto the Internet on September 20 , 2006 , and released as a single on November 13 , 2006 , charting in many countries . Reviews for " You Know My Name " were positive , and the song won the Satellite Award and the World Soundtrack Award , and was nominated for a Grammy Award . While not included in the Casino Royale soundtrack , " You Know My Name " appeared on Cornell 's second solo album , Carry On . 
 = = Composition and recording = = 
 Lia Vollack , Sony Pictures 's President of Music , called Chris Cornell inviting him to make a song for the new Bond movie , which would " reflect the dramatic new direction of James Bond " , with a " strong male singer " . Cornell thought it was a strange offer , considering that he is American , and imagined that he would perform a secondary song in the film instead of the main theme . Cornell declared he liked the Bond movies , particularly the ones with Sean Connery , but that he " wasn 't really a big fan of the last several movies " . But Daniel Craig 's casting as James Bond intrigued the musician , and he decided to accept the job . Cornell then went to Prague to visit the film 's shooting , and was much impressed with the film 's emotional content after he was shown a rough cut of Casino Royale . In Prague he also met the score composer , David Arnold , who suggested writing a song " that echoed the film score " . 
 The composers started their writing separately , Cornell in his apartment in Paris , and Arnold in his house in London . Cornell stated that he had some difficulties with composing : " It is difficult , I think , to write lyrics for a character , so really I just kind of wandered around for about a month not thinking about it too much , until I sort of formulated some idea of a way that I could approach it , where I 'm kind of relating to what 's in the character in the movie . And because this particular Bond is very edgy , but also has a lot of emotional depth , it 's a lot easier . " Later the two musicians met and showed each other 's ideas , and according to Arnold " it was almost like we wrote two parts of the same song . " Cornell wrote lyrics , to which Arnold added some lines and later music . Some of Arnold 's ideas included the song 's title , the heavy introduction , and " having the same genetic material as the Bond theme , but in a different order and in a different shape " . 
 After a demo of the song was approved by the film 's producers , both musicians recorded the full version in AIR Studios London . Cornell and Arnold recorded the guitar and bass parts themselves and hired a session musician for the drums . The recordings were finished by the time Casino Royale finished its principal photography on July 21 , 2006 , and Arnold played it at the wrap party . Afterwards he mixed in the orchestra parts . 
 Speaking to film music fan site <unk> , Arnold said he wanted " You Know My Name " to act as a substitute for the James Bond theme , to represent Bond 's immaturity . The song 's main notes are played throughout the film , and the classic theme only plays during the end credits to signal the end of his character arc . Arnold felt the song should tie closer to the score , and have the " DNA of the James Bond music " . The musical arrangement tried to create " the right blend of rock aggression and sophisticated instrumentation " , with Cornell describing it as " more uptempo and a little more aggressive than any other Bond theme has been , maybe since Paul McCartney [ ' s ' Live and Let Die ' ] " . 
 Cornell stated that the biggest two influences on " You Know My Name " were Tom Jones , who performed the theme for Thunderball , and Paul McCartney , who composed and performed the theme for Live and Let Die . " I decided that I was going to sing it like Tom Jones , in that crooning style . I wanted people to hear my voice , " Cornell said . " And ' Live and Let Die ' is a fantastic song . Paul McCartney wouldn 't have written it if not for that movie . I [ also ] wanted to write a song in its own universe . I knew I 'd never have it again — a big orchestra — so I wanted to have fun with it . " Cornell did not put the film 's title in the lyrics , because he " couldn 't imagine it fitting into a song lyric that would come out of my mouth " . And he jokingly stated " Casino Royale didn 't make a good rock title , but I would write a song named Octopussy just for fun " . 
 Before producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli announced on July 26 , 2006 , that Cornell was performing the theme for Casino Royale , various names were reported in the media , some reports going so far as to have the performers apparently claim they were working on the song . This list includes Tina Turner , who previously sang " GoldenEye " for the 1995 Bond film of the same name , and Tony Christie . 
 The lyrics try to illustrate Bond 's psyche in Casino Royale , described by Cornell as a conflicted and tough spy with more emotional depth , not the " <unk> , seemingly invincible , winking kinda ladies ' man superspy " of the previous incarnations . Cornell tried to focus on the existential dilemmas and possible sacrifices of secret agents - " There 's an isolation in that ; the stakes are very high . I 've done a lot of living in my 42 years , and it wasn 't hard for me to relate to that . " The song also served as an introduction to the character , even though he was featured in many other movies before - hence the title " You Know My Name " - dealing with Bond 's action such as his first assassination , " introducing himself to what may be the rest of his life and how he will live it and what it will mean . "

 Three versions of the song were produced : 
 Main Version : Track 1 on " You Know My Name " singles 
 Pop Mix : used in the video and released on the Carry On album and on German singles as Track 2 
 Film Versions : more orchestral versions used in the film 's opening and closing credits . 
 The song was leaked on the internet on September 20 , 2006 . The first version of the song , the grittier one which was leaked and not used in the movie , was made available for download on iTunes Store on November 13 , 2006 . This version debuted on the UK Single Download Chart at number 20 on November 22 , 2006 . It was released as a stand @-@ alone single on December 14 , 2006 . The single features a new acoustic version of the Soundgarden song " Black Hole Sun " as a B @-@ side . The German , Dutch and Australian versions of the single offer a second version of " You Know My Name " ( called the Pop Mix ) as a B @-@ side . This version is the one used for the song 's music video , and is available on Chris Cornell 's solo album , Carry On . 
 The song is the first Bond theme not to be included on its film 's soundtrack album . Cornell declared that it happened because he wanted the song to be " his " , and since he wrote " You Know My Name " in midst of recording the solo album Carry On , he felt that the song belonged to the album . In 2008 , the song was included in the compilation The Best of Bond ... James Bond . 
 The song 's music video was directed by Michael Haussman , who tried to compare " the lives of a professional spy and a rock star " . The video premiered on MTV 's Making the Video on October 31 , 2006 .

The song also received a first @-@ round nomination in the Best Original Song category for the 2006 Academy Awards , but did not qualify for the final list of nominees . 
 The song received enthusiastic reviews , with critics praising the song 's ability to fit well with the context of the film . Film reviewer James Berardinelli considered " You Know My Name " to " sound eerily like something by John Barry " ; DVD Verdict 's review praised the song , describing it as " working remarkably well in the film 's context , lyrically and sonically " , and Cinefantastique called it " the best Bond theme song in years , [ that ] captures the full @-@ blooded glory of classics like ' Goldfinger ' " . Entertainment Weekly listed " You Know My Name " on a list of Academy Award snubs for Best Song , describing it as " a musically suave , lyrically ominous rock tune that is perfect for Casino Royale 's dark reboot of the spy franchise " . Among music critics , Billboard described it as " the best Bond theme since ' A View to a Kill ' " , praising the minimal production ; on its review of Carry On , the magazine considered " You Know My Name " to be the best track of the album , describing it as " some of Cornell 's most uncomplicated and accessible music to date " ; the BBC 's unnamed reviewer considered that Cornell 's voice " weighs down " the song ;

 Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ <unk> , Swedish : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; born on 24 October 1989 ) , better known by his online alias PewDiePie ( / <unk> / <unk> @-@ dee @-@ py ) , is a Swedish web @-@ based comedian and video producer , best known for his Let 's Play commentaries and vlogs on YouTube . 
 Born in Gothenburg , Sweden , PewDiePie originally pursued a degree in industrial economics and technology management at Chalmers University of Technology . In 2010 , during his time at the university , he registered his PewDiePie YouTube account . The following year he dropped out of Chalmers to focus on his YouTube channel , much to the chagrin of his parents . Having been refused support from them , PewDiePie began working at a hot dog stand to fund his videos . PewDiePie soon gathered a rapidly increasing online following , and in 2012 , his channel surpassed one million subscribers . 
 Since 15 August 2013 , PewDiePie 's channel has been the most subscribed user on YouTube , being surpassed briefly in November and December 2013 by YouTube 's Spotlight channel . Holding the position since 22 December 2013 , the channel has reached over 46 million subscribers , as of July 2016 . On 19 July 2014 , the channel surpassed singer Rihanna 's Vevo account on YouTube to become the most viewed channel of all time , and as of June 2016 , the channel has received over 12 billion video views . In 2016 , Time magazine named him one of " The World 's 100 Most Influential People . " 
 PewDiePie refers to his fanbase as the " Bro Army " , and individual fans as " bros " . Through his Bro Army fanbase , PewDiePie has raised money for charities . Due to his popularity , PewDiePie 's coverage of indie games has created an Oprah effect , boosting sales for titles he plays . PewDiePie lives in Brighton with his girlfriend , Italian YouTube personality Marzia Bisognin .

 PewDiePie was born and raised in Gothenburg , Sweden . He was born to Lotta Kristine Johanna ( born 7 May 1958 ) and Ulf Christian Kjellberg ( born 8 January 1957 ) , and grew up with his sister , Fanny , as well . His mother Johanna , a former <unk> CIO , was named the 2010 CIO of the Year in Sweden . His father , Ulf , is also a Chief Executive of a company . 
 During his early schooling life , he was interested in art , and has noted that he would draw popular video game characters such as Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog . During high school , he would skip classes to play video games at an Internet cafe with friends ; on this topic , PewDiePie has commented , " Sweden has a great culture around gaming . " In 2008 , he graduated from Göteborgs <unk> <unk> . He then went on to pursue a degree in industrial economics and technology management at Chalmers University of Technology , but left the university in 2011 to focus on his YouTube career . On this decision , PewDiePie has stated , " Thinking about it now , it was utterly absurd . To get into Chalmers for industrial economics you need straight A 's , but somehow I was happier selling hot dogs and making my own gaming @-@ videos . "

 The main focus of PewDiePie 's videos is his commentary and reactions to various games as he plays through them . Due to this , his videos fall under the Let 's Play umbrella . Unlike conventional walkthroughs , his Let 's Play videos are devoted to " sharing gaming moments on YouTube with my bros . " Variety details that " PewDiePie acts like he ’ s spending time with a friend . He begins each video introducing himself in a high @-@ pitched , goofy voice , drawing out the vowels of his YouTube moniker , then delves into the videos . " 
 In his early years as a YouTube personality , PewDiePie was known for playing horror and action video games , most notably Amnesia : The Dark Descent and its related mods . PewDiePie also began posting weekly vlogs starting from 2 September 2011 . These vlogs are uploaded under the title of Fridays with PewDiePie . He typically performs a " <unk> " at the end of each of his videos . As his channel grew , he began to branch out in terms of his video content , uploading live @-@ action and animated comedy shorts . In 2014 , he began to more actively play games that interested him , regardless if they were of the horror genre or not . In addition , he is also known to support video games from indie developers .

 The nature of PewDiePie 's video content has been described by various outlets as goofy , energetic , obnoxious and filled with profanity . However , many of the same outlets concede that PewDiePie 's content is genuine and unfiltered . Sarah Begley of Time said his clips contained " charismatic narration . " Chris Reed of The Wall St. Cheat Sheet said it contained " off @-@ the @-@ cuff running commentary that 's characterised by goofy jokes , profanity , and loud outbursts . " Another reporter noted PewDiePie 's " chosen mode of sharing his critique happens to be ribald entertainment , an unmediated stream of blurted jokes , startled yelps , goofy voices , politically incorrect comments , and pretty much nonstop profanity . " Reed adds that these aspects of PewDiePie 's videos are what critics find most abrasive , but what fans love the most . 
 PewDiePie resorts occasionally to gameplay , causing silent or emotional commentary ; his playthrough of The Last of Us , it was noted , left the usually vocal gamer speechless at the ending .

 PewDiePie originally registered a YouTube account under the name " <unk> " ; he explains that " pew " represents the sound of lasers and " die " means death . After forgetting the password to this account , he then registered the " PewDiePie " YouTube channel on 29 April 2010 . After dropping out of Chalmers , his parents refused to support him , and as a result PewDiePie funded his early videos by working at a hot dog stand . On having to work at the stand , PewDiePie stated , " the fact that I could make videos was so much more important to me than [ that ] I had to spend a few hours a day doing a job that wasn ’ t that prestigious . " Five years later , PewDiePie recalled , " I knew people were big at other types of videos , but there was no one big in gaming , and I didn ’ t know you could make money out of it . It was never like a career that I could just quit college to <unk> it was just something I loved to do . And here we are five years later and it ’ s exploded . " By December 2011 , PewDiePie 's channel had around 60 @,@ 000 subscribers . Around the time his channel earned 700 @,@ 000 subscribers , PewDiePie spoke at <unk> Conference 2012 .

That December , PewDiePie signed with Maker Studios . 
 Early in his YouTube career , Kjellberg used rape jokes in his videos . Criticism of these jokes stirred controversy , and in October 2012 , Kjellberg posted a Tumblr message , stating " I just wanted to make clear that I 'm no longer making rape jokes , as I mentioned before I 'm not looking to hurt anyone and I apologise if it ever did .

PewDiePie often refers to his fans as the " Bro Army " and addresses his audience as " bros " . 
 In September 2014 , Rob Walker of Yahoo ! called PewDiePie 's popularity " insane , " writing , that it " strikes me as considerably more curious — I mean , you know who Rihanna is , but would you recognise this kid if he were standing in line behind you at the bank ? " Walker , among other reporters and some casual gamers , have questioned the reasons for his popularity , while other reporters have criticised his rise in notability . Walker noted PewDiePie 's interaction with his audience , writing , " While he can be raucous and crude , it always comes across as genuine . He constantly addresses his audience as a bunch of peer @-@ like friends , as opposed to distant , <unk> fans . He 's certainly more than willing to make fun of himself in the process . " In 2015 The Verge wrote , " Love it or hate it , his success — like so many other YouTube personalities — isn 't just in playing games but actually connecting and talking directly to an audience . No agent , press release , or any other intermediary . He just hit record . " 
 Relating to his responsibility as a celebrity , PewDiePie has stated " many people see me as a friend they can chill with for 15 minutes a day , " and adding , " The loneliness in front of the computer screens brings us together . But I never set out to be a role model ; I just want to invite them to come over to my place . " <unk> with this note , his audience has been reported to provide positive remarks about him ; some of his viewers created and contributed to a thread expressing that he has made them happier and feel better about themselves . Conversely , during an informal Twitter poll conducted by one Kotaku reporter , respondents described him as " annoying " and an " obnoxious waste of time . " PewDiePie has also been received negatively by the media on some occasions , often being reported as an " inexplicable phenomenon . " Andrew Wallenstein of Variety heavily criticised PewDiePie , following his channel becoming the most subscribed channel on YouTube , describing his videos as " aggressive stupidity " and " psycho babble . " Rolling Stone has documented the existence of several Reddit threads dedicated to sharing disparaging views of PewDiePie . 
 According to a 2014 survey commissioned by Variety , PewDiePie along with a few other YouTube personalities have been reported to be more influential and popular than mainstream celebrities , such as Jennifer Lawrence , among U.S. teenagers aged 13 through 18 . His channel also appeals strongly to younger viewers , a group Google refers to as Generation C for their habits of " creation , curation , connection and community " . Paul Tassi of Forbes wrote , " PewDiePie combines charisma , energy and all @-@ around randomness to create a goofball character with videos that make little sense to outsiders , but are catnip to his younger fanbase . " Chris Reed of The Wall St. Cheat Sheet commented on the divisive opinions on PewDiePie : " The great divide in opinion on PewDiePie seems to be largely generational . Older people are less likely to subscribe to YouTube channels , or to pay much credence to YouTube personalities in general . Many younger viewers , on the other hand , see him as endlessly entertaining and relatable . " 
 PewDiePie has himself claimed that he dislikes being called " famous " , and has been reported to live a " shy and retiring life . " In a Rolling Stone article , PewDiePie admitted to being shocked by his fame ; PewDiePie recalled a gaming event near his hometown , stating " I remember there were five security guards yelling at a crowd to back up — it was out of control . It was shocking to find myself in that situation , where I was that celebrity person . " At the 2013 Social Star Awards , PewDiePie greeted his fans personally despite security warning him against doing so . PewDiePie also mentioned this event to Rolling Stone , stating , " I didn 't even understand they were screaming for me at first . " 
 His rise to fame has been used as " a great example of how the emerging society gives extensive opportunities to individuals with great ideas , courage , and , of course , a significant portion of luck as opposed to the old society . " Studies of the gaming community on YouTube have shown that 95 % of gamers engage in watching online videos related to gaming and has been noted as an important reason for PewDiePie 's popularity . In 2015 , PewDiePie was included on Time 's list of the 30 most influential people on the Internet , cementing his influence as an internet personality . Later in 2015 , PewDiePie was featured on the cover of Variety 's " <unk> " issue , with the magazine ranking him as the " # 1 <unk> " , or " those whose influence stands head and shoulders above the rest . "

 PewDiePie 's commentaries have had a positive effect on sales of indie games . For instance the developers of McPixel stated , " The largest force driving attention to McPixel at that time were ' Let 's Play ' videos . Mostly by Jesse Cox and PewDiePie . " PewDiePie has also been confirmed to positively influence the sales of Slender : The Eight Pages and Goat Simulator . Although games being featured on PewDiePie 's channel have reportedly contributed to their commercial success , he has stated , " I just want to play the games , not influence sales . " 
 PewDiePie , along with characters from Amnesia : The Dark Descent , which PewDiePie renamed and made characters within his own commentaries were referenced to by a McPixel level designed in his honour . Additionally , in the video game Surgeon Simulator 2013 , the Alien Surgery stage features an organ called " <unk> " in honour of PewDiePie . PewDiePie agreed to allow the developers of Surgeon Simulator 2013 to use his likeness in GOTY <unk> , a showering simulation video game . PewDiePie was also included as a NPC in the indie game , Party Hard .

 In June 2014 , The Wall Street Journal reported that PewDiePie earned $ 4 million in 2013 ; PewDiePie confirmed on Reddit that the figures were roughly around what he actually earned . In July 2014 , the Swedish newspaper Expressen reported that PewDiePie 's production company , <unk> Productions AB , reported earnings of 63 @.@ 7 million kr ( $ 7 @.@ 5 million ) in 2014 . The Guardian commented that the reason the media was so captivated by PewDiePie 's earnings is that the topic " offers a rare insight into the money being made at the top end of YouTube stardom , " adding " it ’ s very rare for any YouTube creator to talk about their earnings publicly , not least because YouTube itself does not encourage it " . Although outlets agreed that PewDiePie 's income was sizable , and even " remarkable " , PewDiePie appeared at the top of Forbes ' October 2015 list of the richest YouTube stars with a reported $ 12 million earned in 2015 . Relating to the earnings , Forbes commented that " $ 7 million may well seem like an astronomical figure to a 25 year @-@ old who just wants to make friends and play videogames , but it ’ s a wildly insubstantial figure for the size of his audience and influence . " 
 On the topic of his earnings , PewDiePie stated that he is " extremely tired of talking about how much I make . In the very few interviews I 've made , it doesn 't matter how long we 've talked to each other , the headline is still just about my paycheck . " After extensive media coverage of his earnings , Kjellberg posted a video , expressing his frustration at the extensive media coverage over his income . In the video he claimed , " We did raise a million dollars for charity , and very few articles picked up on that , but here it is everywhere how much money I make , " adding , " It seems like the whole world cares more about how much money I make than I do myself . " Relating to his source of his income , PewDiePie stated : " I think that 's what 's cool about YouTube : That anyone could technically do it , right ? Surely if I didn 't exist , there would be someone to fill my place . "

 Beginning in April 2014 and spanning into August , Kjellberg , along with his girlfriend Marzia Bisognin , began a marketing campaign for the Legendary Pictures film As Above , So Below . Kjellberg 's videos for the marketing campaign included a miniseries featuring him participating in the " Catacombs Challenge " . The challenge involved Kjellberg searching for three keys in the catacombs to open a container holding " the Philosopher 's stone . " Kjellberg and Bisognin 's videos were able to earn nearly 20 million views . Maker Studios , which Kjellberg and Bisognin are represented by , brokered the ad deal between the two and Legendary Pictures . In January 2015 , Mountain Dew partnered with PewDiePie to launch a fan fiction contest , in which winning fan fictions will be animated into video formats and then uploaded onto his channel . In the same month , a quote from him was used by <unk> on Dying Light posters . The quote , which read , " I love this game . It 's sooo awesome ! " , spread controversy as it came from a seemingly <unk> video , featuring him playing Dying Light . In response to the issue , PewDiePie tweeted , " I love this game . It 's <unk> awesome ! - IGN . " When another Twitter user mentioned the issue , tagging PewDiePie in their tweet , he responded , " I dont even remember saying this . " 
 Despite these partnerships , PewDiePie maintains that he conducts very few promotions and works with few brands . Additionally , PewDiePie posted on Reddit , " I make more than I need from YouTube , " adding , " with that freedom , but also to respect my fans for making that possible , I don 't end up doing many endorsements . " On this topic , PewDiePie has claimed that it is disappointing when a large chunk of people misinterpret a component of his character ; he states , " if I mention on Twitter that I find this or that Kickstarter project cool , people immediately start to ask what economical interests I might have in it . Things like that can bring me down . But it 's not personal ; some people just prefer to believe the worst about others at any given time . "

 PewDiePie 's channel is under Polaris , a gaming network , part of Maker Studios , a multi @-@ channel network that drives the growth of the channels under it . Despite being signed under a network , PewDiePie refuses to hire an editor to help him with his video output , stating " I want YouTube to be YouTube . " 
 PewDiePie has expressed disdain with Machinima , a rival YouTube network that he had been signed with prior to Maker Studios . Feeling frustrated with how Machinima treated him , PewDiePie hired a lawyer to free him from his contract with the network . 
 In October 2014 , PewDiePie began hinting at the possibility that he might not renew his contract with Maker Studios upon its expiration in December 2014 . Reports that covered this information also added that PewDiePie expressed his frustrations with the studio 's parent company , Disney ; PewDiePie was quoted saying , " The fact that Disney bought Maker Studios doesn 't really change anything for me . If I ask for help , they reply , but that 's all the contact we have . We 'll see what happens . " Rather than re @-@ sign with Maker , PewDiePie has mulled the option of launching his own network , although he has declined to provide in @-@ depth details on the subject . However , in light of news outlets reporting his disinterest with Maker , PewDiePie tweeted , " I feel like I was misquoted in the WSJ and I 'm really happy with the work that Maker has been doing for me . " PewDiePie ultimately continued creating videos under Maker ; his relationship with the network has seen Maker establish an official PewDiePie website , app and online store to sell Bro Army merchandise , while PewDiePie promotes Maker 's media interests and gives the network a share of his YouTube ad revenue . 
 In early 2015 , Nintendo launched its Creator Program , in order to share revenue with YouTube video creators who feature gameplay of their products in videos . PewDiePie joined various gamers in criticising the programme . PewDiePie called the program a , " slap in the face to the YouTube channels that does focus on Nintendo game exclusively , adding , " The people who have helped and showed passion for Nintendo 's community are the ones left in the dirt the most . " Despite criticisms from PewDiePie and other gamers alike , Nintendo experienced more requests from YouTube creators than expected , causing an extension on the 72 @-@ hour wait time for video approval through the program . Additionally , PewDiePie , stated , " I 'll still play Nintendo games that I want to play on my channel as usual . I 'm lucky to be in a situation where losing ad revenue on a few videos won 't matter . However , many people on YouTube are not in that situation . " Ultimately , the focal point of criticism is toward the approval of a video which Nintendo has to administer , and may be motivated by biased intentions .

 = Pennard Castle = 
 Pennard Castle is a ruined castle , near the village of Pennard in the Gower Peninsula , in south Wales . The castle was built in the early 12th century as a timber ringwork following the Norman invasion of Wales . The walls were rebuilt in stone by the Braose family at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries , including a stone gatehouse . Soon afterwards , however , encroaching sand dunes caused the site to be abandoned and it fell into ruin . Restoration work was carried out during the course of the 20th century and the remains of the castle are now protected under UK law as a Grade II * listed building . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 13th @-@ 14th centuries = = = 
 The Normans began to make incursions into South Wales from the late @-@ 1060s onwards , pushing westwards from their bases in recently occupied England . Their advance was marked by the construction of castles and the creation of regional lordships . Pennard Castle was built at the start of the 12th century after Henry de Beaumont , the Earl of Warwick , conquered the Gower Peninsula and made Pennard one of his demesne manors . 
 The castle was constructed on a limestone spur , overlooking the mouth of the Pennard Pill stream and Three Cliffs Bay , and was protected to the north and west by surrounding cliffs . The fortification initially took the form of an oval @-@ shaped ringwork , 34 by 28 metres ( 112 by 92 ft ) , with an defensive ditch and ramparts around the outside , and a timber hall in the centre . A local church , St Mary 's , was built just to the east and a settlement grew up around the site ; a rabbit warren was established in the nearby sand dunes . In the early 13th century , a simple stone hall , approximately 18 @.@ 6 by 7 @.@ 6 metres ( 61 by 25 ft ) , was built on the site of the older timber building , using red @-@ purple sandstone with white limestone detailing . 
 Around the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries , while the castle was controlled by William and his son , also called William , the timber defences were replaced . A thin stone curtain wall , approximately 8 metres ( 26 ft ) tall with battlements , replaced the palisades , with the mural defences including a square tower on a rocky spur on the west side , and a circular tower on the north @-@ west corner . A gatehouse was built as the new entrance , with two half @-@ circular towers that possibly imitated those of regional castles such as Caerphilly ; it was weakly defended by a portcullis and a handful of arrow loops . The new walls were built from a mixture of red sandstone rubble , probably quarried locally , and limestone dug from the castle site itself . The <unk> may have rebuilt Pennard as a replacement for their castle at nearby <unk> which was abandoned at around the same time due to encroaching sand dunes . 
 = = = 16th @-@ 21st centuries = = = 
 Pennard Castle also began to suffer from sand dune encroachment and the castle and its settlement were gradually abandoned . A survey in 1650 described the fortification as being " desolate and ruinous " and surrounded by sand . By 1741 , the castle 's south wall had mostly collapsed but the remainder of the castle was apparently still generally intact , although it had suffered further losses by 1795 . It was a popular subject for engravings , sketches and paintings from the 18th century onwards , with the view of the ruins from the east proving particularly popular . By 1879 , large cracks had appeared in the southern tower of the gatehouse , which led to its partial collapse . 
 By 1922 , concerns had grown about the condition of the castle and discussions took place between the <unk> Golf Club , who owned the site , the Royal Institution and the Cambrian Archaeological Association . A joint committee was formed to raise the funds for repairs to the stonework but the costs appear to have been excessive and instead the gatehouse was patched with concrete between 1923 and 1924 . Much of the remaining southern wall collapsed at the beginning of 1960 and an archaeological survey was conducted between 1960 and 1961 . Urgent masonry repairs were then carried out in 1963 , paid for by a combination of the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works , the Gower Society , the golf club and a public appeal launched by local newspapers . 
 In the 21st century , the ruins of the gatehouse still survive , reaching up to the battlements on its east side , partially because it was built with very strong mortar . Parts of the curtain wall survive , mainly on the north and east sides , now around 1 @.@ 1 metres ( 3 ft 7 in ) thick and averaging 5 metres ( 16 ft ) tall , along with the remains of the square mural tower . The ruins are protected under UK law as a grade II * listed building and a scheduled ancient monument . 
 = Iron Rattler = 
 Iron Rattler is a steel roller coaster located at Six Flags Fiesta Texas in San Antonio , Texas . The ride opened in 2013 , replacing The Rattler , a wooden roller coaster , by putting a new steel track on top of The Rattler 's wooden support structure . The distance between the lowest and highest points of the first drop was increased from 124 to 171 feet ( 38 to 52 m ) and the drop was made steeper by changing the angle to 81 degrees . The resulting modifications increased the speed of the trains from 65 to 70 miles per hour ( 105 to 113 km / h ) . It is the first hybrid wood and steel roller coaster to feature an inversion , in which riders are turned upside @-@ down and then back upright . The inversion is a barrel roll , which is when the train goes through a combination of a loop and a roll . 
 The Iron Rattler was designed by Alan Schilke and built by Rocky Mountain Construction . The wooden Rattler had been constructed by Roller Coaster Corporation of America . When it opened in 1992 , it was the tallest and fastest wooden coaster in the world , with a height of 179 feet ( 55 m ) , a first drop of 166 feet ( 51 m ) and a top speed of 73 mph ( 117 km / h ) .

 Six Flags Fiesta Texas announced in August 2012 , that they would be revamping their wooden coaster , The Rattler , into a steel track coaster , to be called Iron Rattler . The renovation would be performed by Rocky Mountain Construction and would feature the I @-@ Box steel track on some of the original wooden coaster supports , Rattler @-@ themed trains supplied by Gerstlauer , and a barrel roll . The new ride would open for the 2013 season . 
 The Rattler had been constructed by Roller Coaster Corporation of America . When the coaster debuted on March 14 , 1992 , it was the tallest and fastest wooden coaster in the world , with a height of 179 feet ( 55 m ) , a first drop of 166 feet ( 51 m ) and a top speed of 73 mph ( 117 km / h ) , outdoing its then rival , Mean Streak at Ohio 's Cedar Point . Designer John Pierce stated that the original plans kept changing as park co @-@ developers Gaylord Entertainment Company insisted on having the tallest wooden coaster in the world . It held this title until 1994 , when its first drop was shortened from 166 to 124 feet ( 51 to 38 m ) , resulting in a reduction of its top speed from 73 to 65 miles per hour ( 117 to 105 km / h ) . 
 In late 2009 , Six Flags Over Texas closed their Texas Giant wooden roller coaster for a $ 10 million renovation which took more than a year to complete . Idaho @-@ firm Rocky Mountain Construction replaced the wooden track with a new steel I @-@ Box track , retaining a wooden support structure . The refurbishment was ultimately a success with " resoundingly positive reviews from riders " . The park 's parent company , Six Flags , immediately began looking for other rides in its chain which would benefit from a similar overhaul . 
 At the IAAPA 2011 Trade Show , Alan Schilke of Rocky Mountain Construction revealed their company had two projects that they would be working on for 2013 openings – one of which was an I @-@ Box conversion of a wooden roller coaster . It was later revealed by the Spokane Journal of Business that The Rattler would be completely refurbished in 2013 with new track and trains in a manner similar to that used by the company on the New Texas Giant at Six Flags Over Texas in 2011 . Although Six Flags had not publicly confirmed their plans , the park announced that The Rattler would close on August 5 , 2012 . At the end of the operating day on August 5 , 2012 , park personnel and select enthusiasts took the final ride , after which , The Rattler , as a wood coaster , ceased operation . 
 The National Roller Coaster Museum and Archives announced on April 16 , 2013 , they would be auctioning off the first ride of Iron Rattler on the evening of May 17 , 2013 , and proceeds going towards the museum . Also a soft @-@ opening was held to the media on May 15 , 2013 . The grand opening of the Iron Rattler was May 25 , 2013 . 
 After the deadly incident on the New Texas Giant on July 19 , 2013 , and because the two rides share several similarities , Six Flags Fiesta Texas had ceased running Iron Rattler pending investigation findings from its sister park . In under a month , Iron Rattler reopened on August 14 with seat belts as another added restraint to the two trains . 
 = = Characteristics = = 
 Iron Rattler is located in the Western @-@ themed <unk> Canyon area of Fiesta Texas , sitting next to the Road Runner Express and The Gully Washer . It is Rocky Mountain Construction 's second installation of I @-@ Box track , and the first to feature a barrel roll inversion . Iron Rattler operates with two Rattler @-@ themed trains manufactured by Gerstlauer . Each train is made up of six cars which seat riders in two rows of two . Riders are restrained through the use of a lap bar and a seat belt . 
 The table below compares the original Rattler , with the updated Iron Rattler ride . The original ride by the Roller Coaster Corporation of America was approximately 1 @,@ 800 feet ( 550 m ) longer due to a 900 ° helix atop the quarry walls . The refurbished ride by Rocky Mountain Construction features a steeper and longer first drop , thus achieving a faster speed . 
 = = Ride experience = = 
 The ride begins by exiting out of the station and turning around under Road Runner Express . It ascends a 179 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 55 m ) chain lift hill , before dropping 171 feet ( 52 m ) at an angle of 81 ° . The track then ascends to the top of the quarry wall where it enters a 110 ° over @-@ banked turn . A 95 ° over @-@ banked turn leads to the left , back off the quarry wall . The ride then rises into the zero @-@ g roll which sits atop the quarry wall . A camelback hill is followed by two more over @-@ banked turns measuring 98 ° and 93 ° , respectively . The ride then drops back off the quarry wall and enters a tunnel near its base . The tunnel features fog and lighting effects . After exiting the tunnel , the train enters brake run and returns to the station . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Iron Rattler has generally been well received . Keith Miller of <unk> Magazine described the ride as " wonderfully smooth " highlighting the slow cresting of the lift hill as an " enjoyable element " . He concludes by stating " there 's not one restful moment on this ride " . Arthur Levine of About.com gave the ride 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 stars . Levine applauded Six Flags for replacing a bad wooden roller coaster with " a wonderful , remarkably smooth , thoroughly fun and enjoyable ride " . He also gives kudos to Rocky Mountain Construction who manufactured the I @-@ Box track and redesigned the ride . Brenda Solis of <unk> described the ride as " the most intense , craziest roller coaster ever " . She also compared the renovated ride to the original ride , stating " the old Rattler wasn 't as scary or intense or fast as the new one " . 
 Before Iron Rattler 's debut year , Rattler was only ranked once in the Amusement Today 's Golden Ticket Awards for the 2011 Top 50 Wooden Coasters ranked at 47 in the world , since the creation of the award in 1998 . After the renovation in 2013 , Iron Rattler was ranked highly by the voters . The ride was ranked the second @-@ best new ride of 2013 with 19 % of the vote . It also ranked at position 11 for the world 's best steel roller coasters its debut year .

In high school , he had been a Detroit Free Press first @-@ team All @-@ State ( Michigan ) and second @-@ team All @-@ Midwest selection in football and an All @-@ American in lacrosse . 
 After retiring from professional football as a player , he gained his first two years of coaching experience as the defensive coordinator for Michigan High School Athletic Association football champion Brother Rice High School ( his high school alma mater ) . He then served as an assistant coach at the University of Michigan for three years . He then assumed a role as an assistant at Western Michigan University . At Western Michigan , he has served as the linebacker coach after spending a year as the defensive line coach . The 2009 Western Michigan Broncos season marked Morrison 's fifth season on the team 's staff , his fourth as linebacker coach and his second as defensive coordinator . Morrison was fired at the conclusion of the season .

 Barbara Morrison , Steve 's mother , says Steve was read his last rites on the day of his birth because he had the same lung disease that Patrick Kennedy , the son of United States President John Kennedy , died from . He was then put in an incubator where his mother could not touch him for 12 months . Morrison wanted to be a linebacker because of the tenacity of the position . His favorite book was a book about Jack Lambert and Jack Ham and he grew up a Pittsburgh Steelers fan . He played soccer when he was a youth .

 Morrison competed for Brother Rice High School of the Detroit , Michigan Catholic High School League . As a junior who played both fullback and linebacker , he was sidelined for the remainder of the season with a knee injury in his third game , but the team went 7 – 2 for the season despite his injury . As a senior , Morrison was part of a 1989 team that lost in the Class A semifinals 6 – 0 to Martin Luther King High School at Atwood Stadium . The team had been ranked as the number three high school team in the Metro Detroit Area by the Detroit Free Press in its pre @-@ season poll . Morrison had been hailed as a blue chip athlete entering his senior season in the same pre @-@ season summary . The team was 11 – 0 and the number one ranked area high school team prior to the loss . Once , Morrison executed an 82 @-@ yard punt during a high school game . During his senior season , his coach , Al Fracassa , was the Detroit Free Press Coach of the Year and Morrison was a First @-@ Team All @-@ Metro Detroit selection at linebacker . However , fellow fullback / linebacker two @-@ way Detroit area player Jerome Bettis was the first team fullback . Both players earned first @-@ team Detroit Free Press All @-@ State honors . However , a poll of 14 experts selected Bettis first @-@ team all @-@ Midwest ( Big Ten States of Illinois , Indiana , Iowa , Michigan , Minnesota , Ohio and Wisconsin because Penn State had not yet joined the conference ) , but only selected Morrison second @-@ team all Midwest . In high school , Morrison was an All @-@ American in lacrosse , along with Brother Rice and Michigan football teammate Gannon <unk> . He was a Catholic High School League Hall of Fame athlete and was inducted in the 1995 Hall of Fame class that included Shawn Respert , among others . 
 = = = College = = = 
 After attending Brother Rice High School in Bloomfield Hills , Michigan , his college decision eventually came down to a choice between Michigan and Michigan State University . He was part of a highly touted Michigan recruiting class that was ranked fourth in the nation and that included five of the top twelve players in the state and seven of the top twelve regional players . He spent five years at the University of Michigan where he anchored the defense as an inside linebacker . In 1990 , he was the first true freshman to start on defense since 1987 . In his 1991 debut for Michigan against the Boston College Eagles , he opposed former Brother Rice teammate Pete Mitchell , who was appearing in his first game . On Mitchell 's first career catch , Morrison was warned for making a late hit against Mitchell . A total of seven Brother Rice alumni played in the game . He became a rare five @-@ year varsity letter winner while wearing # 36 for the Michigan Wolverines football program from 1990 to 1994 , He was mentored by 1991 Butkus Award winner Erick Anderson . He helped the 1990 three @-@ peat Big Ten Conference Champions defend their title for a total of five consecutive conference championships ending in 1992 . The 1991 and 1992 teams went to the Rose Bowl . During the 1992 season , he replaced Anderson , who had led Michigan in tackles four consecutive seasons , as the defensive signal caller . He was named the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week after making 15 tackles against Purdue Boilermakers on October 31 , 1992 . 
 He became team captain in 1994 for coach Gary Moeller . On a team that had two All @-@ Americans ( Ty Law and Remy Hamilton ) , he was one of six All @-@ Big Ten players ( Law , Hamilton , Tyrone Wheatley , Amani Toomer and Jason Horn ) and a Butkus Award semifinalist . Morrison earned his bachelor 's degree in sports management and communications in 1994 from Michigan . 
 At the time of his graduation , he ranked third in career tackles in school history , behind Anderson and Ron Simpkins . He has since been passed by Jarrett Irons and Sam Sword , and he stands fifth with 220 tackles . In terms of tackles and assists combined , Morrison once totaled 23 in a November 14 , 1992 game against the Illinois Fighting Illini football team , which stands as a Michigan Football record for a game at Michigan Stadium . Morrison suffered compartmental syndrome in his calf , which necessitated surgical repair to stop internal bleeding , during his 1990 freshman season , for which he earned a medical redshirt season by the NCAA . As a sophomore ( redshirt freshman ) , he sat out four games with a broken leg . In 1993 , he missed the first seven games with a broken foot .

 He was not drafted in the 1995 NFL draft , but signed with the Indianapolis Colts as a free agent after the draft . He played with the Colts from 1995 to 1998 . He accumulated 2 quarterback sacks , 2 interceptions , and 4 fumble recoveries . Although the Colts best records during his tenure was 9 – 7 in both 1995 and 1996 , the team made the playoffs twice and Morrison had a chance to play in an American Football Conference Championship game . During the 1995 – 1996 NFL playoffs , the Colts won two playoff games on the road under Ted <unk> to reach the championship game against the Pittsburgh Steelers . Despite the playoff success , they changed coaches , as Lindy Infante took them back to the 1996 – 1997 NFL playoffs with a 9 – 7 record , only to fall in the wild card game to the Steelers again . Morrison started 31 games over the course of his career , including 29 regular season games . In 1997 and 1998 , the team had losing seasons , although Morrison started more games as his career progressed . Morrison was signed by the Detroit Lions for the 1999 NFL season , but he was waived before the season started .

 In 2005 , he took the Western Michigan defensive line coaching position on new head coach Bill Cubit 's staff . That same year , Scott Shafer assumed the defensive coordinator position at Western Michigan , and Morrison served under him . Then , in 2006 , Morrison assumed the linebacker coach position . The defense immediately produced results : # 1 in the country in interceptions , # 1 in sacks per game , and a Mid @-@ American Conference record rushing yards per game defense . In addition to the team numbers he fostered Ameer Ismail , the nation 's leader in quarterback sacks and tackles for a loss . 
 On March 12 , 2008 , after defensive coordinator Bill Miller left to be the Louisville Cardinals football linebacker coach , Western Michigan promoted Morrison to defensive coordinator , and he relinquished his recruiting coordinator role to tight ends coach Jake Moreland . He continued to serve as the linebackers coach in 2008 . He converted the defensive scheme from a two @-@ gap scheme to a one @-@ gap scheme upon taking over as defensive coordinator . His coaching style is considered a compromise between styles of the previous coordinators : the highly enthusiastic Shafer style and the laid back Miller style . The 2008 Western Michigan Broncos football team compiled a 9 – 3 ( 6 – 2 conference ) record earning them a trip to the 2008 Texas Bowl to face the Rice Owls . His defense ranked toward the middle of the MAC . Rice blew out Western Michigan by taking a 38 – 0 lead before allowing two late fourth quarter touchdowns for a 38 – 14 final score . On the eve of the Bowl game , the Broncos signed head coach Cubit to a five @-@ year extension and there was no indication he intended to make any changes in his staff . Morrison 's 2008 defense produced first @-@ team All @-@ MAC selection Louis Delmas , who appeared in the January 24 , 2009 Senior Bowl and was the first safety chosen in the 2009 NFL Draft .

 = Tropical Storm Kiko ( 2007 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Kiko was a strong tropical storm that capsized a boat off the western coast of Mexico , killing at least 15 people . The 15th and final tropical cyclone of the 2007 Pacific hurricane season , Kiko developed out of a tropical wave that formed off the coast of Africa on September 26 and traversed the Atlantic . The wave crossed over Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on October 8 , where it spawned Tropical Depression 15 @-@ E on October 15 . The depression drifted to the south over the next day before briefly being declared Tropical Storm Kiko . It subsequently weakened into a tropical depression , but later reattained tropical storm intensity . By October 18 , Kiko was forecast to make landfall along the western Mexican coastline as a moderate tropical storm . However , the cyclone turned to the west and reached its peak intensity of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) on October 20 . The tropical storm slowly weakened to a remnant low @-@ pressure area by October 24 and completely dissipated on October 27 without making landfall . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave exited the western coast of Africa on September 26 , quickly spawning an area of low pressure . Upon the formation of the low , the wave split into two pieces and a second area of low pressure developed along the southern portion of the wave as it traveled west . The northern low quickly developed , spawning Tropical Depression Fourteen on September 28 . The southern low attached to the wave failed to develop and moved away from the intensifying tropical depression . It continued through the Atlantic , entering the Pacific Ocean , after crossing Central America , on October 8 . A broad area of low pressure accompanied by showers and thunderstorms developed along the wave around 275 miles ( 440 kilometres ) south of Acapulco , Mexico . However , the low remained disorganized because of strong upper @-@ level winds . On October 13 , the low became better organized due to a relaxation in the shear . The low developed enough convection late on October 14 to be declared Tropical Depression Fifteen @-@ E while located about 435 mi ( 705 km ) southwest of Colima , Mexico . 
 The depression was embedded within a broad , low @-@ level cyclone with weak steering currents that caused Fifteen @-@ E to drift southward for the next 30 hours . On October 16 , strong easterly wind shear exposed the center of the depression from shower and thunderstorm activity . However , a curving convective band developed around the system , and satellites detected winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . This prompted the National Hurricane Center to upgrade the depression to Tropical Storm Kiko as it drifted about 430 mi ( 695 km ) southwest of Manzanillo , Mexico . The intensification was short @-@ lived , and Kiko was downgraded to a tropical depression six hours later when the center separated from diminishing convection . On October 17 , the storm was upgraded to a tropical storm when the low became associated with deep convection . The center remained poorly defined , and winds of tropical storm @-@ force blew only in Kiko 's southwest quadrant . Over the next few days , Kiko moved slowly towards the east @-@ northeast as a minimal tropical storm and was forecast to either brush land or to make landfall along the Mexican coast on October 19 or October 20 . However , early on October 19 , Kiko turned to the northwest when a high @-@ pressure ridge developed over Mexico . Forecasters predicted that the storm would become a strong Category 1 hurricane as it turned away from Mexico and headed to sea . 
 As the ridge pushed the storm away from the coast , weaker wind shear and warm sea @-@ surface temperatures allowed Kiko to gradually intensify . The storm reached its peak intensity of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) 991 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 28 inHg ) late on October 20 while located around 175 mi ( 280 km ) west @-@ southwest of Manzanillo , Mexico . As it moved away from the coast , an eye began to form . Shortly thereafter , shear increased and began to separate the low from the deep convection . By the afternoon of October 21 , the storm was poorly organized and the center was partially exposed . At this time , the weakening system had winds sustained at 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . Early on October 22 , a brief burst in showers and thunderstorms allowed the storm to maintain its intensity . That evening , Kiko was downgraded to a tropical depression as strong wind shear removed convection from the storm 's center and exposed the low . As the depression moved over a dryer and more hostile area , two inhibiting factors for development of tropical cyclones , it slowly weakened . It lost almost all convection and degenerated to a remnant low @-@ pressure area on October 23 , and the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory that night . The remnant low moved west before dissipating on October 27 over open waters . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 On October 18 , a tropical storm warning was issued along the Mexican coastline from Zihuatanejo , Guerrero to Manzanillo , Colima , and a tropical storm watch extended northward to La Fortuna , Mexico , as Kiko was forecast to make landfall in that region on October 21 . Above @-@ normal tides and dangerous waves were expected along the coast . Rainfall totals of 4 inches ( 100 millimetres ) to 7 in ( 180 mm ) were possible over southwestern Mexico with isolated totals reaching 10 in ( 250 mm ) . As a precaution , port captains shut down shipping and advised residents to avoid low @-@ lying areas that might flood . Civil Defense advised these residents to move to temporary shelters and tourists were told to stay indoors . Emergency procedures were on standby in case conditions became more threatening . 
 As the storm neared land , a ridge over Mexico prevented Kiko from coming ashore , resulting in far less damage than forecast . As Kiko traveled parallel to the coast , heavy rain affected the region for two days . In Kiko 's rough seas off the coast of Mexico , a ship capsized with twenty @-@ five passengers and crew . Continued effects from Kiko hampered rescue efforts , forcing officials to call off the rescue attempt . Authorities searched the beaches of San Francisco <unk> and San Francisco del Mar for any signs of the ship . Only two people survived ; fifteen bodies were recovered , and nine passengers were never found . 
 = Cædwalla of Wessex = 
 Cædwalla / <unk> / ( c . 659 – 20 April 689 ) was the King of Wessex from approximately 685 until he abdicated in 688 . His name is derived from the British Cadwallon . He was exiled from Wessex as a youth and during his exile gathered forces and attacked the South Saxons , killing their king , Æthelwealh , in what is now Sussex . Cædwalla was unable to hold the South Saxon territory , however , and was driven out by Æthelwealh 's ealdormen . In either 685 or 686 he became King of Wessex . He may have been involved in suppressing rival dynasties at this time , as an early source records that Wessex was ruled by underkings until Cædwalla . 
 After his accession Cædwalla returned to Sussex and won the territory again , and also conquered the Isle of Wight , engaging in genocide and extinguishing the ruling dynasty there and forcing the population of the island at sword point to renounce their pagan beliefs for Christianity . He gained control of Surrey and the kingdom of Kent , and in 686 he installed his brother , Mul , as king of Kent . Mul was burned in a Kentish revolt a year later , and Cædwalla returned , possibly ruling Kent directly for a period . 
 Cædwalla was wounded during the conquest of the Isle of Wight , and perhaps for this reason he abdicated in 688 to travel to Rome for baptism . He reached Rome in April 689 , and was baptised by Pope Sergius I on the Saturday before Easter , dying ten days later on 20 April 689 . He was succeeded by Ine . 
 = = West Saxon territory in the 680s = = 
 In the late 7th century , the West Saxons occupied an area in the west of southern England , though the exact boundaries are difficult to define . To their west was the native British kingdom of Dumnonia , in what is now Devon and Cornwall . To the north were the Mercians , whose king , Wulfhere , had dominated southern England during his reign . In 674 he was succeeded by his brother , Æthelred , who was less militarily active than Wulfhere had been along the frontier with Wessex , though the West Saxons did not recover the territorial gains Wulfhere had made . To the southeast was the kingdom of the South Saxons , in what is now Sussex ; and to the east were the East Saxons , who controlled London . 
 Not all the locations named in the Chronicle can be identified , but it is apparent that the West Saxons were fighting in north Somerset , south Gloucestershire , and north Wiltshire , against both British and Mercian opposition . To the west and south , evidence of the extent of West Saxon influence is provided by the fact that Cenwalh , who reigned from 642 to 673 , is remembered as the first Saxon patron of Sherborne Abbey , in Dorset ; similarly , Centwine ( 676 – 685 ) is the first Saxon patron of Glastonbury , in Somerset . Evidently these monasteries were in West Saxon territory by then . Exeter , to the west , in Devon , was under West Saxon control by 680 , since Boniface was educated there at about that time . 
 = = Ancestry = = 
 Bede states that Cædwalla was a " daring young man of the royal house of the <unk> " , and gives his age at his death in 689 as about thirty , making the year of his birth about 659 . " Gewisse " , a tribal name , is used by Bede as an equivalent to " West Saxon " : the West Saxon genealogies trace back to one " <unk> " , an invented eponymous ancestor . According to the Chronicle , Cædwalla was the son of <unk> , and was descended via Ceawlin from Cerdic , who was the first of the Gewisse to land in England . However , it appears that the many difficulties and contradictions in the regnal list are caused partly by the efforts of later scribes to demonstrate that each king on the list was descended from Cerdic ; thus Cædwalla 's genealogy must be treated with caution . His name is an Anglicised form of the British name " Cadwallon " , which may indicate British ( Brythonic ) ancestry . 
 = = First campaign in Sussex = = 
 The first mention of Cædwalla is in the Life of St Wilfrid , in which he is described as an exiled nobleman in the forests of Chiltern and <unk> . It was not uncommon for a 7th @-@ century king to have spent time in exile before gaining the throne ; Oswald of Northumbria is another prominent example . According to the Chronicle , it was in 685 that Cædwalla " began to contend for the kingdom " . Despite his exile , he was able to put together enough military force to defeat and kill Æthelwealh , the king of Sussex . He was , however , soon expelled by <unk> and <unk> , Æthelwealh 's ealdormen , " who administered the country from then on " , possibly as kings . 
 The Isle of Wight and the Meon valley in what is now eastern Hampshire had been placed under Æthelwealh 's control by Wulfhere ; the Chronicle dates this to 661 , but according to Bede it occurred " not long before " Wilfrid 's mission to the South Saxons in the 680s , which implies a rather later date . Wulfhere 's attack on Ashdown , also dated by the Chronicle to 661 , may likewise have actually happened later . If these events happened in the early 680s or not long before , Cædwalla 's aggression against Æthelwealh would be explained as a response to Mercian pressure . 
 Another indication of the political and military situation may be the division in the 660s of the West Saxon see at Dorchester ; a new see was established at Winchester , very near to the South Saxon border . Bede 's explanation for the division is that Cenwalh grew tired of the Frankish speech of the bishop at Dorchester , but it is more likely that it was a response to the Mercian advance , which forced West Saxon expansion , such as Cædwalla 's military activities , west , south , and east , rather than north . Cædwalla 's military successes may be the reason that at about this time the term " West Saxon " starts to be used in contemporary sources , instead of " Gewisse " . It is from this time that the West Saxons began to rule over other Anglo @-@ Saxon peoples . 
 = = Accession and reign = = 
 In 685 or 686 , Cædwalla became king of the West Saxons after Centwine , his predecessor , retired to a monastery . Bede gives Cædwalla a reign of two years , ending in 688 , but if his reign was less than three years then he may have come to the throne in 685 . The West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List gives his reign a length of three years , with one variant reading of two years . 
 According to Bede , before Cædwalla 's reign , Wessex was ruled by underkings , who were conquered and removed when Cædwalla became king . This has been taken to mean that Cædwalla himself ended the reign of the underkings , though Bede does not directly say this . Bede gives the death of Cenwalh as the start of the ten @-@ year period in which the West Saxons were ruled by these underkings ; Cenwalh is now thought to have died in about 673 , so this is slightly inconsistent with Cædwalla 's dates . It may be that Centwine , Cædwalla 's predecessor as king of the West Saxons , began as a co @-@ ruler but established himself as sole king by the time Cædwalla became king . It may also be that the underkings were another dynastic faction of the West Saxon royal line , vying for power with Centwine and Cædwalla ; the description of them as " underkings " may be due to a partisan description of the situation by Bishop Daniel of Winchester , who was Bede 's primary informant on West Saxon events . It is also possible that not all the underkings were deposed . There is a King <unk> , who reigned in the area of Somerset and West Wiltshire , who is mentioned in two land @-@ grants , one dated 681 and the other 688 , though both documents have been treated as spurious by some historians . Further confusing the situation is another land @-@ grant , thought to be genuine , showing Ine 's father , Cenred , still reigning in Wessex after Ine 's accession . 
 Once on the throne , Cædwalla attacked the South Saxons again , this time killing <unk> , and " the province was reduced to a worse state of subjection " . He also conquered the Isle of Wight , which was still an independent pagan kingdom , and set himself to kill every native on the island , resettling it with his own people . <unk> , the king of the Isle of Wight , left his two young brothers as heirs . They fled the island , but were found at Stoneham , in Hampshire , and killed on Cædwalla 's orders , though he was persuaded by a priest to let them be baptised before they were executed . Bede also mentions that Cædwalla was wounded ; he was recovering from his wounds when the priest found him to ask permission to baptise the princes . 
 In a charter of 688 , Cædwalla grants land at Farnham for a minster , so it is evident that Cædwalla controlled Surrey . He also invaded Kent , in 686 , and may have founded a monastery at Hoo , northeast of Rochester , between the Medway and the Thames . He installed his brother , Mul , as king of Kent , in place of its king Eadric . In a subsequent Kentish revolt , Mul was " burned " along with twelve others , according to the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle . Cædwalla responded with a renewed campaign against Kent , laying waste to its land and leaving it in a state of chaos . He may have ruled Kent directly after this second invasion . 
 = = Christianity = = 
 Cædwalla was unbaptised when he came to the throne of Wessex , and remained so throughout his reign , but though he is often referred to as a pagan this is not necessarily the most apt description ; it may be that he was already Christian in his beliefs but delayed his baptism to a time of his choice . He was clearly respectful of the church , with charter evidence showing multiple grants to churches and for religious buildings . When Cædwalla first attacked the South Saxons , Wilfrid was at the court of King Æthelwealh , and on Æthelwealh 's death Wilfrid attached himself to Cædwalla ; the Life of Wilfrid records that Cædwalla sought Wilfrid out as a spiritual father . Bede states that Cædwalla vowed to give a quarter of the Isle of Wight to the church if he conquered the island , and that Wilfrid was the beneficiary when the vow was fulfilled ; Bede also says that Cædwalla agreed to let the heirs of <unk> , the king of the Isle of Wight , be baptised before they were executed . Two of Cædwalla 's charters were grants of land to Wilfrid , and there is also subsequent evidence that Cædwalla worked with Wilfrid and Eorcenwald , a bishop of the East Saxons , to establish an ecclesiastical infrastructure for Sussex . However , there is no evidence that Wilfrid exerted any influence over Cædwalla 's secular activities or his campaigns . 
 Wilfrid 's association with Cædwalla may have benefited him in other ways : the Life of Wilfrid asserts that the Archbishop of Canterbury , Theodore , expressed a wish that Wilfrid succeed him in that role , and if this is true it may be a reflection of Wilfrid 's association with Cædwalla 's southern overlordship . 
 The Church of St Martin , Ludgate , in the City of London , claimed on a plaque , that it was both founded by Cædwalla and that he was interred in its crypt . It would be strange for a king of the West Saxons to institute a church in the rival kingdom of Essex . However , as the intramural area of ' Londinium ' was not actually occupied until at least 200 years after Cædwalla died and this claim roundly contradicts Bede 's history of his baptism and monument tomb in Rome it is plain that there is no basis to the story . 
 = = Abdication , baptism and death = = 
 In 688 Cædwalla abdicated , and went on a pilgrimage to Rome , possibly because he was dying of the wounds he had suffered while fighting on the Isle of Wight . Cædwalla had not been baptised , and Bede states that he wished to " obtain the particular privilege of receiving the cleansing of baptism at the shrine of the blessed Apostles " . He is known to have stopped in Francia at Samer , near Calais , and to have given money there for the foundation of a church , and is also recorded at the court of <unk> , king of the Lombards , in what is now northern Italy . In Rome , he was baptised by Pope Sergius I on the Saturday before Easter ( according to Bede ) taking the baptismal name Peter , and died not long afterwards , " still in his white garments " . He was buried in St. Peter 's church . Bede 's Ecclesiastical History and the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle agree that Cædwalla died on 20 April , but the latter says that he died seven days after his baptism , although the Saturday before Easter was on 10 April that year . The epitaph on his tomb described him as " King of the Saxons " . 
 Cædwalla 's departure in 688 appears to have led to instability in the south of England . Ine , Cædwalla 's successor , abdicated in 726 , and the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List says that he reigned for thirty @-@ seven years , implying his reign began in 689 instead of 688 . This could indicate an unsettled period between Cædwalla 's abdication and Ine 's accession . The kingship also changed in Kent in 688 , with Oswine , who was apparently a Mercian client , taking the throne ; and there is evidence of East Saxon influence in Kent in the years immediately following Cædwalla 's abdication . 
 In 694 , Ine extracted compensation of 30 @,@ 000 pence from the Kentishmen for the death of Mul ; this amount represented the value of an <unk> 's life in the Saxon system of <unk> . Ine appears to have retained control of Surrey , but did not recover Kent . No king of Wessex was to venture so far east until Egbert , over a hundred years later . 
 = Taunton by @-@ election , 1754 = 
 The Taunton by @-@ election of 1754 to the Parliament of Great Britain was held across thirteen days , from 10 – 24 December 1754 in Taunton , the county town of the southwestern English county of Somerset . It took place following the death of the incumbent Whig Member of Parliament , John Halliday . The by @-@ election was contested by Robert Maxwell on behalf of the Whigs , and Sir John Pole , 5th Baronet for the Tories . Maxwell was elected with a majority of 56 . The election had over 700 rejected votes , and the result caused rioting in Taunton , during which two people were killed . 
 The election was fiercely contested , and both sides incurred great expenses during the campaign . There was not another contested election in Taunton for almost twenty years , and during that time the Taunton Market House Society was set up with the aim of preventing the bad blood of a contested election , and to spend money that would have otherwise been spent on campaigning on improving the town . Maxwell remained as one of Taunton 's members of parliament until 1768 . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Vacancy and nominations = = = 
 In the mid @-@ 18th century , the parliamentary constituency of Taunton , which had an electorate of around 500 , returned predominantly Whig members of parliament , partly due to an agreement between Charles Wyndham , 2nd Earl of Egremont and the local Dissenters ; Lord Egremont , the chief landowner in the borough , would nominate a candidate for one of the two seats , while the Dissenters would name the second . Nationally , parliament had been controlled by the Whigs since 1715 , in what was dubbed the " Whig Supremacy " by Basil Williams . At the 1754 general election , Lord Egremont put forward his brother @-@ in @-@ law , George Carpenter , 3rd Baron Carpenter , while the Dissenters nominated one of their own , John Halliday . The pair were elected unopposed . Two months after the election , on 8 June 1754 , Halliday died , resulting in a by @-@ election being called to fill the vacant seat . 
 The Dissenters proposed Robert Webb , who had previously served as the member for Taunton from 1747 until the general election in 1754 , to fill the vacancy . The recent history of the elections in Taunton suggested that no opposition would be offered : the last contested election had been in 1741 . That however proved not to be the case , and a group of Tories put forward their own candidate , Sir John Pole , 5th Baronet of Shute in Devon . Webb did not want the expense of a contested election , and withdrew , leaving the Dissenters without a candidate . Unable to find a suitable candidate , the Dissenters appealed to Lord Egremont to locate someone to stand for the Whiggish interest . The Mayor , Henry Manly , was sent to London to meet with the Whig Prime Minister , Thomas Pelham @-@ Holles , 1st Duke of Newcastle , to try and secure a candidate . Manly reported that the Duke of Newcastle did not want the seat to go to a Tory , and was willing to fund the election from the secret service account ( more accurately the King 's private money , a fund which was not accountable to Parliament ) . Eventually , through communication with both Lord Egremont and the Duke of Newcastle , Robert Maxwell came forward as the Whig candidate . Maxwell offered to spend up to £ 3 @,@ 000 on the election , in addition to the money promised from the secret service fund .

 John Pole was the only son of Sir William Pole , 4th Baronet . The family owned the Shute House estate in east Devon , and had returned six generations of members of parliament , including John Pole 's father . He had inherited the estate , and the baronetcy upon his father 's death in 1741 . Robert Maxwell was the oldest son of John Maxwell , 1st Baron Farnham , an Irish politician and peer . Robert had been a member of the Parliament of Ireland since 1743 for the constituency of Lisburn . He had not stood for the British parliament during the 1754 general election , though he was by that time almost certainly resident in England .

 When Halliday died in June , parliament was in recess . As a result of this , a writ could not be issued until parliament reconvened in the winter . This extended the election campaign to run for six months , causing major disruption to the wool trade in the town . In his History of Taunton , Joshua Toulmin reported that the length of the campaigning allowed " the display of every manoeuvre , and the exertion of every power , by which the parties could counteract each other 's views . " A lot of money was spent on both sides of the election ; in addition to the £ 3 @,@ 000 which Maxwell said he was willing to spend , the government put forward £ 3 @,@ 675 of secret service money for his campaign . Both men had plates and mugs made which were given free to the voters , generally full of food and drink . A number of <unk> plates bearing the <unk> " Sir John Pole for ever " still exist , and one such plate sold for over £ 2 @,@ 000 in 2011 . A drinking glass with a similar inscription is housed at the British Museum in London . The public houses became aligned to one of the two candidates , and much of the campaign money was placed into these to gain their support . Toulmin lamented that " the houses of entertainment were kept open during all this time ; [ ... ] habits of idleness and licentiousness were formed . " In a letter to Lord Sackville , Maxwell wrote that the election campaign involved " a great deal of smoking , some drinking , and kissing some hundreds of women . " 
 Maxwell travelled down to Taunton in August to contest the seat , and the vacancy was nationally advertised in October . Despite this , the voting did not commence until 10 December 1754 . The voting ran for thirteen days , and closed on 24 December ; Maxwell received 198 votes to Pole 's 142 , giving Maxwell a majority of 56 . During the course of the voting , over 700 votes were discounted , and it has been referred to as being " notoriously corrupt " . 
 When the result was announced , the public showed " their displeasure by assaulting the friends of Mr Maxwell . " Maxwell himself had to be escorted back to where he was staying , but during the rioting that ensued , the houses of those known to support Maxwell were attacked . The Derby Mercury reported that Robert Pearsall , a Dissenter minister who had been prominent in Maxwell 's campaign , was threatened with having his house pulled down and being sacrificed . Two people , a man and a woman , were killed during the rioting , which prompted two troops of dragoons to be sent to the town , placed at the command of the Mayor , in case of emergency . One of the murderers was caught and sent to the County Jail in Ilchester , but the other escaped . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Maxwell , who became the 2nd Baron Farnham upon his father 's death in 1759 , and then Viscount Farnham in 1760 , was returned unopposed at the 1761 general election . He pressed for a position in parliament , suggesting " being in the Admiralty or being paymaster of the pensions . " However , this desire was only because he thought that such a position would provide a stepping stone to a higher peerage , and he was made the Earl of Farnham , in the Irish peerage in 1763 . He initially stood at the general election in 1768 , but withdrew from the election in the face of strong opposition . 
 The Market House Society was formed in Taunton in 1763 by a group who wished to avoid a repeat of the expensive and violent election in 1754 . They made it their aim to " prevent the evils and drunkenness of a contested election " , and vowed to spend the money that would have otherwise been spent on campaigning on improving Taunton . They put forward two candidates in 1768 , who after the withdrawal of Maxwell and another , were returned unopposed for Taunton . 
 = Augusta , Lady Gregory = 
 Isabella Augusta , Lady Gregory ( née Persse ; 15 March 1852 – 22 May 1932 ) was an Irish dramatist , folklorist and theatre manager . With William Butler Yeats and Edward Martyn , she co @-@ founded the Irish Literary Theatre and the Abbey Theatre , and wrote numerous short works for both companies . Lady Gregory produced a number of books of retellings of stories taken from Irish mythology . Born into a class that identified closely with British rule , her conversion to cultural nationalism , as evidenced by her writings , was emblematic of many of the political struggles to occur in Ireland during her lifetime . 
 Lady Gregory is mainly remembered for her work behind the Irish Literary Revival . Her home at Coole Park , County Galway , served as an important meeting place for leading Revival figures , and her early work as a member of the board of the Abbey was at least as important for the theatre 's development as her creative writings . Lady Gregory 's motto was taken from Aristotle : " To think like a wise man , but to express oneself like the common people . " 
 = = Early life and marriage = = 
 Gregory was born at Roxborough , County Galway , the youngest daughter of the Anglo @-@ Irish gentry family Persse . Her mother , Frances Barry , was related to Viscount <unk> , and her family home , Roxborough , was a 6 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 24 km ² ) estate located between Gort and <unk> , the main house of which was later burnt down during the Irish Civil War . She was educated at home , and her future career was strongly influenced by the family nurse ( i.e. nanny ) , Mary Sheridan , a Catholic and a native Irish speaker , who introduced the young Augusta to the history and legends of the local area . 
 She married Sir William Henry Gregory , a widower with an estate at Coole Park , near Gort , on 4 March 1880 in St Matthias ' Church , Dublin . Sir William , who was 35 years her elder , had just retired from his position as Governor of Ceylon ( now Sri Lanka ) , having previously served several terms as Member of Parliament for County Galway . He was a well @-@ educated man with many literary and artistic interests , and the house at Coole Park housed a large library and extensive art collection , both of which Lady Gregory was eager to explore . He also had a house in London , where the couple spent a considerable amount of time , holding weekly salons frequented by many leading literary and artistic figures of the day , including Robert Browning , Lord Tennyson , John Everett Millais and Henry James . Their only child , Robert Gregory , was born in 1881 . He was killed during the First World War , while serving as a pilot , an event which inspired Yeats ' poems " An Irish Airman <unk> His Death , " " In Memory of Major Robert Gregory , " and " Shepherd and Goatherd . " 
 = = Early writings = = 
 The <unk> travelled in Ceylon , India , Spain , Italy and Egypt . While in Egypt , Lady Gregory had an affair with the English poet Wilfrid Scawen Blunt , during which she wrote a series of love poems , A Woman 's Sonnets . 
 Her earliest work to appear under her own name was Arabi and His Household ( 1882 ) , a pamphlet — originally a letter to The Times — in support of Ahmed Orabi Pasha , leader of what has come to be known as the Urabi Revolt , an 1879 Egyptian nationalist revolt against the oppressive regime of the Khedive and European domination of Egypt . She later said of this booklet , " whatever political indignation or energy was born with me may have run its course in that Egyptian year and worn itself out " . Despite this , in 1893 she published A Phantom 's Pilgrimage , or Home Ruin , an anti @-@ Nationalist pamphlet against William Ewart Gladstone 's proposed second Home Rule Act . 
 She continued to write prose during the period of her marriage . During the winter of 1883 , while her husband was in Ceylon , she worked on a series of memoirs of her childhood home with a view to publishing them under the title An Emigrant 's Notebook , but this plan was abandoned . She wrote a series of pamphlets in 1887 called Over the River , in which she appealed for funds for the parish of St. Stephens in Southwark , south London . She also wrote a number of short stories in the years 1890 and 1891 , although these also never appeared in print . A number of unpublished poems from this period have also survived . When Sir William Gregory died in March 1892 , Lady Gregory went into mourning and returned to Coole Park where she edited her husband 's autobiography , which she published in 1894 . She was to write later , " If I had not married I should not have learned the quick enrichment of sentences that one gets in conversation ; had I not been widowed I should not have found the detachment of mind , the leisure for observation necessary to give insight into character , to express and interpret it . Loneliness made me rich — ' full ' , as Bacon says . " 
 = = Cultural nationalism = = 
 A trip to <unk> in the Aran Islands in 1893 re @-@ awoke an interest in the Irish language and in the folklore of the area in which she lived . She organised Irish lessons at the school at Coole and began collecting tales from the area around her home , especially from the residents of Gort workhouse . One of the tutors she employed , was Norma Borthwick , who would visit Coole numerous times . This activity led to the publication of a number of volumes of folk material , including A Book of Saints and Wonders ( 1906 ) , The Kiltartan History Book ( 1909 ) , and The Kiltartan Wonder Book ( 1910 ) . She also produced a number of collections of " Kiltartanese " versions of Irish myths , including Cuchulain of Muirthemne ( 1902 ) and Gods and Fighting Men ( 1904 ) . ( " Kiltartanese " is Lady Gregory 's term for English with Gaelic syntax , based on the dialect spoken in Kiltartan . ) In his introduction to the former , Yeats wrote " I think this book is the best that has come out of Ireland in my time . " James Joyce was to parody this claim in the Scylla and Charybdis chapter of his novel Ulysses . 
 Towards the end of 1894 , encouraged by the positive reception of the editing of her husband 's autobiography , Lady Gregory turned her attention to another editorial project . She decided to prepare selections from Sir William Gregory 's grandfather 's correspondence for publication as Mr Gregory 's Letter @-@ Box 1813 – 30 ( 1898 ) . This entailed researching Irish history of the period , and one outcome of this work was a shift in her own position from the " soft " Unionism of her earlier writing on Home Rule to a definite support of Irish nationalism and Republicanism and what she was later to describe as " a dislike and distrust of England " . 
 = = Founding of the Abbey = = 
 Edward Martyn was a neighbour of Lady Gregory 's , and it was during a visit to his home , <unk> Castle , in 1896 that she first met W. B. Yeats . Discussions between the three of them over the following year or so led to the founding of the Irish Literary Theatre in 1899 . Lady Gregory undertook fundraising , and the first programme consisted of Martyn 's The Heather Field and Yeats 's The Countess Cathleen . 
 The Irish Literary Theatre project lasted until 1901 , when it collapsed due to lack of funding . In 1904 , Lady Gregory , Martyn , Yeats , John Millington Synge , Æ , Annie Horniman and William and Frank Fay came together to form the Irish National Theatre Society . The first performances staged by the society took place in a building called the Molesworth Hall . When the Hibernian Theatre of Varieties in Lower Abbey Street and an adjacent building in Marlborough Street became available , Horniman and William Fay agreed to their purchase and refitting to meet the needs of the society . 
 On 11 May 1904 , the society formally accepted Horniman 's offer of the use of the building . As Horniman was not normally resident in Ireland , the Royal Letters Patent required were paid for by her but granted in the name of Lady Gregory . One of her own plays , Spreading the News was performed on the opening night , 27 December 1904 . At the opening of Synge 's The Playboy of the Western World in January 1907 , a significant portion of the crowd rioted , causing the remainder of the performances to be acted out in dumbshow . Lady Gregory did not think as highly of the play as Yeats did , but she defended Synge as a matter of principle . Her view of the affair is summed up in a letter to Yeats where she wrote of the riots : " It is the old battle , between those who use a toothbrush and those who don 't . " 
 = = Later career = = 
 Lady Gregory remained an active director of the theatre until ill health led to her retirement in 1928 . During this time she wrote more than 19 plays , mainly for production at the Abbey . Many of these were written in an attempted transliteration of the Hiberno @-@ English dialect spoken around Coole Park that became widely known as Kiltartanese , from the nearby village of Kiltartan . Her plays had been among the most successful at the Abbey in the earlier years , but their popularity declined . Indeed , the Irish writer Oliver St John Gogarty once wrote " the perpetual presentation of her plays nearly ruined the Abbey " . In addition to her plays , she wrote a two @-@ volume study of the folklore of her native area called Visions and Beliefs in the West of Ireland in 1920 . She also played the lead role in three performances of Cathleen Ni Houlihan in 1919 . 
 During her time on the board of the Abbey , Coole Park remained her home and she spent her time in Dublin staying in a number of hotels . At the time of the 1911 national census for example , she was staying in a hotel at 16 South Frederick Street . In these , she ate frugally , often on food she brought with her from home . She frequently used her hotel rooms to interview would @-@ be Abbey dramatists and to entertain the company after opening nights of new plays . She spent many of her days working on her translations in the National Library of Ireland . She gained a reputation as being a somewhat conservative figure . For instance , when Denis Johnston submitted his first play <unk> to the Abbey , it was rejected by Lady Gregory and returned to the author with " The Old Lady says No " written on the title page . Johnson decided to rename the play , and The Old Lady Says ' No ' was eventually staged by the Gate Theatre in 1928 . 
 = = Retirement and death = = 
 When she retired from the Abbey board , Lady Gregory returned to live in Galway , although she continued to visit Dublin regularly . The house and demesne at Coole Park had been sold to the Irish Forestry Commission in 1927 , with Lady Gregory retaining life tenancy . Her Galway home had long been a focal point for the writers associated with the Irish Literary Revival and this continued after her retirement . On a tree in what were the grounds of the now demolished house , one can still see the carved initials of Synge , Æ , Yeats and his artist brother Jack , George Moore , Seán O 'Casey , George Bernard Shaw , Katharine Tynan and Violet Martin . Yeats wrote five poems about or set in the house and grounds : " The Wild Swans at Coole " , " I walked among the seven woods of Coole " , " In the Seven Woods " , " Coole Park , 1929 " and " Coole Park and <unk> , 1931 " . 
 The woman Shaw once described as " the greatest living Irishwoman " died at home aged 80 from breast cancer , and is buried in the New Cemetery in <unk> , County Galway . The entire contents of Coole Park were auctioned three months after her death and the house demolished in 1941 . 
 Her plays fell out of favour after her death and are now rarely performed . Many of the diaries and journals she kept for most of her adult life have been published , providing a rich source of information on Irish literary history during the first three decades of the 20th century . 
 = Persona 3 The Movie : No. 1 , Spring of Birth = 
 Persona 3 The Movie : # 1 Spring of Birth ( 劇場版 「 ペルソナ3 」 <unk> , Gekijōban Perusona 3 Dai Ichi Shō ) is a 2013 Japanese animated film and the first installment in a film series based on the Shin Megami Tensei : Persona 3 video game by Atlus . Directed by Noriaki Akitaya and written by Jun Kumagai , it is based on the original story by Atlus and distributed by Aniplex . It stars voice actors Akira Ishida , Megumi Toyoguchi , Kōsuke Toriumi , Rie Tanaka , Hikaru Midorikawa and Mamiko Noto . Set in 2009 , the film follows the exploits of transfer student Makoto Yuki who , upon moving to Iwatodai City , discovers the Shadow creatures which feed on human psyche during the Dark Hour midnight phenomenon . After awakening to an ability called Persona , Yuki finds himself intertwined in the battle against the Shadows with his new schoolmates . 
 Development of the film was first announced in a teaser trailer during the limited theatrical release of Persona 4 The Animation : The Factor of Hope on June 9 , 2012 . Aniplex later announced a Fall 2013 release date and that the main voice acting cast of the original PlayStation 2 game would reprise their roles in the film . The committee that was involved in Persona 4 : The Animation was selected for the film and included music composer Shoji Meguro and supervisor Seiji Kishi , both veterans in works of the Megami Tensei franchise . The film was animated by AIC ASTA . The characterization of Makoto Yuki was noted as being particularly difficult during production due to his concept in the original game . 
 A promotional campaign was launched by Aniplex which also included the release of trailers and merchandise by making use of various mechanisms of the Persona 3 game as they applied to the real world . The film premiered at Tokyo 's Shinjuku Wald 9 cinema on November 16 , 2013 followed by its release across Japan on November 23 , 2013 . It made a gross earning of over US $ 1 @.@ 9 million at the end of 2013 . Critics praised the animation techniques used in the film with focus on its dark visual style . However it was described as being a simple and straightforward movie which lacked a suitable sense of closure . The film was released in Japan on Blu @-@ ray and DVD editions on May 14 , 2014 , and internationally on imported editions on May 20 , 2014 . A sequel titled Persona 3 The Movie : # 2 Midsummer Knight 's Dream was released on June 7 , 2014 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Due to an unfortunate accident during the Spring of April 6 , 2009 , Makoto Yuki ( Akira Ishida ) arrives in the city late at night on a delayed train . Upon disembarking at midnight , a strange phenomenon grips the city — shutting down all forms of technology and causing humans to become encased in coffins . Unperturbed , Makoto casually makes his way to the Iwatodai Dormitory where a mysterious boy ( Akira Ishida ) greets him with a contract after which he meets fellow <unk> , Yukari Takeba ( Megumi Toyoguchi ) and Mitsuru Kirijo ( Rie Tanaka ) , albeit the pair weary of his arrival at midnight . 
 The next day , Makoto enrolls at Gekkoukan High School as a sophomore with Yukari and fellow classmate Junpei Iori ( Kōsuke Toriumi ) . Afterwards the school 's Chairman of the board , Shuji Ikutsuki ( Hideyuki Hori ) , asks Yukari to keep a close eye on Makoto due to his uncanny characteristics which hint at his " potential " and coincidental circumstances involving the death of his parents during an accident in the city some ten years previous . Meanwhile Makoto finds himself in a place called the Velvet Room and becomes acquainted with Igor ( Isamu Tanonaka ) and Elizabeth ( Miyuki Sawashiro ) . 
 During the full moon of April 9 , while Ikutsuki , Mitsuru and Yukari are observing Makoto during the midnight phenomenon , Akihiko Sanada ( Hikaru Midorikawa ) rushes back to the dorm just as it comes under the attack of a swarm of monstrous creatures . Yukari immediately grabs Makoto and flees to the roof . However they are cornered by a giant creature who knocks Yukari out . Much to everyone 's amazement though , Makoto awakens to the power of Persona , calling forth Orpheus . However another Persona known as Thanatos , rips out of Orpheus and grotesquely destroys the creature before Makoto faints . 
 After having been unconscious for over a week , Makoto awakens in the hospital to find Yukari , who explains their similarity in having both lost parents during the accident in the past . The next day Ikutsuki , Akihiko and Mitsuru recruit Makoto to the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad — SEES to help them fight the Shadow creatures responsible for the Apathy Syndrome by preying on humans during the Dark Hour midnight phenomenon . Not long after as Junpei also joins SEES , Akihiko deduces that they have enough members to begin exploring their school 's Dark Hour form , a Shadow @-@ infested labyrinth called Tartarus , where they hope to unearth the mystery of the Dark Hour . Makoto also befriends Fuka Yamagishi ( Mamiko Noto ) and learns of her strained relationship with class bully , Natsuki Moriyama ( Yuka Komatsu ) . 
 During the full moon on May 9 , Mitsuru detects an abnormally large Shadow presence aboard a train and deploys Makoto , Yukari and Junpei to investigate . However the trio are ambushed by the Shadows just as the train begins accelerating . Junpei charges ahead and encounters the Priestess Arcana which overwhelms him . However as the train nears an inevitable collision , Makoto evokes the Wild Card ability to defeat the Priestess with Junpei before stopping the runaway train . 
 On the night of May 30 , two girls fall victim to the Apathy Syndrome in front of the school which prompts widespread rumors . Yukari , Junpei and Makoto go looking for answers from the delinquents behind Port Island Station and learn from Shinjiro Aragaki ( Kazuya Nakai ) that the girls had been bullying Fuka before the latter suddenly disappeared that same night . On June 8 , Natsuki confesses to Mitsuru that she and her friends had locked Fuka inside the school 's gymnasium . However when her friends went to check on Fuka that same night , she had mysteriously vanished while the latter developed the Apathy cases after being preyed on by Shadows . That night the SEES members deduce that Fuka may be trapped inside the Tartarus tower and plan to rescue her . However when Mitsuru asks Makoto to accompany them , Yukari grows frustrated at his ambivalence and he excludes himself from the mission . Instead , Mitsuru elects him to protect Natsuki at the dorm where he listens to Natsuki 's reasoning for bullying Fuka and relates that Fuka genuinely considers her as a friend . 
 Afterwards the SEES members break into the school and indeed find Fuka inside Tartarus when the Dark Hour strikes . However when Akihiko pieces together the connection between the full moon and the powerful Shadows , Mitsuru and Yukari come under attack by the Emperor and Empress Arcanas at Tartarus ' entrance . Junpei , Akihiko and Fuka rush to their aid however the Arcanas easily overwhelm all of their Personas . In the midst of the battle , Fuka also awakens a Persona , Lucia , to defend an entranced Natsuki . However when the Emperor moves to attack her , Makoto arrives in the nick of time and launches a barrage of Persona attacks despite his teammates begging him to flee for his safety . With everyone approaching their physical limits , Fuka uses Lucia to sense the Arcanas ' weaknesses and coordinates the SEES members in a collaborative effort which results in the Shadows ' defeat . A few days later , Fuka moves into the Iwatodai dorm and repairs her relations with Natsuki , while life returns to a level of normalcy . 
 In a post @-@ credits scene , the mysterious boy appears to Makoto and introduces himself as Pharos . Meanwhile at an undisclosed location , a girl awakens from a slumber .

 Persona 3 The Movie : No. 1 , Spring of Birth was animated by AIC ASTA . The main staff consisted of the same people behind Persona 4 : The Animation along with a few modifications . The film was directed by Noriaki Akitaya , following his directional work on the <unk> and Code <unk> anime series . Akitaya remarked that he had ' jumped ' onto the idea of the film adaptation ever since he was included in talks due to his love of games created by Atlus . He described the game as something which gave fans direct input in the events which take place and hence made it a goal to help them enjoy the adaptation as much as possible from their perspective of only being able to view the film . 
 " I believe that Persona 3 's charm lies within the coolness of the characters , more than anything . We pride ourselves in having made a movie that might just make you want to play the game after watching it ... " 
 Seiji Kishi , a veteran director of the Megami Tensei franchise was approached to supervise the overall production process and hence brought his experience from directing the anime adaptations of two well known games in the franchise — Persona 4 and Devil Survivor 2 . Kishi had proposed a new " visual combat system " to be employed in the film rather than the one used for Persona 4 : The Animation since he felt that the darker themes of Persona 3 required such a change . 
 At the same time , script writer Jun Kumagai , had nothing but praise for the Persona 3 game and stated that " the original game is a masterpiece which can be called the innovation of RPG " . Kumagai had also expressed his hope that the screenplay would be compelling both to fans of the game and those new to the Persona series . From the visual perspective , the original character designs of the game were completely revamped for the film by animation director Keisuke Watabe , who retained the characters ' likeness . The various Personas and Shadows were designed by <unk> Aki while art direction was handled by Toshihiro <unk> . Kaoru Aoki aided with the art designs while Junpei <unk> was in charge of the visual designs . Saori Goda held the position of color coordination while Shinobu <unk> designed the film 's props . Other staff directors included the executive animation directors Akiko <unk> and Mizuka Takahashi , action director Ryo Tanaka and composite director Hideki Imaizumi . Finally , Takashi Sakurai served as the film 's editor .

 In a Famitsu interview , Akitaya explained that one of his biggest challenges was , " getting the protagonist , who is the [ human @-@ controlled ] ' player ' in the game , and making him into a character named Makoto Yuki for the film , then figuring out how to integrate him [ Makoto ] into the story . " Akitaya went about constructing Makoto 's character with extreme care in terms of speech , gestures and behavior all the while staying true to what was already established in the game . Akitaya admitted that he would not have been able to meet the expectations of the individual fans of the game since they were able to choose their own unique name and personality for the Protagonist . He instead incorporated the most general traits of the Protagonist from fan reaction to form Yuki 's character . Akitaya had joked that during initial pre @-@ production the Protagonist 's name was still not determined and had proposed the placeholder , " Tsukitarō Yamada " ( <unk> <unk> , Yamada Tsukitarō ) until the first draft was developed . However even as Kumagai began working on the script , the placeholder went unchanged for the next four to five months and Akitaya found himself growing steadily attached despite eventually changing it . Akitaya stated that his favorite scene in the film occurred when Makoto summoned his Persona for the first time . He elaborated that Makoto 's maniacal laugh helped give depth to the scene and establish Watabe 's character designs as being one of the film 's main attractions .

 The soundtrack for No. 1 , Spring of Birth was composed by Shoji Meguro , while the sound director Satoki Iida helped in the track arrangement and selection . Meguro was initially thrilled at being selected as the film 's musical composer and remarked that its soundtrack would be his twelfth work for the Megami Tensei franchise . Meguro described the user interface of the Persona 3 game as having a " fancy atmosphere " which compelled him to create its unique pop @-@ like soundtrack . However he felt that he needed to give the film 's songs a deeper feeling and hence utilized string instruments to create such an effect . 
 The first music compilation titled " Persona 3 The Movie # 1 Spring of Birth Theme Song " was released by Aniplex on October 2 , 2013 . The disc features " More Than One Heart " by Yumi Kawamura which was used as the main theme song for the film . Kawamura had previously been the vocal contributor of many of the songs produced for the Persona 3 video game . She also provided the vocals for the " Spring of Birth " version of Persona 3 's " Burn My Dread " theme song , which also made its debut on the disc . The film 's original soundtrack was released together with the Blu @-@ ray on May 14 , 2014 .

 The Persona 3 The Movie project was first revealed during a thirty second post @-@ credits teaser trailer at the end of the limited theatrical release of the Persona 4 The Animation : The Factor of Hope feature film during its screening in Japan on June 9 , 2012 . The teaser noted that the project had been green lit for production . Featured in the teaser was the Persona 3 Protagonist holding an " Evoker " ( a unique game mechanic of summoning a " Persona " ) to his head and pulling the trigger , all showcased in Japanese @-@ style 2D animation . This left some speculation amongst the media as to whether the project would be an anime film or otherwise since at the time this was left to ambiguity . Following later confirmation of the project 's animated theatrical nature , a slightly altered fifteen @-@ second version of the teaser was streamed online . 
 The first official trailer saw its release on March 27 , 2013 and showcased a clock striking midnight which established the film 's key plot devices including the Dark Hour phenomenon , the primary antagonists — the Shadows and the main protagonist summoning his Persona , Orpheus . When the second trailer was released on July 22 , 2013 , it was also the first to feature dialogue as well as the main theme song for the film , titled " More Than One Heart " by Yumi Kawamura . The third trailer was released on October 19 , 2013 and introduced the Tartarus tower along with designs of the signature weapons used by each individual character . A reporter at Kotaku described the animation as " gorgeous " and felt as though the movie reflected the game 's [ Persona 3 ] cut @-@ scenes . The fourth and final trailer was released on November 18 , 2013 and was the lengthiest of its predecessors . It showcased new footage including the characters Igor and Elizabeth in the Velvet Room , more use of the Evokers , a bit of Makoto Yuki 's back story ( in flashbacks ) along with new dialogue . At the end of the trailer , a reference alluding to Makoto 's ambivalence is made by the character Junpei Iori who asks , " I wonder ... Just why is he [ Makoto ] fighting ? " — a trait later mentioned by film critics . The last trailer was also streamed every midnight outside Alta Studio Co . Ltd. in East Shinjuku until November 25 , 2013 . 
 An advanced sneak peek screening of Persona 3 The Movie : No. 1 , Spring of Birth was held at the Shinjuku Wald 9 cinema in Shinjuku , Tokyo on November 16 , 2013 . Akira Ishida , Megumi Toyoguchi and Kōsuke Toriumi participated in special talk show at the event to highlight some of the film 's features before its screening . The actors talked about the dubbing process for the film . For instance , Toyoguchi stated that their dubbing roles were recorded around Spring 2013 . Toriumi — the voice of ' Junpei Iori ' , explained how passage of time between the release of the Persona 3 game and the film affected his dubbing role since his present voice sounded more akin to an adult . However Satoki Iida had requested that he try to make himself sound younger for his character . Toyoguchi also joked that many of the 2006 @-@ era items were held true in the film , such as the use of Cathode ray tube TVs and mobile phones . A Q & A Twitter session was also part of the show during which the Protagonist 's characterization was questioned by fans and answered by producer , Kazuki Adachi .

 The official website and Twitter account for the project were both launched on July 3 , 2012 and confirmed the Persona 3 : The Movie project 's theatrical nature . The July 3 launch was scheduled so as to pay homage to the use of two major plot mechanics in the Persona 3 video game — namely the midnight Dark Hour phenomenon as well as correlation to the lunar phases with respect to the calendar full moon whereby an exceptionally powerful Shadow would appear on the night of its occurrence . This tactic was henceforth utilized by Aniplex to mark succeeding updates regarding the project and also aided by the Twitter account which updated at select lunar occurrences thereafter . When the official website was launched it featured the simple ambiguous caption " Coming soon " . This was later changed during the full moon of December 28 , 2012 when the website showcased the first promotional image along with the line , " Persona 3 the Movie # 1 2013 in theaters " — teasing a future film franchise . However word had yet to be announced on the number of planned films . 
 Three months later , during the full moon of March 27 , 2013 , the film project was confirmed to be a series of anime films and not just a single release — with the first film given the subtitle : " # 1 Spring of Birth " . This news came alongside the release of the first official trailer which also featured a list of the production staff and confirmed that the main voice acting cast of the original PlayStation 2 game would reprise their roles in the film . Almost four months later , at midnight during the full moon of July 22 , 2013 , the official website received a completely revamped design with the announcement that November 23 , 2013 would be film 's official release date . This came alongside a list of 26 theaters throughout Japan which would screen the film during its opening weekend . Almost a month later during the full moon of August 21 , 2013 at 12 : 00AM JST a minor update was released which detailed the track @-@ list for the film 's official music CD release titled " Persona 3 The Movie # 1 Spring of Birth Theme Song CD " . Aniplex soon began releasing updates at an accelerated pace as the film 's premiere date drew closer . For instance the next minor update was released during the new moon of September 5 , 2013 which announced that the 2011 anime series : Persona 4 : The Animation would begin re @-@ airing on Tokyo MX , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> as a follow up to the film . 
 A couple weeks later and during the full moon of September 19 , 2013 an update was released which revealed limited edition <unk> featuring promotional images of the film . The cards were scheduled to go on sale at the <unk> and Toyosu train stations between October 1 and 31 , 2013 . They granted a bearer access to the New Transit <unk> train which connects to the artificial island of Odaiba in Tokyo Bay between Minato and Kōtō in Tokyo . 
 An animated feature was broadcast on Tokyo MX during the airing of Disco Train at noon on October 13 , 2013 . The segment paid homage to a shopping infomercial titled " Tanaka 's Amazing Commodities " , an event usually triggered on Sundays in the Persona 3 game . The program featured the Persona 3 character President Tanaka , advertising the ticket bundle for the " Persona 3 The Movie Theme Song CD " set . An official website for Tanaka 's in @-@ game company — <unk> Net was also set up for a limited time to accept pre @-@ orders of the set which included an exclusive bonus sticker . The website also featured other products obtainable in the Persona 3 game but were all listed as " sold out " . 
 Another update was released during the full moon of October 19 , 2013 and included the third movie trailer along with a host of new artwork . A dynamic lunar calendar of the same design used in the Persona 3 game was also added to the main page of the official website and began featuring new artwork on a daily basis — some of which included production storyboards . It was also announced that a Persona 3 @-@ themed " mystery event " would take place at the Odaiba <unk> from November 23 - December 1 , 2013 . Known as the " <unk> The Movie # 1 Spring of Birth x Nazomate " , the interactive event was set up by Nazomate and required participants to role @-@ play as a resident of the Iwatodai Dormitory just as it comes under the attack of a Shadow . The participants needed to awaken their Personas and take a test to become a member of the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad . Those who were able to complete the event were awarded with a randomly chosen exclusive Nazomate Character Card featuring the film 's main characters . Those who failed were given another card featuring the character " Elizabeth " as proof of participation . In addition , other merchandise was made available for purchase at the event . An exclusive store Persona @-@ themed store was also opened at the Marui department store 's " Space ONE " area in Shinjuku , Tokyo from November 21 , 2013 to December 15 , 2013 . 
 One week before the film 's release and during the full moon of November 17 , 2013 , different cast members began posting their autographs on the official website once per day . This was also accompanied by special digital wallpapers released in the same manner which featured the film 's main characters .

 Aniplex began distributing official movie merchandise during the 2013 Anime Contents Expo event at the Makuhari Messe convention center on March 30 – 31 . Along with screening the film 's first teaser , a dish sold at the <unk> ramen restaurant in the Persona 3 game called the " Hidden Leaf Bowl " was made available at the food area of the event . Almost four months later on July 22 , 2013 , Aniplex launched phase one of a special ticket promotion whereby movie @-@ goers who pre @-@ ordered early tickets between August 10 and September 20 , 2013 would receive special collectable folders containing leaflets which sported depictions of the characters Makoto Yuki , Yukari Takeba and , Junpei Iori along with their respective Personas chosen at random .

Happy @-@ Kuji also revealed a lottery contest on August 21 , 2013 which officially began on September 21 , 2013 . Official movie merchandise , consisting of mostly figurines were offered as prizes for the contest . During the film 's first three weeks of release in Japan , special Persona 3 themed Bikkuriman stickers were given out to movie goers . Each patron received one sticker at random out of the 29 piece set called " Super PS3 Seals " . The sticker artwork was illustrated by Minoru Yonezawa and Satoshi <unk> of Green House Co . Ltd . Yonezawa remarked that he had not known of the [ Persona ] game series until he was approached by Aniplex for commissioning — rather only being aware of the original Megami Tensei games . Due to his unfamiliarity with the series Yonezawa ( and <unk> ) found difficulty in deforming the characters . They also drew the design of the special " Tanaka " sticker given to those who placed orders on the <unk> Net website . A host of other Persona 3 @-@ themed merchandise and accessories were also released to help promote the film .

 Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku described Makoto Yuki as being an initially " ambivalent , broken character " and added that the character 's growth took center stage in the film . He also remarked that the film could have " been a very dark , difficult @-@ to @-@ see movie " since the majority of it takes place at night but praised the lighting effects and contrasts which rendered the action easily visible while creating a " visual style all its own " . On the flip side , Eisenbeis explained that while the movie covers only the very beginning of the Persona 3 story , there was " the unfortunate side effect of a good chunk of the main cast and the majority of the antagonists not even being in the movie . " Adding that since none of the game 's key plot twists are reached , he felt that it was " a very simple , straight @-@ forward movie . " Eisenbeis also noted that the film had " more images of teen suicide than you can shake a stick at " . The " Evokers " which in the Persona 3 world allowed the characters to summon Personas by putting one to their heads and pulling the trigger , were likened to guns in this context . Despite not being actual weapons , Eisenbeis stated that " it still looks like they are blowing their brains out — often complete with spiritual brain and skull fragments . " 
 Elliot Gay of Japanator elaborated on the challenges that could have been faced in adapting a 50- to 80 @-@ hour RPG into a 90 @-@ minute film but praised its admirable job at pacing albeit a few issues . He noted that one such example was with as with the introduction of the Tartarus Tower which he felt was " rushed and somewhat under @-@ explained " . Gay also noted that the film " suffers from not having a strong narrative through @-@ line " and that there was no sense of closure since " nothing truly significant [ took ] place " . He argued that this was as an " unavoidable side effect of adapting Persona 3 " . Like Eisenbeis though , Gay felt that Makoto 's experiences ultimately result in his growth and that the subtitle Spring of Birth " refers to Makoto and the forward progress he makes as a person . " Gay went on to praise the film 's visuals , explaining that the " film captures the darker atmosphere of the game admirably . " Overall , Gay described the film as delivering " a nostalgic trip down memory lane for longtime fans , and an accessible entry point for folks curious about the franchise . "

 = Ellis Paul = 
 Ellis Paul ( born Paul Plissey ; January 14 , 1965 ) is an American singer @-@ songwriter and folk musician . Born in Aroostook County , Maine , Paul is a key figure in what has become known as the Boston school of songwriting , a literate , provocative and <unk> romantic folk @-@ pop style that helped ignite the folk revival of the 1990s . His pop music songs have appeared in movies and on television , bridging the gap between the modern folk sound and the populist traditions of Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger . 
 Having grown up in a small town in Maine , Paul attended Boston College on a track scholarship where he majored in English . An athletic injury sustained during his junior year changed the course of his professional career . Paul picked up a guitar to pass the time while sidelined , and discovered that playing guitar and writing songs was the creative outlet he had been looking for . After graduating from college he began playing at open mic nights in the Boston area while working with inner @-@ city school children . Paul 's growing popularity at Boston coffeehouses , coupled with winning a Boston Acoustic Underground songwriter competition and national exposure on a Windham Hill Records compilation combined to give him the confidence to resign his day @-@ job and pursue a career as a professional musician . 
 To date , Paul has released 19 albums and has been the recipient of 14 Boston Music Awards , considered by some to be a pinnacle of contemporary acoustic music success . He has published a book of original lyrics , poems , and drawings and released a DVD that includes a live performance , guitar instruction , and a road @-@ trip documentary . In 2014 his children 's CD Hero in You was published as a book by Albert Whitman & Company . As a touring musician , Paul plays close to 200 dates each year and his extensive club and coffeehouse touring , together with radio airplay , has brought him a solid national following . 
 = = Growing up = = 
 Ellis Paul was born in Fort Kent , Maine , a small , rural potato @-@ farming town near the Canadian border . Paul 's family had strong connections to the potato industry — his father , Ed Plissey , was Executive Director of the Maine Potato Commission and his grandfather owned a 140 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 57 km2 ) potato farm . Schools in the area closed for three weeks each year so that school children could help with the potato harvest . Paul spent many hours working on his grandfather 's farm . Paul 's mother , the former Marilyn Bonney of <unk> , Maine , is a University of Maine graduate and was an extension agent for northern Aroostook County . She and her husband often worked together on special projects for the service . In the 1960s , Mrs. Plissey produced her own television show " The Aroostook Homemaker " which aired every third week on Presque Isle television station <unk> @-@ TV . 
 While attending high school in Presque Isle , Maine , Paul listened to Top @-@ 40 radio and participated in track . He played trumpet in the school 's stage band where he was introduced to the big band jazz music of Stan Kenton and Maynard Ferguson . He excelled in track , becoming the Maine State champion in five @-@ kilometer distance running , a feat that garnered several scholarship offers , including an offer from Boston College . Having graduated high school with the class of 1983 , Paul relocated to Boston , leaving small @-@ town rural life behind . In an interview with Daniel <unk> of the Boston Herald Paul stated , " It wasn 't until I went to Boston College on a track scholarship that I first heard folk . " Paul was particularly moved when he heard Bob Dylan singing " The House of the Rising Sun " . It was then that he began to take folk music seriously . 
 Paul was inducted into the Presque Isle High School Athletic Hall of Fame on Jan. 11 , 2013 . 
 = = Early career : 1987 – 1990 = = 
 Paul majored in English at Boston College where he continued to participate in track . His best time in the 10 @,@ 000 meters ( 30 : 18 : 50 ) remains the fourth best men 's outdoor record in Boston College history . When a knee injury in his junior year sidelined him from athletics , Paul picked up an acoustic guitar to pass the time . He taught himself to play guitar with the help of a Hits of the 70s songbook , and began to write songs . Boston radio included a classic hits station that played the music of Bob Dylan , Joni Mitchell , Neil Young and James Taylor ; artists who were mostly unfamiliar to Paul . Within a few years they became major influences . Having a career in music was the furthest thing from Paul 's mind at that point , but as his playing and writing improved it became a bigger focus in his life . In an interview with <unk> journalist Arthur Wood , Paul stated : 
 " I started playing and learned a few songs by other writers to begin with . I started writing originals within a few months . My songs were pretty horrendous to begin with . They kept getting better and better . When I graduated , I started playing at open mics in bars in Boston . Eventually discovered that there were folk clubs where people were actually listening , and not drinking and carousing while you played . I got involved in that circuit . I think that 's why I 've become so lyric conscious — because of those listening rooms , where you really have to rely on words in those situations . " 
 The open mic circuit in the Boston area included The Nameless Coffeehouse in Cambridge , <unk> 's Old Vienna <unk> and The Naked City Coffeehouse in Allston . Paul became a regular face at those clubs along with other young folk musicians such as Shawn Colvin , Patty Griffin , Dar Williams and Vance Gilbert . In 1989 he won the Nameless Coffeehouse 's New Songwriter Award . Paul played Cambridge 's Club Passim , a venue that would become his " home " venue , for the first time when he opened for John Gorka in October 1989 . Less than four years later he performed his first shows at Passim as a headliner . The three consecutive nights of shows took place on February 19 – 21 , 1993 . 
 It was at the Old Vienna that Paul met Jon Svetkey , Brian <unk> and Jim Infantino , all struggling young local musicians . In 1989 the four young men formed a collective called " End Construction " and in 1990 released a compilation of songs titled Resume Speed : New Artist Compilation on the End Construction Productions label . The four songwriters each performed four of his own original songs on the CD release . The Resume Speed liner notes stated that End Construction Productions was a small independent production , promotion and recording company run by songwriters and musicians " hellbent on getting the good music out there . " In the interview with Wood , Paul stated that the four songwriters started doing group shows together and collaborated on each other 's material . Although he goes on to say that the collaboration " was a good thing " and that the four musicians learned a lot from each other , eventually the foursome " burned out on the competitiveness " . The collaboration lasted three years . 
 Following his graduation from Boston College in 1987 , Paul worked a day @-@ job at the COMPASS school as a teacher and social worker with inner city school children performing at open mics three or four nights a week . It was not until the fall of 1992 that he quit his day @-@ job to pursue music as a full @-@ time career . During this period Paul met his manager , Ralph <unk> , and together they founded Black Wolf Records . In 1989 the label released Paul 's first two albums of original material : Am I Home and Urban Folksongs and Paul began touring outside the Boston area . Although originally released on cassette , the two albums were re @-@ released on CD in 2001 . 
 = = Rising success : 1990 – 2000 = = 
 Winning the Boston Acoustic Underground Award in 1991 resulted in Paul playing to the largest crowd of his career to that point – 300 . He continued to play in and around the New England area . Around this time , Windham Hill Records , which had previously released the Legacy songwriter compilation , put a call out to the music industry asking for songwriter submissions to be considered for the follow @-@ up Legacy II compilation . After the Old Vienna <unk> sent one of Paul 's tapes to Windham Hill , Paul 's " Ashes to Dust " from Urban Folksongs was chosen to be on the compilation . In the interview with Wood , Paul stated that he felt very excited to be on the Windham Hill release because it served as a calling card that every DJ and folk promoter in the country would recognize . Legacy II was released in 1992 and included songs performed by Patty Larkin , Patty Griffin , Greg Brown , Cheryl Wheeler and several others . Legacy II was Paul 's first national exposure . 
 After Paul opened for Bill Morrissey several times , Morrissey became one of Paul 's earliest mentors . Morrissey introduced Paul to the traditional songwriting of Woody Guthrie and Mississippi John Hurt , as well as songwriters of the 60s , such as Randy Newman . In a 2001 interview with Scott Alarik , Morrissey said that Paul jumped into listening to traditional songwriters " <unk> " and as a result is a much better writer and performer . 
 Paul asked Morrissey to produce his first album Say Something , which was released in 1993 on Black Wolf records . Fiddler Johnny Cunningham and guitarist Duke Levine , both friends of Morrissey 's , can be heard on the recording along with the background vocals of Patty Griffin . Scott Alarik wrote : " As his lovely , demanding and brilliant debut album Say Something attests , there is a precocious credibility and emotional truth to his real @-@ life ballads . " 
 Levine would co @-@ produce Paul 's follow @-@ up release Stories , which was released on Black Wolf in 1994 and re @-@ released on Rounder Records the following year . It was also in 1994 that Paul was first invited to play the Kerrville Folk Festival , winning the Kerrville New Folk award . 
 Paul became a follower of the music of Woody Guthrie during the early 1990s . In a 1998 Boston Globe article , Paul refers to a tattoo of Woody Guthrie on his right shoulder saying that Woody 's image was the only thing he could put on his body that would be " like a badge of who he was . " Paul 's tattoo of Woody Guthrie resulted in a chance meeting with Nora Guthrie , Woody Guthrie 's daughter , at a Folk Alliance Conference when Nora asked to see Paul 's tattoo . That chance meeting resulted in Paul being invited to perform at a Woody Guthrie tribute show at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland , Ohio . The 10 @-@ day celebration , held in September 1996 , included other notable musicians such as Bruce Springsteen , Billy Bragg , The Indigo Girls and Ani DiFranco . DiFranco 's record label , Righteous Babe , released a compilation of the event , ' Til We <unk> ' Em , in 2000 . 
 Jerry Marotta , a drummer who had worked with Peter Gabriel , produced Paul 's third CD release A Carnival of Voices which was released on Rounder in 1996 . Marotta brought in bassist Tony Levin , guitarist Bill Dillon , and once again Duke Levine . Paul stated that A Carnival of Voices comprised character sketches of different people in different towns tied to " the carnival mentality of traveling . " A Carnival of Voices hit # 3 on The CMJ New Music Report Triple chart and World Café voted it the # 1 album of the year . By 1997 Paul 's mailing list passed 7 @,@ 000 names as his fan @-@ base continued to grow . 
 As Paul 's reputation and popularity grew , he was asked to return to folk venues and festivals around the country including the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival , the Kerrville Folk Festival and the Newport Folk Festival . The number of shows he performed annually increased to more than 200 . Although Paul performed mostly self @-@ penned songs , he would often include a Woody Guthrie song into his set . Woody 's " Hard Travelin ' " was always a crowd pleaser , especially in Oklahoma , Woody 's birthplace . In July 1998 , the 1st Woody Guthrie Folk Festival was held in Woody 's hometown of Okemah , Oklahoma . Not only did Paul headline the festival along with Billy Bragg , but the city of Okemah made him an honorary citizen . Paul stated that when he made the pilgrimage to Okemah he felt that he was walking in Woody 's footsteps and that the experience was " like going to the mount " . Paul 's sixth CD , Translucent Soul , was released later that year in October . Again produced by Jerry Marotta , the title track is a song about his relationship with good friend Vance Gilbert and tackles the issue of racism . 
 At the end of the decade , Paul was invited to perform at Club Passim 's 40th anniversary show . The event took place on January 16 , 1999 at the Sanders Theater in Cambridge . The four @-@ hour sold @-@ out concert also included Patty Larkin , Joan Baez , The Nields , and others . Joan Anderman , covering the event for the Boston Globe , reported that Paul 's " thinking @-@ person 's poetry " at the Sanders theater was " embellished with the bite of an electric guitarist and the earthy cool of a percussionist " , and that his set was " a model of modern organic grace " .

 Paul released his first live recording , simply titled Live , on March 14 , 2000 . The double @-@ disk included recordings from several shows , as well as previously unreleased studio tracks . Highlights of the year 2000 included Paul singing the National Anthem at Fenway Park , and having his song " The World Ain 't Slowing Down " chosen for the theme song in the Farrelly brothers movie Me , Myself and Irene starring Jim Carrey and Renée Zellweger . Both events took place on the same June weekend . In November 2001 , Paul was again successful in having a song in a movie when " Sweet Mistakes " was featured in Shallow Hal starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Jack Black . Paul released his 8th CD , Sweet Mistakes , a collection of audience @-@ favorites not yet recorded , on November 15 , 2001 . In January 2002 , Paul was named the <unk> Artist of the Year for 2001 . 
 Paul often recites original poetry for his audiences . Some of those poems can be found in Notes from the Road , a collection of Paul 's original poems , lyrics , and journal entries published by Black Wolf Press in May 2002 . In her review for Performing Songwriter , Abby White said , " The book has an intimate , conversational tone , and Paul 's childlike drawings , song lyrics and poetry provide commercial breaks to his personal journal entries and vivid recollections of significant events he encounters while touring " . As the 21st century began Paul recited his " Millennium Poem " , regularly at shows . 
 In 2002 Paul became friends with Nora Guthrie . Nora Guthrie is executive director of the Woody Guthrie Foundation and Archives in New York City where hundreds of Woody Guthrie 's handwritten lyrics — many without music — are housed . She invited Paul to visit the Archives and choose one set of lyrics to put to song . Referring to the huge undertaking of finding songwriters to write music for hundreds of her father 's lyrics , Nora Guthrie stated that there was a " job description " that her father left behind that " Ellis took on " . Paul chose " God 's Promise " , lyrics that Woody had adapted in 1955 from " What God Hath Promised " , a hymn of the day and recorded it for his 2002 release Speed of Trees . Paul said that visiting the Woody Guthrie Archives was like going through a time capsule of his biggest hero and that the posthumous collaboration with Woody Guthrie was one of the " coolest things " he 'd ever done . The Nov. 5th episode of the TV series Ed featured Paul 's " If You Break Down " . 
 Paul 's connection to Woody Guthrie continued into 2003 when he was invited to perform in the Ribbon of Highway , Endless Skyway tribute show to honor Woody Guthrie . The ensemble show , which was the brainchild of Texas singer @-@ songwriter Jimmy LaFave , toured around the country and included a rotating cast of singer @-@ songwriters individually performing Guthrie 's songs . Interspersed between songs were Guthrie 's philosophical writings read by a narrator . In addition to LaFave and Paul , members of the rotating cast included <unk> Cleaves , Eliza Gilkyson , Joel Rafael , husband @-@ wife duo Sarah Lee Guthrie ( Woody Guthrie 's granddaughter ) and Johnny Irion , Michael <unk> , and The Burns Sisters . Oklahoma songwriter Bob Childers , sometimes called " the Dylan of the Dust , " served as narrator . When word spread about the tour , performers began contacting LaFave whose only prerequisite was to have an inspirational connection to Guthrie . Each artist chose the Guthrie songs that he or she would perform as part of the tribute . One of the songs Gilkyson chose was " Pastures of Plenty " , while Cleaves chose " This Morning I Am Born Again " - a song he wrote using Guthrie 's lyrics . One of the songs Paul chose was a song he wrote using Guthrie 's lyrics - " God 's Promise " . LaFave said , " It works because all the performers are Guthrie enthusiasts in some form " . The Ribbon of Highway tour kicked @-@ off on February 5 , 2003 at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville . The abbreviated show was a featured segment of " Nashville Sings Woody " , yet another tribute concert to commemorate the music of Woody Guthrie held during the Folk Alliance Conference . The cast of " Nashville Sings Woody " , a benefit for the Woody Guthrie Foundation and Archives , also included Arlo Guthrie , Marty Stuart , Nanci Griffith , Guy Clark , Ramblin ' Jack Elliott , Janis Ian , and others . 
 Paul 's 3000 Miles DVD was released in February 2003 . Divided into four segments , the DVD begins with a live show recorded on October 3 , 2001 at Boston 's Somerville Theater - a show that was the final date of a six @-@ week tour with Susan Werner . The second segment is a 39 @-@ minute road movie filmed in 1995 by Matt Linde , an independent filmmaker who accompanied Paul on a cross @-@ country tour . Individual vignettes chronicle shows , conversations and events in Paul 's daily life as a traveling musician . A third segment shows Paul demonstrating the open tunings he uses in many of his songs , while the final segment is a discussion of songwriting with fellow songwriters Christopher Williams and Vance Gilbert . In her review for Dirty Linen , Annette C. <unk> said , " In just under three hours , viewers are able to watch as Paul evolves from a young , inexperienced folk singer wearing a backwards baseball cap to the highly respected , confident , seasoned performer that he is today " .

 On May 1 , 2004 Paul was the recipient of the 2nd annual Boston College Arts Council Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement . The award was presented as part of the sixth annual Boston College Arts Festival . His appearances at the festival also included an " Inside the BC Studio " interview with music writer Scott Alarik , a master class on songwriting , and a concert . In 2004 Paul was also awarded his 13th Boston Music Award in the category of Outstanding Singer / Songwriter . At the time Paul was writing what he called " country tunes " when he teamed up with an Irish musician , producer , and studio expert named Flynn . This resulted in American Jukebox Fables , released April 5 , 2005 , a recording produced by Flynn that surprised some fans by melding folk , pop and electronica . Paul said that his collaboration with Flynn formed a partnership where he brought banjos and accordions and Flynn brought a laptop and keyboard . Although Paul knew that the end result would fall outside the comfort zone of some fans who expected another acoustic folk album , experimenting with Flynn 's musical chemistry set injected excitement and fun into the recording project . 
 Since approximately 1995 ( no one seems to know for certain ) , Paul has annually played Club Passim over New Year 's , performing two shows on December 30 and two shows on New Year 's Eve . In early 2006 Black Wolf Records released Live at Club Passim , a recording compiled from Paul 's 2005 New Year 's Eve shows . In May 2006 , Paul toured Europe and England playing to sold @-@ out shows in Paris , France ; Twickenham , England ; Cheltenham , England and Wasserburg , Germany . The tour also included two BBC radio interviews and a radio interview in Paris . Paul was included on the Woody Guthrie Coalition 's DVD Woody Sez : a Tribute to Woody Guthrie released in 2006 . The tribute show , recorded July 13 , 2005 at the Crystal Theater in Okemah , Oklahoma , included Paul performing a duet with The Burns Sisters on " God 's Promise " . Also released in 2006 was Paul 's " best of " album , released as Ellis Paul Essentials , on October 10 . The two @-@ disk retrospective of Paul 's 15 @-@ year career contained some songs that were absolutes and others that were included based on polls held on his website and discussion board . In his <unk> review of Ellis Paul Essentials , Arthur Wood stated : " If you 've never visited " musically " with Mr. Ellis Paul , Essentials is a stunning place to start . " In his review for The Washington Post , Mike Joyce said " Essentials , a career @-@ spanning double CD from veteran singer @-@ songwriter Ellis Paul , has a few newly produced , John Jennings @-@ helmed tracks of previously recorded tunes that help set this compilation apart from most retrospectives . " In her review for Sing Out ! , Kari <unk> said " Paul 's Essentials is just that and a must for your folk collection . " 
 In January 2008 , Paul released a children 's and family record entitled The Dragonfly Races . Inspired after the birth of his second daughter , Paul said that he wanted to teach his children about the world through the use of music . The songs are meant to be enjoyed by both children and adults , and Paul said " I wanted my kids to hear music with social commentary and some fantasy involved . " Scott Alarik said " Paul sings movingly about what really worries new parents , and turns lazy dragonflies , gentle monsters , and resilient roses into useful metaphors for world peace , the power of faith , and the delights of a sleepy day . " In April 2008 the Parents ' Choice Foundation awarded The Dragonfly Races a Silver Medallion . The Parents ' Choice Awards program honors the best material for children in these categories : books , toys , music and storytelling , magazines , software , videogames , television and websites . 
 In 2009 , country musician Jack Ingram chose to record a song written by Paul . According to CMT , Paul 's " The World Ain 't Slowing Down " , may be the song that takes Ingram to the " next level " . Ingram says " It 'll be fun for me to expose people to a fantastic song from an artist who 's had a 20 @-@ year career of being a very successful folk artist . "

 Paul 's sixteenth CD , The Day After Everything Changed , was released on January 12 , 2010 . Rather than work with a record label , Paul invited fans to help finance the recording by offering donors various premiums determined by the level of donation . Although Paul wasn 't sure what to expect when the United States economy collapsed , the fan @-@ funding initiative resulted in more than $ 100 @,@ 000 being collected - more , according to Paul , - than any label had ever spent on him . Recorded in Nashville with a guest appearance by Kristian Bush that includes a duet on the track , " Paper Dolls " , Paul says the fan support inspired him to make " the best record I could " . One reviewer wrote : " This is such a tuneful , beautifully drawn set of songs played and sung with authority that it reminds you how much we need storytellers back in pop music — storytellers with empathy , fine eyes and an understanding that even though we live in a soulless , indifferent world our music doesn 't have to reflect our culture . " In her review for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange , Roberta Schwartz said that the CD is " a masterwork filled with the best music and lyrics of his career . " 
 Five concerts commemorating Paul 's 20th anniversary in the music business took place at Boston 's Club Passim the weekend of July 9 – 10 , 2010 . Paul performed his eight solo albums in chronological order over four shows . In addition , he also performed a children 's concert . The Mayor of Boston , Thomas M. Menino , proclaimed July 9 , 2010 as Ellis Paul Day in the City of Boston . 
 WUMB announced that its listeners voted The Day After Everything Changed one of the Top 10 CDs of 2010 . 
 Paul 's second children 's album , The Hero in You , was released on January 1 , 2012 . The songs on the album are all written about persons who Paul considers to be American heroes including Benjamin Franklin , Thomas Edison , Georgia O 'Keeffe , and Rosa Parks . The album is Paul 's attempt to teach children about some of America 's most famous heroes . " I was a big fan of Schoolhouse Rock in the 70s . There was always a really great charm about the music . The main reason I can still remember the Preamble of the Constitution is because of those little songs " , Paul said . The illustrations in the accompanying lyrics booklet were all created by Paul . 
 In a review for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange , Roberta Schwartz said that The Hero in You contains some of the best melodies and most moving lyrics of Paul 's career . She goes on to cite " Chief Joseph " as an example - a song that incorporates one of the most famous quotes in Native American history : " I will fight no more forever " . 
 The Hero in You received a Gold Medal from the Parents ' Choice Foundation . 
 Paul 's first Christmas album , City of Silver Dreams , was released on December 1 , 2012 . Produced by Flynn , the album consists of nine original songs - several co @-@ written with Kristian Bush - and one cover song , the classic " Have Yourself a Very Merry Christmas " written by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane . In her review for No Depression , Holley Dey wrote : " It 's a collection with multifaceted personality , offering both melodic romanticism and a folk styled humor that <unk> with good natured fun . " 
 On July 12 , 2014 , Paul was one of four performers inducted into the Maine Music Awards Hall of Fame . The awards ceremony took place in the Portland ( Maine ) Civic Center . Paul performed along with other members of the inaugural class which included Don McLean , Howie Day , and David Mallett . 
 Paul 's 19th and second fan @-@ funded album , Chasing Beauty , was released on September 9 , 2014 . The 14 @-@ track CD was produced by Kristian Bush ( Sugarland ) and Brandon Bush ( Train ) and recorded primarily in Decatur , Georgia . Paul is supported by Kristian Bush ( acoustic / electric guitar , mandolin , banjo , bass ) , Brandon Bush ( keyboards ) , Sugarland ’ s Travis McNabb ( drums ) , Gray Griggs ( bass ) , Megan Lovell ( lap steel ) , Tim Smith ( bass ) , Ben Torres ( trombone ) , Michael Snell ( trumpet ) and Brandyn Taylor ( baritone sax ) .

 In September 2003 Paul released Side of the Road , a duo album recorded with good friend Vance Gilbert . The two songwriters , who have often shared the stage , each chose four cover songs to record - individual favorites - plus one song of their own . Although the album did not start out as a " 9 / 11 " project , the inclusion of Mark <unk> 's " The Only Way " set a theme . A review in No Depression magazine said this about Paul and Gilbert 's choice of songs : 
 " Thematically they 're mostly about individuals — indeed , an entire planet — in desperate need of healing . To that end , Paul 's original tune " Citizen of the World " is a wonderful balm , as he and Gilbert trade lyrics about the crossed bloodlines , attitudes and experiences that make us all brothers and sisters . Their version of Van Morrison 's " Comfort You " works magic of a similar sort . " 
 Sugarland 's first holiday album , Gold and Green released on October 13 , 2009 includes " City of Silver Dreams " and " Little Wood Guitar " , co @-@ written by Paul and Kristian Bush . In his review of the album , Matt Bjorke wrote , " City of Silver Dreams " could actually find itself a seminal holiday song like Joni Mitchell 's " River " as it tells a wonderfully soft and melodic story of New York City and the beauty of a new romance within the context of Christmas . "

 " Boston @-@ style " songwriting refers to the introspective and literate breed of singer @-@ songwriter so prevalent in the modern folk music landscape . According to Paul , Boston @-@ style songwriting grew out of Boston 's thriving folk scene with its dense collection of colleges , college radio stations and listening rooms . Boston radio includes the University of Massachusetts ' WUMB , the country 's foremost radio station for folk and acoustic music 24 @-@ hours a day . Paul said the Boston songwriters tend to be more thoughtful and soft because in an intimate listening room , " all you 've got is you and your words . " Boston @-@ style songwriting tends to be more about lyric than melody , is intimate and thoughtful but also relevant , often addressing social issues . Boston @-@ style songwriting does not only refer to Boston musicians , but includes national artists such as Shawn Colvin , John Gorka , Susan Werner , Bill Morrissey , and Dar Williams . In an interview with Paul Freeman for the East Bay Daily News , Paul commented on how he hopes audience members relate to his songs , " Each song is supposed to be like a little three @-@ dimensional world . I 'm hoping to invite them in , have them make out the details and the reasons for being there , and apply them to their own lives . But I 'm also hoping to entertain them . " 
 After graduating from Boston College , Paul worked as a case worker at an inner city school in the Jamaica Plain section of Boston , working with children with behavioral problems and also worked as a social worker in Boston with clients who were drug dealers , rapists , and other kinds of criminal offenders . His work experiences opened his eyes to see the world in a broader , more open @-@ minded way and provided material for the songs he was beginning to write . Early in his career Paul promised himself that he would always write about the things he knew well . In her review of Ellis Paul Live for the Folk and Music Exchange , Roberta Schwartz said , " His finely honed songs tell stories filled with images that sparkle like jewels . His is a poet 's heart , and a romantic 's soul . He is an optimist who believes in people and possibilities . " 
 In her 1993 review of Paul 's Say Something , Debbie Catalano wrote , " Ellis Paul draws a picture with his words then draws you into the world he 's painting . " Like a Norman Rockwell painting , Paul 's songs are replete with crucial details and careful observations that tell a story with a minimum or words . In a 2002 article , Thomas Conner dissected a verse from Paul 's " Conversation with a Ghost " from Say Something . " Instead of bluntly saying , " I ran into an old flame in Central Park " , Paul writes around it , avoiding the clichés , painting the picture , showing us everything — the motives , the setting , the serendipity — except what we expect . " 
 When teaching songwriting classes , Paul often introduces aspiring songwriters to his " six @-@ step program to effective songwriting " which is based on the premise that songwriters should show and not tell . Paul teaches this six @-@ step method to develop a character in a song : 
 Choose a name for the person . 
 List five items in the person 's bedroom . 
 List five things the person would see if he or she looked in a mirror . 
 Choose two colors that bring the person to mind . 
 Choose one non @-@ human metaphor describing the person . 
 Write one line of dialogue that conveys the way the person speaks . 
 The most important advice he gives aspiring songwriters is to write what you know or what you 've experienced . " Use reality as the springboard to whatever you 're writing about " , Paul said . Paul also says that being a successful songwriter is like being a journalist who writes about what he sees and knows , the times people are living in and the things people are facing today . " The journalist looks out the window and writes about what is really happening . " " I make sure it 's real . I don 't want to fictionalize about things I haven 't witnessed . " Paul states that over the years he 's learned the value of simplicity in writing . He 's learned that he can say more when he writes more simply and direct . " It 's almost as if you can be complex and intricate by adopting a shorter , less complicated structure . " " I 'm not doing rocket science -- I 'm a storyteller " , he said . " I hope to inspire people to think and feel and to walk out with more than they came in with . " 
 When asked to describe the difference between writing songs for children and song for adults , Paul said : " The difference between writing a kids ' song and an adult song is that in the kids ' songs you tend to use primary colors and the words are brighter and the tempos are always upbeat . There 's a nuance to the adult songs that is different . It 's still the story telling , but its different shades and angles . You read between the lines more . " 
 Paul continues playing close to 200 dates annually on the folk circuit . His songs have appeared on more than 50 compilation CDs , and he has made nearly 40 guest appearances on the albums of artists including Lori McKenna , David Wilcox and Mark <unk> . When asked if he would rather play the 19 @,@ 600 @-@ seat Fleet Theater or the 900 @-@ seat Somerville Theater – both in Boston , Paul replied , " I prefer to keep it intimate . That way people can see the whites of your eyes . I 'd love to write a hit song and have it on the radio like " American Pie " or something , but I 'm just gonna do what I do and take what I can and run with it , because it 's a hard business to have even what I have . So I don 't have pie @-@ in @-@ the @-@ sky Springsteen @-@ esque hopes . I just want to write great songs . " 
 In a review for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange , Roberta Schwartz said , " Ellis Paul is one of the best singer / songwriters of his generation . And for many of us he is the face of contemporary folk music — few are as smart , as literate and as poetic as Paul . He has spun his story songs for nearly twenty years now , and has eleven studio recordings ( with an additional two early recordings on cassette — now available on CD ) to his credit . I cannot think of another artist on the acoustic music scene who is better @-@ loved by fans , or more respected by his contemporaries . "

The accompanying CD allows young readers to listen to each song while discovering additional facts about Paul 's heroes on each page . 
 Paul 's second children 's book was published - again by Albert Whitman & Company - in October 2015 . Based on his Christmas poem The Night the Lights Went Out on Christmas , the book , illustrated by Scott Brundage , is the whimsical yet heartwarming story of a neighborhood where families trying to outdo one another with Christmas lights and decorations use so much electrical power that the neighborhood is thrown into darkness . The poem originally appeared on Paul 's City of Silver Dreams Christmas CD and is included as a downloadable mp3 file with the book .

 = Interstate TDR = 
 The Interstate TDR was an early unmanned combat aerial vehicle — referred to at the time as an " assault drone " — developed by the Interstate Aircraft and Engineering Corporation during the Second World War for use by the United States Navy . Capable of being armed with bombs or torpedoes , 2000 aircraft were ordered , but only around 200 were built . The type saw some service in the Pacific Theater against the Japanese , but continuing developmental issues affecting the aircraft , along with the success of operations using more conventional weapons , led to the decision being made to cancel the assault drone program in October 1944 . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 In 1936 , Lieutenant Commander Delmar S. <unk> proposed that unpiloted , remotely controlled aircraft had potential for use by the United States Navy in combat operations . Due to the limitations of the technology of the time , development of the " assault drone " project was given a low priority , but by the early 1940s the development of the radar altimeter and television made the project more feasible , and following trials using converted manned aircraft , the first operational test of a drone against a naval target was conducted in April 1942 . That same month , following trials of the Naval Aircraft Factory TDN assault drone , Interstate Aircraft received a contract from the Navy for two prototype and 100 production aircraft to a simplified and improved design , to be designated TDR @-@ 1 . 
 Control of the TDR @-@ 1 would be conducted from either a control aircraft , usually a Grumman TBF Avenger , with the operator viewing a tv screen showing the view from a camera mounted aboard the drone along with the radar altimeter 's readout , or via a pilot on board the TDR @-@ 1 for test flights . Powered by two Lycoming O @-@ 435 engines of 220 horsepower ( 160 kW ) each , the TDR @-@ 1 used a remarkably simple design , with a steel @-@ tube frame constructed by the <unk> bicycle company covered with a molded wood skin , thus making little use of strategic materials so as not to impede production of higher priority aircraft . Capable of being optionally piloted for test flights , an aerodynamic fairing was used to cover the cockpit area during operational missions . The TDR @-@ 1 was equipped with a fixed tricycle landing gear , that on operations would be jettisoned following takeoff for improved performance . 
 = = Operational history = = 
 Under the code @-@ name Operation Option , the Navy projected that up to 18 squadrons of assault drones would be formed , with 162 Grumman TBF Avenger control aircraft and 1000 assault drones being ordered . However technical difficulties in the development of the TDR @-@ 1 , combined with a continued low priority given to the project , saw the contract modified with the order reduced to only around 300 aircraft . A single TDR @-@ 1 was tested by the U.S. Army Air Forces as the XBQ @-@ 4 , however no production contract resulted from this testing . 
 In 1944 , under the control of the Special Air Task Force ( <unk> ) , the TDR @-@ 1 was deployed operationally to the South Pacific for operations against the Japanese . TDR @-@ 1 aircraft equipped a single mixed squadron ( Special Air Task Group 1 ) along with TBM Avenger control aircraft , and the first operational mission took place on September 27 , conducting bombing operations against Japanese ships . Despite this success , the assault drone program had already been canceled after the production of 189 TDR @-@ 1 aircraft , due to a combination of continued technical problems , the aircraft failing to live up to expectations , and the fact that more conventional weaponry was proving adequate for the defeat of Japan . The final mission was flown on October 27 , with 50 drones having been expended on operations , 31 aircraft successfully striking their targets , without loss to the pilots of STAG @-@ 1 . 
 Following the war , some TDR @-@ 1s were converted for operation as private <unk> .

 = Cyclone Bingiza = 
 Tropical Cyclone Bingiza was the only named storm to make landfall in the inactive 2010 – 11 South @-@ West Indian Ocean cyclone season . The second of three storms , Bingiza developed on February 9 to the northeast of Madagascar . For a few days it meandered generally southwestward , failing to intensify significantly . On February 12 , the storm began a steady westward track as environmental conditions became more favorable . In a 24 ‑ hour period , Bingiza developed from a moderate tropical storm into an intense tropical cyclone with a well @-@ defined eye . After attaining peak 10 – minute sustained winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) , the cyclone moved ashore in northeastern Madagascar on February 14 and quickly weakened as it crossed the country . It emerged into the Mozambique Channel as a weak tropical disturbance , and it turned southward to move across western Madagascar . Bingiza attained tropical storm status before making its final landfall near Morondava , dissipating on February 18 . 
 Across Madagascar , the cyclone killed 34 people and injured 13 others . High winds destroyed 25 @,@ 464 houses , which left 25 @,@ 845 people homeless . Bingiza first affected the Masoala National Park , destroying half of a village and leaving it isolated . High winds and heavy rainfall left over 500 <unk> ( 195 mi2 ) of damaged crops , which increased food prices and threatened the economic livelihoods of the affected people . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Cyclone Bingiza were from a persistent area of disorganized convection on February 8 , about 880 km ( 545 mi ) north @-@ northeast of Réunion . At the time , the system consisted of a poorly defined circulation , located in an area of low wind shear . It moved west @-@ southwestward along the northern periphery of a ridge , and its convection gradually became more organized over the center . On February 9 , Météo @-@ France ( MF ) classified the system as Tropical Disturbance 5 , and six hours later upgraded it to a tropical depression . Shortly thereafter , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert after convective banding and outflow increased . Following intensification of the depression into a moderate tropical storm , MF advised the Madagascan Weather Service to name the storm as Bingiza which they did late on February 9 . 
 Upon becoming a tropical storm , Bingiza was located in an area of weak steering currents , which resulted in a slow , meandering motion toward the southwest . Its motion turned to the south on February 10 , with conditions only marginally favorable for further intensification . After two days of meandering without strengthening , Bingiza turned to the southwest on due to a building ridge to its southwest toward Madagascar . Around the same time , upper @-@ level conditions began improving , which allowed the convection to increase in coverage . Based on the improved appearance , MF upgraded Bingiza to a severe tropical storm at 0600 UTC on February 12 about 335 km ( 210 mi ) east of the coast of Madagascar . Later that day an eye became apparent on satellite imagery , signaling the beginning of a rapid deepening trend . Late on February 12 , MF upgraded Bingiza to tropical cyclone intensity , which is the equivalent of a hurricane or typhoon . With minimal wind shear and warm waters , the agency forecast the cyclone to intensify further to peak 10 – sustained winds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) . Continuing to strengthen , Bingiza attained 10 minute sustained winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) early on February 13 . Similarly , the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute sustained winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) , noting a contracting eye 37 km ( 23 mi ) in diameter in the process of an eyewall replacement cycle . 
 Despite initial forecasts , the cyclone failed to strengthen further due to interaction with Madagascar . Early on February 14 , Bingiza made landfall along the Masoala Peninsula with winds of at least 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) . It emerged into the Antongil Bay , before moving ashore north of <unk> . It quickly weakened over land , although it produced heavy rainfall along its northern periphery . Early on February 15 , Bingiza weakened to a tropical depression . The center became difficult to locate over land , although it emerged into the Mozambique Channel north of Besalampy as a tropical disturbance . After moving over waters , the system was able to re @-@ intensify due to favorable water temperatures and inflow . It quickly organized into a tropical depression again , although strengthening was halted after it turned southward over western Madagascar due to a ridge to its north . It again moved into the Mozambique Channel , and Bingiza re @-@ intensified into a tropical storm on February 17 . The storm developed a concentrated area of convection near the center , as well as a poorly defined eye . The re @-@ intensification was short @-@ lived after Bingiza made its final landfall just south of Morondava around 1330 UTC on February 17 . Around that time , the circulation was dissipating over land , and its remnants left the island on February 19 . 
 = = Impact = = 
 When Bingiza made its first Madagascar landfall , it became the first cyclone to strike the country in the cyclone season . It first moved through the Masoala National Park , a sparsely @-@ populated protected region with significant amounts of trees . In <unk> , located along the Masoala peninsula , the cyclone destroyed half of the buildings as well as the roads and bridges , leaving it only accessible by boat . The cyclone affected five districts , primarily Mananara Nord . There , an early report indicated that 80 % of the houses were destroyed , along with one hospital and four other health facilities . The high winds caused heavy crop damage , including to rice and banana , which left minimal food supplies in some areas . The vanilla crop was also severely affected , and the mayor of Mananara was uncertain whether any of the crop could be harvested . Bingiza struck at what one relief worker described as the " worst time of year for a cyclone " , because many farmers were unable to replant their damaged crops . The cyclone damaged 40 % of the food crops and 10 % of the cash crops in <unk> , as well as 70 % of the food crops in <unk> . Overall , the cyclone destroyed 405 @.@ 23 km2 ( 156 @.@ 46 mi2 ) of rice fields , as well as 101 @.@ 67 km2 ( 39 @.@ 26 mi2 ) of other crops . The cyclone also damaged the road infrastructure in Mananara , which made it difficult to transport fish in the region to other areas of the country . The resulting crop and road damage resulted in increased food prices . 
 Across its path , Bingiza destroyed 25 @,@ 464 houses and damaged 36 schools . Overall , the damage was less than expected , given the strength of the cyclone . Most of the damage occurred due to the poor infrastructure and drainage systems of Madagascar , along with high levels of poverty . A total of 34 deaths were reported , along with 13 injuries . When Bingiza made its final landfall , it produced five days of rainfall to a region already severely affected by flooding . In Vangaindrano district in southeastern Madagascar , the cyclone caused widespread flooding that isolated five villages , as well as covering fields of rice and other crops . A total of 310 people in the southern portion of the country were left homeless . 
 Immediately after the storm moved ashore , high winds prevented disaster teams from assessing damage in the affected areas . By February 18 , CARE international had dispatched relief teams to the most affected regions . The teams distributed plastic tarps and food for 10 @,@ 000 people . High winds halted locust @-@ control operations , while heavy rainfall provided favorable breeding conditions . In the area of the cyclone 's first landfall , most people were able to rebuild their houses using trees and supplies from the surrounding countryside . Overall , about 25 @,@ 845 people became homeless due to the cyclone , although most were able to return to their homes after a few days after they were repaired . In the months after the storm 's passage , the European Commission allocated € 200 @,@ 000 ( $ 287 @,@ 000 USD ) to CARE France for the storm victims . 
 = 2015 Gent – Wevelgem = 
 The 2015 Gent – Wevelgem was a one @-@ day cycling classic that took place in Belgium and France on 29 March 2015 . It was the 77th edition of the Gent – Wevelgem race ; it took place on 29 March and was the seventh race of the 2015 UCI World Tour . The defending champion was John Degenkolb ( Giant – Alpecin ) , who had won the 2014 edition in a bunch sprint . 
 Gent – Wevelgem is part of the spring classics season and is known as the " sprinter 's classic " , because its terrain is less challenging than most of the other classics . The 2015 edition followed a 239 @.@ 1 @-@ kilometre ( 148 @.@ 6 mi ) route that started in Deinze and ended in Wevelgem . The race took place in difficult weather conditions with heavy wind and rain ; as a result , only 39 riders finished the race of the 200 who had started . The race was won by Luca Paolini ( Team Katusha ) , who attacked a small group in the final 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) and took a solo victory . Niki Terpstra ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) sprinted to second place , ahead of Geraint Thomas ( Team Sky ) . 
 = = Route = = 
 The 2015 Gent – Wevelgem was 239 @.@ 1 kilometres ( 148 @.@ 6 mi ) in length , starting in the Belgian city of Deinze , west of the city of Gent , and finishing in Wevelgem . Most of the spring classics centre around Oudenaarde and the many small hills in the nearby region . Gent – Wevelgem , however , travels west into West Flanders and France and has fewer hills , making it more suitable for sprinters . 
 After the race began in the Grote Markt in Deinze , the route took the riders west towards the coast ; after 73 kilometres ( 45 mi ) of flat roads , they reached <unk> , southwest of Nieuwpoort , where the route turned south . They travelled another 23 kilometres ( 14 mi ) before reaching <unk> and , after 97 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 60 @.@ 8 mi ) , entered the Nord department of France . The first 12 kilometres ( 7 mi ) of French roads took them west , before they turned south at Wormhout . The first climb of the day came another 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) later , as the riders climbed the <unk> . A 6 kilometres ( 4 mi ) loop brought them round to climb the <unk> a second time , though from a different direction . 
 The route then turned east . The final French climb was the Catsberg , which came after 143 kilometres ( 89 mi ) . The riders continued east after this and , after 148 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 92 @.@ 1 mi ) , re @-@ entered Belgium at <unk> , on the outskirts of <unk> , to enter the key section of the race . This began with the climb of the Baneberg , 152 kilometres ( 94 mi ) from the start . 8 kilometres ( 5 mi ) later , they climbed the Kemmelberg in the town of Kemmel . 4 kilometres ( 2 mi ) after that , they climbed the Monteberg . This succession of climbs was interspersed with steep descents , including the difficult descent of the Kemmelberg . A flat , 29 kilometres ( 18 mi ) section of road followed , as the route went east towards Mesen , then gradually looped back west through <unk> . After this flat section , the riders returned to the same roads that they had ridden previously and repeated the Baneberg – Kemmelberg – Monteberg sequence of climbs . 
 At the top of the second climb of the Monteberg , there were 34 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 21 @.@ 5 mi ) remaining , mostly on flat roads . The route turned north @-@ east out of Kemmel to Ypres , where several cobbled roads were used . After Ypres , the route turned east through Menen and into Wevelgem .

 As Gent – Wevelgem is a UCI World Tour event , all 17 UCI WorldTeams were invited automatically and were obliged to send a squad . Eight Professional Continental teams received wildcard invitations . With eight riders on each team , the peloton at the beginning of the race was made up of 200 riders . 
 = = Pre @-@ race favourites = = 
 The 2015 Gent – Wevelgem was without two of the main classics riders , Tom Boonen ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) and Fabian Cancellara ( Trek Factory Racing ) , both of whom had been injured in races earlier in the spring . However , their absence was not expected to affect the race as much as it would other races in the classics season , such as the Tour of Flanders the following weekend , as Gent @-@ Wevelgem is particularly suited to sprinters . This is because it has fewer climbs than the other spring classics ; difficulty often comes from crosswinds on the exposed parts of West Flanders . 
 The defending champion , John Degenkolb ( Giant – Alpecin ) , was the principal favourite for victory before the race . He had won Milan – San Remo the week before and was in good form . Degenkolb is seen as a sprinter , but has good ability at getting over short climbs , having had no difficulty on the Kemmelberg in the 2014 Gent – Wevelgem . 
 Alexander Kristoff ( Team Katusha ) , who was second in Milan – San Remo and fourth a few days earlier at E3 Harelbeke , was also among the favourites , especially in the bad weather expected for Gent – Wevelgem . Peter Sagan ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) , the 2013 champion , was also in form following E3 Harelbeke , and was expected to be able to win either from a bunch sprint or from an attack . 
 The Etixx – Quick @-@ Step team was also expected to feature strongly in the race , even in Boonen 's absence . They were led by Mark Cavendish , one of the strongest sprinters , who had already won Kuurne – Brussels – Kuurne , which is similar to Gent – Wevelgem . Other options for the team included Zdeněk Štybar , second in E3 Harelbeke . Team Sky also brought a strong squad . Their team included Geraint Thomas , the winner of E3 Harelbeke , Ian Stannard , the winner of the Omloop Het Nieuwsblad , and Bradley Wiggins , but they were expected to support sprinter Elia Viviani . 
 There were many other riders considered to have a chance of victory in the race . These included classics riders such as Sep Vanmarcke ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) , Daniel Oss and Greg Van Avermaet ( both BMC Racing Team ) and sprinters such as André Greipel ( Lotto – Soudal ) , Arnaud Démare ( FDJ ) , Nacer Bouhanni ( Cofidis ) , Sam Bennett ( Bora – Argon 18 ) , Heinrich Haussler ( IAM Cycling ) , Sacha Modolo ( Lampre – Merida ) , Adam Blythe ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) , Tyler Farrar and Edvald Boasson Hagen ( both MTN – Qhubeka ) . Moreno Hofland ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) was also expected to be among the favourites , but he withdrew the day before the race with an illness . 
 = = Race report = = 
 The race took place in very wet and windy conditions . This included a headwind in the early stages of the race , which delayed the formation of a breakaway . When the breakaway did form , it included seven riders , who built up a nine @-@ minute lead within the first hour of racing . These riders were Tim <unk> ( Team Roompot ) , Alexis Gougeard ( AG2R La Mondiale ) , Albert Timmer ( Giant – Alpecin ) , Alex Dowsett ( Movistar Team ) , Pavel Brutt ( Tinkoff @-@ Saxo ) , Jesse Sergent ( Trek Factory Racing ) and Mirko Tedeschi ( Southeast Pro Cycling ) . Soon afterwards the peloton was split into groups as riders began to withdraw from the race . The principal difficulty throughout the race was the wind : Cyclingnews.com described the riders as " constantly balancing on their bike , leaning into the wind , trying not to be blown off the road " . 
 As the riders entered the flat lands near the Belgian coast , the winds became more problematic . Around three @-@ quarters of the peloton had been dropped or had withdrawn from the race by the time the riders turned back inland . Gert <unk> ( Trek Factory Racing ) was blown sideways into a ditch ; the wind knocked several other riders over and caused Martin Velits ( Etixx @-@ Quick Step ) and Lars Bak ( Lotto @-@ Soudal ) to withdraw from the race . Mark Cavendish crashed and was forced to chase to attempt to rejoin the leading riders . The conditions were so severe that some team officials called for the race to be neutralised to ensure the riders ' safety . Shortly afterwards , two large groups came back together . The main peloton was therefore made up of around 100 riders and was approximately two minutes behind the breakaway . The breakaway was caught soon afterwards . 
 Around Cassel , the peloton was again split into small groups by the strong winds . The front group was reduced to 25 riders . Bradley Wiggins was left behind and withdrew from the race , along with Edvald Boasson Hagen ( MTN @-@ Qhubeka ) , who had hit a pole by the side of the road and had broken his clavicle . The front group included Vanmarcke , Thomas , Kristoff and Sagan , with Démare , Greipel , Matti Breschel and Van Avermaet joining soon afterwards . On the Catsberg , Maarten Tjallingii ( LottoNL – Jumbo ) attacked alone and gained a one @-@ minute lead over the main group . Several riders attacked the group but no one was able to get away and they came to the Kemmelberg together . 
 Jürgen Roelandts ( Lotto @-@ Soudal ) attacked after the summit of the Kemmelberg . He initially built a small lead over the chasing group , which was led by riders from Etixx @-@ Quick Step . They stopped chasing , however , after Zdeněk Štybar suffered a puncture . This allowed riders to attack the group . Stijn Vandenbergh ( Etixx @-@ Quick Step ) was the first to attack ; he was then joined first by Daniel Oss ( BMC ) and Thomas , and then also by Jens Debusschere ( Lotto @-@ Soudal ) and Vanmarcke . Despite their superior numbers , Roelandts as able to maintain his lead ; the peloton , meanwhile , quickly fell a long way behind . Riders continued to crash during this period , including Sylvain Chavanel ( IAM Cycling ) and Mat Hayman ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) . Jack Bauer ( Cannondale @-@ Garmin ) suffered a crash when another rider 's rain jacket got caught in the spokes of his wheels ; he picked up his bike and threw it into a ditch . With many of the team cars full , some riders asked for directions so that they could ride directly to their team hotels rather than completing the race . 
 Luca Paolini ( Katusha ) attacked from the main group and caught the five chasers , with Niki Terpstra ( Etixx @-@ Quick Step ) doing the same shortly afterwards . While Paolini and Terpstra were chasing , Geraint Thomas was blown violently from his bike , landing on his left shoulder . He landed on the grass and was able to rejoin the group , although he appeared to be shaken by the crash . As the riders approached the Kemmelberg for the final time , Roelandts had a lead of around two minutes . Vandenbergh led up the climb , with Thomas following closely and the other riders struggling . Vanmarcke and Terpstra soon caught up , with Debusschere quickly following . Paolini eventually returned to the group , but Oss was unable to do so . As they crossed the final climb of the day with 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) remaining , Roelandts had a one @-@ minute lead ahead of the six @-@ man group . 
 By this point , Roelandts had led solo for around 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) and was beginning to struggle . He was caught with around 20 kilometres ( 12 mi ) remaining . As he was caught , Terpstra suffered a puncture . He quickly returned to the group and immediately attacked , with Paolini joining him . Thomas led the chase , with Vanmarcke and Debusschere looking tired . The six riders therefore came into the final 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) together . With around 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) remaining , Paolini attacked and was chased down by the other riders ; he then attacked again and built a gap , which he was able to maintain to the finish . Terpstra beat Thomas to second place , followed by Vandenbergh , Debusschere , and Vanmarcke within a minute and Roelandts and Oss further behind . The main peloton came in more than five minutes behind Paolini , with Kristoff winning the sprint for ninth place ahead of Sagan . Only 39 riders finished the race .

 There was widespread comment in the media after the race about the weather conditions . Cyclingnews.com described it as " mayhem " and " one of the wildest [ races ] in recent years " . Paolini said that he had crashed twice on the way to victory and had used a total of three bikes , but also that he had been lucky later in the race . He said " we 're up in the north and this is real cycling " . Paolini pointed at his head and heart as he crossed the finish line – the same gesture that he had performed when winning a stage in the 2013 Giro d 'Italia – and explained the gesture as indicating that such wins required " head and heart as much as legs " . 
 Patrick <unk> , the Etixx @-@ Quick Step team manager , afterwards described the team 's " bad luck " throughout the race , which included crashes for Cavendish and Martin Velits and punctures for Terpstra and Štybar . <unk> pointed to the absence of Tom Boonen as a reason for his riders ' nervousness . Geraint Thomas felt that the other riders had been looking at him in particular to chase Paolini because of his win in the E3 Harelbeke ; he said that he " didn 't have much left " in the sprint at the end of the race . 
 VeloNews wrote that the riders had come close to calling for the neutralisation of the race because of the extreme weather conditions . The winds reached approximately 70 to 80 km / h ( 40 – 50 mph ) and were so strong that the riders were even unable to form into echelons . However the website also quoted Brian Cookson , the president of the UCI , who described the conditions as " very difficult , but not impossible " and the race as " a real classic " . 
 = Mechanical @-@ electrical analogies = 
 Mechanical @-@ electrical analogies are the representation of mechanical systems as electrical networks . At first , such analogies were used in reverse to help explain electrical phenomena in familiar mechanical terms . James Clerk Maxwell introduced analogies of this sort in the 19th century . However , as electrical network analysis matured it was found that certain mechanical problems could more easily be solved through an electrical analogy . Theoretical developments in the electrical domain that were particularly useful were the representation of an electrical network as an abstract topological diagram ( the circuit diagram ) using the lumped element model and the ability of network analysis to synthesise a network to meet a prescribed frequency function . 
 This approach is especially useful in the design of mechanical filters — these use mechanical devices to implement an electrical function . However , the technique can be used to solve purely mechanical problems , and can also be extended into other , unrelated , energy domains . Nowadays , analysis by analogy is a standard design tool wherever more than one energy domain is involved . It has the major advantage that the entire system can be represented in a unified , coherent way . Electrical analogies are particularly used by transducer designers , by their nature they cross energy domains , and in control systems , whose sensors and actuators will typically be domain @-@ crossing transducers . A given system being represented by an electrical analogy may conceivably have no electrical parts at all . For this reason domain @-@ neutral terminology is preferred when developing network diagrams for control systems . 
 Mechanical @-@ electrical analogies are developed by finding relationships between variables in one domain that have a mathematical form identical to variables in the other domain . There is no one , unique way of doing this ; numerous analogies are theoretically possible , but there are two analogies that are widely used : the impedance analogy and the mobility analogy . The impedance analogy makes force and voltage analogous while the mobility analogy makes force and current analogous . By itself , that is not enough to fully define the analogy , a second variable must be chosen . A common choice is to make pairs of power conjugate variables analogous . These are variables which when multiplied together have units of power . In the impedance analogy , for instance , this results in force and velocity being analogous to voltage and current respectively . 
 Variations of these analogies are used for rotating mechanical systems , such as in electric motors . In the impedance analogy , instead of force , torque is made analogous to voltage . It is perfectly possible that both versions of the analogy are needed in , say , a system that includes rotating and reciprocating parts , in which case a force @-@ torque analogy is required within the mechanical domain and a force @-@ torque @-@ voltage analogy to the electrical domain . Another variation is required for acoustical systems ; here pressure and voltage are made analogous ( impedance analogy ) . In the impedance analogy , the ratio of the power conjugate variables is always a quantity analogous to electrical impedance . For instance force / velocity is mechanical impedance . The mobility analogy does not preserve this analogy between impedances across domains , but it does have another advantage over the impedance analogy . In the mobility analogy the topology of networks is preserved , a mechanical network diagram has the same topology as its analogous electrical network diagram . 
 = = Applications = = 
 Mechanical @-@ electrical analogies are used to represent the function of a mechanical system as an equivalent electrical system by drawing analogies between mechanical and electrical parameters . A mechanical system by itself can be so represented , but analogies are of greatest use in electromechanical systems where there is a connection between mechanical and electrical parts . Analogies are especially useful in analysing mechanical filters . These are filters constructed of mechanical parts but designed to work in an electrical circuit through transducers . Circuit theory is well developed in the electrical domain in general and in particular there is a wealth of filter theory available . Mechanical systems can make use of this electrical theory in mechanical designs through a mechanical @-@ electrical analogy . 
 Mechanical @-@ electrical analogies are useful in general where the system includes transducers between different energy domains . Another area of application is the mechanical parts of acoustic systems such as the pickup and tonearm of record players . This was of some importance in early phonographs where the audio is transmitted from the pickup needle to the horn through various mechanical components entirely without electrical amplification . Early phonographs suffered badly from unwanted resonances in the mechanical parts . It was found that these could be eliminated by treating the mechanical parts as components of a low @-@ pass filter which has the effect of flattening out the passband . 
 Electrical analogies of mechanical systems can be used just as a teaching aid , to help understand the behaviour of the mechanical system . In former times , up to about the early 20th century , it was more likely that the reverse analogy would be used ; mechanical analogies were formed of the then little understood electrical phenomena . 
 = = Forming an analogy = = 
 Electrical systems are commonly described by means of a circuit diagram . These are network diagrams that describe the topology of the electrical system using a specialised graph notation . The circuit diagram does not try and represent the true physical dimensions of the electrical components or their actual spatial relationship to each other . This is possible because the electrical components are represented as ideal lumped elements , that is , the element is treated as if it is occupying a single point ( lumped at that point ) . Non @-@ ideal components can be accommodated in this model by using more than one element to represent the component . For instance , a coil intended for use as an inductor has resistance as well as inductance . This can be represented on the circuit diagram as a resistor in series with an inductor . Thus , the first step in forming an analogy of a mechanical system is to describe it as a mechanical network in a similar way , that is , as a topological graph of ideal elements . Alternative , more abstract , representations to the circuit diagram are possible , for instance the bond graph . 
 In an electrical network diagram , limited to linear systems , there are three passive elements : resistance , inductance , and capacitance ; and two active elements : the voltage generator , and the current generator . The mechanical analogs of these elements can be used to construct a mechanical network diagram . What the mechanical analogs of these elements are depends on what variables are chosen to be the fundamental variables . There is a wide choice of variables that can be used , but most commonly used are a power conjugate pair of variables ( described below ) and the pair of Hamiltonian variables derived from these . 
 There is a limit to the applicability of this lumped element model . The model works well if the components are small enough that the time taken for a wave to cross them is insignificant , or equivalently , if there is no significant phase difference in the wave either side of the component . What amounts to significant depends on how accurate the model is required to be , but a common rule of thumb is to require components to be smaller than one sixteenth of a wavelength . Since wavelength decreases with frequency , this puts an upper limit on the frequency that can be covered in this kind of design . This limit is much lower in the mechanical domain than the equivalent limit in the electrical domain . This is because the much higher propagation speeds in the electrical domain lead to longer wavelengths ( mechanical vibrations in steel propagate at about 6 @,@ 000 m / s , electromagnetic waves in common cable types propagate at about 2 x 108 m / s ) . For instance , traditional mechanical filters are only made up to around 600 kHz ( although MEMS devices can operate at much higher frequencies due to their very small size ) . In the electrical domain , on the other hand , the transition from the lumped element model to the distributed element model occurs in the hundreds of megahertz region . 
 In some cases it is possible to continue using a topological network diagram even when components needing a distributed element analysis are present . In the electrical domain , a transmission line , a basic distributed element component , can be included in the model with the introduction of the additional element of electrical length . The transmission line is a special case because it is invariant along its length and hence the full geometry need not be modelled . Another way of dealing with distributed elements is to use a finite element analysis <unk> the distributed element is approximated by a large number of small lumped elements . Just such an approach was used in one paper to model the cochlea of the human ear . Another condition required of electrical systems for the application of the lumped element model is that no significant fields exist outside the component since these can couple to other unrelated components . However , these effects can often be modelled by introducing some virtual lumped elements called strays or <unk> . An analog of this in mechanical systems is vibration in one component being coupled to an unrelated component . 
 = = = Power conjugate variables = = = 
 The power conjugate variables are a pair of variables whose product is power . In the electrical domain the power conjugate variables chosen are invariably voltage ( v ) and current ( i ) . Thus , the power conjugate variables in the mechanical domain are analogs . However , this is not enough to make the choice of mechanical fundamental variables unique . The usual choice for a translational mechanical system is force ( F ) and velocity ( u ) but it is not the only choice . A different pair may be more appropriate for a system with a different geometry , such as a rotational system . 
 Even after the mechanical fundamental variables have been chosen , there is still not a unique set of analogs . There are two ways that the two pairs of power conjugate variables can be associated with each other in the analogy . For instance the associations F with v and u with i can be made . However , the alternative associations u with v and F with i are also possible . This leads to two classes of analogies , the impedance analogies and the mobility analogies . These analogies are the dual of each other . The same mechanical network has analogs in two different electrical networks . These two electrical networks are the dual circuits of each other .
